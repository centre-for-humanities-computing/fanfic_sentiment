    "text": "Aphrodite is wandering a beach off the coast of Syria when she hears it. At first, only a strange, distant rumbling. It's odd, and like nothing she's heard before, but the world is still somewhat new to her and so at first she feels only curiosity, with just a current of unease. Then, she feels the earth tremble beneath her feet, while winds begin to tear at her clothes and hair. A dread begins to build within her, and she hurries to the shore where Eros is playing in the surf. It's as she's reached her son that she finally sees it. In the distance, over the waters, a dark cloud boils up out of seemingly nowhere. Nothing like Zeus' stormclouds, with which she is familiar. This cloud is huge and takes up more of the sky than it should. The winds whip it about and tear tiny spaces in the cloud, through which a nightmare can be seen. An enormous form, more gigantic than anything Aphrodite has ever seen, is within the dark cloud. It appears to cover the entire distance from sea to sky. At its base, a writhing mass of hissing snakes churn the waters. Along the length of the torso, occasional flashes of hands with fingers like blades can be seen. The head of this creature... is not a head. It's many hundreds of heads. They also appear snakelike, except the snake-heads morph into many other animals - all terrifying, with red eyes and sharp teeth. As it approaches, the roar from a hundred throats pierces and deafens and shakes the world. Fire spits from the mouths and adds smoke and steam to the storm. Aphrodite clutches Eros to her and gapes, frozen in terror. She has no idea what she can do. It's moving so fast, she doesn't think she can possibly outrun it. Ares is somewhere nearby - he accompanied her to Syria - but he wandered off in search of an orchard to bring fruit back for her to eat, and she doesn't know exactly where he is, or if he could reach her in time. From the looks of this thing, she doesn't believe Ares could face it anyway. She almost doesn't hear the sound of the voice shouting at her from the waves, over the din of the storm, but Eros does, and tugs her hair to get her to look. A large fish is leaping frantically in the surf, calling to her. The storm grows bigger and roars louder as it approaches with the terrifying giant in its center. With a final fearful glance behind for Ares, Aphrodite leaps into the waters, taking Eros with her. ----------- Aphrodite and Eros cling to the large fish and it immediately dives and attempts to swim down. The first twenty feet or so of water are churning violently, and the fish strains to swim further and deeper. It's difficult to hang on - the scales are slippery, and the water beats at all three of them, threatening to knock Aphrodite and Eros away. Aphrodite grips her son hard enough to make him cry out; but she is terrified of losing hold of him. After a certain depth, the waters calm considerably, and the noise becomes more muted. Another fish joins them - smaller than the first. It's only at this moment that Aphrodite recognizes them. \"Aphros - Bythos!\" The second one offers a tired flip of its tail - a fish version of a smile. \"Lady Aphrodite. Bythos - here, let me take the boy - \" He sidles up alongside the exhausted first fish - Aphros, of course - and after a confirming glance at his mother, Eros takes hold of it. \"We aren't safe yet, Lady Aphrodite,\" says Aphros. \"We have to dive deeper, to stay out of this monster's reach...\" \"But wait - Ares - \" \"I've just come back from dragging him into the deep waters,\" Bythos assures her. \"I've told him that we will keep you safe. I aided him in turning into a fish as well, so that he could swim to Egypt - that is where he hopes to rendezvous with the other gods.\" \"The other gods? What is happening up there?\" The fish look grim. \"This is Typhon. He was born of the rage of Gaia and Tartarus, and seeks war on Olympus. You cannot possibly fight him, Lady - nor can Ares. All gods have fled. Ares suspects they are in Egypt.\" \"...My husband? Hephaestus?\" Aphrodite cannot imagine him running swiftly enough on his twisted legs, and her chest tightens in worry. \"All gods have fled,\" Bythos repeats. \"They turned to birds and flew away. All gods... save Zeus.\" Aphrodite drops her head to the scales and blinks in shock. Olympus deserted? But it must be. No god that she knows could face such a monster. Not even... \"Zeus did not escape? Is he slain?\" Aphrodite doesn't know how to feel about this. Her feelings towards Zeus are ambivalent, to say the least. \"Typhon has not reached Olympus yet. Zeus has remained, in defiance.\" The fish say no more, but Aphrodite knows enough of their silence to guess the rest. They believe this may be Zeus' final stand. They dive deeper. It's smoother, now, as Aphros and Bythos split the work of carrying their passengers, and the turmoil of the surface doesn't reach here. Eros is clinging to Bythos with one hand, and Aphrodite's hand with the other. He's frightened. It's new to him - he's still only a small child, even newer to taking this physical form than Aphrodite herself, and he's distressed by this unfamiliar new vulnerability. When they were primordial beings, a creature like Typhon would have only been a curiosity to them. As the water darkens and stills, and the noise above is virtually silenced, Eros gains a little more confidence and begins swimming alongside Bythos, still keeping one hand on the old fish. He must not remember them from before. The two ancient fish were foster parents, of a sort, when Aphrodite was only foam and seawater, churning aimlessly and considering what form she might take. The fish had guided her through the waters and told her stories to amuse the infant goddess - mostly, tales of the adventures of handsome river gods, and courageous sea beasts, and the lovely water-nymphs. Many tales of the all-encompassing Queen Amphitrite and her consort, the mighty King Poseidon. They hadn't told her much of Zeus or the Olympians - they were of little interest to fish. Deeper still, and Eros, who has already forgotten the danger, darts ahead in sudden excitement at a figure that emerges from the dark waters. \"Uncle 'Seidon!\" the child yells, gleeful, throwing himself at the Lord of the Sea. He's not Eros' uncle, of course, but in Olympus, Poseidon is either a brother or uncle. Poseidon is a handsome man - most gods are, of course; save for one. He's tall and powerfully built, like his brothers. His hair is a deep green, so dark it almost seems black, except when touched by Helios' rays. The long hair is usually tied back, to keep it from swirling about when he is within his realm, and he rarely wears anything much more than a perizoma for the sake of modesty. Any other clothes get in the way, in the water. Aphrodite takes a moment to appreciate the chiseled, handsome virility of the Lord of the Sea. Here, in this place, he seems just like how she remembers from her daydreams as a child - mysterious and powerful; mercurial but always splendid and noble. Being one of his peers has diminished much of the mystery, as well as the idea that he is particularly noble in behavior, but, well. She's hardly in a position to call the kettle black. Poseidon catches her son in his arms as she bows her head briefly in respect and acknowledgement of her presence in his realm. \"King Poseidon. Thank you for sending your servants to rescue us.\" Poseidon's normally totally impassive face is uncharacteristically expressive at the moment - he's making a face at Eros while the child tugs ungently at his beard. \"I'm glad they did, though I'm sure they would have anyway. They're your old companions, after all.\" He winces again as Eros tugs on the small hoop earrings the god wears - another detail she'd forgotten. He always removes them when he comes above the surface, since there's such a gendered association with earrings, but most of the ocean-dwelling humanoids wear them. They're one of the few types of ornamentations that doesn't interfere with swimming. Aphrodite hides a smile at his discomfort and places a hand on the scales of Aphros and Bythos. \"My old companions came through for me now, as they did so many years before. My dear friends, I wonder if you would be kind enough to rescue your king from the torments of yet another child?\" The fish flip their fins in amusement. \"It would be our pleasure, Lady Aphrodite. Noble Eros, if you would...\" They hustle the child away to play with some pearls scattered on the sand beneath them, illuminated by the light of Poseidon's trident, which he has planted nearby. The Sea-king sighs. \"Thank you.\" \"Of course. Though, I suppose you have an even more fearsome monster to concern yourself with - \" She glances up, towards the surface, where there is still the faintest muffled sound - all that's left of the roar of Typhon. She looks back at Poseidon, who hasn't moved or changed expression. \"Ah, yes. I've heard. As you can see... we are only dimly aware of the troubles above. My realm is largely untouched. Same with Hades, I hear,\" he adds, as she blinks in surprise. \"It has been... quite a few years, since I dwelled here,\" she says, uncertainly. \"From what I remember of her, though, surely Queen Amphitrite is mighty indeed. Perhaps strong enough to face Typhon.\" Poseidon's face remains blank. \"I suppose she might be.\" There is a long pause. It's... unexpected, that this is turning out to be a dangerous conversation topic, but upon reflection, maybe she shouldn't be surprised. \"Are you not worried for your brother's fate?\" she asks softly, keeping her posture relaxed, watching Eros play with the old fish. A few nereids come to watch, a little ways off, she smiles at them, making every aspect of her demeanor calm. \"As concerned as he was, when I dove into the sea to face Amphitrite, unknowing whether she would concede the realm; share it with me; or slay me for my attempt,\" he answers. His posture is a bit stiff, and his voice a bit too casual, which is good - if he's defensive, it means he wants her to see his point of view. If there was heat, or agitation, she'd be facing a problem. \"Aphros and Bythos told me that story,\" she says, gesturing to where they are playing hide-and-seek with Eros. \"The tale of how the upstart young Poseidon impressed Queen Amphitrite with his courage. She was so impressed that she became shy and hid from such a courageous, handsome man, and the mysterious interloper had to send a charming dolphin to coax her out. A very romantic story... very influential to me, when I finally decided to leave the waves.\" \"I'm sure they gave you the child's version. They left out how I was absolutely positive she was going to destroy me for my boldness and impertinence. I had brought my trident knowing it was not going to do much - how do you fight the sea? I thought I would be crushed, left at the bottom of the sea to dwell there defeated until the end of time. I got lucky that she mistook desperation for confidence.\" \"Many tales get condensed, and leave out the messy parts. I still think it's romantic.\" \"In any case, I faced her alone.\" They fall silent for a moment. She hears a muffled booming, distant overhead. Poseidon speaks again. \"Very, very briefly, in the window of time between being thrown up from Cronus' belly, and when we drew the lots - when my brothers and sisters were still planning our strike, Demeter and I ran a scouting mission together. In preparation for the final battle. We took the form of horses, to disguise ourselves, and grew close. Both of us enjoyed ourselves enough that we could almost forget the seriousness of the situation. We spoke of the future. We thought, perhaps we might marry, and rule the plains together.\" The rest doesn't really need to be said, and he doesn't say it. He became the god of the sea when they drew lots. The sea, which has little to do with the plains, and he would have little use to Demeter as a consort. And the sea had its own inhabitants, its own rulers, that Poseidon had to conquer somehow, by speech or by force. Aphrodite had assumed that, also, was a team effort, but apparently not. She thinks, though, that it explains why Demeter never did marry anyone, and Hera never tries to make her. \"It never turns out how you expect, does it. I'm a little dissatisfied with my own situation,\" she admits aloud for the first time in her existence. Poseidon gives her a side-eye. \"You mean, your marriage to Hephaestus?\" \"No. Heph's sweet. I like making him happy.\" She remembers Hephaestus, or at any rate his name, from her incorporeal seafoam days of drifting through Poseidon's realm. The sad, angry, mysterious boy, fostered by two of the nereids, creating beautiful treasures for no one while he stayed locked up in his grotto. Aphrodite, with her romantic mind still filled with fairy tales, had remembered instantly when she heard the name again on Olympus. She sighs. \"Heph is a fine husband, and I'm happy I chose him. But Ares needs me too. He's just as lonely as his brother, even though he's a lot more stoic about it. Right up until he blows up in fury... a lot like you, actually. Anyway, I want to love both of them, and bring them happiness. I want to love everyone, and accept their love for me - not even just men. Back when I was seafoam - back when I was still a concept, without form, I always intended to be more of a free spirit. To drift from person to person, and inspire love in them. And I'll admit to being a bit disappointed, after so many tales of hearing of the powerful and majestic Queen Amphitrite, that up in Zeus' realm a goddess is never so impressive as her husband.\" He shrugs. \"It's always strange to me, how they interpret our marriage. But I'm the only one they see, so they make their assumptions. Though... I've noticed, that Ares defers to you, often.\" \"He does.\" A particularly loud roar manages to pierce the depths, and Eros, Aphros and Bythos rush back over, seeking protection. Poseidon seems unconcerned. He tickles under Eros' chin to make the boy laugh, and sends him over to a couple of nereids to play. \"Zeus has not yet been called upon to sacrifice much, or to prove he is worthy of the realm he gained. Typhon is not a threat to my realm. He is not a threat to Hades, either, and you won't see Hades intervene. Tartarus is Hades' burden, and he also faced that alone. We drew our lots. I am responsible for the sea. Hades is responsible for the underworld... Zeus is king of the heavens. This is something Zeus has to do, and he knows it.\" \"I understand. I thank you, still, for offering me shelter.\" \"You're a daughter of the sea, in some ways. You are welcome here any time.\" He hesitates, and looks steadfastly off into the dark waters, not at her. \"If Zeus falls to Typhon, it would be fate speaking. We could start over... remake the world again. You could wander from lover to lover as you pleased, and be worshipped as you deserve. And perhaps. Perhaps I could return to the plains as a Lord of the Horses once again.\" \"Perhaps,\" she says, giving him a kiss on the cheek, because he looks like he needs one. -------- They stay for a day or so, in Poseidon's palace. Poseidon is clearly willing to take her to bed, and everyone knows Amphitrite takes no notice of infidelities (or even cares); but Aphrodite is still too worried about Ares and Hephaestus to consider it. Eros plays with Aphros and Bythos and it makes her heart twinge, to see him so free and at ease, the way she herself must have been once. Before she'd left the waves and been forced to face the real world. Eventually, Poseidon's son Triton tells them of the defeat of Typhon - how Zeus was nearly destroyed, but managed to rally and crush the monster. Celebrations are in order. There is no angry summons from Zeus, which confirms what Poseidon said - it was his monster to defeat, and he did not expect help from Poseidon or Hades. The Lord of the Sea's face is perfectly blank as he receives the news. He nods in acknowledgement, and if he's disappointed that his chances of doing something different with the rest of eternity have vanished along with Typhon... he makes no sign. Aphrodite leaves first; it would be extremely unseemly for the two of them to arrive at Olympus together. She isn't sure how to feel either, about Typhon's defeat. She's relieved, so relieved, that Ares and Hephaestus are all right. But the world that Poseidon described... the chance to rewrite it all... When Aphros and Bythos bring her and Eros to the shore again, she turns and kneels before them. \"I am grateful to you for risking your lives to bring Eros and me to safety. I won't ever forget how terrifying that day was; and the bravery of my oldest companions in saving us.\" They bow their heads. \"It was our privilege to help you, Lady Aphrodite.\" \"When I have returned to Olympus, I will make a constellation of you. Stars over the night sky to remind the world of my beloved friends.\" She makes good on her word; completing the task before Poseidon even arrives on Olympus. Two fish, joined together by a cord, representing her holding Eros' hand as they fled to safety. \"Pisces,\" she names it. \"All who are born under this sign will be selfless, they are always willing to help others, without hoping to get anything back. They will be ruled by empathy and emotional capacity.\" The obvious connection is the selfless fish, who rescued her and Eros from danger. But for her, Pisces will be a reminder too of the bittersweetness of what might have been, and a reminder of a conversation where empathy and emotion was found in an unexpected place.",

    "text": "The change is subtle; it's not as though Ares was ever a particularly open or approachable sort of god. Quite the contrary, in fact: if you'd asked any of the regular inhabitants or visitors of Olympus whether it was unusual for Ares to be surly or to answer any greetings or polite conversation with a rude shut-down, you'd get immediate affirmation from everyone that things were proceeding as usual for the belligerent god. Even the god's (very) short list of friends -Hermes, Artemis and Aphrodite - would probably agree. But there's something different about this. It finally comes together for Hermes after a few days of this. He's out fooling around in the lesser courtyard behind the palatial halls of Olympus, and observes Ares as he's returning with the corpse of a huge, ancient boar across his shoulders, tusks as long as the god's arms - doubtless the result of a battle fought somewhere in the foothills, Ares' usual hobby. Ares is mighty even by the standards of a god, and he's still staggering under the weight of this thing that he's dragging around with him, trailing blood as he heaves up the last few yards to the back door to his stables (made of stone to accommodate Ares' fiery steeds where they stay when not burning the back pastures). The facts: 1) If this was any other god you might think this boar could be a respectful sacrifice to Zeus. But it's Ares, so no. 2) If he was going to eat it, he'd make servants drag it up the mountain. 3) If it's the corpse of a former rival, transformed into a beast and then killed (there's precedent for that), Ares would have left it where it lay. 4) Ares isn't usually interested in loot or treasure - once the battle is over, he checks out. Unlikely he'd keep a souvenir of this battle if he never did for the giants Echidnades or Mimon. Maybe he thinks a lover would be impressed by this one? Must be a new one; Aphrodite has delicately let him know that she prefers jewelry over carcasses. If so, it's definitely worth teasing him about. Hermes makes his conclusions and pops up next to Ares with a grin on his face. \"Heeeeeeey, Ares! Buddy! What're you up to?\" Hermes floats alongside Ares, head tilted over to better peer at the staggering god. Ares stumbles, startled, and curses before turning to level a truly impressive scowl at Hermes. \"What the hell do you care, Shortass? Fuck off!\" \"That's a whole lotta pig you got there!\" Hermes makes a big show of examining it from all angles, hovering annoyingly close to Ares, who's steaming already and trying to keep his eye on Hermes. \"Got anything fun in mind? Are we having a barbecue at Ares' place tonight?\" \"No! It's not for you!\" Ares snarls, maneuvering himself and the boar with difficulty to aim a kick in Hermes' direction. Hermes dodges easily, drifting in closer and beaming. \"So, is it for someone else? A gift, maybe? For someone special?\" Ares' scowl deepens even as his face reddens - which could equally be a sign of embarrassment or rage or both, but Hermes isn't worried either way. His own grin broadens and he claps his hands to his face in a theatrical expression of delight. \"It is! Why, Ares! What a thoughtful guy you are - and who's the lucky one who's getting such a lovely gift?\" Hermes teases, poking Ares' cheeks playfully and laughing at the face he makes. \"None of your business, brat! Eat shit and fuck off!\" Hermes clucks his tongue. \"Aww, but Ares, anyone that special to you is someone I want to meet - unless I've already met them before?\" He puts his chin in his hands, reclining backwards in the air and pretending to consider it. But, interestingly, Ares doesn't give the expected reaction. Hermes is expecting intensified scowls, barking insults, the usual signs of Ares' version of squirming in embarrassment. But instead, the god grits his teeth, looking determined. Hermes' eyebrows lift quizzically at Ares, and he taps a finger to his chin thoughtfully. \"So, it isn't someone I've met. Someone new?\" \"I told you to mind your own business, you nosy little shit!\" Ares growls, kicking the door to his stables and immediately shoving the pig through. There's a noise within - his horses? Perhaps, but Hermes has heard many horses before, and this sounds... raspier... Ares quickly spins around, shutting the door nearly all the way to prevent Hermes from peeking inside. \"And you better not come back here! Stay OUT!\" The door slams shut the rest of the way. Hermes stays where he is for a moment, floating gently and tapping his chin, before allowing the breeze to catch him and drift him up, back towards the palace proper. What's different? Ares always tells Hermes, and everyone else, to fuck off. He's belligerent and loves a fight. But he doesn't hide, doesn't fend people off, he engages. Once Hermes realizes that this is the difference, it seems incredibly obvious. Ordinarily, if asked what he's been up to, Ares might reply with a gruff \"out fighting,\" or occasionally, \"out fucking.\" When he has a disagreement with someone, it's out in the open. He absolutely never bothers to hide or justify his actions. Ares charges ahead with his life, aggressive and confident in everything he does. But this time, he's being secretive. And now Hermes' curiosity is piqued. Especially when he sees that Ares' horses are currently leaving burning hoofprints behind them as they wander the paddock that winds behind the palace grounds. So, confirmed, whatever made the noise inside the stables, it wasn't them. There are other curious things: strange new scars start turning up on Ares, and his clothes and hair are frequently singed. Artemis mentions in passing that when she was sparring with him recently, she noticed that a new tattoo had appeared on his skin. She had assumed the new sinuous flames related to \"the flames of war\" and teased him about how they brought out his eyes. Hermes snickers but thinks, Ares has been the god of war for a while. Most of the gods rarely get new markings after they've been settled in their roles. Why would the tattoo only show up now? For several weeks, Ares can be seen sneaking away from Hestia's Hearth carrying armloads of the snacks away - meat, mostly, Hermes observes, but also eggs and honey and really it's the quantity that's odd. He mentions it off-handedly to Athena, there goes Ares with some snacks I guess, wonder why? Her only response is to sniff and say they should all be grateful to be spared his appalling table manners. At a routine and boring council, Demeter mentions that she received Ares' request for more increased grain to be delivered to his stables. Hermes' curiosity is starting to drive him mad, especially since Ares is normally so bad at keeping secrets. Discretion is not his specialty. And teasing him - which, when used as a form of interrogation, is normally a foregone conclusion - is only getting tight-lipped scowls in response. Hermes asks Aphrodite. Often, if Ares is out of sorts, it's because Aphrodite has taken another new lover. But Aphrodite only shakes her head. \"I'm taking some time off from looking afield for new lovers. Actually, Ares and I were together just the other day...\" she trails off, looking reflectively into the distance. \"...He may not be much for pretty speech, but he has a silver tongue nonetheless, let me tell you.\" Hermes laughs and groans at the same time. \"Well, great! Good to know he's not a one-trick pony.\" She smirks at him; they routinely swap dirty and embarrassing stories about Ares, both to give each other ammunition to tease him and more things to endear him to them. \"More of a stallion than a pony, but yes, the other night was at least three or four tricks in the first hour alone.\" \"That stud. Such passion. Does he start crying in the heat of the moment?\" \"No, no tears, but he curses... oh, but you know, 'heat of the moment' makes me think... you've seen his new flame markings, right? First of all, if you haven't had a new marking in a while, it's apparently pretty sensitive skin there, and as it happens, the flame markings go all the way down to -\" Aphrodite goes on, explaining, while they both crack up laughing, and yeah, Hermes is absolutely gonna make a note of this information. Later, he's back on the case. He asks Helios, the \"eye in the sky\" who sees everything his sun touches. Helios' response is perhaps not unexpected: \"Fuck you, you little pot-stirring shit, I'm not getting involved in that guy's crap ever again.\" \"Aww, come on, Helios, everyone got over it eventually...\" \"Nope. You can fuck right off. Never again. You fuckers can't handle the truth.\" Helios leans back in his chariot thoughtfully, before his scowl turns into a grin abruptly. \"You can ask Selene, maybe. She sees everything her moon touches.\" Helios sometimes enjoys referring the younger gods to his sister - although she has been faithful to her beloved Endymion, she does like to work up her appetite by winding up her visitors. The three Titans find it very entertaining to set off the younger gods, to say nothing of the mortals. Hermes does visit Selene, but only because he knows that the insatiable goddess has recently been to visit Endymion, so Hermes' balls should be safe this time. \"Ahh, yes, Ares and his nighttime excursions. Many evenings of entertainment to be seen there.\" Hermes amuses himself by imagining Ares' reaction to the small, knowing smile on Selene's pretty face, if he could see it. Hermes bows respectfully. \"I'm certain of that. Ares' daylight excursions are quite entertaining as well. I'll never understand why most of Olympus doesn't see it.\" \"Well, I do have the advantage of watching the show from far above... miles away from his notorious rages. And you have the advantage of never being troubled by anything, ever.\" That's not true by a long shot, but Hermes doesn't show his cards as swiftly as the other gods. \"I just think he's funny.\" Selene nods thoughtfully. \"To answer your question, little herald, your amusing friend has spent more time than usual at his stronghold on Thrace. Not outdoors, where I can see him, but he rushes from one closed building to the next.\" Thrace's war palace is one of only two temples dedicated to Ares in all of Greece. Its people are warlike and considered savage and unpleasant by the majority of the gods, so they do not often visit if they don't absolutely have to. Hermes visits there the next day and scouts around. He spots Demeter's grain... piled around messily by a barred stone building behind the main temple where Ares resides when he's there. Some of it has spilled out onto the ground; the mice must be loving that. The roar of Ares' flaming steeds, approaching from the sky in the distance, interrupts Hermes from picking the lock to get in, but not before he could hear some very mysterious animal sounds from within. He fully plans to go back, but he needs a way to keep Ares occupied. Artemis, perhaps, she can keep him busy with sparring. So Hermes goes to Apollo, currently the only one who knows the location of Artemis' secret grove. Well, actually, Hermes does know - it's part of his job to know, in case Zeus needs to deliver a message to her, or summon her directly. But for as long as that hasn't happened yet, Hermes would rather let her have her secret grove and go through Apollo when he wishes to speak to her. Apollo is seated on a bench in his courtyard. Apollo's halls are, as one might expect, incredibly tasteful and elegant. He generally keeps musicians and beautiful objects (or people) around more or less perpetually for the ambiance. Today the ambiance staff has been dismissed, to allow Apollo to play at the lyre himself in solitude as he watches birds flit around a fountain splashing water nearby. Hermes sets down lightly before him, offering a cheeky bow to his senior. \"My Lord Apollo. The radiance of the sun dazzles the eyes as always. The sweet tumble of music from your elegant throat fills the ears with joy. The scent of your perfume tickles the nose. An hour spent in your presence is like a thousand years in paradise.\" \"Enough with the flattery, Hermes Dolios.\" Apollo uses the title that refers to Hermes' domain of wiles and craftiness, but he sounds amused, and Hermes notes that he waited until Hermes was done paying him compliments. \"What are you after today? I'm not sure I'm interested in losing another bet you'll cheat to win.\" Apollo idly plucks a few chords on the lyre. Hermes allows his eyes to linger on the long fingers for a moment before turning back to Apollo's face with a wink. \"I'm not always out to cheat people, Apollo!\" Hermes shifts to informality easily, sauntering closer. \"Maybe I just want to hang out with my respected senior for a while. Listen to you sing a song.\" He positions himself suggestively close to Apollo's lap. \"Get a quickie from a pro?\" Apollo laughs, and poetic embellishment aside, it really is like watching the sun come out from behind the clouds. \"You phrased that like a question. Are you the pro offering, or is that supposed to be me?\" Hermes grins wickedly. \"Could be either, or both at the same time - oof!\" Apollo has delivered a solid kick to Hermes' midsection, sending him tumbling backwards through the air. Hermes rights himself and floats back with a pout in place. \"I'll consider it - if you tell me what you're really here for,\" Apollo smiles at him mildly. Hermes gives an exaggerated sigh and flops down on the bench next to him. \"I actually came here to ask if you could get Artemis for me. I need her to keep Ares occupied - and it's been a while since she kicked the crap out of him, I'm sure she'd be eager.\" Apollo snorts. \"I'm sure she would too. I'm sure beating Ares is quite therapeutic.\" Apollo speaks dismissively of the war god, but Hermes has noticed that he hasn't been as cruel anymore as he used to be. The Aloadai had come to claim Artemis, after all, and Ares was captured and imprisoned trying to defeat them. As much as Apollo may find Ares unlikable, it's impossible for him to be the enemy of a god who suffered so much in the defense of Apollo's sister. Hermes taps his fingers lightly against Apollo's leg. \"You could even skip that step if you were willing to tell me what he's up to? You know, using your twisty turny prophetic ability?\" He wiggles his fingers in the direction of Apollo's temple. Apollo catches his wrist before his hair can be mussed. \"My 'twisty turny' prophecies are not the same as omniscience. If I wanted to know what Ares is up to - which I don't, particularly - I would have to go to a great deal of effort to see it.\" Hermes catches sight of some movement, just over Apollo's shoulder, and hides a smile. \"You aren't curious? I just get the feeling that he might be up to something. Like he's being sneaky.\" \"Normally I get a sense that something warrants my attention and effort, if it's sufficiently large-scale or directly relates to me. Ares apparently isn't doing anything huge at present or, luckily, anything to indicate his path will cross with mine anytime soon. So, no. Whatever you're up to, you're on your own. Though I will visit Artemis later, if you like.\" Apollo shifts, turning slightly on the bench, and Hermes quickly zips in front of him to catch his attention again. \"I sure appreciate it, Lord Apollo. But now that business is concluded.... How about a kiss goodbye?\" He gives an exaggerated suggestive wink, a winning smile and a lewd gesture with his hands. Apollo strums the strings of the lyre thoughtfully before setting it down. \"I suppose I can give you the privilege. And perhaps you can use this as an opportunity to impress me.\" Afterwards, when they've had their fun and Apollo has finally sent him on his way, Hermes takes a moment to drink in the irony of Apollo's previous statement, about how his path doesn't intersect with Ares, before he speeds off through the air in the direction of Ares, who is currently still making his way down the side of the mountain with one of Apollo's cows tied to his back. Neither Ares nor the cow looks happy about their situation. \"I guess this counts as you not crossing paths with Apollo, right? What he don't know, won't hurt him?\" He taps his chin thoughtfully, watching the struggle down the mountainside. \"That's good sense, only stealing one cow. I overreached, stealing the whole herd. That's how I got caught. You'll probably be fine, though.\" Ares' scowl is practically weaponized. Hermes wonders if the red on the god's face is a warning sign of rage or a cute little blush - hard to tell, with Ares. \"You were really gonna do that, right in fucking front of me. While I was standing right there, you were gonna deep-throat him.\" \"We did a swap, actually,\" Hermes says brightly. \"And all as a favor to you! Here you are, almost escaped, and no one the wiser that Apollo's got one less cow than he had a half hour ago.\" \"You better not tell anyone-!\" Ares starts to growl, but Hermes cuts him off by placing his hands on Ares' cheeks, squishing them together to make a funny fish face. \"Obviously I'm not gonna tell anyone, dumbass. But seriously. Whatever you're doing, you're gonna get caught soon if you're not careful. Why don't you let me help out? I'm much better at sneaky shit than you are.\" It's testament to how the past few months have been straining at Ares that he doesn't immediately bat Hermes' hands away. He stares at Hermes for what must be a full ten seconds in silence, fish-faced, before pulling back and looking away. \"I don't - this isn't your concern - \" he forces out, and Hermes puts out his tongue to make a rude noise at him. \"C'mon, dipshit! We're buddies! When have I let you down before?\" Ares drags his eyes back to Hermes, briefly pausing to thump the cow on the flank as it moos in annoyance. \"I could get in trouble for this. I'm not sure but it's a possibility. Like, real trouble, maybe. And you'd get in trouble too, and it won't be as cute as the other times because you'd be associated with me.\" Hermes hates that this is true. Ares speaks plainly and flatly, no matter how bad the situation. His inability to sugarcoat when he talks has bolstered his reputation for cruelty, but there's nothing worse than when he turns that truth on himself and bears it without flinching. But Hermes is confident in his own abilities. Ares might fear that associating with the war god will make a situation worse; but Hermes believes that this whole situation being associated with the charming messenger god will make it easier on Ares. If they even get caught. Hermes Dolios knows what he's doing. So he kisses the tips of his first and second fingers, presses them to Ares' nose, and beams at him. \"I don't give a shit. Let's do this!\" And he flips up through the air, over Ares' head, to land on the back of the cow on his shoulders. \"Alala!\" he cheers, using Ares' preferred battle-cry. Below him, Ares is still a moment longer, before the god finally begins to plod forward again. \"Wasn't even sure you were sitting up there. Skinny-ass, you barely weigh anything,\" he mutters. Their conversation for the rest of the journey to Thrace is much more of a return to how it used to be: Hermes tells jokes and stories and sings songs with ridiculous or lewd lyrics, and laughs at the grouchy curses he receives in return. He's delighted when Ares actually stumbles, laughing in spite of himself, at a particularly well-timed punchline about Athena's musical talents. Behind the temple in Thrace, Ares ties the cow to stake. Hermes nimbly seats himself atop Ares' shoulders directly now, and notes how tense they are. The guy needs a good massage immediately. They go to the stable door and Ares unlocks it, but hesitates before opening it. The mysterious noises are louder now, and the grain is still strewn about randomly. Hermes is dying to see what's inside, but it seems like Ares has one final admonition for him. \"You have got to keep your mouth shut about this. Especially to your stupid boyfriend Apollo. That pretty asshole is gonna-\" \"You've totally got a crush on him, don't you?\" Hermes inquires innocently, just to see Ares blink, mouth opening and then snapping shut, too bewildered to even get angry or embarrassed. Hermes takes advantage of his indecisiveness to jump off Ares' shoulders and shove his way past him, through the door, ignoring Ares' attempted grab. \"Speaking of Apollo, enough with the lectures! I'm on the team already! What chthonic mystery are you keeping - oh!\" Whatever he was expecting, Hermes somehow both is, and is not surprised at all, to see the secret revealed: Two dragons, about four feet long, are currently climbing about on the support posts and ceiling beams of the stable's interior, and both make excited squawking noises when they see Ares. Moving quickly, they make their way down as Ares rushes inside and shuts the door swiftly behind him. The dragons are objectively beautiful creatures, in spite of the clear promise of what terrible beings they will be in the future. Their bodies are long and sinuous, with tiny useless-looking limbs (six of them) that resemble a bird's talons. Their scales shimmer and color seems to ripple through them, though always in shades of green. One appears to have golden highlights; the other has silver. Upon their backs are tiny little glowing spikes that run down the length of their spines. The buds of their wings are forming, three sets placed at each set of shoulders, and their heads resemble nothing so much as a wolf. Their teeth and claws, tiny though they are, definitely appear sharp - this is confirmed when they start climbing up Ares, leaving scratches and nicks as they nip at him affectionately. \"Found 'em near Mount Parnassus. Dunno if they're the offspring of Python or not - they seem too young,\" Ares says, watching Hermes uneasily, ignoring the way the dragons are leaving claw marks on his skin. Hermes is actually rendered speechless, hands covering his mouth, eyes shining as he watches the dragons start chewing on Ares' tunic, making excited, rapid tuck-tuck-tuck noises, interspersed with mild hissing at each other. They adore him, just like loyal hounds, and the ease and familiarity they display as they clamber over Ares tells Hermes that this has been going on for a while. \"Oh, by Hyperion's glorious balls,\" he manages, delight coursing through his voice. \"Oh, this is - this is the cutest fucking thing I've ever seen in my life -!\" Ares' face twists back into a scowl with something like relief. \"Look, don't be an asshole, this is serious!\" \"Will you shut up?! Quit being such a sulk! This is fantastic! You have little tiny baby dragons and they luuuuuurve yoooouuuu!!!\" \"You're such a -\" \"Can I pet them? Will they burn me?\" \"Eh? Uh, yeah, probably...\" Ares' face flickers between annoyance and confusion, and some other emotion that doesn't look at home on his face. \"I'll wait till they're used to me,\" Hermes watches in fascination as one of the dragons stretches its neck and snaps up a mouse that had been feeding on the loose grain scattered about the place. Aha, that's why all the grain! \"Used to you...?\" \"Yeah! I'll come by a couple times a week, and I'll bring little treats to get on their good side - I bet it's just the same as Arty's hunting dogs! And maybe we can sneak them out somewhere - hmm. Where was Dionysus born again? That's a pretty isolated place.\" Hermes keeps talking without pause, and without acknowledging the awkward noises Ares is making and the way his fists clench and unclench as the dragons wrap themselves around him happily and gnaw his ears, thrumming softly. They have an advantage over their master, then - Ares still has no idea what to do with happiness, or gratitude, or any other positive emotion. Before the night is over, Hermes has stolen about two months' worth of supplies, and gets caught with none of them - not even by Selene, who raises his eyebrows at him as he sneaks a sack into the stables in Thrace. He winks at her and flashes a pair of Apollo's sandals which he stole solely to allay suspicion. And yeah, a distant part of his mind can see this being a problem down the road, but right at this moment... watching the confused, scowly happiness in Ares' face... the unspeakably adorable way the he loves those dragons, and they adore him... Hermes generally thinks any mischief is worth the trouble he might get in, but he thinks he'd happily risk Zeus and Hera's wrath both for this.",
    "sentences": [
      "The change is subtle; it's not as though Ares was ever a particularly open or approachable sort of god.",
      "Quite the contrary, in fact: if you'd asked any of the regular inhabitants or visitors of Olympus whether it was unusual for Ares to be surly or to answer any greetings or polite conversation with a rude shut-down, you'd get immediate affirmation from everyone that things were proceeding as usual for the belligerent god.",
      "Even the god's (very) short list of friends -Hermes, Artemis and Aphrodite - would probably agree.",
      "But there's something different about this.",
      "It finally comes together for Hermes after a few days of this.",
      "He's out fooling around in the lesser courtyard behind the palatial halls of Olympus, and observes Ares as he's returning with the corpse of a huge, ancient boar across his shoulders, tusks as long as the god's arms - doubtless the result of a battle fought somewhere in the foothills, Ares' usual hobby.",
      "Ares is mighty even by the standards of a god, and he's still staggering under the weight of this thing that he's dragging around with him, trailing blood as he heaves up the last few yards to the back door to his stables (made of stone to accommodate Ares' fiery steeds where they stay when not burning the back pastures).",
      "The facts: 1)",
      "If this was any other god you might think this boar could be a respectful sacrifice to Zeus.",
      "But it's Ares, so no. 2) If he was going to eat it, he'd make servants drag it up the mountain.",
      "3) If it's the corpse of a former rival, transformed into a beast and then killed (there's precedent for that), Ares would have left it where it lay.",
      "4) Ares isn't usually interested in loot or treasure - once the battle is over, he checks out.",
      "Unlikely he'd keep a souvenir of this battle if he never did for the giants Echidnades or Mimon.",
      "Maybe he thinks a lover would be impressed by this one?",
      "Must be a new one; Aphrodite has delicately let him know that she prefers jewelry over carcasses.",
      "If so, it's definitely worth teasing him about.",
      "Hermes makes his conclusions and pops up next to Ares with a grin on his face.",
      "\"Heeeeeeey, Ares!",
      "Buddy!",
      "What're you up to?\" Hermes floats alongside Ares, head tilted over to better peer at the staggering god.",
      "Ares stumbles, startled, and curses before turning to level a truly impressive scowl at Hermes.",

      "Fuck off!\"",
      "\"That's a whole lotta pig you got there!\"",

      "Hermes dodges easily, drifting in closer and beaming.",
      "\"So, is it for someone else?",
      "A gift, maybe?",
      "For someone special?\" Ares' scowl deepens even as his face reddens - which could equally be a sign of embarrassment or rage or both, but Hermes isn't worried either way.",
      "His own grin broadens and he claps his hands to his face in a theatrical expression of delight.",
      "\"It is! Why, Ares!",
      "What a thoughtful guy you are - and who's the lucky one who's getting such a lovely gift?\" Hermes teases, poking Ares' cheeks playfully and laughing at the face he makes.",
      "\"None of your business, brat!",
      "Eat shit and fuck off!\"",
      "Hermes clucks his tongue.",
      "\"Aww, but Ares, anyone that special to you is someone I want to meet - unless I've already met them before?\"",
      "He puts his chin in his hands, reclining backwards in the air and pretending to consider it.",
      "But, interestingly, Ares doesn't give the expected reaction.",
      "Hermes is expecting intensified scowls, barking insults, the usual signs of Ares' version of squirming in embarrassment.",
      "But instead, the god grits his teeth, looking determined.",
      "Hermes' eyebrows lift quizzically at Ares, and he taps a finger to his chin thoughtfully.",
      "\"So, it isn't someone I've met.",
      "Someone new?\"",
      "\"I told you to mind your own business, you nosy little shit!\"",
      "Ares growls, kicking the door to his stables and immediately shoving the pig through.",
      "There's a noise within - his horses?",
      "Perhaps, but Hermes has heard many horses before, and this sounds... raspier...",
      "Ares quickly spins around, shutting the door nearly all the way to prevent Hermes from peeking inside.",
      "\"And you better not come back here!",
      "Stay OUT!\"",
      "The door slams shut the rest of the way.",
      "Hermes stays where he is for a moment, floating gently and tapping his chin, before allowing the breeze to catch him and drift him up, back towards the palace proper.",
      "What's different?",
      "Ares always tells Hermes, and everyone else, to fuck off.",
      "He's belligerent and loves a fight.",
      "But he doesn't hide, doesn't fend people off, he engages.",
      "Once Hermes realizes that this is the difference, it seems incredibly obvious.",
      "Ordinarily, if asked what he's been up to, Ares might reply with a gruff \"out fighting,\" or occasionally, \"out fucking.\"",
      "When he has a disagreement with someone, it's out in the open.",
      "He absolutely never bothers to hide or justify his actions.",
      "Ares charges ahead with his life, aggressive and confident in everything he does.",
      "But this time, he's being secretive.",
      "And now Hermes' curiosity is piqued.",
      "Especially when he sees that Ares' horses are currently leaving burning hoofprints behind them as they wander the paddock that winds behind the palace grounds.",
      "So, confirmed, whatever made the noise inside the stables, it wasn't them.",
      "There are other curious things: strange new scars start turning up on Ares, and his clothes and hair are frequently singed.",
      "Artemis mentions in passing that when she was sparring with him recently, she noticed that a new tattoo had appeared on his skin.",
      "She had assumed the new sinuous flames related to \"the flames of war\" and teased him about how they brought out his eyes.",
      "Hermes snickers but thinks, Ares has been the god of war for a while.",
      "Most of the gods rarely get new markings after they've been settled in their roles.",
      "Why would the tattoo only show up now?",
      "For several weeks, Ares can be seen sneaking away from Hestia's Hearth carrying armloads of the snacks away - meat, mostly, Hermes observes, but also eggs and honey and really it's the quantity that's odd.",
      "He mentions it off-handedly to Athena, there goes Ares with some snacks I guess, wonder why?",
      "Her only response is to sniff and say they should all be grateful to be spared his appalling table manners.",
      "At a routine and boring council, Demeter mentions that she received Ares' request for more increased grain to be delivered to his stables.",
      "Hermes' curiosity is starting to drive him mad, especially since Ares is normally so bad at keeping secrets.",
      "Discretion is not his specialty.",
      "And teasing him - which, when used as a form of interrogation, is normally a foregone conclusion - is only getting tight-lipped scowls in response.",
      "Hermes asks Aphrodite.",
      "Often, if Ares is out of sorts, it's because Aphrodite has taken another new lover.",
      "But Aphrodite only shakes her head.",
      "\"I'm taking some time off from looking afield for new lovers.",
      "Actually, Ares and I were together just the other day...\" she trails off, looking reflectively into the distance.",
      "\"...He may not be much for pretty speech, but he has a silver tongue nonetheless, let me tell you.\"",
      "Hermes laughs and groans at the same time.",
      "\"Well, great!",
      "Good to know he's not a one-trick pony.\"",
      "She smirks at him; they routinely swap dirty and embarrassing stories about Ares, both to give each other ammunition to tease him and more things to endear him to them.",
      "\"More of a stallion than a pony, but yes, the other night was at least three or four tricks in the first hour alone.\"",
      "\"That stud.",
      "Such passion.",
      "Does he start crying in the heat of the moment?\"",
      "\"No, no tears, but he curses...",

      "First of all, if you haven't had a new marking in a while, it's apparently pretty sensitive skin there, and as it happens, the flame markings go all the way down to -\" Aphrodite goes on, explaining, while they both crack up laughing, and yeah, Hermes is absolutely gonna make a note of this information.",
      "Later, he's back on the case.",
      "He asks Helios, the \"eye in the sky\" who sees everything his sun touches.",
      "Helios' response is perhaps not unexpected: \"Fuck you, you little pot-stirring shit, I'm not getting involved in that guy's crap ever again.\"",
      "\"Aww, come on, Helios, everyone got over it eventually...\" \"Nope.",

      "\"You can ask Selene, maybe.",
      "She sees everything her moon touches.\"",
      "Helios sometimes enjoys referring the younger gods to his sister - although she has been faithful to her beloved Endymion, she does like to work up her appetite by winding up her visitors.",
      "The three Titans find it very entertaining to set off the younger gods, to say nothing of the mortals.",
      "Hermes does visit Selene, but only because he knows that the insatiable goddess has recently been to visit Endymion, so Hermes' balls should be safe this time.",
      "\"Ahh, yes, Ares and his nighttime excursions.",
      "Many evenings of entertainment to be seen there.\"",
      "Hermes amuses himself by imagining Ares' reaction to the small, knowing smile on Selene's pretty face, if he could see it.",
      "Hermes bows respectfully.",
      "\"I'm certain of that.",
      "Ares' daylight excursions are quite entertaining as well.",
      "I'll never understand why most of Olympus doesn't see it.\"",
      "\"Well, I do have the advantage of watching the show from far above... miles away from his notorious rages.",
      "And you have the advantage of never being troubled by anything, ever.\"",
      "That's not true by a long shot, but Hermes doesn't show his cards as swiftly as the other gods.",
      "\"I just think he's funny.\"",
      "Selene nods thoughtfully.",
      "\"To answer your question, little herald, your amusing friend has spent more time than usual at his stronghold on Thrace.",
      "Not outdoors, where I can see him, but he rushes from one closed building to the next.\"",
      "Thrace's war palace is one of only two temples dedicated to Ares in all of Greece.",
      "Its people are warlike and considered savage and unpleasant by the majority of the gods, so they do not often visit if they don't absolutely have to.",
      "Hermes visits there the next day and scouts around.",
      "He spots Demeter's grain... piled around messily by a barred stone building behind the main temple where Ares resides when he's there.",
      "Some of it has spilled out onto the ground; the mice must be loving that.",
      "The roar of Ares' flaming steeds, approaching from the sky in the distance, interrupts Hermes from picking the lock to get in, but not before he could hear some very mysterious animal sounds from within.",
      "He fully plans to go back, but he needs a way to keep Ares occupied.",
      "Artemis, perhaps, she can keep him busy with sparring.",
      "So Hermes goes to Apollo, currently the only one who knows the location of Artemis' secret grove.",
      "Well, actually, Hermes does know - it's part of his job to know, in case Zeus needs to deliver a message to her, or summon her directly.",
      "But for as long as that hasn't happened yet, Hermes would rather let her have her secret grove and go through Apollo when he wishes to speak to her.",
      "Apollo is seated on a bench in his courtyard.",
      "Apollo's halls are, as one might expect, incredibly tasteful and elegant.",
      "He generally keeps musicians and beautiful objects (or people) around more or less perpetually for the ambiance.",

      "Afterwards, when they've had their fun and Apollo has finally sent him on his way, Hermes takes a moment to drink in the irony of Apollo's previous statement, about how his path doesn't intersect with Ares, before he speeds off through the air in the direction of Ares, who is currently still making his way down the side of the mountain with one of Apollo's cows tied to his back.",
      "Neither Ares nor the cow looks happy about their situation.",
      "\"I guess this counts as you not crossing paths with Apollo, right?",
      "What he don't know, won't hurt him?\"",
      "He taps his chin thoughtfully, watching the struggle down the mountainside.",
      "\"That's good sense, only stealing one cow.",
      "I overreached, stealing the whole herd.",
      "That's how I got caught.",
      "You'll probably be fine, though.\"",
      "Ares' scowl is practically weaponized.",
      "Hermes wonders if the red on the god's face is a warning sign of rage or a cute little blush - hard to tell, with Ares.",
      "\"You were really gonna do that, right in fucking front of me.",
      "While I was standing right there, you were gonna deep-throat him.\"",
      "\"We did a swap, actually,\" Hermes says brightly.",
      "\"And all as a favor to you!",
      "Here you are, almost escaped, and no one the wiser that Apollo's got one less cow than he had a half hour ago.\"",
      "\"You better not tell anyone-!\"",
      "Ares starts to growl, but Hermes cuts him off by placing his hands on Ares' cheeks, squishing them together to make a funny fish face.",
      "\"Obviously I'm not gonna tell anyone, dumbass.",
      "But seriously.",
      "Whatever you're doing, you're gonna get caught soon if you're not careful.",
      "Why don't you let me help out?",
      "I'm much better at sneaky shit than you are.\"",
      "It's testament to how the past few months have been straining at Ares that he doesn't immediately bat Hermes' hands away.",
      "He stares at Hermes for what must be a full ten seconds in silence, fish-faced, before pulling back and looking away.",
      "\"I don't - this isn't your concern - \" he forces out, and Hermes puts out his tongue to make a rude noise at him.",
      "\"C'mon, dipshit!",
      "We're buddies!",
      "When have I let you down before?\" Ares drags his eyes back to Hermes, briefly pausing to thump the cow on the flank as it moos in annoyance.",
      "\"I could get in trouble for this.",
      "I'm not sure but it's a possibility.",
      "Like, real trouble, maybe.",
      "And you'd get in trouble too, and it won't be as cute as the other times because you'd be associated with me.\"",
      "Hermes hates that this is true.",
      "Ares speaks plainly and flatly, no matter how bad the situation.",
      "His inability to sugarcoat when he talks has bolstered his reputation for cruelty, but there's nothing worse than when he turns that truth on himself and bears it without flinching.",
      "But Hermes is confident in his own abilities.",
      "Ares might fear that associating with the war god will make a situation worse; but Hermes believes that this whole situation being associated with the charming messenger god will make it easier on Ares.",
      "If they even get caught.",
      "Hermes Dolios knows what he's doing.",
      "So he kisses the tips of his first and second fingers, presses them to Ares' nose, and beams at him.",
      "\"I don't give a shit.",
      "Let's do this!\"",
      "And he flips up through the air, over Ares' head, to land on the back of the cow on his shoulders.",
      "\"Alala!\"",
      "he cheers, using Ares' preferred battle-cry.",
      "Below him, Ares is still a moment longer, before the god finally begins to plod forward again.",
      "\"Wasn't even sure you were sitting up there.",
      "Skinny-ass, you barely weigh anything,\" he mutters.",
      "Their conversation for the rest of the journey to Thrace is much more of a return to how it used to be: Hermes tells jokes and stories and sings songs with ridiculous or lewd lyrics, and laughs at the grouchy curses he receives in return.",
      "He's delighted when Ares actually stumbles, laughing in spite of himself, at a particularly well-timed punchline about Athena's musical talents.",
      "Behind the temple in Thrace, Ares ties the cow to stake.",
      "Hermes nimbly seats himself atop Ares' shoulders directly now, and notes how tense they are.",
      "The guy needs a good massage immediately.",
      "They go to the stable door and Ares unlocks it, but hesitates before opening it.",
      "The mysterious noises are louder now, and the grain is still strewn about randomly.",
      "Hermes is dying to see what's inside, but it seems like Ares has one final admonition for him.",
      "\"You have got to keep your mouth shut about this.",
      "Especially to your stupid boyfriend Apollo.",
      "That pretty asshole is gonna-\" \"You've totally got a crush on him, don't you?\" Hermes inquires innocently, just to see Ares blink, mouth opening and then snapping shut, too bewildered to even get angry or embarrassed.",
      "Hermes takes advantage of his indecisiveness to jump off Ares' shoulders and shove his way past him, through the door, ignoring Ares' attempted grab.",
      "\"Speaking of Apollo, enough with the lectures!",
      "I'm on the team already!",
      "What chthonic mystery are you keeping - oh!\"",
      "Whatever he was expecting, Hermes somehow both is, and is not surprised at all, to see the secret revealed: Two dragons, about four feet long, are currently climbing about on the support posts and ceiling beams of the stable's interior, and both make excited squawking noises when they see Ares.",
      "Moving quickly, they make their way down as Ares rushes inside and shuts the door swiftly behind him.",
      "The dragons are objectively beautiful creatures, in spite of the clear promise of what terrible beings they will be in the future.",
      "Their bodies are long and sinuous, with tiny useless-looking limbs (six of them) that resemble a bird's talons.",
      "Their scales shimmer and color seems to ripple through them, though always in shades of green.",
      "One appears to have golden highlights; the other has silver.",
      "Upon their backs are tiny little glowing spikes that run down the length of their spines.",
      "The buds of their wings are forming, three sets placed at each set of shoulders, and their heads resemble nothing so much as a wolf.",
      "Their teeth and claws, tiny though they are, definitely appear sharp - this is confirmed when they start climbing up Ares, leaving scratches and nicks as they nip at him affectionately.",
      "\"Found 'em near Mount Parnassus.",
      "Dunno if they're the offspring of Python or not - they seem too young,\" Ares says, watching Hermes uneasily, ignoring the way the dragons are leaving claw marks on his skin.",
      "Hermes is actually rendered speechless, hands covering his mouth, eyes shining as he watches the dragons start chewing on Ares' tunic, making excited, rapid tuck-tuck-tuck noises, interspersed with mild hissing at each other.",
      "They adore him, just like loyal hounds, and the ease and familiarity they display as they clamber over Ares tells Hermes that this has been going on for a while.",
      "\"Oh, by Hyperion's glorious balls,\" he manages, delight coursing through his voice.",
      "\"Oh, this is - this is the cutest fucking thing I've ever seen in my life -!\"",
      "Ares' face twists back into a scowl with something like relief.",
      "\"Look, don't be an asshole, this is serious!\"",
      "\"Will you shut up?!",
      "Quit being such a sulk!",
      "This is fantastic!",
      "You have little tiny baby dragons and they luuuuuurve yoooouuuu!!!\"",
      "\"You're such a -\" \"Can I pet them?",
      "Will they burn me?\" \"Eh?",
      "Uh",
      ",",
      "yeah, probably...\" Ares' face flickers between annoyance and confusion, and some other emotion that doesn't look at home on his face.",
      "\"I'll wait till they're used to me,\" Hermes watches in fascination as one of the dragons stretches its neck and snaps up a mouse that had been feeding on the loose grain scattered about the place.",
      "Aha, that's why all the grain!",
      "\"Used to you...?\"",
      "\"Yeah!",
      "I'll come by a couple times a week, and I'll bring little treats to get on their good side - I bet it's just the same as Arty's hunting dogs!",
      "And maybe we can sneak them out somewhere - hmm.",
      "Where was Dionysus born again?",
      "That's a pretty isolated place.\"",
      "Hermes keeps talking without pause, and without acknowledging the awkward noises Ares is making and the way his fists clench and unclench as the dragons wrap themselves around him happily and gnaw his ears, thrumming softly.",
      "They have an advantage over their master, then - Ares still has no idea what to do with happiness, or gratitude, or any other positive emotion.",
      "Before the night is over, Hermes has stolen about two months' worth of supplies, and gets caught with none of them - not even by Selene, who raises his eyebrows at him as he sneaks a sack into the stables in Thrace.",
      "He winks at her and flashes a pair of Apollo's sandals which he stole solely to allay suspicion.",
      "And yeah, a distant part of his mind can see this being a problem down the road, but right at this moment... watching the confused, scowly happiness in Ares' face...",
      "the unspeakably adorable way the he loves those dragons, and they adore him...",
      "Hermes generally thinks any mischief is worth the trouble he might get in, but he thinks he'd happily risk Zeus and Hera's wrath both for this."

    "text": "When Ares comes back, Olympus is so unchanged that it's jarring. The routine here is identical to how he remembered it, a year ago. Here's Athena, surrounded by scrolls in her library. Here's Apollo, playing his lyre and looking perfect. Helios and Selene make their daily and nightly sojourns across the sky. It's as though nothing has changed. And for them, nothing has changed. The only person for whom anything different happened, was Ares himself. There's not really any talk of what happened. No one brings it up. He can't tell if they feel bad about it, or if they all genuinely don't think much about the fact that he had been locked in a tiny, cramped jar for a year, a jar with the lid tied down, only to be lifted long enough that his captors can prod him with sticks or blades, or throw in rotting food or sometimes insects. The smell makes him vomit, and that stays in with him too. His angry shouts turn to screams turn to weeping and all of it stays inside the jar with him. When the clay jar shatters, and Ares blinks in the sudden light to see Hermes staring at him in horror, he doesn't feel relief, or feel any way at all, really. He feels dull and nonresponsive, because he's had this hallucination before. Though, admittedly, it hasn't ever been Hermes who had come in previous hallucinations. It's been mostly Zeus. It isn't until almost an hour later, when Hermes and Artemis are trudging back, carrying his wasted body because he can't walk yet, that it strikes Ares that this is probably real this time. He can't stop shaking. The rest of the Olympians' indifference is so at odds with his experience that it leaves him disoriented. Did any of it really happen? Did he imagine the whole thing? Is it really possible that his own father, upon seeing his son returned after a year of imprisonment, would only thank Hermes and Artemis for their service in destroying the giants, and in retrieving Ares, like he had only been off fooling around for a year? He isn't even angry or upset, not right away, just confused. Maybe they don't realize. Maybe they only knew that the giants had captured him. Ares himself is intimately aware of what happened but the rest would only know what Hermes chose to tell them. But really, does it even matter? Ares is free. He's out, he's back. No more jars, no more giants. He probably wouldn't even know how to react if Olympus treated him differently. It's probably better this way anyway, for him to get back into the swing of things. The first two days of his return, he mostly just stays near his own quarters. He doesn't really talk to anyone and they return the favor - with the exception of Hermes, who comes by a handful of times. Ares snarls through the closed door that Hermes can go eat shit, and has no idea why he's so hostile to the one person who cared. On the third day, he finally emerges, and his short fuse is noticeably shorter than it ever was before. The sight of everyone carrying on with their business infuriates him, and the slow pace of ordinary business makes him feel frantically restless. Demeter approaches him at one point, with some question of something stupid that he doesn't care about and can't focus on, and she's carrying a jar in her hands. It's a small jar holding grain, not a person-sized prison, but Ares feels his brain go red and he snaps, bellowing at her that he doesn't fucking care, and punches a column with his fist, breaking off a large chunk of marble, as he flees outside. -------- He doesn't go back the next day, or the next. He runs, as far as he can - only fifty miles or so; he's pathetically weak and out of condition after his year imprisoned. When he stops running, he takes a mortal form and goes to the low part of Athens, where the drunks and criminals tend to gather, and starts a fight with several of them. He only doesn't kill the mortals present because he unexpectedly spots Hermes out of the corner of his eye, watching him, and Ares doesn't know how to interpret the god's unprecedentedly serious expression. He takes off again, out to the wilderness, running until his lungs burn, and fights there instead. Ares punches down. He goes for cocky river gods and idiot satyrs and doesn't feel bad about how easy it is to win. He needs a few easy victories, and he's not likely to feel excited about punching over his weight for a while. Just the way it always has before, fighting clears Ares' head and heart. He gives over his conscious thought and simply acts. Loses himself in the moment, feeling nothing but the need to fight, the purity of having an opponent and pummeling him. And even the cuts and bruises he gets in return make him feel alive, they spur him on to fight harder and faster. Because a few intrusive thoughts are starting to turn up. Ares thinks, I am the firstborn legitimate son of the king of the gods and that still isn't enough reason for anyone to care that I was imprisoned and tortured for a year. Ares thinks, I've been getting replaced in bits and pieces for years - Hephaestus and Athena and Apollo and even Hermes, it's time to face facts. And Ares imagines a scene that must have played out during that year, where any god happens to remark that Ares hasn't been seen in months, and isn't it so much more peaceful without him here to ruin the mood? I am unwanted here. Whenever these thoughts come up, he finds a new river god and beats the shit out of him, and accepts the blows he gets in return, and it's enough to drive the thoughts away for the moment. --------- A few days pass like this when Hermes arrives again. Ares is dozing fitfully beneath an oak, holding a mud-and-grass poultice to his side where he took a solid hit from an angry centaur. \"You know, we can always get more medicine from Apollo,\" comes a voice. Ares opens his eyes, sitting up, and immediately sees the source: Hermes is perched above him, hanging by one ankle upside-down from a tree limb like some giant blue spider. He's smiling, as he usually is, but it seems more subdued than usual. \"Don't need it. This'll go away on its own in a day,\" Ares lies. This particular hit was going to leave a mark for at least a week. \"Sure.\" Hermes shrugs, then flips off the branch and floats down till he's hovering a little to Ares' side. \"But you know, if you really don't like medicine... they say that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.\" Ares scowls. \"The fuck are you talking about, shithead?\" Hermes doesn't even bat an eye at the scowl, the snarl, or the insult. \"I mean, if you trained more and sucked less, you might not get as many punches or kicks or spears or whatever.\" \"Holy shit. I've lived long enough to be lectured by the original Twinkle Toes on how to train for hand-to-hand combat.\" \"Twinkle Toes!\" Hermes laughs aloud, looking genuinely entertained. Ares is having a hard time holding onto his anger. Bafflement is starting to take over. \"Okay, look, first of all, I invented wrestling, you know! I won't lecture Artemis or Apollo on shooting arrows, and I won't lecture you about using a spear. But I know my stuff when it comes to wrestling and I'm gonna tell you for free that you suck at it.\" \"I'm not trying to win the fucking Olympics here, you know!\" Ares seethes at him, getting to his feet with some effort - that centaur really kicked hard. Hermes ignores this and goes on. \"Second of all, me and Artemis have a regular sparring session thing that we do, and we need some new blood.\" \"'New blood?' Yeah, I'll pass, so you can fuck off now.\" Ares gives his most menacing glare, but Hermes only grins wider and drifts in closer. \"Mhmmm. Why don't you make me?\" he taunts with a wink, poking Ares in the belly. Ares jumps a little and feels his face going red. He's surprised by his reaction; but then again, it's been a long, long time since he was touched with anything like playful intent. So he covers up by snarling and launching himself at Hermes. \"All right, you little shit - \" but that's as far as he gets before he's abruptly whirling around, spinning through the air, and finding himself pressed flat onto the ground, both arms pinned by the skinny, nimble god perched on top of him and giggling like he's played the funniest joke. \"See? This is why you need to go to sparring with us! This is ridiculous, Ares, I'm half your size!\" Hermes still has one hand free, which he uses to poke at Ares' face, annoying him and making the stupid blush spread. \"You're the trickster god, you fucking cheated or something!\" \"Mmmmmmaybe! Or maybe I'm just that good. Point is, I won, and you're down there on the ground at my mercy.\" Hermes pretends to poke his finger up Ares' nostril. Ares growls and tries to throw him off, with no success. \"Fine! Fine, so you've got a decent move. One decent move.\" \"I can show you the rest of 'em,\" Hermes is leaning over now, breath ghosting over Ares' ear. \"Some of my greatest secret moves. Arty's got some good ones too. Maybe if you give us enough time, we can get you to a point where you're not embarrassing yourself like this. Or, I can keep bugging you until you give in, your choice!\" Ares slumps in defeat. \"You are the worst, most miserable little shit.\" \"Aww, I like you too, Ares,\" Hermes says brightly, patting his face and snatching his hand back when Ares attempts to bite him. \"Well, come on, then. Arty's waiting.\" He lifts off of Ares, who stands up reluctantly, rubbing his arms. \"Right now? You're doing this right now?\" \"We're doing this right now, yeah,\" Hermes corrects him happily. \"But don't worry! We'll go easy on you, since you're a beginner.\" Ares wants to throw something back at him but honestly, he just got his ass handed to him with pitiful ease, which makes it hard to take the high ground here. So he just mutters \"gonna really love smashing your face into the mud, Twinkle Toes,\" with as much defiance as he can manage before following after the messenger god as he flits through the air. If he's going to be honest with himself - and Ares is nearly always honest with himself - he would have to admit that he's been getting weary of doing the rounds with the same rowdy, savage drunks of Greece. He doubts that he'll go back to the sparring sessions, not after this one time; but it's something different, anyway. In the same vein of being honest with himself, he's a little uneasy about what it means that it's Hermes and Artemis. Obviously, it's significant that it's both of them. The ones who came to get him. He doesn't know what to expect, but if they start talking to him about his feelings, then Ares swears to himself that he'll kick 'em both in the teeth and run off - hole up in Thrace or even Egypt or further. It never happens. Ares is bracing himself the entire walk to the \"secret sparring grounds,\" expecting Hermes to bring up The Jar or how badly Ares has been re-integrating in Olympus; but Hermes only talks about how he and Artemis have been doing this for a while now, it had started as a coordinated effort to prank Apollo, catching off-guard with a tag-team maneuver (which was a major success, Hermes proclaims), and they'd worked so well together that they kept it up, and blah blah blah blah, the guy never shuts up. But he says not one word about Ares' situation, beyond occasionally referencing one of his \"pathetic, sad-sack fights.\" When they arrive, Artemis greets him with mild surprise - \"Hermes said he was going to ask, but I didn't think you'd come! At least, not without a fight...\" \"There was a tiny altercation, but Ares saw reason quickly after I kicked his butt,\" Hermes replies cheerfully. \"I'm guessing you cheated?\" Artemis smirks. Hermes pouts. \"Why does everyone think that? Is it so hard to believe I'm just good at what I do?\" \"Let's just say you have a reputation.\" Ares mostly just watches for a while. He's made himself tense with anticipation, but he feels it slowly ebbing away as Artemis and Hermes simply proceed to do exactly what they said they were doing - sparring with each other. Artemis has an interesting style - much more defensive. She tends to keep herself firmly in place, choosing to react effectively to whatever Hermes throws at her, rather than put her neck out unnecessarily. When she does choose to make the first move, therefore, it's unexpected and quick. Hermes is unpredictable. He darts about swiftly, hardly ever bothering to keep a defensive position, trusting his speed and flexibility to keep him out of harm's way. He excels in spotting the opening, the weakness, even if the window is only open for a second, and taking advantage. They don't just spar physically - the banter between them is constant and entertaining. Ares is a little envious of how easily they trade insults (and compliments, on occasion, when one of them does something particularly impressive). After a while, Artemis declares that she's tired of mopping the floor with Hermes (they've been fairly evenly matched, actually) and gestures for Ares to come out into the ring. Ares is nervous suddenly, because he doesn't know how they'd fight together when he was in prime condition, but at the moment he can already predict that it's going to be another floor-mopping victory for her. \"Hmph. I dunno. I know how Apollo is. If he finds out I've been beating his sister, he's going to lose his shit. Might even change facial expressions.\" Artemis smiles, unfooled, and cracks her neck while Hermes drags Ares out into the ring. \"Oh, that's not going to be a problem,\" she says. It's not. Apollo has nothing to fear for his sister's safety that day, not from Ares. She lands him on his ass every time. But they do show him some of their moves, as promised. Generally, when Ares had gone around fighting before, he had simply charged in like a bear, counting on his fury and pure power to drive him through the fight. Tactics were Athena's specialty, not his: Ares is a man of power and passion. Bloodlust, as others call it. His power's gone, for the moment, and though he knows he'll recover his strength eventually, it's exciting to see different methods of doing this. And they certainly seem like they work better. So it's to his own complete surprise that he finds himself returning, the next time Hermes comes to pester him. And he keeps returning. Before he realizes it, several weeks have passed, and he's even won a few times, and he hasn't been to fight satyrs or mortals in a while. He's getting a bit of confidence back, and the regular action keeps him from dwelling too much on what happened before, and good riddance. He's happy not thinking about it at all. He should have guessed that would come back to bite him in the ass eventually. The wall breaks one day about two months after he's returned, and six weeks after he started sparring. He's asked about a particular wrestling move that Hermes and Artemis have demonstrated, which is entirely new to him. \"Yeah, Dionysus learned it while he was wandering around in the southeast,\" Artemis says. \"We only picked it up from him about, what, nine months ago? No, only eight.\" \"About that long,\" Hermes agrees. \"So we haven't had it mastered for very long.... Hey? Ares?\" All at once, very abruptly and unexpectedly, the words hit Ares hard. He's pressed his hand to his forehead, as though that will stop the sudden vicious headache threatening. He can feel himself reeling slightly. \"Ares? What happened? Sit down or something,\" Artemis is saying, though Ares barely hears her. \"Eight months ago. I was only seven months in the jar then. Only halfway,\" he croaks, and water springs to his eyes. He has no idea why or how such an innocuous statement could bring it all back to him like this - hell, he'd seen and heard far more direct reminders of his imprisonment. He didn't even get like this when he saw the jars. But even as he thinks this, he realizes why 'eight months' is different. The jar was bad. But the knowledge was worse. \"No one came,\" he says, and his breath is short. \"They were mad because it had been half a year and they thought someone would ransom me by then. They - they said -\" He can't finish the thought because the pain is lodging in his throat. The Aloadai giants had said, wouldn't you guess it's our luck we captured the one no one wants; give it another year just in case, and then kick the jar off into the ravine and try again with another one. And Ares had known that no one would come, and they hadn't, and the days had stretched into eternity, and Aloadai occasionally kicked and rattled the jar around just for fun, just to hurt him, and then they'd go away and there was silence and Ares couldn't tell if the year had already passed and now he was at the bottom of the ravine, to stay there forgotten until he died. \"No one came, not for over a year,\" he rasps. His voice takes on pleading tones against his will. \"I thought I would be there forever. I thought - didn't anyone notice? No one gave a shit at all??\" Hermes and Artemis both look stricken. \"We didn't realize what happened,\" Artemis says softly. \"No one even looked! The giants said! No one - Zeus - didn't even realize I was - fuck. Fuck. I know I'm not fucking Athena, or Apollo or some other perfect shithead that everyone loves, but I thought that - I thought someone would still care if I was - fuck,\" he finishes desperately, and a few shameful tears are dripping off his eyelashes in spite of his furious attempts to blink them away, and it's while he's standing there shaking that he feels Hermes wrap his arms around his shoulders. \"No one knew you were there,\" Hermes says, sounding both fierce and heartbroken. \"We all thought you'd just gone off somewhere, to start a war in India or Egypt maybe. No one had any idea you had been captured, until Eriboea came and told me you'd been there a year. If I'd had any idea, any sooner, that would have been the day I went in to get you out. I swear it.\" Artemis has vanished, having the intuitive sense to leave them to it while she pretends to get water from a spring or something. Ares goes still, looking away. He doesn't know what to say and doesn't think he could force any words out anyway, so he focuses on just keeping himself still. Hermes speaks again, into the silence. \"I was almost sick when she told me. And when I saw you - after we got in, and I realized where you were and broke it - I've never felt worse about anything in my life.\" There are no witnesses but Ares still fights down any display of emotion. There's still one more hard question to ask. \"Did - did Zeus know you and Artemis came to get me.\" Did he send you. \"We didn't wait to be told.\" This both isn't, and is, an answer. It's devastating, but Ares guesses he always knew. Hermes rests his head on Ares' shoulder; it's the most intimate touch Ares can remember experiencing. \"I never told anyone about the jar. I figured it wasn't my place to tell them. Maybe I should have.\" \"No,\" Ares says, and is horrified by how weak his voice sounds. He clears his throat and starts again. \"No. They knew enough. They saw me, starved and bleeding and - and you and Artemis dragging me in. They got a pretty good idea and they could have asked. They don't need to know the rest.\" Hermes slumps a little bit. \"If you're sure...\" Hermes is the one who broke the jar. Hermes hauled him up onto his shoulders; carried him out, past the corpses of the giants that Artemis had helped slay. Hermes follows him when he goes out, Hermes invited him to go sparring in the first place. Hermes kept the jar a secret; he can keep this one too. \"I don't want to give them the chance,\" Ares says. \"This way, I'll never know for sure. I can imagine they would have felt differently if they knew. But if you tell them...\" he trails off, tries to shrug nonchalantly. Hermes sighs and quirks his lips into a mirthless smile. \"I get it. Sure, I'll keep it to myself. But, for the record...I'm sorry it happened. I hate that it happened. I'm just glad I could get you out.\" And that almost pushes Ares over the edge, throat closing up and eyes watering, but he turns away and gives Hermes a light shove, dislodging him. \"Yeah, me too. Thanks. And, it's fine, you know? I'm here, that's the main thing. I can live with it.\" ------------------ The sparring continues regularly. Hermes invites himself into wherever Ares happens to be and makes a nuisance of himself until Ares is ready to go. After a few months of this, Ares is much closer to his old self - physically, at least. He can hold his own in a fight and wins much more often. He can run indefinitely now, without getting winded after fifty miles. He weighs what he did before he was captured: a good solid frame packed with muscle. Mentally... recovery is slower there. He still doesn't like to look directly at a jar. He doesn't like enclosed spaces of any sort, and always keeps track of the exit if he does have to spend time in a room. In his capacity as a god, he silently takes on another domain - that of the prisoner of war. He will not tolerate the mistreatment of prisoners, and brings his full wrath on anyone who commits this sin. He does this regardless if he was technically on their side or not, which infuriates Zeus and Athena and practically everyone else. But Ares is resigned to their scorn and determined to do what matters to him. There are nights when he dreams that he is back in the jar. Or rather, that he had never left the jar in the first place: he was never rescued, and this whole time he imagined he was free was just a particularly vivid and detailed hallucination. The dream itself is vivid, filled with excruciating detail: he can almost feel the hateful clay walls, closing in on him, forcing him to curl over; he can smell his own sweat and bile; he can hear the laughter of the giants outside. Worse, he can hear the silence when they go away and he's left to himself and he knows he's trapped there forever, he will never escape, no one is coming for him. Waking from the nightmare brings him no relief. He can't immediately tell what's real, the jar or his room. He drags himself up, goes outside, and runs. It's good to remind himself that he can move. Usually, Hermes finds him pretty quickly, and drifts along behind him, making small talk by himself for miles and never seeming bothered when Ares doesn't answer back. When Ares stops running, Hermes offers a flask of spring water, never pausing in his stupid stories and jokes. After a while of this, when he's judged that Ares is settling down, Hermes throws in a few other playful gestures - chucking pebbles at his head; riding on his shoulders; zipping in for a quick kiss on the cheek because he knows it makes Ares redden; laughing and messing up his hair. He doesn't see Artemis as often - she's always been more reclusive in general, preferring to roam freely through her forests with her hunters rather than spending time on Olympus. Ares thinks she might be onto something there - she stays aloof when so many other gods are consumed by their jealousies, betrayals and infighting. But there are times when Hermes is not present, out on an errand for Zeus, when Ares has one of his nightmares. Ares gets outside and runs, and runs, and runs; but the burning in his lungs isn't enough to dismiss the lingering memories. He runs until he's at Artemis' Grove. He charges past some angrily protesting women, ignoring them, and draws up short when he sees Artemis, lounging against a tree and eating a peach and watching two of her girls do each other's hair. She stands up abruptly when she sees him. \"Arty - Artemis. I need - I request a sparring match,\" he manages to spit out, trying not to look as desperate as he feels. Artemis only nods. \"Sure. Let's go; this way.\" They spar, and Ares loses - he's too distracted. But it helps, being able to fight against something, and it helps to have someone around who knows. Between the two of them, it's bearable, and time passes more easily. ------ Three and a half thousand years later, Ares is in a bed. The gods don't always keep up with mortal inventions but he's glad that this one caught on; sleeping on a mattress is infinitely more pleasant than sleeping on a pallet on the floor. Ares' chambers are pretty sparse in every other way, but he does not skimp on the mattress (also, Aphrodite insists). It's easy to sleep too long in a bed - more than once, Ares has missed a council meeting because he's sacked out on his beloved pillow-top. They've stopped sending Hermes to get him, after the millionth time that Ares has indicated that he doesn't particularly give a damn what's decided in the meeting (honestly, it's a wonder he still has a throne there). So when Hermes arrives, throwing the door open noisily and flinging himself on top of Ares, he knows immediately that he hasn't slept through a council meeting this time, but rather a sparring session. Well, he arrives at that conclusion after a few busy seconds, actually. His first immediate reaction is to yell and swing a wild punch at the noisy person or creature that just burst in and shocked him awake. Hermes easily deflects the blow and uses the momentum to flip Ares partway around, pinning his legs and pressing Ares' face into the mattress in one fluid motion. \"And this, right here? This is exactly why you shouldn't sleep through a sparring session. It's been more than three millennia and I can still beat you almost without even trying!\" Ares slumps slightly as his brain finally catches up to the situation and recognizes Hermes. \"Pretty sure any asshole could win a fight if they attack when their opponent is sleeping, you noisy fuck!\" he snarls, but his voice has no bite in it. Secretly (though he'd die before admitting it), he feels moved to see proof, even all this time later, that Hermes is still checking up on him, and really isn't going to let Ares disappear again. Obviously he can never say this sort of thing out loud, so he just curses and struggles to get out of Hermes' hold. Hermes releases him from the pin and floats up into the air, giving Ares a light kick in the butt as he goes. \"Shouldn't have been sleeping anyway, idiot. You have someplace to be and now you're gonna be late. I'm going to go tell Artemis and we're gonna make you do two hundred pushups as punishment.\" Ares smirks and stands up. \"I'm gonna get there first and get Artemis to make you do em instead.\" \"When I get there first I'll tell her to make you do three hundred just for generally being a dumbass!\" \"I'll make you do twelve hundred just for having a face like the back end of a horse!\" Hermes laughs. \"Okay, cute. I can see you've learned a little bit about zippy insults from me over the years. But Ares, come on, you're challenging me, Hermes, Swiftest of all Gods - Aaack??!!\" Ares snags Hermes by one winged ankle and flings him backwards into the open closet, where the messenger god tumbles down to be buried in an avalanche of clothes. \"Wasn't the only thing I learned from you, pipsqueak.\" \"You cheater!!\" Hermes is trying to sound appalled through his laughter. \"Are you seriously - I am mortally offended! UNFAIR.\" \"Pfft. 'Fair' is where you get cotton candy,\" Ares retorts, and kicks the door shut behind him before taking off. By the time they make it to the sparring grounds, where Artemis is waiting, the two have tripped each other, shoved each other into mud, and otherwise spontaneously broken into tussles that leave them both looking ragged and panting for breath, about twenty minutes late. Artemis shakes her head in mock disgust. \"The funniest part is, I can't tell just from looking at you if you've been fighting storm giants, or making out with each other.\" \"If we'd been making out, you'd know because I'd have to carry Ares on my back due to him swooning,\" Hermes informs her, receiving an elbow to the ribs as a result. Artemis shrugs. \"Hey, I don't mind if you two do half the work for me in kicking your butts!\" She does kick their butts this time, for the most part. She's the clear first place champion. Apparently inspired by her remarks, Hermes cheats his way to second place by flirting shamelessly during his matches with Ares. Artemis catches one compromising moment on Hermes' camera, who promptly sets it as his phone background. They traditionally go for food after a sparring match - this time, it's curry, inspired by one of Hermes' winning wrestling moves that he learned in India. When the curry arrives at their table, it's served in a clay pot. Seeing the clay vessels, as always, makes Ares briefly remember. But this time he barely pauses before lifting the lid and helping himself, rolling his eyes as Artemis messes up the punchline of a joke and Hermes surreptitiously steals more than his share of Kashmiri naan.",

      "If he's going to be honest with himself - and Ares is nearly always honest with himself - he would have to admit that he's been getting weary of doing the rounds with the same rowdy, savage drunks of Greece.",
      "He doubts that he'll go back to the sparring sessions, not after this one time; but it's something different, anyway.",
      "In the same vein of being honest with himself, he's a little uneasy about what it means that it's Hermes and Artemis.",

      "He doesn't know what to expect, but if they start talking to him about his feelings, then Ares swears to himself that he'll kick 'em both in the teeth and run off - hole up in Thrace or even Egypt or further.",
      "It never happens.",
      "Ares is bracing himself the entire walk to the \"secret sparring grounds,\" expecting Hermes to bring up The Jar or how badly Ares has been re-integrating in Olympus; but Hermes only talks about how he and Artemis have been doing this for a while now, it had started as a coordinated effort to prank Apollo, catching off-guard with a tag-team maneuver (which was a major success, Hermes proclaims), and they'd worked so well together that they kept it up, and blah blah blah blah, the guy never shuts up.",
      "But he says not one word about Ares' situation, beyond occasionally referencing one of his \"pathetic, sad-sack fights.\"",
      "When they arrive, Artemis greets him with mild surprise - \"Hermes said he was going to ask, but I didn't think you'd come!",
      "At least, not without a fight...\" \"There was a tiny altercation, but Ares saw reason quickly after I kicked his butt,\" Hermes replies cheerfully.",

      "Ares mostly just watches for a while.",
      "He's made himself tense with anticipation, but he feels it slowly ebbing away as Artemis and Hermes simply proceed to do exactly what they said they were doing - sparring with each other.",
      "Artemis has an interesting style - much more defensive.",
      "She tends to keep herself firmly in place, choosing to react effectively to whatever Hermes throws at her, rather than put her neck out unnecessarily.",
      "When she does choose to make the first move, therefore, it's unexpected and quick.",
      "Hermes is unpredictable.",
      "He darts about swiftly, hardly ever bothering to keep a defensive position, trusting his speed and flexibility to keep him out of harm's way.",
      "He excels in spotting the opening, the weakness, even if the window is only open for a second, and taking advantage.",
      "They don't just spar physically - the banter between them is constant and entertaining.",
      "Ares is a little envious of how easily they trade insults (and compliments, on occasion, when one of them does something particularly impressive).",
      "After a while, Artemis declares that she's tired of mopping the floor with Hermes (they've been fairly evenly matched, actually) and gestures for Ares to come out into the ring.",
      "Ares is nervous suddenly, because he doesn't know how they'd fight together when he was in prime condition, but at the moment he can already predict that it's going to be another floor-mopping victory for her.",

      "It's not.",
      "Apollo has nothing to fear for his sister's safety that day, not from Ares.",
      "She lands him on his ass every time.",
      "But they do show him some of their moves, as promised.",
      "Generally, when Ares had gone around fighting before, he had simply charged in like a bear, counting on his fury and pure power to drive him through the fight.",
      "Tactics were Athena's specialty, not his: Ares is a man of power and passion.",
      "Bloodlust, as others call it.",
      "His power's gone, for the moment, and though he knows he'll recover his strength eventually, it's exciting to see different methods of doing this.",
      "And they certainly seem like they work better.",
      "So it's to his own complete surprise that he finds himself returning, the next time Hermes comes to pester him.",
      "And he keeps returning.",
      "Before he realizes it, several weeks have passed, and he's even won a few times, and he hasn't been to fight satyrs or mortals in a while.",
      "He's getting a bit of confidence back, and the regular action keeps him from dwelling too much on what happened before, and good riddance.",
      "He's happy not thinking about it at all.",
      "He should have guessed that would come back to bite him in the ass eventually.",
      "The wall breaks one day about two months after he's returned, and six weeks after he started sparring.",
      "He's asked about a particular wrestling move that Hermes and Artemis have demonstrated, which is entirely new to him.",
      "\"Yeah, Dionysus learned it while he was wandering around in the southeast,\" Artemis says.",
      "\"We only picked it up from him about, what, nine months ago?",
      "No, only eight.\"",
      "\"About that long,\" Hermes agrees.",
      "\"So we haven't had it mastered for very long.... Hey?",
      "Ares?\"",
      "All at once, very abruptly and unexpectedly, the words hit Ares hard.",
      "He's pressed his hand to his forehead, as though that will stop the sudden vicious headache threatening.",

      "Only halfway,\" he croaks, and water springs to his eyes.",
      "He has no idea why or how such an innocuous statement could bring it all back to him like this - hell, he'd seen and heard far more direct reminders of his imprisonment.",

      "And Ares had known that no one would come, and they hadn't, and the days had stretched into eternity, and Aloadai occasionally kicked and rattled the jar around just for fun, just to hurt him, and then they'd go away and there was silence and Ares couldn't tell if the year had already passed and now he was at the bottom of the ravine, to stay there forgotten until he died.",

      "Fuck.",
      "I know I'm not fucking Athena, or Apollo or some other perfect shithead that everyone loves, but I thought that - I thought someone would still care if I was - fuck,\" he finishes desperately, and a few shameful tears are dripping off his eyelashes in spite of his furious attempts to blink them away, and it's while he's standing there shaking that he feels Hermes wrap his arms around his shoulders.",
      "\"No one knew you were there,\" Hermes says, sounding both fierce and heartbroken.",
      "\"We all thought you'd just gone off somewhere, to start a war in India or Egypt maybe.",
      "No one had any idea you had been captured, until Eriboea came and told me you'd been there a year.",

      "And when I saw you - after we got in, and I realized where you were and broke it - I've never felt worse about anything in my life.\"",

      "Did he send you.",

      "But if you tell them...\" he trails off, tries to shrug nonchalantly.",
      "Hermes sighs and quirks his lips into a mirthless smile.",
      "\"I get it.",
      "Sure, I'll keep it to myself.",
      "But, for the record...I'm sorry it happened.",
      "I hate that it happened.",
      "I'm just glad I could get you out.\"",
      "And that almost pushes Ares over the edge, throat closing up and eyes watering, but he turns away and gives Hermes a light shove, dislodging him.",
      "\"Yeah, me too.",
      "Thanks.",
      "And, it's fine, you know?",
      "I'm here, that's the main thing.",
      "I can live with it.\"",
      "------------------ The sparring continues regularly.",
      "Hermes invites himself into wherever Ares happens to be and makes a nuisance of himself until Ares is ready to go.",
      "After a few months of this, Ares is much closer to his old self - physically, at least.",
      "He can hold his own in a fight and wins much more often.",
      "He can run indefinitely now, without getting winded after fifty miles.",
      "He weighs what he did before he was captured: a good solid frame packed with muscle.",
      "Mentally... recovery is slower there.",
      "He still doesn't like to look directly at a jar.",
      "He doesn't like enclosed spaces of any sort, and always keeps track of the exit if he does have to spend time in a room.",
      "In his capacity as a god, he silently takes on another domain - that of the prisoner of war.",
      "He will not tolerate the mistreatment of prisoners, and brings his full wrath on anyone who commits this sin.",
      "He does this regardless if he was technically on their side or not, which infuriates Zeus and Athena and practically everyone else.",
      "But Ares is resigned to their scorn and determined to do what matters to him.",
      "There are nights when he dreams that he is back in the jar.",
      "Or rather, that he had never left the jar in the first place: he was never rescued, and this whole time he imagined he was free was just a particularly vivid and detailed hallucination.",
      "The dream itself is vivid, filled with excruciating detail: he can almost feel the hateful clay walls, closing in on him, forcing him to curl over; he can smell his own sweat and bile; he can hear the laughter of the giants outside.",
      "Worse, he can hear the silence when they go away and he's left to himself and he knows he's trapped there forever, he will never escape, no one is coming for him.",
      "Waking from the nightmare brings him no relief.",
      "He can't immediately tell what's real, the jar or his room.",
      "He drags himself up, goes outside, and runs.",
      "It's good to remind himself that he can move.",
      "Usually, Hermes finds him pretty quickly, and drifts along behind him, making small talk by himself for miles and never seeming bothered when Ares doesn't answer back.",
      "When Ares stops running, Hermes offers a flask of spring water, never pausing in his stupid stories and jokes.",
      "After a while of this, when he's judged that Ares is settling down, Hermes throws in a few other playful gestures - chucking pebbles at his head; riding on his shoulders; zipping in for a quick kiss on the cheek because he knows it makes Ares redden; laughing and messing up his hair.",
      "He doesn't see Artemis as often - she's always been more reclusive in general, preferring to roam freely through her forests with her hunters rather than spending time on Olympus.",
      "Ares thinks she might be onto something there - she stays aloof when so many other gods are consumed by their jealousies, betrayals and infighting.",
      "But there are times when Hermes is not present, out on an errand for Zeus, when Ares has one of his nightmares.",
      "Ares gets outside and runs, and runs, and runs; but the burning in his lungs isn't enough to dismiss the lingering memories.",
      "He runs until he's at Artemis' Grove.",
      "He charges past some angrily protesting women, ignoring them, and draws up short when he sees Artemis, lounging against a tree and eating a peach and watching two of her girls do each other's hair.",
      "She stands up abruptly when she sees him.",
      "\"Arty - Artemis.",
      "I need - I request a sparring match,\" he manages to spit out, trying not to look as desperate as he feels.",
      "Artemis only nods.",
      "\"Sure.",
      "Let's go; this way.\"",
      "They spar, and Ares loses - he's too distracted.",
      "But it helps, being able to fight against something, and it helps to have someone around who knows.",
      "Between the two of them, it's bearable, and time passes more easily.",
      "------ Three and a half thousand years later, Ares is in a bed.",
      "The gods don't always keep up with mortal inventions but he's glad that this one caught on; sleeping on a mattress is infinitely more pleasant than sleeping on a pallet on the floor.",
      "Ares' chambers are pretty sparse in every other way, but he does not skimp on the mattress (also, Aphrodite insists).",
      "It's easy to sleep too long in a bed - more than once, Ares has missed a council meeting because he's sacked out on his beloved pillow-top.",
      "They've stopped sending Hermes to get him, after the millionth time that Ares has indicated that he doesn't particularly give a damn what's decided in the meeting (honestly, it's a wonder he still has a throne there).",
      "So when Hermes arrives, throwing the door open noisily and flinging himself on top of Ares, he knows immediately that he hasn't slept through a council meeting this time, but rather a sparring session.",
      "Well, he arrives at that conclusion after a few busy seconds, actually.",
      "His first immediate reaction is to yell and swing a wild punch at the noisy person or creature that just burst in and shocked him awake.",
      "Hermes easily deflects the blow and uses the momentum to flip Ares partway around, pinning his legs and pressing Ares' face into the mattress in one fluid motion.",
      "\"And this, right here?",
      "This is exactly why you shouldn't sleep through a sparring session.",
      "It's been more than three millennia and I can still beat you almost without even trying!\"",
      "Ares slumps slightly as his brain finally catches up to the situation and recognizes Hermes.",
      "\"Pretty sure any asshole could win a fight if they attack when their opponent is sleeping, you noisy fuck!\"",
      "he snarls, but his voice has no bite in it.",
      "Secretly (though he'd die before admitting it), he feels moved to see proof, even all this time later, that Hermes is still checking up on him, and really isn't going to let Ares disappear again.",
      "Obviously he can never say this sort of thing out loud, so he just curses and struggles to get out of Hermes' hold.",
      "Hermes releases him from the pin and floats up into the air, giving Ares a light kick in the butt as he goes.",
      "\"Shouldn't have been sleeping anyway, idiot.",
      "You have someplace to be and now you're gonna be late.",
      "I'm going to go tell Artemis and we're gonna make you do two hundred pushups as punishment.\"",
      "Ares smirks and stands up.",
      "\"I'm gonna get there first and get Artemis to make you do em instead.\"",
      "\"When I get there first I'll tell her to make you do three hundred just for generally being a dumbass!\"",
      "\"I'll make you do twelve hundred just for having a face like the back end of a horse!\"",
      "Hermes laughs.",
      "\"Okay, cute.",
      "I can see you've learned a little bit about zippy insults from me over the years.",
      "But Ares, come on, you're challenging me, Hermes, Swiftest of all Gods - Aaack??!!\"",
      "Ares snags Hermes by one winged ankle and flings him backwards into the open closet, where the messenger god tumbles down to be buried in an avalanche of clothes.",
      "\"Wasn't the only thing I learned from you, pipsqueak.\"",
      "\"You cheater!!\"",
      "Hermes is trying to sound appalled through his laughter.",
      "\"Are you seriously - I am mortally offended!",
      "UNFAIR.\"",
      "\"Pfft. 'Fair' is where you get cotton candy,\" Ares retorts, and kicks the door shut behind him before taking off.",
      "By the time they make it to the sparring grounds, where Artemis is waiting, the two have tripped each other, shoved each other into mud, and otherwise spontaneously broken into tussles that leave them both looking ragged and panting for breath, about twenty minutes late.",
      "Artemis shakes her head in mock disgust.",
      "\"The funniest part is, I can't tell just from looking at you if you've been fighting storm giants, or making out with each other.\"",
      "\"If we'd been making out, you'd know because I'd have to carry Ares on my back due to him swooning,\" Hermes informs her, receiving an elbow to the ribs as a result.",
      "Artemis shrugs.",
      "\"Hey, I don't mind if you two do half the work for me in kicking your butts!\"",
      "She does kick their butts this time, for the most part.",
      "She's the clear first place champion.",
      "Apparently inspired by her remarks, Hermes cheats his way to second place by flirting shamelessly during his matches with Ares.",
      "Artemis catches one compromising moment on Hermes' camera, who promptly sets it as his phone background.",
      "They traditionally go for food after a sparring match - this time, it's curry, inspired by one of Hermes' winning wrestling moves that he learned in India.",
      "When the curry arrives at their table, it's served in a clay pot.",
      "Seeing the clay vessels, as always, makes Ares briefly remember.",
      "But this time he barely pauses before lifting the lid and helping himself, rolling his eyes as Artemis messes up the punchline of a joke and Hermes surreptitiously steals more than his share of Kashmiri naan."

    "text": "The gods all have their domains. Zeus manages and directs intricate powerful weather systems around the world, which directly or indirectly influences the lives and livelihood of every mortal. Hephaestus and Athena split the tasks of craftsmanship and inventiveness, allowing mortals to change their world to (usually) try to make it better. Dionysus has a lot of plates in the air: he's the god of joy and parties, wine, nonstandard gender roles, madness.... Probably a few others. Hermes keeps busy too - he's in charge of commerce, travel, language, luck, athletes, herds and flocks; he's a guide of the dead and dabbles in work with Hypnos for sleeping humans, in addition to being the messenger god for all of Olympus. Oh, and he's the trickster god as well. And like any other god, Hermes takes pride in his work, and he puts a lot of effort into doing his job to the best of his ability. Even - especially - his cosmic responsibility to prank people. He complains about this once, at a council meeting. He puts a petition to Zeus himself; that the gods do not appreciate his work, and it makes him feel unappreciated and sad. Some use the opportunity to scoff at poor hard-working Hermes, calling him hurtful names like 'tricky little shit' or 'sneaky asshole'. The smarter ones glance around, warily, wondering if this, in fact, a set-up for another prank. They're correct, of course, and it takes them all an awfully long time to get the dish soap out of their hair and clothes. ------ Apollo was the first ever person he pranked and he still has fond memories of the day (of course, Hermes swore an oath before Zeus that he wouldn't mess with Apollo's cows anymore, and one doesn't break oaths sworn before Zeus. Never again will Apollo's cows have reason to fear Hermes). One could say (correctly) that Hermes was literally born as an expert in pranking people, as he demonstrated by out-witting circles around Apollo; and yet, there was a lot to be learned from the experience. Namely, that people will forgive you pretty much anything if you're cute and cheerful enough! But also, that if you want to stay friends with someone afterwards, the damage can't be permanent. The status quo needs to be restored. Apollo got his dumb cows back, in the end, and Hermes played it safe by restoring his ego back to its original state by gifting him the lyre, as Apollo had the finest voice. He keeps these truths in his heart even today: Hermes is universally loved, even though he's a mischievous little shit, and he values that. So, his pranks are mostly harmless, but still tailored to the recipient. As his best friend, Apollo has been on the receiving end of many tricks over the centuries, but he does have a recurring theme. A way that Apollo can wake up some mornings and know, instantly, that his dear friend Hermes has been thinking of him. And everyone in Olympus knows it, too, when Apollo storms into the halls looking for Hermes, and he's wearing a tunic printed with the words 'I <3 Hermes', or 'My Evil Twin is Cuter' or maybe just a fuzzy cow costume. He has little choice in the matter when Hermes has stolen all his clothes and left only his hilarious options behind. It had been a genuinely magical coincidence that, shortly after the fuzzy cow costume incident happened... the Pasiphae Incident happened. Apollo was furious, and unfortunately, no one in Olympus believed his protestations of innocence (though they did share in the jokes at Apollo's expense). The Moirae must have been laughing their asses off over that one. ----- The thing is, Hermes crafts pranks. He's an artisan, as he's often explained: he takes raw material (godly flaws and the surrounding environment), and shapes them until he has created a situation of beauty and awe. \"Tell me how that's any different from what you do!\" he's protested to an unimpressed Hephaestus and Athena. Athena's laughably easy to prank. She really should be the goddess of wisdom. Intelligence, unquestionably! She's brilliant! But she should be able to spot the telltale signs by now. He had spent a long time working on one in particular - crafting it, if you will - where, tapping into another skillset as the god of language, he began planting little snippets and clues of a heretofore 'lost' language, of an ancient nation of people and their gods from faraway lands. Athena ate it all up, excitedly bringing reference materials, cross-checking them, working far into the night, pencil scribbling furiously. She proudly presents her findings before Zeus' court at long last, having determined that she's translated an ancient poem, clearly dedicated to the culture's equivalent to Aphrodite, 'RIk,' and addressed to an unnamed lover. Everyone's curious to hear it; a romantic poem, read aloud by Athena? \"The lines read thus (ahem): 'Love is no stranger to the two of us. We are both familiar with the rules. I feel a full commitment is best, and you would not receive such an offer from any other suitor. I only wish to tell you how I feel about this; I must make you understand. I will never give up on you, I will never disappoint you, I will never go astray and leave you desolate...\" \"Oh, fuck,\" Apollo, god of poetry, is the first to figure it out. Athena has the privilege of being the first to succumb to this trap; but she isn't the last. ------------- None of the gods can afford to be purists, as far as their craft goes - they need to stay relevant. It's a bit of a chicken-versus-egg situation as far as whether they or the mortals are the ones pushing the envelope, but they're constantly doing it. Hermes has never needed modern technology to be a little shit - his reputation was cemented slightly before the dawn of humanity, and as he's happy to explain to anyone, he can make comic gold out of anything and nothing. And like anyone else, his horizons have been expanded by the new tools that have been created by gods and mortals. For example, a simple but effective move: inserting little musical buttons into the soles of Hades' sandals, making a musical tune play everywhere he walks. Hades, who absorbs new technology at a glacial pace, takes forever to figure it out. With Artemis, he manages to swipe her phone for ten minutes, unnoticed, and busily changes as many autocorrects and shortcuts to change to humorous phrases of Hermes' invention. She's surprised to find herself admitting to Apollo that he is the cuter twin; announcing embarrassing secrets to her nymphs in group chats (some that might even be true!); and finishing any sentence that includes the word 'Hermes' with 'handsome and clever scamp that I admire more than anyone else in the world; I wish I could be half as cool as he is.' The cell phone, specifically, is an amazing invention and was the thing that finally managed to help him to prank Dionysus. Dionysus had been a challenge for centuries, because how do you prank a guy for whom dignity means nothing? He'd used a whoopee cushion on him once; Dio had only laughed it off and was content to let the world think it was his own body that had produced the sound. Hermes had thought for sure he had a winning idea when he'd waited till Dio was passed out, then carefully moved him to the oddest place he can think of (backstage at a pizza restaurant that features animatronic singing animals); it doesn't really count if Dio routinely ends up in weirder places on his own. It's when he has access to cell phones that he finally realizes he needs to reverse the trope with Dionysus, and uses the god's phone to text a message to Persephone and Hades, 'owning up' to the musical sandals and offering to do one week of boring paperwork duty to make up for it, so they can go on a romantic trip. The sour face he receives from Dionysus when he realizes what he's been roped into is priceless. ------- Like any other craftsman, Hermes has a process in place for experiments - for trial sessions of certain complex pranks. Some don't need it; there's nothing very complicated about stealing Apollo's clothes and replacing the fabulous garments with something ridiculous. And sometimes, there's no use in experimenting. Only Athena would have dedicated that much time to researching a dead language, while also lacking any awareness of pop culture references; so for her prank to get off the ground, Hermes had to simply set it in place and hope it all went smoothly. But if anyone cared to ask, out of appreciation for his craft, Hermes could have told them that he often tests his ideas with care beforehand. Aphrodite once expressed exasperation and admiration at once for his prank of her - every mirror in her chambers (and a lot of other mirrors she might go to as back-up) had all been switched with trick mirrors. They warp her perfect form to look tall as a giant or tiny as an elf; some have been rigged to make her look as though she has a beard; others give the impression of satyr's horns. \"Every single mirror in my vicinity?! I really don't know how you do it,\" she says to Hermes later, in (mostly) good humor, as she's threatening to sic Ares on him if he doesn't fix her mirrors. \"But you have really perfected being a pain in the ass.\" Hermes bows low. \"You flatter me, madam. But of course, I've had a great deal of practice.\" \"Practice at being a pain in the ass? Yeah, I can see that.\" \"Well, yes, but specifically, I practiced switching mirrors and rigging them... you know nearly everything I try, I test it out first!\" \"You... test them out? All your tricks?\" \"On Ares, yeah.\" There's a moment where Aphrodite considers this - the whoopee cushions, the stupid clothes, the endless centuries of pranks involving glue and feathers and gross food. She gives Hermes a stern look; he raises both hands in self-defense. \"I make it up to him afterwards! C'mon, you know I do!\" She finally laughs, a sound like bells or a wind chime tinkling gently. \"I see. Poor Ares. Well, if he's the test dummy for all your tricks, then that's all the more motivation for him to kick your butt if you don't fix these mirrors for me!\" --------- 'Harmless' is the key. He has to keep people loving and trusting him; not only for the purpose of them continuing to fall for his tricks, but also for the simple fact that he loves his family and doesn't want to hurt them. They hurt themselves enough. When he pranks Hephaestus, therefore, he goes gentle. Hephaestus is a sensitive soul and has experienced at least as much rejection as his brother; though he's not as easy to cheer up again afterward. So when he turns his sights to Hephaestus, a little while after his dramatic return to Olympus, Hermes doesn't tamper with any equipment, and certainly doesn't play off of any of the crippled god's flaws. He only fills the entire forge with balls and balloons and plush animals, in the course of one busy night. The entire forge is filled with them, waist-deep (knee-deep for one of the cyclopes that assist him). Is Hephaestus inconvenienced? Certainly. But the look on his face is just surprise and then amusement as he wades through and tries to figure out what the hell to do with all of this. Hermes is pleased. See? He thinks at Hephaestus. I made it into your sanctuary, your personal space, and nothing terrible happened. You'll be fine, buddy. Not that this kindness is enough to compel him to offer to help clean up, of course. --------- He occasionally tries to be more efficient with his pranks, by getting more than one victim at once. He determines early on that these attempts will be limited, since he adamantly believes that pranks need to be personalized to be effective. But there are times when a twofer just feels right. Helios and Demeter are fairly good friends - agriculture and the sun tend to work together, and their friendship deepened after Helios supported Demeter when she was grieving the loss of her daughter. In these lighter times, they often razz each other about their snacking choices. Helios is a bit of a junk food addict; Demeter is one of the crunchy health food nuts. It's a simple matter to switch their snacks one day - all day long, he can hear Helios bitching in his chariot up above about \"This carrot and celery shit, c'mon, Demeter, I'm stuck up here for hours!!\" Meanwhile, Demeter is trying to choke down some kind of crispy, salty bastardization of her beloved corn and preparing one hell of a lecture to Helios for allowing this travesty to enter his body. It's so perfectly tailored to both of them, that it doesn't occur to either one that Hermes is behind it. Inspired by this success, he tries to hit higher. Every so often, Queen Hera goes on outings with her sister Demeter, and sometimes Hestia. Hermes waits for these occasions, when the Queen will be safely removed from Zeus' bed, before he gifts both Zeus and his companion Ganymede with a gift of sugar-free Haribo candies. Hermes has the sense not to be downwind of their chambers that evening, but he imagines that even upwind, he can hear the resulting chaos. Zeus tries to be angry with him the next day but he's still laughing about it so Hermes thinks he's safe. Ganymede also pretends to be mad until Hermes placates him with a real gift of his favorite honey chocolates; at which point Gany finally divulges the sordid and hilarious details of their adventures in gastrointestinal distress. ------------- Of course, many people have tried to strike back at Hermes over the years, but they lack his subtlety - Hermes can see them coming from miles away. He allows the occasional victory, if he thinks it's something his reputation can withstand, because he doesn't want to discourage them from trying. Only once, was he taken completely by surprise, and he hasn't ever been able to recover fully. He's sitting around out in the courtyard, actually minding his own business for once, fooling around with his lyre, when Poseidon approaches him. \"I'll give you credit, that was pretty good.\" At first, Hermes thinks the Lord of the Sea is referring to the pointless little melody he's been plucking out on his lyre, and grins winningly. \"Thank you, Lord Uncle; I take great pride in my skill!\" \"I'm sure you do,\" Poseidon says dryly. It's hard to read Poseidon's mood, but Hermes thinks he looks like he's feeling jovial today. \"And as far as your tricks go, it was a good one. I have no idea how you managed to get so many in there.\"...Huh? \"The ones inside the commode were particularly well-chosen. Droll and creepy all at once. So, credit where credit is due, and I applaud your efforts. But I expect them all to be gone by the end of the day. Prioritize the ones in the commode.\" He leaves without bothering to hear Hermes' reply. Hermes goes to Poseidon's palace without complaint; he has to see what the hell is going on. What he sees there is just as bewildering: Poseidon's palaces is covered in photos of Hermes. They're everywhere. Pictures of him coat the pillars, the ceilings, parts of the floor... in the commode, there are photos of him looking 'judgy' or pointing and laughing at the viewer. One huge photo is on the ceiling above Poseidon's bed: a picture of Hermes blowing a kiss. It's brilliant. It's perfect. But.... He had nothing to do with it. The mystery cuts him up for days. Who could have done this? Who could have set him up so flawlessly? He has no beginnings of a notion about who planned this out. He feels like he can rule out a few people - Ares has no guile; Athena's too mature; Ganymede's too kind... The main thing is, everyone has a motive, but everyone has an alibi, and no one could have sneaked all these photos to Poseidon's underwater palace and installed them without Poseidon noticing. He might have gone the rest of eternity never figuring it out, until one winter day when Demeter asks Hestia to say hello to Persephone for her. It's a common enough occurrence - Demeter still misses her daughter during those six months when she's away, and usually Hermes is the one to bring the little notes or handpacked lunches. But sometimes Hestia is asked, because... \"You,\" he hisses at Hestia when they're alone later. \"You have a hearth in every home.\" Her eyes crinkle warmly at him. \"I do, indeed. I take pride in it.\" \"Even in Poseidon's palace!\" She takes a languid sip of hot cocoa. \"Even there.\" \"You sneaked all those photos in and put them up! Even the ones in the commode!\" \"No giant is too mighty to topple,\" Hestia says, mildly. She's quoting Zeus' words as they'd faced Typhon at the end of the Gigantomachy. \"You... you set me up,\" he whispers. \"You played me! Me! Hermes the Trickster!\" She blows him a kiss; the exact pose of the photo above Poseidon's bed. \"And no one will ever believe you.\" Hermes can't decide if he should be outraged or impressed. His happy-go-lucky nature eventually leads him to have to admit that it was a stunning defeat. He accepts her consolation prize of a mug of hot cocoa and a pat on the head with a good-natured slump of his shoulders. He can't even prank her back; she's the sweet one, the pure one, no one can ever target her without the wrath of all Olympus descending upon him. Every so often thereafter, she blows him a kiss with a wink, which makes his eye twitch. Hestia... is the sneakiest shit of them all. And no one will ever believe it. ------- For a long time, only three individuals were off-limits. In Hestia's case, it was because Hermes had thought her too pure and sacred to prank. Now, even though she clearly fucking deserves it because she's the worst, he still can't touch her because everyone else thinks she's the sweetest. The other two are off-limits for the opposite reason: their wrath is fearsome. Eros is the only other one in Olympus who can possibly contest him in terms of Prankster King. By unspoken agreement, they don't target each other - the fallout from a war between them might be enough to topple Olympus. The other off-limits person is Queen Hera. Her temper is notorious, and unfortunately, she and Hermes got off on the wrong foot over Io and Argus. Things never improved much, for years, as Hermes served as her foil on the many occasions when Zeus required him to bail out one of his lovers or their illicit offspring. Hermes doesn't object to these tasks - he feels that Hera's wrath is misplaced and he'd rather see the mortals escape her. But it bothers him that this one relationship should be so imbalanced. There is no one else in Olympus with whom he has such chilly relations. And even later, when Zeus and Hera have finally worked out an accord on his playboy ways and her jealous reactions - Hermes is still stumped how he can make friends with her. He takes his chances, the best way he knows how. Once a year, Queen Hera goes back to Kanathos and becomes a maiden once again. Leading up to her 3000-year anniversary with Zeus, she decides to take a full week to refresh herself and consider ways to make their anniversary night special. In the same vein, Zeus is preparing as well - he is showing incredible restraint and declining to even have sex with Ganymede for that week leading up to her return. The other gods try to encourage his willpower by distracting him with card games and alcohol. It really is an impressive feat - for anyone, but especially those two. They may be the two most willful gods in existence and their marriage is often fraught. They could have left at any time - Hera certainly has grounds for divorce a thousand times over; and Zeus could leave by way of being king of the gods and not wanting to put up with the stress anymore. But in spite of their myriad flaws, they do truly love each other and have made their marriage work for a long time. Hermes decides to celebrate by gift-wrapping every single thing in her apartment within the palace. He has a week, which is barely enough time, but when she returns, she finds every chair, every brush, every book, every individual piece of jewelry gift-wrapped, every sheet upon the bed gift-wrapped. In deference to her position, the paper is peacock-printed, and every single item has a 'Happy Anniversary!' tag on it. It's a risk, and Hermes is prepared to defend himself with a speech about 'the spirit of celebration took me over!' when he's summoned to her chambers; but he's surprised to be greeted with a wide grin instead, as she surveys the damage. \"Hermes, you really are awful! I thought you'd never come after me! I always felt quite left out!\" she's saying, as she inspects a bowl of fruit with each individual grape gift-wrapped while still left on the vine. He hadn't realized he had so much influence - or that any god would actually look forward to his pranks. He guesses it must be the inclusion that matters. Looking at it that way, Hermes feels a little bad for leaving her out. He bows low. \"I was only waiting for the right opportunity, my Queen.\" She looks at him, eyes shining in a way he's not sure he's ever seen before. The week as a maiden has clearly lightened her heart. Hermes finds himself hoping she has fun tonight, with Zeus. \"It's certainly memorable, you little shit,\" she says, happily. -------- With all other barriers broken, and realizing at last the real value of his craft, Hermes promptly sets up Eros to be dumped with a bucket of sticky glitter. The retaliation and subsequent counter-retaliations are epic as expected, and are expected to last for centuries - though even his defeats by Eros' hand still don't sting like the humiliation of Hestia's strike. ----------- And so, when Apollo and Helios are fully entrenched in Icarus' life once again, and Hermes himself (as well as sundry other curious gods) begin inserting themselves in the mortal's day, it's with a sense of duty and pride that Hermes fills Icarus' showerhead with bright purple powdered juice mix. \"Welcome to the gang, kiddo,\" he thinks.",

      "There's a moment where Aphrodite considers this - the whoopee cushions, the stupid clothes, the endless centuries of pranks involving glue and feathers and gross food.",
      "She gives Hermes a stern look; he raises both hands in self-defense.",
      "\"I make it up to him afterwards!",
      "C'mon, you know I do!\"",
      "She finally laughs, a sound like bells or a wind chime tinkling gently.",
      "\"I see.",
      "Poor Ares.",
      "Well, if he's the test dummy for all your tricks, then that's all the more motivation for him to kick your butt if you don't fix these mirrors for me!\"",
      "--------- 'Harmless' is the key.",
      "He has to keep people loving and trusting him; not only for the purpose of them continuing to fall for his tricks, but also for the simple fact that he loves his family and doesn't want to hurt them.",
      "They hurt themselves enough.",
      "When he pranks Hephaestus, therefore, he goes gentle.",
      "Hephaestus is a sensitive soul and has experienced at least as much rejection as his brother; though he's not as easy to cheer up again afterward.",
      "So when he turns his sights to Hephaestus, a little while after his dramatic return to Olympus, Hermes doesn't tamper with any equipment, and certainly doesn't play off of any of the crippled god's flaws.",
      "He only fills the entire forge with balls and balloons and plush animals, in the course of one busy night.",
      "The entire forge is filled with them, waist-deep (knee-deep for one of the cyclopes that assist him).",
      "Is Hephaestus inconvenienced?",
      "Certainly.",
      "But the look on his face is just surprise and then amusement as he wades through and tries to figure out what the hell to do with all of this.",
      "Hermes is pleased.",
      "See?",
      "He thinks at Hephaestus.",
      "I made it into your sanctuary, your personal space, and nothing terrible happened.",
      "You'll be fine, buddy.",
      "Not that this kindness is enough to compel him to offer to help clean up, of course.",
      "---------",
      "He occasionally tries to be more efficient with his pranks, by getting more than one victim at once.",
      "He determines early on that these attempts will be limited, since he adamantly believes that pranks need to be personalized to be effective.",
      "But there are times when a twofer just feels right.",
      "Helios and Demeter are fairly good friends - agriculture and the sun tend to work together, and their friendship deepened after Helios supported Demeter when she was grieving the loss of her daughter.",
      "In these lighter times, they often razz each other about their snacking choices.",
      "Helios is a bit of a junk food addict; Demeter is one of the crunchy health food nuts.",
      "It's a simple matter to switch their snacks one day - all day long, he can hear Helios bitching in his chariot up above about \"This carrot and celery shit, c'mon, Demeter, I'm stuck up here for hours!!\"",
      "Meanwhile, Demeter is trying to choke down some kind of crispy, salty bastardization of her beloved corn and preparing one hell of a lecture to Helios for allowing this travesty to enter his body.",
      "It's so perfectly tailored to both of them, that it doesn't occur to either one that Hermes is behind it.",
      "Inspired by this success, he tries to hit higher.",
      "Every so often, Queen Hera goes on outings with her sister Demeter, and sometimes Hestia.",
      "Hermes waits for these occasions, when the Queen will be safely removed from Zeus' bed, before he gifts both Zeus and his companion Ganymede with a gift of sugar-free Haribo candies.",
      "Hermes has the sense not to be downwind of their chambers that evening, but he imagines that even upwind, he can hear the resulting chaos.",
      "Zeus tries to be angry with him the next day but he's still laughing about it so Hermes thinks he's safe.",
      "Ganymede also pretends to be mad until Hermes placates him with a real gift of his favorite honey chocolates; at which point Gany finally divulges the sordid and hilarious details of their adventures in gastrointestinal distress.",
      "------------- Of course, many people have tried to strike back at Hermes over the years, but they lack his subtlety - Hermes can see them coming from miles away.",
      "He allows the occasional victory, if he thinks it's something his reputation can withstand, because he doesn't want to discourage them from trying.",
      "Only once, was he taken completely by surprise, and he hasn't ever been able to recover fully.",
      "He's sitting around out in the courtyard, actually minding his own business for once, fooling around with his lyre, when Poseidon approaches him.",
      "\"I'll give you credit, that was pretty good.\"",
      "At first, Hermes thinks the Lord of the Sea is referring to the pointless little melody he's been plucking out on his lyre, and grins winningly.",
      "\"Thank you, Lord Uncle; I take great pride in my skill!\"",
      "\"I'm sure you do,\" Poseidon says dryly.",
      "It's hard to read Poseidon's mood, but Hermes thinks he looks like he's feeling jovial today.",
      "\"And as far as your tricks go, it was a good one.",
      "I have no idea how you managed to get so many in there.\"...Huh?",
      "\"The ones inside the commode were particularly well-chosen.",
      "Droll and creepy all at once.",
      "So, credit where credit is due, and I applaud your efforts.",
      "But I expect them all to be gone by the end of the day.",
      "Prioritize the ones in the commode.\"",
      "He leaves without bothering to hear Hermes' reply.",
      "Hermes goes to Poseidon's palace without complaint; he has to see what the hell is going on.",
      "What he sees there is just as bewildering: Poseidon's palaces is covered in photos of Hermes.",
      "They're everywhere.",
      "Pictures of him coat the pillars, the ceilings, parts of the floor... in the commode, there are photos of him looking 'judgy' or pointing and laughing at the viewer.",
      "One huge photo is on the ceiling above Poseidon's bed: a picture of Hermes blowing a kiss.",
      "It's brilliant.",
      "It's perfect.",
      "But....",
      "He had nothing to do with it.",
      "The mystery cuts him up for days.",
      "Who could have done this?",
      "Who could have set him up so flawlessly?",
      "He has no beginnings of a notion about who planned this out.",
      "He feels like he can rule out a few people - Ares has no guile; Athena's too mature; Ganymede's too kind...",
      "The main thing is, everyone has a motive, but everyone has an alibi, and no one could have sneaked all these photos to Poseidon's underwater palace and installed them without Poseidon noticing.",
      "He might have gone the rest of eternity never figuring it out, until one winter day when Demeter asks Hestia to say hello to Persephone for her.",
      "It's a common enough occurrence - Demeter still misses her daughter during those six months when she's away, and usually Hermes is the one to bring the little notes or handpacked lunches.",
      "But sometimes Hestia is asked, because...",
      "\"You,\" he hisses at Hestia when they're alone later.",
      "\"You have a hearth in every home.\"",
      "Her eyes crinkle warmly at him.",
      "\"I do, indeed.",
      "I take pride in it.\"",
      "\"Even in Poseidon's palace!\"",
      "She takes a languid sip of hot cocoa.",
      "\"Even there.\"",
      "\"You sneaked all those photos in and put them up!",
      "Even the ones in the commode!\"",
      "\"No giant is too mighty to topple,\" Hestia says, mildly.",
      "She's quoting Zeus' words as they'd faced Typhon at the end of the Gigantomachy.",
      "\"You... you set me up,\" he whispers.",
      "\"You played me! Me!",
      "Hermes the Trickster!\"",
      "She blows him a kiss; the exact pose of the photo above Poseidon's bed.",
      "\"And no one will ever believe you.\"",
      "Hermes can't decide if he should be outraged or impressed.",
      "His happy-go-lucky nature eventually leads him to have to admit that it was a stunning defeat.",
      "He accepts her consolation prize of a mug of hot cocoa and a pat on the head with a good-natured slump of his shoulders.",
      "He can't even prank her back; she's the sweet one, the pure one, no one can ever target her without the wrath of all Olympus descending upon him.",
      "Every so often thereafter, she blows him a kiss with a wink, which makes his eye twitch.",
      "Hestia... is the sneakiest shit of them all.",
      "And no one will ever believe it.",
      "------- For a long time, only three individuals were off-limits.",
      "In Hestia's case, it was because Hermes had thought her too pure and sacred to prank.",
      "Now, even though she clearly fucking deserves it because she's the worst, he still can't touch her because everyone else thinks she's the sweetest.",
      "The other two are off-limits for the opposite reason: their wrath is fearsome.",
      "Eros is the only other one in Olympus who can possibly contest him in terms of Prankster King.",
      "By unspoken agreement, they don't target each other - the fallout from a war between them might be enough to topple Olympus.",
      "The other off-limits person is Queen Hera.",
      "Her temper is notorious, and unfortunately, she and Hermes got off on the wrong foot over Io and Argus.",
      "Things never improved much, for years, as Hermes served as her foil on the many occasions when Zeus required him to bail out one of his lovers or their illicit offspring.",
      "Hermes doesn't object to these tasks - he feels that Hera's wrath is misplaced and he'd rather see the mortals escape her.",
      "But it bothers him that this one relationship should be so imbalanced.",
      "There is no one else in Olympus with whom he has such chilly relations.",
      "And even later, when Zeus and Hera have finally worked out an accord on his playboy ways and her jealous reactions - Hermes is still stumped how he can make friends with her.",
      "He takes his chances, the best way he knows how.",
      "Once a year, Queen Hera goes back to Kanathos and becomes a maiden once again.",
      "Leading up to her 3000-year anniversary with Zeus, she decides to take a full week to refresh herself and consider ways to make their anniversary night special.",
      "In the same vein, Zeus is preparing as well - he is showing incredible restraint and declining to even have sex with Ganymede for that week leading up to her return.",
      "The other gods try to encourage his willpower by distracting him with card games and alcohol.",
      "It really is an impressive feat - for anyone, but especially those two.",
      "They may be the two most willful gods in existence and their marriage is often fraught.",
      "They could have left at any time - Hera certainly has grounds for divorce a thousand times over; and Zeus could leave by way of being king of the gods and not wanting to put up with the stress anymore.",
      "But in spite of their myriad flaws, they do truly love each other and have made their marriage work for a long time.",
      "Hermes decides to celebrate by gift-wrapping every single thing in her apartment within the palace.",
      "He has a week, which is barely enough time, but when she returns, she finds every chair, every brush, every book, every individual piece of jewelry gift-wrapped, every sheet upon the bed gift-wrapped.",
      "In deference to her position, the paper is peacock-printed, and every single item has a 'Happy Anniversary!'",
      "tag on it.",
      "It's a risk, and Hermes is prepared to defend himself with a speech about 'the spirit of celebration took me over!'",
      "when he's summoned to her chambers; but he's surprised to be greeted with a wide grin instead, as she surveys the damage.",
      "\"Hermes, you really are awful!",
      "I thought you'd never come after me!",
      "I always felt quite left out!\"",
      "she's saying, as she inspects a bowl of fruit with each individual grape gift-wrapped while still left on the vine.",
      "He hadn't realized he had so much influence - or that any god would actually look forward to his pranks.",
      "He guesses it must be the inclusion that matters.",
      "Looking at it that way, Hermes feels a little bad for leaving her out.",
      "He bows low.",
      "\"I was only waiting for the right opportunity, my Queen.\"",
      "She looks at him, eyes shining in a way he's not sure he's ever seen before.",
      "The week as a maiden has clearly lightened her heart.",
      "Hermes finds himself hoping she has fun tonight, with Zeus.",
      "\"It's certainly memorable, you little shit,\" she says, happily.",
      "-------- With all other barriers broken, and realizing at last the real value of his craft, Hermes promptly sets up Eros to be dumped with a bucket of sticky glitter.",
      "The retaliation and subsequent counter-retaliations are epic as expected, and are expected to last for centuries - though even his defeats by Eros' hand still don't sting like the humiliation of Hestia's strike.",
      "----------- And so, when Apollo and Helios are fully entrenched in Icarus' life once again, and Hermes himself (as well as sundry other curious gods) begin inserting themselves in the mortal's day, it's with a sense of duty and pride that Hermes fills Icarus' showerhead with bright purple powdered juice mix.",
      "\"Welcome to the gang, kiddo,\" he thinks."

    "text": "Endymion is born and it's immediately evident that something is amiss. He cries, when he's born, as babies do - but his voice is strained and raspy and not really a voice at all. It's just air. Endymion is presented to his father, who hesitates. It's Aethlios' prerogative to leave the boy out to die, if he chooses. There's certainly justification for it. The infant Endymion makes no sounds, other than the raspy voiceless cries. He's clearly and unfortunately defective. And yet... the baby seems otherwise healthy. He feeds hungrily as a baby ought; all his limbs are well-formed; his eyes are clear. Aethlios has other sons. His inheritance and legacy is not tied up in Endymion. He allows the baby to live, to his wife Kalyke's delight. It's a bittersweet relief to see his decision bear out over the years: Endymion seems to be perfectly capable of taking care of himself. He's fairly athletic and has an exceptionally beautiful face. He turns the heads of every traveler that passes through the village. But he does not turn the head of any local girl or man, which is a sorrow. Endymion is cursed never to speak, and this does not make him a desirable husband. He tries - or at any rate, he did. As a child, he would strain and strain, turning red in the face as he tried to force sounds to come out. They never did. No words, no voice ever came to him. Only wheezing rasps and grunts. Eventually, he stopped trying. It's difficult to gauge how intelligent Endymion is. He's easily capable of following the simple directions given to him: bring this basket to your mother; wash the pots before we eat. But conversations with him are almost entirely one-sided, and limited at that. He was taught to read and write, and seems to be fairly adept at it, but the world is busy with its affairs, and it's not often that anyone has the time or inclination to sit beside him and have an entire written conversation. There isn't much he can do that doesn't involve some communication - he can't lead men, can't be a soldier, can't buy or sell wares. So it's off to the fields with him, to be a shepherd in the hills. It's an occupation with dignity enough, no overt insult to the boy. But it's a lonely life. Endymion is gone for weeks at a time, alone in the wilderness with his sheep and his dog and his pipes........and the moon overhead. ----------------------------------- Endymion understands everything that is said to him, around him, and - painfully - about him. This is the most tragic aspect of his disability; there is nothing whatsoever impairing his ability to comprehend the words thrown around casually by everyone else. And yet, because his throat does not respond to his urgent attempts to speak, he is treated as a simpleton, even by people who know him well enough to know better. He spends his days and nights in solitude in the fields. No company but the occasional off-road traveler, who tend to swiftly move on when they see the shepherd is a simpleton who can only gesture oddly in response to questions. The sheep aren't much in the way of company. They mostly ignore him, and don't provide much in the way of entertaining his sharp mind. His dog, Odigos, is beloved and loyal. He trains her to respond to whistles and gestures. She, alone of all the creatures that walk the earth, communicates with him in this way. While anyone else might think of her as an ordinary dog, of average intelligence for the species, to Endymion she is the single lifeline he has to communicating to the world. It's unsurprising, then, that his first story features her. ------------------------------- Selene is aware of the shepherd boy, in the distracted way she is aware of any person out beneath the moon at night. Like her brother Helios and her sister Eos, she can see all that fall under her allotted time in the sky. But there are many, many mortals on the earth, and quite a few of them are shepherds, so she doesn't immediately take much notice. She might not have noticed him at all, in fact, had he not offered up the most unusual prayer to her one night. It's barely even a prayer, or not in the manner she's accustomed to: he asks for nothing but an audience, and even that request is unwitting. Endymion is laying back one night, one hand absently patting his sleeping dog, and watching Selene, up in the sky. He begins to speak to her. Not speech, though, not exactly. It's all in his mind, for one thing; thoughts, carried up to her silently. And it's unorthodox in pattern as well. Although the boy understands verbal speech well enough, he has never had an ability or need to express himself this way, so his communication takes the form of mostly pictures... concepts, actions, with a few stray words attached, mostly as names. Bored and seeking a way to keep his mind occupied, Endymion is idly looking up at the moon and telling her a story: A dog, humble Odigos of the wheat-colored hair, is approached by a wolf! Scary, huge, matted gray fur, giant teeth! Wolves are enemies of dogs as everyone knows, though they might have been brothers once. Clash of two noble races of canine: wolves attack sheep, dogs drive wolves away. Odigos snarls, ready to fight this invader, but the wolf holds up a paw - wait, Odigos, listen to my plea! Wolves don't want to eat sheep. They only must because a fearsome dragon has taken over the wolves' forest. The dragon is enormous, the size of a barn - no, two barns next to each other! Glittery green-black-brown scales, nearly invisible in the dark forest, until two golden eyes open and by then it's too late to run away. It breathes fire enough to burn the forest if it chooses; it can eat a sheep or a wolf or even a boy in one gulp; its roar makes Gaia tremble. The wolves are weary from fighting such a beast. They need a new hero - a clever hero like Odigos to save them. I'll do it, Odigos barks, and runs straight to the dragon, fearlessly. It's obvious that Odigos, while utterly brave, cannot fight a monster like this terrible dragon. It's so enormous, it would surely give Zeus himself pause. So Odigos comes up with a clever plan. She rushes about, barking excitedly and chasing her tail to show how happy she is, and shouts about what delicious sheep there are in the land of TIpota!! Sheep the size of cows, cows the size of wagons! Such bounty of delicious animals, no wolf will ever go hungry again!! Naturally, the dragon wants sheep the size of cows, and cows the size of wagons! It goes at once to see this place - but of course, TIpota has nothing there. No sheep, no cows, nothing but rocks. The dragon is angry at being tricked and tries to go back - but clever Odigos, an excellent digger, has busily dug a trench all around TIpota, filled with water, cutting off the dragon's return. Clever Odigos, the wolves cry. Clever and brave! Savior of all wolves! We will make peace with dogs now! That first wolf that approached Odigos turns out to be the Prince of Wolves, and married Odigos, who is now a Princess. Lord Apollo himself, god of the wolves, blesses their marriage and places a constellation of a dog in the sky for all to see. Endymion barely makes it to the end of his story before he falls asleep. Not much of a prayer, truth be told. Selene is fairly certain he doesn't realize the story reached her - that any time a mortal directs their thoughts at a god, that god is capable of hearing. But whether or not he knows it, the prayer-story was addressed to Selene, and she finds it charming. She takes more notice of him, from then on - Endymion the silent shepherd, and his faithful, brave dog Odigos. ------------------------ She is not the only deity to notice him; but she is a member of a minority. He does not do enough grand deeds to catch the attention of a god like Zeus or Athena. Apollo almost certainly would have taken an interest if Endymion had directed his stories to the sun (assuming Apollo was there, rather than Helios); but for whatever reason, the boy only tells his tales at night. Same with Hermes, though he would have also delighted in such a novel form of communication. The stories are for her, and her alone. The other one to take an interest is Hermes' strange and wild son, Pan. Pan 'takes an interest' in practically anything that moves, but he does have a special fondness for shepherds, who willingly isolate themselves out in the wilderness. Pan has two methods of introducing himself, which are different depending on whether he's in one of the maenad mobs with Dionysus, versus when he's being polite. 'Polite,' for him, means announcing himself with a terrifying shriek. It's the other thing he's famous for - the panic-inducing scream, which sends terror through the stoutest heart and even frightened the mighty Typhon. He's learned by now that the gods are not the best targets for this joke - their godly tempers lead him to seek other victims - but he still thinks it's the most hilarious thing ever to watch the mortals freak the fuck out when they hear it. He spies Endymion, late one night, reclining against a tree as he watches the sky overhead. His dog is not immediately nearby, but has joined a cluster of sheep as they get a drink from a nearby spring. Pan sneaks up behind the shepherd, cloven hooves silent on summer grass, and unleashes his scream. The scream echoes through the hills, frightening birds from their trees and causing an alarmed stampede from the frantically baa'ing sheep. Endymion shoots straight vertical into the air, at least several feet, and lands with a thump on the ground, whirling around with wild eyes and mussed hair. Pan is rolling on the ground laughing - by Ouranos' mighty balls, it never gets old! The kid is making the funniest wide-eyed face, knife out, still not sure what the hell just happened... the sheep are still running around bleating in terrified outrage (and the panicked baas of a flock of sheep is very funny shit, second only to the noise a cat makes when it's startled). In the distance, the dog is barking, doubtless on its way back to ensure its master's safety. There's a bit of chaos, so it takes Pan a moment to realize that there is only one creature present who is not contributing to the cacophony. His giggles taper off and he looks quizzically over at the shepherd, who is breathing hard but not yelling at Pan as one might expect, or asking stupid questions about who Pan is and why he's there... and, Pan's pretty sure the shepherd never even yelled in his fright. The rustic god isn't particularly well known for being a genius - no one, Pan included, would compare him to Athena, for example - and yet, his father is clever Hermes, and the trickster god's children are nearly all cunning little rascals. Thus, Pan is more than capable of swiftly assembling the facts and arriving at a conclusion. \"Huh. You don't got a lot to say, do you?\" He's met with a strikingly unimpressed scowl and forbiddingly crossed arms as the shepherd regains his wits and realizes who he's dealing with. Pan laughs again, delightedly. \"Okay, scratch that, you do got a lot to say! And I'm lucky I can't hear it, is that right?\" The shepherd assumes a haughtier stance than a god might normally tolerate from a mortal, but Pan allows it - he doesn't stand on formality as much as the other gods, and the boy has to express himself somehow. Now he's letting Pan know his little joke was not funny. \"Oh, please. That was hysterical. You must have cleared two meters into the air!\" The dog arrives at this point, hackles raised and growling, though it trails off in confusion as it takes in the scene - nonthreatening stances from both Master and Intruder; some general air of mirth; a lack of overt concern from the shepherd. The boy makes a wheet-wheeeo whistle and flings an arm in the direction of the scattered sheep. The dog gives one more warning glare to Pan before running off as instructed. \"It's a good dog,\" Pan comments, not particularly caring about the dog but wanting to soothe the kid's ego somewhat. \"Got here pretty fast. How many commands did you teach it?\" It works; the shepherd looks pleased. He holds his hands up, both palms open, showing ten fingers - five times, then with three fingers held up. \"Fifty-three?\" That's pretty good, especially a young dog - but then again, they're both out here in the fields all day every day, with not much else to do. Pan suspects that a mute boy might be fonder of another non-verbal creature, more than an average shepherd. \"Well, look. You're right. It was so mean of me to play such a trick on you.\" The shepherd immediately looks suspicious, but Pan persists anyway. \"Let me make it up to you. I know all about you shepherds, out here, bored and lonesome, nothing but a smart dog and dumb sheep for company. We can pass the time, give you something to think about later... uh...\" An ominous storm cloud is rolling up across the sky, moving faster than a cloud normally might. It positions itself alongside the moon and a few lightning bolts flash threateningly across the cumulonimbus. The cunning son of Hermes knows a sign when he sees it. \"...Actually... let me take a rain check on that. Enjoy the rest of your night!\" He scarpers off to the cover of the trees, leaving behind the bewildered shepherd. \"Don't zap me, Zeus, he's all yours!\" A rumble like thunder rolls through the air. A mortal like that shepherd probably only hears the thunder; but the rustic god hears the voice behind it: Hey, it's not me this time, Pan; Selene told me to chase you off. Better luck next time, buddy. --------------------- Pan, unlike most of the rest of the gods, isn't one for holding grudges. What's the use of it? There's always a different pretty face to tumble in the grass; always a new party to crash; always another cup of wine to drink. So he's in fine spirits as he waits for Selene to set, as Eos skips through the sky and breaks the dawn. The moon's glow fades as the night ends, though her frown is nearly as luminous. \"So!\" He greets her cheerfully. \"Soooooooooo.\" \"Wipe that smug look off your face,\" she says, somehow managing to sound grumpy and elegant at the same time. \"Got a little thing for the silent shepherd, eh? Eh??\" \"You interrupted his prayers to me, you demented little pervert,\" she scolds, crossing her arms. Pan only grins cheekily at her. \"Oh, prayers? Is that what we're calling it? If you insist, O Graceful Lady of the Moon.\" A while ago, Selene had deigned to indulge him when he'd tried to win her over with his charming ways; they have an amiable relationship now as former lovers. She has more of a dirty mind than anyone would think, given her gentle appearance and reserved mannerisms; but as the Moon, she has witnessed any number of nocturnal intimacies and taken an interest in many of them. She and Pan have spoken frankly about them before. So he's surprised now, when she colors slightly, biting her lip and looking away. \"They are prayers. Mostly. He looks to me and tells me tales... only to me.\" He raises his eyebrows at her; she blushes deeper. \"You've just... been listening to him tell stories?\" \"They're special stories! He tells them only to me.\" \"You made Zeus chase me off for story-time? You haven't even made a move yet?\" \"Some of us prefer to savor the palate. Not gulp it down like a greedy pig!\" Selene tosses her head haughtily, but with a certain defeated air. \"Ohhh, Selene...!!\" \"Oh, shut up.\" \"You're in looooooove!\" \"Not that it's any of your business!\" \"Come here. Sit upon my knee and tell Uncle Pan all about it.\" \"Eww, Pan!\" She remains standing, but she's laughing. Everyone loves Pan. \"Look, it's just... he's... different.\" \"Mmmhmm?\" \"He doesn't use words. It's like he sends pictures to me, mental paintings that tell the story...\" \"Right?\" \"And, it makes me happy just listening to them.\" He coos theatrically. \"Awww, Selene!! I feel like I'm watching my little girl grow up!\" She scoffs. \"I'm considerably older than you, you rascal!\" \"Well, I'll stay out of your way... I expect Aphrodite or her kid are gonna be along soon enough, and too many chefs spoil the broth or whatever.\" \"Ugh.\" \"Just let me know when you do make your move, so I can come watch the show, okay?\" \"Get out of here, idiot!\" ------------------- Time passes. Endymion continues his nightly stories to the moon. They become more elaborate, more complex:...The Amazon warrior Alcippe, who must climb the ice mountains far to the north in order to rescue her true love - the nymph Karya, the chestnut dryad. Karya was held captive by one of the barbarians of the northern lands - the nymph could transform into a tree to escape him, but she has faith that her lover Alcippe will arrive at last, so she holds out. Alcippe manages to fight off the barbarian at last, only to be stabbed at the last minute by the cowardly kidnapper! She lies dying in her lover's arms, until - Karya feeds her a magical chestnut, splitting her immortality with the Amazon. With this gift, the two women survive and grow old together.... the greedy pirate, who seeks to obtain a magic ring, possessed by a wicked monster of the deep ocean. This ring gives the ability to breathe underwater. The pirate chases the beast for years, and along the way in his quest, he finds himself having to help others to proceed. He helps relocate the people of a fishing village from a flood; he rescues a prince stranded on an island with harpies; he builds a scarecrow big enough to scare off a giant terrorizing a kingdom. Over time he becomes a better person, and at last when he catches the sea-beast, it stops and gives him the ring, revealing himself to be the handsome son of Poseidon all along, who welcomes him down to the underwater kingdom....the lady archer who was an excellent shot even as a child. There is no target she cannot hit - any distance, moving or stationary, she can strike it. The only problem? She is too soft-hearted to hunt. She shot and killed a hind once and wept about it for hours afterwards, and vowed never to kill another living creature. In the course of time, Lady Artemis heard of the archer's skill and suggested they have a contest, and against all targets the archer excelled. Even the wild huntress goddess was impressed and offered her a place in her retinue. With a broken heart, the archer declined, because of her vow. But Lady Artemis would not hear otherwise, and took her to the forest anyway, there to shoot every stray snowflake or raindrop from the sky if it fell out of season. Some of the stories are retellings of things he's heard from others, but he's around other people so rarely, that his stories are usually unique to his imagination. And listening to them is what makes it truly unique - his disjointed and colorful scenes are connected with little of the exposition that one might get from a traditional storyteller. Selene simply receives a series of vivid moving images, and a certain context that comes from seeing them. She's never seen anything like it. Night after night, she begins her journey across the sky. Night after night, the shepherd directs his story-prayers to the Moon above. The imp Pan is right - she is falling in love with this odd boy. She isn't sure why she's hesitating to make herself known to him. He's old enough, and handsome. She's quite certain that he hasn't had any luck with the local ladies, all put off by his silence and the peculiar mannerisms he develops after months of solitude; so he might welcome her attentions. If nothing else, he'd surely welcome the company. And yet she hesitates. Selene seen the tragic endings of so many different god-mortal loves. The mortals so often get hurt - either physically, or emotionally. She doesn't think she could bear to see this sweet boy, with his hopeful and creative stories, become corrupted by bitterness, or jealousy. Better, perhaps, that she stays here in the sky, and lets him stay down there on the ground - they can remain in a kind of stasis as long as possible, where nothing changes, and every night is theirs to cherish. It isn't until she's approached by Hypnos that she comes to see how much further things have progressed than she realized.",

      "I know all about you shepherds, out here, bored and lonesome, nothing but a smart dog and dumb sheep for company.",
      "We can pass the time, give you something to think about later... uh...\" An ominous storm cloud is rolling up across the sky, moving faster than a cloud normally might.",
      "It positions itself alongside the moon and a few lightning bolts flash threateningly across the cumulonimbus.",
      "The cunning son of Hermes knows a sign when he sees it.",
      "\"...Actually... let me take a rain check on that.",
      "Enjoy the rest of your night!\"",
      "He scarpers off to the cover of the trees, leaving behind the bewildered shepherd.",
      "\"Don't zap me, Zeus, he's all yours!\"",
      "A rumble like thunder rolls through the air.",
      "A mortal like that shepherd probably only hears the thunder; but the rustic god hears the voice behind it: Hey, it's not me this time, Pan; Selene told me to chase you off.",
      "Better luck next time, buddy.",
      "--------------------- Pan, unlike most of the rest of the gods, isn't one for holding grudges.",
      "What's the use of it?",
      "There's always a different pretty face to tumble in the grass; always a new party to crash; always another cup of wine to drink.",
      "So he's in fine spirits as he waits for Selene to set, as Eos skips through the sky and breaks the dawn.",
      "The moon's glow fades as the night ends, though her frown is nearly as luminous.",
      "\"So!\"",
      "He greets her cheerfully.",
      "\"Soooooooooo.\"",
      "\"Wipe that smug look off your face,\" she says, somehow managing to sound grumpy and elegant at the same time.",
      "\"Got a little thing for the silent shepherd, eh?",
      "Eh??\"",
      "\"You interrupted his prayers to me, you demented little pervert,\" she scolds, crossing her arms.",
      "Pan only grins cheekily at her.",
      "\"Oh, prayers?",
      "Is that what we're calling it?",
      "If you insist, O Graceful Lady of the Moon.\"",
      "A while ago, Selene had deigned to indulge him when he'd tried to win her over with his charming ways; they have an amiable relationship now as former lovers.",
      "She has more of a dirty mind than anyone would think, given her gentle appearance and reserved mannerisms; but as the Moon, she has witnessed any number of nocturnal intimacies and taken an interest in many of them.",
      "She and Pan have spoken frankly about them before.",
      "So he's surprised now, when she colors slightly, biting her lip and looking away.",
      "\"They are prayers.",
      "Mostly.",
      "He looks to me and tells me tales... only to me.\"",
      "He raises his eyebrows at her; she blushes deeper.",

      "\"Not that it's any of your business!\"",

      "\"Eww, Pan!\"",
      "She remains standing, but she's laughing.",

      "\"Look, it's just... he's... different.\"",

      "\"He doesn't use words.",

      "\"And, it makes me happy just listening to them.\"",
      "He coos theatrically.",
      "\"Awww, Selene!!",
      "I feel like I'm watching my little girl grow up!\"",
      "She scoffs.",
      "\"I'm considerably older than you, you rascal!\"",
      "\"Well, I'll stay out of your way...",
      "I expect Aphrodite or her kid are gonna be along soon enough, and too many chefs spoil the broth or whatever.\"",
      "\"Ugh.\"",
      "\"Just let me know when you do make your move, so I can come watch the show, okay?\"",

      "They become more elaborate, more complex:...The Amazon warrior Alcippe, who must climb the ice mountains far to the north in order to rescue her true love - the nymph Karya, the chestnut dryad.",
      "Karya was held captive by one of the barbarians of the northern lands - the nymph could transform into a tree to escape him, but she has faith that her lover Alcippe will arrive at last, so she holds out.",
      "Alcippe manages to fight off the barbarian at last, only to be stabbed at the last minute by the cowardly kidnapper!",
      "She lies dying in her lover's arms, until - Karya feeds her a magical chestnut, splitting her immortality with the Amazon.",
      "With this gift, the two women survive and grow old together.... the greedy pirate, who seeks to obtain a magic ring, possessed by a wicked monster of the deep ocean.",
      "This ring gives the ability to breathe underwater.",
      "The pirate chases the beast for years, and along the way in his quest, he finds himself having to help others to proceed.",
      "He helps relocate the people of a fishing village from a flood; he rescues a prince stranded on an island with harpies; he builds a scarecrow big enough to scare off a giant terrorizing a kingdom.",
      "Over time he becomes a better person, and at last when he catches the sea-beast, it stops and gives him the ring, revealing himself to be the handsome son of Poseidon all along, who welcomes him down to the underwater kingdom....the lady archer who was an excellent shot even as a child.",
      "There is no target she cannot hit - any distance, moving or stationary, she can strike it.",
      "The only problem?",
      "She is too soft-hearted to hunt.",
      "She shot and killed a hind once and wept about it for hours afterwards, and vowed never to kill another living creature.",
      "In the course of time, Lady Artemis heard of the archer's skill and suggested they have a contest, and against all targets the archer excelled.",
      "Even the wild huntress goddess was impressed and offered her a place in her retinue.",
      "With a broken heart, the archer declined, because of her vow.",
      "But Lady Artemis would not hear otherwise, and took her to the forest anyway, there to shoot every stray snowflake or raindrop from the sky if it fell out of season.",
      "Some of the stories are retellings of things he's heard from others, but he's around other people so rarely, that his stories are usually unique to his imagination.",
      "And listening to them is what makes it truly unique - his disjointed and colorful scenes are connected with little of the exposition that one might get from a traditional storyteller.",
      "Selene simply receives a series of vivid moving images, and a certain context that comes from seeing them.",
      "She's never seen anything like it.",
      "Night after night, she begins her journey across the sky.",
      "Night after night, the shepherd directs his story-prayers to the Moon above.",
      "The imp Pan is right - she is falling in love with this odd boy.",
      "She isn't sure why she's hesitating to make herself known to him.",
      "He's old enough, and handsome.",
      "She's quite certain that he hasn't had any luck with the local ladies, all put off by his silence and the peculiar mannerisms he develops after months of solitude; so he might welcome her attentions.",
      "If nothing else, he'd surely welcome the company.",
      "And yet she hesitates.",
      "Selene seen the tragic endings of so many different god-mortal loves.",
      "The mortals so often get hurt - either physically, or emotionally.",
      "She doesn't think she could bear to see this sweet boy, with his hopeful and creative stories, become corrupted by bitterness, or jealousy.",
      "Better, perhaps, that she stays here in the sky, and lets him stay down there on the ground - they can remain in a kind of stasis as long as possible, where nothing changes, and every night is theirs to cherish.",
      "It isn't until she's approached by Hypnos that she comes to see how much further things have progressed than she realized."

    "text": "The figure isn't a giant, but he might be. He's tall, maybe as tall as the pine stands surrounding the little cove; and he must be twice as broad across as any normal man. He's smudged with ash from the forge, hiding his terrifying features - the Cyclops, come for them, just astheir mother warned them! Arges or Steropes or - The figure throws its head back and utters a bone-chilling, guttural howl to the heavens, before lumbering towards the girls, arms outstretched. The girls shriek, running towards the safety of their mother, stumbling with hands over their eyes so as not to see the terrible figure. \"GRAAAAAARGH!! I...EAT... NAUGHTY LITTLE GIRLS!!!!\" The Cyclops bellows, snatching at one and narrowly missing. She squeals and darts away, short legs pumping as fast as she can. The next one isn't so lucky. The Cyclops staggers after the cluster of little nymphs trying to escape him and nabs one. The little girl screeches as the giant arms grab for her and connect, lifting her off the ground, ignoring her wild kicks. \"AHAHA... THE NAUGHTIEST ONE OF ALL!\" he roars, and plunges his face down. The girl's shrieks rebound through the grove, although they quickly turn to laughter. Suddenly the illusion is shattered and it's just Hermes, smudged with ash and blowing into the girl's belly while she kicks at him. \"Are you sorry you disobeyed your mother now?\" he asks mischievously, grinning at her. She giggles, still wound up, and shoves at his face. He pretends to drop her and lets her scramble away while he roars again, turning to the wide-eyed nymphs nearby. \"MORE NAUGHTY CHILDREN!! I FEAST TONIGHT!!\" Even knowing he's Hermes, the thought of a terrifying Cyclops chasing them sends the young nymphs into a flurry of panic, and they dash off in all different directions. The Lady of the Ocean, Tethys, reclines nearby, in thecove. She isn't convinced this act will scare the good behavior into them, but she won't say no to letting Hermes babysit them for a moment. Let them burn off a little energy. Fifty misbehaving Okeanid nymphs can wear a mother's patience thin. ------------------------ It's a while before they notice that one of the nymphs is missing. Tethys briefly panics; butHermes, as the Herald-God, has the ability to pinpoint any person's location within moments (an ability granted because what if Zeus needed a message delivered to them?). He assures her that the girl is nearby and volunteers to retrieve her, since he was probably the one to scare her off. He pretends to look high and low, calling and calling - no answer. Whew, she must be scared!... or that's what he thinks until he \"finds\" her, at last, crouched under the tiny cave formed by a partially-uprooted tree. The little girl is sitting with her arms crossed over her chest and a serious scowl on her face. She's pissed. He hovers and lowers himself upside down over the edge of the little cave, his grinning face appearing to her. \"Hellooooooo... any idea where I can find a sweet little nymph around here? I've been looking and looking, but I can't seem to find her!\" \"Look somewhere else!\" she says, throwing a dirt clod at him that misses by a long shot. \"Are you Nephele? 'Little cloud?'\" he asks, pretending to squint in confusion. \"Hmm... are you sure you're not Zeus? I see thunderclouds in here...\" Her scowl intensifies. \"Hermes! I'm mad at you!\" she says forbiddingly, folding herself up tighter. Hermes makes a shocked face. \"At me? My gracious! No one's ever been mad at Hermes before! I must have really messed up!\" \"You did! You tricked me!\" \"Tricked you!\" \"You pretended to be a Cyclops but you were really just a jerk!\" Her frown is intense; her lip jutting out... and trembling just a little, he notices. Ohh, dear. Wounded pride. Probably scared by the Cyclops act, then embarrassed about being scared. Normally, in a case of wounded pride (especially if it was caused by Hermes in the first place), he would happily poke the injured party further - just ask Apollo - but he has a soft spot for kids. So he puts his hands over his heart, feigning hurt, and drifts down, turning himself upright. \"Oh, I think there's been a misunderstanding. You see, I wasn't here to pester you atall! I mean, gosh, why would I try? Everyone knows you're too brave to fall for that kind of joke!\" She's still glowering, but suspiciously. She's being redirected, slightly. He presses on, putting his hands up beseechingly and giving her his most innocent expression. \"I was just here to tease your sisters, not you.\" \"You said you were here to eat the naughty children!\" she accuses him. Hermes bites his lip to fight his laughter and still needs to put a hand over his mouth before he recovers. \"Were you the naughty one who pushed your mama's patience?\" Little Nephele stands up then, looking angry and upset and making tiny fists. The nymph has old scabs on her knees from where she's skinned them, and twigs in her hair, and a tear in her dress. \"I just like doin' stuff! I play really hard but that doesn't mean I'm bad!\" \"Hey, hey... c'mon... it's me, Hermes!\" he edges closer, holding up his hands and still smiling. \"You think someone like me cares about kids who play really hard? That's how I was when I was a kid, too! I think that's cool!\" She's wavering, and Hermes takes his chance. He pulls her in for a hug. \"C'mere. I don't eat any kids, good or bad, and I promise, I wouldn't punish a naughty little girl. Hell, I'd give her my blessing, and I will.\" Little Nephele accepts the hug and Hermes feels the peace of knowing he's smoothed over some ruffled feathers. \"Your mama was worried, though. You shouldn't run away from her like that,you know.\" \"I know,\" she sniffles. \"I just always feel better out here.\" Hmm. \"Well, tell you what,\" he says, pulling back and booping her nose. \"If you promise to pretend to be scared when I come by acting like the Cyclops - you know, to scare your sisters - then I promise I'll tell your mama what a good girl you really are.\" She finally grins for the first time. \"Deal.\" -------------------- He does in fact talk to Tethys, though what he tells her is different from what he promised. Tethys happens to agree with him, though they both think Nephele should be a little bit older. Maybe nine years old, insteadof five. So Hermes waits, and checks in on her from time to time - as discussed, he pretends to be the Cyclops when Tethys needs her daughters straightened out; and Nephele shrieks and runs around with her sisters, and shares a huge, not-subtle wink with Hermes afterwards. Just to make sure she's not losing her spark, Hermes tests her occasionally by tossing acorns at her head, or pretending to steal her wooden bear toy, or telling tall tales. She responds with the right amount of sass and childish aggression - retaliating by throwing pine cones at him, trying to steal his hat, or attempting to out-lie him. Naughtiest girl, indeed! When the day finally comes, he finds her as usual among the trees, and dumps an armload of pine needles and leaves on top of her head. She clenches her fists and roars after him as he laughs,leading her back to... Artemis. Artemis' eyebrows shoot up to her hairline as she hears some of the curse words Nephele is using (learned from Uncle Hermes, of course). Nephele draws up short, looking shocked. Hermes floats behind Artemis, looking smug. \"You see? Perfect foryour retinue. You should let me do all the recruiting for you!\" \"Well, I gotta admit, it's a strong first impression,\" Artemis snickers, looking Nephele over. \"So she's the one who called you a jerk?\" \"On the very first day I met her,\" Hermes brags. \"She was hiding from the Cyclops.\" Artemis laughs again. \"The one who eats naughty little girls?\" \"Yup! And she told me it wasn't fair, because she only seems poorly-behaved because she plays hard.\" Nephele has been silent, shocked, until this. She now draws herself upright defiantly. \"Yeah, and it's true! Lady Artemis, I don't know what kind of crap Lord Hermes has been telling you, but -\" \"Do you know what a retinue is, kiddo?\" Artemis interrupts, looking amused. Hermes' shoulders are shaking with laughter. \"...No...\" \"Well. It's my gang. Nymphs who play too hard, and run around in the woods? They join my retinue. If they want.\" Artemis puts her hands on her knees, bending over to be eye-to-eye with Nephele. \"I played pretty hard back when I was a kid - still do. Hermes says you're pretty tough. Is that true?\" Nephele glances at Hermes suspiciously. He makes that wide-eyed innocent expression at her. \"...Yeah. Pretty tough.\" \"Good. I like that.\" Artemis straightens up. \"I talked to your ma. She said it's fine if you want to join my retinue. We need some more tough girls who don't always behave themselves. Especially if they're not scared of Cyclopes.\" \"Can I fire a bow and arrow??\" \"Yeah, sure! You can join the hunting party when you're older. And you can work on your aim by throwing stuff at Hermes.\" \"Hey!\" Artemis ignores his pout with a grin. \"So what do you say, Nephele? Wanna be in my retinue?\" Nephele, with two skinned knees and a torn chiton and her hair cut short because she's always getting leaves and tangles in it anyway, grins at Artemis and Hermes. \"Deal!\"",

    "text": "\"Yeah, she's cute,\" Artemis says, leaning back into the pool with a sigh. \"I'm trying to find the right occasion for it. She's a little naive; I don't want to push her into something she's not ready for. Not to mention she's probably still feeling her way around her new body. Heh. 'So to speak.'\" At this remark, Selene's small smile lifts almost imperceptibly at one corner. \"You have your father's wit.\" \"Hey!\" \"But I'm glad to see you have more delicacy than he does in these matters. It's always worth being patient with the shy ones, and I know he has difficulty discerning this. With others, I mean. For my part, of course, I was quite eager to try out his - \" Artemis groans. \"DON'T FINISH THAT SENTENCE. Whatever gross thing you did with Zeus, I don't wanna hear about it!\" \"I only keep bringing it up because you always make that entertaining face.\" Selene smiles a little wider and adjusts her soft white mantle, which is nearly glowing under the moonlight. The celestial body tonight is not Selene, but Pandia, goddess of the full moon - Selene's eldest daughter, the product of her wild courtship with Zeus, years ago. Pandia is about the same age as Artemis; and when Selene fell in love with and married the shepherd Endymion, Pandia offered to drive the chariot once a month, on the full moon, so that Selene could have another whole night to visit her dreaming husband. \"Bleh. You Titans got a weird sense of humor.\" Artemis takes a swig off the wineskin she brought with her. \"...Not that I'm not glad to see you, but aren't you supposed to be with Endy tonight?\" \"Yes. I will be going, soon - I like to see that Pandia got into the sky all right. I know she's done it before, but... well, a mother worries. You know.\" This statement isn't as cutting as it would be from someone else - Selene understands. The hunters in Artemis' retinue are like daughters to her; and sisters; and lovers sometimes. They're all different roles without contradiction. Artemis smiles, thinking of her girls. \"Yeah. I know. I worry about these kids all the time. Actually, Callisto - \" \"What the hell,\" Selene interrupts, voice taking on a quiet but cold tone that Artemis has never heard before. \"...is that.\" Artemis looks over; Selene is looking up at the sky. Feeling a rise of dread, Artemis looks too - the full moon is deep red. A shadow moves across it, and in a short moment, the moon is gone. Pandia has vanished. ----- Of course, Siproites has seen Lady Selene before. Everyone has, really, as long as they can see at all: in a way, Lady Selene is about 50% omnipresent. She's in the sky, night after night, driving her moon chariot across the heavens, casting soft light over the earth below. And Selene has a regular presence in the Grove, though she's mostly there to see Artemis. So, even if she hasn't had occasion to speak to Lady Selene, Siproites has seen her many times. Never while the Titaness was bearing a weapon and a grimly fierce expression on her normally placid face, though. The weapons and grim expressions are matched by the couple dozen women gathered around in the glade. Lady Artemis has summoned all of her retinue and announced that they are searching for Pandia, goddess of the full moon. Everyone... except Siproites. \"You must stay behind, my sweet,\" Artemis says, kind but distracted. \"Whoever kidnapped Pandia is certainly dangerous and strong. You're still a little clumsy and inexperienced with a bow.\" She takes the sting out of the words with a kiss to Siproites' forehead. \"I could never live knowing I'd let my sweetest girl charge into danger. There will be other times for you to join us.\" Siproites disagrees - she has gotten much better at archery, and fairly adept at making her way through the wilderness, after months of practice - but she knows better than to argue with Lady Artemis even in the best of circumstances, let alone now, when she's strained as she is. So she watches, disappointed, as all the nymphs and mortal hunters take their instructions from Artemis and depart. Artemis and Selene leave last, in a shimmering of cold pale light, and Siproites is left alone with her pig (she's once named him Apollo Jr, given that she thinks him the most handsome of pigs; but hastily renamed him to Charopos - \"Cheery Boy\" - after Apollo himself objected). \"I suppose I should be grateful that she cares so much about me,\" Siproites says to Cheery, glumly, tossing him bits of apple and watching him snuffle around for it. \"And... it's true, there will be other chances for me to prove I'm better than she thinks I am. This isn't the right time for it... right, Cheery?\" Cheery grunts; perhaps agreeing, and perhaps just commenting on the ripeness of the apple. Siproites sighs. \"I'm surprised none of them thought to ask King Zeus for help, though. Pandia is his daughter, too...\" She brightens up. \"Oh - perhaps I could get a message to him somehow! He'd be a big help, I'm sure, he could send Hermes to look for her and - \" \"No, that would be inadvisable,\" comes a woman's voice, from - up above Sippy? In the tree?? She looks up and sees an exceptionally large female hawk, staring directly at her, which is about as clear a sign Siproites needs that it isn't a real bird - even aside from the obvious fact that hawks don't normally muck about at night. But it doesn't tell her who the hawk really is. The eyes appear to be lavender, though... Siproites tries to remember who has lavender eyes... \"Er...\" she begins uncertainly. The hawk tilts its head. \"You're Siproites, correct? The newest of Artemis' virgins. I'm glad you're here.\" Siproites stands. That voice is familiar. \"Y-yes... I'm Siproites. May I ask, who are you...?\" The hawk sighs irritably - another unhawklike thing to do - but dips her head. \"I am Hera. Now - \" \"Oh!\" Siproites flings herself down to her knees, respectfully. \"Queen Hera! I am sorry for not addressing you properly!\" \"Silly girl, get up. I hadn't exactly announced myself. We must hurry.\" Siproites gets back to her feet. \"Hurry, my queen?\" \"Yes. This nonsense with Pandia is already getting out of hand; it can only get worse if someone doesn't intervene.\" \"My queen, should we not... call back Lady Artemis or Lady Selene? I'm happy to serve, but I was asked to stay - \" \"No. Listen, my dear, this situation requires a bit of discretion. Can I rely on you for this?\" Siproites is starting to feel a little uncertain. \"My queen... what has happened? I don't understand.\" The Hera-hawk ruffles her feathers, and Siproites senses she's suppressing impatience. \"A regrettable and bothersome cascading of actions. I am attempting to do something... complicated. You may not have heard of the hero Jason; he is adventuring far to the west of here. I am his patron. In order to aid him in his adventure... well, as I have said, it is complicated. But one of my agents has decided that the best way to render him assistance was to 'draw down the moon', for use in a magic spell.\" Siproites gasps. \"A witch has Pandia?!\" \"Yes. You needn't fear for her; this is not Erichtho or anyone similarly dire. Medea can be reasoned with, and in fact I think she will be quite open to suggestions, as I don't believe she expected to drag the actual moon down from the sky. Had it been Selene in the sky, she surely wouldn't have been able. But Pandia is no Titan, and now Medea finds herself holding a goddess hostage. The girl is too powerful,\" Hera adds, as though to herself. \"That will need to be dealt with as well, somehow. But one thing at a time; we must get Pandia back into the sky swiftly, before Artemis and Selene discover what has happened and turn against Jason.\" \"My queen - I am happy to serve, but - couldn't you just take her...?\" \"I cannot be seen to be directly involved in this, Siproites,\" Hera says fervently. \"If Artemis finds out I was even indirectly involved, there will be consequences. And if Zeus finds out...\" \"...He'll be angry?\" Siproites asks, throat dry. \"No, he'll be an insufferable prick about it,\" Hera says flatly. \"Unbearably smug for years to come; and he will probably figure out what I'm trying to accomplish, which would be even worse. But for you, Siproites, I would think it motivation enough to assist your mistress with getting her half-sister back?\" \"Oh - well, yes, of course I want to help - \" \"Excellent. Then please climb atop my back. We have to hurry.\" ----------- \"Speak, nymph; why have you come here?!\" The woman - surprisingly, she looks to be about Siproites' age - is wielding a knife, but holds off on stabbing Siproites with it. Sippy doesn't cut a particularly menacing figure, evidently. Siproites thinks she could hold her own; but she'd rather not fight, so she holds out her hands placatingly. \"Are you Medea? I'm only the nymph Siproites. I've come to retrieve Pandia; nothing more. No one knows I'm here.\" Medea hesitates a moment more before gesturing her inside. \"Praise to Hecate,\" she mutters. Praise to Hera, really, Siproites thinks but doesn't say. Hera had flown her across a stretch of sea, which was not as exhilarating as Siproites might have thought - there wasn't much to see. The sky was dark without Pandia; the sea was even darker. The queen of the gods had set her down on an island called Colchis and directed her to the small hut where Medea could be found. Like Hera had intimated, Medea looks frazzled and stressed. Her spell was only supposed to drain power from the moon, calling upon its energy - not to drag the actual moon down to this island. So Medea explains, gesturing in bewilderment at the tall, regal, faintly glowing girl seated in a chair in the hut. Siproites rushes over to her. \"Lady Pandia! I'm glad to see you're safe!\" Pandia clasps her hands, politely, but looks nonplussed by all of this. \"Er - you're - one of the nymphs, right?\" \"Yes, lady, Siproites,\" she replies modestly, bowing. \"I was sent to fetch you.\" \"Oh! Mother or Arty have already been looking for me? As I thought they might,\" she says, casting a significant glance at the witch. Medea groans. \"Ah, well, actually... it was someone else. Someone... who is trying to avoid war among the gods,\" Siproites says, pleased with her discretion and diplomacy. \"Hera, then,\" Medea says sullenly. \"Oh - uh, n-no, why would you - \" \"She's Jason's patron on this adventure of his. It stands to reason that she wouldn't want Artemis, Selene, or anyone else involved. So, she wants to be discreet, and hide her involvement in this whole mess, and let me take the hit for it!\" Medea speaks very casually of the gods, with an irreverence that Siproites wouldn't dare imitate. Pandia has raised her eyebrows at this disrespect as well. \"QueenHera may have chosen to involve you in Jason's quest, but she certainly didn't compel you to try to steal power from the moon... or to kidnap the moon, for that matter.\" \"What were you even trying to do with Lady Pandia, anyway?\" Siproites wants to know. She spent most of that flight across the sea wondering what possible thing you could accomplish with the moon. \"Oh, well. My love - Jason - he needs to get the golden fleece, and the Dragon guards it,\" Medea says, cheeks coloring as she says the hero's name. \"This spell will help kill it. Should still do that, even if I ended up with more than I wanted.\" Pandia looks startled. \"The dragon of Colchis? That's - Lord Ares' dragon!\" Siproites goes cold as Pandia continues. \"Forget about Artemis - if you kill that dragon, Lord Ares is going to come after you! Are you just trying to piss off the entire Pantheon??\" Medea snorts dismissively. \"Athena's backing the quest as well. Between her and Hera, I don't think we'll have need to fear Ares.\" \"But you're not worried about a possible battle involving Queen Hera, Lady Athena, Lord Ares, Lady Artemis, and my mother?\" Medea looks agitated again. \"That was not part of the plan. The spell should never have done that. And now I have no idea how I'm going to get you back up into the damned sky!\" \"Oh! I know how to do that,\" Siproites says cheerfully. Medea and Pandia both stare at her. \"Why the hell didn't you lead with that?!\" Medea cries. Siproites gives her a cool look. \"Well, we have to make sure we have our story straight first.\" She hadn't been sure how to convince Lady Pandia to keep the whole incident a secret, but she thinks she knows now. \"Lady Pandia. Of course you are less concerned than Medea or myself about a war among the gods... but please. Consider this. You're friends with Lady Artemis - and she's friends with Lord Ares. She's fond of his dragons too; and I know she'll be upset if this dragon gets killed.\" Pandia's mouth quirks. \"She certainly would. But how can we prevent that from happening?\" she asks, as though she already knows the answer. Siproites looks back at Medea. \"You need to find another way to get that fleece. Find a way to sneak past the dragon, or put it to sleep. I don't care how, but that dragon will be unharmed, or I'll tell Lady Artemis and Lady Selene about the whole thing.\" Medea looks furious and relieved at the same time. \"You're a bold little brat, I'll grant you that,\" she mutters. \"If this damned spell hadn't backfired so spectacularly...\" Pandia stands up. \"But it did, and this is the best possible outcome you'll get,\" she says. \"I agree to those terms. I have no wish to see Lady Artemis sorrowed over the loss of one of those dragons. Put the thing to sleep instead, and don't ever try this stunt again, and I'll never breathe a word of your involvement.\" \"Fine. Wonderful,\" Medea glances at her cauldron. \"I need to start now. My beloved Jason goes to confront the beast in the morning.\" \"We'll be on our way, then,\" Pandia says, taking Siproites' hand. They both pause, waiting to see if Medea's going to say or do anything more; but the witch is already pawing through a collection of herbs and vials, muttering to herself. They leave with no further hindrances. \"That witch is far too powerful,\" Pandia says, as they walk towards the beach. \"Yes, that's what He- uh, what my... informant... said...\" Pandia giggles. \"You're pretty good at diplomacy, Siproites! I really have to thank you. I didn't know how we were going to resolve that.\" Siproites beams. \"I'm happy it turned out so well! I didn't think it would go so smoothly, but I guess Medea really didn't want to get involved in a war among the goddesses.\" \"No one would!\" They reach the shore and stare up at the dark sky. \"Now, you did say you had a plan...\" Pandia says doubtfully. \"Yes.\" Siproites brings out her bow and a single gleaming arrow, made of willow and fletched with the petals of the lotus. The sacred plants of Hera. \"We'll tie a length of cord to this arrow, and to your wrist. It will carry you back into the sky.\" Pandia looks at her in disbelief. \"Are... are you sure that will work?\" \"Yes! It's a good arrow, and I'm a pretty good shot. I've been practicing a lot!\" Pandia looks at the arrow, and at Siproites, and back up at the sky. She sighs. \"Well - it's worth a shot, I guess. Heh. Pardon the pun.\" They tie the cord, but before Siproites can get into position, Pandia abruptly hugs her, giving her a kiss on the cheek. \"I'll send Artemis to come get you. Thank you again, so much,\" she says. Siproites is blushing furiously, and glad that the night is so dark. \"I'm just happy to help, Lady Pandia,\" she replies. She aims her bow for the dark patch in the sky, where Lady Pandia's chariot was last seen. She aligns her body to that patch of sky... pulls the string back until she can feel it touch her cheek (where Pandia had kissed her, as it happens)... and allows her fingers to relax, releasing the arrow. As Hera had promised, the arrow and Pandia both fly into the sky - a silver streak, shooting into the darkness. There is an anxious minute where nothing appears to change - and then, finally, the moon reappears in the sky, full and bright as ever. --------- It's not long afterwards that Artemis and Selene come to find Siproites where she's been waiting on the beach in Colchis. Artemis scoops her up in an enormous hug, spinning her around. \"SIPPY!! We heard all about it!!\" \"Eeeeekk, Lady Ahhartemis!!\" Siproites squeals, clutching at the goddess, unable to stop from giggling. \"Yes, Pandia told us that you found her in the ocean and contrived to... shoot her back into the sky, somehow,\" Selene says, approaching more sedately. Her tone indicates that she doesn't quite believe this story, but for the moment, she says nothing more about it. \"Can't believe you were sandbagging this whole time. You were a damn hero all along, you little brat!\" Artemis is delighted, tickling Siproites and making her laugh. \"Guess we underestimated you!\" \"I wasn't sandbagging! I told you, Lady!\" Siproites giggles again, swatting Artemis' hands away. \"Yup, you sure did. Sneaky little badass.\" Artemis' voice is proud and it's making Siproites' heart swell like it hasn't before, not even since she was first welcomed into the Grove. It's like her acceptance has been made final, somehow. And sealed with a kiss, no less - once Artemis has stilled, Selene places light fingers under Siproites' chin and tilts her face up. \"I thank you for this service, Siproites,\" she says, her voice soft and melodic, before giving Siproites a small kiss. Artemis does the same, leaving Siproites looking flushed, surprised, and pleased. Artemis grins. \"You did very well, sweet girl. We'll have to come up with a good way to thank you properly.\" She hoists Siproites up to her shoulders and points east. \"What a long damn night. Let's get back home.\"",

      "Pandia is about the same age as Artemis; and when Selene fell in love with and married the shepherd Endymion, Pandia offered to drive the chariot once a month, on the full moon, so that Selene could have another whole night to visit her dreaming husband.",

      "Pandia has vanished.",
      "----- Of course, Siproites has seen Lady Selene before.",
      "Everyone has, really, as long as they can see at all: in a way, Lady Selene is about 50% omnipresent.",
      "She's in the sky, night after night, driving her moon chariot across the heavens, casting soft light over the earth below.",
      "And Selene has a regular presence in the Grove, though she's mostly there to see Artemis.",
      "So, even if she hasn't had occasion to speak to Lady Selene, Siproites has seen her many times.",
      "Never while the Titaness was bearing a weapon and a grimly fierce expression on her normally placid face, though.",

      "\"I could never live knowing I'd let my sweetest girl charge into danger.",
      "There will be other times for you to join us.\"",
      "Siproites disagrees - she has gotten much better at archery, and fairly adept at making her way through the wilderness, after months of practice - but she knows better than to argue with Lady Artemis even in the best of circumstances, let alone now, when she's strained as she is.",
      "So she watches, disappointed, as all the nymphs and mortal hunters take their instructions from Artemis and depart.",
      "Artemis and Selene leave last, in a shimmering of cold pale light, and Siproites is left alone with her pig (she's once named him Apollo Jr, given that she thinks him the most handsome of pigs; but hastily renamed him to Charopos - \"Cheery Boy\" - after Apollo himself objected).",
      "\"I suppose I should be grateful that she cares so much about me,\" Siproites says to Cheery, glumly, tossing him bits of apple and watching him snuffle around for it.",
      "\"And... it's true, there will be other chances for me to prove I'm better than she thinks I am.",
      "This isn't the right time for it... right, Cheery?\" Cheery grunts; perhaps agreeing, and perhaps just commenting on the ripeness of the apple.",

      "In the tree??",
      "She looks up and sees an exceptionally large female hawk, staring directly at her, which is about as clear a sign Siproites needs that it isn't a real bird - even aside from the obvious fact that hawks don't normally muck about at night.",
      "But it doesn't tell her who the hawk really is.",
      "The eyes appear to be lavender, though...",
      "Siproites tries to remember who has lavender eyes...",

      "what has happened?",
      "I don't understand.\"",
      "The Hera-hawk ruffles her feathers, and Siproites senses she's suppressing impatience.",
      "\"A regrettable and bothersome cascading of actions.",
      "I am attempting to do something... complicated.",
      "You may not have heard of the hero Jason; he is adventuring far to the west of here.",
      "I am his patron.",
      "In order to aid him in his adventure...",
      "well, as I have said, it is complicated.",
      "But one of my agents has decided that the best way to render him assistance was to 'draw down the moon', for use in a magic spell.\"",
      "Siproites gasps.",
      "\"A witch has Pandia?!\"",
      "\"Yes.",
      "You needn't fear for her; this is not Erichtho or anyone similarly dire.",
      "Medea can be reasoned with, and in fact I think she will be quite open to suggestions, as I don't believe she expected to drag the actual moon down from the sky.",
      "Had it been Selene in the sky, she surely wouldn't have been able.",
      "But Pandia is no Titan, and now Medea finds herself holding a goddess hostage.",
      "The girl is too powerful,\" Hera adds, as though to herself.",
      "\"That will need to be dealt with as well, somehow.",
      "But one thing at a time; we must get Pandia back into the sky swiftly, before Artemis and Selene discover what has happened and turn against Jason.\"",
      "\"My queen - I am happy to serve, but - couldn't you just take her...?\"",
      "\"I cannot be seen to be directly involved in this, Siproites,\" Hera says fervently.",
      "\"If Artemis finds out I was even indirectly involved, there will be consequences.",
      "And if Zeus finds out...\" \"...He'll be angry?\" Siproites asks, throat dry.",
      "\"No, he'll be an insufferable prick about it,\" Hera says flatly.",
      "\"Unbearably smug for years to come; and he will probably figure out what I'm trying to accomplish, which would be even worse.",
      "But for you, Siproites, I would think it motivation enough to assist your mistress with getting her half-sister back?\"",
      "\"Oh - well, yes, of course I want to help - \" \"Excellent.",
      "Then please climb atop my back.",
      "We have to hurry.\"",
      "----------- \"Speak, nymph; why have you come here?!\"",
      "The woman - surprisingly, she looks to be about Siproites' age - is wielding a knife, but holds off on stabbing Siproites with it.",
      "Sippy doesn't cut a particularly menacing figure, evidently.",
      "Siproites thinks she could hold her own; but she'd rather not fight, so she holds out her hands placatingly.",
      "\"Are you Medea?",

      "\"Praise to Hecate,\" she mutters.",
      "Praise to Hera, really, Siproites thinks but doesn't say.",
      "Hera had flown her across a stretch of sea, which was not as exhilarating as Siproites might have thought - there wasn't much to see.",
      "The sky was dark without Pandia; the sea was even darker.",
      "The queen of the gods had set her down on an island called Colchis and directed her to the small hut where Medea could be found.",
      "Like Hera had intimated, Medea looks frazzled and stressed.",
      "Her spell was only supposed to drain power from the moon, calling upon its energy - not to drag the actual moon down to this island.",
      "So Medea explains, gesturing in bewilderment at the tall, regal, faintly glowing girl seated in a chair in the hut.",
      "Siproites rushes over to her.",
      "\"Lady Pandia!",
      "I'm glad to see you're safe!\"",
      "Pandia clasps her hands, politely, but looks nonplussed by all of this.",
      "\"Er - you're - one of the nymphs, right?\"",
      "\"Yes, lady, Siproites,\" she replies modestly, bowing.",
      "\"I was sent to fetch you.\"",
      "\"Oh!",
      "Mother or Arty have already been looking for me?",
      "As I thought they might,\" she says, casting a significant glance at the witch.",
      "Medea groans.",
      "\"Ah, well, actually...",
      "it was someone else.",
      "Someone... who is trying to avoid war among the gods,\" Siproites says, pleased with her discretion and diplomacy.",
      "\"Hera, then,\" Medea says sullenly.",
      "\"Oh - uh, n-no, why would you - \" \"She's Jason's patron on this adventure of his.",
      "It stands to reason that she wouldn't want Artemis, Selene, or anyone else involved.",
      "So, she wants to be discreet, and hide her involvement in this whole mess, and let me take the hit for it!\"",
      "Medea speaks very casually of the gods, with an irreverence that Siproites wouldn't dare imitate.",
      "Pandia has raised her eyebrows at this disrespect as well.",
      "\"QueenHera may have chosen to involve you in Jason's quest, but she certainly didn't compel you to try to steal power from the moon... or to kidnap the moon, for that matter.\"",
      "\"What were you even trying to do with Lady Pandia, anyway?\" Siproites wants to know.",
      "She spent most of that flight across the sea wondering what possible thing you could accomplish with the moon.",
      "\"Oh, well.",
      "My love - Jason - he needs to get the golden fleece, and the Dragon guards it,\" Medea says, cheeks coloring as she says the hero's name.",
      "\"This spell will help kill it.",
      "Should still do that, even if I ended up with more than I wanted.\"",
      "Pandia looks startled.",
      "\"The dragon of Colchis?",
      "That's - Lord Ares' dragon!\"",
      "Siproites goes cold as Pandia continues.",
      "\"Forget about Artemis - if you kill that dragon, Lord Ares is going to come after you!",
      "Are you just trying to piss off the entire Pantheon??\" Medea snorts dismissively.",
      "\"Athena's backing the quest as well.",
      "Between her and Hera, I don't think we'll have need to fear Ares.\"",
      "\"But you're not worried about a possible battle involving Queen Hera, Lady Athena, Lord Ares, Lady Artemis, and my mother?\" Medea looks agitated again.",
      "\"That was not part of the plan.",
      "The spell should never have done that.",
      "And now I have no idea how I'm going to get you back up into the damned sky!\"",
      "\"Oh!",
      "I know how to do that,\" Siproites says cheerfully.",
      "Medea and Pandia both stare at her.",
      "\"Why the hell didn't you lead with that?!\"",
      "Medea cries.",
      "Siproites gives her a cool look.",
      "\"Well, we have to make sure we have our story straight first.\"",
      "She hadn't been sure how to convince Lady Pandia to keep the whole incident a secret, but she thinks she knows now.",
      "\"Lady Pandia.",
      "Of course you are less concerned than Medea or myself about a war among the gods... but please.",
      "Consider this.",
      "You're friends with Lady Artemis - and she's friends with Lord Ares.",
      "She's fond of his dragons too; and I know she'll be upset if this dragon gets killed.\"",
      "Pandia's mouth quirks.",
      "\"She certainly would.",
      "But how can we prevent that from happening?\" she asks, as though she already knows the answer.",
      "Siproites looks back at Medea.",
      "\"You need to find another way to get that fleece.",
      "Find a way to sneak past the dragon, or put it to sleep.",
      "I don't care how, but that dragon will be unharmed, or I'll tell Lady Artemis and Lady Selene about the whole thing.\"",
      "Medea looks furious and relieved at the same time.",
      "\"You're a bold little brat, I'll grant you that,\" she mutters.",
      "\"If this damned spell hadn't backfired so spectacularly...\" Pandia stands up.",
      "\"But it did, and this is the best possible outcome you'll get,\" she says.",
      "\"I agree to those terms.",
      "I have no wish to see Lady Artemis sorrowed over the loss of one of those dragons.",
      "Put the thing to sleep instead, and don't ever try this stunt again, and I'll never breathe a word of your involvement.\"",
      "\"Fine.",
      "Wonderful,\" Medea glances at her cauldron.",
      "\"I need to start now.",
      "My beloved Jason goes to confront the beast in the morning.\"",
      "\"We'll be on our way, then,\" Pandia says, taking Siproites' hand.",
      "They both pause, waiting to see if Medea's going to say or do anything more; but the witch is already pawing through a collection of herbs and vials, muttering to herself.",
      "They leave with no further hindrances.",
      "\"That witch is far too powerful,\" Pandia says, as they walk towards the beach.",
      "\"Yes, that's what He- uh, what my... informant... said...\" Pandia giggles.",
      "\"You're pretty good at diplomacy, Siproites!",
      "I really have to thank you.",
      "I didn't know how we were going to resolve that.\"",
      "Siproites beams.",
      "\"I'm happy it turned out so well!",
      "I didn't think it would go so smoothly, but I guess Medea really didn't want to get involved in a war among the goddesses.\"",
      "\"No one would!\"",
      "They reach the shore and stare up at the dark sky.",
      "\"Now, you did say you had a plan...\" Pandia says doubtfully.",
      "\"Yes.\"",
      "Siproites brings out her bow and a single gleaming arrow, made of willow and fletched with the petals of the lotus.",
      "The sacred plants of Hera.",
      "\"We'll tie a length of cord to this arrow, and to your wrist.",
      "It will carry you back into the sky.\"",
      "Pandia looks at her in disbelief.",
      "\"Are... are you sure that will work?\"",
      "\"Yes!",
      "It's a good arrow, and I'm a pretty good shot.",
      "I've been practicing a lot!\"",

    "text": "Siproites isn't the sort to complain. She's cheerfully content with her lot in life, and happy to go along with everyone else. And really, what is there to complain about here? She has everything she has ever wanted! Lady Artemis is very fond of her, in spite of the shocking way Siproites introduced herself. It is by Lady Artemis' grace that Siproites is able to be her truest self, and it's such a relief. Siproites had always tried to be cheerful, but she'd never realized how much the secret and the doubt had weighed on her. Before, she'd sort of been going through the motions, but now she feels blissful and free as a default state. And she's made so many new friends! There's Atlalanta, who's everyone's favorite because she's so brave and strong, and she goes out on her own to adventure sometimes and brings Siproites back trinkets; and Beroe, who's the oldest and some say she's a goddess herself, though she doesn't say much about it and she showed Siproites how to swim better; and Antikleia, with the clever fingers who taught Siproites how to weave; and Cyrene who fought a LION...!! And there's Lady Artemis herself, of course. And Lady Selene, when she visits. And Lord Hermes is always so funny, when he comes to deliver a message, and Lord Ares, who frightened Siproites at first but now she sees he's a heroic gentleman. And even Lord Apollo sort of seems as though he might come around to liking Siproites someday, though he tends to be standoffish with all of Lady Artemis' retinue (Cyrene is the notable exception). And they're all kind to her, even if Siproites is sort of a silly idiot sometimes, and clumsy and not much use as a hunter yet. And they never doubt her place in the Grove. They never question that she's a woman. They never make much production of it at all, really - she's just silly Siproites, the young nymph who's doing her best to serve the Lady Artemis. Really, what is there to complain about? ----before--- Siproites has never been the sort to complain. She isn't the sort to say much of anything at all, any more. She had been a jolly child, round and smiling and loving to make others happy. Her smile fades gradually as she gets older, and her parents begin to be frustrated as their only son and heir's failure to turn into the man they envision. This is the crux of the problem: everyone thinks he's a boy. Siproites has tried explaining it, but her protests aren't well-received, to say the least. \"Well, you're certainly as lazy and foolish as a woman,\" his father says of her, often, in response to the one time Siproites had dared to bring it up. You'd think that her mother would take some umbrage to her sex being devalued this way, but she is mostly worried that Siproites will never find a wife. Siproites doesn't know what to say to them. She knows she doesn't behave the way a man needs to behave. She tries, for their sake, but it's always been plain that she's coming at the boyish behaviors from the wrong angle somehow. There's a doubt, deep in his heart, that she doesn't ever want to look at too closely, and certainly will never speak aloud. She has doubts that she's really her parents' son - that she's anyone's son. She wonders if mighty Prometheus had ever mistakenly fashioned clay humans with the wrong parts on the wrong body. Pointless to even think about it - she is how she is, and she can't change it, and her parents certainly won't want to hear her doubts. So Siproites keeps it inside and says nothing. In spite of the fact that she's scorned for behaving like the simpleton, she tries to stay pleasant and cheerful and not think about anything much, since the alternative of dwelling on it threatens to eat her alive. ---present-- Lord Dionysus has graciously stayed sober for this conversation. He is somewhat new to the pantheon, and as such he takes any supplications to him very seriously. Siproites has appealed to him in a lesser-known role: not as the god of madness, or parties, or alcohol; but the champion of those who don't fit the mold of the gender they were born with. Siproites had been very worried about her decision to seek his counsel - most of the tales of Dionysus revolve around drunken orgies with satyrs and maenads that seem to end in someone being dismembered. It takes all her courage, but - she really wants to talk about this. About her. About the fact that she is a 'her,' now. She's grateful to everyone in the Grove for accepting her identity, but she wants to talk about it. And, murders or not, Lord Dionysus was raised as a woman and is equally comfortable with either identity. He might understand. So, a few months of consideration, Siproites decides to be brave and approach the mad god. At his suggestion, they are having this conversation at the pool of Salmacis. They're snacking on chestnuts and figs and honestly, Lord Dionysus is rather friendly and approachable, not at all the terrifying leader of mad and murderous lechers like she'd been afraid of! He's been very well-behaved and even brought a wax tablet in case he needed to take notes. At first, he makes hashes on the tablet in some letters Siproites doesn't recognize, but as the words pour from her, his hand gradually stills, and he just watches her and listens. His pretty face is mostly neutral and inviting, but there's a faint crease in the brow. After a while, when she pauses, he finally speaks. \"Let me ask you this. What does your best case scenario look like?\" \"Uh... I guess... they realize that I wasn't... a failure? Maybe they'll see that, okay, they were right about me being not a great son, but that maybe I'm a good daughter?\" \"Sippy, darling, first point, I need to correct you. You weren't a failure. You aren't a failure. Arty doesn't choose 'failures' to be in her retinue. She only choses the coolest and the most fun. She is one of the highest authorities on cool and fun. So kindly do your best to dismiss that mistaken idea from your brain. Second,\" he passes her a clean rag so that she can mop at her eyes, because of course she's started crying a little bit. \"Second, even if they came to their senses and realized they were being awful all along, are you planning to go back with them? To live with them as their daughter? Married off eventually?\" \"...no... I want to stay with Lady Artemis.\" \"So, you're looking for closure, it sounds like.\" \"I guess so....it's a little pointless, isn't it.\" \"Not pointless,\" he says kindly. \"Goodness knows, half the things I did in my time as a mortal was about seeking closure with my father. In my case, it paid off. But Sippy... if you don't get closure from your parents, what will you do?\" She thinks about this for a moment. They watch the pool of Salmacis shimmer in the light. One of the first points of conversation, when they'd arrived, had been about Hermaphroditus, who had been Lord Dionysus' first supplicant in this capacity. According to him, that event had been significantly less sordid than the story's retellings would indicate. It had been stressful for both the man and the nymph, and they'd had moments of doubt and fear before finally pressing forward with their decision. Now, they were thinking of joining the Erotes. The conversation had gone on to Lord Dionysus' own admission that he'd felt doubt and nervousness too, about his identity, in spite of his projection of confidence. His way of dealing with all of his issues - any of them, not just his gender identity - is to plow forward and make the rest of the world catch up to him. But he's admitted it was hard, sometimes, and he's had moments when he wondered if he would have been happier just going with the flow instead. But these moments are brief, for Lord Dionysus; because he is who he is, and he won't change that for anyone. Siproites knows this will be hard. It was frightening and confusing for Hermaphroditus and even Lord Dionysus; it will be frightening and confusing, at times, for Siproites. But across the balance, this is a positive. She's happier with herself and with life. She doesn't know how her parents will react to this, but she knows she wants to give them the chance to see how mistaken they all were before, and how much better this is now, with Siproites in the world as a woman. \"If they don't accept me... I guess... I'll just go back to the Grove and do my best to make Lady Artemis proud,\" she decides. \"Same as if they do accept me. My future is with the Lady, now, I'm absolutely sure. But I want to give them the chance to see that.\" \"Then I'll support you in that,\" Lord Dionysus says, giving her a sideways hug and a chaste kiss to the forehead. \"And for what it's worth, you're already doing amazing, sweetie.\" She's crying again, a little, but she smiles up at him. \"Thank you, Lord Dionysus. Um, may I ask one final favor? Please - don't tell Lady Artemis. I don't want her to think I'm ungrateful.\" \"I doubt she'd think that, little one, but sure. My lips are sealed.\" He makes a key-turning gesture at the corner of his mouth. -----before--- Time passes, and in spite of Siproites' best efforts to punch it down, the secret doubt only grows and grows. Siproites is determined to stay cheerful, but it's difficult to say the least. All the things that bring her joy, also bring pain. As a child, she loved playing with her sisters. She allowed the girls to play dress-up with him, styling her hair and painting her face and putting their childish jewelry on him, and when they showed him how she looks in the polished bronze mirror, she had to fight tears at how badly she wanted this. Her mother would come in then and snatch the adornments from her body and furiously scrub at her face, muttering that if she wasn't their only son, their father would surely have thrown her out to the wolves for how useless she is. She still does this, in secret. She goes out to the woods sometimes, to put on the jewelry and attempt to style her hair, and look at her reflection in a pool of water. It's not even these acts that are important to her. She's not really that excited about hairstyles and jewelry. But it's what the women do. Siproites often wonders if she'd had any brothers, if perhaps she might have been free to behave differently. They keep saying it over and over, that she's their only son and heir. She needs to start being a man. Siproites feels a deep dread every time they say this. Because what else can she do? She's stuck. She doesn't have any brothers. She has to be the son. Nothing to do but try to make the best of it. Be cheerful, be pleasant, try to do the things men do, try not to think too much about what might have been. -----present----- Dionysus waits until the little nymph is out of sight before he sighs and slouches back against the tree. He takes out his wineskin and makes a vague gesture behind him. \"Well, Lady Artemis?\" Artemis steps out from hiding and stands beside him, looking annoyed, offended, and slightly baffled. \"You're a noisy, drunken idiot. There's no way you knew I was back there.\" Dionysus grins at her, not offended. He's new to the ranks of the Olympians, sure, but Artemis' conversational charms are legendary. \"You're wrong on all four counts, honey. I'm not noisy or drunk - at the moment - and I'm not the idiot you take me for. I knew you were back there because I knew you'd never let your sweetest girl in my presence without keeping your eagle eye on me.\" She sighs and shrugs. \"Sippy can be a little naive. And she is my sweetest girl. She wouldn't survive ten minutes in one of your wild-ass parties.\" Dionysus can see that he's going to need to start throwing at least one or two classy, low-key parties, just to prove he has range. Jeez. You have just a couple of murder-orgies and everyone thinks that's, like, your thing. But he lets it drop for now. He wants to discuss the nymph. \"She's not going to survive ten minutes back at her family's house, from the sounds of it. She didn't tell you any of that?\" Artemis' face is stony. \"No. I didn't realize she felt she had to keep it from me. Or that she believed she was a failed boy.\" \"Don't hold it against her. It's pretty confusing shit. And there's not a lot of precedent for her to know what to do.\" \"Yeah. I'm not mad at her.\" Artemis finally sits down next to him. \"I'm a little fucking mad at those two, though.\" \"Her parents? Yeah.\" Dionysus takes a long drink. \"I'm no seer, like your brother, but I gotta say, I'm not seeing a best-case scenario panning out for her there.\" \"Me either.\" \"It's not even just a matter of her truly being a woman. They also made her think that's a bad thing, so it's not like they're going to just burst with pride now that she's happy with herself. There's just no way this is going to end well.\" He watches as Artemis helps herself to his figs without asking. \"So I'm gonna follow along when she goes.\" \"I will, too - \" \"No, Artemis,\" Dionysus says gently (and bravely, in the face of the look she gives him). \"You'd rush in and kill them, and it's not that I'm against that, but it could be pretty traumatizing for her. Don't give her any reason to fear you. Just be there for her after. Be her sanctuary. Let me do the traumatic shit.\" He grins and takes another drink. \"Not a bad idea for me to make a statement on my domain anyway.\" -----before---- They cut her hair and she cries about it, because it's unquestionably boyish now. Her father slaps her face but even her heart isn't in it; they've all gotten accustomed to effeminate Siproites, the failure, the embarrassment. They make her attend school with the other boys. She learns to write and to count, which is nice, but also to wrestle and to hunt and run. Even this, she wouldn't mind, except she balks at the implication: This is what boys do. The other boys make their bragging talk about girls and women and sex, and this is dizzyingly strange for Siproites. She feels torn. She's uncomfortable with the talk and doesn't want to participate; yet she's as intrigued as they are by the idea of ladies and sex. She tries once to chime in and it's so horribly, embarrassingly obvious that she's doing it wrong, that she never speaks up again and they don't even jeer at her awkwardness, only exclude her and shoot her pitying looks. It all makes her wonder what the hell is wrong with her and despair of ever making sense. It's while she's unenthusiastically wandering in the woods in search of something manly to shoot with her bow, that she all at once is struck with years of backlogged anxiety and she realizes that this is her life. She'll always be pretending. She'll always feel resentment, she'll always feel wrong, she'll always feel lonely. Always. Because she's no one's son, but she has to be, but she can't be, but she is and will be. But she isn't. The impossibility of it makes her physically nauseous and she drops her bow abruptly and just wanders, eyes and mind blank. She has no idea where she's going or how she'll get back, and she isn't thinking about it. She just can't make herself care. What is there to go home to? Part of her knows this is dangerous - she's a poor woodsman anyway, due to her inattentiveness to her lessons, and if she's deliberately wandering into the wilderness without even trying... It's night when she sort of wakes out of the trance of misery. She recognizes nothing around her. She's cold and she's hungry and she's thirsty... well, there's at least one small piece of good fortune, then. She can hear the splashing of water nearby. A pool. She can start there, anyway. She heads in that direction, making her way with no difficulties. The moon is shining very brightly overhead tonight, making it easy to see. ------present------ \"You couldn't have just been dead, could you,\" her father spits out, bitterly. \"It wasn't enough that you abandoned us; you had to come back and humiliate the family further.\" There had been a few minutes when Siproites had entertained a hope that the visit would go well. The first reaction hadn't been disgust or anger, but surprise and confusion. It was a totally neutral reaction and she'd thought, perhaps, that this meant the conversation could go in another direction than what she feared. And even when the anger had kicked in, it was anger about her abandonment, to which she didn't have much rejoinder. It had been months, after all, and she hadn't let them know what became of her. It had been too easy for her to forget. Her life, in the last few months, has been such a whirlwind of excitement and happiness, just being able to be herself and to chase after joy after so long.... She's enjoyed it, and hasn't wanted to think about her old life, or this exact confrontation. Because after they angrily berate her for abandoning them physically, they finally decide to discuss how she abandoned them symbolically, by turning into a woman. As though she'd done it just to bring shame on the family. \"But that's just it, Papa,\" she finds her voice. \"It really had nothing to do with you, all along. When I was in the woods, I came to a pool of water, and that was when - Lady Artemis, I met her there, and she told me that she could see right away that I had a woman's heart all along - \" \"Yes, daughter, we understand.\" From her mother. It's the words she's wanted to hear for so long, but flung at her with so much venom that it makes her start to shake where she's standing. \"We don't have a son and never did. We should have realized a long time ago.\" \"But she - made things right! Things are right, now!\" \"If things were right, we'd have a son to carry on the family.\" Her father shakes his head, as though in deep disbelief. \"To think that you could show your face here again. Gods, just - just go, back to the woods.\" \"All right.\" Siproites stands up, feeling distant from herself and from these people. \"All right. Well, I just wanted to tell you that I'm happy now, and - I won't be coming back.\" They say nothing to this; or at least, if they do, Siproites doesn't hear it through the fog. It's done. There's nothing left to say. They don't understand her and they feel nothing for her. She's been rejected and disowned. They've made it plain. It's a wrenching knowledge, and Siproites is dimly aware that her heart is going to catch up to her later and it's going to hurt. But it's done, and she can finally say that there's nothing unresolved now. Nothing left undone. She bows, mostly on muscle memory, and leaves the small house, closing the door behind her. ----- Dionysus watches the nymph leave the house. He's leaning against a tree nearby, unseen; the villagers wandering around on their business would only see vines climbing the tree, if they even notice that much. He considers whether he should drag the entire village into this or not. After all, they also contributed, in their way, to rejecting the girl. But he decides against it. These two unworthy people will do their part of forcing the village to notice. He watches as Siproites walks, back straight and head high, into the woods. The poor kid chose to dress up for this - her dark hair is adorned with some small clips of silver moons, and a simple moon pendant hangs on a chain between her breasts. She's wearing the ankle-length chiton that mostly women wear, even though every other time Dionysus has seen her, she seems to prefer the knee-length. She even got hold of a corded girdle that she must have borrowed from one of the other nymphs. She must have really wanted to make a statement today. It breaks his heart to think of the girl trying to look her loveliest, only to be met with such hostility. He considers going after her, to tell her how fucking proud he is of her, but he knows that Artemis is lurking just beyond the treeline and she's really the better person to welcome Sippy back. Dionysus will meet up with her later. For now, he enters the house that Siproites has just left. The two older people within are still slouched where they must have been sitting while they were talking to their child. They have pinched, unhappy faces and it's clear they're about to start some kind of epic bitching session, but Dionysus' entrance interrupts whatever they were going to say. \"Your daughter,\" he says without preamble, \"is one of my people. She, like me, cannot fit into the mold that Prometheus made for her. She will walk beside me as we seek others; she can shine as an inspiration to them. \"But I cannot claim her as a follower, because she serves the goddess Artemis. She was chosen by the Lady for her personal retinue. It is truly a great honor.\" Up to this point, the two individuals are giving him an odd look, because he of course hasn't introduced himself. When he speaks of Prometheus and Artemis, their expressions begin to change, finally - too late - starting to catch on. They'll figure it out wholly in a moment; possibly the last thing they do figure out. Dionysus' handsome features have been carefully held in a pleasantly neutral expression; but now, he allows a grin to form on his face. It is absolutely not pleasant. \"Truly a great honor,\" he repeats, raising one hand, his staff gripped tight, \"...you'd have to be mad not to see it.\" ---------- Artemis is pacing back and forth in the trees, waiting for Sippy to come back. For a while, Apollo and Hermes had been hanging around with her, but Artemis' irritation had sent them fleeing before long. She is fiercely protective of her girls. All the gods have learned this by now - the hard way, in some cases. She has no compunctions about beating the shit out of any of them if necessary. And even when her girls leave her, as they sometimes do, Artemis always sends them off with a kiss, and a discreet but brutal shovel talk to the paramour. Artemis will always be their sanctuary. Sippy's taking too long. Those fuckers probably already sold her into a marriage with some asshole. Or they've killed her, maybe; some bullshit about 'family honor.' Yeah, she knows Dionysus is down there, but the wait is killing her. And then - there she is. Siproites is stumbling a little as she makes her way through the woods. The girl's wearing an impractically long chiton, not much good for treading through the underbrush. It looks beautiful on her, along with the jewelry and girdle; but one glance at the red and tear-streaked face tells Artemis that the effort was wasted. Artemis hurries over to her, and realizes all at once that she has no idea what to say in the face of the girl's misery. She wouldn't say the Olympic family is without its flaws, but there has never, ever been a time when Artemis was denied her identity. She isn't sure what could possibly be an appropriate thing to say to Siproites now. So she's uncharacteristically hesitant when she approaches the girl (who starts at the approach; this kid is awful at woodsmanship). \"Uh - Sippy, hey - are you...okay?\" she asks, feeling like an asshole because obviously Sippy isn't okay. To her surprise, Siproites throws her arms around Artemis, hugging the goddess fiercely. Artemis is briefly too shocked to respond; this is the first time Siproites has done this. Prior to now, she's been mostly worshipfully distant with Artemis. But, hell, Artemis can give a hug, if that's what Sippy needs. She gathers the young nymph into her arms and rubs her back, making nonsensical soothing noises as she does so. \"Sweetie - seriously - are you all right? I was worried - do you need me to - \" she trails off. 'Do you need me to murder anyone' is definitely not the right thing to say, even if it's kind of her forte. \"No, Lady, I just - please - let's just go home,\" Siproites chokes out, still crying into Artemis' chiton. Artemis is briefly confused: didn't she just leave...? But then, of course, she realizes. She hugs Siproites tightly, then gives her a quick kiss on the cheek and smooths her hair before straightening up and taking her hand. \"I'm really glad I ever found you that day,\" Siproites sniffles. \"Me too, Sippy,\" Artemis replies, as they start back to the Grove.",

      "But I want to give them the chance to see that.\"",
      "\"Then I'll support you in that,\" Lord Dionysus says, giving her a sideways hug and a chaste kiss to the forehead.",
      "\"And for what it's worth, you're already doing amazing, sweetie.\"",
      "She's crying again, a little, but she smiles up at him.",
      "\"Thank you, Lord Dionysus.",
      "Um, may I ask one final favor?",
      "Please - don't tell Lady Artemis.",

      "Her mother would come in then and snatch the adornments from her body and furiously scrub at her face, muttering that if she wasn't their only son, their father would surely have thrown her out to the wolves for how useless she is.",
      "She still does this, in secret.",
      "She goes out to the woods sometimes, to put on the jewelry and attempt to style her hair, and look at her reflection in a pool of water.",
      "It's not even these acts that are important to her.",
      "She's not really that excited about hairstyles and jewelry.",
      "But it's what the women do.",
      "Siproites often wonders if she'd had any brothers, if perhaps she might have been free to behave differently.",

      "It's while she's unenthusiastically wandering in the woods in search of something manly to shoot with her bow, that she all at once is struck with years of backlogged anxiety and she realizes that this is her life.",
      "She'll always be pretending.",
      "She'll always feel resentment, she'll always feel wrong, she'll always feel lonely.",
      "Always.",
      "Because she's no one's son, but she has to be, but she can't be, but she is and will be.",
      "But she isn't.",
      "The impossibility of it makes her physically nauseous and she drops her bow abruptly and just wanders, eyes and mind blank.",
      "She has no idea where she's going or how she'll get back, and she isn't thinking about it.",
      "She just can't make herself care.",
      "What is there to go home to?",
      "Part of her knows this is dangerous - she's a poor woodsman anyway, due to her inattentiveness to her lessons, and if she's deliberately wandering into the wilderness without even trying...",
      "It's night when she sort of wakes out of the trance of misery.",
      "She recognizes nothing around her.",
      "She's cold and she's hungry and she's thirsty...",
      "well, there's at least one small piece of good fortune, then.",
      "She can hear the splashing of water nearby.",
      "A pool.",
      "She can start there, anyway.",
      "She heads in that direction, making her way with no difficulties.",
      "The moon is shining very brightly overhead tonight, making it easy to see. ------present------",
      "\"You couldn't have just been dead, could you,\" her father spits out, bitterly.",
      "\"It wasn't enough that you abandoned us; you had to come back and humiliate the family further.\"",
      "There had been a few minutes when Siproites had entertained a hope that the visit would go well.",
      "The first reaction hadn't been disgust or anger, but surprise and confusion.",
      "It was a totally neutral reaction and she'd thought, perhaps, that this meant the conversation could go in another direction than what she feared.",
      "And even when the anger had kicked in, it was anger about her abandonment, to which she didn't have much rejoinder.",
      "It had been months, after all, and she hadn't let them know what became of her.",
      "It had been too easy for her to forget.",
      "Her life, in the last few months, has been such a whirlwind of excitement and happiness, just being able to be herself and to chase after joy after so long....",
      "She's enjoyed it, and hasn't wanted to think about her old life, or this exact confrontation.",
      "Because after they angrily berate her for abandoning them physically, they finally decide to discuss how she abandoned them symbolically, by turning into a woman.",
      "As though she'd done it just to bring shame on the family.",
      "\"But that's just it, Papa,\" she finds her voice.",
      "\"It really had nothing to do with you, all along.",
      "When I was in the woods, I came to a pool of water, and that was when - Lady Artemis, I met her there, and she told me that she could see right away that I had a woman's heart all along - \" \"Yes, daughter, we understand.\"",
      "From her mother.",
      "It's the words she's wanted to hear for so long, but flung at her with so much venom that it makes her start to shake where she's standing.",
      "\"We don't have a son and never did.",
      "We should have realized a long time ago.\"",
      "\"But she - made things right!",
      "Things are right, now!\"",
      "\"If things were right, we'd have a son to carry on the family.\"",
      "Her father shakes his head, as though in deep disbelief.",
      "\"To think that you could show your face here again.",
      "Gods, just - just go, back to the woods.\"",
      "\"All right.\"",
      "Siproites stands up, feeling distant from herself and from these people.",
      "\"All right.",
      "Well, I just wanted to tell you that I'm happy now, and - I won't be coming back.\"",
      "They say nothing to this; or at least, if they do, Siproites doesn't hear it through the fog.",
      "It's done.",
      "There's nothing left to say.",
      "They don't understand her and they feel nothing for her.",
      "She's been rejected and disowned.",
      "They've made it plain.",
      "It's a wrenching knowledge, and Siproites is dimly aware that her heart is going to catch up to her later and it's going to hurt.",
      "But it's done, and she can finally say that there's nothing unresolved now.",
      "Nothing left undone.",
      "She bows, mostly on muscle memory, and leaves the small house, closing the door behind her.",
      "----- Dionysus watches the nymph leave the house.",
      "He's leaning against a tree nearby, unseen; the villagers wandering around on their business would only see vines climbing the tree, if they even notice that much.",
      "He considers whether he should drag the entire village into this or not.",
      "After all, they also contributed, in their way, to rejecting the girl.",
      "But he decides against it.",
      "These two unworthy people will do their part of forcing the village to notice.",
      "He watches as Siproites walks, back straight and head high, into the woods.",
      "The poor kid chose to dress up for this - her dark hair is adorned with some small clips of silver moons, and a simple moon pendant hangs on a chain between her breasts.",
      "She's wearing the ankle-length chiton that mostly women wear, even though every other time Dionysus has seen her, she seems to prefer the knee-length.",
      "She even got hold of a corded girdle that she must have borrowed from one of the other nymphs.",
      "She must have really wanted to make a statement today.",
      "It breaks his heart to think of the girl trying to look her loveliest, only to be met with such hostility.",
      "He considers going after her, to tell her how fucking proud he is of her, but he knows that Artemis is lurking just beyond the treeline and she's really the better person to welcome Sippy back.",
      "Dionysus will meet up with her later.",
      "For now, he enters the house that Siproites has just left.",
      "The two older people within are still slouched where they must have been sitting while they were talking to their child.",
      "They have pinched, unhappy faces and it's clear they're about to start some kind of epic bitching session, but Dionysus' entrance interrupts whatever they were going to say.",
      "\"Your daughter,\" he says without preamble, \"is one of my people.",
      "She, like me, cannot fit into the mold that Prometheus made for her.",
      "She will walk beside me as we seek others; she can shine as an inspiration to them.",
      "\"But I cannot claim her as a follower, because she serves the goddess Artemis.",
      "She was chosen by the Lady for her personal retinue.",
      "It is truly a great honor.\"",
      "Up to this point, the two individuals are giving him an odd look, because he of course hasn't introduced himself.",
      "When he speaks of Prometheus and Artemis, their expressions begin to change, finally - too late - starting to catch on.",
      "They'll figure it out wholly in a moment; possibly the last thing they do figure out.",
      "Dionysus' handsome features have been carefully held in a pleasantly neutral expression; but now, he allows a grin to form on his face.",
      "It is absolutely not pleasant.",
      "\"Truly a great honor,\" he repeats, raising one hand, his staff gripped tight, \"...you'd have to be mad not to see it.\"",
      "---------- Artemis is pacing back and forth in the trees, waiting for Sippy to come back.",
      "For a while, Apollo and Hermes had been hanging around with her, but Artemis' irritation had sent them fleeing before long.",
      "She is fiercely protective of her girls.",
      "All the gods have learned this by now - the hard way, in some cases.",
      "She has no compunctions about beating the shit out of any of them if necessary.",
      "And even when her girls leave her, as they sometimes do, Artemis always sends them off with a kiss, and a discreet but brutal shovel talk to the paramour.",
      "Artemis will always be their sanctuary.",
      "Sippy's taking too long.",
      "Those fuckers probably already sold her into a marriage with some asshole.",
      "Or they've killed her, maybe; some bullshit about 'family honor.'",
      "Yeah, she knows Dionysus is down there, but the wait is killing her.",
      "And then - there she is.",
      "Siproites is stumbling a little as she makes her way through the woods.",
      "The girl's wearing an impractically long chiton, not much good for treading through the underbrush.",
      "It looks beautiful on her, along with the jewelry and girdle; but one glance at the red and tear-streaked face tells Artemis that the effort was wasted.",
      "Artemis hurries over to her, and realizes all at once that she has no idea what to say in the face of the girl's misery.",
      "She wouldn't say the Olympic family is without its flaws, but there has never, ever been a time when Artemis was denied her identity.",
      "She isn't sure what could possibly be an appropriate thing to say to Siproites now.",
      "So she's uncharacteristically hesitant when she approaches the girl (who starts at the approach; this kid is awful at woodsmanship).",
      "\"Uh - Sippy, hey - are you...okay?\" she asks, feeling like an asshole because obviously Sippy isn't okay.",
      "To her surprise, Siproites throws her arms around Artemis, hugging the goddess fiercely.",
      "Artemis is briefly too shocked to respond; this is the first time Siproites has done this.",
      "Prior to now, she's been mostly worshipfully distant with Artemis.",
      "But, hell, Artemis can give a hug, if that's what Sippy needs.",
      "She gathers the young nymph into her arms and rubs her back, making nonsensical soothing noises as she does so.",
      "\"Sweetie - seriously - are you all right?",
      "I was worried - do you need me to - \" she trails off. '",
      "Do you need me to murder anyone' is definitely not the right thing to say, even if it's kind of her forte.",
      "\"No, Lady, I just - please - let's just go home,\" Siproites chokes out, still crying into Artemis' chiton.",
      "Artemis is briefly confused: didn't she just leave...?",
      "But then, of course, she realizes.",
      "She hugs Siproites tightly, then gives her a quick kiss on the cheek and smooths her hair before straightening up and taking her hand.",
      "\"I'm really glad I ever found you that day,\" Siproites sniffles.",
      "\"Me too, Sippy,\" Artemis replies, as they start back to the Grove."

    "text": "Most of the girls and women of Artemis' Grove haven't left it since they've arrived, not even to visit their families. There's a real risk that they'll be dragged back and forced into marriage; or that, as an unattended woman, they'll be snatched by a random man and forced into worse. Artemis' Grove is a sanctuary that none dare enter, leaving the women feeling safe and secure. Now that Siproites has lived here and seen what's at stake, she understands why Artemis took the action she did, when Siproites had stumbled upon her at the pool. She's only grateful the goddess chose to spare her for her transgression. But she worries about other men that might make the same mistake. After all, Siproites herself had been wandering blindly in the woods, with no notion that she (he, back then) was approaching a bathing goddess. \"Generally, in my experience, most hunters in the woods have a better sense of what the hell they're doing than you did, my sweet,\" Artemis remarks drily. She is lounging luxuriously in a pool right now, laughing at Siproites' proposal that she patrol the perimeter around the area while the Lady attended to her cleanliness. \"Most of these creeps know exactly what they're doing when they 'stumble' on me. You were an exceptional case in a few ways. An innocent, for one thing; and of course, in possession of a woman's heart. And it was obvious you had no idea how you even got there in the first place - I never saw such an incompetent hunter! I really gotta start training with you.\" \"Please, Lady Artemis, don't distract me!\" This is a hopeless request, since the goddess' current state of nudity is a distraction by itself. Siproites bravely forges ahead anyway. \"You just don't know for certain what may come.\" \"It hardly matters. I've been handling the creeps for centuries, kiddo.\" \"But why have to subject yourself to all that, when I can hold them off before they bother you?\" Artemis looks like she's about to start laughing again. \"Can you hold them off yourself? These legions of lustful men?\" At that moment - vindication! - a man's voice is heard, carrying through the woods, managing to sound soft but clear at the same moment. \"Hello? Are you near?\" Siproites jumps up, grabbing the spear she brought from the Armory for this exact purpose, and grins triumphantly. \"You see, Lady?! No fear! I'll send them away!\" \"All right. You do that.\" If Siproites hadn't been so excited, she might have noticed that Artemis appears even less concerned - and more amused - than usual. But Siproites is excited, so she charges into the woods with her spear raised threateningly......And quickly runs into a man, as expected. However, this particular man deviates from the norm: he glows faintly, a soft golden aura, and he looks exactly like Artemis might, had she been born into a man's body. And if she had a perpetually aloof expression on her face. Siproites draws up short, and swiftly fumbles her way into a full bow (which she doesn't realize until after she's done it, that it's a man's gesture and she probably looks ridiculous). \"Lord Apollo! How - unexpected. Welcome to the Grove, Lord.\" Artemis is calling from her pool, out of sight within the trees. \"Apollo! Apollo, this is her! The one who named her pig after you!\" The god of the sun pauses, then slides his eyes over to look at her, face still kept perfectly neutral. \".......Oh. Siproites. A pleasure to meet you at last.\" Lord Apollo can fit an awful lot of disdain into such a lovely voice. Siproites' face is red-hot. \"It's - it's because he's such a handsome and clever pig, Lord Apollo! He really is remarkable, not a regular sort of pig, he hardly likes rolling in the mud at all and the sows all adore him...\" She trails off, then looks away, biting her lip. \"And, uh... a pleasure to meet you too at last, Lord Apollo. Er... Lady Artemis is this way...\" She gestures in the direction of the pool and trudges after him when he treads in that direction. Artemis is snickering as they arrive. \"Good to see you, brother. I hope you weren't too frightened by my attendant's sudden appearance! She's taken it into her head that she must defend my honor against all men that might stumble upon me by accident.\" \"Oh?\" Apollo looks back at Siproites. His face is still impassive, but Siproites dares to hope that there's a little less scorn in his voice. \"That's good to hear. Someone ought to be handling that task, since you seem so determined to stay unguarded, sister.\" He seats himself nearby, and Siproites realizes he has been politely averting his gaze without looking self-conscious or awkward at all. Artemis scoffs at him. \"You and Sippy both! A pair of worried mother hens!\" \"You should take better measures of precaution. Especially spending as much time as you do with that buffoonish ogre.\" \"Ares is more of a gentleman than you'd guess,\" Artemis counters, then slyly looks over at Siproites. \"Ain't that so, Sippy?\" Siproites won't make eye contact. \"If you say so, my Lady.\" \"Siproites.\" Her name in Apollo's voice sounds solemn and mysterious. \"I'd like to speak with my sister alone. Please depart for the moment and guard this pool, as you excellently suggested. I'm grateful that someone is taking my sister's safety seriously.\" Artemis only rolls her eyes and splashes a bit of water at him, which he disperses with a wave of heat from his fingertips. \"But before you go, Siproites...\" She bows again - oops. \"Yes, Lord Apollo?\" \"I am........flattered, that you would name such a clever and handsome beast in my honor. However, you can surely see that having two entities with the same name, spending time in the same woods, would lead to confusion over time. It might be for the best if you chose another name for your pig.\" Still bowing, Siproites nods, feeling her face redden again. \"Of- of course, Lord Apollo. I'll think on a new name as I patrol.\" \"Excellent. Thank you.\" Siproites scampers off, hearing Artemis' voice fading behind her: \"Nicely handled, bro! Anyone would think you weren't completely jealous of the pig.\" \"Shut up, Artemis.\"",

    "text": "1969: He was only there in person, briefly. ----- He was Dennis, then - wearing a silk shirt with ruffles, tucked into bright purple bell-bottoms and accented with a wide belt. He wore an era-appropriate mustache and the platform shoes that were beginning to catch on in the country. Dennis has gone in drag before - at the Stonewall Inn, yes, but countless times in the previous several thousand years in innumerable locales across the world. But today, he's there in \"plain\" clothes, just enjoying himself as he watches the mostly-young crowd of gay people as they sing and dance and drink. To that end, he's also present as the god of festivity - but today, at this place and this time, he's chosen to be there in person as well. Apollo had told him he might want to. He wouldn't specify why - the god of prophecy rarely does - but they've all learned by now to heed his advice. So he slips on one of his favored identities: Dennis, a sometimes-drag queen and always-queer man; wearing a little less makeup than usual and sipping his bootlegged alcohol as he watches the scene. At this time and place in history, he doesn't often see the other gods - they make occasional appearances but it's mostly his show. Eros and Aphrodite are probably the most frequent presences, but even then, gay culture is considered so distinct that they mostly leave it to him to run. He isn't surprised to see Ares, though, when the police enter - another raid. Not the first. Ares drags himself in after the plainclothes cops with a clear lack of enthusiasm. As the god of civic order, Ares is obligated to be there where the police are. But his presence is thin and shadowy, and Ares himself does not deign to participate beyond watching. \"Exactly what do a bunch of gays and lesbians at a bar have to do with civic order,\" he has complained before, and resents being required be here. His barely-substantial presence is an indication that although the official agents of civic order are present, they do not have his blessing as they shout to the patrons, ordering them to line up and present their identification; then, in short order, to enter the police patrol wagon. The spirit of festivity is gone entirely, leaving only Dennis in his bell-bottoms. Dionysus sighs and prepares to fade out of reality, to witness the injustice to his people - - but then, out of the corner of his eye, he sees the winged form of Eris, hovering over the lineup. She catches his eye and offers a half-smirk and a wink, and tosses a golden apple into the air. The chaos has begun to escalate even before there's a chance to see where the apple went. In a flash, \"Dennis\" is gone, vanished; in his place, huge and suddenly powerful, is Dionysus: the god of these outcasts of society, the gays, the lesbians, the ones for whom terms don't exist yet, as they begin to shout and sing and loudly declare themselves for who they are. Ares, god of courage and fighting spirit, is suddenly there as well - having to switch sides and fight against himself again, as he often does, but considerably bigger and more substantial and enthusiasticas he spurs on the crowd as they begin to fight the police. Eris is everywhere, wild and savage and joyful, whispering suggestions into the ears of the bystanders, goading them into just jumping in and participating. Dionysus is in all of them: all of his queer children, as they surge forward as a force to be reckoned with. He is powerful, this night; and he vows that he will make the memory of this moment ring through the years. ----------------- Present day: ---- He's Dennis again, and he's experimenting with a \"hipster bear\" look. And yeah, frankly, the look is not working for him; but Apollo's been frowning with so much disapproval that Dionysus is determined to wear the plaid and suspenders and beard anyway. Apollo thinks that Dionysus should be dressing to his type, which of course is effeminate and/or fey but jeez!! There's more to life than looking fabulous every minute of every day! You gotta leave room to experiment! Luckily, Apollo is distracted by the even-more offensive presence of Ares, who's dressed in the exact same fatigues and under-armour shirt that he wears everywhere else. Ares has been present for every Pride event since its inception - as usual, in two capacities. There's still a push-and-pull between civic order and gay pride, but at least once every June, he shows up in person to march with Dionysus in a parade to commemorate the riots. That was four decades ago, and Dionysus has figured out that Ares is never, ever, ever going to be convinced to dress flamboyantly - or even just dress nicer than usual - for these events, and for his part, Dio's fine with it. Ares is who he is, and it's enough for Dionysus that his heart is on the side of the people who need his courage. \"I'm not gonna wear a cravat,\" he says flatly to Apollo. Apollo is part of the show, now - he was always on the fringes, indirectly involved, since so many artists and musicians were more open with their queer sexualities. That role has expanded; and he's additionally representing younger boys and men who are learning this is a part of themselves. Similarly, Artemis is here, for the girls; and Hermaphroditus accompanies them for those who don't fall under the twins' purview. All three are, as expected, basically gay fashion icons. Aphrodite and Eros are standing beside each other, a dual explosion of glitter and rainbow colors. Hermes is hovering over them, wearing the ugliest (but admittedly very eye-catching and enthusiastically proud) outfit that Dionysus has ever seen. The messenger god, in spite of having a finger in virtually every other spiritual pie in the world, doesn't have an official capacity here and waits excitedly for the parade where they all join in person, same as Helios. \"Man, you look like a wet blanket,\" Hermes teases Ares. \"A drab shadow on our sparkly rainbow parade! I can loan you a cool puce-and-chartreuse shirt - I mean, it would probably be a crop top on you, but that's actually even better - \" \"Nope!\" \"It's fine,\" Dionysus says brightly. \"People will probably assume he's here to represent the military kink. That's still a thing!\" Ares' eyebrows shoot up. \"Uh-?!\" \"Here, Enyal- er, Ares,\" says Icarus, the kid that the sun idiots have declared as their lover. Another of Dionysus' people. \"You can have my flag pin? It's a little more toned-down than wearing a bucket of glitter?\" Ares' face does that thing where he tries to smile but it looks like he's baring his teeth. Icarus doesn't even blink; he must have already been warned. \"Thanks, kiddo.\" \"Icarus!\" Apollo looks surprised. \"But, what about you?\" The mortal shrugs. \"They hand out tons of pins and flags and stuff, I'll get another one.\" \"But - you're not going to march with us?\" Helios is pouting hardcore. Icarus' cheeks color a little. \"It's - uh, not really my thing,\" he says, awkwardly. \"I mean, not that I'm like, ashamed, or not supportive, or whatever, it's just... I'm not into parades?\" Dionysus swoops in to give Icarus an enormous (gay-hipster-style) bear hug and a kiss on the cheek. \"That's perfectly all right, darling boy, that's what we were doing this for. So you can be the sweetest little gay cutie any way you want.\" As he'd expected, Apollo and Helios immediately forget about Icarus' reticence in favor of yelling at Dionysus for daring to give THEIR BOYFRIEND a hug and a kiss!! They don't notice, though Dionysus does, that Ares and Icarus exchange a fist bump before the god of courage goes to join his consort and (possible) son where they stand in a puddle of glitter. Dionysus' heart swells. So many aspects of life here today, represented at last. Pride is the only word for it.",

    "text": "It is many, many years, and it is many, many miles from Hellas, when she finally hears the word: the concept, identified at last. Komorebi. --------- The sea is Aphrodite's birthplace. Long before she emerges from it as the goddess of love and beauty, she is only a pre-formed Titaness of the waves - a potential entity, but one without form or purpose yet. In the centuries to follow, many forget that her formative years were spent drifting as seafoam, watching in delight as the people and creatures of the depths carried out their lives. The wild and passionate romance of Queen Amphitrite and her suitor Poseidon. The many adventures and dramatics of the Nereids and the sea-gods. The mystery of the god-child hidden in a grotto, where he creates works of unspeakable beauty. Like many of the ocean's denizens, the mystery of Hephaestus tantalizes. She tries to imagine what creations he has wrought. The items' purposes are of little interest to her - as seafoam, she mostly only drifts and witnesses and dreams. She has no use for trinkets beyond the pleasure they give her to look at them. So, of the mysterious treasures: what do they look like? What colors, what shapes? Her imagination typically will call up her favorite sight within the wide ocean: caustic optics. This is the beautiful patchwork pattern laid out upon the ocean floor, the result of the light hitting the perpetually shifting surface of the water and refracting into bright lines, like shifting tiles. The natural phenomenon is strikingly lovely, and has a calming effect on most. Poseidon can often be found dozing on the sea-bed, caustic patterns drifting over his skin and the sand around him, broken only by the quick shadows of colorful schools of fish. This sort of beauty is no less lovely for being extremely common - Helios travels the sky daily, after all, and the irregular surface of the sea is a constant. But this started to shape Aphrodite for who she was - seeing beauty in common things, as well as irregularities. The famous painting of her birth - standing in a shell and ascending to the shore in a glory of attendants and beauty - is a little misleading. Her first step upon the beach was alone, no witnesses except a few gulls. The first thing she does is to gaze up at Helios - to behold the sun, unfiltered by the salty water. He gleams, shining in the sky, and stares back at her, returning her wave tentatively. The sky is blue.... Dotted with a few clouds here and there, and with Helios of course, and a few other stray weather gods drifting through on their business. But overall, much clearer up here, and much more permanent. She clothes herself in seafoam and begins walking towards the trees, legs unsteady upon the solid earth, form shifting as she decides upon the shape she likes. Unlike most other gods, she has the luxury of choosing her 'base' form. All gods can shapeshift, of course, but being born of seafoam means she is not tied to a base form she must return to. Still, after watching the Nereids for so long, she has decided that she must assume a semipermanent shape, if only that her friends can recognize her quickly. Female, then, because she feels more female than anything else. She wants to be soft, warm, inviting - her form becomes short and plump, her hair long and wavy like the strands of seaweeds in the water.... Hmm. The color doesn't feel right, though. Kelp-green is too cool, too dark... her hair quickly rainbows through a selection of colors before she settles on a soft pink hue. Not terribly common within the sea, and nearly always associated with the soft, squishy jellyfishes or sponges. Her eyes, she keeps a sharp, bright sea-green. It provides a nice contrast and will remind the beholder of her birthplace, her secret wildness. The skin color leaves her undecided for a while. The local humans' skin is a palette of mostly middle-to-darker tones, but she's seen that there's a fair variety to choose from. She goes through the skin tones idly, not feeling satisfied with any of them, and sighs, sitting upon the soft grass beneath the trees, and it's then that she sees it. Helios is still overhead. His rays are blunted through the leaves overhead, casting a shadow on the ground. And yet... the god of the west wind - Zephyrus? - drifts past, rustling the tree leaves as he goes, and turns to smile at her. She returns the smile, wanting to make a good first impression, but quickly turns her attention back to the ground where something astonishing has happened. The sunlight filters through the tree-leaves and shifts, overlapping patterns of light and shadow changing constantly as the leaves move and allow bursts of sun through. The breeze dies down and the commotion slows - but doesn't stop. The leaves are constantly shifting, even if only in tiny increments, leaving the pattern different every time she looks. It does the same to her skin, as she looks on in delight. A pattern of light and shadow, making her skin two different colors at once. She has no word for it, and neither does anyone else that she meets for some time. Many centuries later, in a land called Nippon - she learns of a word that describes this phenomenon. Komorebi, the play of light through tree leaves. It's similar to the caustic optics she loves - a shifting pattern of light upon a surface, and yet, unique to the land environment. There could be no clearer sign, this bridging of her old world and her new. When the Olympians arrive to investigate this new Titaness who has emerged from the waves, she has decided upon her skin at last - mottled tones of pale and dark, irregularly patterned, a testament to the first beautiful thing she saw when she arrived in the world as the goddess of love and beauty.",

    "text": "It's something around five or six hundred years after she marries her husband, that she hears of Pericles' famous funeral oration. It's a pretty enough speech; inspiring in many ways and always eloquent. His speech is intended to embolden the audience, and stir up patriotism and pride in their great city of Athens, by describing all the ways in which Athens is the best society. As such, it's not especially factually describing Athens, so much as it is describing the ideal that Athens strives for. So, not strictly accurate, nor is it especially meant to be. Still, she has to chuckle a bit at his inclusion of the ideal Athenian woman: \"A woman's reputation is highest when men say little about her, whether it be good or evil.\" The implication being, of course, that she led an unremarkable life of quiet obedience to her father and her husband - no wicked deeds, of course; nor any eye-catching noble deeds. Naive little fool! All it means, when no one speaks of a woman for good or ill, is that she never got caught. And no one speaks of Hebe, hardly at all. ------------------------- The myths about Hebe are sparse - Pericles would surely approve. You'd think it would be difficult to be this invisible, given that she is the daughter of the King and Queen of Olympus, and Zeus and Hera have quite the flair for the dramatic, to put it mildly. Her big brother, Ares, is a regular source of excitement as well; and her aunts and uncles and all her half-brothers and half-sisters complement the full circus. Lots of myths about them. But since the whole lot of them seem to have claimed all the fuss and commotion, leaving none left for Hebe. Hebe is a calm and pleasant baby from the start. The novelty of such a creature born on Olympus makes her adored even more than she already is as a princess. When she is presented to her family, upon her birth and joyful acceptance by Zeus and Hera, the gifts are piled high upon tables. Astonishing paintings and mosaics and special songs, composed for her alone, come from Apollo; a collection of shiny coins from all over the world, and a carefully carved bird that whistles when you blow into it, from Hermes; soft-woven clothes for herself and her dolls, from Athena; toys made of beaten metal that wind up and move about, created by Hephaestus. And so many more! Hebe's birth is a rare occasion that brings only happiness to Olympus. It's this that shapes her role as the goddess of youth. Everyone forever wants to preserve this; to give her presents and play games and never, never get caught up in the worries and drama that await an adult. Particularly Zeus and Hera, who have more than enough tensions of their own at home, and don't want to lose this one beautiful thing they've created together. So Hebe stays young - generally, taking the appearance of a nine- or ten-year-old for most of her charmed existence, and behaving the same. Papa Zeus laughs and tosses her into the air when he sees her; Mama Hera smiles and brings her to sit in her lap and talk about the adventures her dolls have been having. Hebe's life is pleasant and unchallenging. She brings laughter and gaiety to all who see her... but when they leave the room, her childish ways are quickly forgotten. No one speaks ill of Hebe, certainly. How could they? But her stalled childhood prevents them from having anything good or interesting to say about her either. And they all make the mistake of assuming that because she looks and acts like a child, that she must possess the brain of a child as well. Which often (unfairly) means they think of her as a sweet simpleton. But Hebe is clever and mature and extraordinarily self-possessed, child or not. And eventually, Hebe grows bored. --------------- Her first rebellion is so small and insignificant that it isn't even perceived as rebellion. Hebe envies the other gods their purposes. Papa is the king, and makes stormclouds. Mama is the queen and blesses marriages. Hermes delivers messages and steals things and tells funny jokes. Aunt Demeter makes plants grow. Grandpa Helios is the sun; he gives light and warmth to the whole world every day. And all the others have important jobs to do as well. What is there for Hebe to do? She doesn't want to be the goddess of playing with dolls all day, even if it is fun. So she creates a job for herself, getting the idea after she watches enough of the councils, spying upon them from a secret place behind a pillar. She has her dolls with her as props, in case she gets caught, she can look like she's just playing. No one notices her, though, except for Aunt Hess, who catches her eye and winks. Come to think of it, there aren't many myths about Aunt Hess, either... Hebe goes to Mama and Papa when they're both in a good mood at the same time and in the same place, which means waiting a while. Even luckier, they happen to be mostly alone: only Aunt Hestia and Hermes are nearby, and they're speaking at Auntie's Hearth, while Mama and Papa sit on a bench overlooking the clouds. Papa's slightly out of sorts - one of his favorite heroes isn't doing well at the moment - but Hebe bets she can cheer him up the rest of the way with a winning grin, throwing herself at him so he has to catch her. She's right, and his booming laughter fills the hall as he tosses her into the air and then hugs her tightly, and his broad smile matches Mama's. \"What trouble is my little ducky getting into today?\" he teases her, using the nickname they've all used lately, stemming from a game where she'd pretended to be all the animals. Everyone had fallen in love with her duck impression. Hebe knows how to work a crowd. She sticks her tongue out at him, making him and Mama both laugh at her impertinence. \"I don't get into trouble hardly at all anymore, Papa, but if you're worried about it, I have an idea.\" They laugh again, amused. This is the face they usually present to her, but she's seen them strained, furious, heartbroken. She likes to see them happy, smiling. \"A plan to keep you out of trouble? You must have stayed up all night with Athena to cook up such an idea!\" Now Mama's teasing. Of course Hebe doesn't get into trouble. \"I did not ask Athena for any help! This is my own idea!\" she hmphs, crossing her arms. Papa and Mama pretend to wither at her stern look. \"Of course, my darling, Athena is not the only one with clever ideas,\" Mama soothes. \"So what is this great plan?\" Papa coaxes. She drops the offended look at once. \"You need a cupbearer!\" she declares. They both raise their eyebrows in surprise! \"A cupbearer?\" \"Right! To take your drinks to you when you're at council, so that you don't need to interrupt to get up.\" At present, at feasts or at councils, the gods serve themselves the nectar they drink. It's a minor enough inconvenience. But at feasts, they have often complained of going thirsty in order not to miss a song from Apollo or a dance from his Muses; and in councils it can be worse, with no one wishing to absent themselves during an important discussion point. Aunt Hestia has offered to serve the gods and this was shot down immediately. It was beneath her to serve them; she is the firstborn of the Olympians and it is beneath her to serve them. There is no one, anywhere in the world, who wishes to see Aunt Hestia demean herself... even if she herself doesn't care. It is technically beneath Hebe, too, as the Princess of Olympus, and she can see it in her parents' faces. Particularly Mama's - she won't like the idea of her precious daughter serving those other children of Papa's. The bastard children. Hebe heads off this dangerous line of thought before it can even be formed completely. She takes an earnest posture, hands clasped on Papa's knee and looking up into his face. Papa's a soft heart, when it comes to his daughters and especially little girls. She glances often over at her mother, though - the petition has to be run by Papa, he is the King and would make the formal pronouncement, but Hebe knows the real approval needs to come from Mama. \"I want to help, to be useful! It isn't right that all I do is play all day, while everyone else is working!\" Papa makes a slightly pained expression. \"My sweet girl, that's all we want for you - we work hard so you won't have to. There's no one on Olympus, or anywhere else in the world, who thinks ill of you for it.\" \"But I do, Papa,\" says Hebe, biting her lip. \"I want to do more.\" She's trying not to be dramatic about it - Mama and Papa do not need more drama - but she really hates being the cute decorative girl-child, forever sitting around playing dress-up. It's not that she doesn't have fun doing that, but she doesn't like it being her only future. Mama understands this part - Hebe doesn't know all of the adults' problems, but she has overheard Mama say more than once that she doesn't intend for her life to be over just because she's married now. She says she's the Queen and by Ouranos' balls, she's going to be part of running this damned cosmos, come hell or high water. She looks over at Mama, now. \"I want to be helpful. I want to be part of Olympus, even if it's just a little bit. I can bring everyone their drinks so they don't have to get up, and stand out of the way once I'm done. If everyone drinks slowly, I can even still practice writing or sew a little while I wait.\" They both settle visibly at this. They're running it through in their heads, and picturing something cute - a little girl, pretending to be part of the grown-ups' affairs, running to her brothers and sisters and aunts and uncle to carefully pour their cups, having to be called over from playing with her toys in order to attend to them. And, honestly, that will probably happen at least a couple of times. Sometimes the council topics are exciting but sometimes they're so boring that probably getting up to refill your cup is a blessed break, a chance to excuse yourself for a moment. Too bad, gods! They'll have to find a different excuse now; Hebe's got a job. Papa smiles and looks to Mama. \"Well, what about it, wife? Do you think our daughter can handle this great responsibility?\" Mama pretends to think. \"Hmm, it's difficult to say. We shall have to give her a chance to prove herself, I suppose. It would certainly be a helpful person to have around, a cupbearer.\" \"Very well.\" Papa sits upright very seriously, and Mama does too, holding her staff regally as Papa places his hand solemnly on Hebe's head. This part is serious, not silly and pretend. The job may be minor, but when a god or goddess is appointed a duty, it is a serious event. It makes Hebe shiver a little. \"As the Lord of Olympus, Ruler of all the Cosmos, and the power that comes with my burden and duty, I declare that Hebe, daughter of Hera and Zeus, will henceforth be the appointed cupbearer of the gods - to keep their cups filled, at feasts or councils. Gladdened Princess, do you accept this charge?\" Gladdened Princess is the only epithet she's earned - yet. Hebe bows her head solemnly. \"I swear upon the Styx to uphold my duties until released from this oath by Zeus the king or Hera the Queen,\" she recites. Papa's face splits open into a grin yet again, and he crushes her to him in a hug that makes her laugh when his beard tickles her neck. \"Excellent! A cupbearer at last!\" he cries, delighted with her. \"Our little baby girl, with her first domain,\" Mama says, stroking Hebe's hair. They play a quick game of hoops, to celebrate, and then Hebe excuses herself from their presence. She walks past Hermes and Auntie Hestia, who are still reclined near the Hearth and grinning at Hebe and not even pretending they hadn't been eavesdropping. \"Well, well! A cupbearer on Olympus! How very exciting!\" Auntie Hess congratulates her. \"I was getting so tired of always having to get up for my own drink!\" Hermes makes a gesture of exhaustion. \"It will be wonderful to have you be part of the council, even if only peripherally. I'm glad Zeus and Hera agreed.\" \"Oh yes, and very masterfully played, by the way,\" Hermes says with a wink. Hebe attempts to frown at Hermes, which is hard - it's difficult to say which of her brothers she likes the most, but Hermes is certainly the most fun. \"Oh, Hermes, don't be a pest,\" Hestia scolds him on Hebe's behalf, but she's smiling too. \"Look, it takes a thief to catch a thief, and I made my great debut on Olympus by overwhelming the mighty Zeus with my irresistible cuteness. Which I still retain to this day.\" Hermes is floating a couple feet in the air, ankle wings fluttering fast as he gestures grandly. He turns to Hebe again, pressing a finger alongside his nose with another exaggerated conspiratorial wink. \"Nothing wrong with using your cuteness as a weapon! I mean, it's worked great for me! - \" Hermes ignores Auntie Hestia's amused scoff. \"... but you can't fool me, kiddo!\" Well, if anyone were to figure it out, these two are probably the safest. Hebe rolls her eyes at her silly brother and stands haughtily, arms crossed. \"I'm gonna spike your drink with bitterwort,\" she informs him loftily. \"Your face is gonna go like this - \" she scrunches up her face in an impression of Hermes drinking the foul-tasting beverage, and then laughs as he scoops her up in the air and dangles her over the brook nearby, playfully growling threats to dunk her under. -------------------- In short order, Hebe is given another duty - as Mama's attendant. She is there to assist Mama getting in and out of her chariot, when she goes afield: harnessing the gold-bridled horses and yoking them to the chariot, and watching in fascination as the gold-and-silver car races off, a wonder to behold. She assists Mama in dressing - mainly by fetching the prettiest baubles to decorate her lovely hands and neck - and brushes her hair. Mama returns this favor to her, brushing Hebe's hair 100 times until it's smooth and soft. Hebe stands by Mama's side in a formal court, along with her friend Iris, to fetch and retrieve anything Mama asks for, or to help her in any other way. This is something Hebe has always wanted to do also; but when the time comes and she is appointed, it's more out of necessity than because Hebe asked. Hebe is not, in fact, the only daughter of Zeus and Hera. But her sister, Eileithyia, is fading out of consciousness quite inconveniently early, and is not around to attend to Mama. The process isn't complete yet, but it's clear that Eileithyia is planning to do it. Anytime Hebe visits her sister's rooms, assuming Eileithyia is there at all, she can be found sitting in a misty, wavering form, in a kind of trance. She's attending to her duties metaphysically, which all of the gods and goddesses do - even Hebe, who certainly doesn't show up in person every time someone is feeling youthful. But Eileithyia has recently opted to conduct her business almost entirely metaphysically, and hasn't been socially available for quite some time. She got the idea from their Grandmama Rhea, who announced that she was leaving the conscious running of the universe to the younger generation, and began fading out. She embraced her eternal concept of motherhood and does not choose to wear her personality often anymore. Eileithyia thinks that's incredibly deep and meaningful and began doing the same thing, abandoning her personality and consciousness in favor of floating in her room. It's not like she's gone - you can even have a conversation with her if you're patient enough to wait three months for her to notice you've been greeting her. But she never has much to say, since she hasn't been doing anything in so long, so Hebe rarely bothers. \"You'll see, sweet little Hebe,\" she'd said last time, in a conversation that had taken nearly six hours to complete in spite of the lack of content. \"You'll get tired of all the drama, all the arguing, all the betrayals. You'll be right here with me where there's peace and silence.\" Very tiresome. Hebe thinks all the dramatics are exciting; and even if it's hard sometimes, it's all proof of how much her family really cares about things, about each other. This is a lesson that Auntie Hess imparted to her. Though she is Mama's attendant, Hebe spends more of her time at Auntie Hess' hearth than anywhere else. Auntie Hess, like Hebe, sees value in helping others, even if it's technically beneath her. Hebe, as a cupbearer and all-around welcome face on Olympus, is privy to many more secrets than the Olympians think they're letting on, and Aunt Hestia has told her that it's a great privilege and burden to be the secret-bearer, and that she must never use her knowledge to hurt her family. She even cautions her against using it for good, at least not overtly, in case she misreads a situation and makes it worse. Subtlety and kindness will help their family to stay together in spite of their willfulness and passion, says Aunt Hestia. \"Subtlety\" seems to be the key word, and Hebe doesn't mind being discreet and sneaky, but she isn't terribly impressed with the fact that it all amounts to being a sweet, well-behaved girl. Perhaps Hebe did inherit a tiny thirst for dramatics and excitement after all. -------------- Her next great act of rebellion is also passed off as a childish game; though it's increasingly a difficult concept to sell on her parents... or, more particularly, to Mama. \"But that's her greatest domain!\" Hebe pleads. \"She spends all her time with young girls, and has adventures with them!\" \"She spends all her time in the wilderness hunting bears and boars and fighting giants; and the girls tag along,\" Mama corrects, looking stern. Mama really doesn't like Artemis, and Artemis really doesn't like Mama. They've reached a sort of truce by way of Artemis staying in her wilds and rarely interacting with Mama; but if they spend any great amount of time together, the truce falls apart. It's a shame. Hebe loves Mama, but she likes Artemis a lot, too. She wants desperately to join the virgin goddess' band of girls, going out running around and hunting and playing, and if Hermes is to be believed (a great risk), there's wrestling and swearing!! Because they don't have to be ladies, if there aren't any boys around! Obviously, Hebe has responsibilities here on Olympus. She's the cupbearer, and after only a few short years on the job, everyone's already deemed the position as indispensable! And she's still Mama's main attendant, along with Iris. She needs to be able to help Mama with her chariot and her hair and jewelry. But she longs for the ability to run around, fastfastfast, surrounded by other girls her age, independent and wild and making noise. At least just once in a while! \"It might not be a bad idea, though,\" Papa says. \"Eileithyia doesn't look like she's going to be over this phase anytime soon, and Hebe needs other girls to play with. I know you don't... approve of Artemis, but after all, that's the domain she chose, and she takes it very seriously.\" Mama sighs, rubbing her temple. \"Oh, let me consider it a little longer.\" Papa looks at Hebe, quirks his mouth and shrugs. Hebe knows. After Kore - Queen Persephone, now - Papa has decided it's not in his best interest to call all the shots on his daughters' decisions. Particularly since Mama is considerably quicker to anger than even Aunt Demeter. But Hebe has been weaponizing her cuteness for a while now. Before she even spoke to Mama and Papa today, she approached Artemis with her plan, begging her to stay on the downlow for a while so Mama wouldn't have any hard reasons to disallow Hebe to join her. Artemis was amused but agreed. After all, she said, Zeus' daughters had to stick together. \"You should just threaten to rip out his chest hair if you don't get what you want, like I did!\" she adds. Hebe giggles. It takes Hera another year or so to make up her mind, but by the time Kore is back above the ground, Hebe is there to greet her, running with the nymphs Nephele and Siproites and Hyacinthia, shouting and whooping. -------------------- Hebe is a cheerful and happy girl. She loves her Mama and Papa. She loves her Aunts Demeter and Hestia; she loves her Uncle Poseidon and she likes writing letters to Uncle Hades, though she hasn't met him yet. She loves all her brothers and sisters, no matter which one or how they get along with each other. She loves Hephaestus' forge and his big, scary, friendly Cyclopes helpers and his pretty wife Aglaia. She loves Apollo and how he brings her paintings and sings songs with her and plays duck-duck-goose with the Muses. She loves playing dress-up with Aphrodite and her naughty, silly son Eros, and the mischief they make together. She loves playing trivia games with Athena and playing with her owl friend Bubo. She loves putting on makeup with Dionysus and teasing Pan together with him. She loves racing Hermes and jumping out to scare him. She loves Artemis and the nymphs, who are like her second, part-time family. She loves them all, and would not ever pick a favorite. But she does have to admit that she has a certain special closeness to her big brother Ares. They've all sort of learned to not call too much attention to the question of whose parents they have. Most of them are some combination of Papa - that is, Zeus, plus 'someone else.' Athena was born only of Papa; Hephy was born only of Mama. But Ares is the only other one who is the child of the King and Queen both. They are the royal children (well, and Eileithyia, but she's too busy being Wise and One With The Cosmos in her room. Hopeless.). Hebe and Ares don't have much else directly in common with each other. Ares is the god of war, courage, and manliness. He's argumentative and brash; noisy and prone to fighting. He's always caught up in drama - mostly, fighting with Athena and Hephaestus and Apollo and Papa and Mama... and, well, he definitely isn't the Joy of Olympus. Hebe and Ares both have the unenviable position no one else has, of being caught exactly in the middle of Mama and Papa. Mama and Papa both equally expect Hebe and Ares to take their side when they argue; a pressure that no one else has hanging over their heads. She knows that's at least part the reason Eileithyia chose to shut down. It's a very strained sort of loneliness. Hebe endures it because all of Olympus endeavors to keep her out of it; to keep her a happy child forever. She still feels the responsibility, though. Ares feels it, too, but his flat and brusque manner, combined with his total clumsy inability to read the emotions of a room, only serves to make everyone angry with him. Ares does not have what would be his rightful place as a Prince of Olympus. Hebe isn't sure she's ever heard anyone refer to him by the title. He's gone for a long time, often; off overseeing wars and uprisings and other occasions where men and women need him to bolster their resolve. When he returns, Hebe has drawn his bath. This is their routine. It probably is a little weird, and perhaps others would deem it inappropriate. But Olympus is fueled by unseemly behavior, and Hebe herself expresses her thoughts on the matter once: \"You really shouldn't be in here when I'm taking a bath,\" Ares says, keeping a cloth around him until he sinks beneath the sudsy water, heated courtesy of a few borrowed coals from Auntie's Hearth. Hebe shrugs. She's seen him naked before; the way the gods of Olympus strut around, it's impossible to avoid. A bit of a double standard, but the reality is no one really cares if they see a man's privates. A girl learns to roll her eyes and look the other way until they manage to find an improvised chlamys for modesty's sake. \"It's not like I'm looking, brother,\" she chides, pouring water over his head. \"And I'm afraid if I leave, you'll fall asleep in the tub and drown.\" He wasn't quite ready for the water on his head, and sputters before fixing her with a stinkeye which she ignores. His hair is... well, gross. Sweaty and dirty and with more than a little blood in it. She sighs and presses a small vial of scented oil into his hand. \"Use that on your nasty hair.\" He chuckles slightly. \"Nasty, eh? Yeah, I guess that's the word for it.\" In spite of his objection, he seems too tired to really care what she's doing or where she's standing. He leans back into the tub and half-heartedly works the oil into his hair. Hebe goes to the table where she's kept his clean clothes and waits there, eyes politely looking to the window where she can see Selene and Artemis in the night sky. \"You look beat to hell, brother,\" she says, striving to always speak honestly. He laughs again, a bit louder and more sincere this time. \"Do I? Where'd you learn to talk like that, kid?\" \"I've learned a lot from Artemis' nymphs. Words like fuck, shit, bugger, cunt - \" she recites proudly. \"Okay, okay! Cut it out! People will think I've been teaching you that shit!\" Ares is still laughing to himself. \"Sheesh. One season with Arty and you're already swearing like an Amazon.\" \"She says once in a while you two hunt together. Invite me along next time?\" He's quiet for a while, and Hebe wonders if he's fallen asleep. He really does look beat to hell. He'd shuffled into the bath like an old man with all his aches; begrimed and cut up and tired. There's an unguent from Apollo's stock here in this room; maybe she can try to apply it to some of the uglier-looking bruises and swellings and cuts before he puts on his clean chiton and cloak. Ares finally answers. \"Yeah, maybe. Might be nice having another sister tagging along.\" ----------------------------- There's a certain equilibrium she's managed to achieve, and for the most part she's satisfied. She's still everyone's favorite child-princess; the delight of Olympus and the innocent playmate who stays removed from the drama. But she's apprenticed to Hestia, and knows the gossip and how to gently steer her hotheaded family away from dangerous situations and conversations. And she's gained employment, as a cupbearer and as Mama's attendant and one of Artemis' part-time virgin retinue. It's not quite as spectacular as her brothers or sisters' roles; but she isn't really ambitious. She's managed to sneak her way out of the vapid part everyone wanted her to play, and did so in a way that left no one with any major words to remark upon. No one speaks poorly of her, of course; but her domains and accomplishments are so subtle that no one thinks to praise them either. Pericles, had he been born yet, would surely approve. And she might have been content with this forever, had she not strayed a little further from Artemis' party than she meant to, one day. It's a fine, sunny day and Hebe hears the sound of a lyre on the wind. Curious, she follows the sound - maybe it's Apollo? But, Apollo's music is generally so beautiful that her feet begin dancing all of their own will. This music isn't Apollo-class. To be completely honest, it's really bad. She comes across a man who appears to be in his late twenties or early thirties, sitting atop a rock overseeing a large herd of cattle and plucking idly at a lyre. He's... not particularly beautiful. Not the way her brothers are... he's one of the biggest men she's ever seen, nearly as large as her brother Ares when he takes mortal form. Just this huge, plain-looking man sitting on a rock, watching a lot of cows, and playing the lyre badly. She really can't place what it is that intrigues her, only that... he seems interesting, somehow. His face looks kind. And he looks.... Fun. Her curiosity finally compels her to step forward and shout to catch his attention. \"Hey there! You, man! What do you call yourself?\" He looks up, unsurprised to see her - he must have known she was hiding all along. Normally this would annoy her very much. But the easy grin on his face settles any injury to her pride. \"Hey there, yourself! I call myself Alcides, thank you for your interest!\" he calls back. \"And if I may ask, what do you call yourself?\" \"You may not ask! It's a secret!\" she informs him, having the sense not to give her name away to strange men. He only laughs, unoffended. \"Very well. May I call you Lion Princess for now? Since you roar so fiercely, yet have such a regal bearing?\" She tries not to show how pleased she is. \"I suppose it will do.\" She comes closer still. \"What are you doing out here?\" \"I'm watching my father Amphitryon's cattle and killing time with a lyre.\" \"Killing music in general with that lyre!\" He laughs again. \"Harsh little Lion Princess! Well, you may be right, I'm not very good at it yet, am I? I was always getting beaten by my music master about it.\" \"That's too bad. He probably wasn't a good teacher.\" Alcides shrugs. \"I think my talents lie elsewhere than music. But it's fun to play anyway, sometimes, don't you think, Lion Princess? Even if I'm not the best at it.\" He likes fun for its own sake. Hebe grins back at him. \"I do think so! And I'm glad you're enjoying yourself, even if you're a terrible musician! But Alcides, what are your talents, then? Looking at cows?\" \"I'm great at looking at cows! No one's better!\" he puts his chest out exaggeratedly as he boasts, making her laugh. \"But actually, I think my greatest talent might be... discus. Do you play, Lion Princess?\" She claps her hands excitedly. \"Yes! Have you got one on you now? Throw it here!\" He softballs it, of course, but she'll let it slide for now. Hebe's only excited to be playing the game. She races across the lawn, dodging stray cows and catching the discus triumphantly while Alcides cheers. Hebe flings it back at him. He catches it - but pretends that the force of her throw knocked him backwards, clear off the rock. She laughs again and runs over to see where he's fallen - only to shriek in surprise as he jumps out from behind the rock to scare her. Alcides laughs along with her, not unkindly - just as though he's sharing the joke with her, and he graciously accepts it when she flings a fistful of weeds at him. \"You - you rascal!\" she scolds around her mirth. Alcides bows deeply. \"Guilty as charged, my lady.\" They throw the discus back and forth a few times, and Hebe teaches him the simple notes to a song she likes - a little composition about a bee and a bear. Alcides teaches her a joke about a man who was outwitted by his donkey. They formally exchange gifts - he gives her a shiny pebble, in an unusual color of green; she gives him a chain of clovers. Grandpa Helios is nearly done with his voyage across the sky, so Hebe takes her leave of the funny man, who bows again and bids farewell to the Lion Princess. She's skipping back to Artemis' camp, happy and in fine spirits, and won't find out the scope of the drama she's landed herself in until later.",

      "In short order, Hebe is given another duty - as Mama's attendant.",
      "She is there to assist Mama getting in and out of her chariot, when she goes afield: harnessing the gold-bridled horses and yoking them to the chariot, and watching in fascination as the gold-and-silver car races off, a wonder to behold.",

      "Mama returns this favor to her, brushing Hebe's hair 100 times until it's smooth and soft.",
      "Hebe stands by Mama's side in a formal court, along with her friend Iris, to fetch and retrieve anything Mama asks for, or to help her in any other way.",
      "This is something Hebe has always wanted to do also; but when the time comes and she is appointed, it's more out of necessity than because Hebe asked.",
      "Hebe is not, in fact, the only daughter of Zeus and Hera.",
      "But her sister, Eileithyia, is fading out of consciousness quite inconveniently early, and is not around to attend to Mama.",
      "The process isn't complete yet, but it's clear that Eileithyia is planning to do it.",
      "Anytime Hebe visits her sister's rooms, assuming Eileithyia is there at all, she can be found sitting in a misty, wavering form, in a kind of trance.",
      "She's attending to her duties metaphysically, which all of the gods and goddesses do - even Hebe, who certainly doesn't show up in person every time someone is feeling youthful.",
      "But Eileithyia has recently opted to conduct her business almost entirely metaphysically, and hasn't been socially available for quite some time.",
      "She got the idea from their Grandmama Rhea, who announced that she was leaving the conscious running of the universe to the younger generation, and began fading out.",
      "She embraced her eternal concept of motherhood and does not choose to wear her personality often anymore.",
      "Eileithyia thinks that's incredibly deep and meaningful and began doing the same thing, abandoning her personality and consciousness in favor of floating in her room.",
      "It's not like she's gone - you can even have a conversation with her if you're patient enough to wait three months for her to notice you've been greeting her.",
      "But she never has much to say, since she hasn't been doing anything in so long, so Hebe rarely bothers.",
      "\"You'll see, sweet little Hebe,\" she'd said last time, in a conversation that had taken nearly six hours to complete in spite of the lack of content.",

      "Auntie Hess, like Hebe, sees value in helping others, even if it's technically beneath her.",
      "Hebe, as a cupbearer and all-around welcome face on Olympus, is privy to many more secrets than the Olympians think they're letting on, and Aunt Hestia has told her that it's a great privilege and burden to be the secret-bearer, and that she must never use her knowledge to hurt her family.",
      "She even cautions her against using it for good, at least not overtly, in case she misreads a situation and makes it worse.",
      "Subtlety and kindness will help their family to stay together in spite of their willfulness and passion, says Aunt Hestia.",
      "\"Subtlety\" seems to be the key word, and Hebe doesn't mind being discreet and sneaky, but she isn't terribly impressed with the fact that it all amounts to being a sweet, well-behaved girl.",
      "Perhaps Hebe did inherit a tiny thirst for dramatics and excitement after all.",
      "-------------- Her next great act of rebellion is also passed off as a childish game; though it's increasingly a difficult concept to sell on her parents... or, more particularly, to Mama.",

      "They've reached a sort of truce by way of Artemis staying in her wilds and rarely interacting with Mama; but if they spend any great amount of time together, the truce falls apart.",
      "It's a shame.",
      "Hebe loves Mama, but she likes Artemis a lot, too.",
      "She wants desperately to join the virgin goddess' band of girls, going out running around and hunting and playing, and if Hermes is to be believed (a great risk), there's wrestling and swearing!!",
      "Because they don't have to be ladies, if there aren't any boys around!",
      "Obviously, Hebe has responsibilities here on Olympus.",
      "She's the cupbearer, and after only a few short years on the job, everyone's already deemed the position as indispensable!",
      "And she's still Mama's main attendant, along with Iris.",

      "Before she even spoke to Mama and Papa today, she approached Artemis with her plan, begging her to stay on the downlow for a while so Mama wouldn't have any hard reasons to disallow Hebe to join her.",

      "-------------------- Hebe is a cheerful and happy girl.",
      "She loves her Mama and Papa.",
      "She loves her Aunts Demeter and Hestia; she loves her Uncle Poseidon and she likes writing letters to Uncle Hades, though she hasn't met him yet.",
      "She loves all her brothers and sisters, no matter which one or how they get along with each other.",
      "She loves Hephaestus' forge and his big, scary, friendly Cyclopes helpers and his pretty wife Aglaia.",
      "She loves Apollo and how he brings her paintings and sings songs with her and plays duck-duck-goose with the Muses.",
      "She loves playing dress-up with Aphrodite and her naughty, silly son Eros, and the mischief they make together.",
      "She loves playing trivia games with Athena and playing with her owl friend Bubo.",
      "She loves putting on makeup with Dionysus and teasing Pan together with him.",
      "She loves racing Hermes and jumping out to scare him.",
      "She loves Artemis and the nymphs, who are like her second, part-time family.",
      "She loves them all, and would not ever pick a favorite.",
      "But she does have to admit that she has a certain special closeness to her big brother Ares.",
      "They've all sort of learned to not call too much attention to the question of whose parents they have.",
      "Most of them are some combination of Papa - that is, Zeus, plus 'someone else.'",
      "Athena was born only of Papa; Hephy was born only of Mama.",
      "But Ares is the only other one who is the child of the King and Queen both.",
      "They are the royal children (well, and Eileithyia, but she's too busy being Wise and One With The Cosmos in her room.",
      "Hopeless.).",
      "Hebe and Ares don't have much else directly in common with each other.",
      "Ares is the god of war, courage, and manliness.",
      "He's argumentative and brash; noisy and prone to fighting.",
      "He's always caught up in drama - mostly, fighting with Athena and Hephaestus and Apollo and Papa and Mama... and, well, he definitely isn't the Joy of Olympus.",
      "Hebe and Ares both have the unenviable position no one else has, of being caught exactly in the middle of Mama and Papa.",
      "Mama and Papa both equally expect Hebe and Ares to take their side when they argue; a pressure that no one else has hanging over their heads.",
      "She knows that's at least part the reason Eileithyia chose to shut down.",
      "It's a very strained sort of loneliness.",
      "Hebe endures it because all of Olympus endeavors to keep her out of it; to keep her a happy child forever.",
      "She still feels the responsibility, though.",
      "Ares feels it, too, but his flat and brusque manner, combined with his total clumsy inability to read the emotions of a room, only serves to make everyone angry with him.",
      "Ares does not have what would be his rightful place as a Prince of Olympus.",
      "Hebe isn't sure she's ever heard anyone refer to him by the title.",
      "He's gone for a long time, often; off overseeing wars and uprisings and other occasions where men and women need him to bolster their resolve.",
      "When he returns, Hebe has drawn his bath.",
      "This is their routine.",
      "It probably is a little weird, and perhaps others would deem it inappropriate.",
      "But Olympus is fueled by unseemly behavior, and Hebe herself expresses her thoughts on the matter once: \"You really shouldn't be in here when I'm taking a bath,\" Ares says, keeping a cloth around him until he sinks beneath the sudsy water, heated courtesy of a few borrowed coals from Auntie's Hearth.",
      "Hebe shrugs.",
      "She's seen him naked before; the way the gods of Olympus strut around, it's impossible to avoid.",
      "A bit of a double standard, but the reality is no one really cares if they see a man's privates.",
      "A girl learns to roll her eyes and look the other way until they manage to find an improvised chlamys for modesty's sake.",
      "\"It's not like I'm looking, brother,\" she chides, pouring water over his head.",
      "\"And I'm afraid if I leave, you'll fall asleep in the tub and drown.\"",
      "He wasn't quite ready for the water on his head, and sputters before fixing her with a stinkeye which she ignores.",
      "His hair is... well, gross.",
      "Sweaty and dirty and with more than a little blood in it.",
      "She sighs and presses a small vial of scented oil into his hand.",
      "\"Use that on your nasty hair.\"",
      "He chuckles slightly.",
      "\"Nasty, eh?",
      "Yeah, I guess that's the word for it.\"",
      "In spite of his objection, he seems too tired to really care what she's doing or where she's standing.",
      "He leans back into the tub and half-heartedly works the oil into his hair.",
      "Hebe goes to the table where she's kept his clean clothes and waits there, eyes politely looking to the window where she can see Selene and Artemis in the night sky.",
      "\"You look beat to hell, brother,\" she says, striving to always speak honestly.",
      "He laughs again, a bit louder and more sincere this time.",
      "\"Do I?",
      "Where'd you learn to talk like that, kid?\"",
      "\"I've learned a lot from Artemis' nymphs.",
      "Words like fuck, shit, bugger, cunt - \" she recites proudly.",
      "\"Okay, okay!",
      "Cut it out!",
      "People will think I've been teaching you that shit!\"",
      "Ares is still laughing to himself.",
      "\"Sheesh.",
      "One season with Arty and you're already swearing like an Amazon.\"",
      "\"She says once in a while you two hunt together.",
      "Invite me along next time?\"",
      "He's quiet for a while, and Hebe wonders if he's fallen asleep.",
      "He really does look beat to hell.",
      "He'd shuffled into the bath like an old man with all his aches; begrimed and cut up and tired.",
      "There's an unguent from Apollo's stock here in this room; maybe she can try to apply it to some of the uglier-looking bruises and swellings and cuts before he puts on his clean chiton and cloak.",
      "Ares finally answers.",
      "\"Yeah, maybe.",
      "Might be nice having another sister tagging along.\"",
      "----------------------------- There's a certain equilibrium she's managed to achieve, and for the most part she's satisfied.",
      "She's still everyone's favorite child-princess; the delight of Olympus and the innocent playmate who stays removed from the drama.",
      "But she's apprenticed to Hestia, and knows the gossip and how to gently steer her hotheaded family away from dangerous situations and conversations.",
      "And she's gained employment, as a cupbearer and as Mama's attendant and one of Artemis' part-time virgin retinue.",
      "It's not quite as spectacular as her brothers or sisters' roles; but she isn't really ambitious.",
      "She's managed to sneak her way out of the vapid part everyone wanted her to play, and did so in a way that left no one with any major words to remark upon.",
      "No one speaks poorly of her, of course; but her domains and accomplishments are so subtle that no one thinks to praise them either.",
      "Pericles, had he been born yet, would surely approve.",
      "And she might have been content with this forever, had she not strayed a little further from Artemis' party than she meant to, one day.",
      "It's a fine, sunny day and Hebe hears the sound of a lyre on the wind.",
      "Curious, she follows the sound - maybe it's Apollo?",
      "But, Apollo's music is generally so beautiful that her feet begin dancing all of their own will.",
      "This music isn't Apollo-class.",
      "To be completely honest, it's really bad.",
      "She comes across a man who appears to be in his late twenties or early thirties, sitting atop a rock overseeing a large herd of cattle and plucking idly at a lyre.",
      "He's... not particularly beautiful.",
      "Not the way her brothers are... he's one of the biggest men she's ever seen, nearly as large as her brother Ares when he takes mortal form.",
      "Just this huge, plain-looking man sitting on a rock, watching a lot of cows, and playing the lyre badly.",
      "She really can't place what it is that intrigues her, only that... he seems interesting, somehow.",
      "His face looks kind.",
      "And he looks.... Fun.",
      "Her curiosity finally compels her to step forward and shout to catch his attention.",
      "\"Hey there!",
      "You, man!",
      "What do you call yourself?\"",
      "He looks up, unsurprised to see her - he must have known she was hiding all along.",
      "Normally this would annoy her very much.",
      "But the easy grin on his face settles any injury to her pride.",
      "\"Hey there, yourself!",
      "I call myself Alcides, thank you for your interest!\"",
      "he calls back.",
      "\"And if I may ask, what do you call yourself?\"",
      "\"You may not ask!",
      "It's a secret!\"",
      "she informs him, having the sense not to give her name away to strange men.",
      "He only laughs, unoffended.",
      "\"Very well.",
      "May I call you Lion Princess for now?",
      "Since you roar so fiercely, yet have such a regal bearing?\"",
      "She tries not to show how pleased she is.",
      "\"I suppose it will do.\"",
      "She comes closer still.",
      "\"What are you doing out here?\"",
      "\"I'm watching my father Amphitryon's cattle and killing time with a lyre.\"",
      "\"Killing music in general with that lyre!\"",
      "He laughs again.",
      "\"Harsh little Lion Princess!",
      "Well, you may be right, I'm not very good at it yet, am I?",
      "I was always getting beaten by my music master about it.\"",
      "\"That's too bad.",
      "He probably wasn't a good teacher.\"",
      "Alcides shrugs.",
      "\"I think my talents lie elsewhere than music.",
      "But it's fun to play anyway, sometimes, don't you think, Lion Princess?",
      "Even if I'm not the best at it.\"",
      "He likes fun for its own sake.",
      "Hebe grins back at him.",
      "\"I do think so!",
      "And I'm glad you're enjoying yourself, even if you're a terrible musician!",
      "But Alcides, what are your talents, then?",
      "Looking at cows?\"",
      "\"I'm great at looking at cows!",
      "No one's better!\"",
      "he puts his chest out exaggeratedly as he boasts, making her laugh.",
      "\"But actually, I think my greatest talent might be... discus.",
      "Do you play, Lion Princess?\"",
      "She claps her hands excitedly.",
      "\"Yes!",
      "Have you got one on you now?",
      "Throw it here!\"",
      "He softballs it, of course, but she'll let it slide for now.",
      "Hebe's only excited to be playing the game.",
      "She races across the lawn, dodging stray cows and catching the discus triumphantly while Alcides cheers.",
      "Hebe flings it back at him.",
      "He catches it - but pretends that the force of her throw knocked him backwards, clear off the rock.",
      "She laughs again and runs over to see where he's fallen - only to shriek in surprise as he jumps out from behind the rock to scare her.",
      "Alcides laughs along with her, not unkindly - just as though he's sharing the joke with her, and he graciously accepts it when she flings a fistful of weeds at him.",
      "\"You - you rascal!\"",
      "she scolds around her mirth.",
      "Alcides bows deeply.",
      "\"Guilty as charged, my lady.\"",
      "They throw the discus back and forth a few times, and Hebe teaches him the simple notes to a song she likes - a little composition about a bee and a bear.",
      "Alcides teaches her a joke about a man who was outwitted by his donkey.",
      "They formally exchange gifts - he gives her a shiny pebble, in an unusual color of green; she gives him a chain of clovers.",
      "Grandpa Helios is nearly done with his voyage across the sky, so Hebe takes her leave of the funny man, who bows again and bids farewell to the Lion Princess.",
      "She's skipping back to Artemis' camp, happy and in fine spirits, and won't find out the scope of the drama she's landed herself in until later."

    "text": "It's not so bad, this time. It's the third occasion when Apollo's been banished to grub about on the earth with the mortals. Punishment for opposing Zeus' will, once again. It's not as though Apollo is loving this latest mortal excursion; but this time has been... really, not so bad. It helps, that he's been assigned to Admetus, who's possibly the most kind and gracious man ever to live. Although Admetus is obligated to carry out the terms of Zeus' punishment, and order the errant god about as a servant; he nonetheless has shown respect and courtesy for Apollo, and Apollo fully intends to return this with blessings when he has his godhood restored to him. It's additionally better this time, on earth, since Artemis sent a nymph to discreetly tell him that Asclepius has been resurrected, along with the slain Cyclopes. The nymph wasn't privy to the details, but apparently something had been worked out between Asclepius and Zeus. It still bothers Apollo that his son is beholden to Zeus in any way, but at this point, he's just happy his beloved boy is returned. Therefore, this jaunt on earth isn't so bad. In fact, it's almost relaxing! No godly duties; no Olympian melodramatics; no residual sorrow over the loss of his son. His master is kind; the duties easy. Nothing for Apollo to do but kick back and enjoy the fine weather as he watches some sheep and dozes now and then, and waits for Zeus to get over his anger. It's all very pastoral and peaceful. He could get used to this. He's composed several songs about the experience, in fact - \"HERDSMAN!! HEY! IT'S ME! OVER HERE! OVER HERE, HERDSMAN!\" Apollo closes his eyes; wonders if he pretends to be asleep or maybe dead, the kid will just leave. The little Spartan prince came upon Apollo a few days ago, while the former god was singing one of his newly-composed songs, and has been smitten with the former god ever since. It's a cute little mortal, to be sure; and Apollo is familiar with being the object of a crush, but Ouranos' balls - this kid hasn't stopped pestering him since! \"Herdsman!\" Hyacinthus has jogged over. \"Were you about to sing again? You looked like you were in position to sing, right?\" Apollo doesn't open his eyes. \"No.\" ------------------- Hyacinthus cheers, puffing out his chest and strutting around, ridiculously proud of managing to hit one stupid apple from a hundred yards. Any fool could do as much - Apollo himself could have shot a dozen apples from a hundred times that distance, tossed at varying speeds in any direction, before they'd even reached the apex of their flight. The little Spartan prince swaggers over to where Apollo is sitting on a rock. \"Well, herdsman? What do you think of that? Pretty amazing, right?\" The kid's slow-drawled Spartan accent never fails to amuse, but Apollo hides his smile. He pauses - counting to three before replying. The exact right amount of time: not too long, not too short. He won't allow himself to appear too interested... but, something makes him want to not shut Hyacinthus down completely. \"Ahh, yes, Prince. It was an excellent shot.\" Hyacinthus frowns. \"it was a fantastic shot! You think you could do any better, herdsman?!\" He doesn't know Apollo's name yet. Apollo had declined to share it, that first day, in hopes that he'd never see the annoying brat again. But persistence features strongly among Spartan virtues, apparently, and Hyacinthus has only carried on unfazed and referring to Apollo by his job: Herdsman. Apollo leans back, hair blowing in the wind. \"I wouldn't dare to compete with the Prince of Sparta,\" he replies after another pause. ------------------- \"Will you sing again, herdsman?\" Hyacinthus asks every so often, tone varying with each occasion. Bossily; expectantly; curiously; teasingly. He's caught Apollo singing a couple of days, sneaking up upon the former god as he sings for an audience of sheep. Apollo's answer has been the same every time - \"No.\" His talents would be nearly as wasted on a Spartan as they are on the sheep. He's sure Hyacinthus can't sing anything himself; save, perhaps, for marching jodies. Still, he finds himself relenting a little as the prince keeps asking. It's hard to keep saying no to someone who's clearly eager to hear his beautiful voice. -------------------- Rope gripped tight in his hands, Hyacinthus shrieks in delight as he swings out over the water. The hands release at the furthest point of the arc, and the youth drops into the river. He pops up again a moment later, spitting water and laughing. Unseen by Hyacinthus - but clearly seen by Apollo - the god of this river, and several assorted nymphs (probably his daughters) are watching Hyacinthus with open interest. Overhead, Zephyrus the west wind gives pause as well. Apollo fixes a heated glare upon the lustful immortals. I may be mortal now, but I won't be forever, he says with his frown. It's not a guaranteed intimidation tactic: sometimes, to an immortal, it might be worth any later punishment just to get a kick in to an Olympian while the kicking's possible. Just to be able to say they did. But this time, at least, they subside; and Apollo turns his attention back to the boy, who is returning to shore. Hyacinthus' swimming strokes are efficient and powerful. He's clearly trained for it, beyond the usual youthful horsing about in the water. \"Did you see, herdsman?\" he asks excitedly. \"The splash I made? Probably the biggest splash anyone's made ever, right?\" \"Save for Poseidon, I suppose.\" Hyacinthus makes a face. \"You're such a killjoy! I would have thought someone as pretty as you, with such a pretty voice, would have more to be happy about.\" Hyacinthus lifts himself from the water. He's nude - of course, since he was swimming. He's attractive, and if he were a god, Apollo would probably be seducing him for fun. He hasn't ruled it out yet. He finds he enjoys simply seeing the artful arrangement that is Hyacinthus' body. A Spartan in the prime of his youth has a nearly flawless physique; and Hyacinthus has pleasing features besides. But letting this cocky prince know it? Never. \"There isn't too much to be excited about, watching sheep,\" Apollo replies, glancing off with more disinterest than he actually feels; looking at the flock as they mill about drinking from the river. \"Well that's the problem, dummy,\" Hyacinthus says. Apollo glances over and suddenly finds himself facing Hyacinthus, exactly groin-height as the young man has stepped over to stand before Apollo where he sits upon the rock. Apollo's eyes widen, and an unexpected blush of color touches his cheeks. A hand cups his chin, tilting his face up. Hyacinthus is grinning at him. \"Yeah, exactly. Much more interesting to be watching me, right?\" Apollo jerks his head away, face flushing deeper. Damn this idiot Spartan! \"Not interesting at all!\" --------------------- Another flip and twist, and a sensation of motion, and Apollo is on his back again, with the Spartan prince's infuriatingly charming grin above him. \"Aaaaaaand that's five times out of five! Hyacinthus wins again!\" the arrogant little shit sings out. Apollo tries, uselessly, to escape the pin; then slumps to the ground, disgusted with himself. His feeble mortal body, defeated with embarrassing ease by this - this - \"Aww, come on,\" Hyacinthus coos, leaning down to kiss Apollo's nose. \"I'm a Spartan! You'd have to be a hell of a lucky guy to beat me at wrestling!\" \"Lucky, or a god,\" Apollo says, making plans. \"Or a god,\" Hyacinthus concedes, letting Apollo up. \"Maybe.\" \"'Maybe?'\" Apollo smiles sweetly, planning harder. \"All right, probably a god could beat me in wrestling,\" the prince casually blasphemes, \"I mean, god-strength, right? But I bet I'd still give him something to think about!\" \"Oh, I'm sure you could,\" Apollo says. ---------------------- \"It's the krupteia,\" Hyacinthus says, the body of the boar cooking nearby. He'd killed the furious beast himself; shoving Apollo out of the way of the charging creature and spearing it through with a practiced ease. Apollo didn't truly believe he was in danger. He knows that at least a half dozen deities are watching him at any given moment, and he doesn't believe Artemis or Hermes would allow him to die. Especially not in such an ignoble manner. But Hyacinthus is truly mortal, without any deities guarding him; and watching the boy charge forward to spear such a fearsome boar was... a bit harrowing. It leads to Apollo scolding Hyacinthus as he wraps a cut on his leg; which leads to Hyacinthus scoffing indulgently; which leads to an explanation, finally, of why a Spartan prince is way the hell up in Thessaly with apparently unlimited free time. \"The krupteia is where all the Spartan boys, starting at sixteen years, we all go off into the wilderness and fend for ourselves for two years. And when we come back, we're considered men.\" This sounds familiar to Apollo, but he has admittedly paid less attention to Sparta than other cities. \"So... you just, leave? You're cast out of your home and left to survive or die on your own?\" Hyacinthus makes a face. \"You make it sound so grim! It's just how it's done. We go out and kill bears, lions... boars, whatever. Live off the land, fight highwaymen and terrorize the local farmers. You know. Typical stuff.\" \"Ah. Terrorizing hard-working farmers and herders? I'm starting to see where I fit in,\" Apollo says dryly. Hyacinthus laughs, unabashed. \"Well, yeah. But I came all the way up here because - well, I'm a prince. I thought I should have more to show for my krupteia than just wandering around ten miles from home.\" \"So you took to the road... all the way to Thessaly...\" In spite of himself, Apollo is impressed. That's no easy trek, for a mortal. \"I was headed even further,\" Hyacinthus says, \"but I heard the voice of - it sounded as sweet as Apollo himself, over here among the sheep.\" He has no idea; doesn't realize who Apollo is - as far as Hyacinthus is aware, he's just talking to 'the herdsman.' But hearing his name spoken in that lazy Spartan drawl gives Apollo a small shiver. If the prince notices, he doesn't remark. Hyacinthus only lays back, and somewhat boldly places his head in Apollo's lap. Hyacinthus waits, as though for an objection. Apollo doesn't object. \"Will you sing again?\" Hyacinthus asks. His voice is hopeful, this time. \"Very well,\" Apollo says. ---------------------------- \"It's been great, honestly,\" Hyacinthus says. They're sprawled over each other, limbs tangled, under the shade of a tree. \"A nice break from all the fighting and training.\" \"You still go out to fight and train, though....\" When Hyacinthus isn't here with Apollo, he's generally out picking fights with bandits, or hunting, or going through his training routine. Every day a new injury. \"Right, but I mean when I'm not doing that. When I'm here. Normally... normally, I don't get to just sit around, swimming and singing and wrestling. It's always about training for war.\" He sighs. \"So coming here has been great. I kinda - look, don't tell anyone? I kinda wish I could stay. This is nice. Just fooling around, singing songs.\" Apollo traces a finger over broad Spartan shoulders, deeply tanned from the sun. \"I know what you mean. I didn't say this before, but... I'm actually here, serving Admetus, because my father is angry with me. I suppose I'm meant to be learning humility, but mainly I'm just enjoying the break from all the drama and arguing. It's been a greatly enjoyable summer.\" Hyacinthus takes Apollo's hand and they lie there companionably for a while. Hyacinthus breaks the silence after a few minutes: \"So.... Are you ever gonna tell me your name, herdsman?\" Apollo smirks. \"When the time is right, sweet prince.\" Hyacinthus rolls his eyes. \"As obstinate as you are pretty,\" he says, leaning in for a kiss. ----------------------------------------- Eventually - as he'd known would happen - Apollo is summoned to Olympus again, and his godhood restored. Apollo is joyously reunited with his sister; his mother; his dearest friend Hermes; the Muses; Helios. Zeus seems wary of Apollo's good mood but truly, Apollo feels more free and happy than he has in many years. There is a great feast in the halls of the palace, welcoming him back; and Apollo sings the songs he's composed about his life as a herdsman. He greets his son Asclepius with tears in his eyes. Whatever deal was made with Zeus, it was worth it to have such a brilliant and kind-hearted soul back in the world - and upgraded to a god, no less! Apollo couldn't be prouder of his second-most-talented son (after Chiron, of course). Apollo returns to Thessaly and begins to repay Admetus for his kindnesses - beginning with a fairly simple task of yoking a boar and a lion together to a chariot, which the king can then drive to Iolcus in order to impress the princess there - Alcestis. All this is accomplished in the span of about two weeks, by which time a broken-hearted and lonely Hyacinthus has already begun the journey back to Sparta, to finish his krupteia there. It's unfortunate that Apollo was recalled too quickly to be able to tell him where he was going; but Apollo intends to make it up to the boy. He appears in the middle of the road, directly in front of Hyacinthus, whose eyes boggle. \"H-herdsman?! W-what the hell! You just - you shithead! You completely vanished - I thought - you- \" Hyacinthus splutters. \"Yes, I apologize for that. When my father summons, I don't really have the option of telling him to wait,\" Apollo says. There are at least a million and twelve sexy and/or snarky things he wants to say, but they can wait a few minutes. He holds out his arms, smiling at Hyacinthus. \"I missed you.\" Hyacinthus stands there dumbly for only a moment longer before charging into Apollo's embrace, grinning bright as the sun. \"You rotten little bastard - I'm so glad to see - woh,\" he interrupts himself, prodding at Apollo in surprise. \"You got - really strong somehow...?\" Apollo's smile widens. \"Ahh, yes. About that.\" He swirls into motion, just a little too quickly for Hyacinthus to see what's happening, and lands them on the soft grass next to the road, Hyacinthus pinned on his back. The prince's eyes are huge. \"What. The. Hell,\" he manages, looking bewildered. \"I think that the time is right, now, to tell you my name,\" Apollo says. He's been dying for this moment to arrive for months. He smiles beatifically down at the boy. \"My name... is Apollo,\" he says. Hyacinthus blinks, working this out. \"You... were named after the god...?\" He finally ventures. Apollo laughs in spite of himself. \"No, you slow-witted Spartan, I amthe god!\" he scolds through his chuckles. Hyacinthus' eyes go bigger still, if such a thing is possible, and for a brief moment he looks nervous. Only a brief moment, though. Apollo might have enjoyed making him squirm a few months ago, when he only saw a cocky, noisy, dull Spartan boy. Now, though, he lays his head down on Hyacinthus' chest, feeling the heart beat beneath him. \"You were right, as it turns out,\" he says. \"You gave a god quite a lot to think about.\" \"Uh.....\" Hyacinthus offers uncertainly. \"I enjoyed this summer more than any of the hundreds of others that came before it,\" Apollo tells him, looking up to see the nervousness give way to a growing delight. \"Come with me. Let's play. I'm going to kick your ass at everything.\" Hyacinthus laughs. \"Pfft, I dunno! I saw you try all summer!\" \"You saw a human try. The tables are turnt, dear prince. I will demand three kisses for every one of your records I smash.\" \"And if I beat you?\" Hyacinthus challenges. It's blasphemy. Apollo of last year wouldn't have tolerated it. Apollo of this year only grins, pleased, and winks. \"I'll give you something to think about,\" he promises. \"Then let's get to it.... Apollo,\" Hyacinthus says, and the sound of his name from the slow drawl drives Apollo to kiss him, again and again, happy as he's ever been, perhaps as happy as he'll ever be.",

      "Apollo's answer has been the same every time - \"No.\"",
      "His talents would be nearly as wasted on a Spartan as they are on the sheep.",
      "He's sure Hyacinthus can't sing anything himself; save, perhaps, for marching jodies.",
      "Still, he finds himself relenting a little as the prince keeps asking.",
      "It's hard to keep saying no to someone who's clearly eager to hear his beautiful voice.",
      "-------------------- Rope gripped tight in his hands, Hyacinthus shrieks in delight as he swings out over the water.",
      "The hands release at the furthest point of the arc, and the youth drops into the river.",
      "He pops up again a moment later, spitting water and laughing.",
      "Unseen by Hyacinthus - but clearly seen by Apollo - the god of this river, and several assorted nymphs (probably his daughters) are watching Hyacinthus with open interest.",
      "Overhead, Zephyrus the west wind gives pause as well.",
      "Apollo fixes a heated glare upon the lustful immortals.",
      "I may be mortal now, but I won't be forever, he says with his frown.",
      "It's not a guaranteed intimidation tactic: sometimes, to an immortal, it might be worth any later punishment just to get a kick in to an Olympian while the kicking's possible.",
      "Just to be able to say they did.",
      "But this time, at least, they subside; and Apollo turns his attention back to the boy, who is returning to shore.",
      "Hyacinthus' swimming strokes are efficient and powerful.",
      "He's clearly trained for it, beyond the usual youthful horsing about in the water.",
      "\"Did you see, herdsman?\" he asks excitedly.",
      "\"The splash I made?",
      "Probably the biggest splash anyone's made ever, right?\"",
      "\"Save for Poseidon, I suppose.\"",
      "Hyacinthus makes a face.",
      "\"You're such a killjoy!",
      "I would have thought someone as pretty as you, with such a pretty voice, would have more to be happy about.\"",
      "Hyacinthus lifts himself from the water.",
      "He's nude - of course, since he was swimming.",
      "He's attractive, and if he were a god, Apollo would probably be seducing him for fun.",
      "He hasn't ruled it out yet.",
      "He finds he enjoys simply seeing the artful arrangement that is Hyacinthus' body.",
      "A Spartan in the prime of his youth has a nearly flawless physique; and Hyacinthus has pleasing features besides.",
      "But letting this cocky prince know it?",
      "Never.",
      "\"There isn't too much to be excited about, watching sheep,\" Apollo replies, glancing off with more disinterest than he actually feels; looking at the flock as they mill about drinking from the river.",
      "\"Well that's the problem, dummy,\" Hyacinthus says.",
      "Apollo glances over and suddenly finds himself facing Hyacinthus, exactly groin-height as the young man has stepped over to stand before Apollo where he sits upon the rock.",
      "Apollo's eyes widen, and an unexpected blush of color touches his cheeks.",
      "A hand cups his chin, tilting his face up.",
      "Hyacinthus is grinning at him.",
      "\"Yeah, exactly.",
      "Much more interesting to be watching me, right?\"",
      "Apollo jerks his head away, face flushing deeper.",
      "Damn this idiot Spartan!",
      "\"Not interesting at all!\"",
      "--------------------- Another flip and twist, and a sensation of motion, and Apollo is on his back again, with the Spartan prince's infuriatingly charming grin above him.",
      "\"Aaaaaaand that's five times out of five!",
      "Hyacinthus wins again!\"",
      "the arrogant little shit sings out.",
      "Apollo tries, uselessly, to escape the pin; then slumps to the ground, disgusted with himself.",
      "His feeble mortal body, defeated with embarrassing ease by this - this - \"Aww, come on,\" Hyacinthus coos, leaning down to kiss Apollo's nose.",
      "\"I'm a Spartan!",
      "You'd have to be a hell of a lucky guy to beat me at wrestling!\"",
      "\"Lucky, or a god,\" Apollo says, making plans.",
      "\"Or a god,\" Hyacinthus concedes, letting Apollo up.",
      "\"Maybe.\"",
      "\"'Maybe?'\" Apollo smiles sweetly, planning harder.",
      "\"All right, probably a god could beat me in wrestling,\" the prince casually blasphemes, \"I mean, god-strength, right?",
      "But I bet I'd still give him something to think about!\"",
      "\"Oh, I'm sure you could,\" Apollo says.",
      "----------------------",
      "\"It's the krupteia,\" Hyacinthus says, the body of the boar cooking nearby.",
      "He'd killed the furious beast himself; shoving Apollo out of the way of the charging creature and spearing it through with a practiced ease.",
      "Apollo didn't truly believe he was in danger.",
      "He knows that at least a half dozen deities are watching him at any given moment, and he doesn't believe Artemis or Hermes would allow him to die.",
      "Especially not in such an ignoble manner.",
      "But Hyacinthus is truly mortal, without any deities guarding him; and watching the boy charge forward to spear such a fearsome boar was... a bit harrowing.",
      "It leads to Apollo scolding Hyacinthus as he wraps a cut on his leg; which leads to Hyacinthus scoffing indulgently; which leads to an explanation, finally, of why a Spartan prince is way the hell up in Thessaly with apparently unlimited free time.",
      "\"The krupteia is where all the Spartan boys, starting at sixteen years, we all go off into the wilderness and fend for ourselves for two years.",
      "And when we come back, we're considered men.\"",
      "This sounds familiar to Apollo, but he has admittedly paid less attention to Sparta than other cities.",
      "\"So... you just, leave?",
      "You're cast out of your home and left to survive or die on your own?\" Hyacinthus makes a face.",
      "\"You make it sound so grim!",
      "It's just how it's done.",
      "We go out and kill bears, lions... boars, whatever.",
      "Live off the land, fight highwaymen and terrorize the local farmers.",
      "You know.",
      "Typical stuff.\"",
      "\"Ah.",
      "Terrorizing hard-working farmers and herders?",
      "I'm starting to see where I fit in,\" Apollo says dryly.",
      "Hyacinthus laughs, unabashed.",
      "\"Well, yeah.",
      "But I came all the way up here because - well, I'm a prince.",
      "I thought I should have more to show for my krupteia than just wandering around ten miles from home.\"",
      "\"So you took to the road... all the way to Thessaly...\" In spite of himself, Apollo is impressed.",
      "That's no easy trek, for a mortal.",
      "\"I was headed even further,\" Hyacinthus says, \"but I heard the voice of - it sounded as sweet as Apollo himself, over here among the sheep.\"",
      "He has no idea; doesn't realize who Apollo is - as far as Hyacinthus is aware, he's just talking to 'the herdsman.'",
      "But hearing his name spoken in that lazy Spartan drawl gives Apollo a small shiver.",
      "If the prince notices, he doesn't remark.",
      "Hyacinthus only lays back, and somewhat boldly places his head in Apollo's lap.",
      "Hyacinthus waits, as though for an objection.",
      "Apollo doesn't object.",
      "\"Will you sing again?\" Hyacinthus asks.",
      "His voice is hopeful, this time.",
      "\"Very well,\" Apollo says.",
      "---------------------------- \"It's been great, honestly,\" Hyacinthus says.",
      "They're sprawled over each other, limbs tangled, under the shade of a tree.",
      "\"A nice break from all the fighting and training.\"",
      "\"You still go out to fight and train, though....\" When Hyacinthus isn't here with Apollo, he's generally out picking fights with bandits, or hunting, or going through his training routine.",
      "Every day a new injury.",
      "\"Right, but I mean when I'm not doing that.",
      "When I'm here.",
      "Normally... normally, I don't get to just sit around, swimming and singing and wrestling.",
      "It's always about training for war.\"",
      "He sighs.",
      "\"So coming here has been great.",
      "I kinda - look, don't tell anyone?",
      "I kinda wish I could stay.",
      "This is nice.",
      "Just fooling around, singing songs.\"",
      "Apollo traces a finger over broad Spartan shoulders, deeply tanned from the sun.",
      "\"I know what you mean.",
      "I didn't say this before, but...",
      "I'm actually here, serving Admetus, because my father is angry with me.",
      "I suppose I'm meant to be learning humility, but mainly I'm just enjoying the break from all the drama and arguing.",
      "It's been a greatly enjoyable summer.\"",
      "Hyacinthus takes Apollo's hand and they lie there companionably for a while.",
      "Hyacinthus breaks the silence after a few minutes: \"So....",
      "Are you ever gonna tell me your name, herdsman?\" Apollo smirks.",
      "\"When the time is right, sweet prince.\"",
      "Hyacinthus rolls his eyes.",
      "\"As obstinate as you are pretty,\" he says, leaning in for a kiss.",
      "----------------------------------------- Eventually - as he'd known would happen - Apollo is summoned to Olympus again, and his godhood restored.",
      "Apollo is joyously reunited with his sister; his mother; his dearest friend Hermes; the Muses; Helios.",
      "Zeus seems wary of Apollo's good mood but truly, Apollo feels more free and happy than he has in many years.",
      "There is a great feast in the halls of the palace, welcoming him back; and Apollo sings the songs he's composed about his life as a herdsman.",
      "He greets his son Asclepius with tears in his eyes.",
      "Whatever deal was made with Zeus, it was worth it to have such a brilliant and kind-hearted soul back in the world - and upgraded to a god, no less!",
      "Apollo couldn't be prouder of his second-most-talented son (after Chiron, of course).",
      "Apollo returns to Thessaly and begins to repay Admetus for his kindnesses - beginning with a fairly simple task of yoking a boar and a lion together to a chariot, which the king can then drive to Iolcus in order to impress the princess there - Alcestis.",
      "All this is accomplished in the span of about two weeks, by which time a broken-hearted and lonely Hyacinthus has already begun the journey back to Sparta, to finish his krupteia there.",
      "It's unfortunate that Apollo was recalled too quickly to be able to tell him where he was going; but Apollo intends to make it up to the boy.",
      "He appears in the middle of the road, directly in front of Hyacinthus, whose eyes boggle.",
      "\"H-herdsman?!",
      "W-what the hell!",
      "You just - you shithead!",
      "You completely vanished - I thought - you- \"",
      "Hyacinthus splutters.",
      "\"Yes, I apologize for that.",
      "When my father summons, I don't really have the option of telling him to wait,\" Apollo says.",
      "There are at least a million and twelve sexy and/or snarky things he wants to say, but they can wait a few minutes.",
      "He holds out his arms, smiling at Hyacinthus.",
      "\"I missed you.\"",
      "Hyacinthus stands there dumbly for only a moment longer before charging into Apollo's embrace, grinning bright as the sun.",
      "\"You rotten little bastard - I'm so glad to see - woh,\" he interrupts himself, prodding at Apollo in surprise.",
      "\"You got - really strong somehow...?\" Apollo's smile widens.",
      "\"Ahh, yes.",
      "About that.\"",
      "He swirls into motion, just a little too quickly for Hyacinthus to see what's happening, and lands them on the soft grass next to the road, Hyacinthus pinned on his back.",
      "The prince's eyes are huge.",
      "\"What.",
      "The.",
      "Hell,\" he manages, looking bewildered.",
      "\"I think that the time is right, now, to tell you my name,\" Apollo says.",
      "He's been dying for this moment to arrive for months.",
      "He smiles beatifically down at the boy.",
      "\"My name... is Apollo,\" he says.",
      "Hyacinthus blinks, working this out.",
      "\"You... were named after the god...?\"",
      "He finally ventures.",
      "Apollo laughs in spite of himself.",
      "\"No, you slow-witted Spartan, I amthe god!\"",
      "he scolds through his chuckles.",
      "Hyacinthus' eyes go bigger still, if such a thing is possible, and for a brief moment he looks nervous.",
      "Only a brief moment, though.",
      "Apollo might have enjoyed making him squirm a few months ago, when he only saw a cocky, noisy, dull Spartan boy.",
      "Now, though, he lays his head down on Hyacinthus' chest, feeling the heart beat beneath him.",
      "\"You were right, as it turns out,\" he says.",
      "\"You gave a god quite a lot to think about.\"",
      "\"Uh",
      ".....\"",
      "Hyacinthus offers uncertainly.",
      "\"I enjoyed this summer more than any of the hundreds of others that came before it,\" Apollo tells him, looking up to see the nervousness give way to a growing delight.",
      "\"Come with me.",
      "Let's play.",
      "I'm going to kick your ass at everything.\"",
      "Hyacinthus laughs.",
      "\"Pfft, I dunno!",
      "I saw you try all summer!\"",
      "\"You saw a human try.",
      "The tables are turnt, dear prince.",
      "I will demand three kisses for every one of your records I smash.\"",
      "\"And if I beat you?\" Hyacinthus challenges.",
      "It's blasphemy.",
      "Apollo of last year wouldn't have tolerated it.",
      "Apollo of this year only grins, pleased, and winks.",
      "\"I'll give you something to think about,\" he promises.",
      "\"Then let's get to it....",
      "Apollo,\" Hyacinthus says, and the sound of his name from the slow drawl drives Apollo to kiss him, again and again, happy as he's ever been, perhaps as happy as he'll ever be."

    "text": "The idea is sound; Nike is confident of that much. It's just tragically unfortunate timing. She'd had the idea of being more approachable. A winged warrior woman wielding a torch is an impressive main form, and she doesn't have any complaints on that front. But, she noticed over the years that she was appealed to only by a fairly specific set of people - the warriors and the athletes. Which, of course, is a perfectly respectable group to specialize. But it would be nice to be able to appeal to everyone. Everyone in the world thinks of Zeus when it rains. Everyone thinks of Hera when there's a marriage. They think of Apollo whenever a song is sung; they think of Artemis when a woman gives birth. Demeter touches all lives with her grains; Persephone touches all lives who see her springtime flowers... and anyone who dies, which is every mortal. Hermes, you can't avoid him even if you try. But for Nike, only the soldiers and athletes seem to want to be victorious. Nike doesn't know why - she wants to help anyone who seeks victory! A victorious harvest - Nike and Demeter, working in tandem! A victorious parcel delivery, thanks to a team-up with Nike and Hermes! A victorious - er - whatever it is Dionysus does? A victorious..... orgy... well, maybe some things don't need her help. She teams up with Athena all the time, of course; and Ares. But she wants people to pray to her with their small victories as well. Perhaps her winged, garland-bearing form is too intimidating. She gets the idea of choosing a more... low-key form. Something accessible; something that everyone sees all the time. Most animals are already spoken for, though, which makes it difficult: the traditional \"noble\" creatures like the lion, the bull, the eagle... but, she's looking for a \"humble\" creature. (\"You could try the cockroach,\" her idiot brother Kratos suggests. \"Truly a testament to the victory of survival!\" \"Not that humble,\" she informs him loftily. The imbecile.) Even the humble creatures are spoken for. The deer belong to Artemis. The rooster goes to Helios. The goose and cow go to Hera. Virtually every bird seems to belong to Apollo. Turtles go to Hermes, dogs go to Ares... Oh! But no one's claimed the cat! And how perfect! It's a humble creature to be sure, but unique among animals in that it chose, on its own, to almost self-domesticate. This resulted in all the survival benefits of a domesticated species, while still maintaining independence and self-reliance. Truly a victorious creature. It's decided! The Spirit of the Cat will represent her. Anytime a mortal sees a cat, they will think - victory, for even the small things! And they'll be inspired! She'll cheer them on!....Or, well, that was the idea, anyway. Unfortunately, she had this big idea just before Constantine stirred things up - and the people slowly but surely began to turn from the gods. Official worship was dead; thus, official means of promoting the Victory Cat were no longer available - though, of course, that was becoming a distant priority at that point. By the time the Dark Ages kicked in, not even the soldiers and athletes prayed to Nike for victory - and her hopes of being a winged cat who inspires the masses were all but crushed. To add personal insult to the matter, most Europeans of this time period chose to persecute cats as the creatures of the Devil, in their new religion. It was an all-around depressing time to be a Greek goddess of victory... or any other god. Things have picked up a little now, in years that will come to be known as the Renaissance - official worship is still out, but thanks mainly to Apollo and the Muses' tireless efforts, the painters and sculptors and musicians and poets remember them again. The gods have begun to turn up in the collective consciousness after a long hiatus, and it's quite exciting and wonderful! Nike's heard her name spoken aloud several times this year alone! AND PERHAPS SHE CAN MAKE THE CAT THING CATCH ON. She prowls around the artists' studios in her feline form as often as she is able, and stretches along their art supplies. She slinks into the musicians' halls as visibly as she can. She even lowers herself into allowing pets and treats from the distracted poets as they pen their verses. Nothing. Not one single association of cats with Nike. A few centuries of neglect have made these humans even less likely to take the hint than they were before. \"Oh, darn it all!\" she exclaims on day, flinging herself on Ares' couch in a huff. He looks over in mild curiosity, nonplussed by her bad language. \"Darn what?\" Ares is wearing a chest plate over a doublet and breeches. Nike doesn't much care for the aesthetic of the garb; but it's what the soldiers of this day and place are wearing, and Ares is about to be metaphysically on the job. He's been quite busy with the Italian Wars, though no soldier there prays to him by name. He still likes to oversee, though. Nike is one of the few Olympians who was fond of him from the beginning. She's associated formally with Athena and Zeus, but she feels more of Ares in her cries of encouragement, her cheers to bring her people to triumph. Athena has specific goals at the end of her wars; Nike and Ares are about a feeling. Nike doesn't remember her father, the Titan Pallas. He faded out eons ago, like so many of his generation. She sometimes likes to pretend that Ares is her father. He gives off very strong Dad vibes, in her opinion. She sighs, noisy and exasperated. \"I have chosen the cat as my sacred animal and NO ONE is taking it seriously, or even paying attention to all my Signs.\" \"The cat? That's a good choice. But of course, they don't get along with dogs well,\" he gives her half a quirk of his lips as he adjusts his chestplate. Dogs are his sacred animal, of course. \"If my association with cats would ever catch on, they'd definitely start getting along better!\" Nike declares, then sighs again. \"... it's a big 'if,' though. I've been trying since around Augustine. It's hard to get a thing to gain momentum by myself.\" \"Yeah. I hear that. It's pretty much impossible to start a trend on your own... I've been referring to myself as the god of courage since... well, almost since the beginning. But it's always war. Even in Rome, after things were better, it was still 'Mars, God of War.' And, uh, agriculture somehow. Never courage, though, couldn't make it catch on.\" He's matter-of-fact about it, even distracted: not satisfied with the weight of his sword. The god of courage. Now that he mentions it, she's sure she can remember it a few times - not that he had too many occasions to announce his godhood to an assembly of other gods who had known him for millennia. But yes; she remembers a few casual references, that went unnoticed by the audience. Ares startles, sword in hand, as Nike abruptly leaps up, planting her feet on Ares' couch and her fist in the air. \"WE CAN'T GIVE UP, ARES!\" she says in her Nikiest voice - the voice that inspires, the voice that drives you forward. \"We'll make it happen! The circumstances are against us, but we can persevere! After all, courage and victory go hand in hand! Just like cats and dogs!\" He's giving her an amused look. \"Uh...\" \"JUST LIKE CATS AND DOGS,\" she repeats, louder, in a Nike voice. \"We are eternal, Ares, we can be patient! No matter if it takes another thousand years! The world will someday come to understand that I am best represented by a winged cat, and you are the god of several things but primarily COURAGE! NIKE!!\" She shouts her own name with a note of finality, that brooks no argument. It's not a prophecy, of course; and she has no cosmic authority to make the world see either courage nor cats. But that's not what she's there for. She's there to inspire others to victory - soldiers and athletes; farmers and merchants, and even discouraged gods, so that they might make it come to pass themselves. Ares is grinning, now, and when she throws out her hand to him he takes it. \"To flying cats, then. I'll tell everyone I know.\" \"And I'll do the same!\" she vows, determined. \"I'll keep a garland ready for both of us!\"",

      "He looks over in mild curiosity, nonplussed by her bad language.",
      "\"Darn what?\" Ares is wearing a chest plate over a doublet and breeches.",
      "Nike doesn't much care for the aesthetic of the garb; but it's what the soldiers of this day and place are wearing, and Ares is about to be metaphysically on the job.",
      "He's been quite busy with the Italian Wars, though no soldier there prays to him by name.",
      "He still likes to oversee, though.",
      "Nike is one of the few Olympians who was fond of him from the beginning.",
      "She's associated formally with Athena and Zeus, but she feels more of Ares in her cries of encouragement, her cheers to bring her people to triumph.",
      "Athena has specific goals at the end of her wars; Nike and Ares are about a feeling.",
      "Nike doesn't remember her father, the Titan Pallas.",
      "He faded out eons ago, like so many of his generation.",
      "She sometimes likes to pretend that Ares is her father.",
      "He gives off very strong Dad vibes, in her opinion.",

      "\"The cat?",
      "That's a good choice.",
      "But of course, they don't get along with dogs well,\" he gives her half a quirk of his lips as he adjusts his chestplate.",
      "Dogs are his sacred animal, of course.",
      "\"If my association with cats would ever catch on, they'd definitely start getting along better!\"",
      "Nike declares, then sighs again.",
      "\"... it's a big 'if,' though.",
      "I've been trying since around Augustine.",
      "It's hard to get a thing to gain momentum by myself.\"",
      "\"Yeah.",
      "I hear that.",
      "It's pretty much impossible to start a trend on your own... I've been referring to myself as the god of courage since...",
      "well, almost since the beginning.",
      "But it's always war.",
      "Even in Rome, after things were better, it was still 'Mars, God of War.'",
      "And, uh, agriculture somehow.",
      "Never courage, though, couldn't make it catch on.\"",
      "He's matter-of-fact about it, even distracted: not satisfied with the weight of his sword.",
      "The god of courage.",
      "Now that he mentions it, she's sure she can remember it a few times - not that he had too many occasions to announce his godhood to an assembly of other gods who had known him for millennia.",
      "But yes; she remembers a few casual references, that went unnoticed by the audience.",
      "Ares startles, sword in hand, as Nike abruptly leaps up, planting her feet on Ares' couch and her fist in the air.",
      "\"WE CAN'T GIVE UP, ARES!\"",

      "\"We'll make it happen!",
      "The circumstances are against us, but we can persevere!",
      "After all, courage and victory go hand in hand!",
      "Just like cats and dogs!\"",
      "He's giving her an amused look.",
      "\"Uh...\" \"JUST LIKE CATS AND DOGS,\" she repeats, louder, in a Nike voice.",
      "\"We are eternal, Ares, we can be patient!",
      "No matter if it takes another thousand years!",
      "The world will someday come to understand that I am best represented by a winged cat, and you are the god of several things but primarily COURAGE!",
      "NIKE!!\"",
      "She shouts her own name with a note of finality, that brooks no argument.",
      "It's not a prophecy, of course; and she has no cosmic authority to make the world see either courage nor cats.",
      "But that's not what she's there for.",
      "She's there to inspire others to victory - soldiers and athletes; farmers and merchants, and even discouraged gods, so that they might make it come to pass themselves.",
      "Ares is grinning, now, and when she throws out her hand to him he takes it.",
      "\"To flying cats, then.",
      "I'll tell everyone I know.\"",
      "\"And I'll do the same!\"",
      "she vows, determined.",

    "text": "Zeus, the judge: How do you plead? Baby Hermes: [looks at lawyer] Zeus, also the lawyer: [mouths 'not guilty'] Baby Hermes: hot milky Apollo: *bangs head on desk* FFS Dad just throw him in Tartarus Amalthea was a goat. Not a person, not by the way most define such things: many of these ancient beings never quite coalesced their will into a consciousness. Amalthea did have a will, and she did have emotion; but it's difficult to say if she was ever aware of much that went on around her. Her life was mostly dedicated to being a goat, and doing goaty things like eating and climbing and baa-ing. To be sure, she wasn't just a goat. She was an ancient, somewhat primordial goat - one of those great beasts that appeared and roamed the world when it was still very new. She had power, like all of her kind, though it was never on the same level as the Titans. Her power was indirect; supportive. Athena can remember the day Zeus found Amalthea. Athena was still mostly a figment of his imagination, then; though in hindsight, there were already the signs that she was going to be something more. She had a form: a child Zeus' age, with a fearless stance and fearsome expression, and mounds of bright red hair, and bright silver eyes. So strong was her image in his mind, that Zeus nearly felt he could reach out and touch her, after she gave him advice; encouraged him; helped him escape Cronus. And yet, he could not touch her. She was not yet more than a thought. She could reach into the depths of his mind and pull out wisdom he didn't know he had; share things he didn't realize he knew; advise him to act on instincts that he was too stressed or afraid to look at clearly. But his advisor was not real. She could not give him warmth, nor sustenance. Amalthea could, and did. She had no wits about her, and could not converse with the young god Zeus, nor advise him. But she had a motherly instinct, and an ability to protect and sustain. She stood as his shield from Cronus' eyes as Zeus hid beneath her mighty frame, when the Titan drew too near. She retired to a cave at night, and Zeus curled in close against her warm hide and slept more peacefully than he ever did before or since. Amalthea's milk flowed, and sustained the child Zeus. He drank in gratitude; exhausted from so much time spent foraging for food at the same time as he went on scouting missions, at the same time he evaded Cronus' monsters... being able to come to Amalthea and drink her milk was a blessed relief on days when he found nothing else. He loved her; in a different way than he loves Athena; a different way than he loves Hera. Amalthea sustained him with love when no others could or would. The ancient goat died, at some point before the battle with the Titans, while the soon-to-be-Olympians were preparing for that war. Zeus thought she might have passed peacefully; a gift often denied to such beings. Athena does not remember this. She was a ghost of her former self at this point, dormant in his brain, replaced by Prometheus and Helios and Poseidon and Hera. She does not remember his grief, or the way he mourned her, or the way he honored her memory by placing a constellation of her in the sky, and creating the cornucopia of plenty from her horn to represent her sustenance, and using her hide with the greatest respect as his aegis, to represent the protection she gave to him. Athena hadn't realized the significance of any of these things. They had already been there when she finally emerged into the world as a real person. She only comments, idly, on Zeus' aegis one day, remarking that it seemed to serve as quite a shield. This is a long, long time after the days of Amalthea. Many centuries since Athena was a ghost in Zeus' mind. Amalthea has been gone for an age. And yet, at the attention called to the aegis, he goes still, and his gaze distant. \"What do you remember of her?\" he says, a rare direct reference to her existence back then. \"What do I remember of whom?\" Athena asks. Zeus' eyes well up, as he fingers the edges of the aegis. It is a fine thing, decorated simply and never wearing out, no matter how much time has passed. \"Amalthea. My first mother, in a way.\" \"Amalthea? The goat?\" Athena distantly remembers. The great and ancient beast. Ghost-Athena had known that Zeus needed to get to her, for protection and a place of safety, in order to proceed with his plan to overthrow Cronus. She understood, and still understands, the need for physical security before moving on to bigger things. All the rest, though - the emotions that go with it - these elude her. Zeus knows this about her. He knows her better than all the others do, how she struggles to understand the way all others seem to prefer feelings over logic. He smiles through tears. \"Yes. The goat. She loved me and sheltered me when I had little else. I've borne her hide as my aegis all this time, to honor that protection. The aegis represents her.\" He hesitates, then unfastens the aegis from about his shoulders and offers it to Athena. \"Perhaps it's time that you wore it.\" Athena protests. \"King Zeus - I can't even pretend to grasp the significance this holds to you. It would be wasted on me.\" \"I think that's why you should keep it,\" he says, warmly. \"Maybe it'll grow on you.\" Athena doubts it. She simply doesn't feel things the way he does; the way the others do. She values the aegis for the protection it brings, but she can't imagine the rest of it. Still, it is a fine aegis, and she can certainly make use of it in battle and elsewhere. She'll make an effort to preserve its condition, though; in case Zeus changes his mind and wants this memento of his goat-mother back. There's a certain sort of \"expect the unexpected\" that's required of any member of the Hellenic Pantheon. Things happen on the whims of powerful, impulsive beings, and it's simply impossible to stop and gape over all of them. Gods transform; mortals are transformed; cities and islands and seas and mountains are created in any number of outlandish fashion and vanish similarly. Reality changes daily in the middle days of the earth; and the Theoi take it all in stride. Still, there are certain things that any goddess eternally sworn to virginity might expect to stay true, and one of those things is \"not being a mother.\" So Athena is caught wholly by surprise when reality flips in this regard, and she finds herself with a baby in her arms, and is apparently responsible for it. The circumstances leading to this had been appropriately momentous and weird: Athena had been taking a brief rest from her task in carrying a mountain from the Pallene peninsula over to be used in the Acropolis at Athens. As she had been sitting there, the earth had abruptly opened up, and the enormous, matronly earthen features of Gaia emerged, holding a sleeping baby in her huge arms. \"Yours,\" Gaia had spoken, in her low rumble of a voice, direct as usual. \"Er,\" Athena had said: \"Actually, I'm sure you're quite mistaken. You see, I'm actually a virgin goddess, which precludes the possibility of any baby being mine - \" \"Not interested,\" Gaia had thrust the sleeping baby into Athena's arms. The infant began to blink awake. \"I did the hard part for you. But this baby is yours.\" \"How...?\" \"You're a goddess. He's a god. 'Traditional' isn't necessary.\" Gaia had begun to sink back down, relinquishing the form she'd undertaken for this task and becoming 'the earth' once again. \"I speak this to you: conceived of sweat and tears, born from Gaia, he will race across the earth, fast as four steeds; and rule in Athens till he joins the stars.\" With that, the form of the goddess of the earth had vanished, leaving only bare earth and a bewildered virgin goddess. The bewilderment doesn't last long. Athena is the goddess of wisdom, after all. She makes her deductions and reaches a swift conclusion: why and how Gaia came to declare this baby as Athena's. This is easily confirmed when the baby shifts within its coarse blanket, revealing twisted, withered legs. The handkerchief Athena had offered to Hephaestus, as he'd wept over the fallout of the affair with Aphrodite and Ares. Her sweat; his tears. She'd dropped it to the earth and forgotten it. And now she holds in her arms the result of that off-handed moment. By rights, this baby is a god, then - and yet, not. He was born from Gaia, by way of two other gods, in a very nonstandard fashion. He doesn't have the glow about him that indicates an immortal, though he does have a sturdiness and intelligence about him, that indicates he is other than purely human. That's easily fixed. A simple task: leave the infant with Athenian princess caregivers, locked in a box with her sacred serpent until the divinity within the snake passes into the child's body. After a period, he gains immortality and can probably be handed off to Chiron for training until he reaches adulthood. Simple!...........A mere day later, she is holding the same infant, quite a bit fussier now than he had been before. The princesses had immediately opened the box after being told not to; disrupted the magic at work and left the child half-mortal as it had been before. Very irritating. \"I thought I heard crying,\" comes an awkwardly-timed, familiar voice. Hephaestus is riding his donkey, Carrot, and leading a goat behind them. The blacksmith god offers her his small smile as he approaches, but his face quickly registers confusion at the odd sight of Athena and an infant. \"Uh....\" \"Gaia emerged and gave me this abandoned baby. He is destined to rule Athens,\" Athena says, truthfully. She isn't sure that Hephaestus should hear the rest or not. He's... a delicate soul. \"Ah. Your city,\" Hephaestus nods, accepting her misleading words at face value. He carefully dismounts in an ungainly fashion and goes over to see. Athena has wrapped the baby tightly in swaddling cloths, concealing the telltale limbs; but Hephaestus coos over the baby as he fusses. \"Poor kid looks hungry. Have you fed him yet?\" \"Fed him...?\" Hephaestus looks over at her, startled; then his face softens. \"You really don't have that motherly instinct, do you?\" he says, not unkindly, and unstraps a flask from Carrot's saddle. \"As it happens... I have goat milk here...\" \"You do? Why?\" \"Ahh, well... I suppose I can tell you,\" he smiles again, awkwardly. He dips a clean rag (which puts Athena in mind of this baby's origin) into the flask of goat milk and gently touches the soaked rag to the baby's lips. The infant begins sucking with greed immediately. \"You see, Aglaia's - well, apparently there are three more Graces due to make an appearance soon.\" \"Three - you mean, she's with child? Triplets?!\" Triplets are extremely auspicious, and can only be a source of glowing pride to Hephaestus after the trouble before. \"Yes! Three at once.... I know it's not done, for the father to help with nursing the babies, but... Well, I like the idea of helping out where I can. She can't feed three at the same time, after all.\" Athena smiles at him, watching the easy, gentle way his huge hands cup the back of this baby's head, supporting it as the infant takes in the goat's milk. \"You're quite a natural at this.\" Hephaestus shrugs, re-soaking the rag with more milk. \"I've wanted kids forever. I actually watched Aglaia and her sisters a few times for Thetis, back when they were kids... wow, that sounds a little creepy when I say it like that!\" Athena laughs. \"Creepy is very subjective, Heph, especially on Olympus.\" Particularly this situation here: a god and a goddess, both produced with the aid of only one parent... and the father nursing their child, who was conceived and born with the assistance of a third party. Athena's usual explanations for her absence of motherly feelings is a bit of a red herring - she claims that, being born with no mother, she feels none of the maternal instincts herself. And yet, here is Hephaestus exposing her lie: he was born with no father, but he can't wait to be a father himself, and is even sneakily stealing some maternal responsibilities from his wife. The real difference, of course, is that Athena was born from a need for a cool head; whereas Hephaestus was born from an aching longing for domestic happiness. Athena looks down at the baby as he hungrily goes for Hephaestus' second helping of goat milk. \"It didn't even occur to me to get goat's milk. Or any milk. I really have no motherliness in me.\" \"You were going to raise this baby yourself?!\" Hephaestus looks genuinely shocked. \"I wasn't planning to. Gaia gave me the baby and said he would have a fate tied to my city. I originally gave him to three princesses and one of my sacred serpents, but they fucked it up almost immediately, so now I suppose it falls to me.\" He laughs at her rare use of a curse word. \"So the virgin goddess is raising an orphaned child herself. Well, if you need any practical tips, you can ask me and Aglaia! I'm sure we'll be troubleshooting every imaginable baby problem in double-pace time.\" \"Triple-paced, rather,\" Athena attempts to joke, and is secretly gratified when he chuckles. Her jokes don't usually land well. She'll wait, before telling him. His domestic harmony with Aglaia is such a precious thing, something he's wanted so badly for so long... she doesn't want his success in this moment to be undermined by Gaia's unexpected delivery and more dramatics. In any case, it will be an interesting experiment, to see if the instinct to care for children can be learned, if it's not inherited - \"What'd you name the little guy?\" Hephaestus asks, interrupting her thoughts. \"Oh.\" That hadn't occurred to her, either. She really is bad at this. \"Um... 'Erichthonius.'\" \"'Very Chthonic One?' Nice! Appropriate choice!\" \"I feel I owe you an apology,\" Athena says, without preamble. Hera is seated with her cloak wrapped about her, staring at the new starry expanse in the sky. It glitters; a wide and shining streak across the entirety of Ouranos' magnificence. Truthfully, it's a thing of beauty. Athena may not have a solid grasp on many of her step-mother's subtleties, but she knows enough not to remark upon the beauty of this new celestial artwork. \"Fine,\" Hera says. Her voice is without heat, which... is unusual. Normally, Hera is a fountain of emotion, whether for good or for bad; much like Zeus himself. Hera sounds flatly calm here. Not unlike Athena, most days. \"I didn't realize the violation,\" Athena continues, surmising that things are not, in fact, 'fine.' \"I have no motherly instincts of my own - \" \"You knew. You wouldn't have given me the bastard while I was sleeping, otherwise; and when I awoke, you would have stated his name. Mother or not, you knew.\" Athena winces but is determined to see this conversation through. \"I knew you'd object. You hate all of them. I didn't want to upset you. But I truly didn't realize the violation.\" \"I feel as though I have never hated anyone before I hated this bastard,\" Hera says, still without her usual heat. \"All those that came before are like drops of water in the endless sea.\" \"Queen Hera, the fault is mine. You needn't blame the infant.\" Athena frankly still doesn't see the point of all the drama. The child needed sustenance. Hera was nursing Hebe at the time. Of course, Hera wouldn't want to nurse another of Zeus' demigods... and yet the child needed milk, or he would die. Rather than give Hera the agony of choosing, Athena had decided to keep the truth from her... and still thinks the idea would have worked, had not the infant nursed too strongly and caused Hera pain. So Hera figured out who the baby Alcides really is. But, well - he's still a baby, who was dying of malnourishment and exposure. Athena really wishes Hera could set aside her pride and penchant for melodramatics for once, but... \"You ought to have given the bastard to the harlot Leto. Goddess of motherhood, yes? She would surely have loved to give suckle to another of Zeus' blessed sons.\" The hatred is in her words, not her voice, which is... eerie. \"...I would have. I would not have troubled you at all. Artemis intercepted me, though - she would not have Leto brought into it.\" \"Clever girl. Pity I had no such guardian.\" She pauses. The cold light from Selene's chariot, far overhead, and the new faint glow of the celestial swath, illuminates her face very becomingly. Hera is quite beautiful; even Athena, with little natural appreciation for such things, can see it plainly. She wishes, not for the first time, that Hera could ever understand that Zeus' dalliances aren't about her, not at all. He finds no fault in her as his wife or queen. But she cannot see that his infidelity has no bearing on how he feels about her. It's really not Athena's place, as Zeus' 'daughter' he bore without Hera's help, to discuss the matter. She's considering doing it anyway. Her miscalculation with the breast milk earlier was... not her finest moment. After Erichthonius, Athena had supposed that any mother might care for any child... and she'd been correct, when Hera had seen Alcides as just another child, rather than her enemy. But Athena still feels confident in her ability to make strategic decisions about these Olympian personalities, and she's nearly convinced that things would be better off if Hera knew the truth about this bizarre situation they're in together - the lonely king of heaven; his hurting wife; the imaginary friend who upended so much of the natural order of things. While Athena is thinking this, Hera continues speaking. \"If I'd had better reflexes - quick and clever, like one of his favorite daughters - I would have dashed the little bastard's precious brains out on the floor and ended it then and there.\" Athena fights to keep from rolling her eyes. Melodramatics. But she's trying to be diplomatic, so she keeps her demeanor remains the same: calm, faintly contrite, and more-than-faintly exasperated. \"My queen, he is an infant. Killing him would be somewhat beneath you.\" \"He's a bastard. Another one, among a long list of - what, hundreds? Thousands? You brought a bastard child, proof of my failed marriage, into my house and gave him to me to nurse as I slept. And behold: Zeus' betrayal, painted across the sky for all to see and mock me, for all eternity. That's a new one. This infant humiliated me publicly before he was even old enough to stand.\" Athena sighs. \"Queen Hera, no one thinks of this as a reflection of you. I think... people know better, by now.\" \"I ought to go to his cradle now and murder him - but of course, you'd stand in my way. And if not you, then his father. I have no doubts who he would favor, given a choice between one of his bastard sons; or his wife.\" This much is incorrect, and Athena is certain. Zeus enjoys his lovers, and promotes his offspring whether legitimate or not, but there is only one Queen of Olympus, and everyone knows it. Everyone, perhaps, except the queen herself. \"He doesn't see it that way, as a choice -\" \"You dare to lecture me on how my husband sees things?! On the same day you give me my enemy to nurse? You presume far too much,\" Hera hisses, and Athena falls silent. Perhaps she hasoverstepped. Hera's lip curls in contempt and she turns her back to Athena. \"I can't stop him from being a hero, I'm sure. And I can't make the father behave with honor. So I'm going to make that bastard's life miserable,\" she says, still calm and flat. \"I will make him suffer as I have never made another soul suffer before. I will set aside my duties as a goddess for the duration of his mortal life, and dedicate myself to bringing him unhappiness. And I will do my utmost to ensure that the final thing he sees with his precious bastard eyes, is this abomination painted across the sky. The cost of his existence.\" Athena is relieved to hear the heavy footfalls of Demeter. The elder goddess strides into the room, spots Athena, and narrows her eyes briefly. \"I came as you asked, sister - am I interrupting?\" \"No, Demeter, Athena was just leaving,\" Hera says, waving a hand. Athena bows. \"And so I go. And I do apologize.\" Hera doesn't reply. Demeter, also, doesn't say anything further to Hera as she approaches her sister the queen, still seated facing the Milky Way. Athena leaves sedately, but her mind is churning. Something has clearly changed. There have been any number of lovers, who have had any number of bastard children - as Hera has guessed, there could be any number from dozens to hundreds. Hera has typically responded to all of them with identical flames of rage and vengefulness... but this time, she has gone icy cold with hatred. Athena doesn't know if it's because of her own miscalculation, or if this thousandth-and-one demigod was simply one too many. But it's clear that it's different, this time. It could be a good thing. The three of them have performed this dance of deception and unhappiness for far too long, and nothing has improved. Perhaps this push was needed - then the whole mess can finally be brought to a head, and the three of them can be freed from the unending melodramatics. Athena is certain that, one way or another, this latest demigod will be the last one that Hera tolerates to exist. She isn't excessively concerned for the infant - the babe does have godly powers, now, and he's practically guaranteed to die as the world's greatest hero, since Hera has made it her personal goal to set fearsome obstacles before him. Yes, life will be difficult for little Alcides - but if he survives it, he may well grow to be quite a glory. Kresios is a lovely mountain in springtime - small, but covered in flowers. It's a little distance off the main road, so it's quiet and peaceful. If one had to choose a place to die... this is as good a choice as any. Artemis has exited the cave in the side of the mountain... she walks over to a clearing, and begins preparing what is unmistakably a pyre. Hermes left a little while afterwards, cupping a tiny, deep blue soul in his hands. Ares... is still within. Since the other two have left, Athena dares to approach the mouth of the cave and peer inside. The scene is how she imagined: sad. Ares is sobbing over the corpse of one of his lovers... Aerope, if Athena remembers right. The god's towering, heavy form is supporting the woman's slighter frame. A cloth covers her face. Ares' other arm is supporting a tiny infant, and here is the surprise: the baby isn't squalling. It's eating, hungrily, from the dead woman's breasts. A bit macabre, at a glance, but Athena finds herself moved. The mother died in childbirth; it seems that even Artemis could not save her. But in a desperate bid to save his son, Ares has used his limited capacity for nurturing magic to produce milk anyway. He must be intending to raise the boy. Ares has numerous children, but he's never yet raised one. Eros had sort of... arrived, a young boy already. Phobos and Deimos were adopted. Most of his children with mortals were raised by their mothers alone, though Ares was a regular presence in their lives. If he is to raise this child himself, he will be breaking new ground; as new to the concept as Athena had been. She could enter the cave and offer him advice she'd gained from her experience with Erichthonius. She can speak confidently, now, of cradles and nappies. She can advise him at great length about obtaining goat milk for the baby. Perhaps later. Much of the gods' various animosities towards each other have purged themselves fully over the course of the Trojan War... the voyage of Odysseus wrapped up several others. The exposure, at long last, of the secret origin of Athena has created an unprecedented understanding among them all. The resentment and rivalry between Ares and Athena, while not fully healed, has finally been addressed, and it's possible they can coexist peacefully in the future. Athena herself has come a long way. One need only look at the small stone snakeheads - gifts from Medusa - as they garnish the original aegis of Amalthea. She has learned much, over the centuries, about how to care for people. And that's how she knows she has no place in the midst of Ares' grief. No matter the good advice she can give him. There is something he needs that she cannot offer to him. He needs someone else, and Artemis and Hermes are busy... Athena stops, briefly, by a temple to Demeter, and removes a sacrificial flask of goat's milk, murmuring an explanation to the goddess before going to Olympus. She approaches Queen Hera softly, tapping upon her doorframe to announce her presence. Hera turns, and offers a polite nod. The two of them are on significantly better terms now, post-Troy and post-imaginary-friend-revelation. \"Ah, Athena,\" the queen says. \"You've come to see me?\" \"Not for myself, Queen Hera,\" Athena says, offering the flask of milk to her. \"It's Ares. Your son needs his mother right now.\"",

      "But, well - he's still a baby, who was dying of malnourishment and exposure.",
      "Athena really wishes Hera could set aside her pride and penchant for melodramatics for once, but...",
      "\"You ought to have given the bastard to the harlot Leto.",
      "Goddess of motherhood, yes?",
      "She would surely have loved to give suckle to another of Zeus' blessed sons.\"",
      "The hatred is in her words, not her voice, which is... eerie.",
      "\"...I would have.",
      "I would not have troubled you at all.",
      "Artemis intercepted me, though - she would not have Leto brought into it.\"",
      "\"Clever girl.",
      "Pity I had no such guardian.\"",
      "She pauses.",
      "The cold light from Selene's chariot, far overhead, and the new faint glow of the celestial swath, illuminates her face very becomingly.",
      "Hera is quite beautiful; even Athena, with little natural appreciation for such things, can see it plainly.",
      "She wishes, not for the first time, that Hera could ever understand that Zeus' dalliances aren't about her, not at all.",
      "He finds no fault in her as his wife or queen.",
      "But she cannot see that his infidelity has no bearing on how he feels about her.",
      "It's really not Athena's place, as Zeus' 'daughter' he bore without Hera's help, to discuss the matter.",
      "She's considering doing it anyway.",
      "Her miscalculation with the breast milk earlier was... not her finest moment.",
      "After Erichthonius, Athena had supposed that any mother might care for any child... and she'd been correct, when Hera had seen Alcides as just another child, rather than her enemy.",
      "But Athena still feels confident in her ability to make strategic decisions about these Olympian personalities, and she's nearly convinced that things would be better off if Hera knew the truth about this bizarre situation they're in together - the lonely king of heaven; his hurting wife; the imaginary friend who upended so much of the natural order of things.",
      "While Athena is thinking this, Hera continues speaking.",
      "\"If I'd had better reflexes - quick and clever, like one of his favorite daughters - I would have dashed the little bastard's precious brains out on the floor and ended it then and there.\"",
      "Athena fights to keep from rolling her eyes.",
      "Melodramatics.",
      "But she's trying to be diplomatic, so she keeps her demeanor remains the same: calm, faintly contrite, and more-than-faintly exasperated.",
      "\"My queen, he is an infant.",
      "Killing him would be somewhat beneath you.\"",
      "\"He's a bastard.",
      "Another one, among a long list of - what, hundreds?",
      "Thousands?",
      "You brought a bastard child, proof of my failed marriage, into my house and gave him to me to nurse as I slept.",
      "And behold: Zeus' betrayal, painted across the sky for all to see and mock me, for all eternity.",
      "That's a new one.",
      "This infant humiliated me publicly before he was even old enough to stand.\"",
      "Athena sighs.",
      "\"Queen Hera, no one thinks of this as a reflection of you.",
      "I think... people know better, by now.\"",
      "\"I ought to go to his cradle now and murder him - but of course, you'd stand in my way.",
      "And if not you, then his father.",
      "I have no doubts who he would favor, given a choice between one of his bastard sons; or his wife.\"",
      "This much is incorrect, and Athena is certain.",
      "Zeus enjoys his lovers, and promotes his offspring whether legitimate or not, but there is only one Queen of Olympus, and everyone knows it.",
      "Everyone, perhaps, except the queen herself.",
      "\"He doesn't see it that way, as a choice -\" \"You dare to lecture me on how my husband sees things?!",
      "On the same day you give me my enemy to nurse?",
      "You presume far too much,\" Hera hisses, and Athena falls silent.",
      "Perhaps she hasoverstepped.",
      "Hera's lip curls in contempt and she turns her back to Athena.",
      "\"I can't stop him from being a hero, I'm sure.",
      "And I can't make the father behave with honor.",
      "So I'm going to make that bastard's life miserable,\" she says, still calm and flat.",
      "\"I will make him suffer as I have never made another soul suffer before.",
      "I will set aside my duties as a goddess for the duration of his mortal life, and dedicate myself to bringing him unhappiness.",
      "And I will do my utmost to ensure that the final thing he sees with his precious bastard eyes, is this abomination painted across the sky.",
      "The cost of his existence.\"",
      "Athena is relieved to hear the heavy footfalls of Demeter.",
      "The elder goddess strides into the room, spots Athena, and narrows her eyes briefly.",
      "\"I came as you asked, sister - am I interrupting?\"",
      "\"No, Demeter, Athena was just leaving,\" Hera says, waving a hand.",
      "Athena bows.",
      "\"And so I go.",
      "And I do apologize.\"",
      "Hera doesn't reply.",
      "Demeter, also, doesn't say anything further to Hera as she approaches her sister the queen, still seated facing the Milky Way.",
      "Athena leaves sedately, but her mind is churning.",
      "Something has clearly changed.",
      "There have been any number of lovers, who have had any number of bastard children - as Hera has guessed, there could be any number from dozens to hundreds.",
      "Hera has typically responded to all of them with identical flames of rage and vengefulness...",
      "but this time, she has gone icy cold with hatred.",
      "Athena doesn't know if it's because of her own miscalculation, or if this thousandth-and-one demigod was simply one too many.",
      "But it's clear that it's different, this time.",
      "It could be a good thing.",
      "The three of them have performed this dance of deception and unhappiness for far too long, and nothing has improved.",
      "Perhaps this push was needed - then the whole mess can finally be brought to a head, and the three of them can be freed from the unending melodramatics.",
      "Athena is certain that, one way or another, this latest demigod will be the last one that Hera tolerates to exist.",
      "She isn't excessively concerned for the infant - the babe does have godly powers, now, and he's practically guaranteed to die as the world's greatest hero, since Hera has made it her personal goal to set fearsome obstacles before him.",
      "Yes, life will be difficult for little Alcides - but if he survives it, he may well grow to be quite a glory.",
      "Kresios is a lovely mountain in springtime - small, but covered in flowers.",
      "It's a little distance off the main road, so it's quiet and peaceful.",
      "If one had to choose a place to die... this is as good a choice as any.",
      "Artemis has exited the cave in the side of the mountain...",
      "she walks over to a clearing, and begins preparing what is unmistakably a pyre.",
      "Hermes left a little while afterwards, cupping a tiny, deep blue soul in his hands.",
      "Ares... is still within.",
      "Since the other two have left, Athena dares to approach the mouth of the cave and peer inside.",
      "The scene is how she imagined: sad.",
      "Ares is sobbing over the corpse of one of his lovers...",
      "Aerope, if Athena remembers right.",
      "The god's towering, heavy form is supporting the woman's slighter frame.",
      "A cloth covers her face.",
      "Ares' other arm is supporting a tiny infant, and here is the surprise: the baby isn't squalling.",
      "It's eating, hungrily, from the dead woman's breasts.",
      "A bit macabre, at a glance, but Athena finds herself moved.",
      "The mother died in childbirth; it seems that even Artemis could not save her.",
      "But in a desperate bid to save his son, Ares has used his limited capacity for nurturing magic to produce milk anyway.",
      "He must be intending to raise the boy.",
      "Ares has numerous children, but he's never yet raised one.",
      "Eros had sort of... arrived, a young boy already.",
      "Phobos and Deimos were adopted.",
      "Most of his children with mortals were raised by their mothers alone, though Ares was a regular presence in their lives.",
      "If he is to raise this child himself, he will be breaking new ground; as new to the concept as Athena had been.",
      "She could enter the cave and offer him advice she'd gained from her experience with Erichthonius.",
      "She can speak confidently, now, of cradles and nappies.",
      "She can advise him at great length about obtaining goat milk for the baby.",
      "Perhaps later.",
      "Much of the gods' various animosities towards each other have purged themselves fully over the course of the Trojan War... the voyage of Odysseus wrapped up several others.",
      "The exposure, at long last, of the secret origin of Athena has created an unprecedented understanding among them all.",
      "The resentment and rivalry between Ares and Athena, while not fully healed, has finally been addressed, and it's possible they can coexist peacefully in the future.",
      "Athena herself has come a long way.",
      "One need only look at the small stone snakeheads - gifts from Medusa - as they garnish the original aegis of Amalthea.",
      "She has learned much, over the centuries, about how to care for people.",
      "And that's how she knows she has no place in the midst of Ares' grief.",
      "No matter the good advice she can give him.",
      "There is something he needs that she cannot offer to him.",
      "He needs someone else, and Artemis and Hermes are busy...",
      "Athena stops, briefly, by a temple to Demeter, and removes a sacrificial flask of goat's milk, murmuring an explanation to the goddess before going to Olympus.",
      "She approaches Queen Hera softly, tapping upon her doorframe to announce her presence.",
      "Hera turns, and offers a polite nod.",
      "The two of them are on significantly better terms now, post-Troy and post-imaginary-friend-revelation.",
      "\"Ah, Athena,\" the queen says.",
      "\"You've come to see me?\"",
      "\"Not for myself, Queen Hera,\" Athena says, offering the flask of milk to her.",
      "\"It's Ares.",
      "Your son needs his mother right now.\""

    "text": "Aphrodite and Aglaia approach Demeter as the older goddess is transferring a lump of soil from a row of sacks, into individual dishes on a table lined with bottles of chemicals. \"Good morning, Demeter!\" Aphrodite greets. The earth goddess glances over. \"Morning... well, I don't often see you two over here! You need more aloe-avocado skincare paste?\" \"Yes,\" Aphrodite and Aglaia say in unison. \"...But that's not actually what we came here for,\" Aglaia clarifies. \"You see, there's an international event we're running - it's 'No Diet Day.\" \"Oh?\" Demeter looks faintly disapproving. \"You girls... are promoting junk food?\" \"No, no, it's not like that,\" Aphrodite says. She seats herself on a nearby overturned crate. \"It's more about the obsession with constantly dieting to try to meet some ideal beauty standard.\" \"Usually a standard promoted by professional celebrities,\" Aglaia sighs. That's her arena, and she's finding it difficult to turn the tide. \"Yeah, I saw the Oscars a few years ago,\" Demeter says. \"Literally every woman there looked interchangeable to me.\" \"You should see the Chrises,\" Aglaia mutters. \"That's what we're trying to change,\" Aphrodite says. \"No-Diet day is only partly about dieting, honestly. It's really more about - about accepting your body as beautiful, the way it is. And appreciating the beauty in others, no matter what their shape or weight.\" \"We thought you might want to participate, because part of the message is that you should be eating healthy just to be healthy, rather than trying to be skinny.\" \"Well, I appreciate you thinking of me, but I don't think I could spare the time... it'd have to be in person, since beauty ain't my domain, and I have all this soil I have to test so I can run it through the simulator to see if the sustainable farming plan will work in this one village I've been working on.\" She gestures to the table. \"And I don't know how useful I'd be, anyway. Beauty's never been anything I cared about.. No offense, Aphy, it's just that... there was a reason I never bothered with that Golden Apple.\" \"None taken.\" Demeter turns to a tablet on the table - of a design not to be found on Earth. This is an Olympus exclusive, jointly created by Hephaestus and Athena. \"I think it's a great idea, though! That's what healthy eating is supposed to be for - your health! Not for looks. It's what I've always done... I have the body I have, and it's good enough for me to do what I want with it. Confidence takes you the rest of the way.\" She turns back over to look at the younger goddesses, and blinks to see Aglaia holding up a similar device to the one in her own hands - recording Demeter's impromptu speech. \"That's perfect!\" Aphrodite exclaims. \"Can we use that in our presentation?\" Demeter laughs. \"Yeah, sure. Good luck with it!\" ------------------- The rest of their day is busy. They gain a little extra support from Hera and Artemis, in their capacities for the well-being of both young girls and mature women; but most of this show is Aphrodite. She makes a physical appearance in many cities across the globe, tying blue ribbons to telephone poles and doorknobs with the name of the event printed on them. It's important that she be visible during this - even if she doesn't interact with anyone, they'll see her - a short, curvy woman with vitiligo, who nonetheless draws people in. They feel a pull towards her; an inexorable attraction; a desire to love her. It's cheating, a little, because Aphrodite has this ability as the Goddess of Love, while the average short, curvy woman with vitiligo would not. But she's doing her part to change people's views - she knows she's beautiful, and if they make the association in their minds, it will be easier in the future to accept the concept that diversity is beautiful. Aglaia inspires celebrities to use their public platforms to discuss diversity in body types - over the years, she's been pleased to see a more open discussion of the topic than there ever used to be. She thinks Beyonce might be personally be one of the best envoys of the message. They both bestow blessings on anyone who looks at themselves critically in the mirror that day. They finish up by going into the metaphysical Space Between Worlds, and broadcast the recordings they've made, from interviewing a few of the gods and goddesses: \"A real man loves his woman no matter what she looks like - \" \"Your body is just a vessel for your mind. Keep it in good shape, but it's not the most important - \" \"Not everyone needs to be an athlete! It's totally fine if you're happier not running six miles a day - \" \"Frankly, I've never seen a body type yet that didn't have some appeal...\".... Most of their soundbites, while enthusiastic for diversity, are a little more Problematic than Aphrodite or Aglaia want to use, so they mostly fill in the rest of the time with their own discussion on the matter, then finish strong with Demeter's input. \"...Confidence takes you the rest of the way.\" \"So, in conclusion, healthy is good - for your health. As for looks, it's better to be happy with the body you've got,\" Aphrodite finishes, and hits 'transmit' on her tablet, sending the message out into the ether. It's metaphysical, here, so no one will actually hear this message as real sound. But it'll contribute to the No-Diet Day in a subconscious way. It'll reach the minds of the mortals, giving them the idea of body acceptance and beauty in diversity, and hopefully one of these days it'll stick.",

    "text": "Hermes doesn't take on the title of 'god of memes' so much as it just is him. Memes are a fairly intrinsic part of the god's existence: the humor, of course, but also the concept of rapid-fire communication across whole populations - more than that, it bridges distant populations that would not otherwise normally communicate. Apollo has made this observation, while watching the 21st-century meme culture with a (slightly perplexed,) detached curiosity: that it's like watching Hermes' brain in action. It's not quite not true, but it gives Hermes a little pang to hear it. Because Hermes' brain is not nearly the happy-go-lucky chaos that everyone imagines. This version of Hermes that everyone thinks they know, is a very carefully cultivated illusion. Using one of his favorite memes as a reference point, consider the D&D alignment chart: a system of categorizing a person's moral/ethical outlooks, based on lawfulness vs chaos, and good vs evil. When the meme crosses Hermes' path, naturally he brings it up in an Olympic council for spirited discussion. Nobody claims the lawful good alignment - well, Athena tries, briefly, but gets side-eyed into conceding that she's probably more lawful neutral. No one but Hestia gets neutral good. Hades (not present for the discussion) is dubbed true neutral. Ares leaves the conversation before anyone can suggest chaotic evil for him (they don't, actually, they mostly think he's neutral evil). Hermes sneaks into his bedroom later and leaves a pillow with Ares' name and 'chaotic good' cross-stitched onto it, along with an angry frowning face that resembles Ares, and some appliques of dogs, dragons, and vultures. They don't speak of it again, but Hermes does see the pillow is still there, the next time he's in the room. That's the alignment everyone thinks applies to Hermes: chaotic good. The kind of guy who can't be tied down, who just runs around according to his own whims and his own principles - but in spite of his rascally ways, he's ultimately acting for the greater good. This is absolutely, 100% the kind of person Hermes wants to be, and it's the person he presents himself to be. But unfortunately, he doesn't think it's who he is - not anymore. \"Messenger god\" is his formal title, mainly because his duties are so varied that it's impossible to find a better term that encompasses all of them. One of his duties is as a chief enforcer of Zeus' will. One of his first tasks, in that capacity, was to slaughter the giant Argus, in order to free Zeus' lover Io. Where does this act fall on the alignment chart? A murder, as a direct result of Zeus breaking his marriage oath? Surely not lawful - and yet, it is, because Zeus' will is law. And what was the final outcome? Good or evil? Good, perhaps, in that Io was freed. That was the reason Hermes had gone so willingly to this task; he didn't feel Io's indiscretion warranted the punishment. He still feels that. But Argus... had done nothing wrong, either. He was employed by Hera to watch a cow, and showed hospitality to the wrong traveler. Hermes isn't even sure Argus knew who Io was. In the end, it didn't matter. Argus was murdered... in a violation of xenia, no less. The only thing to say for Hermes here is that he put Argus to sleep first so he wouldn't have to see his death coming. Not much of an act of good. Or how he was sent to retrieve Persephone from the Underworld, after Zeus had finally confessed to her whereabouts, after it was clear that Demeter was prepared to destroy the entire world if that's what it took to get her daughter back. Seemed straightforward enough - lawful good, even if Zeus ordered it a bit reluctantly. And yet, when he finally beheld Persephone after all those months of her being missing and he announced that he was going to return her to her mother... he saw unhappiness in her eyes. True grief; Hades, too, seemed miserable. Hermes took her back, as lawfully commanded. Not for him to decide what was good or what was evil. There are so many of those types of actions Hermes takes - actions of questionable morality, questionable lawfulness. They don't get discussed in the Olympic alignment roundtable, in favor of bringing up the way Hermes playfully terrorizes baby nymphs by pretending to be a scary Cyclops; the way he is able to befriend everyone, from Athena to Apollo to Ares; the way he spoils the hell out of that little storyteller, Aesop; the way he pranks everyone in Olympus regardless of their rank. Chaotic good, surely. And yet... the burden of responsibility drags him always back to something more like Lawful Neutral. The burden never weighs more heavily than when he delivers mortals to their final destination - on the banks of the river Styx. There are some who die peacefully in bed, surrounded by loved ones, satisfied with a full life. There are some who die violently - but proudly, defending their families or friends or city, from the dangers of bandits or wild beasts or foreign invaders. Those dead spirits aren't so hard to deal with. But there are those who died in fear and pain, and their final memory of life is sorrow. Sickness or violence took them too soon, and without even a noble last purpose to ease the sting of finality. Children, too young to even understand what is happening, crying for their mothers. Many women, murdered in the name of honor or possession or lust, resigned to the fact that they had one life and it's over now, due largely to the fact that they were born as women. Untold thousands of ordinary people who lived ordinary lives and had to make difficult choices and are not certain, at all, if they amounted to any good in the end. Hermes can sympathize. He sympathizes - and yet, he must take them to the river, and leave them there. They nearly all weep and cling to him, overcome with their loss, worried about their loved ones, fearful of what lies ahead. They beg him to take them back or, failing that, to stay with them. He doesn't. He can't. He has other duties to attend to. He tries, hard, to be the Hermes they want him to be, and he hopes he's successful. Hermes soothes them and tells them stories on their way to the river. He kisses their cheeks and tells them that it'll be fine, Hades is an even-handed ruler and Persephone still totally has a crush on Hermes, just tell her that you're Hermes' friend and she'll certainly be nice to you. The worst, though, are the ones who were not properly buried - those without coins for the ferryman. They linger, forlorn and trapped in their misery, on the banks of the Styx. Unable to go back, unable to move on. Absolute despair. Hermes starts stealing coins - the thefts are noticed, and even identified as stolen by Hermes, but they go unremarked for the most part. Hermes is the god of thievery; what is there to remark upon? He steals stuff. Just be grateful he didn't steal more. No one question why he's stealing the coins; it seems irrelevant. So no one notices that he begins slipping the coins into the hands of the forlorn souls left on the banks. He can't take away their sorrows, but he can send them to seek peace. He remembers Icarus, well enough. Hard to forget - it isn't often that he's present when the mortal is killed; far rarer still for the mortal to be in the air with Hermes when it happens. Not that Hermes was particularly close by, but he's always in the air somewhere. He had seen Icarus and Daedalus soaring through the clouds on their wax wings and naturally, Hermes had tarried to watch with curiosity as Icarus had soared higher, a look of determination bordering on triumph in his eyes, as Helios and Apollo had coaxed him on, laughingly......And Hermes had seen the boy's wings melted by the sun gods' heat; had seen the boy plummet into the ocean far below, had seen bones break upon impact, had seen the water fill his lungs. The sun gods don't save Icarus. They had expected this to happen, and are just amused that the young idiot had allowed his lust to overrule his good sense. There isn't actually any malice in their amusement - just a detachment, an inability to see the value in this mortal. But then again, neither of them have seen the banks of the Styx, or perhaps they would care more. Hermes doesn't save Icarus. He can't save everyone. Icarus' soul is one of those who died too young and filled with sorrow - but there are so, so many who die in sorrow. Hermes can't save them all. He tells his stories and gives him hugs and tells Icarus it will be okay. He's about to find peace in the Underworld. Icarus doesn't care. He's crushed. He doesn't respond to anything Hermes says. Icarus does cry, but quietly, and doesn't look up once. He stands where Hermes leaves him, eyes dull where once there was fiery determination. Hermes assumes that he's going to need a coin stolen - a body tossed about at sea won't get a proper funeral. But the next time he comes through, he finds that Icarus is gone already. He asks Persephone, who informs him that Hebe asked her illicit mortal beau Herakles to retrieve the body and bury it properly. She additionally tells him that Icarus' exploits, while unsuccessful, were nonetheless noteworthy enough that she had decided he might stay in Elysium, to enjoy a life of joy with other remarkable mortals. Icarus had declined, and asked to go to the Asphodel Meadows, there to relinquish all memory of his mortal life and drift, mindless but at peace. An unhappy fate, for Icarus. Centuries pass. Hermes carries on as ever before. He carries out the will of Zeus and carries out the rest of his duties, staying as impartial as he can, in the name of keeping balance in the world. He maintains a carefree and joyful face to the world, and plays his jokes wherever he can, and does his best to keep the balance in his own heart, of the terrible things he has to do, with his intrinsic desire to spread joy through the world. He consumes the memes greedily and loves them for the distractions they are. He's drawn up his own Olympic Alignment Sheet and is showing it to the Moirae. He's on good terms with them - as good as anyone can be, anyway. They share some responsibilities (and sorrows) with him, in the ending of mortal lives and the dealing with prophecy and fate. Hermes is only a dabbler in fate - he has his dice, which he rolls to get a prophecy of sorts, but that's about it. The Moirae are amused by the alignment meme and argue a few of the positions - they feel Helios needs to be fully lawful, \"that nerd wants to be a rebel so bad, but the sun is always where it should be, maybe the most reliable thing in the world; and how many rules does he ever actually break? You can't just wear a leather jacket and say that makes you James Dean.\" \"Yeah, and Artemis doesn't get to say she's lawful just because she lives out in the woods and hardly ever brushes against civilization. Even if she only encounters civilized laws twice a year, she has something like a 99% rate of chaos on those occasions.\" \"And you, Hermes!\" \"What about me?\" Hermes says, grinning in amusement at the three ancient crones crowded around his carefully-drawn sheet. \"You put yourself at lawful neutral? What the hell?\" \"You're clearly chaotic good!\" He blinks, and looks at the sheet. His mark was supposed to be at chaotic good, where everyone had decided he belonged. Instead, it's over at lawful neutral, like the Moirae have pointed out. Apparently, they're seeing where he places himself, in his own mind. Should've known he couldn't fool these three. Hermes shrugs, trying to play off the unexpected moment of vulnerability. \"Ahh, well, you know me - always doing my job, no matter what it is, good or bad...\" The three crones scoff as one. \"We know what you do, Joyful Hermes.\" \"You do as you are bidden, lawfully, no matter what it is.\" \"And you undermine it every chance you get!\" Hermes hovers in the air, a rare expression of stupefaction on his face. Clotho cackles. \"We see all, little fool! You, who were sent to slaughter Argus, and wouldn't do so until you'd set him happily and peacefully to sleep so he wouldn't suffer.\" \"You, who thought of the loophole of the pomegranate seeds, that Persephone could have her mother and her husband both!\" Atropos adds. \"Hermes who steals coins that all mortals may find peace in the afterlife!\" Lachesis chimes in. \"Well, yeah, but - \" \"But me no buts!\" the three say in unison. Atropos tosses the crumpled alignment sheet at him; it bonks off his forehead. \"You are clearly chaotic good. You do all you can to make things better, to undermine every ugly thing that happens in the world.\" \"I'm not sure that's how the alignment system works - \" he tries. \"We're Fate, Idiot Hermes!\" they say, using their favorite epithet for him. \"Don't argue it with us.\" \"Chaotic Good.\" \"We're lawful neutral. Us, and Hades. Not you.\" \"Yes, and Hades. Who could have thought that boy would be anything but lawful neutral.\" Hermes leaves with a lot to think about - the confident assertion that he is, in fact, chaotic good, but also the fact that there are beings old enough to think of Hades as boy. But, chaotic good. Hermes, the enforcer, the impartial - chaotic good? He mulls it over with a busy round of pranks, thefts, and comforting sorrowed souls, culminating in a combination of these three things: He breaks into the vault in the Underworld, where Persephone keeps the memories of all the deceased, and steals one vial in particular, as well as the paperwork for Icarus' reincarnation. He replaces the vial with one containing a liquid smelling strongly of strawberries, and the paperwork with an alignment sheet containing only one name: Hermes. The mark is in chaotic fucking good.",

      "They don't speak of it again, but Hermes does see the pillow is still there, the next time he's in the room.",
      "That's the alignment everyone thinks applies to Hermes: chaotic good.",
      "The kind of guy who can't be tied down, who just runs around according to his own whims and his own principles - but in spite of his rascally ways, he's ultimately acting for the greater good.",
      "This is absolutely, 100% the kind of person Hermes wants to be, and it's the person he presents himself to be.",
      "But unfortunately, he doesn't think it's who he is - not anymore.",
      "\"Messenger god\" is his formal title, mainly because his duties are so varied that it's impossible to find a better term that encompasses all of them.",
      "One of his duties is as a chief enforcer of Zeus' will.",
      "One of his first tasks, in that capacity, was to slaughter the giant Argus, in order to free Zeus' lover Io.",
      "Where does this act fall on the alignment chart?",
      "A murder, as a direct result of Zeus breaking his marriage oath?",
      "Surely not lawful - and yet, it is, because Zeus' will is law.",
      "And what was the final outcome?",
      "Good or evil?",
      "Good, perhaps, in that Io was freed.",
      "That was the reason Hermes had gone so willingly to this task; he didn't feel Io's indiscretion warranted the punishment.",
      "He still feels that.",
      "But Argus... had done nothing wrong, either.",
      "He was employed by Hera to watch a cow, and showed hospitality to the wrong traveler.",
      "Hermes isn't even sure Argus knew who Io was.",
      "In the end, it didn't matter.",
      "Argus was murdered... in a violation of xenia, no less.",
      "The only thing to say for Hermes here is that he put Argus to sleep first so he wouldn't have to see his death coming.",
      "Not much of an act of good.",
      "Or how he was sent to retrieve Persephone from the Underworld, after Zeus had finally confessed to her whereabouts, after it was clear that Demeter was prepared to destroy the entire world if that's what it took to get her daughter back.",
      "Seemed straightforward enough - lawful good, even if Zeus ordered it a bit reluctantly.",
      "And yet, when he finally beheld Persephone after all those months of her being missing and he announced that he was going to return her to her mother... he saw unhappiness in her eyes.",
      "True grief; Hades, too, seemed miserable.",
      "Hermes took her back, as lawfully commanded.",
      "Not for him to decide what was good or what was evil.",
      "There are so many of those types of actions Hermes takes - actions of questionable morality, questionable lawfulness.",
      "They don't get discussed in the Olympic alignment roundtable, in favor of bringing up the way Hermes playfully terrorizes baby nymphs by pretending to be a scary Cyclops; the way he is able to befriend everyone, from Athena to Apollo to Ares; the way he spoils the hell out of that little storyteller, Aesop; the way he pranks everyone in Olympus regardless of their rank.",
      "Chaotic good, surely.",
      "And yet...",
      "the burden of responsibility drags him always back to something more like Lawful Neutral.",
      "The burden never weighs more heavily than when he delivers mortals to their final destination - on the banks of the river Styx.",
      "There are some who die peacefully in bed, surrounded by loved ones, satisfied with a full life.",
      "There are some who die violently - but proudly, defending their families or friends or city, from the dangers of bandits or wild beasts or foreign invaders.",
      "Those dead spirits aren't so hard to deal with.",
      "But there are those who died in fear and pain, and their final memory of life is sorrow.",
      "Sickness or violence took them too soon, and without even a noble last purpose to ease the sting of finality.",
      "Children, too young to even understand what is happening, crying for their mothers.",
      "Many women, murdered in the name of honor or possession or lust, resigned to the fact that they had one life and it's over now, due largely to the fact that they were born as women.",
      "Untold thousands of ordinary people who lived ordinary lives and had to make difficult choices and are not certain, at all, if they amounted to any good in the end.",
      "Hermes can sympathize.",
      "He sympathizes - and yet, he must take them to the river, and leave them there.",
      "They nearly all weep and cling to him, overcome with their loss, worried about their loved ones, fearful of what lies ahead.",
      "They beg him to take them back or, failing that, to stay with them.",
      "He doesn't.",
      "He can't.",
      "He has other duties to attend to.",
      "He tries, hard, to be the Hermes they want him to be, and he hopes he's successful.",
      "Hermes soothes them and tells them stories on their way to the river.",
      "He kisses their cheeks and tells them that it'll be fine, Hades is an even-handed ruler and Persephone still totally has a crush on Hermes, just tell her that you're Hermes' friend and she'll certainly be nice to you.",
      "The worst, though, are the ones who were not properly buried - those without coins for the ferryman.",
      "They linger, forlorn and trapped in their misery, on the banks of the Styx.",
      "Unable to go back, unable to move on.",
      "Absolute despair.",
      "Hermes starts stealing coins - the thefts are noticed, and even identified as stolen by Hermes, but they go unremarked for the most part.",
      "Hermes is the god of thievery; what is there to remark upon?",
      "He steals stuff.",
      "Just be grateful he didn't steal more.",
      "No one question why he's stealing the coins; it seems irrelevant.",
      "So no one notices that he begins slipping the coins into the hands of the forlorn souls left on the banks.",
      "He can't take away their sorrows, but he can send them to seek peace.",
      "He remembers Icarus, well enough.",
      "Hard to forget - it isn't often that he's present when the mortal is killed; far rarer still for the mortal to be in the air with Hermes when it happens.",
      "Not that Hermes was particularly close by, but he's always in the air somewhere.",
      "He had seen Icarus and Daedalus soaring through the clouds on their wax wings and naturally, Hermes had tarried to watch with curiosity as Icarus had soared higher, a look of determination bordering on triumph in his eyes, as Helios and Apollo had coaxed him on, laughingly......And Hermes had seen the boy's wings melted by the sun gods' heat; had seen the boy plummet into the ocean far below, had seen bones break upon impact, had seen the water fill his lungs.",
      "The sun gods don't save Icarus.",
      "They had expected this to happen, and are just amused that the young idiot had allowed his lust to overrule his good sense.",
      "There isn't actually any malice in their amusement - just a detachment, an inability to see the value in this mortal.",
      "But then again, neither of them have seen the banks of the Styx, or perhaps they would care more.",
      "Hermes doesn't save Icarus.",
      "He can't save everyone.",
      "Icarus' soul is one of those who died too young and filled with sorrow - but there are so, so many who die in sorrow.",
      "Hermes can't save them all.",
      "He tells his stories and gives him hugs and tells Icarus it will be okay.",
      "He's about to find peace in the Underworld.",
      "Icarus doesn't care.",
      "He's crushed.",
      "He doesn't respond to anything Hermes says.",
      "Icarus does cry, but quietly, and doesn't look up once.",
      "He stands where Hermes leaves him, eyes dull where once there was fiery determination.",
      "Hermes assumes that he's going to need a coin stolen - a body tossed about at sea won't get a proper funeral.",
      "But the next time he comes through, he finds that Icarus is gone already.",
      "He asks Persephone, who informs him that Hebe asked her illicit mortal beau Herakles to retrieve the body and bury it properly.",
      "She additionally tells him that Icarus' exploits, while unsuccessful, were nonetheless noteworthy enough that she had decided he might stay in Elysium, to enjoy a life of joy with other remarkable mortals.",
      "Icarus had declined, and asked to go to the Asphodel Meadows, there to relinquish all memory of his mortal life and drift, mindless but at peace.",
      "An unhappy fate, for Icarus.",
      "Centuries pass.",
      "Hermes carries on as ever before.",
      "He carries out the will of Zeus and carries out the rest of his duties, staying as impartial as he can, in the name of keeping balance in the world.",
      "He maintains a carefree and joyful face to the world, and plays his jokes wherever he can, and does his best to keep the balance in his own heart, of the terrible things he has to do, with his intrinsic desire to spread joy through the world.",
      "He consumes the memes greedily and loves them for the distractions they are.",
      "He's drawn up his own Olympic Alignment Sheet and is showing it to the Moirae.",
      "He's on good terms with them - as good as anyone can be, anyway.",
      "They share some responsibilities (and sorrows) with him, in the ending of mortal lives and the dealing with prophecy and fate.",
      "Hermes is only a dabbler in fate - he has his dice, which he rolls to get a prophecy of sorts, but that's about it.",
      "The Moirae are amused by the alignment meme and argue a few of the positions - they feel Helios needs to be fully lawful, \"that nerd wants to be a rebel so bad, but the sun is always where it should be, maybe the most reliable thing in the world; and how many rules does he ever actually break?",
      "You can't just wear a leather jacket and say that makes you James Dean.\"",
      "\"Yeah, and Artemis doesn't get to say she's lawful just because she lives out in the woods and hardly ever brushes against civilization.",
      "Even if she only encounters civilized laws twice a year, she has something like a 99% rate of chaos on those occasions.\"",
      "\"And you, Hermes!\"",
      "\"What about me?\" Hermes says, grinning in amusement at the three ancient crones crowded around his carefully-drawn sheet.",
      "\"You put yourself at lawful neutral?",
      "What the hell?\"",
      "\"You're clearly chaotic good!\"",
      "He blinks, and looks at the sheet.",
      "His mark was supposed to be at chaotic good, where everyone had decided he belonged.",
      "Instead, it's over at lawful neutral, like the Moirae have pointed out.",
      "Apparently, they're seeing where he places himself, in his own mind.",
      "Should've known he couldn't fool these three.",
      "Hermes shrugs, trying to play off the unexpected moment of vulnerability.",
      "\"Ahh, well, you know me - always doing my job, no matter what it is, good or bad...\" The three crones scoff as one.",
      "\"We know what you do, Joyful Hermes.\"",
      "\"You do as you are bidden, lawfully, no matter what it is.\"",
      "\"And you undermine it every chance you get!\"",
      "Hermes hovers in the air, a rare expression of stupefaction on his face.",
      "Clotho cackles.",
      "\"We see all, little fool!",
      "You, who were sent to slaughter Argus, and wouldn't do so until you'd set him happily and peacefully to sleep so he wouldn't suffer.\"",
      "\"You, who thought of the loophole of the pomegranate seeds, that Persephone could have her mother and her husband both!\"",
      "Atropos adds.",
      "\"Hermes who steals coins that all mortals may find peace in the afterlife!\"",
      "Lachesis chimes in.",
      "\"Well, yeah, but - \" \"But me no buts!\"",
      "the three say in unison.",
      "Atropos tosses the crumpled alignment sheet at him; it bonks off his forehead.",
      "\"You are clearly chaotic good.",
      "You do all you can to make things better, to undermine every ugly thing that happens in the world.\"",
      "\"I'm not sure that's how the alignment system works - \" he tries.",
      "\"We're Fate, Idiot Hermes!\"",
      "they say, using their favorite epithet for him.",
      "\"Don't argue it with us.\"",
      "\"Chaotic Good.\"",
      "\"We're lawful neutral.",
      "Us, and Hades.",
      "Not you.\"",
      "\"Yes, and Hades.",
      "Who could have thought that boy would be anything but lawful neutral.\"",
      "Hermes leaves with a lot to think about - the confident assertion that he is, in fact, chaotic good, but also the fact that there are beings old enough to think of Hades as boy.",
      "But, chaotic good.",
      "Hermes, the enforcer, the impartial - chaotic good?",
      "He mulls it over with a busy round of pranks, thefts, and comforting sorrowed souls, culminating in a combination of these three things: He breaks into the vault in the Underworld, where Persephone keeps the memories of all the deceased, and steals one vial in particular, as well as the paperwork for Icarus' reincarnation.",
      "He replaces the vial with one containing a liquid smelling strongly of strawberries, and the paperwork with an alignment sheet containing only one name: Hermes.",
      "The mark is in chaotic fucking good."

    "text": "On the island of the Lotus-Eaters, time... doesn't happen. There is no past. No one remembers anything. If they're removed from the lotuses long enough, supposedly, it all comes back. But no one leaves the lotuses so how would they know? They're aware that there was a past, once. They all know they came here from somewhere. But the where and why are lost. Their stories are sacrificed to the lotuses, and the beautiful sweet blossoms reward them with eternal bliss in return. There's barely a present. They sometimes have conversations, but the content is forgotten. People arrive and sometimes there's a commotion, but the Lotus-Eaters don't always notice. People are nameless presences that drift through; part of the landscape. There is no future. All things are the same. An endless stream of days, filled with lotuses and a pleasant mist. If something ever did change, the Lotus-Eaters wouldn't notice or register the newness, and would forget the transition. They are incapable of anticipating things being different in the future. Nothing happens but floating along on the dreams of the lotuses. ---------- If he thinks about it long enough, he remembers - Argyros. His nickname - \"eyes.\" He doesn't remember why. He remembers - a man, dragging him by the arm. He remembers a boat, a monster, a city. No context for any of it, though there are shadows on the edges of these memories. They're all Bad, though, these memories; so if he finds himself thinking of it, he hurries back to the lotuses and forgets again. The memories fade, and he becomes just another drifting body among the sweet-smelling fields. There's a woman... no, not a woman. Something else. Tall and red and silver. Wearing armor, which is Bad Memories, so he doesn't really listen when she talks to him... and she does talk. At length. He doesn't want to talk to her or remember things, so he eats lotuses until she fades out of his awareness. She comes back though, often enough that he remembers her somewhat. She seems like she must be a being of power, but even she has no match for the sweet forgetfulness of the lotuses. ------------------- \"It's very exasperating. I can't reason with him at all. It's like his mind is constantly buried under these damn weeds. I can't fathom why he would choose this.\" \"To confirm: you were definitely actually asking for my expert opinion, right?\" A sigh. \"Yes, please, Dio.\" \"You're solving the wrong problem. The lotuses are *a* problem, but ultimately they're the symptoms that eclipsed the real problem. And you're never gonna logic your way past the lotuses to get to the problem.\" \"What is the real problem, then?\" \"No idea.\" Another sigh; more long-suffering than the first. \"Dionysus...\" \"Well, fine, I do know. But it doesn't matter. It isn't my problem and it isn't yours. It's this guy's, and he has to be the one to figure it out.\" \"That was a roundabout way of saying we can't do anything - \" \"Nah, nah, we can, but I don't think your wisdom and my - uh - experience, is gonna be enough.\" \"What do you suggest, then?\" \"A team effort.\" \"...oh.\" \"It'll be fine, it's been a long time since Troy! They'll help.\" Privately, he thinks this could a good test-run of the new Olympus - to see if everyone really is willing and able to work together, mostly in the metaphysical realm, rather than via direct divine intervention. And if not, if it doesn't work? Well... sure, Athena wants to honor the final wish; but in the end, that disappointment would be a minor thing if it doesn't work. Dionysus has seen far worse for mortals in the thralls of addiction than drifting slowly through a pleasant fog. At best, the gods can come together to inspire something beneficial to humanity. At worst... this guy will continue to dream, and to forget. ----------------------- Argyros - \"Eyes,\" he was affectionately nicknamed - was a crewman on the great Odysseus' ship; traveling with his king from Ithaca. Argyos had few skills of renown: a mediocre runner, a mediocre shot with an arrow, a mediocre player at the lyre. His mediocre skills among an army of heroes doesn't faze King Odysseus, though. After all, Argyros has the same clear grey eyes that are noted to be a feature of Odysseus' patron goddess Athena. Argyros, a young man who has mostly served as a shepherd, never as a soldier, is brought along mostly as a good-luck charm. During the war at Troy, Argyros mostly managed to accomplish nothing much for ten years. Which, all things considered, might not be so bad. He isn't much like the war goddess he's meant to be representing, and doesn't take special pride in some of the heroic activities he's done. When the crew reaches the island of the Lotus-Eaters, Argyros and the other crewmen are at once enchanted with the bliss of it all. Argyros will never know if the lotus meant the same to the others as it did to him. When King Odysseus came roaring through, dragging his men back to the ship by the arm, by the strap of the chiton, by the hair... Argyros struck him, hard, and ran away. Lese-majeste; striking the king. One final sin to forget. Odysseus doesn't return for him again; or at any rate, doesn't find him. Argyros is free to drift, to dream... to forget. Memories fade of the men who died at the end of his spear; of the children whose blood was spilled in the name of this war - Iphigenia kicked it off, Astyanax finished, others in the middle. It was not Argyros' own hand that cut their throats or threw them off the walls, but it didn't matter. He was in the same army; they were his brothers-in-arms. Memories fade of the women - the broken-hearted, terrified women of Troy. The Aegeans were all helping themselves to prizes. Argyros himself did, almost. The dark-eyed woman - no, call her what she was. A girl. Utterly terrified and weeping beneath him. He couldn't, in the end; walked away with her tears etched into his soul. Not that he did her any favors. No Trojan made it out unscathed. The city and its inhabitants burned. When the lotuses offered the chance to lose all of those memories, Argyros accepted. Odyssesus' good-luck charm abandoned him in favor of letting all the glory, and all the misery that accompanied it, fade into the lotus-scented mists. After enough time passes, the lotuses took the choice from him. There was nothing to forget, because he no longer remembered the soldiers or the women or the babies. The lotuses took their hold on him; replacing everything else. Argyros drifts, unaware and uncaring that while he still technically is alive, he's already lost his life. ------------------------- He hears his name a few times: \"Argyros. Argyros.\" That word refers to himself; he knows that much. It catches his reluctant attention, and he finds himself looking at a shockingly gorgeous young man - probably a man - with an utterly beautiful face and long, soft, wavy hair. \"You have to acknowledge the lotus is a problem, here. It's basically fixed into your entire body now; you're a slave to it.\" \"Don't care,\" Argyros murmurs. Is he... away from the lotuses? \"Yes, that's a great deal of it. You need to want to care, and take the initiative. You have to want your mind back; to recover your wits and memory.\" This familiar voice. The woman... no, not a woman. No more than the first person is truly a man. They're something other. \"And your health. And mastery of your own body.\" This third voice cuts in before Argyros can even explain that getting his memory back would be bad. The speaker is another beautiful, dark-skinned man with gold in his hair. Who are these people? To his surprise, he finds himself answering a question he hasn't addressed in.... A long time. \"I fell too far,\" he says, sounding distant from himself. \"We all did. I was in the worst place. The lotuses make it better.\" \"The lotuses do nothing but take away your ability to think about it,\" says the beautiful first speaker. \"Try to focus less on the loss, and more on making things better,\" suggests a fourth voice. A kind, round-faced woman with a soft voice suggesting warmth. Hestia, he thinks abruptly. \"It will be hard. You'll backslide for sure. You'll have to find the strength to try again when that happens. I'll help with that.\" A huge, tall man in - fuck - armor, is saying this. \"Wow, this is turning into a real group project, isn't it?\" comes a loud voice from a handsome, athletic young man hovering in the air on winged sandals. Unmistakable. This is Hermes. \"No one asked for you, dumbass!\" admonishes the huge armored man. Ares. Has to be. It is. Argyros remembers, now - Ares, on the battlefield, towering over them all, mighty and terrifying. Hermes is undeterred. \"Keep a positive attitude!\" he offers in a loud voice. \"Lots of jokes! Ask friends for help!\" \"Yes. All this will help. Use anything that will help you break out of the lotuses' grasp.\" Dionysus. The beautiful god of - of wine. Argyros blinks at them all - the gods of Olympus. Well, some of them - Ares. Hermes. Apollo. Hestia. Dionysus. Athena is peering at him, and writing furiously on a scroll. \"This has the potential to work. If everyone holds up their end.\" \"If he holds up his end, too,\" Dionysus says, voice gentle. He adjusts Argyros' clothing, smoothing it for him. \"Listen, buddy. You've been here a while. The lotuses have sustained you for long years. Your old king - Odysseus - he asked Athena if she would try to get you out of here.\" \"...Me...? Odysseus? He's waiting?\" The last clear memory Argyros has of anything at all is of Odysseus - as Argyros had struck him. If Odysseus was summoning him, it couldn't be for anything good... where are the lotuses... \"Odysseus is dead - Ow!\" This blunt announcement comes from Ares, who is promptly elbowed by five other gods. Athena looks... subdued, at this. \"Yes. He is gone. He asked me to retrieve you.\" She looks up from her scroll at last, at Argyros. \"You are the last of his crew.\" This shocks him the rest of the way awake. \"They're all - Menon? Linus? Theron?\" \"The crew befell tragedy after tragedy, after leaving this place,\" she tells him. \"The Cyclops Polyphemus; the sorceress Circe; the pass between Scylla and Charybdis... and finally, their final fate came upon them when they slew the cattle of Helios. None survived, but Odysseus... and you, as it happened. Odysseus remembered you, when he was and old man and - and dying. He asked me to retrieve you, which turned out to be more difficult than I'd anticipated.\" Odysseus, an old man - dead, now. His friends, sailed on without him, and long dead now too. Argyros' still-addled brain is struggling to grasp it. Is he still dreaming? Did the lotuses turn to poison somehow? \"How... how long?\" he manages to ask. The other gods look at each other and shrug. Odysseus didn't mean much to them, of course. Only to Athena, who answers promptly. \"You've been here for fifty-three years,\" she says. \"I found you here about ten years ago; after Odysseus... left us. It took this long for me to give up trying to - \" Argyros hears no more of her explanation. Unconsciousness overtakes him - it's all too much. This time, the sleep is not sweet and misty. ----------- When he can think straight for a length of time again, he thinks first of Odysseus, because it's easier. He wasn't as close to Odysseus - the king kept a certain aloofness from his crew, as was his right. Odysseus, old and frail. It boggles the mind. It surprises him not at all to learn that Odysseus had been mostly single-minded in his attempts to return home to Penelope - he might be changeable as the weather in every other regard: a noble hero, sure; but a liar and a conman as well, and everyone knew it. But the one absolute fact about Odysseus was his love for his queen Penelope. Argyros supposes he's happy for them. But that's already come and gone, hasn't it? They'd had their pain and their joy while he was here sleeping awake. The crew. The reliable and stoic Linus, a man of few words. Theron, who always bit off more than he could chew and was lucky to have survived such a war as Troy. Sweet, nervous, sensitive Menon, who was never quite the same after witnessing the rage of Achilles - even though they were on the same side. How did he die? Or any of the rest of them? Argyros can't bear to imagine it. He'd lost them all to the lotuses. He'd wanted the lotuses to take his nightmares of Troy and they did. But in exchange they'd taken all else from him. Dionysus tells him he can't leave the island yet. He'll die if he leaves the lotuses too quickly. Argyros gradually tries to stay away from the lotus-fields longer and longer. He walks through the fields, filled with lotuses and people, who are standing or sitting or laying down with pleasantly blank expressions on their faces. Argyros shudders to see them. His body begins to ache and shiver as withdrawal begins to ravage him. He prays to Apollo, who doesn't come in person - but sends him knowledge of how to attempt to strengthen his body through the agony. The nightmares of Troy return swiftly. Argyros sees, again, the men he'd killed. The children sacrificed. The women raped and kidnapped. He prays to Hestia, who reminds him that 'who he is' is not the same as 'the worst things he's done.' Argyros stares into the flames of his campfire and hears her say that he cannot change what happened - no one can, not even a goddess. But he can always, always try to make things better. As Ares had said... Argyros sometimes cannot take the sorrow. He returns to the lotuses and weeps as he eats them, feeling the blissful mist wash away the pain of Troy, the pain of his friends' deaths. When he wakes, he prays to Ares for the strength to return to his task, and imagines he can hear the soldier tell him of how hard it can be to press forward in the face of total misery, but that it's the single most powerful thing a person can do. He feels his mind coming back to him - not just the memories, but the ability to piece together actions and events. He can make basic plans for his day, to do something different, to imagine what he might do if he leaves this island... he prays his gratitude to Athena. He sees none of the gods again (save for one), after that initial meeting. These interactions take place solely in his mind, in the form of a wave of... of inspiration that comes to him when he prays. It's as though they loan him their strength, their power, when he calls upon them. It's unorthodox - he's accustomed to the gods either directly interfering, or completely ignoring the mortals. This... metaphysical action is new and strange - distant but encouraging. He finds he's more grateful for this new method - direct intervention would have been unlikely for a humble shepherd/soldier before, but even if they're not physically present, he feels their presence more closely this way, somehow. There are times, when he walks through the fields, when he thinks he sees faintly puzzled frowns on the faces of the Lotus-Eaters. He wonders if some of them are praying, too. After months of struggling, he feels clear-headed enough one day to walk to the water's edge. The waves lap at the sand. Argyros remembers all the ships of the Aegeans, bobbing in the harbor in sight of Troy's walls. He remembers being a boy and fishing with his brothers. He imagines his friends, the crew of Odysseus, sailing into the distance to die without him. \"Hey, buddy,\" comes a voice behind him. Argyros turns to look: it's Hermes, unexpectedly in person. The god is wearing a small, sympathetic smile. \"Dionysus thinks you shook off the worst of it. You ready for my part?\" Keep a positive attitude. Lots of jokes. Ask friends for help. \"... how am I going to do that?\" \"I'll carry you,\" Hermes says. \"Off the island. If you're ready to make that step. I'll take you somewhere you can make friends, and move forward.\" Argyros doesn't answer immediately. He looks out at the ocean, where his old friends died. Far across the water are the ruins of Troy, where even more of his friends died, and where he committed so many atrocities that he nearly destroyed himself to forget. I vow it, he says to his friends, and to the gods. I will make the best I can of the time I have left. I'm freeing myself from the lotus. I vow it. A hand on his shoulder. \"That's great. We're all proud of you,\" Hermes says. The god lifts him to his shoulders. Argyros looks back one final time at the hills, covered in lotuses, where so many others still lie dreaming for any number of reasons known only to themselves. The island recedes in the distance, fast, as Hermes carries Argyros the rest of the way to - wherever he's going, and Argyros looks forward to see.",

      "He can make basic plans for his day, to do something different, to imagine what he might do if he leaves this island...",
      "he prays his gratitude to Athena.",
      "He sees none of the gods again (save for one), after that initial meeting.",
      "These interactions take place solely in his mind, in the form of a wave of... of inspiration that comes to him when he prays.",
      "It's as though they loan him their strength, their power, when he calls upon them.",
      "It's unorthodox - he's accustomed to the gods either directly interfering, or completely ignoring the mortals.",
      "This... metaphysical action is new and strange - distant but encouraging.",
      "He finds he's more grateful for this new method - direct intervention would have been unlikely for a humble shepherd/soldier before, but even if they're not physically present, he feels their presence more closely this way, somehow.",
      "There are times, when he walks through the fields, when he thinks he sees faintly puzzled frowns on the faces of the Lotus-Eaters.",
      "He wonders if some of them are praying, too.",
      "After months of struggling, he feels clear-headed enough one day to walk to the water's edge.",
      "The waves lap at the sand.",
      "Argyros remembers all the ships of the Aegeans, bobbing in the harbor in sight of Troy's walls.",
      "He remembers being a boy and fishing with his brothers.",
      "He imagines his friends, the crew of Odysseus, sailing into the distance to die without him.",
      "\"Hey, buddy,\" comes a voice behind him.",
      "Argyros turns to look: it's Hermes, unexpectedly in person.",
      "The god is wearing a small, sympathetic smile.",
      "\"Dionysus thinks you shook off the worst of it.",
      "You ready for my part?\" Keep a positive attitude.",
      "Lots of jokes.",
      "Ask friends for help.",
      "\"...",
      "how am I going to do that?\"",
      "\"I'll carry you,\" Hermes says.",
      "\"Off the island.",
      "If you're ready to make that step.",
      "I'll take you somewhere you can make friends, and move forward.\"",
      "Argyros doesn't answer immediately.",
      "He looks out at the ocean, where his old friends died.",
      "Far across the water are the ruins of Troy, where even more of his friends died, and where he committed so many atrocities that he nearly destroyed himself to forget.",
      "I vow it, he says to his friends, and to the gods.",
      "I will make the best I can of the time I have left.",
      "I'm freeing myself from the lotus.",
      "I vow it.",
      "A hand on his shoulder.",
      "\"That's great.",
      "We're all proud of you,\" Hermes says.",
      "The god lifts him to his shoulders.",
      "Argyros looks back one final time at the hills, covered in lotuses, where so many others still lie dreaming for any number of reasons known only to themselves.",
      "The island recedes in the distance, fast, as Hermes carries Argyros the rest of the way to - wherever he's going, and Argyros looks forward to see."

    "text": "Dionysus beams at the awkward assembly of individuals. \"Ahh, excellent! I'm so glad all of you could make it!\" \"I mean... you kinda kidnapped me...\" mutters a young woman with thick, wavy dark hair pulled back messily. At least... the young woman might be a young woman. Her appearance is female... but given the members of this particular group, that assumption could easily be wrong. That's what the point is supposed to be. For her part, Siproites is excited to meet more people with an experience like her own, but the others look a little tense. She can understand that. It can be nerve-wracking. Dionysus smiles kindly at the maybe-kidnapped girl. \"I escorted you here, because I knew it was at least 50/50 you'd give me the slip by turning into a bird or whatever.\" This prompts a string of irritated-sounding chirps from an actual bird, with lovely tawny feathers, sitting on a branch over another, more mature-looking woman, holding a tiny adorable sleeping baby. The lady snorts in amusement but doesn't look over. She isn't looking at anything, in fact, just staring into space, and after a moment Siproites realizes the woman is blind. Dionysus inclines his head to the bird. \"Well, you're right, that was a little tactless of me. But since I already set the tactless precedent, let me go a little further and ask why in the fuck you're - \" \"My apologies. Am I late?\" A tall, beautiful person of indeterminate gender has arrived. He/she (they?) is taller than even Lord Dionysus, and has beautiful long black hair tied in a thick, loose braid, draped over their shoulder. Dionysus grins and claps their back. \"Not at all, Maph! We were just starting.\" The tall individual - Maph, apparently, takes a seat near Siproites and smiles at one of the two men seated across from them. Dionysus claps his hands. \"Right. That's everyone - well, since I think most of us don't know each other, we can start our little meeting with introductions.\" Siproites adores Lord Dionysus, though she knows enough by now (mostly through hearing Lady Artemis gossip) that he isn't always this calm... or this sober. (\"He's flamboyant and over-friendly whether he's a wild drunk or not, so I guess that's the core Dionysus,\" the Lady has said before, and Siproites thinks that's a fine core personality to have). In any case, when he takes on his role as the leader of... whatever they're going to start calling themselves, Dionysus is quite warm and confident. Not a hint of the wildness; not even a suggestion of cruelty he's supposedly capable of. Dionysus knows that this little group wouldn't particularly appreciate it. He stands up now - a handsome man with dark skin and long, wavy hair that falls perfectly on his shoulders. A little crown of grape leaves encircles his head; a reminder of his more prominent domain. He's smiling, the way he nearly always is smiling. \"As you all know, I am Dionysus, Lord of the Vine, master of dramatic arts, god of madness. You might not know about me before all that, when I was a child. When my mother Semele beheld the mighty Zeus, she was destroyed utterly and cast immediately into the Underworld.\" Everyone sits in shocked and awkward silence as he pauses here. One man hesitantly speaks. \"We... are surely sorry to hear of your loss, Lord Dionysus...\" \"Oh, thank you, Iphis, but no need. I went and rescued her from the Underworld already. That was a great story. Got my first boyfriend then too - well, I should say, my first boyfriend as a man. ANYWAY, Zeus rescued me from the ashes of my mother. I was still a fetus so he sewed me into his leg apparently and let me finish growing there. What a plan, right? Classic Zeus. He's practically my second mother!\" Another pause. \"So... Lord Zeus is one of us...?\" \"What? No. Well, maybe. But we're talking about me. Hera was still out ready to kill me so my uncle Hermes had the bright idea to hide me disguised as a girl. And I spent the first couple decades of my life as a girl, just hanging out with the other girls out in the hills with the nymphs! I eventually decided I wanted to present myself as a male and I've been Lord Dionysus ever since. But sometimes I switch back over to presenting as a girl when the mood takes me. Okay, next!\" He beams at them expectantly. Most of the group is still blinking at him in surprise at the revelation. Siproites hurries to fill in the silence. \"Er, hello everyone! My name is Siproites. I always - uh - felt like...\" Siproites is surprised at herself. This has been an accepted fact of her life for a while now, and yet, now that she's here with an audience of mostly-strangers watching her attentively, she's feeling shy. She twists her chiton in her hands. \"W-well, Lady Artemis says I had the 'heart of a woman.' All my life... but, uh, everyone else saw me as... as a boy. Because that's what I was, I guess. Or my body was. Um.\" She's blushing furiously now. This is harder to talk about nonchalantly than she would have guessed. \"I was out in the woods hunting, and I happened to walk out to a spring where Lady Artemis was bathing-\" There's a gasp from everyone present at this; Artemis has a certain reputation. \"But she said that when she turned to see who it was, she could tell instantly that I was meant to be a woman, and wasn't angry at all! And she changed me into this form and made me a nymph in her retinue! Um, and I'm very happy about it. Thank you very much for listening.\" There's some scattered applause and she slumps back into her seat. It's a relief having said, to people she's never met before, what her actual story was... and having them accept the truth of it without question. And they accept it even without Lady Artemis around to scowl threateningly at them! Dionysus gives her a quick side-hug and a kiss on the cheek. \"Thank you for breaking the ice, Sippy, my dear. All right, who's next?\" \"I had a lot in common with the first part of your story, Lord Dionysus,\" one of the two men offers. He has delicate features and honey-colored curls of hair. \"Not the second part, though, about changing back and forth. My name is Leucippus. I was born as a girl, but since my mother feared my father would reject a girl, she gave me a boy's name and raised me as a boy. I didn't know any better for years. I was always a boy - I played with the other boys and went to school and everything. But when I hit teenage years, I sort of... well, it was starting to be obvious that I wasn't a boy. It was the most horrifying thing... like my body suddenly betrayed me. I hated it. I hated looking at myself, hated having to deal with breasts and stuff... my mother was mostly worried someone was going to murder me. Possibly my father. So she prayed to Leto and the goddess heard and the next day I woke up with a dick.\" \"Oh - that's exactly what happened to me!\" exclaims the other man. He has deeply tanned skin and close-cropped hair, and his style of clothing marks him as Egyptian. \"My name is Iphis. I was born a girl but raised as a boy, because my parents couldn't afford a dowry on a daughter. I have no idea how long they thought they were going to get away with the ruse. Eventually I met my beloved - Ianthe. We wanted to get married, but we worried, because I was secretly a woman, and there weren't a lot of successful marriages between two women that we knew of. But then - well, Lord Hermaphroditus helped us - oh, but it's not Lord, is it??\" he asks, sounding distressed. The tall person with the braid, sitting next to Siproites, laughs and waves a hand. \"It probably shouldn't be either, I don't mind either one. Honestly, I'm not really a high-ranking enough deity to warrant an honorific. I'm just an Erote. But I guess if you have to pick one, I'd rather go with Lady... out of respect to who Salmacis used to be.\" The tension is back again, a little. The bird chirps in a questioning tone. The woman with the baby says, \"Yes - the gossip is a little... savage.\" \"I'm sure. It was an unusual affair.\" Hermaphroditus sighs. \"I'm... the fusion of two people. It's hard to describe it in words - I have to describe the old Hermaphroditus and Salmacis in the third person,' but... they're me. It's weird. I'll do my best. \"Hermaphroditus was - is - the son of Hermes and Aphrodite. So, pretty clever and good looking. But I... he... felt incomplete and odd his whole life. He couldn't tell why, just that he did. He got tired of talking about the masculine things over and over with the boys he knew; it just didn't interest him. Salmacis was also a little unusual, for a nymph. Most nymphs are very active and social, and love to run around with Artemis and hunt, and flirt with gods. Salmacis was more withdrawn. She didn't like to leave her spring; didn't really like to talk to people that much. It wasn't that she was unfriendly - she just didn't know how to talk to them. It didn't come naturally to me. To her. \"I'm not sure how we - they - ended up talking to each other. Hermaphroditus must have been wandering the woods hunting. But they did end up talking and -\" Here, Hermaphroditus pauses. Their eyes are a little watery. \"Forgive me. I don't - their conversations are rather personal to me. I'll summarize. They never, ever met anyone who understood each other like they did. They weren't lonely when they were with each other. They wanted to stay together forever - but, it wasn't quite the same as when two people fall in love, exactly. They wanted to be never parted. They wanted to be with each other. \"Lord Dionysus heard our prayer and responded. It was.... Stressful. Even though we wanted it. We both panicked, had doubts, struggled against each other. When I finally emerged, I was frightened and happy and sad and so, so fucking confused. But never lonely - never lonely again. Salmacis and Hermaphroditus were one person, sharing one mind, soul, and body. \"I went with Lord Dionysus to try to sort it all out: who was Salmacis, who was Hermaphroditus, where did they intersect to become me. In the meantime, the gossip started. Salmacis and Hermaphroditus had formed a new species of creature, a total joining of two people in love... and the world was obsessed with my genitals. By the time I was ready to talk about myself, the stories were already being passed around. Very lurid and depressing, as I guess you've heard. But it's a fool's errand to try to stop the gossip from spreading. The best I can do now, is to try to champion the cause of Hermaphroditus and Salmacis and be there for people who... who fall in between two roles, I guess.\" They sigh heavily when they're done, and Siproites can recognize the relief in having told the story to someone sympathetic. \"It's very brave of you, Lady Hermaphroditus,\" she says. \"To choose do something like that, with no idea what would become of you. I admire that very much.\" \"Eros agrees,\" says Dionysus - the first thing he's said in a while. He's watching his small flock of oddballs with shining eyes and the happiest smile on his face. \"And so do I. What an excellent example of courage and boldness you set, Maph, on how to speak confidently about yourself.\" The girl with messy hair sighs. \"Yeah, yeah, fine. Guess I'll get it over with. Mine's gonna be really anticlimactic after Hermaphroditus' story though.\" \"That's the spirit!\" \"I'm Mestra. I'm... not sure I should even be here. I'm just a girl.... I, uh. Slept with Poseidon a couple of times.\" Dionysus nods wisely. \"Who hasn't? He's prolific.\" The bird utters a short, sardonic-sounding tweet. Mestra grins a little wolfishly, then continues. \"I laid such exceptionally good pipe that he chose to reward me with the ability to shapeshift. And I got pretty good at that, too.\" As the others watch in astonishment, she changes into a dog, a cow, a bird (the tawny bird on the branch squawks in surprise), and then into a handsome young man. \"...I mean, honestly, I barely waited five minutes before I changed into a man the first time. You'd do it too, right? I was dying to see what it was like!\" \"And... what did you think?\" asks the woman with the baby, sounding curious. \"Fun. But I didn't care for it as much as being a woman.\" The woman nods, not looking surprised. \"Anyway, I mostly use this trick to con people and sometimes give my husband a wild night. But it's all my choice, you know? I don't feel like it's quite the same situation as yours. I was a woman from birth, and I'm a woman now. I just kind of swap in and out every once in a while.\" \"It's not as though there are a lot of rules applying to us,\" Dionysus says. \"And even if there were rules, my modus operandi would be to burn 'em. It doesn't really matter if you have or haven't suffered the same as someone else... or if your gender has stayed the same, or changed; and if it was your idea or someone else's. There's not really enough of us in the world to be nit-picky about membership. We're just a bunch of people who transcended their gender, you know? There's no rules yet, we're just the blind leading the blind here... please forgive the expression, Tiresias.\" The woman with the baby shrugs, lips quirking up in amusement. \"No offense taken, Lord Dionysus; the sentiment is correct enough. Not a lot of precedent for any of us to go on. It's been fairly enlightening, and I appreciate that. I didn't realize, for example, that King Poseidon was capable of such a generous gift.\" At this remark... the tawny bird begins singing. It sings at length, using many different tones. Tiresias sits quietly, nodding along, while the rest of them watch the two in awkward silence. Eventually the bird trails off and Tiresias says \"He must have found it droll. That's lucky.\" The bird begins tweeting again, and finally Mestra breaks in. \"Excuse me, but I have... no idea... what's going on. Is this bird talking to you?\" Tiresias sits blankly for a moment. \"You're a bird?!\" \"Well, I'm not, I meant - \" \"Right, right,\" Tiresias says impatiently. \"I mean Caeneus??\" The bird chirps once. \"Oh, you were getting to that part. I think you might have buried the lead a little, friend.\" \"Is Caeneus the bird's name? What do you mean to tell us, you didn't know you've been talking to this bird?\" \"How would I know? I'm blind!\" \"But it sounds like a bird? That is, all I've heard is birdsong...\" Iphis puts in, sounding as bewildered as the others. \"Oh, by the gods. This is awkward.\" Tiresias looks as though she would be rolling her eyes if she could. Off to the side, Dionysus is snickering. \"I was given the ability to understand the songs of birds, recently. Apparently it sounds like ordinary speech to me now.\" \"You can understand birds' songs?!\" Siproites blurts out. How lucky is that!! \"Yes. It was given to me as a gift because Lady Athena felt bad for blinding me.\" \"You were blinded??\" \"Yes, for coming upon her as she bathed.\" \"But you're...\" \"No. I'm not a woman. Or, well, best to be truthful: I am, now. Didn't used to be.\" The baby in her arms drowses awake and begins to cry. Tiresias shifts her chiton, parting it to reveal a breast, and coaxes the baby to begin nursing. \"Before I tell my story, though, it seems rude not to acknowledge Caeneus' tale. He spoke first, after all. Caeneus, shall I tell them what you told me?\" The bird ruffles its feathers and chirps once. This is so obviously a bird's version of a shrug that it doesn't need translating. \"Well, the story as Caeneus related it, is that he was born as Caenis - a woman. Caenis was fairly pretty, and quite popular in her village. She was constantly being pestered by the men there. She supposed she was going to have to pick one of them eventually but the idea held no appeal to her. Not just because she would lose whatever independence she had, but also because the concept of having sex with a man being a fun thing to do, seemed doubtful to her. As she was moping along the seashore one day, Poseidon appeared and offered to let Caenis sleep with him as an experiment - since he was probably the best lover of all the gods. If she wasn't satisfied after a night with him, then she'd know not to bother wasting her time with any men at all.\" Dionysus is laughing at this. \"Uh, since when was Poseidon the best lover of all the gods? Over Apollo? Over Hermes?\" Tiresias and Caeneus the bird both shrug. \"I'm only relating what was said, Lord Dionysus. I would never dream of comparing the prowess of any god over another,\" Tiresias says smoothly. \"In any case, Caenis took him up on his offer, and hated it. Hated every second of it and told him so afterwards.\" There's a loud collective gasp from the group. Dionysus has raised his eyebrows. \"Is that why you're a bird? Pretty lucky, if so!\" Caeneus tweets in annoyance. Tiresias continues: \"He says that came later and was barely related. Poseidon apparently was so caught off guard by the blunt honesty that he only laughed about it. Caenis amended her story to elaborate that she thought he was probably technically doing a good job of it (and he thought that was funny too) but she just hated the idea of having him inside her - having anyone inside her. The thought felt repulsive and wrong, and it wouldn't matter who it was. Er, that's where you left off your story, Caeneus?\" The bird chirps a bit longer, flapping its wings here and there for emphasis at points. Tiresias jostles the baby a little, to ensure it doesn't fall asleep while feeding, and repeats the story. \"So Poseidon said since she'd been such a good sport about trying in the first place, and she'd done a good job of putting out, he'd change her into a man so she wouldn't ever have to do it again. Caenis became Caeneus, and adored having a dick. Poseidon suggested giving a test run of the new body, and - actually, Caeneus, I don't think we need the play by play. Let's just say you were happy about it. Right. Poseidon also gave Caeneus impenetrable skin, as a freebie at the end, as little joke because of how much he'd hated being penetrated. \"After that, with the extra testosterone and new confidence in never being able to be stabbed or shot in any way, Caeneus joyfully went off to be the best warrior he could be. He went Ares-style - just starting fights with every ruffian and monster he could find. His impenetrable skin gave him an edge in nearly every battle. He was actually getting a decent reputation going, but he got into a fight with a bunch of centaurs. He killed a bunch of them, and they couldn't get a single blow in to him... so they cheated and attempted to bury him alive beneath a million tons of felled tree trunks. Poseidon was still fond of his lover, so he rescued him, but he did it by turning him into the bird you see here until he 'learned to be more responsible and less combative.' And that is the tale of Caeneus.\" \"Wow... I mean, that's a pretty amazing story, but damn, if Poseidon is telling you go be more responsible and less combative, maybe it's time for a little self-reflection,\" Mestra observes. If it's possible for a bird to look guilty and sullen at the same time, Caeneus is pulling it off well. \"There's not always anything useful to learn from reflecting on a god's punishment,\" Tiresias says. \"I, also, am undergoing a two-pronged transformative punishment.\" \"Oohh, yeah, let's hear this,\" Dionysus says. \"I admit, I am curious too... I had only heard of Tiresias, the prophet? Are you that same person?\" asks Iphis. \"I am. I was born as a male in Thebes, and was given the gift of prophecy from Lord Apollo. Let me please cut off any jokes in advance: I have heard them before and they have ceased to amuse. Being clairvoyant and having the ability to predict the future did not and does not give me the ability to foresee all the misfortunes that may fall upon me. Only if a god chooses to share my fate, will I see it. And Apollo did not choose to warn me of my own fate; only the fate of others.\" \"He's probably forging you into something special, I bet,\" Leucippus says. \"Trying to prod you through a bunch of experiences or something. Lady Leto said that about my experiences, and I barely even suffered, really.\" \"So I must be on the way to being something truly amazing, then?\" Tiresias asks wryly. \"Perhaps. It has been enlightening. But damned inconvenient, too. I was walking along the road on Mount Cyllene, and my walking stick disturbed two snakes copulating. Zeus and Hera had some kind of investment in these two snakes, and my disruption messed it all up, so Hera turned me into a woman - which seemed kind of non sequitur, but in hindsight I think the snakes may have both been female, so maybe that's the connection. Anyway... I made my way through the world as a woman for a while, though I still felt completely like a male on the inside. Perhaps that's why Athena reacted the way she did - I approached a spring, intending to wash myself, and Athena was there already, bathing and naked.\" \"Ohh, really? She never lets anyone get a glimpse! Pan's been trying for years. The rest of us are a little too in love with being alive to even try.\" \"Well, the two-and-a-half second glance I got as I was walking down to the water revealed a pretty remarkable beauty - but it was the last thing I saw before she whipped around and blinded me on the spot. I assume she must have sensed I had the soul of a man, and acted on reflex.\" Siproites shifts uncomfortably. That might have been her fate, too, had Lady Artemis not taken a spare moment to actually look at the girl, first. Dionysus is shaking his head. \"Nah, I doubt it, actually. She probably would have done it if you'd been a man, a woman, or even a bird. Athena REALLY shuts down peepers of all sorts.\" Tiresias sighs. \"Even less to learn from that experience, then.... Well, in any case, she said she felt bad, seeing me sitting there in a foot of water, blind and bewildered about what the fuck had even just happened. She couldn't un-blind me, apparently, but to make up for it she gave me the ability to understand the speech of birds. It's useful at times, but most of the time - Caeneus, you might be able to confirm this - birds are mostly yelling about food, sex, or cats.\" Caeneus chirps in agreement. \"So the birdsong got a little less delightful to listen to. But still, they're useful sources of information at times. And being a woman was something I got used to as well. I became a priestess of Hera at one time, in hopes that I might impress her enough to lift the curse, but while I was doing that I ended up getting pregnant. This is Manto, my daughter. Giving birth to her was the weirdest prolonged session of body horror I've ever experienced, but I'm quite pleased with the result.\" Tiresias shows everyone the sleepy baby; they all coo accordingly. \"Cute kid, Tiresias,\" says Dionysus. \"I'm sure it was weird, but there have definitely been weirder ways of giving birth, if it makes you feel any better.\" \"Thank you, Lord Dionysus, that is a consolation.\" \"And now, we've all met each other!\" Dionysus claps his hands together. \"Lovely to have met you all!\" Everyone claps dutifully. \"So, what's next on the agenda?\" Tiresias asks. \"Ah! Right. After the introductions. What are we going to do next.\" Dionysus considers for a moment, then shrugs. \"Dunno! I didn't really have a plan.\" Everyone blinks at him. \"No... plan? We all just... came here to hang out?\" Mestra asks. Dionysus spreads his hands. \"Parties are kind of my specialty, you know? And anyway, if you hadn't come to this introduction party, you wouldn't have met so many kindred spirits, would you? Mestra, you and Caeneus can swap gossip about Poseidon's prowess together... or, Tiresias, you can chat with Caeneus about men-being-punished-by the gods- stuff together!\" \"My favorite topic of conversation.\" \"...and Iphis and Leucippus have a lot in common, they know that now. And Sippy, you and Iphis can probably talk a bit about what it's like to feel like you were in the wrong body for so long. And Hermaphroditus...\" Dionysus trails off a bit, stumped here. Hermaphroditus smiles. \"I don't have a lot in common with anyone at this point - but, I think you're right. This has been wonderful just to meet other people who don't quite fit neatly into their roles, either. Even if we never even speak of our unique situations again, it will be a relief to have friends who we can speak to, safely. Thank you for this party, Lord Dionysus.\" The others murmur agreement, beginning to smile more and talk as they also see the value in just having a sacred circle of understanding friends. They mill around for a while afterwards, and as Dionysus predicted, the ice-breaking introductions have launched further conversations. Siproites thinks Tiresias is very funny - dry and sarcastic. She's also a fan of Mestra, who is probably the boldest woman Siproites has ever met outside of Artemis' Grove. Hours later, when everyone has gone their separate ways and promised to keep in touch, Dionysus is escorting Siproites back to the Grove. \"I think you did a wonderful job today, Lord Dionysus,\" Siproites tells him. \"You were completely right; it was so nice just to have a group of us - an official group! Being officially acknowledged makes me feel very... well... I don't know the word. But it's really nice! And everyone there was very nice, too, I can't wait for us all to meet again!\" Dionysus bows to her. \"When duty becomes pleasure, sweet Sippy. I've never been happier to fulfill my responsibilities as a god.\"",

      "(\"He's flamboyant and over-friendly whether he's a wild drunk or not, so I guess that's the core Dionysus,\" the Lady has said before, and Siproites thinks that's a fine core personality to have).",
      "In any case, when he takes on his role as the leader of... whatever they're going to start calling themselves, Dionysus is quite warm and confident.",
      "Not a hint of the wildness; not even a suggestion of cruelty he's supposedly capable of.",
      "Dionysus knows that this little group wouldn't particularly appreciate it.",
      "He stands up now - a handsome man with dark skin and long, wavy hair that falls perfectly on his shoulders.",
      "A little crown of grape leaves encircles his head; a reminder of his more prominent domain.",
      "He's smiling, the way he nearly always is smiling.",

      "I went and rescued her from the Underworld already.",
      "That was a great story.",
      "Got my first boyfriend then too - well, I should say, my first boyfriend as a man.",
      "ANYWAY, Zeus rescued me from the ashes of my mother.",
      "I was still a fetus so he sewed me into his leg apparently and let me finish growing there.",
      "What a plan, right?",
      "Classic Zeus.",

      "No",

      "I eventually decided I wanted to present myself as a male and I've been Lord Dionysus ever since.",

      "\"W-well, Lady Artemis says I had the 'heart of a woman.'",
      "All my life... but, uh, everyone else saw me as... as a boy.",
      "Because that's what I was, I guess.",
      "Or my body was.",
      "Um.\"",
      "She's blushing furiously now.",
      "This is harder to talk about nonchalantly than she would have guessed.",
      "\"I was out in the woods hunting, and I happened to walk out to a spring where Lady Artemis was bathing-\" There's a gasp from everyone present at this; Artemis has a certain reputation.",
      "\"But she said that when she turned to see who it was, she could tell instantly that I was meant to be a woman, and wasn't angry at all!",
      "And she changed me into this form and made me a nymph in her retinue!",
      "Um, and I'm very happy about it.",
      "Thank you very much for listening.\"",
      "There's some scattered applause and she slumps back into her seat.",
      "It's a relief having said, to people she's never met before, what her actual story was... and having them accept the truth of it without question.",
      "And they accept it even without Lady Artemis around to scowl threateningly at them!",
      "Dionysus gives her a quick side-hug and a kiss on the cheek.",

      "I didn't know any better for years.",
      "I was always a boy - I played with the other boys and went to school and everything.",
      "But when I hit teenage years, I sort of... well, it was starting to be obvious that I wasn't a boy.",
      "It was the most horrifying thing... like my body suddenly betrayed me.",
      "I hated it.",
      "I hated looking at myself, hated having to deal with breasts and stuff... my mother was mostly worried someone was going to murder me.",
      "Possibly my father.",
      "So she prayed to Leto and the goddess heard and the next day I woke up with a dick.\"",

      "\"It probably shouldn't be either, I don't mind either one.",
      "Honestly, I'm not really a high-ranking enough deity to warrant an honorific.",
      "I'm just an Erote.",

      "The tension is back again, a little.",
      "The bird chirps in a questioning tone.",

      "I'll do my best.",
      "\"Hermaphroditus was - is - the son of Hermes and Aphrodite.",

      "He got tired of talking about the masculine things over and over with the boys he knew; it just didn't interest him.",
      "Salmacis was also a little unusual, for a nymph.",
      "Most nymphs are very active and social, and love to run around with Artemis and hunt, and flirt with gods.",
      "Salmacis was more withdrawn.",
      "She didn't like to leave her spring; didn't really like to talk to people that much.",
      "It wasn't that she was unfriendly - she just didn't know how to talk to them.",

      "But never lonely - never lonely again.",
      "Salmacis and Hermaphroditus were one person, sharing one mind, soul, and body.",

      "In the meantime, the gossip started.",
      "Salmacis and Hermaphroditus had formed a new species of creature, a total joining of two people in love... and the world was obsessed with my genitals.",
      "By the time I was ready to talk about myself, the stories were already being passed around.",
      "Very lurid and depressing, as I guess you've heard.",
      "But it's a fool's errand to try to stop the gossip from spreading.",
      "The best I can do now, is to try to champion the cause of Hermaphroditus and Salmacis and be there for people who... who fall in between two roles, I guess.\"",
      "They sigh heavily when they're done, and Siproites can recognize the relief in having told the story to someone sympathetic.",
      "\"It's very brave of you, Lady Hermaphroditus,\" she says.",
      "\"To choose do something like that, with no idea what would become of you.",
      "I admire that very much.\"",
      "\"Eros agrees,\" says Dionysus - the first thing he's said in a while.",
      "He's watching his small flock of oddballs with shining eyes and the happiest smile on his face.",
      "\"And so do I. What an excellent example of courage and boldness you set, Maph, on how to speak confidently about yourself.\"",

      "I was a woman from birth, and I'm a woman now.",
      "I just kind of swap in and out every once in a while.\"",
      "\"It's not as though there are a lot of rules applying to us,\" Dionysus says.",
      "\"And even if there were rules, my modus operandi would be to burn 'em.",
      "It doesn't really matter if you have or haven't suffered the same as someone else... or if your gender has stayed the same, or changed; and if it was your idea or someone else's.",
      "There's not really enough of us in the world to be nit-picky about membership.",

      "It sings at length, using many different tones.",

      "That's lucky.\"",
      "The bird begins tweeting again, and finally Mestra breaks in.",
      "\"Excuse me, but I have... no idea... what's going on.",

      "\"You can understand birds' songs?!\"",
      "Siproites blurts out.",
      "How lucky is that!!",
      "\"Yes.",
      "It was given to me as a gift because Lady Athena felt bad for blinding me.\"",
      "\"You were blinded??\"",
      "\"Yes, for coming upon her as she bathed.\"",

      "Tiresias shifts her chiton, parting it to reveal a breast, and coaxes the baby to begin nursing.",
      "\"Before I tell my story, though, it seems rude not to acknowledge Caeneus' tale.",
      "He spoke first, after all.",
      "Caeneus, shall I tell them what you told me?\"",
      "The bird ruffles its feathers and chirps once.",
      "This is so obviously a bird's version of a shrug that it doesn't need translating.",
      "\"Well, the story as Caeneus related it, is that he was born as Caenis - a woman.",
      "Caenis was fairly pretty, and quite popular in her village.",
      "She was constantly being pestered by the men there.",
      "She supposed she was going to have to pick one of them eventually but the idea held no appeal to her.",
      "Not just because she would lose whatever independence she had, but also because the concept of having sex with a man being a fun thing to do, seemed doubtful to her.",
      "As she was moping along the seashore one day, Poseidon appeared and offered to let Caenis sleep with him as an experiment - since he was probably the best lover of all the gods.",
      "If she wasn't satisfied after a night with him, then she'd know not to bother wasting her time with any men at all.\"",
      "Dionysus is laughing at this.",
      "\"Uh",
      ", since when was Poseidon the best lover of all the gods?",
      "Over Apollo?",
      "Over Hermes?\" Tiresias and Caeneus the bird both shrug.",
      "\"I'm only relating what was said, Lord Dionysus.",
      "I would never dream of comparing the prowess of any god over another,\" Tiresias says smoothly.",
      "\"In any case, Caenis took him up on his offer, and hated it.",
      "Hated every second of it and told him so afterwards.\"",
      "There's a loud collective gasp from the group.",
      "Dionysus has raised his eyebrows.",
      "\"Is that why you're a bird?",
      "Pretty lucky, if so!\"",
      "Caeneus tweets in annoyance.",
      "Tiresias continues: \"He says that came later and was barely related.",
      "Poseidon apparently was so caught off guard by the blunt honesty that he only laughed about it.",
      "Caenis amended her story to elaborate that she thought he was probably technically doing a good job of it (and he thought that was funny too) but she just hated the idea of having him inside her - having anyone inside her.",
      "The thought felt repulsive and wrong, and it wouldn't matter who it was.",
      "Er, that's where you left off your story, Caeneus?\"",
      "The bird chirps a bit longer, flapping its wings here and there for emphasis at points.",
      "Tiresias jostles the baby a little, to ensure it doesn't fall asleep while feeding, and repeats the story.",
      "\"So Poseidon said since she'd been such a good sport about trying in the first place, and she'd done a good job of putting out, he'd change her into a man so she wouldn't ever have to do it again.",
      "Caenis became Caeneus, and adored having a dick.",
      "Poseidon suggested giving a test run of the new body, and - actually, Caeneus, I don't think we need the play by play.",
      "Let's just say you were happy about it.",
      "Right.",
      "Poseidon also gave Caeneus impenetrable skin, as a freebie at the end, as little joke because of how much he'd hated being penetrated.",
      "\"After that, with the extra testosterone and new confidence in never being able to be stabbed or shot in any way, Caeneus joyfully went off to be the best warrior he could be.",
      "He went Ares-style - just starting fights with every ruffian and monster he could find.",
      "His impenetrable skin gave him an edge in nearly every battle.",
      "He was actually getting a decent reputation going, but he got into a fight with a bunch of centaurs.",
      "He killed a bunch of them, and they couldn't get a single blow in to him...",
      "so they cheated and attempted to bury him alive beneath a million tons of felled tree trunks.",
      "Poseidon was still fond of his lover, so he rescued him, but he did it by turning him into the bird you see here until he 'learned to be more responsible and less combative.'",
      "And that is the tale of Caeneus.\"",
      "\"Wow... I mean, that's a pretty amazing story, but damn, if Poseidon is telling you go be more responsible and less combative, maybe it's time for a little self-reflection,\" Mestra observes.",
      "If it's possible for a bird to look guilty and sullen at the same time, Caeneus is pulling it off well.",
      "\"There's not always anything useful to learn from reflecting on a god's punishment,\" Tiresias says.",
      "\"I, also, am undergoing a two-pronged transformative punishment.\"",
      "\"Oohh, yeah, let's hear this,\" Dionysus says.",
      "\"I admit, I am curious too...",
      "I had only heard of Tiresias, the prophet?",
      "Are you that same person?\" asks Iphis.",
      "\"I am.",
      "I was born as a male in Thebes, and was given the gift of prophecy from Lord Apollo.",
      "Let me please cut off any jokes in advance: I have heard them before and they have ceased to amuse.",
      "Being clairvoyant and having the ability to predict the future did not and does not give me the ability to foresee all the misfortunes that may fall upon me.",
      "Only if a god chooses to share my fate, will I see it.",
      "And Apollo did not choose to warn me of my own fate; only the fate of others.\"",
      "\"He's probably forging you into something special, I bet,\" Leucippus says.",
      "\"Trying to prod you through a bunch of experiences or something.",
      "Lady Leto said that about my experiences, and I barely even suffered, really.\"",
      "\"So I must be on the way to being something truly amazing, then?\" Tiresias asks wryly.",
      "\"Perhaps.",
      "It has been enlightening.",
      "But damned inconvenient, too.",
      "I was walking along the road on Mount Cyllene, and my walking stick disturbed two snakes copulating.",
      "Zeus and Hera had some kind of investment in these two snakes, and my disruption messed it all up, so Hera turned me into a woman - which seemed kind of non sequitur, but in hindsight I think the snakes may have both been female, so maybe that's the connection.",
      "Anyway...",
      "I made my way through the world as a woman for a while, though I still felt completely like a male on the inside.",
      "Perhaps that's why Athena reacted the way she did - I approached a spring, intending to wash myself, and Athena was there already, bathing and naked.\"",
      "\"Ohh, really?",
      "She never lets anyone get a glimpse!",
      "Pan's been trying for years.",
      "The rest of us are a little too in love with being alive to even try.\"",
      "\"Well, the two-and-a-half second glance I got as I was walking down to the water revealed a pretty remarkable beauty - but it was the last thing I saw before she whipped around and blinded me on the spot.",
      "I assume she must have sensed I had the soul of a man, and acted on reflex.\"",
      "Siproites shifts uncomfortably.",
      "That might have been her fate, too, had Lady Artemis not taken a spare moment to actually look at the girl, first.",
      "Dionysus is shaking his head.",
      "\"Nah, I doubt it, actually.",
      "She probably would have done it if you'd been a man, a woman, or even a bird.",
      "Athena REALLY shuts down peepers of all sorts.\"",
      "Tiresias sighs.",
      "\"Even less to learn from that experience, then....",
      "Well, in any case, she said she felt bad, seeing me sitting there in a foot of water, blind and bewildered about what the fuck had even just happened.",
      "She couldn't un-blind me, apparently, but to make up for it she gave me the ability to understand the speech of birds.",
      "It's useful at times, but most of the time - Caeneus, you might be able to confirm this - birds are mostly yelling about food, sex, or cats.\"",
      "Caeneus chirps in agreement.",
      "\"So the birdsong got a little less delightful to listen to.",
      "But still, they're useful sources of information at times.",
      "And being a woman was something I got used to as well.",
      "I became a priestess of Hera at one time, in hopes that I might impress her enough to lift the curse, but while I was doing that I ended up getting pregnant.",
      "This is Manto, my daughter.",
      "Giving birth to her was the weirdest prolonged session of body horror I've ever experienced, but I'm quite pleased with the result.\"",
      "Tiresias shows everyone the sleepy baby; they all coo accordingly.",
      "\"Cute kid, Tiresias,\" says Dionysus.",
      "\"I'm sure it was weird, but there have definitely been weirder ways of giving birth, if it makes you feel any better.\"",
      "\"Thank you, Lord Dionysus, that is a consolation.\"",
      "\"And now, we've all met each other!\"",
      "Dionysus claps his hands together.",
      "\"Lovely to have met you all!\"",
      "Everyone claps dutifully.",
      "\"So, what's next on the agenda?\" Tiresias asks.",
      "\"Ah! Right.",
      "After the introductions.",
      "What are we going to do next.\"",
      "Dionysus considers for a moment, then shrugs.",
      "\"Dunno!",
      "I didn't really have a plan.\"",
      "Everyone blinks at him.",
      "\"No... plan?",
      "We all just... came here to hang out?\" Mestra asks.",
      "Dionysus spreads his hands.",
      "\"Parties are kind of my specialty, you know?",
      "And anyway, if you hadn't come to this introduction party, you wouldn't have met so many kindred spirits, would you?",
      "Mestra, you and Caeneus can swap gossip about Poseidon's prowess together... or, Tiresias, you can chat with Caeneus about men-being-punished-by the gods- stuff together!\"",
      "\"My favorite topic of conversation.\"",
      "\"...and Iphis and Leucippus have a lot in common, they know that now.",

      "Hermaphroditus smiles.",

      "Siproites thinks Tiresias is very funny - dry and sarcastic.",
      "She's also a fan of Mestra, who is probably the boldest woman Siproites has ever met outside of Artemis' Grove.",

      "I don't know the word.",

    "text": "Ares stands before them, the only way he knows how: defiantly, angrily. His anger at the moment is silent and scowling. He is standing before them, in chains, because of his anger of only a few days ago, which was furious and fatal. His defiance is clear even though he is in chains. Alcippe is not present. The trial was not thought, at first, to concern her, other than peripherally. ----------- Artemis is grim. There are many conflicting thoughts in her mind now, watching her half-brother face Zeus and the council. She remembers those shitheads Actaeon and Orion, and others. Those two fucking Aloadai, who'd captured Ares... who was trying to defend Hera, and Artemis herself, from a similar threat. But she also remembers Callisto...Aura... and others. Artemis obviously has committed no rape, but if the question answered today is whether the man is accountable, rather than the woman... Then Artemis' hands are not clean. But she has to defend the sanctity of her domain. Once a woman's virginity is gone, it's gone. The woman's been irrevocably claimed by men at that point; she can't come back to Artemis' retinue, and Artemis can't help her after that... right...? ---------- Beside Zeus, Hera gazes at her son. She's mostly unconcerned with the finer details, since she already has no intention of allowing Ares to be thrown into Tartarus, or whatever foolish blustering threat her husband and their brother have declared. Let the storm-gods storm; she will keep their wilder justices in check. She had entertained the possibility that Ares might be required to serve Poseidon as penance, or some mortal king, much as Apollo or Poseidon himself had once done, in order to set things right. And at first, that seemed to be a foregone conclusion. But the mood has shifted among the council, which... is unexpected. Alcippe was unmarried. No violation of a wedding oath occurred, so Hera's direct interest is limited and pre-established laws don't really encompass the girl's violation. It's unusual that Ares would have taken such an interest in a mortal daughter; so some of Poseidon's rage seemed warranted. After all, who could expect it to occur to Halirrhotius, to ask Ares for permission to bed his daughter? Ares had spoken, voice tight with anger. \"He never asked her, either.\" Well, why should he? The man pursues; the woman either flees or embraces. That's life. And yet... Porphyrion. That had been a close call for Hera. If there had been another goddess of marriage, witnessing Hera's struggle with Porphyrion, if Zeus had not flung his bolt in time to kill the giant... I would have had the woman destroyed, Hera thinks. Hmm. ------- Hermes is thinking now of Tanagra: a nymph, the daughter of a river god. Hermes had participated in a raid, wherein he, Apollo, Zeus, and Poseidon had sneaked away Tanagra and her eight sisters from their father. It had actually been a light-hearted affair, and the girls had enjoyed themselves. No hard feelings, that Hermes was aware of. But he remembers that Ares had found Hermes shuttling away a squealing Tanagra, and had actually challenged Hermes to a fistfight. Hermes had thought at the time that Ares wanted in on the fun. Ares had fought brutally, but lost, and refused to speak to him for months afterwards. Hermes had assumed he was jealous that Hermes got to have awesome sex with a hot nymph, and Ares hadn't. Now he wonders if Ares had been fearful for the girl. He also remembers Apemosyne, another consensual roll in the hay. Apemosyne had been traveling with her brother on the road, and as the god of travelers, it had been Hermes' pleasure to sneak her away for a blessing. She'd been a lot of fun. They'd kissed afterwards and when he told her to remember him, she'd teased that he might have to find her again to remind her. When her brother had asked her where she'd been, she'd answered honestly, still feeling the rush from her afternoon with a god. Her brother had called her a whore and kicked her to death on the spot. There's a danger, to women who sleep with men, whether they say yes or no. It's just dawning on Hermes now, but clearly Ares has always been aware. ------------- Apollo's face is passive. He's had his share of indiscretions, but fewer than people suppose - his sister Artemis is one powerful deterrent, but for the most part, those of his lovers who are unwilling typically manage to escape him. He has a long list of nymphs, mortals, and goddesses alike who have rejected him in increasingly ridiculous ways. Persephone ran away to be Queen of the Land of the Dead. Bolina threw herself off a cliff. Daphne... sweet, beautiful Daphne, begged to Gaia to be turned into a tree, rather than endure Apollo's embrace. Apollo had taken these rejections as insults... which is largely how they were interpreted by the other gods, as well; a running joke on Olympus. Helios in particular thinks it's hilarious. Granted, Ares is dumb as a rock and stalks the world looking for reasons to start a fight. But his willingness to go up against his better, to challenge the Lord of the Sea on behalf of his daughter when she pleaded for him to help - it gives Apollo pause. He considers, for the first time, that maybe Daphne didn't turn into a tree just to insult him. ----------- Demeter has never taken a consort, though Poseidon came close. Lovers? Yes, certainly. Many, in fact. She takes them happily, for the most part; it's an aspect of her role of fertility goddess that she greatly enjoys. She takes a young man - or even a young woman, sometimes, for the hell of it, though nothing fertile comes of such a union - and they have their fun and part their ways and Demeter's fertile body provides a child. More than she's even bothered to tell Zeus or Hera about. She's had many, many lovers. The only goddess more sex-positive than Demeter is Aphrodite. And yet even Demeter has been forced. By Poseidon himself, in fact. He had come to her when she was wandering the barren earth in misery, still trying to find her lost daughter, and forced himself upon her when sex was the last thing she wanted. She'd wept throughout the affair; he'd seemed annoyed and bewildered. She'd enjoyed herself the previous time they'd been together; Poseidon had apparently thought this would cheer her up. It would have been impossible for her to argue her case, so she didn't bother: 1) Demeter's not married, so no marriage oaths were violated. 2) She'd had sex with Poseidon plenty of times before with no complaints. 3) She was too depressed to even care as much as she should. Who could care about anything, when Persephone was missing? It's just the way of things. And ultimately, she cared for her children by the rape as much as she cared for any of her other children - which was to say, she adored them - so what was the problem, exactly? Ares, of all people, is putting his finger on it: Poseidon didn't care if she wanted it or not. He took from her without concern for her happiness or well-being. Demeter stands, waiting only a moment for Poseidon to trail off in surprise, and begins to speak in Ares' defense. She may not be known for her eloquence. She's a brash and simple woman of action, not words, but she feels an urgent need to find her voice now. ----------------- Hestia is mostly silent as she watches. She knows all of these gods and goddesses; all are welcome at her hearth, and all open their hearts to her. She has a pretty good idea how all of them are reacting to this moment, and is stirred to see that the trial of her nephew is slowly starting a revolution in all their minds. She doesn't think it will happen immediately. But Ares' willingness to go on trial before them has started them all to reconsidering. She's already decided that Ares will be the first welcomed to her hearth after this is done, but for Demeter's bravery in coming forth to say, \"Yes, me too,\" Hestia will embrace her warmly. For her own part, she agrees fully with Ares' stand. Hestia remembers that night, with Priapus. She remembers that agonizingly long moment of terror, the horror that her body might be taken from her, the fury and humiliation that for all she'd accomplished in her life, everything she was, could be reduced to just an available body for a man to shove into. Unfortunately, it seems that gods and mortals alike have difficulty imagining the unimaginable, and have to wait until it either happens to them, or someone else jolts them out of their haze. --------------- Yes, it is her lover standing before her on trial, and Aphrodite has no intention of voting against him. She knows Ares better than any other god around her; she has full confidence that if he spilled blood outside of the battlefield, then there was justifiable purpose behind it. Ares usually stores up his anger and frustrations and vents them in war against other soldiers; he never targets an individual for his wrath. But her vote alone won't save Ares, and she follows along with their arguments with white-gripped knuckles. Demeter is speaking now, empathizing with Alcippe and defending Ares. It's curious. Like her son, Eros, Aphrodite has difficulty understanding why it is that men and women, gods and mortals, struggle so much when it comes to love and sex. To her mind, it shouldn't be so burdened with obligation and - and significance. In this respect, she would theoretically side with the men in these rape cases - love should be easy, love should be casual! And even if the sex is unwanted - why on earth should one grieve and carry on? Look elsewhere for better love, better sex. She'd always thought that was Demeter's view, too. But that said, she certainly agrees that love should be consensual. Perhaps women protest too much; but rape is the wrong solution. Maybe it would be easier for women to agree to sex if, legally, they were allowed to agree, rather than just aiming her charms at the man she liked, and her scowls at the men she didn't, and hoping for the best. She sighs. Pandora kind of shut down that idea. ---------------- Hephaestus runs his thumb over the head of his cane. He and Ares are not yet the paragon of brotherly love, and probably never will be. Hephaestus still feels an admittedly unfair anger that Ares has led this charmed life up on Olympus, revered as a god from the moment of his birth. For his part, Ares has some kind of anger towards Hephaestus as well, which Heph chalks up to jealousy that Aphrodite married him and not Ares. A lot of gods have made comments along those lines: \"congratulations... damn, I wish it could have been me\" is a weird thing to say at a man's wedding. Ares keeps hanging out in his forge... it's so fucking awkward. At the end of the day, Heph just doesn't like Ares, and his anger about the marriage doesn't say a favorable lot towards his respect for another man's business. He sighs. Hephaestus doesn't feel he can weigh in on this one. He's clearly biased against the defendant, and honestly, he's been so sheltered from normal social interactions between men and women that he probably wouldn't even recognize an illicit sexual affair if he saw one. It's a problem. Maybe it's good that he knows it, but as the saying goes, you can name the tune a thousand times and not make it go away. He can't possibly trust his own feelings in this case; he'll vote with the crowd. --------- He's a late addition to Olympus - not the last immortal, since there are several who have joined the pantheon after him, and probably more to come. But it's looking as though Dionysus will be the final deity to sit on Zeus' High Council, and he came a long time after things had been established on Olympus. Dionysus was raised as a girl, and is just as intimately aware of the threats against a woman as any of the goddesses present. He has a unique advantage, as well, in seeing his social ability to choose a lover go from zero to 100% once he presented himself as male, and sees the unfairness of it. It's... extremely regrettable, then, that once he was permanently identified as a male god, he sometimes abused his new privilege. Yes, he was only following the ways of the world as they had been established long before his apotheosis, but he should have known better. Yes, he was under the influence of alcohol and madness at the time, but he still should have known better. He was a woman before he was a man or a god, and he betrayed his first community. So he's glad that Ares took the first step. Ares, god of courage, who did the unpopular thing because he knew it was right, and opened the door for Dionysus to start to right wrongs. Dionysus waits until Demeter has said her piece before he stands to defend Ares as well. As he speaks, he sees the faint bewilderment on the faces of the other gods and thinks to himself that he may need to step up to his duties as the god of madness - or specifically, its opposite: mental health. There are a lot of individuals here in need of therapy. ------- Zeus listens closely to the arguments for and against his son. He and Poseidon - probably all the gods present - had thought this would be a fairly straightforward trial. Both of the brothers are shocked to find that it's going unexpectedly. Demeter spoke; then Dionysus; then Hermes added a story of how Ares has felt passionately about this for years; and then Hestia (!!) chimed in to softly agree and remind everyone of how close she'd come to being a victim as well. This is troubling. He can see it on everyone's faces; they're disturbed. He is, too. Like most other gods he knows, Zeus prefers a willing lover. He enjoys seeing a positive effect on his partner; enjoys knowing that someone is taking pleasure in his attentions and his company. But there is a long, long list of names that he remembers who had run from him. And although the other gods may complain of his judgement at times, Zeus does take this role seriously, and he feels a deep uneasiness at the implications of these testimonies. Because the trial has evolved now from its original question of whether a crime had been committed against Poseidon or Ares. The question being considered now is: was a crime committed against Alcippe? Ugh. Leave it to Ares to bring an element of chaos with him wherever he goes. He and Eris really are two peas in the same damn pod. Zeus had hoped this occasion would prove to be an opportunity to do something to bring Ares to heel - his son could frankly use the discipline. But Zeus has to acknowledge that the person on trial is no longer Ares. He isn't sure who is on trial now - Halirrhotius, perhaps, and yet the demigod is dead. So he stands up. This discussion bears consideration, but it's become ridiculous to leave Ares in chains. The consensus is clear on this much. He doesn't even glance at Poseidon, though he will still speak to him afterwards - however judgement falls on Halirrhotius, the loss of a son is painful for anyone. -------- Pandora. That's what Athena's been thinking about for the last several minutes. Pandora, her greatest miscalculation. It had been her suggestion that Pandora be a woman. It had seemed logical to her at the time. Zeus had gathered the gods and announced that he wished to create a trial for humanity. This was due to their illicit gift of fire, which had so enraged and concerned Zeus - they received a godly gift, and yet had done nothing to earn it. Gods were afforded greater privileges and luxuries because they had greater burdens than the humans. The world literally relied on their efforts in order to exist. And mortals had the audacity to take fire from Prometheus and coast through life with no effort, while the gods worked for them? He had fought off his initial inclination to smite as many of them as he could, and the trial was decided upon. They could keep the fire, and by use of this, might eventually work their way up to a state comparative to the gods - but, to test their worth, evils would be released into the world. This was the tradeoff. Mortals could advance, but only with effort. Hephaestus had been tasked to create a human form, that would secretly enter among the other mortals and release the evils. Athena suggested it should be a woman, and beautiful at that. The combination of seeming vulnerability and bewitching beauty would teach the mortals to be cautious of judging by appearances. It still makes sense to her. It should have been a good idea. Unfortunately, the mortals interpreted Pandora to be proof that women were the source of all evil and misery in the world. They use it as justification for controlling women, and blaming them for all ills. It's infuriating in how patently incorrect and willfully malicious the interpretation is. Zeus only shakes his head sympathetically when she complains - he knows well by now, how his will can be 'interpreted' by those with an agenda. Inserting himself in mortal politics is his least favorite responsibility. But she goes from feeling infuriated to feeling sick with guilt after an argument with Poseidon. After she'd laid into him with anger about his treatment of Medusa. He'd snarled back that maybe he'd made one woman unhappy, but it wasn't Poseidon who made the entire female condition as miserable as it was. And this is true. Neither he, nor Ares, had anything to do with Pandora. In Ares' case, specifically, he refused. If Medusa - and any other woman - is held prisoner by her own female body, it's partly the fault of Athena's terrible misjudgment. Is she responsible for every rape? No - of course not - this sort of thing happened before Pandora, and it certainly wasn't her fault that men chose to interpret Pandora that way. But she didn't push as hard as she should have to undo the damage of the error. It's the way of the world now - women are property, meant to be controlled, and she had only huffed about it. What else could she do? It was the status quo now. It had never occurred to her to simply reject the logic and start punching offenders before they even got a chance to finish the deed - or to train up an entire tribe of warrior women, for that matter. It certainly never occurred to her that she could risk the scorn of all Olympus to do something like that. It occurs to Ares in seconds, apparently. The votes have been collected, now: they are all in agreement. At least, regarding the original question, of whether Ares was justified in committing the crime. He is acquitted. As to the nebulous secondary issue raised today, no one seems certain. Zeus is still stone-faced and grim. Athena knows there's certainly more than enough other problems here - Poseidon's son is dead, and now all the Olympians are forced to reckon with their own complicity in the plight of women - but she wishes Zeus could have managed to look happier that he doesn't need to throw his first-born son into Tartarus. Hera looks pleased, at least, so that's something. Zeus is going to unchain Ares, but Poseidon stands. \"Brother,\" Poseidon interjects. \"Permit me to unchain him, instead.\" Startled silence falls over the group, at this new development. Zeus looks faintly suspicious - but then waves his hand in assent. After all, Poseidon had acquitted Ares as well. ------- Poseidon approaches his chained nephew. Almost immediately after he'd angrily gone to Zeus to petition a grievance, he had regretted his haste. As usual, for him, his temper had gotten the best of him. He hadn't realized Alcippe was Ares' daughter, for one thing, and as soon as he'd found that out, it was harder to stay angry with him for interceding. But over the course of the trial, he had come to realize that Alcippe being his daughter may have made it more personal for Ares... but he might have interceded for her regardless. Certainly Hermes' testimony seems to indicate as much, when Ares had fought him on behalf of the nymph Tanagra. Poseidon keeps thinking of the argument he'd had with Athena... after Medusa left. He rests his hand now on the heavy chain wrapped around Ares' wrists. Ares is watching him warily, red eyes burning, posture defiant. Poseidon speaks softly, just for the two of them to hear: \"Tell me, nephew. If it had been me, instead of Halirrhotius. Would you have attacked me?\" \"If I'd had to die trying, yeah,\" Ares replies without hesitating. He's acknowledging that Poseidon would probably have destroyed him. Interesting, for someone said to be clouded over with the red fog of violence. Ares seems to be quite clear-eyed on a few matters. \"I see,\" is Poseidon's only reply, unchaining Ares. ---------------- The councils adjourns with little fanfare. Ares stalks off almost immediately, not even stopping to speak to any of the other gods. It's impossible to tell if he's angry about the trial, or just... angry because he's Ares. Nothing about Ares' demeanor or personality seems to be any different for having gone on trial today. Not so for everyone else. The other gods disperse as well, murmuring quietly to each other of unrelated things. They do not reconvene on the topic broached today for many, many years. But as Hestia notes to Ares later, when she invites him to her hearth for hot cocoa and sweet bread... the spark was lit today, and for a council of eternal gods, that's better than she'd ever hoped.",

      "He has a unique advantage, as well, in seeing his social ability to choose a lover go from zero to 100% once he presented himself as male, and sees the unfairness of it.",
      "It's... extremely regrettable, then, that once he was permanently identified as a male god, he sometimes abused his new privilege.",
      "Yes, he was only following the ways of the world as they had been established long before his apotheosis, but he should have known better.",
      "Yes, he was under the influence of alcohol and madness at the time, but he still should have known better.",
      "He was a woman before he was a man or a god, and he betrayed his first community.",
      "So he's glad that Ares took the first step.",
      "Ares, god of courage, who did the unpopular thing because he knew it was right, and opened the door for Dionysus to start to right wrongs.",
      "Dionysus waits until Demeter has said her piece before he stands to defend Ares as well.",
      "As he speaks, he sees the faint bewilderment on the faces of the other gods and thinks to himself that he may need to step up to his duties as the god of madness - or specifically, its opposite: mental health.",
      "There are a lot of individuals here in need of therapy.",
      "------- Zeus listens closely to the arguments for and against his son.",
      "He and Poseidon - probably all the gods present - had thought this would be a fairly straightforward trial.",
      "Both of the brothers are shocked to find that it's going unexpectedly.",
      "Demeter spoke; then Dionysus; then Hermes added a story of how Ares has felt passionately about this for years; and then Hestia (!!)",
      "chimed in to softly agree and remind everyone of how close she'd come to being a victim as well.",
      "This is troubling.",
      "He can see it on everyone's faces; they're disturbed.",
      "He is, too.",
      "Like most other gods he knows, Zeus prefers a willing lover.",
      "He enjoys seeing a positive effect on his partner; enjoys knowing that someone is taking pleasure in his attentions and his company.",
      "But there is a long, long list of names that he remembers who had run from him.",
      "And although the other gods may complain of his judgement at times, Zeus does take this role seriously, and he feels a deep uneasiness at the implications of these testimonies.",
      "Because the trial has evolved now from its original question of whether a crime had been committed against Poseidon or Ares.",
      "The question being considered now is: was a crime committed against Alcippe? Ugh.",
      "Leave it to Ares to bring an element of chaos with him wherever he goes.",
      "He and Eris really are two peas in the same damn pod.",
      "Zeus had hoped this occasion would prove to be an opportunity to do something to bring Ares to heel - his son could frankly use the discipline.",
      "But Zeus has to acknowledge that the person on trial is no longer Ares.",
      "He isn't sure who is on trial now - Halirrhotius, perhaps, and yet the demigod is dead.",
      "So he stands up.",
      "This discussion bears consideration, but it's become ridiculous to leave Ares in chains.",
      "The consensus is clear on this much.",
      "He doesn't even glance at Poseidon, though he will still speak to him afterwards - however judgement falls on Halirrhotius, the loss of a son is painful for anyone.",
      "-------- Pandora.",
      "That's what Athena's been thinking about for the last several minutes.",
      "Pandora, her greatest miscalculation.",
      "It had been her suggestion that Pandora be a woman.",
      "It had seemed logical to her at the time.",
      "Zeus had gathered the gods and announced that he wished to create a trial for humanity.",
      "This was due to their illicit gift of fire, which had so enraged and concerned Zeus - they received a godly gift, and yet had done nothing to earn it.",
      "Gods were afforded greater privileges and luxuries because they had greater burdens than the humans.",
      "The world literally relied on their efforts in order to exist.",
      "And mortals had the audacity to take fire from Prometheus and coast through life with no effort, while the gods worked for them?",
      "He had fought off his initial inclination to smite as many of them as he could, and the trial was decided upon.",
      "They could keep the fire, and by use of this, might eventually work their way up to a state comparative to the gods - but, to test their worth, evils would be released into the world.",
      "This was the tradeoff.",
      "Mortals could advance, but only with effort.",
      "Hephaestus had been tasked to create a human form, that would secretly enter among the other mortals and release the evils.",
      "Athena suggested it should be a woman, and beautiful at that.",
      "The combination of seeming vulnerability and bewitching beauty would teach the mortals to be cautious of judging by appearances.",
      "It still makes sense to her.",
      "It should have been a good idea.",
      "Unfortunately, the mortals interpreted Pandora to be proof that women were the source of all evil and misery in the world.",
      "They use it as justification for controlling women, and blaming them for all ills.",
      "It's infuriating in how patently incorrect and willfully malicious the interpretation is.",
      "Zeus only shakes his head sympathetically when she complains - he knows well by now, how his will can be 'interpreted' by those with an agenda.",
      "Inserting himself in mortal politics is his least favorite responsibility.",
      "But she goes from feeling infuriated to feeling sick with guilt after an argument with Poseidon.",
      "After she'd laid into him with anger about his treatment of Medusa.",
      "He'd snarled back that maybe he'd made one woman unhappy, but it wasn't Poseidon who made the entire female condition as miserable as it was.",
      "And this is true.",
      "Neither he, nor Ares, had anything to do with Pandora.",
      "In Ares' case, specifically, he refused.",
      "If Medusa - and any other woman - is held prisoner by her own female body, it's partly the fault of Athena's terrible misjudgment.",
      "Is she responsible for every rape?",
      "No - of course not - this sort of thing happened before Pandora, and it certainly wasn't her fault that men chose to interpret Pandora that way.",
      "But she didn't push as hard as she should have to undo the damage of the error.",
      "It's the way of the world now - women are property, meant to be controlled, and she had only huffed about it.",
      "What else could she do?",
      "It was the status quo now.",
      "It had never occurred to her to simply reject the logic and start punching offenders before they even got a chance to finish the deed - or to train up an entire tribe of warrior women, for that matter.",
      "It certainly never occurred to her that she could risk the scorn of all Olympus to do something like that.",
      "It occurs to Ares in seconds, apparently.",
      "The votes have been collected, now: they are all in agreement.",
      "At least, regarding the original question, of whether Ares was justified in committing the crime.",
      "He is acquitted.",
      "As to the nebulous secondary issue raised today, no one seems certain.",
      "Zeus is still stone-faced and grim.",
      "Athena knows there's certainly more than enough other problems here - Poseidon's son is dead, and now all the Olympians are forced to reckon with their own complicity in the plight of women - but she wishes Zeus could have managed to look happier that he doesn't need to throw his first-born son into Tartarus.",
      "Hera looks pleased, at least, so that's something.",
      "Zeus is going to unchain Ares, but Poseidon stands.",
      "\"Brother,\" Poseidon interjects.",
      "\"Permit me to unchain him, instead.\"",
      "Startled silence falls over the group, at this new development.",
      "Zeus looks faintly suspicious - but then waves his hand in assent.",
      "After all, Poseidon had acquitted Ares as well.",
      "------- Poseidon approaches his chained nephew.",
      "Almost immediately after he'd angrily gone to Zeus to petition a grievance, he had regretted his haste.",
      "As usual, for him, his temper had gotten the best of him.",
      "He hadn't realized Alcippe was Ares' daughter, for one thing, and as soon as he'd found that out, it was harder to stay angry with him for interceding.",
      "But over the course of the trial, he had come to realize that Alcippe being his daughter may have made it more personal for Ares...",
      "but he might have interceded for her regardless.",
      "Certainly Hermes' testimony seems to indicate as much, when Ares had fought him on behalf of the nymph Tanagra.",
      "Poseidon keeps thinking of the argument he'd had with Athena... after Medusa left.",
      "He rests his hand now on the heavy chain wrapped around Ares' wrists.",
      "Ares is watching him warily, red eyes burning, posture defiant.",
      "Poseidon speaks softly, just for the two of them to hear: \"Tell me, nephew.",
      "If it had been me, instead of Halirrhotius.",
      "Would you have attacked me?\"",
      "\"If I'd had to die trying, yeah,\" Ares replies without hesitating.",
      "He's acknowledging that Poseidon would probably have destroyed him.",
      "Interesting, for someone said to be clouded over with the red fog of violence.",
      "Ares seems to be quite clear-eyed on a few matters.",
      "\"I see,\" is Poseidon's only reply, unchaining Ares.",
      "---------------- The councils adjourns with little fanfare.",
      "Ares stalks off almost immediately, not even stopping to speak to any of the other gods.",
      "It's impossible to tell if he's angry about the trial, or just... angry because he's Ares.",
      "Nothing about Ares' demeanor or personality seems to be any different for having gone on trial today.",
      "Not so for everyone else.",
      "The other gods disperse as well, murmuring quietly to each other of unrelated things.",
      "They do not reconvene on the topic broached today for many, many years.",
      "But as Hestia notes to Ares later, when she invites him to her hearth for hot cocoa and sweet bread...",
      "the spark was lit today, and for a council of eternal gods, that's better than she'd ever hoped."

    "text": "\"Why don't we do it in the road?\" Paul McCartney's voice warbles out of the speaker, while the guitar jangles and Ringo's handclaps keep the time. Eros is familiar with the backstory: McCartney had seen two monkeys copulate in a street in Rishikesh, in India, and mused at how simple and normal the act had been. There was no drama, no emotional turmoil, just a quick in-and-out. Neither monkey seemed bothered. Just do it in the road. That had been Eros' personal manifesto for many centuries. Well, after all, what else could it be? He's the god of sex - love belongs to Aphrodite. The two are closely linked, but they are distinct, and Eros was intended to be solely in charge of sex: those lusty urges. Nothing more. Of course, he's changed. They've all come a pretty long way from who they used to be. But he still sometimes feels a twinge of nostalgia, and wishes again that sex could be so simple. Just do it! Sex should be uncomplicated and fun (and funny), the way it was meant to be. It had been Eros' stubborn insistence on maintaining that credo, that most of the Erotes even came to exist in the first place. ----------------- In the early days of Eros' existence, there's some cooing over Poseidon and his new lover, Nerites. The two of them adore each other - rare, among the lovers of the gods. Typically the interest is either one-sided or ephemeral; rarely mutual and lasting. Nerites has the patience for Poseidon's moodiness and for his part, Poseidon finds himself cheered and calmed by his lover's presence. They're inseparable and can more or less constantly be found racing each other across the waves on Poseidon's bizarre hippocampus-drawn chariots. Nerites had earned the spite of Helios one day, by racing east-to-west across the sea and making it slightly ahead of the sun Titan. In annoyance, Helios had turned the young man into some kind of sea snail (\"See how fast you go now, brat!\"). Ordinarily, it's considered Very Bad Manners among the gods to undo one another's curses, even if one favors the unfortunate mortal. It's understood that one can help their favored cursed mortal in succeeding in spite of another god's handicap (Athena and Zeus are particularly dedicated in this), but the curse remains. It takes a substantial amount of willpower and focus and intent for a god to undo a curse. For Nerites, Poseidon does it. It visibly exhausts him; he may be the Lord of the Sea, but Helios is an ancient Titan and the curse is formidable. Nonetheless, his determination to bring Nerites back is successful, and the handsome young man is restored. Nerites' love for Poseidon increases immensely when he sees what the god has done for him, and they're back to smooching and falling into bed with each other, as before. (Luckily for all, Helios, incapable of holding a grudge for any length of time, has already forgotten that he ever cursed the kid in the first place, and does not follow up on his original ire. Nerites humbly keeps his racing to a minimum anyway) Eros watches the entire story play out with a detached curiosity, and when it appears that the status quo has been restored with no further drama, he loses interest completely. Aphrodite thinks it's sweet. \"Look at them,\" she says, as she reclines on the sand of a beach. Eros is playing in the surf, and glances up to see Poseidon and Nerites in the distance, fooling around as usual. \"Isn't that nice? They care so much for each other. It's so unusual for Poseidon.\" Poseidon has a poor track record for finding lovers that share his enthusiasm. Not Eros' business either way, and he says as much. \"They do fuck a lot, though, so that's something!\" Aphrodite sighs. \"Yes, but I mean... it's nicer when the feeling's mutual, don't you think?\" \"It feels nice however way.\" \"Right, perhaps, but when there's reciprocation, it's so much more powerful!\" Eros shrugs, attempting to catch a fish. All he gets is a handful of foam. \"Yeah, I guess.\" She presses her point. \"Because if both of you want the same thing -\" \"...You get your own physical satisfaction, as well as the delight of knowing you've helped give pleasure to someone you care for. Yes, I agree!\" Aphrodite and Eros both look startled as a voice comes from the foam in Eros' hands. The foam coalesces and begins to form the shape of a young man with a half-shave haircut, tied into a wolf's tail on top. \"I think you're right. There's definitely a difference between sex for the sake of it, and sex between two who truly love each other.\" Aphrodite is far cleverer than most of the Olympians would give her credit for (plus, she has the advantage of being one of only five creatures in existence who know the true origins of herself and her son: the other four being Eros and the Fates). She swiftly determines what has happened and gives Eros an unimpressed look. \"You created a new god specifically so you could avoid having to deal with nuance in your job?\" Eros watches in fascination as the young man begins to solidify and take on handsome features. It hadn't been a mindful intent, but, well... when you're the god of procreation, sometimes this shit happens, apparently. \"Yeah! Great idea, right? Now I can go back to just setting people off fucking again. No need to bother me with romantic crap.\" He gives the new god a critical onceover. \"We'll call you Anteros. Love returned. Your job is to handle the delicate stuff, mutual feelings and so on. You can coordinate with me when it's time to actually do the do.\" Anteros, thirty seconds old, smiles, unbothered by his surprising appearance into the world. \"Sure thing! I'll give it my all! It deserves no less-\" Eros cuts off this monologue by making a rude noise with his tongue and dragging his new companion off to play. --- Hymenaios is the next Erote to be born. Eros generally takes the form of a young man - his apparent age has crept up over the centuries, as the ages of adolescence and adulthood have been pushed further and further back for most of humanity, but he's found that a young man, who's just discovering the joys his dick can bring, best represents his personal creed. As such, when it comes time to coordinate with Queen Hera to bring about marital bliss, Eros cannot overstate how uninterested he is. For her part, Queen Hera seems to be equally put off by the idea of coordinating her domain with the rowdy, mischievous god of rampant horniness. She particularly dislikes Eros, suspecting him of being the instigator of her husband's infidelities - which, for some of them, he is. It's hilarious. Grandpa Zeus does some of the weirdest shit to try to hook up with these mortals - turning into a bull? A swan?Golden rain?? But even Eros can't keep up with all of his shenanigans; he estimates his arrows are responsible for maybe half of them. Anyway, regarding 'marital bliss,' it's not as though Eros particularly minds shooting his arrows at the wedded couples, but he can't be bothered to care about them particularly. He tends to go with the most amusing or fun scenario; and couples aren't always the most amusing or fun. Aphrodite doesn't care much for the institution of marriage, thinking of it as a political or economic union that stands in her way as the goddess of love, so her petitions to Eros to take it more seriously are half-hearted and Eros thinks he might be able to avoid this duty altogether. Unfortunately for him, Queen Hera is a pro at needling irresponsible gods. \"Listen, you bratty little shit, this is important. People can't be stuck in loveless marriages forever!\" Eros raises a finger. \"Aha! But there, you see, Grandma Hera - \" \"And stop calling me that! I'm your queen.\" \"...Queen Grandma Hera - you said it yourself. 'Loveless marriages.' Love! Not sex. Go ask Mom.\" \"Your mother is already doing her part. But bringing together love and marriage and turning it into a successful night in bed is more complicated, and we need your cooperation!\" Eros groans at this pronouncement. \"Ugh, Queen Grandma Hera! You're just gonna turn this into some prude thing!\" Hera bristles visibly and is clearly about to turn this into a shouting match, when she's interrupted by a voice from off to the side, by a nearby fountain. \"Well, perhaps a 'prude' thing is the wrong word for it. It's more that marriage has unique requirements for sex. It's a form of commitment - these people are swearing to stay together for the rest of their lives. It's a lot! There's a lot of pressure, and they have to try to make it work through thick and thin. I can see there being a different category of sex for people trying to form a family. Trying to keep the spark alive even when so much is at stake surely needs more dedicated work.\" It's easier this time, because he's already done it once. Another young man, with dark skin and handsome features and tight curls of hair atop his head, approaches them. Hera blinks in surprise. \"... And you are...?\" she asks too startled to even be offended that some random person just interrupted her. \"Queen Grandma Hera, this is - Hymenaios. The 'bridal hymn.' The god of marital bliss. I think you'll find he has all the answers you need,\" Eros says, and beats a path out of there before she can catch him again. He leaves Hymenaios the unenviable task of being a bridge between Eros and Hera. 'Marital bliss' - honestly! You're either doing it, or you're not! What's so damn complicated about it?! --------- Anteros is optimistic and enthusiastic. Hymenaios is unflappably calm - a necessity of being able to coordinate between two polar opposite entities. Pothos, the third Erote, is far and away the most dramatically emotional of the Love Gods thus far. He probably would get on Eros' nerves more if he weren't so endearingly earnest. As the Erote of longing, perhaps it's baked into his job description to be dramatic. He arises shortly after the Big Seasonal Arrangement is organized, between Demeter, Persephone, and Hades. Hymenaios and Anteros had been deeply involved during that first long winter. Had it occurred to Demeter to ask him, Eros could have told her where her daughter was. While Demeter despaired and wept, and the world turned cold and dying as a result, Mutual Affection and Marital Bliss had begun their stupid, complicated efforts to turn a reclusive god's loneliness and a young goddess' uncertain curiosity into a real thing. Eros was forbidden from coming anywhere near the situation, which was fine with him. Whatever fragile and new relationship was forming between Persephone and Hades, it certainly was not sexual hijinks, and any pure smoldering sex was buried in drama, so Eros didn't see a need to involve himself. After summer comes again, Persephone joins Aphrodite on a walk one day, while Eros fools around nearby. Persephone is sighing. \"It's not that I'm unhappy with the arrangement. I did miss Mother. But now... I miss him, too.\" \"Yes,\" says Aphrodite, who is currently in the midst of her turbulent marriage to Hephaestus and missing Ares. \"There's a certain poignancy to being apart from him, I'm sure.\" \"There really is! It makes me want him even more-\" Eros, overhearing, decides to cut them off at the pass. He closes his eyes briefly and then there's Pothos, appearing out of nowhere with his man-bun and scruffy beard and soulful eyes, commiserating with the two women and agreeing that longing for a partner makes the desire even stronger. ---------- Hedylogos, the fourth Erote, doesn't add dramatic feelings to the mix so much as he adds strategy and cunning. \"That's a cynical way to put it,\" the god of sweet talk objects, but, well, Eros is not subtle with his speech. Thus the need for Hedylogos to exist. Hedy comes about when the youngest Olympian, Dionysus, decides to aim for the stars - almost literally, by determining to woo the primordial goddess Nyx. Nyx, one of the most ancient beings in existence, is not easily impressed. She has seen beautiful forms beyond counting - male and female, god and titan and mortal. There is no question that if she does not care to be courted by the upstart god, then the courting will not happen, mainly because she would probably crush Dionysus out of existence. \"That's why I really gotta make a good case for myself to her, you know? Really catch her interest!\" Dionysus explains to a flummoxed Zeus. He'd been hoping that Zeus, being the most powerful Olympian, would have some insight as to how to woo such a being. But of course Zeus, like nearly every other god with good sense, is terrified of Nyx and feels the best course of action is to steer clear. Dionysus thinks that a woman powerful enough to end him, has got to be pretty exciting in bed. Eros admires Dionysus' gumption and ambition, but still doesn't think he's personally got the subtlety that Dionysus needs. So he creates Hedylogos, a young man of crystal blue eyes and sparkling personality, to help Dionysus come up with fun and sexy things to say to get Nyx's attention; how to be charming; and (very crucial to the god's survival) how to interpret her responses and body language to press forward or back swiftly off as needed. Eros hopes Dio survives. Actually, he thinks Nyx will like him. She's still technically Eros' sister, after all, and he thinks he knows her tastes. ---------- No one really knows where the Erotes come from, the way that no one quite knows how Aphrodite was born or whose son Eros really is. (The answer: no one's son but Chaos - though he and all the other Erotes consistently call Ares 'Daddy,' if for no other reason than to unsettle everyone) For the most part, everyone assumes that Aphrodite gave birth to them all, which is sort of true in a way, and none of them correct this easy assumption. Hermaphroditus is the first major deviation to the squad, though they don't realize it, by way of not being split off of Eros himself. It's Dionysus who brings Hermaphroditus over to meet Eros - Eros' attention is immediately caught by the unusual circumstance of this person. Dionysus was raised as a girl, and was born from a male, and is fairly loose and free with gender roles according to his inclination of the moment, though he trends towards male. As such, he's been assigned a minor domain of intersex and transgender people. This role doesn't get him much attention, and Eros doubts there are any formal ceremonies dedicated to it, but Dionysus takes it seriously. He's spent the last few months walking with Hermaphroditus, as they accustom themselves to their new life. Hermaphroditus is the result of another very unusual act of creation - a young man, the son of Hermes and Aphrodite, who met a nymph named Salmacis. After a long, long discussion, of being a man, versus being a woman, and finding a connection in each other in feeling not quite at ease in their own bodies and the roles assigned to them, they attempted to make love - and two became one in more than the metaphorical sense. To their surprise, and Eros' delight, the union of their minds took a physical form and fused the two of them together, leaving them in a body that is neither male nor female, but both. The change was wholly unexpected and confusing, and left Hermaphroditus (the name they decided to keep) stressed and isolated. To make matters worse, the rumors have begun to spread about the spring of Salmacis cursing men to perversion and effeminacy. Hermaphroditus, who has been very quiet during this explanation from Dionysus, speaks up, still in a soft voice. \"I still... don't know how to feel about it, but... we did have something, and it -Dionysus thinks that maybe it would help - I want to be able to help anyone else, who's going through the same thing...\" \"Yeah, sure!\" Eros says, waving his hand easily. Hermaphroditus and Dionysus both blink at him in surprise. \"R-really...?\" Hermaphroditus asks, uncertainly. \"I don't know how much worship you'll get, but yeah, I can see this being a situation that would call for more than a generic arrow.\" Eros is completely excited and curious about this new form of creation - as the god of procreation, this is something rare, and outside the normal scope of his experience. Hermaphroditus' first effort comes sooner than expected. Iphis, in a reversal from Dionysus, is a mortal woman raised as a man, and fell in love with a woman named Ianthe. The feelings were returned, which might have simply been Anteros' department, but the obstacle of Iphis' gender made it complicated. \"Hermaphroditus can help,\" Eros suggests, hoping to see another fusion. Hermaphroditus does help, though it's not quite as exciting as creating a new life-form: they have a long discussion with both Iphis and Ianthe, asking what it is they really want from this relationship. For her part, although Ianthe is startled to realize that her male romantic interest is biologically female, she nonetheless fell in love with a charming person named Iphis and is content to accept that person in any form. Iphis himself determines that for better or worse, having been raised as a man for so long, that's how he sees himself. The choice seems clear, if unorthodox. Hermaphroditus petitions Aphrodite, the only love deity with enough power to transform another, to make Iphis a man in truth. Aphrodite agrees, and to everyone's surprise, Queen Hera is enthusiastic enough to preside over the marriage. \"They want to enter a marriage, of course I support that! They're making the commitment to start a family together, rather than just flirting around and wasting time indefinitely,\" Hera explains, when asked. Eros and Aphrodite still roll their eyes that Hera thinks any love or sex is wasted unless it's for a purpose, but Eros finds himself pleasantly surprised that she's on board with helping these two find happiness. Maybe she's not quite the prude he thought. It isn't until he's standing around at the wedding with Hera, Aphrodite and Hymenaios, who are all pleased about the happy ending, that Eros realizes. He remembers that he, Eros, personally said with his own mouth, that this was a situation that was complicated, and welcomed a new role to the concept of having sex, and that he predicted it correctly. That was the beginning of the end. --------------- His old friend Dionysus, great seductor of Nyx, is getting hitched. All seems to be in order; Anteros is involved, and so is Hymenaios. Everyone's in good standing. Then Eros meets the lucky bride, and makes a startled observation: \"Oh, it's you! Ariadne! Weren't you with Theseus?\" This tactless question is also mostly pointless - Eros already knows she was lovers with Theseus. He shot the two of them himself. Everything seemed to be going swimmingly then - mutual attraction, hot sex, defeating monsters and sailing off into the sunset. Or sailing off to the north, anyway, from Crete to Athens. But anyway, wasn't she boning Theseus? It's just as he's belatedly realizing that clearly she isn't anymore, and he probably shouldn't ask, but Dionysus is familiar with Eros' ways by now, and answers when Ariadne twists her fingers awkwardly. \"Theseus ended up being as smart as he is honorable - which is to say, not at fucking all. He abandoned the loveliest, cleverest mortal on earth - just left her on the deserted island of Naxos! Poor Ariadne put up with a lot of shit, but ultimately it turned out great that he's a stupid asshole, right?\" Ariadne smiles up at him. \"Yes. It was worth everything to have you find me.\" Eros is feeling a little unmoored. Theseus and Ariadne had been nuts for each other. He'd seen it. It had been a very successful shot. The attraction had been there, it had been real. But it had stopped? He's never given any thought, before, to what happens after he fires his arrows. People get hot for each other, it either gets sexy or funny or both, Eros wanders away. He never sees long-term fallout... never sees people lose interest in each other. It's very... distressing to him, suddenly, to think that people can share a passion like Theseus and Ariadne did, and enjoy each other's company so much, only for it to fade. And fade to the point where one partner abandoned the other to die on a deserted island, alone. Is that the lasting effect of Eros' work? A moment of fun, to be replaced with pain and resentment? At the moment, Dionysus and Ariadne are looking at him quizzically. \"I'm... sorry you had to go through that,\" Eros says. Dionysus is shocked into silence at his words: this is the first time, in his existence, that Eros has apologized for anything. Ariadne doesn't realize the momentous occasion for what it is, and smiles. \"Yes, well... I haven't thought much of him at all since Dio found me. Theseus' foolish choice turned out to be my good fortune, yes?\" \"Yeah... yeah, I guess you got lucky...\" \"Very lucky,\" Dionysus says, taking her hand. \"I didn't think anyone could measure up to Nyx, but babe, you - \". \"Ah-ah. No comparing me to any goddesses, please. I'm just happy to hear you love me,\" says Ariadne, who is definitely cleverer than most. They're very warm towards each other. They clearly have the hots for each other and it's all smiles and soft murmurs and holding hands. But... Theseus felt the same way at one point. Didn't he? After this conversation, Eros can never fire his arrows in quite such a happy-go-lucky fashion again. He finds himself wondering all the time now, what happens to the people afterwards. ----------- Zephyrus is not an Erote. He is one of the Anemoi - the four wind gods. He is the west wind; the gentlest wind; the wind of springtime and flowers and fruit. And Zephyrus is a killer. Zephyrus would be dead, were it not for Eros' intervention. Apollo would have murdered him, more brutally than Hyacinthus was murdered. Eros suspects - and Zephyrus is certain - that Apollo would have had him flayed alive for the wind's role in Hyacinthus' death; and perhaps spared only to be thrown into Tartarus, if Zeus permitted it. Eros intervenes. Looking back, he's not quite sure why he did it. It was just a hunch, that there was something more to it. He had known that Zephyrus had in some way been motivated out of love. But Eros normally doesn't take responsibility for any acts carried out in his name... unless those acts are funny, of course. This act wasn't funny. Hyacinthus was beloved by all who saw him, but none more than Apollo. Eros knows this, because he personally sent an arrow Apollo's way, to spur him on. And watching the vain, proud, dignified Apollo throw himself at the mortal prince was a delight to watch, right up until the jealous west wind sent a discus astray and killed the boy. Zephyrus is Eros' servant, now, though Eros doesn't make much use of him. Eros doesn't need to be carried by the wind; he carries himself on his own wings. And frankly, for a pretty long time afterwards, Zephyrus is depressing to be around. He's crippled with guilt and grief; and unlike Apollo, who mourns for the same reason, Zephyrus does not have a circle of family and friends to support him. He only has Eros. Eros is an excellent friend to have for standing up to a furious Apollo, and refusing to back down and hand the wind god over for punishment. It's tense in the hall. The Erotes are huddled off to the side, grouped around Zephyrus, who stares at the ground without reacting. Apollo is nearly apoplectic with fury. Eros has never looked so grim in his existence. In spite of his lack of a position in the Council of Twelve, the gods all are familiar with Eros' power, and know the damage he can do when he's in a good mood. They don't want to see what he can do when angered, and they coax Apollo to back down. Tears of rage and sorrow stream down his face, but Apollo finally turns away from revenge on Zephyrus. So Eros did some good there. But what Zephyrus really needs, badly, is someone to talk about his damn Feelings, and Eros is no use for that. Not that he doesn't try. He makes an effort to talk to Zephyrus about it shortly after the incident, in fact: \"Hey, Z., why'd you kill that kid, anyway? If you liked him so much?\" His attempt to be casual might have been a little too on the mark, but Zephyrus only flinches and stares off at the clouds. \"Anagapesis,\" the wind god says at last, in a hoarse voice. \"Uh...?\" Zephyrus spreads his hands; an empty gesture. \"He loved me, once. He loved me first. He and I - \" He sniffles, and Eros realizes to his horror that the wind god is crying. \"It just, stopped. He saw Apollo and everything else fell away. I fell away. It was over, just like that. I didn't exist, we didn't exist, anymore. I couldn't understand it. He tried to be kind about it, I guess, but I couldn't - he only had eyes for Apollo. I couldn't bear it. Anagapesis. He fell out of love.\" \"Oh... uh...\" \"I still loved him. I still do. I never meant - I thought... the discus would fly off to the side. Apollo would look stupid. It would ruin their fun. It was so petty, so stupid, and now he's dead.\" Eros is absolutely unequipped to deal with this, but even he knows he can't just fuck off out of this situation, no matter how desperately he wants to. \"Hey... look, Zephyrus, we all live a long time. You'll find someone new. You'll get past this.\" Zephyrus doesn't look like he feels any better. His shoulders slump further, wings dragging on the ground. \"Yes, I suppose you're right. Eventually. Hyacinthus will be just a moment lost in time.\" Eros blessedly catches sight of Aphrodite and flags her down desperately. She'll know how to talk about this, probably. Better than Eros can, anyway. Eros knows he was right. Gods live an awful long time, and this unpleasantness around Hyacinthus' death will wear off. And isn't that what he's all about? Sex being fun and uncomplicated and existing for its own sake? -------------- \"Anagapesis,\" he thinks to himself, as he visits Psyche again. It's dark, again, and she calls him \"lover,\" as she doesn't know his name. She never must. He's never loved anyone before. He's never experienced, personally, any of the things that the other Erotes talk about. He's always just let his dick lead the way. But now, it's as though all of the Erotes have returned to him, and are driving his actions. He loves her, and he feels a crushing relief that she seems to care for him in return (Anteros). Unable to show her his physical attractiveness, he uses sweet speech to compliment her, to turn her on, to tell her he cares for her (Hedylogos). When he's gone from his secret palace, as he is every day, he thinks of her constantly: the feel of her skin, the whispered sound of her voice, the taste of her on his tongue, and longs for her (Pothos). He even has been thinking of staying with her indefinitely, of always caring for her, of having a family with her (Hymenaios). (Hermaphroditus' domain is a little more niche than applies here, but even so, Eros can more easily imagine the indignation Iphis and Ianthe must have felt, at finding the love of their life and being forbidden from being together. It had been speculative on his part before, but how he gets it) But, he keeps thinking of Ariadne, abandoned on the shore of Naxos. He thinks of Zephyrus, left bewildered and hurt enough to do something terrible, which haunts him forever. He thinks, with a gnawing guilt, of all the times Zeus has set off to betray his wife. He thinks of Hephaestus' misery after Aphrodite and Ares had been found together. Anagapesis. His arrows are only fleeting. He doesn't let her know who he is. She can't really fall out of love with him, if she doesn't even know who her lover is in the first place, he reasons. If she sees him, she'll know instantly, so he only visits at night, and forbids a lamp to be lit. ------- Afterwards - after the lamp was lit; after Aphrodite descended on the princess with her full wrath; after the punishments, the humiliating tasks - after they reconcile, after they marry, after they are lying together in bed with a lamp burning dimly nearby, he confesses to her. \"My arrows are fleeting,\" he whispers, almost unable to force the words out. \"They sting, and men and women fall to lust, and then it wears off. I feared your interest would wane, and I wouldn't be able to bear it.\" She kisses him: his temple, the soft skin of his eyelid, the corner of his mouth. \"Sometimes they do, Eros.\" She hasn't tired yet of saying his name. \"But, silly boy, people know that. If you want to make something last longer, you have to choose to keep at it.\" He wants to just accept this, but he still remembers: \"But sometimes, people choose otherwise. Sometimes they leave, and sometimes they have a broken heart.\" \"Sometimes they do,\" she concedes. \"That's how it is. I chose to keep trying.\" She kisses him again. \"Come, Eros, let me prove it to you.\" ----------- It is shortly after their child, Hedone, is born, that the final Erote makes his appearance. Himeros is youthful and suave and is chasing after Herakles - he of the reputation for being a prolific lover, kind and attentive but rushing in after anyone who catches his eye, and has male and female lovers all over Greece and beyond. Himeros is naughty jokes and winks; he's happy romps in the fields between wild and careless young lovers. He falls in love easily; but moves on quickly. He requires nearly as much babysitting as Pothos: while Pothos' longing has to be monitored to avoid turning to obsession, Himeros has to be monitored to ensure he doesn't go Full Fuckboi, as Hedylogos calls it. Himeros is impetuous love Eros is stunned to see Himeros, when he appears. Himeros is, essentially, everything Eros used to be. And now he's just another way of expressing desire. Just another part of him. \"You've grown up, my sweet,\" Aphrodite says when he hesitantly comments on it as they relax together in a spa. \"When you were young, sex was carefree and uncomplicated. Now you see how much more there is to what you can do.\" \"All the other Erotes figured it out before me.\" She lightly slaps his arm. \"All the other Erotes are you, you goose - well, except for Hermaphroditus. But otherwise, if they seem to know more than you, it's only because you knew it and didn't want to deal with it at the time.\" \"....So what am I, now?\" This has been weighing on his mind for a while. Himeros is the clear role of who Eros used to be, and he isn't sure what that means for him now. \"You're who you always were, Eros, my dear. The force that drives them all. You're the basis of all of them, and coordinate as appropriate.\" \"...The squad leader,\" he suggests, warming up to the idea. \"Right!\" she smiles at him and sips the wine she has nearby. \"You should come up with a squad theme.\" A moment of silence, then Eros asks: \"So... Himeros is a lot like younger me, right?\" \"There's a resemblance, to be sure,\" she observes dryly. \"Was I really always that annoying?\" \"Yes,\" Aphrodite says, firmly, then kisses his cheek to take the sting out of her words. \"But endearingly so, my darling. You were very innocent, as Himeros is now.\" --------- Of course, Eros doesn't have favorites, and if he did, it would be Psyche for sure. But Ganymede is the cutest, funniest little guy, and Eros adores having him around. He thinks of the kid as his little brother, and takes him under his wing. The idea of him joining the Erotes turns out to be a bust - a long, sad story, and one that Eros luckily has more experience to deal with now. But Erote or not, Ganymede and Eros are thick as thieves, and spend a great deal of time horsing around together and raising hell on Olympus. Gany is Eros' strongest ally in the prank war against Hermes, and it's Gany who recruits Zephyrus into the battles as well. Ganymede and Zephyrus have a great dealt to talk about, together, regarding romantic aspiration and loss. In spite of his closeness with the cupbearer, it's nearly three centuries after he's brought up to Olympus, that Gany finally confesses something to Eros regarding those discussions: \"I used to really worry about it. Like maybe I was just the first thing Zeus saw that day... or maybe even that Zeus was the first person Isaw. I mean, obviously I was wrong, but it's just... you had a reputation, you know? And so did he. So I worried all the time that it was gonna wear off and I'd be this awful hanger-on, forgotten but still having to stay here.\" His reputation. Yeah, Eros had been a real terror back in the day, hadn't he? He smiles at Gany, tweaking his nose. \"Nahhh, it was real affection all along. Guess you know that now, though.\" They're lying around lazily, draped over a hammock that overlooks the cloudscape. Eros continues. \"No one, not even the Erotes, can keep the feeling lasting forever. All we do is our best to coordinate and help out.\" Gany turns a small but brilliant smile on him. \"It's real nice of you. So, no arrows for me and Zeus?\" \"Well, I didn't say that.\" There's a pause. Eros hides a smile. \"I mean, you can't expect a leopard to change his spots completely, right? I wouldn't be Eros if I wasn't raising a little hell!\" \"So... the arrows....\" Ganymede sounds highly suspicious. \"Nothing major. Just gave you a couple of fun little kinks. Ones I knew Zeus would appreciate.\" Gany's face goes red. \"Y-you... you know about those?!\" Eros laughs, delighted at his friend's embarrassment. \"Well, yeah! I'm the reason anyone has kinks at all! It's just a harmless way to keep sex amusing. That's what my arrows are good for anymore, the rest is all business.\" Gany hides his burning face in his hands. \"Oh my god, Eros, I'm gonna die.\" Eros scoffs, poking Ganymede. \"Oh, come on, there's nothing weird about it! Lots of people have a kink for being - \" Ganymede attempts to shove Eros off the hammock. \"Ughh!! Stop talking about it all nonchalantly! It's so embarrassing!\" \"It's not, it's super cute!\" \"Stop calling my kinks cute - stop talking about them at all!\" They're wrestling around on the hammock now, in danger of both being turned over. \"It's my job! It's business! It's no more embarrassing than collaborative subsidies and entrepreneurial markets and stuff.\" \"You don't even know what those words mean! You only know sex words,\" Gany accuses, laughing. \"... Occupational percentage bondage quotas...\" This sets Ganymede off again, and they do end up dumped on the ground, and for a long time afterwards, Gany can't be in the same room as Eros and any length of cord without going red again. --------------------- In the present day, Ganymede is dozed off in the passenger seat of the VW van that Eros is using as his chariot today - he likes the aesthetic, and it also is the rare vehicle that fits all the Erotes comfortably inside. They're cruising around, waiting for the moment when that kid Icarus gets off shift - Icarus, Gany's intended champion of romantic aspiration, who has been reincarnated and caught the attention of the sun idiots. Zephyrus, for the moment, has politely declined to attend as the Erotes jump Icarus for a birthday surprise. The wind god isn't sure he ought to be involved with another of Apollo's romantic interests. So it's the seven Erotes, plus Ganymede, crammed into a VW van painted in gauche heart designs. In accordance with this spirit of the sixties, they're listening to the Beatles' White Album, and \"Why Don't We Do It in the Road\" comes on. \"Wow, they really got Himeros down pat, didn't they?\" Hermaphroditus snickers, elbowing the youngest Erote and laughing. Eros smiles, letting the others tease Himeros, and allows the faint twinge of nostalgia to come and go. Uncomplicated sex has its place. But even if it's taken him a long road to realize it, Eros knows now that there's a lot more.",

      "I can see there being a different category of sex for people trying to form a family.",
      "Trying to keep the spark alive even when so much is at stake surely needs more dedicated work.\"",
      "It's easier this time, because he's already done it once.",
      "Another young man, with dark skin and handsome features and tight curls of hair atop his head, approaches them.",
      "Hera blinks in surprise.",
      "\"...",
      "And you are...?\" she asks too startled to even be offended that some random person just interrupted her.",
      "\"Queen Grandma Hera, this is - Hymenaios.",
      "The 'bridal hymn.'",
      "The god of marital bliss.",
      "I think you'll find he has all the answers you need,\" Eros says, and beats a path out of there before she can catch him again.",
      "He leaves Hymenaios the unenviable task of being a bridge between Eros and Hera. 'Marital bliss' - honestly!",
      "You're either doing it, or you're not!",
      "What's so damn complicated about it?!",
      "--------- Anteros is optimistic and enthusiastic.",
      "Hymenaios is unflappably calm - a necessity of being able to coordinate between two polar opposite entities.",
      "Pothos, the third Erote, is far and away the most dramatically emotional of the Love Gods thus far.",
      "He probably would get on Eros' nerves more if he weren't so endearingly earnest.",
      "As the Erote of longing, perhaps it's baked into his job description to be dramatic.",
      "He arises shortly after the Big Seasonal Arrangement is organized, between Demeter, Persephone, and Hades.",
      "Hymenaios and Anteros had been deeply involved during that first long winter.",
      "Had it occurred to Demeter to ask him, Eros could have told her where her daughter was.",
      "While Demeter despaired and wept, and the world turned cold and dying as a result, Mutual Affection and Marital Bliss had begun their stupid, complicated efforts to turn a reclusive god's loneliness and a young goddess' uncertain curiosity into a real thing.",
      "Eros was forbidden from coming anywhere near the situation, which was fine with him.",
      "Whatever fragile and new relationship was forming between Persephone and Hades, it certainly was not sexual hijinks, and any pure smoldering sex was buried in drama, so Eros didn't see a need to involve himself.",
      "After summer comes again, Persephone joins Aphrodite on a walk one day, while Eros fools around nearby.",
      "Persephone is sighing.",
      "\"It's not that I'm unhappy with the arrangement.",
      "I did miss Mother.",
      "But now...",
      "I miss him, too.\"",
      "\"Yes,\" says Aphrodite, who is currently in the midst of her turbulent marriage to Hephaestus and missing Ares.",
      "\"There's a certain poignancy to being apart from him, I'm sure.\"",
      "\"There really is!",
      "It makes me want him even more-\" Eros, overhearing, decides to cut them off at the pass.",
      "He closes his eyes briefly and then there's Pothos, appearing out of nowhere with his man-bun and scruffy beard and soulful eyes, commiserating with the two women and agreeing that longing for a partner makes the desire even stronger.",
      "---------- Hedylogos, the fourth Erote, doesn't add dramatic feelings to the mix so much as he adds strategy and cunning.",
      "\"That's a cynical way to put it,\" the god of sweet talk objects, but, well, Eros is not subtle with his speech.",
      "Thus the need for Hedylogos to exist.",
      "Hedy comes about when the youngest Olympian, Dionysus, decides to aim for the stars - almost literally, by determining to woo the primordial goddess Nyx.",
      "Nyx, one of the most ancient beings in existence, is not easily impressed.",
      "She has seen beautiful forms beyond counting - male and female, god and titan and mortal.",
      "There is no question that if she does not care to be courted by the upstart god, then the courting will not happen, mainly because she would probably crush Dionysus out of existence.",
      "\"That's why I really gotta make a good case for myself to her, you know?",
      "Really catch her interest!\"",
      "Dionysus explains to a flummoxed Zeus.",
      "He'd been hoping that Zeus, being the most powerful Olympian, would have some insight as to how to woo such a being.",
      "But of course Zeus, like nearly every other god with good sense, is terrified of Nyx and feels the best course of action is to steer clear.",
      "Dionysus thinks that a woman powerful enough to end him, has got to be pretty exciting in bed.",
      "Eros admires Dionysus' gumption and ambition, but still doesn't think he's personally got the subtlety that Dionysus needs.",
      "So he creates Hedylogos, a young man of crystal blue eyes and sparkling personality, to help Dionysus come up with fun and sexy things to say to get Nyx's attention; how to be charming; and (very crucial to the god's survival) how to interpret her responses and body language to press forward or back swiftly off as needed.",
      "Eros hopes Dio survives.",
      "Actually, he thinks Nyx will like him.",
      "She's still technically Eros' sister, after all, and he thinks he knows her tastes.",
      "---------- No one really knows where the Erotes come from, the way that no one quite knows how Aphrodite was born or whose son Eros really is.",
      "(The answer: no one's son but Chaos - though he and all the other Erotes consistently call Ares 'Daddy,' if for no other reason than to unsettle everyone)",
      "For the most part, everyone assumes that Aphrodite gave birth to them all, which is sort of true in a way, and none of them correct this easy assumption.",
      "Hermaphroditus is the first major deviation to the squad, though they don't realize it, by way of not being split off of Eros himself.",
      "It's Dionysus who brings Hermaphroditus over to meet Eros - Eros' attention is immediately caught by the unusual circumstance of this person.",
      "Dionysus was raised as a girl, and was born from a male, and is fairly loose and free with gender roles according to his inclination of the moment, though he trends towards male.",
      "As such, he's been assigned a minor domain of intersex and transgender people.",
      "This role doesn't get him much attention, and Eros doubts there are any formal ceremonies dedicated to it, but Dionysus takes it seriously.",
      "He's spent the last few months walking with Hermaphroditus, as they accustom themselves to their new life.",
      "Hermaphroditus is the result of another very unusual act of creation - a young man, the son of Hermes and Aphrodite, who met a nymph named Salmacis.",
      "After a long, long discussion, of being a man, versus being a woman, and finding a connection in each other in feeling not quite at ease in their own bodies and the roles assigned to them, they attempted to make love - and two became one in more than the metaphorical sense.",
      "To their surprise, and Eros' delight, the union of their minds took a physical form and fused the two of them together, leaving them in a body that is neither male nor female, but both.",
      "The change was wholly unexpected and confusing, and left Hermaphroditus (the name they decided to keep) stressed and isolated.",
      "To make matters worse, the rumors have begun to spread about the spring of Salmacis cursing men to perversion and effeminacy.",
      "Hermaphroditus, who has been very quiet during this explanation from Dionysus, speaks up, still in a soft voice.",
      "\"I still... don't know how to feel about it, but... we did have something, and it -Dionysus thinks that maybe it would help - I want to be able to help anyone else, who's going through the same thing...\" \"Yeah, sure!\"",
      "Eros says, waving his hand easily.",
      "Hermaphroditus and Dionysus both blink at him in surprise.",
      "\"R-really...?\" Hermaphroditus asks, uncertainly.",
      "\"I don't know how much worship you'll get, but yeah, I can see this being a situation that would call for more than a generic arrow.\"",
      "Eros is completely excited and curious about this new form of creation - as the god of procreation, this is something rare, and outside the normal scope of his experience.",
      "Hermaphroditus' first effort comes sooner than expected.",
      "Iphis, in a reversal from Dionysus, is a mortal woman raised as a man, and fell in love with a woman named Ianthe.",
      "The feelings were returned, which might have simply been Anteros' department, but the obstacle of Iphis' gender made it complicated.",
      "\"Hermaphroditus can help,\" Eros suggests, hoping to see another fusion.",
      "Hermaphroditus does help, though it's not quite as exciting as creating a new life-form: they have a long discussion with both Iphis and Ianthe, asking what it is they really want from this relationship.",
      "For her part, although Ianthe is startled to realize that her male romantic interest is biologically female, she nonetheless fell in love with a charming person named Iphis and is content to accept that person in any form.",
      "Iphis himself determines that for better or worse, having been raised as a man for so long, that's how he sees himself.",
      "The choice seems clear, if unorthodox.",
      "Hermaphroditus petitions Aphrodite, the only love deity with enough power to transform another, to make Iphis a man in truth.",
      "Aphrodite agrees, and to everyone's surprise, Queen Hera is enthusiastic enough to preside over the marriage.",
      "\"They want to enter a marriage, of course I support that!",
      "They're making the commitment to start a family together, rather than just flirting around and wasting time indefinitely,\" Hera explains, when asked.",
      "Eros and Aphrodite still roll their eyes that Hera thinks any love or sex is wasted unless it's for a purpose, but Eros finds himself pleasantly surprised that she's on board with helping these two find happiness.",
      "Maybe she's not quite the prude he thought.",
      "It isn't until he's standing around at the wedding with Hera, Aphrodite and Hymenaios, who are all pleased about the happy ending, that Eros realizes.",
      "He remembers that he, Eros, personally said with his own mouth, that this was a situation that was complicated, and welcomed a new role to the concept of having sex, and that he predicted it correctly.",
      "That was the beginning of the end.",
      "--------------- His old friend Dionysus, great seductor of Nyx, is getting hitched.",
      "All seems to be in order; Anteros is involved, and so is Hymenaios.",
      "Everyone's in good standing.",
      "Then Eros meets the lucky bride, and makes a startled observation: \"Oh, it's you!",
      "Ariadne!",
      "Weren't you with Theseus?\"",
      "This tactless question is also mostly pointless - Eros already knows she was lovers with Theseus.",
      "He shot the two of them himself.",
      "Everything seemed to be going swimmingly then - mutual attraction, hot sex, defeating monsters and sailing off into the sunset.",
      "Or sailing off to the north, anyway, from Crete to Athens.",
      "But anyway, wasn't she boning Theseus?",
      "It's just as he's belatedly realizing that clearly she isn't anymore, and he probably shouldn't ask, but Dionysus is familiar with Eros' ways by now, and answers when Ariadne twists her fingers awkwardly.",
      "\"Theseus ended up being as smart as he is honorable - which is to say, not at fucking all.",
      "He abandoned the loveliest, cleverest mortal on earth - just left her on the deserted island of Naxos!",
      "Poor Ariadne put up with a lot of shit, but ultimately it turned out great that he's a stupid asshole, right?\" Ariadne smiles up at him.",
      "\"Yes.",
      "It was worth everything to have you find me.\"",
      "Eros is feeling a little unmoored.",
      "Theseus and Ariadne had been nuts for each other.",
      "He'd seen it.",
      "It had been a very successful shot.",
      "The attraction had been there, it had been real.",
      "But it had stopped?",
      "He's never given any thought, before, to what happens after he fires his arrows.",
      "People get hot for each other, it either gets sexy or funny or both, Eros wanders away.",
      "He never sees long-term fallout...",
      "never sees people lose interest in each other.",
      "It's very... distressing to him, suddenly, to think that people can share a passion like Theseus and Ariadne did, and enjoy each other's company so much, only for it to fade.",
      "And fade to the point where one partner abandoned the other to die on a deserted island, alone.",
      "Is that the lasting effect of Eros' work?",
      "A moment of fun, to be replaced with pain and resentment?",
      "At the moment, Dionysus and Ariadne are looking at him quizzically.",
      "\"I'm... sorry you had to go through that,\" Eros says.",
      "Dionysus is shocked into silence at his words: this is the first time, in his existence, that Eros has apologized for anything.",
      "Ariadne doesn't realize the momentous occasion for what it is, and smiles.",
      "\"Yes, well...",
      "I haven't thought much of him at all since Dio found me.",
      "Theseus' foolish choice turned out to be my good fortune, yes?\"",
      "\"Yeah...",
      "yeah, I guess you got lucky...\" \"Very lucky,\" Dionysus says, taking her hand.",
      "\"I didn't think anyone could measure up to Nyx, but babe, you - \".",
      "\"Ah-ah.",
      "No comparing me to any goddesses, please.",
      "I'm just happy to hear you love me,\" says Ariadne, who is definitely cleverer than most.",
      "They're very warm towards each other.",
      "They clearly have the hots for each other and it's all smiles and soft murmurs and holding hands.",
      "But...",
      "Theseus felt the same way at one point.",
      "Didn't he?",
      "After this conversation, Eros can never fire his arrows in quite such a happy-go-lucky fashion again.",
      "He finds himself wondering all the time now, what happens to the people afterwards.",
      "----------- Zephyrus is not an Erote.",
      "He is one of the Anemoi - the four wind gods.",
      "He is the west wind; the gentlest wind; the wind of springtime and flowers and fruit.",
      "And Zephyrus is a killer.",
      "Zephyrus would be dead, were it not for Eros' intervention.",
      "Apollo would have murdered him, more brutally than Hyacinthus was murdered.",
      "Eros suspects - and Zephyrus is certain - that Apollo would have had him flayed alive for the wind's role in Hyacinthus' death; and perhaps spared only to be thrown into Tartarus, if Zeus permitted it.",
      "Eros intervenes.",
      "Looking back, he's not quite sure why he did it.",
      "It was just a hunch, that there was something more to it.",
      "He had known that Zephyrus had in some way been motivated out of love.",
      "But Eros normally doesn't take responsibility for any acts carried out in his name... unless those acts are funny, of course.",
      "This act wasn't funny.",
      "Hyacinthus was beloved by all who saw him, but none more than Apollo.",
      "Eros knows this, because he personally sent an arrow Apollo's way, to spur him on.",
      "And watching the vain, proud, dignified Apollo throw himself at the mortal prince was a delight to watch, right up until the jealous west wind sent a discus astray and killed the boy.",
      "Zephyrus is Eros' servant, now, though Eros doesn't make much use of him.",
      "Eros doesn't need to be carried by the wind; he carries himself on his own wings.",
      "And frankly, for a pretty long time afterwards, Zephyrus is depressing to be around.",
      "He's crippled with guilt and grief; and unlike Apollo, who mourns for the same reason, Zephyrus does not have a circle of family and friends to support him.",
      "He only has Eros.",
      "Eros is an excellent friend to have for standing up to a furious Apollo, and refusing to back down and hand the wind god over for punishment.",
      "It's tense in the hall.",
      "The Erotes are huddled off to the side, grouped around Zephyrus, who stares at the ground without reacting.",
      "Apollo is nearly apoplectic with fury.",
      "Eros has never looked so grim in his existence.",
      "In spite of his lack of a position in the Council of Twelve, the gods all are familiar with Eros' power, and know the damage he can do when he's in a good mood.",
      "They don't want to see what he can do when angered, and they coax Apollo to back down.",
      "Tears of rage and sorrow stream down his face, but Apollo finally turns away from revenge on Zephyrus.",
      "So Eros did some good there.",
      "But what Zephyrus really needs, badly, is someone to talk about his damn Feelings, and Eros is no use for that.",
      "Not that he doesn't try.",
      "He makes an effort to talk to Zephyrus about it shortly after the incident, in fact: \"Hey, Z., why'd you kill that kid, anyway?",
      "If you liked him so much?\"",
      "His attempt to be casual might have been a little too on the mark, but Zephyrus only flinches and stares off at the clouds.",
      "\"Anagapesis,\" the wind god says at last, in a hoarse voice.",
      "\"Uh...?\"",
      "Zephyrus spreads his hands; an empty gesture.",
      "\"He loved me, once.",
      "He loved me first.",
      "He and I - \" He sniffles, and Eros realizes to his horror that the wind god is crying.",
      "\"It just, stopped.",
      "He saw Apollo and everything else fell away.",
      "I fell away.",
      "It was over, just like that.",
      "I didn't exist, we didn't exist, anymore.",
      "I couldn't understand it.",
      "He tried to be kind about it, I guess, but I couldn't - he only had eyes for Apollo.",
      "I couldn't bear it.",
      "Anagapesis.",
      "He fell out of love.\"",
      "\"Oh... uh...\" \"I still loved him.",
      "I still do.",
      "I never meant - I thought...",
      "the discus would fly off to the side.",
      "Apollo would look stupid.",
      "It would ruin their fun.",
      "It was so petty, so stupid, and now he's dead.\"",
      "Eros is absolutely unequipped to deal with this, but even he knows he can't just fuck off out of this situation, no matter how desperately he wants to.",
      "\"Hey... look, Zephyrus, we all live a long time.",
      "You'll find someone new.",
      "You'll get past this.\"",
      "Zephyrus doesn't look like he feels any better.",
      "His shoulders slump further, wings dragging on the ground.",
      "\"Yes, I suppose you're right.",
      "Eventually.",
      "Hyacinthus will be just a moment lost in time.\"",
      "Eros blessedly catches sight of Aphrodite and flags her down desperately.",
      "She'll know how to talk about this, probably.",
      "Better than Eros can, anyway.",
      "Eros knows he was right.",
      "Gods live an awful long time, and this unpleasantness around Hyacinthus' death will wear off.",
      "And isn't that what he's all about?",
      "Sex being fun and uncomplicated and existing for its own sake?",
      "-------------- \"Anagapesis,\" he thinks to himself, as he visits Psyche again.",
      "It's dark, again, and she calls him \"lover,\" as she doesn't know his name.",
      "She never must.",
      "He's never loved anyone before.",
      "He's never experienced, personally, any of the things that the other Erotes talk about.",
      "He's always just let his dick lead the way.",
      "But now, it's as though all of the Erotes have returned to him, and are driving his actions.",
      "He loves her, and he feels a crushing relief that she seems to care for him in return (Anteros).",
      "Unable to show her his physical attractiveness, he uses sweet speech to compliment her, to turn her on, to tell her he cares for her (Hedylogos).",
      "When he's gone from his secret palace, as he is every day, he thinks of her constantly: the feel of her skin, the whispered sound of her voice, the taste of her on his tongue, and longs for her (Pothos).",
      "He even has been thinking of staying with her indefinitely, of always caring for her, of having a family with her (Hymenaios).",
      "(Hermaphroditus' domain is a little more niche than applies here, but even so, Eros can more easily imagine the indignation Iphis and Ianthe must have felt, at finding the love of their life and being forbidden from being together.",
      "It had been speculative on his part before, but how he gets it)",
      "But, he keeps thinking of Ariadne, abandoned on the shore of Naxos.",
      "He thinks of Zephyrus, left bewildered and hurt enough to do something terrible, which haunts him forever.",
      "He thinks, with a gnawing guilt, of all the times Zeus has set off to betray his wife.",
      "He thinks of Hephaestus' misery after Aphrodite and Ares had been found together.",
      "Anagapesis.",
      "His arrows are only fleeting.",
      "He doesn't let her know who he is.",
      "She can't really fall out of love with him, if she doesn't even know who her lover is in the first place, he reasons.",
      "If she sees him, she'll know instantly, so he only visits at night, and forbids a lamp to be lit.",
      "------- Afterwards - after the lamp was lit; after Aphrodite descended on the princess with her full wrath; after the punishments, the humiliating tasks - after they reconcile, after they marry, after they are lying together in bed with a lamp burning dimly nearby, he confesses to her.",
      "\"My arrows are fleeting,\" he whispers, almost unable to force the words out.",
      "\"They sting, and men and women fall to lust, and then it wears off.",
      "I feared your interest would wane, and I wouldn't be able to bear it.\"",
      "She kisses him: his temple, the soft skin of his eyelid, the corner of his mouth.",
      "\"Sometimes they do, Eros.\"",
      "She hasn't tired yet of saying his name.",
      "\"But, silly boy, people know that.",
      "If you want to make something last longer, you have to choose to keep at it.\"",
      "He wants to just accept this, but he still remembers: \"But sometimes, people choose otherwise.",

      "Himeros is naughty jokes and winks; he's happy romps in the fields between wild and careless young lovers.",
      "He falls in love easily; but moves on quickly.",
      "He requires nearly as much babysitting as Pothos: while Pothos' longing has to be monitored to avoid turning to obsession, Himeros has to be monitored to ensure he doesn't go Full Fuckboi, as Hedylogos calls it.",
      "Himeros is impetuous love Eros is stunned to see Himeros, when he appears.",
      "Himeros is, essentially, everything Eros used to be.",
      "And now he's just another way of expressing desire.",

    "text": "autolatry, n. \"self-worship\" Everyone knows the story of Athena's birth, of course - or they think they do. A fully-grown Athena bursts out of Zeus' skull, armored and bellowing a war cry. The first thing she sees with her own eyes is her Uncle Poseidon and her teenaged brother Ares - still young but already so strong - holding her father down, as the Titan Prometheus stands with a hammer and chisel in his hands, having split the way for her escape from his forehead. It's rather a thrilling tale. And particularly mysterious as it involves Zeus, and yet there's no sex or violence. In fact, that's rather the point. Speculation is rampant. Most seem to settle on a vague idea that Zeus ate one of his former lovers, and she gave birth inside of him, which is an odd story, but no odder than the truth. But the truth is something that no-one knows, except Athena and Zeus. And it has to stay that way forever. ------- Her first memories are chaotic and confused, so she doesn't care to revisit them often. The negativity attached to the memories are less troubling to her - the fear, the loneliness. It's the murky chaos that irritates her. This is the beginning: when she was only the start of a thought that would become Athena. -------- As a young god, Zeus is alone and terrified. Cronus has sent his creatures after him - towering giants, the size of mountains, made of primordial materials and glowing eyes and teeth and claws, only barely humanoid in form. They come after Zeus, who is only a boy who misses his mother, and all he can do is run from them, and hide. He is small and weak now, and cannot possibly hope to survive challenging the king of the Titans. The monsters persist, and Zeus becomes more desperate. He's beginning to run out of hiding places. The creatures' claws can almost catch him now and on one occasion, they tear at him. Zeus manages to escape, but not without wounds that leave him limping and weeping in pain and fear. He is only a boy, a child, who cannot run to his mother in case Cronus finds him there. The nymphs who helped him before are long scattered by Cronus' creatures - or worse, captured and punished. Zeus is alone. He stumbles to a pool of water with the immediate intention of washing the blood off his hands and out of his hair and it is there that Athena rises from the mire of pain and confusion for the first time. He imagines a girl, his own age. Her hair is red as the blood that stains the clear water. Her eyes are grey, like his. Why a girl? Why red hair? Why any of the features he eventually attributed to her? There is no real answer. It's just what came to mind. The girl speaks to him, in a voice clear and calm. The girl is not afraid, like him; and she speaks with confidence. You need to go to that goat you heard of - Amalthea. \"I've been looking for her,\" Zeus says, in a hoarse whisper. Yes, in forests and alongside lakes. You won't find many goats in a forest. They live in rocky, mountainous places, or places with no trees. \"If there are no trees, how can I hide?\" You'll need to kill an animal and wear its hide. It'll serve you long enough to reach her. Take a sheep from one of the humans. \"Stealing?\" First and foremost, you need to survive. If it bothers you, you can make it up to them after you're king. This is the first time that Zeus has thought of a plan ahead, rather than simply thinking of running and hiding - and certainly the first time he's taken it on assumption that he will be king in his father's place. He resumes searching for Amalthea, and the person that will be Athena begins to form clearer. The next time one of Cronus' creatures draws near, Zeus hears advice in her voice. Smear yourself with cow dung. It won't want to come near. He imagines her reminding him: Walk through streams wherever you can. It will cover your tracks and your scent. He imagines her when the rain pours unceasingly and he has no choice but to stop. He's stuck in a cave eating the cheese he stole from some humans and there's nothing to do but huddle and wait, so he imagines the voice again, in conversation with him. He begins speaking at length, mostly in whispers under his breath. They're little more than daydreams at first. He imagines himself walking beneath the open sky, talking with his companion about whatever is on his mind. He imagines her replies. He replies to those replies, and in this manner he continues talking until he falls asleep eventually, alone in his cave. The figure in his head begins to take on oddities of personality - she naturally takes an interest in the things of concern to him, which a typical woman might not be: she converses with him about the eventual battle that will take place against the Titans; she sketches out designs for armor and weapons; she muses over potential alliances. She speculates what his brothers and sisters must be like. And yet, because the nymphs that Zeus has known have all been interested in weaving and pottery... so is this person that Zeus talks to. She speaks sometimes of looms and kilns, things he associates with safety and warmth and the women who have cared for him before. He imagines a girl working hard on a tapestry and compliments her on it. He imagines the girl pleased by his praise. And before long, Zeus is imagining that she is praising him when he does something well, and the praise encourages him. These exchanges of mutual respect are what eventually inspire him to begin calling her by a name: Athena, spun off the word aine - \"Praise.\" Her voice is always uniformly calm, always practical, always wise beyond her years. She sometimes seems cold in her calculations, but she reminds him that sometimes the calculations must be cold in order to survive. And there is never a question that she is Zeus' friend - always, always, she guides him. She is always on his side, his only companion. (It occurs to Zeus that he might be losing his mind - but, well, what of it? He had certainly been going mad before from the fear and loneliness, and this is preferable. He lives by her wisdom; he is not alone anymore. He begins to think of her only in terms of a real person) Eventually, he finds the ancient and benevolent she-goat, Amalthea, and shelters beneath her, still wearing his sheepskin. Her presence masks his, and for a time, some of the constant strain of survival recedes at last. And yet, he has grown too used to his imaginary companion. The mental conversations continue over time as he grows - a bit taller, a bit stronger, a bit more confident in himself as he takes her advice and succeeds. He is able to slip into dangerous territory for brief raids, to speak to other nymphs or Titans who are unconvinced that Cronus' rule will last long - but not yet convinced that this gangly teenage god is going to depose him. He consults with Athena for a long time one night as they plan how to retrieve his siblings from Cronus. In spite of the warlike abilities he has attributed to her, she surprises him by suggesting a more guileful plan of action. Cronus is already old, and powerful, while you aren't yet much more than a child, her voice points out matter-of-factly. You could not defeat him in battle without assistance. And if you can retrieve your brothers and sisters, proving that you can outsmart him and gain strength thereby, others of the Old Gods may be more inclined to ally with you. It is Athena's idea to ask Metis, the Oceanid, to drug Cronus. As Zeus has come to anticipate, the plan goes flawlessly - Cronus consumes the drug and vomits forth all five of his siblings. They're hacked up unceremoniously, and fall, dazed and covered in slime, onto the dirt, shrinking from the air and sunlight. Zeus rushes out to aid them while Cronus is still wracked with spasms, incapacitated by nausea. He hurriedly assists them into carts pulled by attendants of Amalthea, and they flee before Cronus can recover. This... is where Athena nearly disappears. Because now, Zeus' companions are real. He hardly knows what to do. He's so delighted to see them, so perplexed by their reality - in turns awed and skittish at the same time. He talks to them, and they reply back. He can touch them. An imaginary voice in his head, no matter how loyal, no matter how beloved, cannot compare to a brother's hand on his shoulder, a sister's grateful kiss on the cheek. But Athena is saved from extinction by the fact that they do not measure up to his standards, immediately. There is no question that he loves them already, unconditionally, almost bordering on desperation. But he is unaccustomed to being surrounded by others, and finds it hard to accept their interjections into his own life. They disagree and even argue with him sometimes, for one thing, which is bewildering. Athena never argued with him. She pointed out things he may have missed, but her loyalty was always to him, because she was him. His sisters resist some of his physical touches - politely, but firmly, which he tries to accept but he's wanted a female companion for so long. Part of him can see why these things are happening, but he struggles. His survival and strength is greater than ever with them here, but... Zeus is unaccustomed to differing points of view, different loyalties, different wants. Further complicating things is the fact that Zeus can see their wisdom doesn't compare to Athena's. This is incontestable - they acknowledge it - and understandable. They were swallowed the moment they were born. They know nothing of the world. They've only existed in Cronus' stomach - little to learn there. It's a sobering moment when he realizes how much responsibility is still on his shoulders - that even though he will be relying on them during the inevitable Titanomachy, he still needs to protect them. Which means, he still needs Athena. He knows even without consulting her voice, that it isn't wise to tell the others about her. He's the one who rescued them; he's the one who is planning the battle. Whether or not he feels ready for the role, he's become their leader, and it's not going to inspire confidence for his brothers and sisters to learn that their savior and leader had to create an imaginary friend to talk to while he huddled in caves, cringing in terror from the creatures they will be battling. So the conversations stop, but he still listens to the whisper of her voice in his head. Athena doesn't disappear. On her advice, he frees the Cyclopes from Tartarus and earns their loyalty. She is with him when they give him the gift of lightning - which helps him to finally win over the aid of Prometheus and Themis. Their assistance (Prometheus in particular becomes close to Zeus) drives her even further back - and yet, she is with him every minute of the ten-year war, and the terrible final battle. When it's all done, Zeus, Poseidon, and Hades all draw lots to divide the rule of the universe, and that seems to be the end of Zeus' need for Athena. He's a man now, with his brothers and sisters beside him, and Cronus is defeated. He is king, as she told him he would be. He has a wife, he has children. He has no need of an imaginary girl to keep him company. But by now, it is too late. The imaginary friend of a god is something quite different from that of a mortal - particularly if this imaginary friend has been so strongly loved and respected for so many long years. Athena has been conceived. She is created, she is real. She continues to grow, inside Zeus' head, becoming realer and realer until the day she must exit his skull, and she does, to the utter incomprehension of all - except Zeus, who recognizes her instantly. He says nothing of who she really is, and allows the misconception to form that she is his daughter, somehow. He favors her above all his other children, but can't explain why, no matter how their resentment simmers and seethes. Nor can she. No one must know the terrified child Zeus once was. That is the story of Athena's birth. She is a collection of thoughts; an imaginary being brought to existence by the will of the god who imagined her. She is wise and fearsome because that is what Zeus needed her to be. She is the only creature of her species to exist - until the day she isn't. -------- Hephaestus is a mystery for all of them at first. One day, Hera was roundly gravid, and pleased with herself; the next, she is no longer pregnant but there is no child and Hera spends weeks locked in her room, weeping and speaking to no one. Everyone assumes, at first, that the child did not survive. They do not speak of it - but eventually, as they so often do, the whispers begin to swirl. Hera's sisters know. Hestia is a locked vault; she knows the secrets of everyone in Olympus because everyone comes to her to talk; but they all come to her because they know she can be trusted to keep her silence. Demeter, though... Demeter is a wild and free spirit, for whom the concept of discretion is alien. From her, Athena learns what she probably could have deduced herself: Hera has sent her son to live with the Nereids Thetis and Eurynome, in a grotto of the palace of her own foster parents, Oceanus and Thetys. The boy, Hephaestus, does not leave the grotto. Athena does not have occasion to investigate this grotto, and presumes she would not be welcome there. His isolation is doubtless for his own protection, as the only two consistent rumors about him are that 1) he is ugly and deformed beyond anything ever seen before in a god; and 2) because of this, Hera rejected him and threw him from Olympus. Athena takes what she knows: Hephaestus was conceived in much the way she was. This is an 'open secret;' Hera was quite transparent about her rage and hurt, after Zeus apparently rejected her as a wife, and the mother of his children, in favor of having his own child entirely solo. Neither Zeus nor Athena can correct this. But where Athena is flawless and brilliant, Hephaestus is disfigured and his life touched with constant bitterness. Athena was born of a genuine love and need, and was developed over years and years. Hephaestus was born in an act of retribution, and was prenatal for only a few months. Hera is no more flawed than her husband; she is no less of a goddess. The difference, then, was that Athena was Zeus' beloved imaginary friend for so long, whereas Hephaestus... was not. Hera didn't know the rules of imaginary friends. How could she? Even Athena only realized why she turned out the way she did, after seeing how Hephaestus turned out. Athena doubts Hera rejected Hephaestus. She suspects that Hera feared for him. Olympus is a cruel place sometimes; no place for the weak. And perhaps she feared that Zeus might kill her failed attempt at solo childbearing. Hephaestus only exists because Hera believed Zeus must have hated her, hated their child. Eventually, Hephaestus sends a rigged throne as a gift for Hera, trapping her in place. Her pain is visible; she cannot move, cannot breath; the fine, invisible chains cut at her. In this manner everyone in Olympus is in on the secret: Hephaestus lives, and he hates Hera above all else in this world. Hera's heartbreak is visible for the world to see; no one wants to meet her eyes, even as they struggle to free her. Even those who have cause to hate her - Apollo and Artemis; Aphrodite; Dionysus... her pain is awful enough that they set all animosity aside and try to get Hephaestus to undo his cursed gift. After all threats and diplomacy and shouting have finished, after Hera is freed, after Hephaestus is invited to stay on Olympus - everyone assumes that Hera will be cold towards such a cruel son, especially one that she rejected in the first place. But she is almost desperate to make amends with him, though she restrains herself from showing it too strongly. She commissions him to make far more jewelry than she normally wears. She insists on making him a member of the Council of Twelve. Hera feels responsible for all the misery in his life, since it was her weakness that caused him to take the form he did. Athena knows differently. Zeus knows, too. His wife's agony tears him apart - both during her agony in the throne, and her shame afterwards. He is much tenderer to Hera for a long while after that. But he doesn't say why, and neither does Athena. ------- Her existence negatively affects one final person: Ares, the god of war and courage. Ares, once a reasonably polite and friendly young man, is now angry and rude almost constantly. The newer Olympians don't remember him any other way. He hates Athena. The feeling is not quite mutual, though the differences lie mostly in semantics. Athena does not hate him with the same passion he hates her. She is exasperated by him, constantly - as the oldest legitimate son of Zeus, he should be far more responsible, far more cautious, far more of a leader. At first, she attempts to guide him as she guided Zeus, but Ares responds to her wisdom with a furious hatred. Over time, his insolence and rudeness wear at her, and turn exasperation into dislike. She knows Zeus feels the same way - they often feel the same way about things. But she knows as well that Zeus has an edge to his dislike. In Ares, he sees a weak young man, too much like how Zeus himself could have been. But whereas Zeus himself listened to wisdom and forced himself to grow up, to make sacrifices, Ares defiantly ignores anyone's advice, often resulting in his own harm and making himself look like a fool. In addition to that, there is always the hidden threat that he may follow the pattern of sons killing their fathers. He certainly has motive enough, though Athena can certainly see he lacks the skill or, more importantly, the ambition. Ares knows none of this. He knows only that he has already lost his father's love, and has been replaced by any of a half dozen others who have come after him, most particularly Athena. He assumes everyone hates him because he isn't as talented as Hephaestus, as charming as Apollo, as funny as Hermes... and he isn't as perfect in every way as Athena. He becomes lost in his own anger. He starts inadvisable fights; disappears for weeks at a time to go off somewhere, unsupervised and unauthorized. He stands, sullen and defiant, when Zeus yells at him. It's almost comical: Zeus wants Ares to be more like Athena. Ares is doing everything possible to be as different from Athena as he can, and yet, he's so much like his father. The main thing that sets Athena apart from Zeus, Ares, or any other god, is that she is perpetually calm and collected, sometimes at the expense of ever expressing emotion. People sometimes express pity over this, but honestly, after she watches Zeus/Ares, or Zeus/Hera or Ares/Hephaestus etc etc etc go at it, fighting and bellowing, Athena's so fucking happy to have an emotional handicap. ------- Athena wishes, often, that she could tell Ares that even if he wasn'tan oaf, a ruffian and a dullard, it wouldn't matter. Ares is an actual child of Zeus; currently his only legitimate son. And Ares was always his own individual being from the start, and one who grew to be his own self, with interests apart from Zeus. Ares is going in his own direction, even if it's not where Zeus wants him to go. Athena, conversely, is the culmination of what Zeus admires. She was created that way. She was his first companion and a part of him. Comparing Ares to Athena is pointless in every sense. She wishes she could tell Hera that Hephaestus wasn't a reflection of her failure and a sign of her rejection by Zeus. She wishes she could let Hera know that Zeus understands exactly why Hephaestus turned out the way he did, and he sees his birth not as a sign of Hera's weakness but as a sign of how sorrowful she must have been, and that he really does accept the boy, and Hera herself. She wishes she could tell Hephaestus that he is just like her but better, because he was born unlucky but managed to create ways around every disability. And that even though he was born of bitterness and sorrow, he has managed to retain a core of kindness and sympathy unmatched by any other god except perhaps Hestia. That Athena may be a living symbol of the need for a cool head, but Hephaestus is a living symbol of the need for love and acceptance. She wishes she could tell him that even though the two of them bear no relation at all, as these things are commonly drawn, she nonetheless considers him her closest relative of them all, even over Zeus, because she and Hephaestus do have a shared parent of sorts: it was loneliness that created them. But she says nothing. Zeus is the king of all the heavens, the ruler of gods and men. His rule cannot be undermined. Athena came into existence with that prerogative instilled in her: Zeus must survive, and he must be king. He is Zeus the almighty. No one can know that Zeus was so afraid and so lonely that he created an imaginary friend to guide him through his trials. They can't know that his mood swings are the result of him constantly craving contact and yet trusting no one. They can't know that's why she's his favorite; they can't know that's why she'll always be first in his heart. Telling the truth of how she was born might do something to appease the sorrows of Ares, of Hera, of Hephaestus - but they cannot know. In many ways, it is as though she is still trapped in Zeus' skull. --------------- And so it is that at the marriage of Hephaestus and Aphrodite, which is certainly doomed before it even starts; which can only intensify the unhappiness of everyone present, with repercussions that may last for centuries; unhappiness which all - all - can be traced back indirectly to a frightened child hiding in a cave.......... when Zeus makes his appearance at the wedding, Athena kneels before him, bowing her head. \"Zeus. My father; my king,\" she says. And nothing more. ------------",

      "Her voice is always uniformly calm, always practical, always wise beyond her years.",
      "She sometimes seems cold in her calculations, but she reminds him that sometimes the calculations must be cold in order to survive.",
      "And there is never a question that she is Zeus' friend - always, always, she guides him.",
      "She is always on his side, his only companion.",
      "(It occurs to Zeus that he might be losing his mind - but, well, what of it?",
      "He had certainly been going mad before from the fear and loneliness, and this is preferable.",
      "He lives by her wisdom; he is not alone anymore.",
      "He begins to think of her only in terms of a real person) Eventually, he finds the ancient and benevolent she-goat, Amalthea, and shelters beneath her, still wearing his sheepskin.",
      "Her presence masks his, and for a time, some of the constant strain of survival recedes at last.",
      "And yet, he has grown too used to his imaginary companion.",
      "The mental conversations continue over time as he grows - a bit taller, a bit stronger, a bit more confident in himself as he takes her advice and succeeds.",
      "He is able to slip into dangerous territory for brief raids, to speak to other nymphs or Titans who are unconvinced that Cronus' rule will last long - but not yet convinced that this gangly teenage god is going to depose him.",
      "He consults with Athena for a long time one night as they plan how to retrieve his siblings from Cronus.",
      "In spite of the warlike abilities he has attributed to her, she surprises him by suggesting a more guileful plan of action.",
      "Cronus is already old, and powerful, while you aren't yet much more than a child, her voice points out matter-of-factly.",
      "You could not defeat him in battle without assistance.",
      "And if you can retrieve your brothers and sisters, proving that you can outsmart him and gain strength thereby, others of the Old Gods may be more inclined to ally with you.",
      "It is Athena's idea to ask Metis, the Oceanid, to drug Cronus.",
      "As Zeus has come to anticipate, the plan goes flawlessly - Cronus consumes the drug and vomits forth all five of his siblings.",
      "They're hacked up unceremoniously, and fall, dazed and covered in slime, onto the dirt, shrinking from the air and sunlight.",
      "Zeus rushes out to aid them while Cronus is still wracked with spasms, incapacitated by nausea.",
      "He hurriedly assists them into carts pulled by attendants of Amalthea, and they flee before Cronus can recover.",
      "This... is where Athena nearly disappears.",
      "Because now, Zeus' companions are real.",
      "He hardly knows what to do.",
      "He's so delighted to see them, so perplexed by their reality - in turns awed and skittish at the same time.",
      "He talks to them, and they reply back.",
      "He can touch them.",
      "An imaginary voice in his head, no matter how loyal, no matter how beloved, cannot compare to a brother's hand on his shoulder, a sister's grateful kiss on the cheek.",
      "But Athena is saved from extinction by the fact that they do not measure up to his standards, immediately.",
      "There is no question that he loves them already, unconditionally, almost bordering on desperation.",
      "But he is unaccustomed to being surrounded by others, and finds it hard to accept their interjections into his own life.",
      "They disagree and even argue with him sometimes, for one thing, which is bewildering.",
      "Athena never argued with him.",
      "She pointed out things he may have missed, but her loyalty was always to him, because she was him.",
      "His sisters resist some of his physical touches - politely, but firmly, which he tries to accept but he's wanted a female companion for so long.",
      "Part of him can see why these things are happening, but he struggles.",
      "His survival and strength is greater than ever with them here, but...",
      "Zeus is unaccustomed to differing points of view, different loyalties, different wants.",
      "Further complicating things is the fact that Zeus can see their wisdom doesn't compare to Athena's.",
      "This is incontestable - they acknowledge it - and understandable.",
      "They were swallowed the moment they were born.",
      "They know nothing of the world.",
      "They've only existed in Cronus' stomach - little to learn there.",
      "It's a sobering moment when he realizes how much responsibility is still on his shoulders - that even though he will be relying on them during the inevitable Titanomachy, he still needs to protect them.",
      "Which means, he still needs Athena.",
      "He knows even without consulting her voice, that it isn't wise to tell the others about her.",
      "He's the one who rescued them; he's the one who is planning the battle.",
      "Whether or not he feels ready for the role, he's become their leader, and it's not going to inspire confidence for his brothers and sisters to learn that their savior and leader had to create an imaginary friend to talk to while he huddled in caves, cringing in terror from the creatures they will be battling.",
      "So the conversations stop, but he still listens to the whisper of her voice in his head.",
      "Athena doesn't disappear.",
      "On her advice, he frees the Cyclopes from Tartarus and earns their loyalty.",
      "She is with him when they give him the gift of lightning - which helps him to finally win over the aid of Prometheus and Themis.",
      "Their assistance (Prometheus in particular becomes close to Zeus) drives her even further back - and yet, she is with him every minute of the ten-year war, and the terrible final battle.",
      "When it's all done, Zeus, Poseidon, and Hades all draw lots to divide the rule of the universe, and that seems to be the end of Zeus' need for Athena.",
      "He's a man now, with his brothers and sisters beside him, and Cronus is defeated.",
      "He is king, as she told him he would be.",
      "He has a wife, he has children.",
      "He has no need of an imaginary girl to keep him company.",
      "But by now, it is too late.",
      "The imaginary friend of a god is something quite different from that of a mortal - particularly if this imaginary friend has been so strongly loved and respected for so many long years.",
      "Athena has been conceived.",
      "She is created, she is real.",
      "She continues to grow, inside Zeus' head, becoming realer and realer until the day she must exit his skull, and she does, to the utter incomprehension of all - except Zeus, who recognizes her instantly.",
      "He says nothing of who she really is, and allows the misconception to form that she is his daughter, somehow.",
      "He favors her above all his other children, but can't explain why, no matter how their resentment simmers and seethes.",
      "Nor can she.",
      "No one must know the terrified child Zeus once was.",
      "That is the story of Athena's birth.",
      "She is a collection of thoughts; an imaginary being brought to existence by the will of the god who imagined her.",
      "She is wise and fearsome because that is what Zeus needed her to be.",
      "She is the only creature of her species to exist - until the day she isn't.",
      "-------- Hephaestus is a mystery for all of them at first.",
      "One day, Hera was roundly gravid, and pleased with herself; the next, she is no longer pregnant but there is no child and Hera spends weeks locked in her room, weeping and speaking to no one.",
      "Everyone assumes, at first, that the child did not survive.",
      "They do not speak of it - but eventually, as they so often do, the whispers begin to swirl.",
      "Hera's sisters know.",
      "Hestia is a locked vault; she knows the secrets of everyone in Olympus because everyone comes to her to talk; but they all come to her because they know she can be trusted to keep her silence.",
      "Demeter, though...",
      "Demeter is a wild and free spirit, for whom the concept of discretion is alien.",
      "From her, Athena learns what she probably could have deduced herself: Hera has sent her son to live with the Nereids Thetis and Eurynome, in a grotto of the palace of her own foster parents, Oceanus and Thetys.",
      "The boy, Hephaestus, does not leave the grotto.",
      "Athena does not have occasion to investigate this grotto, and presumes she would not be welcome there.",
      "His isolation is doubtless for his own protection, as the only two consistent rumors about him are that 1) he is ugly and deformed beyond anything ever seen before in a god; and 2) because of this, Hera rejected him and threw him from Olympus.",
      "Athena takes what she knows: Hephaestus was conceived in much the way she was.",
      "This is an 'open secret;' Hera was quite transparent about her rage and hurt, after Zeus apparently rejected her as a wife, and the mother of his children, in favor of having his own child entirely solo.",
      "Neither Zeus nor Athena can correct this.",
      "But where Athena is flawless and brilliant, Hephaestus is disfigured and his life touched with constant bitterness.",
      "Athena was born of a genuine love and need, and was developed over years and years.",
      "Hephaestus was born in an act of retribution, and was prenatal for only a few months.",
      "Hera is no more flawed than her husband; she is no less of a goddess.",
      "The difference, then, was that Athena was Zeus' beloved imaginary friend for so long, whereas Hephaestus... was not.",
      "Hera didn't know the rules of imaginary friends.",
      "How could she?",
      "Even Athena only realized why she turned out the way she did, after seeing how Hephaestus turned out.",
      "Athena doubts Hera rejected Hephaestus.",
      "She suspects that Hera feared for him.",
      "Olympus is a cruel place sometimes; no place for the weak.",
      "And perhaps she feared that Zeus might kill her failed attempt at solo childbearing.",
      "Hephaestus only exists because Hera believed Zeus must have hated her, hated their child.",
      "Eventually, Hephaestus sends a rigged throne as a gift for Hera, trapping her in place.",
      "Her pain is visible; she cannot move, cannot breath; the fine, invisible chains cut at her.",
      "In this manner everyone in Olympus is in on the secret: Hephaestus lives, and he hates Hera above all else in this world.",
      "Hera's heartbreak is visible for the world to see; no one wants to meet her eyes, even as they struggle to free her.",
      "Even those who have cause to hate her - Apollo and Artemis; Aphrodite; Dionysus... her pain is awful enough that they set all animosity aside and try to get Hephaestus to undo his cursed gift.",
      "After all threats and diplomacy and shouting have finished, after Hera is freed, after Hephaestus is invited to stay on Olympus - everyone assumes that Hera will be cold towards such a cruel son, especially one that she rejected in the first place.",
      "But she is almost desperate to make amends with him, though she restrains herself from showing it too strongly.",
      "She commissions him to make far more jewelry than she normally wears.",
      "She insists on making him a member of the Council of Twelve.",
      "Hera feels responsible for all the misery in his life, since it was her weakness that caused him to take the form he did.",
      "Athena knows differently.",
      "Zeus knows, too.",
      "His wife's agony tears him apart - both during her agony in the throne, and her shame afterwards.",
      "He is much tenderer to Hera for a long while after that.",
      "But he doesn't say why, and neither does Athena.",
      "------- Her existence negatively affects one final person: Ares, the god of war and courage.",
      "Ares, once a reasonably polite and friendly young man, is now angry and rude almost constantly.",
      "The newer Olympians don't remember him any other way.",
      "He hates Athena.",
      "The feeling is not quite mutual, though the differences lie mostly in semantics.",
      "Athena does not hate him with the same passion he hates her.",
      "She is exasperated by him, constantly - as the oldest legitimate son of Zeus, he should be far more responsible, far more cautious, far more of a leader.",
      "At first, she attempts to guide him as she guided Zeus, but Ares responds to her wisdom with a furious hatred.",
      "Over time, his insolence and rudeness wear at her, and turn exasperation into dislike.",
      "She knows Zeus feels the same way - they often feel the same way about things.",
      "But she knows as well that Zeus has an edge to his dislike.",
      "In Ares, he sees a weak young man, too much like how Zeus himself could have been.",
      "But whereas Zeus himself listened to wisdom and forced himself to grow up, to make sacrifices, Ares defiantly ignores anyone's advice, often resulting in his own harm and making himself look like a fool.",
      "In addition to that, there is always the hidden threat that he may follow the pattern of sons killing their fathers.",
      "He certainly has motive enough, though Athena can certainly see he lacks the skill or, more importantly, the ambition.",
      "Ares knows none of this.",
      "He knows only that he has already lost his father's love, and has been replaced by any of a half dozen others who have come after him, most particularly Athena.",
      "He assumes everyone hates him because he isn't as talented as Hephaestus, as charming as Apollo, as funny as Hermes... and he isn't as perfect in every way as Athena.",
      "He becomes lost in his own anger.",
      "He starts inadvisable fights; disappears for weeks at a time to go off somewhere, unsupervised and unauthorized.",
      "He stands, sullen and defiant, when Zeus yells at him.",
      "It's almost comical: Zeus wants Ares to be more like Athena.",
      "Ares is doing everything possible to be as different from Athena as he can, and yet, he's so much like his father.",
      "The main thing that sets Athena apart from Zeus, Ares, or any other god, is that she is perpetually calm and collected, sometimes at the expense of ever expressing emotion.",
      "People sometimes express pity over this, but honestly, after she watches Zeus/Ares, or Zeus/Hera or Ares/Hephaestus etc etc etc go at it, fighting and bellowing, Athena's so fucking happy to have an emotional handicap.",
      "------- Athena wishes, often, that she could tell Ares that even if he wasn'tan oaf, a ruffian and a dullard, it wouldn't matter.",
      "Ares is an actual child of Zeus; currently his only legitimate son.",
      "And Ares was always his own individual being from the start, and one who grew to be his own self, with interests apart from Zeus.",
      "Ares is going in his own direction, even if it's not where Zeus wants him to go.",
      "Athena, conversely, is the culmination of what Zeus admires.",
      "She was created that way.",
      "She was his first companion and a part of him.",
      "Comparing Ares to Athena is pointless in every sense.",
      "She wishes she could tell Hera that Hephaestus wasn't a reflection of her failure and a sign of her rejection by Zeus.",
      "She wishes she could let Hera know that Zeus understands exactly why Hephaestus turned out the way he did, and he sees his birth not as a sign of Hera's weakness but as a sign of how sorrowful she must have been, and that he really does accept the boy, and Hera herself.",
      "She wishes she could tell Hephaestus that he is just like her but better, because he was born unlucky but managed to create ways around every disability.",
      "And that even though he was born of bitterness and sorrow, he has managed to retain a core of kindness and sympathy unmatched by any other god except perhaps Hestia.",
      "That Athena may be a living symbol of the need for a cool head, but Hephaestus is a living symbol of the need for love and acceptance.",
      "She wishes she could tell him that even though the two of them bear no relation at all, as these things are commonly drawn, she nonetheless considers him her closest relative of them all, even over Zeus, because she and Hephaestus do have a shared parent of sorts: it was loneliness that created them.",
      "But she says nothing.",
      "Zeus is the king of all the heavens, the ruler of gods and men.",
      "His rule cannot be undermined.",
      "Athena came into existence with that prerogative instilled in her: Zeus must survive, and he must be king.",
      "He is Zeus the almighty.",
      "No one can know that Zeus was so afraid and so lonely that he created an imaginary friend to guide him through his trials.",
      "They can't know that his mood swings are the result of him constantly craving contact and yet trusting no one.",
      "They can't know that's why she's his favorite; they can't know that's why she'll always be first in his heart.",
      "Telling the truth of how she was born might do something to appease the sorrows of Ares, of Hera, of Hephaestus - but they cannot know.",
      "In many ways, it is as though she is still trapped in Zeus' skull.",
      "--------------- And so it is that at the marriage of Hephaestus and Aphrodite, which is certainly doomed before it even starts; which can only intensify the unhappiness of everyone present, with repercussions that may last for centuries; unhappiness which all - all - can be traced back indirectly to a frightened child hiding in a cave.......... when Zeus makes his appearance at the wedding, Athena kneels before him, bowing her head.",
      "\"Zeus.",
      "My father; my king,\" she says.",
      "And nothing more. ------------"

    "text": "Perseus is named Monkhbayar this time, and is a woman in Mongolia. The name means \"Eternal Joy,\" which is pleasingly appropriate. Hermes dithers a bit over what form he wants his vessel to take - should he be a man, or a woman? Or neither? Mongolia is fairly relaxed on the matters of women's rights - far more so than Ancient Greece - and queer people, while not common or particularly visible, are generally accepted. Hermes eventually decides that, since Tiresias claimed that a woman enjoys sex more (which he hopes will be a Thing later), he will play the part of an attractive lady named Odtsetseg - \"Star Flower\". Perseus will appreciate the choice of name later, when she begins to remember who they are. Perseus' new family is nomadic, as are all of her friends, but they're very modern - Hermes connects with her over a televised singing competition they both enjoy, and they watch it in the family ger while tending to her baby sister and brother. Some things stay the same in Perseus' soul, no matter who or where she is - she loves horses and wants to compete in the nomad games someday. She practices archery and observes that her one eye has always been sharper than the other. Hermes only smiles and cheers her on while she practices. In the summer when Perseus-Monkhbayar turns sixteen, they go out to see the Perseid meteor shower. ----- *a few thousand years earlier* Perseus is an old man, and he won't get any older now. His breath rattles in his chest; his hands are brittle and weak. Of his failing body, only his left eye looks sharp and untouched by time. \"There'll be a constellation of you in the sky, in the north,\" Hermes tells him. His eyes are dry because he doesn't want Perseus' last memory to be of Hermes weeping. He's holding one of the frail hands in one of his own, and gently running the fingers of his other hand over the paperlike skin of the old man's face. \"And every year there'll be meteors - tons of em - coming from your constellation, so it'll look like you're pouring stars over the world.\" He kisses Perseus' fingertips. \"No one will ever be able to forget you.\" He isn't certain if Perseus understands him. His mind seems to come and go these days, and even when he's in full possession of his thoughts, he often gets so very, very tired now. But he's fortunate this time, for Perseus rolls that bright blue eye and smiles. \"Gaudy and frivolous- definitely your style,\" he wheezes. \"Mind how you place these meteors - if you make it look like I'm pissing stars, I swear I'll drag myself out of the Underworld to take my revenge.\" Hermes laughs, delighted to be insulted one more time. Hours later, Perseus dies, and Hermes personally carries his soul to Hades, gently in his arms, never to see him again. With Zeus' aid, he creates the constellation as promised. The stars pour from Perseus' arms every summer and Hermes never forgets. And then, some years later, Hermes is astonished to feel the pull of a familiar soul, far to the north and west, in barbarian lands. He goes at once to investigate. On the far coast of the continent, in a land called Norway, Perseus is there, alive. He's a great deal longer and leaner this time, a gangly and awkward child, and with coal-black hair. He has no memory of Hermes or Greece, and only answers to the name \"Stian.\" There's no mistaking this soul. Hermes fell in love with this soul; cradled it in his arms as he delivered him to Hades. And if the feel of the soul wasn't enough, there's the eye: one eye blazes blue, much sharper and brighter than the other. He's reincarnated, Hermes eventually learns. Which does happen from time to time, but usually, the slate's wiped clean, and Hermes shouldn't be able to find him again like this. It's Persephone who explains that it's because Hermes gave Perseus his eye, all that time ago. \"Now he's in possession of a piece of a god, so his existence will be different forever. And yours too, in the sense that he'll always have that tie to you, and you'll always be able to find him.\" She looks faintly annoyed but mostly amused, which is good: sometimes the ratio of annoyance to humor is difficult to keep in balance with Hermes. Perseus-Stian is treated like royalty from birth. His eye marks him as chosen by Odin, which creates an awkward diplomatic situation. Athena, on Zeus' behalf, has to accompany him to apologize to King Odin himself for the mischief, but luckily the War God only laughs and waves it off. \"I know how it is when you get fonder of a mortal than you ought. In any case, I've somewhat of a reputation as a trickster myself, you know! I appreciate a ridiculous situation as much as you, I'm sure. I'm willing to grant him some of my favor, just to see how this pans out.\" (Athena shakes her head at Hermes and scolds him afterwards, remarking in exasperation that it's lucky for him that he can charm his way out of so much trouble) Perseus continues to grow up in Norway, oblivious and carefree. Though he is guided towards a role of leadership in his community, his true passion is for riding the fjord horses every chance he gets. Hermes befriends him in the guise of a harmless old hermit, and sneaks away to visit him whenever he can. He's fascinated to see the familiar soul in an unfamiliar land, living an unfamiliar life. Perseus comes to see him as a friend and mentor and is awed by how well Hermes can predict his thoughts and actions. Hermes likes to play this up, teasing him; but even though he knows the boy so well, it's still incredible to see how differently Perseus turns out in these different circumstances. The year Perseus turns sixteen, they're watching the Perseid meteor shower. They're still a source of enjoyment to Hermes - he appreciates the reminder of the good old days, even though he likes this new version of Perseus as well.Perseus-Stian is laid out on his back, lazily watching the light streak across the sky. While he's in the middle of telling an idle story about running across a bear behind the well, he abruptly stops talking and whips his head around to stare at Hermes in shock. \"W-what...??!\" he stammers in a whisper. Hermes stands up, sensing something has changed. \"Stian? \"I'm - my name is - was - Perseus -?? And you're -\" Hermes is beaming broadly now, and allows his disguise to fall away, watching as Perseus staggers in shock. \"Hermes. A pleasure to meet you again, old friend!\" It takes a bit of time. Perseus has two identities battling in his head now. He's amazed by this experience; but he defiantly declares that he is Stian and will be Stian forever. He's afraid of this foreign god who followed him across the world and watched over his life; but he also wants to hug the god tightly to him and weep that they're back together. Hermes is delighted by all of this and can't stop grinning. He latches himself into Perseus and ruffles his hair affectionately. He gleefully teases the boy when he sees him acting nervous, correctly predicting that it will be a source of mild embarrassment later on when Perseus is more comfortable with being Hermes' companion. Hermes never argues with him about being Stian the Norwegian though; he agrees that it's a part of who he is now. Perseus of Greece has changed. (Perseus-Stian asks at one point if he's supposed to worship Zeus or Odin; Hermes shrugs and says it might be smart to include a sacrifice for Zeus every once in a while but he's on Odin's turf, after all) Eventually, Perseus does come to terms with who he is. The days are wonderful after that. They go on adventures, like before, and Hermes gets his Perseus-kisses like before, and he holds Perseus while he's sleeping and marvels that such a beautiful soul should be here in his arms again. Perseus lives, marries, has children, and dies again. Hermes escorts him once again to Hades, who gives him an irritated glare. Hermes winks at Hades and gives Perseus a kiss. \"See you next time,\" he says. ------- They travel the globe together. A fisherman in southern China. A potter in North Africa. A farmer in Eastern Europe. A storyteller in Australia. A prince in Mexico. Certain aspects of his soul carry over every time, whether or not his environment permits him to indulge them: he loves horses and high places. He's a talented athlete and good with a bow and arrow. He enjoys fishing. He's an excellent leader. He always has one eye noticeably brighter than the other. Every time, when Hermes feels his presence back in the world, he seeks him out and makes apologies to the local gods, and waits. Perseus reliably remembers everything around the time he reaches adulthood. Sometimes it's earlier, sometimes it's later. Hermes makes a point of never trying to force it - he allows Perseus to become whoever it is he's going to be this time, with no interference from Hermes, content to wait for revelation to come to Perseus when he's ready. Another rule Hermes has is to never kiss Perseus until he does remember everything. He can't put a finger on why it matters to him so much, but he doesn't want them to be romantically involved until Perseus understands who they are. Anything sooner feels... wrong, somehow. It always happens at the Perseid meteor shower. The symbol of how much Hermes cares (which sends Aphrodite through the roof when she hears the story; she doesn't stop squealing about it for years). Stars pour out over the land, and Hermes and Perseus are reunited. ------ *present day* Perseus-Monkhbayar pets the family dog, which has accompanied them out tonight, and offers a snack to Hermes-Odtsetseg. Apollo's chariot is just vanishing out of sight in the sky (Hermes had winked in response to the thumbs-up his friend had given him). \"They're pretty impressive, aren't they?\" Perseus is saying, that bright blue eye scanning the sky for any sign of the shooting stars. \"They sure are. I'm so glad you wanted to come out here to see them with me.\" Perseus shouts in delight a few minutes later, when she sees the first star streak across the sky. Hermes smiles, watching her watch the heavens, and waits.",

      "But he's fortunate this time, for Perseus rolls that bright blue eye and smiles.",
      "\"Gaudy and frivolous- definitely your style,\" he wheezes.",
      "\"Mind how you place these meteors - if you make it look like I'm pissing stars, I swear I'll drag myself out of the Underworld to take my revenge.\"",
      "Hermes laughs, delighted to be insulted one more time.",
      "Hours later, Perseus dies, and Hermes personally carries his soul to Hades, gently in his arms, never to see him again.",
      "With Zeus' aid, he creates the constellation as promised.",
      "The stars pour from Perseus' arms every summer and Hermes never forgets.",
      "And then, some years later, Hermes is astonished to feel the pull of a familiar soul, far to the north and west, in barbarian lands.",
      "He goes at once to investigate.",
      "On the far coast of the continent, in a land called Norway, Perseus is there, alive.",
      "He's a great deal longer and leaner this time, a gangly and awkward child, and with coal-black hair.",
      "He has no memory of Hermes or Greece, and only answers to the name \"Stian.\"",
      "There's no mistaking this soul.",
      "Hermes fell in love with this soul; cradled it in his arms as he delivered him to Hades.",
      "And if the feel of the soul wasn't enough, there's the eye: one eye blazes blue, much sharper and brighter than the other.",
      "He's reincarnated, Hermes eventually learns.",
      "Which does happen from time to time, but usually, the slate's wiped clean, and Hermes shouldn't be able to find him again like this.",
      "It's Persephone who explains that it's because Hermes gave Perseus his eye, all that time ago.",
      "\"Now he's in possession of a piece of a god, so his existence will be different forever.",
      "And yours too, in the sense that he'll always have that tie to you, and you'll always be able to find him.\"",
      "She looks faintly annoyed but mostly amused, which is good: sometimes the ratio of annoyance to humor is difficult to keep in balance with Hermes.",
      "Perseus-Stian is treated like royalty from birth.",
      "His eye marks him as chosen by Odin, which creates an awkward diplomatic situation.",
      "Athena, on Zeus' behalf, has to accompany him to apologize to King Odin himself for the mischief, but luckily the War God only laughs and waves it off.",
      "\"I know how it is when you get fonder of a mortal than you ought.",
      "In any case, I've somewhat of a reputation as a trickster myself, you know!",
      "I appreciate a ridiculous situation as much as you, I'm sure.",
      "I'm willing to grant him some of my favor, just to see how this pans out.\"",
      "(Athena shakes her head at Hermes and scolds him afterwards, remarking in exasperation that it's lucky for him that he can charm his way out of so much trouble) Perseus continues to grow up in Norway, oblivious and carefree.",
      "Though he is guided towards a role of leadership in his community, his true passion is for riding the fjord horses every chance he gets.",
      "Hermes befriends him in the guise of a harmless old hermit, and sneaks away to visit him whenever he can.",
      "He's fascinated to see the familiar soul in an unfamiliar land, living an unfamiliar life.",
      "Perseus comes to see him as a friend and mentor and is awed by how well Hermes can predict his thoughts and actions.",
      "Hermes likes to play this up, teasing him; but even though he knows the boy so well, it's still incredible to see how differently Perseus turns out in these different circumstances.",
      "The year Perseus turns sixteen, they're watching the Perseid meteor shower.",
      "They're still a source of enjoyment to Hermes - he appreciates the reminder of the good old days, even though he likes this new version of Perseus as well.Perseus-Stian is laid out on his back, lazily watching the light streak across the sky.",
      "While he's in the middle of telling an idle story about running across a bear behind the well, he abruptly stops talking and whips his head around to stare at Hermes in shock.",
      "\"W-what...??!\"",
      "he stammers in a whisper.",
      "Hermes stands up, sensing something has changed.",
      "\"Stian?",
      "\"I'm - my name is - was - Perseus -??",
      "And you're -\" Hermes is beaming broadly now, and allows his disguise to fall away, watching as Perseus staggers in shock.",
      "\"Hermes.",
      "A pleasure to meet you again, old friend!\"",
      "It takes a bit of time.",
      "Perseus has two identities battling in his head now.",
      "He's amazed by this experience; but he defiantly declares that he is Stian and will be Stian forever.",
      "He's afraid of this foreign god who followed him across the world and watched over his life; but he also wants to hug the god tightly to him and weep that they're back together.",
      "Hermes is delighted by all of this and can't stop grinning.",
      "He latches himself into Perseus and ruffles his hair affectionately.",
      "He gleefully teases the boy when he sees him acting nervous, correctly predicting that it will be a source of mild embarrassment later on when Perseus is more comfortable with being Hermes' companion.",
      "Hermes never argues with him about being Stian the Norwegian though; he agrees that it's a part of who he is now.",
      "Perseus of Greece has changed.",
      "(Perseus-Stian asks at one point if he's supposed to worship Zeus or Odin; Hermes shrugs and says it might be smart to include a sacrifice for Zeus every once in a while but he's on Odin's turf, after all) Eventually, Perseus does come to terms with who he is.",
      "The days are wonderful after that.",
      "They go on adventures, like before, and Hermes gets his Perseus-kisses like before, and he holds Perseus while he's sleeping and marvels that such a beautiful soul should be here in his arms again.",
      "Perseus lives, marries, has children, and dies again.",
      "Hermes escorts him once again to Hades, who gives him an irritated glare.",
      "Hermes winks at Hades and gives Perseus a kiss.",
      "\"See you next time,\" he says.",
      "------- They travel the globe together.",
      "A fisherman in southern China.",
      "A potter in North Africa.",
      "A farmer in Eastern Europe.",
      "A storyteller in Australia.",
      "A prince in Mexico.",
      "Certain aspects of his soul carry over every time, whether or not his environment permits him to indulge them: he loves horses and high places.",
      "He's a talented athlete and good with a bow and arrow.",
      "He enjoys fishing.",
      "He's an excellent leader.",
      "He always has one eye noticeably brighter than the other.",
      "Every time, when Hermes feels his presence back in the world, he seeks him out and makes apologies to the local gods, and waits.",
      "Perseus reliably remembers everything around the time he reaches adulthood.",
      "Sometimes it's earlier, sometimes it's later.",
      "Hermes makes a point of never trying to force it - he allows Perseus to become whoever it is he's going to be this time, with no interference from Hermes, content to wait for revelation to come to Perseus when he's ready.",
      "Another rule Hermes has is to never kiss Perseus until he does remember everything.",
      "He can't put a finger on why it matters to him so much, but he doesn't want them to be romantically involved until Perseus understands who they are.",
      "Anything sooner feels... wrong, somehow.",
      "It always happens at the Perseid meteor shower.",
      "The symbol of how much Hermes cares (which sends Aphrodite through the roof when she hears the story; she doesn't stop squealing about it for years).",
      "Stars pour out over the land, and Hermes and Perseus are reunited.",
      "------",
      "*present day* Perseus-Monkhbayar pets the family dog, which has accompanied them out tonight, and offers a snack to Hermes-Odtsetseg.",
      "Apollo's chariot is just vanishing out of sight in the sky (Hermes had winked in response to the thumbs-up his friend had given him).",
      "\"They're pretty impressive, aren't they?\" Perseus is saying, that bright blue eye scanning the sky for any sign of the shooting stars.",
      "\"They sure are.",
      "I'm so glad you wanted to come out here to see them with me.\"",
      "Perseus shouts in delight a few minutes later, when she sees the first star streak across the sky.",
      "Hermes smiles, watching her watch the heavens, and waits."

    "text": "Zeus judges that the boy's had enough time to sleep - they did stay up late the previous evening, but through the window, he can see Helios about a third of the way up in the sky, lounging in his chariot (the Titan appears to be reading something lewd, to judge from the way he's snickering to himself). The sounds of the palace going about its daily tasks have been in the air for a few hours now, though Ganymede tends to hear it all as a soothing white noise that only helps him sleep better. As lovely as the boy is in repose, Zeus wants to see him awake - lively, face changing expressions constantly, talking nonstop, making jokes and affectionately insulting the god in his chambers, waving his hands in excitement, touching Zeus' hair and face. So he rolls over in the bed, wrapping his arms around Ganymede and pressing kisses to his shoulders and neck. \"My prince, it is morning,\" he speaks softly into the boy's ear. \"The world awaits your presence.\" As expected, Ganymede shows no inclination to hop out of bed. Zeus does love to watch the slow return of mortals from the Hypnos' realm - the way their eyes blink open, awareness coming gradually, limbs moving sluggishly. Ganymede's return to wakefulness seems inordinately slow, sometimes - his precious prince is quite lazy in the mornings. Luckily, Zeus doesn't ever mind being persistent with a lover. Ganymede is muttering something into the pillow he is clutching. \"My prince, how it grieves me that you hold that pillow more tenderly than your own adoring companion. You might wrap your graceful arms around me instead, and soothe my aching heart.\" \"You're too hot, Kaki,\" Ganymede mumbles, shoving his face more deeply into the pillow. \"And your beard tickles.\" Zeus grins to himself and carefully adjusts the temperature of his vessel's body - specifically, the temperature of his feet. \"I only live to serve you, my prince,\" he says, drawing his legs up and pressing his now ice-cold feet onto the warm flesh of Ganymede's thighs and buttocks. The eyes fly open then! Ganymede shrieks rewardingly, arching his back as far away from the cold appendages as he is able - though Zeus still has his arms wrapped around the mortal's upper body, anchoring him in place. \"AKAKIOS! YOU MONSTER!\" \"You speak so charmingly to me, my prince; I can hardly believe I deserve it;\" Zeus says, with malicious cheerfulness. \"Good morning, by the way.\" \"You disgraceful monster of a man! I'll have you beaten!!\" Zeus nuzzles his face into the crook of Ganymede's neck, delighting in the breathy noise this produces. \"You don't fool me! You never beat your servants, you kind and gentle soul, and I'm grateful, for it leaves you quite defenseless - \" He shifts his fingers down, teasing over Ganymede's naked body, poking a finger into his bellybutton and wiggling it, and the yells of outrage dissolve into laughter. \"Akakios, n-no, you're the ahahaHA! The w-horst!\" \"I am fond of you as well, Prince,\" Zeus leaves off, flattening his hands and rubbing them soothingly, feeling the heart race below the skin. Ganymede sniffs in exaggerated disdain (false, for Zeus can see the smile lingering on his lips). \"I am not fond of you at all. Not one bit. Your name is the filthiest lie, Akakios.\" (Akakios, of course, is the name Zeus had chosen at random for his undercover persona as the boy's tutor. King Tros had made little remark of it, though clever Ganymede had immediately noticed the oddity of it. \"Oh, Akakios, is it? 'Not Evil'? Yes, it seems like a legitimate and true name, and one belonging to a trustworthy fellow,\" he had teased sarcastically, before declaring that 'Akakios' was probably secretly a pirate, or a bandit king, and had made up elaborate and entertaining tales of his scoundrel past. These tales are occasionally acted out in the bedroom, to both their amusement.) Zeus fakes an injured gasp. \"You wound me! I am the kindest and greatest of all your companions, you've always said so!\" \"Akakios, you are a horrid beast, and I'll say it as many times as I must!\" Ganymede declares, undercutting his cruel words with that flirtatious smile, weaving his fingers into Zeus' own. Zeus returns the smile and brings up Ganymede's fingers to kiss them, one at a time. \"My prince, I hesitate to criticize the love of my life, but there is a note of hypocrisy in calling me a beast, when your hair is surely as wild as any savage lion's or boar's mane!\" Ganymede blushes and makes a face, a delightful blend of embarrassed and laughing He sits up and reaches up with both hands to try to soothe his wildly vertical locks, scolding Zeus at the same time. \"Akakios - I know you are a foreigner and thus barely civilized - but you must know it's impolite to remark on one's appearance less than two minutes after one has been awakened! Rudely awakened, I might add!\" Ganymede emphasizes his point by grabbing his pillow and flinging it at the god. Zeus deflects it with a laugh. \"My prince - how right you are. I was wrong to remark thus; please forgive me.\" He bows, low, which brings his face suggestively near to Ganymede's dick, lying warm against his thigh. \"...Perhaps my lord will allow me to make it up to him.\" He flicks his eyes up to the mortal's face. Ganymede's blush has intensified, but he's watching Zeus with that pleased and sultry smile that Zeus lives to see. Ganymede smooths a lock of Zeus' hair back from his face, letting his fingers drift over the line of his cheekbones, down to his jaw. \"My dear Akakios. How lucky I am to have such a humble and worthy servant in my employ, with such clever ideas.\" He smiles again, eyes full of invitation, and leans back against the bed again, hands behind his head, allowing Zeus to enjoy the view of his flawless body. \"I suppose I can allow you to make up for your earlier incivility,\" he says, in the tones of a long-suffering man who cannot believe the insubordination of the servants these days, laughter crinkling his eyes. \"You're just lucky you're so handsome, you scoundrel.\" \"Not just handsome, my prince, if you will permit me a moment of vanity; I have other talents as well,\" Zeus says, licking his lips and leaning down to press gentle kisses to the soft skin of Ganymede's belly, his hips, his thighs. Ganymede makes pleased and pleasing noises, squirming on the bed as the god begins teasing his naked body. He always gives such lovely and encouraging reactions. A throaty squeal issues from his throat as Zeus meanders down between his legs. The god looks up, startled. Ganymede is panting, a little wild-eyed and clutching the sheets. \"You - your damned beard, Kaki!\" Zeus smiles a little wickedly. He had trimmed his beard yesterday; the hairs are much shorter and stiffer now. \"Ah? You like that, then?\" He draws his cheeks again along the tender skin of the inner thighs, down to where it meets the curve of his ass. Ganymede makes an inarticulate noise and flops back against the bed, clutching his hair. Zeus takes a great deal of pride in how swiftly he can dissemble the charming, eloquent prince. Less than two minutes in, and the sweet speeches are gone, replaced by disjointed moans and curses. \"Ahh - ah fuck, Akakios, you, you, I should - ahmmmm, fuck, damn, you're - a fucking menace - \" \"Such pretty words! Truly, you possess the soul of a poet, my dear prince,\" Zeus chuckles, dragging his beard one more time for good measure before reaching out his tongue and drawing it along the length of the prince's shaft, bringing forth a moan from the boy like a prayer to Eros. Zeus has taken many identities in his time - official identities, in his capacity as a god; and unofficial identities, when he goes undercover as a mortal. More identities than he can count, probably. But 'Kaki' is more precious to him than any other in his eternal memory, and he's pretty sure he's not going to be able to discard this one as easily.",
    "sentences": [
      "Zeus judges that the boy's had enough time to sleep - they did stay up late the previous evening, but through the window, he can see Helios about a third of the way up in the sky, lounging in his chariot (the Titan appears to be reading something lewd, to judge from the way he's snickering to himself).",
      "The sounds of the palace going about its daily tasks have been in the air for a few hours now, though Ganymede tends to hear it all as a soothing white noise that only helps him sleep better.",
      "As lovely as the boy is in repose, Zeus wants to see him awake - lively, face changing expressions constantly, talking nonstop, making jokes and affectionately insulting the god in his chambers, waving his hands in excitement, touching Zeus' hair and face.",
      "So he rolls over in the bed, wrapping his arms around Ganymede and pressing kisses to his shoulders and neck.",
      "\"My prince, it is morning,\" he speaks softly into the boy's ear.",
      "\"The world awaits your presence.\"",
      "As expected, Ganymede shows no inclination to hop out of bed.",
      "Zeus does love to watch the slow return of mortals from the Hypnos' realm - the way their eyes blink open, awareness coming gradually, limbs moving sluggishly.",
      "Ganymede's return to wakefulness seems inordinately slow, sometimes - his precious prince is quite lazy in the mornings.",
      "Luckily, Zeus doesn't ever mind being persistent with a lover.",
      "Ganymede is muttering something into the pillow he is clutching.",
      "\"My prince, how it grieves me that you hold that pillow more tenderly than your own adoring companion.",
      "You might wrap your graceful arms around me instead, and soothe my aching heart.\"",
      "\"You're too hot, Kaki,\" Ganymede mumbles, shoving his face more deeply into the pillow.",
      "\"And your beard tickles.\"",
      "Zeus grins to himself and carefully adjusts the temperature of his vessel's body - specifically, the temperature of his feet.",
      "\"I only live to serve you, my prince,\" he says, drawing his legs up and pressing his now ice-cold feet onto the warm flesh of Ganymede's thighs and buttocks.",
      "The eyes fly open then!",
      "Ganymede shrieks rewardingly, arching his back as far away from the cold appendages as he is able - though Zeus still has his arms wrapped around the mortal's upper body, anchoring him in place.",
      "\"AKAKIOS!",
      "YOU MONSTER!\"",
      "\"You speak so charmingly to me, my prince; I can hardly believe I deserve it;\" Zeus says, with malicious cheerfulness.",
      "\"Good morning, by the way.\"",
      "\"You disgraceful monster of a man!",
      "I'll have you beaten!!\"",
      "Zeus nuzzles his face into the crook of Ganymede's neck, delighting in the breathy noise this produces.",
      "\"You don't fool me!",
      "You never beat your servants, you kind and gentle soul, and I'm grateful, for it leaves you quite defenseless - \" He shifts his fingers down, teasing over Ganymede's naked body, poking a finger into his bellybutton and wiggling it, and the yells of outrage dissolve into laughter.",
      "\"Akakios, n-no, you're the ahahaHA!",
      "The w-horst!\"",
      "\"I am fond of you as well, Prince,\" Zeus leaves off, flattening his hands and rubbing them soothingly, feeling the heart race below the skin.",

    "text": "Icarus has been trying for a while to get the twins to sleep- the two-year-old, Chichima, finally drifted off about ten minutes ago, crayon still clutched in her hand, while the Octonauts sing about vampire squids on the T.V. in front of her. The infant twins,Tujuka and Odunayo, are resisting Captain Barnacles' soothing baritone. That old-school trick is starting to sound pretty good - the one where you give rum to babies to make them sleep. It's not so bad to give babies alcohol, right? Maybe a little bad - especially since they aren't even Icarus' kids - but consider: babies that are asleep. Surely that's what Mrs. Okafor would want. It's while he's wistfully thinking of this that both babies abruptly just fall asleep; no warning and no easing into it. Icarus has just enough time to barely begin panicking, thinking the babies maybe just died in his arms, when a familiar(ish) voice chimes in behind him: \"You're welcome, kiddo!\" It's a testament to how much one's reflexes change, when one Is holding two tiny sleeping babies, that Icarus doesn't leap into the air, or scream, or look for something to throw. He does flinch; then takes a deep breath and glances over his shoulder. There's Hermes - the herald god of Olympus is tucking away his little staff or rod or whatever it is, and winks at Icarus. \"Yeah, I don't usually do that so much anymore - Hypnos likes to run the show himself where he can - but you looked like you needed the break.\" \"Uh - uh, y-yeah. Yeah. I wasn't having much luck getting them to sleep. Uh. Thanks, I mean, thank you very much.\" Hermes makes an amused noise and drifts over the couch, sitting on the arm opposite Icarus. \"Did you try the rum trick?\" \"Hermes!\" Icarus is scandalized. \"Isn't that - bad? It's bad! Giving alcohol to babies is bad!\" The god shrugs. \"It's not great, but lots of stuff isn't great, and in the end you have some sleeping babies, right?\" Icarus refuses to acknowledge the idea had even crossed his mind, no matter how fleetingly. He shakes his head in disapproval. \"Babies are fragile. Alcohol would damage them! You can't just - \" he cuts himself off when he sees Hermes' grin growing wider as he watches Icarus. Trolled again. He sighs. \"Nevermind. Thank you for helping them sleep. Um. So... did you stop in just to do that...?\" \"The sun idiots sent me to fetch you - they're pretty annoyed, buddy! They said you were supposed to be home for your post-calculus pre-flower-shop break fifteen minutes ago! You are gonna be scoldedwhen you get back. Maybe spanked, if you're lucky.\" Icarus doesn't dignify that with a response. \"Yeah, well, Chloe - uh, my sister - she asked me if I could come watch Mrs. Okafor's kids for a couple hours. It was kind of a last-minute thing.\" \"Babysitting?\" \"She's - um, she's here on refugee status, so she has a lot of stuff to do. Normally one of the church volunteers helps out, but that fell through, so my sister asked me.\" \"Hmm.\" Hermes blurs slightly, and then beams at Icarus. \"Okay! I told them you'll be back later.\" Icarus blinks. \"You -you just...?\" Hermes leans over and tweaks Icarus' nose, which Icarus is unable to prevent because of the babies in his arms. \"Heralds gotta be fast, yo!\" Icarus rolls his eyes as Hermes leans back. \"I told 'em you were earning some extra cash escorting and you'd be a little late.\" \"Herm-!\" Icarus is about to shout, but luckily catches himself in time and whispers fiercely. \"Hermes! Did you really??!\" The trickster god smiles mysteriously. \"Mmmmmmaybe! You'll find out when you get back, I guess!\" Icarus sighs and slumps his head back against the couch. \"You're teasing me again, aren't you. They probably already know I'm here, anyway.\" \"We're not actually omnipotent,\" Hermes chides, picking up a hardboard book featuring colorful anthropomorphic animals learning a lesson about sharing, and leafing through it. \"I generally get to know where everyone is because it's my job. They can see a lot from up in the sky but it's not like they know where you are every minute.\" Thank fuck, Icarus thinks. \"Though they're definitely trying,\" Hermes adds, and sets aside the picture book. Icarus really hopes he didn't add anything inappropriate to the book. \"I think it's sweet you're helping the lady out, though,\" Hermes goes on. \"What a nice guy. You'll be a good influence on those rascals.\" \"Uhh - I guess.\" Icarus looks down at the babies. \"It's just - I dunno. You kinda gotta do it,you know? Especially if there's kids. Their whole lives got uprooted. And they didn't do anything to deserve it...\" Icarus trails off. Hermes' face has changed, somehow. It's subtle. The smile is still there, but it looks... distant, and faintly sad. \"Right. It's just something we gotta do, isn't it?\" Icarus feels a little spooked by this sudden shift in mood. \"Uh... yeah. Like I said. The kids especially.\" Hermes nods, expression still inscrutable. \"The kids especially.\" The god suddenly lifts off the couch and stretches enormously, breaking the tension. \"Welp, those two have been pestering me nonstop ever since I told them you were gonna be late because you were worshipping at a temple to Thor and Odin... guess I ought to go throw them a bone; keep them busy!\" \"I thought you told them I was a male escort tonight,\" Icarus says flatly. Hermes winks again. \"I told them a lot of exciting things. I gotta think of another one before I go back.\" \"Or, you could just tell them I'm babysitting a few kids and I'll be back in probably an hour?\" Hermes scoffs. \"Yeah,if I wanted to be boring! Why say the truth when I could tell them you're taking classes to be a clown, or getting married - ooh, that's a good one! You'll see later which ones I go with.\" And before Icarus can object further, the god blurs and is gone. Over the course of the final hour of babysitting, Icarus finds piles of coins and bills in unexpected locations, as well as a replenished drawer of diaper supplies and a few bottles of milk with \"Apollo Dairy Cows\" printed on the label. Oh, and a bottle of rum in Icarus' satchel, with a note saying \"for the biggest baby. Cheers from your pal Hermes (and Dionysus (but don't tell him you got this))\". It's weird how so many kind favors can give Icarus such a headache.",

    "text": "'Why Canada' is a question that comes up from time to time. \"Why not Canada?\" is what Hermes generally replies if the question is put to him. \"You hate Canadians or something? Got a problem with poutine and beavers?\" He made this joke in front of Icarus once, and the mortal treated all gods present (Hermes, Apollo, Helios, Artemis, and Athena) to a lecture on how Canada was far more than a collection of stereotypes about good manners and poutine and beavers. He undermined his righteous speech a little, by being super-polite the whole way through and even apologizing twice, but no one would dream of pointing it out. In truth, they were a bit pleased to see it. \"It's like the old days,\" they commented to each other afterwards, privately. \"Taking pride in the national identity. Just, instead of being from Athens, now, he's from Canada.\"... but why Canada? ------------ Other times, Hermes lets people assume it was a joke on his part. Just to force the sun gods to play this out in a cold, continental location, where they don't get unlimited wonderful weather to strut around half-clothed in; and a tragically strong limit on the amount of public nudity they'll ever get away with. And it's true that watching Apollo and Helios nobly attempt to pretend that they don't utterly hate the length and intensity of a Canadian winter... is pretty goddamn hilarious. But the truth is, Hermes has no idea. His only (legitimate) connection to the Underworld, is carrying souls there after they've died. He has no role in their governance after they leave Styx's shore, drifting along on Charon's boat. And he certainly had no (legitimate) reason to know how the reincarnation process works. That knowledge lies with the gods of the Underworld. Once, when Icarus is ten years old and Hermes deems it's been long enough that he could risk asking, he visits Persephone and brings up the question because honestly, he's curious too. \"It's just kind of an off-the-wall choice, isn't it? Why'd you send him there?\" Persephone actually dropped the copy of the Chicken Fancy magazine that he'd delivered to her, and looked up to fix upon Hermes the most ball-shriveling glare he's ever seen. \"Are you seriously. You're standing here asking me about our reincarnation policies. After you broke into the office and stole this guy's paperwork and soul and initiated it yourself?! You ballsy little shit, you're asking me about the consequences of your little stunt - \" So, it seems that the reasons behind Canadian!Icarus will stay a mystery forever. ------------- The gods really do keep up on modern trends, though sometimes they like to play the part of the confused immortal who doesn't 'get' how to use a credit card or drive a car. They do it a little with Icarus, though he's starting to catch on. It's one of Hermes' favorite jokes, in fact, when he chooses to reveal himself to a human: he acts out the \"born sexy yesterday\" trope, trolling the poor idiot along for a while... though, he secretly finds it charming, sometimes, how earnestly a person will explain their favorite snacks or television shows, when they think they're talking to a blank slate. But the thing is, no god needs to have it explained what a Swiss cake roll is. There are times when the gods choose to ignore some new facet of humanity that they don't care for - you will never convince Ares to dab, no matter how hard you try. Hermes can attest to this. But he knows what dabbing is, at least peripherally. They don't live in an ivory tower in Olympus. And even if they wanted to, Hermes and Artemis and the Erotes and Athena and Hephaestus Ganymede and Hebe and even Alcides tend to enthusiastically force everyone else to follow along anyway. So they're familiar with Canada Day. Apollo did remark upon the fact that humans' identities used to be far smaller-scale. A human used to consider themself an \"Athenian\" or a \"Spartan\"... or one of the numerous other smaller tribes, from Crete, Thrace, Macedonia... almost never would they have thought of themselves as \"Greek\" or \"Hellenic.\" A human living in one of these societies knew nearly every other individual within that identity. And Icarus, who is not normally particularly patriotic, feels compelled to explain to these \"sexy immortals born yesterday,\" about how people often still identify more with their smaller regions - school or city sport teams are huge; and often people feel closer identified with personal traits like hobbies or sexual orientation, over geographical ones. But when there's such a huge, enormous swath of territory that encompasses all of these mini-identities, a big day to remind everyone that we're all Canadians at heart and if we're cut we bleed maple syrup, is useful to keep such a huge, heterogenous group unified. This is essentially the purpose of the original Olympic Games - the gods were present, and in fact inspired the Olympics, so they don't really need the concept explained to them. But it's sweet to see a little enthusiasm perk up Icarus' ordinarily blank face as he explains to the gods what it means to be Canadian. It's part of human nature. Hermes remembers watching Homer tell the Iliad, and every time, the listeners cheered whenever they heard their polis named in that enormous list of every ship that arrived at Troy. Just enough to hear the name was enough to inspire proud cheers. Even a little before that, when Aesop had told his tales, and he'd say \"once there was a fox from Crete\" - or \"a goose from Athens\" - just so the Cretans or Athenians listening could get a little thrill out of it. Icarus thinks of himself as a student; as a brother; as gay... Canadian rarely figures too strongly. And yet, when the cheer goes up - So Hermes thinks it would be a nice gesture if the gods celebrated with him. He just muses aloud, once, in the presence of the sun gods, that the kid seems to be proud of being Canadian... it's as good as done. ----------------- Poutine: provided by Demeter. Hockey paraphernalia: provided by Hermes. Beer: provided by Dionysus. Two bemused beavers, who waddle around eating things they shouldn't: provided by Artemis. Maple syrup candies: provided by a dryad of the sugar maples. (\"Is that... hygienic?\" Icarus will ask later. \"You've been eating lots of nymph byproducts your entire life,\" they point out, providing a list of some popular ones featuring in Icarus' pantry. Icarus makes the face he always makes when he realizes the world around him is more organic and aware than he thought) They're all wearing a lot of red with white trim and a lot of maple leaves and flannel (save for Ares, who they wheedled, bribed and threatened into wearing a Mountie uniform). And Apollo sings the first few bars of O Canada, while the rest of them raise their glasses of Molson and Labatt Blue and Moosehead Lager and join in, as Icarus steps off the motorcycle from behind Helios and looks at them all in confusion. When they finish, he claps, awkward as ever, and accepts the glass of Molson that Dionysus presses into his hand and allows Helios to jam a beanie with moose antlers sticking out from the sides onto his head. They watch him expectantly. He watches them in awkward silence, and finally clears his throat. \"So, uh... Happy Canada Day, eh?\" The gods all cheer, raising their glasses again, and Icarus has that small smile he gets when he doesn't want to show how pleased he is, and settles in for a long afternoon of hoser jokes and karaoke featuring exclusively Canadian singers. ---------------- Later, Artemis announces it's time for moose racing, and everyone notes that it took six beers for Icarus to be drunk enough that this seems like a great idea. He leads the charge himself towards where he imagines the race grounds are: staggering comically, face red and grinning hugely.",

    "text": "Dionysus meets Icarus for the \"first\" time, some months after the sun gods have elbowed their way into the mortal's life. Dionysus has just enough good sense and self-preservation to keep to himself, the fact that he's actually met Icarus a handful of times previously, and even got a hug out of one encounter. The true first time was uneventful, and not in person - as the benefactor god who provided humanity with the gift of alcohol, Dionysus is metaphysically present whenever a mortal has his or her first drink. In Canada, there's a law set that dictates nodrinks will be drunk until the age of 18; he sees a lot of mortals for thefirst time around that age. But like so many other teenagers through the years, Icarus is lawlessly inducted into Dionysus' realm before then - at the age of 16, with his older sisters Ilene and Alessa to guide him. It's not Dionysus' preferred gig: he enjoys the wild chaos of a group of friends encouraging the new initiate into doing something stupid and embarrassing. Something that will make a fond, sheepish memory years down the road. There's an element of danger to this approach, yes; but Dionysus has always believed that life is full of risks worth taking. Most of his cults were centered around of concept of mystery, danger, and madness. And yet, especially in later years when he's had less to prove, he supports even those who only cautiously dip a toe into hisrealm. His gift was to all of humanity; not just the reckless and fearless souls like Dionysus himself! So he metaphysically watches, in amusement, as Icarus chokes down a cheap beer provided by Ilene's boyfriend (the designated driver), and some light acoustic rock plays on the car radio. He doesn't really remember it for a while. It's difficult to hold onto the details of something presided over metaphysically - the gods aren't so much actively participating as they are lending their presence and support to a situation. They can remember everything, of course, but the details of a metaphysical event are tougher to hold onto and take a while to retrieve. Plus, as previously explained, Icarus' first alcoholic beverage drinking was dull by Dionysus' standards. So he doesn't immediately realize it's Icarus he approaches, in person, at a party in a university a few years later. About a year and a half before he\"officially\" meets the mortal. Icarus is a freshman at this point, without a lot of friends yet - this is an informal party, held by the university's LGBT club at one of the houses a few of them rent together. Icarus is clutching a beer anxiously and looking as though he wished he never came. Enter Dionysus - or rather, 'Denis,' (though, given his androgynous good looks and effeminate behaviors, he's been routinely called'Denise,' which pleases him as well). Dionysus and Apollo, and the Muses, the Graces, and his disguised Satyrs, all tend to do the rounds at random university parties across the globe, inspiring a festive spirit and good music. Dionysus has elected to attend this particular celebration solo and in person, wanting to enjoy a party thrown with open pride by members of his other favorite community. He's started the evening dressed a little more wildly - lots of glitter, lots of skintight clothes, makeup that probably tips the balance between \"sexy\" and \"trashy.\" Just the way he likes it. And he's having a blast, flirting and drinking and singing and dancing and collecting phone numbers he might follow up on. After a while, he notices poor Icarus in his corner, watching the noisier partiersunhappily. A shy one, not very experienced at drinking, looking paralyzed by all the rowdy noise and vice. Bless his heart, he's wearing a nice button-down shirt tucked into clean slacks, like he was going to a job interview or maybe to take his grandmother to church. Whatever party he was imagining, he is definitely at the wrong one. There are certainly more sedate and sober LGBT-themed gatherings that will happen in his university, but this is not one of them. Whoever brought him here seems to have deserted him, and the house is remote enough that it wouldn't be easy to walk back home. Most of the attendees are planning to passout in various corners around the property anyway. Poor kid, whoever he is. Well, Denis/Denise might be here for a good time, but Dionysus is on the job - he's here to ensure that a good time is had by all, and that the good word of his gift to humanity reaches all ears. Or all - brains, or bloodstreams, or whatever gets affected first. So he hops down off the table where he was dancing, turning to kiss the guy he was flirting with, and discreetly steps out of the way to change his appearance. He's still physically the same person, but presented far more blandly, which will hopefully be less intimidating: jeans (though he takes a moment to ensure they make his ass look good), and a plain purple T-shirt with a small pattern of grape leaves on the hems. He leaves his piercings in and his mascara on, though - may as well give the kid a tiny bad-boy thrill, right? He ignores the beers sitting in tubs of ice around theplace, and creates a couple of cans of an alcohol that these college kids certainly couldn't afford. It's sweet and mild-tasting, but fairly potent. \"You're drinking that cheap crap? Gross!\" Dionysus, who has never met an alcohol he doesn't like, greets Icarus. Icarus blinks at him. \"What?!\" he asks loudly. Yeah, this party is pretty lit. Dionysus leans over and raises his voice. \"They got a patio out back, you know? It's quieter there!\" \"Oh...?\" Icarus looks like he still might not have heard him, but is nodding anyway. What a little dork. He is absolutely out of place in this party. Dionysus smiles winningly at him and lightly places a hand on Icarus' back, steering him towards the patio, and Icarus finally gets the idea. The physical contact is enough to jog Dionysus' memory, reminding him who Icarus, in fact, is: that kid from a few years ago, drinking a weak beer with his sisters. A nerd; a square. Cute kid but shy as fuck. Dionysus feels a renewed sense of purpose: he'll make sure this Icarus kid enjoys his drinks, enjoys the party, and maybe even blushes prettily for Dionysus. Outside is quieter by a great deal. The semirural setting is rather pretty, though the property is a little worn-down. There's a pond that looks like it hasn't had any maintenance or cleaning done to it in years; a nice stand of pine trees off the side of the patio(l (auspicious!); a ramshackle barn/shed. Most of the partygoers who wandered outside have gone to the square of pavement in front of the barn/shed and are noisily playing some kind of game there. Dionysus sets a handful of wards in place, in case anyone should wander over; mental suggestions that trigger upon approach to the patio, that the patio is no fun and they should go back tothe barn or inside the house. \"Whew! So noisy in there I can barely think!\" Dionysus complains, mostly for Icarus' benefit. Icarus does a cute, nervous-sounding laugh. \"Y-yeah. I uh, I never understood how anyone can have any fun if they can't even hear what's going on!\" Ah, Icarus, Icarus. You can hear everything you needto hear. The pulse of the music - the bass thumping. Sound so loud it buzzes your bones. The dizzy, thrilling whirl of colors and motion, unlimited by sober analysis. Feeling the wild call of madness, and daring to dance close enough to touch it, not at all sure you'll come back - or if you even want to. All the rules and restrictions of daily life are gone. You can ignore hierarchy; you can ignore the roles you have to fill in society and just be. Speech is of no use here; only chaos, and little of it will remain in your memory. Dionysus loves it. But, baby steps, for some people. Dionysus sinks into an ancient plastic lawnchair, which creaks alarmingly but holds his weight. \"Yeah, I hear ya. It's not much good for socializing, isit? Name's Denis, by the way.\" He offers Icarus the can. Icarus takes it and inspects it curiously: the can's name says \"KaleStigmes,\" which is an improvisation from Dionysus. It's not actually a drink that exists for most mortals - he serves it at his own parties. Silenus was the one who came up with it, because as he said, 'all that other shit's good for a party, but sometimes an old satyr wants something sweet to sip before bed.' Dionysus' retinue only refers to it as Silenus' Nightcap. It tends to taste like a light memory of your favorite dessert, but potent enough to - well, to put Silenus to sleep after a few. Icarus is getting the cans, though, not the jugs Silenus prefers. \"I guess it makes me a snob, but I like this stuff better. Nicer to just sit around and sip.\" Icarus perks up a little, taking the chair next to Dionysusand opening the can. \"Thanks! I'm Icarus, uh - nice to meet you!\" He actually offers his hand to shake. Dionysus feels his heart melt a little and shakes the kid's hand. \"Pleasure to meet you, darling,\" he says with a wink. Icarus blinks in surprise, then colors faintly. Not quite there yet, but Dionysus is pleased to see he's relaxing a bit. He leans back in his chair and sips his own Silenus' Nightcap. \"So - I've been making the rounds on these parties for a while now... you're a new face. Must be a freshman?\" Icarus takes a cautious sip. His eyebrows raise, and he licks his lips absently. \"Yeah. Um. I guess... I guess it's obvious, huh.\" Dionysus watches a few mortals approach the patio, then turn off in different directions with vaguely confused expressions. \"You looked a little lost.\" Icarus tries more. At the moment, he looks a little glum more than anything else. \"I wanted to get out of the dorms for a change... not just for class or work or whatever. I saw a poster in the day room... guess I should have looked into it. The one guy I knew, from my calculus class, I guess he took off somewhere.. I dunno.\" \"He a friend of yours?\" Dionysus really disapproves of ditching friends at parties. If they've agreed to split up and check things out separately, that's a different story; but ditching a friend - especially such a newbie - is a real dick move. \"Nah. Just... just a guy I knew from class.\" Icarus downs the rest of his can, which was... inadvisable. Or completely advisable, if you ask Dionysus. That's gonna go straight to his head. Icarus slumps a little in his chair. \"That's what this was supposed to be,\" he says, quietly. \"Meeting new friends.\" Dionysus leans over to clink his can against Icarus', rescuing the mood before it turns to self-pity... that's a hard hole to dig out of when you're drinking. \"Well, you're off to a good start! One down! Add Denis to your little black book!\" Icarus laughs a little and raises his empty can to Dionysus. \"Glad I met at least one other quiet guy here!\" he says, incorrectly. He looks at his can sheepishly. \"So, uh... is there any more of this?\" --------------------- After two cans, Icarus is far enough along to be talked into comparing the hotties at the party - he rates them all generously and points out the best feature of each entrant. \"How would you rate me?\" Dionysus asks, dying to hear. \"Hmmmmmmmmm,\" Icarus is wobbling just slightly, and puts his hand to his chin in serious consideration. \"Well, you... you fill a lot of categories. Like, you're soooooo pretty, Denis, your face is so pretty! And you have... really nice hair? And your makeup is pretty good too. And your butt - uh! I mean!!\" He waves his hands frantically, face reddening in a brief moment of clarity that he's saying more than he normally would. \"Ohhh?\" Dionysus leers mischievously. Icarus hides his face in one hand, waving with the other as though to dismiss the embarrassing confession. Ouranos' balls, this kid. \"F-forget that. It's just fine is all! Ummm honestly I'll give you a 9/10 just for wearing normal clothes though. It's such a fucking relief not to be the only one here who's not like...doing the BDSM glitter orgy look.\" A BDSM glitter orgy sounds delightful, but Dionysus has to ask: \"Do you even know what BDSM is, you sweet summer child?\" Icarus only starts giggling uncontrollably and tries to distract by asking for another drink. ---------------------- After the third can, Icarus is coaxed into dancing with Dionysus inside. He's terrible. Icarus, that is; Dionysus is a fine dancer. Icarus is lucky he won't remember this tomorrow. Dionysus dares him to give a smooch to an attractive young man who's been giving kisses in exchange for drinks all night. Icarus dithers, still shy even under the influence, then finally darts over to press a beer into the guy's hand and give him an adorably chaste kiss on the cheek before fleeing back to Dionysus, who's laughing in the corner and cheers his return. He's talked into playing a drinking game with some other partiers and loses, badly - that's the fourth can, and he's starting to stagger. Dionysus finds a bottle of water and wraps an arm around Icarus, leading him back outside. In the length of time it takes to get there, Icarus has told Dionysus that he's scared of heights and the ocean; that he loves strawberry shortcake above all else; that he's really ticklish on his sides; that he kind of likes guys with longhair. Dionysus cannot overstate how pleased he is with the outcome of the evening. He grins as he half-leads, half-carries Icarus outside. \"Heyyyy, wait a minute. I have long hair!\" he teases. Icarus is laughing again. He's been laughing almost nonstop for the last half hour or so. \"Well. Wellllll, I guess you do! Long and sooooooo pretty.\" Dionysus laughs too. \"Ahh, kid, if only I could take you home for the night.\" Icarus beams up at him drunkenly. \"Huh?\" \"But I can't. Because you -\" he boops Icarus' nose \"- are capernoited\" \"Whaaaaat? Capper-cap - that's not even, not, not even real. A real word!\" \"Is so! You, dear boy, are capernoited. Inebriated. Blotto. Soused. Tipsy. Just a liiiiiitle bit drunk.\" Dionysus punctuates each word with a light poke to Icarus' sides; which sends him into fits of giggles. \"Nnnnno way,\" he says, laughing and throwing his arms around Dionysus again. \"Listen. Listen. I'm not. I'm - I never, never get drunk.\" \"I can tell,\" Dionysus says, amused. \"No no, I mean. Imean. No, I mean I really, I never. Never get drunk. So. So my liver is like, it's fresh, you know? It can handle anything. So I'm totally not drunk yet.\" \"Ahh, that's not how it works, darling.\" Dionysus pats Icarus' back from where the kid's hugging him tight. Damn, he's like an octopus when he's had a couple drinks in him! \"You'll see! Wait till - till - the end of the party. You'll be the kippernitted one.\" \"Well, you may be right,\" Dionysus says, \"I often am.\" He observes with mild curiosity as Icarus attempts to adjust his legs so that - ah, he's climbing into Dionysus' lap. He obligingly helps, and smiles at the look of drunken, bold pride on the kid's face. \"You're quite a handful when you're capernoited, you know that? Just four drinks, that's all it took to bring out this handsy little cutie.\" He does wish he could bring Icarus home. Well, 'home,' where Ariadne and the rest of his retinue are, which could be anywhere. Dionysus indulges himself briefly in a dirty little fantasy, involving himself, Ariadne and this sweet young mortal. Between the two of them, they could probably blow this kid's mind. It's tempting. There are some mortals - probably at least a couple at this very party - who want nothing more than a fun night and a crazy half-memory of something wild, hopefully including sex. But, capernoited antics notwithstanding,Icarus is definitely not one of them. A drunken, wild night of sex with a total stranger (and said stranger's wife) would traumatize him for certain. He needs to get this drunk with someone he already knows and trusts; that would bethe best avenue for Icarus' wild side. So he gently detaches Icarus' hands from where they're latched onto Dionysus' shirt. \"I mean it though, kiddo. Not when you're this drunk. You'll feel like shit about it tomorrow.\" \"But you're so hot,\" Icarus mumbles, eyes half-closed. Whew, he'sfurther along than Dionysus realized. \"Thank you, sweetie; so are you. And I'll still be hot tomorrow if you're still interested. We can thinkabout it then,\" Dionysus says, knowing perfectly well that he's likely to never see Icarus again. \"How about. How about. A smooch? Nothing wrong with that?\" Icarus manages, smiling hopefully up at Dionysus, eyes glazed and unfocused. Dionysus sighs indulgently. \"How can I say no to a face like that? One smooch!\" He leans in and gives Icarus a good one, holding up his phone to take a pic to commemorate it. He airdrops it into Icarus' phone, something for him to be shocked and embarrassed and wonder about tomorrow. \"Now then. Before we both get too - ah.\" Icarus is slumped against his shoulder almost immediately, dead asleep. Dionysus tsks and sends a text. Hermes arrives seconds later. \"Ooohh, looky here!\" he exclaims,circling around with impish glee. \"Wore him out? I knew your wicked ways would rear up again on party night!\" Dionysus tut-tuts at him. \"This poor little lightweight passed out on his own. I only got a smooch out of it.\" \"Oh? The kiss was enough to knock him out?\" \"Well, with the help of Silenus' Nightcap,\" Dionysus amends, standing up and lifting the conked-out Icarus with him. \"He needed a bit of liquid courage before he could enjoy the party properly.\" \"Aww. Mentoring the nerds. Just like back in the day with Heph. You're such a philanthropist.\" \"When duty becomes pleasure,\" Dionysussays. \"Anyway, you mind taking him back to his place? Dunno where it is. He got ditched here.\" \"Yeah, sure,\" Hermes replies, distracted. He's uncapped a marker that he produced from somewhere, and has placed his fingers under Icarus' chin, tilting the kid's face back to draw a mustache or a dick or something - and then draws back, startled. \"Oh, shit! You definitely didn't do more than kiss, right?\" \"Right... why?\" Dionysus rolls his eyes. \"You're telling me he belongs to someone already? If he does, whoever it is should be more attentive. A sweet cutie like this doesn't deserve to be abandoned at a party!\" \"Not yet. Stand by another couple months... the Sun Gods are about to take an interest.\" Hermes carries on drawing on Icarus' face - this time a sun and a heart. What a sap - ah, okay, there's the dick drawing. Dionysus makes a face. \"Bleh. Good thing I didn't, then. I don't wanna be within a hundred yards of those two seducing someone.\" He hesitates, looking down at the sleeping Icarus. \"...Hope he survives it.\" \"Ah, he'll be fine. I think they're different, now.\" \"Guess you'd know better than me. Anyway, if you have time after you drop him off, come on back! This place is lit! And I'm gonna pick up my Denis act where I left off.\" \"Ooh, I don't want to miss out on Denis! All right, see you in aminute!\" Hermes winks, hoisting Icarus carefully in his arms, and vanishes. Dionysus' conservative clothes are gone, replaced by the raciest outfit he can think of off the fly - this interlude with the sweet Icarus was fun, but he's anxious to make up for lost time on the drinking scene. ----------------- Icarus wakes up the next day, thirsty and hungover in his own bed, still wearing his clothes. There's a receipt on his nightstand, from 'Mercury Cabs' - he doesn't recognize the signature. On the back is a note, barely legible, something about hoping he feels better, and call me sometime! There's a number he can't read, and the whole thing is signed 'Denis.' Denis... he has only faint memories and a few startling photos on his phone. He gets a glass of water and transfers the photos to his computer and marvels over them - here's Icarus dancing; here's Icarus playing some kind of card game with a small group of equally drunk-looking people cheering his hand; here's Icarus kissing a very handsome young man, both of them sort-of smiling at the camera around each other's lips. This guy - it has to be Denis -is in a few pictures. Icarus thinks he remembers, faintly, talking to the guy outside somewhere. Seems like they had fun. Too bad he can't remember. Still, Icarus is pleased. He went outside his comfort zone briefly, and ended up having a good time in spite of all his doubts. Maybe he'll even do it again sometime! He goes to take a shower, because he reeks, and groans when he spots the sun, the heart, and the dick on his face in marker. ------------------------------- About a year and a half later, Icarus has nearly forgotten that one wild party, and nearly forgotten Denis and the smooch photo. Imagine his surprise, then, when he meets a Greek god introducing himself as Dionysus, immediately familiar to Icarus and grinning at him with the same mouth that had been planted on Icarus' own all that time ago. Dionysus winks and puts a finger to his lips before exclaiming over how nice it is to finally meet the guy he's heard so much about.",

      "Listen.",
      "I'm not.",

      "\"No no, I mean.",
      "Imean.",
      "No, I mean I really, I never.",
      "Never get drunk.",
      "So.",
      "So my liver is like, it's fresh, you know?",
      "It can handle anything.",
      "So I'm totally not drunk yet.\"",
      "\"Ahh, that's not how it works, darling.\"",
      "Dionysus pats Icarus' back from where the kid's hugging him tight.",
      "Damn, he's like an octopus when he's had a couple drinks in him!",
      "\"You'll see!",
      "Wait till - till - the end of the party.",
      "You'll be the kippernitted one.\"",
      "\"Well, you may be right,\" Dionysus says, \"I often am.\"",
      "He observes with mild curiosity as Icarus attempts to adjust his legs so that - ah, he's climbing into Dionysus' lap.",
      "He obligingly helps, and smiles at the look of drunken, bold pride on the kid's face.",
      "\"You're quite a handful when you're capernoited, you know that?",
      "Just four drinks, that's all it took to bring out this handsy little cutie.\"",
      "He does wish he could bring Icarus home.",
      "Well, 'home,' where Ariadne and the rest of his retinue are, which could be anywhere.",
      "Dionysus indulges himself briefly in a dirty little fantasy, involving himself, Ariadne and this sweet young mortal.",
      "Between the two of them, they could probably blow this kid's mind.",
      "It's tempting.",
      "There are some mortals - probably at least a couple at this very party - who want nothing more than a fun night and a crazy half-memory of something wild, hopefully including sex.",
      "But, capernoited antics notwithstanding,Icarus is definitely not one of them.",
      "A drunken, wild night of sex with a total stranger (and said stranger's wife) would traumatize him for certain.",
      "He needs to get this drunk with someone he already knows and trusts; that would bethe best avenue for Icarus' wild side.",
      "So he gently detaches Icarus' hands from where they're latched onto Dionysus' shirt.",
      "\"I mean it though, kiddo.",
      "Not when you're this drunk.",
      "You'll feel like shit about it tomorrow.\"",

      "\"Thank you, sweetie; so are you.",
      "And I'll still be hot tomorrow if you're still interested.",
      "We can thinkabout it then,\" Dionysus says, knowing perfectly well that he's likely to never see Icarus again.",
      "\"How about.",
      "How about.",
      "A smooch?",
      "Nothing wrong with that?\"",

      "Dionysus sighs indulgently.",

      "One smooch!\"",
      "He leans in and gives Icarus a good one, holding up his phone to take a pic to commemorate it.",
      "He airdrops it into Icarus' phone, something for him to be shocked and embarrassed and wonder about tomorrow.",
      "\"Now then.",
      "Before we both get too - ah.\"",
      "Icarus is slumped against his shoulder almost immediately, dead asleep.",
      "Dionysus tsks and sends a text.",

      "Dionysus tut-tuts at him.",
      "\"This poor little lightweight passed out on his own.",
      "I only got a smooch out of it.\"",
      "\"Oh?",
      "The kiss was enough to knock him out?\"",
      "\"Well, with the help of Silenus' Nightcap,\" Dionysus amends, standing up and lifting the conked-out Icarus with him.",
      "\"He needed a bit of liquid courage before he could enjoy the party properly.\"",
      "\"Aww.",
      "Mentoring the nerds.",
      "Just like back in the day with Heph.",
      "You're such a philanthropist.\"",
      "\"When duty becomes pleasure,\" Dionysussays.",
      "\"Anyway, you mind taking him back to his place?",
      "Dunno where it is.",
      "He got ditched here.\"",
      "\"Yeah, sure,\" Hermes replies, distracted.",
      "He's uncapped a marker that he produced from somewhere, and has placed his fingers under Icarus' chin, tilting the kid's face back to draw a mustache or a dick or something - and then draws back, startled.",
      "\"Oh, shit!",
      "You definitely didn't do more than kiss, right?\" \"Right... why?\" Dionysus rolls his eyes.",
      "\"You're telling me he belongs to someone already?",
      "If he does, whoever it is should be more attentive.",
      "A sweet cutie like this doesn't deserve to be abandoned at a party!\"",
      "\"Not yet.",
      "Stand by another couple months...",
      "the Sun Gods are about to take an interest.\"",
      "Hermes carries on drawing on Icarus' face - this time a sun and a heart.",
      "What a sap - ah, okay, there's the dick drawing.",
      "Dionysus makes a face.",
      "\"Bleh.",
      "Good thing I didn't, then.",
      "I don't wanna be within a hundred yards of those two seducing someone.\"",
      "He hesitates, looking down at the sleeping Icarus.",
      "\"...Hope he survives it.\"",
      "\"Ah, he'll be fine.",
      "I think they're different, now.\"",
      "\"Guess you'd know better than me.",
      "Anyway, if you have time after you drop him off, come on back!",
      "This place is lit!",
      "And I'm gonna pick up my Denis act where I left off.\"",
      "\"Ooh, I don't want to miss out on Denis!",
      "All right, see you in aminute!\"",
      "Hermes winks, hoisting Icarus carefully in his arms, and vanishes.",
      "Dionysus' conservative clothes are gone, replaced by the raciest outfit he can think of off the fly - this interlude with the sweet Icarus was fun, but he's anxious to make up for lost time on the drinking scene.",
      "----------------- Icarus wakes up the next day, thirsty and hungover in his own bed, still wearing his clothes.",
      "There's a receipt on his nightstand, from 'Mercury Cabs' - he doesn't recognize the signature.",
      "On the back is a note, barely legible, something about hoping he feels better, and call me sometime!",
      "There's a number he can't read, and the whole thing is signed 'Denis.'",
      "Denis... he has only faint memories and a few startling photos on his phone.",
      "He gets a glass of water and transfers the photos to his computer and marvels over them - here's Icarus dancing; here's Icarus playing some kind of card game with a small group of equally drunk-looking people cheering his hand; here's Icarus kissing a very handsome young man, both of them sort-of smiling at the camera around each other's lips.",
      "This guy - it has to be Denis -is in a few pictures.",
      "Icarus thinks he remembers, faintly, talking to the guy outside somewhere.",
      "Seems like they had fun.",
      "Too bad he can't remember.",
      "Still, Icarus is pleased.",
      "He went outside his comfort zone briefly, and ended up having a good time in spite of all his doubts.",
      "Maybe he'll even do it again sometime!",
      "He goes to take a shower, because he reeks, and groans when he spots the sun, the heart, and the dick on his face in marker.",
      "------------------------------- About a year and a half later, Icarus has nearly forgotten that one wild party, and nearly forgotten Denis and the smooch photo.",
      "Imagine his surprise, then, when he meets a Greek god introducing himself as Dionysus, immediately familiar to Icarus and grinning at him with the same mouth that had been planted on Icarus' own all that time ago.",
      "Dionysus winks and puts a finger to his lips before exclaiming over how nice it is to finally meet the guy he's heard so much about."

    "text": "It's still another occasion when Zeus refuses to judge between the gods and goddesses of his court; although if he HAD to choose, he'd choose Hades, same as anyone else with any sense. Though Hestia is a close second. Hades is standing there holding a non-alcoholic cider, shirtless with some furry pants and hooved boots, and horns and with contact lenses that give his eyes a goaty appearance. He looks as though he wishes he could join the ranks of his own subjects in death. He, of course, is dressed as Pan. His wife Persephone can't stop laughing every time she even glances his way. This wasn't her idea, though she threw herself into it enthusiastically. All participating gods and goddesses put their names into Ares' helmet and drew out slips of paper; whoever's name they drew, was their costume for the party. This would have been a disastrous idea about 2500 years ago; but they've all come a long way since then, and the light-hearted lampooning is a big hit. Hades drew Pan, and is the hit of the party. Persephone herself is Hermes, which was an easy costume - she just selected the ugliest, gaudiest clothes available to her and borrowed his hat. Hermes is dressed as Ares, opting to go with his \"classic\" look and swaggering around in a scandalously short chiton and scarlet cloak and helmet, flexing his muscles every chance he gets. Ares drew Aphrodite and has been glowering at everyone in the corner for a while, refusing to be drawn into the party. He's wearing a skimpy dress and Aphrodite did his hair and makeup for full effect, but he's almost crippled with embarrassment at wearing such a glamorously sexy outfit and his glare forbids commentary or photos (though there's no question Hermes has been getting photos somehow). Aphrodite is wearing huge nerd glasses with tape in the frame, and high-waisted pants with a button-down shirt and a button that says \"I went to University in Boston.\" Although Athena has never worn this particular outfit ever, in her life, everyone present immediately recognizes the costume. Even Athena herself, who protests hotly. Athena drew Dionysus and is standing with her arms folded, trying and failing to look natural in her leopard-skin one-piece while a grape-leaf circlet adorns her hair. Dionysus drew Hephaestus and to no one's surprise, had turned it into a sexy!Hephaestus costume, which is mostly steampunk-themed and features a shirt unbuttoned halfway down his chest. Hephaestus says he's just relieved Dionysus didn't follow through on his first threat, to wear a smith's apron and nothing else. Hephaestus is blushing furiously in the same corner as his equally-embarrassed brother Ares. The smith-god is Apollo, wearing one of his sexier drapes. The brothers are drinking more than anyone else at the party. Apollo drew Hades' name and did his best to make boring black robes look flashy and interesting. Helios and Demeter drew each other's names and have been ragging on each other all night, with Helios wearing a giant granola box and Demeter wearing a frog suit. Artemis is dressed as Poseidon, and was one of the few to actually do a nice job with her costume - but, notably, she doesn't look much like Poseidon so much as she looks like one of the Okeanids. A fearsome and lovely sea-goddess. Hestia came swaggering into the party dressed as Artemis - wearing a crop-top and short chiton, with her hair teased wild and piled back with a headband. She's gone in-character, cursing and challenging everyone to arm-wrestling and teasing her \"brother\" Hephaestus. The whole idea is a big hit. Even Zeus has to admit it, though he probably drew the most dangerous name of all. He made Hestia double-approve his outfit before he wore it out to the party, and the fact that the entire evening went off without any explosions or forcible shapeshifting, means that his peacock-printed gown and elegant lotus earrings must look pretty good. Although they've changed in tone and purpose over the millennia, the old holidays are still being celebrated in some fashion or other, and this pleases the gods. They all have their favorite events - you haven't lived until you see Zeus dress up as Father Christmas and surprise a few happy children here and there in December, for example; and Demeter is REALLY caught up in Groundhog's Day. As for Halloween - they all love it. It's not much like the old festivals of the dead. ANY festival was an occasion for dancing and drinking, of course, but there was a certain solemnity to them nonetheless that is mostly missing from the modern Halloween, as it's celebrated in Icarus' city. Four gods in particular are the most connected to celebrations of the dead. Persephone, the Queen of the Realm of the Dead, can occasionally be seen lamenting to Thanatos, the embodiment of Death, about the lack of solemnity; although she enjoys the parties, she misses the awed respect. (Hades, King of the Realm of the Dead, doesn't notice these things and possibly didn't notice the festivals back in the old days) The fourth god is the Psychopomp. Who is currently having the time of his life chasing after a flock of teenagers, wielding his chainsaw and bellowing. Hermes won't commit to saying whether the modern interpretation of death is better or worse - but as a psychopomp, he does feel that it's important to let the mortals deal with this great and terrible transition however they see fit. If they see death as something to fear, and ritually confront and purge their fears each year... well, Hermes has his doubts about how healthy that might be, but it's not him that has to die someday, after all. So he chases the teenagers around the corn maze and terrorizes them and of course, lets them get away with their lives intact, having survived another controlled threat. A few rows away (behind a sound barrier - only the teenagers hear the roaring and the chainsaw), Ares is wearing a friendly ghost costume and guiding a set of much-younger children towards the hidden treat stashes scattered among the rows. Hermes invited him here because he could see that the embarrassment was starting to get to Ares, so they left the party and are out fulfilling one of Hermes' \"duties\" as a pastoral god. Namely, chasing after rural carnival attendees in the corn mazes and haunted houses. Ares, who likes kids but doesn't often get the chance to interact with them, got distracted in helping out the younger set; but Hermes doesn't object. Just leaves more teenagers for him to terrorize. Last year, Ares himself had been one of Hermes' scare victims, but this year he has a nice surprise in store. As a matter of fact... Hermes spots what he's been watching for, at the entrance to the corn maze. He zips over to Ares, smiles at a couple kids dressed as a pumpkin, Black Panther, and a troll, and taps his half-brother on the shoulder. \"Apollo, Helios and Icarus are here,\" he says, eyes glinting with mischief. Ares scruffs the pumpkin kid on the head and sends him on his way; then waves over his sons Phobos and Deimos from where they've been hassling some other kids. \"Let's get 'em,\" he grins, cracking his knuckles. \"I suppose I can go along with it since he's already somewhat interested,\" Aphrodite decides, \"but there has to be some kind of consequence.\" Aphrodite is back in her preferred costume - a sexy pirate - and talking to her son Eros, who's wearing a devil costume and nodding thoughtfully. Their old worshippers never really went away, though their numbers have waxed and waned over the years. Currently they're going through another revival of sorts, which is great in some ways, since they all secretly love getting involved in human affairs. It's exciting! But while many of their modern worshippers are respectful, and often seek out the appropriate (or at least polite) ways to worship them, others...... are lacking. Half the time it's not really their fault. They're uninformed. Back in the old days, they would have been taught the correct way to do things, and there would have been priests and oracles to keep up with the way the gods and goddesses wanted things done. So the pantheon tries to be patient with their mistakes, especially if they're well-intentioned. But one thing that irritates Aphrodite greatly is being used as an ingredient in a spell. This time, it's a couple of girls at a party, who are trying to get some boys to fall in love with them. This is an iffy thing to do anyway - Aphrodite inspires love, these days, but she doesn't force it - but the most annoying part is that she wasn't asked. Apparently the girl simply called upon \"the power of Venus\" at the end of mixing her potion, without giving any thought to the idea that Venus is a powerful, ancient goddess who has agency of her own and doesn't care to be told to do anything. But, it's a teenage kid. What can you do? She doesn't know better, and she has at least some misguided faith in the entity that ought to be encouraged. So, since the boy is interested already, she will inspire a reciprocation between them... But, to remind this girl of who and what she's dealing with, she's asked Eros to pitch in with a healthy dose of \"unexpected consequence.\" \"All right,\" he says. \"I got it. They're gonna do a game later where they dress each other up as mummies; I'll give her a good bondage kink. For either direction. And there's another game where they have to try to get objects from one end of the room to the other using their feet; so a foot fetish. Um, let's see.... Oh! Can't believe I missed this one! His costume is a mad scientist, he's got some rubber gloves on, that's totally a thing...\" There's no guarantee that any of this will take. Neither Eros nor Aphrodite is in the business of forcing things, these days. But she'll inspire this boy to act upon his interests, if he's inclined. And if he does, and there's an attraction between him and the girl......the girl is going to additionally discover several heretofore-unrealized kinks that will surface with embarrassing timing and strength. With luck, she won't miss the subtlety of Aphrodite's message. The bullies have finally given up on trying to chase down their victims - just as well, since Dionysus safely transported them somewhere else around ten minutes ago. The boys were dressed up as their favorite princesses for Halloween, and predictably, were harassed by homophobic teenage bullies. As it happens, one of the two boys was gay. His best friend was just supporting him and thought Mulan was badass anyway. Both were nervous that something would probably happen to them that night, and they were almost correct; but Dionysus was nearby on this particular occasion and intervened. The boys are now hanging out in a nearby well-lighted neighborhood full of other trick-or-treaters who are mostly too concerned with their own candy hauls to worry about two boys in dresses. The bullies... are about to be firmly disciplined. Dionysus appears before them, wearing a flawless replica of Bill Skarsgard's clown costume. His appearance is abrupt and unsettling. The bullies' disappointment over losing sight of their gay victims is mostly forgotten as they first gasp at his sudden appearance... and then they begin to scoff at Dionysus. \"Nice costume, asshole. Is that supposed to be scary?\" \"There's about a hundred other stupid It-wannabes, dumbass. Fuckin' loser.\" \"You've seen this costume before?\" Dionysus asks. \"Yours is lamer.\" \"Did their costumes do this?\" He begins to pull his face apart, as in the movie, revealing the rows of razor-sharp teeth and the Deadlights deep within. Faint screams come from inside the gaping maw... And yeah, there's not a direct correlation between \"beating up gay kids\" and \"apparently actually confronting the terrifying clown monster from It\". They probably won't learn any important life lessons from this. But sometimes, it's just really fuckin' nice to watch a few homophobic assholes piss themselves and run away screaming. Demeter changes into a nice, autumn-themed jumper and a pair of boots and jeans. It took her a long time, but she's learned to enjoy fall. Poseidon meets her at the bridge overlooking the river. \"You look lovely in red and gold,\" he tells her, taking her hand and waiting for her to lean in first before returning her kiss. Poseidon's changed a lot too, since those early days. They talk for a while, leaning on the wooden railings to watch the water below. Selene's reflection is rather lovely on the dark water; Demeter will have to compliment her later. Poseidon has a bag mixed with popped corn and roasted pumpkin seeds that they share, and two thermoses of cider. The corn, the pumpkins, the apples... all were touched by her hand over the long summer, to be enjoyed now. These autumn treats wouldn't exist, if it weren't for her sorrow, all that time ago... strange, how things change. Strange to imagine celebrating the dead time of year, and yet here they are. There's a sidewalk that follows alongside the river, lit by the occasional lamp, and they go for a walk. The air is chilling quickly. Poseidon gives her his jacket, which is unnecessary, but it makes her smile anyway. They pause briefly when Poseidon stills and tilts his head. It's a familiar gesture; he's receiving a prayer that catches his notice. He looks over at her. \"It's all right if you have business you need to attend to,\" Demeter says. \"I mean... I don't have much to do, this time of year.\" \"I'd still rather not ditch my lovely date,\" he says, kissing her hand. \"You want to come with? I don't think it will take long, and you might be entertained.\" They vanish into the metaphysical realm and Poseidon guides her to the source of the prayer - and the quiet, soft autumn aesthetic vanishes in an instant as she's presented with the sight of a bunch of people shouting and running from... \"...The Kraken?!\" \"Yeah.\" Poseidon sounds amused and resigned. \"Every Halloween, at least a couple of idiots try it. Someone tries to summon an ancient monster for no particular reason that I can tell. Just to see if they can, I guess. Hades says it's worse for him.\" Demeter snorts and watches as a couple of people run into a nearby boathouse. The Kraken begins battering the door, tentacles waving wildly. \"Krakey looks excited. Must be enjoying the exercise.\" \"That's why I let these dummies get away with it. They make good toys. But anyway, I'm going to let them get terrorized a little while, then call off the Kraken before anyone gets hurt. We can go out for caramel apples and hot chocolate afterwards?\" They snuggle in together, watching the autumn leaves blow in the wind across the path, as the Kraken grabs various hubristic would-be summoners and roars. The world moves on. Children grow up and leave. Winter comes. With so much change, it's good to see that there will always be crazy dumbasses trying to fight tentacle monsters on a dare. (See the end of the chapter for notes.) Icarus' video game selections are a little dated - he hasn't really had free time to play them much since he started college. He's not sure why he picked up the controller now, either. He should be studying for his literature test next week... but instead, here he is, facing the Pyramid Man from Silent Hill, while Apollo and Helios clutch at him, tense. They still have a hard time quite grasping why mortals are so fixated on such macabre stories - for his part, Icarus has a tough time understanding how and why these immortal beings can still be so spooked by a few pixelated monsters. It's not that he minds, though. For one thing, the petty side of him finds it just a little bit rewarding to have a moment of superiority over these two. It might seem trivial, but... they're overwhelmingly more powerful than he is. They're more physically flawless than he is. They have a crucial role in the universe, while he's just another drudge. They're better at athletics, smarter, more talented......but they both freak out like kids, in the face of a spooky story. Icarus feels just a tiny bit smug. Plus, he may as well admit it's kind of nice to have them clutching at him like this. They probably would disagree, but to Icarus, it feels very domestic and fun. The three of them, sitting close together on the couch, while they hug him and gasp... Oh! A jump-scare while Icarus isn't paying attention, causes him to yell out loud and drop the controller. Helios and Apollo literally just did the same thing, and yet, because it's the first time that Icarus has shown himself to be startled too, they both cheer and pounce on him, tickling and jeering playfully, while on the TV James gets killed. Gods. Childish and petty. He makes them watch him play Amnesia next as punishment. Still feels like maybe I should have swapped the Treat with Trick #5 but oh well.",

    "text": "\"I don't understand why you eat ramen noodles and hot dogs, when you have the option of eating better from the very place where you work,\" Apollo remarks, surveying the cafe display. \"I can't afford to eat here,\" Icarus reminds him. \"Sometimes the stuff gets marked down if it's old, and I can get it that way.\" \"That other kid who works here eats the food all the time!\" Helios is leaning wayyyyyy back in a chair nearby. \"That's because Blake steals it, mostly. He likes living dangerously.\" \"But these are very nearly what we ate in the old days!\" Apollo persists, holding up the little plastic Snak Pak containers (which would cost Icarus about an hour's work to buy). \"A small assemblage of healthy foods. Yogurt, fruit, and nuts - a perfect breakfast. Or this one here - some grapes, cheese, and pretzels. A thick slice of bread would be better than the salty pretzels, but that's a quibble, really; it's still a very nearly perfect lunch. Fruit, vegetables, grain and protein. Pre-measured so you don't eat too little or too much.\" \"I bet it's not as great as you're imagining,\" Icarus suggests. \"I think this time you're being the snob,\" Apollo informs him haughtily. \"Just because it isn't loaded with sugar and MSG and other contaminants meant to extend the shelf life, doesn't mean it can't be delicious and filling.\" Icarus glances doubtfully at the brand-logo stamped on the plastic container. \"Well... I'm not arguing that point, but I don't think it applies here... anyway, it's moot. I still can't afford it.\" Helios leers. \"You know, I bet I could scrounge up a little cash, in exchange for - \" \"Nope,\" Icarus interrupts firmly. \"I'm on shift.\" \"But later - \" \"Ugh. Very well. Helios, save the lechery for later.\" Apollo slaps down a few coins on the counter, which might or might not be acceptable Canadian currency. The god pops open the carrot/ grape/ pretzels/ cheese Snak Pak. \"Lunch is on me, today. Perhaps I can start you on the path to eating more healthily.\" He purposefully starts with a cube of yellow cheese, popping it into his mouth as Icarus and Helios watch with interest. Apollo's face changes, almost imperceptibly - but, for someone whose face is ordinarily impassively perfect all the time, even the slightest change in expression is very noticeable. His eyes widen just a fraction - the perfectly curved eyebrows lift - the corners of his mouth turn down, just barely - \"Oh man, it must be gross!\" Helios sounds delighted. \"I would never eat that cheese! It has a shelf life of like, forty years!\" They watch, grinning in amusement, as Apollo goes through nine hells of agony and manages to swallow the cheese-inspired milk-based snack. He closes his eyes and shudders. \"This disgusting cheese may be one of humanity's many mistakes,\" he says after a moment, \"...but surely it's impossible to get raw produce wrong. One simply plants seeds in the earth, and with the grace of Demeter, they grow.\" \"Better not open that can of worms around Demeter,\" Helios mutters, but not too loudly - he, like Icarus, is hanging on this entire misadventure with bated breath. A little less confidently, Apollo puts a carrot stick into his mouth. The frown intensifies, and the eyebrows drop from where they'd risen to somewhere near his hairline, to knit slightly. \"These... are utterly tasteless,\" he says, bewildered. \"Carrots - are sweet! Buttery and crisp! A tantalizing crunch that gives way to a cloying hidden sweet flavor!\" \"Not these,\" Icarus understates, poking at the plastic cup. \"You never heard of the homogenization of food? It's all Big Business now.\" \"Part of government involvement in agriculture. The carrots are all engineered to grow fast and big and to keep well in storage/travel, at the cost of flavor,\" Helios lectures. Icarus quirks an eyebrow at him while Apollo glares. Helios snickers. \"It's been on Demeter's Top Ten Things to Bitch About for about eighty years now.\" \"Let me just spare you now... the grapes aren't much better,\" Icarus informs Apollo. \"Or the yogurt... the nuts are fine, I guess, though they're usually pretty salty...\" \"We are going to Greece every day for every meal,\" Apollo says firmly, putting a cup under the \"free tap water\" spout - Icarus wonders if he should tell him that disappointment is about to dog him yet again. \"Your entire agri-gustatory system needs an overhaul.\" \"Sounds hot,\" opines Helios while Icarus sighs. \"... I will be conferring with Demeter immediately. Unacceptable,\" Apollo says, holding the glass to his mouth. Icarus tries to remember the good old days, when drinking a glass of water was boring.",

    "text": "Thursday: Space Week is fairly well-promoted within Icarus' social circles - the planetarium has reduced-price entries and special shows, mainly geared towards kids; and signs and posters line the halls of the Science & Engineering college within his university. On the first day of Space Week, there's a lecture hosted in one of the auditoriums on campus. The university has been a little mysterious about who the \"special guest\" might be, and Icarus is utterly delighted to see that it's Geoffrey Landis - the famous aeronautical engineer, holder of nine patents in the fields of solar power and photovoltaics, and author of several books of science fiction. Icarus is so glad he chose to wear a tie. He probably has a stupid, enthralled expression on his face the entire time. When Landis finishes speaking, Icarus prays: Hermes please please please please please I'm sorry I know you're probably busy but please please please please would you bring me my book called Asimov's Science Fiction 2008 please I'll sacrifice something for you later please Hermes delivers the book with a bemused grin during intermission and waves off Icarus' fervent thanks, saying only that he'll 'think of some fun way for Icarus to repay him later'. This is ominous, but Icarus is too excited to care at the moment. Almost shaking with nerves, he approaches the scientist author and stammers out a gushing explanation of how cool he thinks he is, and how Icarus wrote a paper analyzing Landis' technical work in solar arrays, and how he loved Iron Angels but he got this publication when he was a kid and could Dr. Landis sign it???? Afterwards, when Icarus makes it to his apartment, he opens the book reverently. Landis signed his name near his poem in the publication - a poem called \"Fireflies.\" Icarus reads it again. The last line stands out: \"Just so, the immortals look out across the universe, as stars and galaxies Flick into life Fade into dark.\"... it's a little more shivery now, knowing what he knows. After a moment, he goes to look in the poetry compilation book for another poem: \"Five Pounds of Sunlight.\" Landis' poem compares the weight of five pounds of sunlight - the combined weight of light that touches the earth each second - with the weight of a kitten. Malaina, the little black bunny that Aphrodite gave him, weighs about five pounds. Icarus goes to her cage and holds her for a moment, considering. -------------------- Friday: Icarus goes to the local library to set up a model solar system. He's done this plenty of times before, in other places, with greater or lesser degrees of scientific accuracy. The first model solar system he ever made was when he was six years old. It's still in a box, in his room - his sister Alessa sent it to him when he moved to this apartment. He smiles at the librarian, who knows him well by now, and goes to the \"learning room\" where they usually host these kinds of events. There's a few small bookshelves set up to display space-themed books - some science, some adventure. Icarus spots a copy of the book he's going to read to the kids tonight. The solar system is plastic, this time: glow-in-the-dark, with spheres ranging in size from basketball to plum - little Mercury and Pluto. There's a representation of the asteroid belt, which is impressive, but no moons other than the earth's. Probably for the best. Jupiter's alone would keep Icarus occupied for a couple hours. The sun is, by necessity, the first celestial body to be established in the model. It's impossible anymore for Icarus to think of the sun without at least briefly thinking of the two gods that have been a part of his life lately. He holds the orange sphere for a moment, thinking,this is those two. This sun is somehow those two hot guys. Fucking weird. He shakes himself out of it and finishes assembling the solar system. The kids start filtering in around 5pm, and he smiles to see them all clamoring around the space-themed books and displays. He reads The Magic School Bus Explores the Solar System, and they dim the lights to watch Wall-E. As expected, there are divine interlopers: Helios and Apollo can be spotted intermittently throughout the evening, peeking in on the room and pretending not to be nosy about what Icarus is doing. With a wry sigh, he waves them in after the movie starts, firmly telling them in an undertone that there is to be no PDA in front of the kids. Both gods smirk. Icarus raises a warning finger. \"No. None! These kids are here to learn about space!\" They both discreetly cop feels during lights out, probably just to make a point. Icarus allows it, with only a major eyeroll to let them know they're incorrigible. Secretly, he's pleased they're here. Something about this being Space Week... well, it all started with them, didn't it? ---------------------- Saturday: The planetarium is packed - all day, if the other volunteers are to be believed. The shows are running nonstop; the side galleries are full of visitors; the hands-on rooms are a chaos of children. Ironically, Icarus hardly has time to think about space, his entire shift. He's too busy refilling brochures and stocking books and gifts and cleaning the auditorium between shows and chasing errant children from corners where they aren't supposed to be, coaxing them into good behavior with space stickers and erasers he keeps on hand at all times. On occasion, someone will snag him and ask an actual space question, and Icarus is delighted to answer. The whole surge of enthusiasm pleases him immensely. There's a wall, near the exit, with a small table and stack of celestial shapes - planets and rockets and moons and suns, all cut from construction paper, with markers nearby. The idea is that the visitors will write little notes with their names on them, and stick them on the wall nearby. Most people write their names and maybe a quick \"lots of fun!\" or maybe something specific they learned. At the end of the day, after everyone's cleared out and Icarus is cleaning the front hall, he pauses by the table, picks up a yellow paper sun. He can't think of what to write. He keeps thinking of the poems, in his book from Dr. Landis. The only thing that comes to mind is the beginning of a limerick: \"there once were two sun gods from Greece...\" In the end, he writes \"thank you for the five pounds. I'll try to return it someday\" and sticks it as near he can to the window, where the sun is in fact shining through. ------------------------ Sunday: Leroy and Elverna are enthusiastic about his idea, and the three of them spend the afternoon arranging a few shelves and corners of the flower shop. There isn't much of an aesthetic theme tying them together, but Leroy and Elverna have an eye for arrangements and manage to display the eclectic plants in a pleasing way. The flowers are all space-themed: pink and purple asters; two potted magnolias (star and galaxy); Mars allium; stargazer mercury tiarella; a venus hosta; pale climbing moonflower vines.... And, of course, sunflowers of a number of shades of red and orange and yellow. Apollo is beside himself with delight, and insists on sketching Icarus seated among them. \"Your lovely ginger hair is brought out by the warm colors of the flowers,\" he says, sketching furiously while Elverna and Leroy gush. It's embarrassing, but Icarus is just thankful he was allowed to wear his own clothes this time... instead of being forced into a short chiton, or having to argue about whether nudity was appropriate for the sake of art. Still, it's kind of... flattering, in a way, he has to admit. One of the gods of the sun finds him aesthetically pleasing. He finds Icarus beautiful, somehow. Icarus is trying to remind himself of his doubts, of the capriciousness of the gods, but... the idea that Apollo... an artist, and the god of a celestial body... could find him worthy of a work of art... The sketch is turned into a completed piece and titled \"Icarus and the Sunflowers.\" Seems a little on-the-nose to Icarus, but it's nice. He still wants to make something for them, in return. ------------------- Monday: The apartment smells amazing - the entire space is filled with the scent of strawberries. Icarus had the idea to dry them in his oven, since a dehydrator was quite expensive. The first batch turned out pretty good. Icarus feeds the sliced-off strawberry tops to Malaina the bunny and considers what the right choice would be for the cake element. Shortcake seems obvious, but it can be crumbly, which is a bad idea in a no-gravity space environment. Maybe angel food cake... and he'll actually have to figure out some kind of alternate whipped cream. Perhaps that, and the strawberry juice could be mixed beforehand with some kind of... holding gum. Icarus is sure he's heard of something like that. Or gelatin? \"You could ask Hestia,\" Apollo suggests, watching in amusement. \"Yeah, this is definitely her kinda gig,\" Helios agrees. \"Don't you mortals already have a recipe for strawberry shortcake, though? What are you messing with it for?\" \"In space, it's best to dehydrate things, so they last longer,\" Icarus says, popping a slice of dried strawberry into his mouth. \"And better to have food that stays together, rather than crumbling apart. The crumbs could go anywhere in a zero-gravity environment; maybe into some of the delicate instruments.\" \"You're a delicate instrument,\" Helios mutters. \"You're making this so you'll have a snack to bring to space with you?\" There's a pause after this question. Apollo and Helios are both grinning at him. Icarus' face flushes, and he folds his arms forbiddingly and scowls. \"Yeah, so what? What's wrong with wanting a nice dessert in space?\" They're both laughing at him now, genuinely amused. \"Nothing! Great idea! Much better than that gross peanut butter gel or whatever. But, I mean... did I miss something? You're not ready to go to space yet?\" Helios asks. \"I don't see any rockets, \"Doesn't hurt to prepare. I was going to share, but if you're going to be a smartass about it...\" Icarus pretends to sniff in disdain as Helios protests. They do end up eating the strawberries, of course, after a brief scuffle over whether or not the gods were allowed to feed Icarus by hand. It's... kind of a gift, he guesses, but the solemnity that he was hoping for was somewhat lacking. ------------ Tuesday: They're sitting on the couch together, the three of them, marathoning Deep Space Nine. They're watching this because it's playing nonstop (space-themed show on Space Week), and because Madiya accidentally let it slip one time that Icarus has a crush on \"that one guy in Star Trek\" and Helios and Apollo have been trying to suss out who it is ever since. Icarus isn't sure if they're doing it to either tease him mercilessly about it; or perhaps find the actor and kick his ass; or maybe both. But he's confident they'll never guess it's Odo in a thousand years. In reality, they're... basically... cuddling. Icarus' couch is fairly small. Apollo is next to him, arm draped over his shoulder, playing with the ends of his hair and smiling when Icarus shivers occasionally. Helios, not to be outdone, is flopped over, laying across both their laps but mostly Icarus', and tracing his fingers over Icarus' knees and poking his belly and holding his hand. It's nice. This is one of their more subdued moments - aside from the occasional good-natured grope or noisy joke about the episode playing - and he's appreciating the quiet familiarity. Really, when they dial down on the dramatics, they're not so bad... On the screen, Dr. Bashir and Ensign Melora Pazlar are fooling around in a low-gravity scenario. Helios points, abruptly. \"You humans always love that shit, don't you?\" \"Hmm?\" Icarus hasn't really been paying attention. Apollo's fingers are a little distracting. \"Flying around.\" \"Oh. Uh. Yeah, I... I guess so.\" After all, that's kind of what Icarus v.1.0 was trying to do... yes, he was trying to reach the sun gods, but even if Icarus can't *quite* remember that whole sad event, he still thinks that Greek Icarus would have wanted to fly for its own sake. Everyone has that fantasy, don't they?\" \"We could help you,\" Helios says, voice suddenly serious. There's a pause. \"It would be quite simple. And safe, of course.\" Apollo looks... not anxious, exactly; but not as self-assured as usual. A tiny bit worried. \"....What...?\" \"Like with floating. Or flying. I mean, most gods can do it sort of, but it's easy for me 'cause I'm the sun. You know, always cruising around in the heavens.\" You think you want to come up here? Up here where we are? All right, boy, show us. Let's see. The flash of a fragment of memory, but it comes and goes, this time; the anxiety replaced by something else. Something like intrigue. Icarus looks down at Helios, frowning faintly. \"On your chariot?\" \"Nah. I mean, really floating. It's like - I'd wrap my aegis around you. You know? It would basically be the same as if I was holding you in my hand, except to you, it'd feel like floating. I'd make it nice. Like, soft. Like a blanket, wrapped all around you, holding you in the air. And no cold wind, I'd make it warm and slow and nice. We could go anywhere.\" \"Helios is extremely natural and accomplished at it,\" Apollo says, voice softer than usual. He's complimenting Helios, which is... rare. It feels solemn. \"I would go along too, though. To be an anchor for you. I'd hold you too. Safe and held in our aeges. We could even stay near the ground if that's better.\" Icarus is trying to picture it. Helios and Apollo, bright and shining, really the sun gods he'd always wanted to reach. Their mysterious aeges, enveloping him in warmth and holding him up, in the air, close to them... He realizes he's blushing. The sun gods are watching him intently, small smiles on their faces. Icarus ducks his head, clears his throat, and stares resolutely at the TV. \"L-let... let me think about it,\" he manages. The sun gods murmur acquiescence and don't say anything further, but the smiles stay. -------------- Wednesday: University library volunteer day. Several hours when he's free to research. By the time he goes home, he has a binder ready. He's not a poems/painting kind of guy, after all; he's a nerd, and binders are what he does wel. This binder contains a compilation of facts about the sun, pulled from his spontaneous lectures at the library and planetarium. There's illustrations, charts and math. That's one tab. There's also a few photocopies of some of the kid's space books he loved when he was a kid. That's another tab. Second-to-last tab: the poems of Dr. Landis. At least, the ones that reminded him of the gods. Final tab: he's retrieved his paper sun from the planetarium. The one that says \"thanks for the five pounds.\" Below it, on a paper rocket, he's carefully printed the words \"yes, let's try it.\"",
    "sentences": [
      "Thursday: Space Week is fairly well-promoted within Icarus' social circles - the planetarium has reduced-price entries and special shows, mainly geared towards kids; and signs and posters line the halls of the Science & Engineering college within his university.",
      "On the first day of Space Week, there's a lecture hosted in one of the auditoriums on campus.",
      "The university has been a little mysterious about who the \"special guest\" might be, and Icarus is utterly delighted to see that it's Geoffrey Landis - the famous aeronautical engineer, holder of nine patents in the fields of solar power and photovoltaics, and author of several books of science fiction.",
      "Icarus is so glad he chose to wear a tie.",
      "He probably has a stupid, enthralled expression on his face the entire time.",
      "When Landis finishes speaking, Icarus prays: Hermes please please please please please I'm sorry I know you're probably busy but please please please please would you bring me my book called Asimov's Science Fiction 2008 please I'll sacrifice something for you later please Hermes delivers the book with a bemused grin during intermission and waves off Icarus' fervent thanks, saying only that he'll 'think of some fun way for Icarus to repay him later'.",
      "This is ominous, but Icarus is too excited to care at the moment.",
      "Almost shaking with nerves, he approaches the scientist author and stammers out a gushing explanation of how cool he thinks he is, and how Icarus wrote a paper analyzing Landis' technical work in solar arrays, and how he loved Iron Angels but he got this publication when he was a kid and could Dr. Landis sign it????",
      "Afterwards, when Icarus makes it to his apartment, he opens the book reverently.",
      "Landis signed his name near his poem in the publication - a poem called \"Fireflies.\"",
      "Icarus reads it again.",
      "The last line stands out: \"Just so, the immortals look out across the universe, as stars and galaxies Flick into life Fade into dark.\"... it's a little more shivery now, knowing what he knows.",
      "After a moment, he goes to look in the poetry compilation book for another poem: \"Five Pounds of Sunlight.\"",
      "Landis' poem compares the weight of five pounds of sunlight - the combined weight of light that touches the earth each second - with the weight of a kitten.",
      "Malaina, the little black bunny that Aphrodite gave him, weighs about five pounds.",
      "Icarus goes to her cage and holds her for a moment, considering.",
      "-------------------- Friday: Icarus goes to the local library to set up a model solar system.",
      "He's done this plenty of times before, in other places, with greater or lesser degrees of scientific accuracy.",
      "The first model solar system he ever made was when he was six years old.",
      "It's still in a box, in his room - his sister Alessa sent it to him when he moved to this apartment.",
      "He smiles at the librarian, who knows him well by now, and goes to the \"learning room\" where they usually host these kinds of events.",
      "There's a few small bookshelves set up to display space-themed books - some science, some adventure.",
      "Icarus spots a copy of the book he's going to read to the kids tonight.",
      "The solar system is plastic, this time: glow-in-the-dark, with spheres ranging in size from basketball to plum - little Mercury and Pluto.",
      "There's a representation of the asteroid belt, which is impressive, but no moons other than the earth's.",
      "Probably for the best.",
      "Jupiter's alone would keep Icarus occupied for a couple hours.",
      "The sun is, by necessity, the first celestial body to be established in the model.",
      "It's impossible anymore for Icarus to think of the sun without at least briefly thinking of the two gods that have been a part of his life lately.",
      "He holds the orange sphere for a moment, thinking,this is those two.",
      "This sun is somehow those two hot guys.",
      "Fucking weird.",
      "He shakes himself out of it and finishes assembling the solar system.",
      "The kids start filtering in around 5pm, and he smiles to see them all clamoring around the space-themed books and displays.",
      "He reads The Magic School Bus Explores the Solar System, and they dim the lights to watch Wall-E. As expected, there are divine interlopers: Helios and Apollo can be spotted intermittently throughout the evening, peeking in on the room and pretending not to be nosy about what Icarus is doing.",
      "With a wry sigh, he waves them in after the movie starts, firmly telling them in an undertone that there is to be no PDA in front of the kids.",
      "Both gods smirk.",
      "Icarus raises a warning finger.",
      "\"No. None!",
      "These kids are here to learn about space!\"",
      "They both discreetly cop feels during lights out, probably just to make a point.",
      "Icarus allows it, with only a major eyeroll to let them know they're incorrigible.",
      "Secretly, he's pleased they're here.",
      "Something about this being Space Week... well, it all started with them, didn't it?",
      "---------------------- Saturday: The planetarium is packed - all day, if the other volunteers are to be believed.",
      "The shows are running nonstop; the side galleries are full of visitors; the hands-on rooms are a chaos of children.",
      "Ironically, Icarus hardly has time to think about space, his entire shift.",
      "He's too busy refilling brochures and stocking books and gifts and cleaning the auditorium between shows and chasing errant children from corners where they aren't supposed to be, coaxing them into good behavior with space stickers and erasers he keeps on hand at all times.",
      "On occasion, someone will snag him and ask an actual space question, and Icarus is delighted to answer.",
      "The whole surge of enthusiasm pleases him immensely.",
      "There's a wall, near the exit, with a small table and stack of celestial shapes - planets and rockets and moons and suns, all cut from construction paper, with markers nearby.",
      "The idea is that the visitors will write little notes with their names on them, and stick them on the wall nearby.",
      "Most people write their names and maybe a quick \"lots of fun!\"",
      "or maybe something specific they learned.",
      "At the end of the day, after everyone's cleared out and Icarus is cleaning the front hall, he pauses by the table, picks up a yellow paper sun.",
      "He can't think of what to write.",
      "He keeps thinking of the poems, in his book from Dr. Landis.",
      "The only thing that comes to mind is the beginning of a limerick: \"there once were two sun gods from Greece...\" In the end, he writes \"thank you for the five pounds.",
      "I'll try to return it someday\" and sticks it as near he can to the window, where the sun is in fact shining through.",
      "------------------------ Sunday: Leroy and Elverna are enthusiastic about his idea, and the three of them spend the afternoon arranging a few shelves and corners of the flower shop.",
      "There isn't much of an aesthetic theme tying them together, but Leroy and Elverna have an eye for arrangements and manage to display the eclectic plants in a pleasing way.",
      "The flowers are all space-themed: pink and purple asters; two potted magnolias (star and galaxy); Mars allium; stargazer mercury tiarella; a venus hosta; pale climbing moonflower vines....",
      "And, of course, sunflowers of a number of shades of red and orange and yellow.",
      "Apollo is beside himself with delight, and insists on sketching Icarus seated among them.",
      "\"Your lovely ginger hair is brought out by the warm colors of the flowers,\" he says, sketching furiously while Elverna and Leroy gush.",
      "It's embarrassing, but Icarus is just thankful he was allowed to wear his own clothes this time... instead of being forced into a short chiton, or having to argue about whether nudity was appropriate for the sake of art.",
      "Still, it's kind of... flattering, in a way, he has to admit.",
      "One of the gods of the sun finds him aesthetically pleasing.",
      "He finds Icarus beautiful, somehow.",
      "Icarus is trying to remind himself of his doubts, of the capriciousness of the gods, but... the idea that Apollo... an artist, and the god of a celestial body... could find him worthy of a work of art...",
      "The sketch is turned into a completed piece and titled \"Icarus and the Sunflowers.\"",
      "Seems a little on-the-nose to Icarus, but it's nice.",
      "He still wants to make something for them, in return.",
      "------------------- Monday: The apartment smells amazing - the entire space is filled with the scent of strawberries.",
      "Icarus had the idea to dry them in his oven, since a dehydrator was quite expensive.",
      "The first batch turned out pretty good.",
      "Icarus feeds the sliced-off strawberry tops to Malaina the bunny and considers what the right choice would be for the cake element.",
      "Shortcake seems obvious, but it can be crumbly, which is a bad idea in a no-gravity space environment.",
      "Maybe angel food cake... and he'll actually have to figure out some kind of alternate whipped cream.",
      "Perhaps that, and the strawberry juice could be mixed beforehand with some kind of... holding gum.",
      "Icarus is sure he's heard of something like that.",
      "Or gelatin?",
      "\"You could ask Hestia,\" Apollo suggests, watching in amusement.",
      "\"Yeah, this is definitely her kinda gig,\" Helios agrees.",
      "\"Don't you mortals already have a recipe for strawberry shortcake, though?",
      "What are you messing with it for?\"",
      "\"In space, it's best to dehydrate things, so they last longer,\" Icarus says, popping a slice of dried strawberry into his mouth.",
      "\"And better to have food that stays together, rather than crumbling apart.",
      "The crumbs could go anywhere in a zero-gravity environment; maybe into some of the delicate instruments.\"",
      "\"You're a delicate instrument,\" Helios mutters.",
      "\"You're making this so you'll have a snack to bring to space with you?\"",
      "There's a pause after this question.",
      "Apollo and Helios are both grinning at him.",
      "Icarus' face flushes, and he folds his arms forbiddingly and scowls.",
      "\"Yeah, so what?",
      "What's wrong with wanting a nice dessert in space?\"",
      "They're both laughing at him now, genuinely amused.",
      "\"Nothing!",
      "Great idea!",
      "Much better than that gross peanut butter gel or whatever.",
      "But, I mean... did I miss something?",
      "You're not ready to go to space yet?\" Helios asks.",
      "\"I don't see any rockets, \"Doesn't hurt to prepare.",
      "I was going to share, but if you're going to be a smartass about it...\" Icarus pretends to sniff in disdain as Helios protests.",
      "They do end up eating the strawberries, of course, after a brief scuffle over whether or not the gods were allowed to feed Icarus by hand.",
      "It's... kind of a gift, he guesses, but the solemnity that he was hoping for was somewhat lacking.",
      "------------ Tuesday: They're sitting on the couch together, the three of them, marathoning Deep Space Nine.",
      "They're watching this because it's playing nonstop (space-themed show on Space Week), and because Madiya accidentally let it slip one time that Icarus has a crush on \"that one guy in Star Trek\" and Helios and Apollo have been trying to suss out who it is ever since.",
      "Icarus isn't sure if they're doing it to either tease him mercilessly about it; or perhaps find the actor and kick his ass; or maybe both.",
      "But he's confident they'll never guess it's Odo in a thousand years.",
      "In reality, they're... basically... cuddling.",
      "Icarus' couch is fairly small.",
      "Apollo is next to him, arm draped over his shoulder, playing with the ends of his hair and smiling when Icarus shivers occasionally.",
      "Helios, not to be outdone, is flopped over, laying across both their laps but mostly Icarus', and tracing his fingers over Icarus' knees and poking his belly and holding his hand.",
      "It's nice.",
      "This is one of their more subdued moments - aside from the occasional good-natured grope or noisy joke about the episode playing - and he's appreciating the quiet familiarity.",
      "Really, when they dial down on the dramatics, they're not so bad...",
      "On the screen, Dr. Bashir and Ensign Melora Pazlar are fooling around in a low-gravity scenario.",
      "Helios points, abruptly.",
      "\"You humans always love that shit, don't you?\"",
      "\"Hmm?\" Icarus hasn't really been paying attention.",
      "Apollo's fingers are a little distracting.",
      "\"Flying around.\"",
      "\"Oh.",
      "Uh",
      ".",
      "Yeah, I...",
      "I guess so.\"",
      "After all, that's kind of what Icarus v.1.0 was trying to do... yes, he was trying to reach the sun gods, but even if Icarus can't *quite* remember that whole sad event, he still thinks that Greek Icarus would have wanted to fly for its own sake.",

    "text": "For the most part, Madiya's religion has a minimal presence on Icarus' radar. Granted, Icarus isn't super-observant in his day-to-day life - take, for example, the amount of time it took him to realize that there was anything really different about Apollo and Helios. But as far as Madiya and Islam are concerned, it's really been far more low-key than sun deities breaking shit in Icarus' apartment. Generally, he's only consciously aware of it when she performs salah. Their classes often align such that he's hanging around outside one of the campus Quiet Rooms, where she goes for Dhuhr and Asr; and only once was he at her house for Maghrib and stood quietly out of the way in the next room while her family prayed. Ramadan is not much different, except that Madiya now joins him on his lunchtime dog walks instead of eating; and she tends to be less inclined to commit to events that might spill over into iftar. Madiya also makes a concerted effort to be more positive during Ramadan - probably difficult this year and the previous, since it coincides with their preparations for their finals. But she doesn't curse or complain or gossip, and since Icarus is loyally attempting to support her by doing the same, he finds that his own mood is uplifted more during Ramadan. So he's more patient than he might normally have been, when he walks into his apartment mid-afternoon and finds Artemis taking a soda and some leftover pizza from his fridge. \"Oh - hello, Artemis. Uh, help yourself,\" he says, removing his shoes as he shuts the door. Artemis grins at him. \"Don't mind if I do!\" She's already taking a bite, and nudges the fridge door with her hip. \"Er - not that I'm not glad to see you any time - but, I thought Apollo said he was going to be busy today? I don't think he's here...\" \"Yeah, the first day of Ramadan, he likes to make a special point to be up in the sky... kind of encouraging people, y'know?\" Icarus blinks. \"Oh - he - participates? In Ramadan?\" \"Not as such. He's just there. But since the month has so much to do with the sun and the moon, we all like to kind of look in on things, generally bless people.\" This feels....weird. \"Is that... okay? I mean - they - don't believe in you...\" As an agnostic-bordering-on-atheist, Icarus' shock at learning of the existence of the reality of the Greek gods had been more along the lines of surprise at learning something he'd thought of as a story had been, in fact, true. He hadn't had a previous deeply held religious conviction to be challenged. Artemis shrugs, cracking open the soda. \"They're spending a whole month trying to be better people and get closer to their god. We appreciate that kind of thing.\" \"Yeah..... I guess...\" She's watching him carefully now, an unreadable expression on her face. \"You think that's a problem?\" He spreads his hands defensively. \"No, it's just - I dunno. It feels weird, I guess.\" Artemis takes a huge drink of the soda. \"Us blessing them or not doesn't change their religion one iota. It's not invalidating them. They're not doing it for us... that's why we're not actively participating. Our interest in humanity has kinda been like that for a while now.\" \"Does that mean... if it's you guys in the sky...\" It's a strange feeling. Icarus really didn't believe in anything before. But he feels uncomfortable now, considering how important Islam is to Madiya. To all the rest of them. \"If their god, Allah, is real, I've never seen or met Him,\" she says, finishing off the pizza slice. \"...oh...\" \"Doesn't mean He's not, though.\" Icarus blinks at her. Artemis laughs, but kindly. \"Look. If there's one thing you humans are really bad about, it's your obsession with false dichotomies. I guess it's just the way you're raised to see the world now. It's not an either/or. The universe is too big for that.\" \"But... if all of you are in charge of running the world... and creating it, and stuff, then... how can their god be real?\" Icarus is getting genuinely distressed about this now. She leans over and boops his nose. \"Gods aren't the same as you, kiddo. We're liminal. Sometimes we're real; sometimes we're not. Sometimes I'm the moon; sometimes I'm a sexy babe with awesome archery skills. Sometimes the world was created by one God; sometimes it's an explosion of particles; sometimes it's a giant snake having sex with itself.\" As she probably intended, the outlandishness of this last option startles him into laughing, breaking the tension. She grins and takes another drink of soda. \"It's all true, unless it needs to be different. There aren't better words to explain it to you now... but you might be able to understand it later. Tee-ell-dee-arr, their god is real, but I don't exist where He would exist. All I'm doing is handing out blessings to kind people who deserve it.\" Icarus sighs. \"Gives me a headache...\" \"That's probably your blood sugar dropping. I heard you've been throwing off your normal meal pattern for Madiya's sake; that's sweet.\" \"I see you're not!\" he says, pointing at the soda. She burps theatrically, making him chuckle again. \"I'm operating on Mecca time right now! It's way after sundown there.\" \"If you're on Mecca time, shouldn't you be working - ugh, forget it,\" he sighs, seeing her grin at him again. \"Metaphysical, I know.\" She laughs. \"You get so mad about that! And even after I gave that nice speech about how gods are liminal. What a twerp.\" \"Did you just come over to confuse me and eat my pizza?\" Icarus tries giving her a stern look, which crumples when she makes the same face back at him. \"Mostly, yeah. Honestly, annoying you is turning into one of our favorite pastimes.\"",

    "text": "Icarus yawns enormously as he pads towards his bathroom. It's a Sunday; which means he's walking Smork and Troll before he does a shift at What in Carnation with Elverna and Leroy, then hopefully he'll have enough time to put in some work on the final project for - - He opens the door to his bathroom to see Apollo already there, seated elegantly on the edge of his bathtub, one leg crossed over the other and a guitar in position on his knee. Some kind of... devices, that look sort of like a tablet and a microphone but in an alien way, are positioned around him. Apollo looks up. \"Oh, hello, Icarus. You know, it's usually polite to know first.\" At this point, it's not worth arguing that it's not Apollo's apartment. In any case, Icarus is still blinking at Apollo, wondering if he's still asleep. Apollo plays three chords and hums to himself. \"Uh.....\" \"Don't mind me, I shouldn't be much more than another hour at this point.\" \"Um - w-wait, what...?\" There's always the little uncertainty, when he witnesses the gods doing something weird. Should he ask? What if he offends them and makes them angry? But on the other hand... what the hell is Apollo doing? Icarus decides to just take the plunge and ask. \"Okay...Why are you playing your guitar in my bathroom?\" \"The acoustics in here are second to none.\" This is technically an answer... Icarus isn't quite satisfied, but he can see that getting to the bottom of this will take more time than he wants to spend. There are urgent matters he needs to attend to. \"Well, can it wait? I gotta use the bathroom.\" \"Go ahead.\" \"Apollo!\" Icarus tries to make his voice sound less apologetic or whiny, and more authoritative and stern, with mixed results. \"I can't while you're here!\" Apollo sighs. \"Can't it wait? I'm hitting my stride with this composition!\" \"No! I gotta pee and I can't do it with you watching!\" Apollo rolls his eyes but quirks his mouth, standing up. \"Your shyness is very inconvenient at times, Icarus. Very well... you have five minutes.\" He musses Icarus' hair as he goes. \"Make sure to make time to attend to your pileous grooming as well.\" ------- Pileus: the cap of a mushroom; also a brimless felt cap worn in Ancient Greece. Icarus frowns at his phone from where he's eating his cereal in the kitchen. Apollo's gone back into the bathroom with the door shut, and Icarus is too proud to ask him what the hell that word had meant. Clearly, it must be this hat, right? But he has no idea what that's supposed to mean... \"Ah, you spelled it wrong.\" Icarus jumps, startled, at the sound of Helios' voice about two inches from his ear. \"Sh-shit! Helios! Don't sneak up - \" Helios snatches Icarus' phone away from him and types in something, then hands it back to Icarus. Pileous: of or relating to hair. \"Oh.\" Icarus glares flatly at the phone. Apollo had been making fun of his bed hair. Uncool. \"He's used that word on me more than once,\" Helios remarks, going over to Icarus' cabinet to fish out a large mixing bowl. \"It should be off-limits to make fun of someone less than five minutes after they wake up,\" Icarus grumbles. \"Doesn't occur to him. That asshole wakes up looking flawless. It's ridiculous.\" Helios upends the rest of Icarus' cereal into the mixing bowl. \"Thank you Demeter for providing this crunchy corn food!\" he says dramatically before poking around in the dry cereal with a spoon. \"There's no prize in Corn Flakes,\" Icarus says around a mouthful of his own cereal. Helios drops the spoon on the table in exasperation. \"Boring food without even a prize?! You need some better breakfasts, Mop-Head,\" he exclaims as he abandons the cereal. Faintly, there comes a sound of a guitar being strummed. Helios glances over. \"Oh - he's still working on the song?\" \"Ah, yeah. He kicked me out so he could work on it.\" \"Well, it's an important day, after all.\" \"Hmm?\" Icarus looks up, curious. Helios raises his eyebrows. \"It's Mother's Day, Mop-Head!\" Oh, right. Icarus had known that, of course... he's planning to call his own mother on his way home from the flower shop. \"I... didn't know you guys did that...\" Helios shrugs. \"Apollo does, for sure. There is probably no bigger Momma's Boy in existence than Apollo.\" \"Leto, right? That's her name?\" \"Yeah. She's the goddess of motherhood. Well, one of them. It's kind of a group effort.\" \"He's really close with her, then?\" \"Oh, for sure. Those three are thick as thieves together. That is, I'm including Artemis, too. Constantly visiting each other, checking in on each other, telling stories about each other...obviously, Mother's Day wasn't really a thing back then, but there were still formal cults for her and stuff. Every year Apollo composes a song for her, and gets her a huge glittery card. Arty too, I guess. Probably she kills a bear for Leto or something.\" \"Ah.\" Icarus frowns. He's not very close with his own parents. Not that he doesn't get along with them... there was just always a distance. They weren't warm with each other, the way other families seem to be. That distance only grew once he started college. Probably his fault. He isn't much for talking on the phone; and between his jobs and the classwork, he stays busy. He sent her a card for Mother's Day, of course, and he's going to call her later... but, in the face of a god who has been composing a song for his own mother every year for centuries or longer, it feels kind of cheap. If Helios notices the dampened mood from Icarus' end of the table, he doesn't say anything. He keeps talking about the Moms of Olympus: \"Some of the others started doing stuff for Mother's Day, just because why not that day? But I think everyone kind of collectively decided not to make a big group thing out of it. You may not have heard this, but Olympus is, like, charged to the max with Mommy and Daddy issues.\" \"I think I heard something about that,\" Icarus says wryly. It does make him feel a little bit better, to know that it's not held to a universal standard to be all Hallmark-y about your mother. \"What about - uh - I mean - \" he cuts himself off awkwardly. Helios snickers and reaches over to goose Icarus' ribs. \"You're such a little dork, Mop-Head. It's okay; my mom scattered into the ether ages ago.\" \"Oh...\" Is that... like dying, for a god? Icarus doesn't dare ask. \"Do you... miss her?\" \"She's still there. It's not - hmm.\" Helios leans back in his chair, dangerously far. \"These young gods are - different from the rest of us. Theia... gave birth to me, but then... it's not like she was a person, exactly. Even I wasn't, at first. Apollo and all the other babies were people from the start; it was different for them.\" This is - new information, and Icarus finds himself a little unsettled by it. Helios wasn't a 'person,' at first? All at once, he's extremely aware of how different the gods must be from himself... Helios continues, though he looks like he's getting bored with the conversation. \"I liked Theia just fine, I guess... there just wasn't really a person to know, there. Everyone's got a different way they feel about their mom, yknow? It's not that big a deal to everyone. Shit, just look at the difference between Apollo and Hephaestus. Or Athena, for that matter. Yikes. Anyway, one Momma's Boy is enough, I think.\" He looks over at Icarus. \"When's your dumb work stuff done for the day?\" ------------ It's three in the afternoon, now: he ended up staying later than he expected at the flower shop. They were swamped with last-minute flower orders, for Mother's Day. Leroy's currently trying to clean up the disaster zone in the greenhouse. Elverna's locking up the side entrance. Icarus just finished counting the till. He's holding ten dollars in his hand - his own money. He discreetly puts the money in the pile. Ten dollars can only buy a single rose and a sprig of purple limonium, their stems bound together with white ribbon, and a tiny lace bag with a few chocolate kisses inside and a simple, tiny card threaded on the ribbon. He's not close to his mother, really - maybe he never will be. People feel different ways about their mothers; and he's not on bad terms with her. But something about Helios talking about all the worse mother situations a person can have, makes him want to do something to acknowledge that he had a pretty good mom. Now... how to get this to her... He feels too shy to ask Helios; too inadequate to ask Apollo. But there's no post on Sunday, and Icarus' mother lives far from the city... \"Ummmmmmm...........................\" He hesitates, uncertain how he's supposed to address this entity. \"................Hermes.....?\" \"Ummmmmmmm yes?\" The voice is about two inches behind his ear and Icarus shrieks, startled, dropping his flowers. Hermes catches them easily, bringing them up to his face to inspect them. He's floating casually in the air behind Icarus, in no way acknowledging the heart attack he just gave the mortal. \"Who are these for?\" he asks, in the tones of someone who already knows the answer to the question. \"Sh-shit... uh - h-hey, Hermes, I, uh... those.. are for... my mom? If - is it okay - can I ask if you would - \" Icarus is stammering, face reddening. Hermes gives him a stern look, folding his arms forbiddingly. The frown on his face, when Icarus has only ever seen him smiling, is intimidating as fuck. \"I am the messenger of the gods, Icarus. You called me from my duties to ask you to deliver flowers to your mother?\" Icarus pales and starts hyperventilating. \"Oh - f-fuck, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to be - presumptuous, obviously you're busy, please don't even - oh!\" \"Ouranos' balls, you're too fuckin' cute. So easy!\" Hermes messes up Icarus' hair furiously and jams the ballcap - part of the shop uniform - over his eyes. \"It's fine! Of course I will. Calm down already.\" \"J-jeez,\" Icarus manages, weak with relief. \"O-okay. I'm - uh, calm. Thank you very much for - I know you have stuff to do - \" \"Kid, shut up! It's fine, I'm happy to help.\" Hermes is smiling beatifically now, plainly amused at Icarus' panic. \"Okay. But thank you. Um. I have the address - \" \"No need. I can find it.\" And with that, Hermes is gone, with only a faint breeze to indicate he'd ever been there. ------------------- Epilogue: Hermes delivers the flowers and vanishes before he can be seen. Having completed this task, he resumes his journey to a certain cave near Mount Cyllene - Maia greets him on approach, grinning broadly. He sweeps his mother up into an enormous hug and wastes no time in gently wrapping an arm about her waist and carrying her off, to visit whatever place she wants to see and do whatever she wants to do there. Hermes is fortunate to have more free time than usual today. Most of the gods and goddesses of Olympus have chosen to deliver their messages in person. Kore and Demeter have no need for correspondence between each other for a while. Mother's Day fairly nearly coincides with the height of springtime and is a lovely way to cap the first flurry of joy they feel at spending time together again. Eros has given his mother his usual gift - a day at a spa. He attends as well, which may not be usual for sons, but they're an unusual pair. They enjoy the heat rocks and mud masks and hot spring soak, and drink champagne and eat chocolate for hours. Dionysus blanches as Pierce Brosnan begins caterwauling on screen. He loves his mother; he really does. His offer to watch any movies or plays she wants is sincere. But gods, this is an insult to the art of theater! At least you're pretty, he thinks to Pierce as Semele clasps her hands and watches, eyes shining. Zeus, Poseidon, and Hades are standing in a small room, some distance from the main hall. Hestia has already been here, and lit the candles. A statue of a round, fertile goddess wearing a turreted crown is in the center of the room, surrounded by the candles. A bowl is at the statue's feet, filled with a fragrant-smelling liquid. The three gods each put a flower around the bowl. \"Thank you,\" they say in turn, and stand quietly a while before leaving. Hera is in her rooms, reading a book. She'll go to the room herself, later, with Demeter and Hestia. On her bedside table are a three cards: a handmade one from Ares, with a box of chocolate; a bright and cheerful one with photos of happy children glued to it, from Hebe; a simple one from Hephaestus and an elegant bracelet that came with it. The bookmark is a card of sorts, too - it came along with the book Hera's reading, from Athena. Artemis' nymphs wait in the woods beyond the palace of Olympus. Artemis will be back eventually - Mother's Day is always a big event for her. The nymphs have prepared a surprise dinner for her this year. Artemis isn't a mother to anyone; and yet, for many of the nymphs, she is nearly the only mother figure they've known. Leto is seated in her home, surrounded by plushies and flowers and sweets and, yes, a bearskin, courtesy of Artemis. Apollo is singing his song for her, while Artemis and the Muses dance. Leto's heart swells with love for her children, who have loved her from the beginning, and given her life a purpose she couldn't have imagined when she was merely Leto the Titaness. There is a small note tucked into Apollo's guitar case - handwritten, on a scrap of cereal box. It's in Icarus' small scrawled handwriting: I'd like to meet your mom someday. She sounds very nice.",

    "text": "\"I'm pleased to see that you've finally decided to pay closer attention to your grooming and personal attire,\" Apollo says, watching as Icarus critically applies a few more touches of hairspray. \"But I do have a few questions about your sartorial choices.\" Icarus frowns. He knows exactly what Apollo is asking - it's hard not to - but he's not familiar with the word. Does it mean... ironic? No, that's 'satirical'... \"Yeah, and did your hair always used to be that orange? I thought the ginger in your hair was subtle. This is like, pure carrot.\" He's wearing a dark blue tunic with appliques all over it - all the planets (and dwarf planets) are represented, as well as a few comets, spaceships, and the sun of course. He has sew-on patches for the Canadian Space Agency on the knees of his black jeans, and sneakers he painted red and pinned little Martian figurines on. He even got clip-on earrings with Saturn. His hair, as Helios pointed out, is now very orange, and formed into a sort-of bun, held in place with an awful lot of hairspray. \"I'm Ms Frizzle!\" Both gods pause for a moment, then before Icarus can explain, Apollo's face lights up in recognition. \"Ah! From your children's book.\" \"Oh right! And Mop-head drew a crayon picture of himself in a spaceship on the back cover.\" Icarus' face reddens a little but he's pleased to see they remember. \"Yeah, it's my Ms Frizzle costume. Me and Madiya worked hard on it.\" \"Madiya and I,\" Apollo corrects, and sighs. \"If only you would attend to your daily fashion so assiduously. I will say, the color suits you. The blue tunic, I mean. The orange is quite... remarkably orange.\" \"So's the Friz,\" Icarus says, loyal to his favorite fictional teacher. \"What's the occasion?\" Helios asks. \"It's not Halloween for another six months.\" \"It's World Book Day! The campus library coordinated with the city branches and they're all doing a big promotional event. I'm going to be working in the kids' area - there's a book fair, and events like writing their own books, stuff like that. We're supposed to dress up as our favorite characters from kids' books. I asked Athena if she wanted to go, but she said she was busy... I guess that makes sense. She probably has a lot to do for this holiday.\" \"Quite a lot.\" Apollo smiles. \"This year, for the first time since the holiday's conception, World Book Day is hosted by the city of Athens.\" Icarus' eyes go round. \"Ohhh. She must be really proud!\" \"She's been such a pain in the ass about it,\" Helios complains. \"World Book Day has been brought up as a council topic... more than once, in the last few months,\" Apollo says. \"Plus, for that host city, the event lasts the entire year. She's been quite involved. Hermes and I have been working on it with her, too - in fact, I have to leave for the next event soon, myself.\" \"...Oh,\" Icarus says, surprised to find himself a little disappointed. \"Oh, I thought - I guess I assumed you'd be able to come - well, I mean, you have stuff to do. Obviously. I forgot you don't just do - sun stuff, right, it's - you have a lot of - \" Apollo mercifully cuts off his awkwardness. \"I'll be at your library event, as well, Icarus. And so will Athena. We'll be there... metaphysically.\" Icarus tries to keep his face from showing anything. Apollo laughs anyway, unfooled, and presses a hand to Icarus' chest. His fingers are warm. \"In the hearts of all who honor World Book Day, we'll be - oh, Icarus!\" Apollo points at the Frizzle tunic. \"You put the sun decal over your heart!\" Icarus goes red. \"That was an accident! I - I didn't even - that's just where it fit best! And it's off by a half-inch anyway!\" Apollo hides a smile, and Helios just laughs outright. \"All right! Now we know Icarus' seduction style!\" \"As a way of showing my appreciation, perhaps I can take you to the 'Science in Literature' event in Athens this weekend.\" \"And in the meantime, Mop-head, lemme go get a costume myself, so I can go to your event - I can be there in person 'cause I got nothing to do with books.\" A red flag goes up in Icarus' brain, distracting him from his embarrassment. \"Uh - hold on, what costume...??\" \"I'm thinking Falstaff.\" \"This is a kid's event -!\" \"It'll be educational for them!\"",

    "text": "He's just - used to it, now. He barely even bats an eye anymore, when he walks home from class and gets accosted by a new (always remarkably attractive) stranger. They're turning up everywhere now, ubiquitous and mildly annoying, like insects or pollen. But he hasn't gotten quite so inured to the presence of Greek gods in his life, that he isn't startled when he walks into his apartment one day and sees a woman in there: tall and heavy-framed with wheat-colored hair and dark skin, surrounded by plants and a dismaying amount of dirt. Icarus' brain actually focuses first on the disastrous mess in his living room, rather than the intrusive presence of the woman, so maybe he is getting too used to the gods. \"Wha... what the hell?!\" he manages to stammer, gaping at the potting soil which is currently everywhere. \"What is all this... who are you??\" The woman glances over. \"Oh, hello! You must be Icarus!\" Icarus fights the urge to be annoyed at this statement - 'you must be Icarus.' It's his damn apartment! He nods a bit jerkily. \"Uh - y-yeah. That's me.\" \"I'm Demeter.\" The woman straightens up - she's very tall - and offers a hand that swallows Icarus' own. Her hand is clean, actually; completely free of dirt, in spite of the fact that she's been clearly digging around in it for a while now. This bodes well for his security deposit, maybe. \"It's... it's a pleasure to meet you, uh... Lady... Demeter...?\" Icarus asks hesitantly, uncertain if she needs a fancier title than 'Lady.' She's one of the six original Olympians, isn't she? Who established the known order of the world? Then again, Helios is older than all of them, isn't he? But then again, it's hard to look at the feisty, mouthy sun Titan and think 'Lord' or 'elder god.' But he is those things... maybe Icarus needs to give this some more thought - but they nearly all immediately tell him to drop the title anyway - \"Just Demeter, hon,\" Demeter interrupts his train of thought. She makes a little clucking noise with her tongue. \"Helios was right; you're polite. I guess opposites attract, eh? Ha ha!\" She has a voice that carries with confidence and a certain loud joie de vivre; everything about her conveys the sense of a woman who is taking up all the space she cares to. A woman who isn't going to be set aside or pushed around. \"I'm always... surprised to hear how many people have heard of me,\" Icarus says. \"Those two dumdums are obsessed! Sunny - that is, Helios - he told me about you first, you know - we're great friends. Of course, at first, he was just all competitive and bragging about how you were gonna fall for him first - what a little show-off. I'd say I hope he didn't annoy you too much, but, well, I know Sunny well enough to know he probably did. Probably still is, right? Ha ha!\" \"Heh, well, you're not wrong,\" Icarus says, smiling in spite of himself. Demeter has a certain folksy charm, he supposes - pushy but friendly. \"They kinda both... bust in here all the time bring a lot of chaos with them... er...\" Is this a good segue to address the forcible terraforming taking place on his living room floor? She grins at him, hands on her hips. \"So polite! Yeah, Sunny said you were going to have a fit about my little project - and by 'fit,' he said your eye was gonna twitch and you'd probably cry about it later. Well, relax. It'll all be gone when I'm done.\" Icarus sags with relief. \"Oh, thank god - er - gods...? - uh, I mean. I don't want to seem ungrateful, for, whatever... you're doing? It's just, like, I paid a security deposit, and I was worried that - well - irrelevant, now, I guess, right? Because everything's fine. Um. Well, uh... so... what are you doing, anyway?\" Demeter is wearing that look of barely-suppressed amusement that the gods all wear when Icarus starts babbling, and Icarus is briefly terrified that she's going to comment on his dorky awkwardness - she seems to lack any social delicacy - but she takes the bait he offers at the end, and turns back to the Lawn & Garden explosion. \"Sunny said you eat about as healthy as he does, which would be horrifying, if it's true - and I looked through your pantry, Icarus, and it's pretty grim in there.\" \"Apollo says the same thing,\" he offers weakly. She tuts at him. \"At least one of them is paying attention! But you really shouldn't rely on the gods to spoon-feed you, I taught agriculture to humanity for a reason - \" \"I used to volunteer at the community garden, before I started taking classes... it's just, there's not much I can do in an apartment...\" She snaps her fingers at him. \"Aha! But there's where you're wrong! There's a ton you can do in a small space - I've done a lot of tinkering to get it so you can have a practically self-sustaining farm right here in your apartment. You'll be eating healthy, fresh food - the kind of food you were intended to eat - and Helios tells me that you're very environmentally conscious, so this'll be a great opportunity for you to incorporate sustainable gardening into your life and decrease your carbon footprint as well!\" Damn it. She's tapped into his easily-summoned barely-subconscious guilt he feels about the state of the world. He's helpless to protest as she walks him through her system of stacked containers and polypipes (is that a real word? Must be Greek; Icarus has no idea what it is) and window planters and how his tiny little 3x3' balcony is going to be crammed full of vegetables, that balcony is going to be working overtime on accommodating the plants but it'll be worth it when he can have fresh salad and grains every night, instead of endless ramen noodles and hot dogs! It's not that Icarus cares what she does with the balcony - he never goes out there anyway, due to that whole debilitating fear of heights/falling. But he's starting to get a little bit worried now. Icarus is all for salad but it's not like fresh produce is that hard to find. There's an organic corner store two blocks away. The problem is, he couldn't afford to eat healthy. Like the way he probably can't afford all the garden paraphernalia involved in keeping these plants alive. And even if he had extra cash to spend - well, he wouldn't, because he's more or less constantly working his jobs in order to have cash in the first place, which means he has no time to attend to maintaining what's beginning to look like a little biosphere, as Demeter arranges her project and talks about heritage tomatoes and how she's invented a new species of pepper and Icarus can be the first to grow it. \"It's just...\" he begins, nervously. Demeter looks over at him expectantly, the seedlings of Speckled Garfech, Golden Pow and Angels of Saucing going into a converted vertical shoe rack. How do you say 'no' to a goddess? \"I'm not sure... how I'm going to be able to take care of all these. I'm nearly always busy, with school or work, and I don't have a lot of extra money to spend...\" He gestures at the edible jungle forming around him. \"I would feel terrible if all these plants withered up, because I wasn't a good enough - farmer, to take care of them. And after all your hard work.\" Demeter smiles at him, indulgently. \"Oh, hon. You really are such a worried, responsible, polite little guy. No wonder Sunny's nuts for you. What a cutie.\" She chucks him under the chin and goes back to her tomatoes. \"I told you, I've done a lot of tinkering! You won't have to do anything but eat, when it's time. The only good thing about having Sunny and 'Pollo hanging around all the time is you know these plants'll get sufficient light.\" \"They need water too, though? And there's so many... and, like, fertilizer and stuff?\" \"Hydroponics!\" Icarus' brain immediately envisions some kind of Star-Trek-like botany room. \"Hydroponics...? I don't have any water...\" \"You goof. You do too.\" Demeter is pointing at Mr. Limpet, the fish Icarus won at the summer jubilee last year. Mr. Limpet is currently eyeing Demeter and Icarus with a certain piscine curiosity from where his 5-gallon tank sits in place of honor by the bookshelf. \"Mr. Limpet is using that, though.\" \"Right, and that's what you want! Though if you want to maximize your growth, you'll need more fish. But essentially, you just need a bigger tank, and set up a pumping system to run fish-water through all the plants, then back through a filter so it's all good to go in the tank again!\" \"I have no idea how to do that.\" He can't really use the 'do I look like a rocket scientist to you' rejoinder, since rocket science is part of his intended career field, so he just goes with plain 'I'm a dumbass' speech. \"Neither do I,\" Demeter says, unexpectedly. \"Well, I do, but I'm not as great at it. Poseidon's really got a great system figured out, though - you've heard of him, right, Lord of the Sea? He does freshwater, too, now. He's great at it, a very charming, talented rascal. I'll send him along a bit later.\" \"O-oh,\" Icarus says, a small voice, lost as Demeter continues talking about all the plans she has for his place.",

      "There's an organic corner store two blocks away.",
      "The problem is, he couldn't afford to eat healthy.",
      "Like the way he probably can't afford all the garden paraphernalia involved in keeping these plants alive.",
      "And even if he had extra cash to spend - well, he wouldn't, because he's more or less constantly working his jobs in order to have cash in the first place, which means he has no time to attend to maintaining what's beginning to look like a little biosphere, as Demeter arranges her project and talks about heritage tomatoes and how she's invented a new species of pepper and Icarus can be the first to grow it.",
      "\"It's just...\" he begins, nervously.",
      "Demeter looks over at him expectantly, the seedlings of Speckled Garfech, Golden Pow and Angels of Saucing going into a converted vertical shoe rack.",
      "How do you say 'no' to a goddess?",
      "\"I'm not sure...",
      "how I'm going to be able to take care of all these.",
      "I'm nearly always busy, with school or work, and I don't have a lot of extra money to spend...\" He gestures at the edible jungle forming around him.",
      "\"I would feel terrible if all these plants withered up, because I wasn't a good enough - farmer, to take care of them.",
      "And after all your hard work.\"",
      "Demeter smiles at him, indulgently.",
      "\"Oh, hon.",
      "You really are such a worried, responsible, polite little guy.",
      "No wonder Sunny's nuts for you.",
      "What a cutie.\"",
      "She chucks him under the chin and goes back to her tomatoes.",
      "\"I told you, I've done a lot of tinkering!",
      "You won't have to do anything but eat, when it's time.",
      "The only good thing about having Sunny and 'Pollo hanging around all the time is you know these plants'll get sufficient light.\"",
      "\"They need water too, though?",
      "And there's so many... and, like, fertilizer and stuff?\" \"Hydroponics!\"",
      "Icarus' brain immediately envisions some kind of Star-Trek-like botany room.",
      "\"Hydroponics...?",
      "I don't have any water...\" \"You goof.",
      "You do too.\"",
      "Demeter is pointing at Mr. Limpet, the fish Icarus won at the summer jubilee last year.",
      "Mr. Limpet is currently eyeing Demeter and Icarus with a certain piscine curiosity from where his 5-gallon tank sits in place of honor by the bookshelf.",
      "\"Mr. Limpet is using that, though.\"",
      "\"Right, and that's what you want!",
      "Though if you want to maximize your growth, you'll need more fish.",
      "But essentially, you just need a bigger tank, and set up a pumping system to run fish-water through all the plants, then back through a filter so it's all good to go in the tank again!\"",
      "\"I have no idea how to do that.\"",
      "He can't really use the 'do I look like a rocket scientist to you' rejoinder, since rocket science is part of his intended career field, so he just goes with plain 'I'm a dumbass' speech.",
      "\"Neither do I,\" Demeter says, unexpectedly.",
      "\"Well, I do, but I'm not as great at it.",
      "Poseidon's really got a great system figured out, though - you've heard of him, right, Lord of the Sea?",
      "He does freshwater, too, now.",
      "He's great at it, a very charming, talented rascal.",
      "I'll send him along a bit later.\"",
      "\"O-oh,\" Icarus says, a small voice, lost as Demeter continues talking about all the plans she has for his place."

    "text": "There are a lot of problems in Icarus' life. Some of them are directly related to the stress of being a university student trying to make ends meet; some of them stem from ghost baggage, several millennia old. If the latter category, the specific, here-and-now problem often starts with either a lecture from Apollo or some friendly bullying from Helios. Today, it's Helios, pelting Icarus in the back of the head with a snowball as he trudges through the snow on his way back from a shift at the library. He's on his motorcycle-chariot, whose motor is rumbling as it idles. Helios is grinning at him. \"Get on, loser, we're going sledding!\" Icarus gives Helios his deadest dead-fish stare. \"Sledding? Really? You really are just a big five-year-old, aren't you?\" \"Five myrietes old,\" Helios corrects him, and grins when Icarus frowns in confusion. \"But yeah! Hurry up and get on!\" Icarus groans. \"Helios... I really should be studying...\" Helios throws another snowball, narrowly missing Icarus' crotch. \"Listen, kiddo, you can either climb on yourself or I can tie you up and kidnap you again, your call.\" The thing is, Helios absolutely will do that. It's not an idle threat. Icarus slumps and makes his way over carefully. \"...You really enjoy that too much,\" he says. \"I don't enjoy it too much!... but yeah, I was kinda hoping you'd resist a little more,\" Helios leers cheerfully at him as he climbs on the back of the motorcycle and clings tightly to him. It's feeding the god's ego to hold onto him like this, yes, but Icarus knows by now that Helios is gonna ride way too fast, and probably off-road. And as he'd anticipated, there is no sign of a helmet or any other safety equipment anywhere. Helios drives slowly and responsibly through the city streets, getting Icarus to let his guard down. But once they get out to a stretch of road with no other cars around, the Titan abruptly gives a yell and makes his chariot roar at top speed, making Icarus shriek and grab tightly to the leather jacket. At the end of the streak of speed, the motorcycle does a completely unnecessary, stupidly dangerous wheelie through a blazing ring in the fabric of space before them - the portal, to the Space Between Worlds. Icarus has somehow gotten used to being here - sort of. It's ceased to shock, anyway, though he still gets nervous. The gods use this space to travel and perform the majority of their godly tasks, or so they claim. Icarus feels uneasy, though, being here on Helios' motorcycle. He guesses it's no more or less safe than Apollo's chariot, or Athena's. But without walls around him, there's a feeling that he could fall off at any time... and here, he might fall through the stars forever... if the gods choose not to catch him, again. Would that be better, or worse, a fall that ends quickly, with pain and drowning? He keeps a firm grip on Helios' jacket as they fly through the inky blackness, and through another portal. The daylight is glaring after the Space Between Worlds, and there's the brief full-body flinch as he's suddenly smacked with real cold - far colder than what they'd just left behind. Helios' chariot's engine dies down to a gutter as they drive through drifts of snow with a godly disregard for the obstacle of traction - oh, actually, it's been transformed into a snowmobile. A godly disregard for the permanence of objects, then. Apollo is nearby, wearing extremely fashionable winter gear and inspecting his fingerless-gloved hand intently. \"Hey, Apollo! I brought Mop-Head!\" Apollo looks up. \"Oh, excellent! Hello, Icarus. I was just taking a look at the snowflakes. We didn't often encounter Chione the snow goddess, when we were in Greece - she was somewhat remote from us. I didn't realize her artistry; these flakes are quite lovely.\" Sometimes the gods bring Icarus' attention to the natural world in unexpected ways. \"Hi, Apollo... Uh, yeah, they are, aren't they? They say that each snowflake is totally unique, too.\" \"I'll have to compliment her artistic integrity.\" Icarus is about to ask how often they did see Chione, in the old days, but the question is lost as he attempts to disembark from the snowmobile and sinks into unexpectedly deep snow - he loses his balance and falls face-down into snow that completely buries his body in wet cold by at least a foot and a half. Helios squawks in laughter. \"Icarus, shit! Did you not notice there was snow here?!\" Icarus sputters as he struggles to push himself upright, out of the snow. It's almost to his waist! With the way Apollo and the snowmobile were set upon the snow, there was nothing to indicate it was deeper than a couple of inches. \"H-how the hell would I know how deep this was?!\" \"Luckily the snow cushioned your fall,\" Apollo tsks, pulling him upright. The god gives him a critical glance and then sighs. \"You aren't appropriately dressed for this weather, Icarus. I thought we'd spoken before about your disregard for your health.\" \"I was dressed just fine for walking home in the city,\" Icarus complains. His face is a little red; he chooses to chalk it up to the weather, rather than the way Apollo is holding him effortlessly and eyeing him over. \"I suppose that's fair. Well, you're a long distance north from where you started. Helios decided on this place after careful consideration, for its remoteness - Helios, you said this was Yukon Territory, correct?\" \"Or Alaska, maybe.\" Helios shrugs, already hopping off his chariot and dismissing it. Apollo closes his eyes and concentrates; Icarus finds himself wearing an extremely heavy snowsuit, scarf, and hat; a little more reminiscent of the kid from A Christmas Story than Icarus really cares for, but the sudden warmth is welcome. He firmly ignores the way Helios is snickering at him, and is glad the ridiculously excessive face covering is hiding his face. \"Thanks - oh!\" He startles as Apollo scoops him up bridal-style and begins walking off through on top of the snow. \"There is an area here that we had cleared out; the snow isn't as deep. If Helios had more sense, he would have taken you there first.\" \"I wanted to show him our snowmen!\" \"Oh - yes, all right, good idea.\" \"You've been out here building snowmen..?\" \"And I did some heli-boarding!\" Helios boasts, swaggering alongside Apollo. \"I was gonna bring you, Mop-Head, but I remembered about your thing - \" Helios is referring, of course, to Icarus' acrophobia/ basiphobia, as a result of falling to his death in his previous lifetime - \"...So I heli-boarded by myself because some of us were busy staring at their hands.\" \"I was critiquing art,\" Apollo replies loftily. \"So you've been out here for a while, it sounds like?\" Icarus asks. He files away for later consideration, the fact that Helios did actually remember Icarus' thing. \"Don't you two have jobs to do?\" \"Of course. But The days are shorter in winter, so we've had more free time.\" \"But... it's only winter in the northern hemisphere...\" \"Yeah... the northern hemisphere is kind of where we are right now, Mop-Head.\" Sometimes Icarus is forced to take stock of his life and realize that, against all imaginable likeliness, he's arguing with two Greek gods about whether or not it's possible that they either are the sun, or drive it across the sky every day. He tries not to let the annoyance show on his face, but his effort apparently fails, because Helios and Apollo are nudging each other and grinning. They love these conversations; nothing entertains them more than watching Icarus try to figure out how their bullshit 'metaphysical astronomy' works. \"Look, Apollo, he's getting mad again!\" \"I'm not mad,\" Icarus says, testily. \"It just doesn't make sense. What about the sun in the southern hemisphere?\" \"First of all, as Helios pointed out, we're not in the southern hemisphere, hmm?\" \"And it's night there, anyway! C'mon, you know better than this, the sun is a day thing.\" \"Then why are you both here instead of up in the sky?!\" Icarus bursts out, making them both laugh out loud. \"Metaphysically, we are,\" Apollo says, not bothering to hide his amusement as he uses that word again. \"Yeah. In the metaphysical sky, we're working hard.\" \"But you're not! You're here, bothering me!\" \"What, you think we can't multitask?\" Icarus scowls and throws both hands into the air in frustration as they laugh at him again. \"Fine. Whatever. Have your fun.\" \"Oh, we are,\" Apollo teases. \"Aww, quit sulking, Icarus! C'mon, look! Here's our snowmen!\" They've arrived to an open area where the snow is cleared to only a little higher than knee-deep, as Apollo had said. From the looks of it, the snow was all used to create a couple of massive snow-sculptures, easily thirty feet high. One is a very Calvin-and-Hobbes-esque collection of several crude but evocative snowmen - one giant, roaring monster in the process of terrorizing two cowering, normal-sized snowmen, one with dreadlocks and the other with basically a bobcut, while a third normal-sized snowman with spiky hair charges bravely forward towards the monster. The other sculpture is a very incredibly detailed statue of Icarus, wearing that skimpy Greek chlamys Apollo loves (his privates are, blessedly, covered - it seems that both gods are adjusting their approach to seducing Icarus). Snow-Icarus has a few more muscles than real-Icarus ever will, but the face is startlingly his, a perfect likeness, as he gracefully stares upwards into the heavens. Not for the first or the last time, Icarus really hopes that the Google Earth satellite isn't prowling immediately overhead at the moment. \"You guys... really have too much time on your hands,\" he observes, staring flatly at the curve of his own ass, wondering how much time Apollo spent on this. \"Mine's the best, right?? It's got so much action!\" Apollo sighs heavily. \"I'll pretend the difference in skill is a matter of aesthetic choice; you're clearly trying to tap into a kind of primal/archetypal aesthetic. At least one hopes this in intentional. And yet, the clear falseness of your assemblage is laughable at best, though perhaps you address this yourself in the choice of material in relation to the form. Snow, after all, is impermanent, which implies that your preposterous scene is an ephemeral moment of wild imagination.\" Helios groans. \"Do any of those words even mean anything? Sometimes a thing can look the coolest even if it's not ~perfect~! And your statue is made outa snow too - \" \"I like them both,\" Icarus lies quickly, hoping to head off another argument. He knows by now that Apollo's snooty art critique was mostly just to needle Helios, but the natural progression of the argument is to point out that the snow-Icarus is impermanent too, and that implies that Icarus won't be young and... unrealistically beefy and handsome forever. Which is, well, true. He doesn't know if Apollo spends any time thinking about this fact or not, but he doesn't want the sometimes-moody god to have to address it here and now. Icarus isn't sure he's ready to hear their thoughts on the matter. So he claps his heavily-mittened hands together with some difficulty - the snow suit is extremely thick - and says \"Weren't we going sledding?\" His distraction works; the gods hurry him out of their makeshift art gallery and out to the slopes......Which are considerably steeper than Icarus had been imagining. This is clearly a mountain somewhere, tall and imposing, the slope at least hundreds of feet long, possibly as long as a mile, and seeming to Icarus' basiphobic mind as being almost a 90-degree angle to the ground. The gods give each other a brief glance and take either of his hands of one of their own. \"We have a three-man toboggan that Hermes stole for us,\" Helios says. \"We'd both be with you the whole way,\" Apollo adds. \"You wouldn't leave the ground even once!\" \"It would be considerably less dangerous than riding on Helios' chariot; if you survived that, this will be as peaceful as sitting on your couch at home, in comparison.\" \"Hey!!\" This joke manages to bring a reluctant, only slightly hysterical bark of laughter out of Icarus. \"Isn't that... kind of a hyperbole? I thought you were the god of truth!\" \"Exactly.\" \"Hey!!\" They coax him onto the sled. Icarus is sandwiched in the middle; Helios, with the smallest mortal form, is in front 'so you can take in the view without Apollo's hair in the way.' Apollo and his beautiful voluminous hair are behind Icarus. He doesn't want to admit it, but their presence does settle his nerves somewhat. Only somewhat, though, and the descent down the mountain is completely fucking terrifying and exhilarating and fast, so fucking fast!! The view of the snow-covered trees and the mountain peaks on either side fly past in a blur. Icarus has no idea how (or if!) Helios is controlling the toboggan, or how he plans to stop it. He clings tightly enough to the Titan that he must be crushing a few ribs. Behind him, Apollo is holding firmly to Icarus, his legs squeezing tight around him. The incline tapers off eventually, allowing them to drift to a gentle stop at the base of the slope, among a scattering of pines. Helios twists around to grin at Icarus. \"Well? Here you are; ya made it to the other end! What'd you think?\" Icarus looks at him stupidly and mutely for a moment, still too shocked to answer right away; then he slumps back against Apollo and laughs in a relieved release of nerves. \"Haha! Y-yeah, it was - it was all right!\" Helios whoops and gathers Icarus' legs in his arms, hauling him onto his back as Icarus clings to his shoulders. \"SWEET! Bring the sled up, Apollo, we're goin' again!!\" He races back up the slope, with Icarus on his back, running atop the snow and up the incline faster than could ever be natural. It almost feels like flying. Icarus is laughing by the time they reach the top. They go down the slope a few more times, always with Icarus in the middle, taking turns on who gets to carry him back up. They eventually leave him under the trees, briefly, with instructions not to peek, while they make a surprise for him. Icarus lays back in the snow. He doesn't have work or class, but he should probably be studying. That's what he always used to do when he had any free moment: working, constantly, on something. He'd never have gone out to play in the snow, before these gods showed up and started basically kidnapping him. The... metaphysical sun is starting to set; or perhaps it only has gone down behind the tallest mountain peaks. It's getting noticeably colder, but his snowsuit is sufficient for now. Still, he'll have to tell the sun gods it's time for this fragile mortal to go back soon. He lies there, breathing in the sharp air, scented by pine and snow, and makes a few snow angels for no other reason than he's already lying down. They come back for him after about ten or fifteen minutes. They both do a double-take at the snow angels, but make no comment, choosing instead to blindfold him with the extra length of his scarf and lead him to their surprise. When they remove the blindfold, he sees, in the last of the setting sun, that they've made a to-scale replication of Apollo's temple at Delphi, out of snow. Complete with 'Know Thyself' carved into it. \"A reconstruction,\" Apollo says, looking wistful. \"Minus the stray cats,\" Helios adds. They wander through and the gods share a few stories they think might interest Icarus: about Python; about various historical figures that wandered through Delphi, including Aesop; about Helios' favorite stray cat, named Gobsmack by the Titan. Eventually Icarus begins shivering, and as the sun gods can't release their heat without melting the snow around them and possibly causing an avalanche, they gather him up and take him back to his apartment, where Icarus makes his contribution to the snow day by making hot chocolate for everyone. He dreams of flying that night, and it's the first time in - well, ever, that it's not a nightmare.",

      "And your statue is made outa snow too - \" \"I like them both,\" Icarus lies quickly, hoping to head off another argument.",
      "He knows by now that Apollo's snooty art critique was mostly just to needle Helios, but the natural progression of the argument is to point out that the snow-Icarus is impermanent too, and that implies that Icarus won't be young and... unrealistically beefy and handsome forever.",
      "Which is, well, true.",
      "He doesn't know if Apollo spends any time thinking about this fact or not, but he doesn't want the sometimes-moody god to have to address it here and now.",
      "Icarus isn't sure he's ready to hear their thoughts on the matter.",
      "So he claps his heavily-mittened hands together with some difficulty - the snow suit is extremely thick - and says \"Weren't we going sledding?\"",
      "His distraction works; the gods hurry him out of their makeshift art gallery and out to the slopes......Which are considerably steeper than Icarus had been imagining.",
      "This is clearly a mountain somewhere, tall and imposing, the slope at least hundreds of feet long, possibly as long as a mile, and seeming to Icarus' basiphobic mind as being almost a 90-degree angle to the ground.",
      "The gods give each other a brief glance and take either of his hands of one of their own.",
      "\"We have a three-man toboggan that Hermes stole for us,\" Helios says.",
      "\"We'd both be with you the whole way,\" Apollo adds.",
      "\"You wouldn't leave the ground even once!\"",
      "\"It would be considerably less dangerous than riding on Helios' chariot; if you survived that, this will be as peaceful as sitting on your couch at home, in comparison.\"",
      "\"Hey!!\"",
      "This joke manages to bring a reluctant, only slightly hysterical bark of laughter out of Icarus.",
      "\"Isn't that... kind of a hyperbole?",
      "I thought you were the god of truth!\"",
      "\"Exactly.\"",
      "\"Hey!!\"",
      "They coax him onto the sled.",
      "Icarus is sandwiched in the middle; Helios, with the smallest mortal form, is in front 'so you can take in the view without Apollo's hair in the way.'",
      "Apollo and his beautiful voluminous hair are behind Icarus.",
      "He doesn't want to admit it, but their presence does settle his nerves somewhat.",
      "Only somewhat, though, and the descent down the mountain is completely fucking terrifying and exhilarating and fast, so fucking fast!!",
      "The view of the snow-covered trees and the mountain peaks on either side fly past in a blur.",
      "Icarus has no idea how (or if!)",
      "Helios is controlling the toboggan, or how he plans to stop it.",
      "He clings tightly enough to the Titan that he must be crushing a few ribs.",
      "Behind him, Apollo is holding firmly to Icarus, his legs squeezing tight around him.",
      "The incline tapers off eventually, allowing them to drift to a gentle stop at the base of the slope, among a scattering of pines.",
      "Helios twists around to grin at Icarus.",
      "\"Well?",
      "Here you are; ya made it to the other end!",
      "What'd you think?\"",
      "Icarus looks at him stupidly and mutely for a moment, still too shocked to answer right away; then he slumps back against Apollo and laughs in a relieved release of nerves.",
      "\"Haha!",
      "Y-yeah, it was - it was all right!\"",
      "Helios whoops and gathers Icarus' legs in his arms, hauling him onto his back as Icarus clings to his shoulders.",
      "\"SWEET!",
      "Bring the sled up, Apollo, we're goin' again!!\"",
      "He races back up the slope, with Icarus on his back, running atop the snow and up the incline faster than could ever be natural.",
      "It almost feels like flying.",
      "Icarus is laughing by the time they reach the top.",
      "They go down the slope a few more times, always with Icarus in the middle, taking turns on who gets to carry him back up.",
      "They eventually leave him under the trees, briefly, with instructions not to peek, while they make a surprise for him.",
      "Icarus lays back in the snow.",
      "He doesn't have work or class, but he should probably be studying.",
      "That's what he always used to do when he had any free moment: working, constantly, on something.",
      "He'd never have gone out to play in the snow, before these gods showed up and started basically kidnapping him.",
      "The... metaphysical sun is starting to set; or perhaps it only has gone down behind the tallest mountain peaks.",
      "It's getting noticeably colder, but his snowsuit is sufficient for now.",
      "Still, he'll have to tell the sun gods it's time for this fragile mortal to go back soon.",
      "He lies there, breathing in the sharp air, scented by pine and snow, and makes a few snow angels for no other reason than he's already lying down.",
      "They come back for him after about ten or fifteen minutes.",
      "They both do a double-take at the snow angels, but make no comment, choosing instead to blindfold him with the extra length of his scarf and lead him to their surprise.",
      "When they remove the blindfold, he sees, in the last of the setting sun, that they've made a to-scale replication of Apollo's temple at Delphi, out of snow.",
      "Complete with 'Know Thyself' carved into it.",
      "\"A reconstruction,\" Apollo says, looking wistful.",
      "\"Minus the stray cats,\" Helios adds.",
      "They wander through and the gods share a few stories they think might interest Icarus: about Python; about various historical figures that wandered through Delphi, including Aesop; about Helios' favorite stray cat, named Gobsmack by the Titan.",
      "Eventually Icarus begins shivering, and as the sun gods can't release their heat without melting the snow around them and possibly causing an avalanche, they gather him up and take him back to his apartment, where Icarus makes his contribution to the snow day by making hot chocolate for everyone.",
      "He dreams of flying that night, and it's the first time in - well, ever, that it's not a nightmare."

    "text": "9 April - Vimy Ridge Day. A memorial to the Battle of Vimy Ridge in France in 1917: a great tactical success by the Canadian forces in that war. It's not the kind of holiday that has a lot of significance to Icarus, though he dutifully makes a donation to the veteran's fund boxes he sees throughout the city. He's not a soldier, almost certainly never will be, either. One of his sisters is considering seeking a commission after she graduates, but she hasn't committed yet and no one else in his family has served. So, it's not something that registers to him often. Icarus does make some effort to be mindful of the holiday, but... well, he has his classes, and his jobs, and the freeloading Greek gods in his apartment. It keeps his mind occupied. He's out in the park in the center of the city now, walking Smork and Troll; two fat poodles. Their endurance has improved a bit since they started walking with Icarus for exercise, but they still need a break about halfway through, and they're all sitting on a park bench now, and Icarus is taking a welcome moment to stare into space and think about nothing much. \"You Icarus?\" The voice, which pitches low and gruff, is enough to snap Icarus out of his haze. It sounds like it belongs to some kind of biker hooligan, and that's exactly the kind of person who's glaring at him from the sidewalk. This guy must weigh as much as a gorilla, and is wearing a muscle shirt and fatigues that show that he's built like a tank. His deeply tanned skin is covered in tattoos that seem to follow a barbed-wire-and-flames theme, and piercings adorn his face. Everything about his face and posture suggests unfriendliness. Shit. \"Uh........\" Icarus is one hundred percent expecting to be mugged, kidnapped or murdered, and flinches back when the towering man thrusts his fist in towards Icarus. \"Yo. Heard a lot about you.\" They freeze like that, Icarus half-raising his hands in defense, and the guy holding his fist out. \"....Fist bump, idiot,\" the guy finally growls out like a threat. \"Oh.\" Icarus complies, gingerly, noticing that the guy's knuckles are bruised and scarred. \"Uh... well... who are you?\" \"Call me Enyalios.\" Introductions done, the guy takes a seat with no further ado, manspreading across the entire rest of the bench, though Icarus doubts that anyone was likely to sit next to him anyway. Smork and Troll are both wagging their tails furiously and crowding over to him; they receive some absent-minded pets. The guy - Enyalios - is entirely nonchalant, like he's already met Icarus. It's actually that familiarity that clues Icarus in who he's talking to, even before he hears the clearly Greek-sounding name. He still thinks he better check to be sure: \"Um... are you... an Olympian?\" \"A god, yeah. God of courage and manliness, and some other stuff.\" \"Wow, you really - \" Icarus is about to say 'you really have a god for damn near everything,' but realizes that could seem rude. He hastily corrects himself mid-sentence: \"... you really look manly, I can tell!\" Not a great save. Icarus cringes at the awkwardness as Enyalios snickers. \"Great to hear it. Thanks for the feedback, man.\" Icarus tries to rally, still blushing. \"So, um... what... brings you here?\" \"Saw the Sun Assholes' boyfriend sitting with some dogs and thought I'd say hi.\" \"Oh - wow, it seems like everyone's heard of me from them.\" Smork and Troll have now climbed the bench and are sitting basically in Enyalios' lap. He lets them, and starts feeding them some jerky treats that he's materialized out of nowhere. \"Yeah, well, you're all they talk about. Can't get 'em to shut up about you. Couple of us have bingo sheets - when they bitch about your schedule, or they tell everyone what you're learning about astronomy which they think is the cutest thing. Or when they try to one-up each other about who made you blush more or Apollo complains about how you roll your shirt sleeves or whatever. Pretty sure everyone in Olympus knows about you by now.\" \"..Oh...\" Enyalios must pick up on Icarus' uneasiness because he casts an inquisitive frown in his direction. \"Is that a problem? You want 'em to stop? I can punch them for you - \" \"Ahh, n-no, not necessary!\" Icarus puts up his hands quickly. \"I just - you guys are all - sort of - intimidating, a little?\" Enyalios is squinting at him a little, and Icarus fights the urge to squirm. He wonders if a god of courage can sense that Icarus isn't telling the whole truth here - that Icarus is uneasy because he's afraid of when the other shoe inevitably drops. The awkward silence lasts only a few moments before Enyalios grunts and feeds both dogs another jerky piece. \"Yeah, well. We have that effect, I guess. Me more than most.\" \"You are pretty... manly,\" Icarus jokes clumsily. Enyalios rolls his eyes. \"For what that's worth. Being manly changes every damn place you go, and there's trends that change every few years - it used to be manly to wear pink, now it's not... fuckin' pain in the ass. Not that courage is any easier, I guess.\" \"No, I'd guess not,\" Icarus says quietly. \"That's why I'm here, technically. There's an event.\" \"Oh - Vimy Ridge Day?\" \"Yeah, that's it.\" \"That's - wouldn't that be Ares? The god of war?\" Enyalios makes a noncommittal grunt again and cracks his knuckles. \"It's really more Athena's thing. Vimy Ridge was a tactical victory. Lots of meticulous planning and shit. Any soldier deals with courage and passion though, and the fighting spirit. All the planning in the world doesn't change the fact that it's fuckin' scary to charge into battle, and hope that your plan and fighting ability is better than the other guys'. You need both, and a lot of those guys were kids your age and needed the encouragement. Patriotism and a plan will only get so far before you need something more. It's true in life, anywhere, people need more than a great plan to go through with scary shit, you need fighting spirit too! Uh...so... yeah, I'm here too.\" Icarus notices that Enyalios didn't actually answer the question, exactly, of whether Ares is here. \"Hey, listen,\" Enyalios says, abruptly: \"Wanna hear some embarrassing stories about the sun assholes?\" He doesn't wait before launching in. Icarus isn't surprised when Apollo arrives shortly during the tale of the first Olympics: \"...and his chiton fell down, left him bare-assed naked, and he played the whole thing off like he meant for it to happen because running naked is some big advantage, so then everyone had to compete naked. Fuckin' dumbass.\" \"That was a malicious rumor started by Hermes, and I would appreciate it if you wouldn't waste your time filling my lover's head with lies!\" Apollo says hotly. \"Aren't you supposed to be working now, anyway? Get out there! Athena's probably pissed at you by now!\" \"Like she's ever not pissed at me,\" Enyalios mutters, rolling his eyes, not looking at Apollo. \"Fine, whatever.\" He gets up, gently detaching Troll and Smork from his lap and giving them another jerky piece before jamming his hands in his pockets and slouching over. \"Later, kid,\" he says to Icarus. Icarus stands up too, transferring both leashes to one hand and quickly sticking out his fist. \"Good to meet you, Enyalios!\" There's a long, embarrassing pause, while Apollo stares at Enyalios with raised eyebrows, and Enyalios looks awkwardly at Icarus. \"Uh... fist bump?\" Icarus tries. Enyalios' face cracks into a grin suddenly, which is nearly as terrifying as his scowl. He stretches out one bruised fist and touches it to Icarus' own. \"Take care, asshole,\" he says, and vanishes. Icarus is already waving at empty air, and quickly puts his hand down. He smiles up at Apollo. \"If you take one of these dogs' leashes, we can hold hands,\" he says, seeing that Apollo still looks annoyed. It works; the sun god's face glows slightly as he complies. His hand is warm on the Canadian spring day - which effectively means, still winter. \"He seemed nice,\" Icarus ventures after a moment. \"Enyalios, I mean.\" \"...That was Ares.\" Icarus fights a chill in his spine. He knows better - he clearly knows better. He just spoke to the god, while he was feeding jerky to two fat poodles and telling a story of how Apollo mooned the first Olympic Games audience. The stereotype can't be true... but, the name is still scary. It evokes a mental image of savagery, bloodshed, brutal fighting... \"I... kinda guessed that,\" Icarus says. \"He wouldn't say where Ares was for the Vimy Ridge Day. But he called himself Enyalios...\" \"That's one of his epithets. I suppose he's aware of his reputation. Perhaps he didn't want to intimidate you.\" Apollo sighs. \"He's come a long way from his early days.\" \"He said he was the god of courage.\" \"He is, among other things.\" \"Yeah, he said he was the god of manliness too. Glad he didn't try to give me any pointers.\" Apollo is startled into an (elegant) bark of laughter at that.",

    "text": "Helios, Apollo, Hermes, Persephone, and someone he's never met before are all lined up in Icarus' living room. Their postures are contrite, but their faces clearly betray their amusement. Icarus stands before them, arms crossed over his chest and frowning sternly. \"Okay. I know that it's April Fool's Day and Easter at the same time, but this is ridiculous and it's gotten out of hand. So I am firmly but respectfully going to insist on a return to status quo before I go out of my mind... Helios!\" The Titan of the Sun is snickering. \"Sorry, Mop-Head, it's just really hard to take you seriously when you're dressed like that.\" \"Right. That's the first order of business.\" He points at Hermes, who pretends to be shocked and confused. \"I need my clothes back. Okay? All of them that you replaced with embarrassing Easter costumes.\" \"You know, I was gonna make you wear the sexy version...\" \"And I am truly, sincerely grateful that you didn't. But please. I need my clothes back.\" Hermes' smile slowly widens before he nods. \"Okay, sure, you got it, Icarus! All your clothes back. Just like you asked.\" And Icarus knows, absolutely knows, that the god is going to turn around and do something different now - probably something worse. They probably all will, actually. WHY ARE THESE GODS IN HIS LIFE. No use dwelling on it. He takes a deep breath and turns to the goddess next to Hermes. \"Queen Persephone -\" \"It should be Kore, up here.\" \"O-oh?\" \"Right, I'm the Goddess of Springtime now!\" \"Okay... uh, Queen Kore... I really love all the flowers, but...there's too many.\" The entire apartment is stuffed with flowers. They cover every available surface area not already claimed by the fruits of the other gods' pranks. Most of them are standard springtime flowers -lilies, carnations, hyacinths... but some of them are, well, odd. \"I know that every flower is precious and wonderful and I love them all too. But the ones that look like dead people, the ones that look sexy lips or naked people - all the ones that look like genitals - they gotta go. And that one disgusting one in the bathroom has GOT to go.\" Pers-Kore pouts. \"But that one's my favorite! If you wait a few months for it to fruit, you'll get a really delicious berry that you can eat or use as a face wash - \" \"Queen Kore, I'm sorry, but I will never know what that berry tastes like because I don't want a flower that smells like the back endow a cow to bloom in my bathroom for months. They gotta go. All the gross and weird ones have to go.\" \"Okay, okay... spoilsport...\" \"And Apollo. I appreciate that you replaced all the songs on my phone with recordings of you singing Easter music. Your voice is just, so amazing. But I miss listening to my old music, so put 'em back.\" \"I like this dominant Icarus,\" Helios says, smirking. \"Very hot, Mop-Head.\" \"And you!\" Icarus flings a finger at Helios. \"All these animals! What - Helios - There are laws! I can't keep all these animals here!\" \"Oh, untwist your panties, Icarus, I know that. I'll bring the baby chicks and lambs back to my farm. Sheesh, kid.\" \"Do you need me to reclaim Malaina, then?\" The unidentified person is speaking. Icarus has been reluctant to address her,directly - something about her makes him shy, and he fights a blush from his face. \"W-who - uh...\" \"I'm Aphrodite,\" says the goddess. Her voice is like the light, playful tinkling of a wind chime. The lady is soft and round, with long wavy pink that seems to sway gently with each movement from her, and bright teal eyes and mottled skin tones and Icarus is gay! He doesn't even like women like that!! It must be some terrible power of hers, to make people have a crush on her, or at least be enthralled by her. \"Rabbits are sacred to me... you know, because they have so much sex. So when Hermes told me of his Easter-themed plans to prank you, I thought I'd contribute in a small way. But I can take Malaina back with me, if she's distressing you...\" Malaina, then, must be the tiny adorable black lop bunny that turned up in his living room. \"N-no,uh, Lady Aphrodite, I was gonna say that I'm keeping the bunny. She's cute, and quiet. Thank you for the gift, I like her.\" All the other gods and goddesses start to complain about how he didn't appreciate their gifts bathe crosses his arms again and scowls. \"No! All the rest of it has to go. Starting with the dumb Easter costumes,Hermes. Please and thank you. I don't want to offend anyone but I insist.\" They all start shuffling off to (hopefully) undo their pranks, all chuckling still.",

    "text": "His birthday falls on a Saturday, which might mean a full day of relaxation and partying for other people; but for Icarus it only means that the ratio of work to schoolwork is flipped. He'd taken his neighbor's beagle, Turk, for his morning walk earlier, and then put in three hours at the coffee shop. Now he's wrapping up four hours at the cashier job. This day has netted him... he calculates in his head...about enough money for 1/2 of his monthly grocery expenses (a lower number thanks to his benefits from working the library), or 1/9 of his rent, or 1/252 of his current student loans. Ugh. Icarus at least has some birthday treats to look forward to now that his shift is finally up. Mostly baked goods, including some from the coffee shop (which was almost certainly 'not quite stolen' by Blake) and homemade things from Elverna and Leroy. They'd also given him a gift card for a restaurant, and all of this actually reduces his grocery bill even further, so Icarus is in a good mood when he walks into the back room to punch out for the day. This good mood wobbles, along with the apparent fabric of reality, as soon as he's entered his employee ID number into the keypad: there's a weird, visible.... shimmering of the air around him, accompanied by the sound like a harp strum, and everything takes on a pinkish sheen. The shimmer and harp music is over in a flash, but the pink haze remains. Icarus turns around slowly, looking around with trepidation. Nothing immediately seems amiss, except for the weird pink light, and the sudden silence. Before he'd keyed in his ID, there had been the usual noise of a busy store filled with workers and shoppers and in the back, machinery running. Now, as he pads uneasily through the back room, his footsteps are easily audible in the total silence- \"SURPRISE! HAPPY BIRTHDAY!!\" Icarus gasps and stumbles back against a metal rack containing boxed mac 'n cheese as a half-dozen or so guys all jump out and shout at him, huge grins on their faces, as they all start shouting or singing a number of different things. They all seem to have angel wings. \"Haha! Icarus, hey! Happy birthday, man!\" \" Why was he born so beautiful, why was he born at all? He's no fucking use to anyone, no fuckin use at all...\" \"We decided against that one, dumbass!\" \" Hey, they say it's your birthday! Well it's my birthday too, yeah! They say-\" \"Guys, guys, stop, he looks terrified,\" one of them observes, holding up his hand. The singing and shouting stops, and they all look at Icarus critically, where he's slumped against the rack and watching them with wide eyes. \"If you say so, Hy,\" one of them says doubtfully. \"He looks pretty neutral to me. Maybe surprised.\" \"That's... that's.. just my usual face,\" Icarus manages. \"For all occasions. Um. Uh... do I... know you gentlemen... oh!\" He's pushed himself away from the rack and notices for the first time that his stumble had toppled over some of the boxed pasta... but that they're hanging in the air, frozen in place, not falling. He looks back over at the guys. \"Neutral bordering on annoyed!\" The same one guesses confidently. \"You don't know us now,\" says another one, stepping forward with a smile. He's got reddish eyes and pink, fluffy-looking hair atop a soft round face, and the most perfectly innocent expression Icarus has ever seen, which raises his suspicions immediately. His wings are the largest, even though he's not particularly taller than anyone. \"But you knew us before. I'm Eros... love squad leader!\" He makes a little heart shape with his hands. \"Himeros,\" says a guy with an Elvis pompadour, also making the heart shape. \"Impetuous love.\" \"Hedylogos. Sweet talk,\" this guy has dimples and striking blue eyes. This is the guy who's been guessing his facial expressions. He makes the heart shape too; must be part of some squad pose. \"Hymenaios... the bridal hymn.\" Peacock-printed silk shirt and an enormous afro. \"Uh, I didn't actually work with you that much. Or like, at all.\" \"Me either,\" says a tall and shockingly beautiful....person. Their hair is long and held in a single thick braid, which is draped casually over their shoulder. They're standing casually, hands in pockets, but takes them out for the heart shape. \"Hermaphroditus. Erote of genderqueer love.\" \"...Oh! Wow, I didn't know... I'm glad to know there's a representative!\" \"Aww. That one's 'neutral with a touch of empathetic happiness,'\" observes Hedylogos with a grin. \"You didn't really have as much to do with me either - uh, Anteros, 'love returned,'\" the guy with long hair and an undercut - very Viking chic, or like Sokka's wolf tail. He hurriedly does the heart thing and continues in urgent tones. \"I had to wait on those two assholes to see where they stood. But look, the flip side is 'unrequited love,' right, and since we all know how your story turned out, I can totally go fight them for you and I will, any time you want, just say the word, they won't even see it coming - \" \"Right, right, and uh - I'm Pothos.\" The one wearing a man-bun and a soulful expression on his face - he looks more than a little bit like Kit Harrington - discreetly nudges Anteros aside. He makes the heart shape and looks at Icarus soulfully and expectantly. Icarus looks back at him blankly and then hesitantly makes the heart shape back. \"I'm - pleased to meet you...?\" he says uncertainly. They all smile a little at his heart gesture, though Pothos shakes his head with a sigh. \"He doesn't even remember me!\" \"He doesn't remember anything at all,\" Eros says, \"...maybe for the best.\" \"I'm longing, or pining,\" Pothos informs Icarus. \"I was... with you, often, in prison.\" \"...Oh...?\" Eros jumps in here: \"And, our guest of honor - the lovely and esteemed Prince Ganymede, the Cupbearer.\" \"Oh, knock it off,\" says another incredibly beautiful person, flashing a smile. Honestly, it's a little odd how attractive the entire group is, but this guy takes the cake - everything about him commands attention. He has warmly tanned kin and lightly curling golden hair; wide eyes with thick eyelashes and sparkling green irises. He looks younger than the rest, and is the only one without wings. This, then, is the mortal that Zeus chose to be his lover. One of his last lovers, from what Icarus can tell, or near to it. And the only one to be immortalized. He made it to Olympus. Ganymede doesn't make the heart shape. He holds up two fingers in a peace-sign greeting instead. \"It's good to see you again, Icarus,\" Ganymede says. \"And... really great to see you're doing so well.\" \"Well, it's lovely to be....meeting you all... again,\" Icarus says awkwardly, making them laugh again. He's nervous; even though they all seem to be very friendly and jovial, he knows it's coming. They're going to talk about What Happened Before. Sure enough: \"Well, buddy, we all wanted to come by for your very special birthday!\" Eros is resting one elbow on a pallet nearby and grinning at him. \"Special? Uh - \" Icarus tries to think. This isn't really a milestone birthday... \"You finally outlived your previous incarnation!\" Ahh. There it is. The other Erotes cheer again. \"So you're off to a great start this time!\" Pothos says encouragingly. \"You're that much older and wiser, so you'll be better able to make the right decisions for yourself,\" Hermaphroditus adds. \"Right, and you're already better about not rushing straight into it,\" Himeros chimes in. \"Though, granted, you didn't know they even existed until last year...\" \"Ah, 'neutral with a touch of uneasiness',\" says Hedylogos, watching him. Icarus does feel uneasy. No one's ever addressed it so directly before. Even the other gods who have met him, who must know what happened - they still have addressed him mainly in terms of who he is today, rather than who he was before. Probably because even if the gods knew of him before, they didn't know him personally. Other than the sun gods themselves... and these Erotes, apparently. Ganymede steps forward. \"Hey, listen... I know it must feel strange. But we're all truly excited to meet you, and to see you're doing well. Honestly, you have no bigger supporters in Olympus than the Erotes.\" \"We were all really cheering for you,\" Eros adds, and the others nod in assent. \"And we're cheering for you now!\" says Hymenaios. \"Yes, we really want you to be happy-\" Ganymede starts, but is interrupted by Anteros. \"And what happened before will not happen again. That is absolutely certain.\" He looks as though he might be imagining himself beating the shit out of the sun gods. Icarus wonders if he ought to say something to defend them, but, well - Apollo and Helios can take care of themselves, he's sure. They've had centuries of practice at surviving infighting among the other immortals. \"Right! So, since we've all gotten the dull introductions and the depressing backstory out of the way,\" At some point Eros had hopped up on top of the break room fridge and he toes open the door, \"... let's bust open this champagne I got from Dio.\" \"Oh - I don't think I can stay too long? I know Apollo and Helios wanted to do something fun for my birthday for dinner,\" Icarus starts to say, then glances at where the boxes of macaroni are still hanging in the air. \"Although, I guess that's not an issue...?\" \"Yeah, we took care of that,\" Himeros boasts. \"You know how when you see someone you really like, and it feels like time stops? That's our party trick!\" Icarus looks around doubtfully. \"Does it really last this long?\" \"Ahaha, nope! We're totally cheating the system,\" Eros grins. He has a bottle of champagne in hand and is just on the cusp of uncorking it. \"Let's do this!! Love Squad Party Time!! Icarus, do the heart!\" Icarus isn't sure what that means immediately, but then he sees everyone else making the shape with their hands. He finally laughs slightly and holds up his own hands in the heart shape, to a raucous cheer and another shout of \"HAPPY BIRTHDAY\" and the splash of champagne getting everywhere as the cork goes flying out. He laughs again and there's the sound of everyone cooing at once. \"There's that killer smile!\" \"Damn, Icarus, that's fricking stunning!\" \"It's a good thing your face is neutral most of the time! A smile like that would slay everyone if it was turned on too much!\" \"Oh... come on..\" Icarus manages, blushing and trying to hide his face as his grin widens and they all laugh at him again. From then on, it's just champagne and ribald jokes and songs, and everyone sharing stories of Love Gone Wrong (but only the funny stories, or ones that had a happy ending). They have a game of Never Have I Ever, trying hard to catch out Ganymede, who seems used to this by now. It's a blast, and Icarus laughs in spite of himself. They give him gifts: a book of cheesy pick-up lines; a ton of chocolate; some cologne; a t-shirt covered in hearts and signed by all of them; a box from Eros with instructions to only open it 'when the time is right.' \"H-how... the hell.. am I supposed to know when that is??\" Icarus demands, already more than a little intoxicated. \"You'll know, young grasshopper,\" Eros intones solemnly, his eyes crinkling ominously at the corners. Hymenaios and Hermaphroditus give him gift certificates to restaurants, with apologies that their particular gifts probably wouldn't be much use to him. This goes on for a few hours, and also in no time at all, thanks to the time trick. Eros and Ganymede drop off a very drunk Icarus, along with his gifts, at his apartment, about a minute and a half after his shift had ended. \"Eros! I might have guessed you'd have no sense of responsibility, but Ganymede, I thought better of you!\" Apollo starts to lecture, taking Icarus into his arms, but Ganymede cuts him off. \"You'll be pleased to know that Icarus is a very affectionate drunk.\" \"You guyssssssss!! You guysss it's my birthday!!\" Icarus slurs, beaming up at Apollo and hugging him tightly. \"We brought him back when he started asking about you two. You're welcome.\" They leave as Icarus is smooshing Apollo's cheeks into a fish face and laughing. ------- Ganymede looks in the closet set in the back of his chambers. His rooms are a suite built into the palace - fairly ornate, and exceedingly comfortable. His closet is quite expansive... though he doesn't often wear them in the execution of his duties as cupbearer, he does enjoy dressing up in nice clothes, and Zeus never says no to him. Zeus loves to dress him up, too; and, well, some of the Never Have I Evers that the Erotes honed in on include stories of the elaborate games the two of them sometimes play together. That sometimes involve costumes. This time, though, the item he's looking for is not elaborate at all. He finds it, eventually: a simple chiton, clasped in place with a simple brooch in the shape of a heart. The 'robe of office,' as it were, of the Erotes. Icarus had been meant to be his first champion. The one who would solidify Ganymede's place as the Erote of romantic aspiration. That feeling of wanting to be worthy of the love of someone you admire. The way Ganymede had felt, upon learning that his lover was Zeus the Almighty. That motivation is a thing of beauty, he still feels. Like all things, it can go too far, but that feeling that the person you admire is the most wonderful, most amazing person, and you want nothing more than to make them happy, to get to a place where you have earned a smile from them... Icarus fell. His aspirations were rejected. Ganymede had been utterly crushed. He'd been heartbroken on Icarus' behalf; and as a fledgling immortal, the failure had come at a sensitive time for him and had destroyed his ambition. He'd never tried to take up the mantle again, not in thousands of years. But now... He's talked to Eros, and they agree: this is an opportunity. The situation has been reversed. The sun gods... can prove themselves worthy. Icarus can be his champion again, but from the other side. Making him Ganymede's first agent, as well. Ganymede puts on the chiton and smiles at himself in the mirror. When Zeus comes in, later, he finds Ganymede standing at the window, looking over the cloudscape, still wearing the chiton. \"Well, well! And who is this dashing young man gracing my presence?\" Zeus asks. He knows exactly what that chiton is, and can't keep the grin out of his voice. \"How good of you to notice... thank you for the kind words,\" Ganymede says, turning around loftily. \"Kaki, I believe you have the privilege once again of addressing the Erote of Romantic Aspiration.\"",
    "sentences": [
      "His birthday falls on a Saturday, which might mean a full day of relaxation and partying for other people; but for Icarus it only means that the ratio of work to schoolwork is flipped.",

      "Now he's wrapping up four hours at the cashier job.",
      "This day has netted him... he calculates in his head...about enough money for 1/2 of his monthly grocery expenses (a lower number thanks to his benefits from working the library), or 1/9 of his rent, or 1/252 of his current student loans.",
      "Ugh.",
      "Icarus at least has some birthday treats to look forward to now that his shift is finally up.",
      "Mostly baked goods, including some from the coffee shop (which was almost certainly 'not quite stolen' by Blake) and homemade things from Elverna and Leroy.",
      "They'd also given him a gift card for a restaurant, and all of this actually reduces his grocery bill even further, so Icarus is in a good mood when he walks into the back room to punch out for the day.",
      "This good mood wobbles, along with the apparent fabric of reality, as soon as he's entered his employee ID number into the keypad: there's a weird, visible.... shimmering of the air around him, accompanied by the sound like a harp strum, and everything takes on a pinkish sheen.",
      "The shimmer and harp music is over in a flash, but the pink haze remains.",
      "Icarus turns around slowly, looking around with trepidation.",
      "Nothing immediately seems amiss, except for the weird pink light, and the sudden silence.",
      "Before he'd keyed in his ID, there had been the usual noise of a busy store filled with workers and shoppers and in the back, machinery running.",
      "Now, as he pads uneasily through the back room, his footsteps are easily audible in the total silence- \"SURPRISE!",
      "HAPPY BIRTHDAY!!\"",
      "Icarus gasps and stumbles back against a metal rack containing boxed mac 'n cheese as a half-dozen or so guys all jump out and shout at him, huge grins on their faces, as they all start shouting or singing a number of different things.",
      "They all seem to have angel wings.",
      "\"Haha!",
      "Icarus, hey!",
      "Happy birthday, man!\" \" Why was he born so beautiful, why was he born at all?",
      "He's no fucking use to anyone, no fuckin use at all...\" \"We decided against that one, dumbass!\" \" Hey, they say it's your birthday!",
      "Well it's my birthday too, yeah!",
      "They say-\" \"Guys, guys, stop, he looks terrified,\" one of them observes, holding up his hand.",
      "The singing and shouting stops, and they all look at Icarus critically, where he's slumped against the rack and watching them with wide eyes.",
      "\"If you say so, Hy,\" one of them says doubtfully.",
      "\"He looks pretty neutral to me.",
      "Maybe surprised.\"",
      "\"That's... that's.. just my usual face,\" Icarus manages.",

      "\"Neutral bordering on annoyed!\"",
      "The same one guesses confidently.",
      "\"You don't know us now,\" says another one, stepping forward with a smile.",
      "He's got reddish eyes and pink, fluffy-looking hair atop a soft round face, and the most perfectly innocent expression Icarus has ever seen, which raises his suspicions immediately.",
      "His wings are the largest, even though he's not particularly taller than anyone.",
      "\"But you knew us before.",
      "I'm Eros... love squad leader!\"",

      "\"You didn't really have as much to do with me either - uh, Anteros, 'love returned,'\" the guy with long hair and an undercut - very Viking chic, or like Sokka's wolf tail.",
      "He hurriedly does the heart thing and continues in urgent tones.",
      "\"I had to wait on those two assholes to see where they stood.",
      "But look, the flip side is 'unrequited love,' right, and since we all know how your story turned out, I can totally go fight them for you and I will, any time you want, just say the word, they won't even see it coming - \" \"Right, right, and uh - I'm Pothos.\"",
      "The one wearing a man-bun and a soulful expression on his face - he looks more than a little bit like Kit Harrington - discreetly nudges Anteros aside.",
      "He makes the heart shape and looks at Icarus soulfully and expectantly.",
      "Icarus looks back at him blankly and then hesitantly makes the heart shape back.",
      "\"I'm - pleased to meet you...?\" he says uncertainly.",
      "They all smile a little at his heart gesture, though Pothos shakes his head with a sigh.",
      "\"He doesn't even remember me!\"",
      "\"He doesn't remember anything at all,\" Eros says, \"...maybe for the best.\"",

      "\"...Oh...?\"",

      "\"Oh, knock it off,\" says another incredibly beautiful person, flashing a smile.",
      "Honestly, it's a little odd how attractive the entire group is, but this guy takes the cake - everything about him commands attention.",
      "He has warmly tanned kin and lightly curling golden hair; wide eyes with thick eyelashes and sparkling green irises.",
      "He looks younger than the rest, and is the only one without wings.",
      "This, then, is the mortal that Zeus chose to be his lover.",
      "One of his last lovers, from what Icarus can tell, or near to it.",
      "And the only one to be immortalized.",
      "He made it to Olympus.",
      "Ganymede doesn't make the heart shape.",
      "He holds up two fingers in a peace-sign greeting instead.",
      "\"It's good to see you again, Icarus,\" Ganymede says.",
      "\"And... really great to see you're doing so well.\"",
      "\"Well, it's lovely to be....meeting you all... again,\" Icarus says awkwardly, making them laugh again.",
      "He's nervous; even though they all seem to be very friendly and jovial, he knows it's coming.",
      "They're going to talk about What Happened Before.",
      "Sure enough: \"Well, buddy, we all wanted to come by for your very special birthday!\"",
      "Eros is resting one elbow on a pallet nearby and grinning at him.",
      "\"Special?",
      "Uh - \" Icarus tries to think.",
      "This isn't really a milestone birthday...",
      "\"You finally outlived your previous incarnation!\"",
      "Ahh.",
      "There it is.",
      "The other Erotes cheer again.",
      "\"So you're off to a great start this time!\"",
      "Pothos says encouragingly.",
      "\"You're that much older and wiser, so you'll be better able to make the right decisions for yourself,\" Hermaphroditus adds.",
      "\"Right, and you're already better about not rushing straight into it,\" Himeros chimes in.",
      "\"Though, granted, you didn't know they even existed until last year...\" \"Ah, 'neutral with a touch of uneasiness',\" says Hedylogos, watching him.",
      "Icarus does feel uneasy.",
      "No one's ever addressed it so directly before.",
      "Even the other gods who have met him, who must know what happened - they still have addressed him mainly in terms of who he is today, rather than who he was before.",
      "Probably because even if the gods knew of him before, they didn't know him personally.",
      "Other than the sun gods themselves... and these Erotes, apparently.",
      "Ganymede steps forward.",
      "\"Hey, listen...",
      "I know it must feel strange.",
      "But we're all truly excited to meet you, and to see you're doing well.",
      "Honestly, you have no bigger supporters in Olympus than the Erotes.\"",
      "\"We were all really cheering for you,\" Eros adds, and the others nod in assent.",
      "\"And we're cheering for you now!\"",
      "says Hymenaios.",
      "\"Yes, we really want you to be happy-\" Ganymede starts, but is interrupted by Anteros.",
      "\"And what happened before will not happen again.",
      "That is absolutely certain.\"",
      "He looks as though he might be imagining himself beating the shit out of the sun gods.",
      "Icarus wonders if he ought to say something to defend them, but, well - Apollo and Helios can take care of themselves, he's sure.",
      "They've had centuries of practice at surviving infighting among the other immortals.",
      "\"Right!",
      "So, since we've all gotten the dull introductions and the depressing backstory out of the way,\" At some point Eros had hopped up on top of the break room fridge and he toes open the door, \"... let's bust open this champagne I got from Dio.\"",
      "\"Oh - I don't think I can stay too long?",
      "I know Apollo and Helios wanted to do something fun for my birthday for dinner,\" Icarus starts to say, then glances at where the boxes of macaroni are still hanging in the air.",
      "\"Although, I guess that's not an issue...?\"",
      "\"Yeah, we took care of that,\" Himeros boasts.",
      "\"You know how when you see someone you really like, and it feels like time stops?",
      "That's our party trick!\"",
      "Icarus looks around doubtfully.",
      "\"Does it really last this long?\"",
      "\"Ahaha, nope!",
      "We're totally cheating the system,\" Eros grins.",
      "He has a bottle of champagne in hand and is just on the cusp of uncorking it.",
      "\"Let's do this!!",
      "Love Squad Party Time!!",
      "Icarus, do the heart!\"",
      "Icarus isn't sure what that means immediately, but then he sees everyone else making the shape with their hands.",
      "He finally laughs slightly and holds up his own hands in the heart shape, to a raucous cheer and another shout of \"HAPPY BIRTHDAY\" and the splash of champagne getting everywhere as the cork goes flying out.",
      "He laughs again and there's the sound of everyone cooing at once.",
      "\"There's that killer smile!\"",
      "\"Damn, Icarus, that's fricking stunning!\"",
      "\"It's a good thing your face is neutral most of the time!",
      "A smile like that would slay everyone if it was turned on too much!\"",
      "\"Oh... come on..\"",
      "Icarus manages, blushing and trying to hide his face as his grin widens and they all laugh at him again.",
      "From then on, it's just champagne and ribald jokes and songs, and everyone sharing stories of Love Gone Wrong (but only the funny stories, or ones that had a happy ending).",
      "They have a game of Never Have I Ever, trying hard to catch out Ganymede, who seems used to this by now.",

      "This goes on for a few hours, and also in no time at all, thanks to the time trick.",
      "Eros and Ganymede drop off a very drunk Icarus, along with his gifts, at his apartment, about a minute and a half after his shift had ended.",

    "text": "Icarus finishes tying the stack in the back of his bicycle and waves at Leroy. The old man waves back, and Icarus climbs carefully on top of the bike and begins pedaling slowly down the road, towards the park. The baskets and bundles of white roses are heavy and make turning difficult, particularly where the sidewalks are covered in slush or ice, but Icarus is fairly well-practiced at this by now. He's not working, technically; in spite of his financial situation, Icarus had wanted to do this for free. It doesn't feel right to make money off of a memorial for murdered and abused women. (He's told Apollo and Helios that he's totally on the clock, though, and instructed Leroy and Elverna to tell them the same if it ever comes up, because he's mostly managed to get them to quit pestering him if he's earning a paycheck). A handful of people stop him on his way to the park, buying the roses, but the donations mostly pick up once he gets to the park. There, enough people stop him for flowers that he eventually stops trying to pedal, and gets off to walk beside the bike instead. The park is filled with candles and flowers. They're placed on the short stone walls along the sidewalks, and in makeshift memorials among the trees, sitting on cleared spaces in the snow. People mill around, talking quietly, waiting for the keynote speaker to arrive for the ceremony. This will be at the main memorial, in the center of the park, where a large board is printed with fourteen names: Genevieve Bergeron Helene Colgan Nathalie Croteau Barbara Daigneault Anne-Marie Edward Maud Haviernick Barbara Klucznik-Widajewicz Maryse Laganiere Maryse Leclair Anne-Marie Lemay Sonia Pelletier Michele Richard Anne St-Arneault Annie Turcotte This board is surrounded with stands containing informational packets and white ribbons that people tack on with the names of other women they know. Icarus' roses are added to the piles. The donations for the flowers he sells are going to a women's shelter near the flower shop. The attack happened a few years before Icarus was born. He has no memory of the shock of the event; and he grew up with the White Ribbon days as a regular part of his life. He notices with a jolt that the women were, for the most part, about the age he is now, when they were killed. Icarus doesn't need his sisters or mother as a sole reason to care about violence done to women, but it's impossible not to reflect on the risks posed to them. It bothers him to think about them having to worry about things he takes for granted; if he thinks about it too long, he becomes distressed at the idea of some angry, entitled asshole insulting them, assaulting them, killing them - and due to nothing they'd ever said or done. Just the roll of the dice that led to them being women. He'd asked Elverna about it earlier, while they were tying ribbons around the stems of the white roses. She's in her sixties (he thinks - he would never ask, of course, but he knows that she was Leroy's high school sweetheart, and that he'd been caught up in the October Crisis about two weeks after he'd enlisted in the Army), so Icarus had wondered if she thought things were getting any better. \"Without question,\" she'd said, \"at least around here. You wouldn't have believed the things that were legal when I was a girl. And at least you can talk about things now. So, it's changing.\" She smiles at him, tying off another ribbon. \"And there are so many more young people on board with it now, who don't want things to go back to the old days. Nice young men like Icarus who care about people!\" He doesn't feel like he's doing a lot of good. He's just a guy wandering around with a bike stacked high with roses. But it's nice to hear her optimism on the matter. \"Ah, Icarus!\" He hears a familiar voice, a few yards behind him, and he half-turns to see Athena approaching him. She's wearing a fitted leather jacket that he recognizes as usually being fully bedecked with pins for causes she cares about. Today, there is only the white ribbon pin. The jacket isn't really warm enough for a December day in Canada, but she did put on a stylish white scarf. Not that gods are all that beholden to the weather. \"May I exchange some currency for one of your roses?\" she asks in her usual precise manner. \"Of course,\" Icarus replies, steadying his bicycle with his hip as he seeks out a small bunch tied together with white silk. \"I had thought you would be here, and I'm pleased to see I'm right,\" she says, accepting the flowers and giving him a note and a few coins - he sees owls and Athena's face on the coins, which isn't a surprise; and Robert Borden's face on the note, which is a shock! - but she continues talking before he can comment. \"It's a nice turnout. Artemis will be glad to see it.\" \"Oh - is Artemis here, too?\" \"She's always here, at one of these kinds of events. The protection of young women is one of her domains.\" \"Oh.. I was going to say we should go say hi, but she must be busy...\" \"Ah. She's actually here metaphysically, at the moment. But I've already alerted her that she should stop by in person afterwards to say hello.\" Athena glances at him, and then giggles. It's an unexpected sound, coming from her. Icarus gives her a suspicious look, though he's unable to keep a small smile off his face at her mirth. \"...What's so funny?\" \"Apollo had observed that your eye twitches whenever someone discusses our metaphysical duties or presence. And now I've just confirmed it.\" Icarus huffs, trying to sound annoyed but mostly sounding amused. \"It doesn't make sense.\" \"Poor Icarus. Another philosopher, trying to make sense of the affairs of gods.\" \"I wouldn't dream of trying to make sense of it.\" \"You will. Every generation inches closer.\" He glances over at that, but the conversation is interrupted by another couple seeking to buy roses, and then another few. Athena stands by patiently and waits while Icarus handles it, then they continue walking their circuit around the park. \"So, uh... is anyone else here? Metaphysically or otherwise?\" He says this in as neutral a tone as he can but she makes an unconvincing effort to hide her smile. \"Yes. Several. Hera is here... metaphysically. Her domain is the protection of women as well, though she tends towards matrons rather than maidens. Ares is here in person - \" \"Ares? The god of war?\" \"Officially he's here representing the civil order.\" She gestures vaguely in the direction of the edge of the park where, out of sight, the counter-protesters - men's rights activists mostly - are a muffled presence. \"He's prowling around out there, making a point of ensuring they don't interfere. Additionally, the police and the armed forces of your country have recently made a public effort to intertwine with the White Ribbon cause, which is excellent and another reason for him to want to arrive. They'll be included in the speakers at the ceremony.\" \"Hasn't Ares always kind of been... a defender of women? Didn't I read that he went on trial for murder for defending his daughter from a rapist...\" Unexpectedly, Athena's posture stiffens. \"Yes,\" she says quietly. \"He always was their defender.\" There's a brief but horribly awkward pause, and then she points in another direction. \"Poseidon is over there somewhere - I mean, in another city. In person.\" Poseidon is an awkward topic for Icarus, considering that he was the one who technically killed Icarus by drowning... but he grabs at this conversational offering eagerly anyway, wanting to move on from bringing up the Ares thing. \"Oh? Uh - horses, earthquakes, and - the ocean, right? You'll have to explain the connection there.\" \"No connection. He's not there officially. That's why he can't be there metaphysically; it's not his domain. He just goes to some of these rallies and memorials around the world, sometimes, on his own. He thinks of it as atonement.\" That draws him up short. He looks over at her, blinking in confusion. \"Atonement?\" \"Yes. I'm sure you've read of some of his misdeeds. I took Medusa's fate quite seriously.\" Icarus considers this. He feels guilty; he'd always thought of Medusa's story as primarily god-on-mortal violence, but of course, she was raped by a male god. He wonders if this is one of his blind spots as a man; only seeing things as they relate to him. Mortal women must have been doubly targeted. And then to have monstrous children, sometimes, and from the sounds of it, the ancient Greeks weren't exactly supportive of the victims... and of course, there were the gods, always part of the world, always in power, always a reminder. \"It's nice that he's trying to make up for it,\" he ventures. \"Even if wasn't until a long time later. Better than never caring at all.\" \"Well, we do change,\" she says, giving him a glance. \"Even gods are capable of regret.\" Icarus is rescued from having to say anything by the announcement that the ceremony is about to start. He and Athena walk over to the memorial and stand quietly as the snow falls and the candles give off tiny flickers of light, and the white roses cover the ground and the short wall surrounding the memorial. He doesn't want to give too much thought to this right now, but her words linger in his mind, mixing with Elverna's thoughts from before. Things are changing; even gods are capable of regret. It's possibly the most optimistic he's felt all night that things aren't as bleak as he's thought.",

      "Icarus' roses are added to the piles.",
      "The donations for the flowers he sells are going to a women's shelter near the flower shop.",
      "The attack happened a few years before Icarus was born.",
      "He has no memory of the shock of the event; and he grew up with the White Ribbon days as a regular part of his life.",
      "He notices with a jolt that the women were, for the most part, about the age he is now, when they were killed.",
      "Icarus doesn't need his sisters or mother as a sole reason to care about violence done to women, but it's impossible not to reflect on the risks posed to them.",
      "It bothers him to think about them having to worry about things he takes for granted; if he thinks about it too long, he becomes distressed at the idea of some angry, entitled asshole insulting them, assaulting them, killing them - and due to nothing they'd ever said or done.",
      "Just the roll of the dice that led to them being women.",
      "He'd asked Elverna about it earlier, while they were tying ribbons around the stems of the white roses.",
      "She's in her sixties (he thinks - he would never ask, of course, but he knows that she was Leroy's high school sweetheart, and that he'd been caught up in the October Crisis about two weeks after he'd enlisted in the Army), so Icarus had wondered if she thought things were getting any better.",
      "\"Without question,\" she'd said, \"at least around here.",
      "You wouldn't have believed the things that were legal when I was a girl.",
      "And at least you can talk about things now.",
      "So, it's changing.\"",
      "She smiles at him, tying off another ribbon.",
      "\"And there are so many more young people on board with it now, who don't want things to go back to the old days.",
      "Nice young men like Icarus who care about people!\"",
      "He doesn't feel like he's doing a lot of good.",
      "He's just a guy wandering around with a bike stacked high with roses.",
      "But it's nice to hear her optimism on the matter.",
      "\"Ah, Icarus!\"",
      "He hears a familiar voice, a few yards behind him, and he half-turns to see Athena approaching him.",
      "She's wearing a fitted leather jacket that he recognizes as usually being fully bedecked with pins for causes she cares about.",
      "Today, there is only the white ribbon pin.",
      "The jacket isn't really warm enough for a December day in Canada, but she did put on a stylish white scarf.",
      "Not that gods are all that beholden to the weather.",
      "\"May I exchange some currency for one of your roses?\" she asks in her usual precise manner.",
      "\"Of course,\" Icarus replies, steadying his bicycle with his hip as he seeks out a small bunch tied together with white silk.",
      "\"I had thought you would be here, and I'm pleased to see I'm right,\" she says, accepting the flowers and giving him a note and a few coins - he sees owls and Athena's face on the coins, which isn't a surprise; and Robert Borden's face on the note, which is a shock!",
      "- but she continues talking before he can comment.",
      "\"It's a nice turnout.",
      "Artemis will be glad to see it.\"",
      "\"Oh - is Artemis here, too?\"",
      "\"She's always here, at one of these kinds of events.",
      "The protection of young women is one of her domains.\"",
      "\"Oh.. I was going to say we should go say hi, but she must be busy...\" \"Ah.",
      "She's actually here metaphysically, at the moment.",
      "But I've already alerted her that she should stop by in person afterwards to say hello.\"",
      "Athena glances at him, and then giggles.",
      "It's an unexpected sound, coming from her.",
      "Icarus gives her a suspicious look, though he's unable to keep a small smile off his face at her mirth.",
      "\"...What's so funny?\"",
      "\"Apollo had observed that your eye twitches whenever someone discusses our metaphysical duties or presence.",
      "And now I've just confirmed it.\"",
      "Icarus huffs, trying to sound annoyed but mostly sounding amused.",
      "\"It doesn't make sense.\"",
      "\"Poor Icarus.",
      "Another philosopher, trying to make sense of the affairs of gods.\"",
      "\"I wouldn't dream of trying to make sense of it.\"",
      "\"You will.",
      "Every generation inches closer.\"",
      "He glances over at that, but the conversation is interrupted by another couple seeking to buy roses, and then another few.",
      "Athena stands by patiently and waits while Icarus handles it, then they continue walking their circuit around the park.",
      "\"So, uh... is anyone else here?",
      "Metaphysically or otherwise?\"",
      "He says this in as neutral a tone as he can but she makes an unconvincing effort to hide her smile.",
      "\"Yes.",
      "Several.",
      "Hera is here... metaphysically.",
      "Her domain is the protection of women as well, though she tends towards matrons rather than maidens.",
      "Ares is here in person - \" \"Ares?",
      "The god of war?\"",
      "\"Officially he's here representing the civil order.\"",
      "She gestures vaguely in the direction of the edge of the park where, out of sight, the counter-protesters - men's rights activists mostly - are a muffled presence.",
      "\"He's prowling around out there, making a point of ensuring they don't interfere.",
      "Additionally, the police and the armed forces of your country have recently made a public effort to intertwine with the White Ribbon cause, which is excellent and another reason for him to want to arrive.",
      "They'll be included in the speakers at the ceremony.\"",
      "\"Hasn't Ares always kind of been... a defender of women?",
      "Didn't I read that he went on trial for murder for defending his daughter from a rapist...\" Unexpectedly, Athena's posture stiffens.",
      "\"Yes,\" she says quietly.",
      "\"He always was their defender.\"",
      "There's a brief but horribly awkward pause, and then she points in another direction.",
      "\"Poseidon is over there somewhere - I mean, in another city.",
      "In person.\"",
      "Poseidon is an awkward topic for Icarus, considering that he was the one who technically killed Icarus by drowning...",
      "but he grabs at this conversational offering eagerly anyway, wanting to move on from bringing up the Ares thing.",
      "\"Oh?",
      "Uh - horses, earthquakes, and - the ocean, right?",
      "You'll have to explain the connection there.\"",
      "\"No connection.",
      "He's not there officially.",
      "That's why he can't be there metaphysically; it's not his domain.",
      "He just goes to some of these rallies and memorials around the world, sometimes, on his own.",
      "He thinks of it as atonement.\"",
      "That draws him up short.",
      "He looks over at her, blinking in confusion.",
      "\"Atonement?\"",
      "\"Yes.",
      "I'm sure you've read of some of his misdeeds.",
      "I took Medusa's fate quite seriously.\"",
      "Icarus considers this.",
      "He feels guilty; he'd always thought of Medusa's story as primarily god-on-mortal violence, but of course, she was raped by a male god.",
      "He wonders if this is one of his blind spots as a man; only seeing things as they relate to him.",
      "Mortal women must have been doubly targeted.",
      "And then to have monstrous children, sometimes, and from the sounds of it, the ancient Greeks weren't exactly supportive of the victims... and of course, there were the gods, always part of the world, always in power, always a reminder.",
      "\"It's nice that he's trying to make up for it,\" he ventures.",
      "\"Even if wasn't until a long time later.",
      "Better than never caring at all.\"",
      "\"Well, we do change,\" she says, giving him a glance.",
      "\"Even gods are capable of regret.\"",
      "Icarus is rescued from having to say anything by the announcement that the ceremony is about to start.",
      "He and Athena walk over to the memorial and stand quietly as the snow falls and the candles give off tiny flickers of light, and the white roses cover the ground and the short wall surrounding the memorial.",
      "He doesn't want to give too much thought to this right now, but her words linger in his mind, mixing with Elverna's thoughts from before.",
      "Things are changing; even gods are capable of regret.",
      "It's possibly the most optimistic he's felt all night that things aren't as bleak as he's thought."

    "text": "Icarus stumbles through the dimly-lit room, trying to peer ahead through crowded rows of bodies hanging from the ceiling. They're arranged in such a way, so closely strung together, that it's impossible for him to avoid brushing against them and sending them lightly spinning, eerily. Most of the bodies are draped loosely in some kind of thin cloth, as well, adding to the unsettling effect. He shivers - mostly because of the cold. This meat locker appears to be refrigeration-temperatures, rather than freezing, which is lucky, because the ragged shroud he's wearing isn't doing much good to keep him warm. Icarus' shoestring budget has guided most of his costume choices in the last couple years, so he's basically just wearing cheap old bedsheets pinned in place, and some of that greenish-pale face paint. He'd put black circles under his eyes and Helios had joked that it didn't look much different from his usual sleep-deprivation circles. Asshole. Helios, wherever he is, is probably not much warmer in his 'sexy black cat' costume; though, he is the sun, after all. Apollo is the only one who's properly clothed; he went dressed as an eighteenth-century dandy, complete with neckerchief*. The neckerchief would have been handy right now; it's damn cold! Icarus really hopes he can find the exit soon, but this maze of bodies is difficult to navigate. And, though he's trying to be calm about it, the truth is that there is a thrill of fear giving him the shivers as well, and driving him through a little more anxiously. He knows it's fake - each of these bodies has a plastic tag with some Greek word on it: Aristaios, whatever that means**. And he's sure these are too big to be human bodies; it's probably pork or beef or... mutton or whatever. And the weird guy wearing a mask, who let them into the house, he had a pretty distinct blue haircut... totally Hermes. And the totally pitch dark room, where he, Helios, and Apollo had all been grabbed by invisible hands and tugged into different directions and split up - well, he knows he heard Hermes' voice, at least, laughing at them. That voice is still laughing, somewhere behind him, and damn if it isn't freaking him out!! It's all fake and he knows it, but there's something primal about trying to run away from something scary, running through something scary... it goes straight to his spine and makes Icarus jumpy and nervous. Icarus bumps against another draped body, and leaps back with a shriek as it abruptly begins shifting and moaning, in a distinctly human voice, while a human hand feebly grasps at him. \"My last victim,\" says a voice immediately behind him, making Icarus jump at least twenty feet and whip around with a gasp. There's the masked weirdo again, grinning as he holds a chainsaw aloft. \"And you'll be next!\" He laughs maniacally and descends on Icarus with the chainsaw. Icarus shrieks again and tears off through the bodies, knocking blindly past them and away from the chainsaw killer. More of the bodies start shifting and moaning as he runs past and against them, and manages, by some miracle, to find another door. He fumbles at it desperately - the chainsaw killer is close on his heels, howling and roaring - and pushes through, into abrupt silence and darkness. -------------------- * \"I'm Samuel Coleridge Taylor! 'Rime of the Ancient Mariner?' One of the most haunting and unsettling, and yet also beautiful, works of poetry ever written?!\" Apollo was indignant for a while when Icarus and Helios failed to recognize his costume, but Icarus soothed him by commenting that the look was very sexy. Most people who saw his costume assumed he was a vampire. ** Aristaios is Aristaeus, son of Apollo and Cyrene, god of animal husbandry, among other things. Hermes commandeered his meat locker for the haunted house event. Hermes turns off the chainsaw and allows himself a moment of self-congratulatory snickering. This is going great. All these dorks are running around in a total panic. He'd debated on whether or not to keep them together or split them up, but ultimately... he knows that the gods are hilariously easy to spook, but they're protective, too. And he kind of wants to see what Icarus does on his own, without any gods around. So far, he's shown decent initiative, which is good. Hermes had half-believed that Icarus would have chosen to stand listlessly in a corner until someone finally came and dragged him outside, but he's been exploring, and showing he's got a little fight in him. Or, well, a little flight, really... but that's fine. He's reacting, and in an amusing way, which is good enough for Hermes. He brings up his phone, decorated with festive spooky stickers, and sends a text. \"RBF thru portal off meat locker. I forget where that goes; watch for him.\" A notification beep comes through on his phone (the sound of Athena saying \"Hermes that's disgusting!\") and a contact he's named as Gothic Cinnamon Bun sends a message. \"K. Big Bad in Spider Forest now. Swearing a lot. V. droll.\" \"Hidden cameras??\" Thumbs up emoji. \"Yup! Heph checked again. Replay value for DECADES.\" \"Haha! I bet!\" He checks the Living Map device Hephaestus had invented centuries ago; something like a cross between the Maurauder's Map and a modern GPS. \"Wonder Twins headed too close to zombie room. Can u chase them away? They can't handle seeing each other dead\" Thumbs up emoji. \"Fucking Hermes!\" Artemis and Apollo, like most siblings throughout existence, frequently go back and forth between being each other's biggest fan, and bickering like petty children, and back again. Halloween is no different, except that they switch back and forth between solidarity and fighting within minutes now. They had started out the evening arguing about whose costume was cooler (Artemis can't believe, sometimes, that her brother is such a dork; for his part, he can't understand why she'd voluntarily go out in public wearing something as gauche as a sexy cowgirl outfit. Like Halloween is so well-known for being a classy event!) But now, after twenty minutes or so in the haunted house, they've been separated from the cuties they'd brought with them*** and are stuck with each other. They fight whenever Artemis makes fun of Apollo for jumping like an idiot baby literally every time one of Hermes' costumed spooks jumps out at them; then said spooks cover them both in silly string, or fills the room with something that reeks, and then the twins are united again in cursing Hermes bitterly. \"I'll kick his stupid ass into Tartarus; see how funny he thinks he is then,\" Apollo grumbles, repeating the same threat he's made against the messenger god since they day they first met. \"I'm gonna team up with Ares and make his life hell during our sparring sessions. You know he's putting Helmet Head through the wringer.\" \"We should volunteer him to do paperwork with Hades next Halloween. Hit him where it really hurts.\" \"Poor Hermes. And here he went to so much trouble to entertain you!\" This is spoken in a low, spooky woman's voice. The twins both whip around as one to look; Artemis pulls out her fake six-shooter on reflex. A witch levitates in the shadows a few yards away, head lolling to the side as she regards them. She looks so spooky as to almost be cartoonish: face painted deathly green; grin stretched too-wide; pointy hat; ragged black robes. She cackles and starts after them. And, okay, the unnatural way she drags through the air, arms outstretched, feet never touching the ground - it's a little creepy. But Artemis is tough, and not so easily scared by some goofy fake witch. It's Apollo who yells and shoves them both forward, down the hall, towards a door - A door that they never reach. A rug, just before that door, gives way - a trapdoor on the floor. They both fall through with a startled yell, landing hard on a surface in an entirely different environment. Artemis hits warm water and splutters upright. It's about waist deep. Apollo's landed in a pile of... something, nearby, on a ledge. Artemis looks around; it's a tunnel, for sure, warm, and with a ledge that appears to have bones piled here and there - a catacombs? The ledge lies next to a stream of running water... She gasps. \"Oh shit - this better not be a fucking sewer!\" Apollo has gone rigid with horror. \"What am I sitting in?!\" Artemis grips the ledge in a hurry to haul herself out of the questionable liquid, and shrieks when she feels something organic and moving beneath her fingers. \"Fuck!! Are these bugs??\" Down the tunnel of the catacombs/sewer, there's squeaking, as of bats or rats. Apollo is on his feet and hits his head on a low ceiling. Something rains down on them and they both groan in disgust. \"Fucking Hermes!!\" ------------------ *** For anyone curious: Selene declined to participate because she, alone, listened to that quiet nagging doubt in the back of her head. She got out of it by claiming someone needed to make sure the moon was sufficiently ambient for the occasion. She'll definitely be at the party afterwards though. \"Fucking Hermes!!\" Persephone takes the recorded clip and saves it; then sends it to Hermes, adding \"for ur ringtone collection!\" She leaves the twins yelling about the gross filthy tunnel and smiles contentedly to herself as she moves to her next location. Every year that they decide to do this is so much fun! Between Hermes' mastery of pranking and her own artistic macabre style, they have a winning team going for the Halloween occasion. These gods do not see it coming. Of course, spending her time on this means she'll have to work quite hard to get caught up after the night of the thinnest veil between Life and Death; but come on - fun! Worth it! She checks her Living Map and quickly texts Hermes again. \"Looks like grandpa's headed for his room, hurry and let's watch!!\" He replies immediately: \"!!!!!!! 8D OK gonna make sure RBF is okay first then I'll be right there\" She rolls her eyes, though he can't see it. \"U have some nerve flaunting that lil scam in front of me & Hades:P he was pretty pissed when he found out\" \" -\\_(tsu)_/- \" \"& now doting on him like a mama hen\" \"he is smol and sad:C \" \"yeah I know. Just giving u shit. I won't do anything TOO awful if I see him:) hurry up tho!!!\" Icarus is in some kind of cave - rocky and bare. It's barely lit by some kind of glowing fungus or something. It's sufficient enough to see the height of the cave, anyway, and that the ground inclines downward. For lack of any better guidance, he follows the cave's tunnel downward. He's a little less freaked out than he might have thought by the idea that he clearly went through some sort of portal. The sun gods have teleported him before, so he's familiar with the sensation, plus it only makes it more obvious that none of this is real, and it's all orchestrated by Hermes, probably. At first, Icarus can only hear his own footfalls and the quiet dripping of water out of sight. After a few moments, though, he thinks he hears - and then is certain he hears - a calm man's voice with an English accent, talking about - horses?? \"The rack and slow gait of the American Saddle horse, running walk of the Tennessee Walking horse, and the pace of the Standardbred may be natural or acquired. A natural gait is one that is performed by natural impulse and without training. The acquired gaits are the result of specific training...\" What the hell? It gets a little louder as he moves through the tunnel. After a few more moments of walking, he reaches a wide, roughly circular space, ringed with torches. There's a deep, dark hole in the ground - a pretty enormous hole. He hears something inside the hole, and nervously tries to go around it. He has no idea what to expect here - a dark cave, a deep hole, and a voice talking about horses...? He steps to the far side, where he thought he saw another tunnel entrance. He's so busy keeping his eye on that hole that he doesn't notice the man standing at the tunnel entrance until he's almost walked directly into him. Icarus gasps in alarm and stumbles backwards, away from him. The man looks at him strangely, then looks past him and says something: \"Stamata! Pegaine piso.\" Icarus whips around to look, and imagines that maybe he sees something at the dark hole - but if he does, it's gone already. He looks back at the guy nervously. He's tall, with dark skin and - well, it's dim in the cave, but his hair looks green. He's in costume, sort of - a black t-shirt, pirate bandana, eyepatch, and a fish skeleton necklace. He's still giving Icarus a weird look, like he's waiting to see what Icarus does; but when Icarus doesn't do anything, the guy finally speaks - in English, this time. \"Ahh, I must apologize - you weren't meant to be in this room...\" \"I'm... sorry?\" Icarus ventures uncertainly. \"I hope I'm not trespassing? I mean, I didn't mean to come here, I just got chased through a portal, and - um, if you can show me how to get out, I'll get out of your way, I'm sorry.\" The guy's face changes a little at that; it's still a little unreadable to Icarus but a bit of tension seems to have broken. He gestures for Icarus to follow him. \"It isn't trespassing. I only mean I didn't expect you - because, the room's still, uh - under repairs. Not ready for visitors.\" \"Oh! I see,\" Icarus smiles awkwardly. \"Well, I hope I'm not interrupting you at anything.\" The guy half-smiles then, gesturing as they reach a slightly more furnished-looking part of the cave - it has a couch, a refrigerator, and a television set paused on - aha. A documentary about horses. \"As you see, you have not interrupted anything crucial.\" \"You like horses?\" Icarus says, apparently just to be even more awkward. The guy's half-smile widens and he looks almost friendly. \"Yes, indeed. I love horses very much.\" He shows Icarus to a door. \"This portal will lead you back to the rest of the house. If you are looking for him, I think Helios is through here - or at any rate, I definitely heard Helios yelling a moment ago.\" \"Oh, thanks! Yeah, I'd like to find him if I can, and Apollo. Thanks so much. Uh - Happy Halloween!\" Icarus does a stupid half-wave and hurries through the door. Behind him, he hears the guy say, \"Yes, Happy Halloween, Icarus.\" It's a little startling to hear that the guy knows his name, but not that weird. After all, it seems like nearly all the gods know who he is. Some better than others. The man returns back to his couch, looking for the remote. Behind him, in the room with the pit, he hears an irritated-sounding pit. Poseidon speaks, in Greek: \"This one was not for you, darling. You must be patient.\" \"Way to kill the ambiance,\" complains another voice, mildly chiding. Hermes, in full chainsaw killer regalia, is looking at the battered couch and horse documentary in amusement. \"You should be glad for my horses and fridge killing the mood. The boy suspected nothing.\" \"I do appreciate it,\" Hermes says, seriously. \"I know you didn't have to.\" Poseidon shrugs, and makes a gesture towards the wall, where a crosspoint hanging reappears from where he'd concealed it: the full text of \"Full Fathoms Five;\" a spooky decoration given to him by Athena recently. They get along better these days. \"It wasn't any trouble on my part to usher him through with no further trauma. And in any case, I used up all the ambiance on Ares when he came here. That was the highlight of my evening; anyone else can go hang.\" \"Yeah, I heard about Ares' little misadventure. Persephone and I were too polite to watch, of course, but I imagine Aphrodite will enjoy that little show.\" Oh, fuck, Ares is SO PISSED OFF. He's gonna murder the fuck out of that little shit and he'd be doing the entire cosmos a fucking favor. He trips over another headstone and curses. He's in some huge, warehouse-like room - possibly. It's either a huge room, very convincingly decorated and lighted to look like a cemetery at night, or he could have been teleported to an actual graveyard out in the countryside somewhere****. If so, Selene's in on this scam somehow, because he can't tell if the full moon hiding behind the clouds is her or if it's another convincing fake. Hermes and Persephone had basically kidnapped him earlier and dragged him into this House of Misery, and he's been running around through the worst of the rooms ever since. The two assholes keep chasing after him and teasing him every time he falls for one of their stupid cheap jump scares. And there are so. Fucking. Many. He's grabbed door handles that turned out to be fake - they grabbed his hand and dragged him into the fake-door surface up to the shoulder while something gross and slimy licked his hand until he managed to detach himself with a round of swearing. He's spent a long time trying to navigate his way through some kind of maze in total pitch darkness, and might still be wandering around in there now, if it hadn't turned out that the maze was located in Thanatos' home and his old pal had finally taken pity on him and shown him out. He's spent twenty very... busy minutes, in Poseidon's cave, which took him totally by surprise, particularly when the damn Kraken came out and caught him up in its tentacles. Poseidon is a fucking dirty old man!! He better not have showed Aphrodite like he threatened to! He's been chased by giant spiders, chased by zombies, turned into a zombie, and had a spell cast on him by Hecate that made him sing a song about how much he admired Queen Persephone and had a huge crush on Lord Hermes. Which wasn't scary necessarily, but it was deeply annoying and embarrassing, and it was six stanzas long, and they both had laughed and Hermes had swooped in for a sneak-attack kiss afterwards, which Ares obviously hates. He's going to find that fucking punk and wring his neck. He'll punch him into the goddamn sun - then let those two assholes take a turn beating him up, because he's pretty sure he's heard their stupid voices yelling in rage too around this house of hell. Ares trips over still another headstone and this time faceplants hard, into very real-feeling dirt. His curses and threats against Hermes ring through the silence around the cemetery. He'll direct all of his rage at Hermes - not Persephone, of course. Ares isn't an idiot. ---------- **** It is outdoors, but it's still fake. Hermes and Persephone combined the spookiest elements from several graveyards around the world, including Highgate in London; the Glasgow Necropolis; several in New Orleans; and others. Ares didn't really notice all the details and wouldn't have been impressed anyway. His favorite idiot is floundering around in the dark, growling threats at the world in general and Hermes in particular. As well as threatening the various bats that skitter around his head, and at the vines and roots that tangle his ankles, and at the headstones of the poor departed souls who can't really help being there in his way. Ares is wearing a werewolf costume, which involves ragged clothing and ruffled fur, so it's difficult to say how disheveled he's become since entering the haunted house, but the expression on his face tells a lot. Hermes does love flustering Ares: the god can always be counted on to give a good reaction, and stirs up his inner scaredy cat in hilarious ways. Plus, Hermes figured out a long time ago that Ares secretly loves these kinds of events. Contained survivalism allows him to direct his natural aggression and fighting instincts into something safe and socially acceptable. Unfortunately, one of the downsides to doing this in a group setting, is that the group tends to drain on him as a god of courage. Artemis, Apollo, Helios... even Icarus and little Siproites, they all are subconsciously calling on Ares' store of courage and strength to push forward in the face of scary challenges, even though Ares needs it himself here. Hermes can see he's struggling a little bit now. His frustration is beginning to get an edge. So Hermes decides to give Ares a break from the adrenaline. He's got to redirect the guy anyway; he's been headed in the direction of the portal that leads to the Wall Room - a room where the walls begin to close in on the victim, as though they'll be crushed. Of course, it's rigged so that the floor gives way and drops them to safety, but Hermes doesn't want Ares anywhere near it. The Aloadai and their jar might feel like a long time ago to the rest of the gods... but the effect on Ares was permanent. He waits for Ares to pick himself up from the faceplant, smiles when he hears his own name being cursed for the millionth time tonight, and then swoops in behind Ares. \"Having trouble? You're supposed to go around the gravestones - not over them,\" he says, reaching out and tickling Ares' ribs. Ares whips around and throws a solid punch, that strikes only air as Hermes dodges it. \"You'll need another couple thousand years to land a punch on me,\" Hermes says smugly, before latching himself onto Ares' back, koala-style, hugging him tightly. \"You horrible little fucking shit!\" Ares snarls, but already losing steam and there's a clear note of relief in his voice, though he hides it well. Hermes hugs him tighter, feeling a bit of tension leaving his frame. \"I love you too, sweetie,\" he coos, planting a kiss on Ares' cheek and watching the blush spread even in the dark. Ares grumbles his usual (totally fake) protests and tries to assume a manly stance. Hermes smiles and climbs up to sit on Ares shoulders. He pats Ares' face and points in a direction; Ares goes, unquestioningly, in spite of all the abuse he's suffered at Hermes' hands tonight. The total trust makes Hermes almost feel a tiny bit guilty for the nonstop scary pranks, but he'll make it up to him later. \"We're thinking of starting to wrap up. The others are getting worn out. Well, Icarus and Sippy are anyway. The Wonder Twins are fine but unfortunately me and Persephone guessed wrong and sent them into the gross tunnel of bugs and slime too early, and now they're both pitching a fit.\" Ares, who had waded through that same gross tunnel about ten minutes before the twins and hadn't been fazed, snorts in amusement. \"Mighta guess Sunshine couldn't take it, but I thought Arty was tougher than that.\" \"She thinks it's incredibly disgusting, but she usually keeps a lid on it better. When she's with Apoop, she lets her guard down a little more,\" Hermes informs him cheerfully. \"Good to know.\" \"So, anyway. We're gonna get people into teams again and kinda prod everyone towards the exit.\" \"Teams?\" Ares had been dragged in alone, of course, because he's a lot harder to scare with other people around. If he'd been with the sun gods, there would have been a lot of manly posturing preventing his inner cowardice from shining through; if he'd been with Arty, there'd be too much friendly horsing around; if he'd been with the nymph or the mortal, his protective side would have come out too strong. That protective side is what Hermes needs right now, though. \"Yup - well, like I said, the Wonder Twins are wading through slime together, and Icarus is about to free Helios from prison.\" Ares makes a noise almost like laughter. \"Persephone caught him?\" \"Yup - he fell apart in the demon frog room!\" \"I fucking knew he would!! I know you fucks have hidden cameras around here, you better let me see that shit - \" \"Hephaestus has a highlight reel going that we'll play at the party afterwards,\" Hermes tells him. He lifts off Ares' shoulders. \"Party?\" \"Yeah. Hestia's been setting up. Nice fireplace, seasonal snacks, spiked cider... so you better hurry!\" He points down the far end of the cemetery, where there's a commotion. \"And go save your partner!\" Siproites stares, as the girl rises out of the well. Half her body is bone white; the other half is midnight black. She appears to be dressed with a Gothic Lolita look, which is... actually really cute, and Siproites was briefly distracted from her fear, in order to squeal mentally over the cute little buttons and ruffles on the dress the Girl in the Well is wearing. She's opening her mouth to say something about how she was going to wear something Gothic Loli-style tonight but went with a cute panda look instead, but then the girl smiles and whispers something into the air. The ground erupts with ghosts. Siproites shrieks and stumbles away, as the ghosts all open their mouths, or at any rate a hole gapes in the blank white faces and the most horrible noise pours out. It's kind of a moan and kind of a scream and it's loud and terrifying and Siproites freezes - \"Sippy!!\" Her name is shouted from the other side and suddenly - Lord Ares is there! He charges directly through and past the ghosts, who look nonplussed and irritated, and without even breaking his stride he scoops her up and into his arms and continues tearing through the graveyard, straight towards a mausoleum. The ghosts are all starting to drift after them, still shrieking, and it's all very frightening, but at the same time Siproites is trying very hard to keep her skirt at least somewhat modestly in place, and trying not to get too in a flap over the fact that the handsome and gallant Lord Ares appeared from nowhere to rescue her. \"What were you doing, dummy?? Just standing there staring at her!\" Lord Ares' manners are, well, rough; but Siproites has been living with Lady Artemis for a very long time and such things have long ceased to faze her. \"Her dress was very cute! It made me think maybe she wasn't one of the- the Scaries, but maybe another person running around!\" Lord Ares adjusts his grip on her - in this new position, her modesty is saved, which is just one of the small gestures of kindness Siproites would expect from such a gentleman. He runs up to the mausoleum, which has two doors, firmly shut. \"Yeah, that's fair. But that was Melinoe. I guess you wouldn't have seen her before.\" \"Queen Persephone's daughter!\" \"And King Hades, yeah,\"Lord Ares quirks his lips in amusement before giving the mausoleum doors a solid kick. The heavy stone doors fly open, breaking the hinges and they fall to the ground, cracking into several pieces. The inside of the mausoleum is oppressively dark, and a cold, foul-smelling air drifts out of it. Lord Ares steps over the rubble and puts his hand out to her. Siproites takes it, barely noticing the train of ghosts coming after them. \"Cute costume, by the way,\" Lord Ares says, distractedly, peering through the murk. Siproites beams. \"Ohh, thank you! I made it myself!\" She'd asked Lady Athena to help her with the cap with the pom-poms on it to represent the ears, and had been quite proud of her efforts. \"You look very dashing in your costume, too!\" Lord Ares does look very cool in his wolf costume, or at least Siproites thinks so. She's a big fan of Lord Ares. He was one of the first people outside of Lady Artemis' Grove to support her new place in the world as a woman, all those years ago. And he's so funny, and chivalrous and handsome besides! He's one of very, very few men that Lady Artemis allows into her Grove, so you couldn't ask for a better recommendation of character. \"Come on, idiot!\" Lord Ares breaks her reverie and hurries her down the steps of the mausoleum, into the darkness, as the ghosts mill about the broken doors and shriek at them. He takes her hand and guides her through, carefully. \"You can be such a little ditz,\" he says, but she knows his tones by now and he sounds both annoyed and fond, which is what you have to hope for from him. They go deeper into the tunnel and the wailing behind them fades until there's nothing but silence. It's creepy, but the God of Courage is here with her, so Siproites contents herself to follow behind him as he mutters his usual curses and threats against Lord Hermes and leads them into the darkness. The Titan of the Sun is wearing a sexy cat costume and sulking from where he sits, trapped in a cage suspended over the ground. He could break out, of course, but Persephone had told him he'd better not; he'd better sit put and wait till someone came to rescue his ass. She drew a finger over her throat to show him she was serious. Helios rolled his eyes but didn't argue; he was absolutely on her turf here and no one defied Persephone. She'd caught him when he'd lost his cool in the stupidest room in this stupid house, which was a large swampy room with an enormous stupid frog with demonic eyes that breathed some kind of poison gas and roared like the Void of Chaos. Whatever, it was lame and dumb, but he'd had a brief moment where he overreacted and yelled for someone to get him out of the room so she'd gone in and dragged him out and put him in this cage. To ease the indignity a little, she'd given him some tea from Hestia and put on some Halloween cartoons for him to watch while he waited. Helios had told her she'd better not let fucking Apollo see him like this; and she'd assured him that Apollo was bearing his own burdens at the moment. Really, it's incredible how much she and Hermes like to see people suffer. If they'd brought Eros in on this mess then the trifecta of Fucking With People would have been complete and the entire ordered world could be brought to an end. The room where he's sitting and watching Charlie Brown is otherwise decorated like a witch's hut. Spooky shadows, cobwebbed corners, suspicious vials of liquid, a bubbling cauldron... and a black cat sitting on a shelf giving him a side-eye. Helios flips it off. He's definitely pulling off the sexy cat look better than this feline shithead. \"Helios - you're - in a cage.\" Helios looks over at the voice; it's Icarus!! Out of all the people in the group who he'd want to see him in this state... well, Helios would rather that none of them did, but at least the kid won't be an unbearable asshole about it forever. \"Mop-Head! Hurry up and get me down! The key's over there in that human skull.\" Icarus raises his eyebrows briefly at him and goes over to the skull. \"Soooooo.... Why are you in a cage?\" \"That asshole Hermes. And Persephone the ringleader.\" \"Well, yeah I figured that much, but - actually, it doesn't matter. None of my business.\" \"Yeah, good call. Hurry up, Mop-Head, I saw Erichtho go through earlier and believe me that we don't want to be here if she comes back. Ugh. Give me a witch like Circe or Medea any day.\" \"Circe and Medea I know, but... Erichtho?\" Icarus asks, finding a keyring in the skull and bringing it over to try them on the lock to Helios' cage. \"Crazy, hideous, corpse-eating necromancer witch. Generally lives in cemeteries but I guess they hauled her out for the occasion.\" \"Oh... really?\" Icarus shakes his head, finding a key that turns neatly in the lock. \"Well, luckily I have you to protect me again.\" Coming from anyone else, this would sound snarky, given that Helios is being released from a cage and was clearly not protecting anyone, and he gets pretty easily spooked regardless of anything else. But Icarus gives him that small smile and takes his hand and Helios pulls him into an enormous hug. \"You got it, Kiddo! You got me looking out for you from here on!\" Not two minutes later, he's latched onto Icarus' back, riding him piggy-back style while burying his face in Icarus' neck. \"I really wish you could walk,\" Icarus complains, but with no heat. \"You look like one of those zombies on Ocarina of Time.\" \"I don't know what that means, but you need to shuffle along a little faster,\" Helios snaps. They're in another room of illusion - this one transforms them so that they take on the appearance of zombies, including the shuffling gait. This was first startling, then a little amusing. They laughed at each other's dull, drooling expressions, the slumped posture, the random bones that appeared to poke out of green skin but felt only like air if you tried to touch them. But then they started to proceed through the room, or series of rooms. The rooms were large, and made mazelike by the placement of large piles of boxes or piled furniture, and 'walls' of chain link fencing. Bloodstained handprints occasionally decorate flat surface areas. They could hear eerie groans somewhere hidden in the rooms, and out of the corner of their eyes, they could just barely see the shape of something else shuffling along. Then, occasionally, they'll turn a corner and see two zombies immediately in front of them - a mirror, showing only themselves, but the effect is alarming and keeps catching them off guard. It's unsettling and creepy. It ain't Helios' bag. He normally floats above the world and all its creepy problems; he's not used to having to - to deal with all this spooky stuff. It was always happening down there, not in his face! So he latches onto Icarus, who's probably much better familiar with zombies and knows just what to do, and they shuffle through the zombie maze that way, slowly and with a great deal of complaining. They get to a room that's larger than the others, and it's mostly empty, save for a h. uge 'ambient' puddle of blood on the floor. Oh, and a figure in rags, standing off to the side and facing the wall, swaying slightly in place but otherwise still and silent. Just past this figure is an ornate door, different from all the rest. Certainly the portal out. Icarus tightens his grip on Helios' legs, and Helios has enough presence of mind to file that sensory memory away for consideration later. They step cautiously into the room. On their other side, set off by nothing at all, something (a stick? A bone?) clatters to the floor, making a noise that echoes in the silence. The figure turns around, revealing a sunken face with gray and rotting skin, and teeth visible in the absence of lips. \"Oh! Uh. Are you, are you, another visitor? Like us? Um, we're looking for a way out of the room, maybe that door you're standing by? Maybe we could check it out?\" Icarus, the sweet dummy, is doing that thing he does when he's nervous, which is to make awkward small talk at a babbling pace. Charms the hell out of the gods... but Helios recognizes this figure. She'd been a demigoddess once, but now she was little more than a monster, and no amount of charm, threats, or pleas will reach her. \"Fuck. Come on, Icarus, that's Erichtho!!\" In the back of his mind, Helios knows that Hecate must be nearby, keeping an eye on her monstrous servant. But Helios also knows that gods and witches alike have misjudged the power of monsters, and the fate of Erichtho's victims is gruesome and terrible. He reaches down and grabs the front of Icarus' shirt while dropping to his own feet, using the motion to flip Icarus over onto his own shoulder, and hauls. Well, as fast as he's able with the damn zombie curse still slowing his legs. Erichtho opens her mouth in a horrifying, unearthly shriek, and starts after them. She's moving much faster than she should be able to. He race-shambles as fast as he can. Icarus twists around to try to see, and gasps. \"Shit!! Helios, shuffle faster! She's like ten feet away!!\" \"Fuck!!\" Helios is going to pummel Hermes! And Persephone too, he's not scared of her! And Hecate, for good measure! But Hermes most of all, that little shit. They reach the door and Helios can smell her, the reek of corpse and wrongness, and fuck but Helios wishes he could just go full sun and burn the shit out of this whole place but he'd burn Icarus too if he did... He yanks the door handle open just as the zombie witch grabs Icarus and by his long, trailing robe and pulls him towards her. Icarus panics and starts thrashing around. \"Shit! Helios!!\" Helios wheels around and kicks hard at the witch, whose mouth has widened far more than should be naturally possible. He does break her grip on Icarus, but knocks them both off-balance. Erichtho howls at them as Helios and Icarus stumble backwards through the door, where they immediately fall down into darkness..... Apollo smacks his head yet again into the low ceiling of this Nyx-cursed darkness - he and Artemis have been wandering for a while in a maze where no light can be seen. It has to be Nyx, because even Apollo can't summon any light here. The twists and turns are easy enough to miss that the twins have been forced to hold hands in order not to lose each other in the maze. Artemis hears the clunk of his forehead hitting a low part of the ceiling and laughs. \"S'what you get for being so tall, 'Pollo!\" she teases, just before tripping over some unseen obstacle and falling heavily to the ground, hand yanked out of Apollo's grip. Apollo's delighted schadenfreude overrules his aloofness and he cackles at her. \"It seems hubris isn't only a hazard for mortals, Big Sister!\" \"Oh, shut up,\" she gripes sourly. \"Gimme your hand, jerkass.\" They both reach out and take a hand again. There's a long pause. \"Are you...?\" Artemis sounds confused. There's some rustling noises. \"You have boobs?!\" \"Eeek, L-Lady Artemis! Is that - you?!\" \"Sippy?? What are you doing sneaking around?!\" \"Ahh, we didn't expect to find you here! We just got teleported here after the cemetery!\" \"That's lucky! Oh, and... please excuse my grope, heh.\" Apollo interrupts whatever the nymph is about to say. \"Wait - then whose hand -??\" \"Sunshine?!\" He and Ares rip their hands away from each other as though touching fire. \"Ah, Ares! Good to see you survived another Halloween with Hermes!\" Artemis sounds happy, at least. \"It isn't over yet,\" the oaf mutters. Correctly. As though in direct response to this observation, there's a popping noise and the distinct sensation of a portal opening, and then there's a person in Apollo's arms, yelling and thrashing around. \"Shit! The zombie got me!!\" \"Hold on, I'll get it!\" And then Apollo receives a punch in the stomach. \"Ow, fuck! Damn it, Helios!\" The person in his arms stills. \"Wait, what? Apollo?\" A gasp from nearby. \"Apollo? I punched you?? I'm sorry! I'm really sorry, it was instinct, I swear!\" Apollo's impressed, actually - he had assumed the punch had come from Helios. Apparently, adrenaline gives Icarus quite a boost of strength. Apollo drops Helios unceremoniously to the ground, ignoring the curse that results and reaches out to take Icarus' hands. \"No matter, Icarus, I'm simply glad to see you're all right. It sounds like you had a rough night too.\" Icarus laughs a little breathlessly. \"Yeah, we sure did. And you? What about Artemis and Sippy?\" \"We're here, kiddo.\" \"Yes, it was pretty scary! I hope I can compliment Queen Persephone on her efforts this year!\" \"They outdid themselves this year, to be sure. I hope to 'compliment' Hermes, too,\" Apollo says drily. \"You may have a chance to pay them your compliments - if you survive your final trial,\" comes an unfamiliar and booming voice. There's light, suddenly, and it illuminates a nightmare that Ares hasn't seen in thousands of years. Typhon, the great and terrible monster birthed by Gaia and Tartarus in revenge for the gods' victory over the giants, stands before them. A massive snake's coils merge hellishly to a man's torso, and is topped by one hundred snake heads, each spitting fire. A roaring shakes the ground and fills their ears with cacophony. The last time Apollo saw this nightmarish creature was thousands of years ago, and he'd fled from the sight of it. Turned into a bird and flew to Egypt, along with Artemis and every other god.... Except Athena. And even Athena could do no more in the face of the beast but to shout encouragement to Zeus, who fought Typhon alone and barely triumphed in the cataclysmic battle. Apollo knows - knows - that it's impossible for Typhon to be here. He's been destroyed for millennia, and buried beneath the earth. And yet, the reaction of terror is visceral and he finds himself holding Artemis' hand again, as they had so long ago when they were still barely more than children facing it. Then he sees Ares, looking haggard and just as terrified as the rest, but he's shouting something at Siproites and shoving her at Icarus. The nymph clutches at Icarus and starts to run away with him as Ares shimmers, and Apollo realizes at the moment that he's shifting to his true form. He's going to try to fight Typhon. It's death. Typhon is death. And yet, Apollo realizes that the only imaginable way that Icarus will survive this is if these gods confront Typhon alone while Siproites runs for help. So he takes Helios' hand on one side, and Artemis' on the other, and they stand, grimly, in their ridiculous Halloween costumes, facing Typhon....Typhon, who speaks again, in a considerably less booming voice. \"All right, all right. Well. You lot really are worked up. Compliments to Persephone indeed.\" The gods, all states of half-transformation, freeze and stare, blinking. Typhon raises his hands made of swords and snakes and makes a 'calm down' gesture with them. \"Nymph. You may return with the mortal - Olympians, return to your human forms already.\" They do so, bewildered. It's Apollo who finally ventures a guess: the voice sounds familiar now... \"Uncle...? King Hades?\" And suddenly, the most terrifying scourge of the entire history of the earth is just their uncle's tall, sharply-angled form, wearing a costume that's revealed to be a ridiculously fake-looking padded snake tail, and a lot of papier-mache snake heads attached to a headdress. Hades, Lord of the Underworld and eldest brother of the first-generation Olympians, is standing there, looking ridiculous and embarrassed. He waves his hands vaguely, in response to their unasked questions. \"You know how it is when Persephone insists.\" \"All too well,\" they mutter in reply. \"I thought it was a bit tasteless myself, but Persephone and Hermes insisted that was the point. At least the illusion worked,\" he says, removing the headdress and tail hastily and tossing them aside. \"My apologies for any revisited trauma. Anyway, I was your last trial... now that's over with, you can go through here. My sister Hestia has festivities prepared.\" Another door appears, opening to reveal those two fucking monsters, waving cheerfully at them all, while Hestia busies herself in the background with something that smells spectacular. Apollo, Helios, Artemis, and Ares all stare for a moment through narrowed eyes. Apollo is certain they're all thinking of the same thing: revenge. What form it will take, and how quickly they may take it. But Siproites bursts ahead, catching Artemis' hand and calling for Lord Ares to hurry up; and Icarus comes up to take Apollo's and Helios' hand as well. Icarus looks ruffled and wired up and excited and alive. He's been thrilled by all the torment - another human thing that Apollo will never understand. But at the moment, he doesn't care. Icarus had fun, apparently, and he seems happy and unharmed. Apollo finds that's sufficient for him. He's content to cuddle with him and Helios on the couch and eat some of Hestia's finest. Hermes is still fucking toast later, though.",

      "He's spent twenty very... busy minutes, in Poseidon's cave, which took him totally by surprise, particularly when the damn Kraken came out and caught him up in its tentacles.",
      "Poseidon is a fucking dirty old man!!",
      "He better not have showed Aphrodite like he threatened to!",
      "He's been chased by giant spiders, chased by zombies, turned into a zombie, and had a spell cast on him by Hecate that made him sing a song about how much he admired Queen Persephone and had a huge crush on Lord Hermes.",
      "Which wasn't scary necessarily, but it was deeply annoying and embarrassing, and it was six stanzas long, and they both had laughed and Hermes had swooped in for a sneak-attack kiss afterwards, which Ares obviously hates.",
      "He's going to find that fucking punk and wring his neck.",
      "He'll punch him into the goddamn sun - then let those two assholes take a turn beating him up, because he's pretty sure he's heard their stupid voices yelling in rage too around this house of hell.",
      "Ares trips over still another headstone and this time faceplants hard, into very real-feeling dirt.",

      "Ares didn't really notice all the details and wouldn't have been impressed anyway.",
      "His favorite idiot is floundering around in the dark, growling threats at the world in general and Hermes in particular.",
      "As well as threatening the various bats that skitter around his head, and at the vines and roots that tangle his ankles, and at the headstones of the poor departed souls who can't really help being there in his way.",
      "Ares is wearing a werewolf costume, which involves ragged clothing and ruffled fur, so it's difficult to say how disheveled he's become since entering the haunted house, but the expression on his face tells a lot.",
      "Hermes does love flustering Ares: the god can always be counted on to give a good reaction, and stirs up his inner scaredy cat in hilarious ways.",
      "Plus, Hermes figured out a long time ago that Ares secretly loves these kinds of events.",
      "Contained survivalism allows him to direct his natural aggression and fighting instincts into something safe and socially acceptable.",
      "Unfortunately, one of the downsides to doing this in a group setting, is that the group tends to drain on him as a god of courage.",
      "Artemis, Apollo, Helios... even Icarus and little Siproites, they all are subconsciously calling on Ares' store of courage and strength to push forward in the face of scary challenges, even though Ares needs it himself here.",
      "Hermes can see he's struggling a little bit now.",
      "His frustration is beginning to get an edge.",
      "So Hermes decides to give Ares a break from the adrenaline.",
      "He's got to redirect the guy anyway; he's been headed in the direction of the portal that leads to the Wall Room - a room where the walls begin to close in on the victim, as though they'll be crushed.",
      "Of course, it's rigged so that the floor gives way and drops them to safety, but Hermes doesn't want Ares anywhere near it.",
      "The Aloadai and their jar might feel like a long time ago to the rest of the gods...",
      "but the effect on Ares was permanent.",
      "He waits for Ares to pick himself up from the faceplant, smiles when he hears his own name being cursed for the millionth time tonight, and then swoops in behind Ares.",
      "\"Having trouble?",
      "You're supposed to go around the gravestones - not over them,\" he says, reaching out and tickling Ares' ribs.",
      "Ares whips around and throws a solid punch, that strikes only air as Hermes dodges it.",
      "\"You'll need another couple thousand years to land a punch on me,\" Hermes says smugly, before latching himself onto Ares' back, koala-style, hugging him tightly.",
      "\"You horrible little fucking shit!\"",
      "Ares snarls, but already losing steam and there's a clear note of relief in his voice, though he hides it well.",
      "Hermes hugs him tighter, feeling a bit of tension leaving his frame.",
      "\"I love you too, sweetie,\" he coos, planting a kiss on Ares' cheek and watching the blush spread even in the dark.",
      "Ares grumbles his usual (totally fake) protests and tries to assume a manly stance.",
      "Hermes smiles and climbs up to sit on Ares shoulders.",
      "He pats Ares' face and points in a direction; Ares goes, unquestioningly, in spite of all the abuse he's suffered at Hermes' hands tonight.",
      "The total trust makes Hermes almost feel a tiny bit guilty for the nonstop scary pranks, but he'll make it up to him later.",
      "\"We're thinking of starting to wrap up.",
      "The others are getting worn out.",
      "Well, Icarus and Sippy are anyway.",
      "The Wonder Twins are fine but unfortunately me and Persephone guessed wrong and sent them into the gross tunnel of bugs and slime too early, and now they're both pitching a fit.\"",
      "Ares, who had waded through that same gross tunnel about ten minutes before the twins and hadn't been fazed, snorts in amusement.",
      "\"Mighta guess Sunshine couldn't take it, but I thought Arty was tougher than that.\"",
      "\"She thinks it's incredibly disgusting, but she usually keeps a lid on it better.",
      "When she's with Apoop, she lets her guard down a little more,\" Hermes informs him cheerfully.",
      "\"Good to know.\"",
      "\"So, anyway.",
      "We're gonna get people into teams again and kinda prod everyone towards the exit.\"",
      "\"Teams?\" Ares had been dragged in alone, of course, because he's a lot harder to scare with other people around.",
      "If he'd been with the sun gods, there would have been a lot of manly posturing preventing his inner cowardice from shining through; if he'd been with Arty, there'd be too much friendly horsing around; if he'd been with the nymph or the mortal, his protective side would have come out too strong.",
      "That protective side is what Hermes needs right now, though.",
      "\"Yup - well, like I said, the Wonder Twins are wading through slime together, and Icarus is about to free Helios from prison.\"",

      "\"I fucking knew he would!!",
      "I know you fucks have hidden cameras around here, you better let me see that shit - \" \"Hephaestus has a highlight reel going that we'll play at the party afterwards,\" Hermes tells him.",

      "\"Yeah.",

      "Nice fireplace, seasonal snacks, spiked cider...",
      "so you better hurry!\"",

      "\"And go save your partner!\"",
      "Siproites stares, as the girl rises out of the well.",
      "Half her body is bone white; the other half is midnight black.",
      "She appears to be dressed with a Gothic Lolita look, which is... actually really cute, and Siproites was briefly distracted from her fear, in order to squeal mentally over the cute little buttons and ruffles on the dress the Girl in the Well is wearing.",
      "She's opening her mouth to say something about how she was going to wear something Gothic Loli-style tonight but went with a cute panda look instead, but then the girl smiles and whispers something into the air.",
      "The ground erupts with ghosts.",
      "Siproites shrieks and stumbles away, as the ghosts all open their mouths, or at any rate a hole gapes in the blank white faces and the most horrible noise pours out.",
      "It's kind of a moan and kind of a scream and it's loud and terrifying and Siproites freezes - \"Sippy!!\"",
      "Her name is shouted from the other side and suddenly - Lord Ares is there!",
      "He charges directly through and past the ghosts, who look nonplussed and irritated, and without even breaking his stride he scoops her up and into his arms and continues tearing through the graveyard, straight towards a mausoleum.",
      "The ghosts are all starting to drift after them, still shrieking, and it's all very frightening, but at the same time Siproites is trying very hard to keep her skirt at least somewhat modestly in place, and trying not to get too in a flap over the fact that the handsome and gallant Lord Ares appeared from nowhere to rescue her.",
      "\"What were you doing, dummy??",
      "Just standing there staring at her!\"",
      "Lord Ares' manners are, well, rough; but Siproites has been living with Lady Artemis for a very long time and such things have long ceased to faze her.",
      "\"Her dress was very cute!",
      "It made me think maybe she wasn't one of the- the Scaries, but maybe another person running around!\"",
      "Lord Ares adjusts his grip on her - in this new position, her modesty is saved, which is just one of the small gestures of kindness Siproites would expect from such a gentleman.",
      "He runs up to the mausoleum, which has two doors, firmly shut.",
      "\"Yeah, that's fair.",
      "But that was Melinoe.",
      "I guess you wouldn't have seen her before.\"",
      "\"Queen Persephone's daughter!\"",
      "\"And King Hades, yeah,\"Lord Ares quirks his lips in amusement before giving the mausoleum doors a solid kick.",
      "The heavy stone doors fly open, breaking the hinges and they fall to the ground, cracking into several pieces.",
      "The inside of the mausoleum is oppressively dark, and a cold, foul-smelling air drifts out of it.",
      "Lord Ares steps over the rubble and puts his hand out to her.",
      "Siproites takes it, barely noticing the train of ghosts coming after them.",
      "\"Cute costume, by the way,\" Lord Ares says, distractedly, peering through the murk.",
      "Siproites beams.",
      "\"Ohh, thank you!",
      "I made it myself!\"",
      "She'd asked Lady Athena to help her with the cap with the pom-poms on it to represent the ears, and had been quite proud of her efforts.",
      "\"You look very dashing in your costume, too!\"",
      "Lord Ares does look very cool in his wolf costume, or at least Siproites thinks so.",
      "She's a big fan of Lord Ares.",
      "He was one of the first people outside of Lady Artemis' Grove to support her new place in the world as a woman, all those years ago.",
      "And he's so funny, and chivalrous and handsome besides!",
      "He's one of very, very few men that Lady Artemis allows into her Grove, so you couldn't ask for a better recommendation of character.",
      "\"Come on, idiot!\"",
      "Lord Ares breaks her reverie and hurries her down the steps of the mausoleum, into the darkness, as the ghosts mill about the broken doors and shriek at them.",
      "He takes her hand and guides her through, carefully.",
      "\"You can be such a little ditz,\" he says, but she knows his tones by now and he sounds both annoyed and fond, which is what you have to hope for from him.",
      "They go deeper into the tunnel and the wailing behind them fades until there's nothing but silence.",
      "It's creepy, but the God of Courage is here with her, so Siproites contents herself to follow behind him as he mutters his usual curses and threats against Lord Hermes and leads them into the darkness.",
      "The Titan of the Sun is wearing a sexy cat costume and sulking from where he sits, trapped in a cage suspended over the ground.",
      "He could break out, of course, but Persephone had told him he'd better not; he'd better sit put and wait till someone came to rescue his ass.",
      "She drew a finger over her throat to show him she was serious.",
      "Helios rolled his eyes but didn't argue; he was absolutely on her turf here and no one defied Persephone.",
      "She'd caught him when he'd lost his cool in the stupidest room in this stupid house, which was a large swampy room with an enormous stupid frog with demonic eyes that breathed some kind of poison gas and roared like the Void of Chaos.",
      "Whatever, it was lame and dumb, but he'd had a brief moment where he overreacted and yelled for someone to get him out of the room so she'd gone in and dragged him out and put him in this cage.",
      "To ease the indignity a little, she'd given him some tea from Hestia and put on some Halloween cartoons for him to watch while he waited.",
      "Helios had told her she'd better not let fucking Apollo see him like this; and she'd assured him that Apollo was bearing his own burdens at the moment.",
      "Really, it's incredible how much she and Hermes like to see people suffer.",
      "If they'd brought Eros in on this mess then the trifecta of Fucking With People would have been complete and the entire ordered world could be brought to an end.",
      "The room where he's sitting and watching Charlie Brown is otherwise decorated like a witch's hut.",
      "Spooky shadows, cobwebbed corners, suspicious vials of liquid, a bubbling cauldron... and a black cat sitting on a shelf giving him a side-eye.",
      "Helios flips it off.",
      "He's definitely pulling off the sexy cat look better than this feline shithead.",
      "\"Helios - you're - in a cage.\"",
      "Helios looks over at the voice; it's Icarus!!",
      "Out of all the people in the group who he'd want to see him in this state...",
      "well, Helios would rather that none of them did, but at least the kid won't be an unbearable asshole about it forever.",
      "\"Mop-Head!",
      "Hurry up and get me down!",
      "The key's over there in that human skull.\"",
      "Icarus raises his eyebrows briefly at him and goes over to the skull.",
      "\"Soooooo....",
      "Why are you in a cage?\"",
      "\"That asshole Hermes.",
      "And Persephone the ringleader.\"",
      "\"Well, yeah I figured that much, but - actually, it doesn't matter.",
      "None of my business.\"",
      "\"Yeah, good call.",
      "Hurry up, Mop-Head, I saw Erichtho go through earlier and believe me that we don't want to be here if she comes back.",
      "Ugh.",
      "Give me a witch like Circe or Medea any day.\"",
      "\"Circe and Medea I know, but... Erichtho?\" Icarus asks, finding a keyring in the skull and bringing it over to try them on the lock to Helios' cage.",
      "\"Crazy, hideous, corpse-eating necromancer witch.",
      "Generally lives in cemeteries but I guess they hauled her out for the occasion.\"",
      "\"Oh... really?\"",
      "Icarus shakes his head, finding a key that turns neatly in the lock.",
      "\"Well, luckily I have you to protect me again.\"",
      "Coming from anyone else, this would sound snarky, given that Helios is being released from a cage and was clearly not protecting anyone, and he gets pretty easily spooked regardless of anything else.",
      "But Icarus gives him that small smile and takes his hand and Helios pulls him into an enormous hug.",
      "\"You got it, Kiddo!",
      "You got me looking out for you from here on!\"",
      "Not two minutes later, he's latched onto Icarus' back, riding him piggy-back style while burying his face in Icarus' neck.",
      "\"I really wish you could walk,\" Icarus complains, but with no heat.",
      "\"You look like one of those zombies on Ocarina of Time.\"",
      "\"I don't know what that means, but you need to shuffle along a little faster,\" Helios snaps.",
      "They're in another room of illusion - this one transforms them so that they take on the appearance of zombies, including the shuffling gait.",
      "This was first startling, then a little amusing.",
      "They laughed at each other's dull, drooling expressions, the slumped posture, the random bones that appeared to poke out of green skin but felt only like air if you tried to touch them.",
      "But then they started to proceed through the room, or series of rooms.",
      "The rooms were large, and made mazelike by the placement of large piles of boxes or piled furniture, and 'walls' of chain link fencing.",
      "Bloodstained handprints occasionally decorate flat surface areas.",
      "They could hear eerie groans somewhere hidden in the rooms, and out of the corner of their eyes, they could just barely see the shape of something else shuffling along.",
      "Then, occasionally, they'll turn a corner and see two zombies immediately in front of them - a mirror, showing only themselves, but the effect is alarming and keeps catching them off guard.",
      "It's unsettling and creepy.",
      "It ain't Helios' bag.",
      "He normally floats above the world and all its creepy problems; he's not used to having to - to deal with all this spooky stuff.",
      "It was always happening down there, not in his face!",
      "So he latches onto Icarus, who's probably much better familiar with zombies and knows just what to do, and they shuffle through the zombie maze that way, slowly and with a great deal of complaining.",
      "They get to a room that's larger than the others, and it's mostly empty, save for a h. uge 'ambient' puddle of blood on the floor.",
      "Oh, and a figure in rags, standing off to the side and facing the wall, swaying slightly in place but otherwise still and silent.",
      "Just past this figure is an ornate door, different from all the rest.",
      "Certainly the portal out.",
      "Icarus tightens his grip on Helios' legs, and Helios has enough presence of mind to file that sensory memory away for consideration later.",
      "They step cautiously into the room.",
      "On their other side, set off by nothing at all, something (a stick?",
      "A bone?) clatters to the floor, making a noise that echoes in the silence.",
      "The figure turns around, revealing a sunken face with gray and rotting skin, and teeth visible in the absence of lips.",
      "\"Oh! Uh.",
      "Are you, are you, another visitor?",
      "Like us?",
      "Um, we're looking for a way out of the room, maybe that door you're standing by?",
      "Maybe we could check it out?\" Icarus, the sweet dummy, is doing that thing he does when he's nervous, which is to make awkward small talk at a babbling pace.",
      "Charms the hell out of the gods... but Helios recognizes this figure.",
      "She'd been a demigoddess once, but now she was little more than a monster, and no amount of charm, threats, or pleas will reach her.",
      "\"Fuck.",
      "Come on, Icarus, that's Erichtho!!\"",
      "In the back of his mind, Helios knows that Hecate must be nearby, keeping an eye on her monstrous servant.",
      "But Helios also knows that gods and witches alike have misjudged the power of monsters, and the fate of Erichtho's victims is gruesome and terrible.",
      "He reaches down and grabs the front of Icarus' shirt while dropping to his own feet, using the motion to flip Icarus over onto his own shoulder, and hauls.",
      "Well, as fast as he's able with the damn zombie curse still slowing his legs.",
      "Erichtho opens her mouth in a horrifying, unearthly shriek, and starts after them.",
      "She's moving much faster than she should be able to.",
      "He race-shambles as fast as he can.",
      "Icarus twists around to try to see, and gasps.",
      "\"Shit!!",
      "Helios, shuffle faster!",
      "She's like ten feet away!!\"",
      "\"Fuck!!\"",
      "Helios is going to pummel Hermes!",
      "And Persephone too, he's not scared of her!",
      "And Hecate, for good measure!",
      "But Hermes most of all, that little shit.",
      "They reach the door and Helios can smell her, the reek of corpse and wrongness, and fuck but Helios wishes he could just go full sun and burn the shit out of this whole place but he'd burn Icarus too if he did...",
      "He yanks the door handle open just as the zombie witch grabs Icarus and by his long, trailing robe and pulls him towards her.",
      "Icarus panics and starts thrashing around.",
      "\"Shit! Helios!!\"",
      "Helios wheels around and kicks hard at the witch, whose mouth has widened far more than should be naturally possible.",
      "He does break her grip on Icarus, but knocks them both off-balance.",
      "Erichtho howls at them as Helios and Icarus stumble backwards through the door, where they immediately fall down into darkness.....",
      "Apollo smacks his head yet again into the low ceiling of this Nyx-cursed darkness - he and Artemis have been wandering for a while in a maze where no light can be seen.",
      "It has to be Nyx, because even Apollo can't summon any light here.",
      "The twists and turns are easy enough to miss that the twins have been forced to hold hands in order not to lose each other in the maze.",
      "Artemis hears the clunk of his forehead hitting a low part of the ceiling and laughs.",
      "\"S'what you get for being so tall, 'Pollo!\"",
      "she teases, just before tripping over some unseen obstacle and falling heavily to the ground, hand yanked out of Apollo's grip.",
      "Apollo's delighted schadenfreude overrules his aloofness and he cackles at her.",
      "\"It seems hubris isn't only a hazard for mortals, Big Sister!\"",
      "\"Oh, shut up,\" she gripes sourly.",
      "\"Gimme your hand, jerkass.\"",
      "They both reach out and take a hand again.",
      "There's a long pause.",
      "\"Are you...?\"",
      "Artemis sounds confused.",
      "There's some rustling noises.",
      "\"You have boobs?!\"",
      "\"Eeek, L-Lady Artemis!",
      "Is that - you?!\"",
      "\"Sippy??",
      "What are you doing sneaking around?!\"",
      "\"Ahh, we didn't expect to find you here!",
      "We just got teleported here after the cemetery!\"",
      "\"That's lucky!",
      "Oh, and... please excuse my grope, heh.\"",
      "Apollo interrupts whatever the nymph is about to say.",
      "\"Wait - then whose hand -??\" \"Sunshine?!\"",
      "He and Ares rip their hands away from each other as though touching fire.",
      "\"Ah, Ares!",
      "Good to see you survived another Halloween with Hermes!\"",
      "Artemis sounds happy, at least.",
      "\"It isn't over yet,\" the oaf mutters.",
      "Correctly.",
      "As though in direct response to this observation, there's a popping noise and the distinct sensation of a portal opening, and then there's a person in Apollo's arms, yelling and thrashing around.",
      "\"Shit!",
      "The zombie got me!!\"",
      "\"Hold on, I'll get it!\"",
      "And then Apollo receives a punch in the stomach.",
      "\"Ow, fuck!",
      "Damn it, Helios!\"",
      "The person in his arms stills.",
      "\"Wait, what?",
      "Apollo?\"",
      "A gasp from nearby.",
      "\"Apollo?",
      "I punched you??",
      "I'm sorry!",
      "I'm really sorry, it was instinct, I swear!\"",
      "Apollo's impressed, actually - he had assumed the punch had come from Helios.",
      "Apparently, adrenaline gives Icarus quite a boost of strength.",
      "Apollo drops Helios unceremoniously to the ground, ignoring the curse that results and reaches out to take Icarus' hands.",
      "\"No matter, Icarus, I'm simply glad to see you're all right.",
      "It sounds like you had a rough night too.\"",
      "Icarus laughs a little breathlessly.",
      "\"Yeah, we sure did.",
      "And you?",
      "What about Artemis and Sippy?\"",
      "\"We're here, kiddo.\"",
      "\"Yes, it was pretty scary!",
      "I hope I can compliment Queen Persephone on her efforts this year!\"",
      "\"They outdid themselves this year, to be sure.",
      "I hope to 'compliment' Hermes, too,\" Apollo says drily.",
      "\"You may have a chance to pay them your compliments - if you survive your final trial,\" comes an unfamiliar and booming voice.",
      "There's light, suddenly, and it illuminates a nightmare that Ares hasn't seen in thousands of years.",
      "Typhon, the great and terrible monster birthed by Gaia and Tartarus in revenge for the gods' victory over the giants, stands before them.",
      "A massive snake's coils merge hellishly to a man's torso, and is topped by one hundred snake heads, each spitting fire.",
      "A roaring shakes the ground and fills their ears with cacophony.",
      "The last time Apollo saw this nightmarish creature was thousands of years ago, and he'd fled from the sight of it.",
      "Turned into a bird and flew to Egypt, along with Artemis and every other god....",
      "Except Athena.",
      "And even Athena could do no more in the face of the beast but to shout encouragement to Zeus, who fought Typhon alone and barely triumphed in the cataclysmic battle.",
      "Apollo knows - knows - that it's impossible for Typhon to be here.",
      "He's been destroyed for millennia, and buried beneath the earth.",
      "And yet, the reaction of terror is visceral and he finds himself holding Artemis' hand again, as they had so long ago when they were still barely more than children facing it.",
      "Then he sees Ares, looking haggard and just as terrified as the rest, but he's shouting something at Siproites and shoving her at Icarus.",
      "The nymph clutches at Icarus and starts to run away with him as Ares shimmers, and Apollo realizes at the moment that he's shifting to his true form.",
      "He's going to try to fight Typhon.",
      "It's death.",
      "Typhon is death.",
      "And yet, Apollo realizes that the only imaginable way that Icarus will survive this is if these gods confront Typhon alone while Siproites runs for help.",
      "So he takes Helios' hand on one side, and Artemis' on the other, and they stand, grimly, in their ridiculous Halloween costumes, facing Typhon....Typhon, who speaks again, in a considerably less booming voice.",
      "\"All right, all right.",
      "Well.",
      "You lot really are worked up.",
      "Compliments to Persephone indeed.\"",
      "The gods, all states of half-transformation, freeze and stare, blinking.",
      "Typhon raises his hands made of swords and snakes and makes a 'calm down' gesture with them.",
      "\"Nymph.",
      "You may return with the mortal - Olympians, return to your human forms already.\"",
      "They do so, bewildered.",
      "It's Apollo who finally ventures a guess: the voice sounds familiar now... \"Uncle...?",
      "King Hades?\"",
      "And suddenly, the most terrifying scourge of the entire history of the earth is just their uncle's tall, sharply-angled form, wearing a costume that's revealed to be a ridiculously fake-looking padded snake tail, and a lot of papier-mache snake heads attached to a headdress.",
      "Hades, Lord of the Underworld and eldest brother of the first-generation Olympians, is standing there, looking ridiculous and embarrassed.",
      "He waves his hands vaguely, in response to their unasked questions.",
      "\"You know how it is when Persephone insists.\"",
      "\"All too well,\" they mutter in reply.",
      "\"I thought it was a bit tasteless myself, but Persephone and Hermes insisted that was the point.",
      "At least the illusion worked,\" he says, removing the headdress and tail hastily and tossing them aside.",
      "\"My apologies for any revisited trauma.",
      "Anyway, I was your last trial... now that's over with, you can go through here.",
      "My sister Hestia has festivities prepared.\"",
      "Another door appears, opening to reveal those two fucking monsters, waving cheerfully at them all, while Hestia busies herself in the background with something that smells spectacular.",
      "Apollo, Helios, Artemis, and Ares all stare for a moment through narrowed eyes.",
      "Apollo is certain they're all thinking of the same thing: revenge.",
      "What form it will take, and how quickly they may take it.",
      "But Siproites bursts ahead, catching Artemis' hand and calling for Lord Ares to hurry up; and Icarus comes up to take Apollo's and Helios' hand as well.",
      "Icarus looks ruffled and wired up and excited and alive.",
      "He's been thrilled by all the torment - another human thing that Apollo will never understand.",
      "But at the moment, he doesn't care.",
      "Icarus had fun, apparently, and he seems happy and unharmed.",
      "Apollo finds that's sufficient for him.",
      "He's content to cuddle with him and Helios on the couch and eat some of Hestia's finest.",
      "Hermes is still fucking toast later, though."

    "text": "Blake Nguyen comes barreling out of the back room at the Big Bean, triumphantly announcing \"I found it!\" without first observing that the Big Bean's regional manager had stopped in for a surprise visit that day and was quizzing Icarus on store policies and 'his thoughts' on the business. It's more than a small relief when the man turns his attention to Blake, who's now realized who it is. \"Ah, another employee hard at work!\" the manager says with fake joviality. \"Found what?\" \"Good afternoon sir, what a surprise to see you! I found the flyers we'd printed out for the upcoming International Coffee Day event this week. We were running low up on them up front, and no one could remember where they were placed. You see, a few of us are participating in the live entertainment, in order to promote the cafe... here, let me show you one of them...\" Blake's all smiles and smooth obsequiousness. He's really, really good at 'managing' the managers, and he subtly interposes himself between Icarus and the other man. Icarus is thankful that Blake's taken over making the man dance to his puppet strings, laughing at the lame jokes and giving that fake customer-service smile, but unfortunately, he sees another danger. The sun gods had been reclining in the uncomfortable cafe chairs, pretending to drink their beverages and munch pastries, while watching Icarus try to fend off the manager's prying questions. Both of them give him suspicious, curious looks at the mention of the event. Icarus tries to ignore them as he goes back to counting the till and wiping down the countertop. The bell rings around fifteen minutes later as the manager exits the cafe, and Blake wanders over to Icarus. His usual facial expression is back - something like a cross between a fierce resting bitch face, and a constant low-key annoyance. Icarus has been told before that they have amusingly similar facial expressions. \"What I actually found, was that YouTube video, with Game of Thrones acted out by sheep. Here, check it out.\" He hands his phone over to Icarus, who watches: it's exactly as advertised. \"I can't believe you happened to have the flyers in your hand,\" he says, watching as a tiny baby sheep appears to slap a larger sheep wearing a crown, with Tyrion's and Joffrey's voices superimposed. \"You have to keep props ready at all times. You never know when some asshole will wander through and need to be dealt with. You'll learn, young grasshopper.\" Blake takes a stunningly cynical view of how to play the people in charge. He can switch from fawningly helpful sycophant to irritated foul-mouthed conman and back without batting an eye. But the professors, managers, and anyone else Blake works his magic on, they all eat it up and never doubt him. It's equal parts horrifying and inspiring. Currently, Blake is digging through his pocket for cigarettes and a lighter. \"I need a smoke after that crap. Be back in a few minutes.\" \"Sure, okay,\" Icarus replies, and braces himself. He doesn't have to wait long. As soon as Blake disappears through the back door, Apollo and Helios are sidling up to the counter. \"So. 'International Coffee Day' this week, is it?\" Apollo asks, drumming his fingers casually on the countertop. \"How interesting,\" Helios agrees. \"I wonder if that's the 'boring work thing' written on the calendar on your refrigerator for the same date and time. You've become quite dissembling lately, Icarus; I think Helios has been a bad influence on you.\" \"Yeah - hey!\" \"You vultures can stop circling,\" Icarus informs them. \"I'm not part of the live entertainment crew, so it is gonna be boring for me, I'm just making coffee all afternoon. We drew straws and Blake's stuck dancing.\" \"I'll admit I'm disappointed that you won't be performing, but surely you know we'd want to spend time with you.\" \"Yeah, and this flyer makes it look like fun! Music, dancing, raffles... it's the most interesting thing you've done for work yet, why wouldn't you want to invite us?\" Helios is waving the damn sheet around - why did Blake have to use that as his prop?! \"Because you guys are gonna make trouble and be annoying!\" \"We certainly will not!\" Apollo says, affronted, at the exact same moment that Helios shoots back with \"Yeah, so?\" They glance at each other for a moment before Apollo clears his throat. \"In any case, there's no room for discussion. It's decided; we will attend your boring work thing in order to spend more quality time with our favorite mortal,\" he says firmly, apparently dismissing the need for any further thoughts from the favorite mortal. Icarus drops his head to the counter in resignation and savagely hopes that Blake's costume for the entertainment looks really stupid. ---------- The costume does look really stupid, and it pleases Icarus to see it. The coffee shop has a small stage for when it hosts live bands or book/poetry readings, and currently it's Blake's corner of Hell where he's made to dance to sanitized versions of pop music. He's wearing a furry suit, basically: a bunny wearing a beret, inexplicably, and a t-shirt with the Big Bean logo on it. In spite of the heat and the humiliation, though, he's up there giving his dance moves 100%, possibly because the bunny mask disguises his identity. Blake has got moves. A gracefulness and athleticism that was apparently freed from the short, grouchy young man when he put on the bunny suit. Icarus has no idea how he's managing to do The Worm while wearing that bulky fur armor but he's making it work. Icarus is staring openly, a half-grin on his face, while Blake catches his breath with a simple Cabbage Patch (albeit with a lot more hip-swaying that Icarus could manage); then merges neatly into modified MC Hammer shuffle and finishes with a spectacular death drop, all to an acoustic version of P!nk's \"Get the Party Started.\" He's clapping with everyone else and cheering when he finally glances over and notices the customer standing there patiently waiting for service. \"Oh! My apologies, I didn't see you standing there!\" Icarus hurriedly activates the register. The customer waves his hand unconcernedly. \"No worries. I also was captivated by the performance. It's quite good!\" There's a hint of an accent, though Icarus can't quite place it. This customer is exceptionally attractive: a man in perhaps his mid-twenties with dark skin, bright green eyes, a flawless half-shave haircut and neat short beard. And a warm, inviting smile. No one else is in line, so Icarus smiles back. \"Isn't he? I never would have guessed he'd be capable! Never saw this kind of action before today.\" The customer looks surprised. \"You know the dancer?\" \"Oh sure, he works here normally. He's just dancing for the event.\" \"I had supposed he must have been a professional. Even with the handicap of the unfortunate suit, his dancing was so graceful, so expressive.\" \"I'm starting to wonder myself - maybe he's been keeping it a secret all this time.\" The customer smiles and rests his elbow on the countertop. He's quite tall, Icarus notices. \"I suppose there is not much opportunity to demonstrate certain skills in such a job. I would bet that all the workers here have secret talents that one would not normally get to see. Perhaps you? You have a secret talent as well?\" The customer winks. Icarus fights a blush. \"Ahaha, nope, my only talent is for making Big, Beautiful, Beany Coffee,\" he recites the company's motto. \"That is a terrible slogan. Please, it pains me to see such a sweet young man forced to utter such words.\" Icarus puts his hand over his eyes and chuckles, shaking his head. \"Sir, please.\" The customer laughs with him, soft and low. Icarus notices he has dimples. \"I must practice my charm, yes? How else to impress the man with such a talent for coffee?\" He straightens up and gestures and the special event menu, including some fairly unusual flavors. \"Please, surprise me with something exciting. Such passionate dancing shown by your friend has left me in a mood to experience all that life has to offer.\" Icarus chews his lip briefly and considers if what he's about to do would be out of line. \"...May I make a suggestion?\" ------------------------------------ Apollo glares, furiously, at the presumptuous man flirting brazenly with Icarus - Apollo is not close enough to hear their conversation, but it is clear that Icarus is smiling and nodding and enjoying the attention. The final straw comes when he sees Icarus leaning in close to the man, to speak to him conspiratorially and whatever he says, makes the man's face light up, while that small, knowing smile tugs at his mouth. Icarus gives the man a cup of one of the disgusting, heavily-sweetened brewed swill drinks that modern mortals find so compelling, and points at the coffee-themed clock on the wall. Perhaps telling him when he is off shift, and available for more flirting. Apollo doesn't actually doubt Icarus - at least, not in this instance. Apollo knows that he, personally, the god of the sun and knowledge and music and other blessed things, and the most beautiful of gods, simply doesn't have competition here. So no, he isn't worried. But Icarus is an innocent soul, and might be susceptible to unfiltered charm from even a clearly unsavory inferior being. Nevertheless, Apollo isn't the god he was thousands of years ago. He's mature now, and keeps his cool, no matter how provoked. So he doesn't storm over - he saunters, casually and unconcernedly. He leans, also casually and unconcernedly, over the countertop, He rests his elbow casually on cheap faux-wood, and fixes a calm and unconcerned death glare on the impudent suitor. \"Icarus. Good afternoon. It's a pity you've been so busy with all of these customers. I've hardly had a chance to see you, my lover, all day.\" Icarus looks mortified. \"Apollo!\" The flirtatious man clearly takes the hint, but instead of being cowed or apologetic, his eyes crinkle in amusement and he ineffectively attempts to hide his smile by taking a drink of his swill. \"Ahh - yes, this drink is delightful, as you said it would be. I apologize for imposing on so much of your time; I should leave you to your, ah-hah, lover now.\" \"He's not - you weren't - ahh, sir, I apologize about this - \" \"Nonsense. He is your lover, no? Love makes us all act foolish. I think it is endearing.\" The man nods to them both and retires away to a table, turning his attention once again to the dancing rabbit-man. \"Apollo, that was extremely rude,\" Icarus chastises him, folding his arms over his chest in disapproval. Apollo shrugs unapologetically. \"His behavior was unacceptable. Whether he realized it or not, he was flirting with another man's lover, and an intervention was called for.\" Icarus' frown deepens, this time in confusion. \"You think - oh, this is ridiculous. He was not flirting with me, Apollo!\" \"His conversation with you clearly overstepped the bounds of a typical merchant-customer relationship.\" \"I - I mean, yeah, we were talking about something else, but it wasn't - you know what? I don't have time for this right now. Just, he wasn't, okay? Trust me on this.\" Apollo sighs heavily and shakes his head, helping himself to one of the almond cookies on display. The boy is naive and innocent. Apollo determines not to hold it against Icarus if he can't recognize flirting when he sees it. He'll keep his eye on this would-be usurper, though. ------------------------------------------- Helios had no strong opinion on this Blake kid, prior to seeing him at the coffee party. He's just another of Icarus' boring mortal co-workers, though he is pretty easy to wind up, which makes him a little more fun than the unflappable old people at the flower shop, or the kids at the retail agora who are all too burned out to give a shit. Blake takes the bait every time - at least, he did once he realized that the gods were 'friends' and not 'customers.' So Helios didn't mind Blake, particularly since Icarus didn't seem to favor Blake's company over the gods. HOWEVER. The kid has currently danced his way to Helios' shit list, where he currently holds the top spot. And yeah, yeah, Helios knows he'll find someone else to be pissed at soon enough, but just look at him! Blake has been displaying a wholly unexpected set of dance moves, startling from either of Blake's personality sets - the uptight suckup or the mouthy grouch. The kid in the bunny suit is shimmying and jamming and shaking his ass! Helios laughed at first, as delighted as everyone else, until he sees that Icarus is also watching attentively. Icarus is staring at Blake with a rare smile on his face, which expands into a bout of full, genuine laughter when Blake does something interesting on the stage. He claps at the end of the songs. He cheers. Helios scowls. Now he turns a more critical eye to Blake's dance moves. Yup, that kid is definitely working Icarus over. No question. It's difficult to tell exactly where Blake's looking, hidden as he is beneath the bunny mask and suit, but Helios is certain he's pointed the suit in the direction of the cash registers more than anywhere else, and the mask is facing that way too. There was a movie Helios watched with Icarus a while back - a female character accused a male of performing pelvic sorcery on her. Helios had adored the phrase at the time, and used it all the time, especially when talking about Apollo. But now the pelvic sorcery is being used to undermine him, and Helios does not like it. \"I Gotta Feelin\" finishes and Blake performs some kind of hands-free cartwheel that nets him applause once again from the customers watching. See, that's the other thing, there's like twenty people in this ship right now. There's no way Blake's turning on the moves for twenty random assholes here to buy coffee. He doesn't even like his job! So there's no reason he'd be going this hard unless he's trying to impress someone. And it's apparently working: Icarus cheers and claps and beams. Blake bows and retreats to the back to take a break. Helios stalks after him. Yeah, yeah, he knows - he can't just kill rivals anymore. Zeus disapproves, and Helios tries to avoid getting on his bad side. And he can't really retaliate at all, not really, or Icarus would be upset. Not that Helios even needs to check in on Zeus or Icarus, because Helios is totally mature about these things. Not like Apoop or Aphrodite or whatever. He's completely chill about matters of romance. But \"completely chill\" certainly doesn't mean he has to roll over and let this kid do his pelvic sorcery on Icarus. So he follows Blake to the back room, and finds the kid sitting there in the open doorway leading to the shipping entrance, smoking a cigarette. The bunny mask lies discarded on a box of coffee beans a few feet away. Blake looks over at where Helios is approaching him. \"Oh - uh, Helios, right? Hey, man, just so you know, you're not supposed to be - \" \"I don't care about the store rules and neither do you,\" Helios cuts off the kid's obligatory protest. Blake, who really doesn't care about store rules, shrugs and takes another drag off his cigarette. \"But listen here, kiddo. I'm not angry, okay? I don't do 'angry.' I'm not pissed and I'm not jealous! But you better knock off the pelvic sorcery out there.\" Blake stares at him, eyebrows lifting slightly, cigarette smoke drifting from the stick between his fingers. \"Uh... what?\" \"Out there,\" Helios jerks his head in the direction of the stage, out in the main part of the shop. \"All your little hip-wiggling?\" He demonstrates; Blake's eyes bulge. \"I'm just telling you this for your own good. Icarus is spoken for. Aim your ass at someone else.\" Blake's face does something complicated and he makes an interesting noise. \"Oh-okay. No worries, man, I'll, uh. I'll aim my - oh, jeez. Icarus is totally safe from me.\" \"Yeah, you do that. And don't try to get cute; I'm keeping my eyes on you.\" He does the thing where he points at his eyes and then points at Blake. Blake makes that noise again and his shoulders tremble - good. Helios hopes he put a little fear in the kid. It's not that he doesn't like him, but Icarus belongs to Helios! And sometimes Apollo. But definitely not this pelvic sorcerer. --------------- The god of love watches Helios strut out of the back room. He grins to himself; poor Blake! Luckily someone should be along momentarily to cheer him up. Assuming that gentleman can tear himself away from Apollo's watchful eyes. Eros waits patiently, hidden from view behind a fortress of stock boxes. It smells terrific in here. This is probably one of the more pleasant environments he's carried out his duties in - he's certainly worked in worse conditions many times before. Most of the time, really. This time, he's sitting around reading nudie magazines while sipping stolen tea. The only way it could be improved is if Psyche or Gany or Hermes was here to watch the show with him - or if he was allowed to bring out his wings. He's got them hidden at the moment, because it's tough to discreetly blend in with mortals while he's got a fifteen-foot wingspan knocking over all the fragile coffee mugs and stacks of cookies. Of course, his other features make him stand out a little too, but humans find it easier to overlook these details. Eros mostly takes after his mom - a deceptively soft, round frame with a soft, round face. His head is topped with fluffy pink hair and his grin is wide and beaming and inviting. He did inherit his dad's blood-red eyes, although on Eros, it mostly serves to highlight the cotton-candy hair. He's seen at least one other human today with similarly-colored hair, and it makes him grin to see it. Ahh - here comes his agent, now. Icarus, the sun idiots' paramour, is coming in with two deep dishes of affogato. Vanilla gelato topped with a shot of hot espresso - affogato means 'drowned', because it's ice cream 'drowned' in coffee. This makes it hilariously inappropriate for Icarus to be serving, though Eros doesn't think he knows what 'affogato' means. It also happens to be Blake's favorite dessert, though it's usually too expensive for him to buy or discreetly steal. \"Yo, Icarus. Your boyfriends are fuckin' weird,\" Blake tells him without preamble, seeing his co-worker entering. \"Yeah, sorry. Their jealousy is over 9000 today,\" Icarus says. \"One of em told me to quit with the pelvic sorcery I was apparently working on you. Sorry about that, man. I see you're still fully dressed though, so I guess I didn't make manage to make you tear your clothes off with all the sexy sex vibes I was throwing your way.\" Blake sounds amused. \"Nope. I resisted somehow,\" Icarus deadpans. He cuts Blake a look. \"Though it was a near thing. You definitely were throwing off the sexy sex vibes today...\" \"Yeah, well, there's a pretty hot guy in the crowd today. I know you noticed him, right? He went up to the counter once.\" \"Yeah. Yeah, I noticed.\" Icarus is hiding a smile. Blake tosses his cigarette into the ashtray with a sigh. \"What are you doing back here anyway? Aren't you supposed to be serving the customers?\" \"Technically, I am,\" Icarus sets the dishes of affogato down on a nearby box, which serves as a table now. Blake eyes them. \"Uh - that's - did someone forget those and leave em behind?\" \"Nope. Wait just a minute before you start eating them, okay?\" Blake's still asking questions but Icarus grins and exits back to the main shop. Blake stares suspiciously as the door shuts behind him. Eros grins wider and resists rubbing his hands together, but it's so satisfying when a plan comes together! Sure enough, a tall, handsome figure approaches from outside. He steps up to Blake and taps his shoulder. \"Excuse me. I was told that my order would be back here?\" \"You - uhhh?\" Blake, who normally has a sharp or witty response for anyone, is reduced to a stammering mess of blushes on the spot as Tomas, the handsome man from the cafe, stands before him, smiling slightly. The bunny suit only adds to the poignancy, in Eros' opinion. Eros squees a little, making his little victory symbol with his hands - a heart, with his thumbs and forefingers. He'd love to stay and spy on them, drinking in the success and watching the hilarity and romance, but he senses he's needed outside, immediately. He teleports to the side of the building, where, as predicted, Apollo and Helios are both marching back with grimly threatening looks on their brows. Eros appears immediately in front of them. \"Hey guys! Well hello there! And what brings you to this corner of the shop when your bae is running the coffee machines on the other side?\" \"You. I might have guessed,\" Apollo snarls. \"You're behind every romantic mishap that has ever befallen anyone.\" \"Ohh, c'mon, some people mishap themselves just fine,\" Eros declares. \"You lead dicks astray!\" Helios hisses. \"Not just dicks,\" Eros replies loftily. Helios should know better than that. Eros shot his sisters pretty good before. \"You're responsible for Icarus' interest in that young man,\" Apollo accuses. \"And for that guy doing the pelvic sorcery at him!\" \"Yes, and - what? Helios, what ridiculous term is that?\" \"It's what that guy was doing with his dancing!\" \"Helios, don't be an idiot. Blake was hired to dance. The problem suitor was the customer who came back here just now.\" \"What customer? Blake was the one dancing, and Icarus brought that dessert back for him...\" Eros watches this exchange with an increasingly smug smirk on his face. \"I see you two are exactly as ridiculous as you were a few thousand years ago, and exactly as clueless in matters of Luv. Same ol' Helios and Apollo.\" The sun idiots turn to look at him, golden eyes narrowing and glowing in unison. \"Explain yourself,\" Apollo demands. Eros drapes his arms over both of their shoulder, and brings out his wings for the heck of it, since they're all outside and alone now. \"Icarus had nothing to do with anything, my dear fellows, except to perform a few of the tasks for me on my little project.\" \"But - the impudent customer,\" Apollo protests, not ready to let go of his righteous anger yet. So predictable! \"And the pelvic sor-\" \"Stop using that phrase,\" Apollo snarls. \"You two are like balm for my soul,\" Eros tells them, steering them around to face the still-open back door to the coffee shop. Very visible within the doorframe is Blake, still wearing half the bunny suit; and Tomas, the handsome customer that Blake had a crush on. They're talking and eating their dessert. Blake's face is aflame and he keeps, grinning and laughing and stammering. Tomas is smiling and watching him intently and gestures while he tells a story in his soft, mild voice. \"Yes, it was one of my subtler efforts,\" Eros says. \"Took a long time to set up, and it stood a pretty good chance of not working out. Lots of factors, you know. I had to get Tomas there to notice the event and decide to attend. Had to make sure Blake drew the short straw so he could dance today. Had to get Icarus to learn Blake's 'type,' and his favorite coffee drink, had to make sure they were all in the right place at the right time...tricky stuff. Not like the old days, where I'd just shoot someone in the ass with my arrow, and let their dicks lead the way. And if I'd gotten that close to success, only for you two jealous clowns to wander through and wreck everything...\" Eros' red eyes briefly intensify, flickering threateningly. He's been told that it makes him look scarier than either Ares or Aphrodite; even scarier than both of them combined when he does this; mainly because everyone who sees it suddenly remembers Eros' capacity for vengeful chaos when provoked. Or even when he's just bored. But then his grin is back, and his hands tighten around their shoulders in a totally-not-threatening way (except for the part where there is definitely a subtle warning in the hug). \"Well, it doesn't matter, does it? Look at those two! There they are, flirting shamelessly. Hopelessly infatuated. And, 'scuse the shop talk, but they're totally horny for each other right now too. I have a little bet with myself - they're gonna start sucking face about an hour after Blake gets off shift. Probably do more sucking later, but Blake's actually shyer than you'd guess, so maybe - \" \"All right, that's enough. We get it,\" Apollo says sullenly. \"Well, actually, that's a good segue. You don't get it,\" Eros tells them. \"I like Icarus, so I'm gonna give you two a little free advice.\" Hard pass. Your advice always sucks. 0/10,\" Helios sneers. Shut up and listen,\" Eros says, seriously for a change. And yeah, he's a generation down from Apollo and three down from Helios the titan, but they both have learned a lot about his power over the centuries, because they both scowl furiously... but they're listening. \"You're on thin ice with him already. He doesn't remember everything but he knows enough. He's up to his ears in phobias, and he's bitter as fuck and he's trying to protect his heart. When you carry on like this, like he's your possession and you're just fighting over who gets to own him, it's not going to do you any favors. He died for your love, and didn't get it. Being catty over his customers and co-workers isn't going to impress him.\" Eros' squad had really been rooting for Icarus, back then. They'd all been heartbroken when Icarus had drowned. Anteros, Himeros, Pothos... but none more than Eros and Gany. Eros had been forced to watch the winged boy sink beneath the waves as water filled his lungs - sad enough on its own, but also a pretty symbolic death. Love gods had wings, after all. Gany had also taken the blow pretty hard. He had still been quite new to Olympus at the time, and had wanted to see another mortal win the love of the gods. He'd been composing a song about it, to celebrate when Icarus finally made it. He'd been so utterly crushed at the heartbroken boy, dead in the ocean and left to toss about and be eaten by sharks. Hebe had discreetly gone to visit her illicit beau, Hercules, and directed him to where he could find the body, so that Icarus could at least be honored with dignity at a funeral. This time, it's entirely different. The whole situation is reversed. The sun idiots are constantly competing for Icarus' attention, and Icarus himself has hardened his heart in self-protection. The kid doesn't even like to let himself smile around them, in case it gives him away, and he's genuinely distressed about it afterwards whenever he can't stop himself from smiling, from blushing, from feeling. An arrow would be a fast and easy way to force a solution... but Eros respects the Icarus who was willing to die for love. These two sun assholes are going to earn it this time. Eros hugs Apollo and Helios again, tightly, and beams innocently at them, nodding towards the besotted Blake and Tomas. Foul-mouthed, cynical Blake, grinning like a dumbass and drinking in every story that Tomas can think of to impress him. Eros can't wait to watch it pan out. \"Just look at those two for a success story. Just spending time together and liking each other. Sometimes it's just that easy.\" He lets them go. \"Anyway, I'll catch you later. I gotta go check in with Himeros and Anteros are staying on top of this, and then it's back to Psyche for me. Haven't seen that foxy lady in almost a week!\" Eros takes off before they can protest or start making excuses. Better to let them chew over the final word in the matter, and hope it sinks in. Besides, he really hasn't seen Psyche in almost a week, so he wants to stop by to pick up a bouquet (curated by Persephone herself, of course) before he goes back. ------------ Helios and Apollo are sullen for nearly ten minutes afterwards, glaring at where Blake and Tomas are unquestionably loving each other's company. They split up their conversation only when Blake realizes that he has to go back out and dance again. Tomas says something charming and dirty about Blake's ass, and they both laugh and part ways. \"Guess we misread that one,\" Helios sulks. \"And got a lecture, for our error,\" Apollo agrees, sounding irritated as well. Helios sighs. \"I really thought it would be easier if the kid couldn't remember the details.\" \"Yes, I did too. But evidently he remembers enough.\" \"I don't know how we can convince him we're not playing around this time,\" Helios admits quietly. There's silence for a moment, while they both reflect on this. \"Well,\" Apollo ventures finally, \"I suppose we'll just have to win him over by attrition of sorts. Just... keep wearing away at him with charm and interest and good intentions.\" Helios taps his chin. \"Hmm. Yeah. 'Persuasion is better than force...'\" \"Right, like your disagreement with Boreas.\" \"Fine. Well, we'll see if it's really 'just that easy,' like the Romantic Shithead seems to think.\" ----- They return back to the cafe, resolving to pay no mind to any customers and dancing rabbit co-workers. They'll instead focus only on showering Icarus with affection and praise. Icarus has no idea what happened, of course, but he can't decide if this is fun and charming, or if it's really, really annoying.",

      "He's really, really good at 'managing' the managers, and he subtly interposes himself between Icarus and the other man.",
      "Icarus is thankful that Blake's taken over making the man dance to his puppet strings, laughing at the lame jokes and giving that fake customer-service smile, but unfortunately, he sees another danger.",
      "The sun gods had been reclining in the uncomfortable cafe chairs, pretending to drink their beverages and munch pastries, while watching Icarus try to fend off the manager's prying questions.",
      "Both of them give him suspicious, curious looks at the mention of the event.",

      "Icarus is staring openly, a half-grin on his face, while Blake catches his breath with a simple Cabbage Patch (albeit with a lot more hip-swaying that Icarus could manage); then merges neatly into modified MC Hammer shuffle and finishes with a spectacular death drop, all to an acoustic version of P!nk's \"Get the Party Started.\"",

      "Apollo doesn't actually doubt Icarus - at least, not in this instance.",
      "Apollo knows that he, personally, the god of the sun and knowledge and music and other blessed things, and the most beautiful of gods, simply doesn't have competition here.",
      "So no, he isn't worried.",
      "But Icarus is an innocent soul, and might be susceptible to unfiltered charm from even a clearly unsavory inferior being.",
      "Nevertheless, Apollo isn't the god he was thousands of years ago.",
      "He's mature now, and keeps his cool, no matter how provoked.",
      "So he doesn't storm over - he saunters, casually and unconcernedly.",
      "He leans, also casually and unconcernedly, over the countertop, He rests his elbow casually on cheap faux-wood, and fixes a calm and unconcerned death glare on the impudent suitor.",

      "I apologize for imposing on so much of your time; I should leave you to your, ah-hah, lover now.\"",

      "He is your lover, no? Love makes us all act foolish.",
      "I think it is endearing.\"",
      "The man nods to them both and retires away to a table, turning his attention once again to the dancing rabbit-man.",
      "\"Apollo, that was extremely rude,\" Icarus chastises him, folding his arms over his chest in disapproval.",
      "Apollo shrugs unapologetically.",
      "\"His behavior was unacceptable.",
      "Whether he realized it or not, he was flirting with another man's lover, and an intervention was called for.\"",
      "Icarus' frown deepens, this time in confusion.",
      "\"You think - oh, this is ridiculous.",
      "He was not flirting with me, Apollo!\"",
      "\"His conversation with you clearly overstepped the bounds of a typical merchant-customer relationship.\"",
      "\"I - I mean, yeah, we were talking about something else, but it wasn't - you know what?",

      "Just, he wasn't, okay?",
      "Trust me on this.\"",

      "He'll keep his eye on this would-be usurper, though.",
      "------------------------------------------- Helios had no strong opinion on this Blake kid, prior to seeing him at the coffee party.",
      "He's just another of Icarus' boring mortal co-workers, though he is pretty easy to wind up, which makes him a little more fun than the unflappable old people at the flower shop, or the kids at the retail agora who are all too burned out to give a shit.",
      "Blake takes the bait every time - at least, he did once he realized that the gods were 'friends' and not 'customers.'",
      "So Helios didn't mind Blake, particularly since Icarus didn't seem to favor Blake's company over the gods.",
      "HOWEVER.",
      "The kid has currently danced his way to Helios' shit list, where he currently holds the top spot.",
      "And yeah, yeah, Helios knows he'll find someone else to be pissed at soon enough, but just look at him!",
      "Blake has been displaying a wholly unexpected set of dance moves, startling from either of Blake's personality sets - the uptight suckup or the mouthy grouch.",
      "The kid in the bunny suit is shimmying and jamming and shaking his ass!",
      "Helios laughed at first, as delighted as everyone else, until he sees that Icarus is also watching attentively.",
      "Icarus is staring at Blake with a rare smile on his face, which expands into a bout of full, genuine laughter when Blake does something interesting on the stage.",
      "He claps at the end of the songs.",
      "He cheers.",
      "Helios scowls.",
      "Now he turns a more critical eye to Blake's dance moves.",
      "Yup, that kid is definitely working Icarus over.",
      "No question.",
      "It's difficult to tell exactly where Blake's looking, hidden as he is beneath the bunny mask and suit, but Helios is certain he's pointed the suit in the direction of the cash registers more than anywhere else, and the mask is facing that way too.",
      "There was a movie Helios watched with Icarus a while back - a female character accused a male of performing pelvic sorcery on her.",
      "Helios had adored the phrase at the time, and used it all the time, especially when talking about Apollo.",
      "But now the pelvic sorcery is being used to undermine him, and Helios does not like it.",
      "\"I Gotta Feelin\" finishes and Blake performs some kind of hands-free cartwheel that nets him applause once again from the customers watching.",
      "See, that's the other thing, there's like twenty people in this ship right now.",
      "There's no way Blake's turning on the moves for twenty random assholes here to buy coffee.",
      "He doesn't even like his job!",
      "So there's no reason he'd be going this hard unless he's trying to impress someone.",
      "And it's apparently working: Icarus cheers and claps and beams.",
      "Blake bows and retreats to the back to take a break.",
      "Helios stalks after him.",
      "Yeah, yeah, he knows - he can't just kill rivals anymore.",
      "Zeus disapproves, and Helios tries to avoid getting on his bad side.",
      "And he can't really retaliate at all, not really, or Icarus would be upset.",
      "Not that Helios even needs to check in on Zeus or Icarus, because Helios is totally mature about these things.",
      "Not like Apoop or Aphrodite or whatever.",
      "He's completely chill about matters of romance.",
      "But \"completely chill\" certainly doesn't mean he has to roll over and let this kid do his pelvic sorcery on Icarus.",
      "So he follows Blake to the back room, and finds the kid sitting there in the open doorway leading to the shipping entrance, smoking a cigarette.",
      "The bunny mask lies discarded on a box of coffee beans a few feet away.",
      "Blake looks over at where Helios is approaching him.",
      "\"Oh - uh, Helios, right?",
      "Hey, man, just so you know, you're not supposed to be - \" \"I don't care about the store rules and neither do you,\" Helios cuts off the kid's obligatory protest.",
      "Blake, who really doesn't care about store rules, shrugs and takes another drag off his cigarette.",
      "\"But listen here, kiddo.",
      "I'm not angry, okay?",
      "I don't do 'angry.'",
      "I'm not pissed and I'm not jealous!",
      "But you better knock off the pelvic sorcery out there.\"",
      "Blake stares at him, eyebrows lifting slightly, cigarette smoke drifting from the stick between his fingers.",
      "\"Uh...",
      "what?\"",
      "\"Out there,\" Helios jerks his head in the direction of the stage, out in the main part of the shop.",
      "\"All your little hip-wiggling?\"",
      "He demonstrates; Blake's eyes bulge.",
      "\"I'm just telling you this for your own good.",
      "Icarus is spoken for.",
      "Aim your ass at someone else.\"",
      "Blake's face does something complicated and he makes an interesting noise.",
      "\"Oh-okay.",
      "No worries, man, I'll, uh.",
      "I'll aim my - oh, jeez.",
      "Icarus is totally safe from me.\"",
      "\"Yeah, you do that.",
      "And don't try to get cute; I'm keeping my eyes on you.\"",
      "He does the thing where he points at his eyes and then points at Blake.",
      "Blake makes that noise again and his shoulders tremble - good.",
      "Helios hopes he put a little fear in the kid.",
      "It's not that he doesn't like him, but Icarus belongs to Helios!",
      "And sometimes Apollo.",
      "But definitely not this pelvic sorcerer.",
      "--------------- The god of love watches Helios strut out of the back room.",
      "He grins to himself; poor Blake!",
      "Luckily someone should be along momentarily to cheer him up.",
      "Assuming that gentleman can tear himself away from Apollo's watchful eyes.",
      "Eros waits patiently, hidden from view behind a fortress of stock boxes.",
      "It smells terrific in here.",
      "This is probably one of the more pleasant environments he's carried out his duties in - he's certainly worked in worse conditions many times before.",
      "Most of the time, really.",
      "This time, he's sitting around reading nudie magazines while sipping stolen tea.",
      "The only way it could be improved is if Psyche or Gany or Hermes was here to watch the show with him - or if he was allowed to bring out his wings.",
      "He's got them hidden at the moment, because it's tough to discreetly blend in with mortals while he's got a fifteen-foot wingspan knocking over all the fragile coffee mugs and stacks of cookies.",
      "Of course, his other features make him stand out a little too, but humans find it easier to overlook these details.",
      "Eros mostly takes after his mom - a deceptively soft, round frame with a soft, round face.",
      "His head is topped with fluffy pink hair and his grin is wide and beaming and inviting.",
      "He did inherit his dad's blood-red eyes, although on Eros, it mostly serves to highlight the cotton-candy hair.",
      "He's seen at least one other human today with similarly-colored hair, and it makes him grin to see it.",
      "Ahh - here comes his agent, now.",
      "Icarus, the sun idiots' paramour, is coming in with two deep dishes of affogato.",
      "Vanilla gelato topped with a shot of hot espresso - affogato means 'drowned', because it's ice cream 'drowned' in coffee.",
      "This makes it hilariously inappropriate for Icarus to be serving, though Eros doesn't think he knows what 'affogato' means.",
      "It also happens to be Blake's favorite dessert, though it's usually too expensive for him to buy or discreetly steal.",
      "\"Yo, Icarus.",
      "Your boyfriends are fuckin' weird,\" Blake tells him without preamble, seeing his co-worker entering.",
      "\"Yeah, sorry.",
      "Their jealousy is over 9000 today,\" Icarus says.",
      "\"One of em told me to quit with the pelvic sorcery I was apparently working on you.",
      "Sorry about that, man.",
      "I see you're still fully dressed though, so I guess I didn't make manage to make you tear your clothes off with all the sexy sex vibes I was throwing your way.\"",
      "Blake sounds amused.",
      "\"Nope.",
      "I resisted somehow,\" Icarus deadpans.",
      "He cuts Blake a look.",
      "\"Though it was a near thing.",
      "You definitely were throwing off the sexy sex vibes today...\" \"Yeah, well, there's a pretty hot guy in the crowd today.",
      "I know you noticed him, right?",
      "He went up to the counter once.\"",
      "\"Yeah.",
      "Yeah, I noticed.\"",
      "Icarus is hiding a smile.",
      "Blake tosses his cigarette into the ashtray with a sigh.",
      "\"What are you doing back here anyway?",
      "Aren't you supposed to be serving the customers?\"",
      "\"Technically, I am,\" Icarus sets the dishes of affogato down on a nearby box, which serves as a table now.",
      "Blake eyes them.",
      "\"Uh - that's - did someone forget those and leave em behind?\" \"Nope.",
      "Wait just a minute before you start eating them, okay?\" Blake's still asking questions but Icarus grins and exits back to the main shop.",
      "Blake stares suspiciously as the door shuts behind him.",
      "Eros grins wider and resists rubbing his hands together, but it's so satisfying when a plan comes together!",
      "Sure enough, a tall, handsome figure approaches from outside.",
      "He steps up to Blake and taps his shoulder.",
      "\"Excuse me.",
      "I was told that my order would be back here?\"",
      "\"You - uhhh?\" Blake, who normally has a sharp or witty response for anyone, is reduced to a stammering mess of blushes on the spot as Tomas, the handsome man from the cafe, stands before him, smiling slightly.",
      "The bunny suit only adds to the poignancy, in Eros' opinion.",
      "Eros squees a little, making his little victory symbol with his hands - a heart, with his thumbs and forefingers.",
      "He'd love to stay and spy on them, drinking in the success and watching the hilarity and romance, but he senses he's needed outside, immediately.",
      "He teleports to the side of the building, where, as predicted, Apollo and Helios are both marching back with grimly threatening looks on their brows.",
      "Eros appears immediately in front of them.",
      "\"Hey guys!",
      "Well hello there!",
      "And what brings you to this corner of the shop when your bae is running the coffee machines on the other side?\" \"You.",
      "I might have guessed,\" Apollo snarls.",
      "\"You're behind every romantic mishap that has ever befallen anyone.\"",
      "\"Ohh, c'mon, some people mishap themselves just fine,\" Eros declares.",
      "\"You lead dicks astray!\"",
      "Helios hisses.",
      "\"Not just dicks,\" Eros replies loftily.",
      "Helios should know better than that.",
      "Eros shot his sisters pretty good before.",
      "\"You're responsible for Icarus' interest in that young man,\" Apollo accuses.",
      "\"And for that guy doing the pelvic sorcery at him!\"",
      "\"Yes, and - what?",
      "Helios, what ridiculous term is that?\"",
      "\"It's what that guy was doing with his dancing!\"",
      "\"Helios, don't be an idiot.",
      "Blake was hired to dance.",
      "The problem suitor was the customer who came back here just now.\"",
      "\"What customer?",
      "Blake was the one dancing, and Icarus brought that dessert back for him...\" Eros watches this exchange with an increasingly smug smirk on his face.",
      "\"I see you two are exactly as ridiculous as you were a few thousand years ago, and exactly as clueless in matters of Luv.",
      "Same ol' Helios and Apollo.\"",
      "The sun idiots turn to look at him, golden eyes narrowing and glowing in unison.",
      "\"Explain yourself,\" Apollo demands.",
      "Eros drapes his arms over both of their shoulder, and brings out his wings for the heck of it, since they're all outside and alone now.",
      "\"Icarus had nothing to do with anything, my dear fellows, except to perform a few of the tasks for me on my little project.\"",
      "\"But - the impudent customer,\" Apollo protests, not ready to let go of his righteous anger yet.",
      "So predictable!",
      "\"And the pelvic sor-\" \"Stop using that phrase,\" Apollo snarls.",
      "\"You two are like balm for my soul,\" Eros tells them, steering them around to face the still-open back door to the coffee shop.",
      "Very visible within the doorframe is Blake, still wearing half the bunny suit; and Tomas, the handsome customer that Blake had a crush on.",
      "They're talking and eating their dessert.",
      "Blake's face is aflame and he keeps, grinning and laughing and stammering.",
      "Tomas is smiling and watching him intently and gestures while he tells a story in his soft, mild voice.",
      "\"Yes, it was one of my subtler efforts,\" Eros says.",
      "\"Took a long time to set up, and it stood a pretty good chance of not working out.",
      "Lots of factors, you know.",
      "I had to get Tomas there to notice the event and decide to attend.",
      "Had to make sure Blake drew the short straw so he could dance today.",
      "Had to get Icarus to learn Blake's 'type,' and his favorite coffee drink, had to make sure they were all in the right place at the right time...tricky stuff.",
      "Not like the old days, where I'd just shoot someone in the ass with my arrow, and let their dicks lead the way.",
      "And if I'd gotten that close to success, only for you two jealous clowns to wander through and wreck everything...\" Eros' red eyes briefly intensify, flickering threateningly.",
      "He's been told that it makes him look scarier than either Ares or Aphrodite; even scarier than both of them combined when he does this; mainly because everyone who sees it suddenly remembers Eros' capacity for vengeful chaos when provoked.",
      "Or even when he's just bored.",
      "But then his grin is back, and his hands tighten around their shoulders in a totally-not-threatening way (except for the part where there is definitely a subtle warning in the hug).",
      "\"Well, it doesn't matter, does it?",
      "Look at those two!",
      "There they are, flirting shamelessly.",
      "Hopelessly infatuated.",
      "And, 'scuse the shop talk, but they're totally horny for each other right now too.",
      "I have a little bet with myself - they're gonna start sucking face about an hour after Blake gets off shift.",
      "Probably do more sucking later, but Blake's actually shyer than you'd guess, so maybe - \" \"All right, that's enough.",
      "We get it,\" Apollo says sullenly.",
      "\"Well, actually, that's a good segue.",
      "You don't get it,\" Eros tells them.",
      "\"I like Icarus, so I'm gonna give you two a little free advice.\"",
      "Hard pass.",
      "Your advice always sucks. 0/10,\" Helios sneers.",
      "Shut up and listen,\" Eros says, seriously for a change.",
      "And yeah, he's a generation down from Apollo and three down from Helios the titan, but they both have learned a lot about his power over the centuries, because they both scowl furiously...",
      "but they're listening.",
      "\"You're on thin ice with him already.",
      "He doesn't remember everything but he knows enough.",
      "He's up to his ears in phobias, and he's bitter as fuck and he's trying to protect his heart.",
      "When you carry on like this, like he's your possession and you're just fighting over who gets to own him, it's not going to do you any favors.",
      "He died for your love, and didn't get it.",
      "Being catty over his customers and co-workers isn't going to impress him.\"",
      "Eros' squad had really been rooting for Icarus, back then.",
      "They'd all been heartbroken when Icarus had drowned.",
      "Anteros, Himeros, Pothos...",
      "but none more than Eros and Gany.",
      "Eros had been forced to watch the winged boy sink beneath the waves as water filled his lungs - sad enough on its own, but also a pretty symbolic death.",
      "Love gods had wings, after all.",
      "Gany had also taken the blow pretty hard.",
      "He had still been quite new to Olympus at the time, and had wanted to see another mortal win the love of the gods.",
      "He'd been composing a song about it, to celebrate when Icarus finally made it.",
      "He'd been so utterly crushed at the heartbroken boy, dead in the ocean and left to toss about and be eaten by sharks.",
      "Hebe had discreetly gone to visit her illicit beau, Hercules, and directed him to where he could find the body, so that Icarus could at least be honored with dignity at a funeral.",
      "This time, it's entirely different.",
      "The whole situation is reversed.",
      "The sun idiots are constantly competing for Icarus' attention, and Icarus himself has hardened his heart in self-protection.",
      "The kid doesn't even like to let himself smile around them, in case it gives him away, and he's genuinely distressed about it afterwards whenever he can't stop himself from smiling, from blushing, from feeling.",
      "An arrow would be a fast and easy way to force a solution...",
      "but Eros respects the Icarus who was willing to die for love.",
      "These two sun assholes are going to earn it this time.",
      "Eros hugs Apollo and Helios again, tightly, and beams innocently at them, nodding towards the besotted Blake and Tomas.",
      "Foul-mouthed, cynical Blake, grinning like a dumbass and drinking in every story that Tomas can think of to impress him.",
      "Eros can't wait to watch it pan out.",
      "\"Just look at those two for a success story.",
      "Just spending time together and liking each other.",
      "Sometimes it's just that easy.\"",
      "He lets them go.",
      "\"Anyway, I'll catch you later.",
      "I gotta go check in with Himeros and Anteros are staying on top of this, and then it's back to Psyche for me.",
      "Haven't seen that foxy lady in almost a week!\"",
      "Eros takes off before they can protest or start making excuses.",
      "Better to let them chew over the final word in the matter, and hope it sinks in.",
      "Besides, he really hasn't seen Psyche in almost a week, so he wants to stop by to pick up a bouquet (curated by Persephone herself, of course) before he goes back.",
      "------------ Helios and Apollo are sullen for nearly ten minutes afterwards, glaring at where Blake and Tomas are unquestionably loving each other's company.",
      "They split up their conversation only when Blake realizes that he has to go back out and dance again.",
      "Tomas says something charming and dirty about Blake's ass, and they both laugh and part ways.",
      "\"Guess we misread that one,\" Helios sulks.",
      "\"And got a lecture, for our error,\" Apollo agrees, sounding irritated as well.",
      "Helios sighs.",
      "\"I really thought it would be easier if the kid couldn't remember the details.\"",
      "\"Yes, I did too.",
      "But evidently he remembers enough.\"",
      "\"I don't know how we can convince him we're not playing around this time,\" Helios admits quietly.",
      "There's silence for a moment, while they both reflect on this.",
      "\"Well,\" Apollo ventures finally, \"I suppose we'll just have to win him over by attrition of sorts.",
      "Just... keep wearing away at him with charm and interest and good intentions.\"",
      "Helios taps his chin.",
      "\"Hmm.",
      "Yeah. 'Persuasion is better than force...'\" \"Right, like your disagreement with Boreas.\"",
      "\"Fine.",
      "Well, we'll see if it's really 'just that easy,' like the Romantic Shithead seems to think.\"",
      "----- They return back to the cafe, resolving to pay no mind to any customers and dancing rabbit co-workers.",
      "They'll instead focus only on showering Icarus with affection and praise.",
      "Icarus has no idea what happened, of course, but he can't decide if this is fun and charming, or if it's really, really annoying."

    "text": "Icarus is taking four classes this term; the standard for a full-time student. He also signed up for a handful of extracurricular activities, not many, but enough to keep him involved. He's discreetly in the student LGBTQ+ club, though he doesn't often speak up. And of course, astronomy club, which is the thing he lives for every week. He also has five separate jobs, that require his efforts at various times of the day/week. Between the five of them, Icarus manages to make enough money to keep his monthly bills in check, as well as taking a chunk off of the cost of tuition. He's not rich, for sure, but frankly, it's enough for him to keep his head above water (a phrase that's always made him shudder, for some reason), and not burden his family with debt. So many jobs, classes and extracurriculars requires Icarus to keep a detailed schedule on his refrigerator so he can keep track of where he's supposed to be and when. Tragically, this becomes his undoing, as certain other individuals also consult this schedule at their leisure to determine how and where to find him and maximize their pestering. ------------------- The coffee shop is one of his big earners. It's the reason he stays on working at The Big Bean, even though the job is more stressful than he would have thought. Icarus works there in the afternoon on Monday, after his European history class; and mornings on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays. It's a Thursday morning when the sun gods arrive. Icarus looks up from where he's restocking filters and groans aloud. Naturally, he's the only one working the front at the moment. Helios saunters over to the counter, grinning broadly at him. \"Oi, can we get some service, here?\" he shouts, unnecessarily loud. Slumping in resignation, Icarus shuffles over to them. \"Good morning, and welcome to the Big Bean. How can I serve you today?\" Both the gods snort at that, Helios nudging Apollo before leering at Icarus. \"Well, I can come up with a few ideas, Mop-Head... let's start by bringing that pretty face of yours over here for a kiss, hmm?\" Icarus groans again. \"Can you just be serious for once-\" Helios ignores him. \"Then, you can take off those silly-looking clothes...\" \"I think he looks rather dapper in that apron,\" Apollo interjects, a slight quirk to his lips indicating his amusement but giving no clue if he's serious about the apron. \"True. And the little cap is cute,\" Helios concedes. \"All right, so, naked except for the apron and cap-\" Face flushing crimson, Icarus hisses at them: \"You guys, I'm working right now! You have to cut it out or I'll get fired!\" Neither of them look impressed. \"So what? You have four other jobs,\" Helios points out. \"I need the money,\" Icarus pleads. \"Can't you please just - order something?\" Apollo sighs. \"Very well. It's breakfast-time for you, correct?\" \"It's... yeah, I mean, it's morning, so...\" \"Then I'll have barley bread and wine, with olives and figs.\" Icarus sighs. \"We serve coffee, tea, and those pastries there,\" he points at the display window, featuring sugary breakfast pastries. Apollo sighs again, more heavily this time. \"I'm beginning to see the source of your nutritional deficiencies. These will be addressed.\" \"We have Greek Mountain Tea. Maybe you'd like that?\" Icarus suggests desperately. The god waves his hand. \"Very well. With a teaspoon of honey added.\" While Icarus hurries to make the tea, Helios peruses the baked goods. \"What's this one?\" he asks, pointing to an item. Icarus looks over. \"Uh... caramel and cinnamon roll.\" Helios nods. \"I'll have 1200.\" Icarus gapes incredulously. \"H-hahh?!\" \"You and your sweet tooth,\" Apollo says to Helios. \"Yeah, what can I say? It's always been my favorite.\" \"You want 1200? One-two-zero-zero?\" Icarus presses. \"Standard sacrificial amount,\" Helios says. \"We don't... have that many? Like, in the entire store? And it's not a sacrifice, for- you're paying for this, right? Please tell me you have money!\" They both give him blank stares. Icarus starts to hyperventilate as he debates how he's going to deflect them, then they both snicker. \"Relax, Mop-Head. We know how to buy things.\" Helios slaps a wadded-up ball of bills on the counter. \"Now gimme my roll!\" Icarus shakily sets the tea in its paper cup down for Apollo and retrieves the cinnamon roll. These guys are not improving his anxiety. When he sets the roll on its napkin on the counter, Helios darts his hand out, grabs Icarus's wrist and pulls him forward to plant a kiss on his cheek. \"You're such a dork, Mop-Head,\" he says with a wink and a grin, reaching up to flick at Icarus's cap, knocking it at an angle over his eyes. Both gods take their goods and begin to walk out of the store. \"Catch ya later, kiddo!\" Helios calls behind him. \"We'll be sure to discuss your state of undress again later, when you're off-shift,\" Apollo adds, shutting the door behind them. The wadded-up bills cover the amount needed - which is interesting, since he hadn't told them the price, and they didn't ask. Icarus is putting the change in the tip jar, when he realizes the jar is nearly overflowing with glittering Greek coins. The old ones, drachmas and obols with ancient Greek gods printed on them. Icarus wonders if Helios and Apollo are on any of them. The coins are totally useless to him, but they make him smile, and he packs them carefully in his bag to take home and examine later. Icarus really shouldn't be spending his precious time working at the flower shop. The pay is very minimal and it doesn't do much for him in a scholarly or professional sense. There's just not a lot of benefit to doing it. But he stays there, working every Sunday and at odd free moments during the week, to help the elderly couple running the shop, mainly because it's peaceful and interesting. The smell is wonderful: floral scents and warm air hit Icarus in the face every time he walks in the shop. In the greenhouse attached to the back of the building, the smell is even stronger, and damp potting soil as well, which he finds soothing. Most of his work involves bringing stock up to the front for the elderly owners, repotting some of the live plants, and hauling around the heavy pots and bags of soil. The old lady often brings in food and cookies for Icarus, which he isn't too proud to take home with him. If she ever finds out how much he loves strawberry shortcake, he's going to end up gaining twenty pounds, he's sure. The old man tells him sometimes about the exotic places he's gone, and the seeds he's brought back. He even created a hybrid flower. Very interesting, and very peaceful.... Most of the time. Sometimes, like today, it skews much further towards interesting than peaceful. Icarus walks through the greenhouse carrying an enormous armload of cut flowers, with the intent of taking them to the workbench to wrap them into bouquets, when he sees Apollo standing there, gently touching the delicate petals of a hyacinth in a brightly painted pot. Icarus slows to a stop and falters, uncertain what to say. In ordinary circumstances, he would have asked Apollo what the hell he's doing here; or asked if the god didn't have some \"sun duties\" to attend to instead of bothering Icarus; or some other sarcastic thing. But these flippant remarks are inappropriate in the face of Apollo's continued grief over losing Hyacinthus, carried over the millennia. Apollo has said before that a few thousand years is as nothing to a god; to him, the young man's death is recent and the sorrow only just barely losing the fresh sharp edge. He remembers very clearly sitting on the hillsides of Greece with Hyacinthus, wrestling and singing with him, kissing him. Revelations like these make Icarus feel small, insignificant and sad, inviting his depression to take over. \"Umm,\" he begins, with no clear idea what he might say next. As it happens, Apollo spares him from making a fool of himself. The god kisses his own fingertips and brushes them against the hyacinth, before turning to Icarus. His face, as usual, is perfectly composed - but at the sight of Icarus, his expression lightens noticeably and a small smile graces his lips. \"Icarus. What a pleasant sight.\" Apollo takes one step towards him and pauses, taking Icarus in. The god tilts his head slightly, looking Icarus up and down, bringing a faint color to his cheeks. \"Uh... what are you..?\" Icarus asks, suddenly feeling shy. \"You look - exceptionally handsome like that. With your arms filled with springtime flowers of all colors.\" Apollo holds up his hand, using his thumb and forefinger in an L-shape to... measure Icarus? Maybe? Icarus isn't an artist, he has no idea, but the attention makes his blush intensify. Apollo is still talking, as though to himself. \"Yes... perhaps seated - no, kneeling? No. Standing. Wearing a short tunic - perhaps the low-girdled chiton. Hmm. Yes.\" The god walks slowly around Icarus, taking in a different angle. \"Some flowers in your hair as well... Icarus, I'd like to paint you like this. You make a lovely composition.\" Icarus resists the urge to bury his face in the flowers. \"But I'm on shift right now,\" is all he can manage. Apollo considers himself to be sex on legs - an attractiveness and appeal that speaks for itself. Icarus has found himself far less impressed by his open attempts at seduction, and much more interested in the Apollo that's revealed in moments like these, when he shows his real personality: fussy and creative. Apollo nods. \"Of course. After your shift, then. It will give me time to collect my oils, my brushes... any other interesting props I can find.\" Okay, and to be fair, Apollo talking about oils and brushes in his Apollo-voice is suggesting something more than painting, in Icarus's mind. He does bury his face in the flowers then, and the next time Apollo speaks, he can hear the smirk. \"I look forward to capturing your body. On canvas.\" Icarus groans into the flowers, and jumps a little as he feels Apollo's fingers on his jaw, lifting his chin. His face is totally red now, probably, and Apollo's wearing that look he gets when he knows he just sent a swirl of chaos into Icarus's brain. \"A very pretty picture. Ah, but hold still... you have a smudge of dirt, from the flowers...\" Apollo runs his thumb over a possibly-invisible spot of dirt on Icarus's cheek, smiling at him. \"Ohh!\" A delighted-sounding cry from a few yards away makes them both turn. The old lady is beaming at them from where she's passing through with paper and ribbons for the bouquets. \"Icarus! Is this your boyfriend?\" Apollo easily rests his hand on Icarus's shoulder, near the curve where it meets his neck. Icarus can feel the heat from his hand through his shirt and flinches when he feels Apollo's thumb lightly caress the side of his neck. It's not fair that he's doing this when Icarus's hands are full! \"Indeed. My name is Apollo. It's a pleasure to meet you, madam.\" Apollo's voice is smooth and polite and the woman is charmed at once. \"Oh, how wonderful-Leroy! Leroy, come here, and meet Icarus's young man!\" The old man shuffles out from the office. \"You don't say! And aren't you a handsome devil. Icarus, you sly dog, why didn't you say you had a boyfriend?\" \"Uh-uhm, y-yeah, it's... mostly true...\" Icarus mumbles. The old lady is beside herself with delight. \"You should stop by more often, dear! We'd love to have you, I'm sure I can bring in more snacks to share.\" \"I'd enjoy that,\" Apollo says, shifting his hand down to Icarus's arm, giving him a sideways hug while leaning down to give him a light kiss on the temple. Icarus fights the urge to pray for lightning to strike him on the spot - such prayers, given ironically with a millennial flair for morbid drama, have taken a new significance these days. \"Dog walking?\" people ask, incredulously, and yes, Icarus wouldn't have guessed it either. But he charges $15 dollar per walk, takes anywhere from 5-7 dogs out a couple times a day, most days of the week, and it reliably nets him $400 or more every week. Plus, far and away, it's his most fun job. Originally, he'd only replied to a few ads asking for dog walkers, because he loves dogs and he figured he could use it to make sure he get exercise daily. Now, it's probably the best part of his day. The dogs are great, always happy to see him; he gets out in the fresh air for at least an hour a day, and he doesn't even have to feel guilty about enjoying himself: he's getting paid to do it! It's a Monday, just after lunch, and Icarus is taking Simon & Rosie (two fat Dalmatians), Oatmeal (some kind of pit bull mix), and Cutie Pie (a corgi) through the park on the south end of the university. The dogs are all excited to be outside, and stop to sniff interesting things and/or bark at them, when abruptly all four go still and tense. Something huge crashes through the trees - at least two, maybe three stories high, black as night. The dogs panic in a flurry of barking and running, tangling a bewildered and frightened Icarus in the leashes. When the commotion stops, Simon and Rosie are cowering behind Icarus; Oatmeal is cowering next to Icarus, sort of half-growling, half-whimpering; and Cute Pie is in front, snarling ferociously at... an enormous, three-headed dog, who is looking down at them with a combination of imperiousness and curiosity, except for the third head, which has pricked its ears at a nearby squirrel. A leash extends down from the neck(s) of this beastly dog, and at the end of the leash... Helios. Of course. \"I-I might have guessed it would be you,\" Icarus says, only stammering a little as his heart hammers inside his chest. \"Heya, Mop-Head!\" Helios greets him, waving cheerfully. \"I saw you're a really big fan of dogs, so I stole Cerberus for you, from Hades!\" He preens. \"Pretty great boyfriend, right?\" Icarus stares, wide-eyed. \"That's... Cerberus? The Guardian of the Underworld?\" \"Yup!\" \"Then... who's guarding Hades?\" There's a slight pause, hardly noticeable but telling nonetheless, before Helios grins and waves his hand dismissively. \"Pfft. Not important. It's not like that many people are trying to break in or out anymore these days, y'know?\" Icarus knows he should object, knows he should say something disapproving... but, the truth is, he is impressed. \"That's really him? Like, really Cerberus?\" He tries to take a step closer and stumbles; the dogs have entangled him badly in the leashes. Helios notices and his grin widens, a little wickedly. \"Oh-ho, I see you're all tied up at the moment, eh? Hmm. What to do about that.\" Icarus tries a little harder to untangle himself. \"Behave yourself, Helios!\" \"Now why should I do that?\" Helios has sauntered over to where Icarus is standing, trapped in place, and runs his fingers over Icarus's neck. Icarus jerks his hands up to swat Helios away, but can't, as he's still holding on to the ends of the leashes and they're wrapped around his legs. \"H-Helios, cut it out!\" he protests, scrunching up his shoulders protectively and fighting off a blush or laughter. \"No way! You're really cute like this,\" Helios looks far too pleased as he does it again, tracing lightly over Icarus's collar bone this time, prompting an embarrassing squeaky noise from Icarus. \"Helios- shit-!\" Icarus stumbles again and this time falls over. Helios catches him in a totally unnecessarily dramatic pose. \"Romantic! I like it!\" Helios's eyes are crinkled in amusement and he leans over, making kissy noises into Icarus's neck. Icarus does start laughing then and drops the leashes from his hand to push Helios's head away. \"You jerk! You're so annoying!\" he tries to scold. \"Aw, c'mon, Icarus! I surprise you at work with a great dog for your collection, catch you when you fall, and you can't even reward your awesome boyfriend with a little smooch?\" \"I only fell because of you in the first place -and you stole that dog, isn't Hades gonna be mad-?\" Icarus squawks as Helios squeezes his hips teasingly. \"Smooch smooch smooooch! C'mon, you can give me one little kiss!\" Icarus snickers again and falls back in defeat. \"One little kiss. One!\" \"Unless you beg for more,\" comes the rejoinder with a grin. Helios leans forward and presses a kiss to Icarus's cheek. The gods are surprisingly chaste at times, choosing so far to only to kiss him on the cheeks, the forehead, the neck... his hands... Icarus would be lying if he said that they didn't manage to make a kiss on the cheek feel pretty intimate anyway. After his kiss, Helios rests his forehead on Icarus's, and smiles. \"You look so damn cute when you're blushing, Mop-Head.\" Icarus blushes harder. \"I'm not-\" \"You totally are blushing! It's soooooo cute! It makes me want to kiss you more!\" After a moment of laughter and a few sneaky tickles from Helios and some more-or-less-earnest fighting from Icarus, he suddenly looks up. His four dogs are still there, sitting a few feet away and watching them with doggy looks of embarrassment on their faces. But... \"Uh... where did Cerberus go?\" \"!!! Ahhhhh shit!\" The library doesn't actually pay, per se, but if he volunteers a given number of hours, it does give him vouchers for select items purchased at the campus shops - class supplies, food and other sundries. Icarus did the math and determined that the value of the vouchers was nearly as good as actual money, with the added benefit of the convenient location where he could stop by between classes easily and rack up hours for the week. And it's fairly peaceful work. Running the checkout desk; entering returned books into the computer; shelving books; light cleaning. And Icarus is free to do some of his own homework as well, as long as he gets the list of tasks done, while still earning credit for being there. Hard to complain about it. He enjoys the tasks, and enjoys the hush of the narrow aisles, packed with books on either side, higher than his head. They have a good section on aviation: old and new books; practical and philosophical; aeronautical and astronautical. Icarus likes to sneak back to steal a few browse through them whenever he can. Icarus is on his way back to the front counter with two books in hand, when he hears a yelp of surprise, two feet to his left, where there are a couple small steps leading up to the study carrels and tables. He whips his head around and has enough time to register a mass of bright red hair, on a figure that is falling, armloads of books already dropping around them. Icarus drops his own books and just barely manages to catch the figure before they bite the floor hard. The figure is a woman, as it turns out - Icarus's hands are wrapped around her torso, narrowly missing an accidental feelski. The woman is gorgeous, the mounds of red hair tousled from her stumble, and bright green eyes wide with alarm. Icarus helps her upright again. She stands a little taller than him and has guns to rival Linda Hamilton, he notices. The green eyes turn to him and narrow just slightly. \"Jeez - are you all right? Did you turn your ankle? I'm sorry about that, those steps are the most pointless safety hazard in this building, I seriously see people trip over them hourly. Are you hurt, though? Do you need to sit down? Or I can get somebody. Or a glass of water, or something?\" Icarus is aware that he's babbling a little, but now that the woman is standing tall with the stance of someone who does not suffer bullshit lightly, and considering him with those fierce green eyes - it's a little intimidating, okay?! But thankfully, the frantic babbling must have worked, because the green eyes soften and a faint smile touches her lips. \"I'm all right. Thank you for asking.\" She seems bemused by the concern, and amused as well. He grins, relieved, and awkwardly sticks out his hand. \"Glad to hear it! I'm Icarus,\" he says, inwardly cursing himself for being such a huge fucking dork, but now that the danger is over he's not sure how he's supposed to proceed. The woman meets his awkwardness with a queenly grace, shaking his hand. \"My name is Athena. I'm grateful for your assistance. I don't often need it,\" she adds, as an afterthought. \"I can tell. Uh. You seem like a very capable lady.\" Icarus is not very eloquent today, apparently, and decides to stoop and help her gather her books instead. There are tons; seriously, why would she carry this many all at once? It would surely be easier to bring them a few at a time? She chuckles to herself. \"You risked your life, just to spare me from indignity. I don't often see that these days.\" Risked his life? A little excessive... well, maybe. There were a lot of huge, heavy books to get smushed under. Icarus is even more impressed by the lady's strength, that she could carry so many of them - All at once it hits him. Athena, she'd said her name was. Was she... *that* Athena? She had to be! That's why she had so many books! Nervous again, Icarus glanced over at the possible goddess. Athena is crouched next to him now. She fixes her hair, in a brief, utilitarian gesture, revealing a side-shave, before she also begins gathering her books again. The books are nearly all printed in the letters of ancient Greek, even though he's sure this library doesn't carry that language - yeah, it's *that* Athena, all right. She smiles at him, which helps him relax slightly. \"You said you see people come up against these stairs hourly - you must spend a lot of time here?\" Her books are stacking effortlessly in her hands, tall and heavy. \"I'm a little biased, but I think people who spend more of their time in libraries are cooler to be around.\" Icarus blushes a little and grins, pleased. \"Well, I can't take that compliment completely - I work here too, but yeah, I love spending my free time here when I can. They've got a great aviation collection.\" Athena pauses, her hand near one of his fallen books - both of which, of course, are about rockets and aviation and astronautical engineering. \"You can only be Icarus,\" she says softly, before looking at him with recognition in her eyes. \"Am I right? The mortal the two sun idiots keep bickering over?\" \"I... they bicker over me... like, there, too? In - in Olympia?\" It's strange to say that sentence aloud. All parts of it. Apollo and Helios: acknowledging that they're in some competition to gain his affections, which is crazy. It's also crazy to acknowledge that they're immortals from another realm of existence. \"All the time,\" she assures him, eyes twinkling. \"It's a pleasure to meet you at last, Icarus.\" They carry the books over to the table where she's set up camp. Another strange thing: a tiny, seriously adorable little tabby kitten, black stripes on brown fur, is batting pencils off the table. It goes without saying that the cat shouldn't be in here. Literally, it goes without saying - Icarus isn't going to mention it. \"So, uh... who's this little guy?\" is all he says, unable to keep from reaching out to pet the kitten. It pounces on his hand. \"She,\" Athena corrects. \"This is Nike.\" She says this matter-of-factly, and Icarus can't remember if Nike was supposed to be a god or if she really named her cat after a shoe or something. \"Can I ask what you're researching here? You've got a lot of books,\" Icarus says politely, as Nike shreds the cuff of his shirt. \"Oh, a little bit of everything,\" Athena says brightly. \"I couldn't decide which project I wanted to work on today, so I brought all the books over - though, I was leaning towards toreutics.\" \"Toreutics? That's... the study of artistic metal?\" Icarus has been stocking shelves in the library for a while now; he can't believe he remembers that title from a book. Athena claps her hands together and beams at him. \"Right! It's not my usual area of focus - I generally dealt with womens' crafts, and toreutics would have been Hephaestus' area - but of course, nowadays, women are much more able to create anything they please. As they should have been from the beginning.\" She sniffs; clearly this has been a sore point for her for centuries. Icarus smiles. \"For sure. I took a shop class a few years ago... one of the girls there was better than anyone else.\" \"You don't look like much of a metalsmith sort of guy.\" He shrugs sheepishly. \"Nah. I mean, I was curious, so I tried it out. Never know when I'll find something new that I'll enjoy learning... but yeah, I'm kind of a one-obsession sort of guy. I guess - I guess you already what that is,\" he says, gesturing to the aviation books on the table. \"Though I also follow cynology pretty closely,\" he says with a grin. \"The study of dogs,\" she laughs. \"Yes, I heard about Cerberus. Oh, but you know -\" she begins digging in her bag, laid on the table and also filled with books. \"Here's one you might find interesting.\" She removes and sets aside random books - more than should fit in her bag - about the most random assortment of topics, all with slips of paper printed with notes in Greek letters. After a moment she says \"Aha!\" triumphantly and presents Icarus with a slim hardcover book. As he takes it, the Greek letters transform into English: \"Heliology with Special Focus on Helioseismology,\" he reads. He looks up at her. \"I guess - the study of the sun?\" He can't quite keep a blush off his face. Athena looks amused. \"Yes. And helioseismology is the study of the interior of the sun, as ascertained by studying its surface.\" She says that with a faint tease to her voice, and Icarus clears his throat. \"'Heliology' I guess they got the name from Helios?\" \"Right. The original sun god.\" \"Original doesn't mean best,\" comes a familiar voice unexpectedly from directly behind Icarus. Icarus jumps approximately ten feet into the air with a startled gasp, and whips around to see Apollo coolly glaring at Athena. \"Oh, hello, Apollo. I didn't see you there.\" Athena smiles at him. \"And of course, original doesn't mean best. Just that he was first. And he's been doing it the longest.\" \"Ahh, you mean the way that Hephaestus, God of Crafts, was born earlier than you? Legend says he was the one who helped you spring from Our Father's divine skull,\" Apollo suggests sweetly. \"He was first? But wasn't Hera the third wife...?\" Icarus asks tentatively, mostly to himself, trying to remember. Of course, from what he remembers of Zeus, the matter of who he was married to when he had his children was irrelevant. Case in point: Apollo himself, child of an illicit affair, and one who is currently leveling a glare at Icarus. Icarus swiftly holds up his hands placatingly, trying to think of how to backpedal. Athena looks smug. \"Yes. I am the firstborn of Our Father, Lord Zeus, and the original Goddess of Crafts, as well as the original Goddess of Knowledge, for that matter.\" Apollo, the second-generation god of the sun and knowledge, glowers. Nike the cat is wiggling its butt while staring up at Apollo; clearly ready to try to jump for his temptingly swaying locks of hair. Icarus has a feeling that wouldn't end well for the cat. He intervenes, shooing Nike away and taking Apollo's hand in his own. \"I know I'm biased, and I don't know what makes a better God or Goddess of Knowledge, but I do know which one is my favorite - even though I'm really glad to have met you, Athena!\" Icarus smiles up at Apollo, and is shocked to see that the sun god is blushing. Blushing!! Discreetly, of course, and looking no less stoic than usual, but yes, his face is definitely heating up. Athena has made a little squealing gasp and is grinning at them, eyes darting back and forth between them. \"Is Lord Apollo... blushing?! Like a besotted schoolboy! Oh, wait until I tell Artemis!\" She laughs, and any tension from before is broken. \"All right, that's cute. I'll forgive the disrespect from both of you.\" \"Erhm. Yes. Thank you for your loyalty, Icarus.\" Apollo coughs embarrassedly but doesn't drop Icarus' hand. \"But really, Icarus, we'll have to address your etiquette in dealing with gods. Choosing someone else over Athena is exactly how Troy happened.\" Athena waves her hand. \"We've all come a long way since then, Apollo; it's all water under the shattered bridge of your humiliating defeat. Anyway, Icarus is your lover, I'd hardly expect him to choose otherwise. The really interesting thing would be to see who he picks out of the sun gods courting him.\" They both turn to look at him, and Icarus has just enough time to feel his heart stop, when the bell dings at the front counter, indicating that someone wants to check out the book, and he flees in a red-faced panic while the gods' laughter follows him. And yup, there's also the retail job. Another soul-sucking position as stocker, cashier and general drudge; but it's a consistent paycheck that he can't turn down. It's at a regional supercenter store, with groceries as well as departments for housing goods. The place thrives off of desperate college kids to keep its business running; the management cheerfully denies promotions or pay increases on the premise that the students' schedules will only change next semester, so there's no use in investing in them for more than menial labor. Icarus keeps applying for a position as a third-shift stocker, where customer service is minimal and you get overnight pay, but it's a competitive position. Lots of applicants. But he gets lucky one weekend, and he's called to help cover a shift because one of their regular guys is \"in court again,\" which Icarus chooses to interpret as meaning jury duty. But, great news! He looks forward to three shifts of mindlessly stocking shelves and racks, for slightly better than his usual pay, and with no (or at least, very few) customers to bother him. \"It's not that great,\" explains Amelia, the shift lead, when he comes in almost skipping in delight to be there. Amelia is a gruff lumberjack sort of lady (lumberjane?), with a tattoo of Ruby on one arm and Sapphire on the other (Icarus wonders if Garnet is tattooed somewhere in the middle but it seems impolite to ask). \"It's really hard to coordinate time to hang out with your friends and family on this shift. Or get stuff done out in town. Your sleep schedule is all messed up, and you have to take Vitamin D pills, which naturally isn't covered on insurance,\" she goes on, as they drag out two pallets of dry groceries to restock. \"I'll trade you jobs,\" Icarus offers. \"We can talk to Mark on Monday and do an even swap, day shift for night shift.\" \"Pfft! Nope, not that desperate,\" she grins at him. Night shift is everything Icarus hoped for. They companionably stock shelves and chat occasionally. Shenanigans abound on night shift, as the workers have learned by now that the video monitoring is solely concerned with theft during these hours, rather than professional behavior, as there aren't many customers to impress. The workers joke and chat and it's like heaven. Icarus would buy industrial-sized containers of Vitamin D if that's the price of this kind of peace. Of course, the peace doesn't last too long. A guy comes in around 1am... someone that looks... familiar to Icarus. He's got blue hair, a cap with wings printed on the sides, and possibly the most hideous clothes Icarus has ever seen in his life, which is what tugs on his memory. He has definitely seen this guy wearing a similarly outlandish outfit somewhere before. On campus, maybe? He can't remember. The guy wanders around a little bit, occasionally putting clothes and accessories into his basket that match his aesthetic of \"random, ugly and colorful.\" Icarus tries to ignore the red flags going up in his brain and carries on stocking. He's in the household goods section, stacking a few novelty coffee mugs, when the inevitable happens and the guy approaches him. \"Icarus, right?\" comes the voice, inquisitive and bright. Icarus flinches and turns. Blue-haired guy is watching him from a few feet away, peering through the ugliest sunglasses Icarus has ever seen. There's a small smile on the guy's face, and that's what finally clues him in, where he's seen him before. He'd been talking to Helios, once, near the alley where he'd first run into the sun god. He'd been smiling then, too - actually, Icarus gets the distinct impression that this guy is probably always quietly laughing to himself, at a joke that only he gets. \"Uh - yeah, that's me. Icarus. Do you... know me?\" he asks, a little uneasily. He's not sure what to expect, here. Sure, his gods (is it all right to call them that?) seem to be generally positive towards him, but if more gods start showing up.... \"Sure do! Apollo and Helios talk a lot about you. The rest of us are starting to get curious.\" The guy's smile deepens a little and Icarus is sure there's some secret joke there. \"I'm Hermes. Everyone's favorite.\" He winks at Icarus, who returns the smile nervously. Hermes appears to notice the mug still in Icarus' hand all at once, and lights up. \"Oh, that looks great! Let me have that!\" Icarus looks at it. The novelty mug is hideous. It's a model of the ancient view of the world: a turtle forms the base, with four elephants as pillars on top of it (apparently you're supposed to keep cookies or something in there?) and then the flat earth, which is a saucer for the actual mug which is on top of the whole mess. \"This? Uh, yeah, here you go.\" Hermes beams at him and places the monstrosity in his basket. Icarus discreetly peeks inside: among other things, he can see lavender hot pants, and a pastel-colored sleeveless shirt with a Peter Pan collar and large printed donuts covering the material. God, is he really planning to go out in public wearing - oh. No, there's worse. He sees a pair of... rhinestone-covered clunky-heeled boots on roller skates. Does this store even sell those? He blinks at the sight and gestures weakly at the wall of novelty mugs behind him, as *Hermes* admires his find (How is this Icarus' life now?). \"Uh - well, H-hermes, I guess - I would have thought you'd like this one more?\" The mug he's pointing at is simple, and comparatively non-ugly: it's white, and the handle is made to look like wings, and the words \"Speed Limit: \" are printed on the front. \"You're the fastest god... right?\" He asks, suddenly anxious that maybe he's remembering wrong and he's about to offend one of the gods, but Hermes only grins. \"Yup. Objectively true,\" he says, plucking this mug and putting it in his basket also. The sound of hushed whispering and muffled giggles reaches them, and they turn to see Amelia and Joey (the tiny-framed red-headed girl who works in grocery most of the time) watching them from the end of the aise. \"Is this your boyfriend, Icarus?\" Joey sounds breathless, probably squeeing internally. Joey does that a lot. \"Oh. I thought you'd be the twink,\" Amelia observes with a grin. \"Ah-ha. That'll bring him down here,\" Hermes says softly with a chuckle. Icarus goes crimson and starts waving his hands. \"Nononono, we're not - I've never met this guy before today! We're definitely not dating!\" \"Damn right you're not!\" Icarus tries hard not to groan at the familiar voice as it floats down the aisle towards them. Helios scowls mightily at all of them (eyes glowing where only Icarus and Hermes can see them) and drapes himself very possessively across Icarus. \"I'm the boyfriend, here!\" he jabs his thumb at himself before giving Icarus an aggressively demonstrative kiss and cuddle. Both girls look impressed and make suitable aww-ing noises (Amelia also mumbles something unintelligible about a three-twink scenario). A couple other employees are wandering over to see what's going on. \"Well, one of them, anyway,\" Hermes notes cheerfully, earning another death glare from Helios. \"The best boyfriend,\" Helios asserts, latching on to Icarus with fierce jealousy. \"What are you doing here, anyway, brat?\" Hermes holds his hands up in a universal 'Who, me?' gesture. \"Just here shopping! No harm, Helios! Icarus was just recommending a product to me - ah, here it is - \" he holds the winged mug aloft. \"Since I'm the fastest of us. Winner of every race and so on.\" This proves to be a sufficient distraction from his jealousy, as Helios bristles at this clear challenge. \"You cheated in that race! Everyone knows you did! Your stupid floppy sandals wouldn't have stood a chance against my chariot!\" Hermes hums a little and shrugs. \"I mean, except for when I totally did win.\" Helios steams and detaches one hand from latching onto Icarus, in order to point accusationally at Hermes. \"Cheated! You probably rigged the whole thing!\" \"You up for another challenge? For the right to drink from this mug?\" \"Ohmygod,\" says Joey, eyes lighting up; \"We can settle this. Supermarket Sweep!\" \"NO WAY,\" Icarus attempts to protest, but he's drowned out by cheers of approval and shouted challenges from the two gods. It's only after several display stands have been knocked over, and the store aisles look like a hurricane blew threw, and Apollo has come down to yell at Helios for missing a solar event that was supposed to be visible in the Western European Time Zone, and Hermes wins the contest and has held his prize mug aloft in triumph and Helios is consoled by everyone (including Hermes) that at least he still has the cutest boyfriend... only after all this, that it occurs to Icarus that Hermes absolutely didn't pay for that mug. The mug turns up as missing on the inventory that week, along with a few random items, all unrelated to each other except for the fact that they're all aesthetic failures. The video feed for that weekend shows nothing but footage of all the workers doing their jobs innocently. None of the employees says a word about the contest, but Icarus get winks from them all for months afterwards. And then there's the volunteer work he does at the observatory/planetarium. It's not paid, so he shouldn't be doing it. It's not even related to his intended field of aerospace engineering, so he really shouldn't be prioritizing it, not when there's so many other things he should be doing with his time. But it was at the planetarium here in the city where Icarus first felt the longing. Sitting in the battered reclining chairs as a child and hearing the narrated voice describe the constellations, the basics of planetary movements, the progression of human understanding of the cosmos... he'd felt it instantly. An overpowering urge to be there, to go up beyond the sky, up into space... Even now, even knowing what he knows, he still feels that longing. It still drives him every day. Sometimes, when he's cleaning after-hours, he sneaks into the exact seat he sat in over a decade and a half ago, and remembers that feeling. He feels sometimes like he's repaying a karmic debt to this place by serving it now, in menial unpaid volunteer work. And aside from the nostalgia, Icarus argues to himself that there's no real harm in getting some space-related experience. After all, it's not like there's a lot of opportunities to volunteer at some kind of aerospace engineering, not until he's much further along in his degree.......Until, suddenly, an opportunity does come along. --------- In spite of how Icarus is always complaining, modern life isn't any harder than it used to be for a mortal. In many ways, it's easier than Icarus can ever appreciate. He isn't likely to starve to death; the cheap, disgusting ramen noodles are cheap and disgusting, but they're food and they're available for almost nothing. He isn't likely to be eaten by a wild animal, or die of a curable disease before he turns thirty. But it is a lot more complicated, and that's what's currently irritating Helios and Apollo. There's a program advertised as seeking applicants from the observatory where Icarus spends his time. The program involves two weeks spent in a learning camp at a spacecraft design company. There's a recruiter who will be visiting this observatory soon, to talk up the program and seek attendees. Icarus, naturally, wants this desperately. Back in the old days, if a god wanted to favor a mortal, it was simple. The god would just make it so. The god desired that a favored mortal attended special training? They would simply visit the person in charge of that place and tell them to expect Icarus in a month's time. Make a godly decree and move on. Certainly, there were often problems later, when the mortal abused the gift or if a rival god got angry about it, but as far as giving the gift in the first place... it was simple, and considered the god's right. Well, that doesn't mean anything now, in this time and this place. No godly decrees. Simply calling NASA and telling them they have a candidate, produces unsatisfactory answers. In spite of his advanced interest and knowledge of the field, Icarus has insufficient formal training to catch the eye of the program representatives. He needs a sponsor of influence to connect him with the programs, and he additionally needs money to be able to attend. Coming up with a windfall of money for the extra programs turned out to be easy, all things considered, since Plutus is an amiable enough lad and open to negotiations. Helios, with his domain of Sight, agrees to provide vision to the blind god of good fortune. There could be some minor consequences to this, but it's Helios' domain and his call if he wants someone to be unblind, so they're ready should any objections arise. Luckily there's historical precedent - perhaps the only time Apollo's ever been grateful for that lout Orion. Finding the sponsor is far more difficult. They would need to seek out the correct person, with the correct connection to the correct program, and then convince that person that Icarus is the right man for the position, and then concoct some way to get the money to Icarus by way of this person.... When Apollo casts his gaze ahead to see how it could all pan out, the sheer quantity of glamours and threats involved give him a headache. Easier by far, and more natural, to simply be the person of influence. ------------ Helios can't quite believe Apollo was willing to go along with this scheme; but whatever Apollo saw when he looked to the future of using completely legitimate means, was enough to make him assent to the plan. It's something of a win-win for Helios: if it works, then they got Icarus into this elite program. If it doesn't work, Helios still gets to see Apollo wearing a really stupid disguise. Naturally, the God of Too Much Dignity had objected to the disguise, but Helios had reasonably pointed out that glamours always work better if there are tangible elements to sort of 'cement' the look. So, the appearance of a foreign scientist who happens to be at the observatory while the recruiter is present, is cemented with a large hat and glasses and a fake mustache, and a Dutch accent to complement the name of \"Dr. Kleinezon.\" (Apollo, not trusting Helios' word for some reason, had consulted other second-generation gods, with dubious results: Athena: \"I suppose it couldn't hurt...\" Aphrodite: \"It makes you look so handsome and distinguished!\" Hephaestus: \"Uh..... sure?\" Artemis: \"I mean, it takes your natural nerdiness and amplifies it by like, 6 million... that's what you're aiming for, right?\" Ares: \"I don't fuckin' care.\" Dionysus: \"You're Apollo under that mustache?! Shit! That disguise really works!\" Hermes: \"YOU NEED TO WEAR IT. DO IT FOR ME. DO IT FOR ALL OF US.\") So there he goes - Apollo, a.k.a. Dr. Kleinezon, who has caught the elbow of the visiting recruiter for the training program, and is steering him in the direction of Icarus, who is doing something stupid and menial like polishing knobs or whatever. The idea is that Apollo will discreetly lead the conversation so that Icarus can impress the program guy with his levels of nerdiness, and then offer an application for the costs through Dr. Kleinezon's own charitable scholarship program, the \"Plutus Space Exploration Fund.\" Apollo's identity is hidden behind the Dr. Kleinezon appearance, so Icarus will never know. Apollo is better at charming and manipulating mortals than Helios, who generally prefers a direct approach. Not to mention that Helios can't possibly bluff his way through a conversation on how this nerdy human shit works. So Apollo's taken the lead on this little project. Helios' contribution is to stay out of sight and make sure nothing happens while Icarus is wowing the program guy, so they won't be interrupted. Naturally, shit starts to go wrong immediately, almost as soon as their conversation starts. Helios has just enough time to watch as Dr. Kleinezon calls Icarus over, to start asking the impressive questions, before the first irritation comes up. He'd stolen one of the planetarium's t-shirts from the souvenir store - it serves as a uniform for the volunteers, and his idea was that he could intercept anybody before they could bother Icarus. Shouldn't have been a problem, right? All the kid does when he's here is clean shit! Take out trash and sweep. Helios' big plan was to just tell everyone that Icarus would 'get right on that.' A cinch. This works well enough for five minutes or so. Some lady in a planetarium shirt spots Icarus and heads over to him. Helios intercepts. Success! \"Oh - are you working today too, dear?\" the lady asks, looking a little puzzled. \"Aha, yeah! I love cleaning messes for free, so I signed right up!\" Helios still hasn't fully grasped why a person would want to do this. The lady's brow furrows faintly but then clears as Helios silently nudges a charm her way. \"Well, you're in luck, then, because the men's bathroom seems to be flooding.\" \"Icarus will get right on it,\" Helios assures her. They stare at each other a moment, before the lady clears her throat. \"It... probably can't wait. Maybe you could look into it yourself? Or, well, I was going to ask Icarus, but since you like cleaning messes so much...?\" Helios glances over at Icarus and Apollo. Apollo's netted the recruiter and 'accidentally' fallen into a conversation with Icarus; the kid's speaking animatedly now. Dammit. Helios turns grudgingly towards the bathrooms. \"Yeah... yeah, I do.\" The water situation definitely can't wait. Helios actually splashes when he walks in; he wrinkles his nose in disgust, but the water seems to be running steadily from a pipe below the sinks, rather than the toilets, so there's that. Helios considers. He could dry the water up - he's the sun, after all! - but drying it up instantly would require a level of heat that would surely be noticed, and drying it up slowly would, well, take too long. Plus this wouldn't solve the problem of the leaky pipe in the first place. And Helios sure as fuck doesn't know how to fix human plumbing systems. He scowls, trying to come up with a solution, and gives up after about twenty seconds of hard thought. \"Poseidon!!\" He has enough time to kick sullenly at the pool of water before he hears the reply. \"Hmm... would I be correct to assume that you didn't call me here for a talk or visit.\" Poseidon is looking around with mild curiosity. He, too, is standing ankle-deep in water, but as usual the cheating jerk has made it so that it doesn't leave him soaked. Also as usual, the nerd is wearing a horse-themed shirt - a simple v-neck with a drawing of a happy horse, with the word \"Hay!\" underneath. \"I always love talking to you, Poseidon,\" Helios says, more-or-less not completely dishonestly. \"But uh, yeah. I have a Situation here.\" \"You realize that I'm the god of the ocean, right? Not flooded bathrooms?\" Helios groans. \"You have mastery of ALL water, man - cmon, give me a break! I need this water gone and I can't dry it up myself without nuking the whole neighborhood!\" \"I don't always keep up on human inventions,\" Poseidon says thoughtfully. \"It's really more Hephaestus' or Athena's circle of interest. But I've heard tell of some device created... I think it's called... a mop?\" He taps his chin as though he can't quite remember. What a dick. \"Ouranos' balls! You know I don't know how to use that!\" \"I know you don't want to.\" \"Same thing - look, c'mon, it's for Icarus!\" \"Icarus is your boyfriend, not mine.\" Poseidon is watching him with that smug fucking face, he always makes that face when he knows he's about to win something great. Helios scowls as hard as he can - but Poseidon is a guy who spent most of his existence squaring off against the likes of Zeus and Athena, and it's pretty hard to intimidate him. He only raises his eyebrows now. Helios slumps his shoulders in defeat. \"Fine, fine! I'll owe you, okay?\" Poseidon smiles. He makes a gesture and the water is gone. The god of the sea turns to the pipes. \"And just because I love the Grandpa of Olympus so much, I'll even fix the leak so you won't have to owe me another favor in twenty minutes,\" he says. \"A freebie. On the house.\" \"Great,\" Helios grits out, holding back any annoyed sarcasm because he IS doing a favor, he supposes. He guesses he should just be grateful that it isn't Hermes he owes the favor to. \"Thanks.. a lot. I gotta go now and see whatever other ways this stupid human building is falling to shambles.\" \"This building is a sort of modern shrine to you and the other celestial gods, isn't it? You should be kinder,\" Poseidon chides, squatting to inspect the pipes. That's... kind of true, isn't it? Inasmuch as this human society has shrines or temples to them anymore, this would probably be one. A place where the mortals go to learn about space and the celestial bodies... They even offer sacrifices of a sort, by spending money on donations to keeping the place going, or funding research... and the vast majority of 'worshippers' aren't here for any practical purpose, just out of interest and love. Feeling slightly chastised, he trudges back out into the main lobby, and is immediately beset by another harried-looking mortal, this one a cute, slightly chubby-looking man with dark skin and a round, pleasant face. He's surrounded by a small mob of children, maybe seven or eight years old. Helios has a sinking feeling. \"Are you Icarus? I'm Mr. Martin; we're here for the ten o'clock tour!\" \"Oh... yeah...\" he says unenthusiastically, regarding the children with suspicion. Helios doesn't care for children much - too noisy and messy and chaotic, always whining, always wanting attention... just too different from Helios himself, really. Mr. Martin beams at him. \"Great! Kids, show Mr. Icarus how excited we are to LEARN today!\" The kids all duly cheer and shout, jumping around with unnecessary vigor. Great. \"Okay, kids, please follow Mr. Icarus - I'm going to go and make sure we're signed up for the special Lunch with the Stars show!... I'll catch you up in just a moment, Icarus, as soon as I get that form signed.\" Helios attempts to keep the annoyance off his face as Mr. Martin heads off in the direction of the information desk - it's right near the bathrooms. Helios really, really hopes that Poseidon doesn't notice the cute teacher and try to seduce him; Helios doesn't want to be stuck with these brats any longer than he has to be. \"Your hair looks like my hair does in the morning but Daddy makes me brush it,\" one of the brats informs him, immediately confirming his fears. \"My hair looks like it was styled by a god because it was,\" he snarls back. This makes all of them laugh delightedly; he'll never understand why kids seem to be drawn to him. He casts a longing glance at the real Icarus, who appears to be writing something down on a notebook while the recruiter makes noises that suggest he's impressed. Helios strains to see; his vision, of course, is flawless, but the only thing to see on the paper is a lot of numbers and angles and crap. What a fucking nerd. He sighs and heads over to the Hall of Constellations, which is pretty much what it sounds like - a long hall that features framed posters of the constellations. He can at least speak to this, it's just stories. And since he doesn't work during the day, he's had a long time to look at the stars at his leisure. \"Okay, so, uh... looks like we got... Orion. He used to be blind, but a really cool and generous Titan fixed his eyes so he could see. That Titan was Helios, and everyone agrees he was the best. Helios also used to hang out with Herakles - \" \"You mean Hercules,\" says one brat. \"I said Herakles, kid, and that's what I meant.\" \"Disney made a movie called Hercules. He's a hero who's best friend is a goat-man and a flying horse and his dad is Zeus and his mom is Hera and he fell in love with Meg and fought giants and Hades,\" the brat insists. Helios briefly winces and looks around to see if Hera herself has arrived to address the question of exactly whose son Herakles was; but luckily, she seems to have missed the blasphemy. Holy shit, those guys at Disney are lucky to be alive after that one. \"...Yeah, whatever. Let's, uh, let's move on.\" Half the kids are singing \"Zero to Hero\" and dancing; Helios does nothing to try to rein them in. \"Okay, Centaurus. Chiron! Half man, half horse - everyone loves this guy. Really smart. He taught pretty much any hero you've heard about. He's actually Apollo's uncle but Apollo raised him like a son. I call him \"Cuz,\" since he's mmmmyyyyHelios' cousin. And Helios is...?\" \"The coolest Titan!\" the kids chorus. \"Right! And here's Aquarius. That's Ganymede. He's Aquarius because he's the cupbearer and pours all the gods' drinks at councils and parties and stuff. Real sweet guy. Zeus' boyfriend; he's still head-over-heels for him even today.\" \"Isn't Zeus married to Hera?\" one of the kids wants to know. \"They were married right?\" \"Uh...............yeah. Um, look, Draco! Dragon! You kids like dragons, right?\" Helios is starting to sweat a little. Where the hell is Mr. Martin?! \"Draco, that's one of those dragons Ares picked up from somewhere. It's still around, making trouble, just like Ares himself. Ares loves those stupid flying snakes.\" \"My friend Jamie in Class 1B says dragons aren't real.\" Helios scoffs. \"I suppose your friend Jamie also thinks harpies, manticores and chimera weren't real too? Pfft. Send Jamie my way so I can kick his ass.\" The kids go into an excited flurry of talk about that. Helios isn't doing so bad! He moves on to Perseus. \"Man, did you guys get this story wrong. Perseus and.. yup, there's Andromeda over there. They were... I think you might say they were each other's, uh, 'beard?' you know that word? Ask your parents. Anyway, Medusa and Andromeda went on to have a really nice relationship and Perseus was basically Hermes' favorite boyfriend ever. That's why he made the constellation, to memorialize him. Perseus is a nice guy, kind of a dork but pretty badass as far as mortals go, and maybe the only person ever, who never falls for Hermes' shit. It's amazing because Hermes is one wily little fucker.\" \"Daddy says that's a bad word,\" says one little kid, eyes huge. \"She's not wrong, but sometimes a bad word is still the word you want to use, you know?\" \"You said a lot of bad words!\" \"Yeah, well, those were the best words to use, so - \" \"How about... if I take over from here,\" suggests a new (adult) voice. Helios looks around to see - Athena, wearing her best Librarian Chic outfit and a slightly-too-wide smile. \"Oh - uh, Athena, hey. What're you doing here?\" Helios asks, considerably more relaxed with the goddess of wisdom than he was with Poseidon. Athena has her flaws, but she'd never dream of creating a fuss in a nerd center. \"Hermes has been live-streaming this... effort, of yours, on Olympr. He came to record Apollo's efforts first - there's already a meme started - but after Icarus took over the conversation, he wandered over to see what you were doing with these children. Most of the audience is very entertained but I was horrified and came at once to save the children's education,\" Athena answers in ancient Greek, before turning to the kids and grinning brightly, while leaning down. \"Mr. Icarus has to run to help out at the gift shop, but my name is Ms. Athena and I can take you on the rest of your tour! You guys look pretty smart; but do any of you know how to tell time using just the stars?\" Well, it's not sex and violence, but she seems to have caught their attention. Helios doesn't ask the questions burning on his tongue, but takes the opportunity to shuffle away from all the brats. Shit, though - Hermes is here, somewhere?! Recording this?? For an audience?? As though on cue, he hears a stifled giggle and whips his head around to see a flash of blue, vanishing out of sight around a corner. Eyes narrowing, he pursues back to the main lobby - and stops dead in his tracks at the sight. \"Oh, thank god!\" One of the volunteers waves at him frantically. She's headed towards the gift shop, where an impossibly long line has formed. \"Frank had a family emergency and had to go - we need you on the register until Mannie gets here!\" Shit. \"Oh... okay...\" Helios says, not moving yet, watching as the volunteer hurries away. Run a register? He has no idea how that complicated science fiction gizmo works. \"Hmmm,\" comes a voice at his shoulder. \"No,\" Helios snarls. \"This seems like...\" \"Absolutely not!\" \"...the sort of situation...\" \"I said no, dammit!\" \"... where a god of merchants...\" \"Get lost, you little monster!\" \"...might come in handy.\" Hermes is there, wearing the planetarium's t-shirt, wearing the most pleasant and kindly smile on his face. Butter wouldn't melt in that mouth. \"You're recording all this?? You shithead! No! I don't need your help!\" \"Oh! Well, all right,\" Hermes says with a smile and a wink. Helios waits, on edge. \"...Right,\" he says with deep suspicion. \"You... agreed pretty fast.\" \"Well, it's your call! I'm only surprised, is all. I thought you liked Icarus,\" Hermes says, inspecting his nails. \"Not that it's any of your business!\" \"So I guess you'll go to that register, and totally fuck up the sales because you barely know how to count to ten let alone manage money... and let Icarus take the hit for the massive errors in money.\" Hermes' voice is so light and casual, he may as well be discussing his plans to get an ice cream cone on a walk in the park. Helios is gritting his teeth and can feel his face heating up to the point where it probably could dry up any flooded bathrooms on the whole block. Hermes' one visible eye scrunches up at the corner in amusement. \"Why drag it out? Just go ahead and ask, Grandpa Helios! I'm kind of an expert at commerce.\" \"...............Will you.......... Help me with the cash register...........\" Helios spits out. \"Hmmmm?\" Helios closes his eyes and curses Hermes, Apollo, even Hyperion for siring Helios in the first place. \"I'll..... I'll owe you one.\" He can imagine the delighted gasp of the gods watching this on Olympr. Helios grins brightly, and his voice takes that tone of ominous cheerfulness that's unique to him: \"You got it! A favor given, a favor owed!\" He waits long enough to catch Helios' defiant middle finger, and then zips off to run the till as promised. Taking a deep breath, Helios looks around for Icarus and Apollo - they're nowhere to be seen. Shoulders slumping, Helios slouches off to the back room to hide there until it's all over, and try not to think about what terrible things Poseidon and Hermes are gonna make him do - Hermes! That's a basic survival skill in Olympus, never owe Hermes anything! There's one final surprise waiting for him as he opens the door - the back entrance to the building is wide open, and he's apparently stumbled upon three of the unluckiest thieves in the world. Wearing ski masks and heavy jackets, they're hauling boxes of expensive equipment out the back door into a waiting truck and freeze at the sight of him. Helios heaves a sigh of relief. \"Finally!!\" he exclaims, cracking his knuckles. \"A problem I can deal with myself!\" --------- Hermes wears many hats, but of course, he's known most famously for being the messenger of the gods. He doesn't typically deal with the mortal postage system but as the god of heraldry, he can if he wants. It is his domain, after all. So when he's aware of the message being sent to Icarus, notifying him of his acceptance into the program, Hermes does two celebratory flips in the air - mostly because he's glad for Icarus himself. The kid deserves this break, and Hermes is confident he'll learn a lot from it. But he's genuinely pleased as well that Apollo's and Helios' gambit paid off. Hermes had the time of his life watching the two of them embarrass themselves (and the memes are never gonna die from that - Apollo's fake mustache and Helios threatening to kick a seven-year-old's ass). But they humiliated themselves willingly, for the sole purpose of trying to give Icarus the lift he needed. That's something they would never have entertained for a moment, back in the old days, and Hermes is overjoyed for his friends. For now, he hurries to get a congratulations card signed by all the gods, so that he can have it delivered at the same time as Icarus' letter.",

      "\"True.",
      "And the little cap is cute,\" Helios concedes.",
      "\"All right, so, naked except for the apron and cap-\" Face flushing crimson, Icarus hisses at them: \"You guys, I'm working right now!",
      "You have to cut it out or I'll get fired!\"",
      "Neither of them look impressed.",
      "\"So what?",
      "You have four other jobs,\" Helios points out.",
      "\"I need the money,\" Icarus pleads.",
      "\"Can't you please just - order something?\" Apollo sighs.",
      "\"Very well.",
      "It's breakfast-time for you, correct?\"",
      "\"It's...",
      "yeah, I mean, it's morning, so...\" \"Then I'll have barley bread and wine, with olives and figs.\"",
      "Icarus sighs.",
      "\"We serve coffee, tea, and those pastries there,\" he points at the display window, featuring sugary breakfast pastries.",
      "Apollo sighs again, more heavily this time.",
      "\"I'm beginning to see the source of your nutritional deficiencies.",
      "These will be addressed.\"",
      "\"We have Greek Mountain Tea.",
      "Maybe you'd like that?\"",
      "Icarus suggests desperately.",
      "The god waves his hand.",
      "\"Very well.",
      "With a teaspoon of honey added.\"",
      "While Icarus hurries to make the tea, Helios peruses the baked goods.",
      "\"What's this one?\" he asks, pointing to an item.",
      "Icarus looks over.",
      "\"Uh...",
      "caramel and cinnamon roll.\"",
      "Helios nods.",
      "\"I'll have 1200.\"",
      "Icarus gapes incredulously.",
      "\"H-hahh?!\"",
      "\"You and your sweet tooth,\" Apollo says to Helios.",
      "\"Yeah, what can I say?",
      "It's always been my favorite.\"",
      "\"You want 1200?",
      "One-two-zero-zero?\" Icarus presses.",
      "\"Standard sacrificial amount,\" Helios says.",
      "\"We don't... have that many?",
      "Like, in the entire store?",
      "And it's not a sacrifice, for- you're paying for this, right?",
      "Please tell me you have money!\"",
      "They both give him blank stares.",
      "Icarus starts to hyperventilate as he debates how he's going to deflect them, then they both snicker.",
      "\"Relax, Mop-Head.",
      "We know how to buy things.\"",
      "Helios slaps a wadded-up ball of bills on the counter.",
      "\"Now gimme my roll!\"",
      "Icarus shakily sets the tea in its paper cup down for Apollo and retrieves the cinnamon roll.",
      "These guys are not improving his anxiety.",
      "When he sets the roll on its napkin on the counter, Helios darts his hand out, grabs Icarus's wrist and pulls him forward to plant a kiss on his cheek.",
      "\"You're such a dork, Mop-Head,\" he says with a wink and a grin, reaching up to flick at Icarus's cap, knocking it at an angle over his eyes.",
      "Both gods take their goods and begin to walk out of the store.",
      "\"Catch ya later, kiddo!\"",
      "Helios calls behind him.",
      "\"We'll be sure to discuss your state of undress again later, when you're off-shift,\" Apollo adds, shutting the door behind them.",
      "The wadded-up bills cover the amount needed - which is interesting, since he hadn't told them the price, and they didn't ask.",
      "Icarus is putting the change in the tip jar, when he realizes the jar is nearly overflowing with glittering Greek coins.",
      "The old ones, drachmas and obols with ancient Greek gods printed on them.",
      "Icarus wonders if Helios and Apollo are on any of them.",
      "The coins are totally useless to him, but they make him smile, and he packs them carefully in his bag to take home and examine later.",
      "Icarus really shouldn't be spending his precious time working at the flower shop.",
      "The pay is very minimal and it doesn't do much for him in a scholarly or professional sense.",
      "There's just not a lot of benefit to doing it.",
      "But he stays there, working every Sunday and at odd free moments during the week, to help the elderly couple running the shop, mainly because it's peaceful and interesting.",
      "The smell is wonderful: floral scents and warm air hit Icarus in the face every time he walks in the shop.",
      "In the greenhouse attached to the back of the building, the smell is even stronger, and damp potting soil as well, which he finds soothing.",
      "Most of his work involves bringing stock up to the front for the elderly owners, repotting some of the live plants, and hauling around the heavy pots and bags of soil.",
      "The old lady often brings in food and cookies for Icarus, which he isn't too proud to take home with him.",
      "If she ever finds out how much he loves strawberry shortcake, he's going to end up gaining twenty pounds, he's sure.",
      "The old man tells him sometimes about the exotic places he's gone, and the seeds he's brought back.",
      "He even created a hybrid flower.",
      "Very interesting, and very peaceful....",
      "Most of the time.",
      "Sometimes, like today, it skews much further towards interesting than peaceful.",
      "Icarus walks through the greenhouse carrying an enormous armload of cut flowers, with the intent of taking them to the workbench to wrap them into bouquets, when he sees Apollo standing there, gently touching the delicate petals of a hyacinth in a brightly painted pot.",
      "Icarus slows to a stop and falters, uncertain what to say.",
      "In ordinary circumstances, he would have asked Apollo what the hell he's doing here; or asked if the god didn't have some \"sun duties\" to attend to instead of bothering Icarus; or some other sarcastic thing.",
      "But these flippant remarks are inappropriate in the face of Apollo's continued grief over losing Hyacinthus, carried over the millennia.",
      "Apollo has said before that a few thousand years is as nothing to a god; to him, the young man's death is recent and the sorrow only just barely losing the fresh sharp edge.",
      "He remembers very clearly sitting on the hillsides of Greece with Hyacinthus, wrestling and singing with him, kissing him.",
      "Revelations like these make Icarus feel small, insignificant and sad, inviting his depression to take over.",
      "\"Umm,\" he begins, with no clear idea what he might say next.",
      "As it happens, Apollo spares him from making a fool of himself.",
      "The god kisses his own fingertips and brushes them against the hyacinth, before turning to Icarus.",
      "His face, as usual, is perfectly composed - but at the sight of Icarus, his expression lightens noticeably and a small smile graces his lips.",
      "\"Icarus.",
      "What a pleasant sight.\"",
      "Apollo takes one step towards him and pauses, taking Icarus in.",
      "The god tilts his head slightly, looking Icarus up and down, bringing a faint color to his cheeks.",
      "\"Uh...",
      "what are you..?\" Icarus asks, suddenly feeling shy.",
      "\"You look - exceptionally handsome like that.",
      "With your arms filled with springtime flowers of all colors.\"",
      "Apollo holds up his hand, using his thumb and forefinger in an L-shape to... measure Icarus? Maybe?",
      "Icarus isn't an artist, he has no idea, but the attention makes his blush intensify.",
      "Apollo is still talking, as though to himself.",
      "\"Yes... perhaps seated - no, kneeling?",
      "No",
      ". Standing.",
      "Wearing a short tunic - perhaps the low-girdled chiton.",
      "Hmm.",
      "Yes.\"",
      "The god walks slowly around Icarus, taking in a different angle.",
      "\"Some flowers in your hair as well...",
      "Icarus, I'd like to paint you like this.",
      "You make a lovely composition.\"",
      "Icarus resists the urge to bury his face in the flowers.",
      "\"But I'm on shift right now,\" is all he can manage.",
      "Apollo considers himself to be sex on legs - an attractiveness and appeal that speaks for itself.",
      "Icarus has found himself far less impressed by his open attempts at seduction, and much more interested in the Apollo that's revealed in moments like these, when he shows his real personality: fussy and creative.",
      "Apollo nods.",
      "\"Of course.",
      "After your shift, then.",
      "It will give me time to collect my oils, my brushes... any other interesting props I can find.\"",
      "Okay, and to be fair, Apollo talking about oils and brushes in his Apollo-voice is suggesting something more than painting, in Icarus's mind.",
      "He does bury his face in the flowers then, and the next time Apollo speaks, he can hear the smirk.",
      "\"I look forward to capturing your body.",
      "On canvas.\"",
      "Icarus groans into the flowers, and jumps a little as he feels Apollo's fingers on his jaw, lifting his chin.",
      "His face is totally red now, probably, and Apollo's wearing that look he gets when he knows he just sent a swirl of chaos into Icarus's brain.",
      "\"A very pretty picture.",
      "Ah, but hold still...",
      "you have a smudge of dirt, from the flowers...\" Apollo runs his thumb over a possibly-invisible spot of dirt on Icarus's cheek, smiling at him.",
      "\"Ohh!\"",
      "A delighted-sounding cry from a few yards away makes them both turn.",
      "The old lady is beaming at them from where she's passing through with paper and ribbons for the bouquets.",
      "\"Icarus!",
      "Is this your boyfriend?\"",
      "Apollo easily rests his hand on Icarus's shoulder, near the curve where it meets his neck.",
      "Icarus can feel the heat from his hand through his shirt and flinches when he feels Apollo's thumb lightly caress the side of his neck.",
      "It's not fair that he's doing this when Icarus's hands are full!",
      "\"Indeed.",
      "My name is Apollo.",
      "It's a pleasure to meet you, madam.\"",
      "Apollo's voice is smooth and polite and the woman is charmed at once.",
      "\"Oh, how wonderful-Leroy!",
      "Leroy, come here, and meet Icarus's young man!\"",
      "The old man shuffles out from the office.",
      "\"You don't say!",
      "And aren't you a handsome devil.",
      "Icarus, you sly dog, why didn't you say you had a boyfriend?\" \"Uh",
      "-",
      "uhm, y-yeah, it's... mostly true...\" Icarus mumbles.",
      "The old lady is beside herself with delight.",
      "\"You should stop by more often, dear!",
      "We'd love to have you, I'm sure I can bring in more snacks to share.\"",
      "\"I'd enjoy that,\" Apollo says, shifting his hand down to Icarus's arm, giving him a sideways hug while leaning down to give him a light kiss on the temple.",
      "Icarus fights the urge to pray for lightning to strike him on the spot - such prayers, given ironically with a millennial flair for morbid drama, have taken a new significance these days.",
      "\"Dog walking?\" people ask, incredulously, and yes, Icarus wouldn't have guessed it either.",
      "But he charges $15 dollar per walk, takes anywhere from 5-7 dogs out a couple times a day, most days of the week, and it reliably nets him $400 or more every week.",
      "Plus, far and away, it's his most fun job.",
      "Originally, he'd only replied to a few ads asking for dog walkers, because he loves dogs and he figured he could use it to make sure he get exercise daily.",
      "Now, it's probably the best part of his day.",
      "The dogs are great, always happy to see him; he gets out in the fresh air for at least an hour a day, and he doesn't even have to feel guilty about enjoying himself: he's getting paid to do it!",
      "It's a Monday, just after lunch, and Icarus is taking Simon & Rosie (two fat Dalmatians), Oatmeal (some kind of pit bull mix), and Cutie Pie (a corgi) through the park on the south end of the university.",
      "The dogs are all excited to be outside, and stop to sniff interesting things and/or bark at them, when abruptly all four go still and tense.",
      "Something huge crashes through the trees - at least two, maybe three stories high, black as night.",
      "The dogs panic in a flurry of barking and running, tangling a bewildered and frightened Icarus in the leashes.",
      "When the commotion stops, Simon and Rosie are cowering behind Icarus; Oatmeal is cowering next to Icarus, sort of half-growling, half-whimpering; and Cute Pie is in front, snarling ferociously at... an enormous, three-headed dog, who is looking down at them with a combination of imperiousness and curiosity, except for the third head, which has pricked its ears at a nearby squirrel.",
      "A leash extends down from the neck(s) of this beastly dog, and at the end of the leash... Helios.",
      "Of course.",
      "\"I-I might have guessed it would be you,\" Icarus says, only stammering a little as his heart hammers inside his chest.",
      "\"Heya, Mop-Head!\"",
      "Helios greets him, waving cheerfully.",
      "\"I saw you're a really big fan of dogs, so I stole Cerberus for you, from Hades!\"",
      "He preens.",
      "\"Pretty great boyfriend, right?\" Icarus stares, wide-eyed.",
      "\"That's... Cerberus?",
      "The Guardian of the Underworld?\" \"Yup!\"",
      "\"Then... who's guarding Hades?\"",
      "There's a slight pause, hardly noticeable but telling nonetheless, before Helios grins and waves his hand dismissively.",
      "\"Pfft.",
      "Not important.",
      "It's not like that many people are trying to break in or out anymore these days, y'know?\" Icarus knows he should object, knows he should say something disapproving...",
      "but, the truth is, he is impressed.",
      "\"That's really him?",
      "Like, really Cerberus?\"",
      "He tries to take a step closer and stumbles; the dogs have entangled him badly in the leashes.",
      "Helios notices and his grin widens, a little wickedly.",
      "\"Oh-ho, I see you're all tied up at the moment, eh? Hmm.",
      "What to do about that.\"",
      "Icarus tries a little harder to untangle himself.",
      "\"Behave yourself, Helios!\"",
      "\"Now why should I do that?\"",
      "Helios has sauntered over to where Icarus is standing, trapped in place, and runs his fingers over Icarus's neck.",
      "Icarus jerks his hands up to swat Helios away, but can't, as he's still holding on to the ends of the leashes and they're wrapped around his legs.",
      "\"H-Helios, cut it out!\"",
      "he protests, scrunching up his shoulders protectively and fighting off a blush or laughter.",
      "\"No way!",
      "You're really cute like this,\" Helios looks far too pleased as he does it again, tracing lightly over Icarus's collar bone this time, prompting an embarrassing squeaky noise from Icarus.",
      "\"Helios- shit-!\"",
      "Icarus stumbles again and this time falls over.",
      "Helios catches him in a totally unnecessarily dramatic pose.",
      "\"Romantic!",
      "I like it!\"",
      "Helios's eyes are crinkled in amusement and he leans over, making kissy noises into Icarus's neck.",
      "Icarus does start laughing then and drops the leashes from his hand to push Helios's head away.",
      "\"You jerk!",
      "You're so annoying!\"",
      "he tries to scold.",
      "\"Aw, c'mon, Icarus!",
      "I surprise you at work with a great dog for your collection, catch you when you fall, and you can't even reward your awesome boyfriend with a little smooch?\"",
      "\"I only fell because of you in the first place -and you stole that dog, isn't Hades gonna be mad-?\" Icarus squawks as Helios squeezes his hips teasingly.",
      "\"Smooch smooch smooooch!",
      "C'mon, you can give me one little kiss!\"",
      "Icarus snickers again and falls back in defeat.",
      "\"One little kiss.",
      "One!\"",
      "\"Unless you beg for more,\" comes the rejoinder with a grin.",
      "Helios leans forward and presses a kiss to Icarus's cheek.",
      "The gods are surprisingly chaste at times, choosing so far to only to kiss him on the cheeks, the forehead, the neck... his hands...",
      "Icarus would be lying if he said that they didn't manage to make a kiss on the cheek feel pretty intimate anyway.",
      "After his kiss, Helios rests his forehead on Icarus's, and smiles.",
      "\"You look so damn cute when you're blushing, Mop-Head.\"",
      "Icarus blushes harder.",
      "\"I'm not-\" \"You totally are blushing!",
      "It's soooooo cute!",
      "It makes me want to kiss you more!\"",
      "After a moment of laughter and a few sneaky tickles from Helios and some more-or-less-earnest fighting from Icarus, he suddenly looks up.",
      "His four dogs are still there, sitting a few feet away and watching them with doggy looks of embarrassment on their faces.",
      "But... \"Uh...",
      "where did Cerberus go?\" \"!!!",
      "Ahhhhh shit!\"",
      "The library doesn't actually pay, per se, but if he volunteers a given number of hours, it does give him vouchers for select items purchased at the campus shops - class supplies, food and other sundries.",
      "Icarus did the math and determined that the value of the vouchers was nearly as good as actual money, with the added benefit of the convenient location where he could stop by between classes easily and rack up hours for the week.",
      "And it's fairly peaceful work.",
      "Running the checkout desk; entering returned books into the computer; shelving books; light cleaning.",
      "And Icarus is free to do some of his own homework as well, as long as he gets the list of tasks done, while still earning credit for being there.",
      "Hard to complain about it.",
      "He enjoys the tasks, and enjoys the hush of the narrow aisles, packed with books on either side, higher than his head.",
      "They have a good section on aviation: old and new books; practical and philosophical; aeronautical and astronautical.",
      "Icarus likes to sneak back to steal a few browse through them whenever he can.",
      "Icarus is on his way back to the front counter with two books in hand, when he hears a yelp of surprise, two feet to his left, where there are a couple small steps leading up to the study carrels and tables.",
      "He whips his head around and has enough time to register a mass of bright red hair, on a figure that is falling, armloads of books already dropping around them.",
      "Icarus drops his own books and just barely manages to catch the figure before they bite the floor hard.",
      "The figure is a woman, as it turns out - Icarus's hands are wrapped around her torso, narrowly missing an accidental feelski.",
      "The woman is gorgeous, the mounds of red hair tousled from her stumble, and bright green eyes wide with alarm.",
      "Icarus helps her upright again.",
      "She stands a little taller than him and has guns to rival Linda Hamilton, he notices.",
      "The green eyes turn to him and narrow just slightly.",
      "\"Jeez - are you all right?",
      "Did you turn your ankle?",
      "I'm sorry about that, those steps are the most pointless safety hazard in this building, I seriously see people trip over them hourly.",
      "Are you hurt, though?",
      "Do you need to sit down?",
      "Or I can get somebody.",
      "Or a glass of water, or something?\" Icarus is aware that he's babbling a little, but now that the woman is standing tall with the stance of someone who does not suffer bullshit lightly, and considering him with those fierce green eyes - it's a little intimidating, okay?!",
      "But thankfully, the frantic babbling must have worked, because the green eyes soften and a faint smile touches her lips.",
      "\"I'm all right.",
      "Thank you for asking.\"",
      "She seems bemused by the concern, and amused as well.",
      "He grins, relieved, and awkwardly sticks out his hand.",
      "\"Glad to hear it!",
      "I'm Icarus,\" he says, inwardly cursing himself for being such a huge fucking dork, but now that the danger is over he's not sure how he's supposed to proceed.",
      "The woman meets his awkwardness with a queenly grace, shaking his hand.",
      "\"My name is Athena.",
      "I'm grateful for your assistance.",
      "I don't often need it,\" she adds, as an afterthought.",
      "\"I can tell.",
      "Uh",
      ".",
      "You seem like a very capable lady.\"",
      "Icarus is not very eloquent today, apparently, and decides to stoop and help her gather her books instead.",
      "There are tons; seriously, why would she carry this many all at once?",
      "It would surely be easier to bring them a few at a time?",
      "She chuckles to herself.",
      "\"You risked your life, just to spare me from indignity.",
      "I don't often see that these days.\"",
      "Risked his life?",
      "A little excessive...",
      "well, maybe.",
      "There were a lot of huge, heavy books to get smushed under.",
      "Icarus is even more impressed by the lady's strength, that she could carry so many of them - All at once it hits him.",
      "Athena, she'd said her name was.",
      "Was she...",
      "*that* Athena?",
      "She had to be!",
      "That's why she had so many books!",
      "Nervous again, Icarus glanced over at the possible goddess.",
      "Athena is crouched next to him now.",
      "She fixes her hair, in a brief, utilitarian gesture, revealing a side-shave, before she also begins gathering her books again.",
      "The books are nearly all printed in the letters of ancient Greek, even though he's sure this library doesn't carry that language - yeah, it's *that* Athena, all right.",
      "She smiles at him, which helps him relax slightly.",
      "\"You said you see people come up against these stairs hourly - you must spend a lot of time here?\" Her books are stacking effortlessly in her hands, tall and heavy.",
      "\"I'm a little biased, but I think people who spend more of their time in libraries are cooler to be around.\"",
      "Icarus blushes a little and grins, pleased.",
      "\"Well, I can't take that compliment completely - I work here too, but yeah, I love spending my free time here when I can.",
      "They've got a great aviation collection.\"",
      "Athena pauses, her hand near one of his fallen books - both of which, of course, are about rockets and aviation and astronautical engineering.",
      "\"You can only be Icarus,\" she says softly, before looking at him with recognition in her eyes.",
      "\"Am I right?",
      "The mortal the two sun idiots keep bickering over?\"",
      "\"I... they bicker over me... like, there, too?",
      "In - in Olympia?\" It's strange to say that sentence aloud.",
      "All parts of it.",
      "Apollo and Helios: acknowledging that they're in some competition to gain his affections, which is crazy.",
      "It's also crazy to acknowledge that they're immortals from another realm of existence.",
      "\"All the time,\" she assures him, eyes twinkling.",
      "\"It's a pleasure to meet you at last, Icarus.\"",
      "They carry the books over to the table where she's set up camp.",
      "Another strange thing: a tiny, seriously adorable little tabby kitten, black stripes on brown fur, is batting pencils off the table.",
      "It goes without saying that the cat shouldn't be in here.",
      "Literally, it goes without saying - Icarus isn't going to mention it.",
      "\"So, uh... who's this little guy?\" is all he says, unable to keep from reaching out to pet the kitten.",
      "It pounces on his hand.",
      "\"She,\" Athena corrects.",
      "\"This is Nike.\"",
      "She says this matter-of-factly, and Icarus can't remember if Nike was supposed to be a god or if she really named her cat after a shoe or something.",
      "\"Can I ask what you're researching here?",
      "You've got a lot of books,\" Icarus says politely, as Nike shreds the cuff of his shirt.",
      "\"Oh, a little bit of everything,\" Athena says brightly.",
      "\"I couldn't decide which project I wanted to work on today, so I brought all the books over - though, I was leaning towards toreutics.\"",
      "\"Toreutics?",
      "That's... the study of artistic metal?\" Icarus has been stocking shelves in the library for a while now; he can't believe he remembers that title from a book.",
      "Athena claps her hands together and beams at him.",
      "\"Right!",
      "It's not my usual area of focus - I generally dealt with womens' crafts, and toreutics would have been Hephaestus' area - but of course, nowadays, women are much more able to create anything they please.",
      "As they should have been from the beginning.\"",
      "She sniffs; clearly this has been a sore point for her for centuries.",
      "Icarus smiles.",
      "\"For sure.",
      "I took a shop class a few years ago... one of the girls there was better than anyone else.\"",
      "\"You don't look like much of a metalsmith sort of guy.\"",
      "He shrugs sheepishly.",
      "\"Nah. I mean, I was curious, so I tried it out.",
      "Never know when I'll find something new that I'll enjoy learning...",
      "but yeah, I'm kind of a one-obsession sort of guy.",
      "I guess - I guess you already what that is,\" he says, gesturing to the aviation books on the table.",
      "\"Though I also follow cynology pretty closely,\" he says with a grin.",
      "\"The study of dogs,\" she laughs.",
      "\"Yes, I heard about Cerberus.",
      "Oh, but you know -\" she begins digging in her bag, laid on the table and also filled with books.",
      "\"Here's one you might find interesting.\"",
      "She removes and sets aside random books - more than should fit in her bag - about the most random assortment of topics, all with slips of paper printed with notes in Greek letters.",
      "After a moment she says \"Aha!\"",
      "triumphantly and presents Icarus with a slim hardcover book.",

      "He can't quite keep a blush off his face.",
      "Athena looks amused.",
      "\"Yes.",
      "And helioseismology is the study of the interior of the sun, as ascertained by studying its surface.\"",
      "She says that with a faint tease to her voice, and Icarus clears his throat.",
      "\"'Heliology' I guess they got the name from Helios?\" \"Right.",
      "The original sun god.\"",
      "\"Original doesn't mean best,\" comes a familiar voice unexpectedly from directly behind Icarus.",

      "\"He was first?",
      "But wasn't Hera the third wife...?\"",
      "Icarus asks tentatively, mostly to himself, trying to remember.",
      "Of course, from what he remembers of Zeus, the matter of who he was married to when he had his children was irrelevant.",
      "Case in point: Apollo himself, child of an illicit affair, and one who is currently leveling a glare at Icarus.",
      "Icarus swiftly holds up his hands placatingly, trying to think of how to backpedal.",
      "Athena looks smug.",
      "\"Yes.",
      "I am the firstborn of Our Father, Lord Zeus, and the original Goddess of Crafts, as well as the original Goddess of Knowledge, for that matter.\"",

      "\"I know I'm biased, and I don't know what makes a better God or Goddess of Knowledge, but I do know which one is my favorite - even though I'm really glad to have met you, Athena!\"",
      "Icarus smiles up at Apollo, and is shocked to see that the sun god is blushing.",
      "Blushing!!",
      "Discreetly, of course, and looking no less stoic than usual, but yes, his face is definitely heating up.",
      "Athena has made a little squealing gasp and is grinning at them, eyes darting back and forth between them.",

      "Yes.",
      "Thank you for your loyalty, Icarus.\"",
      "Apollo coughs embarrassedly but doesn't drop Icarus' hand.",

      "Athena waves her hand.",
      "\"We've all come a long way since then, Apollo; it's all water under the shattered bridge of your humiliating defeat.",
      "Anyway, Icarus is your lover, I'd hardly expect him to choose otherwise.",
      "The really interesting thing would be to see who he picks out of the sun gods courting him.\"",
      "They both turn to look at him, and Icarus has just enough time to feel his heart stop, when the bell dings at the front counter, indicating that someone wants to check out the book, and he flees in a red-faced panic while the gods' laughter follows him.",
      "And yup, there's also the retail job.",
      "Another soul-sucking position as stocker, cashier and general drudge; but it's a consistent paycheck that he can't turn down.",
      "It's at a regional supercenter store, with groceries as well as departments for housing goods.",
      "The place thrives off of desperate college kids to keep its business running; the management cheerfully denies promotions or pay increases on the premise that the students' schedules will only change next semester, so there's no use in investing in them for more than menial labor.",
      "Icarus keeps applying for a position as a third-shift stocker, where customer service is minimal and you get overnight pay, but it's a competitive position.",
      "Lots of applicants.",
      "But he gets lucky one weekend, and he's called to help cover a shift because one of their regular guys is \"in court again,\" which Icarus chooses to interpret as meaning jury duty.",
      "But, great news!",
      "He looks forward to three shifts of mindlessly stocking shelves and racks, for slightly better than his usual pay, and with no (or at least, very few) customers to bother him.",
      "\"It's not that great,\" explains Amelia, the shift lead, when he comes in almost skipping in delight to be there.",
      "Amelia is a gruff lumberjack sort of lady (lumberjane?), with a tattoo of Ruby on one arm and Sapphire on the other (Icarus wonders if Garnet is tattooed somewhere in the middle but it seems impolite to ask).",
      "\"It's really hard to coordinate time to hang out with your friends and family on this shift.",
      "Or get stuff done out in town.",
      "Your sleep schedule is all messed up, and you have to take Vitamin D pills, which naturally isn't covered on insurance,\" she goes on, as they drag out two pallets of dry groceries to restock.",
      "\"I'll trade you jobs,\" Icarus offers.",
      "\"We can talk to Mark on Monday and do an even swap, day shift for night shift.\"",
      "\"Pfft!",
      "Nope, not that desperate,\" she grins at him.",
      "Night shift is everything Icarus hoped for.",
      "They companionably stock shelves and chat occasionally.",
      "Shenanigans abound on night shift, as the workers have learned by now that the video monitoring is solely concerned with theft during these hours, rather than professional behavior, as there aren't many customers to impress.",
      "The workers joke and chat and it's like heaven.",
      "Icarus would buy industrial-sized containers of Vitamin D if that's the price of this kind of peace.",
      "Of course, the peace doesn't last too long.",
      "A guy comes in around 1am... someone that looks... familiar to Icarus.",
      "He's got blue hair, a cap with wings printed on the sides, and possibly the most hideous clothes Icarus has ever seen in his life, which is what tugs on his memory.",
      "He has definitely seen this guy wearing a similarly outlandish outfit somewhere before.",
      "On campus, maybe?",
      "He can't remember.",
      "The guy wanders around a little bit, occasionally putting clothes and accessories into his basket that match his aesthetic of \"random, ugly and colorful.\"",
      "Icarus tries to ignore the red flags going up in his brain and carries on stocking.",
      "He's in the household goods section, stacking a few novelty coffee mugs, when the inevitable happens and the guy approaches him.",
      "\"Icarus, right?\" comes the voice, inquisitive and bright.",
      "Icarus flinches and turns.",
      "Blue-haired guy is watching him from a few feet away, peering through the ugliest sunglasses Icarus has ever seen.",
      "There's a small smile on the guy's face, and that's what finally clues him in, where he's seen him before.",
      "He'd been talking to Helios, once, near the alley where he'd first run into the sun god.",
      "He'd been smiling then, too - actually, Icarus gets the distinct impression that this guy is probably always quietly laughing to himself, at a joke that only he gets.",
      "\"Uh - yeah, that's me.",
      "Icarus.",
      "Do you... know me?\" he asks, a little uneasily.",
      "He's not sure what to expect, here.",
      "Sure, his gods (is it all right to call them that?) seem to be generally positive towards him, but if more gods start showing up....",
      "\"Sure do!",
      "Apollo and Helios talk a lot about you.",
      "The rest of us are starting to get curious.\"",
      "The guy's smile deepens a little and Icarus is sure there's some secret joke there.",
      "\"I'm Hermes.",
      "Everyone's favorite.\"",
      "He winks at Icarus, who returns the smile nervously.",
      "Hermes appears to notice the mug still in Icarus' hand all at once, and lights up.",
      "\"Oh, that looks great!",
      "Let me have that!\"",
      "Icarus looks at it.",
      "The novelty mug is hideous.",
      "It's a model of the ancient view of the world: a turtle forms the base, with four elephants as pillars on top of it (apparently you're supposed to keep cookies or something in there?) and then the flat earth, which is a saucer for the actual mug which is on top of the whole mess.",
      "\"This?",
      "Uh",
      ",",
      "yeah, here you go.\"",
      "Hermes beams at him and places the monstrosity in his basket.",
      "Icarus discreetly peeks inside: among other things, he can see lavender hot pants, and a pastel-colored sleeveless shirt with a Peter Pan collar and large printed donuts covering the material.",
      "God, is he really planning to go out in public wearing - oh.",
      "No, there's worse.",
      "He sees a pair of... rhinestone-covered clunky-heeled boots on roller skates.",
      "Does this store even sell those?",
      "He blinks at the sight and gestures weakly at the wall of novelty mugs behind him, as *Hermes* admires his find (How is this Icarus' life now?).",
      "\"Uh - well, H-hermes, I guess - I would have thought you'd like this one more?\"",
      "The mug he's pointing at is simple, and comparatively non-ugly: it's white, and the handle is made to look like wings, and the words \"Speed Limit: \" are printed on the front.",
      "\"You're the fastest god... right?\"",
      "He asks, suddenly anxious that maybe he's remembering wrong and he's about to offend one of the gods, but Hermes only grins.",
      "\"Yup.",
      "Objectively true,\" he says, plucking this mug and putting it in his basket also.",
      "The sound of hushed whispering and muffled giggles reaches them, and they turn to see Amelia and Joey (the tiny-framed red-headed girl who works in grocery most of the time) watching them from the end of the aise.",
      "\"Is this your boyfriend, Icarus?\" Joey sounds breathless, probably squeeing internally.",
      "Joey does that a lot.",
      "\"Oh.",
      "I thought you'd be the twink,\" Amelia observes with a grin.",
      "\"Ah-ha.",
      "That'll bring him down here,\" Hermes says softly with a chuckle.",
      "Icarus goes crimson and starts waving his hands.",
      "\"Nononono, we're not - I've never met this guy before today!",
      "We're definitely not dating!\"",
      "\"Damn right you're not!\"",
      "Icarus tries hard not to groan at the familiar voice as it floats down the aisle towards them.",
      "Helios scowls mightily at all of them (eyes glowing where only Icarus and Hermes can see them) and drapes himself very possessively across Icarus.",
      "\"I'm the boyfriend, here!\"",
      "he jabs his thumb at himself before giving Icarus an aggressively demonstrative kiss and cuddle.",
      "Both girls look impressed and make suitable aww-ing noises (Amelia also mumbles something unintelligible about a three-twink scenario).",
      "A couple other employees are wandering over to see what's going on.",
      "\"Well, one of them, anyway,\" Hermes notes cheerfully, earning another death glare from Helios.",
      "\"The best boyfriend,\" Helios asserts, latching on to Icarus with fierce jealousy.",
      "\"What are you doing here, anyway, brat?\" Hermes holds his hands up in a universal 'Who, me?' gesture.",
      "\"Just here shopping!",
      "No harm, Helios!",
      "Icarus was just recommending a product to me - ah, here it is - \" he holds the winged mug aloft.",
      "\"Since I'm the fastest of us.",
      "Winner of every race and so on.\"",
      "This proves to be a sufficient distraction from his jealousy, as Helios bristles at this clear challenge.",
      "\"You cheated in that race!",
      "Everyone knows you did!",
      "Your stupid floppy sandals wouldn't have stood a chance against my chariot!\"",
      "Hermes hums a little and shrugs.",
      "\"I mean, except for when I totally did win.\"",
      "Helios steams and detaches one hand from latching onto Icarus, in order to point accusationally at Hermes.",
      "\"Cheated!",
      "You probably rigged the whole thing!\"",
      "\"You up for another challenge?",
      "For the right to drink from this mug?\"",
      "\"Ohmygod,\" says Joey, eyes lighting up; \"We can settle this.",
      "Supermarket Sweep!\"",
      "\"NO WAY,\" Icarus attempts to protest, but he's drowned out by cheers of approval and shouted challenges from the two gods.",
      "It's only after several display stands have been knocked over, and the store aisles look like a hurricane blew threw, and Apollo has come down to yell at Helios for missing a solar event that was supposed to be visible in the Western European Time Zone, and Hermes wins the contest and has held his prize mug aloft in triumph and Helios is consoled by everyone (including Hermes) that at least he still has the cutest boyfriend...",
      "only after all this, that it occurs to Icarus that Hermes absolutely didn't pay for that mug.",
      "The mug turns up as missing on the inventory that week, along with a few random items, all unrelated to each other except for the fact that they're all aesthetic failures.",
      "The video feed for that weekend shows nothing but footage of all the workers doing their jobs innocently.",
      "None of the employees says a word about the contest, but Icarus get winks from them all for months afterwards.",
      "And then there's the volunteer work he does at the observatory/planetarium.",
      "It's not paid, so he shouldn't be doing it.",
      "It's not even related to his intended field of aerospace engineering, so he really shouldn't be prioritizing it, not when there's so many other things he should be doing with his time.",
      "But it was at the planetarium here in the city where Icarus first felt the longing.",
      "Sitting in the battered reclining chairs as a child and hearing the narrated voice describe the constellations, the basics of planetary movements, the progression of human understanding of the cosmos... he'd felt it instantly.",
      "An overpowering urge to be there, to go up beyond the sky, up into space...",
      "Even now, even knowing what he knows, he still feels that longing.",
      "It still drives him every day.",
      "Sometimes, when he's cleaning after-hours, he sneaks into the exact seat he sat in over a decade and a half ago, and remembers that feeling.",
      "He feels sometimes like he's repaying a karmic debt to this place by serving it now, in menial unpaid volunteer work.",
      "And aside from the nostalgia, Icarus argues to himself that there's no real harm in getting some space-related experience.",
      "After all, it's not like there's a lot of opportunities to volunteer at some kind of aerospace engineering, not until he's much further along in his degree.......Until, suddenly, an opportunity does come along.",
      "---------",
      "In spite of how Icarus is always complaining, modern life isn't any harder than it used to be for a mortal.",
      "In many ways, it's easier than Icarus can ever appreciate.",
      "He isn't likely to starve to death; the cheap, disgusting ramen noodles are cheap and disgusting, but they're food and they're available for almost nothing.",
      "He isn't likely to be eaten by a wild animal, or die of a curable disease before he turns thirty.",
      "But it is a lot more complicated, and that's what's currently irritating Helios and Apollo.",
      "There's a program advertised as seeking applicants from the observatory where Icarus spends his time.",
      "The program involves two weeks spent in a learning camp at a spacecraft design company.",
      "There's a recruiter who will be visiting this observatory soon, to talk up the program and seek attendees.",
      "Icarus, naturally, wants this desperately.",
      "Back in the old days, if a god wanted to favor a mortal, it was simple.",
      "The god would just make it so.",
      "The god desired that a favored mortal attended special training?",
      "They would simply visit the person in charge of that place and tell them to expect Icarus in a month's time.",
      "Make a godly decree and move on.",
      "Certainly, there were often problems later, when the mortal abused the gift or if a rival god got angry about it, but as far as giving the gift in the first place...",
      "it was simple, and considered the god's right.",
      "Well, that doesn't mean anything now, in this time and this place.",
      "No godly decrees.",
      "Simply calling NASA and telling them they have a candidate, produces unsatisfactory answers.",
      "In spite of his advanced interest and knowledge of the field, Icarus has insufficient formal training to catch the eye of the program representatives.",
      "He needs a sponsor of influence to connect him with the programs, and he additionally needs money to be able to attend.",
      "Coming up with a windfall of money for the extra programs turned out to be easy, all things considered, since Plutus is an amiable enough lad and open to negotiations.",
      "Helios, with his domain of Sight, agrees to provide vision to the blind god of good fortune.",
      "There could be some minor consequences to this, but it's Helios' domain and his call if he wants someone to be unblind, so they're ready should any objections arise.",
      "Luckily there's historical precedent - perhaps the only time Apollo's ever been grateful for that lout Orion.",
      "Finding the sponsor is far more difficult.",
      "They would need to seek out the correct person, with the correct connection to the correct program, and then convince that person that Icarus is the right man for the position, and then concoct some way to get the money to Icarus by way of this person....",
      "When Apollo casts his gaze ahead to see how it could all pan out, the sheer quantity of glamours and threats involved give him a headache.",
      "Easier by far, and more natural, to simply be the person of influence.",
      "------------ Helios can't quite believe Apollo was willing to go along with this scheme; but whatever Apollo saw when he looked to the future of using completely legitimate means, was enough to make him assent to the plan.",
      "It's something of a win-win for Helios: if it works, then they got Icarus into this elite program.",
      "If it doesn't work, Helios still gets to see Apollo wearing a really stupid disguise.",
      "Naturally, the God of Too Much Dignity had objected to the disguise, but Helios had reasonably pointed out that glamours always work better if there are tangible elements to sort of 'cement' the look.",
      "So, the appearance of a foreign scientist who happens to be at the observatory while the recruiter is present, is cemented with a large hat and glasses and a fake mustache, and a Dutch accent to complement the name of \"Dr. Kleinezon.\"",
      "(Apollo, not trusting Helios' word for some reason, had consulted other second-generation gods, with dubious results: Athena: \"I suppose it couldn't hurt...\" Aphrodite: \"It makes you look so handsome and distinguished!\"",
      "Hephaestus: \"Uh",
      ".....",
      "sure?\" Artemis: \"I mean, it takes your natural nerdiness and amplifies it by like, 6 million... that's what you're aiming for, right?\" Ares: \"I don't fuckin' care.\"",
      "Dionysus: \"You're Apollo under that mustache?!",
      "Shit!",
      "That disguise really works!\"",
      "Hermes: \"YOU NEED TO WEAR IT.",
      "DO IT FOR ME.",
      "DO IT FOR ALL OF US.\")",
      "So there he goes - Apollo, a.k.a. Dr. Kleinezon, who has caught the elbow of the visiting recruiter for the training program, and is steering him in the direction of Icarus, who is doing something stupid and menial like polishing knobs or whatever.",
      "The idea is that Apollo will discreetly lead the conversation so that Icarus can impress the program guy with his levels of nerdiness, and then offer an application for the costs through Dr. Kleinezon's own charitable scholarship program, the \"Plutus Space Exploration Fund.\"",
      "Apollo's identity is hidden behind the Dr. Kleinezon appearance, so Icarus will never know.",
      "Apollo is better at charming and manipulating mortals than Helios, who generally prefers a direct approach.",
      "Not to mention that Helios can't possibly bluff his way through a conversation on how this nerdy human shit works.",
      "So Apollo's taken the lead on this little project.",
      "Helios' contribution is to stay out of sight and make sure nothing happens while Icarus is wowing the program guy, so they won't be interrupted.",
      "Naturally, shit starts to go wrong immediately, almost as soon as their conversation starts.",
      "Helios has just enough time to watch as Dr. Kleinezon calls Icarus over, to start asking the impressive questions, before the first irritation comes up.",
      "He'd stolen one of the planetarium's t-shirts from the souvenir store - it serves as a uniform for the volunteers, and his idea was that he could intercept anybody before they could bother Icarus.",
      "Shouldn't have been a problem, right?",
      "All the kid does when he's here is clean shit!",
      "Take out trash and sweep.",
      "Helios' big plan was to just tell everyone that Icarus would 'get right on that.'",
      "A cinch.",
      "This works well enough for five minutes or so.",
      "Some lady in a planetarium shirt spots Icarus and heads over to him.",
      "Helios intercepts.",
      "Success!",
      "\"Oh - are you working today too, dear?\" the lady asks, looking a little puzzled.",
      "\"Aha, yeah!",
      "I love cleaning messes for free, so I signed right up!\"",
      "Helios still hasn't fully grasped why a person would want to do this.",
      "The lady's brow furrows faintly but then clears as Helios silently nudges a charm her way.",
      "\"Well, you're in luck, then, because the men's bathroom seems to be flooding.\"",
      "\"Icarus will get right on it,\" Helios assures her.",
      "They stare at each other a moment, before the lady clears her throat.",
      "\"It... probably can't wait.",
      "Maybe you could look into it yourself?",
      "Or, well, I was going to ask Icarus, but since you like cleaning messes so much...?\"",
      "Helios glances over at Icarus and Apollo.",
      "Apollo's netted the recruiter and 'accidentally' fallen into a conversation with Icarus; the kid's speaking animatedly now.",
      "Dammit.",
      "Helios turns grudgingly towards the bathrooms.",
      "\"Yeah...",
      "yeah, I do.\"",
      "The water situation definitely can't wait.",
      "Helios actually splashes when he walks in; he wrinkles his nose in disgust, but the water seems to be running steadily from a pipe below the sinks, rather than the toilets, so there's that.",
      "Helios considers.",
      "He could dry the water up - he's the sun, after all!",
      "- but drying it up instantly would require a level of heat that would surely be noticed, and drying it up slowly would, well, take too long.",
      "Plus this wouldn't solve the problem of the leaky pipe in the first place.",
      "And Helios sure as fuck doesn't know how to fix human plumbing systems.",
      "He scowls, trying to come up with a solution, and gives up after about twenty seconds of hard thought.",
      "\"Poseidon!!\"",
      "He has enough time to kick sullenly at the pool of water before he hears the reply.",
      "\"Hmm... would I be correct to assume that you didn't call me here for a talk or visit.\"",
      "Poseidon is looking around with mild curiosity.",
      "He, too, is standing ankle-deep in water, but as usual the cheating jerk has made it so that it doesn't leave him soaked.",
      "Also as usual, the nerd is wearing a horse-themed shirt - a simple v-neck with a drawing of a happy horse, with the word \"Hay!\"",
      "underneath.",
      "\"I always love talking to you, Poseidon,\" Helios says, more-or-less not completely dishonestly.",
      "\"But uh, yeah.",
      "I have a Situation here.\"",
      "\"You realize that I'm the god of the ocean, right?",
      "Not flooded bathrooms?\" Helios groans.",
      "\"You have mastery of ALL water, man - cmon, give me a break!",
      "I need this water gone and I can't dry it up myself without nuking the whole neighborhood!\"",
      "\"I don't always keep up on human inventions,\" Poseidon says thoughtfully.",
      "\"It's really more Hephaestus' or Athena's circle of interest.",
      "But I've heard tell of some device created...",
      "I think it's called... a mop?\"",
      "He taps his chin as though he can't quite remember.",
      "What a dick.",
      "\"Ouranos' balls!",
      "You know I don't know how to use that!\"",
      "\"I know you don't want to.\"",
      "\"Same thing - look, c'mon, it's for Icarus!\"",
      "\"Icarus is your boyfriend, not mine.\"",
      "Poseidon is watching him with that smug fucking face, he always makes that face when he knows he's about to win something great.",
      "Helios scowls as hard as he can - but Poseidon is a guy who spent most of his existence squaring off against the likes of Zeus and Athena, and it's pretty hard to intimidate him.",
      "He only raises his eyebrows now.",
      "Helios slumps his shoulders in defeat.",
      "\"Fine, fine!",
      "I'll owe you, okay?\" Poseidon smiles.",
      "He makes a gesture and the water is gone.",
      "The god of the sea turns to the pipes.",
      "\"And just because I love the Grandpa of Olympus so much, I'll even fix the leak so you won't have to owe me another favor in twenty minutes,\" he says.",
      "\"A freebie.",
      "On the house.\"",
      "\"Great,\" Helios grits out, holding back any annoyed sarcasm because he IS doing a favor, he supposes.",
      "He guesses he should just be grateful that it isn't Hermes he owes the favor to.",
      "\"Thanks.. a lot.",
      "I gotta go now and see whatever other ways this stupid human building is falling to shambles.\"",
      "\"This building is a sort of modern shrine to you and the other celestial gods, isn't it?",
      "You should be kinder,\" Poseidon chides, squatting to inspect the pipes.",
      "That's... kind of true, isn't it?",
      "Inasmuch as this human society has shrines or temples to them anymore, this would probably be one.",
      "A place where the mortals go to learn about space and the celestial bodies...",
      "They even offer sacrifices of a sort, by spending money on donations to keeping the place going, or funding research... and the vast majority of 'worshippers' aren't here for any practical purpose, just out of interest and love.",
      "Feeling slightly chastised, he trudges back out into the main lobby, and is immediately beset by another harried-looking mortal, this one a cute, slightly chubby-looking man with dark skin and a round, pleasant face.",
      "He's surrounded by a small mob of children, maybe seven or eight years old.",
      "Helios has a sinking feeling.",
      "\"Are you Icarus?",
      "I'm Mr. Martin; we're here for the ten o'clock tour!\"",
      "\"Oh... yeah...\" he says unenthusiastically, regarding the children with suspicion.",
      "Helios doesn't care for children much - too noisy and messy and chaotic, always whining, always wanting attention... just too different from Helios himself, really.",
      "Mr. Martin beams at him.",
      "\"Great!",
      "Kids, show Mr. Icarus how excited we are to LEARN today!\"",
      "The kids all duly cheer and shout, jumping around with unnecessary vigor.",
      "Great.",
      "\"Okay, kids, please follow Mr. Icarus - I'm going to go and make sure we're signed up for the special Lunch with the Stars show!...",
      "I'll catch you up in just a moment, Icarus, as soon as I get that form signed.\"",
      "Helios attempts to keep the annoyance off his face as Mr. Martin heads off in the direction of the information desk - it's right near the bathrooms.",
      "Helios really, really hopes that Poseidon doesn't notice the cute teacher and try to seduce him; Helios doesn't want to be stuck with these brats any longer than he has to be.",
      "\"Your hair looks like my hair does in the morning but Daddy makes me brush it,\" one of the brats informs him, immediately confirming his fears.",
      "\"My hair looks like it was styled by a god because it was,\" he snarls back.",
      "This makes all of them laugh delightedly; he'll never understand why kids seem to be drawn to him.",
      "He casts a longing glance at the real Icarus, who appears to be writing something down on a notebook while the recruiter makes noises that suggest he's impressed.",
      "Helios strains to see; his vision, of course, is flawless, but the only thing to see on the paper is a lot of numbers and angles and crap.",
      "What a fucking nerd.",
      "He sighs and heads over to the Hall of Constellations, which is pretty much what it sounds like - a long hall that features framed posters of the constellations.",
      "He can at least speak to this, it's just stories.",
      "And since he doesn't work during the day, he's had a long time to look at the stars at his leisure.",
      "\"Okay, so, uh... looks like we got... Orion.",
      "He used to be blind, but a really cool and generous Titan fixed his eyes so he could see.",
      "That Titan was Helios, and everyone agrees he was the best.",
      "Helios also used to hang out with Herakles - \" \"You mean Hercules,\" says one brat.",
      "\"I said Herakles, kid, and that's what I meant.\"",
      "\"Disney made a movie called Hercules.",
      "He's a hero who's best friend is a goat-man and a flying horse and his dad is Zeus and his mom is Hera and he fell in love with Meg and fought giants and Hades,\" the brat insists.",
      "Helios briefly winces and looks around to see if Hera herself has arrived to address the question of exactly whose son Herakles was; but luckily, she seems to have missed the blasphemy.",
      "Holy shit, those guys at Disney are lucky to be alive after that one.",
      "\"...",
      "Yeah, whatever.",
      "Let's, uh, let's move on.\"",
      "Half the kids are singing \"Zero to Hero\" and dancing; Helios does nothing to try to rein them in.",
      "\"Okay, Centaurus.",
      "Chiron!",
      "Half man, half horse - everyone loves this guy.",
      "Really smart.",
      "He taught pretty much any hero you've heard about.",
      "He's actually Apollo's uncle but Apollo raised him like a son.",
      "I call him \"Cuz,\" since he's mmmmyyyyHelios' cousin.",
      "And Helios is...?\"",
      "\"The coolest Titan!\"",
      "the kids chorus.",
      "\"Right!",
      "And here's Aquarius.",
      "That's Ganymede.",
      "He's Aquarius because he's the cupbearer and pours all the gods' drinks at councils and parties and stuff.",
      "Real sweet guy.",
      "Zeus' boyfriend; he's still head-over-heels for him even today.\"",
      "\"Isn't Zeus married to Hera?\" one of the kids wants to know.",

      "...............",
      "yeah.",
      "Um, look, Draco!",
      "Dragon!",
      "You kids like dragons, right?\"",
      "Helios is starting to sweat a little.",
      "Where the hell is Mr. Martin?!",
      "\"Draco, that's one of those dragons Ares picked up from somewhere.",
      "It's still around, making trouble, just like Ares himself.",
      "Ares loves those stupid flying snakes.\"",
      "\"My friend Jamie in Class 1B says dragons aren't real.\"",
      "Helios scoffs.",
      "\"I suppose your friend Jamie also thinks harpies, manticores and chimera weren't real too?",
      "Pfft.",
      "Send Jamie my way so I can kick his ass.\"",
      "The kids go into an excited flurry of talk about that.",
      "Helios isn't doing so bad!",
      "He moves on to Perseus. \"Man, did you guys get this story wrong.",
      "Perseus and.. yup, there's Andromeda over there.",
      "They were...",
      "I think you might say they were each other's, uh, 'beard?' you know that word?",
      "Ask your parents.",
      "Anyway, Medusa and Andromeda went on to have a really nice relationship and Perseus was basically Hermes' favorite boyfriend ever.",
      "That's why he made the constellation, to memorialize him.",
      "Perseus is a nice guy, kind of a dork but pretty badass as far as mortals go, and maybe the only person ever, who never falls for Hermes' shit.",
      "It's amazing because Hermes is one wily little fucker.\"",
      "\"Daddy says that's a bad word,\" says one little kid, eyes huge.",
      "\"She's not wrong, but sometimes a bad word is still the word you want to use, you know?\"",
      "\"You said a lot of bad words!\"",
      "\"Yeah, well, those were the best words to use, so - \" \"How about... if I take over from here,\" suggests a new (adult) voice.",
      "Helios looks around to see - Athena, wearing her best Librarian Chic outfit and a slightly-too-wide smile.",
      "\"Oh - uh, Athena, hey.",
      "What're you doing here?\" Helios asks, considerably more relaxed with the goddess of wisdom than he was with Poseidon.",
      "Athena has her flaws, but she'd never dream of creating a fuss in a nerd center.",
      "\"Hermes has been live-streaming this... effort, of yours, on Olympr.",
      "He came to record Apollo's efforts first - there's already a meme started - but after Icarus took over the conversation, he wandered over to see what you were doing with these children.",
      "Most of the audience is very entertained but I was horrified and came at once to save the children's education,\" Athena answers in ancient Greek, before turning to the kids and grinning brightly, while leaning down.",
      "\"Mr. Icarus has to run to help out at the gift shop, but my name is Ms. Athena and I can take you on the rest of your tour!",
      "You guys look pretty smart; but do any of you know how to tell time using just the stars?\"",
      "Well, it's not sex and violence, but she seems to have caught their attention.",
      "Helios doesn't ask the questions burning on his tongue, but takes the opportunity to shuffle away from all the brats.",
      "Shit, though - Hermes is here, somewhere?!",
      "Recording this??",
      "For an audience??",
      "As though on cue, he hears a stifled giggle and whips his head around to see a flash of blue, vanishing out of sight around a corner.",
      "Eyes narrowing, he pursues back to the main lobby - and stops dead in his tracks at the sight.",
      "\"Oh, thank god!\"",
      "One of the volunteers waves at him frantically.",
      "She's headed towards the gift shop, where an impossibly long line has formed.",
      "\"Frank had a family emergency and had to go - we need you on the register until Mannie gets here!\"",
      "Shit.",
      "\"Oh... okay...\" Helios says, not moving yet, watching as the volunteer hurries away.",
      "Run a register?",
      "He has no idea how that complicated science fiction gizmo works.",
      "\"Hmmm,\" comes a voice at his shoulder.",
      "\"No,\" Helios snarls.",
      "\"This seems like...\" \"Absolutely not!\"",
      "\"...the sort of situation...\" \"I said no, dammit!\"",
      "\"... where a god of merchants...\" \"Get lost, you little monster!\"",
      "\"...might come in handy.\"",
      "Hermes is there, wearing the planetarium's t-shirt, wearing the most pleasant and kindly smile on his face.",
      "Butter wouldn't melt in that mouth.",
      "\"You're recording all this??",
      "You shithead!",
      "No",
      "! I don't need your help!\"",
      "\"Oh!",
      "Well, all right,\" Hermes says with a smile and a wink.",
      "Helios waits, on edge.",
      "\"...Right,\" he says with deep suspicion.",
      "\"You... agreed pretty fast.\"",
      "\"Well, it's your call!",
      "I'm only surprised, is all.",
      "I thought you liked Icarus,\" Hermes says, inspecting his nails.",
      "\"Not that it's any of your business!\"",
      "\"So I guess you'll go to that register, and totally fuck up the sales because you barely know how to count to ten let alone manage money... and let Icarus take the hit for the massive errors in money.\"",
      "Hermes' voice is so light and casual, he may as well be discussing his plans to get an ice cream cone on a walk in the park.",
      "Helios is gritting his teeth and can feel his face heating up to the point where it probably could dry up any flooded bathrooms on the whole block.",
      "Hermes' one visible eye scrunches up at the corner in amusement.",
      "\"Why drag it out?",
      "Just go ahead and ask, Grandpa Helios!",
      "I'm kind of an expert at commerce.\"",
      "\"...............Will you..........",
      "Help me with the cash register...........\" Helios spits out.",
      "\"Hmmmm?\"",
      "Helios closes his eyes and curses Hermes, Apollo, even Hyperion for siring Helios in the first place.",
      "\"I'll..... I'll owe you one.\"",
      "He can imagine the delighted gasp of the gods watching this on Olympr.",
      "Helios grins brightly, and his voice takes that tone of ominous cheerfulness that's unique to him: \"You got it!",
      "A favor given, a favor owed!\"",
      "He waits long enough to catch Helios' defiant middle finger, and then zips off to run the till as promised.",
      "Taking a deep breath, Helios looks around for Icarus and Apollo - they're nowhere to be seen.",
      "Shoulders slumping, Helios slouches off to the back room to hide there until it's all over, and try not to think about what terrible things Poseidon and Hermes are gonna make him do - Hermes!",
      "That's a basic survival skill in Olympus, never owe Hermes anything!",
      "There's one final surprise waiting for him as he opens the door - the back entrance to the building is wide open, and he's apparently stumbled upon three of the unluckiest thieves in the world.",
      "Wearing ski masks and heavy jackets, they're hauling boxes of expensive equipment out the back door into a waiting truck and freeze at the sight of him.",
      "Helios heaves a sigh of relief.",
      "\"Finally!!\"",
      "he exclaims, cracking his knuckles.",
      "\"A problem I can deal with myself!\"",
      "--------- Hermes wears many hats, but of course, he's known most famously for being the messenger of the gods.",
      "He doesn't typically deal with the mortal postage system but as the god of heraldry, he can if he wants.",
      "It is his domain, after all.",
      "So when he's aware of the message being sent to Icarus, notifying him of his acceptance into the program, Hermes does two celebratory flips in the air - mostly because he's glad for Icarus himself.",
      "The kid deserves this break, and Hermes is confident he'll learn a lot from it.",
      "But he's genuinely pleased as well that Apollo's and Helios' gambit paid off.",
      "Hermes had the time of his life watching the two of them embarrass themselves (and the memes are never gonna die from that - Apollo's fake mustache and Helios threatening to kick a seven-year-old's ass).",
      "But they humiliated themselves willingly, for the sole purpose of trying to give Icarus the lift he needed.",
      "That's something they would never have entertained for a moment, back in the old days, and Hermes is overjoyed for his friends.",
      "For now, he hurries to get a congratulations card signed by all the gods, so that he can have it delivered at the same time as Icarus' letter."

    "text": "The gods find out separately - Helios sees a flyer pinned to the bulletin board in the entrance foyer of the retail store; Apollo is chatting up Leroy and Elverna at the flower shop when they mention wanting to see the 4-H kids' garden and crop entries. Icarus doesn't realize they've found out about the city's Summer Jamboree until it's too late - the gods, perhaps anticipating Icarus' usual excuses, catch him the moment he returns back from walking the dogs that morning, and frogmarch him back out and into Apollo's chariot, ignoring his protests and threatening to tie him up if he tries to get away. Icarus points out that this is technically kidnapping, but otherwise subsides with a minimum of grumbling. Secretly, he had been interested in the carnival, but of course, he can't let them know - they already take far too many liberties with his life as it is, and conceding an inch will mean they take fifty miles. --------------- They start by watching the parade, with locals in homemade floats and children and teenagers marching with their bands or Scouts or other groups (Helios embarrasses Icarus by insisting on going after the candy and cheap toys the marchers are handing out), and then they follow the crowds to the carnival grounds. They get their faces painted. Helios gets an ice-cream and a cupcake on his face; Apollo opts for a sort of twinkly flower/stars design. Under enormous pressure from both of them, Icarus relents and gets a sunshine motif on his cheeks that sends them both into fits of delight. They examine the 'animal zone' - there's a quarter-acre or so with goats, miniature donkeys, ducks, a camel, and baby deer that all tolerate being petted in exchange for treats at the feeding stations. Apollo and Helios both are less interested in this than Icarus, but they agree to go. The deer flock to them (\"They probably smell Artemis or Selene\"), while Icarus bonds with a fat, spotted duck. Then they go to watch part of the dog costume contest. Icarus watches longingly and puts in his vote for a wire fox terrier wearing a frog suit. They eat endless junk food. The food trucks offer literally nothing healthy, but Helios and Icarus both tell Apollo he isn't permitted to comment. He complies, but not without sulking about it. \"It's carnival food, and you were the one who wanted to come here so bad,\" Icarus says. \"The farmer's market is every week if you want healthy food.\" \"Maybe you can try not being such a snobby dillhole and just eat the damn elephant ears,\" Helios suggests. Helios buys a number of fried confections himself, as well as cotton candy and the Dippin Dots ice cream, but seems more interested in stealing whatever Icarus got for himself. Scolding him only makes him laugh and steal more aggressively, often right out of Icarus' hand. He claims it tastes better that way. At one point, the paper cone holding a sweet snack unexpectedly gives way, and melting chocolate syrup leaks over Icarus' hand. While he's searching for a napkin, Helios takes hold of his wrist and licks the syrup off one of Icarus' fingers. The sensation almost makes Icarus sees stars, and he makes a weird stunned/shy face, and Helios laughs and reiterates that it really does taste better coming from Icarus. ----------- They play the arcade games. Skeeball is Icarus' favorite; he pleasantly spends a few rounds at one of the booths before realizing that he hasn't seen or heard from Helios or Apollo in a while. He panics when he spots Helios at the Whack-a-Mole and Apollo headed for the kissing booth; he just barely manages to snatch them both up before they spend their tickets at these games of doom, and prevents them from creating any serious property damage or lawsuits. \"Please, Icarus, 'lawsuit?' I wouldn't try to truly seduce anyone in such a crass manner. I was only going to offer some tips for success,\" Apollo complains. \"Eh, it would be wasted anyway,\" Helios puts in. \"I went over there earlier, and they don't exactly kiss for real. I just got a peck on the cheek. I mean it was a nice kiss, and the guy was pretty cute, but it's not the kind of thing you need tips for, you know?\" Icarus is luckily distracted from a brief, unexpected swell of jealousy as the two gods notice the dunk tank - Icarus forbids them from this as well, forseeing a war breaking out between the two of them. At their complaints, he guides them to acceptable games A few shooting games (unsurprisingly, Apollo dominates and wins several plushies, which he graciously gifts to Icarus). A few strength games (Helios shows his skill here, ringing bells by pounding a platform with a hammer and similar contests. He appears torn between wanting to give his plushies to Icarus and wanting to keep them for himself. Icarus tells him to hold on to them for now; the compromise pleases Helios). Exactly one confidence trick - the shell game, which Apollo sees straight through using his gift of clairvoyance. \"Since Apollo's cheating,\" referring to the clairvoyance, Helios enters a 'guess your weight' game and cheats by manipulating his body mass through subtle shapeshifting. Icarus gets obsessed with trying to win a pet betta fish: he tries repeatedly to toss a ping pong into an empty fish bowl, which shouldn't be hard! But every time he's sure he's lined up the shot right, the wind will blow, or someone will startle him with a loud noise. Eventually, sharp-eyed Apollo leans into him, way too close, pressing his chest to Icarus' back, and taking his wrist, murmuring tips into his ear, and guiding the ping pong ball easily into the bowl. The girl running the game is blushing as hard as Icarus when she gives him a ticket and tells him to get the fish when they're ready to go. Icarus decides after that, it's time to move on from the games. ----------- They head over to the rides. This starts out fun enough - the 'bobsled' ride is fun; the 'scrambler' ride is fun; the 'madhouse' ride - with the illusion of movement - is delightful. They try out the devil's wheel: a fast-spinning plate designed to use centrifugal forces to fling the riders off into a foam pit. Icarus almost immediately starts to be dragged off the edge, until the gods drape themselves on top of him, holding him in place. They seem more than a little delighted with the arrangement, and don't immediately climb off of him when the ride stops, waiting until Icarus finally laughs and struggles to climb out from beneath them. They check out the Haunted House - an actual large multi-story building on the fairgrounds, which has been converted for this purpose. Windows are boarded up, and the exterior is painted black. Icarus doubts this little small-scale city carnival is likely to have anything really terrifying. It actually seems a little silly, given the surrounding atmosphere of chirpy loud music, colorful lights, and fairgoers with cotton candy milling around; but as soon as they enter the building, the ambiance shifts markedly. The walls must be impressively soundproofed, because they can't hear the music from in here. None of the colorful flashing lights are visible from inside - in fact, there's barely any light at all - just the flickering LED lights imitating candles or broken light bulbs. Fake spiders and stuffed dummies posing as corpses decorate the corners. As Icarus predicted, it lacks anything particularly scary, but relies mostly on jump-scares. Lights go out and when they come back on, the group is surrounded by teenaged zombies, groaning menacingly. A man with a chainsaw (actual chain removed for safety) chases after them, shrieking maniacally. A ghost girl with long, stringy black hair climbs out of a well and starts crawling in their direction. They look exactly like what you'd expect for a small-scale fairground display, but Icarus keeps reacting to the damn spookies. Every time some idiot employee in a scary mask jumps out at him, or there's a scream a few feet to his side, or the floor shakes or whatever, Icarus reliably freaks out and makes an embarrassing squeal and jumps eight feet. The only redeeming thing about it is that Helios and Apollo are equally as affected, though they try hard to act like they're not. They cover up by clinging to Icarus and pretending they're protecting him from all the employees pretending to be monsters. \"It's just - it's just cheap,\" Apollo grits out, gripping Icarus' hand not quite hard enough to crush bone, but pretty close. \"Hermes would wipe the floor with these fake, cheap scares.\" \"Yeah, seriously,\" Helios says, muffled, from where he's clinging to Icarus koala-style and burying his face in Icarus' neck. Icarus wishes he could enjoy this more but currently he's trying to keep himself from shrieking every time a zombie grabs at him from behind barred doors in the darkened hallways. When they finally find the exit and step out, blinking in the bright sunlight, they don't let go of his hands right away and Icarus doesn't do anything about it, trying to be nonchalant. There's only one dark spot on the day: they're wandering around, looking for things they haven't done yet, when suddenly Icarus is distracted by a whoosh and a chorus of shrieks. He turns to look; the carriage in Lucifer's Drop has fallen and is slowly rising again. The ride looks about four stories high - not that high, in the grand scheme of things, but it's enough to give Icarus chills. The people cling to the safety bar as it raises them slowly into the air. How high is four stories? Depends, doesn't it? This ride looks about 60 feet.... Maybe it's more than four stories. Five or even six. The carriage drops, a completely real-time fall through the air. The passengers scream; it stops just a few feet from the bottom. (a few feet from the surface of the ocean, he still is still completely aware, still horrified by the falling, he experiences every agonizing moment; then he's hitting the ocean, hard enough to be stunned by the impact, hard enough to break bones, and driving through it. the water surrounds him on all sides, nothing but water as far as his vision goes, no land, no boats. he sees the sun overhead - not the gods he was striving to reach, but the impersonal burning orb that melted his wings. he chokes on water as it drags him down; water everywhere, covering his face, filling his lungs. before he goes underwater the final time, he frantically looks in the sky for his father but doesn't see him. he never sees his father again. he sees the burning circle of the sun right to the end before it all goes dark. the last thing he thinks he hears is laughter.) Icarus doesn't realize he's drifted to a stop and is staring at Lucifer's Drop, until the ride is over and the passengers are unloading from the carriage and he blinks, startled, as though awakening. He looks around, a bit disoriented, until his vision lands on Helios, who is watching him and grinning. \"What's this, Mop-Head?! You weren't scared of heights in the good old dayyyaaACK!!\" The squawk at the end is the result of Apollo swiftly catching Helios in a none-too-gentle headlock, appearing to crush the Titan's windpipe with his elbow. \"We are deeply sorry the tragic death of your previous incarnation gave you acrophobia,\" the god says, smoothly contrite and tranquil, even as Helios kicks and struggles in his headlock. The whole thing makes Icarus feel uneasy. How much of that is a memory, versus his imagination? Not just the terror of falling - frankly, acrophobia is only a third of it. There's the drowning, as well; the terrible burning in his lungs and being unable to move his broken limbs, weighted by heavy wings. And then there's the residual heartbreak and anger over being utterly abandoned by the gods who had promised him happiness - gods who laughed as he fell and died. The same gods standing before him now... how much of the figures he sees before him, are the same as the indifferent beings of his nightmare/memory? Helios still thinks his fear of heights is a joke. Apollo just keeps that impassively perfect expression on his face... have they really changed much at all? They're arguing, currently: \"Upstart little shit! You probably gave me a bruise!\" \"You were being disrespectful to Icarus.\" \"No, I just - forgot. I wouldn't have... fuck.\" Helios looks genuinely abashed, kicking the dirt and shoving his hands in his pockets, looking angry and embarrassed and guilty. \"Shit. Mop-Head, I didn't mean to be a dick about it...\" Icarus is still feeling unbalanced and doesn't want to talk about this. \"It's...\" How is he going to finish this sentence? 'Fine? Not a big deal? I know you didn't mean it like that?' None of those are really true, and as the god of truth, Apollo would know a lie the instant he heard it. \"...It all happened a long time ago. No use in dwelling on it.\" This is true enough, though Apollo cuts him a look. Icarus rubs his arm, feeling awkward and anxious. He jumps, startled, when Apollo abruptly hooks his arm under his elbow and starts gently tugging him along (he drags Helios along far less gently by the scruff of the neck). \"Apollo, what the hell?!\" Helios complains. \"I already said I was sorry!\" \"Yes, I know. But I'm seeing an excellent new distraction for us to try out.\" ---------- The distraction Apollo has in mind, apparently, is the 5k inflatable obstacle course. It winds around and curves to take up approximately the space of a football field, containing what has to be dozens of inflatable tunnels, pits, little forests of inflatable posts, and other obstacles. Icarus doesn't do 5ks. He doesn't run, and he has never done this kind of obstacle course, and he's harboring enormous doubts about trying for the first time with two individuals who have, well, the bodies of gods. It turns out to be fun. The course is not particularly designed with real athletes in mind - there are moms with their kids; old people; overweight people; and guys like Icarus who are just uncoordinated and lazy in general. The inflated obstacles are brightly colored and silly and nonthreatening, turning a 5k into a lighthearted play session, and improves Icarus' mood greatly. Helios and Apollo are capable of breezing through the obstacles much more quickly than Icarus can, so they increase the challenge by turning it into a game of keep-away with Icarus as the prize, ignoring his protestations. Helios does a fireman's carry through the forest of inflatable posts. Apollo intercepts and sprints across the mattress run with Icarus in his arms, bridal-style. Helios snags Icarus back and flings him up and over the high wall, where Icarus smacks into a cluster of soft wrecking balls swinging on ropes on the other side. He's getting to his feet, wobbily, and sternly puts his hand out to the approaching gods. \"Hey! Both of you, knock it off! I wanna try to get through this myself!\" \"You're too slow,\" Helios complains, and Apollo puts a hand to his shoulder. Helios and Icarus both are expecting Apollo to lecture Helios but he surprises them: \"Icarus is quite slow, I agree. Let's try this compromise. We'll give you a one-minute head start, and then we'll come after you.\" Helios cackles and starts rubbing his hands together in anticipation. \"Ye-e-e-esssss, Apollo, sometimes you come up with some excellent ideas.\" Icarus' eyes widen in alarm. \"Come after me?! And do what??\" \"'Something',\" Helios replies. \"You're eight seconds into your head start, Icarus,\" Apollo informs him casually. \"W-wait! I didn't agree-!\" \"Twelve seconds.\" The gods both look positively predatory. Icarus turns and bolts. Or he tries to, at least - he stumbles through the rest of the wrecking balls, and next has to try to cross a bouncy floor. He's halfway through a zig-zagging tunnel when he hears Helios hollering: \"Time's up, Mop-Head! WE'RE COMING FOR YOU!!\" Icarus curses and drags himself through the tunnel as rapidly as he can, feeling that buildup of panicky excitement at being pursued. He next tries his luck with the 'catapault' - jumping on a springboard to try to reach an elevated platform, which would allow him to bypass a maze of 8-foot inflatable walls, in a sunken floor. No luck. He bounces off the platform and lands harmlessly on the soft floor, but now has to try to navigate the maze, which is full of twists and dead ends that lose him time. Behind him, he can hear the gods calling out, letting him know how much closer they're getting, mocking him. They're dragging it out to be suspenseful, he knows; they could have already caught him if they wanted to. He's caught between annoyance and gratitude that they're at least letting him try - plus, if they're really limiting themselves to human capabilities, then there's actually a chance he might win. If they don't cheat. He slides down another wall, landing on a wobbly suspended bridge over another foam pit, with wind cannons blowing him off-balance. He manages to make it all the way across that one, but only barely - at the last couple steps, the bridge wobbles violently, and he stumbles off onto the platform. He whips his head around and realizes Apollo and Helios are right there, jiggling the bridge on the far end to try to jostle him off. \"You're running out of time, Icarus!\" Apollo can look really menacing when he wants to. But the bridge was the second-to-last obstacle! If he hurries and doesn't mess up, Icarus can really make it to the end-! The last obstacle is easy, too: a large, open pit filled as high as Icarus' waist with plastic balls. He wades through with little difficulty, eyes fixed on the final platform with the flag on it - -and then, abruptly, he puts his foot out and there's nothing beneath the balls! He falls hard, face-down, arms pinwheeling wildly, and sinks down beneath the balls. The plastic balls cushion his fall and he realizes that there was a deeper dropoff pit here, filled with more of the balls, hidden from view on the top. Damn it! He senses someone diving into the deeper pit next to him and then he's being grabbed and hoisted into the air. Apollo holds him aloft in a victory pose and shouts, \"NIKE!\" Helios tackles them both. \"DOUBLE NIKE!\" The three of them tumble into the chest-high pit of plastic balls and what can Icarus do but laugh about it, these two cheating idiots, as they start claiming their \"victory spoils\" of kisses and hugs and tickles and sneaky tweaks to his ass while he pretends to protest. They wade through to the finish line, where a puzzled- (and familiar-) looking kitten is watching them. \"Ah - Nike. My apologies. We didn't mean to summon you,\" Apollo says to it, lifting it and giving it to Icarus. \"We were only gloating over our unchallenged victory over Icarus.\" \"It's hard to get too excited about the victory when our quarry was so damned slow,\" Helios complains. \"And clumsy besides.\" \"Yeah, well, I'm real sorry about that,\" Icarus deadpans, with no heat in his voice, as Nike the cat rubs her face into his chin. \"Listen, Nike, we're going to pick up my fish now and you can't eat him.\" She mews and doesn't commit, one way or another. They retrieve the stack of plushies from the holding area and head back to the fish booth. The gods are already squabbling about something else, but Icarus tunes them out. He's smiling to himself as he strokes her back, thinking of the souvenirs he'll have, and happy of it - in spite of himself, he does admit it's a day he wants to remember.",

      "Icarus gets obsessed with trying to win a pet betta fish: he tries repeatedly to toss a ping pong into an empty fish bowl, which shouldn't be hard!",
      "But every time he's sure he's lined up the shot right, the wind will blow, or someone will startle him with a loud noise.",
      "Eventually, sharp-eyed Apollo leans into him, way too close, pressing his chest to Icarus' back, and taking his wrist, murmuring tips into his ear, and guiding the ping pong ball easily into the bowl.",
      "The girl running the game is blushing as hard as Icarus when she gives him a ticket and tells him to get the fish when they're ready to go.",
      "Icarus decides after that, it's time to move on from the games.",
      "----------- They head over to the rides.",
      "This starts out fun enough - the 'bobsled' ride is fun; the 'scrambler' ride is fun; the 'madhouse' ride - with the illusion of movement - is delightful.",
      "They try out the devil's wheel: a fast-spinning plate designed to use centrifugal forces to fling the riders off into a foam pit.",
      "Icarus almost immediately starts to be dragged off the edge, until the gods drape themselves on top of him, holding him in place.",
      "They seem more than a little delighted with the arrangement, and don't immediately climb off of him when the ride stops, waiting until Icarus finally laughs and struggles to climb out from beneath them.",
      "They check out the Haunted House - an actual large multi-story building on the fairgrounds, which has been converted for this purpose.",
      "Windows are boarded up, and the exterior is painted black.",
      "Icarus doubts this little small-scale city carnival is likely to have anything really terrifying.",
      "It actually seems a little silly, given the surrounding atmosphere of chirpy loud music, colorful lights, and fairgoers with cotton candy milling around; but as soon as they enter the building, the ambiance shifts markedly.",
      "The walls must be impressively soundproofed, because they can't hear the music from in here.",
      "None of the colorful flashing lights are visible from inside - in fact, there's barely any light at all - just the flickering LED lights imitating candles or broken light bulbs.",
      "Fake spiders and stuffed dummies posing as corpses decorate the corners.",
      "As Icarus predicted, it lacks anything particularly scary, but relies mostly on jump-scares.",
      "Lights go out and when they come back on, the group is surrounded by teenaged zombies, groaning menacingly.",
      "A man with a chainsaw (actual chain removed for safety) chases after them, shrieking maniacally.",
      "A ghost girl with long, stringy black hair climbs out of a well and starts crawling in their direction.",
      "They look exactly like what you'd expect for a small-scale fairground display, but Icarus keeps reacting to the damn spookies.",
      "Every time some idiot employee in a scary mask jumps out at him, or there's a scream a few feet to his side, or the floor shakes or whatever, Icarus reliably freaks out and makes an embarrassing squeal and jumps eight feet.",
      "The only redeeming thing about it is that Helios and Apollo are equally as affected, though they try hard to act like they're not.",
      "They cover up by clinging to Icarus and pretending they're protecting him from all the employees pretending to be monsters.",
      "\"It's just - it's just cheap,\" Apollo grits out, gripping Icarus' hand not quite hard enough to crush bone, but pretty close.",
      "\"Hermes would wipe the floor with these fake, cheap scares.\"",
      "\"Yeah, seriously,\" Helios says, muffled, from where he's clinging to Icarus koala-style and burying his face in Icarus' neck.",
      "Icarus wishes he could enjoy this more but currently he's trying to keep himself from shrieking every time a zombie grabs at him from behind barred doors in the darkened hallways.",
      "When they finally find the exit and step out, blinking in the bright sunlight, they don't let go of his hands right away and Icarus doesn't do anything about it, trying to be nonchalant.",
      "There's only one dark spot on the day: they're wandering around, looking for things they haven't done yet, when suddenly Icarus is distracted by a whoosh and a chorus of shrieks.",
      "He turns to look; the carriage in Lucifer's Drop has fallen and is slowly rising again.",
      "The ride looks about four stories high - not that high, in the grand scheme of things, but it's enough to give Icarus chills.",
      "The people cling to the safety bar as it raises them slowly into the air.",
      "How high is four stories?",
      "Depends, doesn't it?",
      "This ride looks about 60 feet....",
      "Maybe it's more than four stories.",
      "Five or even six.",
      "The carriage drops, a completely real-time fall through the air.",
      "The passengers scream; it stops just a few feet from the bottom.",
      "(a few feet from the surface of the ocean, he still is still completely aware, still horrified by the falling, he experiences every agonizing moment; then he's hitting the ocean, hard enough to be stunned by the impact, hard enough to break bones, and driving through it.",
      "the water surrounds him on all sides, nothing but water as far as his vision goes, no land, no boats.",
      "he sees the sun overhead - not the gods he was striving to reach, but the impersonal burning orb that melted his wings.",
      "he chokes on water as it drags him down; water everywhere, covering his face, filling his lungs.",
      "before he goes underwater the final time, he frantically looks in the sky for his father but doesn't see him.",
      "he never sees his father again.",
      "he sees the burning circle of the sun right to the end before it all goes dark.",
      "the last thing he thinks he hears is laughter.)",
      "Icarus doesn't realize he's drifted to a stop and is staring at Lucifer's Drop, until the ride is over and the passengers are unloading from the carriage and he blinks, startled, as though awakening.",
      "He looks around, a bit disoriented, until his vision lands on Helios, who is watching him and grinning.",
      "\"What's this, Mop-Head?!",
      "You weren't scared of heights in the good old dayyyaaACK!!\"",
      "The squawk at the end is the result of Apollo swiftly catching Helios in a none-too-gentle headlock, appearing to crush the Titan's windpipe with his elbow.",
      "\"We are deeply sorry the tragic death of your previous incarnation gave you acrophobia,\" the god says, smoothly contrite and tranquil, even as Helios kicks and struggles in his headlock.",
      "The whole thing makes Icarus feel uneasy.",
      "How much of that is a memory, versus his imagination?",
      "Not just the terror of falling - frankly, acrophobia is only a third of it.",
      "There's the drowning, as well; the terrible burning in his lungs and being unable to move his broken limbs, weighted by heavy wings.",
      "And then there's the residual heartbreak and anger over being utterly abandoned by the gods who had promised him happiness - gods who laughed as he fell and died.",
      "The same gods standing before him now...",
      "how much of the figures he sees before him, are the same as the indifferent beings of his nightmare/memory?",
      "Helios still thinks his fear of heights is a joke.",
      "Apollo just keeps that impassively perfect expression on his face... have they really changed much at all?",
      "They're arguing, currently: \"Upstart little shit!",
      "You probably gave me a bruise!\"",
      "\"You were being disrespectful to Icarus.\"",
      "\"No, I just - forgot.",
      "I wouldn't have... fuck.\"",
      "Helios looks genuinely abashed, kicking the dirt and shoving his hands in his pockets, looking angry and embarrassed and guilty.",
      "\"Shit. Mop-Head, I didn't mean to be a dick about it...\" Icarus is still feeling unbalanced and doesn't want to talk about this.",
      "\"It's...\" How is he going to finish this sentence? 'Fine?",
      "Not a big deal?",
      "I know you didn't mean it like that?'",
      "None of those are really true, and as the god of truth, Apollo would know a lie the instant he heard it.",
      "\"...It all happened a long time ago.",
      "No use in dwelling on it.\"",
      "This is true enough, though Apollo cuts him a look.",
      "Icarus rubs his arm, feeling awkward and anxious.",
      "He jumps, startled, when Apollo abruptly hooks his arm under his elbow and starts gently tugging him along (he drags Helios along far less gently by the scruff of the neck).",
      "\"Apollo, what the hell?!\"",
      "Helios complains.",
      "\"I already said I was sorry!\"",
      "\"Yes, I know.",
      "But I'm seeing an excellent new distraction for us to try out.\"",
      "---------- The distraction Apollo has in mind, apparently, is the 5k inflatable obstacle course.",
      "It winds around and curves to take up approximately the space of a football field, containing what has to be dozens of inflatable tunnels, pits, little forests of inflatable posts, and other obstacles.",
      "Icarus doesn't do 5ks.",
      "He doesn't run, and he has never done this kind of obstacle course, and he's harboring enormous doubts about trying for the first time with two individuals who have, well, the bodies of gods.",
      "It turns out to be fun.",
      "The course is not particularly designed with real athletes in mind - there are moms with their kids; old people; overweight people; and guys like Icarus who are just uncoordinated and lazy in general.",
      "The inflated obstacles are brightly colored and silly and nonthreatening, turning a 5k into a lighthearted play session, and improves Icarus' mood greatly.",
      "Helios and Apollo are capable of breezing through the obstacles much more quickly than Icarus can, so they increase the challenge by turning it into a game of keep-away with Icarus as the prize, ignoring his protestations.",
      "Helios does a fireman's carry through the forest of inflatable posts.",
      "Apollo intercepts and sprints across the mattress run with Icarus in his arms, bridal-style.",
      "Helios snags Icarus back and flings him up and over the high wall, where Icarus smacks into a cluster of soft wrecking balls swinging on ropes on the other side.",
      "He's getting to his feet, wobbily, and sternly puts his hand out to the approaching gods.",
      "\"Hey!",
      "Both of you, knock it off!",
      "I wanna try to get through this myself!\"",
      "\"You're too slow,\" Helios complains, and Apollo puts a hand to his shoulder.",
      "Helios and Icarus both are expecting Apollo to lecture Helios but he surprises them: \"Icarus is quite slow, I agree.",
      "Let's try this compromise.",
      "We'll give you a one-minute head start, and then we'll come after you.\"",
      "Helios cackles and starts rubbing his hands together in anticipation.",
      "\"Ye-e-e-esssss, Apollo, sometimes you come up with some excellent ideas.\"",
      "Icarus' eyes widen in alarm.",
      "\"Come after me?!",
      "And do what??\" \"'Something',\" Helios replies.",
      "\"You're eight seconds into your head start, Icarus,\" Apollo informs him casually.",
      "\"W-wait!",
      "I didn't agree-!\"",
      "\"Twelve seconds.\"",
      "The gods both look positively predatory.",
      "Icarus turns and bolts.",
      "Or he tries to, at least - he stumbles through the rest of the wrecking balls, and next has to try to cross a bouncy floor.",
      "He's halfway through a zig-zagging tunnel when he hears Helios hollering: \"Time's up, Mop-Head!",
      "WE'RE COMING FOR YOU!!\"",
      "Icarus curses and drags himself through the tunnel as rapidly as he can, feeling that buildup of panicky excitement at being pursued.",
      "He next tries his luck with the 'catapault' - jumping on a springboard to try to reach an elevated platform, which would allow him to bypass a maze of 8-foot inflatable walls, in a sunken floor.",
      "No luck.",
      "He bounces off the platform and lands harmlessly on the soft floor, but now has to try to navigate the maze, which is full of twists and dead ends that lose him time.",
      "Behind him, he can hear the gods calling out, letting him know how much closer they're getting, mocking him.",
      "They're dragging it out to be suspenseful, he knows; they could have already caught him if they wanted to.",
      "He's caught between annoyance and gratitude that they're at least letting him try - plus, if they're really limiting themselves to human capabilities, then there's actually a chance he might win.",
      "If they don't cheat.",
      "He slides down another wall, landing on a wobbly suspended bridge over another foam pit, with wind cannons blowing him off-balance.",
      "He manages to make it all the way across that one, but only barely - at the last couple steps, the bridge wobbles violently, and he stumbles off onto the platform.",
      "He whips his head around and realizes Apollo and Helios are right there, jiggling the bridge on the far end to try to jostle him off.",
      "\"You're running out of time, Icarus!\"",
      "Apollo can look really menacing when he wants to.",
      "But the bridge was the second-to-last obstacle!",
      "If he hurries and doesn't mess up, Icarus can really make it to the end-!",
      "The last obstacle is easy, too: a large, open pit filled as high as Icarus' waist with plastic balls.",
      "He wades through with little difficulty, eyes fixed on the final platform with the flag on it - -and then, abruptly, he puts his foot out and there's nothing beneath the balls!",
      "He falls hard, face-down, arms pinwheeling wildly, and sinks down beneath the balls.",
      "The plastic balls cushion his fall and he realizes that there was a deeper dropoff pit here, filled with more of the balls, hidden from view on the top.",
      "Damn it!",
      "He senses someone diving into the deeper pit next to him and then he's being grabbed and hoisted into the air.",
      "Apollo holds him aloft in a victory pose and shouts, \"NIKE!\"",
      "Helios tackles them both.",
      "\"DOUBLE NIKE!\"",
      "The three of them tumble into the chest-high pit of plastic balls and what can Icarus do but laugh about it, these two cheating idiots, as they start claiming their \"victory spoils\" of kisses and hugs and tickles and sneaky tweaks to his ass while he pretends to protest.",
      "They wade through to the finish line, where a puzzled- (and familiar-) looking kitten is watching them.",
      "\"Ah - Nike.",
      "My apologies.",
      "We didn't mean to summon you,\" Apollo says to it, lifting it and giving it to Icarus.",
      "\"We were only gloating over our unchallenged victory over Icarus.\"",
      "\"It's hard to get too excited about the victory when our quarry was so damned slow,\" Helios complains.",
      "\"And clumsy besides.\"",
      "\"Yeah, well, I'm real sorry about that,\" Icarus deadpans, with no heat in his voice, as Nike the cat rubs her face into his chin.",
      "\"Listen, Nike, we're going to pick up my fish now and you can't eat him.\"",
      "She mews and doesn't commit, one way or another.",
      "They retrieve the stack of plushies from the holding area and head back to the fish booth.",
      "The gods are already squabbling about something else, but Icarus tunes them out.",
      "He's smiling to himself as he strokes her back, thinking of the souvenirs he'll have, and happy of it - in spite of himself, he does admit it's a day he wants to remember."

    "text": "It's impossible not to be aware of the event, even if one wasn't in a weird live-in situation with two sun gods. All over the news and social media, there is constant talk of the solar eclipse. People make jokes about not buying mysterious plants, or make plans to invade the Fire Nation. They share instructions for creating pinhole cameras and seek out friends living in the path of totality, so they can stay there to see the moon completely eclipse the sun. At the observatory where Icarus volunteers, there is a planned field trip for employees who can afford to pay, to spend a few days in Oregon before and after the eclipse. They'll be going to watch it via one of the local observatory's powerful telescopes, recording data about the sun's corona that will only be visible during this eclipse, and otherwise having a great time. Icarus can't afford it, so he stays behind. He wonders - obviously - what Apollo and Helios will be doing during this time. He still can't quite get used to the concept that they're gods of the sun, and he is a little curious about how it works. Their story is pretty consistent: they drive the sun-chariot across the sky. Duh. But it doesn't make sense! How does that explain the science?! The earth is spherical! The sun doesn't go anywhere, the earth revolves around it! The sun isn't two attractive guys, it's a huge ball of gas! Every so often he raises these points, indignant and irritated, and they laugh at him and tell him he's adorable when he's mad. Sometimes they'll wave their hands dismissively and say \"it's the metaphysical sky, obviously,\" which isn't obvious at all. On the subject of the eclipse, though, they are tight-lipped and visibly grouchy about it, which makes Icarus shy away from asking about an obviously huge event. He gets an idea of the state of their minds when the moon shows up in his apartment - or, one of them, at least. Icarus is resigned by now to seeing random beautiful, statuesque people (with occasional inhuman features) turn up in his life. It does annoy him that they turn up inside his home, though he doesn't think it'd be smart to say so. But it takes him a moment to even realize there is a new god in his apartment - at first, he walks in and believes he's looking at a genderbent Apollo, who's decided to dress like a Tough Girl and is sprawled inelegantly over his couch. He's staring, trying to think of what possible discreet way he can ask \"what the fuck?!\" when Lady-Apollo sits up, grinning widely. \"This is him! The lil guy you've got such a huge crush on!\" With these bewildering words, Lady-Apollo hops off the couch and strides over to catch him up in a huge bear hug. Icarus is still blinking in shock when a second Apollo pokes his head out from the kitchen. \"Icarus. Meet my sister, Artemis, the moon.\" This Apollo is still male and is wearing a sour expression. And of course he remembers now - the twin sister, Artemis. The differences are obvious now that he realizes. Artemis is slightly shorter and her features are highlighted in silvery blue, rather than gold. But other than that, the resemblance is striking. Icarus looks back and forth from one face to the other. \"Wow, you two look - wow.\" He catches himself. \"Uh, that is... pleased to meet you, Artemis...\" He fumbles awkwardly as he seeks to extricate himself from her hug without putting his hands to her waist or worse. When Artemis laughs, it's loud and full - nothing like Apollo. \"Haha! What a cutie! Look at that grouchy face, I love it! Aww, haha, he's blushing!! 'Pollo, I gotta say, you really know how to pick 'em.\" \"Good taste has always been among my excellent qualities,\" Apollo agrees, coming into the living room. \"You gotta bring him by the Grove sometime. Seriously. Leeny would eat him alive. Heheh, maybe I would too, for that matter.\" \"I don't 'gotta' do anything, Artemis.\" In spite of his wet-blanket approach to the conversation, Apollo is watching Icarus with amusement. Icarus can't stop the blush from spreading. He's never this - touchy-feely, and double-never with a woman. He has no idea what to do with his hands or what he's supposed to say. \"A-artemis, aren't you... I mean...\" he realizes what he's nearly asking and almost chokes on the words, blush intensifying. Artemis almost doubles over in laughter, which puts her breasts in dangerous proximity to his face. \"Oh. Mygod. Apollo. This kid!\" She abruptly scoops up Icarus, bridal style, and leers at him. \"A virgin, were you gonna ask? Never known a man's touch? That makes us about even, doesn't it? Whaddaya say, 'Pollo, twins share everything, right?\" \"She's fucking with you, Icarus, feel free to punch her if you'd like,\" Apollo is smirking though, entertained with Icarus' awkwardness. \"Oh, I wouldn't - I mean - uh - \" Icarus wants to die of embarrassment. Both twins laugh at him, and Artemis squeezes his knee before setting him back down. \"Relax, kiddo, sheesh. I'm just messing around. Ugh, you're fucking cute. Bet you got this dweeb wrapped around your little finger, don'tcha?\" she gives Apollo a solid thump on the back, making the god wince. She's almost definitely more muscular than Apollo is - or maybe it just seems that way, because she's wearing clothes that are designed to show them off. She really does have impressive arms for sure, and her crop top reveals abs that look like they're chiseled from cement. \"Well, he keeps coming back, so I guess I must?\" That sets her off again. \"Yeah, that's one sign,\" she says, mussing his hair. \"You gonna watch me show him up at the eclipse??\" \"Oh... uh... probably I'll see if I can watch it from here, but we'd only see the partial eclipse. I couldn't make it to the line of totality.\" Artemis gives Apollo a disapproving look. \"You're not gonna take him someplace nice to watch the show, bro?\" Apollo folds his arms and returns the disapproval. \"I'll take him to see things worth seeing - not some two-bit clown show.\" \"Sounds to me like someone's worried about getting shown up, again.\" \"'Shown up?' By a pair of noisy drunk idiots driving an outlandish chariot and carrying on like barbarians?\" \"People like flashy! That's why no one cares about lunar eclipses!\" \"People only like solar eclipses because they're so rare, Moony!\" \"No one likes a sore loser, A-dull-o!\" Icarus can't quite tell if this is normal sibling squabbling - he suspects it is, given the level of childishness it's provoked from Apollo (which is objectively hilarious). But even if it's harmless by their standards, Icarus still worries about the state of his apartment. There's still no such thing as insurance for god-levels of destruction to property. He rushes into the kitchen, pours two glasses and hurries back out to thrust them at the bickering gods. \"Lemonade?\" he offers awkwardly as they stare at him. \"Uh - it's - frozen concentrate,\" he adds, not sure why he's volunteering this information, \"and I'd like it if you could drink this instead of fighting.\" Artemis looks like she wants to laugh and crush him into another bear hug, but she manages to contain herself and accepts the lemonade. \"Okay, kiddo, thanks. What a precious little diplomat.\" \"He's had practice,\" Apollo acknowledges grudgingly, accepting the drink as well. \"Helios tends to start arguments a lot.\" Artemis' eyes crinkle as she sips the cheap lemonade. \"Oh, I'm sure Helios does,\" she says, winking at Icarus. Apollo pretends not to notice. The conversation is more civil after that. Artemis and Apollo entertain Icarus with embarrassing or stupid stories about each other, from when they were young gods. \"...And then Hermes farted at him,\" Artemis recalls fondly. \"I wasn't there when Apollo went complaining to Zeus, but from what I heard, Zeus actually had tears in his eyes from laughing. Can't believe how fast Hermes got the King on his side.\" \"Yes, Hermes has always been the master of charm,\" Apollo sniffs. \"Don't let him fool you. Those two are best friends. Hermes still calls him Big Brother sometimes.\" The eclipse isn't mentioned again. In the interest of his health and the well-being of his apartment, Icarus is relieved. But as a guy who really, really wanted to see the eclipse... it's a pretty big disappointment. -------------- The day of the eclipse, a few hours before it's supposed to start, Icarus is in the library reading when he feels a tap at his shoulder. Athena smiles down at him. \"So here you are! You weren't with the sun idiots, so I guessed I'd find you here.\" Icarus smiles back up at her, though a little weakly. \"Y-yeah. Just... had some time to kill before the eclipse.\" \"Ah, yes, that's today...\" Artemis rolls her eyes. \"The trash-talking has reached fever pitch in Olympus. I'll be glad when it's over. Of course, then we only get a reprieve of about a year and a half.\" \"I really wanted to see the totality,\" he blurts out. \"So many of my friends traveled to where they could see it, but I couldn't afford the trip. The next time I can see it won't be for almost seven years!\" His face reddens a little at how whiny he must sound, but Athena only smiles. \"So that's why you seem a little down,\" she observes kindly. \"Icarus, how silly. I can take you anywhere in the path of totality to watch, if you'd like.\" Icarus is embarrassed at his transparency. \"I... I didn't think it was right to ask...\" \"Nonsense. It's no hardship at all. I haven't been to see it in a few centuries myself so it might be interesting on its own... Hmm.\" She considers. \"Go and get yourself ready, if you need anything. I'll ask around and see if anyone else is planning to watch the show this year. I'll come and get you in an hour.\" Icarus nods eagerly and rushes off to his apartment, throwing together his Canadian Space Agency-approved eclipse glasses and some sunscreen, just in case, some peanut butter crackers, and a bottle of water. He wonders if he should bring anything else - he doesn't have a camera that can take a photo of the sun, which is too bad... maybe he should bring a sweater? Yes, it's midday in summer, but he has no idea where Athena would end up going - could be a mountaintop in Colorado for all he knows - but she's a lot more sensible than the sun gods, she ought to know to warn him. It isn't until he's sitting on his front porch waiting, that he remembers that she said she was going to see if anyone else was going to be watching. \"Anyone else\" presumably meaning more gods. Shit. ----- Athena pulls her red VW convertible over to Icarus' building, and spots him sitting on the steps. She beeps the horn and waves at him, bringing him hurrying over. She's a little surprised to see he looks nervous, but she recalls that he described a terrifying ride in Helios' chariot one time. That must be it. Well, he'll soon see that some gods know how to drive their chariots smartly and responsibly. She smiles reassuringly at him. \"All right, we've got our afternoon planned! Heph - that is, Hephaestus, and his wife will be watching, along with another friend,\" she tells him cheerfully, pulling back into traffic and guiding her chariot towards her pre-selected teleportation location. Unexpectedly, Icarus looks even more nervous. \"Ahh, okay... um, all right, so Hephaestus - he's the god of the forge, right, and -\" Icarus pauses. Aha. So, not worried about the chariot, but worried about meeting new gods. She supposes they do have a reputation for easily taking offense. \"Uh, his wife - is that - Aphrodite?\" he asks hesitantly. \"Oh, goodness, no! That was a long time ago. I'd better summarize. Heph was married to Aphrodite, but - they divorced. It was unpleasant, to say the least. That was quite a long time ago, though, and they're on good terms now. He remarried to one of the Graces, Aglaia. She's completely lovely, you'll like her.\" \"Are there any other topics I shouldn't bring up?\" Icarus asks anxiously. \"Don't worry about it so much,\" she assures him. \"Hephaestus is quite laid-back, and I'm sure you'll find plenty of other topics to talk about than old myths. He's bringing some of his gadgets along, and he'll be excited to show them off. Plus, Aglaia is a delight to have around; she'll certainly make conversation easy.\" \"O-okay.. well, what about the other guy? Your friend?\" \"Ah - Horme. He's more of a co-worker - an associate of mine. He's a minor god, of the spirit of energy and motivation. The 'can-do' spirit, if you will. He had a shrine within my temples, back in the old days. And you'll be happy to hear that he is well-known for staying out of trouble and generally getting along with everyone.\" Athena's being slightly evasive here, but luckily, it's at this moment that she enters the portal, and Icarus is only half-listening. She smiles and lets the conversation trail off as he gapes with naked amazement at the splash of stars in the Space Between Worlds. She doesn't realize he's been holding his breath until he lets it out in a huff and quickly puts his hands to his throat. \"I... I can breathe here?\" he asks, sounding dazed. The answer is obvious - he can, and he is - but she answers the implied question of how anyway. \"Yes, you're within my aegis. Any goddess or god who travels with you outside of the mortal realm would do the same. Assuming they want you alive, that is,\" she adds, for the sake of being precise. \"Ah.\" Icarus falls silent and watches the constellations go by like a hall in an art museum: she points out Auriga, \"my adopted son, Erichthonius,\" but otherwise is content to watch the amazement in his eyes. She really does have a soft spot for mortals with a thirst for knowledge over heroism. Eventually, she pulls out of the Space and through another portal, onto a highway with a significantly different ecosystem than the one they left - great plains with mountains in the distance. Icarus sits up, looking around. \"Oh - where are we? I thought we'd be watching them in space?\" \"We're in central Wyoming,\" she informs him, navigating to the prearranged location - a public park in a small nearby town. \"You may have the opportunity to see the eclipse up close later, but our company - myself included - prefers not to get too close when these events occur.\" If Icarus has more questions, he doesn't ask. She parks her chariot and he follows her as they walk past small crowds of people, who are all excitedly talking. She overhears more than one conversation expressing astonishment that the weather cleared unexpectedly; apparently there was supposed to be stormy weather today but it never materialized, which has allowed the local population the luxury of watching the eclipse without too many out-of-town tourists. She leads Icarus over to a stand of pine trees. Near these trees, three individuals are set up on a blanket. \"Good morning, everyone,\" she greets them all. \"I'm glad to see we've all made it! This is Icarus, the boy that Helios and Apollo are infatuated with; you've heard of him, I believe.\" Icarus' cheeks color charmingly and he politely shakes everyone's hand, which amuses the gods. \"This is Hephaestus, one of my brothers, and my oldest and closest peer. His wife Aglaia, the Grace of glory and beauty. And here is Horme, the spirit of effort and eagerness.\" Hephaestus is wearing a t-shirt featuring humans pointing at an eclipse, with the words \"It Blinded Me With Science\" printed on it. Horme is wearing one that, inexplicably, features a chicken wearing eclipse glasses and no explanatory remarks. Icarus grins upon seeing Hephaestus' shirt. \"That's cool.\" Hephaestus grins back. \"I got it from the stand over there. They're only ten dollars if you want one yourself.\" \"Did you get yours from the same stand, Horme?\" Athena asks, quirking her lips. \"Nope. This one's a one-of-a-kind.\" \"I'm not surprised. And I don't even need to ask if you got your necklace from around here, Aglaia.\" The Grace laughs. She's declined to wear a humorous t-shirt, and instead is wearing one of her typical outfits - effortlessly elegant but casual, and has a beautiful necklace wrought of silver, in the shape of the diamond ring effect of an eclipse. \"No, of course, my talented husband created this for me, to wear for the occasion.\" \"It's beautiful,\" Athena, Icarus, and Horme all say in unison, making Aglaia and Hephaestus both laugh and blush. It's a lovely day. The park has a band playing live music; there are food trucks selling snacks and fried meals (Icarus goes back twice for strawberry shortcake); and enterprising locals are selling t-shirts and running games. As Athena had expected, Icarus is extremely excited when shown Hephaestus' new gadget - it's a telescope of a kind of power that should not normally be possible in something so small, and it has a time-lapse camera attachment as well. Icarus is beside himself asking questions about how it works, what measurements he's taking, and whether the technology is reproducible for mortals. Athena, Horme and Icarus take a stroll through the park to see what there is to see and to buy snacks and a t-shirt for Icarus, and they come back to find Aglaia taking a nap in the sun while Hephaestus tinkers with his instrument one-handed. The other hand is holding one of Aglaia's while she sleeps. They hold hands a lot, as much as they did when they were young newlyweds, and it makes Athena beam to see it. The eclipse takes a little over two hours from beginning to end, and it's a joy to see Icarus' normally dour face lighting up with excitement as he peers through his glasses or the telescope to see the moon goddesses maneuver their chariot to block and defeat the sun gods. Though of course, here in the physical realm, all that manifests is an increasingly slender crescent shape in the sky. \"It seems so peaceful from down here,\" Athena remarks at one point, as the light begins to dim around them. \"Peaceful?\" Icarus asks. \"They're... pretty competitive,\" Aglaia says diplomatically. \"Oh, yeah, I guess I sort of saw... Artemis came by the other day, and she and Apollo immediately started bickering about it.\" The other three gods all groan in unison. \"All four of them have been going at it for weeks,\" Hephaestus says. \"I guess it's good they're keeping up their enthusiasm after a few thousand years, but the rest of us? Well, let's say, the novelty wears off after a while.\" Athena sniffs. \"That's why I haven't gone to see it in so long.\" \"You grouches! It's still entertaining enough... as long as you keep your distance,\" Aglaia says, giving Hephaestus a peck on the cheek. \"I heard that Zeus made a new rule that the sun gods have to wear a shirt that says 'I got mooned' the day after,\" Horme says suddenly. \"Oh really?\" Hephaestus and Aglaia have matching contemplative expressions. \"Well, that will make things interesting tomorrow,\" Hephaestus says. \"Heh, Zeus can be hilarious when he feels like it!\" Athena holds her chin in her hand thoughtfully. \"I believe I observed a young lady wearing that shirt around this very park today.\" Horme laughs. \"I guess the mortals share a sense of humor with the old man!\" Aglaia and Hephaestus laugh and scold Horme for speaking disrespectfully of their king, though neither sound concerned. Icarus hasn't answered in a while, staring around in amazement as the streetlights come on and cicadas and crickets begin calling. \"Oh wow, I think it's - ah, look! Up there!!\" They all obediently look. The crowd begins cheering as the last tiny sliver of the sun is eclipsed by the moon. Icarus and the gods are also cheering, and then there is only the ring in the sky. Icarus removes his glasses and gapes. The gods murmur in conversation to each other, and Athena carefully takes a photo of Icarus standing with a look of childlike delight on his face, with the ring hanging in the sky. The photo shows up far better than the tiny sensors ought to be able to handle. She sends it to Artemis first - she'll wait and show it to Apollo after a day or two. Then the moon moves out of the way, and the sun comes back, bright and shining. Icarus goes over immediately to check out what the telescope picked up, but keeps sneaking glances up at the slowly thickening crescent through his glasses. \"That was great,\" he says. \"It was,\" Athena agrees. \"Aesthetically pleasing and so peaceful.\" \"I can fix that!\" says a new voice, belonging to the messenger god Hermes, who pops in unexpectedly a few inches behind Icarus. Icarus startles and loses his balance, nearly falling into the pile of discarded wrappers and snacks, but is caught round the waist by Hermes. \"Artemis got your text and sent me to retrieve Icarus here, insisting that he needs to see 'the real thing,'\" Hermes informs them. \"You guys about wrapped up here? What do you say, Icarus, ready to roll out?\" \"Wh-wha...??!\" \"Yes, the totality just ended,\" Athena tells Hermes. \"Go ahead, Icarus, we can look over the telescope's readings later,\" Hephaestus encourages. Hermes tips his hat jauntily and shifts his grip on Icarus, tucking him up under one arm, and leaping into the sky. The human's bewildered yelling fades after him. The remaining four gods watch as Hermes disappears into the sky with his human parcel. \"Well, this should be educational for the boy,\" Aglaia remarks. Hephaestus laughs. \"I'm sure. I haven't dared to go back since...ah, probably sometime in the 1600s, or thereabout. Though they all ask me to make them various things to try to dominate the battle... the ladies have the most creativity there. Artemis asked for a monster truck last time; this year, Selene asked for a handmaiden to drive their chariot. I was instructed to design her to look stunningly gorgeous,\" he adds, cutting his eyes over to his wife with a shy grin. She nudges him, smiling. \"So that's why I had to come over to model? You scoundrel! Who knows what those two will do with a handmaiden that looks like me!\" Horme snickers. \"I'm sure we can all- ooph!\" Athena elbows him hard in the ribs. Aglaia rolls her eyes at him and stands up, brushing grass off her skirt. \"Let's get a lemonade and some funnel cake before we leave, Heph. Do you two want anything?\" \"No, thank you, Aglaia,\" Athena says politely. The Grace nods to them and helps her husband to his feet, then takes his arm as they walk slowly over to the food truck. Horme watches them go. \"It's nice to see a success story,\" he says, a note of wistfulness in his voice. \"I think we're all success stories,\" Athena asserts. She begins to pack up the camera and other items they've brought. \"Even those idiots in the sky - they've come a long way from the troubled, angry young gods they were.\" \"They've changed a little more recently. The sun idiots, I mean. I guess it must be because of this mortal....Icarus.\" If Horme has any thoughts on the extent or nature of the deities' evolution, he doesn't offer them. \"Huh. You know, since I've been here playing the part of Horme? Taking that role, I could actually feel the kid switch from apathy to energy almost as soon as he started watching the eclipse. He's really excited about studying the heavens.\" \"He is. But he's really more passionate about spaceflight - astrodynamics and space aviation. He wants to explore the heavens, not just look at them.\" \"Oh?\" Horme looks up at her, eyes crinkling. \"That's cute.\" \"I agree. It's very endearing how much the three of them care.\" They watch for another minute in silence as the moon moves away from the sun and the day gets brighter again. Down the field, some distance away, Hephaestus and Aglaia are eating their funnel cake together and laughing at the mess it makes. Finally Athena asks: \"Are you really going to make them wear that shirt, Father? There'll be an awful lot of complaining.\" Horme snorts and waves his hand. In the sky, storm clouds appear abruptly, beginning to roll in now that the eclipse is over, as though they'd been held back for the duration. \"They'll survive it.\" --------------- The speed of Hermes' flight is not something Icarus can fully register. After they've stopped moving, there's a confused memory of fleeting images and sensations: the earth falling away, the air around him going cold and clear, light turning into dark, and the feeling of moving fast-fast-FAST. They stop abruptly in front of a gold-colored Prius, floating in space. Hermes leans over and taps politely on the driver's side window. \"Knock knock!\" he announces cheerfully. \"Special delivery for Misters Apollo and Helios! Will you sign for this parcel?\" The window rolls down. \"What the hell are you doing here, Hermes?\" Apollo demands. \"Wait - is that Icarus?\" Icarus is holding his breath reflexively, in spite of what Athena told him about the aegis; but he lets out a yelp as Hermes jostles him playfully. \"Yup! Shipped direct, courtesy of Lady Artemis.\" \"Ugh.\" Apollo's face takes on a pained expression. \"Well don't just sit there with him dangling in space, Hermes, bring him in.\" Hermes moves, again, and Icarus finds himself sitting in the front passenger seat. Hermes himself has taken a seat behind Apollo, and is kicking the back of the seat, making Apollo's scowl deepen. \"This is fun! Wow, I haven't gotten an up close and personal seat for one of these in decades!\" \"Yeah, well, mind your P's and Q's or you won't get to sit here in the future,\" growls Helios' voice from immediately behind Icarus. The sun Titan leans forward, reaching around the seat to give Icarus' leg a squeeze. \"Sorry you had to be dragged into this, kiddo.\" \"A-are you kidding?\" Icarus is slightly embarrassed at how high and excited his voice is, and makes an effort to pitch it lower and calmer, with limited success. \"I just watched this, down in Wyoming - I wanted to watch this so bad! You guys, you know I love space, and this is a huge event!\" Both sun gods' eyes twitch at 'huge event,' but they sigh and offer Icarus a resigned smile. \"There are much better events than an eclipse,\" Apollo tells him. \"Solar flares and coronal mass ejections...\" \"Lunar eclipses!\" interjects Helios. \"Well, I wanna see them!!\" \"Oi. You guys can try to do damage control later,\" Hermes says, suppressing a smile. \"Here come the ladies!\" Icarus whips his head around and peers out the window of the Prius - as Hermes has said, they're being approached by a - \"A limousine?\" \"Must have been Selene's choice, this year,\" Apollo grumbles. A heavily remixed version of Fleetwood Mac's 'Sisters of the Moon' blares from the limo. \"Yooooooooooooo, Apollo! Helios!!! This classy enough for ya?!\" Artemis is bellowing. She's only visible from the waist up, as she's standing up out of the limo's - hah - 'sunroof', alongside the Titaness Selene. Both have bottles of champagne in hand, and are dressed in silvery evening wear - Artemis is wearing a white bolero with a crop top shell underneath, while Selene appears to be wearing a gown with a top made of lacey moon phases. They both cheer when they see Icarus sitting in the front seat. \"Icarus!!! Glad ya could make it kiddo!!\" Then the two sun gods are leaning out the window, unable to contain their competitive annoyance, and start shouting at their sisters, mostly in Greek so Icarus doesn't understand it, but he can guess from the tone that there's a lot of insults being flung around. Hermes is in the backseat laughing his ass off. The moon goddesses are jeering right back. Artemis takes out her bow and takes aim - confetti and something like silly string explode over Apollo's chariot and the limo roars off, leaving a huge cloud of foggy exhaust behind, which engulfs the chariot completely. Apollo slumps back against his seat in a huff. \"Well, at least that's over with.\" Icarus has been mute this whole time, watching with alarm and fascination at the spectacle, and turns his head to watch the moon limo peel off into space. He looks over at Apollo in delight. \"That was - incredible! Apollo, Helios - when's the next lunar eclipse?\" --------------------- The next day, Icarus wakes up to see a neatly folded t-shirt on his bedside table, with the words \"I got Mooned! - Metaphysical sky, 21 August 2017\".",

      "His face reddens a little at how whiny he must sound, but Athena only smiles.",
      "\"So that's why you seem a little down,\" she observes kindly.",
      "\"Icarus, how silly.",
      "I can take you anywhere in the path of totality to watch, if you'd like.\"",
      "Icarus is embarrassed at his transparency.",
      "\"I... I didn't think it was right to ask...\" \"Nonsense.",
      "It's no hardship at all.",
      "I haven't been to see it in a few centuries myself so it might be interesting on its own... Hmm.\"",

      "Icarus nods eagerly and rushes off to his apartment, throwing together his Canadian Space Agency-approved eclipse glasses and some sunscreen, just in case, some peanut butter crackers, and a bottle of water.",
      "He wonders if he should bring anything else - he doesn't have a camera that can take a photo of the sun, which is too bad... maybe he should bring a sweater?",
      "Yes, it's midday in summer, but he has no idea where Athena would end up going - could be a mountaintop in Colorado for all he knows - but she's a lot more sensible than the sun gods, she ought to know to warn him.",
      "It isn't until he's sitting on his front porch waiting, that he remembers that she said she was going to see if anyone else was going to be watching.",
      "\"Anyone else\" presumably meaning more gods.",
      "Shit. ----- Athena pulls her red VW convertible over to Icarus' building, and spots him sitting on the steps.",
      "She beeps the horn and waves at him, bringing him hurrying over.",
      "She's a little surprised to see he looks nervous, but she recalls that he described a terrifying ride in Helios' chariot one time.",
      "That must be it.",
      "Well, he'll soon see that some gods know how to drive their chariots smartly and responsibly.",
      "She smiles reassuringly at him.",
      "\"All right, we've got our afternoon planned!",
      "Heph - that is, Hephaestus, and his wife will be watching, along with another friend,\" she tells him cheerfully, pulling back into traffic and guiding her chariot towards her pre-selected teleportation location.",
      "Unexpectedly, Icarus looks even more nervous.",
      "\"Ahh, okay... um, all right, so Hephaestus - he's the god of the forge, right, and -\" Icarus pauses.",
      "Aha.",
      "So, not worried about the chariot, but worried about meeting new gods.",
      "She supposes they do have a reputation for easily taking offense.",
      "\"Uh",
      ", his wife - is that - Aphrodite?\" he asks hesitantly.",
      "\"Oh, goodness, no!",
      "That was a long time ago.",
      "I'd better summarize.",
      "Heph was married to Aphrodite, but - they divorced.",
      "It was unpleasant, to say the least.",
      "That was quite a long time ago, though, and they're on good terms now.",

      "She's completely lovely, you'll like her.\"",
      "\"Are there any other topics I shouldn't bring up?\"",
      "Icarus asks anxiously.",
      "\"Don't worry about it so much,\" she assures him.",
      "\"Hephaestus is quite laid-back, and I'm sure you'll find plenty of other topics to talk about than old myths.",
      "He's bringing some of his gadgets along, and he'll be excited to show them off.",
      "Plus, Aglaia is a delight to have around; she'll certainly make conversation easy.\"",
      "\"O-okay.. well, what about the other guy?",
      "Your friend?\"",
      "\"Ah - Horme.",
      "He's more of a co-worker - an associate of mine.",
      "He's a minor god, of the spirit of energy and motivation.",
      "The 'can-do' spirit, if you will.",
      "He had a shrine within my temples, back in the old days.",
      "And you'll be happy to hear that he is well-known for staying out of trouble and generally getting along with everyone.\"",
      "Athena's being slightly evasive here, but luckily, it's at this moment that she enters the portal, and Icarus is only half-listening.",
      "She smiles and lets the conversation trail off as he gapes with naked amazement at the splash of stars in the Space Between Worlds.",
      "She doesn't realize he's been holding his breath until he lets it out in a huff and quickly puts his hands to his throat.",
      "\"I...",
      "I can breathe here?\" he asks, sounding dazed.",
      "The answer is obvious - he can, and he is - but she answers the implied question of how anyway.",
      "\"Yes, you're within my aegis.",
      "Any goddess or god who travels with you outside of the mortal realm would do the same.",
      "Assuming they want you alive, that is,\" she adds, for the sake of being precise.",
      "\"Ah.\"",
      "Icarus falls silent and watches the constellations go by like a hall in an art museum: she points out Auriga, \"my adopted son, Erichthonius,\" but otherwise is content to watch the amazement in his eyes.",
      "She really does have a soft spot for mortals with a thirst for knowledge over heroism.",
      "Eventually, she pulls out of the Space and through another portal, onto a highway with a significantly different ecosystem than the one they left - great plains with mountains in the distance.",
      "Icarus sits up, looking around.",
      "\"Oh - where are we?",
      "I thought we'd be watching them in space?\"",
      "\"We're in central Wyoming,\" she informs him, navigating to the prearranged location - a public park in a small nearby town.",
      "\"You may have the opportunity to see the eclipse up close later, but our company - myself included - prefers not to get too close when these events occur.\"",
      "If Icarus has more questions, he doesn't ask.",
      "She parks her chariot and he follows her as they walk past small crowds of people, who are all excitedly talking.",
      "She overhears more than one conversation expressing astonishment that the weather cleared unexpectedly; apparently there was supposed to be stormy weather today but it never materialized, which has allowed the local population the luxury of watching the eclipse without too many out-of-town tourists.",
      "She leads Icarus over to a stand of pine trees.",
      "Near these trees, three individuals are set up on a blanket.",
      "\"Good morning, everyone,\" she greets them all.",
      "\"I'm glad to see we've all made it!",

      "\"That's cool.\"",
      "Hephaestus grins back.",
      "\"I got it from the stand over there.",
      "They're only ten dollars if you want one yourself.\"",
      "\"Did you get yours from the same stand, Horme?\" Athena asks, quirking her lips.",
      "\"Nope.",
      "This one's a one-of-a-kind.\"",
      "\"I'm not surprised.",
      "And I don't even need to ask if you got your necklace from around here, Aglaia.\"",
      "The Grace laughs.",
      "She's declined to wear a humorous t-shirt, and instead is wearing one of her typical outfits - effortlessly elegant but casual, and has a beautiful necklace wrought of silver, in the shape of the diamond ring effect of an eclipse.",
      "\"No, of course, my talented husband created this for me, to wear for the occasion.\"",
      "\"It's beautiful,\" Athena, Icarus, and Horme all say in unison, making Aglaia and Hephaestus both laugh and blush.",
      "It's a lovely day.",
      "The park has a band playing live music; there are food trucks selling snacks and fried meals (Icarus goes back twice for strawberry shortcake); and enterprising locals are selling t-shirts and running games.",
      "As Athena had expected, Icarus is extremely excited when shown Hephaestus' new gadget - it's a telescope of a kind of power that should not normally be possible in something so small, and it has a time-lapse camera attachment as well.",
      "Icarus is beside himself asking questions about how it works, what measurements he's taking, and whether the technology is reproducible for mortals.",
      "Athena, Horme and Icarus take a stroll through the park to see what there is to see and to buy snacks and a t-shirt for Icarus, and they come back to find Aglaia taking a nap in the sun while Hephaestus tinkers with his instrument one-handed.",
      "The other hand is holding one of Aglaia's while she sleeps.",
      "They hold hands a lot, as much as they did when they were young newlyweds, and it makes Athena beam to see it.",
      "The eclipse takes a little over two hours from beginning to end, and it's a joy to see Icarus' normally dour face lighting up with excitement as he peers through his glasses or the telescope to see the moon goddesses maneuver their chariot to block and defeat the sun gods.",
      "Though of course, here in the physical realm, all that manifests is an increasingly slender crescent shape in the sky.",
      "\"It seems so peaceful from down here,\" Athena remarks at one point, as the light begins to dim around them.",
      "\"Peaceful?\" Icarus asks.",
      "\"They're... pretty competitive,\" Aglaia says diplomatically.",
      "\"Oh, yeah, I guess I sort of saw...",
      "Artemis came by the other day, and she and Apollo immediately started bickering about it.\"",
      "The other three gods all groan in unison.",
      "\"All four of them have been going at it for weeks,\" Hephaestus says.",
      "\"I guess it's good they're keeping up their enthusiasm after a few thousand years, but the rest of us?",
      "Well, let's say, the novelty wears off after a while.\"",
      "Athena sniffs.",
      "\"That's why I haven't gone to see it in so long.\"",
      "\"You grouches!",
      "It's still entertaining enough... as long as you keep your distance,\" Aglaia says, giving Hephaestus a peck on the cheek.",
      "\"I heard that Zeus made a new rule that the sun gods have to wear a shirt that says 'I got mooned' the day after,\" Horme says suddenly.",
      "\"Oh really?\" Hephaestus and Aglaia have matching contemplative expressions.",
      "\"Well, that will make things interesting tomorrow,\" Hephaestus says.",
      "\"Heh, Zeus can be hilarious when he feels like it!\"",
      "Athena holds her chin in her hand thoughtfully.",
      "\"I believe I observed a young lady wearing that shirt around this very park today.\"",
      "Horme laughs.",
      "\"I guess the mortals share a sense of humor with the old man!\"",
      "Aglaia and Hephaestus laugh and scold Horme for speaking disrespectfully of their king, though neither sound concerned.",
      "Icarus hasn't answered in a while, staring around in amazement as the streetlights come on and cicadas and crickets begin calling.",
      "\"Oh wow, I think it's - ah, look!",
      "Up there!!\"",
      "They all obediently look.",
      "The crowd begins cheering as the last tiny sliver of the sun is eclipsed by the moon.",
      "Icarus and the gods are also cheering, and then there is only the ring in the sky.",
      "Icarus removes his glasses and gapes.",
      "The gods murmur in conversation to each other, and Athena carefully takes a photo of Icarus standing with a look of childlike delight on his face, with the ring hanging in the sky.",
      "The photo shows up far better than the tiny sensors ought to be able to handle.",
      "She sends it to Artemis first - she'll wait and show it to Apollo after a day or two.",
      "Then the moon moves out of the way, and the sun comes back, bright and shining.",
      "Icarus goes over immediately to check out what the telescope picked up, but keeps sneaking glances up at the slowly thickening crescent through his glasses.",
      "\"That was great,\" he says.",
      "\"It was,\" Athena agrees.",
      "\"Aesthetically pleasing and so peaceful.\"",
      "\"I can fix that!\"",
      "says a new voice, belonging to the messenger god Hermes, who pops in unexpectedly a few inches behind Icarus.",
      "Icarus startles and loses his balance, nearly falling into the pile of discarded wrappers and snacks, but is caught round the waist by Hermes.",
      "\"Artemis got your text and sent me to retrieve Icarus here, insisting that he needs to see 'the real thing,'\" Hermes informs them.",
      "\"You guys about wrapped up here?",
      "What do you say, Icarus, ready to roll out?\"",
      "\"Wh-wha...??!\"",
      "\"Yes, the totality just ended,\" Athena tells Hermes.",
      "\"Go ahead, Icarus, we can look over the telescope's readings later,\" Hephaestus encourages.",
      "Hermes tips his hat jauntily and shifts his grip on Icarus, tucking him up under one arm, and leaping into the sky.",
      "The human's bewildered yelling fades after him.",
      "The remaining four gods watch as Hermes disappears into the sky with his human parcel.",
      "\"Well, this should be educational for the boy,\" Aglaia remarks.",
      "Hephaestus laughs.",
      "\"I'm sure.",
      "I haven't dared to go back since...ah, probably sometime in the 1600s, or thereabout.",
      "Though they all ask me to make them various things to try to dominate the battle...",
      "the ladies have the most creativity there.",
      "Artemis asked for a monster truck last time; this year, Selene asked for a handmaiden to drive their chariot.",
      "I was instructed to design her to look stunningly gorgeous,\" he adds, cutting his eyes over to his wife with a shy grin.",
      "She nudges him, smiling.",
      "\"So that's why I had to come over to model?",
      "You scoundrel!",
      "Who knows what those two will do with a handmaiden that looks like me!\"",
      "Horme snickers.",
      "\"I'm sure we can all- ooph!\"",
      "Athena elbows him hard in the ribs.",
      "Aglaia rolls her eyes at him and stands up, brushing grass off her skirt.",
      "\"Let's get a lemonade and some funnel cake before we leave, Heph.",
      "Do you two want anything?\"",
      "\"No, thank you, Aglaia,\" Athena says politely.",
      "The Grace nods to them and helps her husband to his feet, then takes his arm as they walk slowly over to the food truck.",
      "Horme watches them go.",
      "\"It's nice to see a success story,\" he says, a note of wistfulness in his voice.",
      "\"I think we're all success stories,\" Athena asserts.",
      "She begins to pack up the camera and other items they've brought.",
      "\"Even those idiots in the sky - they've come a long way from the troubled, angry young gods they were.\"",
      "\"They've changed a little more recently.",
      "The sun idiots, I mean.",
      "I guess it must be because of this mortal....Icarus.\"",
      "If Horme has any thoughts on the extent or nature of the deities' evolution, he doesn't offer them.",
      "\"Huh.",
      "You know, since I've been here playing the part of Horme?",
      "Taking that role, I could actually feel the kid switch from apathy to energy almost as soon as he started watching the eclipse.",
      "He's really excited about studying the heavens.\"",
      "\"He is.",
      "But he's really more passionate about spaceflight - astrodynamics and space aviation.",
      "He wants to explore the heavens, not just look at them.\"",
      "\"Oh?\" Horme looks up at her, eyes crinkling.",
      "\"That's cute.\"",
      "\"I agree.",
      "It's very endearing how much the three of them care.\"",
      "They watch for another minute in silence as the moon moves away from the sun and the day gets brighter again.",
      "Down the field, some distance away, Hephaestus and Aglaia are eating their funnel cake together and laughing at the mess it makes.",
      "Finally Athena asks: \"Are you really going to make them wear that shirt, Father?",
      "There'll be an awful lot of complaining.\"",
      "Horme snorts and waves his hand.",
      "In the sky, storm clouds appear abruptly, beginning to roll in now that the eclipse is over, as though they'd been held back for the duration.",
      "\"They'll survive it.\"",
      "--------------- The speed of Hermes' flight is not something Icarus can fully register.",
      "After they've stopped moving, there's a confused memory of fleeting images and sensations: the earth falling away, the air around him going cold and clear, light turning into dark, and the feeling of moving fast-fast-FAST.",
      "They stop abruptly in front of a gold-colored Prius, floating in space.",
      "Hermes leans over and taps politely on the driver's side window.",
      "\"Knock knock!\"",
      "he announces cheerfully.",
      "\"Special delivery for Misters Apollo and Helios!",
      "Will you sign for this parcel?\"",
      "The window rolls down.",
      "\"What the hell are you doing here, Hermes?\" Apollo demands.",
      "\"Wait - is that Icarus?\" Icarus is holding his breath reflexively, in spite of what Athena told him about the aegis; but he lets out a yelp as Hermes jostles him playfully.",
      "\"Yup!",
      "Shipped direct, courtesy of Lady Artemis.\"",
      "\"Ugh.\"",
      "Apollo's face takes on a pained expression.",
      "\"Well don't just sit there with him dangling in space, Hermes, bring him in.\"",
      "Hermes moves, again, and Icarus finds himself sitting in the front passenger seat.",
      "Hermes himself has taken a seat behind Apollo, and is kicking the back of the seat, making Apollo's scowl deepen.",
      "\"This is fun!",
      "Wow, I haven't gotten an up close and personal seat for one of these in decades!\"",
      "\"Yeah, well, mind your P's and Q's or you won't get to sit here in the future,\" growls Helios' voice from immediately behind Icarus.",
      "The sun Titan leans forward, reaching around the seat to give Icarus' leg a squeeze.",
      "\"Sorry you had to be dragged into this, kiddo.\"",
      "\"A-are you kidding?\" Icarus is slightly embarrassed at how high and excited his voice is, and makes an effort to pitch it lower and calmer, with limited success.",
      "\"I just watched this, down in Wyoming - I wanted to watch this so bad!",
      "You guys, you know I love space, and this is a huge event!\"",
      "Both sun gods' eyes twitch at 'huge event,' but they sigh and offer Icarus a resigned smile.",
      "\"There are much better events than an eclipse,\" Apollo tells him.",
      "\"Solar flares and coronal mass ejections...\" \"Lunar eclipses!\"",
      "interjects Helios.",
      "\"Well, I wanna see them!!\"",
      "\"Oi.",
      "You guys can try to do damage control later,\" Hermes says, suppressing a smile.",
      "\"Here come the ladies!\"",
      "Icarus whips his head around and peers out the window of the Prius - as Hermes has said, they're being approached by a - \"A limousine?\"",
      "\"Must have been Selene's choice, this year,\" Apollo grumbles.",
      "A heavily remixed version of Fleetwood Mac's 'Sisters of the Moon' blares from the limo.",
      "\"Yooooooooooooo, Apollo!",
      "Helios!!!",
      "This classy enough for ya?!\"",
      "Artemis is bellowing.",
      "She's only visible from the waist up, as she's standing up out of the limo's - hah - 'sunroof', alongside the Titaness Selene.",
      "Both have bottles of champagne in hand, and are dressed in silvery evening wear - Artemis is wearing a white bolero with a crop top shell underneath, while Selene appears to be wearing a gown with a top made of lacey moon phases.",
      "They both cheer when they see Icarus sitting in the front seat.",
      "\"Icarus!!!",
      "Glad ya could make it kiddo!!\"",
      "Then the two sun gods are leaning out the window, unable to contain their competitive annoyance, and start shouting at their sisters, mostly in Greek so Icarus doesn't understand it, but he can guess from the tone that there's a lot of insults being flung around.",
      "Hermes is in the backseat laughing his ass off.",
      "The moon goddesses are jeering right back.",
      "Artemis takes out her bow and takes aim - confetti and something like silly string explode over Apollo's chariot and the limo roars off, leaving a huge cloud of foggy exhaust behind, which engulfs the chariot completely.",
      "Apollo slumps back against his seat in a huff.",
      "\"Well, at least that's over with.\"",
      "Icarus has been mute this whole time, watching with alarm and fascination at the spectacle, and turns his head to watch the moon limo peel off into space.",
      "He looks over at Apollo in delight.",
      "\"That was - incredible!",
      "Apollo, Helios - when's the next lunar eclipse?\" --------------------- The next day, Icarus wakes up to see a neatly folded t-shirt on his bedside table, with the words \"I got Mooned!",
      "- Metaphysical sky, 21 August 2017\"."

    "text": "Apollo places one elegant finger in his book to mark the place and sighs softly as he looks over at where Icarus is napping on the couch, and Helios knows that Apollo's picturing the kid dead. It's not as though it was some big secret that Icarus will die someday. To the contrary; the gods have known since the beginning - before the beginning, really. They've known, even before they were aware of Icarus' reincarnation, that all mortals are now condemned to age and die. No more gifts of immortality for favorites. And to make it unquestionably final, even Zeus himself has followed this order. At the time - this was a few decades after the spectacular debacle of the Trojan War - they'd all seen the sense in it, though a little sullenly. They had allowed the mortals to manipulate them into taking sides against each other, with consequences that had left a mark for quite a while. So the gates had been shut forever after that - Ganymede was the last human to be immortalized. There were other rules, about the limits of their interaction with humans, but most pertinent to Apollo at this moment is the rule about Dead Mortals. \"He's like, 23 or something,\" Helios says without preamble. \"And health care has improved since the old days, thanks to you. He's not gonna die tomorrow.\" \"He may as well,\" Apollo replies, not bothering to deny he's been fretting over it. \"If he lives to 90 - a long time by mortal standards - that's still less than seventy years. And he'd likely be infirm for the last twenty years. That's hardly any time at all.\" \"But it's time. It's not nothing.\" \"It's not enough.\" Icarus shifts in his sleep, mumbling something incoherent and dropping one arm over the side of the couch. He really does look impossibly cute and vulnerable at the moment - all humans do. The gods are uniformly enamored with sleeping humans, the way all the drama and paltriness and misery drop from their faces, the way they shut down all awareness and agency and lie there, still and helpless. In Helios' case, the sight usually fills him with an urge to break out the markers and start drawing dicks on faces, or go get some shaving cream or a dish of warm water. But Apollo tends to go all mushy and tender when he sees shit like this, and sure enough, his eyes are going soft as he watches Icarus drooling onto the pillow. Then his eyes harden, and Helios groans inwardly. \"I'm going to talk to Zeus.\" \"Nope.\" \"I will.\" Apollo stands up, taking a moment to brush invisible dust off his trousers and neaten his shirt. \"This is ridiculous. It's been centuries.\" \"Apollo, don't be an asshole. He's been sticking to the damn rule too, so you know he's not going to be interested in hearing your problems. You need to drop this. Don't end up wasting a bunch of your time re-opening a closed issue. Zeus'll say no anyway and by the time you've lost the argument, Mop-Head'll be dead and you're gonna be even more miserable.\" At a glance, it does seem ludicrous that Helios of all people, should be the mature one about this. But people are always making this mistake about the two of them. They think that because Apollo is so elegant and calm and flowery most of the time, and has such a soft speaking voice, that he isn't capable of throwing a nuclear-level tantrum like a giant damn baby when he's upset about something. Even the people who should know better - like everyone who was at the trial, after his son died? Did they somehow forget what he's like when he's pissed off? The kid artfully combines righteousness and pettiness with maximum wrathful results. Truly a chip off the old block - maybe more so than any other of Zeus' sons. He does it when he's angry, he does it when he's sad. And he's warming up to be pretty fucking both right now. \"Perhaps no one's presented a convincing enough reason for him to change his mind. Maybe Titans and the First Gods can forget about mortals after a day or so, but some of the rest of us want to keep them around.\" His eyes are starting to glow and Helios finally stands up, stepping over to Apollo, every inch of him emanating ancient power in spite of his youthful form. \"Listen, brat, first of all, don't even fucking dare imply that I don't give a shit. Just because I don't have my head up my ass living in some fantasy world where no laws apply - this is reality, fuckhead. And part of that reality is that the kid's gonna die someday because Zeus is not gonna change his mind. In fact,\" he cuts off whatever rejoinder Apollo was about to say, \"... I'm pretty sure Zeus would kill Icarus himself just to prove a point to you and keep you from getting ideas above your station. Is that what you want?\" This draws Apollo up short, though he isn't quite ready to let go of his anger yet. \"You're a Titan. You're older than him, you have influence-\" The reason Helios has any influence at all with Zeus, and the reason he's still alive when so many of his cousins are dead, is because Helios picks his battles very carefully, rather than charging in like some Ares-style berserker. \"Not gonna happen. And if I have to, I will stop you from approaching him with this.\" Apollo's eyes are burning. So are Helios'. \"Is that so.\" \"Yeah, it's so.\" The sound of the apartment door opening interrupts them both and they look over. Icarus flinches but doesn't otherwise react. \"It's like the inside of a volcano in here. Kinda hard to sleep through it.\" The gods both look slightly abashed. \"Oh. Uh, sorry bout that, Mop-Head,\" Helios mutters. Icarus shrugs dully. \"Who needs sleep anyway, right? I'll just go to class early.\" He checks his watch and rolls his eyes. \"Really early.\" \"You don't need to. We'll keep ourselves calm now,\" Apollo tries. \"Yeah, no thanks.\" The undertone of bitterness and despair, which always seem to tinge Icarus' voice, is back. \"Just try not to completely destroy the apartment? I need someplace to live. And I mean, it seems stupid to get into a fight over a guy when you were happy enough to let me die the first time.\" The door shuts on silence and a suddenly-cold apartment. ------------ Icarus trudges through the darkened streets. It's really far, far to early for him to get to class, but the smaller library on the far side of campus is open 24/7 and they allow coffee in the reading rooms. If nothing else, he can get a nap in at one of the tables there - it's more likely to be restful in the library than in his own apartment, apparently. The really stupid thing about the gods arguing over making him immortal, is they didn't even ask Icarus. They never do. The gods just tear through his life without any care for what he wants - and that's how they've always been, isn't it? Even in the old myths. The gods take. Sometimes the mortals get something out of it, sometimes they don't; it's irrelevant to the point. The gods take. Even Icarus' first life, apparently, only amounted to a few laughs in the end, at the gullible idiot mortal who thought he was worth something to the gods. Who wants to spend eternity with that? Although, Icarus thinks tiredly, as he crosses a street and heads down a back alley: Icarus isn't sure what he'd say if he was offered immortality. There are days when it doesn't seem worth it to suffer through seventy more years, let alone eternity. --------------- They don't apologize, not really, but the fight is over. They just.. fall back in together. They've worked and lived together for so long that it's inevitable. They stand wordlessly, side by side, watching Icarus from far in the sky as he drags himself through the streets. \"He could die tomorrow,\" Apollo says after a while. \"We can plan to have years and years, but he could be struck by a vehicle tomorrow. Zephyrus could come by and harm him. He might be bitten by a snake. Hyacinthus-\" he pauses here to collect himself. \"Hyacinthus and I thought we would have years.\" \"Yeah. I know. I figured I'd have more than an hour with Phaethon.\" \"Oh - of course.\" \"Zeus killed him in front of me. I promise you he won't back down just because we think Icarus is cute.\" They both fall into silence again. Then, after a few minutes, Apollo points down to earth. \"I suppose we can at least do our best to make sure he makes it to 90,\" he says, smirking mirthlessly as a few gritty-looking young men perk up as they see the soft, innocent-looking Icarus entering their territory. \"Right,\" Helios grins savagely and cracks his knuckles. \"That part can even be fun, I think.\"",
    "sentences": [
      "Apollo places one elegant finger in his book to mark the place and sighs softly as he looks over at where Icarus is napping on the couch, and Helios knows that Apollo's picturing the kid dead.",
      "It's not as though it was some big secret that Icarus will die someday.",
      "To the contrary; the gods have known since the beginning - before the beginning, really.",
      "They've known, even before they were aware of Icarus' reincarnation, that all mortals are now condemned to age and die.",
      "No more gifts of immortality for favorites.",
      "And to make it unquestionably final, even Zeus himself has followed this order.",
      "At the time - this was a few decades after the spectacular debacle of the Trojan War - they'd all seen the sense in it, though a little sullenly.",
      "They had allowed the mortals to manipulate them into taking sides against each other, with consequences that had left a mark for quite a while.",
      "So the gates had been shut forever after that - Ganymede was the last human to be immortalized.",
      "There were other rules, about the limits of their interaction with humans, but most pertinent to Apollo at this moment is the rule about Dead Mortals.",
      "\"He's like, 23 or something,\" Helios says without preamble.",
      "\"And health care has improved since the old days, thanks to you.",
      "He's not gonna die tomorrow.\"",
      "\"He may as well,\" Apollo replies, not bothering to deny he's been fretting over it.",
      "\"If he lives to 90 - a long time by mortal standards - that's still less than seventy years.",
      "And he'd likely be infirm for the last twenty years.",
      "That's hardly any time at all.\"",
      "\"But it's time.",
      "It's not nothing.\"",
      "\"It's not enough.\"",
      "Icarus shifts in his sleep, mumbling something incoherent and dropping one arm over the side of the couch.",
      "He really does look impossibly cute and vulnerable at the moment - all humans do.",
      "The gods are uniformly enamored with sleeping humans, the way all the drama and paltriness and misery drop from their faces, the way they shut down all awareness and agency and lie there, still and helpless.",
      "In Helios' case, the sight usually fills him with an urge to break out the markers and start drawing dicks on faces, or go get some shaving cream or a dish of warm water.",
      "But Apollo tends to go all mushy and tender when he sees shit like this, and sure enough, his eyes are going soft as he watches Icarus drooling onto the pillow.",
      "Then his eyes harden, and Helios groans inwardly.",
      "\"I'm going to talk to Zeus.\"",
      "\"Nope.\"",
      "\"I will.\"",
      "Apollo stands up, taking a moment to brush invisible dust off his trousers and neaten his shirt.",
      "\"This is ridiculous.",
      "It's been centuries.\"",
      "\"Apollo, don't be an asshole.",
      "He's been sticking to the damn rule too, so you know he's not going to be interested in hearing your problems.",
      "You need to drop this.",
      "Don't end up wasting a bunch of your time re-opening a closed issue.",
      "Zeus'll say no anyway and by the time you've lost the argument, Mop-Head'll be dead and you're gonna be even more miserable.\"",
      "At a glance, it does seem ludicrous that Helios of all people, should be the mature one about this.",
      "But people are always making this mistake about the two of them.",
      "They think that because Apollo is so elegant and calm and flowery most of the time, and has such a soft speaking voice, that he isn't capable of throwing a nuclear-level tantrum like a giant damn baby when he's upset about something.",
      "Even the people who should know better - like everyone who was at the trial, after his son died?",
      "Did they somehow forget what he's like when he's pissed off?",
      "The kid artfully combines righteousness and pettiness with maximum wrathful results.",
      "Truly a chip off the old block - maybe more so than any other of Zeus' sons.",
      "He does it when he's angry, he does it when he's sad.",
      "And he's warming up to be pretty fucking both right now.",
      "\"Perhaps no one's presented a convincing enough reason for him to change his mind.",
      "Maybe Titans and the First Gods can forget about mortals after a day or so, but some of the rest of us want to keep them around.\"",
      "His eyes are starting to glow and Helios finally stands up, stepping over to Apollo, every inch of him emanating ancient power in spite of his youthful form.",
      "\"Listen, brat, first of all, don't even fucking dare imply that I don't give a shit.",
      "Just because I don't have my head up my ass living in some fantasy world where no laws apply - this is reality, fuckhead.",
      "And part of that reality is that the kid's gonna die someday because Zeus is not gonna change his mind.",
      "In fact,\" he cuts off whatever rejoinder Apollo was about to say, \"...",
      "I'm pretty sure Zeus would kill Icarus himself just to prove a point to you and keep you from getting ideas above your station.",
      "Is that what you want?\"",
      "This draws Apollo up short, though he isn't quite ready to let go of his anger yet.",
      "\"You're a Titan.",
      "You're older than him, you have influence-\" The reason Helios has any influence at all with Zeus, and the reason he's still alive when so many of his cousins are dead, is because Helios picks his battles very carefully, rather than charging in like some Ares-style berserker.",
      "\"Not gonna happen.",
      "And if I have to, I will stop you from approaching him with this.\"",
      "Apollo's eyes are burning.",
      "So are Helios'.",
      "\"Is that so.\"",
      "\"Yeah, it's so.\"",
      "The sound of the apartment door opening interrupts them both and they look over.",
      "Icarus flinches but doesn't otherwise react.",
      "\"It's like the inside of a volcano in here.",
      "Kinda hard to sleep through it.\"",
      "The gods both look slightly abashed.",
      "\"Oh.",
      "Uh",
      ", sorry bout that, Mop-Head,\" Helios mutters.",
      "Icarus shrugs dully.",
      "\"Who needs sleep anyway, right?",
      "I'll just go to class early.\"",
      "He checks his watch and rolls his eyes.",
      "\"Really early.\"",
      "\"You don't need to.",
      "We'll keep ourselves calm now,\" Apollo tries.",
      "\"Yeah, no thanks.\"",
      "The undertone of bitterness and despair, which always seem to tinge Icarus' voice, is back.",
      "\"Just try not to completely destroy the apartment?",
      "I need someplace to live.",
      "And I mean, it seems stupid to get into a fight over a guy when you were happy enough to let me die the first time.\"",
      "The door shuts on silence and a suddenly-cold apartment.",
      "------------ Icarus trudges through the darkened streets.",
      "It's really far, far to early for him to get to class, but the smaller library on the far side of campus is open 24/7 and they allow coffee in the reading rooms.",
      "If nothing else, he can get a nap in at one of the tables there - it's more likely to be restful in the library than in his own apartment, apparently.",
      "The really stupid thing about the gods arguing over making him immortal, is they didn't even ask Icarus.",
      "They never do.",

    "text": "By default, Icarus isn't a particularly cheery guy. He's prone to sarcasm, depression, and cynicism - even when he's in fine health. When he's not in fine health, the grouchiness goes off the charts. A long coughing fit is punctuated by two mighty sneezes and a curse. \"Is there some god of sickness so I can kick his ass,\" Icarus raves hoarsely, looking around for more Mucinex. Helios laughs from where he's sitting improbably balanced on the back of a kitchen chair. \"As it so happens, that particular asshole is in your apartment right now!\" Icarus looks up through bleary eyes at Helios, who's pointing at Apollo, who's looking at Icarus thoughtfully. Icarus blinks. \"Wait - I thought you were a doctor? The god of healing? You heal people!\" \"And kill them, sometimes. Both aspects of disease fall under my domain. Though I lay no claim to this attack on your immune system,\" Apollo says absently, leaning over to inspect Icarus closely. Icarus feels too shitty to blush; he just glowers and wavers where he stands. \"...It does appear your initial production of white blood cells has failed to fight off the virus. It's an infection now; a pity. You'll have to go through the unpleasantness of fever and phlegm to dispel it.\" \"I'll be happy to help you kick his ass, Icarus, just say the word!\" Icarus groans and grabs a glass of water and the Mucinex, retreating to his room. ------ By the following morning, it's evident that Apollo's prediction is coming true, as usual. Icarus can't even leave his bed without stumbling dizzily. Apollo had wordlessly steered him back to his nest of blankets, leaving him with a fresh glass of juice, and retrieved Icarus' student handbook from his desk. If Icarus had been in slightly better health, he might have been annoyed by how familiar Apollo is with Icarus' things; he's clearly snooped before. As it is, though, Icarus doesn't have the energy to care, and just shuts his eyes and tries to force air in through his congested airways. Apollo is talking on Icarus' cell phone now. \"Yes, Professor Mansouri. I am calling on behalf of a student of yours, Icarus. He will be unable to attend your lecture today, and probably not for the following two days. He is quite ill with a viral infection. I'd like to discuss whatever arrangements are necessary for his coursework in this absence.\" A pause, and then: \"Ah, yes, of course you need to know to whom you are speaking. My name is Apollo; I am his lover.\" This raises a chorus of noise, in the form of Icarus sitting up, spinning with dizziness but croaking out a protest at Apollo's oblivious bluntness, while Helios cracks up where he's lounging in the window frame. ----------- His phone rings again while Apollo is out at the grocer's and apothecary. Apollo had been prepared to lecture Icarus on the importance of keeping a stock of medications on hand, as well as healthy foods in his pantry - but upon seeing the way Icarus' eyes aren't focusing and he keeps being overcome by a wretched deep hacking fit that leaves him weak and shivering on the bed, Apollo decides to spare him the lecture. Or postpone it, more likely. In any case, Apollo is gone obtaining supplies and has left Helios to supervise. The Titan is fulfilling his obligation by narrating aloud from an erotic sunjung manhwa he got from one of his sisters. \"So then in this panel, Soon-Im is totally interested in Min-su, she looks like she's about twenty seconds away from throwing herself at him beaver-first, but she tosses her head and says that she can never forget her summer with Hwi-Sun. Idiot. Hwi-Sun's already up to his elbows in Ji-Hyo and she knows it - oh, your phone?\" Icarus has been dozing in and out, waking up in time to hear a raunchy descriptive passage before drifting off again, and the phone's ringtone comes to him as though in a dream. He waves a hand in the phone's direction, not opening his eyes. \"C'n you geddit,\" he mumbles in a whisper, the illness making him forget what a bad idea this would be. There's a pause, and the ringtone cuts off, replaced by Helios' voice. \"Yo, this is Helios, on Icarus' phone... oh hey, you're Leroy? The grandpa from the flower shop, right, yeah - oh, I bet he was supposed to come in today. Yeah, well, he's sick as a dog. Probably because he doesn't take care of himself... Me? Oh, well,\" Icarus can sense the grin forming on Helios' face. \"...I'm his lover.\" There's a pause, and then Helios speaks again, sounding annoyed. \"Listen, Grandpa, I'm definitely old enough, and for your information, I'm much hotter than Apollo!\" Icarus presses the heel of his palm to his forehead, unable to summon the energy to intervene as Helios casually sets him up for an extremely embarrassing return to work. \"No, Apoop's still around. There's two of us - haha, yeah, this guy's got plenty of fire for both of us! Well, I mean. Not at present, but in general. Right now I don't even know if he can sit up on his own. Yeah, he looks like a shredded sack of shit. Oh? Yeah, I bet he'd like that. Sure, one of us will come get it later. Okay. Later.\" Helios sounds smug and amused as he hops over to seat himself next to Icarus in his bed. \"Leroy called. He says you're a scamp and a rogue, but he sounded impressed. Elverna's making some food for you. That's sweet that they care so much, isn't it?\" But Icarus is already drifting, with odd dreams of Apollo and Helios speaking in Korean as they chase Icarus around the flower shop... ------------- When he wakes, he feels awful. The process of waking is gradual and miserable, and one of the first things that he's aware of is Apollo and Helios arguing. \"...objectively the hottest. And I have a motorcycle! So I'm the badass one too!\" \"Everything you're saying is debatable and in my opinion, wrong, but it's a moot point. A hypothetical hot badass on a motorcycle is interesting, but only one of the two of us has actually gone out to meet and charm all these boring people, while the other one - that is to say, you, Helios - is lazing around in the sky playing with his dick.\" \"Hey!\" Icarus is shaking, his body aches everywhere. He feels like he can't get warm enough, and yet his sheets are soaked through with sweat. His pajamas are actually dripping with sweat. He senses, rather than smells, the reek of sickness - his head is so congested that he couldn't possibly smell anything, and that's probably lucky. He tries to call out to the gods, but his voice is gone. The effort of trying to say anything makes his head hurt. The gods continue to speak, unaware. \"You're simply going to have to slum it with the mortals more often. Start with the old people; they're quite amiable. You can go get the food from them later.\" \"I slummed it with his retail co-workers last month...\" \"It's an ongoing commitment, Helios. I know you're a charm school dropout, but I'm sure you can manage-\" \"I have more charm in my left pinky than you have in your entire body, brat!\" Icarus drags himself painfully out of his bed. The action makes his head swim and he sits there for a moment, eyes closed, before he tries to walk towards the hall, where the gods are. \"Practice on Ares, perhaps, or Athena. If you can keep either of them interested for the duration of an entire conversation, you'll have the mortals eating out of your hand.\" \"Pfft. I'll believe it if I can see you do it first.\" \"H-hey...\" Icarus manages, wobbling as he clings to the doorframe. \"I need...\" His words are lost as he stumbles and collapses, the apartment blurring around him. --------- When he comes back around, he's still sitting on the floor in the hallway, so the blackout must've only lasted a moment. Helios and Apollo are kneeling next to him, looking concerned. \"Shit, Mop-Head, you gave us a heart attack!\" \"You're in bad shape, Icarus; you need to return to bed.\" Icarus opens his mouth, with the intent of trying to explain that his sheets are disgusting and too cold and too hot, and he's thirsty and his throat and face hurt and he can't breath, but he begins coughing instead. A deep, painful cough that ends with him throwing up on Apollo. Horrified mortification pierces through the fog of sickness, and tears of shame threaten to spill over. \"Sh-shit, I'm, I'm sorry...\" he wheezes wretchedly. \"Icarus. It's nothing. I'm a doctor, remember? It's nothing, I promise.\" Helios has put his hands to Icarus' shoulders, holding him steady while Apollo carefully removes his soiled shirt. Icarus barely notices the gleaming appearance of Apollo's bare chest; he's too busy coughing again. \"In any case, I can hardly keep company with the gods I do without having this happen, and with far less good excuse.\" \"Dionysus still owes you a shirt, doesn't he?\" Helios asks absently, rubbing Icarus' back. \"Yes, he does. So don't worry about it, Icarus. Let's worry more about your health, at the moment.\" Apollo carefully lifts Icarus in his arms and fuck, he's so warm, this is what Icarus needed. \"Helios, start a bath... keep the temperature around 85 degrees or so.\" Helios vanishes, presumably off to the bathroom, and Apollo walks carefully behind, carrying Icarus, who can't seem to cling close enough to this source of heat. \"Poor boy,\" Apollo murmurs, kissing his hair. The tub is already full when they arrive, and Icarus doesn't have the presence of mind to marvel at the speed. He doesn't have the ability to feel embarrassed or shy when the gods wordlessly strip him out of his pajamas and set him in the tub. He shivers until the warm water closes around him; then sits there, slouched over, eyes closed, while Helios pours warm water over his hair and back slowly from a deep cup. Apollo goes away and comes back with a tea that Icarus doesn't need to be able to smell to know that it's disgusting, full of healthy herbs and crap, but he's too tired and worn to care or make a remark. Apollo is saying something to Helios but Icarus is falling asleep where he sits in the tub. ----- He startles out of his short sleep in a panic - he's up to his chest in water, and the congestion blocks him from breathing, and for a horrible long few moments he's back in the sea, sinking below the water while water fills his lungs and the sun shines overhead. Icarus begins crying and Helios pulls him out instantly, wrapping him in a towel. \"I know, buddy, I know. It's okay. You're here, you're not drowning. Here, Icarus, you're with me. In your apartment. You're okay.\" He speaks repetitively and soothingly while Icarus cries and chokes on phlegm and shudders. Finally, in exhaustion, he drops his head to Helios' chest, too tired to do anything more. Helios, like Apollo, is blessedly warm and the heat of him fills Icarus, easing the ache in every muscle in his body. There's a sensation of movement and Icarus realizes that Helios is carrying him out of the bathroom now, back to the bedroom. He's set down on the bed, and sits there submissively as Helios dresses him again, in clean underwear and pajamas and socks, and dries his hair. The embarrassment floats through the back of his mind, but ultimately Icarus cannot find it in himself to give a shit at the moment, and for his part, Helios makes no jokes or comments. The bed sheets have been changed and they are considerably plusher and more pleasing to the skin than Icarus remembers - he has enough time to wonder if one of the gods brought these from Olympus, before he falls asleep again. --------- Everything after that is a series of brief, hazy moments of semi-consciousness, followed by long periods of sleep, filled with weird dreams. Icarus wakes and finds several new plushies adorning his bed. Apollo and Helios quickly show him their gifts: a dolphin and a bunny, but there's also chimera (\"Eos stopped by,\" Apollo says); a cat (\"Athena\"); a blobfish (\"Hermes thinks he's funny\"). Icarus smiles faintly as he brings them in to admire them. He loves them all but the blobfish does make an excellent pillow. ----- He wakes, shivering. Both gods are on either side of him and press their hands to his chest. Their warmth fills him; he's never felt anything so blissful in his life. -------- Once, Icarus half-rouses enough to hear a quiet conversation between Apollo and Helios. It starts after a long period of silence, broken by Helios: \"I fucking hate this.\" \"I know. So do I.\" \"The kid's miserable. We should be able to just fix this.\" \"The consequences would be inevitable and tragic. It's all part of that final decision he made.\" \"Yeah, I know, I know, it's just...\" Helios sounds frustrated and sad. \"I hate seeing him like this.\" \"For what it's worth, he is recovering. He's responding well to all the care we're giving him, so it's not as though we're really standing by and watching him suffer. We are helping. It's just... slower than we'd like.\" \"Yeah, and I'm glad, I guess. I just... I hate it.\" Icarus resolves to tell them, when he's awake and when his voice is back and his skull isn't pounding and his lungs don't feel like they're full of goo - he'll tell them how grateful he is for their help, and how he finally gets it now, he sees how much they care and he's sorry he used to doubt them, and he'll tell them what beautiful, loving boyfriends they are and how much he appreciates him. He resolves it, but the conversation is already fading a little from his fever-addled brain even as he makes the promise, and he's asleep again. -------- At some point Apollo has brought him into the bathroom to throw up again, and stands patiently by while Icarus attends to his bladder as well. The humiliation will certainly catch up to him afterwards, but Apollo is only sympathetic. \"I really am a doctor, you know,\" he remarks offhandedly as he helps Icarus back to his bed. The sheets are fresh every time. ------- A couple of times, Apollo sings to him, softly, in a language that Icarus doesn't speak. It must be Greek, but perhaps not... Apollo knows a lot of languages. Helios joins in, singing in harmony, and as he lies there, resting between their voices and their warmth, Icarus sleeps deeply. ----- Icarus wakes, and feels better. Not great, but better. His body doesn't ache and shiver constantly, and while he can't breathe perfectly, he doesn't feel like he's constantly suffocating. He sits up and rubs his eyes and looks around blearily. Helios is sitting on the edge of the bed, flipping through an explicit manhwa. Apollo is seated on a chair nearby, one leg cross elegantly over the other, reading a book on the science and function of birds' eggs. Icarus manages to smile at them both, still drugged on whatever weird herbs Apollo's been feeding him (he really, really hopes they don't ping him for a drug test). \"Morning -\" \"Good evening, actually, Icarus, it's 5:23 and 42 seconds, p.m..\" Apollo puts a bookmark in his pages and closes the book, smiling. \"You seem better.\" \"You only look 60 percent of the way to Hades' door, instead of 90 percent like earlier,\" Helios offers helpfully. \"Thanks. Yeah, I feel better, a little - starving, though, and kind of sick of this bed.\" \"Well, as luck would have it, Helios has recently returned from getting an awful lot of food from your employers. Leroy and Elverna have an enormous stock pot full of oxtail broth, chicken and rice, homemade fruit spread and strawberry chocolate chip cookies 'for when you're better.' Leroy sneaked some beer he brewed himself with the instructions that the alcohol kills the germs faster. I was not present to correct him on his faulty medical advice.\" \"I also got stuff from Blake at the Big Bean - ginger tea, and your friend Amelia got you banana bread from the store's bakery, and this balloon.\" There is a balloon, floating near the ceiling, that Icarus hadn't noticed at first. It was originally blank, and has been written on in marker: 'At least it's not chlamydia. Get back to work soon you lazy fuckwit.\" Amelia, Joey, and several others have signed it. Icarus sneezes and stands up on his own, dragging the comforter with him to wrap around his shoulders. \"I have the best friends. And the best boyfriends. Let's watch something on Netflix and eat some of this food.\"",

      "A pause, and then: \"Ah, yes, of course you need to know to whom you are speaking.",
      "My name is Apollo; I am his lover.\"",
      "This raises a chorus of noise, in the form of Icarus sitting up, spinning with dizziness but croaking out a protest at Apollo's oblivious bluntness, while Helios cracks up where he's lounging in the window frame.",
      "----------- His phone rings again while Apollo is out at the grocer's and apothecary.",
      "Apollo had been prepared to lecture Icarus on the importance of keeping a stock of medications on hand, as well as healthy foods in his pantry - but upon seeing the way Icarus' eyes aren't focusing and he keeps being overcome by a wretched deep hacking fit that leaves him weak and shivering on the bed, Apollo decides to spare him the lecture.",
      "Or postpone it, more likely.",
      "In any case, Apollo is gone obtaining supplies and has left Helios to supervise.",
      "The Titan is fulfilling his obligation by narrating aloud from an erotic sunjung manhwa he got from one of his sisters.",
      "\"So then in this panel, Soon-Im is totally interested in Min-su, she looks like she's about twenty seconds away from throwing herself at him beaver-first, but she tosses her head and says that she can never forget her summer with Hwi-Sun. Idiot.",
      "Hwi-Sun's already up to his elbows in Ji-Hyo and she knows it - oh, your phone?\" Icarus has been dozing in and out, waking up in time to hear a raunchy descriptive passage before drifting off again, and the phone's ringtone comes to him as though in a dream.",
      "He waves a hand in the phone's direction, not opening his eyes.",
      "\"C'n you geddit,\" he mumbles in a whisper, the illness making him forget what a bad idea this would be.",
      "There's a pause, and the ringtone cuts off, replaced by Helios' voice.",
      "\"Yo, this is Helios, on Icarus' phone...",
      "oh hey, you're Leroy?",
      "The grandpa from the flower shop, right, yeah - oh, I bet he was supposed to come in today.",
      "Yeah, well, he's sick as a dog.",
      "Probably because he doesn't take care of himself... Me?",
      "Oh, well,\" Icarus can sense the grin forming on Helios' face.",
      "\"...I'm his lover.\"",
      "There's a pause, and then Helios speaks again, sounding annoyed.",
      "\"Listen, Grandpa, I'm definitely old enough, and for your information, I'm much hotter than Apollo!\"",
      "Icarus presses the heel of his palm to his forehead, unable to summon the energy to intervene as Helios casually sets him up for an extremely embarrassing return to work.",
      "\"No, Apoop's still around.",
      "There's two of us - haha, yeah, this guy's got plenty of fire for both of us!",
      "Well, I mean.",
      "Not at present, but in general.",
      "Right now I don't even know if he can sit up on his own.",
      "Yeah, he looks like a shredded sack of shit.",
      "Oh?",
      "Yeah, I bet he'd like that.",
      "Sure, one of us will come get it later.",
      "Okay.",
      "Later.\"",
      "Helios sounds smug and amused as he hops over to seat himself next to Icarus in his bed.",
      "\"Leroy called.",
      "He says you're a scamp and a rogue, but he sounded impressed.",
      "Elverna's making some food for you.",
      "That's sweet that they care so much, isn't it?\"",
      "But Icarus is already drifting, with odd dreams of Apollo and Helios speaking in Korean as they chase Icarus around the flower shop... ------------- When he wakes, he feels awful.",
      "The process of waking is gradual and miserable, and one of the first things that he's aware of is Apollo and Helios arguing.",
      "\"...objectively the hottest.",
      "And I have a motorcycle!",
      "So I'm the badass one too!\"",
      "\"Everything you're saying is debatable and in my opinion, wrong, but it's a moot point.",
      "A hypothetical hot badass on a motorcycle is interesting, but only one of the two of us has actually gone out to meet and charm all these boring people, while the other one - that is to say, you, Helios - is lazing around in the sky playing with his dick.\"",
      "\"Hey!\"",
      "Icarus is shaking, his body aches everywhere.",
      "He feels like he can't get warm enough, and yet his sheets are soaked through with sweat.",
      "His pajamas are actually dripping with sweat.",
      "He senses, rather than smells, the reek of sickness - his head is so congested that he couldn't possibly smell anything, and that's probably lucky.",
      "He tries to call out to the gods, but his voice is gone.",
      "The effort of trying to say anything makes his head hurt.",
      "The gods continue to speak, unaware.",

      "\"I slummed it with his retail co-workers last month...\" \"It's an ongoing commitment, Helios.",
      "I know you're a charm school dropout, but I'm sure you can manage-\" \"I have more charm in my left pinky than you have in your entire body, brat!\"",
      "Icarus drags himself painfully out of his bed.",
      "The action makes his head swim and he sits there for a moment, eyes closed, before he tries to walk towards the hall, where the gods are.",
      "\"Practice on Ares, perhaps, or Athena.",
      "If you can keep either of them interested for the duration of an entire conversation, you'll have the mortals eating out of your hand.\"",
      "\"Pfft.",
      "I'll believe it if I can see you do it first.\"",
      "\"H-hey...\" Icarus manages, wobbling as he clings to the doorframe.",
      "\"I need...\" His words are lost as he stumbles and collapses, the apartment blurring around him.",
      "---------",
      "When he comes back around, he's still sitting on the floor in the hallway, so the blackout must've only lasted a moment.",
      "Helios and Apollo are kneeling next to him, looking concerned.",
      "\"Shit, Mop-Head, you gave us a heart attack!\"",
      "\"You're in bad shape, Icarus; you need to return to bed.\"",
      "Icarus opens his mouth, with the intent of trying to explain that his sheets are disgusting and too cold and too hot, and he's thirsty and his throat and face hurt and he can't breath, but he begins coughing instead.",
      "A deep, painful cough that ends with him throwing up on Apollo.",
      "Horrified mortification pierces through the fog of sickness, and tears of shame threaten to spill over.",
      "\"Sh-shit, I'm, I'm sorry...\" he wheezes wretchedly.",
      "\"Icarus.",
      "It's nothing.",
      "I'm a doctor, remember?",
      "It's nothing, I promise.\"",
      "Helios has put his hands to Icarus' shoulders, holding him steady while Apollo carefully removes his soiled shirt.",
      "Icarus barely notices the gleaming appearance of Apollo's bare chest; he's too busy coughing again.",
      "\"In any case, I can hardly keep company with the gods I do without having this happen, and with far less good excuse.\"",
      "\"Dionysus still owes you a shirt, doesn't he?\"",
      "Helios asks absently, rubbing Icarus' back.",
      "\"Yes, he does.",
      "So don't worry about it, Icarus.",
      "Let's worry more about your health, at the moment.\"",
      "Apollo carefully lifts Icarus in his arms and fuck, he's so warm, this is what Icarus needed.",
      "\"Helios, start a bath... keep the temperature around 85 degrees or so.\"",
      "Helios vanishes, presumably off to the bathroom, and Apollo walks carefully behind, carrying Icarus, who can't seem to cling close enough to this source of heat.",
      "\"Poor boy,\" Apollo murmurs, kissing his hair.",
      "The tub is already full when they arrive, and Icarus doesn't have the presence of mind to marvel at the speed.",
      "He doesn't have the ability to feel embarrassed or shy when the gods wordlessly strip him out of his pajamas and set him in the tub.",
      "He shivers until the warm water closes around him; then sits there, slouched over, eyes closed, while Helios pours warm water over his hair and back slowly from a deep cup.",
      "Apollo goes away and comes back with a tea that Icarus doesn't need to be able to smell to know that it's disgusting, full of healthy herbs and crap, but he's too tired and worn to care or make a remark.",
      "Apollo is saying something to Helios but Icarus is falling asleep where he sits in the tub.",
      "----- He startles out of his short sleep in a panic - he's up to his chest in water, and the congestion blocks him from breathing, and for a horrible long few moments he's back in the sea, sinking below the water while water fills his lungs and the sun shines overhead.",
      "Icarus begins crying and Helios pulls him out instantly, wrapping him in a towel.",
      "\"I know, buddy, I know.",
      "It's okay.",
      "You're here, you're not drowning.",
      "Here, Icarus, you're with me.",
      "In your apartment.",
      "You're okay.\"",
      "He speaks repetitively and soothingly while Icarus cries and chokes on phlegm and shudders.",
      "Finally, in exhaustion, he drops his head to Helios' chest, too tired to do anything more.",
      "Helios, like Apollo, is blessedly warm and the heat of him fills Icarus, easing the ache in every muscle in his body.",
      "There's a sensation of movement and Icarus realizes that Helios is carrying him out of the bathroom now, back to the bedroom.",
      "He's set down on the bed, and sits there submissively as Helios dresses him again, in clean underwear and pajamas and socks, and dries his hair.",
      "The embarrassment floats through the back of his mind, but ultimately Icarus cannot find it in himself to give a shit at the moment, and for his part, Helios makes no jokes or comments.",
      "The bed sheets have been changed and they are considerably plusher and more pleasing to the skin than Icarus remembers - he has enough time to wonder if one of the gods brought these from Olympus, before he falls asleep again.",
      "---------",
      "Everything after that is a series of brief, hazy moments of semi-consciousness, followed by long periods of sleep, filled with weird dreams.",
      "Icarus wakes and finds several new plushies adorning his bed.",
      "Apollo and Helios quickly show him their gifts: a dolphin and a bunny, but there's also chimera (\"Eos stopped by,\" Apollo says); a cat (\"Athena\"); a blobfish (\"Hermes thinks he's funny\").",
      "Icarus smiles faintly as he brings them in to admire them.",
      "He loves them all but the blobfish does make an excellent pillow.",
      "----- He wakes, shivering.",
      "Both gods are on either side of him and press their hands to his chest.",
      "Their warmth fills him; he's never felt anything so blissful in his life.",
      "-------- Once, Icarus half-rouses enough to hear a quiet conversation between Apollo and Helios.",
      "It starts after a long period of silence, broken by Helios: \"I fucking hate this.\"",
      "\"I know.",
      "So do I.\" \"The kid's miserable.",
      "We should be able to just fix this.\"",
      "\"The consequences would be inevitable and tragic.",
      "It's all part of that final decision he made.\"",
      "\"Yeah, I know, I know, it's just...\" Helios sounds frustrated and sad.",
      "\"I hate seeing him like this.\"",
      "\"For what it's worth, he is recovering.",
      "He's responding well to all the care we're giving him, so it's not as though we're really standing by and watching him suffer.",
      "We are helping.",
      "It's just... slower than we'd like.\"",
      "\"Yeah, and I'm glad, I guess.",
      "I just...",
      "I hate it.\"",
      "Icarus resolves to tell them, when he's awake and when his voice is back and his skull isn't pounding and his lungs don't feel like they're full of goo - he'll tell them how grateful he is for their help, and how he finally gets it now, he sees how much they care and he's sorry he used to doubt them, and he'll tell them what beautiful, loving boyfriends they are and how much he appreciates him.",
      "He resolves it, but the conversation is already fading a little from his fever-addled brain even as he makes the promise, and he's asleep again.",
      "-------- At some point Apollo has brought him into the bathroom to throw up again, and stands patiently by while Icarus attends to his bladder as well.",
      "The humiliation will certainly catch up to him afterwards, but Apollo is only sympathetic.",
      "\"I really am a doctor, you know,\" he remarks offhandedly as he helps Icarus back to his bed.",
      "The sheets are fresh every time.",
      "------- A couple of times, Apollo sings to him, softly, in a language that Icarus doesn't speak.",
      "It must be Greek, but perhaps not...",
      "Apollo knows a lot of languages.",
      "Helios joins in, singing in harmony, and as he lies there, resting between their voices and their warmth, Icarus sleeps deeply.",
      "----- Icarus wakes, and feels better.",
      "Not great, but better.",
      "His body doesn't ache and shiver constantly, and while he can't breathe perfectly, he doesn't feel like he's constantly suffocating.",
      "He sits up and rubs his eyes and looks around blearily.",
      "Helios is sitting on the edge of the bed, flipping through an explicit manhwa.",
      "Apollo is seated on a chair nearby, one leg cross elegantly over the other, reading a book on the science and function of birds' eggs.",
      "Icarus manages to smile at them both, still drugged on whatever weird herbs Apollo's been feeding him (he really, really hopes they don't ping him for a drug test).",
      "\"Morning -\" \"Good evening, actually, Icarus, it's 5:23 and 42 seconds, p.m..\"",
      "Apollo puts a bookmark in his pages and closes the book, smiling.",
      "\"You seem better.\"",
      "\"You only look 60 percent of the way to Hades' door, instead of 90 percent like earlier,\" Helios offers helpfully.",
      "\"Thanks.",
      "Yeah, I feel better, a little - starving, though, and kind of sick of this bed.\"",
      "\"Well, as luck would have it, Helios has recently returned from getting an awful lot of food from your employers.",
      "Leroy and Elverna have an enormous stock pot full of oxtail broth, chicken and rice, homemade fruit spread and strawberry chocolate chip cookies 'for when you're better.'",
      "Leroy sneaked some beer he brewed himself with the instructions that the alcohol kills the germs faster.",
      "I was not present to correct him on his faulty medical advice.\"",
      "\"I also got stuff from Blake at the Big Bean - ginger tea, and your friend Amelia got you banana bread from the store's bakery, and this balloon.\"",
      "There is a balloon, floating near the ceiling, that Icarus hadn't noticed at first.",
      "It was originally blank, and has been written on in marker: 'At least it's not chlamydia.",
      "Get back to work soon you lazy fuckwit.\"",
      "Amelia, Joey, and several others have signed it.",
      "Icarus sneezes and stands up on his own, dragging the comforter with him to wrap around his shoulders.",
      "\"I have the best friends.",
      "And the best boyfriends.",
      "Let's watch something on Netflix and eat some of this food.\""

    "text": "He doesn't have quite the same power here, in Canada, as he did in Greece. It's to do with continental vs maritime climates, even though the latitude isn't much different. His rays touch the earth the same here in Quebec, but there's no Mediterranean Sea to keep the heat around. Which is a bummer - Helios remembers winning a bet with Boreas, centuries ago in Greece, about which of the two of them could get a man to strip down to nothing. Helios' heat made the job easy (and once he determined how easy it was, it became one of his favorite pastimes). But that same trick wouldn't work here in Canada - more's the pity, because there's one specific young man he'd like to influence that way. But Helios can be persistent. It's just a matter of dialing up the charm to 11 and keeping it there. He'll wear the kid down. Today he's loafing around in Icarus' apartment, enjoying the sweet feeling of being lazy while Apollo's up there working. Working hard, from what Helios can tell - the sun slanting through the cheap blinds in Icarus' windows is throwing off a lot of heat. He can see clear skies as well, when he glances out - nothing to stop cold Canada from being hit with as much sunlight as Apollo can throw at it. Icarus should be home soon. Both gods have committed his schedule to memory, in order to maximize the amount of time they can spend pestering the boy (as well as divvying up a fair amount of time for each of them to spend on said pestering. That had come after a lot of arguments and a few \"solar mishaps\" and Athena coming over to yell at them and threatening to get Zeus involved in splitting up time with Icarus, a la Persephone or Adonis). This, too, is another thing that's different from how it was in the Old Days in Greece. Icarus' time is at a premium, which is what led to the scuffling. The boy is constantly at class, at work, doing homework, or on his way to do one of those things. He doesn't get enough sleep and half the time he's so distracted with his tasks that he doesn't eat, forcing the gods, of all people, to remind him (usually Apollo, but whatever). And his schedule is non-negotiable, mandating that he be in place, and stay in place, at exactly the prescribed hours, no matter if any important immortal beings feel otherwise. It's irritating as fuck, if you're a near-omnipotent god and you want to play with your mortal, only to keep getting told he's not available. He and Apollo carve some time out of Icarus' day by transporting him to his locations, but Helios thinks that if this kid doesn't take some time off over the summer break (summer! When he and Apollo would be at their strongest and sexiest!), he's going to personally drag the kid off to one of the uninhabited islands in Greece and keep him there where he has no choice but to relax for a change. Helios hears the sound of a key in the door, and he looks up from where he's been drawing dicks and amusing cartoons all over Icarus' study notes, to see the boy walking in wearily and dropping his heavy book satchel on the table. \"Heyyyyy, Mop-Head! Took you long enough! You don't have nearly enough prn to keep a guy entertained waiting for you - \" Icarus groans loudly. \"First of all, Helios, I know I've told you to quit hanging out here when I'm not around, it's creepy, and secondly, you don't need my - I mean - you're, like, a thousand years old, you don't need adult entertainment to keep you busy.\" Helios is much older than a thousand years, but he lets the point slide, sidling over to hang over Icarus' shoulders with a lascivious grin. \"Heh. Well, it's true that I can see a lot of more fun ways to keep myself busy now that you're back.\" As hoped, his words net him a cute little blush from the mortal, and Icarus' lips twitch before he shrugs Helios off. \"It'll have to wait. I gotta go out and walk a few dogs. You can come too, if you want...\" Helios gives Icarus an enormous, bone-creaking hug and a noogie just to annoy him. \"Sure thing, twerp. Hurry up! I wanna hang ooouuuutttt!\" Icarus rolls his eyes at the whining and heads towards the bathroom. \"Hang on a sec, I need to change into something lighter. It's hot out there.\" \"Oohh, let me help-!\" \"No way!!\" Icarus retorts before shutting the door in the sun god's face. Rude! The kid seems to have forgotten that Helios is the All-Seeing Eye Above. A cheap door isn't much of a deterrence for unfailing sight of everything... Helios sighs, pouting, and doesn't bother to cheat. If Icarus wants to be all stupidly shy and modest, fine. Helios will wear him down eventually. After a minute or so, Icarus re-emerges, wearing a light T-shirt with a familiar facial sketch on it - that Neil guy that Icarus admires so much - and is holding a tube of some kind of paste in his hand, daubing the contents onto his nose. Helios recognizes what it is and immediately lets out a screech, flinging himself back against the wall, away from Icarus, who gasps in alarm. \"Are you - Icarus!! Sunscreen!! Don't you know what that does to us??\" Wide-eyed and slack-jawed, Icarus gapes stupidly first at Helios and then down to the tube of sunscreen with dawning comprehension. \"It - affects you?! Shit, I didn't - here, I'll put it away - \" He flings the tube back into the bathroom, like that would have done anything at all, and frantically looks back at where Helios is still wailing against the wall. \"And on a Monday, too - don't you know the Moon's Day is when my powers are weakest!\" \"Shit, I'm sorry!! Can I help? Should I call Apollo?? Would suntan oil counteract the effects?? I can get some!!\" Icarus is wildly looking around for his wallet, like he's actually going to run out and buy suntan oil so he can save Helios' life, and that makes Helios finally crack up. \"Oh, fuck - nah, c'mon, you dumbass, obviously I was just fucking with you!\" he manages around laughter that makes his entire torso ache. Icarus has frozen in place where he is, watching Helios with an expression that is rapidly shifting from panic to that lovely look of annoyance. \"You're - not. Not dying.\" This sets Helios off again; he has tears in his eyes now. \"I'm basically invulnerable, you gotta know that!\" He waves a hand dismissively in the direction of the bathroom where that dangerous tube of sunscreen is. \"Your lame little titanium dioxide isn't gonna leave a scratch on a real TITAN. Jeez, you're the cutest little gullible dork I've ever met, and Mop-Head, I've met a lot.\" He snickers again but relents when he sees the put-out expression on Icarus' face. He glomps onto the boy, koala-style. \"But hey, dork or not, I'm really happy to see you were all set to go out and buy suntan oil to save me. You're my hero, Icarus!\" Icarus' lips twitch reluctantly, though he tries to hide it. \"I didn't know where my wallet was. I was just going to have to steal it.\" \"Icarus!\" Helios' eyes light up. \"You rebel! That's even better!\" Icarus scoffs and rolls his eyes attempting to disengage from Helios' grabby arms. \"You're such an idiot. I don't know why I put up with you.\" He reaches up to pluck several labeled keys off his key rack: for the appropriate dog-containing houses, Helios guesses. \"It's because you looooooove me.\" \"That is definitely not it.\" A flick of his tail, and another of the trash cans leaps into flame. Mortals jump in surprise and alarm, then mill around frantically trying to put it out, and still trying to figure out why the trash cans are suddenly burning. It's not a dissimilar scene to the old days - mortals have always fairly anxious to interpret things that occur outside the norm. But back then, things randomly bursting into flame would have immediately been assumed to be a sign from one or another of the gods, and the only thing to figure out would have been which god and why. They probably wouldn't even bother tending to the fires until they'd found some other clues. A Greek from the old days would certainly have noticed a bright yellow cat watching the scene intently. Of course, they would have been puzzled by this choice of form. If Helios had really wanted them to know it was him, he would have chosen the form of a rooster, his most sacred animal. He likes roosters - the extravagant, pugnacious little shits - but they don't belong on a modern city street. Cats are really more Selene's animal, but Helios can take any damn form he feels like, and cat or rooster wouldn't make a difference now. These mortals have no idea what they're looking for. Helios' cat eyes narrow at the older man backing away from one fire. Helios had encountered the man a few minutes. Ago. This man has offended him. In the old days, Helios would have revealed his identity and the man would have fallen over himself apologizing. He would have dropped to the earth and begged forgiveness, promising to make a sacrifice twice a day to show his respect for the Titan. And Helios perhaps would, and perhaps wouldn't, have let the mortal off the hook. He flicks his tail; another trash can nearer to the man is alight. The man jumps and begins running down the street. Helios rises on four paws, watching him go, considering what he should do next. Perhaps set the guy's shoes on fire. They're ugly enough... No. Pointless. The guy wouldn't make the connection. It would be meaningless. He has no idea what he did wrong. Helios' tail lashes in frustration. Fuck this - he'll go burn some steam on his chariot. The yellow cat vanishes, leaving the mortals to put out their fires. A few hours later, the sun has set and Helios is still in a vacant lot outside the city limits, practicing tricks on the motorcycle and feeling ready to fight the world, when Apollo appears. The younger god appears abruptly and with no fanfare for a change, in the path of Helios' motorcycle as it's charging through the air from a jump. Helios draws the chariot to a halt inches from Apollo's face; the beautiful and stoic expression doesn't change. \"Bad day?\" Apollo asks rhetorically. Helios snorts and considers for a moment, before killing the engine and climbing off. \"You could say that.\" He stalks over to an old concrete pipe and hops up on top of it; Apollo follows sedately. They sit in silence for a moment, watching their sisters in the distance, starting their nightly horsing around in the sky. After a while,Helios finally forces himself to talk. \"Thanks for taking care of the sunset tonight.\" Apollo shrugs. \"It was no problem.\" He sips his tea, which he of course has with him, and he looks completely out of place with his neatly coiffed hair and pressed clean suit and shiny shoes and teacup, sitting around in an empty lot full of junk and Helios. Apollo clears his throat politely. \"Icarus asked after you earlier. Why don't we go back and visit?\" \"Nah. I'm still pissed.\" \"At Icarus?\" \"No! Obviously not! I just can't see him right now.\" This is something Helios doesn't like to articulate, and he doesn't know if Apollo feels the same way, but Helios strongly enjoys Icarus' comfort around him. Icarus is calm and wry and unintimidated by the gods, and Helios doesn't know if that comfort would survive a godly temper outburst, but better not to test it: he really wants to win the kid over. Apollo sips his tea again. \"You want to tell me what's wrong, Grandpa?\" Helios snorts laughter reluctantly. \"Grandpa, heh. Yeah. I'm an old gramps up there, and a noisy stupid brat down here.\" \"Ahh,\" Apollo says softly, in understanding. \"Fucking, it's just - no respect at all anymore, you know? People treat me like, like I'm just an annoying asshole. And I know, I play it up sometimes, but...\" He sighs. \"People used to worship me. Now I'm just a 'brat.' I keep forgetting I don't mean anything to anyone.\" \"It's just what happened when we decided to withdraw from daily mortal life,\" Apollo says, a note of wistfulness in his voice. It isn't easy for him, either, Helios knows. Pretty young mortals used to throw themselves at him. \"And you know that's not true, anyway. Icarus knows you for who you are.\" \"Yeah...\" Brief and soft, Apollos' fingertips graze under Helios' chin, turning his face slightly to face him. Apollo presses a kiss to Helios' cheek. Apollo, who hoards his kisses to Helios like precious gems, and only doles them out in small bits so that Helios will never get bored - Apollo's kiss is warm and scented like honey and flowers and sunshine. It's over too quickly and Apollo drops his fingers to take Helios' hand in his own. \"And unlike other nicknames, 'Grandpa' is used with affection and acknowledgement. We all know you for who you are.\" \"Shut up, asshole,\" Helios snarls, voice catching slightly, face reddening noticeably. Apollo smiles and doesn't reply, only sipping his tea with one hand and holding onto Helios with the other, content to sit quietly for the moment in their off-hours, until eventually Helios declares it's time to go see if Icarus is still awake. Today, Helios decides he'd like to travel a bit, in the chariot. This is one thing Canada's got going for it: long, long roads that wind through wilderness. The roads in Greece are choppier. There's always another hill or mountain range, and the coast is omnipresent. Obviously, these aren't obstacles for a god (particularly when the chariot usually roars across the sky), but Helios enjoys matching that freedom in his mortal form as well. The roads of northern Canada are heavily wooded, with animals that would put the beasts of the Heroic Age of Greece to shame for size and fearsomeness. Helios loves it. It's not his usual environment, obviously, but it still reminds him of old times. He has the incredible good fortune to be present when Icarus finds out that his usual Monday classes are both canceled for faculty emergencies, his work shift had already been switched to another day (and *no,* Helios did not orchestrate this), and Helios latches onto the opportunity to drag the mortal off for an impromptu road trip. The kid squawks and fusses, as per usual, but Helios ignores him and sets him on the back of the motorcycle, and they take off, headed north. Icarus clings to him tightly: arms wrapped around Helios' slim frame, hands clasped over the god's midsection. The mortal gets nervous about riding without any safety equipment, and at the kinds of speeds Helios likes. For the first stretch of their road trip, he lectures Helios on road safety in a cross, pedantic voice. Like he thinks it's actually possible for Helios to get in an accident. Even if they did, it's not like Helios couldn't step in to protect Icarus (not that there's a good precedent for that, but still...). Helios alternately scoffs at his concerns, and teases him by performing jumps and wheelies and taking corners far too fast, just to hear the little startled yelp and feel the hands clutch him tighter. \"You're such a jerk! That was like, twenty-three different laws you broke doing that!!\" \"Can't stop won't stop!\" Helios hollers back gleefully, before he blasts Another Brick in the Wall from a radio that shouldn't exists on the motorcycle. He can tell from the way Icarus is shaking that the kid's trying not to laugh - or, well, maybe he's actually scared. Hard to tell, since Helios is responsibly keeping his eyes on the road. After a while, Icarus stops complaining, and just watches the scenery as they ride further north, into the uninhabited wild. \"It's really pretty out here, away from the city,\" he observes. \"Yeah. I like coming out here, eating up some miles. It's a good way to kill time. The forests and lakes up here are awesome. I bet Artemis loves it.\" \"I'm kind of surprised you love it so much. I thought you were, you know, the wild guy? The rebel.\" \"I like to make a scene,\" Helios agrees, revving the engine for no other purpose than to emphasize. He's about to go on, and explain that he's about freedom, and that he loves not being beholden to rules or expectations, and how being out here in the middle of nowhere means there aren't any rules or expectations to bother with. Making a scene, being rebellious... that only exists in the context of being around other people. It's unnecessary out here. He doesn't say this, though, and instead he opens a portal ahead of them - a tear in the fabric of the world, opening to inky blackness. Behind him, Icarus squawks. \"Helios, you don't have to make a scene right now to prove to me that you're crazy!!\" Helios laughs and adds flames to the outside of the portal, just because. \"Hold on, Mop-Head! Here comes Broken Law Number Twenty-Four!\" He revs the engine again and roars through the burning portal, delighting in the alarmed curse that comes from Icarus. The space between worlds is the way it always is: darkness that stretches to infinity, filled and illuminated with sparkling stars in the distance. Icarus has seen this before, but he still goes quiet and stares around in awe. Helios is preparing to open another portal back to the mortal world, but has an idea. He brings the motorcycle to a halt, idling the engine, and puts his hand over Icarus's own. \"Hey, Mop-Head. Swap spots with me.\" Icarus stiffens. \"W-what? Why?\" \"Where we're going, I have to concentrate. In order to keep you safe, you know? And I know you're all about safety. So you drive for a minute.\" \"Wait wait wait, no way, I read about this, about - someone crashed this chariot before?!\" That was Phaethon. One of Helios' sons. Helios squeezes Icarus' hand before half-turning and putting his hands about the mortal's waist. \"C'mon, nerd. It'll be fine. See? Because you'll be sitting here like this - \" he pulls Icarus out of his seat, watching in amusement as Icarus grips Helios' sleeves tight enough to make his knuckles white. Helios pulls him safely around, repositioning Icarus so that their positions are reversed. Icarus now sits in front of Helios, back pressed to Helios' front. \"...And I'll be right here to help drive. Sheesh. Anyone would think you'd never driven before.\" He keeps his tone light. His hands are over Icarus'; they're a little shaky against the handlebars. \"O-okay. Where... where are we going?\" Helios presses against him, resting his chin on Icarus' shoulder and grinning. He snaps his fingers and another flaming portal appears. \"Aim for that!\" \"Do there have to be flames?\" Icarus whines. \"Obviously!\" Helios kicks the chariot into action and with a small gasp, Icarus steers them through the portal......into another scene of darkness. This one has a few more landscape details: an expanse of ocean stretches below them, black and reflecting the dark sky and the glittering stars, and also - \"Oh, wow,\" Icarus breathes. The aurora australis stretches across the sky, twisting and flowing and shifting and reflecting on the water. Icarus spots his sister Eos in the distance, happily painting the shimmering lights through the atmosphere. She catches sight of him and waves, then covers her mouth and squeals in delight when she sees his passenger. Helios winks. Icarus doesn't spot the goddess, he's too busy gaping at her handiwork. \"Oh - oh wow,\" he says again. \"I've - I think I saw the Northern Lights once, when I was a kid they made it far enough south...\" \"These aren't the Northern Lights,\" Helios tells him, steering the chariot, since Icarus is completely distracted. He keeps one hand on Icarus' waist and radiates warmth through the mortal's body. Icarus hasn't felt it yet, but it's quite cold here. \"Not...? Oh. Because it's summer in the Northern Hemisphere. So these - you took us south? This is the aurora australis?\" \"Yup! We're in the Ross Sea. Little ways northeast off the coast of Antarctica.\" \"...It should be cold.\" \"It is cold, kiddo. Lucky for you, you've got your own personal heater sitting back here.\" Helios hums a bit and sings, softly: \"I'm too hot, hot damn! Call the police and the fireman, too hot, hot damn! Make a dragon wanna-\" His joke earns him an elbow to the gut. He oofs and chuckles, and they fall to silence. Icarus can't stop staring as Helios cruises them around. Eos, darling little sister that she is, goes above and beyond in painting the sky with the swirls of colored light. It reflects perfectly across the water, mirrored dancing lights. No one else is present; it goes without saying that Helios is free here, too, so he settles into a pleasant mood. \"...Thanks for showing me,\" Icarus says after a while. \"Hey, no problemo, Mop-Head. If there's one thing Helios is known for, it's bringing magic into the lives of mortals.\" He's prepared for a neat segue into other ways Helios can bring magic to Icarus' life, but the mortal cuts him off, sounding excited and nerdy now. \"It's solar wind, reacting to the Earth's atmosphere, right? Specifically, the way the magnetosphere reacts, in the form of ionization which-\" Helios groans. \"Eww, you fucking nerd, no science on date night!!\" He's annoying Icarus again, clinging to the boy while he's trying to go out the door. Icarus is doing that thing where he's scowling and scolding Helios while simultaneously trying not to laugh at his antics, which might be Helios' second-favorite look on him. All at once, Helios' superior vision lands on the work schedule, where it's printed and held to the refrigerator with a magnet, and his eyes narrow. \"Hey - you're not going to class! It's not on your schedule!\" Icarus freezes and bites his lip nervously, turning his face away. Everything in his posture and expression tells Helios he's feeling embarrassed rather than guilty, so Helios immediately discards any notion of being angry or offended, in favor of being very interested, nosy and mischievous. He grins, tightens his grip around Icarus and begins poking him. \"You weren't lying to me, were you, Mop-Head? You know that's a bad idea!\" Icarus' face is burning red - yes! Helios' first-favorite look on him! The mortal tries to frown severely, undermined by his own embarrassment and the way he's starting to squirm. \"I'm not - not really! It's technically for a class, sort of!\" \"'Not technically?' You're really going to try to talk your way out of this with technicalities? With a god?\" Helios tweaks Icarus' ribs, grin widening as Icarus yelps and swears. \"Better 'fess up, kiddo! You don't want me to drag the truth out of you!\" \"F-fine! Ugh, you're insufferable! It's - it is for a class, sort of, it's - I need to go out and get something for - an event.\" \"Yes? An event? Go on,\" Helios instructs cheerfully. \"It's for the World History class. We're doing a fundraiser. That's all.\" Helios sighs and cracks his knuckles theatrically. Icarus gasps and grabs at his hands. \"Okay, okay! We're doing a - a toga night. And I need to get something to wear so I'm going downtown to Costumes By Jove. Okay? Are you happy now??\" Helios goes stock still. \"You're doing a toga party.\" \"I didn't want to say anything because I knew you'd be unbearable, you'd be so annoying about it, the worst..!\" Helios chuckles darkly. \"Oh, kid. Oh, you have no idea how worst it's gonna be. Apollo is gonna shit himself at the chance to dress you up in the old style!\" \"No, come on, don't tell him-\" Icarus starts to plead, his face so red it must be a little sore. Helios ignores him and hollers. \"YO APOOP, GET DOWN HERE!! STAT!\" \"...Good afternoon, Icarus. What is it, Helios?\" Apollo must have been lurking nearby, planning to drop by, the stalky creep. Helios grins at him. \"Call me 'Sol' now, buddy - and you, you're Phoebus again!\" \"What are you talking about? Icarus? What's going on?\" Icarus has buried his face in his hands and only shakes his head in mute reply, so it falls on Helios to tell the tale. \"Mop-Head here just invited us both to a toga party he's having at his school!\" \"I did not invite you-\" \"...So we gotta come up with a good outfit for him! I still got my old short chiton, and you can wear your old towel-rags, but what do you think for him?\" \"A chlamys. Like Hermes wore sometimes.\" Apollo's eyes had gone wide and Helios could swear his pupils were dilated at the thought of playing dress-up with Icarus. \"Oh, yeah, a chlamys is a good look! With nothing underneath? It's pretty warm out now...\" \"What the hell is a chlamys - this is a toga party!\" \"Yes, Icarus, but I've noticed that none of you actually know what a toga is - at least, very few attendees of these sorts of parties wear one correctly. Togas are the decorative wrap, that encircles a tunic. Most of the time, you all just wear chitons, which are Greek. But I think we can do better for you.\" Apollo has summoned his sketchbook and a pencil and is busily and nerdily scratching away at the paper as he talks. He shows Icarus what he's drawn. \"This is a chlamys.\" \"NOPE.\" \"It would look very attractive on you, and it's lightweight --\" \"EVERYONE WOULD SEE MY DICK AND MY BUTT, APOLLO.\" \"Well, and so?\" \"It's a nice set you have going on there,\" Helios agrees, moments before they're both treated to one of the funniest tantrums they've seen from Icarus yet. There's really no way Icarus could have known. It's not like Helios is prone to going for long walks with the kid, out in the park or the countryside, where they're likely to come across any frogs. And while Icarus is familiar with most of the old tales of the gods, there are lesser-known myths that he hasn't heard or read yet. It's just as well he hasn't heard the one about the frogs. Except that means that Icarus has innocently purchased a pajama set for Helios - a onesie, in bright green, with a hood on top designed to look like a frog. It's in his size and is presented in a bright green-and-yellow wrapped box with a sun sticker on it, and Icarus is actually smiling excitedly when he gives it to Helios. \"I saw it at the store where I work and thought of you immediately! I thought it was pretty cute and I got Joey to help me wrap it up in a nice box. Anyway, I hope you like it!\" Icarus never buys anything besides the necessities. He's constantly, tediously monitoring his bank account and working and won't even buy himself his favorite dessert, to save money. But apparently, as a joke some time ago, Apollo told him that Helios loves frogs, and Icarus saw these one-piece frog pajamas and was moved to buy them for Helios as a gift from the heart. He apparently never heard of the time, three thousand years ago, when Helios was considering getting married and settling down, and all the frogs of Greece had sought an audience before Zeus and protested about Helios. \"If he gets married and there's two of them up there, all the swamps are gonna dry up! And what if the two of them spawn even more baby suns?! Honestly, isn't one of him bad enough already?!\" they had complained. Zeus had laughed for hours afterwards, and once the other gods had heard the story, it became a running joke where they'd discreetly place a frog statuette at the door of any nymph Helios was attempting to bed, calling it \"the chaperone.\" Occasionally at dinners or parties one of them would randomly start giggling \"isn't one of him bad enough already?!\" and the place would dissolve into laughter. So actually, Helios thinks frogs are incredibly annoying and stupid, whiny little assholes, and if Zeus hadn't expressly forbidden it, Helios would've fried them all out of existence centuries ago. But here's Icarus, holding out the frog-hoodie pajamas and beaming expectantly, so Helios grins back and gives him a ferocious noogie and a hug, and thanks him. And puts the damn thing on. Later, in his rooms in Olympus, Helios glumly surveys his reflection in the mirror. Undeniably froggy. He considers whether wearing a leather jacket over it would make it better - but no, it really wouldn't. He'll just wear it as it was intended, as pajamas, Helios decides. And only when he's actually cuddling with Icarus, in his apartment, on the couch or in his bed. They're actually quite comfy, and the colors suit him very well. Aside from the terrible theme, they'd look pretty cute on him. By Uranus' Mighty Balls, though, Helios cannot let any other god see this. They would be insufferable. As though it senses that it's being thought of, a frog croaks somewhere in the weeds outside the window. \"Screw you, you piece of shit!\" he snarls automatically, flinging a raised middle finger in the direction of the croak. \"You fuckers are all lucky I make this shitty outfit look good!\" Helios defected, along with his sisters, in the war against the Titans. This was a long time before Apollo was born. These younger gods - \"Octopus,\" is what Hermes calls them, because there are eight second-generation Olympians if you count Aphrodite, and an Octopus has eight legs...whatever, Hermes is such a fucking dork. Anyway, the \"Octopus Gods\" or whatever they call themselves, are almost as young to Helios and his sisters, as Icarus is to the Octopus Gods. Helios was there before humanity; and he was there when Kronos ran the show, in the Golden Age, which was when humanity was its happiest, although not its smartest. The humans quite long then, by their standards, and were peaceful and never had to work, and interacted with the Titans freely. The arrival of Zeus marked the end of this era. Helios remembers the young Zeus, clad in beggar's rags, sacrificing a bull - a huge, glorious, very impressive bull, seriously where did he even find this beast? - to Helios, in an effort to win the Titan's favor in the impending war against the rest of the existing pantheon of giants. Helios had accepted, and advised his sisters to stay with him and decline to participate in the war, defecting and betraying their cousins. And now the three of them are the only Titans around to see the next Ages of Man: The Silver Age, marked by sin and disrespect for the new pantheon of gods, and Zeus' displeasure at them all and ultimately destroying them entirely. Then, the Bronze Age, marked by tough violent people. Ares had liked them but not many others did. The Iron Age was supposedly the current age, though Helios thinks they may be in some post-Iron Age by now. In any case, in this age, humanity is at their worst. Humans exist in misery, toiling daily to eke out their living; lies and dishonor are the norm; no one feels shame for any wrongdoing and the gods have forsaken humanity. The gods of Olympus routinely grumble that they've been stuck in this wretched Iron Age for too long now. Helios, who sees all, thinks this uncharitable. The humans don't generally fare much worse than the gods in terms of nobility or depravity, and with far less time to learn from their mistakes. As strained as relations often are now, between gods and mortals or humanity among itself, Helios prefers it over the mindless pretty vapid things the humans were before. None of these Olympians were around for that, though. At least the modern humans are constantly trying to improve themselves... the gods aren't much different from who they were two and a half millennia ago. He's thinking about this one morning, when he's prowling in Icarus' bedroom and watching him sleep. He surprises Icarus by singing \"Good Morning!\" from Singin' in the Rain and landing on top of him in bed with a heavy bounce. Icarus gasps and bolts upright, wildly pushing away at the invader in his bed, blinking owlishly with his mouth hanging open. The kid's hair is a disaster, sticking out in every direction like Helios' own aureole crown, and he's wearing one of the stupid tank tops from Hermes' prank, wherein he replaced every shirt in Icarus' wardrobe with a brightly colored tank that says \"sun's out guns out\". Icarus gapes at Helios and looks like he's not completely caught up to where they are or who he's looking at. Helios grins at him, holding up a phone to take a picture. \"Like I've been saying for a while now, Mop-Head - or make that Shock-Head - your generation is the pinnacle of humanity. Here's the proof-oof!\" Jeez, you pay a guy a compliment in the morning, and what do you get for your trouble but a pillow to the face! (See the end of the chapter for notes.) Helios tackles Icarus the moment he walks in the door, home from his nerdy job at the flower shop. Icarus drops his satchel and yelps as Helios wrestles him over to the couch, lifting him off his feet as they go, hugging him tightly. \"You always keep me waiting, Mop-Head!\" \"Helios!! Leggo!! You're squeezing too hard, I can't even breathe!!\" Icarus complains, pushing at Helios again in their usual routine. His feet kick in the air; it's pretty cute. Helios drops them both onto the couch, laughing into Icarus' shirt before messing up his hair with one hand and blowing a quick raspberry into his neck, producing a lovely musical squeal while Icarus starts punching him in a fruitless attempt to dislodge the god. Helios pouts at him while ignoring the feeble blows. \"Icarus, I don't know if I approve of all this violence in a boyfriend. I prefer a tender lover, you know?\" Icarus has given up and is laughing now. \"If that's what will get rid of you, I'm willing to try - Hey! Get your hand off my butt!\" \"Ahh yes, the ass so nice I gotta pinch it twice,\" Helios teases, doing so to hear the little noise Icarus makes. \"But no! I accept only kisses, no fists!\" \"I-is that what it takes to get you off?\" Icarus pants, then blanches and groans as he realizes what he said. Helios doesn't let it slide, choosing to leer and lean in closer. \"As a matter of fact, yes, but in a very specific manner, and-\" He's shut up by the feeling of Icarus' hand covering his eyes, blocking his vision, and then the sensation of Icarus' lips on his. Icarus is still breathing a little heavy from the impromptu wrestling match and the laughter, and he smells like cheap soap and strawberries and sunshine. His kiss is not nearly as skilled as Apollo's - a little too hard and at an awkward angle - but the spontaneity and affection in the kiss shuts Helios up completely and stuns him to the point where he doesn't manage to kiss back until just as the boy is pulling away. He reaches up to take hold of Icarus' wrist and pull his hand away, raising his eyebrows in disbelief as he stares at Icarus, who is blushing and smiling and looking both shy and proud at once. \"Th-there. You big whiner. Now get offa me!\" Icarus says, a little laughter still in his voice as he shoves Helios, who's still stunned enough that he gets knocked over onto the floor. \"Hey, hey, not fair, I wasn't ready for that! Do-over! Another try!\" Icarus snorts and throws the couch pillow at Helios - a favorite deflection for him. \"Ha! Nope! When you least expect it! Maybe tomorrow if you're lucky.\" \"But tomorrow's the Moon's Day!\" Icarus looks like he's about to retort something, probably rightly making fun of Helios' weak argument, but instead he gives Helios a smirk. \"Hmm. Let me think about it,\" he teases. ***Aesop, Fables (from Babrius, Fabulae Aesopeae 18) (trans. Gibbs) (Greek fable C6th B.C.): \"Boreas (the North Wind) and Helios (the Sun) disputed as to which was the most powerful, and agreed that he should be declared the victor who could first strip a wayfaring man of his clothes. Boreas (the North Wind) first tried his power and blew with all his might, but the keener his blasts, the closer the traveler wrapped his cloak around him, until at last, resigning all hope of victory, the Wind called upon Helios (the Sun) to see what he could do. Helios (the Sun) suddenly shone out with all his warmth. The traveler no sooner felt his genial rays than he took off one garment after another, and at last, fairly overcome with heat, undressed and bathed in a stream that lay in his path. Persuasion is better than force.\"***",

      "Can I help?",
      "Should I call Apollo??",
      "Would suntan oil counteract the effects??",
      "I can get some!!\"",
      "Icarus is wildly looking around for his wallet, like he's actually going to run out and buy suntan oil so he can save Helios' life, and that makes Helios finally crack up.",
      "\"Oh, fuck - nah, c'mon, you dumbass, obviously I was just fucking with you!\"",
      "he manages around laughter that makes his entire torso ache.",
      "Icarus has frozen in place where he is, watching Helios with an expression that is rapidly shifting from panic to that lovely look of annoyance.",
      "\"You're - not.",
      "Not dying.\"",
      "This sets Helios off again; he has tears in his eyes now.",
      "\"I'm basically invulnerable, you gotta know that!\"",
      "He waves a hand dismissively in the direction of the bathroom where that dangerous tube of sunscreen is.",
      "\"Your lame little titanium dioxide isn't gonna leave a scratch on a real TITAN.",
      "Jeez, you're the cutest little gullible dork I've ever met, and Mop-Head, I've met a lot.\"",
      "He snickers again but relents when he sees the put-out expression on Icarus' face.",
      "He glomps onto the boy, koala-style.",
      "\"But hey, dork or not, I'm really happy to see you were all set to go out and buy suntan oil to save me.",
      "You're my hero, Icarus!\"",
      "Icarus' lips twitch reluctantly, though he tries to hide it.",
      "\"I didn't know where my wallet was.",
      "I was just going to have to steal it.\"",
      "\"Icarus!\"",
      "Helios' eyes light up.",
      "\"You rebel!",
      "That's even better!\"",
      "Icarus scoffs and rolls his eyes attempting to disengage from Helios' grabby arms.",
      "\"You're such an idiot.",
      "I don't know why I put up with you.\"",
      "He reaches up to pluck several labeled keys off his key rack: for the appropriate dog-containing houses, Helios guesses.",
      "\"It's because you looooooove me.\"",
      "\"That is definitely not it.\"",
      "A flick of his tail, and another of the trash cans leaps into flame.",
      "Mortals jump in surprise and alarm, then mill around frantically trying to put it out, and still trying to figure out why the trash cans are suddenly burning.",
      "It's not a dissimilar scene to the old days - mortals have always fairly anxious to interpret things that occur outside the norm.",
      "But back then, things randomly bursting into flame would have immediately been assumed to be a sign from one or another of the gods, and the only thing to figure out would have been which god and why.",
      "They probably wouldn't even bother tending to the fires until they'd found some other clues.",
      "A Greek from the old days would certainly have noticed a bright yellow cat watching the scene intently.",
      "Of course, they would have been puzzled by this choice of form.",
      "If Helios had really wanted them to know it was him, he would have chosen the form of a rooster, his most sacred animal.",
      "He likes roosters - the extravagant, pugnacious little shits - but they don't belong on a modern city street.",
      "Cats are really more Selene's animal, but Helios can take any damn form he feels like, and cat or rooster wouldn't make a difference now.",
      "These mortals have no idea what they're looking for.",
      "Helios' cat eyes narrow at the older man backing away from one fire.",
      "Helios had encountered the man a few minutes.",
      "Ago.",
      "This man has offended him.",
      "In the old days, Helios would have revealed his identity and the man would have fallen over himself apologizing.",
      "He would have dropped to the earth and begged forgiveness, promising to make a sacrifice twice a day to show his respect for the Titan.",
      "And Helios perhaps would, and perhaps wouldn't, have let the mortal off the hook.",
      "He flicks his tail; another trash can nearer to the man is alight.",
      "The man jumps and begins running down the street.",
      "Helios rises on four paws, watching him go, considering what he should do next.",
      "Perhaps set the guy's shoes on fire.",
      "They're ugly enough...",
      "No. Pointless.",
      "The guy wouldn't make the connection.",
      "It would be meaningless.",
      "He has no idea what he did wrong.",
      "Helios' tail lashes in frustration.",
      "Fuck this - he'll go burn some steam on his chariot.",
      "The yellow cat vanishes, leaving the mortals to put out their fires.",
      "A few hours later, the sun has set and Helios is still in a vacant lot outside the city limits, practicing tricks on the motorcycle and feeling ready to fight the world, when Apollo appears.",
      "The younger god appears abruptly and with no fanfare for a change, in the path of Helios' motorcycle as it's charging through the air from a jump.",
      "Helios draws the chariot to a halt inches from Apollo's face; the beautiful and stoic expression doesn't change.",
      "\"Bad day?\"",
      "Apollo asks rhetorically.",
      "Helios snorts and considers for a moment, before killing the engine and climbing off.",
      "\"You could say that.\"",
      "He stalks over to an old concrete pipe and hops up on top of it; Apollo follows sedately.",
      "They sit in silence for a moment, watching their sisters in the distance, starting their nightly horsing around in the sky.",
      "After a while,Helios finally forces himself to talk.",
      "\"Thanks for taking care of the sunset tonight.\"",
      "Apollo shrugs.",
      "\"It was no problem.\"",
      "He sips his tea, which he of course has with him, and he looks completely out of place with his neatly coiffed hair and pressed clean suit and shiny shoes and teacup, sitting around in an empty lot full of junk and Helios.",
      "Apollo clears his throat politely.",
      "\"Icarus asked after you earlier.",
      "Why don't we go back and visit?\"",
      "\"Nah. I'm still pissed.\"",
      "\"At Icarus?\" \"No! Obviously not!",
      "I just can't see him right now.\"",
      "This is something Helios doesn't like to articulate, and he doesn't know if Apollo feels the same way, but Helios strongly enjoys Icarus' comfort around him.",
      "Icarus is calm and wry and unintimidated by the gods, and Helios doesn't know if that comfort would survive a godly temper outburst, but better not to test it: he really wants to win the kid over.",
      "Apollo sips his tea again.",
      "\"You want to tell me what's wrong, Grandpa?\"",
      "Helios snorts laughter reluctantly.",
      "\"Grandpa, heh.",
      "Yeah.",
      "I'm an old gramps up there, and a noisy stupid brat down here.\"",
      "\"Ahh,\" Apollo says softly, in understanding.",
      "\"Fucking, it's just - no respect at all anymore, you know?",
      "People treat me like, like I'm just an annoying asshole.",
      "And I know, I play it up sometimes, but...\" He sighs.",
      "\"People used to worship me.",
      "Now I'm just a 'brat.'",
      "I keep forgetting I don't mean anything to anyone.\"",
      "\"It's just what happened when we decided to withdraw from daily mortal life,\" Apollo says, a note of wistfulness in his voice.",
      "It isn't easy for him, either, Helios knows.",
      "Pretty young mortals used to throw themselves at him.",
      "\"And you know that's not true, anyway.",
      "Icarus knows you for who you are.\"",
      "\"Yeah...\" Brief and soft, Apollos' fingertips graze under Helios' chin, turning his face slightly to face him.",
      "Apollo presses a kiss to Helios' cheek.",
      "Apollo, who hoards his kisses to Helios like precious gems, and only doles them out in small bits so that Helios will never get bored - Apollo's kiss is warm and scented like honey and flowers and sunshine.",
      "It's over too quickly and Apollo drops his fingers to take Helios' hand in his own.",
      "\"And unlike other nicknames, 'Grandpa' is used with affection and acknowledgement.",
      "We all know you for who you are.\"",
      "\"Shut up, asshole,\" Helios snarls, voice catching slightly, face reddening noticeably.",
      "Apollo smiles and doesn't reply, only sipping his tea with one hand and holding onto Helios with the other, content to sit quietly for the moment in their off-hours, until eventually Helios declares it's time to go see if Icarus is still awake.",
      "Today, Helios decides he'd like to travel a bit, in the chariot.",
      "This is one thing Canada's got going for it: long, long roads that wind through wilderness.",
      "The roads in Greece are choppier.",
      "There's always another hill or mountain range, and the coast is omnipresent.",
      "Obviously, these aren't obstacles for a god (particularly when the chariot usually roars across the sky), but Helios enjoys matching that freedom in his mortal form as well.",
      "The roads of northern Canada are heavily wooded, with animals that would put the beasts of the Heroic Age of Greece to shame for size and fearsomeness.",
      "Helios loves it.",
      "It's not his usual environment, obviously, but it still reminds him of old times.",
      "He has the incredible good fortune to be present when Icarus finds out that his usual Monday classes are both canceled for faculty emergencies, his work shift had already been switched to another day (and *no,* Helios did not orchestrate this), and Helios latches onto the opportunity to drag the mortal off for an impromptu road trip.",
      "The kid squawks and fusses, as per usual, but Helios ignores him and sets him on the back of the motorcycle, and they take off, headed north.",
      "Icarus clings to him tightly: arms wrapped around Helios' slim frame, hands clasped over the god's midsection.",
      "The mortal gets nervous about riding without any safety equipment, and at the kinds of speeds Helios likes.",
      "For the first stretch of their road trip, he lectures Helios on road safety in a cross, pedantic voice.",
      "Like he thinks it's actually possible for Helios to get in an accident.",
      "Even if they did, it's not like Helios couldn't step in to protect Icarus (not that there's a good precedent for that, but still...).",
      "Helios alternately scoffs at his concerns, and teases him by performing jumps and wheelies and taking corners far too fast, just to hear the little startled yelp and feel the hands clutch him tighter.",
      "\"You're such a jerk!",
      "That was like, twenty-three different laws you broke doing that!!\"",
      "\"Can't stop won't stop!\"",
      "Helios hollers back gleefully, before he blasts Another Brick in the Wall from a radio that shouldn't exists on the motorcycle.",
      "He can tell from the way Icarus is shaking that the kid's trying not to laugh - or, well, maybe he's actually scared.",
      "Hard to tell, since Helios is responsibly keeping his eyes on the road.",
      "After a while, Icarus stops complaining, and just watches the scenery as they ride further north, into the uninhabited wild.",
      "\"It's really pretty out here, away from the city,\" he observes.",
      "\"Yeah.",
      "I like coming out here, eating up some miles.",
      "It's a good way to kill time.",
      "The forests and lakes up here are awesome.",
      "I bet Artemis loves it.\"",
      "\"I'm kind of surprised you love it so much.",
      "I thought you were, you know, the wild guy?",
      "The rebel.\"",
      "\"I like to make a scene,\" Helios agrees, revving the engine for no other purpose than to emphasize.",
      "He's about to go on, and explain that he's about freedom, and that he loves not being beholden to rules or expectations, and how being out here in the middle of nowhere means there aren't any rules or expectations to bother with.",
      "Making a scene, being rebellious... that only exists in the context of being around other people.",
      "It's unnecessary out here.",
      "He doesn't say this, though, and instead he opens a portal ahead of them - a tear in the fabric of the world, opening to inky blackness.",
      "Behind him, Icarus squawks.",
      "\"Helios, you don't have to make a scene right now to prove to me that you're crazy!!\"",
      "Helios laughs and adds flames to the outside of the portal, just because.",
      "\"Hold on, Mop-Head!",
      "Here comes Broken Law Number Twenty-Four!\"",
      "He revs the engine again and roars through the burning portal, delighting in the alarmed curse that comes from Icarus.",
      "The space between worlds is the way it always is: darkness that stretches to infinity, filled and illuminated with sparkling stars in the distance.",
      "Icarus has seen this before, but he still goes quiet and stares around in awe.",
      "Helios is preparing to open another portal back to the mortal world, but has an idea.",
      "He brings the motorcycle to a halt, idling the engine, and puts his hand over Icarus's own.",
      "\"Hey, Mop-Head.",
      "Swap spots with me.\"",
      "Icarus stiffens.",
      "\"W-what?",
      "Why?\"",
      "\"Where we're going, I have to concentrate.",
      "In order to keep you safe, you know?",
      "And I know you're all about safety.",
      "So you drive for a minute.\"",
      "\"Wait wait wait, no way, I read about this, about - someone crashed this chariot before?!\"",
      "That was Phaethon.",
      "One of Helios' sons.",
      "Helios squeezes Icarus' hand before half-turning and putting his hands about the mortal's waist.",
      "\"C'mon, nerd.",
      "It'll be fine.",
      "See? Because you'll be sitting here like this - \" he pulls Icarus out of his seat, watching in amusement as Icarus grips Helios' sleeves tight enough to make his knuckles white.",
      "Helios pulls him safely around, repositioning Icarus so that their positions are reversed.",
      "Icarus now sits in front of Helios, back pressed to Helios' front.",
      "\"...And I'll be right here to help drive.",
      "Sheesh.",
      "Anyone would think you'd never driven before.\"",
      "He keeps his tone light.",
      "His hands are over Icarus'; they're a little shaky against the handlebars.",
      "\"O-okay.",
      "Where... where are we going?\"",
      "Helios presses against him, resting his chin on Icarus' shoulder and grinning.",
      "He snaps his fingers and another flaming portal appears.",
      "\"Aim for that!\"",
      "\"Do there have to be flames?\" Icarus whines.",
      "\"Obviously!\"",
      "Helios kicks the chariot into action and with a small gasp, Icarus steers them through the portal......into another scene of darkness.",
      "This one has a few more landscape details: an expanse of ocean stretches below them, black and reflecting the dark sky and the glittering stars, and also - \"Oh, wow,\" Icarus breathes.",
      "The aurora australis stretches across the sky, twisting and flowing and shifting and reflecting on the water.",
      "Icarus spots his sister Eos in the distance, happily painting the shimmering lights through the atmosphere.",
      "She catches sight of him and waves, then covers her mouth and squeals in delight when she sees his passenger.",
      "Helios winks.",
      "Icarus doesn't spot the goddess, he's too busy gaping at her handiwork.",
      "\"Oh - oh wow,\" he says again.",
      "\"I've - I think I saw the Northern Lights once, when I was a kid they made it far enough south...\" \"These aren't the Northern Lights,\" Helios tells him, steering the chariot, since Icarus is completely distracted.",
      "He keeps one hand on Icarus' waist and radiates warmth through the mortal's body.",
      "Icarus hasn't felt it yet, but it's quite cold here.",
      "\"Not...?",
      "Oh.",
      "Because it's summer in the Northern Hemisphere.",
      "So these - you took us south?",
      "This is the aurora australis?\" \"Yup!",
      "We're in the Ross Sea.",
      "Little ways northeast off the coast of Antarctica.\"",
      "\"...It should be cold.\"",
      "\"It is cold, kiddo.",
      "Lucky for you, you've got your own personal heater sitting back here.\"",
      "Helios hums a bit and sings, softly: \"I'm too hot, hot damn!",
      "Call the police and the fireman, too hot, hot damn!",
      "Make a dragon wanna-\" His joke earns him an elbow to the gut.",
      "He oofs and chuckles, and they fall to silence.",
      "Icarus can't stop staring as Helios cruises them around.",
      "Eos, darling little sister that she is, goes above and beyond in painting the sky with the swirls of colored light.",
      "It reflects perfectly across the water, mirrored dancing lights.",
      "No one else is present; it goes without saying that Helios is free here, too, so he settles into a pleasant mood.",
      "\"...Thanks for showing me,\" Icarus says after a while.",
      "\"Hey, no problemo, Mop-Head.",
      "If there's one thing Helios is known for, it's bringing magic into the lives of mortals.\"",
      "He's prepared for a neat segue into other ways Helios can bring magic to Icarus' life, but the mortal cuts him off, sounding excited and nerdy now.",
      "\"It's solar wind, reacting to the Earth's atmosphere, right?",
      "Specifically, the way the magnetosphere reacts, in the form of ionization which-\" Helios groans.",
      "\"Eww, you fucking nerd, no science on date night!!\"",
      "He's annoying Icarus again, clinging to the boy while he's trying to go out the door.",
      "Icarus is doing that thing where he's scowling and scolding Helios while simultaneously trying not to laugh at his antics, which might be Helios' second-favorite look on him.",
      "All at once, Helios' superior vision lands on the work schedule, where it's printed and held to the refrigerator with a magnet, and his eyes narrow.",
      "\"Hey - you're not going to class!",
      "It's not on your schedule!\"",
      "Icarus freezes and bites his lip nervously, turning his face away.",
      "Everything in his posture and expression tells Helios he's feeling embarrassed rather than guilty, so Helios immediately discards any notion of being angry or offended, in favor of being very interested, nosy and mischievous.",
      "He grins, tightens his grip around Icarus and begins poking him.",
      "\"You weren't lying to me, were you, Mop-Head?",
      "You know that's a bad idea!\"",
      "Icarus' face is burning red - yes!",
      "Helios' first-favorite look on him!",
      "The mortal tries to frown severely, undermined by his own embarrassment and the way he's starting to squirm.",
      "\"I'm not - not really!",
      "It's technically for a class, sort of!\"",
      "\"'Not technically?'",
      "You're really going to try to talk your way out of this with technicalities?",
      "With a god?\"",
      "Helios tweaks Icarus' ribs, grin widening as Icarus yelps and swears.",
      "\"Better 'fess up, kiddo!",
      "You don't want me to drag the truth out of you!\"",
      "\"F-fine!",
      "Ugh, you're insufferable!",
      "It's - it is for a class, sort of, it's - I need to go out and get something for - an event.\"",
      "\"Yes?",
      "An event?",
      "Go on,\" Helios instructs cheerfully.",
      "\"It's for the World History class.",
      "We're doing a fundraiser.",
      "That's all.\"",
      "Helios sighs and cracks his knuckles theatrically.",
      "Icarus gasps and grabs at his hands.",
      "\"Okay, okay!",
      "We're doing a - a toga night.",
      "And I need to get something to wear so I'm going downtown to Costumes By Jove.",
      "Okay?",
      "Are you happy now??\" Helios goes stock still.",
      "\"You're doing a toga party.\"",
      "\"I didn't want to say anything because I knew you'd be unbearable, you'd be so annoying about it, the worst..!\"",
      "Helios chuckles darkly.",
      "\"Oh, kid.",
      "Oh, you have no idea how worst it's gonna be.",
      "Apollo is gonna shit himself at the chance to dress you up in the old style!\"",
      "\"No, come on, don't tell him-\" Icarus starts to plead, his face so red it must be a little sore.",
      "Helios ignores him and hollers.",
      "\"YO APOOP, GET DOWN HERE!!",
      "STAT!\"",
      "\"...Good afternoon, Icarus.",
      "What is it, Helios?\"",
      "Apollo must have been lurking nearby, planning to drop by, the stalky creep.",

      "\"Call me 'Sol' now, buddy - and you, you're Phoebus again!\"",
      "\"What are you talking about?",
      "Icarus?",
      "What's going on?\" Icarus has buried his face in his hands and only shakes his head in mute reply, so it falls on Helios to tell the tale.",
      "\"Mop-Head here just invited us both to a toga party he's having at his school!\"",
      "\"I did not invite you-\" \"...",
      "So we gotta come up with a good outfit for him!",
      "I still got my old short chiton, and you can wear your old towel-rags, but what do you think for him?\"",
      "\"A chlamys.",
      "Like Hermes wore sometimes.\"",
      "Apollo's eyes had gone wide and Helios could swear his pupils were dilated at the thought of playing dress-up with Icarus.",
      "\"Oh, yeah, a chlamys is a good look!",
      "With nothing underneath?",
      "It's pretty warm out now...\" \"What the hell is a chlamys - this is a toga party!\"",
      "\"Yes, Icarus, but I've noticed that none of you actually know what a toga is - at least, very few attendees of these sorts of parties wear one correctly.",
      "Togas are the decorative wrap, that encircles a tunic.",
      "Most of the time, you all just wear chitons, which are Greek.",
      "But I think we can do better for you.\"",
      "Apollo has summoned his sketchbook and a pencil and is busily and nerdily scratching away at the paper as he talks.",
      "He shows Icarus what he's drawn.",
      "\"This is a chlamys.\"",
      "\"NOPE.\"",
      "\"It would look very attractive on you, and it's lightweight --\" \"EVERYONE WOULD SEE MY DICK AND MY BUTT, APOLLO.\"",
      "\"Well, and so?\"",
      "\"It's a nice set you have going on there,\" Helios agrees, moments before they're both treated to one of the funniest tantrums they've seen from Icarus yet.",
      "There's really no way Icarus could have known.",
      "It's not like Helios is prone to going for long walks with the kid, out in the park or the countryside, where they're likely to come across any frogs.",
      "And while Icarus is familiar with most of the old tales of the gods, there are lesser-known myths that he hasn't heard or read yet.",
      "It's just as well he hasn't heard the one about the frogs.",
      "Except that means that Icarus has innocently purchased a pajama set for Helios - a onesie, in bright green, with a hood on top designed to look like a frog.",
      "It's in his size and is presented in a bright green-and-yellow wrapped box with a sun sticker on it, and Icarus is actually smiling excitedly when he gives it to Helios.",
      "\"I saw it at the store where I work and thought of you immediately!",
      "I thought it was pretty cute and I got Joey to help me wrap it up in a nice box.",
      "Anyway, I hope you like it!\"",
      "Icarus never buys anything besides the necessities.",
      "He's constantly, tediously monitoring his bank account and working and won't even buy himself his favorite dessert, to save money.",
      "But apparently, as a joke some time ago, Apollo told him that Helios loves frogs, and Icarus saw these one-piece frog pajamas and was moved to buy them for Helios as a gift from the heart.",
      "He apparently never heard of the time, three thousand years ago, when Helios was considering getting married and settling down, and all the frogs of Greece had sought an audience before Zeus and protested about Helios.",
      "\"If he gets married and there's two of them up there, all the swamps are gonna dry up!",
      "And what if the two of them spawn even more baby suns?!",
      "Honestly, isn't one of him bad enough already?!\"",
      "they had complained.",
      "Zeus had laughed for hours afterwards, and once the other gods had heard the story, it became a running joke where they'd discreetly place a frog statuette at the door of any nymph Helios was attempting to bed, calling it \"the chaperone.\"",
      "Occasionally at dinners or parties one of them would randomly start giggling \"isn't one of him bad enough already?!\"",
      "and the place would dissolve into laughter.",
      "So actually, Helios thinks frogs are incredibly annoying and stupid, whiny little assholes, and if Zeus hadn't expressly forbidden it, Helios would've fried them all out of existence centuries ago.",
      "But here's Icarus, holding out the frog-hoodie pajamas and beaming expectantly, so Helios grins back and gives him a ferocious noogie and a hug, and thanks him.",
      "And puts the damn thing on.",
      "Later, in his rooms in Olympus, Helios glumly surveys his reflection in the mirror.",
      "Undeniably froggy.",
      "He considers whether wearing a leather jacket over it would make it better - but no, it really wouldn't.",
      "He'll just wear it as it was intended, as pajamas, Helios decides.",
      "And only when he's actually cuddling with Icarus, in his apartment, on the couch or in his bed.",
      "They're actually quite comfy, and the colors suit him very well.",
      "Aside from the terrible theme, they'd look pretty cute on him.",
      "By Uranus' Mighty Balls, though, Helios cannot let any other god see this.",
      "They would be insufferable.",
      "As though it senses that it's being thought of, a frog croaks somewhere in the weeds outside the window.",
      "\"Screw you, you piece of shit!\"",
      "he snarls automatically, flinging a raised middle finger in the direction of the croak.",
      "\"You fuckers are all lucky I make this shitty outfit look good!\"",

      "These younger gods - \"Octopus,\" is what Hermes calls them, because there are eight second-generation Olympians if you count Aphrodite, and an Octopus has eight legs...whatever, Hermes is such a fucking dork.",
      "Anyway, the \"Octopus Gods\" or whatever they call themselves, are almost as young to Helios and his sisters, as Icarus is to the Octopus Gods.",
      "Helios was there before humanity; and he was there when Kronos ran the show, in the Golden Age, which was when humanity was its happiest, although not its smartest.",
      "The humans quite long then, by their standards, and were peaceful and never had to work, and interacted with the Titans freely.",
      "The arrival of Zeus marked the end of this era.",
      "Helios remembers the young Zeus, clad in beggar's rags, sacrificing a bull - a huge, glorious, very impressive bull, seriously where did he even find this beast?",
      "- to Helios, in an effort to win the Titan's favor in the impending war against the rest of the existing pantheon of giants.",
      "Helios had accepted, and advised his sisters to stay with him and decline to participate in the war, defecting and betraying their cousins.",
      "And now the three of them are the only Titans around to see the next Ages of Man: The Silver Age, marked by sin and disrespect for the new pantheon of gods, and Zeus' displeasure at them all and ultimately destroying them entirely.",
      "Then, the Bronze Age, marked by tough violent people.",
      "Ares had liked them but not many others did.",
      "The Iron Age was supposedly the current age, though Helios thinks they may be in some post-Iron Age by now.",
      "In any case, in this age, humanity is at their worst.",
      "Humans exist in misery, toiling daily to eke out their living; lies and dishonor are the norm; no one feels shame for any wrongdoing and the gods have forsaken humanity.",
      "The gods of Olympus routinely grumble that they've been stuck in this wretched Iron Age for too long now.",
      "Helios, who sees all, thinks this uncharitable.",
      "The humans don't generally fare much worse than the gods in terms of nobility or depravity, and with far less time to learn from their mistakes.",
      "As strained as relations often are now, between gods and mortals or humanity among itself, Helios prefers it over the mindless pretty vapid things the humans were before.",
      "None of these Olympians were around for that, though.",
      "At least the modern humans are constantly trying to improve themselves...",
      "the gods aren't much different from who they were two and a half millennia ago.",
      "He's thinking about this one morning, when he's prowling in Icarus' bedroom and watching him sleep.",
      "He surprises Icarus by singing \"Good Morning!\"",
      "from Singin' in the Rain and landing on top of him in bed with a heavy bounce.",
      "Icarus gasps and bolts upright, wildly pushing away at the invader in his bed, blinking owlishly with his mouth hanging open.",
      "The kid's hair is a disaster, sticking out in every direction like Helios' own aureole crown, and he's wearing one of the stupid tank tops from Hermes' prank, wherein he replaced every shirt in Icarus' wardrobe with a brightly colored tank that says \"sun's out guns out\".",
      "Icarus gapes at Helios and looks like he's not completely caught up to where they are or who he's looking at.",
      "Helios grins at him, holding up a phone to take a picture.",
      "\"Like I've been saying for a while now, Mop-Head - or make that Shock-Head - your generation is the pinnacle of humanity.",
      "Here's the proof-oof!\"",
      "Jeez, you pay a guy a compliment in the morning, and what do you get for your trouble but a pillow to the face!",
      "(See the end of the chapter for notes.)",
      "Helios tackles Icarus the moment he walks in the door, home from his nerdy job at the flower shop.",
      "Icarus drops his satchel and yelps as Helios wrestles him over to the couch, lifting him off his feet as they go, hugging him tightly.",
      "\"You always keep me waiting, Mop-Head!\"",
      "\"Helios!!",
      "Leggo!!",
      "You're squeezing too hard, I can't even breathe!!\"",
      "Icarus complains, pushing at Helios again in their usual routine.",
      "His feet kick in the air; it's pretty cute.",
      "Helios drops them both onto the couch, laughing into Icarus' shirt before messing up his hair with one hand and blowing a quick raspberry into his neck, producing a lovely musical squeal while Icarus starts punching him in a fruitless attempt to dislodge the god.",
      "Helios pouts at him while ignoring the feeble blows.",
      "\"Icarus, I don't know if I approve of all this violence in a boyfriend.",
      "I prefer a tender lover, you know?\" Icarus has given up and is laughing now.",
      "\"If that's what will get rid of you, I'm willing to try - Hey!",
      "Get your hand off my butt!\"",
      "\"Ahh yes, the ass so nice I gotta pinch it twice,\" Helios teases, doing so to hear the little noise Icarus makes.",
      "\"But no! I accept only kisses, no fists!\"",
      "\"I-is that what it takes to get you off?\" Icarus pants, then blanches and groans as he realizes what he said.",
      "Helios doesn't let it slide, choosing to leer and lean in closer.",
      "\"As a matter of fact, yes, but in a very specific manner, and-\" He's shut up by the feeling of Icarus' hand covering his eyes, blocking his vision, and then the sensation of Icarus' lips on his.",
      "Icarus is still breathing a little heavy from the impromptu wrestling match and the laughter, and he smells like cheap soap and strawberries and sunshine.",
      "His kiss is not nearly as skilled as Apollo's - a little too hard and at an awkward angle - but the spontaneity and affection in the kiss shuts Helios up completely and stuns him to the point where he doesn't manage to kiss back until just as the boy is pulling away.",
      "He reaches up to take hold of Icarus' wrist and pull his hand away, raising his eyebrows in disbelief as he stares at Icarus, who is blushing and smiling and looking both shy and proud at once.",
      "\"Th-there.",
      "You big whiner.",
      "Now get offa me!\"",
      "Icarus says, a little laughter still in his voice as he shoves Helios, who's still stunned enough that he gets knocked over onto the floor.",
      "\"Hey, hey, not fair, I wasn't ready for that!",
      "Do-over!",
      "Another try!\"",
      "Icarus snorts and throws the couch pillow at Helios - a favorite deflection for him.",

      "When you least expect it!",
      "Maybe tomorrow if you're lucky.\"",
      "\"But tomorrow's the Moon's Day!\"",
      "Icarus looks like he's about to retort something, probably rightly making fun of Helios' weak argument, but instead he gives Helios a smirk.",

    "text": "Icarus is on the floor, back pressed into the carpet. Apollo - one of the two sun gods who've attached themselves to Icarus - is on top of him. Mounted over him. Apollo is shirtless, revealing the cut of perfect muscles. His soft, neatly coiled hair tumbles over his bare shoulders as he leans over Icarus. The gold tattoos gleam against warm, dark skin. He's wearing pants at least, but without his usual belt, so the pants lay low enough that that V-line of muscle running from Apollo's hips down to... his crotch... are clearly visible... The heat of the sun god is palpable. Icarus can feel it easily, through the thin cloth of his sweatpants and T-shirt. The heat is warm on his lower belly, where Apollo's weight is barely pressing down, and along his waist, where Apollo's thighs are pressed against his torso... Mouth dry, Icarus looks up at Apollo, who is staring down at him, a small smile on his lips. \"So, do you feel ready to try it?\" Apollo says, and there's a note of amused patience in his voice, indicating that he may have said this once or twice already. \"...Huh..?\" Icarus manages. This prompts a chuckle out of Apollo. \"I asked if you're ready to try the move.\" \"Oh - uh...\" The reason they're in this position at all, is because Apollo has taken it upon himself to show Icarus some self-defense moves. This is probably Icarus' own fault. He'd seen The Rock on TV, which made him think of wrestling, and he'd made a polite observation to Apollo about how the Greek men had seemed to enjoy wrestling, and was modern wrestling very similar to how it was then? Which had led to Apollo discovering that Icarus has no clue about wrestling, has no clue about fighting, has minimal control of coordinating his body beyond walking and sitting. Looking increasingly horrified, Apollo had asked what Icarus ever planned to do if he was attacked. Icarus, who hadn't given it much thought, had shrugged and said he'd probably hope the attacker got bored and left him alone quickly. Which has led to Apollo's mandatory self-defense/martial arts training. Icarus had protested; had tried complaining to Helios (sometimes he could redirect them to annoying each other, rather than him. Unfortunately, this time it didn't work, and Helios only snickered and said Icarus was lucky Apollo didn't decide to bring Ares in on this training). So now, this week's lesson is supposed to be about how to fight back when the attacker had you on the ground. But as with previous lessons, Icarus is finding it hard to concentrate with Apollo's body in such close proximity. His face flushes deeply and he's stammering out a reply when Apollo smirks again and presses a finger to Icarus' lips. \"Here, I'll walk you through the first time. Try to pay attention.\" Apollo straightens up and begins lightly cuffing Icarus' face, approximating punching him. \"You see, from this distance, I can strike you, but you can do little but try to block the punches. You can't reach me. So the first step is, you need to close the distance. Grab me around the waist and pull me in close to you.\" Icarus makes a choking noise that he covers up with a cough, and reaches up to obey. Apollo's skin is so warm, Icarus could swear he can feel the heat surging from his palms and up to his shoulders, to his chest, radiating to everywhere... he wraps his arms around Apollo's waist (it's not a hug, it's not a hug), and pulls him in close. Way, way too fucking close. The god's face is inches from his now, and his body is right there. \"Good. Now I'm here, close to you,\" Apollo is saying, voice floating into Icarus' ear from inches away. His breath wisps across Icarus' neck. \"So I can't hit you very well. You've briefly stopped the attack, so now it's time to try to switch so that you're in the dominant position on top.\" Icarus knows Apollo is choosing these words on purpose. \"Hook your right leg behind my left leg,\" Apollo continues, reaching behind to pluck Icarus' leg and position it. The heat spreads over Icarus' knee and he can feel all five fingers pressing into his skin. \"...Now my leg is trapped, good. Next, wrap your right arm around my left arm, trapping that. It'll prevent me from catching myself on that side.\" Mutely, Icarus obeys. They're totally hugging now. He's got one arm around Apollo's waist, one arm around his shoulder, his leg hooked around Apollo's leg - this is intimate, and Apollo knows it, and Icarus doesn't dare look at the god's face to see the knowing smirk there. \"Now, you need to plant your left foot into the floor, and thrust up with your hips.\" No way! \"...Yes, way,\" Apollo says, dryly, and apparently Icarus said that out loud?? \"This is how you'll flip us around. Drive up as forcefully as you can with your left leg, and use your left arm to chop up past my shoulder as well, to give yourself more momentum. Pushing off with your left leg will unbalance me, and roll us over to the other side.\" Icarus takes a couple of breaths to steady himself, and tries it, thrusting up with his hips with a grunt. There's.... groin-to-groin contact, but Apollo doesn't budge. Did that on purpose, Icarus knows it. \"Thrust harder,\" Apollo suggests. Icarus lets out his breath with a huff and tries again, this time successfully propelling his hip up against Apollo and pushing them over. Apollo hits the floor and rolls onto his back, and the momentum carries Icarus with him until he's sitting upright on top of Apollo, his hands on either side of the god's face. Icarus is startled. \"That - worked?\" He successfully performed the move, shifting the god's own body so that he was underneath Icarus. Yes, Apollo probably allowed it to happen, but still, Icarus did it! And, in all honesty... it's a little thrilling to be here, sitting on top of the god. Apollo's looking up at him from his place on the floor, ridiculously hot as always, and... Icarus likes it. A small, pleased grin spreads over his face, and a matching grin appears on Apollo's handsome visage. Apollo shifts, and Icarus suddenly feels fingers poking ticklishly into his ribs. He gasps and clamps his arms in protectively, collapsing onto Apollo's chest, where he's instantly wrapped up in the god's arms. He feels a light kiss, pressed into his hair, and then in a swirl of motion, their positions are reversed again: Icarus is on his back looking up into Apollo's face. He's still smiling; they both are. \"Good job, Icarus. Let's do it again.\"",

      "The heat of the sun god is palpable.",
      "Icarus can feel it easily, through the thin cloth of his sweatpants and T-shirt.",
      "The heat is warm on his lower belly, where Apollo's weight is barely pressing down, and along his waist, where Apollo's thighs are pressed against his torso...",
      "Mouth dry, Icarus looks up at Apollo, who is staring down at him, a small smile on his lips.",
      "\"So, do you feel ready to try it?\"",
      "Apollo says, and there's a note of amused patience in his voice, indicating that he may have said this once or twice already.",
      "\"...Huh..?\" Icarus manages.",
      "This prompts a chuckle out of Apollo.",
      "\"I asked if you're ready to try the move.\"",
      "\"Oh - uh...\" The reason they're in this position at all, is because Apollo has taken it upon himself to show Icarus some self-defense moves.",
      "This is probably Icarus' own fault.",
      "He'd seen The Rock on TV, which made him think of wrestling, and he'd made a polite observation to Apollo about how the Greek men had seemed to enjoy wrestling, and was modern wrestling very similar to how it was then?",
      "Which had led to Apollo discovering that Icarus has no clue about wrestling, has no clue about fighting, has minimal control of coordinating his body beyond walking and sitting.",
      "Looking increasingly horrified, Apollo had asked what Icarus ever planned to do if he was attacked.",
      "Icarus, who hadn't given it much thought, had shrugged and said he'd probably hope the attacker got bored and left him alone quickly.",
      "Which has led to Apollo's mandatory self-defense/martial arts training.",
      "Icarus had protested; had tried complaining to Helios (sometimes he could redirect them to annoying each other, rather than him.",
      "Unfortunately, this time it didn't work, and Helios only snickered and said Icarus was lucky Apollo didn't decide to bring Ares in on this training).",
      "So now, this week's lesson is supposed to be about how to fight back when the attacker had you on the ground.",
      "But as with previous lessons, Icarus is finding it hard to concentrate with Apollo's body in such close proximity.",
      "His face flushes deeply and he's stammering out a reply when Apollo smirks again and presses a finger to Icarus' lips.",
      "\"Here, I'll walk you through the first time.",
      "Try to pay attention.\"",
      "Apollo straightens up and begins lightly cuffing Icarus' face, approximating punching him.",
      "\"You see, from this distance, I can strike you, but you can do little but try to block the punches.",
      "You can't reach me.",
      "So the first step is, you need to close the distance.",
      "Grab me around the waist and pull me in close to you.\"",
      "Icarus makes a choking noise that he covers up with a cough, and reaches up to obey.",
      "Apollo's skin is so warm, Icarus could swear he can feel the heat surging from his palms and up to his shoulders, to his chest, radiating to everywhere... he wraps his arms around Apollo's waist (it's not a hug, it's not a hug), and pulls him in close.",
      "Way, way too fucking close.",
      "The god's face is inches from his now, and his body is right there.",
      "\"Good.",
      "Now I'm here, close to you,\" Apollo is saying, voice floating into Icarus' ear from inches away.",
      "His breath wisps across Icarus' neck.",
      "\"So I can't hit you very well.",
      "You've briefly stopped the attack, so now it's time to try to switch so that you're in the dominant position on top.\"",
      "Icarus knows Apollo is choosing these words on purpose.",
      "\"Hook your right leg behind my left leg,\" Apollo continues, reaching behind to pluck Icarus' leg and position it.",
      "The heat spreads over Icarus' knee and he can feel all five fingers pressing into his skin.",
      "\"...Now my leg is trapped, good.",
      "Next, wrap your right arm around my left arm, trapping that.",
      "It'll prevent me from catching myself on that side.\"",
      "Mutely, Icarus obeys.",
      "They're totally hugging now.",
      "He's got one arm around Apollo's waist, one arm around his shoulder, his leg hooked around Apollo's leg - this is intimate, and Apollo knows it, and Icarus doesn't dare look at the god's face to see the knowing smirk there.",
      "\"Now, you need to plant your left foot into the floor, and thrust up with your hips.\"",
      "No way!",
      "\"...Yes, way,\" Apollo says, dryly, and apparently Icarus said that out loud??",
      "\"This is how you'll flip us around.",
      "Drive up as forcefully as you can with your left leg, and use your left arm to chop up past my shoulder as well, to give yourself more momentum.",
      "Pushing off with your left leg will unbalance me, and roll us over to the other side.\"",
      "Icarus takes a couple of breaths to steady himself, and tries it, thrusting up with his hips with a grunt.",
      "There's.... groin-to-groin contact, but Apollo doesn't budge.",
      "Did that on purpose, Icarus knows it.",
      "\"Thrust harder,\" Apollo suggests.",
      "Icarus lets out his breath with a huff and tries again, this time successfully propelling his hip up against Apollo and pushing them over.",
      "Apollo hits the floor and rolls onto his back, and the momentum carries Icarus with him until he's sitting upright on top of Apollo, his hands on either side of the god's face.",
      "Icarus is startled.",
      "\"That - worked?\"",
      "He successfully performed the move, shifting the god's own body so that he was underneath Icarus.",
      "Yes, Apollo probably allowed it to happen, but still, Icarus did it!",
      "And, in all honesty... it's a little thrilling to be here, sitting on top of the god.",
      "Apollo's looking up at him from his place on the floor, ridiculously hot as always, and...",
      "Icarus likes it.",
      "A small, pleased grin spreads over his face, and a matching grin appears on Apollo's handsome visage.",
      "Apollo shifts, and Icarus suddenly feels fingers poking ticklishly into his ribs.",
      "He gasps and clamps his arms in protectively, collapsing onto Apollo's chest, where he's instantly wrapped up in the god's arms.",
      "He feels a light kiss, pressed into his hair, and then in a swirl of motion, their positions are reversed again: Icarus is on his back looking up into Apollo's face.",
      "He's still smiling; they both are.",
      "\"Good job, Icarus.",
      "Let's do it again.\""

    "text": "Helios is a very physical being - or at any rate, he is these days. His small and winsome little body is still somewhat new, by their standards. At some point, Helios had decided that after so many centuries of being tall and terrifying, it might be more fun to take a form that the mortals would find appealing. And now, having determined that yes, it is more fun to hug smiling humans than to terrify them, it's all he wants to do. When he isn't tormenting them for fun, anyway. At the moment, he's efficiently combining hugs and torment at once, with Icarus on the receiving end of Helios's affections. The god had abruptly announced that he's bored and wants Icarus to entertain him, and glomps onto the boy koala-style. He then begins mischievously poking fingers into his ribs and armpits. Icarus makes a weird, choking noise and scrunches his face up, adorably trying to frown in disapproval at the same time that laughter threatening to pour loose from him. He twists away and shoves at Helios in an attempt to dislodge the god, but to no avail. Helios snickers in triumph as he gleefully teases the human. At one point Icarus pleads for Apollo to intervene and \"get this annoying jerk off me!\" Apollo doesn't; not immediately. He, too, enjoys the sound of Icarus's reluctant laughter. But after a moment he determines that something else would make this situation even funnier. He waits until both are sufficiently distracted, and then reaches over to pluck Helios off of Icarus, quickly catching him up in a headlock. He uses all of the strength he has as a god to hold the titan in place. Helios has already figured out what's going on and squawks in protest, struggling. \"I suggest you make the most of this,\" Apollo nods at Icarus, who is staring in dawning realization, a grin of pure malice forming on his face. \"No way. No. Way. Helios?!\" \"You better not, you brat, I swear I'm gonna -!\" Whatever threat the god had in in mind is lost as Helios squeals in sudden laughter. Icarus has taken Apollo's advice and started tickling Helios's belly, with immediate results. Helios is wildly ticklish, improbably so, and he folds like wet paper, giggling shrilly. Apollo isn't certain where this puts them in the standings. Helios is the one with Icarus's fingers dancing over his skin. Icarus is grinning at Helios, delighted to watch the elder god squirm under the influence of Icarus's touch. The intimacy is theirs. But watching the embarrassment and indignity radiating off Helios is worth any concession of points. Apollo can regain the lead later; this shit is hilarious. Helios is trying to kick Icarus away but holding back at the same time - doubtless he's afraid of shattering the human's frail mortal body, so he can't even fight back effectively. Eventually he gives up and just hangs limp in Apollo's arms, giggling and utterly defeated. Apollo lets it continue until Helios begins glowing, a sign he's losing control of his vessel, and releases him then. Helios's recovery is fast. \"You're dead meat, mortal!\" he cries, launching himself at Icarus, who barely has time to yelp before Helios has him on the floor, tickling him senseless. Yes, it seems Apollo has forfeited intimacy points on this one, but he decides it was still worth it, to see first Helios and now Icarus in such a cute and entertaining state. Icarus is no match at all for Helios, but the god has mercy on him after a while. Icarus grabs his wrists and Helios lets him, though he still wriggles his fingers at him to make him giggle nervously. \"B-but wait, I mean, it was Apollo's idea, why don't you get him?!\" \"No point, mop-head. That guy isn't ticklish at all. Part of his whole identity of being no fun, you see.\" \"Aww.\" Apollo turns away, surprised to find his face coloring at the disappointment in both their voices. They clearly wish they could do the same to him. It's an interesting thought, but still, he thinks it best if he doesn't correct Helios's assertion. Apollo has kept his secret for thousands of years and has no intention of giving it up now.",

    "text": "One thing that sets Icarus apart from other humans Apollo has known, is his utter refusal to be impressed by the gods. There is no falling to his knees with this one; no awed, worshipful gazes. He wields sarcasm well and uses it frequently. He does not fall for their charms - or at least, Apollo has never seen any effect on him. Never. Apollo is able to make knees buckle with just one well-crafted look. He's able to make men and women alike swoon with a single phrase. Icarus only rolls his eyes and threatens to spray the god with cold water. It's the same with Helios. Certainly, for all he mocks his partner/rival, Apollo can privately agree that Helios can turn on the charm when he tries. He can take all his obnoxious arrogance and turn it into a cocky, flirtatious kind of appeal, when he tries. And he is definitely trying. Trying to impress the boy with tricks, with snark and jokes and his rebellious persona, and his wild motorcycle. Icarus wavers between being politely amused and deeply annoyed. This indifference is possibly the source, and certainly the fuel, for this competition between the gods. It's not as though the two of them need much incentive to set off another of their rivalries, but seducing the peevish Icarus is turning into more of an entertaining game. (\"Low stakes, this time,\" says Helios, when their friends ask. \"Just a little competition to see who can seduce Mop-Head first.\" \"That is almost exactly how Troy happened,\" Hermes points out. Helios and Apollo ignore him.) For a while, neither of them seem to gain much ground. Helios may arguably be leading by way of being the only one who has regular physical contact with the boy, but Icarus reliably responds by trying to bat the god away. (Hermes has observed that they tend to sabotage their own efforts as well. Helios teases Icarus relentlessly, and occasionally his teasing has an edge of cruelty to it. Apollo, apparently, \"lectures like a tenured professor on a rampage.\" As though gods and mortals alike could not benefit from a few helpful tips on style and health from the embodiment of perfection in both. Apollo haughtily informs Hermes that his opinion is noted) Apollo's first clear victory comes unexpectedly. He and Helios are in Icarus's apartment, waiting for the human to return from his classes. Apollo is examining the books Icarus keeps in his home. It's a varied collection: many battered textbooks on astronomy, as expected, but also a few oddities of fiction and one clearly cherished children's picture book, \"Magic School Bus Lost in the Solar System.\" Icarus's name is written in childish block letters on the inside cover. Apollo considers the notion of an infant Icarus looking through this book, eyes wide as he read of the improbable adventures of other children exploring space in their school bus, and perhaps imagining himself among them. Apollo wonders if this is the origin of Icarus's interest in space, and his determined goal to be the first man on the sun. He finds the idea utterly charming. It's at this moment that Icarus of the present-day returns, groaning when he sees the gods are there. He slouches over to his table, dragging his feet. Helios grins from where he's made himself at home on the couch, and sits up. \"Heya, Mop-Head! Glad you could make it!\" \"It's my apartment, Helios,\" Icarus sighs, before noticing the book in Apollo's hands. His face assumes a look of mildly embarrassed panic, and he rushes over to snatch the worn paperback away. \"That's just... a thing... uh...\" Apollo shrugs. \"It's less inaccurate than I would have expected of a children's book. Though not much use as an instructive manual if you were hoping to travel to space someday.\" He looks Icarus over, then, taking in the human before him: Icarus's shirt is partially untucked; shoes are untied; his sleeves are unevenly rolled; his collar is a mess; his hair is a mess. Apollo tsks. \"...More importantly, Icarus, is this how you allow yourself to look during the day, in your studies? How are you going to impress your professors if you dress like - like Helios?\" \"Hey!\" comes the objection from the god on the couch. Apollo's lips twitch but he doesn't acknowledge the other god, choosing instead to focus on Icarus. He begins straightening Icarus's sleeves, tugging one down and re-rolling it to match the other. \"You should be more attentive to how you present yourself, Icarus - it's the first impression anyone gets of you. It's true that you're a very clever young man, but you don't want people to dismiss your intelligence because you're dressed like a vagrant.\" (In his mind, he can hear \"tenured professor on a rampage\" in Hermes's voice, but he nobly ignores it) \"Especially since you have such an attractive foundation. You should take more pride in your appearance, Icarus, you're actually quite handsome.\" The collar is next. Apollo straightens and flattens it with his palms, using a small amount of the heat of the sun to press the lapels, brushing Icarus's neck with his fingers as he does so, before moving on to the rest of the shirt. He pulls out the hem of Icarus's shirt so that he can tuck it back in again, smoothly and properly, running his hand around Icarus's waist, beneath the band of his pants, and it's at that moment that he notices the hitch in Icarus's breathing. He pauses for a brief moment, hand stilled against Icarus's hips, feeling the warmth of flesh beneath the thin cotton. Icarus has frozen, staring at Apollo with a look that is very familiar to the god, though not on this particular human's face. Eyes enormous. Heart beginning to beat faster. Skittish, but... stirred. Interested. Apollo recovers himself and smoothly withdraws his hand, making certain to trace his fingers up over Icarus's belly. The human's breathing, already irregular, hiccups again and he shivers, very enticingly. Icarus's face is beet red now, which is new. Icarus is blushing. Apollo passes his hands lightly over Icarus's hair, neatening it and tucking a lock behind his ear. Finished, he then smiles at Icarus, pleased with his efforts, with the final product and with the clear effect he's had on the boy. He touches his fingers under Icarus's chin, tilting his face gently to a more fetching angle, rubbing a thumb over his jaw. \"Yes, very handsome, Icarus.\" Icarus's face goes even darker red, if possible, and his lips part slightly in a sweetly awkward half-smile before he finally unfreezes and jerks away to stumble towards his room, mumbling something nonsensical about putting his things away. There's an embarrassed \"thanks\" in there, though, and the boy is almost glowing. Apollo watches him flee into his room and then turns to bestow upon Helios, who is sulking and glowering from the doorway, the most superior and smug smirk Apollo can manage. Lord Apollo, god of prophecy and oracles, music, song and poetry, archery, and healing: triumphantly in the lead. All as it should be.",

    "text": "(Or: how Aphrodite fucked up everything while she was just trying to help. And how things were fixed without her help.) Hercules looked at his statue and just shrugged, seeing the result which was not really... brilliant, to say the least. \"Oh, Aphrodite will understand what I want...\" Yes, because, why would he care and why would he try to do something conscientious? It was just about... giving life to a human person, after all! Because yes, being less skilled than his teacher, Hercules' statue didn't look like a human person at all, but like something... really ugly and not done in a good way. Icarus raised an eyebrow. He may was not really clever, but he was sure that this... would not be enough. Hercules then summoned the Goddess of Love who appeared rapidly, and, if she was happy at first to see again her... half-brother? Nephew? Grand-nephew? (By the way, what kind of familial link does she share with him?) then, when she realized what he wanted, she felt a certain tiredness invade her. The truth is that, it wouldn't be happening if she didn't accept this to happen... She shouldn't be too much kind with human people, in fact, it was something which had been told to her a lot of time by Athena, who knew perfectly that to allow human to give life to someone they had created might be the worst idea she ever had. It was a kind action, but it didn't mean it was not stupid. And she knew that the goddess of wisdom was right, but she couldn't help but want to help them. Even if they were as stupid as Hercules could be at this moment... Correcting his work (hell, he really didn't know how to make a good statue. That was not surprising) and she began to burn with disapproval and fury as she heard what he wanted. Hey! Wasn't she already perfect the way she was? Why did he want more? \"So now, tell me, what about her personality? She asked to the semi-god.\" After all, it was a really important part of who Galatea was going to be. He frowned, as if he was surprised by her question. \"Her personality? Well... I didn't think about it. The goddess sent him death stares, but he didn't see them. I want her to be mad about me! He finally said, seeming to be really proud of himself.\" Her anger became even more great. What? What the hell was that? What about her intelligence? Her tastes? Her desires? Her aspirations? What about who she was going to be? What about who she really was? This young stupid man wanted all her life to turn around him and no one else, not even herself. Hell, even Pygmalion hadn't been that megalomaniac. Aphrodite looked at her (half-brother. Now, I will say half-brother, even if it is not really the case) half-brother, who was just waiting for her to realize his stupid wish. Couldn't he, well, she didn't know, just... look for a real and human girlfriend instead of trying to create this one? Human people could be really strange sometimes... (And it was just for a stupid ball...) So... he didn't want her to get a real personality? What the fuck was that? She thought again. Wh... just, what? And why? She blinked sometimes, trying to understand what he really wanted, before realizing this was what he wanted. Okay... Her half-brother was just stupid. A part of her wanted to go and leave right now, while the other really wanted to hit Hercules right behind the head for his stupidity. But she did none of these actions. The goddess rapidly made her choice, and decided that yes, she would play his game. But she would just change the rules. She would create Galatea, yes, but not as Hercules wanted her to be. She would give her a real personality. Make her being a real person, not just a doll with who the future hero could play and that he could give up then when he would be bored of her presence. And she would make her fall in love with Hercules, since it was the reason why he had called for her. Well... eventually... (Hell, she really shouldn't allow human to call for her and make her create human people. She could almost hear Athena's laugh resonate in her head.) She sighed, and tried to reason him one last time. \"Really? Is it really what you want? Just her being... in love with you, and nothing else? He shrugged again. - Yes, of course... I don't want to go to the ball alone, I need someone to be with me.\" He was stupid. Oh, by the gods (and by herself, by the way...). He. Was. Really. Stupid. Why the freaking hell? It was just for this? She nodded, and decided that she would do this, yes. But definitely differently. As she was beginning to prepare herself to cast her spell, she finally saw someone appear in front of her eyes, and she frowned with displeasure. Here was Athena, the famous goddess of wisdom, and who had just nothing to do here. Looking at her with interest and amusement, the goddess who had just arrived leaned on the wall and crossed her arms. Aphrodite raised a surprised eyebrow. \"What are you doing here Athena?\" Her... hum... half-sister? (well, since Aphrodite is either Zeus' or Uranus - kind of - daughter, depending of the version, not really...) Well, her kind-of-but-not-really niece/half-sister (if I can say that... Greek Mythology is such a mess...) just shrugged, still smiling. \"Well, I came here to see you try and fail this spell... she joked. Aphrodite frowned. - Aren't you supposed to be having an argument with your brother, Ares? - Since I am not supposed to be in this episode, the Author thought she could make something more interesting with my character... And I agree completely with her... Even if I know this is exactly what she wants me to do and think. She frowned. It's becoming really strange... And by the way, I came to see the \"writers\" of the show, to tell them I didn't want to do this anymore, and appear like a stupid teenager always quarreling with my brother. I am fed up of this. - Hum... okay, Aphrodite answered, not really understanding what the goddess meant. Then, she remembered what she had just said before. What do you mean by \"to fail this spell\"? Athena chuckled. - Since you always fail what you try to do... - WHAT? Why are you that petty Athena? - It's a provocation. The Author wants you to do some mistake, so, by telling you you can't do this spell, then, you will try to do this spell in order to prove me I'm wrong. What a brilliant plan, right? No. It was stupid, and Athena, as well as Aphrodite, knew it. And yet, they both knew that Aphrodite would indeed try. - Excuse-me, Hercules finally said with shyness, I... - Oh, excuse-me Hercules, I didn't see you... Happy to see you, so, you asked for a girlfriend, didn't you? Why don't you do like me and stay single?\" Aphrodite snorted delicately. \"Single? She muttered for herself. You didn't say that the other night...\" Athena sent her death stares. Oh yes, she remembered, they weren't supposed to talk about their secret relationship to someone else... After all, Athena had a reputation to protect! Aphrodite rolled her eyes. Fine, she wouldn't talk about her sexual relationship with Athena with anyone else! It was not as if she wanted to. \"Well, Hercules continued, not suspecting anything, the thing is that this ball is a really important thing for me, and it's a social ritual, so... I just can't go there alone. - You know, you're not forced to go there... - Please, could you stop talking and let me do my work? - As you want, Athena answered.\" And so did Aphrodite, concentrating herself in order to give both life AND a real personality to the young woman named Galatea. Little did she know things wouldn't work as she wanted them to do... And, some seconds later, Galatea was created and opened her eyes. To be continued... Galatea was... perfect. As she looked at her creation, Aphrodite couldn't help but send a smile of triumph to Athena, who had now an air of admiration on her face. The thing is that Aphrodite was quite proud of her work, and to say the truth, she had every rights to be. Long brown hairs, brown eyes... Galatea was truly beautiful, and according to Hercules' look, the goddess had done a really good work. She knew it, he would not go further than her simple beauty, and it was making her really angry (why did she accept to do this in fact? Oh yes, it's true, she was stupid) and she thought again that he was really an idiot. She didn't know Galatea yet (after all, she was just born at this moment), but she already knew that she was so much more than just her appearance. That was the reason why she wanted to give Hercules a lesson, and she hoped he would understand. Understand that yes, the personality of a woman (and of anyone else, by the way...) did matter, unlike what he seemed to think. Because, apart this stupid reflection, the young hero was (most of the time) a nice guy, so why would he think this right now? (Oh, yes, she had forgot that too... Bad writers...) Icarus had already left, not seeming to be that interested by what was happening just under his eyes (Aphrodite could have felt offended, but she didn't. It was not as if she cared about his point of view), and was probably with Cassandra, that he was... humph, humph... \"courting\" since a long, long time. Well, to be honest, the term \"harassing\" would have been much more pertinent to describe the fact that he was pursuing her since... a very long time (hell, he was doing this even before Hercules arrived in the school), and that, even if she told him no at every moments. This guy had serious difficulties to understand simple things as a simple NO. He must have been/flied too close from the... (STOP! This joke had been made too much times.) She still didn't know why no one had done anything against this behavior. Oh yes, she had also forgot that they were governed by a god who adored harassing mortals, women as men. Originally, in fact, in the mythology version, not in the Disney one. Version in which they were... (Yes, sometimes, breaking the fourth wall had no fucking sense.) As she finalized the rest of her spell, Aphrodite thought with irritation at Cassandra's poor loneliness, since her only friends were Hercules and Icarus (how she could be friend with this... stalker, yes, that was a good term to define him, was still a mystery for the goddess.), and the goddess told herself that it was completely unfair. It had to change. She didn't notice that her spell was not the way it was usually, because yes, if she wanted to give a personality to Galatea, she wanted also her to fall in love with Hercules, but her magic didn't work well this time. As Galatea began to move, surprised of being there, of being alive, the goddess smiled. \"Welcome to this world, Galatea. The young woman blinked two or three times, trying to adjust to this new universe she was just discovering at the instant. - Hello, she answered hesitantly. Who are you? - My name is Aphrodite, and I am the goddess of Beauty, of Love, and of many other things... - But certainly not the goddess of modesty, Athena added with a mocking smile, her arms still crossed against her chest. The other goddess rolled her eyes. - Says the one who proclaims herself as being the goddess of wisdom, but who always falls in Hades' silly traps. - As everyone, I would say, her lover answered her. - Why do we keep doing that, by the way? I mean, even if it's absurd, and even if he shouldn't be, we know that Hades is a villain here, but yet, we continue to trust him, even if we all know that all he wants it to get the Olympus for himself! This has no sense! Athena shrugged. - Writers want us to be stupid when it comes to Hades and his tricks. I don't think we can do anything against that. - And the thing is that this is not the subject here, the other goddess said. - So, Galatea continued, now that you told me who you were... Could you tell me who I am? I mean... I know what my name is, but this is really confused into my head. Where am I supposed to go? Who are my parents? Do I have parents? What are parents by the way? What am I supposed to do now? Athena snorted and chuckled a little, ignoring Aphrodite's death stares on her. - I can't believe it all started because our half-brother/nephew/this family tree is too complicated for me, just wanted a romance... - Oh, Athena, please, shut up! A lot of good stories are only based on romance, at the beginning at least. The goddess of wisdom raised an eyebrow. - Which one for example? - Well... ours, of course!\" Athena blushed and smiled. \"It was both incredibly cliche and cute at the same time, so... I guess you're right.\" Aphrodite laughed, relieved that she had succeeded to make the famous goddess of wisdom shut up, something which didn't arrive often. During the little chat between the goddess, Hercules hadn't stopped looking at Galatea, as if he couldn't believe in his luck. And soon, he would understand he was right. Oh, of course, he hadn't forgot Tempest at all, or his little crush on her, but since she had rejected him and that she had decided to go to the ball with Ajax (why on hell did she make this choice by the way?) and since according to Icarus, he had to go to this damn ball with a partner... (Here is the rule: never listen to this idiot. It seems that Hercules still didn't understand this.) Had he thought about it longer, he would have understood that it was a bad idea. Because yes, he just wanted a girlfriend (well, not even a girlfriend, just a woman to go with him, that was the reason why he had build one with clay, since no one had accepted to be with him in this ball) to go with him in a ball, to dance with him for some hours, and... And that was all... Yeah, that was not really thrilling, right? And then what? I mean... what would happen to Galatea after this ball? Her first questions had been really pertinent, in fact. Where would she go? What would she do? Who would she be? What would be her future after Hercules would stop to want her in his life? (In the show, you know what? She was not even evoked after the episode. Ha ha. Why am I not even surprised?) And it looks like Hercules' brain has been completely taken from him in this episode by the writers, since he didn't even think about it. Like: \"Hey, I created a woman because of a selfish desire and I have no idea of what is going to happen to her after this story is over! What could possibly go wrong?\" (A lot of things...) Stupid hero, Aphrodite and Athena both thought in unison. Stupid writers, added an angry Author, and the two goddess could just agree with her. Stupid scenario, the three of them realized. SSSSSSSS Decided to talk, Hercules hawked, and smiled at Galatea. \"Hello, Galatea... My name is Hercules. I am happy to meet you, and I wanted to ask you if you would accept to be my dance partner for tomorrow's ball (yes, I changed the date and I actually messed up with the time-line, as I always do. I guess... Do as if you saw nothing.).\" He was sure that the answer would be yes, because... hell, he asked to Aphrodite to get a girlfriend, so she was supposed to be his girlfriend, no? Even if he didn't know her and had just met her, that she didn't know him, that she was just born at the instant, and... Oh, hell, it was so stupid... Especially when you took in account the horrible and idiotic fact that he had wanted her to have no personality except a deep love for him. Yes, what could possibly go wrong? (That was sarcasm, for those who hadn't be enough attentive.) She raised a skeptical eyebrow, not seeming to be impressed by his discourse. \"Oh, really? Hum... Just after we met, just after I was born? You're a fast one, aren't you?\" Seeing Hercules' discountenanced face, and hearing Galatea unexpected answer, Athena couldn't help but burst into laughter. It was not really nice for the future hero, and she knew it, but hell, was it funny. \"Oh, so you gave her sarcasm and irony... I love it.\" Unlike her lover, Aphrodite had been more delicate, and only a light smile had come on her lips. \"Well, maybe I made her after you, she whispered with tenderness.\" This sentence totally worth it, since it made Athena send her a beautiful smile and gave her the most passionate kiss she ever gave to her. And Athena approved her sentence. \"She has got your elegance and my spirit. It's like she is almost our child! She then sent an excited smile to Aphrodite. Oh, please, can we adopt her? Aphrodite frowned, not paying attention anymore to the demigod and his certainly-not-at-all girlfriend, who seemed to be waiting for the end of their discussion. - You're being strangely childish, no? The goddess of wisdom just shrugged. - Well, I prefer much more to be childish in this way than in another one, like, you see, the one the writers predicted for me. Remember the episode: \"Hercules and the Secret Weapon\"? She shivered with contained horror. Well, I personally prefer not to do so. - I was not in this one, if I remember well. - Lucky you, the goddess muttered. It was one of the worst in which I was, if you want to know my point of view. - Yeah, for sure. According to the Author, most of the episodes were really, really bad. - So why does she write about it? - I don't know... Inspiration? Masochism? Desire to tell how much she doesn't like a show... by talking about this show? This is really confusing, she is strange. - Apparently, she loves this show, not for what it is, but for what it could be and also for what she can do of this one. It really inspires her in a strange way. - She is really strange by the way. - Wait, Hercules finally said, interfering in their talk, there is something I don't understand. First, I don't know what you're talking about - but this is not really important for me, to say the truth - and second... I asked for a girlfriend! Someone I could bring to the ball and who would love me! - Love... you? Galatea asked, seeming to be really surprised by the affirmation. I am sorry Hercules, you really seem to be a nice guy, but... you're clearly not my type. Hercules started and looked at Aphrodite with an angry air, while she was herself raising an eyebrow, surprised by the way the events were now turning. Because... it was for sure never supposed to happen this way. \"What? He asked. But... it was not supposed to be like that! I asked you to make her be mad of me! What the hell did you do exactly?\" Okay, so now, he was not just stupid, but also nasty. Aphrodite sighed. \"First, don't talk to me this way. Second, I did what I could do, I just guess the spell of love didn't work, for a reason I can't explain. Third, stop being a complete idiot Hercules and stop talking this way!\" In fact, the strongest reaction was coming from Galatea, who didn't wait and immediately slapped the idiot in the face (just like he deserved to be!) \"So, this is what I represent for you? Just a beautiful trophy you could bring to some party, some ball, and nothing else? I don't think this is how you would want to be treated by someone... I will come with you to your ball, Hercules, she added, because I want to help you, and I will dance a little with you, but that's all. - I'm sorry Galatea, I didn't mean... I realize I acted like an idiot and I don't really know why, the young man said, seeming like he was regaining his senses. - A bad writer, Athena answered, full of sympathy for him.\" She knew too much what it was... Then she stopped talking, hearing a sound coming from her pocket, and she took an object from it. And it was... a mobile phone. What the fuck? \"Hey! Aphrodite suddenly said, hearing the ring and seeing the thing. What the hell is this crap? Aren't we supposed to be coming from Ancient Greece? Where the hell is it coming? And why do I know what it is? - Says that to those who think that the movie Hercules is situated in the future. And by the way, the movie Hercules itself had a lot of anachronisms which didn't really make any sense. So now, please, could you let me answer this?\" She did so, and at the end, she talked again. \"It was the Author. She wanted to break even more the fourth wall (as if it was possible) and to ask us to be faster, since the story doesn't really make progress, and she is afraid her readers (if there are some present to read this crazy and full of non-sense and bad-written story... - Hey! What did you just say? - This is not my fault if you've got a low esteem of yourself) may become bored by the fact that nothing is happening. And she wants us to go to enroll Galatea into the school. - I thought it was not needed, Aphrodite objected, since it looks like that in the show, anyone can go to this school without being a part of it. - Well, she does want to make things more... realistic. - Realistic... Aphrodite repeated with skepticism. Oh, really? In a world where there are monsters, gods, demigods, creatures made of clay who can be alive, where there are magic and supernatural events? Really? - Hum... more coherent? I would say, the goddess added. Don't worry, it will not be long.\" And indeed, two scenes later... \"Wow, that was fast! Aphrodite said with admiration. - The Author didn't want to loose time, and she didn't want at all to write the scene where Galatea becomes a member of the school. Since she finds it boring, and it's not the subject of the story, oh, and by the way, she doesn't know how to write that kind of thing. - Okay, so... What do we do now? - Us? Nothing, we let Galatea and Hercules go to school. - What time is it by the way? - The Author wanted at first it to be the morning, then she realized it would be incoherent with the rest of the story, since Hercules was supposed to contact you during the evening, so she decided it would be the evening and the meal of the... evening, in fact. - Can we stay here? - Oh, yes, of course, by hiding ourselves, naturally. The Author made me read a part of the future scenario, so, you can trust me, this is going to be really interesting. - If you say so...\" So, they looked at the scene, seeing Hercules (who had talked to Galatea while the two goddesses had talked together, and who had apologized a lot of time - definitely not enough - to Galatea for his behavior) immediately join his friends. These one being Icarus and Cassandra - who seemed to be even more bored than usually - this one trying to make Icarus go far, really far from her. And obviously, it was not working at all... Hell, wouldn't someone stop him from acting like a psychopath with poor Cassandra? Galatea, as for her, still hadn't entered into the room, being quite... scared by this perspective, and it was understandable. She was born like... two or three hours ago, so it was normal that she was not really comfortable at the idea of meeting people, since she had not already done this before. Except with Athena and Aphrodite, who were goddesses, and like her... adoptive moms now, and with Hercules who had been at first a complete sexist idiot before acting normal again after that moment of stupidity. Hell, yes, she was afraid. Sociability was not something she knew well, in fact, she didn't know herself really well. She was a student of the school now, and even if she knew some things (a gift from Athena this time, who had gave her a knowledge which was known by the students and who had gave her too intelligence and wisdom. And even more sarcasm, in fact.), she didn't know everything as well. Like interactions with human people, except in theory. She had been created to be the girlfriend of an apprentice hero, and she was discovering that in fact, she was more than that. She didn't know yet who she wanted to be, but she would discover it soon. Taking a deep breath in order to give herself courage, she opened the door, and entered into the room, being followed by the proud look of the two goddesses. Then, her look fell on a particular person, and Aphrodite immediately felt it. She saw a light come into her eyes, the light, the one which should have been there after she would have seen Hercules for the first time, but which never appeared. It was love. And it was for a person which was certainly not Hercules. And Aphrodite also understood what Athena had meant by \"really interesting\". Oh, yes, they were so fucked up, because it was something that she hadn't predicted at all. Her spell had worked, yes, but it had gone wrong on the same time. Oh, shit. To be continued... The second she saw her for the first time, something definitely changed in Galatea's heart. She didn't know what, in fact, she didn't even know what it was, that she was feeling now. It was something strange, terrifying and beautiful at the same time. The person she had just seen was not Hercules, in fact, it was not even a man. It was a girl, and her name was Cassandra. And as she saw her, something new and unknown woke up in Galatea. The beatings of her heart became faster, and she froze in the middle of the room, completely mesmerized by the apparition in front of her. It was not that Cassandra was particularly attractive or captivating during this evening, in fact, it was even the contrary. Being forced to endure Icarus' presence, who was succeeding the exploit of being both invasive and annoying, she had a sad look in her eyes, and she seemed to be really bored this evening. The adolescent was eating without great enthusiasm, trying to ignore Icarus' incoherent and exasperating babbling, and she seemed to be into another world, in which she was not alone and where no one thought she was crazy because of her predictions. A world where she didn't see the future... A world where she was not cursed. But it was just dreams, right? And Galatea just couldn't stop looking at Cassandra, for a reason she couldn't understand. There was something which was attracting her to Cassandra, and the thing is that, when she began moving again, the scene hadn't lasted more than two or three seconds. The thing she didn't know is that the two goddesses had been witnessing this moment with amazement or consternation. \"Love at first sight... Athena whispered with wonderment.\" She was a goddess who was practicing magic, and yet, it didn't mean that this kind of thing was not something extraordinary. It was not arriving that frequently, so yes, Athena had a lot of reasons for being surprised and happy of the situation. Unlike Aphrodite, who was devastated by what it was implying. \"Oh no, no, no... she whispered for herself. It can't be happening this way, this was not what I wanted to do...\" Athena frowned. \"What Aphrodite? What's wrong? - Don't you see it? Galatea just fell in love with Cassandra! Well, at least, we just saw the beginning of something, but yet, this is what it means. - Yes, and I saw it, and it was pretty cute... So what? - But... this is a catastrophe! - I just hope it won't turn into an epidemic of catastrophia, Athena tried to joke. Aphrodite raised a surprised eyebrow. - What? - Hum, I... I tried to make a joke...Athena explained with embarrassment. You know, from the title of... one of the episodes... - Which one? - \"Hercules and the Epidemic of Catastrophia\". - It doesn't work there, since this title is the French one, the original title is \"Hercules and the Big Lie.\" So, yes, it really sucked. Why did you do this? - The Author is French, so she thought it could work, then she looked at the Wikipedia page, and surprise! She saw it didn't work... - You know what? I don't care, this digression was already too long, and badly done. So, the thing is that it should have never happened. - Why? Because they are both women? - No! That would be really hypocrite, coming from me... It's because this is Cassandra! - Because she is not particularly feminine or elegant or something like that? So she doesn't deserve to be loved by someone? - Again, no! It has nothing to do with this! It's just... I don't want Galatea to suffer from this. - Why did she fell for Cassandra by the way? Why did it not work for Hercules? - I don't know! I guess my spell went wrong, and... - Just like that? Aphrodite, this is your spell! Your magic! You should know how it works! - Well, I guess... Then, realizing what had happened, she closed her eyes, before facepalming. Oh no... Athena sighed, tired by her girlfriend's melodramatic tone. - Again, what? - Well, it's a possibility that, when I prepared my spell to make Galatea fall in love with Hercules, as it was supposed to happen... I may thought about Cassandra instead of Hercules at this moment, so my spell directed itself into her direction and not in Hercules'... Since I didn't want her to be alone anymore.\" Athena nodded at her words, pensive. \"You know, she remarked, maybe it's not a bad thing at all. If I am not wrong, Hercules has already a crush on a young Amazon who studies also in the Promethean school. Her name is Tempest. And the only reason why he wanted Galatea to come with him was because he had no one to go to the ball with him. So, I am not sure he would have fallen in love with Galatea, and this would have been too much unfair for her to be in love with someone who wouldn't love her. - But will Cassandra as well fall in love with her? Won't it be unfair too for her if her feelings for Cassandra never become reciprocal? Athena shrugged. - At least, we can wait for it, and wait for the events to turn into this way. And if it is not the case, you will fix it and make Galatea's feelings for Cassandra disappear. And everything will be okay. - Well... about that... I am not sure it will work this way... As she saw the goddess' embarrassed air, she raised an eyebrow. - Aphrodite... you can make your own spell stop, right? - Well... You see, not really, since I am getting some of my powers from Cupid, so he knows how it works more than I do. - Isn't Eros/Cupid supposed to be your son? - Not in this version of the story. - So, you have no idea if yes or no you can reverse the love spell you cast on Galatea... - Indeed, I don't know... And yes, I promise, I will talk to Cupid and ask him if yes or no it's possible. - Alright, alright... Then I guess there is nothing else we can do. - Not really.\" SSSSSSSS Galatea looked around herself, a little disoriented. She had finally regained her senses, but the strange feeling was still here, and she didn't understand the reason why, nor even what it was. Because, to know what love was theoretically didn't mean at all that she knew as well what it was for real. Like an automate, she walked into the direction of Hercules' table, not because it was his table, to be honest, but because Cassandra was on this one. Shyly, she took place at the table, not being able to stop looking at Cassandra, who still had the same air of desperation on her face that Galatea just wanted to take from her. She frowned. By the gods, what was happening to her? Cassandra rapidly noticed her presence, but didn't really care about it, after all, this was not the first pretty girl who was sitting at their table. Andromeda had done it once, just as Electra, for just one time, (Cassandra was happy not to see her anymore, by the way), and so did Tempest or Helen sometimes, so why would she take into account this girl who would surely be soon gone? It was not as if her life was going to become suddenly really interesting thanks to her. After some seconds, Hercules finally realized that she was here, he started, and then, he smiled at her. \"Hum, Galatea... Hey! I am happy to see you there. Icarus, Cassandra, may I introduce you to Galatea, my... (He couldn't consider her as his girlfriend, as she already clarified that it was not who she was, so...). - Hum, hum, he repeated, a little embarrassed, as Icarus and Cassandra were now looking at the adolescent in front of them. She will be my dance partner for the Aphrodite's ball, he announced, trying not to be too much arrogant, as it already ended bad for him during the day.\" At his words, Cassandra's eyes began to shine and she finally let an ironic smile come on her lips, which just made Galatea's heart beat even faster than before, for a reason she didn't understand. Then, she plunged herself in Cassandra's green eyes that she was now finding more beautiful than ever, and doing this, she forgot for a moment the entirety of the world. She gave herself an internal slap, trying to again stay focused on the current situation. \"Oh? So you're the clay doll that Hercules asked Aphrodite to create for him so he would not go alone to this stupid ball... - By the way, Icarus interrupted her, will you finally accept to go to this with me? Cassandra just sighed and rolled her eyes. - Again, Icarus, the answer is just no, no, NO! Can you understand this word or are you too much stupid for this? In fact, it wouldn't surprise me if it was the case... She muttered for herself. Now, please, leave me alone! What was I saying? She continued. Oh, yes... You're the clay doll that this idiot had the inconsistency of creating because he is just unable to have normal sociable interactions with people. Just as I do, but at least, I assume my misanthropic side, unlike him. - Cassandra! Hercules protested, as Galatea was staying frozen, surprised and totally petrified by Cassandra's sardonic and venomous tone, that she didn't expect at all. Don't be too much harsh on her, she is new here, you will scare her with your attitude!\" The seer just shrugged, not seeming to care about Galatea's opinion. She had given up since a long time the idea of having real friends, apart Hercules, Icarus, and Helen. Galatea tried to smile, hesitantly, and Cassandra made the reflection to herself that the young woman and former statue did have a beautiful smile, before chasing this thought the furthest she could into her spirit. Yeah, it was better if she didn't let her lesbian side take the control in her, she had to forget that she had realized not a long time ago that she preferred women to men. It was not as if she could be interested by Galatea, who didn't seem to get more for her than her pretty face, and it was not as if Galatea could be interested by her as well. \"No, Hercules... She assured him immediately. It's okay, don't worry for me. I guess I just have to adapt myself to... human habits. This world is still very new to me. - Oh, that's so? Cassandra answered to her with a legitimate surprise. A girlfriend of you who accepts my sarcastic and cynical remarks, Hercules? That's a good point for her. It's so rare here to find people who fully appreciate irony... This time, a real smile appeared on her face, and it made Galatea blush for some seconds. I am happy to meet you Galatea. But by the way, Hercules, she added with a smirk, aren't you supposed to already have a crush on Tempest? Did you just... forget her by seeing Galatea come to life? Hercules rolled his eyes. - Cassandra, Galatea is not my girlfriend! She was enough clear about that subject, he added, being still a little bitter about it. - So you would have wanted her to be so, hum? Icarus said, then joining the conversation, not being at all subtle in any way (indeed, it was not his best quality... Does Icarus even have qualities, in fact?).\" Galatea looked at him some seconds, before beginning to contemplate again Cassandra, who had still noticed nothing, unlike Hercules, who frowned, before thinking that it was just because Galatea didn't really know how to interact with people. If only he knew the truth... Cassandra rolled her eyes a new time and tried not to sigh too much loud. \"Icarus, she asked him, could you please leave us and annoy someone else?\" Surprisingly, the young man obeyed and left the table, because he had finished eating (and also because the Author didn't want him anymore to be present in the scene and in the chapter, and because one line of dialogue is already too much to give to him). Galatea then began to eat, being terribly hungry for the first time in her life, still looking at Cassandra. This one then allowed herself to have a sigh of relief. Oh, by the gods, she was not going to support him during the rest of the year, before that, she would either kill him or become mad (AND then kill him, obviously). Galatea stayed silent for some seconds, amazed at the new tastes she was now experimenting, tasting something totally new for her. \"Tell me, she finally asked to Cassandra after finishing from eating rapidly, and being terribly curious, is this... Icarus, your boyfriend?\" Cassandra then looked at her with a look of pure horror and disgust. \"No! (Oh, hell, she had the impression to be back to the Circe's episode, where Helen had kept telling her again and again that indeed, Icarus was her boyfriend, while he was not and would never be! Why kept everyone thinking this absurd thing? Oh yes, it was just because this stupid Icarus kept harassing her! What a gift he was...) - He is not my boyfriend! She almost screamed. And he will never be! If you're interested by him, she said, you can go after him, you can trust me, that would give me holidays that I really need right now... He is annoying me in a way you can't even imagine... - In fact, I am not... Totally not. (He is not the one I am interested by, by the way, she told to herself, still devouring Cassandra with her eyes). I was just... curious.\" She was feeling relieved of this revelation in a way she still couldn't understand. What was she feeling exactly? She should ask Aphrodite and Athena about it, after all, they were her new \"parents\" now, no? They had to know what it was, that she was feeling toward Cassandra. An awkward silence then took place between the three people, before Cassandra said something: \"So, you were created by Aphrodite and Athena, right? If Hercules told me well, it makes you their daughter, right? How does it feel, to be the daughter of two goddesses? Galatea shrugged. - I don't really know. I mean, I don't know as well what it is to have parents, so I don't know at all what it is too. Again, it's something really new to me. She took a deep breath, before daring to say: Talking about new things... Cassandra, will you accept to make me visit the Promethean school tomorrow? It will be a place where I will stay for a long time, so I would want to know it better. (Just as I want to know you better, she thought.)\" Cassandra thought at first that the other girl could have asked this to Hercules first, since he would be her dance partner the day after, but she then told herself that the new student just wanted to make friends. She sadly smiled to herself, missing Galatea's fascinated look, thinking about the fact that soon, when she would know how she was considered (and the fact that she was on the \"looser'\" side), she would rapidly go away from her. And it saddened her in a way she couldn't understand either. She just nodded. \"Oh... Of course! It won't be really long, since there are not so much things to see, but it's okay for me... - Thank you very much, Cassandra, Galatea told her, before sending her a too much brilliant and shining smile and Cassandra really tried not to find her too much beautiful.\" She couldn't, of course. Hercules looked at the two women during the exchange, and he frowned a new time, feeling the connection present between them, deciding that he would then talk to Cassandra, in order to know what was happening. Even if a part of him already knew what it was, for Galatea herself, at least. Indeed, he was more and more understanding the reason why he was not Galatea's \"type\". Melancholic, he thought about Tempest, and looked at her briefly, who was not really far from him and who was eating with Ajax, and the young and future hero felt a wave of jealousy cross through him. He knew it was childish, but he couldn't help it. Galatea noticed his look and understood rapidly the reason why he had acted this way with her. \"You did this for her, right? Create me... Because you couldn't have her, you wanted her to be jealous. - Indeed, Galatea, you're right... I know that it was stupid, but... - And also irrational. - In fact, I am sorry for my behavior, and I am happy of your existence, and I hope that despite what I did, we will be friends one day. Galatea had a little smile. - I think it's a possibility...\" During their conversation, Cassandra, finally freed from Icarus and happy of it (just as everyone was. Especially me.) had taken a roll of papyrus from her bag and had began to read it passionately. It was a book from Aristotle, Nicomachean Ethics, and thanks to the knowledge Athena had given her, Galatea identified him a being a philosopher, and a good one if she was not wrong, and her curious part became immediately interested, and she thought about getting a copy of the book for herself. When she saw Cassandra smile, reading the book which interested her so much, Galatea felt something else, something new and that she still didn't understand. Something like the beginning of love feelings. To be continued... After she made sure that Galatea was fine, Aphrodite left the school, while Athena came back to the Mount Olympus, and the goddess of love decided to go to see Cupid immediately, not caring about the hour of the night. She didn't show it too much to Athena, but she was indeed worried about it. Even if Galatea was born not a long time ago, Aphrodite had already grown attached to her, as well as Athena did, so she just wanted her to be okay and happy. She didn't want her new adoptive daughter to get her heart broken. And it risked to happen, if Cassandra appeared not to be sensible to her charms, except of course if she asked Cupid to send a magical arrow on the young seer with his \"Armageddon arc\". It would be cheating, of course, but by casting her spell, she had already cheated a little, right? And by the way, she was a goddess, so, why would she care? So yes, as she entered in the god's house, she was feeling a little nervous. What if the spell couldn't be reversed? What if she had done a terrible mistake? When Cupid opened his door, Aphrodite suddenly started, realizing that indeed, it was pretty late and that she had woken up him, regarding to his tired look, and the thing is that she should have waited before coming. He frowned. \"Aphrodite? What are you doing here? - Oh, excuse me Cupid, I didn't realize it was that late... I can come back later if you want me to. He just shrugged. - Well, now that I am awake... Enter, he invited her.\" She sat down on a chair, and, some minutes later, the god gave her a cup of tea. \"Hum... Thanks, she said with circumspection. Aren't we supposed to drink/eat something like ambrosia or nectar? Since we are Greek gods... - The Author loves too much to make anachronisms, don't you remember that Athena had a mobile phone with her in chapter two? Well, you and I, we drink tea. So, tell me, why are you here? - Oh yes, I almost forgot it... Five or six hours ago, Hercules, our... well, Zeus' and Hera's son (it will be much easier to say it this way, even if it has no fucking sense since this is not accurate.), asked me to create a girlfriend for him, made of clay, because he couldn't find a dance partner for the ball of tomorrow. - Wow... Cupid reacted, being not impressed at all. That's really... interesting, right? - Don't be too much mocking Cupid, right? I mean, it's the plot which was used for the episode of which this story itself is inspired by. - Maybe, but... I mean, did they want to make a cheap version of Pygmalion's myth? - I'm afraid they did, with even more sexism than in the original story. - Please Aphrodite, tell me you didn't do this. When he saw her guilt look, he sighed and then rolled his eyes. You did it! - Yes! But I gave her a real personality, unlike what my nephew/half-brother/I already lost myself in the family tree asked me! I created her, helped by Athena, I cast my spell on her to make her fall in love with Hercules, and everything was okay, but... - But something went wrong? - Hum, yes... The spell didn't make Galatea fall in love with Hercules, but with Cassandra. - Cassandra? The seer who was cursed by Apollo, your dear brother? - Yes, originally, in the myth. But here, since my brother is supposed to be a good guy, just say that she was just born this way. - What? But it makes no sense... - The show was never clear about the fact that she was cursed, since her predictions were sometimes believed, and sometimes not, so yes, we can as well be as obscure as they were. - Tell me, in which way is it a problem? The fact that she has feelings for this girl in particular? - This was not supposed to happen this way! - Are you sure at all that you made her fall in love with Cassandra with your magic? Cupid asked her with curiosity. - Hum... I don't know. When I decided to cast the spell, I was thinking about Cassandra's situation, and about how lonely she was, and the fact that I wanted to fix it... Tell me Cupid, is it possible at all to reverse or break this spell if Cassandra doesn't fall in love with Galatea? I don't want my daughter to suffer from this because of my mistake.\" Cupid had a little smile, when he heard that Aphrodite was already considering Galatea as being her real daughter, not just her creation. \"I'm sorry to disappoint you, Aphrodite, but this is not something you or I can do. - Wait, what? What do you mean? Why? - Your spell didn't work at all, in fact, you're not the one who made Galatea fall in love with Cassandra, it happened for one reason. - Which one? - I'm surprised you still didn't see it, Aphrodite. That's not because your spell is too powerful, since the spell was not cast. The fact that you thought about Cassandra at this moment didn't make the spell work, that's not at all the reason why Galatea fell, well, is falling for Cassandra. That's just because they are soulmates. - Sou... Soulmates? So you mean that this is not my fault? The goddess asked, an air of relief on her face. The god just nodded his head. - Absolutely... This time, in fact, it was not. - Hey! - What? Is it not your type to do this and ruin people's life? - I didn't ruin that much lives! Well... These last times, at least, I didn't. - Maybe, maybe... So, now that you have your answers, could you please go and let me sleep? - Please, answer to this last question... Why did Cassandra not react to it? - Galatea was created by magic, by your magic, so she is more sensible to love and the magic of love that you do. That's the reason why she felt it, and that Cassandra didn't. - Okay... Thanks, and sorry for disturbing you.\" SSSSSSSS To say the truth, Galatea didn't care at all about the Promethean school, how it looked like or its history, or anything else which could be said about it. All she cared about was to spend some time with Cassandra, and it was the only thing she had really found to make the young woman stay with her, without it being too much strange, so it was only a pretext. After passing the night into a bed, and sleeping for the first time of her life (indeed, Galatea's existence was now going to be full of first times, regarding to the fact that she was born just the day before), she had woken up at 9 AM, had went to the room where everyone ate. Since the ball of Aphrodite would be just during the evening, it was a day-off for all the students, giving them time to prepare themselves or to get excited for an event which was something really banal when you thought about it, since there was a tone of balls in this school... (Hell, two of the sixty-five episodes of this show were done with an entire plot about a ball. This one, the one with Orpheus... Almost three, with the episode about Theseus, as there is a ball in this episode too. Why did they have to do that? It was just... not interesting! And sometimes really stupid. As usual, I would say.) She had eaten her breakfast alone, as Hercules was now training with Philoctetes, Cassandra was working/reading on her own in her room, alone (misanthropy and all these things...), and Icarus... Well, I have no idea where Icarus can be! You know what? I just... don't care. He has no importance, role or even usefulness in this story, so, why would I bother to add him in this one? I mean, I don't like Adonis as well, so he is not present either, so why would I let Icarus stay here? I won't have to write about a character I don't like, and the fans of Icarus (if there are some here. Well, if they exist at least) won't be too much angry at me! (If they didn't leave immediately the story during chapter 1 when they read the warning I let about this character...) Just imagine that he is spending time with his father, or with his mother (yeah, you remember her? The one we just heard about in the last episode of the show!), or at home, or that he decided not to go to the ball since Cassandra didn't want to go with him. Or that, as I like to imagine it, he is trying again to fly too close to the sun and that it will burn him for real this time, or that he was finally definitely eaten by Jealousy, or that he was not brought back by Hercules after he died because of the Tapestry of the Fates... Just imagine what you want, he is just not here anymore. So, here is the end of the digression. Galatea was eating alone, waiting for Cassandra to come there, not knowing what else to do (they had decided to begin the visit at 11 AM, before eating together again), walking then in the school, wandering here and there, before she found out where the library of the campus was. Her eyes began to shine when she also realized how huge this library was. If she was mainly Aphrodite's creation, the thing is that she was as well created by Athena, the goddess of wisdom herself, which meant that she had a great interest in knowledge of all kinds, meaning literature too. She had not a great knowledge in this, for the simple reason that she had not read anything for real before this day (but thanks to Athena, she knew how to read), but she had a real interest, so, she then decided to go to it, and borrowed some books to read before Cassandra's arrival. In fact, these one were so much interesting that she lost herself in them, reading during the two hours before the moment where her and Cassandra were supposed to begin the visit together. SSSSSSSS After eating, Cassandra began searching for Galatea, that she found nowhere at first, before she saw Helen of Troy (by the way, why to call her of Troy? Since she never left for Troy for a really long time, except for one or two days in one episode, and since she is not from Troy. And why did they make the reference of the horse in one episode since it was not related to anything?) reading alone, this time far from Adonis and his group of \"popular\" people. \"Excuse-me, Helen, do you have any idea of the place where Galatea could be? I am searching from her, and I have no idea of where she can be. Helen put down on the table her book, Plato's one, in fact, and she looked at her with a smile. - Oh, really Cassandra? You're searching for someone who is not Hercules or Icarus? Do you do this because you want to have a date with her?\" Cassandra simply rolled her eyes. \"Tell-me Helen, why on hell do you want me to date at least the half of the Greece? I am not searching for a boyfriend, nor a girlfriend, okay? When will you understand this simple truth, that is to say, that I prefer to be alone? First, you thought I wanted to be with Icarus (eurk...), and now, you think I want to be with Galatea? I just met her yesterday.\" (Even if she couldn't deny the fact that a part of her was attracted to her.) Helen had a sad sigh. \"Oh, Cassandra... Don't you believe into love at first sight? Or True Love? - Says the one who talks about love but who is dating some bastard and who just can't realize what an asshole he is?\" The princess simply shrugged with indifference. \"I just broke up with Adonis, she announced with a smile. - What? Off-screen? - Yes! After all, I am not the main character nor the main plot of the story, but the Author just hates Adonis, so yes, we are not together anymore! - With who will you go to the ball? - Paris, of course! This story has, at least, to make one reference to the Iliad, it's the story I am coming from, after all! And so do you, even if your link with Paris is never evoked... That's strange and weird... She added. - Yep! But you didn't answer to my question, the seer replied. The first one, I mean. - Did you know that Circe had finally found a girlfriend? I mean, the truth is that she finally understood that there was a reason which explained the fact that every time she had a boyfriend, it went badly. - By badly, you mean, her turning them into animals, as she did it with Adonis and Hercules? - Hum, yes... - What does it have to do with me? - Huh... You could get Galatea as your girlfriend? And have someone? Be with someone?\" Cassandra raised an eyebrow. \"Again, I don't think this is something I really need. And please, Helen, stop to try messing with my love life! Well, my non-existent love life would be much more accurate... Do you know at least where Galatea is or am I just losing my time? Helen then had a desperate sigh (a false one, of course. She loved being melodramatic) and she nodded her head. - Yes, I saw her go into the direction of the library two hours ago. I guess you will find her there. - Thanks Helen. And again, please, stop definitely to try to find for me a boyfriend/girlfriend/random love interest, because I just can't get more of this! You're a nice girl, Helen, and I am happy you finally regained your senses and left Adonis, but this doesn't mean you have to try to make me be less misanthropic/alone. I am happy the way I am. The other woman sighed again. - I guess I just have to let you try to do this on your own... - Yes, do this please. That would be a great blessing for me.\" Helen nodded another time and plunged herself back into her book, while Cassandra was beginning to walk into the direction of the library, as did Galatea some time ago. SSSSSSSS The Promethean school's library was one of the places that Cassandra liked the most on the campus, at first because it was a place where Icarus didn't like at all to go (he was not really the book type, to say the truth. Well, except Helen and Cassandra, no one really was in this school), but also because she loved literature. So much. It really helped, in fact, to read books, not just because she liked reading, but also because it helped her a lot to escape. Escape from the world, escape from the curse, and especially, escape from herself. It was a place where no one considered her as being a freaking monster, since no one ever paid attention to her. It was a calm place, where she could be alone and safe. So a part of her was glad that Galatea had chosen to go to this place on her first day on the Promethean school. The thing was that Cassandra was partly agoraphobic. A thing she never told to anyone (only her parents knew this) was that, some times, she just couldn't support to have people around her, and what people saw as being misanthropy, was just... fear, and social anxiety. She didn't really like to be with people, and some times, it was worst than at others, and, as she entered in the library, some of her anxiety just faded away, and she took a deep breath. There, it was almost like she was at home now. Her heart missed a beating when she saw that Galatea was there, reading, with a smile on her lips, which sometimes turned into a true laugh when she seemed to read a really funny passage. Cassandra surprised herself by thinking that her laugh was indeed really beautiful. What the hell... was Helen romantic side too much influencing her? What the hell was that? She was just supposed to be a depressed and misanthropic seer who didn't like people, not some banal woman who fell for the first pretty girl who passed in front of her eyes! Cassandra, despite this, continued staring intensely at Galatea, before walking silently into her direction. She was so absorbed into her reading that she barely noticed that Cassandra had sat down next to her. This one hawked discretely, and it made Galatea suddenly raise her head from her book, and she started immediately as she saw her. \"Oh, Cassandra... She blushed a little, a thing that her friend didn't notice, luckily for her. What are you doing... Then, her eyes opened wide, when she realized which time it was now, and she put her hand on her mouth, showing her shock. - Oh... I... I am sorry, Cassandra! I just completely forgot that I was supposed to visit the school with you, I was... I was so interested by the book I was reading that I didn't notice that time was passing so quickly! - Don't worry, it's not a problem, I know what it is to loose yourself completely into a book. Which book were you reading actually? She asked her with curiosity, looking at the roll of papyrus in the hands of the new student. - Oh... It's a play written by Aristophanes, Lysistrata. Did you read it? - Yes, I did, it's a really funny play... - I agree! Galatea exclaimed with an enthusiastic smile which made Cassandra smile too.\" Looking at Galatea's desk, Cassandra then frowned, seeing a lot of rolls of papyrus, maybe too much, in fact. \"You borrowed all of them? Whoa! Parenthesis and the teachers were really not really soft with you for your first week of school, if they asked you to read all of this.\" At her turn, Galatea frowned with surprise before blinking, some seconds before understanding what her friend meant. \"What? Oh, no... It was not asked by any of the teachers, in fact, they told me I would begin the classes the next week. They give me some time to adapt, these one are just books I want to read because when Athena created me she gave me knowledge about these one, and other. But as I actually still hadn't read them, I want to do so. Just in order to know what it's about. And the thing is that they are really interested.\" At this moment, Cassandra felt her heart beat faster than ever, and she couldn't help, but smile, immediately forgetting about the fact that she was supposed to make her friend visit the school during the day. Had she finally met someone like her? Despite her habitual instincts, she decided to come closer to the young woman. \"Do you need some help?\" To be continued... When the two girls stopped talking about their different reading, it was already 1 PM. Unlike what Cassandra could have firstly thought, Galatea really seemed to be interested by her company, and it warmed the seer's heart, to know that someone other than Icarus or Hercules liked to be with her, and talk with her, and didn't look at her like she was some freak, just because of her \"gift\". For the first time in a long time, Cassandra didn't feel like she was alone anymore, and she was not this time with someone who was with her because she had no one else (Galatea could have become someone really popular really rapidly, if she had wanted to), but because she did want to be with her. And it was good. Galatea was apparently a quick reader, and her and Cassandra rapidly had a debate about which play written by Aristophanes was the best, or about the tragedies, and who between Aeschylus, Sophocles and Euripides was the best one. Galatea had looked at the young student during the discussion, seeing her finally go out of her usual apathy as she was dealing with a subject which apparently really interested her, and she had felt this strange feeling come back into her chest. The woman made of clay knew that she was herself considered as being beautiful (she was created by the goddess of love and beauty. She had been made by her to be beautiful, according to the criteria of the period), but the thing is that, as she looked more and more at her new friend, seeing her eyes shine with interest, her smile growing more and more, she found her just being truly magnificent. They had talked together for almost two entire hours, and, as she realized what time it was, Cassandra chuckled. \"Whoa... I didn't realize... I think it's the first time I finally have a long conversation which is only about books. When I talk about this kind of things with Helen, in the end, she always begins to talk about boys, clothes, or other things... And I am not even talking about Hercules or Icarus, they mainly don't care about it. - And I was happy to talk about this with you, Cassandra, Galatea answered, her cheeks red with joy and excitement. It was a really pleasant talk.\" Cassandra felt herself blush for a reason she couldn't explain nor understand. She was not sure she wanted to do so. (Why did Galatea have to be both beautiful and interesting?) SSSSSSSS The visit of the school was pretty short, since none of the girls really wanted to stay too much far from the library for a too much long time and from their so much interesting conversation, Cassandra promising to Galatea to give to her for some times some of her own books. As Cassandra showed her what had to be seen in the school and on the campus, they continued talking together, the seer evoking mainly Hercules and his adventures - which were mainly failures, to be honest - as Hades' shenanigans and plots - most of the time stupid things/failures as well - and also her own problems. She didn't tell her anything about her personal curse or her relational problem with people. After visiting the place, they went to eat together (Icarus was still not here, as he is not here anymore, and Hercules was still training with Philoctetes), and after that, Galatea decided to go to see her \"moms\", in order to ask them questions. As Cassandra was continuing reading her book (which was still Aristotle's one), the young woman went to Aphrodite's temple. It felt strange. Yes, it felt really strange, to go to a temple to talk to her new \"parents\". She understood what Hercules might be feeling. \"Aphrodite? Athena? Hum... moms? She asked with difficulty, still not being used to have a family.\" Not being used to be alive at all. Some seconds after, the two goddesses appeared in front of her, both smiling, and maybe it was just Galatea's impression, but it looked like they already knew what she wanted to ask them. \"Yes, darling? Aphrodite asked her. Are you okay? - Is your first day at school alright? Athena immediately asked her. - Oh, yes, of course, I... I'm fine, thanks. Tonight is the ball organized in your honor mom, so, I guess it will be fun. Even if I don't know how to dance... She added. - Why don't you ask to someone to teach you how to do so? Why not asking this to Cassandra, for example? Aphrodite asked her with a not really subtle air of connivance with her adoptive daughter, and it made Athena roll her eyes. Hell, couldn't her lover be less obvious and predictable? - Why her specifically? I could learn it with anyone else! - Well, you seem to like her more than the others, that is the only reason why I suggested her name. Aphrodite answered with a false innocent tone. Am I wrong? She asked genuinely. - No! Well, I mean... In fact, I don't know what you mean, mom, but this is not what you think... Whatever you think it is, she continued, embarrassed.\" Aphrodite, as well as Athena herself, immediately gave her a tender and loving smile. Oh, she was just so innocent! \"In fact, that was also the reason why I came here, Galatea then said, regaining suddenly some confidence. I wanted to know... Why am I feeling so strange when I am near Cassandra? - What do you mean by strange? The goddess of wisdom asked her, already knowing what it was and what she meant.\" Athena knew, as much as Aphrodite did, that Galatea and Cassandra were both each other's soulmate, since Aphrodite had told her what Cupid had revealed to her. It didn't mean at all that she was going to tell her this, but it didn't mean either that she didn't want to help her knew and adorable daughter. \"I... I feel awkward. Galatea admitted. Happy but also sad at the same time, as if I was missing something. I love to look at her, to see her smile, laugh, be happy, in fact, I want to make her feel happy. When I am far from her, it hurts. When I saw Icarus being close to her yesterday, it hurt as well. When she is sad and in a bad mood, I feel bad as well, and I don't know why, she said this in an almost desperate tone. When she smiles at me or when she laughs, I feel like my heart is jumping into my chest, and I just can't understand why. - How do you perceive Cassandra exactly? What do you think of her? Athena demanded, wanting her adoptive daughter just to find the answer by herself. - She is brilliant! She loves books and literature as well as I myself do, and she knows so much things about it! She is wonderful! She is funny, sometimes rude and cynical, but I know this is just a facade. And by the way, it makes her being really amusing. She is kind, and friendly, and beautiful, and I really like her, and...\" A sudden realization seemed to hit violently the young girl, and she closed her eyes. She blinked, half-horrified. \"And I think I am in love with her! She almost screamed. How... how did it happen? I know her since just one day, how can I... It's too much soon! - Or so you think, Galatea, Aphrodite told her with an indulgent smile. Did you ever heard about love at first sight? Hell, if you think about it, all Hercules crushes in this damn show were just about him seeing a pretty and sometimes not interesting girl (yeah, I am looking at you Electra) and immediately falling in love with her without even knowing her. - Except with Tempest, of course, Athena corrected her. She was a good one. A good character as well as a good love interest. And she is an Amazon. And a good fighter. I really like her. - Yeah, I agree with this. In fact, she is the only one of them the Author really likes to see in a relationship with Hercules. Galatea, she continued, you know Cassandra maybe better than a lot of people do know her, and in fact, you're just falling in love with her. That's just the beginning, don't worry. - What if she doesn't love me? I mean, I know it can appear to be stupid and like being nothing really important, but... - Hey, kid, Aphrodite told her with a reassuring tone, it's okay... You're in love. That's a great and wonderful and beautiful thing. This is not stupid, because being in love is never something stupid. - Well, it can make you do stupid things, but... - Athena, please, don't break all my tries! Do I do that with you? - You did... - Maybe... But please, don't do this now! You're in love, Galatea. Love is never easy, I know it, before finding the good one, I was successively with Ares and then Hephaestus. And now, I know I am with the good one, she said, sending a smile of love at Athena, who replied to this one immediately, and the thing is that... you will know when it's the good one. I promise. It won't be easy, but trust me, it worth fighting for.\" Galatea tried to smile, and Aphrodite then decided to take her into her arms. \"I am still afraid mom, the young woman said, and the goddess felt her heart break.\" She just hugged he tighter. SSSSSSSS At the same time. Hercules, after eating, had decided to continue training with Philoctetes, and he started when he saw an Amazon he knew really well walk into his direction. \"Hey Tempest! Hum... Hello! What are you doing here? - I wanted to know if I could train with you... - Oh... Yes, of course, the apprentice hero answered to her.\" They trained together for one or two hours, and Hercules finally noticed that Tempest did seem to be preoccupied by something. \"Tell me Tempest... Are you okay? It looks like something is wrong with you.\" She had a serious air on her face, and she then sighed. \"Oh, don't worry Hercules, this is nothing really important, but... This is... embarrassing. - I am the champion of embarrassing decisions or situations, so trust me, nothing can be more embarrassing than the fact that I created yesterday a woman made of clay because I was a selfish idiot who wanted someone to go to the ball with him.\" Tempest then frowned. \"Oh. You really did it? I have heard of this, but I didn't know it was you who... indeed, this is also embarrassing. Hum, as you already know it, I was supposed to go to the ball of this evening with Ajax. - Indeed, since you didn't accept to go with me, Hercules answered, without any tone of reproach in his voice. It had been her choice, after all. - Sure. But the thing is that, he doesn't want anymore to go to the ball. He told me it didn't interest him anymore, and I realized as well I didn't really want to go with him. So, I am sorry to ask this to you this lately, but... would you like to go to the ball with me? If the answer is no, I understand it. - To go to the ball... with you? Oh, Tempest, I would adore to do so! The apprentice hero answered her with enthusiasm. But then, his smile immediately faded. But... I am supposed to go to the ball with Galatea, and this is not that she is really happy of going to it with me, but I made all of this so I would go with her, and if I let her alone like that, I will really be perceived as someone indelicate. And if she doesn't find someone else... he added, beginning to completely panic. - Hercules, calm yourself. Just ask her if she is okay with this, and if she is, just tell me you will go with me to the ball. I see you later, she added, before kissing the young hero on the cheek.\" And then, she left, leaving Hercules almost petrified. This one smiled beatifically, before sighing. He just hoped that Galatea would accept this change of last minute... SSSSSSSS The girl made of clay crossed her arms on her chest, then she raised an eyebrow, before smiling ironically. \"You must be fucking kidding me! She exclaimed, not believing what she had just heard.\" She was both amused and angry, but she tried to show herself as being furious, in order to frighten the future hero with her attitude. After all, he had made all these absurd things for this stupid ball, and now, he was announcing her that he wanted to go to it with someone else? What the fuck was that? It was not that she wanted that much to go and dance with him (not at all... Really not), but he could have said it before! He had now a contrite air on his face. \"Galatea, I am really sorry... Especially after the way I behaved with you... - Oh, but you can be! You ask Aphrodite to create me and now, you tell me you want to go to the ball with someone else? I am so shocked, Hercules! She said with a false anger.\" Some seconds later, seeing how sorry and contrite he was, she unexpectedly burst into laughter. He looked at her with surprise. \"Oh, Hercules, I am joking! Of course you can go to the ball with Tempest if you want to! I am not going to be the one who will forbid you to do so... In fact, it may be a good thing for me. - Why? Is there already someone you want to go to the ball with? - Yes... I would like to ask to Cassandra to come with me. - Cass... Cassandra? - Do you think she will say yes?\" He chuckled. \"I think she will say yes to anyone who is not Icarus.\" Galatea tried to smile, not really reassured. At least, she could try. SSSSSSSS \"Cassandra... Would you accept to go to the ball with me? As a friend, of course.\" Surprised of being asked by someone else than Icarus, and ready to understand more her feelings toward Galatea, the young seer accepted. Oh, and of course, before the ball, they would have to learn how to dance. Detail... To be continued... Galatea had invited her to Aphrodite's ball. And her, Cassandra, the seer, she had said yes. Why exactly? Silently, pensive, she replayed the conversation she had with the other girl in her head. She was still reading Aristotle's book when Galatea had came to see her, and Cassandra looked at her with curiosity. At her surprise, Galatea was harboring an air of uncertainty on her face. \"Hum, tell me, Cassandra... Would you accept to go to the ball with me? As a friend, of course, she had immediately added.\" I t had nothing to do with everything else she had already received in the past, mainly from Icarus. And unlike everything coming from him, it was something pleasant. S o, she had no dance partner for tonight, she didn't want to go with Icarus, Galatea was pretty and she liked her. I t was not like Cassandra was confronted to a great dilemma... \"Yes, of course I will come with you! It might be fun, after all.\" And by the way, they would not be forced to dance, right? (Error.) SSSSSSSS It was 4 PM when Cassandra and Galatea both learned what they were supposed to do (just as all the other students of the Promethean school) before the beginning of the ball, and the seer immediately got pale. They were supposed, according to their new dance teacher (the one who appears in the episode \"Hercules and the Muse of Dance\" for those who don't remember who she is), to learn how to dance, because, after all, they were going to a ball, so it was an elementary thing, right? To know how to dance. Cassandra understood the idea, but it didn't mean she liked it, it didn't mean she accepted it. She would have to dance with Galatea. For real. Oh no, no, NO! She hadn't signed for it! She had accepted to go the ball with her friend because Hercules finally had the possibility to go with Tempest, that is to say the one with who he really wanted to go, and because she liked Galatea enough to want to spend an entire evening with her. Itwas not either that she didn't like to dance, it was not that she didn't want to dance with Galatea, but... She was afraid. As it was said before, she didn't really like to be with people, except those she knew, as Hercules and Icarus (even if she didn't really have the choice with this one), her parents or Galatea, recently. So, yes, to accept to go to this ball showed how much she cared about Galatea, but it didn't mean she could accept to dance with her in front of everyone! She thought that she would just be with her, talk with her and see the other people dance and enjoy herself by staying away from the other people (except Galatea, Hercules, Helen or Tempest) as much as she could. And according to Galatea's look, she seemed to be as embarrassed as she was. The teacher rolled her eyes, clearly annoyed, as she noticed her students' reticence. \"Oh, come on! This is a ball! So, you're supposed to dance! And you've got just enough time to learn it! One of the students rolled his eyes. - In only three hours? - Pff... Amateurs! In the episode dedicated to dance, Hercules learned everything he had to learn in just one time! Clearly less than an hour. Muse, magic, all these things... You know what it is... Three hours, it's nothing for you! She affirmed with a certitude none of them shared. - She is completely crazy, Cassandra muttered to Galatea, who couldn't help but chuckle.\" She just hoped that she hadn't done it too much loud. The teacher looked at them and smiled, before inviting all of them to go on the dance floor. Ok, so... It was not a joke. Cassandra took a deep breath, trying not to panic. She was supposed to dance with a beautiful girl that she liked a lot even if she had met her just the day before, and that she might have a crush on, and this, in front of everyone. It was going to be okay... It just had to be okay. SSSSSSSS Galatea felt like she was in Paradise. Even if the suggestion had felt weird at first for her (and she was not the only one who thought that), she internally thanked the teacher for her idea. Because it was just perfect. Not because it was forcing Cassandra to dance with her (that would have been a thought coming rather from Icarus, if he had the chance to dance with the young woman), but because it was giving her the opportunity and the possibility to know if yes or no this one liked her. There is a thing which has to be clear for everyone. The woman made of clay was... young. If she was physically speaking someone aged of sixteen years old, the thing is that she existed since just the day before this one. (Outch... This is definitely completely weird.) Which meant that there was a lot of things that she didn't know about humanity or about how things worked in the world. (She knew some, of course, thanks to Aphrodite or Athena, but not all of them. She had the spirit of a teenager but not all the knowledge these one could have.) One of them being the fact that she didn't know at all how to flirt. So, yes, she had no idea of how express her feelings for Cassandra or how to show her that she liked her, more than just a simple friend. The only examples she had were Aphrodite and Athena (but they were already in a relationship, so it was not the same thing), Hercules and Tempest (but the thing is that he was not really better than her at this \"game\"), and Icarus and... no, with Cassandra, and he was clearly not a role model in any way. So yes, the thing is that this dance would be a good occasion. Well, only if Galatea could herself get rid off her damn shyness... Just to say that it was not going to be easy. She was feeling good in a really strange way, as the two women were dancing together, and were trying to learn really rapidly (as all the other one) movements which should have taken much more time to be learned in a realistic universe. (But since when is this universe in any way realistic? Ha, ha...) Some hours passed, and at 7 PM, they all ate, prepared themselves for the ball, and one hour later, the ball itself began. SSSSSSSS The situation was still strange for the two of them. The awkwardness of the situation had made silence fall between the two girls, who didn't know at first what to tell to the other, being both too much absorbed in their own thoughts, reflections, and fears. Until Galatea finally tried to force herself to break the uncomfortable feeling that had appeared between them. She looked at Hercules and Tempest, dancing together gracelessly (since for this time, Hercules was not that... clumsy, unlike how he usually was, since the Author decided this was not funny or dramatic or interesting in any way), and Galatea pointed the couple to Cassandra. \"They really seem to fit well together, she remarked, wanting to say something, anything so the awkwardness wouldn't be here anymore, because she didn't want things to be different between them, just because they were dancing.\" A rare and happy smile crossed Cassandra's face, who nodded her head. \"I agree... In fact, of all Hercules' girlfriends/crushes/briefs love interests, she is the only one of them that I find really sympathetic, interesting, and corresponding to Hercules. Apart you, of course.\" She didn't miss Galatea's sudden blush, but she misunderstood it, thinking it was maybe a reminiscence of her past and brief attraction toward Hercules (after all, she was supposed to be in love with him at first, right? It was how the spell worked, after all, Cassandra thought, not knowing it hadn't worked this way.) \"You know, I never was... I would say, a member of this category. I never was in love with him or interested by him. And I will never be. - Why not? Cassandra asked, really surprised and interested by the answer. I mean, he is my friend, and I will never be attracted to him as well, but... I can understand why someone like you or Tempest, or anyone else could be. He is kind, brave, heroic (most of the time...), not stupid (again, most of the time, when the writers don't want him to make stupid things), cute, strong... Is it because he is not your type? If the answer is yes, I hope your type is not Adonis, she added with a fake and forced laugh, feeling the terrible pain of jealousy invading her at this simple thought.\" Please, do not let him be... She begged, internally. She knew it was absurd, but the thing is that she was afraid. Galatea just grinned. \"No, not at all... And tell me, Cassandra... What about you? - What? What do you mean? What does it have to do with me?\" Cassandra immediately blushed, already knowing what her friend meant. But she didn't want at all to answer to this personal question by: oh, I am attracted to women, and what about you, and by the way, do you want to date me? And I want to kiss you, and I know I shouldn't, but I can't help but want this, and oh this is not normal since I just met you yesterday, am I falling in love with you? Yes, this was not really the better answer to give to someone you just met... Panic began to invade completely, and she took a deep breath. Hell, did she was afraid. She felt like she was becoming crazy. Galatea gave her a tender smile, and Cassandra felt her beat too much fast and too much loud, like it wanted to escape from her chest. Oh, by the gods, why did Galatea make her feel all these things? And why did she like this a lot? \"Well, after all, since I was created, almost everyone I talked with just talked about my love life, probable, real, non-existent... Whatever... In fact, I was created because a young apprentice hero wanted to finally have a love life! My entire life was build at first around love! So yes, what about your own love life? I am interested by this one, why couldn't I know you better by knowing about you things you already know about me?\" It was not a really subtle way to gain information about it, but it was the only way that Galatea had found which was not scarring like: tell me if you're dating someone or not and who you're attracted by! Yes, she would have sounded too much crazy, and she didn't want to. She didn't know everything about human relationships, but she knew it was something people usually did. \"I don't know a lot of things about you in this matter, Cassandra answered, trying to desperately avoid the conversation, without showing that she didn't want to talk about it.\" She didn't want Galatea to think that she had problems with that kind of things, even if it was the case, because she didn't want the other girl to look at her differently. Galatea shrugged. \"You know that I am not interested by Hercules, or Adonis... Or by any of the boys in the school, for what it matters, if you want to know it... She added carefully, looking at Cassandra's expression, in order to know if it annoyed her or not. Cassandra blinked. \"You... You're only attracted toward women? She asked, surprised, not expecting it. She was surprised, but not horrified, clearly, so Galatea's breath became calmer. - Yes, Galatea said, much more assured than before. Yes, I am.\" Her friend smiled. \"I... I didn't know... I...\" She didn't know what to say. She just bloody didn't know what to tell her. Something neutral? I am happy for you and I accept you as who you are? Indifference? Ok, that's cool for you and I don't care? Personal? And so do I... Yes, this one was good. \"And so do I, she finally said, confessing to her friend and crush one of her biggest secrets.\" Galatea started to her sentence, and looked at her with amazement. And at this precise moment, something just clicked into her head, and she finally understood. Understood that this was not by chance if Cassandra looked at her this way, understood that she may be not the only one who was going to fall in love with someone she had just met. She saw Cassandra's look on her and she immediately understood what she hadn't realized before. The seer just felt the same way as her... Something exploded in her heart, joy, happiness, something like euphoria was crossing through her veins, and a smile came on her face as she understood that she was not alone. Still dancing with Cassandra, still silent, still looking at her like she was the most precious and most beautiful thing and person of the world, she stopped the dance. The seer looked at her with incomprehension, being a little frightened by Galatea's silence. But she was smiling at her, so, it was certainly not something really serious, right? SSSSSSSS Galatea didn't care if someone was looking at them or not. They had been dancing and talking for the previous hour, and she had just realized that Cassandra was interested by her, and all she wanted to do now, was to take her in her arms, and kiss her, and... do things to her she didn't want to think about in public nor do in public, things she didn't know before that she wanted to do. But again, she was born one day ago, so... Suddenly, she took Cassandra's face in her hands, gently, letting her time to escape from her grip or to reject her. Cassandra froze. She knew what was going to happen, and it scared her. A lot. It had been since a long time that she didn't feel like she was falling in love, and these times were more crushes which didn't mean anything than real love interest. But Galatea... She did matter for her. She was afraid of losing her, if it didn't end well. But Galatea was here, smiling at her in a reassuring way, and when she finally kissed her, the seer tried to put the fear away from her. As she kissed Cassandra, Galatea finally felt like she was really happy, like she was at her place, like things were as they should be. She was feeling complete. Behind a pillar of the room, Athena and Aphrodite both let a silent scream of victory escape from their lips. To be continued... During the night of the ball. In the Underworld. At Hades' place. Hades was not happy. Well, you may ask me in which way it changes him from the way he is most of the time, but you just have to know that he was really angry. And ready to do something really evil. (As... usual. Originality!) Well, to be clearer, Hades was... upset. Yes, it's true, he was just terribly and completely upset. For which reason? But just because he still had no important role in this story, of course! (Yes, that's pretty stupid, but a lot of decisions made by Hades in the show were really stupid as well... So, it really doesn't matter. And it's my story, so I do what I want! Author, megalomania, all these other things...) Thanks to his... magic screen, I would say, he looked at the scene and crossed his arms, clearly annoyed. Why wasn't he in this story exactly? He was the villain, he was supposed to be present, right? Not just to be... mentioned like that, rapidly, he was supposed to play a role, to be important. And apparently, the Author had just remembered that he existed, finally! (He had to wait for seven chapters to appear! It was way too long!) And now, here he was, looking at this damn ball, and ruminating his anger. An anger provoked by what exactly? For being stuck into the Underworld and not being the king of the Olympus? Hum... yes, that's one of the other reasons of his bad mood but... that's not the subject! Not for now, at least. No, that was because some of the other gods had been evoked before him, and he wasn't! That was unfair! It was a true scandal! (There are too much exclamation points in this chapter...) Zeus and Hera had been there, because of their link to Hercules (a true mythological inaccuracy, by the way...), Aphrodite and Athena were omnipresent (too much present, according to him), hell, even Cupid had been evoked and he hadn't been before this chapter. His name hadn't even been said! \"But Boss, Panic told him, I don't think there is anything you can do about it! You're a god, but you have no control on this story or on the Author. As us, you're just a character. You can't force her to make you the main character of this story. - This is not what I want, the god answered him, and even if it was, in fact, she already has the intention to do so... In a one shot (and yes, it seems like it will be a real one shot this time, unlike this already too long and stupid and really annoying story...) about the episode \"Hercules and the Pool Party\"! (SPOILERS!). There will be Aphrodite and me, he said, having with a script in his hand given by the author, a non-canon and het pairing (Aphrodite and me, for those who still hadn't understood it), mind control, memory loss (because, why not! This is how the pool works, after all. Even if it is absurd and stupid and forced) and normally, some smut too. And it will be a complete AU, since I will win! Temporarily, at least... She still doesn't know how it ends. Pain frowned. - That seems to be both a good and really cliche idea... Why did she not already write this one? - She wants to, the god said, but she has not a lot of time for her now, she wants to write this story entirely first, and by the way, even if she likes to write smut, she is still uncomfortable with this, she wants it to be detailed, but she is also afraid of detailing too much things. She is afraid of the way her readers (if anyone reads this...) will react, even though she knows this is absurd. So yes, she still didn't write one line of this story, and you know what? I am not even surprised, since...\" The three of them then started as a great noise was heard in the Underworld, and a sentence made of fire (sense of measure, those who will die salute you... Wait, this is absurd...) suddenly appeared in front of them. GO BACK TO THE PLOT! Hades frowned. No one was allowed to give him orders! He was the god of the Underworld, bloody hell! Even if... he didn't like his job, but sometimes, he did fight for it against Hecate, and... (This show never liked continuity... Or logic.) \"Which plot? There is no plot! This chapter is just you babbling about absurd things! Where is the ball plot? The love story between the seer and the woman made of clay? This story is just badly written and stupid! OH SHUT UP! YOU ASKED TO APPEAR IN THIS DAMN STORY! AREN'T YOU HAPPY NOW? - I would be if I was in a good one. I would be if you were not the one writing the dialogues, or the plot, or just even the story itself. SAY THE ONE WHO APPEARS INTO A SHOW WHERE THE HUMOR IS TERRIBLE, WHERE THERE IS NO LOGICAL OR CONTINUITY, AND WHERE EVERYONE INCLUDING YOU IS STUPID... - I never said this show was a good one, but it doesn't mean I want to be in another absurd and bad story. And why on hell are you writing when you talk to me in capital letters? Who do you think you are, God? SINCE I AM WRITING THIS STORY AND THAT I CAN MAKE YOU DO ANYTHING I WANT, THAT MAKES ME KIND OF THE GOD OF THIS STORY, YES. THANKS, I GUESS I SHOULD TAKE IT AS A COMPLIMENT... - Megalomaniac, he muttered for himself. HA, HA! SAYS THE ONE WHO WANTS TO BE THE RULER OF THE ENTIRE WORLD... WELL, OF ALL THE WORLDS, TO BE MORE PRECISE. HYPOCRITE... SO NOW, PLEASE, JUST OBEY TO ME, AND GO BACK TO THIS DAMN PLOT AND TRY TO FIND A PLAN TO INVADE ATHENE OR THE OLYMPUS WHICH IS NOT TOO MUCH STUPID. I WOULD LIKE THAT. He sighed, but nodded, and the fire sentence immediately disappeared. - I hate her, he whispered.\" I HEARD YOU! SSSSSSSS \"So... to invade Athene or the Olympus... Or maybe even both, since I have plenty of free time... Which plan could I choose? He asked himself. - Why not with the pool of forgetfulness? Panic proposed. - I am not sure it is its right name, and the answer is no, the Author wants something not stupid, and by the way, she will re-use this idea later, so no, definitely no. - I guess you don't want to use again one of your former plans, Boss, Pain understood. - Indeed, except with the mask of Cronos, the Author doesn't think any of my plans were brilliant or just even intelligent in any way. Or when the sun was taken from Hercules. The problem is that she doesn't have any idea of plan... And I don't do either....\" After some minutes of reflection, his eyes finally lightened as his mind was crossed by an idea. \"I know! I just have to free all the Titans! - Aren't you supposed to do this plan only in the movie? Pain asked, trying to take care of the continuity for once, since no one ever did usually... He didn't make the obvious remark that it didn't work at all... Hades shrugged. - This story is non-canonical at all, Pain, this is a fanfiction. The Author can do just what she wants, if she wants me to want to free the Titans two years before it really happens, then, she can. And in fact, it will be even better if I do this now, since Hercules' training is not over! Which means he can't defeat me on his own! In fact, why didn't I think about it sooner? That's a brilliant idea! - Well, in the movie, Panic said, you're not supposed to know that Hercules is alive... Which is pretty stupid, when you think about it... But, what about the Fates' prophecies? - Prophecies are made to be ignored. Don't you think that Oedipus would have had a better life if he had done this, instead of trying to fight against it, and then accomplishing this one without knowing he was doing it?\" Hum... That was impossible to contradict... Even if it was much more complex than just that, of course... \"But if you free them now, Panic continued - seeming to be strangely intelligent now, as well as Pain himself. This was refreshing - won't all the other gods be suspicious toward you and defend themselves? - If we were in the show, they wouldn't, they are too much stupid for this, but here... Yes, you're right, he admitted with surprise. - Then what will you do? - I will replace these Titans by copies and doppelgangers of themselves! So no one will ever see the difference, and all the gods won't understand what is falling on them as it does! - You... can do this? The metamorph asked with skepticism. I didn't know you could. - My powers were never clearly defined in the show, so yes, you just have to know that I can. And by the way, I will also ask Echidna for her help, as well as Typhoon's, and their children, and the Giants' too, so, as we attack the Olympus, we won't be less numerous than them. And we will be as powerful as they are! And I will finally win! - When will you attack? Hades had a devilish smile. - In a not long time, two weeks after I freed all the Titans... It won't be easy to keep it a secret for a really long time, so I will have to do it as soon as possible. I just can't waste anymore time. I have been waiting for already too long, he whispered, his hair turning to flames.\" The two imps couldn't help but shiver at the tone of his voice. Their boss was really terrifying when he wanted to be. They just hoped it would work this time. To be continued... Three weeks after the ball. Cassandra didn't remember a time where she was that happy. She had an adorable girlfriend with who she was more and more falling in love as time passed, Icarus was finally leaving her alone (YES!), and she hadn't had a vision of the future since a long, long time. Everything was good and okay. It was strange for her to say or think that, but... yes, it was true. She was happy. Hercules even had succeeded to get a date with Tempest, after he had this dance with her, and after he had surprisingly succeeded to make the singer Orpheus go to the Promethean school and make a concert during the Aphrodite's ball (yes, Cassandra didn't really pay attention to his presence, since she was completely drowned into Galatea's eyes). And even Adonis, if he hadn't stopped acting like a real jerk, had been really less annoying these last times with other people since his break-up with Helen! Yes, I know, that's just a fucking miracle! Helen and her relationship with Paris were going really well too, and no catastrophe including Hercules had happened since at least months! So yes, now, everything was good and okay. It just couldn't last, right? SSSSSSSS The mother of all monsters, Echidna, with her husband Typhon next to her, and with her baby in her arms, surrounded by Orthos, her two-headed Bi-Clops' son, she looked at her visitor. It was not the first - nor the last, unfortunately, she already knew it - time that she was seeing Hades come at her house in order to propose to her some stupid plan to conquer/destroy/ annihilate/insert other aleatory synonyms here, the world. So yes, to say the truth, she was quite suspicious about it. \"Tell me, Hades, Echidna asked him, frowning and crossing her arms, what are you doing here? And what do you want to ask to me?\" He immediately gave her an innocent look - or so he tried - in which she obviously didn't believe at all. \"But my dear Echidna, he said, trying not to be too much charming with her - Typhon was just next to her and was glaring at him in a furious way, not really wanting the god of the Underworld to flirt with his wife - you're completely misunderstanding the reason of my presence here! He exclaimed, trying to be as much convincing as possible. She raised a skeptical eyebrow, her arms still crossed on her chest, her baby now lying on his bed, sleeping peacefully. - Oh, really? You're not going to ask me, my husbands and my children for our help in order to try to use a stupid plan which will consist in you and us trying to conquer/annihilate/destroy/insert another synonymy here, the town of Athene or the Olympus? Because all the times you came here, it was for this only reason! Not that I don't mind a little massacre, the monstrous creature admitted easily, but I would want it to work, this time! - What do you mean? He demanded, still trying to keep his innocent air on his face. She sent him death stares. - Oh, but that's very simple, Hades, king of the Underworld! She almost screamed. I am tired of being every time ridiculed or defeated by this not so really hero and annoying demigod, your nephew, Hercules! And this, every time I try to fight against him! I know I am not the heroine of this story, but in the end, it is really beginning to be irritating to lose every time! I don't want to loose anymore. - Heroes are so annoying, Typhon muttered for himself.\" (HISHE and Villain Pub reference!) The god then send her a victorious smile. \"Well, then Echidna, I have the perfect solution for you! And the perfect plan! - It's not that I don't trust you, Hades, Typhon then said, interfering in the conversation, with a tone which clearly meant that he didn't trust him at all, but the two times we tried to defeat Hercules, me or Echidna - and I am not even talking about Orthos' two failures - we lost. So, please, excuse us if we are not ready to listen to you so easily. Or to think that you will not lead us to a complete defeat this time. - Except that this time, my plan is perfect and infallible! He affirmed, sure of himself.\" He had thought a lot about his plan, after all, so yes, he was really proud of himself! Well... he had thought about it... more than just two minutes... Which was far way better than in the show... \"What kind of plan? Orthos asked, suddenly interested, just before his other head said: and after that, we kill and eat everyone? The monster asked.\" Hades shrugged. \"Well, if you help me into my quest to conquer the Olympus, then, I will let you have Athene. And Sparta. And Argos. And every town in Greece... But you will have to try not to eat everyone, he said with an evil smile.\" Orthos immediately nodded his head, now really interested, being the monster that he was. \"Mom? He begged Echidna. Can we help him? The two heads asked her in unison. - Only if you explain your plan well enough, Hades, Echidna ordered him. And if, of course, you succeed to convince all of us. - Hum, hum... Of course, my dear. But before I tell you what I want to do, I am waiting for someone else to come here.\" After some minutes, a group of people entered into Echidna's and Typhon's house. They were the Giants, a group of people who wanted to free the other Titans as much as Hades wanted. Their chief looked at the god and at the monsters and saluted them. \"Hades! Us, the Giants, we salute you. You asked us to come here because you want to release the Titans from their prisons and their unfair treatment! We want to be on your side!\" Hades sent a smile of triumph at Echidna and Typhon, who had now a look a complete surprise and amazement on their face, their mouths completely opened because of their incredulity. \"You see? The first reason why I think I will win this time and that you will too, is because I am not alone this time! - But Boss! Pain and Panic both complained, as no one, not even Hades or the Author herself had noticed them before, and as they had decided to talk just at this moment, annoyed too not to have any line since the beginning of the chapter. We are here too! They exclaimed with a distraught air. - Yes, yes, of course, he admitted with a clearly tired and annoyed air, I know but you're completely useless to me! In the show and in the movie! So please, let me savor the fact that now, I am really going to get some useful allies! - We still didn't say yes, finally said Echidna, coming back from her surprise. - Yeah, yeah, I was almost forgetting this... So, here is my plan.\" He began to explain them what he wanted to do and how he would, and little by little, the Giants' as the monsters' eyes began to shine with excitement, as they were all beginning to understand that yes, it could potentially really work. Maybe, if they didn't fail before the end, which could still happen. \"So, Echidna? Hades asked her at the end of his explanatory monologue. What do you think about it?\" A really evil and devilish smile crossed the monster's lips. \"Oh, but Hades, you should already know my answer. I'm in... We all are!\" Hades had a satisfied smile. Now here he was... He was going to win soon, and no one would ever get on this way! Too bad that he didn't think about the little seer in the Promethean school... SSSSSSSS The crisis arrived suddenly and exploded some times after Hades and the other villains' reunion. Two weeks after, in fact, not a long time before Hades' attack. It was during diner, and at one moment, Cassandra's eyes had began to be in their spiral's way, and Galatea noticed that some other of the students were beginning to grin at her, and she frowned, not understanding what the hell was going on. Soon, she would find it, and she would not like it at all. And Cassandra, with no explanation, began talking and saying non-sense (or so they thought.) Her voice was, unlike how it was during her predictions, not calm and dull as usual, but completely panicked, which showed how much important and terrifying her vision must be. But of course, as always, no one else than her would care about it. \"I see Hades surrounded by monsters, Echidna, Typhon, and their children, as well as by the Giants, all going to free the Titans from their prison. I see them walking to the Olympus, and fighting against all the Olympian Gods. I see these one being defeated by them, and I see Hades, king of the Olympus and of the universe. I death, horror, massacres, destruction and desolation! She screamed, seeming almost to be ready to have a panic attack there, right now, her green eyes still in spiral.\" Galatea froze, still not understanding what had just happened. Why did Cassandra say such strange and frightening things? And why... why were almost all the students - except herself, Hercules, Helen, Tempest, Circe (new student since not a long time as well as her girlfriend), Medusa (the same. Just know that she found a way to control her power to petrify people and that she integrated herself goodly into the school) - laughing at her like it was not something serious and really grave and important? Just like she hadn't announced the end of the world, of the world they knew! Cassandra came back from her almost possessed state, and saw that everyone or almost was laughing at her, like she expected them to do so, and she did the only reasonable thing that her scared spirit could think about right now. She simply ran away. What she didn't see is that Galatea was ready to go after her, until Hercules, sighing with an annoyed air, stopped her from doing so. \"You should leave her alone... This is what always happens after all her predictions. Except me and some other people, no one ever believes into her visions and into what she sees. Remembering some thing she had learned thanks to Athena's knowledge which had been given to her by the goddess, Galatea understood rapidly the situation. - Wait... Cassandra can see the future? She is a seer? - Yes, indeed. - But... if it's the case, then, she sees the future, what can happen, so... Everyone should listen to her! She just announced a catastrophe, and no one cared! Why?\" And then, she understood something else, something about Cassandra herself. It was the reason why she didn't seem to like people, why she was so sassy and cynical, why she seemed to be so disillusioned about the world and people. No one ever believed in what she said, even if it was the truth. And her, she was condemned to be the one who saw, the one who knew, who always knew, everything and every time, and who had just to see other people not listen to her, and fail, again, and again, and again. No wonder it had broken something into her... No wonder she had trust issues, if she was never trusted or believed by all the other. And she swore, she was going to change it. Before Hercules had time to stop her, she left the room, ready to find the woman she loved, and tell her that she would be here for her. Always. Hercules, as for him, turned back and looked at the entire still laughing crowd. Oh, by the gods, did he despise them... He took a deep breath, ready to do something he had rarely done. Fight for Cassandra. \"Hey, you! He exclaimed, screaming loudly in order to be heard, and all the laughs immediately stopped. Yes, all of you! Aren't you ashamed of yourself? If you're not, then, you should! He looked at them, furious. Are you just stupid? Didn't you learn with time not to laugh about Cassandra's predictions? Isn't she always right about them? Doesn't she always tell the truth, see the truth? Now, please, stop being idiots and laughing about a potential conquest of the world made by my uncle, please! That would be nice.\" He then sat down, now only surrounded by an awkward silence, until Tempest stand up at her turn, talking too. \"Well talked Hercules! I agree with you! And now, if anyone else wants to mock Cassandra or Hercules or anyone else who doesn't deserve to be, then they will have to face my broadsword! She said, taking the object from where it was and brandishing it into the air in a warlike - and really scaring - way.\" Hercules looked at his girlfriend in a loving and proud way, feeling relieved by her reaction, since he knew now that he was not alone and that she would be on his side. \"Shouldn't we go after Cassandra? Medusa asked him, worried. I mean, she must be shocked and hurt by what just happened, if she left this way the place.\" The young hero just shrugged. \"Oh, you don't have to worry. I am sure that Galatea will take care well of her.\" SSSSSSSS \"Cassandra... Cassandra? CASSANDRA? Galatea screamed, worried that she couldn't find her girlfriend. Where are you?\" Walking into the school, Galatea had a sight of relief when she finally saw where the other girl was, but as she saw her, sitting down on the ground, withdrawn onto herself, her head buried into her hands, she felt like her heart was breaking. \"Oh, Cassandra, she whispered for herself, sadness in her heart.\" It became even worst, when, as she walked closer to her, she began to hear Cassandra's sobs, which meant just one thing. She was crying. The woman made of clay immediately felt her rage against all these idiots wake up into her heart and in her veins, even stronger than before, just before she forced herself to stay calm. What mattered now, it was not them. Not at all. It would never be them. It was just Cassandra who needed support and comfort, who needed her help, after the humiliation she had suffered from in the main room of the school. It would always be her who would matter for the young student. Galatea knelt in front of the crying mess that her girlfriend had began in just some minutes. \"Cassandra? She asked her. The other girl didn't hear her, and Galatea frowned. How bad was she feeling exactly so she didn't even notice her presence? Hey, Cassandra! She said louder, trying to touch her shoulder.\" At this precise moment, Cassandra noticed the gesture, and, deeply scared, she went away from the other person, an air of fear on her face. \"Don't... Don't touch me! She hiccuped, still not realizing that it was Galatea who was here, in front of her.\" Because of the tears which had fallen on her face, she was not seeing what was just in front of her, and being too much focused on her own thoughts, she hadn't heard her. Not wanting to scare her even more, Galatea carefully put out her hand from her. \"Hey Cassandra? It's me, it's just me... It's okay, I'm here... It's going to be okay.\" But, just as she was saying these words, Galatea suddenly realized how much futile they were... Just because she was here didn't mean at all that all Cassandra's problems would be solved in the next minutes. It would take so much more time. Wonderful, she couldn't even find the words to comfort Cassandra just at the moment where she needed her the most. What a pathetic girlfriend she was... Blinking, the seer finally succeeded to see through her tears, and she frowned when she realized that it was Galatea who was there. \"Galatea? Oh, I'm sorry, did I scare you? She asked with the same panicked voice she had before. Before Galatea had enough time to tell her that she was sorry that she had scared her, the young woman came back to her full panic mode. Oh, I'm sorry, I'm so sorry about that, about what just happened, when I said all these things, but... I can't control them! This is just... who I am. And I am sorry about that, I am sorry for my visions, and I would understand if you want to break up with me right now, because I am just some freak, and...\" Galatea had a smile full of sadness, seeing the light of fear and terror in Cassandra's eyes, seeing her panic and her anxiety come back after they were buried for such a long time under her mask made of cynicism and irony. She gently took her hands in hers, and looked at her girlfriend in the eyes. \"Cassandra... Listen to me... I don't care you have visions. I don't care people think you're a freak, because for me, you're not. You're a great and wonderful and beautiful and clever and marvelous woman. You're my girlfriend, okay? And I am not going to let you down, or to give you up. I love you, she confessed to her, saying aloud these words to her for the first time, and her smile widened when she saw Cassandra's eyes open wide with surprise. I fell in love the moment I saw you for the first time, when I learned to know you better. I am in love with you Cassandra, and I believe in you. I believe in what you told us.\" And she then ended her confession by kissing passionately her girlfriend's on the lips, and Cassandra immediately relaxed, replying to the kiss. \"So now, tell me more things about this invasion of the Olympus by Hades and the monsters, will you?\" Cassandra sent her a shy smile, before nodding her head, relieved. But yet, Galatea knew that it was not over. And she didn't care, for she was ready to fight the most than she could for her dear Cassandra. To be continued... It's around a cup of hot chocolate that Cassandra finally began to tell her girlfriend and her friends more about what she just saw. \"It was horrible, she began, her hands still trembling as she remembered what she had saw. I was seeing the Olympus, all the gods defeated, imprisoned, put in the Tartarus or killed. And Hades was here, surrounding then, victorious. - Do you know how he intends to do all these things? Tempest asked her, being clearly the best warrior of all of them, with Hercules, of course. - The only thing I am sure about is that he wants to free all the Titans in order to walk on the Olympus and defeat the gods and become the master of the Universe. - But how can he do so? Circe demanded, trying to be logical, for once, unlike the way some of the characters acted most of the time in the show. I mean... all the gods will know it, if the Titans are freed from their prisons, they will obviously notice they are gone. They are well guarded, after all, aren't they? (In the show, they wouldn't have been. Remember when Typhon was released because Hercules is just a really clumsy guy, and, oh, that's so funny? Ha, ha... It's not. Really, really not. I hate the show's humor, and I hate what the writers made or wrote. Most of the time, the truth is that it doesn't apply to the episode consecrated to Artemis.) - Except if he replaces them by copies of them, so no one will notice they are gone, Galatea suddenly understood, immediately getting pale.\" All of them looked at her with surprise, not understanding what she meant, and they all started when she used her powers and turned her hairs into snakes looking like the one Medusa had on her head. Then, she turned herself into a copy of Aphrodite, almost looking like a sister of the goddess, making it really difficult to know which one was the real one, had Aphrodite been here next to her at this moment. Galatea sighed. \"I am made of clay and I was born of two goddesses, born thanks to their magic and with my power, I can fake almost everything, and I am just a mortal. Can you imagine what Hades, a god, can do with his powers? He is not stupid, not anymore, he wants to win, he will need as much allies as possible, and he needs to make a surprise attack. - Oh, Hercules asked her, you mean like the surprise attack that Miltiades made and which helped him and the other win the battle of Marathon?\" A great voice then came out from nowhere, responding immediately to the young man's question, as a sentence made of flames (again, sense of measure, all these things...) wrote itself on a wall in front of them. DON'T YOU DARE MAKING ANY REFERENCE TO THE INFAMOUS EPISODE KNOWN AS \"HERCULES AND THE OWL OF ATHENS\", OR I SWEAR I WILL MAKE YOU THE VICTIM IN MY NEXT HERCULES' FANFIC! OH, WAIT... IT'S ALREADY DONE, SORRY ABOUT THAT! BYE! They all looked at each other. \"What was that? Medusa asked. Cassandra shrugged. - The author just wanted to complain about an insignificant thing she didn't like in the show. Don't pay any attention to her, she just wants to look like she is interesting. She will soon stop, don't worry.\" Medusa nodded, still not being used to be written into such a... strange story with such a strange author. (Oh, if only she knew.) I AM INTERESTING!!! They just ignored her. (Because, spoiler: she is not.) \"So, then, Circe asked them, what do we do? I mean... we just can't do nothing against Hades' plans, right? - We fight, Tempest answered her. The best we can, because I guess the battle had already begun, since you've got usually your visions not a long time before they happen for real, right Cassandra? So, I guess we have just a little time to act. - Indeed, the seer answered with a serious air. The battle must have just begun, I think. - So, Galatea continued, we have to go to the Olympus, and save the gods from their fate. Save our family, she said, looking at Hercules, since they both had divine parents on Mount Olympus.\" He nodded, and they both went to the Mount Olympus, decided to defeat Hades and all his allies. SSSSSSSS The gods didn't see what was coming on them. It was so... unexpected, that, except Athena, Artemis and Ares (who always - or almost - had war artifacts on them) none of them was really ready to fight against Hades, the Titans, the Giants or Echidna and all her family of monsters. To say that they were easily beaten would certainly be a euphemism. They were defeated really easily, and even Hades thought that it was, in fact, almost too easy. But the reason why they were loosing was quite easy to understand. They weren't prepared, and Hades had not only the Titans with him, but also a lot of other allies. The other thing none of them was expecting too, is that they would get some help, in the end. Not only coming from Hercules himself, of course, but also from all his friends. (Except Icarus. I hate Icarus. He is such an annoying/boring/terrible character. I am sure you still didn't notice it, did you? Well, it's not like I have been very subtle at any time in that matter... Not that I needed to be either. Long live the too much long digressions! What was I saying... Oh, yes! The battle!) Hercules and his super strength and his training to become a hero which made him really strong. Tempest and her skills of Amazon warrior. Circe and her magic thanks to her magical stick. Galatea who could change her body made of clay into almost everything and who would be surely really useful in the battle. Without forgetting Medusa and her power to turn people into people. And Cassandra... Hum... What can I really say about her? Well, she... can predict every hit which could be made against her? Hum... no... That doesn't work at all. The truth is that she would not really be that useful during the fact, at least, I tried... (But she would still be more useful than Icarus. Ah, I just can't stop myself, that's terrible! I hate him so much!) Well, she knows how to well defend herself, that's it. (After all her fights with Icarus, that's understandable. I should stop talking about him... That would be better for everyone, for me, for him, and especially for you.) Galatea's first reflex as she arrived on Mount Olympus was to go the gods who were now locked up by magical chains, and she turned her hand into a key that she used to free them (since Hades had not a chain which enchained one god but all the other), and she released them really rapidly. At this same moment, Medusa had began fighting against the Giants only with her eyes, and in only five minutes, she succeeded to petrify all of them, while Cassandra was jumping on them and forcing them to open their eyes after they had understood the woman's power. Tempest, using her sword, went to fight against Echidna and the rest of her family, Typhon, Orthos, and all the others, helped in this task by Athena, Ares and Artemis (the best warrior of all the gods), the battle was harsh and long, but they did succeed in the end to win against them. Circe, using her magic, decided to go to fight against the four Titans, helping Hercules who just used his physical strength against them, while she was immobilizing them. While Zeus was sending them thunderbolts, which weakened them more and more. All the gods, even the non warriors one, were helping during the fight, Poseidon using his trident, Hera using her husband's thunderbolts, as she did with Typhon the first time they had fought against him, Aphrodite helped too, as Bacchus, Hermes, Hestia, Demeter... Yes, all of them were present! To say the truth, everyone did participate to the final battle, and everyone had a role to play. (Unlike what happened unluckily at the end of the movie... Just thirty seconds to fight and kill all the Titans? Really Hercules? Couldn't it be less insulting, please? Couldn't we get a really epic and good final battle against them? No? Well, no...) And Hades... Hades tried to flee, of course, as he saw that all his allies were being defeated by simple mortals (without them, the gods would have been beaten, that's sure), but he was stopped by Cassandra herself, who just... knocked him out from behind. (Yes, please, forget what I just said before, she was really useful during this battle. YOU GO GIRL! This character deserved so much better than what she had the right to get...) Yes, it could be a villain's end more... epic. But sometimes, it's not, and to say the truth, I had no idea of how to end this. (I shouldn't say this to you, this is quite absurd and stupid...) So, yeah, here is the end of this chapter, this story has no sense anymore, everybody already left it and no one care anymore. And as the heroes won, everyone in the story is happy (except Hades), and the next chapter will be the last one and will be about Cassandra's and Galatea's relationship! So, see you soon! To be continued... \"Did you know it happened by accident? By chance? - What do you mean? - Us. Our love. Our relationship. It was not supposed to happen this way, at first. It just happened because a goddess cast a spell different from the one she was supposed to cast. And before magic decided not to work this time.\" (And because a bored author didn't know what to write and just wanted to make fun of a show she despised and that no one cared about. And trust me, I get bored really rapidly.) \"You were supposed to be created for Hercules, I know it... - But it didn't happen this way.\" Galatea smiled at her girlfriend. \"I'm happy it didn't happen this way... - And so am I...\" An awkward silence then took place between them, before Cassandra said abruptly: \"I'm not perfect. - I know it, it's not like I was perfect either. - Yes, of course, but... what I mean is that... I am not a perfect girlfriend. I am not like all the girls, or like all the people in general. I am not... normal.\" Galatea had a mischief smile. \"Did I ever say that I wanted you to be normal? You're talking to someone who is made of clay, who was brought to life by two goddesses and by magic. You should know I don't mind a little \"non-normality\" in my life, since I am not really that normal myself. - Galatea! The teenager protested with a smile on her lips. I am trying to be serious! So please, listen to me. I love you, she said with a grave air. But, Galatea, I am a seer, and people think I am really strange, and... I can't contradict them about that. They are right, I am kind of... a freak. And I'm cursed, this is something you should be aware of. - Cassandra... You may not be believed by everyone all the time about your predictions, but you have to know that I believe in you. And I always will. As our other friends, we believe in you, we believe that what you see is not just something you imagined, we all know that it's real. We will never judge you because of that, or because of what you see.\" The seer tried to smile. \"I know it, I really do, but... That's not the only problem I have got.\" There was fear in her eyes, and Galatea frowned, feeling that something else was wrong. \"What kind of problem? She then asked her, not really understanding what the other woman really meant. - I have a problem with people. A lot of problems, in fact. I... don't like people, generally. And people don't like me either. - And so what? What does it have to do with me or us? - I'm afraid you might... realize I am not the right person for you. I am a misanthropic seer who has anxieties when she is surrounded by a great crowd, I don't succeed easily to get friendship with other people, I... I have relationship problems. And issues. Galatea, I have a lot of issues. - And it makes you believe that I am going to leave you alone because of that? Cassandra, I know who you are, and I love you because of who you are. You're a brilliant, amusing, sarcastic girl, and Cassandra, you saved the entire Olympus and the world itself in the same time thanks to your visions! I love you the way you are, in your bizarre way... - You're sure of that? Really? You know, as I told you, I... I am not used to relationships in general. I have friends now, so I do know how it works, with people like Circe, Hercules, Medusa or Helen, or even Tempest (but not Icarus, not anymore Icarus! Please, just forget his existence!). But... I was never in love for real before I met you, I had a little crush on Helen once, but that's it. - Almost everyone already had once a crush on Helen, according to what I heard of, Galatea said with a little laugh, and Cassandra chuckled. You know, you're my first relationship too... The first person I fell in love with. - What if it doesn't last? What if you stop... - Stop loving you? There is no chance it can ever happen. - How can you be sure of this?\" The classical line \"you're the love of my life/my true love/my soulmate\" or all these things would have been too much... classical. So, she decided to say something else. To tell her how she perceived her. To tell her how much she admired her. \"You're funny. Sarcastic. Clumsy with people too, or in general, and it's something I like in you. You're cynical. You love to read, like me, you're passionate. When I talk with you, I feel like I am with someone who really understands and completes me. You're... Cassandra, you're wonderful, and I just can't believe no one ever saw this in you before me!\" Cassandra tried to smile. It was... the first time in her life that someone was trying to tell her that she really was someone important. That she worth it, and that she was not just some... strange seer. That she could be more. It wax the first time that someone was really accepting her the way she was, and except her parents, or her other friends, no one ever really did this before. Thanks to her, now, she was fully accepted in the school, and no one was thinking of her as a freak, in fact, Galatea had truly changed her life. \"I love you Galatea... Without you I think I would be totally lost and alone, you... She smiled. You changed my life, and thanks to you, now... My life is completely different, I never felt that accepted before you arrived in my life.\" Galatea smiled and kissed her. \"And you changed my life too...\" The end.",

      "Shyly, she took place at the table, not being able to stop looking at Cassandra, who still had the same air of desperation on her face that Galatea just wanted to take from her.",
      "She frowned.",
      "By the gods, what was happening to her?",
      "Cassandra rapidly noticed her presence, but didn't really care about it, after all, this was not the first pretty girl who was sitting at their table.",
      "Andromeda had done it once, just as Electra, for just one time, (Cassandra was happy not to see her anymore, by the way), and so did Tempest or Helen sometimes, so why would she take into account this girl who would surely be soon gone?",
      "It was not as if her life was going to become suddenly really interesting thanks to her.",
      "After some seconds, Hercules finally realized that she was here, he started, and then, he smiled at her.",
      "\"Hum, Galatea... Hey!",
      "I am happy to see you there.",
      "Icarus, Cassandra, may I introduce you to Galatea, my... (He couldn't consider her as his girlfriend, as she already clarified that it was not who she was, so...).",
      "- Hum, hum, he repeated, a little embarrassed, as Icarus and Cassandra were now looking at the adolescent in front of them.",
      "She will be my dance partner for the Aphrodite's ball, he announced, trying not to be too much arrogant, as it already ended bad for him during the day.\"",
      "At his words, Cassandra's eyes began to shine and she finally let an ironic smile come on her lips, which just made Galatea's heart beat even faster than before, for a reason she didn't understand.",
      "Then, she plunged herself in Cassandra's green eyes that she was now finding more beautiful than ever, and doing this, she forgot for a moment the entirety of the world.",
      "She gave herself an internal slap, trying to again stay focused on the current situation.",
      "\"Oh?",
      "So you're the clay doll that Hercules asked Aphrodite to create for him so he would not go alone to this stupid ball... - By the way, Icarus interrupted her, will you finally accept to go to this with me?",
      "Cassandra just sighed and rolled her eyes.",
      "- Again, Icarus, the answer is just no, no, NO! Can you understand this word or are you too much stupid for this?",
      "In fact, it wouldn't surprise me if it was the case...",
      "She muttered for herself.",
      "Now, please, leave me alone!",
      "What was I saying?",
      "She continued.",
      "Oh, yes...",
      "You're the clay doll that this idiot had the inconsistency of creating because he is just unable to have normal sociable interactions with people.",
      "Just as I do, but at least, I assume my misanthropic side, unlike him.",
      "- Cassandra!",
      "Hercules protested, as Galatea was staying frozen, surprised and totally petrified by Cassandra's sardonic and venomous tone, that she didn't expect at all.",
      "Don't be too much harsh on her, she is new here, you will scare her with your attitude!\"",
      "The seer just shrugged, not seeming to care about Galatea's opinion.",
      "She had given up since a long time the idea of having real friends, apart Hercules, Icarus, and Helen.",
      "Galatea tried to smile, hesitantly, and Cassandra made the reflection to herself that the young woman and former statue did have a beautiful smile, before chasing this thought the furthest she could into her spirit.",
      "Yeah, it was better if she didn't let her lesbian side take the control in her, she had to forget that she had realized not a long time ago that she preferred women to men.",
      "It was not as if she could be interested by Galatea, who didn't seem to get more for her than her pretty face, and it was not as if Galatea could be interested by her as well.",
      "\"No, Hercules...",
      "She assured him immediately.",
      "It's okay, don't worry for me.",
      "I guess I just have to adapt myself to... human habits.",
      "This world is still very new to me.",
      "- Oh, that's so?",
      "Cassandra answered to her with a legitimate surprise.",
      "A girlfriend of you who accepts my sarcastic and cynical remarks, Hercules?",
      "That's a good point for her.",
      "It's so rare here to find people who fully appreciate irony...",
      "This time, a real smile appeared on her face, and it made Galatea blush for some seconds.",
      "I am happy to meet you Galatea.",
      "But by the way, Hercules, she added with a smirk, aren't you supposed to already have a crush on Tempest?",
      "Did you just... forget her by seeing Galatea come to life?",
      "Hercules rolled his eyes.",
      "- Cassandra, Galatea is not my girlfriend!",
      "She was enough clear about that subject, he added, being still a little bitter about it.",
      "- So you would have wanted her to be so, hum?",
      "Icarus said, then joining the conversation, not being at all subtle in any way (indeed, it was not his best quality...",
      "Does Icarus even have qualities, in fact?).\"",
      "Galatea looked at him some seconds, before beginning to contemplate again Cassandra, who had still noticed nothing, unlike Hercules, who frowned, before thinking that it was just because Galatea didn't really know how to interact with people.",
      "If only he knew the truth...",
      "Cassandra rolled her eyes a new time and tried not to sigh too much loud.",
      "\"Icarus, she asked him, could you please leave us and annoy someone else?\" Surprisingly, the young man obeyed and left the table, because he had finished eating (and also because the Author didn't want him anymore to be present in the scene and in the chapter, and because one line of dialogue is already too much to give to him).",
      "Galatea then began to eat, being terribly hungry for the first time in her life, still looking at Cassandra.",
      "This one then allowed herself to have a sigh of relief.",
      "Oh, by the gods, she was not going to support him during the rest of the year, before that, she would either kill him or become mad (AND then kill him, obviously).",
      "Galatea stayed silent for some seconds, amazed at the new tastes she was now experimenting, tasting something totally new for her.",
      "\"Tell me, she finally asked to Cassandra after finishing from eating rapidly, and being terribly curious, is this...",
      "Icarus, your boyfriend?\" Cassandra then looked at her with a look of pure horror and disgust.",
      "\"No! (Oh, hell, she had the impression to be back to the Circe's episode, where Helen had kept telling her again and again that indeed, Icarus was her boyfriend, while he was not and would never be!",
      "Why kept everyone thinking this absurd thing?",
      "Oh yes, it was just because this stupid Icarus kept harassing her!",
      "What a gift he was...) - He is not my boyfriend!",
      "She almost screamed.",
      "And he will never be!",
      "If you're interested by him, she said, you can go after him, you can trust me, that would give me holidays that I really need right now...",
      "He is annoying me in a way you can't even imagine... - In fact, I am not...",
      "Totally not.",
      "(He is not the one I am interested by, by the way, she told to herself, still devouring Cassandra with her eyes).",
      "I was just... curious.\"",
      "She was feeling relieved of this revelation in a way she still couldn't understand.",
      "What was she feeling exactly?",
      "She should ask Aphrodite and Athena about it, after all, they were her new \"parents\" now, no?",
      "They had to know what it was, that she was feeling toward Cassandra.",
      "An awkward silence then took place between the three people, before Cassandra said something: \"So, you were created by Aphrodite and Athena, right?",
      "If Hercules told me well, it makes you their daughter, right?",
      "How does it feel, to be the daughter of two goddesses?",
      "Galatea shrugged.",
      "- I don't really know.",
      "I mean, I don't know as well what it is to have parents, so I don't know at all what it is too.",
      "Again, it's something really new to me.",
      "She took a deep breath, before daring to say: Talking about new things... Cassandra, will you accept to make me visit the Promethean school tomorrow?",
      "It will be a place where I will stay for a long time, so I would want to know it better.",
      "(Just as I want to know you better, she thought.)\" Cassandra thought at first that the other girl could have asked this to Hercules first, since he would be her dance partner the day after, but she then told herself that the new student just wanted to make friends.",
      "She sadly smiled to herself, missing Galatea's fascinated look, thinking about the fact that soon, when she would know how she was considered (and the fact that she was on the \"looser'\" side), she would rapidly go away from her.",
      "And it saddened her in a way she couldn't understand either.",
      "She just nodded.",
      "\"Oh...",
      "Of course!",
      "It won't be really long, since there are not so much things to see, but it's okay for me... - Thank you very much, Cassandra, Galatea told her, before sending her a too much brilliant and shining smile and Cassandra really tried not to find her too much beautiful.\"",
      "She couldn't, of course.",
      "Hercules looked at the two women during the exchange, and he frowned a new time, feeling the connection present between them, deciding that he would then talk to Cassandra, in order to know what was happening.",
      "Even if a part of him already knew what it was, for Galatea herself, at least.",
      "Indeed, he was more and more understanding the reason why he was not Galatea's \"type\".",
      "Melancholic, he thought about Tempest, and looked at her briefly, who was not really far from him and who was eating with Ajax, and the young and future hero felt a wave of jealousy cross through him.",
      "He knew it was childish, but he couldn't help it.",
      "Galatea noticed his look and understood rapidly the reason why he had acted this way with her.",
      "\"You did this for her, right?",
      "Create me...",
      "Because you couldn't have her, you wanted her to be jealous.",
      "- Indeed, Galatea, you're right...",
      "I know that it was stupid, but... - And also irrational.",
      "- In fact, I am sorry for my behavior, and I am happy of your existence, and I hope that despite what I did, we will be friends one day.",
      "Galatea had a little smile.",
      "- I think it's a possibility...\" During their conversation, Cassandra, finally freed from Icarus and happy of it (just as everyone was.",
      "Especially me.) had taken a roll of papyrus from her bag and had began to read it passionately.",
      "It was a book from Aristotle, Nicomachean Ethics, and thanks to the knowledge Athena had given her, Galatea identified him a being a philosopher, and a good one if she was not wrong, and her curious part became immediately interested, and she thought about getting a copy of the book for herself.",
      "When she saw Cassandra smile, reading the book which interested her so much, Galatea felt something else, something new and that she still didn't understand.",
      "Something like the beginning of love feelings.",
      "To be continued...",
      "After she made sure that Galatea was fine, Aphrodite left the school, while Athena came back to the Mount Olympus, and the goddess of love decided to go to see Cupid immediately, not caring about the hour of the night.",
      "She didn't show it too much to Athena, but she was indeed worried about it.",
      "Even if Galatea was born not a long time ago, Aphrodite had already grown attached to her, as well as Athena did, so she just wanted her to be okay and happy.",
      "She didn't want her new adoptive daughter to get her heart broken.",
      "And it risked to happen, if Cassandra appeared not to be sensible to her charms, except of course if she asked Cupid to send a magical arrow on the young seer with his \"Armageddon arc\".",
      "It would be cheating, of course, but by casting her spell, she had already cheated a little, right?",
      "And by the way, she was a goddess, so, why would she care?",
      "So yes, as she entered in the god's house, she was feeling a little nervous.",
      "What if the spell couldn't be reversed?",
      "What if she had done a terrible mistake?",
      "When Cupid opened his door, Aphrodite suddenly started, realizing that indeed, it was pretty late and that she had woken up him, regarding to his tired look, and the thing is that she should have waited before coming.",
      "He frowned.",
      "\"Aphrodite?",
      "What are you doing here?",
      "- Oh, excuse me Cupid, I didn't realize it was that late...",
      "I can come back later if you want me to.",
      "He just shrugged.",
      "- Well, now that I am awake...",
      "Enter, he invited her.\"",
      "She sat down on a chair, and, some minutes later, the god gave her a cup of tea.",
      "\"Hum... Thanks, she said with circumspection.",
      "Aren't we supposed to drink/eat something like ambrosia or nectar?",
      "Since we are Greek gods... - The Author loves too much to make anachronisms, don't you remember that Athena had a mobile phone with her in chapter two?",
      "Well, you and I, we drink tea.",
      "So, tell me, why are you here?",
      "- Oh yes, I almost forgot it...",
      "Five or six hours ago, Hercules, our... well, Zeus' and Hera's son (it will be much easier to say it this way, even if it has no fucking sense since this is not accurate.), asked me to create a girlfriend for him, made of clay, because he couldn't find a dance partner for the ball of tomorrow.",
      "- Wow... Cupid reacted, being not impressed at all.",
      "That's really... interesting, right?",
      "- Don't be too much mocking Cupid, right?",
      "I mean, it's the plot which was used for the episode of which this story itself is inspired by.",
      "- Maybe, but...",
      "I mean, did they want to make a cheap version of Pygmalion's myth?",
      "- I'm afraid they did, with even more sexism than in the original story.",
      "- Please Aphrodite, tell me you didn't do this.",
      "When he saw her guilt look, he sighed and then rolled his eyes.",
      "You did it!",
      "- Yes!",
      "But I gave her a real personality, unlike what my nephew/half-brother/I already lost myself in the family tree asked me!",
      "I created her, helped by Athena, I cast my spell on her to make her fall in love with Hercules, and everything was okay, but... - But something went wrong?",
      "- Hum, yes...",
      "The spell didn't make Galatea fall in love with Hercules, but with Cassandra.",
      "- Cassandra?",
      "The seer who was cursed by Apollo, your dear brother?",
      "- Yes, originally, in the myth.",
      "But here, since my brother is supposed to be a good guy, just say that she was just born this way.",
      "- What?",
      "But it makes no sense... - The show was never clear about the fact that she was cursed, since her predictions were sometimes believed, and sometimes not, so yes, we can as well be as obscure as they were.",
      "- Tell me, in which way is it a problem?",
      "The fact that she has feelings for this girl in particular?",
      "- This was not supposed to happen this way!",
      "- Are you sure at all that you made her fall in love with Cassandra with your magic?",
      "Cupid asked her with curiosity.",
      "- Hum... I don't know.",
      "When I decided to cast the spell, I was thinking about Cassandra's situation, and about how lonely she was, and the fact that I wanted to fix it...",
      "Tell me Cupid, is it possible at all to reverse or break this spell if Cassandra doesn't fall in love with Galatea?",
      "I don't want my daughter to suffer from this because of my mistake.\"",
      "Cupid had a little smile, when he heard that Aphrodite was already considering Galatea as being her real daughter, not just her creation.",
      "\"I'm sorry to disappoint you, Aphrodite, but this is not something you or I can do.",
      "- Wait, what?",
      "What do you mean? Why?",
      "- Your spell didn't work at all, in fact, you're not the one who made Galatea fall in love with Cassandra, it happened for one reason.",
      "- Which one?",
      "- I'm surprised you still didn't see it, Aphrodite.",
      "That's not because your spell is too powerful, since the spell was not cast.",
      "The fact that you thought about Cassandra at this moment didn't make the spell work, that's not at all the reason why Galatea fell, well, is falling for Cassandra.",
      "That's just because they are soulmates.",
      "- Sou... Soulmates?",
      "So you mean that this is not my fault?",
      "The goddess asked, an air of relief on her face.",
      "The god just nodded his head.",
      "- Absolutely...",
      "This time, in fact, it was not.",
      "- Hey!",
      "- What?",
      "Is it not your type to do this and ruin people's life?",
      "- I didn't ruin that much lives!",
      "Well...",
      "These last times, at least, I didn't.",
      "- Maybe, maybe...",
      "So, now that you have your answers, could you please go and let me sleep?",
      "- Please, answer to this last question...",
      "Why did Cassandra not react to it?",
      "- Galatea was created by magic, by your magic, so she is more sensible to love and the magic of love that you do.",
      "That's the reason why she felt it, and that Cassandra didn't.",
      "- Okay...",
      "Thanks, and sorry for disturbing you.\"",
      "SSSSSSSS To say the truth, Galatea didn't care at all about the Promethean school, how it looked like or its history, or anything else which could be said about it.",
      "All she cared about was to spend some time with Cassandra, and it was the only thing she had really found to make the young woman stay with her, without it being too much strange, so it was only a pretext.",
      "After passing the night into a bed, and sleeping for the first time of her life (indeed, Galatea's existence was now going to be full of first times, regarding to the fact that she was born just the day before), she had woken up at 9 AM, had went to the room where everyone ate.",
      "Since the ball of Aphrodite would be just during the evening, it was a day-off for all the students, giving them time to prepare themselves or to get excited for an event which was something really banal when you thought about it, since there was a tone of balls in this school...",
      "(Hell, two of the sixty-five episodes of this show were done with an entire plot about a ball.",
      "This one, the one with Orpheus... Almost three, with the episode about Theseus, as there is a ball in this episode too.",
      "Why did they have to do that?",
      "It was just... not interesting!",
      "And sometimes really stupid.",
      "As usual, I would say.)",
      "She had eaten her breakfast alone, as Hercules was now training with Philoctetes, Cassandra was working/reading on her own in her room, alone (misanthropy and all these things...), and Icarus...",
      "Well, I have no idea where Icarus can be!",
      "You know what?",
      "I just... don't care.",
      "He has no importance, role or even usefulness in this story, so, why would I bother to add him in this one?",
      "I mean, I don't like Adonis as well, so he is not present either, so why would I let Icarus stay here?",
      "I won't have to write about a character I don't like, and the fans of Icarus (if there are some here.",
      "Well, if they exist at least) won't be too much angry at me!",
      "(If they didn't leave immediately the story during chapter 1 when they read the warning I let about this character...) Just imagine that he is spending time with his father, or with his mother (yeah, you remember her?",
      "The one we just heard about in the last episode of the show!), or at home, or that he decided not to go to the ball since Cassandra didn't want to go with him.",
      "Or that, as I like to imagine it, he is trying again to fly too close to the sun and that it will burn him for real this time, or that he was finally definitely eaten by Jealousy, or that he was not brought back by Hercules after he died because of the Tapestry of the Fates...",
      "Just imagine what you want, he is just not here anymore.",
      "So, here is the end of the digression.",
      "Galatea was eating alone, waiting for Cassandra to come there, not knowing what else to do (they had decided to begin the visit at 11 AM, before eating together again), walking then in the school, wandering here and there, before she found out where the library of the campus was.",
      "Her eyes began to shine when she also realized how huge this library was.",
      "If she was mainly Aphrodite's creation, the thing is that she was as well created by Athena, the goddess of wisdom herself, which meant that she had a great interest in knowledge of all kinds, meaning literature too.",
      "She had not a great knowledge in this, for the simple reason that she had not read anything for real before this day (but thanks to Athena, she knew how to read), but she had a real interest, so, she then decided to go to it, and borrowed some books to read before Cassandra's arrival.",
      "In fact, these one were so much interesting that she lost herself in them, reading during the two hours before the moment where her and Cassandra were supposed to begin the visit together.",
      "SSSSSSSS After eating, Cassandra began searching for Galatea, that she found nowhere at first, before she saw Helen of Troy (by the way, why to call her of Troy?",
      "Since she never left for Troy for a really long time, except for one or two days in one episode, and since she is not from Troy.",
      "And why did they make the reference of the horse in one episode since it was not related to anything?) reading alone, this time far from Adonis and his group of \"popular\" people.",
      "\"Excuse-me, Helen, do you have any idea of the place where Galatea could be?",

      "You're searching for someone who is not Hercules or Icarus?",
      "Do you do this because you want to have a date with her?\" Cassandra simply rolled her eyes.",
      "\"Tell-me Helen, why on hell do you want me to date at least the half of the Greece?",
      "I am not searching for a boyfriend, nor a girlfriend, okay?",
      "When will you understand this simple truth, that is to say, that I prefer to be alone?",
      "First, you thought I wanted to be with Icarus (eurk...), and now, you think I want to be with Galatea?",
      "I just met her yesterday.\"",
      "(Even if she couldn't deny the fact that a part of her was attracted to her.)",
      "Helen had a sad sigh.",

      "- What?",
      "Off-screen?",
      "- Yes!",

      "The first one, I mean.",
      "- Did you know that Circe had finally found a girlfriend?",
      "I mean, the truth is that she finally understood that there was a reason which explained the fact that every time she had a boyfriend, it went badly.",
      "- By badly, you mean, her turning them into animals, as she did it with Adonis and Hercules?",
      "- Hum, yes... - What does it have to do with me? - Huh...",
      "You could get Galatea as your girlfriend?",
      "And have someone?",

      "Helen then had a desperate sigh (a false one, of course.",

      "I guess you will find her there.",
      "- Thanks Helen.",
      "And again, please, stop definitely to try to find for me a boyfriend/girlfriend/random love interest, because I just can't get more of this!",
      "You're a nice girl, Helen, and I am happy you finally regained your senses and left Adonis, but this doesn't mean you have to try to make me be less misanthropic/alone.",
      "I am happy the way I am.",
      "The other woman sighed again.",
      "- I guess I just have to let you try to do this on your own... - Yes, do this please.",
      "That would be a great blessing for me.\"",
      "Helen nodded another time and plunged herself back into her book, while Cassandra was beginning to walk into the direction of the library, as did Galatea some time ago.",
      "SSSSSSSS The Promethean school's library was one of the places that Cassandra liked the most on the campus, at first because it was a place where Icarus didn't like at all to go (he was not really the book type, to say the truth.",
      "Well, except Helen and Cassandra, no one really was in this school), but also because she loved literature.",
      "So much.",
      "It really helped, in fact, to read books, not just because she liked reading, but also because it helped her a lot to escape.",
      "Escape from the world, escape from the curse, and especially, escape from herself.",
      "It was a place where no one considered her as being a freaking monster, since no one ever paid attention to her.",
      "It was a calm place, where she could be alone and safe.",
      "So a part of her was glad that Galatea had chosen to go to this place on her first day on the Promethean school.",
      "The thing was that Cassandra was partly agoraphobic.",
      "A thing she never told to anyone (only her parents knew this) was that, some times, she just couldn't support to have people around her, and what people saw as being misanthropy, was just... fear, and social anxiety.",
      "She didn't really like to be with people, and some times, it was worst than at others, and, as she entered in the library, some of her anxiety just faded away, and she took a deep breath.",
      "There, it was almost like she was at home now.",
      "Her heart missed a beating when she saw that Galatea was there, reading, with a smile on her lips, which sometimes turned into a true laugh when she seemed to read a really funny passage.",
      "Cassandra surprised herself by thinking that her laugh was indeed really beautiful.",
      "What the hell... was Helen romantic side too much influencing her?",
      "What the hell was that?",
      "She was just supposed to be a depressed and misanthropic seer who didn't like people, not some banal woman who fell for the first pretty girl who passed in front of her eyes!",
      "Cassandra, despite this, continued staring intensely at Galatea, before walking silently into her direction.",
      "She was so absorbed into her reading that she barely noticed that Cassandra had sat down next to her.",
      "This one hawked discretely, and it made Galatea suddenly raise her head from her book, and she started immediately as she saw her.",
      "\"Oh, Cassandra...",
      "She blushed a little, a thing that her friend didn't notice, luckily for her.",
      "What are you doing...",
      "Then, her eyes opened wide, when she realized which time it was now, and she put her hand on her mouth, showing her shock.",
      "- Oh... I...",
      "I am sorry, Cassandra!",
      "I just completely forgot that I was supposed to visit the school with you, I was...",
      "I was so interested by the book I was reading that I didn't notice that time was passing so quickly!",
      "- Don't worry, it's not a problem, I know what it is to loose yourself completely into a book.",
      "Which book were you reading actually?",
      "She asked her with curiosity, looking at the roll of papyrus in the hands of the new student.",
      "- Oh...",
      "It's a play written by Aristophanes, Lysistrata.",
      "Did you read it?",
      "- Yes, I did, it's a really funny play... - I agree!",
      "Galatea exclaimed with an enthusiastic smile which made Cassandra smile too.\"",
      "Looking at Galatea's desk, Cassandra then frowned, seeing a lot of rolls of papyrus, maybe too much, in fact.",
      "\"You borrowed all of them?",
      "Whoa!",
      "Parenthesis and the teachers were really not really soft with you for your first week of school, if they asked you to read all of this.\"",
      "At her turn, Galatea frowned with surprise before blinking, some seconds before understanding what her friend meant.",
      "\"What?",
      "Oh, no...",
      "It was not asked by any of the teachers, in fact, they told me I would begin the classes the next week.",
      "They give me some time to adapt, these one are just books I want to read because when Athena created me she gave me knowledge about these one, and other.",
      "But as I actually still hadn't read them, I want to do so.",
      "Just in order to know what it's about.",
      "And the thing is that they are really interested.\"",
      "At this moment, Cassandra felt her heart beat faster than ever, and she couldn't help, but smile, immediately forgetting about the fact that she was supposed to make her friend visit the school during the day.",
      "Had she finally met someone like her?",
      "Despite her habitual instincts, she decided to come closer to the young woman.",
      "\"Do you need some help?\"",
      "To be continued...",
      "When the two girls stopped talking about their different reading, it was already 1 PM.",
      "Unlike what Cassandra could have firstly thought, Galatea really seemed to be interested by her company, and it warmed the seer's heart, to know that someone other than Icarus or Hercules liked to be with her, and talk with her, and didn't look at her like she was some freak, just because of her \"gift\".",
      "For the first time in a long time, Cassandra didn't feel like she was alone anymore, and she was not this time with someone who was with her because she had no one else (Galatea could have become someone really popular really rapidly, if she had wanted to), but because she did want to be with her.",
      "And it was good.",
      "Galatea was apparently a quick reader, and her and Cassandra rapidly had a debate about which play written by Aristophanes was the best, or about the tragedies, and who between Aeschylus, Sophocles and Euripides was the best one.",
      "Galatea had looked at the young student during the discussion, seeing her finally go out of her usual apathy as she was dealing with a subject which apparently really interested her, and she had felt this strange feeling come back into her chest.",
      "The woman made of clay knew that she was herself considered as being beautiful (she was created by the goddess of love and beauty.",
      "She had been made by her to be beautiful, according to the criteria of the period), but the thing is that, as she looked more and more at her new friend, seeing her eyes shine with interest, her smile growing more and more, she found her just being truly magnificent.",
      "They had talked together for almost two entire hours, and, as she realized what time it was, Cassandra chuckled.",
      "\"Whoa...",
      "I didn't realize...",
      "I think it's the first time I finally have a long conversation which is only about books.",
      "When I talk about this kind of things with Helen, in the end, she always begins to talk about boys, clothes, or other things...",
      "And I am not even talking about Hercules or Icarus, they mainly don't care about it.",
      "- And I was happy to talk about this with you, Cassandra, Galatea answered, her cheeks red with joy and excitement.",
      "It was a really pleasant talk.\"",
      "Cassandra felt herself blush for a reason she couldn't explain nor understand.",
      "She was not sure she wanted to do so.",
      "(Why did Galatea have to be both beautiful and interesting?) SSSSSSSS The visit of the school was pretty short, since none of the girls really wanted to stay too much far from the library for a too much long time and from their so much interesting conversation, Cassandra promising to Galatea to give to her for some times some of her own books.",
      "As Cassandra showed her what had to be seen in the school and on the campus, they continued talking together, the seer evoking mainly Hercules and his adventures - which were mainly failures, to be honest - as Hades' shenanigans and plots - most of the time stupid things/failures as well - and also her own problems.",
      "She didn't tell her anything about her personal curse or her relational problem with people.",
      "After visiting the place, they went to eat together (Icarus was still not here, as he is not here anymore, and Hercules was still training with Philoctetes), and after that, Galatea decided to go to see her \"moms\", in order to ask them questions.",
      "As Cassandra was continuing reading her book (which was still Aristotle's one), the young woman went to Aphrodite's temple.",
      "It felt strange.",
      "Yes, it felt really strange, to go to a temple to talk to her new \"parents\".",
      "She understood what Hercules might be feeling.",
      "\"Aphrodite?",
      "Athena?",
      "Hum... moms?",
      "She asked with difficulty, still not being used to have a family.\"",
      "Not being used to be alive at all.",
      "Some seconds after, the two goddesses appeared in front of her, both smiling, and maybe it was just Galatea's impression, but it looked like they already knew what she wanted to ask them.",
      "\"Yes, darling?",
      "Aphrodite asked her.",
      "Are you okay?",
      "- Is your first day at school alright?",
      "Athena immediately asked her.",
      "- Oh, yes, of course, I... I'm fine, thanks.",
      "Tonight is the ball organized in your honor mom, so, I guess it will be fun.",
      "Even if I don't know how to dance...",
      "She added.",
      "- Why don't you ask to someone to teach you how to do so?",
      "Why not asking this to Cassandra, for example?",
      "Aphrodite asked her with a not really subtle air of connivance with her adoptive daughter, and it made Athena roll her eyes.",
      "Hell, couldn't her lover be less obvious and predictable?",
      "- Why her specifically?",
      "I could learn it with anyone else!",
      "- Well, you seem to like her more than the others, that is the only reason why I suggested her name.",
      "Aphrodite answered with a false innocent tone.",
      "Am I wrong?",
      "She asked genuinely.",
      "- No!",
      "Well, I mean...",
      "In fact, I don't know what you mean, mom, but this is not what you think...",
      "Whatever you think it is, she continued, embarrassed.\"",
      "Aphrodite, as well as Athena herself, immediately gave her a tender and loving smile.",
      "Oh, she was just so innocent!",
      "\"In fact, that was also the reason why I came here, Galatea then said, regaining suddenly some confidence.",
      "I wanted to know...",
      "Why am I feeling so strange when I am near Cassandra? - What do you mean by strange?",
      "The goddess of wisdom asked her, already knowing what it was and what she meant.\"",
      "Athena knew, as much as Aphrodite did, that Galatea and Cassandra were both each other's soulmate, since Aphrodite had told her what Cupid had revealed to her.",
      "It didn't mean at all that she was going to tell her this, but it didn't mean either that she didn't want to help her knew and adorable daughter.",
      "\"I...",
      "I feel awkward.",
      "Galatea admitted.",
      "Happy but also sad at the same time, as if I was missing something.",
      "I love to look at her, to see her smile, laugh, be happy, in fact, I want to make her feel happy.",
      "When I am far from her, it hurts.",
      "When I saw Icarus being close to her yesterday, it hurt as well.",
      "When she is sad and in a bad mood, I feel bad as well, and I don't know why, she said this in an almost desperate tone.",
      "When she smiles at me or when she laughs, I feel like my heart is jumping into my chest, and I just can't understand why.",
      "- How do you perceive Cassandra exactly?",
      "What do you think of her?",
      "Athena demanded, wanting her adoptive daughter just to find the answer by herself.",
      "- She is brilliant!",
      "She loves books and literature as well as I myself do, and she knows so much things about it!",
      "She is wonderful!",
      "She is funny, sometimes rude and cynical, but I know this is just a facade.",
      "And by the way, it makes her being really amusing.",
      "She is kind, and friendly, and beautiful, and I really like her, and...\" A sudden realization seemed to hit violently the young girl, and she closed her eyes.",
      "She blinked, half-horrified.",
      "\"And I think I am in love with her!",
      "She almost screamed.",
      "How... how did it happen?",
      "I know her since just one day, how can I...",
      "It's too much soon!",
      "- Or so you think, Galatea, Aphrodite told her with an indulgent smile.",
      "Did you ever heard about love at first sight?",
      "Hell, if you think about it, all Hercules crushes in this damn show were just about him seeing a pretty and sometimes not interesting girl (yeah, I am looking at you Electra) and immediately falling in love with her without even knowing her.",
      "- Except with Tempest, of course, Athena corrected her.",
      "She was a good one.",
      "A good character as well as a good love interest.",
      "And she is an Amazon.",
      "And a good fighter.",
      "I really like her.",
      "-",
      "Yeah, I agree with this.",
      "In fact, she is the only one of them the Author really likes to see in a relationship with Hercules.",
      "Galatea, she continued, you know Cassandra maybe better than a lot of people do know her, and in fact, you're just falling in love with her.",
      "That's just the beginning, don't worry.",
      "- What if she doesn't love me?",
      "I mean, I know it can appear to be stupid and like being nothing really important, but... - Hey, kid, Aphrodite told her with a reassuring tone, it's okay...",
      "You're in love.",
      "That's a great and wonderful and beautiful thing.",
      "This is not stupid, because being in love is never something stupid.",
      "- Well, it can make you do stupid things, but... - Athena, please, don't break all my tries!",
      "Do I do that with you?",
      "- You did... - Maybe...",
      "But please, don't do this now!",
      "You're in love, Galatea.",
      "Love is never easy, I know it, before finding the good one, I was successively with Ares and then Hephaestus.",
      "And now, I know I am with the good one, she said, sending a smile of love at Athena, who replied to this one immediately, and the thing is that... you will know when it's the good one.",
      "I promise.",
      "It won't be easy, but trust me, it worth fighting for.\"",
      "Galatea tried to smile, and Aphrodite then decided to take her into her arms.",
      "\"I am still afraid mom, the young woman said, and the goddess felt her heart break.\"",
      "She just hugged he tighter.",
      "SSSSSSSS At the same time.",
      "Hercules, after eating, had decided to continue training with Philoctetes, and he started when he saw an Amazon he knew really well walk into his direction.",
      "\"Hey Tempest!",
      "Hum... Hello!",
      "What are you doing here?",
      "- I wanted to know if I could train with you...",
      "- Oh...",
      "Yes, of course, the apprentice hero answered to her.\"",
      "They trained together for one or two hours, and Hercules finally noticed that Tempest did seem to be preoccupied by something.",
      "\"Tell me Tempest...",
      "Are you okay?",
      "It looks like something is wrong with you.\"",
      "She had a serious air on her face, and she then sighed.",
      "\"Oh, don't worry Hercules, this is nothing really important, but...",
      "This is... embarrassing.",
      "- I am the champion of embarrassing decisions or situations, so trust me, nothing can be more embarrassing than the fact that I created yesterday a woman made of clay because I was a selfish idiot who wanted someone to go to the ball with him.\"",
      "Tempest then frowned.",
      "\"Oh.",
      "You really did it?",
      "I have heard of this, but I didn't know it was you who... indeed, this is also embarrassing.",
      "Hum, as you already know it, I was supposed to go to the ball of this evening with Ajax.",
      "- Indeed, since you didn't accept to go with me, Hercules answered, without any tone of reproach in his voice.",
      "It had been her choice, after all.",
      "- Sure.",
      "But the thing is that, he doesn't want anymore to go to the ball.",
      "He told me it didn't interest him anymore, and I realized as well I didn't really want to go with him.",
      "So, I am sorry to ask this to you this lately, but... would you like to go to the ball with me?",
      "If the answer is no, I understand it.",
      "- To go to the ball... with you?",
      "Oh, Tempest, I would adore to do so!",
      "The apprentice hero answered her with enthusiasm.",
      "But then, his smile immediately faded.",
      "But...",
      "I am supposed to go to the ball with Galatea, and this is not that she is really happy of going to it with me, but I made all of this so I would go with her, and if I let her alone like that, I will really be perceived as someone indelicate.",
      "And if she doesn't find someone else... he added, beginning to completely panic.",
      "- Hercules, calm yourself.",
      "Just ask her if she is okay with this, and if she is, just tell me you will go with me to the ball.",
      "I see you later, she added, before kissing the young hero on the cheek.\"",
      "And then, she left, leaving Hercules almost petrified.",
      "This one smiled beatifically, before sighing.",
      "He just hoped that Galatea would accept this change of last minute... SSSSSSSS The girl made of clay crossed her arms on her chest, then she raised an eyebrow, before smiling ironically.",
      "\"You must be fucking kidding me!",
      "She exclaimed, not believing what she had just heard.\"",
      "She was both amused and angry, but she tried to show herself as being furious, in order to frighten the future hero with her attitude.",
      "After all, he had made all these absurd things for this stupid ball, and now, he was announcing her that he wanted to go to it with someone else?",
      "What the fuck was that?",
      "It was not that she wanted that much to go and dance with him (not at all...",
      "Really not), but he could have said it before!",
      "He had now a contrite air on his face.",
      "\"Galatea, I am really sorry...",
      "Especially after the way I behaved with you...",
      "- Oh, but you can be!",
      "You ask Aphrodite to create me and now, you tell me you want to go to the ball with someone else?",
      "I am so shocked, Hercules!",
      "She said with a false anger.\"",
      "Some seconds later, seeing how sorry and contrite he was, she unexpectedly burst into laughter.",
      "He looked at her with surprise.",
      "\"Oh, Hercules, I am joking!",
      "Of course you can go to the ball with Tempest if you want to!",
      "I am not going to be the one who will forbid you to do so...",
      "In fact, it may be a good thing for me.",
      "- Why?",
      "Is there already someone you want to go to the ball with?",
      "- Yes...",
      "I would like to ask to Cassandra to come with me.",
      "- Cass... Cassandra? - Do you think she will say yes?\"",
      "He chuckled.",
      "\"I think she will say yes to anyone who is not Icarus.\"",
      "Galatea tried to smile, not really reassured.",
      "At least, she could try.",
      "SSSSSSSS \"Cassandra...",
      "Would you accept to go to the ball with me?",
      "As a friend, of course.\"",
      "Surprised of being asked by someone else than Icarus, and ready to understand more her feelings toward Galatea, the young seer accepted.",
      "Oh, and of course, before the ball, they would have to learn how to dance.",
      "Detail...",
      "To be continued...",
      "Galatea had invited her to Aphrodite's ball.",
      "And her, Cassandra, the seer, she had said yes.",
      "Why exactly?",
      "Silently, pensive, she replayed the conversation she had with the other girl in her head.",
      "She was still reading Aristotle's book when Galatea had came to see her, and Cassandra looked at her with curiosity.",
      "At her surprise, Galatea was harboring an air of uncertainty on her face.",
      "\"Hum, tell me, Cassandra...",
      "Would you accept to go to the ball with me?",
      "As a friend, of course, she had immediately added.\"",
      "I t had nothing to do with everything else she had already received in the past, mainly from Icarus.",
      "And unlike everything coming from him, it was something pleasant.",
      "S o, she had no dance partner for tonight, she didn't want to go with Icarus, Galatea was pretty and she liked her.",
      "I t was not like Cassandra was confronted to a great dilemma...",
      "\"Yes, of course I will come with you!",
      "It might be fun, after all.\"",
      "And by the way, they would not be forced to dance, right?",
      "(Error.)",
      "SSSSSSSS It was 4 PM when Cassandra and Galatea both learned what they were supposed to do (just as all the other students of the Promethean school) before the beginning of the ball, and the seer immediately got pale.",
      "They were supposed, according to their new dance teacher (the one who appears in the episode \"Hercules and the Muse of Dance\" for those who don't remember who she is), to learn how to dance, because, after all, they were going to a ball, so it was an elementary thing, right?",
      "To know how to dance.",
      "Cassandra understood the idea, but it didn't mean she liked it, it didn't mean she accepted it.",
      "She would have to dance with Galatea.",
      "For real.",
      "Oh no, no, NO!",
      "She hadn't signed for it!",
      "She had accepted to go the ball with her friend because Hercules finally had the possibility to go with Tempest, that is to say the one with who he really wanted to go, and because she liked Galatea enough to want to spend an entire evening with her.",
      "Itwas not either that she didn't like to dance, it was not that she didn't want to dance with Galatea, but...",
      "She was afraid.",
      "As it was said before, she didn't really like to be with people, except those she knew, as Hercules and Icarus (even if she didn't really have the choice with this one), her parents or Galatea, recently.",
      "So, yes, to accept to go to this ball showed how much she cared about Galatea, but it didn't mean she could accept to dance with her in front of everyone!",
      "She thought that she would just be with her, talk with her and see the other people dance and enjoy herself by staying away from the other people (except Galatea, Hercules, Helen or Tempest) as much as she could.",
      "And according to Galatea's look, she seemed to be as embarrassed as she was.",
      "The teacher rolled her eyes, clearly annoyed, as she noticed her students' reticence.",
      "\"Oh, come on!",
      "This is a ball!",

      "- She is completely crazy, Cassandra muttered to Galatea, who couldn't help but chuckle.\"",
      "She just hoped that she hadn't done it too much loud.",
      "The teacher looked at them and smiled, before inviting all of them to go on the dance floor.",
      "Ok, so...",
      "It was not a joke.",
      "Cassandra took a deep breath, trying not to panic.",
      "She was supposed to dance with a beautiful girl that she liked a lot even if she had met her just the day before, and that she might have a crush on, and this, in front of everyone.",
      "It was going to be okay...",
      "It just had to be okay.",
      "SSSSSSSS Galatea felt like she was in Paradise.",
      "Even if the suggestion had felt weird at first for her (and she was not the only one who thought that), she internally thanked the teacher for her idea.",
      "Because it was just perfect.",
      "Not because it was forcing Cassandra to dance with her (that would have been a thought coming rather from Icarus, if he had the chance to dance with the young woman), but because it was giving her the opportunity and the possibility to know if yes or no this one liked her.",
      "There is a thing which has to be clear for everyone.",
      "The woman made of clay was... young.",

      "She had the spirit of a teenager but not all the knowledge these one could have.)",
      "One of them being the fact that she didn't know at all how to flirt.",
      "So, yes, she had no idea of how express her feelings for Cassandra or how to show her that she liked her, more than just a simple friend.",
      "The only examples she had were Aphrodite and Athena (but they were already in a relationship, so it was not the same thing), Hercules and Tempest (but the thing is that he was not really better than her at this \"game\"), and Icarus and...",
      "no, with Cassandra, and he was clearly not a role model in any way.",
      "So yes, the thing is that this dance would be a good occasion.",
      "Well, only if Galatea could herself get rid off her damn shyness...",
      "Just to say that it was not going to be easy.",
      "She was feeling good in a really strange way, as the two women were dancing together, and were trying to learn really rapidly (as all the other one) movements which should have taken much more time to be learned in a realistic universe.",
      "(But since when is this universe in any way realistic?",
      "Ha, ha...)",
      "Some hours passed, and at 7 PM, they all ate, prepared themselves for the ball, and one hour later, the ball itself began.",
      "SSSSSSSS The situation was still strange for the two of them.",
      "The awkwardness of the situation had made silence fall between the two girls, who didn't know at first what to tell to the other, being both too much absorbed in their own thoughts, reflections, and fears.",
      "Until Galatea finally tried to force herself to break the uncomfortable feeling that had appeared between them.",
      "She looked at Hercules and Tempest, dancing together gracelessly (since for this time, Hercules was not that... clumsy, unlike how he usually was, since the Author decided this was not funny or dramatic or interesting in any way), and Galatea pointed the couple to Cassandra.",
      "\"They really seem to fit well together, she remarked, wanting to say something, anything so the awkwardness wouldn't be here anymore, because she didn't want things to be different between them, just because they were dancing.\"",

      "\"I agree...",

      "Apart you, of course.\"",
      "She didn't miss Galatea's sudden blush, but she misunderstood it, thinking it was maybe a reminiscence of her past and brief attraction toward Hercules (after all, she was supposed to be in love with him at first, right?",

      "I mean, he is my friend, and I will never be attracted to him as well, but...",
      "I can understand why someone like you or Tempest, or anyone else could be.",
      "He is kind, brave, heroic (most of the time...), not stupid (again, most of the time, when the writers don't want him to make stupid things), cute, strong...",
      "Is it because he is not your type?",
      "If the answer is yes, I hope your type is not Adonis, she added with a fake and forced laugh, feeling the terrible pain of jealousy invading her at this simple thought.\"",
      "Please, do not let him be...",
      "She begged, internally.",
      "She knew it was absurd, but the thing is that she was afraid.",
      "Galatea just grinned.",
      "\"No, not at all...",
      "And tell me, Cassandra...",
      "What about you?",
      "- What?",
      "What do you mean?",
      "What does it have to do with me?\" Cassandra immediately blushed, already knowing what her friend meant.",
      "But she didn't want at all to answer to this personal question by: oh, I am attracted to women, and what about you, and by the way, do you want to date me?",
      "And I want to kiss you, and I know I shouldn't, but I can't help but want this, and oh this is not normal since I just met you yesterday, am I falling in love with you?",
      "Yes, this was not really the better answer to give to someone you just met... Panic began to invade completely, and she took a deep breath.",
      "Hell, did she was afraid.",
      "She felt like she was becoming crazy.",
      "Galatea gave her a tender smile, and Cassandra felt her beat too much fast and too much loud, like it wanted to escape from her chest.",
      "Oh, by the gods, why did Galatea make her feel all these things?",
      "And why did she like this a lot?",
      "\"Well, after all, since I was created, almost everyone I talked with just talked about my love life, probable, real, non-existent...",
      "Whatever...",
      "In fact, I was created because a young apprentice hero wanted to finally have a love life!",
      "My entire life was build at first around love!",
      "So yes, what about your own love life?",
      "I am interested by this one, why couldn't I know you better by knowing about you things you already know about me?\"",
      "It was not a really subtle way to gain information about it, but it was the only way that Galatea had found which was not scarring like: tell me if you're dating someone or not and who you're attracted by!",
      "Yes, she would have sounded too much crazy, and she didn't want to.",
      "She didn't know everything about human relationships, but she knew it was something people usually did.",
      "\"I don't know a lot of things about you in this matter, Cassandra answered, trying to desperately avoid the conversation, without showing that she didn't want to talk about it.\"",
      "She didn't want Galatea to think that she had problems with that kind of things, even if it was the case, because she didn't want the other girl to look at her differently.",
      "Galatea shrugged.",
      "\"You know that I am not interested by Hercules, or Adonis...",
      "Or by any of the boys in the school, for what it matters, if you want to know it...",
      "She added carefully, looking at Cassandra's expression, in order to know if it annoyed her or not.",
      "Cassandra blinked.",
      "\"You...",
      "You're only attracted toward women?",
      "She asked, surprised, not expecting it.",
      "She was surprised, but not horrified, clearly, so Galatea's breath became calmer.",
      "- Yes, Galatea said, much more assured than before.",
      "Yes, I am.\"",
      "Her friend smiled.",
      "\"I... I didn't know... I...\" She didn't know what to say.",
      "She just bloody didn't know what to tell her.",

      "Ok, that's cool for you and I don't care?",
      "Personal?",
      "And so do I...",
      "Yes, this one was good.",
      "\"And so do I, she finally said, confessing to her friend and crush one of her biggest secrets.\"",
      "Galatea started to her sentence, and looked at her with amazement.",
      "And at this precise moment, something just clicked into her head, and she finally understood.",
      "Understood that this was not by chance if Cassandra looked at her this way, understood that she may be not the only one who was going to fall in love with someone she had just met.",
      "She saw Cassandra's look on her and she immediately understood what she hadn't realized before.",
      "The seer just felt the same way as her...",
      "Something exploded in her heart, joy, happiness, something like euphoria was crossing through her veins, and a smile came on her face as she understood that she was not alone.",
      "Still dancing with Cassandra, still silent, still looking at her like she was the most precious and most beautiful thing and person of the world, she stopped the dance.",
      "The seer looked at her with incomprehension, being a little frightened by Galatea's silence.",
      "But she was smiling at her, so, it was certainly not something really serious, right?",
      "SSSSSSSS Galatea didn't care if someone was looking at them or not.",
      "They had been dancing and talking for the previous hour, and she had just realized that Cassandra was interested by her, and all she wanted to do now, was to take her in her arms, and kiss her, and... do things to her she didn't want to think about in public nor do in public, things she didn't know before that she wanted to do.",
      "But again, she was born one day ago, so...",
      "Suddenly, she took Cassandra's face in her hands, gently, letting her time to escape from her grip or to reject her.",
      "Cassandra froze.",
      "She knew what was going to happen, and it scared her.",
      "A lot.",
      "It had been since a long time that she didn't feel like she was falling in love, and these times were more crushes which didn't mean anything than real love interest.",
      "But Galatea...",
      "She did matter for her.",
      "She was afraid of losing her, if it didn't end well.",
      "But Galatea was here, smiling at her in a reassuring way, and when she finally kissed her, the seer tried to put the fear away from her.",
      "As she kissed Cassandra, Galatea finally felt like she was really happy, like she was at her place, like things were as they should be.",
      "She was feeling complete.",
      "Behind a pillar of the room, Athena and Aphrodite both let a silent scream of victory escape from their lips.",
      "To be continued...",
      "During the night of the ball.",

      "At Hades' place.",
      "Hades was not happy.",
      "Well, you may ask me in which way it changes him from the way he is most of the time, but you just have to know that he was really angry.",
      "And ready to do something really evil.",
      "(As... usual.",
      "Originality!)",
      "Well, to be clearer, Hades was... upset.",
      "Yes, it's true, he was just terribly and completely upset.",
      "For which reason?",
      "But just because he still had no important role in this story, of course!",
      "(Yes, that's pretty stupid, but a lot of decisions made by Hades in the show were really stupid as well...",
      "So, it really doesn't matter.",

      "He was the villain, he was supposed to be present, right?",
      "Not just to be... mentioned like that, rapidly, he was supposed to play a role, to be important.",

      "It was way too long!)",

      "For being stuck into the Underworld and not being the king of the Olympus?",
      "Hum... yes, that's one of the other reasons of his bad mood but... that's not the subject!",
      "Not for now, at least.",
      "No, that was because some of the other gods had been evoked before him, and he wasn't!",
      "That was unfair!",
      "It was a true scandal!",
      "(There are too much exclamation points in this chapter...) Zeus and Hera had been there, because of their link to Hercules (a true mythological inaccuracy, by the way...), Aphrodite and Athena were omnipresent (too much present, according to him), hell, even Cupid had been evoked and he hadn't been before this chapter.",

      "They are well guarded, after all, aren't they?",
      "(In the show, they wouldn't have been.",

      "It's not.",
      "Really, really not.",
      "I hate the show's humor, and I hate what the writers made or wrote.",

      "- Except if he replaces them by copies of them, so no one will notice they are gone, Galatea suddenly understood, immediately getting pale.\"",
      "All of them looked at her with surprise, not understanding what she meant, and they all started when she used her powers and turned her hairs into snakes looking like the one Medusa had on her head.",
      "Then, she turned herself into a copy of Aphrodite, almost looking like a sister of the goddess, making it really difficult to know which one was the real one, had Aphrodite been here next to her at this moment.",
      "Galatea sighed.",
      "\"I am made of clay and I was born of two goddesses, born thanks to their magic and with my power, I can fake almost everything, and I am just a mortal.",
      "Can you imagine what Hades, a god, can do with his powers?",
      "He is not stupid, not anymore, he wants to win, he will need as much allies as possible, and he needs to make a surprise attack.",
      "- Oh, Hercules asked her, you mean like the surprise attack that Miltiades made and which helped him and the other win the battle of Marathon?\"",
      "A great voice then came out from nowhere, responding immediately to the young man's question, as a sentence made of flames (again, sense of measure, all these things...) wrote itself on a wall in front of them.",

      "So, I guess we have just a little time to act.",
      "- Indeed, the seer answered with a serious air.",
      "The battle must have just begun, I think.",
      "- So, Galatea continued, we have to go to the Olympus, and save the gods from their fate.",
      "Save our family, she said, looking at Hercules, since they both had divine parents on Mount Olympus.\"",
      "He nodded, and they both went to the Mount Olympus, decided to defeat Hades and all his allies.",

      "To say that they were easily beaten would certainly be a euphemism.",
      "They were defeated really easily, and even Hades thought that it was, in fact, almost too easy.",
      "But the reason why they were loosing was quite easy to understand.",
      "They weren't prepared, and Hades had not only the Titans with him, but also a lot of other allies.",
      "The other thing none of them was expecting too, is that they would get some help, in the end.",

    "text": "The Trojans call him son of Priam, but Achilles knows better than that. The fact is, divinity knows divinity; what is divine within Achilles recognises it in any others of the same persuasion that he might meet. He knew it in Heracles, once upon a time at Chiron's table, and he knows it in Sarpedon of Lycia, who is set to fight against Greece with the Trojans. He knows it in the youth standing before him, too. What the Achaeans whisper about him is true: Troilus is Hecuba's, yes, but not by the king of Troy. He is Apollo's son. Achilles can feel it. Of course, where Apollo's children are concerned, that moment of instinctive, bodily recognition is not something he requires. Children of Zeus feel powerful, as if lit up from within with a spark of their father's lightning bolt. Children of Ares feel strong, as if filled up with their father's thirst for war. Children of Apollo, on the other hand, are almost uniformly radiant; they are beautiful, which necessitates no special skill in its perception. But it is, perhaps, because Achilles can both see and feel Apollo's radiance within Troilus, Prince of Troy, that desire cuts him as keenly as it does. Outside, by the fountain, he reached up one hand and tore Troilus down from the back of his horse. Troilus fled into the nearby temple, a distraction so that his sister might escape, and despite his knowing this, Achilles followed him inside. Perhaps one day he will concern himself with Polyxena but she is entirely earthly and, as such, she does not tempt him as her brother does. Neither is she the reason he has come. She is not the reason he was sent. They stand now at the darkened altar in the braziers' hot, unsteady light. There could be no escape but through him, and though Troilus is not small, and Troilus does not cower, he is not Achilles's match. \"You know who I am,\" says Troilus. \"Yes,\" replies Achilles, though he understands the words were not a question to be answered. \"You know who I am within myself. As Helen does.\" Achilles met Helen once, not so very long ago. Beautiful Helen, prized Helen, pretext for Agamemnon's fucking war that Achilles is not sure he wants to play a part in. She is a daughter of Zeus and he knew it in the very first instant that they stepped into each other's presence; her sister is a daughter of Tyndareus, and he knew that in a much more mundane way. After all, Castor and Clytemnestra are to their twins what night is to day: paler, and colder, and wanting for dawn's divine light. \"Yes,\" Achilles says. \"I know that.\" \"You mean to kill me.\" \"Yes.\" \"In this place?\" \"Yes.\" \"But you know who...\" Achilles raises his brows and quickly, Troilus understands. Achilles can see the realisation of it in the expression settling on his face and in the stiffening in his body. \"You mean to kill me because you know,\" says Troilus. Achilles nods curtly. He has yet to draw his sword, but he will do so, inevitably, inexorably, and Troilus clearly knows this. Troilus does not say my father will be angry, because it is clear Achilles knows this. He does not say please spare me, because he knows Achilles won't. As he draws himself up tall and taut and very brave, what he says is, \"Do it quickly,\" but Achilles cannot promise this. He would like to say he wishes that he could, but that would be a lie. He is many things, but he is not a liar. What is divine within Achilles recognises what is divine in Troilus, and he wonders. He wants to know how Troilus's skin might taste against his lips, drenched as it has been by Trojan sun. He wants to know how his blood might taste against his tongue, infused as it is with Apollo's light. He grits his teeth. He clenches his jaw. He clutches tight at the hilt of his sword that hangs there ready at his waist. Achilles is not known for his steadiness, for his moderation, or his control. He does not expect to keep any of these things for long. \"Will you do what I tell you to?\" Achilles asks. It sounds much like a response Troilus's request for his celerity, as if a prerequisite for Achilles's compliance, and though it's not he does not clarify. He tells himself that's not a kind of lie within itself. \"What do you want?\" Troilus asks. He sounds careful. He sounds wary, for which Achilles cannot blame him. \"Take off your clothes, prince,\" Achilles replies. He sees no reason to elaborate. It gets the point across. Troilus understands. He does not look pleased, but he understands, and after a moment's quiet consideration - Achilles could not call it hesitation as it seems to him to be quite measured and deliberate - he unties the belt from about his waist and drops it to the temple floor. His short chiton hangs more loosely then against his skin, still creased above his hips where his belt cinched it in, and he reaches deft fingers to the pins that hold it at his shoulders. He drops the pins, too, deliberately, with a clatter of gold on stone, then he lets the tunic fall. He is naked beneath and in his veins, Achilles's blood burns with all the fire into which his mother dipped him. He thinks sometimes he took in the flames just as much as he did the ambrosia. His skin bared in the firelight there in the temple of Apollo Thymbraios, at the altar by the feet of his divine father's towering statue, Troilus could almost be a god himself. He is as exquisite in his composition as if he were a statue hewn from living flesh in place of marble, from his elegant neck to his muscled arms, from the bow of his lips to the thick length of his manhood. He is radiant perfection. And, in that moment, Achilles finds that he both adores him and despises him. He is not sure which it is takes precedence. He steps forward. He takes Troilus's bare shoulders in his hands and feels him flinch at his touch, but that does not deter him. He runs his palms and his fingertips down Troilus's long arms. His fingers encircle Troilus's wrists. His grip tightens. The Trojan prince is perhaps just half Achilles's age, a beautiful ephebe not yet twenty years old, and Achilles is no great giant of a man, not like Ajax who seems to dwarf both the Trojan and Achaean armies to a man, so it should be no surprise that they stand eye to eye, equal in at least that one way. That small parity makes it all the easier for Achilles to press his mouth to Troilus's. It makes it all the easier for him to slip the fingers of one hand into Troilus's curling hair and kiss him, softly, as if he does so for no other reason but affection. And Troilus, perhaps because he thinks that it will spare his life, perhaps because he believes in what Achilles has allowed him to misapprehend of their situation, lifts his one free hand to rest cautiously at Achilles's waist. He returns the kiss. Achilles is unsure if he wishes him to pretend he's willing or if that ruins it entirely. He knows what the gods would do, were they in his place. He knows what Zeus would do; Achilles is not the son of Zeus, but he might have been. Zeus wanted Achilles's mother, but the prophecy said that any son of Thetis would be greater than his father and so he left the having of her to Peleus. Achilles might have been born a god, but he was not. He was born mortal, just as so many are, but he is different because of what his mother did to him. Achilles is the man he is because he's not a man the way that others are. Almost all of that was burned away. But, here and now, it seems he is his father's son: Peleus wanted Thetis, so he took her, very much against her will though very much with Zeus's; Achilles wants Troilus, so he takes him, too. He extricates himself from Troilus's embrace and he takes off what he's wearing. He was sent to Thymbra to kill a prince and so accordingly he wore his armour; Troilus watches as he removes his breastplate and vambraces, then his greaves. He removes the tunic underneath, removes his sandals and steps barefoot onto the cold stone floor. Troilus watches as he strokes himself to hardness. Troilus, whether bravely or naively, does the same in front of him. He bends him over the altar, dashing flowers and cups and bowls of offerings this way and that to make the space they need. He presses Troilus down with one palm firm between his shoulder blades. One of the bowls he's spilled was filled with olive oil and so he dips his fingers into what remains of it, then rubs them between Troilus's cheeks, against the hole he finds there. \"Are you a virgin, prince?\" he asks, his voice almost a rasp as his fingertips tease. \"Has any other man had you?\" Troilus shakes his head, which is his answer. His fingers grip the altar. Achilles believes that's the truth of it; he'll be the first man and the last that Troilus ever knows. He slicks himself with the same part-spilled oil, from base to tip, till he's dripping with it, and Troilus turns his head and cranes his neck to look as if he cannot help but do so. Because he knows that Troilus's eyes are on him, he strokes himself slowly. Because he knows Troilus is watching, he lifts his cock just a little so that he can see the oil drip down over his balls and catch against his thighs, the whole arrangement glistening in the firelight. Troilus blushes but he does not turn away, not until Achilles's hands move from himself and back to him instead. He parts Troilus's cheeks with both his palms. He directs the tip of his phallus to slip between them, the slick length of him rubbing over his hole. When he pushes inside him, Troilus moans and grips more tightly at Apollo's altar till his fingers are almost uniformly white. His body is hot, a tight sheath for Achilles's cock as he seats himself inside him right down to the base. When Achilles moves in him, gripping at his hips with hands slippery with oil, Troilus pushes back against him though he curses softly against the stone. \"You were made for this moment, Prince of Troy,\" Achilles says, with a catch in his voice as he flexes his hips to fuck him. He rakes his blunt nails over Troilus's perfect back, either side of his spine, raising livid red stripes in their wake. He rubs the first two fingers of his right hand between Troilus's cheeks, one either side of his own throbbing erection, to trace the rim of his tight hole. \"Don't you think Apollo made you for the length of my cock? Don't you think you fit me well?\" \"Yes,\" Troilus replies, with one cheek pressed tight against the altar. \"Yes,\" Troilus sobs, with one hand wrapped around his own erection. He comes with a gasp and a strangled sound that's almost as if Achilles had wrapped his hands around his throat, and he spends himself against the polished stone of Apollo's altar. Achilles believes he believes it, at least right here and now. The sum of Troilus's existence is, within that moment, length and girth of Achilles's cock inside him, and so he pulls out of him abruptly. He pushes him down to his knees on the floor there at Apollo's feet and he follows him down to his own knees, then pushes in again before he can shudder for the lack of him. He comes inside him moments later, teeth gritted, groaning, looking up into Apollo's stony face. A kind of warm triumph floods his veins and he wraps his arms around Troilus's slim waist. He kisses the crook of Troilus's long neck. Kneeling there, softening though still pushed deep inside him, Troilus's bare back rests against Achilles's broad chest. They breathe almost in unison. Achilles would like to take Troilus with him when he leaves the temple. He would bind his wrists and lash him to his chariot if that proved necessary, but he does not think it would; he believes Troilus would go with him of his own accord and lie with him in his tent on the beach where the Achaeans have made camp. Perhaps they would bathe together in the sea and later, once Apollo's Trojan sun had dried them, Achilles might lick the salt away from Troilus's tanned skin. He imagines pressing his mouth to Troilus's wrists, to his hips, to his temples by his dampened hairline, or the creases where his thighs merge with his body. He imagines the taste of his skin, of his cock, of his come, and sighs against his neck. Achilles would like to take him with him when he leaves, but he knows he can't. The prophecy says if Troilus dies before he's twenty, the Achaeans will succeed. Troilus was made for two things, and only two: for Achilles's cock, and for the fall of Troy. Achilles knows neither of them will live to see the latter because for all that is divine in them, for all his mother's burnings and anointings, they both remain mortal. Fuck the gods, he thinks, that gave them this strange life placed halfway between the two. Fuck Apollo, who gave the world this boy that Achilles has to take from it. He pulls back. He pulls out. He stands. They both shiver. He draws his sword and puts the tip to the base of Troilus's perfect neck; Troilus bows his head almost as if he understands that this must happen, because the gods have willed it even if the two of them do not. Achilles washes Apollo's marble feet with the blood of his beautiful son and he leaves the body there before him. It's not the kind of sacrifice a god expects, but in the end, he does at least make it quick. This will not be the only death before the war is done, and will not be the only one at Achilles's hands, but it's one he will remember. And then, when it's done, he simply walks away.",

    "text": "Working in Hadestown, each day life is the same. It all blends together, working for hours in the factories, laying down, closing her eyes, opening them and going back to work. One day, she finally just lays down and doesn't get up. She lays in her bed (a slab that pushes the line of uncomfortable and unbearable). She figures that this is really death coming for her, the true end of Eurydice. \"The foreman told me you didn't show up today. He seemed confused like he wasn't even aware that was an option.\" She groans but refuses to open her eyes. It's him. She wonders if he's here to drag her to the assembly line, if he's going to kill her himself. \"You're not done yet, get up.\" \"Go fuck yourself.\" She says into her bed and he chuckles. \"Up, girl.\" He tells her and she feels his hand on her arm and it's the only warning she gets before she's on the hard ground. She looks at the shiny black shoes, looks up sees his sharp eyes, no glasses, interesting. \"You're not even broken.\" And the way he says it like he's surprised makes her angry. \"What are you doing here, Hades?\" She asks, and her voice sounds so tired. \"Looking in on my songbird.\" And she feels like she's been shot when he says it and her glare is hot. \"Don't call me that.\" He looks down on her, seemingly unbothered. \"Why? Does it remind you of him?\" And she can't hold his gaze, not when he brings him up, Orpheus. \"Do I remind you of her?\" She's not sure why she says it and she can feel the displeasure that rolls off of him. \"Get up, Eurydice, you have work to do.\" And maybe in another life, it might have been pity, this one is just indifferent and dangerous (she hasn't been scared of him in a long time) \"I'm not going back to the factory.\" Something like rebellion in her throat as she stands up. \"I'm done, Hades.\" And he laughs, bitter and mean. \"Do you think you're the first to say that? Do you think you'll be the last??\" And he grabbing her shirt in a tight grip, forcing her to stand on her toes. \"We made a deal, my dear little songbird. And all your choices are gone since your little lover boy failed.\" And he is taunting her, and she is angry (she hasn't felt anything in a long time) \"You made me a promise, Hades.\" That hungry Eurydice was killed when she came down here, the slim hope she had snuffed out in the assembly line. And he chuckles letting her go, she falls to her knees. \"I lied.\" He says simply. He turns to leave. \"I'll give you 15 minutes to get to the factory or I'll have the dogs drag you there by your hair.\" \"Hades,\" She starts and he looks back at her (something like sadness in his eyes). \"We had a deal, Mrs. Eurydice, I'm holding you to it.\" And is he a broken record? She reaches out. \"Then rework my contract! Let me make a deal for my myself! Help me as you promised, I'll do anything.\" And she is saying anything, saying anything to stay out of the factories, saying anything to keep the anger in her chest. \"I'll even be her.\" And it said in a whisper and he freezes in the doorway. \"You can't be her, no one can.\" And his voice sounds empty. \"15 minutes, Eurydice.\" \"I want to be free Hades!\" She says her voice shaking and loud in the barren room. \"You are.\" He tells her and the taunting voices of the Fates ring in her head and by the time she thinks of responding he's gone. There are no dogs, no one drags her to the factory and she walks around Hadestown, her hands in her pocket. The heat is stifling, she keeps her head down as people walk back and forth from work on the wall, the factory, and the mines. No one stops her, no one speaks to her. She's just one face in the crowd. She passed the empty warehouse where the Lady Persephone would have her bar, wistfully thinking about the taste of sunlight. She just keeps wandering passing empty buildings, and empty souls. She trips over a crack in the ground and on bended knee, she finds it, there is a small trail of grass, she follows it, to find flowers are growing on the iron gate that separates it from the rest of the Underground. It's a garden! And she feels like crying (she has not shed tears in years). Entering it feels like she moving across scared land. There is a small tree in the middle, holding red fruit and she moves towards it almost magnetically. \"I wouldn't do that if I were you.\" Hades stands off by himself and even with his glasses on she can feel herself being watched. \"You're not in the factory.\" He notes. \"You didn't call the dogs on me.\" She tells him and he inclines his head, and she can see his eyes, she feels like she's being evaluated. \"I lied.\" He motions her towards him with his hand and she moves away from the tree. \"On our wedding night,\" He starts and she is struck by how ancient he is, and how sad he is. \"Persephone ate six seeds before she got too distracted and then she dropped it, wasting it.\" He seems almost like he's yearning to be back then, she knows the look on his face, recognizes it in the mirror when she thinks of Orpheus. \"That was back before the factory before we had much, and I remember being angry seeing the wasted fruit and she laughed at me.\" And she understands, can remember watching Orpheus sing to the heavens instead of collecting firewood, can remember her pleading with him to be more careful with the fruit she had (it was supposed to be for the darkest days, it never lasted). \"I miss her.\" \"I miss him.\" She admits. They look at each other before Hades looks away. \"How long till she comes back?\" She asks. \"Two months, six days.\" He says and she sighs biting her lips. Hades looks at her, appraising her. \"I can't let you go back up.\" She doesn't ask for his reasoning, she knows he is a king, and every move he makes alters the very reality she sits in. There wasn't even hope in her heart for that she realizes. She's just so tired. She reminds herself of his words to her a long time ago. \"I shouldn't even be entertaining this.\" He reaches into his pocket and pulls out a paper. \"I'm a busy man.\" He says and she remembers meeting him in the forest so long ago. \"But I need an assistant.\" She can feel her eyes widen, he can't honestly be. \"No factory, no wall, no mine?\" He nods solemnly. \"Why?\" And he turns away from her and she's worried that by asking him she's ruined it, he'll call it off. \"I've thought of you since your boy left. There is something different about you.\" \"No there isn't.\" She says, Hades lured everyone here the same way, it hasn't changed, she won't be played twice. \"You remind me of,\" She's ready for him to say Persephone, ready for him to compare her to Spring herself but he pauses. \"You remind me of me.\" And her eyes find his when he looks at her. \"And you're not broken, you should be, so I'll get some use out of you, yet.\" \"I'll have to look at my contract.\" She says quietly. He offers his arm to hers. \"I would expect nothing less.\" She laces her arm in his and together they leave the garden. Maybe the myths were wrong, maybe Hades is more merciful in the summer. \"Hades, Why is it so hot down here!\" Hades looks at Eurydice, an amused look in his eyes. \"The Missus is back.\" He says to Eurydice like he's sharing a secret. \"Hades!\" Persephone stalks in, she still is dressed for the summers, flowers seem to burst off her brown skin, she is so beautiful. A light where Hades is darkness. And the goddess stops seeing Eurydice. \"This is new.\" And Hades is moving to his wife before she can move, and Eurydice wants to look away, as he whispers to Persephone. \"The songbird, Orpheus's girl, your assistant?\" And hearing every title she's ever had come out the Goddess's mouth makes Eurydice want to curl in herself but they're both watching her with old eyes so she stands straighter and nods to the lady. \"He's not working you too hard, is he?\" And her voice sounds almost sweet but she remembers, the biting bitterness, the anger, the true lady of the Underground. \"No, ma'am.\" She says inclining her head, refusing (terrified) to move. Hades is different without Persephone (harder, more nostalgic) now that she's here, Eurydice doesn't know what to expect. \"I'm glad you're here, songbird. I have something for you from up top. And the gentle red bloom that she presses into the girl's hand brings immediate tears into Eurydice's eyes. \"He hasn't given up.\" The Goddess whispers into her ear. \"I'm glad you haven't either.\" She laughs loudly, spinning to grab Hades's arm. \"Come, husband, back to work, little songbird.\" She sings, Hades flashes her a quick questioning look before he is pulled with Persephone and the door shuts quietly behind them. She breathes out. Her office is dark. She is working on massive amounts of paperwork that Hades put in front of her before leaving her alone, she is sure that was hours ago(time passes so strangely here). She hasn't seen the light in days, she only knows she's eaten because Persephone had made her take a plate. \"You'll need your strength.\" the Queen had whispered. She had smiled and patted Eurydice's cheek. She knows that the gods found her and Orpheus cute (not worth their time but cute) She's surprised when the door opens. \"Sir,\". She starts, she's not done with her work, she needs more time. If she is not profitable, he will throw her to the mines, he has little patience for error. \"Eurydice,\". Her heart shatters and repairs itself. If he's here that means, \"Orpheus,\"",

    "text": "Genesis is the Pygmalion figure: a flamboyant and arrogant sculptor, who is standoffish towards others, and while he has a fan following, snootily turns them all down, so of course, the Goddess curses him for his arrogance, by making him fall in love with own of his own creations: a beautiful sculpture of silvery-white marble, that he named after an ancient mythological figure: Sephiroth. At first, he is merely proud of it, smug, even, for who else could create such beauty, other than he? Then he gradually becomes fixated on it. It begins with an obsession with displaying and lighting it just so, spending increasing time admiring it... then graduates to urges to caress it, even nuzzle against its cold stone surface. He spends more and more time with it, and gradually finds himself dissatisfied with his other pieces. Then very dissatisfied. It results in the abandonment of all other projects, because he suddenly feels that nothing else he has ever done nor anything he could ever do again will compare to the beauty of his Sephiroth. He starts to experience strange feelings of jealousy when others look upon it. Then paranoia, an increasingly potent fear that they will steal his Greatest Creation; he hides it away, in a room that only he will allow access to. Eventually, he finds that he cannot stand to be away from it for more than a few minutes at a time. Begins to eat and drink and even sleep next to it, for he cannot escape the longing for that face, even in his dreams. He rejects the contact of others -- the few others who would talk to him by this point, at least -- preferring to talk to Sephiroth instead. But no matter how much he may talk to it, it can never reply. Because of course, it is merely stone, nothing more than a very beautiful hunk of marble. Having by this point shunned all others in favor of his prized creation, it merely compounds his loneliness. He is not quite so mad that he doesn't recognize how mad this is, however. How unhealthy, how irrational. He has all but stopped eating. He barely sleeps, and finds that the only way he can is by literally being at the statue's base. His hydration comes mostly from wine, now, yet no amount of drunkenness can distract him from the maddening thing of beauty in front of him. He grows angry at himself -- for his obsession, for his madness. And at the statue itself -- for being so entrancing, and yet so thoroughly unreachable, no matter how many times he talks to or touches it, no matter how many hours he spends at its feet. He can love no other thing, he knows -- not now that this accursed thing has captured his heart and his mind and his soul so perfectly. He is trapped by it, cannot escape it, can think of nothing else, and the fact that it is literally of his own making is an infuriating irony that does not go unnoticed by him. After several days of the obsession having reacted its peak, after days of barely sleeping, feverish and half-starved and slightly drunk again, he has what feels like a moment of clarity: This is an object. It is an object, which can never return his affections. Never. It is nothing but finely-carved marble, nothing more than cold, impassive stone. It cannot love him. It can never love anyone. It never could. It never will. Yet he has allowed it to destroy his life, to destroy him. And for a moment -- for a moment -- there is peace in his heart. Because the solution seems obvious, does it not? If this thing is destroying him, get rid of it. So he walks, as if in a trance, to his studio once again. He finds one of his largest chisels and one of his strongest hammers, and he carries them to the Sephiroth Room. And he tells himself that he knows what he will do, because it is simple, it is straightforward, and it is necessary. He will take the chisel, he tells himself, and he will place it against that accursed face, and he will break it. He will bring the hammer down, and then he will do it again. And again. And again, and again, and again, until there is nothing but dust. But when he looks upon that lovely visage again, he falters. He feels every part of him tense. Feels himself shake. With anger, and also with fear. He tells himself it's irrational. Completely mad. He fears losing it, but he shouldn't, damn it! It's only an object. An object that has ruined him. That he has let ruin him. He tells himself that no matter how much he may fear losing it, he fears having lost his reputation, his health, his sanity, far more. So he steels himself. And he lifts the chisel and he lifts the hammer and he positions them...Or rather, he tries to. Tries to slam the chisel in -- no need for delicacy when one is merely aiming to destroy, right? -- but... He can't. He...he can't. Oh Goddess. Oh Goddess, he can't do it. Even as he plunges it towards that precious marble, he finds his own hand reflexively betrays him, pulling it to the side at the last possible fraction of a second. It whiffs past the face of his most beloved and most reviled work, into empty air. He stares at his own hand in shock. Horror. He stands there for a long, horrified moment, before he begins to shake again. No -- tremble.He feels his grip loosen on the chisel. Feels it slide out of his hand. Feels himself let it go, watching it for what feels like hours as it plunges to the floor. It hits with a loud, echoing clatter, the clang of metal against tile. The sound breaks the trance. He feels his breath hitch, a moment later, as the full impact of what he just failed to do, hits him. Trapped, he realizes. He is trapped. His own hands -- the same gifted hands that have always served him so well, the same hands that made this impossible thing -- have betrayed him. His feels his chest constrict. His eyes grow warm, his vision blurring with tears, as he collapses onto his knees. He doesn't so much sob, as he does choke and gasp for air around the great, painful spasms in his chest. He feels heat on his cheeks, tastes salt on his lips, and realizes he is weeping. He is no longer sure he cares. His tears falling on Sephiroth's base, broken and lonely, he finally gives in and prays to Goddess for help, for relief from this pain and madness that has overtaken him, and as he does, he embraces the base of the statute, pressing his crying face against it, desiring, if he can't have proper human contact at this point, at least the familiar, soothing coolness of its marble against his flushed cheeks......only to feel it grow warm beneath his touch. Which he initially thinks is, surely, just his own heat, or his imagination? But then it moves. And Sephiroth - warm, and moving, and breathing, and alive - reaches down gently to stroke his hair, and as Genesis lifts his head to look up at him, gaze at him in astonishment, that silken hand moves to under his chin, the thumb gently stroking his cheek. The eyes - now a brilliant, vivid green - look upon him tenderly. \"There is no need to weep any longer, my love,\" the former statue says, his voice a melodious baritone. \"The Goddess has heard your prayers...\"",

      "spider-like limbs reached out in every direction, bent and battered and bruised, in an attempt to walk upon this cursed land.",
      "piercing his ragged, yellow skin, bones stuck out and tugged and pulled until he bled.",
      "instinctively, as foreign footsteps trod into its territory, the creature glanced up at its next meal, wolfish teeth barred.",
      "as its rat-like, luminous eyes stared at the thing, it saw blood leaked from his dishevelled limbs, and pale, bony fingers reached out to whatever god watched over this cruel realm.",
      "a feast was waiting, staring back at the creature: adrenaline poured through its veins, excitement danced on the tips of its toes and fingers, and like that of an animal, swiftly sunk its yellowed teeth into the prey.",
      "like a perverse dance, prey and predator struck at each other, fangs tearing and cutting and scratching, the thing sharply and cleverly biting its delicate eyes.",
      "now having to rely only on sound, the creature slunk into the shadows, crawling into the safety of darkness.",
      "yet the prey became predator and held no mercy, and carefully, quietly, dragged himself further into the alley.",
      "chasing the struggling, grasping breaths, he easily found the dying creature, which lay like a pile of rags on the concrete, and drowning in its own, thick blood.",
      "as the sun steadily rose, the ragged creature merely looked upon this thing, and yet met only with a horrific monster that the night once concealed."

    "text": "Persephone in spring helps flowers bloom, tendrils twine, honey taste sweeter in beehives clustering in the trees of her mother's garden. Her skin is like rich earth turned over, her eyes gold-flecked as the dark heart of pansies with pollen, her smile the prim twist of a rosebud closed against curious eyes. She walks in her mother's verdant wake, and sings with dryads and swims with naiads and laughs when Artemis' nymphs offer her the season's first fruit, the best cut of meat. In autumn, she comes home from home, from her mother's to her husband's house, and changes her daisy-crown for one of ivory and gold, her girl's short dress for the sweeping robes of a queen. Dread Persephone sits at her husband's side and rules over the dead. Her companions are Hekate, and the spirits of heroic women in the Elysian fields, wise Rhadamanthus. For amusement she trails her fingers in the rivers that run through Hades, feeds forgetfulness to heroes, wrath to the forgetful dead, sorrow to those striving already in Tartarus. But O, who can take from a goddess the gifts with which she was born? In the asphodel fields flowers turn their yearning faces towards her, and from the seven pomegranate seeds of her first feast she grows a snarled knot of trees that bear silver leaves and golden fruit that open to scatter rubies. From the tree she cuts a stave and shapes it to her liking, and coats with oil from the olive groves that whisper on the coast, in the winter sun far above her head. Her dread husband comes to her bed of night, darker in the lamplit darkness of Hades' realm, and kisses her mouth and then her hands, on his knees before her and supplicant, touches her knees and parts them. Beneath her dress of silver black, between the thighs smooth as new-sprung leaves, he finds a harness of new-tooled leather, fine as any hero's belt, and nestled in the curls of her mound and jutting proudly out a stave of warm wood, smelling of spring. \"You will play the boy for me tonight, husband,\" Persephone tells him, and Hades bows, and kisses her hands again, and stoops to set his mouth against the rounded tip of his queen's new phallus. It is not their first time with this game; when he had looked too long at the nymph Minthe she had bound him to the bed with mint suckers and greased him with mint oil and fucked him till he could smell nothing but her and himself, their pleasure overwhelming even the brightness of mint. But this time, it is no punishment, and she opens him up slowly, holds him in her lap as though he is still the young godling he can scarcely remember, who escaped the cave of his father's belly and took shelter in another, as though there are things in any world that can yet make him tremble. There are. His wife's mouth on his throat where ichor beats too near the surface of his unbreakable skin, his wife's hands on his buttocks, parting them and penetrating him, his wife's eyes closing in bliss as she takes him as his brother does his boys.",

    "text": "\"What, exactly, do you think you're doing?\" Poseidon looked around until he saw Sophos, one of his favorite worshippers in this town. It was a tiny seaside town where Poseidon knew he could experiment without being observed--by divine eyes, at least. And the people of the town were unlikely to tell anyone if they did see him. Still, there were standards to maintain. \"Is that how you speak to your chosen god?\" Poseidon asked with a raised brow. \"Apologies. What are you doing, my lord?\" Sophos said. His tone was respectful, but he was grinning. Poseidon always liked that grin. \"I'm experimenting,\" Poseidon said. He looked human, if humans were seven feet tall with stormy blue skin and hair that floated around their heads like gently-swaying seaweed. He was immerged in water to his waist, and the water around him was surging unnaturally, sometimes taking on strange forms before falling back into the sea. \"Yes, but to what end?\" Sophos asked. He came closer to the shore. He was barefoot and wore only a chiton. His face was open with curiosity. Poseidon smiled at the young man. \"Well,\" the god said, \"My brother, may his bolts be ever bright and his aim ever true, is somewhat known for his, ah, forays into the world of unusual shapes. The swan, the shower of gold, and the rest.\" \"Yes, I recall,\" Sophos agreed. He tried to look solemn, but his lips trembled and his eyes sparkled with amusement. \"Well, I thought--perhaps morals might remember the fealty they owe me if I had a similar transformation.\" \"An interesting idea, my divine lord. And so...?\" \"Behold!\" Poseidon cried. Water rose in a circle around him, hiding his form. When it fell back to the sea, Poseidon was... different. \"My lord?\" Sophos looked surprised. He'd flinched when Poseidon had shouted, but he had regained his calm during the ensuing transformation. Cautiously, the mortal said, \"You... look the same?\" Poseidon looked down at his own body. He could have sworn it worked. \"Ah,\" he said, \"I see the problem.\" With little effort, he pulled himself ashore, scaling the rocks until he was standing next to Sophos. His new form made the process even easier. He still had the shape of a man from crown to torso, but starting at his hips his body blossomed into many powerful tentacles. They were a dusky purple above and a lilac-grey below. Sophos stared at him with naked curiosity. The god's tentacles were a variety of sizes and shapes. A few of the largest looked like they would provide the god mobility. Some of them, a mixture of sturdy and delicate, looked suitable for grasping. Still others, Sophos could only guess at. \"What do you think?\" Poseidon asked. He held out some of his tentacles so his follower could better observe them. \"Am I not magnificent?\" \"Absolutely, my divine lord,\" Sophos agreed. \"May I?\" Respectfully, he held a hand up in the direction of Poseidon's new limbs. Poseidon grinned. Of all the people in this town, he was glad it was Sophos who had found him. The man's curiosity was refreshingly robust. Few others would have the gall to ask to touch. \"You may.\" Sophos laid a gentle hand on the flesh of one of the largest tentacles. It was damp, obviously, and rather slick. The slipperiness was great enough that it implied an excretion of some kind--thought it was far less viscous than anything that could be described as a \"slime.\" The limb was warm--far warmer than Sophos would have expected, considering how cool the ocean tended to be even this close to shore. In texture, the limb was soft yet firm--rather like the soft flesh of one's arm or leg, underlaid by bone. Sophos brought a second hand up to join the first in exploring Poseidon's tentacles. His touch was gentle but not timid, and Poseidon enjoyed it. As a god, one generally did not find oneself being petted like a common goat or cow. Sophos gently held one of Poseidon's smaller tentacles in his hands, turning it until he could examine the underdeveloped suction cups on the underside. He ran a gentle finger along the inside of one of them, and Poseidon inhaled sharply. \"Sorry,\" the mortal said at once. \"Hurts?\" \"No,\" Poseidon said, forcing himself to speak normally. He lied, \"Tickles.\" It most certainly did not tickle, and Poseidon willed himself not to do anything so embarrassing as blush. \"Sorry,\" Sophos said again. \"What about this?\" This time he pressed more firmly as he ran his finger along the inside of the suction cup. \"Ah,\" Poseidon said. \"Doesn't tickle.\" No, it did not. \"Figures. My legs are like that,\" Sophos said, already sounding absent as he leaned closer to inspect the suction cup. \"Like what?\" \"My legs. Ticklish if it's just a light touch. Needs to be firmer or I can't stop kicking.\" Sophos touched the center of the suction cup. His finger came away slippery. \"Interesting,\" the human said, rubbing his thumb and forefinger together. He pressed again in the center of the suction cup, finding it very slippery. When he rubbed firmly on the spot, he discovered that there seemed to be a gland of some sort in the middle of the suction cup, and it was clearly producing the slippery stuff. Curiosity clear on his face, he turned the tentacle in his hand so he could rub the center of another suction cup. This one also had a gland in the center that could be coaxed into producing slick liquid. Without hesitating, he took up one of the thicker tentacles and performed the same inspection. The suction cups on this tentacle were different, and he applied himself to investigating the differences at once. When he ran his finger along the outer edge of the cup, it retracted and then relaxed back into its former location. \"Is that voluntary?\" he asked. \"It is not,\" Poseidon said. Sophos totally failed to note the faint note of strain in his divine lord's voice. \"Fascinating.\" The center of the larger cups did not seem to contain a gland, but close inspection showed that similar glands seemed to exist nestled down between the larger suction cups. Sophos rubbed one gently and was delighted when he was rewarded with a lazy spurt of slippery fluid. He had just noticed a difference in this fluid versus the stuff produced by the smaller tentacle--a difference in viscosity, maybe?--when Poseidon spoke. \"Sophos,\" he said slowly. \"Are you aware of why my brother generally transforms?\" \"Ah--yes?\" Sophos said, glancing up. It took him a second to wrest his brain away from the question of the different slippery excretions--maybe it reflected a different function? But what? Or just a different composition for the same function, resulting in slight differences in character without affecting--\"Oh! My lord?\" One of the thicker tentacles was wrapping around Sophos's waist, and a thinner one was twining around one calf. \"I believe I asked you a question.\" \"Why--oh. For, um, seduction of women,\" Sophos said. Poseidon was pleased to see a blush spread across his follower's face, but he was far more pleased that Sophos did nothing to pull away. \"Generally, yes, but my brother was never overly concerned with gender.\" \"And, and you, my divine lord?\" Sophos sounded breathless. Poseidon smiled and used his tentacles to pull the man closer. He wrapped his arms around the man, savoring the strength and vitality of his frame. \"I find myself completely unconcerned.\" Poseidon kissed the human, relishing the warmth of his mortal body and the comfortable way Sophos's hands rested on his shoulders. Sophos returned the kiss shyly at first, but he quickly became more ardent. Poseidon pulled away and let his mouth wander down the man's neck, and he tilted his head back most pliantly. Poseidon continued to kiss his lover's neck as he spoke. \"Were you aware,\" he asked, \"That suction cups serve a sensory function as well as helping the tentacle grip?\" \"Ah! They do?\" Sophos sounded quite dazed. \"Ahn...\" Poseidon nipped his neck, wrapping more tentacles around the man. \"Indeed,\" Poseidon said. \"Which means that your... investigation was rather stimulating.\" He applied his teeth to the juncture of Sophos's neck and shoulder, earning another breathless noise. \"Oh. I'm--mm!--sorry?\" \"Apology accepted.\" Poseidon applied his attention to the other side of the man's neck and jaw. He continued cradle the man in his arms. Two of his stronger tentacles served to guide the man's legs up so they were wrapped around his own torso. The man's thin chiton hiked up easily, and Sophos pressed himself firmly against Poseidon's body. \"So when I was--ah!--touching your suction cups--mm--and you flinched, it wasn't because it tickled?\" Sophos panted. \"Not in the conventional sense of the word, no,\" Poseidon said. Sophos slid a hand down from the god's shoulder and let his thumb graze one of his nipples. \"More like that?\" Sophos guessed. His lips were swollen from kissing, and there was a succession of love bites on both side of his neck. \"Very much,\" Poseidon growled. He held Sophos's hips more firmly in his tentacles and brought another pair up to brace his back. His hands were free to cup the back of Sophos's neck and cradle the back of his head. A delicate tentacle slipped inside the man's clothes to rub the hard bud of the mortal's nipple. Sophos made such lovely noises that Poseidon simply had to play with the other one as well. Sophos clung to him and pressed open-mouthed kisses on his neck. \"My divine lord,\" Sophos panted. \"A question occurs.\" He shivered as the tentacles continued to tease his nipples. \"Hm?\" Poseidon asked. He kissed his mortal, who was always full of questions. \"The... fluid your new appendages produce,\" Sophos said, blushing. \"Is it for... does it have a purpose?\" Poseidon grinned. \"Would you like to see what it's for? Or perhaps you'd like to guess?\" Sophos blushed and blinked in a most appealing way. \"I think you should show me, my lord.\" Sophos's opening was tight when Poseidon touched it. He rubbed one of his most delicate tentacles against it, making it slick. Sophos moaned as he did so, hands moving restlessly across Poseidon's shoulders and back. Poseidon watched his face closely for signs of discomfort or distress. Before long, the tightly furled muscle relaxed. Poseidon pressed gently to test Sophos's reaction. His face went slack with anticipation. Poseidon eased away, not yet penetrating the mortal. His brow wrinkled and he blinked his eyes open. \"My lord?\" Poseidon kissed him hungrily, delighting in the way Sophos reciprocated. Sophos seemed to appreciate having his hair pulled gently while being kissed, the god observed. He continued to tease the human's hole, not yet entering him. He wanted Sophos to ache for it. Sophos was moaning in the back of his throat when he started to really squirm in Poseidon's grip. He tried to press down onto the tentacle that was teasing his ass, but he was held too tightly. He whined, pressing his face against Poseidon's jaw. \"My-my divine lord,\" he panted. \"Please, don't tease me any more.\" The tentacles holding him tightened. \"Ah! Please, my lord, please.\" The tentacle stroked across his hole. He trembled. \"Let-let me give myself to you, sir, I want to. I want to feel you inside me--ah!\" Finally the tentacle pressed inside him. It moved slowly, sliding in easily thanks to the slickness of his god's excretions. Sophos cried out in pleasure as it filled his ass, stretching him with its bulk. The tentacle rubbed against his prostate and he writhed in his lord's strong grip. \"Yes, yes,\" he chanted. \"Yes, thank you, yes.\" A tentacle wrapped around his cock. Sophos flung his head back with a cry that was halfway to a sob. \"My lord! My lord, I--I can't, oh, no, I'll come--\" \"No?\" Poseidon asked, stilling all his tentacles. Urgently, he cupped Sophos's face in his hands, searching his face for distress. Sophos was still trembling in his grip, body humming with pleasure, but-- \"I'll come,\" the human panted. \"If you--I'm already so close, I won't be able to control myself.\" A shudder wracked him, and Poseidon instinctively tightened his grip on the man. The mortal moaned needily. \"I'll come, I'll come--\" \"Do you not want to come?\" Poseidon asked. \"I thought that was the point.\" Sophos looked at him from under his lashes. His face was flushed, eyes dark with lust. \"Not without permission,\" the human breathed. Poseidon swallowed hard. \"Then you'd better control yourself,\" he growled. Sophos bit his lip and nodded, body going tight around the tentacle inside him. He nodded at the god to continue with his ministrations. Having the god's tentacles inside and around him was absolutely overwhelming. Sophos pressed his face into side of Poseidon's neck and whined. The tentacle on his cock squeezed rhythmically, which could have made Sophos come all on its own, given time. It was joined by another, slender tentacle that rubbed across the sensitive head of his cock. Sophos's moans were so overwhelmed they sounded like sobs. The tentacles on his cock and in his ass moved in a counter-rhythm, so Sophos had no moment when he did not feel like he would drown in pleasure. He rested his forehead on his god's shoulder. Sophos, lovely creature that he was, was whispering to himself now. \"Don't come, don't come, don't come, don't come don't come don't--\" When Poseidon realized what his lover was saying, he had to kiss the man. He tugged sharply on Sophos's hair, drawing his head back to kiss. Sophos cried out before Poseidon sealed their mouths together. Poseidon tried to maintain the kiss, but Sophos turned his face away. \"Sir! Please, I'm going to--tell me I can, tell me it's okay--\" \"Come,\" Poseidon begged the mortal. \"Come, let me see, I want it--\" Sophos needed no more encouragement than that. His whole body bowed, muscles going tight around the tentacle buried in him. He cried out as his cock pulsed, ribbons of cum painting their stomachs. Poseidon held him as he shuddered through waves of pleasure. Pleasure released him slowly, in ever-receding waves like a retreating tide. Finally, there was nothing for Sophos but to breathe and catch his breath. He moaned thinly when Poseidon pulled the tentacle from his ass, but the aftershock passed quickly. Poseidon found that, having tested his new form and bedded an enthusiastic devotee, he did not want to let go. Instead, he repositioned the human, gathering him closer and wrapping more tentacles around his whole body. Sophos shifted uncertainly. \"My lord...?\" \"Rest,\" Poseidon said. \"You have done me a service in giving me feedback on this form. Let me care for you for a time.\" Poseidon felt sure the human would instantly be full of a hundred thousand questions, but it seemed that his human was tired. \"If you're certain, my lord,\" Sophos said. His eyes were already closing. Poseidon smoothed a lock of the man's hair away with a gentle hand. As Sophos slept, Poseidon gazed out to sea. The human's breath could scarcely be heard above the ocean's waves, but the god fancied that they complemented each other.",

      "\"A question occurs.\"",
      "He shivered as the tentacles continued to tease his nipples.",
      "\"Hm?\" Poseidon asked.",
      "He kissed his mortal, who was always full of questions.",
      "\"The... fluid your new appendages produce,\" Sophos said, blushing.",
      "\"Is it for... does it have a purpose?\" Poseidon grinned.",
      "\"Would you like to see what it's for?",
      "Or perhaps you'd like to guess?\" Sophos blushed and blinked in a most appealing way.",
      "\"I think you should show me, my lord.\"",
      "Sophos's opening was tight when Poseidon touched it.",
      "He rubbed one of his most delicate tentacles against it, making it slick.",
      "Sophos moaned as he did so, hands moving restlessly across Poseidon's shoulders and back.",
      "Poseidon watched his face closely for signs of discomfort or distress.",
      "Before long, the tightly furled muscle relaxed.",
      "Poseidon pressed gently to test Sophos's reaction.",
      "His face went slack with anticipation.",
      "Poseidon eased away, not yet penetrating the mortal.",
      "His brow wrinkled and he blinked his eyes open.",
      "\"My lord?\" Poseidon kissed him hungrily, delighting in the way Sophos reciprocated.",
      "Sophos seemed to appreciate having his hair pulled gently while being kissed, the god observed.",
      "He continued to tease the human's hole, not yet entering him.",
      "He wanted Sophos to ache for it.",
      "Sophos was moaning in the back of his throat when he started to really squirm in Poseidon's grip.",
      "He tried to press down onto the tentacle that was teasing his ass, but he was held too tightly.",
      "He whined, pressing his face against Poseidon's jaw.",
      "\"My-my divine lord,\" he panted.",
      "\"Please, don't tease me any more.\"",
      "The tentacles holding him tightened.",
      "\"Ah!",
      "Please, my lord, please.\"",
      "The tentacle stroked across his hole.",
      "He trembled.",
      "\"Let-let me give myself to you, sir, I want to.",
      "I want to feel you inside me--ah!\"",
      "Finally the tentacle pressed inside him.",
      "It moved slowly, sliding in easily thanks to the slickness of his god's excretions.",
      "Sophos cried out in pleasure as it filled his ass, stretching him with its bulk.",
      "The tentacle rubbed against his prostate and he writhed in his lord's strong grip.",
      "\"Yes, yes,\" he chanted.",
      "\"Yes, thank you, yes.\"",
      "A tentacle wrapped around his cock.",
      "Sophos flung his head back with a cry that was halfway to a sob.",
      "\"My lord!",
      "My lord, I--I can't, oh, no, I'll come--\" \"No?\" Poseidon asked, stilling all his tentacles.",
      "Urgently, he cupped Sophos's face in his hands, searching his face for distress.",
      "Sophos was still trembling in his grip, body humming with pleasure, but-- \"I'll come,\" the human panted.",
      "\"If you--I'm already so close, I won't be able to control myself.\"",
      "A shudder wracked him, and Poseidon instinctively tightened his grip on the man.",
      "The mortal moaned needily.",
      "\"I'll come, I'll come--\" \"Do you not want to come?\" Poseidon asked.",
      "\"I thought that was the point.\"",
      "Sophos looked at him from under his lashes.",
      "His face was flushed, eyes dark with lust.",
      "\"Not without permission,\" the human breathed.",
      "Poseidon swallowed hard.",
      "\"Then you'd better control yourself,\" he growled.",
      "Sophos bit his lip and nodded, body going tight around the tentacle inside him.",
      "He nodded at the god to continue with his ministrations.",
      "Having the god's tentacles inside and around him was absolutely overwhelming.",
      "Sophos pressed his face into side of Poseidon's neck and whined.",
      "The tentacle on his cock squeezed rhythmically, which could have made Sophos come all on its own, given time.",
      "It was joined by another, slender tentacle that rubbed across the sensitive head of his cock.",
      "Sophos's moans were so overwhelmed they sounded like sobs.",
      "The tentacles on his cock and in his ass moved in a counter-rhythm, so Sophos had no moment when he did not feel like he would drown in pleasure.",
      "He rested his forehead on his god's shoulder.",
      "Sophos, lovely creature that he was, was whispering to himself now.",
      "\"Don't come, don't come, don't come, don't come don't come don't--\" When Poseidon realized what his lover was saying, he had to kiss the man.",
      "He tugged sharply on Sophos's hair, drawing his head back to kiss.",
      "Sophos cried out before Poseidon sealed their mouths together.",
      "Poseidon tried to maintain the kiss, but Sophos turned his face away.",
      "\"Sir!",
      "Please, I'm going to--tell me I can, tell me it's okay--\" \"Come,\" Poseidon begged the mortal.",
      "\"Come, let me see, I want it--\" Sophos needed no more encouragement than that.",
      "His whole body bowed, muscles going tight around the tentacle buried in him.",
      "He cried out as his cock pulsed, ribbons of cum painting their stomachs.",
      "Poseidon held him as he shuddered through waves of pleasure.",
      "Pleasure released him slowly, in ever-receding waves like a retreating tide.",
      "Finally, there was nothing for Sophos but to breathe and catch his breath.",
      "He moaned thinly when Poseidon pulled the tentacle from his ass, but the aftershock passed quickly.",
      "Poseidon found that, having tested his new form and bedded an enthusiastic devotee, he did not want to let go.",
      "Instead, he repositioned the human, gathering him closer and wrapping more tentacles around his whole body.",
      "Sophos shifted uncertainly.",
      "\"My lord...?\" \"Rest,\" Poseidon said.",
      "\"You have done me a service in giving me feedback on this form.",
      "Let me care for you for a time.\"",
      "Poseidon felt sure the human would instantly be full of a hundred thousand questions, but it seemed that his human was tired.",
      "\"If you're certain, my lord,\" Sophos said.",
      "His eyes were already closing.",
      "Poseidon smoothed a lock of the man's hair away with a gentle hand.",
      "As Sophos slept, Poseidon gazed out to sea.",
      "The human's breath could scarcely be heard above the ocean's waves, but the god fancied that they complemented each other."

    "text": "There was something asleep, deep down under the earth. Trapped, sealed, imprisoned in a cage of stone and infertile earth was a creature of life and greenery. Once she'd been a force to be reckoned with, a pulsating light in this world of dim, mediocre beings. A goddess, worshipped for her beauty and grace, now forgotten in the lifeless depths. But during the thousands of years in this grave, she had time to think, time to scheme and time to collect the little bit of power she had left. And so she began stretching, reaching, sending tender roots towards the surface. She needed energy to free herself, and these roots, these lifelines would gain it for her. She was not beaten yet... Rose Heaton was a curious girl. Almost twenty, all alone in a mansion in the woods, she had far too much free time and more than enough to explore. It didn't happen every week that her parents left her in charge of their ridiculously splendid vacation house. Also, she felt a little too reminded of the beginning of a horror story, so she spend as much time as possible in the near village or the forest. Both led to interesting discoveries. The first one was that even though every girl in this mexican backwater town somehow looked absolutely gorgeous, no one could reach the incomparable beauty of Selina Hernandez. The second one was that there existed a cave not far from the mansion. A cool, shady cave that was her personal heaven in this tropical forest of hellish heat. Rose sighed when she entered her favorite place. The cavern was broad and open, allowing the little sunlight that shone through the trees to illuminate the stone walls. But today she wasn't here to enjoy the cool air. Today she would explore the tunnel she'd discovered yesterday. It was dark, but she had a pocket torch and her mobile for light. Smiling adventurously she stepped inside without hesitation. The walls were made up of the same black stone than the rest of the cave, but the ground was damp earth and sand. Excitement flooded her as she left the last bit of daylight behind. She'd always lacked that healthy amount of fear or apprehension, which had gotten her into trouble more than once. But as she followed the tunnel further and deeper down, she couldn't help but smirk. Thank god her parents weren't here. Her smirk vanished during the next hour. Man, this tunnel was long! And not as exciting as expected. She'd passed a fork earlier... Maybe she should try another way? Abruptly she came to a halt. Before her was... sunlight. The tunnel had broadened into a second cave, with a high ceiling and unnaturally smooth walls. She squinted at the source of the light. Indeed. There was a narrow opening in the ceiling that allowed a beam of sunlight to illuminate the cave. Fascinated Rose turned off her pocket torch and stepped further in. A sweet scent filled the air, something flowery that made her a little dizzy. Only now she noticed the thick vines that covered the ground. \"Didn't know plants could grow this deep down\" she mused and observed the tendrils with enthusiasm. Carefully she touched the dark green, leafless vines and gasped. They were... warm. Curious she walked on, following the beguiling scent. It became more and more intensive and Rose found herself closing her eyes, only focusing on the bewitching smell of petals and sweetness and honey... She didn't even realize she'd come to a stand until something touched her ankle. Her eyes opened and she looked around drowsily. Her lids were heavy and a pleasant warmth pooled in her lower belly. She must have walked too much... her limbs felt so heavy, so tired... Maybe she should just take a little nap before she went back... back... back where? Something touched her ankle again and she looked down. A thin tendril had snaked itself around her foot and calf, winding its way in spirals up her leg. Wait... plants... didn't usually do that, right? Gasping Rose snapped out of the haze that had filled her mind and shook the tendril off. Something was wrong, something was happening to her. She had to get out of here. Startled she started running back to the tunnel. Every breath filled her nostrils with more of this captivating scent, slowed her movements, made her lids lower... \"Ah!\" She yelled when she stumbled over a vine that appeared out of nowhere. She landed hard, and before she could even think of standing back up, the vine closed around her leg and held her in place. Suddenly more vines came from every direction and took hold of her, their grip firm and unbreakable. \"Stop!\" She screamed and struggled against them, but they only tightened their grasp and pulled her back to the center of the cave. \"N-No! Help!\" Another tendril coiled itself around her neck, behind her head and appeared agin in front of her face. The smooth green skin was covered in a pink fluid that smelled exactly like the scent that had entranced her earlier. Just much, much more intense. Abruptly she closed her mouth as the tendril started to rub itself against her lips. Incapable of screaming now, she tried to get her hands free, but the embrace of the vines was too strong. Thinner vines had started to sneak under her shirt and stroked her stomach as they winded itself around her torso. A moan tingled in her throat, but she couldn't open her mouth without giving the tendril at her lips a chance to slip in. The vines apparently came to the same conclusion, for they began to rub back and forth on her skin and the tendrils around her stomach snaked towards her chest. Rose's eyes widened as a few vines managed to sneak under the waistband of her shorts. They wriggled between the fabric and her skin, causing Rose to muffle a gasp, and proceeded to go deeper. More tendrils came from the opposite direction, following her leg up to her ass. Rose breath fastened and against her will her nipples stiffened. The tendrils at her torso seemed happy about that, since they began to circle her breasts, coating them in what Rose supposed to be the same pink goo that covered the tendril over her face. It tingled on her skin and suddenly the movements of the tendrils felt much more intense. She pressed herself against them out of reflex, desperate for more stimulation before she could control herself. The tendril at her lips pressed more urgently, but she shook her head and tried to shake it off. And it actually retreated a little! Rose dared to hope, but instead of letting her go, it was replaced by another vine. This one wasn't covered in this pink fluid, but in leafs and buds. It hovered over her face like a snake as the buds bloomed one by one and released a flood of this heavenly scent. She could feel her struggle against the vines slow, her muscles relax, as the final bud at the top of the vine opened. It was bigger than the others, a lush, yellow flower that glowed in a seductive golden light. Her face went slack. The vine made the flower spin slowly and moved it in circles over her face. Rose followed it with her eyes, incapable of looking away. It was... beautiful, no, magical, something celestial... it was everything... she had to watch it, had to observe it carefully, because what if it vanished? What if she would never see it again? No, she had to look at it... nothing was more important... She was so distracted by the beautiful light that she didn't notice the vines at her hips until one shot forwards and pushed its tip inside her asshole. She gasped, her lips parting in shock, and the tendril at her lips plunged inside her mouth. She tried to pull her head back, she really did, but the tendril had her neck and head in its firm grasp and immediately started thrusting back and forth inside her mouth, rubbing against her tongue. And oh, oh, the pink goo was intoxicating. Her lips closed around the tendril on their own accord, her tongue stroking up and down its skin. It wasn't as smooth as thought, a little textured actually, but it was full of this pink sweetness and she wanted more. She sucked with abandon as the rich taste drowned out every thought on her mind and she went limp in the vines' embrace. She wanted to be here forever, she realized as the flower captivated her gaze again. She wanted to suck at the tendrils, to watch the beautiful flower, to let them do everything they wanted to her... forever. With a gasp, Rose jolted awake. Confused she looked around in her room. What... what had happened? Where was the cave, the strange plant...? \"Oh my god...\" That hadn't been real, right? It was a dream, a nightmare, nothing more. Right? Her memory was incomplete somehow, tinted in pink lights and a haze of lust. She remembered a flower... and the strong embrace of dozens of vines, touching her... Rose own moan shook her out of her trance and she realized she was touching herself. Nononono, no, that couldn't have been real. She must have passed out from the heat, dreamed a lot of weird stuff, walked back home and immediately fallen asleep again. Another moan reminded her she still hadn't stopped touching herself and she mobilized all her willpower to rip her hand away. This was definitely not normal. Panicking she jumped out of her bed and practically ran into the shower, scrubbing the sweat off her skin until it was red. She didn't even dry her hair before she got dressed and took her bike. She didn't want to think about how she had acted yeste- in that dream, she had to distract herself. And what was more distracting than Selina Hernandez? The way to town that usually took her half an hour passed in 15 minutes today. By the time she reached the cafe Selina worked at, she was out of breath and just as sweaty as she'd been this morning. \"Hey, Rose!\", Selina's best friend, Cherry, greeted her when she stepped in. She was a year younger than Selina and almost a foot shorter, all bouncy happiness and red, curly hair. She was cute, but when Selina entered the room she was all but forgotten. Selina was gorgeous. She was elegant, she was graceful, she was pretty. Long black hair, skin like bronze and dark eyes that made Rose melt like chocolate. She waved at Rose before taking a guest's order. Already in ninth heaven, Rose sat down next to Cherry, who immediately began chattering about some minor matters. The heat, the locals, food... whatever. \"Rose, hi!\", Selina greeted her when she finally came to their table. \"What's up?\" Rose blushed and felt the memories of her dream fade far into the background. \"The temperature, that's what.\" She replied, trying to distract from the fact her face was bright red. \"I am melting!\" Selina laughed. \"I feel you. I mean, I am used to this heat but even for me it's extreme. And you've been here for just two weeks, so...\" \"You can always just come to the mansion, you know? We've got a pool, parasols, air conditioning... it's just boring all alone.\" \"Huh?\", Selina said, distracted by a call from another table. \"Sorry, I gotta get back to work. See you later!\" And off she went. \"We'd love to come!\", she heard Cherry say, but Roses attention was focused solely on Selina, who took the other guests order with a winning smile. Why couldn't she have just a little more time with her? Just a few hours with her, and her alone. Sighing Rose turned back to Cherry. Maybe she could tell Selina- Huh? Suddenly she found herself eye-to-eye with the cute redhead, who had come a whole lot closer. Her light brown eyes were glassy and her pupils dilated, as if in trance. Her face was very, very close to her own. \"Uh... Cherry?\", Rose asked confused. Immediately Cherry blinked and snapped back. \"Oh, uh, sorry! That was awkward, it's just that...\" She blushed and looked away. \"Y-You smell good. Flowery. Did you get a new shampoo or something?\" Rose shifted uncomfortably. \"Uh... yes... something like that.\" Rose couldn't sleep that night. Despite air conditioning, she was sweating and breathing hard, as if she had just ran a marathon. Tossing and turning in her sheets she forced her eyes closed and once again tried to calm down, but it was no use. Her skin itched and her pajama felt too tight on her skin. Her mind was hazy and flashes of beautiful golden light filled her thoughts, making her breath and breasts heavy. Heat pooled between her thighs as imaginary fingers sneaked their way up to her cunt. Rose moaned. Finally, it became to much and her hand pressed against one of her tits. Her nipple was hard, so hard, and in her mind she saw Selina curl her lips around it. A gasp escaped her and her free hand snapped to her bedside table. Blind she opened the drawer and searched for the toy she kept in there. A sigh left her lips when she finally felt it slip between her folds, firm and hard and enough to imagine Selina holding it, Selina thrusting it into her wet, waiting cunt... She wailed and sped her movements up, rocking against her hands as she fucked herself. How would Selina's moans sound? Faster. Surely she would be loud, loud and viscous. Harder. She would have her pinned beneath her, begging for her touch and be happy to give it. More. She would thrust her fingers into her cunt, would suck her nipples sore, all while being tinted in golden light and fucked by dozens of green vines herself... Before she could fully understand where that thought had come from, the image send her over the edge and her mind lost focus. So caught up in her ecstasy, she didn't realize she had gotten out of bed and left the house. She was still drifting off into her sweet fantasy of Selina, not noticing that she was walking through the forest, stark naked and cum leaking down her thigh. When she reached the cave, passed the tunnel and arrived at the underground cavern, all she saw in front of her were Selina's lips, Selina's breasts, Selina's thighs trembling from desire. The soft touch on her legs didn't worry her, it felt good, right even. The vines sneaking up her legs felt good too, like she was meant to be here. Her clit, hypersensitive from her last orgasm, sent bolts of pleasure through her when the green tentacles rubbed themselves against it. It was the sound of her own moan that made her open her eyes in surprise again. Wait. What was she doing here? Why the hell was she- The vines that had stroked her limbs tightened all of a sudden, as if sensing that her trance faded. She had no chance to really wake up before something slick pressed against her lips and her mouth was filled with sweet, sweet nectar. She moaned and closed her eyes as the memories of their last encounter returned. Orgasm after orgasm the tentacles had drawn from her, pumping into her cunt until she was mad with pleasure. She had screamed for more, begged to be touched everywhere until her whole body was coated in the plants pink juice. And now she wanted it again. She didn't fight it when they pulled her closer to their core, to their origin and to the giant bud towering over them. Golden light basked her as it bloomed and Rose grinned blissfully around the tentacle in her mouth. The vines stroked her in appreciation and sneaked closer to her hips, pushing her limp legs apart as if she were a doll. A muffled \"Yes!\", left her mouth as the first one pushed against her dripping folds and she bucked her hips, hoping it would finally enter her. But now that she was completely theirs, the vines apparently wanted to take their time, make her wait. The vine at her cunt had begun to rub itself against her entrance and applied delicious pressure, without actually pushing deeper. Desperately she tried to press her hips against it, but the other vines held her back. The firm grip tightened the longer she struggled, rewarding her for her eagerness by coating her in their nectar, but punishing her for her disobedience by neglecting her sex. Finally she gave up, resorting to pleading instead and sucked tenderly on the tentacle in her mouth. Her hands, trapped somewhere beneath her in a mass of writhing green, each grabbed a thick vine and stroked it up and down, up and down, coating her fingers in their nectar. It seemed to work: the vines collectively shuddered and the one at her cunt took mercy on her, plunging into her with a force that made her gasp. Encouraged by her obvious approval, it moved inside her, snaking its way deeper into her vagina and coating her insides in the pink aphrodisiac. She moaned and pumped the vines in her hands faster, though her movements lost their rhythm when a second vine joined the one in her cunt and began swirling around. If the tentacle in her mouth hadn't held her steady, her head would have hit the ground when the muscles of her neck failed. Not stopping with their vicious thrusting, the vines lifted her higher until she hang limb in their embrace, her knees at the height of her head and her legs spread. \"More\", she mumbled against the sweet tentacle, \"Please, more\" Generously, another vine spiraled up her leg and made a beeline for her hips, this time the backside. Thickly lubricated with its slick, pink goo, it didn't waste time with letting her adjust. Instead it forcefully rammed into her ass, causing Rose to scream in pleasure. Her walls constricted around the vines, electricity pooling in her lower belly. She was close, so close... The tentacle in her mouth plunged forward suddenly, gagging her and forcing her jaw apart to allow more of it between her lips. The sudden rush of nectar she had to swallow was all it took to send her over the edge. The vines inside her thrusted faster, their nectar mingling with her own fluids as she cried out her orgasm, her formerly limb body arching and spasming uncontrollably. At first her screams still resembled words - a muffled \"Yes!\" or \"More\" and sometimes just a string of pleadings - but the longer her climax lasted, the more her cries turned into incoherent curses and sounds. All the while the vines inside her never stopped fucking her, coordinating their thrusts so that her hips would be pushed up at first - when the single vine thrusted upwards into her ass - and directly afterwards down - when the duo inside her cunt reclaimed the place between her folds. At this point she didn't have the strength to hold herself steady anymore, so she simply let her pelvis be thrown up and down like a toy, still relishing in the high of her orgasm. Finally, their movements stopped as they spilled more of their nectar into her, probably their version of a climax. The heat spreading in her womb and ass send her into a new orgasm before she even had the chance to cope with her last. This time her vision failed and everything around her blurred into a mixture of gold, pink and green as she panted and moaned against the tentacle between her lips. The vines fucking her cunt and rear picked up a slower pace, obviously still not content with the number of orgasms they had drawn from her, but less relentless in their thrusting. Instead of keeping the focus on her lower half, the plant raised two new tentacles from the mess of vines below her. These ones weren't covered in nectar, but each wore a small bud at its tip that bloomed into flowers, similar to the glowing golden one above her face. Just that those were neither as lush as the single one, nor were they radiating this captivating light. They had four petals respectively, thick, broad and a little curved. Instead of pistils or something similar there was a mound in the middle, just big enough for... \"Ah, aaaah\", she moaned as the flowers lowered themselves on her breasts, the mounds latching onto her nipples while the petals closed themselves around her skin, clinging tightly to the curves of her tits. A shudder went through the tentacles. The next thing she knew was that she was screaming herself hoarse as a sudden bolt of pleasure ran through her body when the tentacles started sucking at her nipples. The fleshy petals contracted and loosened around her breasts rhythmically, making her pant and moan with pleasure as the vines in her cunt sped up again. Something was dripping down her chest, and she wondered remotely if she was lactating, but her mind went blank again when a third orgasm tore through her trashing body. A blissful grin on her lips and covered in nectar and cum, Rose was lowered into the writhing vines below her, too exhausted to move or protest. Now that she had been pleasured silly, the plant seemed to focus on its own goals. She was no longer held at her hands and feet - not that she would've been able to escape if she had wanted to - instead the whole amount of green appendages began to entangle themselves with her still spasming limbs. The tentacle in her mouth had vanished, instead two vines began fucking her mouth while those in her cunt were replaced by four thinner vines. She would have vocalized her ecstasy if she could have remembered how to use her voice. Two more vines joined the one in her ass until there was no more room for others, causing them to resort to coil around her waist and pump back and forth between her breasts. With every orgasm they reached they pumped more nectar inside her, until her womb was so full it formed a visible bump. She couldn't remember how many more times she had cum, but she couldn't remember anything else either so it was probably fine. No longer able to tell where her own body ended and the plant began, she dimly noticed the vines retreating until she was once again basked in the golden shine of the flower. Whispers filled her blank mind, forming words, forming orders that engraved themselves deep into her soul. You will return to your home. \"...will return... home...\", she mumbled indistinctly. You will tell no one of this place......You will be around other humans......You will come here again tonight. Yes, of course she would... how could she not, now that she knew what pleasures would await her... You will forget you have been told this. When Rose awoke, it was almost noon. Her muscles were stiff and aching, her skin covered in fluids she could not name and her insides felt painfully empty. She didn't bother worrying about it; she had done that enough already yesterday. So instead of second guessing her motivations, she went downstairs, chugged an entire two liter bottle of water, searched for the box of sex toys she had hidden somewhere in the house and went down to the pool. How it was possible to be this warm at 11 a.m. was beyond her, so the water was refreshingly cool. The mixture of exhaustion and arousal she seemed to be trapped in made her blindly grab what turned out to be a vibro egg, which led to a lot of confusion as she tried to turn it on. Groaning she slipped it inside her - for some reason she was already incredibly wet - and began to search for the remote control. When she finally found it, she set it to a medium level and sighed as the vibrations kicked in. Too tired to really do anything she put the remote back in the box and rested her arms and head on the rim of the pool, whilst letting her body float. For about five minutes, she was completely content. Then it all went south really quickly. \"Rose? Hey, Rose! Are you at home?\", Cherry's voice asked from somewhere behind the fence. Oh fuck. Fuck fuck fuck. Panicking she started to search for the small remote, but it had somehow slipped to the bottom of the box and she just couldn't find it. Blindly she grabbed around while Cherry's voice got closer and closer. There! That felt like it. She just had to get a better grip on it and- \"Ngh!\", she moaned as she accidentally pushed a button, the vibrations suddenly increasing. Her grip on the remote failed and the arm she used to steady herself gave in at the sudden wave of pleasure, with a splash she fell back into the pool. \"Oh, there you are!\", Cherry exclaimed and stepped up from behind the building. In a last desperate attempt to save the situation she pushed the box under the nearest daybed, hid her nakedness behind the curtain of her hair and the wall of the pool, and tried to look innocent. Ignoring the still slowly increasing vibrations inside her would be difficult, but if she focused on something mundane it had to work. Cherry, completely oblivious and wearing a pink bikini that was definitely to small for Rose's current state, waved and approached her with a smile. \"Hi! I'm sorry if I'm surprising you, I called you like, six times but I think your phone was turned off.\" That or Rose had simply been ignoring anything outside of her own body. \"Oh no, no, it's fine!\" Nothing suspicious going on... \"You said we could come over if it's too hot, and well... it really is.\" Wait, we? \"Is, uh... Is Selina with you?\" Cherry shook her head. \"Nah, she's still working.\" It was probably better that way. She couldn't imagine it would be helpful to have Selina in front of her while she was trying not to let on she had a fucking vibrator inside her cunt. The realization hit her like a train. She was naked in her pool, masturbating, while another girl in a very tight bikini was watching her. Fuck, she thought as her walls clenched around the toy, think of something else, anything else! \"Are you okay?\", Cherry asked, kneeling down to her and unknowingly giving her a very good view of her chest. Something inside Roses mind snapped and she looked directly into Cherrys eyes. \"Yes, I'm fine.\", she said with a calmness she had not expected. \"Why don't you come in?\" Wait, what? Was she crazy?! Something seemed to happen with Cherry, for her eyes suddenly glazed over and her lips opened just a little bit. \"S-sure...\", she mumbled almost trancelike. As she climbed in however, the cool water of the pool seemed to shake her out of it. \"Gosh, the water is heavenly! You're so lucky to have a pool- A-are you naked?!\" The memory of soothing golden light flashed behind her eyes and Rose felt something engage inside her mind. Following her intuition she looked Cherry straight into the eyes. \"Don't worry about it. You don't mind.\" That sleepy expression returned to her face and she nodded obediently. She was so close Rose could see her reflection in her eyes... No, that couldn't be. Rose's irises were not really glowing were they? The odd feeling in her spread and drowned that thought out. Suddenly she was painfully aware again that something inside her was vibrating and pulsing and demanding her attention. \"Cherry...\", she heard her own voice say, \"Do you want to know a secret?\" Wait, what was going on with her? She hadn't meant to... to say that... hadn't she? She couldn't think straight as long as she was focusing on not cumming in front of her crush's best friend. The pretty ginger still stared at her yearningly, but managed to nod again. \"I am masturbating right now.\", Rose said with a smile, even tough she couldn't remember when she had decided to say that. All she knew was that she was very, very horny, and Cherry was very, very pretty. Said girl blinked slowly. \"Oh...?\" \"Yes. There's a vibrator inside me. A very big one, and it's been on the whole time.\" Cherrys breath quickened a little and Rose spoke on: \"Can you imagine that? While you were talking to me, I was secretly masturbating with a really big vibro egg. Here, I'll show you!\" Without questioning herself she grabbed Cherrys hand and pulled it down to her slit. Her skin was warm and soft as she pressed her fingers onto her cunt so she could feel the vibrations. Cherry whimpered. Rose smiled. \"I'm going to fuck you.\" Cherry blinked, the glassy sheen on her eyes fading a little. \"A-Are you sure...?\" She concentrated and felt her eyes light up with a golden shine. \"Yes. And I'm very sure that's what you want, too.\" Not that she particularly cared. Anger boiled in her lower belly, mixing with her arousal. She had been in the middle of something when Cherry'd come barging in, not only interrupting her but also using the excuse of an invitation she had meant for Selina, not her cute but boring best friend. She wanted compensation. So she lowered her voice and spoke directly into the gingers mind. \"That's what you came here for, after all. That's why you keep bothering me when I'm talking to Selina, isn't it? You want to be fucked so very badly you've been wet since the moment you decided to visit me.\" Cherrys hand clasped down on Roses cunt, twitching with the sudden change in her body. Through the fabric of her bikini she could see her nipples stiffen. \"...yes...Yes!\", she breathed hoarsely, \"I-I want... want to be fucked...\" Rose smile turned into a malicious grin before she leaned forward and pressed her lips onto Cherrys. The younger girl sighed and gasped, but that weren't the sounds Rose wanted to her from her. She bit down on Cherrys lower lip until she was moaning and wailing in her arms. Much better. \"...what... are you doing?\", she asked breathlessly when Rose pulled back, noticing the strand of saliva connecting their lips had a pinkish color. Like... nectar. Determined she pushed Cherry up on the rim of the pool. \"You'll see\" was the terse retort. With a few quick movements she had undone the knots of her bikini and Cherry was as naked as she was. For a moment, Rose just leaned back and enjoyed the view. Next to Selina, Cherry might be invisible, but she still was a beauty of her own. Slender, delicate, with small firm breasts and unblemished skin. She was breathing fast and her eyes were glazed over, but Rose couldn't help but feel unsatisfied. She wanted to hear her scream, to see her lose every little bit of control she might still have if her body. And she wanted her punished, for that damn interruption. Determined she leaned over the rim and grabbed the box she had so hastily hidden. No longer willing to turn the toy inside her off, she ignored the remote control and instead reached for something else. A unicum called \"The Screw\", something fashioned for her alone, and something she usually didn't use until she was really worked up. The long toy was light blue, only slickly thinner than her forearm and its silicone as soft as it was firm. It was shaped like a long angular cylinder with a quadratic base, the sides carved in to make the edges more protruding. The first time she'd seen it, she thought it looked similar to a weirdly angular screw, since the carved-in sides spiraled around the toy to its top. The second thing she grabbed was more simple: a small vibrating plug. If she wanted to see Cherry lose her mind, that was exactly the right combo. \"On your stomach\", she ordered the ginger, but noticed her eyes were losing the glassy shine the longer she was distracted. \"I... I'm not sure I want to do that...\", she mumbled and Rose sighed. \"Of course you do.\", she stated matter of fact and pushed herself out of the water. A quick stroke over her dripping cunt confirmed her suspicion: just like her saliva, the other bodily fluids had taken on a pink color, like the nectar from her dreams. It's effect was hopefully the same... \"I'm fact...\", Rose said, lifting the finger covered in her juices, \"It's the only thing you ever wanted.\" Gently she let a little pink drop fall onto Cherry's lips and watched how her tongue reflexively darted out to swipe it away. Her eyes went wide and with a gasp she closed her lips around Roses finger, desperately sucking the aphrodisiac off her skin. \"See?\", Rose mocked her smugly while her new plaything licked her clean. \"More\", the girl whimpered pathetically, \"please, more, I need more...\" Well... she could be generous. Placing the toys on the side for later she kneeled over Cherry, legs spread to either side of her head. \"If you insist...\", she agreed, slowly lowering herself onto Cherry's mouth. The ginger didn't lose any time and immediately began sucking on her vibrating flesh. Rose moaned. Cherry might not be particularly skilled or experienced, but the frenzy in which she was working her cunt easily made up for that. That, and the toy still vibrating inside her made it impossible to last long. When she came, pink aphrodisiac gushing over Cherry's face, she had almost forgotten the grudge she held against her. Almost. Sliding off of her, she grabbed the toys and let herself fall back into the pool. Cherry was breathing hard, completely intoxicated by the rush of nectar she'd just swallowed. When Rose repeated her earlier command to turn onto her stomach, she obeyed eagerly. Satisfied Rose pulled her closer until Cherry's dripping slit hovered over the end of the pool, knees spread as far as possible and her ass high in the air. \"R-Rose\", she moaned. \"Please...\" Rose smiled, coating The Screw in her own pink cum before positioning it at Cherry's entrance. \"As you wish.\" Her scream was sweet in Roses ears when she rammed the toy deep into her wet cunt. Cherrys hands tightened to fists and she threw her head back, body arching and walls clenching around the very thick toy. \"Too... ah!\", she moaned. \"Too much! I can't- AH!\" Rose cut her off by pressing the already vibrating tip of the small plug to the puckered skin between her cheeks. Slowly, in order to keep her distracted and unable to speak, she eased the plug into her asshole, eliciting moan after moan from Cherry. When it finally popped into place, Cherry went completely rigid, screaming as her cunt convulsed around The Screw and cum dropped down her thighs. Rose waited patiently until the ginger stopped twitching and caught her breath. \"How do you feel, Cherry?\" The ginger made a hoarse sound. \"Do you feel good?\" She nodded and Rose' face grew serious. \"Because I don't.\" With a flick she turned The Screw on and watched Cherry scream when its tip began rotating inside of her, vibrations on the highest level. The ginger collapsed onto the wooden tiles around the pool, halfheartedly trying to pull back or at least get a hold of the toy Rose was firmly keeping in place. \"Look, I'm not saying I don't enjoy your company.\", she said in a casual tone, ignoring the way Cherry tried to speak through her cries of pleasure. \"But I was quite happy by myself, you know? And then you showed up, on an invitation clearly meant for Selina... Do you see why I am a little dissatisfied right now?\" Cherry had begun to grind her hips against the floor, her eyes were rolling back and her breasts squeezed beneath her. She opened her mouth to answer, but it turned into a long, throaty moan instead. Rose smiled. \"So, Cherry... how would you like to repay me?\" It was unclear if she just still wasn't able to answer, or if she was so far gone now her mind couldn't comprehend the question anymore. \"Would it help if I turned this off?\", Rose asked with faux innocence and pulled The Screw out a few centimeters. \"Plea- Ah, AAAAAH! -se, yes, yes, fuck\", Cherry blabbered, her body however never stopped to impale itself on the toy, clenching down on it and rolling her hips. It was clear she had no control over her movements by now, was running entirely on lust and instinct. \"I'm not sure... You seem really enthusiastic right now, don't you?\" \"N- OOOOOOH, oh, mmmmmh, please, out, OUT! Too... ah... too much.\" \"If you insist...\" Slowly, slowly she pulled the Screw back another centimeters, then another. Just one more and the wildly rotating tip would press exactly on her G-spot... \"Ah, FUCK, FUCK, ROSE, PLEASE- Aaaaah, god, hng...\" Her body was trashing, her hips grinding against the floor so hard Rose was afraid she would break something. With a shudder of arousal she watched her throw her head back and scream a scream so loud they might still hear it in town. Her rosy folds were dripping around the Screw and Rose thrusted it back into her cunt, making Cherry howl and curse. It was kind of beautiful, actually, the way her thighs trembled on both sides of her stomach, no longer strong enough to hold her ass up, but still trying to buck it against the toy she didn't want but so desperately needed. Rose kept up the delicious torture until Cherry collapsed, gasping for air and grinning insanely. Her eyes were half closed and glazed over with a haze of pleasure. Rose sighed. \"You are really distracting, you know? Where was I... Ah, yes.\" She pushed herself out of the water and leaned forwards until her mouth hovered directly over Cherry's ear. \"What will you do to repay me?\" The ginger turned her head a little so she could look at her. \"Anything\", she breathed. \"Everything. Whatever you want...\" Rose, relishing in the supernatural control she had over her, pressed her own, pink-cum-dripping cunt against the base of The Screw jutting out between Cherrys folds. \"How about I'll show you what I want?\" It was past seven p.m. when they arrived at the cafe. They hadn't been able to go by bicycle for... certain reasons, and they had gone off late too. The whole afternoon had been spent testing her control of Cherry, which turned out to be her new favorite activity. After the ginger had recovered from The Screw, Rose had gone inside to get something to drink, ordering Cherry to find the most absurd method to pleasure herself while she was away. She had come back to the view of Cherry impaling her cunt on the polished stone digits of one of these modern art sculptures the architect had placed in the garden. Her knees had shaken from all the squats necessary to get the friction she needed, but she had been relentless, her head thrown back, tongue out. After that, she had wanted to test the psychic limits of her spell, so she'd ordered Cherry to choose as many toys from the box as she could fit inside her body, then to fuck herself senseless - without cumming. After three hours the sight of her - thrusting a vibrator even thicker than The Screw into her cunt, a cord of anal beads hanging out her ass and grinding against a Lay On beneath her clit - had moved her to have mercy and she'd allowed her to cum. The following orgasm had lasted about twenty minutes and been full of screaming, moaning and cursing. When her body had finally calmed down, she'd been hoarse, sore and as submissive as a little puppy. The overdose of pleasure had done something to her, for every time she looked at Rose it was full of reverence, admiration, awe even, as if she was something godly. So here they were now, at the cafe, waiting for Selina to show up. Cherry with a vibro-egg on standby in her cunt, Rose with the fitting app opened on her phone. She was still a little salty about her unannounced visit. \"Hey guys!\", Selina greeted them when she came over. \"You're late!\" \"Yes, we were working out pretty long.\", Rose lied without batting an eye. Cherry nodded. \"You should've come along, Selina, it was so much fun!\" Good girl, Rose thought and tipped \"On\" on her phone. Cherry jumped a little, but relaxed immediately, not wanting to give herself away. The black haired beauty sighed. \"I wanted to, but I've been so busy around here. It's the only cafe with air conditioning in town, you know?\" \"Poor you\", Cherry sympathized. Rose frowned. \"You really need time to relax, Selina. It's not healthy to work that hard.\" Not that she knew a lot about working hard. \"Why don't you and Cherry stay overnight at my place? We could watch movies, eat snacks, have fun...\" Selina rubbed her eyes. \"That sounds wonderful, but I'm really tired. I would probably just bore you.\" Deciding it was time to test her new abilities, Rose pouted and felt her eyes light up. Her vision was tinted just a tiny little bit golden now, confirming that it worked. \"Aw, no way. Come along, Selina.\" She sighed. \"Sorry, I really can't.\" Wait, what?! \"Oh, and maybe you should go to bed early too. Your eyes look a little funny, not that you get sick.\" Selina got up and walked back to the bar. \"See you later, guys!\" Confused and angry Rose turned to Cherry, who was breathing a little heavier and rocked her hips against the bench from time to time. \"Cum\", Rose ordered and Cherry immediately bit her lip, squealed and sighed quietly. A little stain appeared on her borrowed skirt. Rose was at a loss. Why did it work with Cherry, but not with Selina? At home, Rose skipped going to bed, grabbed Cherry's arm and immediately went down to the cave. The ginger asked no questions, which just frustrated her further. Why would she be able to seduce Cherry, the cute but boring Best Friend, but not the stunning beauty Selina? It didn't make sense! \"Wait here\", she told her new plaything. She was not really willing to let her see how she surrendered to that plant. \"When I come back, bring me home and I'll consider fucking you again tomorrow. Understood?\" Cherry shuddered in arousal and nodded. \"Good\" Turning the vibro-egg to the highest setting and enjoying Cherry's abrupt gasps and moans, Rose left her behind and walked down the tunnel. When she finally reached her destination, she shed her clothes in seconds and let the vines welcome her. Something was different in that third night. Maybe they knew how she had turned Cherry into her toy and wanted her to remember her place. Or maybe they simply were eager to see her again. Anyway, they were viscous tonight, ravaging her body without bothering to use the flowers glow. She was thrown around like a doll, pushed against the wall, impaled on so many vines she felt like the whole plant was fucking her cunt. Her breasts were already being nursed by these celestial four-petal-flowers, her ass cheeks spread by two thicker vines, while an third thrusted into her hole. She came again and again, but that didn't seem to satisfy them. After at least six hours they laid her on the ground, face down, breasts pleasured sore rubbing against the floor and knees forced to hold her ass up high in the air. The single vine that entered her cunt was thick, firm and textured, eliciting low moans from her just by being inside her. When it finally began moving, it didn't take long before she convulsed around it. The orgasm was ground-shaking, and it took her a few moments to realize the ground was actually shaking. She wanted to get up, seek shelter somewhere with no ceiling threatening to come down on her, but the vines threw her to the ground and a hard thrust into her cunt immobilized her again. Cracks tore through the rocky floor and she whimpered. She wanted to scream, wanted to run, but oh, she never wanted to lose this feeling of fullness. As long as the vines kept fucking her, everything would be alright. She knew it. Something lush and green broke through the cracks, a bud twice as big as herself, vines and leaves sprouting everywhere around it. When the ground stopped shaking, it almost reached the ceiling. The vines inside her had stopped moving for some reason, as if in awe of what was happening. They twitched slightly when the bud bloomed and revealed its insides. \"Ah, finally!\", a melodic voice exclaimed. \"It's been centuries since I've last really breathed.\" A woman appeared between the golden petals and Rose gasped for air. The word \"woman\" didn't do her justice. Her skin was dark and saturated, her eyes as green as a rainforest after a shower. Her dark brown hair looked like the softest velvet and flowers of all kinds bloomed between the strands. She was naked and proudly stepped out of her cocoon, her full breasts putting even Selina to shame. No, she was no woman. She was a goddess. \"Persephone's my name, in case you wondered.\", she spoke in her teasingly beautiful voice. \"And you must be my little Rose.\" She needed a moment to remember that this was indeed her name. Unable to speak since her mouth had run dry, she simply nodded. Persephone smiled. \"I owe you my sincerest thanks, my sweet Rose. Without you, I'd still be trapped down there.\" She came closer, running her fingers over the vines holding Rose. \"I am sure you have a lot of questions. As my first adherent in this century, you may ask me anything.\" \"I...\", Rose breathed, voice breaking. She swallowed. \"You are... so b-beautiful.\" Her smile widened and she ran her hand through Roses hair, who whined at the sweet touch. \"Yes, I hear that often. Though it's been a while. It's pretty lonely in the underground.\" She sighed. \"I understand if it takes you some time to process this, your mortal minds are... feeble. How about I just explain to you what you need to know?\" Leaning into her touch, Rose nodded. \"Hm, Let's see... Firstly, and most importantly, you have the honor of being my adherent. That means you belong to me; body, soul and mind. Do you understand that, Rose?\" Another nod. \"Wonderful! I think you already know my name from stories, but to make sure, I'll introduce myself: I am Persephone of Nysa, daughter of Demeter, Goddess of Greenery and Flowers as well as involuntary Queen of the Underworld. Once powerful and worshipped, but deceived and trapped in a prison of cold, dead rock. \"The lovely plant you got to know is my servant, my lifeline. It allowed me to feed on your spirit, or more exactly, your... affection.\" Rose blushed, suddenly aware that she laid in the dirt in front of her goddess, a vine in her cunt and four more chaining her to the ground. \"Oh, don't worry.\", Persephone hushed her when she tried to regain her dignity. \"I don't mind. In fact, I rather like you in that position.\" Immediately Rose froze. If her goddess liked her on the ground, she'd crawl in the dirt as long as Persephone wanted her to. \"The thing is, Rose, even though I am a goddess, I am not flawless. In order to regain my power and glory I need adherents. I need you, my beloved Rose.\" She snapped her fingers and the vine in her cunt started moving again, this time in slow, caressing thrusts. Rose moaned. \"You are a particularly strong spirit.\", Persephone continued. \"A rare gem. That's why you were so defensive the first time you met my servant. But that also means that once you were mine, you'd give me far more power than a weaker spirit, like that cute Cherry. My servant has transferred my blessing and orders to you, and in return it drew power from your lust and read your mind. It's a fair exchange, you see?\" \"Yes\", she breathed, eyes falling shut from the sweet pleasure the vine gave her. \"Yes... but...\" \"But?\" \"I seduced Cherry. I wanted her, so... oh... so I did something... with my eyes...\" \"Oh, that. Well, I'm a very generous goddess. I love all my adherents, but I have my favorites, whom I grant little gifts. Since you are my servant too, I saw it fitting to give you the same little tricks my other servant is capable of. Besides, I knew you would use it for good. And - without knowing it yet - you did! The more pleasure you drew from that girl, the more power you gained. And that power is what my servant took from you, what I am taking from you now.\" The vine changed the angle of its thrust and curved itself around her clit, sending electricity through her veins until she screamed and spasmed. After she collapsed, Persephone gently caressed her face. \"Ah, my lovely Rose, you are beautiful in that state.\", she sighed. \"However...\" \"However what?\", Rose uttered between her gasps for air. Was something wrong with her? Persephone brushed her thumb over Roses lower lip, making her tremble. \"Now that I am free, Rose, I want compensation for my time in exile. I want my former glory back, my temples, my servants and sacrifices. And in order to achieve that, I need your help.\" \"I'll do anything!\", Rose affirmed immediately. \"Whatever you want me to do.\" \"Oh honey, I believe you! I just don't think you are capable of doing what I need you to do. Not yet.\" Dismayed Rose looked down. If she was no use to her goddess... if she disappointed her, she would never forgive herself. \"Don't make that face, my love. There is still hope.\" Rose looked up again. Persephones beautiful face was thoughtful, her eyes looking at the plant behind Rose. \"What I need you to do is to collect more power for me, Rose. Not from your ginger friend or the likes of her, but from people with spirits like yours. From people that don't succumb from just a look at your pretty eyes.\" \"Like Selina\", Rose whispered and her goddess nodded. \"Like that Selina. I need you to be able to... convince her of following me. To make her give every ounce of strength in her body to you, so you can transfer it to me.\" \"But how can I do that if she's a... \"strong spirit\"?\" Persephone snapped her fingers again to make the vines let go of her and Rose fell on her butt, not able of holding herself up. Her goddess kneeled between her legs, putting a finger on her chest. Rose gasped. \"I will make you my priestess, Rose.\", she said lowly and carefully dragged her finger downwards. \"I will change you, turn you into something more powerful... by giving you your own servant. I will put it right... here.\" Her Finger stopped on her lower abdomen. \"And it will grant you strength. And a lot of pleasurable options, if you are creative enough. That will make you special among my adherents, and it will be a prove of your eternal commitment to me. How would you like that, Rose?\" She was still watching Persephone's finger on her skin, but upon hearing her name her head snapped up. \"Very much, my goddess. I won't disappoint you, I promise!\" \"I know, my love.\", Persephone said and stood up. A gesture of her hand made the giant bud in the middle of the room transform, turn from a simple flower to something that looked like throne: one long petal formed the backrest, one folded itself into a seat and two more created the armrests. The sepals formed stairs leading up the the throne. Once Persephone had taken her seat, she had perfect view of her new adherent - and the plant behind said adherent. \"My dear Rose,\" she spoke ceremonially, \"I, Persephone of Nysa, put my trust in you and declare you my high priestess. Your life will be mine, and my blessing will be yours. You will harvest the love of mortals as my reaper, but your own harvest will be mine to take. No other goddess may command you, for your loyalty is mine. Do you accept?\" Rose didn't bother trying to stand up. Even if she had been strong enough, Persephone liked her on the ground. \"Yes, my goddess.\", she agreed and Persephone smiled. \"Very well. Then my servant shall salve you.\" A snap of her fingers and suddenly the dormant vines came to life, wrapped around her ankles and wrists and pulled her in the air. The already well known flowers closed their petals around her breasts, and a nectar-dripping tentacle pushed into her mouth, but additionally there was a fourth appendage rising. This one had three fleshy, thick petals like the flowers massaging her breasts, but this flower was bigger. And it didn't have a mound in its middle. No, instead it had a thick, long, curved pistil jutting out between its petals. Rose swallowed and the vines around her knee bends and ankles spread her legs, further and further apart until her knees where next to her head. Her cunt was as exposed as it could be when the three-petals-flower finally came closer. The round tip of the pistil pressed against her entrance and Rose gasped around the tentacle in her mouth. Inch by Inch it pushed forwards, slowly and teasingly until she was used to its width. Then it rammed into her with force, the upper petal closing around her abdomen, the lower two latching onto her ass cheeks. A shudder went through the vine, reached its petals and pistil and made Rose cry out in ecstasy. The vibrations on her clit, the sore skin of her ass, inside her were enough to send her over the edge. When her breathing calmed down again, she hesitantly looked at Persephone. The goddess was watching her attentively and snapped her fingers again. Another vine entered her ass, though it was more in order to stabilize her than anything else. Because even though she couldn't take her eyes off Persephone, from the corner of her eye she still noticed the bump traveling up the three-petaled vine. When it reached the beginning of pistil, she could feel the shaft widen, stretching her cunt wide to accommodate its gift. The egg- no the seed was as big as fist and if she weren't so full of aphrodisiac, she might have protested. Instead she raised her hips, rocked against the pistil and threw her head back in ecstasy. Slowly the seed passed her entrance, stretched her walls and finally hit the passage to her womb. And she knew, there was no way this could be comfortable or even just tolerable, but her understanding of pleasure was already so twisted after spending three nights in the plants tight embrace that she couldn't help but cum when the seed was forcefully pushed into her womb. Her whole body arched and she could feel Persephone's burning gaze on her skin when she trashed and shook and grind against the flower. But it wasn't over yet. She had barely recovered from the last one as another fist-sized seed stretched her wide and made her climax again. Her belly felt heavy and full, but there were still more coming. Rose lost count of the number of seeds entering her, all she knew was that Persephone was watching and she needed her to be content. When the last seed entered her, there was a visible bump on her stomach and her breasts felt heavier than before. A satiated sigh escaped her as the petals loosened and the pistil was pulled out of her. Persephone stood up and strode over to her priestess. \"How are you feeling, Rose?\" The brunette moaned in response and Persephone chuckled. \"Sounds good. And don't worry about that,\" she pointed at her swollen belly, \"it will disappear once the seeds have taken root.\" Rose mustered up all her willpower and managed to breath a vague \"How?\". \"Well, the shell will dissolve and leave only the soft sprouts. They need little space once they have connected to your body. Which is what I'm going to initiate now, if you allow, my love?\" She nodded weakly and the vines lowered her until Persephone could lay a hand on her stomach. Her skin was soft and warm... A flash of golden light followed by searing pain tore her out of her reverence. She cried out in surprise, but not even ten seconds later it was all over. \"Shshsh, it's alright. Do you feel better, Rose?\" She was breathing heavy as the vines let go of her, and actually managed to stand on her own feet. \"Yes... yes, I feel... good. Really good, my goddess.\" Persephone beamed. \"Wonderful! Then there's only one thing left to do...\" Her smile turned serious. \"Bring me Selina.\" (See the end of the chapter for notes.) Here's the link to some art I did of this story, as long as you can still post female presenting nipples on tumblr: https://felicity-the-strange.tumblr.com/post/181026778410 It was around 5 a.m. when Selina unlocked the door of the cafe. Guests or her boss wouldn't arrive before 7 or - more likely - 8, but she needed the time to prepare. Besides, this was the only time of the day she could relax a little. It was still dark outside and she loved how cozy it was in here when the lights were on. The air was still cool enough and she could drink her favorite lemonade without any orders interrupting her peace... \"Huh?\" She clicked the light switch again, but nothing happened. Oh no, please no power failure! Not now, in her rare free time. Maybe it was just the fuse? Yeah, she could hear the fridge hum in the kitchen, so at least it was no complete blackout. Sighing she groped her way towards the fuse box in the back room. Did it smell funny in here? Maybe they had new flowers for the tables. She should talk to her boss about it, this sweet, heady scent might be a little too much for... for... the guests? Right... She shook her head. Maybe she should've slept a little longer. She felt awfully warm and sleepy all of a sudden... not unpleasantly, not really... but very... very... \"Woah!\", she yelled when she tripped over something long and heavy. Something like a chuckle came from the opposite side of the room and Selina froze. \"Hey! Who's there?!\", she snarled into the darkness, but her words were a little slurred. A dim, golden glow illuminated a female silhouette from behind and Selina tensed. \"How rude, Selina.\", a sweet voice answered, a little too hoarse for her to immediately recognize her. \"I stood up so early, just to visit you, and you yell at me.\" \"...Rose? What... what are you doing here?\" Blinking she leaned against a table, trying to clear her head. Something about the dim light and the scent made her dizzy, slowed her movements and thoughts. \"We're still closed.\" \"Oh, I know\", Rose answered and came closer. \"Cherry told me. She told me pretty much everything: when your shift starts, when the first guests arrive, where the fuse box is...\" \"Wait... You broke the lights?\" \"Nah, just disabled them for now. If you put the fuse back in, everything's going to work again.\" \"Yeah, I mean, I know, but... why?\" Rose was directly in front of her now and Selina took a step back until her back bumped against the table. Whatever the source of the strange glow was, it hovered directly behind her. \"Well, if the lights were on, people could see through the windows in here. And I don't think that's in your interest.\" She frowned, trying to keep up with her words, but her body was too distracting. Her breathing had quickened the closer Rose had come, and her breasts felt uncomfortably heavy. Heat pooled in her lower abdomen and made her twitch when Rose placed her hands on either side of the table, trapping her between her warm body and the cool table. Something coiled itself around her leg. \"Rose... wait, are you naked?\" As if it had waited for her question, the mysterious light source rose over Rose' head and illuminated the scene completely. The brunette was indeed naked, the tanned skin of her breasts glistening in the sensual glow and her nipples stiffened. And below that... Selina blinked, sure that this must be a mistake. From in between Rose's pink folds sprouted several thick, green tentacle-esque tendrils. One of the appendages had wrapped itself around her leg, another held the golden light and a third one rose up to the height of her face, dripping with pink nectar. She blinked, waiting for it to disappear - futilely. Then she screamed. Faster than a snakes bite it thrust into her mouth, choking down her voice in her throat as even more vines wrapped around her limbs; lifting her on the table and spreading her legs in one swift movement. \"You might be a little distressed now\", Rose whispered into her ear, her voice almost feverish. \"But I promise, soon this will be all you'll ever wish for.\" If she had had troubles processing her words before, now they were echoing in her head crystal clearly, drowning out her own thoughts. She gasped for air, her throat clenching down on the tentacle inside and Rose moaned. \"Goddess, I can't wait to fuck your mouth for real. But first...\", she pressed her hand - or was it another vine? - beneath her skirt and against the growing wet stain on her panties, \"I want to see you come apart.\" She whimpered - and she wanted to believe it was out of fear - when her panties were torn to shreds and she could feel Rose caressing her dripping folds. In a desperate attempt to regain control over her body, she bit on the tentacle in her mouth, but it only caused more of this intoxicating sweetness to gush down her throat. \"Nah-ah!\", Rose scolded her. \"Bad girl.\" Without warning the tentacle thrust deeper, pumping the aphrodisiac directly into her stomach and cutting off the air. For a few seconds - or minutes? - her vision turned black, and when it returned, she was lying stark naked on her stomach, bend over the table. The dim light caused the window to reflect what happened behind her, and what she saw made her shudder. She was held in place by four, maybe five tendrils, chained to the table and legs spread enough to expose her cunt. Rose stood behind her, running a hand over Selina's bare ass with half-closed eyes. \"There are two options for me, Selina.\", she all but hummed. \"I could drug and hypnotize you until you are a brainless, lust-ridden puppet like cute little Cherry. It wouldn't take a minute until you would crawl at my feet, begging for my attention. Who knows, maybe I'd make you walk through the entire town masturbating and screaming my name?\" More slick tendrils sneaked beneath her and curled around her breasts as Rose leaned over her. \"But as tempting as that sounds, it's not as satisfying. I've spent so much time thinking of fucking you... I don't want this to be quick, or simple. So...\" Her lips were directly next to her ear and she kept eye contact with Selina through her reflection. \"I will make you beg in a more traditional way. Step one: Suck.\" It took a while, but she managed to shake her head despite the tentacle in her mouth. Rose sighed and began stroking her cunt again, small, teasing movements. Against her will, she gasped and her knees began to tremble. \"Suck my tendril, Selina.\", Rose urged her calmly. \"Be a good girl.\" She couldn't see what happened under the table, but something caressed the tender skin of the inside of her thigh. Another whimper forced itself out of her throat, and this time not even she could pretend it was completely out of disgust, or even fear. The tentacle in her mouth began to swirl around her tongue, gently, lovingly. It's heady sweetness filled her mouth and Selina knew she had to swallow, otherwise she'd go insane with how incredible the nectar tasted. But if she swallowed now, she didn't know if she'd be able to stop. \"Oh come on, Selina. We both know you want to, you just don't dare to admit it.\", Rose mocked, inserting the tip of her finger into her cunt. \"Isn't that right? You are so busy being the golden child, the flawless employee. Admitting you have desires, giving in to them... that idea at once scares and excites you, doesn't it?\" Selina closed her eyes, trying to block out her words and ministrations. \"Let's give you some more ideas, huh? For example... how it would feel if I put my vines into that pretty ass of yours. Two, three at once.\" Her other hand pulled her ass cheeks apart and dipped a fingertip inside her, only just. Selina wailed. \"Or if I put your knees on that table, next to your head so the muscles here\", the vine between her thighs rubbed up and down, \"are stretched to the limit and I can fuck you until you can't walk for weeks.\" Rose smiled. \"I'll do all of that, and more. But first...\" Her fingers thrust into her cunt without warning. \"Suck!\" Startled she swallowed a gulp of aphrodisiac. And another. And another. Defeated she moaned and milked the tentacle with her tongue, bobbing her head back and forth. She couldn't stop, not when her walls started clenching and pulsing, so close to the edge. But just before she could reach it, Rose stopped her ministrations. A pathetically disappointed sound escaped her when she pulled the tentacle out. Why would she work her up like this, just to leave her unsatisfied. Angry she looked at Rose reflection, but what she saw made her face go slack. There was a new tentacle between Rose' legs, this one shorter and thicker than the others, it's tip more blunt. It jutted upwards like a big green cock, fully erect and firm against Rose' hands. Selina swallowed. \"Do you want me to fuck you?\", Rose asked, sensually stroking her length up and down. Selina swallowed again, trying to speak but her voice failed her. God, it was so big. She didn't actually want this inside her, did she? This awfully wide girth spreading her, stretching her, reaching places inside her she didn't even know of... this horrible length lifting her hips from the table every time it thrust into her wet, dripping cunt until it could go no further, until Rose' hips were grinding against hers? This big appendage fucking her to completion? \"Yes\", she breathed defeated, but Rose continued to stroke herself with both hands. \"Ah, ah! Say it.\" A frustrated growl formed in her throat, but the desire to have this long botanic cock inside her was greater than her pride. \"Please, fuck me.\", she pressed out. \"Fuck me, Rose!\" She smiled. \"Good Girl.\" And finally, she rammed it into her waiting cunt, making Selina scream of pleasure. \"God, Rose, Rose, fuck- AH! Ah, mhm.\" The other tendrils began assaulting her ass, like promised three of them thrusting into her at once, while the others kneaded her tits greedily. It felt better than anything her dirtiest fantasies had been able to come up with, the friction between the clenching walls of her cunt and Rose' tentacle cock too good to be real. She gasped and panted when Rose seemed to go deeper every time she plunged her divine appendage back into her, rocking back her hips to meet her thrusts. God, just a little more, just a little... Suddenly Rose stilled and Selina all but sobbed. Why did she leave her hanging again? \"Rose, please, please, I need to... I need...\" \"I know, I know.\" Her free hand began to circle her clit again, keeping her right on the edge. \"But I want you to do something first.\" \"Do what?\" As long as it was quick, she'd do anything. \"To promise me something. When I am done with you, you are mine. You will do as I say without question, and will do so happily. And in return...\", She brushed her clit, making her tremble and quiver beneath her, \"...I'll fuck your brains out. Every day. For hours. In so many ways that there's not a single technique or object you could imagine to not be pleasurable, as long as I'm the one wielding it. Do you want that?\" She was so close, she'd promised her everything as long as she'd get her release. \"Yes! I'm yours, all yours! Please, Rose, make me cum now!\" Rose smiled and pulled her cock almost all the way out. Then, in a single, powerful thrust that lifted her hips from the table she sent her over the edge. Selina opened her mouth to scream, but no sound left her lips as her eyes rolled back in her head and Rose fucked her through her orgasm. When she finally came somewhat down, all it took was another deep thrust and something hot filling her up to make her climax again. She heard herself scream and moan and talk weird nonsense until Rose pulled back and she could catch her breath. \"How do you feel, Selina?\", Rose asked and pressed little kisses to the base of her spine. Selina hummed, tenderly licking at the tentacle next to her face. \"Good\", Rose chuckled, \"Because I want you to meet someone... later.\" With the help of her appendages she turned Selina around so they were face to face. \"For now, I think we should use the rest of our time, huh?\" Selina simply smiled and spread her legs even wider when Rose started thrusting again, sighing in her bliss. The last chapter was somewhat hurried, I was kinda tired of this story and wanted to finish it. But hey, I did some art! I take commissions from time to time, if you're interested.

      "What if she would never see it again?",
      "No, she had to look at it... nothing was more important...",
      "She was so distracted by the beautiful light that she didn't notice the vines at her hips until one shot forwards and pushed its tip inside her asshole.",
      "She gasped, her lips parting in shock, and the tendril at her lips plunged inside her mouth.",
      "She tried to pull her head back, she really did, but the tendril had her neck and head in its firm grasp and immediately started thrusting back and forth inside her mouth, rubbing against her tongue.",
      "And oh, oh, the pink goo was intoxicating.",
      "Her lips closed around the tendril on their own accord, her tongue stroking up and down its skin.",
      "It wasn't as smooth as thought, a little textured actually, but it was full of this pink sweetness and she wanted more.",
      "She sucked with abandon as the rich taste drowned out every thought on her mind and she went limp in the vines' embrace.",
      "She wanted to be here forever, she realized as the flower captivated her gaze again.",
      "She wanted to suck at the tendrils, to watch the beautiful flower, to let them do everything they wanted to her... forever.",
      "With a gasp, Rose jolted awake.",
      "Confused she looked around in her room.",
      "What... what had happened?",
      "Where was the cave, the strange plant...?",
      "\"Oh my god...\" That hadn't been real, right?",
      "It was a dream, a nightmare, nothing more.",
      "Right?",
      "Her memory was incomplete somehow, tinted in pink lights and a haze of lust.",
      "She remembered a flower... and the strong embrace of dozens of vines, touching her...",
      "Rose own moan shook her out of her trance and she realized she was touching herself.",
      "Nononono, no, that couldn't have been real.",
      "She must have passed out from the heat, dreamed a lot of weird stuff, walked back home and immediately fallen asleep again.",
      "Another moan reminded her she still hadn't stopped touching herself and she mobilized all her willpower to rip her hand away.",
      "This was definitely not normal.",
      "Panicking she jumped out of her bed and practically ran into the shower, scrubbing the sweat off her skin until it was red.",
      "She didn't even dry her hair before she got dressed and took her bike.",
      "She didn't want to think about how she had acted yeste- in that dream, she had to distract herself.",
      "And what was more distracting than Selina Hernandez?",
      "The way to town that usually took her half an hour passed in 15 minutes today.",
      "By the time she reached the cafe Selina worked at, she was out of breath and just as sweaty as she'd been this morning.",
      "\"Hey, Rose!\", Selina's best friend, Cherry, greeted her when she stepped in.",
      "She was a year younger than Selina and almost a foot shorter, all bouncy happiness and red, curly hair.",
      "She was cute, but when Selina entered the room she was all but forgotten.",
      "Selina was gorgeous.",
      "She was elegant, she was graceful, she was pretty.",
      "Long black hair, skin like bronze and dark eyes that made Rose melt like chocolate.",
      "She waved at Rose before taking a guest's order.",
      "Already in ninth heaven, Rose sat down next to Cherry, who immediately began chattering about some minor matters.",
      "The heat, the locals, food... whatever.",
      "\"Rose, hi!\", Selina greeted her when she finally came to their table.",
      "\"What's up?\" Rose blushed and felt the memories of her dream fade far into the background.",
      "\"The temperature, that's what.\"",
      "She replied, trying to distract from the fact her face was bright red.",
      "\"I am melting!\"",
      "Selina laughed.",
      "\"I feel you.",
      "I mean, I am used to this heat but even for me it's extreme.",
      "And you've been here for just two weeks, so...\" \"You can always just come to the mansion, you know?",
      "We've got a pool, parasols, air conditioning... it's just boring all alone.\"",
      "\"Huh?\", Selina said, distracted by a call from another table.",
      "\"Sorry, I gotta get back to work.",
      "See you later!\"",
      "And off she went.",
      "\"We'd love to come!\", she heard Cherry say, but Roses attention was focused solely on Selina, who took the other guests order with a winning smile.",
      "Why couldn't she have just a little more time with her?",
      "Just a few hours with her, and her alone.",
      "Sighing Rose turned back to Cherry.",
      "Maybe she could tell Selina- Huh?",
      "Suddenly she found herself eye-to-eye with the cute redhead, who had come a whole lot closer.",
      "Her light brown eyes were glassy and her pupils dilated, as if in trance.",
      "Her face was very, very close to her own.",
      "\"Uh...",
      "Cherry?\", Rose asked confused.",
      "Immediately Cherry blinked and snapped back.",
      "\"Oh, uh, sorry!",
      "That was awkward, it's just that...\" She blushed and looked away.",
      "\"Y-You smell good.",
      "Flowery.",
      "Did you get a new shampoo or something?\" Rose shifted uncomfortably.",
      "\"Uh...",
      "yes... something like that.\"",
      "Rose couldn't sleep that night.",
      "Despite air conditioning, she was sweating and breathing hard, as if she had just ran a marathon.",
      "Tossing and turning in her sheets she forced her eyes closed and once again tried to calm down, but it was no use.",
      "Her skin itched and her pajama felt too tight on her skin.",
      "Her mind was hazy and flashes of beautiful golden light filled her thoughts, making her breath and breasts heavy.",
      "Heat pooled between her thighs as imaginary fingers sneaked their way up to her cunt.",
      "Rose moaned.",
      "Finally, it became to much and her hand pressed against one of her tits.",
      "Her nipple was hard, so hard, and in her mind she saw Selina curl her lips around it.",
      "A gasp escaped her and her free hand snapped to her bedside table.",
      "Blind she opened the drawer and searched for the toy she kept in there.",
      "A sigh left her lips when she finally felt it slip between her folds, firm and hard and enough to imagine Selina holding it, Selina thrusting it into her wet, waiting cunt...",
      "She wailed and sped her movements up, rocking against her hands as she fucked herself.",
      "How would Selina's moans sound?",
      "Faster.",
      "Surely she would be loud, loud and viscous.",
      "Harder.",
      "She would have her pinned beneath her, begging for her touch and be happy to give it.",
      "More.",
      "She would thrust her fingers into her cunt, would suck her nipples sore, all while being tinted in golden light and fucked by dozens of green vines herself...",
      "Before she could fully understand where that thought had come from, the image send her over the edge and her mind lost focus.",
      "So caught up in her ecstasy, she didn't realize she had gotten out of bed and left the house.",
      "She was still drifting off into her sweet fantasy of Selina, not noticing that she was walking through the forest, stark naked and cum leaking down her thigh.",
      "When she reached the cave, passed the tunnel and arrived at the underground cavern, all she saw in front of her were Selina's lips, Selina's breasts, Selina's thighs trembling from desire.",
      "The soft touch on her legs didn't worry her, it felt good, right even.",
      "The vines sneaking up her legs felt good too, like she was meant to be here.",
      "Her clit, hypersensitive from her last orgasm, sent bolts of pleasure through her when the green tentacles rubbed themselves against it.",
      "It was the sound of her own moan that made her open her eyes in surprise again.",
      "Wait.",
      "What was she doing here?",
      "Why the hell was she-",
      "The vines that had stroked her limbs tightened all of a sudden, as if sensing that her trance faded.",
      "She had no chance to really wake up before something slick pressed against her lips and her mouth was filled with sweet, sweet nectar.",
      "She moaned and closed her eyes as the memories of their last encounter returned.",
      "Orgasm after orgasm the tentacles had drawn from her, pumping into her cunt until she was mad with pleasure.",
      "She had screamed for more, begged to be touched everywhere until her whole body was coated in the plants pink juice.",
      "And now she wanted it again.",
      "She didn't fight it when they pulled her closer to their core, to their origin and to the giant bud towering over them.",
      "Golden light basked her as it bloomed and Rose grinned blissfully around the tentacle in her mouth.",
      "The vines stroked her in appreciation and sneaked closer to her hips, pushing her limp legs apart as if she were a doll.",
      "A muffled \"Yes!\", left her mouth as the first one pushed against her dripping folds and she bucked her hips, hoping it would finally enter her.",
      "But now that she was completely theirs, the vines apparently wanted to take their time, make her wait.",
      "The vine at her cunt had begun to rub itself against her entrance and applied delicious pressure, without actually pushing deeper.",
      "Desperately she tried to press her hips against it, but the other vines held her back.",
      "The firm grip tightened the longer she struggled, rewarding her for her eagerness by coating her in their nectar, but punishing her for her disobedience by neglecting her sex.",
      "Finally she gave up, resorting to pleading instead and sucked tenderly on the tentacle in her mouth.",
      "Her hands, trapped somewhere beneath her in a mass of writhing green, each grabbed a thick vine and stroked it up and down, up and down, coating her fingers in their nectar.",
      "It seemed to work: the vines collectively shuddered and the one at her cunt took mercy on her, plunging into her with a force that made her gasp.",
      "Encouraged by her obvious approval, it moved inside her, snaking its way deeper into her vagina and coating her insides in the pink aphrodisiac.",
      "She moaned and pumped the vines in her hands faster, though her movements lost their rhythm when a second vine joined the one in her cunt and began swirling around.",
      "If the tentacle in her mouth hadn't held her steady, her head would have hit the ground when the muscles of her neck failed.",
      "Not stopping with their vicious thrusting, the vines lifted her higher until she hang limb in their embrace, her knees at the height of her head and her legs spread.",
      "\"More\", she mumbled against the sweet tentacle, \"Please, more\" Generously, another vine spiraled up her leg and made a beeline for her hips, this time the backside.",
      "Thickly lubricated with its slick, pink goo, it didn't waste time with letting her adjust.",
      "Instead it forcefully rammed into her ass, causing Rose to scream in pleasure.",
      "Her walls constricted around the vines, electricity pooling in her lower belly.",
      "She was close, so close...",
      "The tentacle in her mouth plunged forward suddenly, gagging her and forcing her jaw apart to allow more of it between her lips.",
      "The sudden rush of nectar she had to swallow was all it took to send her over the edge.",
      "The vines inside her thrusted faster, their nectar mingling with her own fluids as she cried out her orgasm, her formerly limb body arching and spasming uncontrollably.",
      "At first her screams still resembled words - a muffled \"Yes!\"",
      "or \"More\" and sometimes just a string of pleadings - but the longer her climax lasted, the more her cries turned into incoherent curses and sounds.",
      "All the while the vines inside her never stopped fucking her, coordinating their thrusts so that her hips would be pushed up at first - when the single vine thrusted upwards into her ass - and directly afterwards down - when the duo inside her cunt reclaimed the place between her folds.",
      "At this point she didn't have the strength to hold herself steady anymore, so she simply let her pelvis be thrown up and down like a toy, still relishing in the high of her orgasm.",
      "Finally, their movements stopped as they spilled more of their nectar into her, probably their version of a climax.",
      "The heat spreading in her womb and ass send her into a new orgasm before she even had the chance to cope with her last.",
      "This time her vision failed and everything around her blurred into a mixture of gold, pink and green as she panted and moaned against the tentacle between her lips.",
      "The vines fucking her cunt and rear picked up a slower pace, obviously still not content with the number of orgasms they had drawn from her, but less relentless in their thrusting.",
      "Instead of keeping the focus on her lower half, the plant raised two new tentacles from the mess of vines below her.",
      "These ones weren't covered in nectar, but each wore a small bud at its tip that bloomed into flowers, similar to the glowing golden one above her face.",
      "Just that those were neither as lush as the single one, nor were they radiating this captivating light.",
      "They had four petals respectively, thick, broad and a little curved.",
      "Instead of pistils or something similar there was a mound in the middle, just big enough for...",
      "\"Ah, aaaah\", she moaned as the flowers lowered themselves on her breasts, the mounds latching onto her nipples while the petals closed themselves around her skin, clinging tightly to the curves of her tits.",
      "A shudder went through the tentacles.",
      "The next thing she knew was that she was screaming herself hoarse as a sudden bolt of pleasure ran through her body when the tentacles started sucking at her nipples.",
      "The fleshy petals contracted and loosened around her breasts rhythmically, making her pant and moan with pleasure as the vines in her cunt sped up again.",
      "Something was dripping down her chest, and she wondered remotely if she was lactating, but her mind went blank again when a third orgasm tore through her trashing body.",
      "A blissful grin on her lips and covered in nectar and cum, Rose was lowered into the writhing vines below her, too exhausted to move or protest.",
      "Now that she had been pleasured silly, the plant seemed to focus on its own goals.",
      "She was no longer held at her hands and feet - not that she would've been able to escape if she had wanted to - instead the whole amount of green appendages began to entangle themselves with her still spasming limbs.",
      "The tentacle in her mouth had vanished, instead two vines began fucking her mouth while those in her cunt were replaced by four thinner vines.",
      "She would have vocalized her ecstasy if she could have remembered how to use her voice.",
      "Two more vines joined the one in her ass until there was no more room for others, causing them to resort to coil around her waist and pump back and forth between her breasts.",
      "With every orgasm they reached they pumped more nectar inside her, until her womb was so full it formed a visible bump.",
      "She couldn't remember how many more times she had cum, but she couldn't remember anything else either so it was probably fine.",
      "No longer able to tell where her own body ended and the plant began, she dimly noticed the vines retreating until she was once again basked in the golden shine of the flower.",
      "Whispers filled her blank mind, forming words, forming orders that engraved themselves deep into her soul.",
      "You will return to your home.",
      "\"...will return... home...\", she mumbled indistinctly.",
      "You will tell no one of this place......You will be around other humans......You will come here again tonight.",
      "Yes, of course she would...",
      "how could she not, now that she knew what pleasures would await her...",
      "You will forget you have been told this.",
      "When Rose awoke, it was almost noon.",
      "Her muscles were stiff and aching, her skin covered in fluids she could not name and her insides felt painfully empty.",
      "She didn't bother worrying about it; she had done that enough already yesterday.",
      "So instead of second guessing her motivations, she went downstairs, chugged an entire two liter bottle of water, searched for the box of sex toys she had hidden somewhere in the house and went down to the pool.",
      "How it was possible to be this warm at 11 a.m. was beyond her, so the water was refreshingly cool.",
      "The mixture of exhaustion and arousal she seemed to be trapped in made her blindly grab what turned out to be a vibro egg, which led to a lot of confusion as she tried to turn it on.",
      "Groaning she slipped it inside her - for some reason she was already incredibly wet - and began to search for the remote control.",
      "When she finally found it, she set it to a medium level and sighed as the vibrations kicked in.",
      "Too tired to really do anything she put the remote back in the box and rested her arms and head on the rim of the pool, whilst letting her body float.",
      "For about five minutes, she was completely content.",
      "Then it all went south really quickly.",
      "\"Rose?",
      "Hey, Rose!",
      "Are you at home?\", Cherry's voice asked from somewhere behind the fence.",
      "Oh fuck.",
      "Fuck fuck fuck.",
      "Panicking she started to search for the small remote, but it had somehow slipped to the bottom of the box and she just couldn't find it.",
      "Blindly she grabbed around while Cherry's voice got closer and closer.",
      "There!",
      "That felt like it.",
      "She just had to get a better grip on it and- \"Ngh!\", she moaned as she accidentally pushed a button, the vibrations suddenly increasing.",
      "Her grip on the remote failed and the arm she used to steady herself gave in at the sudden wave of pleasure, with a splash she fell back into the pool.",
      "\"Oh, there you are!\", Cherry exclaimed and stepped up from behind the building.",
      "In a last desperate attempt to save the situation she pushed the box under the nearest daybed, hid her nakedness behind the curtain of her hair and the wall of the pool, and tried to look innocent.",
      "Ignoring the still slowly increasing vibrations inside her would be difficult, but if she focused on something mundane it had to work.",
      "Cherry, completely oblivious and wearing a pink bikini that was definitely to small for Rose's current state, waved and approached her with a smile.",
      "\"Hi!",
      "I'm sorry if I'm surprising you, I called you like, six times but I think your phone was turned off.\"",
      "That or Rose had simply been ignoring anything outside of her own body.",
      "\"Oh no, no, it's fine!\"",
      "Nothing suspicious going on...",
      "\"You said we could come over if it's too hot, and well... it really is.\"",
      "Wait, we?",
      "\"Is, uh...",
      "Is Selina with you?\" Cherry shook her head.",
      "\"Nah, she's still working.\"",
      "It was probably better that way.",
      "She couldn't imagine it would be helpful to have Selina in front of her while she was trying not to let on she had a fucking vibrator inside her cunt.",
      "The realization hit her like a train.",
      "She was naked in her pool, masturbating, while another girl in a very tight bikini was watching her.",
      "Fuck, she thought as her walls clenched around the toy, think of something else, anything else!",
      "\"Are you okay?\", Cherry asked, kneeling down to her and unknowingly giving her a very good view of her chest.",
      "Something inside Roses mind snapped and she looked directly into Cherrys eyes.",
      "\"Yes, I'm fine.\", she said with a calmness she had not expected.",
      "\"Why don't you come in?\" Wait, what?",
      "Was she crazy?!",
      "Something seemed to happen with Cherry, for her eyes suddenly glazed over and her lips opened just a little bit.",
      "\"S-sure...\", she mumbled almost trancelike.",
      "As she climbed in however, the cool water of the pool seemed to shake her out of it.",
      "\"Gosh, the water is heavenly!",
      "You're so lucky to have a pool- A-are you naked?!\"",
      "The memory of soothing golden light flashed behind her eyes and Rose felt something engage inside her mind.",
      "Following her intuition she looked Cherry straight into the eyes.",
      "\"Don't worry about it.",
      "You don't mind.\"",
      "That sleepy expression returned to her face and she nodded obediently.",
      "She was so close Rose could see her reflection in her eyes...",
      "No, that couldn't be.",
      "Rose's irises were not really glowing were they?",
      "The odd feeling in her spread and drowned that thought out.",
      "Suddenly she was painfully aware again that something inside her was vibrating and pulsing and demanding her attention.",
      "\"Cherry...\", she heard her own voice say, \"Do you want to know a secret?\" Wait, what was going on with her?",
      "She hadn't meant to... to say that... hadn't she?",
      "She couldn't think straight as long as she was focusing on not cumming in front of her crush's best friend.",
      "The pretty ginger still stared at her yearningly, but managed to nod again.",
      "\"I am masturbating right now.\", Rose said with a smile, even tough she couldn't remember when she had decided to say that.",
      "All she knew was that she was very, very horny, and Cherry was very, very pretty.",
      "Said girl blinked slowly.",
      "\"Oh...?\"",
      "\"Yes.",
      "There's a vibrator inside me.",
      "A very big one, and it's been on the whole time.\"",
      "Cherrys breath quickened a little and Rose spoke on: \"Can you imagine that?",
      "While you were talking to me, I was secretly masturbating with a really big vibro egg.",
      "Here, I'll show you!\"",
      "Without questioning herself she grabbed Cherrys hand and pulled it down to her slit.",
      "Her skin was warm and soft as she pressed her fingers onto her cunt so she could feel the vibrations.",
      "Cherry whimpered.",
      "Rose smiled.",
      "\"I'm going to fuck you.\"",
      "Cherry blinked, the glassy sheen on her eyes fading a little.",
      "\"A-Are you sure...?\"",
      "She concentrated and felt her eyes light up with a golden shine.",
      "\"Yes.",
      "And I'm very sure that's what you want, too.\"",
      "Not that she particularly cared.",
      "Anger boiled in her lower belly, mixing with her arousal.",
      "She had been in the middle of something when Cherry'd come barging in, not only interrupting her but also using the excuse of an invitation she had meant for Selina, not her cute but boring best friend.",
      "She wanted compensation.",
      "So she lowered her voice and spoke directly into the gingers mind.",
      "\"That's what you came here for, after all.",
      "That's why you keep bothering me when I'm talking to Selina, isn't it?",
      "You want to be fucked so very badly you've been wet since the moment you decided to visit me.\"",
      "Cherrys hand clasped down on Roses cunt, twitching with the sudden change in her body.",
      "Through the fabric of her bikini she could see her nipples stiffen.",
      "\"...yes...Yes!\", she breathed hoarsely, \"I-I want... want to be fucked...\" Rose smile turned into a malicious grin before she leaned forward and pressed her lips onto Cherrys.",
      "The younger girl sighed and gasped, but that weren't the sounds Rose wanted to her from her.",
      "She bit down on Cherrys lower lip until she was moaning and wailing in her arms.",
      "Much better.",
      "\"...what... are you doing?\", she asked breathlessly when Rose pulled back, noticing the strand of saliva connecting their lips had a pinkish color.",
      "Like... nectar.",
      "Determined she pushed Cherry up on the rim of the pool.",
      "\"You'll see\" was the terse retort.",
      "With a few quick movements she had undone the knots of her bikini and Cherry was as naked as she was.",
      "For a moment, Rose just leaned back and enjoyed the view.",
      "Next to Selina, Cherry might be invisible, but she still was a beauty of her own.",
      "Slender, delicate, with small firm breasts and unblemished skin.",
      "She was breathing fast and her eyes were glazed over, but Rose couldn't help but feel unsatisfied.",
      "She wanted to hear her scream, to see her lose every little bit of control she might still have if her body.",
      "And she wanted her punished, for that damn interruption.",
      "Determined she leaned over the rim and grabbed the box she had so hastily hidden.",
      "No longer willing to turn the toy inside her off, she ignored the remote control and instead reached for something else.",
      "A unicum called \"The Screw\", something fashioned for her alone, and something she usually didn't use until she was really worked up.",
      "The long toy was light blue, only slickly thinner than her forearm and its silicone as soft as it was firm.",
      "It was shaped like a long angular cylinder with a quadratic base, the sides carved in to make the edges more protruding.",
      "The first time she'd seen it, she thought it looked similar to a weirdly angular screw, since the carved-in sides spiraled around the toy to its top.",
      "The second thing she grabbed was more simple: a small vibrating plug.",
      "If she wanted to see Cherry lose her mind, that was exactly the right combo.",
      "\"On your stomach\", she ordered the ginger, but noticed her eyes were losing the glassy shine the longer she was distracted.",
      "\"I... I'm not sure I want to do that...\", she mumbled and Rose sighed.",
      "\"Of course you do.\", she stated matter of fact and pushed herself out of the water.",
      "A quick stroke over her dripping cunt confirmed her suspicion: just like her saliva, the other bodily fluids had taken on a pink color, like the nectar from her dreams.",
      "It's effect was hopefully the same...",
      "\"I'm fact...\", Rose said, lifting the finger covered in her juices, \"It's the only thing you ever wanted.\"",
      "Gently she let a little pink drop fall onto Cherry's lips and watched how her tongue reflexively darted out to swipe it away.",
      "Her eyes went wide and with a gasp she closed her lips around Roses finger, desperately sucking the aphrodisiac off her skin.",
      "\"See?\", Rose mocked her smugly while her new plaything licked her clean.",
      "\"More\", the girl whimpered pathetically, \"please, more, I need more...\" Well... she could be generous.",
      "Placing the toys on the side for later she kneeled over Cherry, legs spread to either side of her head.",
      "\"If you insist...\", she agreed, slowly lowering herself onto Cherry's mouth.",
      "The ginger didn't lose any time and immediately began sucking on her vibrating flesh.",
      "Rose moaned.",
      "Cherry might not be particularly skilled or experienced, but the frenzy in which she was working her cunt easily made up for that.",
      "That, and the toy still vibrating inside her made it impossible to last long.",
      "When she came, pink aphrodisiac gushing over Cherry's face, she had almost forgotten the grudge she held against her.",
      "Almost.",
      "Sliding off of her, she grabbed the toys and let herself fall back into the pool.",
      "Cherry was breathing hard, completely intoxicated by the rush of nectar she'd just swallowed.",
      "When Rose repeated her earlier command to turn onto her stomach, she obeyed eagerly.",
      "Satisfied Rose pulled her closer until Cherry's dripping slit hovered over the end of the pool, knees spread as far as possible and her ass high in the air.",
      "\"R-Rose\", she moaned.",
      "\"Please...\" Rose smiled, coating The Screw in her own pink cum before positioning it at Cherry's entrance.",
      "\"As you wish.\"",
      "Her scream was sweet in Roses ears when she rammed the toy deep into her wet cunt.",
      "Cherrys hands tightened to fists and she threw her head back, body arching and walls clenching around the very thick toy.",
      "\"Too... ah!\", she moaned.",
      "\"Too much!",
      "I can't- AH!\"",
      "Rose cut her off by pressing the already vibrating tip of the small plug to the puckered skin between her cheeks.",
      "Slowly, in order to keep her distracted and unable to speak, she eased the plug into her asshole, eliciting moan after moan from Cherry.",
      "When it finally popped into place, Cherry went completely rigid, screaming as her cunt convulsed around The Screw and cum dropped down her thighs.",
      "Rose waited patiently until the ginger stopped twitching and caught her breath.",
      "\"How do you feel, Cherry?\"",
      "The ginger made a hoarse sound.",
      "\"Do you feel good?\"",
      "She nodded and Rose' face grew serious.",
      "\"Because I don't.\"",
      "With a flick she turned The Screw on and watched Cherry scream when its tip began rotating inside of her, vibrations on the highest level.",
      "The ginger collapsed onto the wooden tiles around the pool, halfheartedly trying to pull back or at least get a hold of the toy Rose was firmly keeping in place.",
      "\"Look, I'm not saying I don't enjoy your company.\", she said in a casual tone, ignoring the way Cherry tried to speak through her cries of pleasure.",
      "\"But I was quite happy by myself, you know?",
      "And then you showed up, on an invitation clearly meant for Selina...",
      "Do you see why I am a little dissatisfied right now?\" Cherry had begun to grind her hips against the floor, her eyes were rolling back and her breasts squeezed beneath her.",
      "She opened her mouth to answer, but it turned into a long, throaty moan instead.",
      "Rose smiled.",
      "\"So, Cherry... how would you like to repay me?\"",
      "It was unclear if she just still wasn't able to answer, or if she was so far gone now her mind couldn't comprehend the question anymore.",
      "\"Would it help if I turned this off?\", Rose asked with faux innocence and pulled The Screw out a few centimeters.",
      "\"Plea- Ah, AAAAAH!",
      "-se, yes, yes, fuck\", Cherry blabbered, her body however never stopped to impale itself on the toy, clenching down on it and rolling her hips.",
      "It was clear she had no control over her movements by now, was running entirely on lust and instinct.",
      "\"I'm not sure...",
      "You seem really enthusiastic right now, don't you?\"",
      "\"N- OOOOOOH, oh, mmmmmh, please, out, OUT!",
      "Too... ah... too much.\"",
      "\"If you insist...\" Slowly, slowly she pulled the Screw back another centimeters, then another.",
      "Just one more and the wildly rotating tip would press exactly on her G-spot...",
      "\"Ah, FUCK, FUCK, ROSE, PLEASE- Aaaaah, god, hng...\" Her body was trashing, her hips grinding against the floor so hard Rose was afraid she would break something.",
      "With a shudder of arousal she watched her throw her head back and scream a scream so loud they might still hear it in town.",
      "Her rosy folds were dripping around the Screw and Rose thrusted it back into her cunt, making Cherry howl and curse.",
      "It was kind of beautiful, actually, the way her thighs trembled on both sides of her stomach, no longer strong enough to hold her ass up, but still trying to buck it against the toy she didn't want but so desperately needed.",
      "Rose kept up the delicious torture until Cherry collapsed, gasping for air and grinning insanely.",
      "Her eyes were half closed and glazed over with a haze of pleasure.",
      "Rose sighed.",
      "\"You are really distracting, you know?",
      "Where was I... Ah, yes.\"",
      "She pushed herself out of the water and leaned forwards until her mouth hovered directly over Cherry's ear.",
      "\"What will you do to repay me?\"",
      "The ginger turned her head a little so she could look at her.",
      "\"Anything\", she breathed.",
      "\"Everything.",
      "Whatever you want...\" Rose, relishing in the supernatural control she had over her, pressed her own, pink-cum-dripping cunt against the base of The Screw jutting out between Cherrys folds.",
      "\"How about I'll show you what I want?\"",
      "It was past seven p.m. when they arrived at the cafe.",
      "They hadn't been able to go by bicycle for... certain reasons, and they had gone off late too.",
      "The whole afternoon had been spent testing her control of Cherry, which turned out to be her new favorite activity.",
      "After the ginger had recovered from The Screw, Rose had gone inside to get something to drink, ordering Cherry to find the most absurd method to pleasure herself while she was away.",
      "She had come back to the view of Cherry impaling her cunt on the polished stone digits of one of these modern art sculptures the architect had placed in the garden.",
      "Her knees had shaken from all the squats necessary to get the friction she needed, but she had been relentless, her head thrown back, tongue out.",
      "After that, she had wanted to test the psychic limits of her spell, so she'd ordered Cherry to choose as many toys from the box as she could fit inside her body, then to fuck herself senseless - without cumming.",
      "After three hours the sight of her - thrusting a vibrator even thicker than The Screw into her cunt, a cord of anal beads hanging out her ass and grinding against a Lay On beneath her clit - had moved her to have mercy and she'd allowed her to cum.",
      "The following orgasm had lasted about twenty minutes and been full of screaming, moaning and cursing.",
      "When her body had finally calmed down, she'd been hoarse, sore and as submissive as a little puppy.",
      "The overdose of pleasure had done something to her, for every time she looked at Rose it was full of reverence, admiration, awe even, as if she was something godly.",
      "So here they were now, at the cafe, waiting for Selina to show up.",
      "Cherry with a vibro-egg on standby in her cunt, Rose with the fitting app opened on her phone.",
      "She was still a little salty about her unannounced visit.",
      "\"Hey guys!\", Selina greeted them when she came over.",
      "\"You're late!\"",
      "\"Yes, we were working out pretty long.\", Rose lied without batting an eye.",
      "Cherry nodded.",
      "\"You should've come along, Selina, it was so much fun!\"",
      "Good girl, Rose thought and tipped \"On\" on her phone.",
      "Cherry jumped a little, but relaxed immediately, not wanting to give herself away.",
      "The black haired beauty sighed.",
      "\"I wanted to, but I've been so busy around here.",
      "It's the only cafe with air conditioning in town, you know?\" \"Poor you\", Cherry sympathized.",
      "Rose frowned.",
      "\"You really need time to relax, Selina.",
      "It's not healthy to work that hard.\"",
      "Not that she knew a lot about working hard.",
      "\"Why don't you and Cherry stay overnight at my place?",
      "We could watch movies, eat snacks, have fun...\" Selina rubbed her eyes.",
      "\"That sounds wonderful, but I'm really tired.",
      "I would probably just bore you.\"",
      "Deciding it was time to test her new abilities, Rose pouted and felt her eyes light up.",
      "Her vision was tinted just a tiny little bit golden now, confirming that it worked.",
      "\"Aw, no way.",
      "Come along, Selina.\"",
      "She sighed.",
      "\"Sorry, I really can't.\"",
      "Wait, what?!",
      "\"Oh, and maybe you should go to bed early too.",
      "Your eyes look a little funny, not that you get sick.\"",
      "Selina got up and walked back to the bar.",
      "\"See you later, guys!\"",
      "Confused and angry Rose turned to Cherry, who was breathing a little heavier and rocked her hips against the bench from time to time.",
      "\"Cum\", Rose ordered and Cherry immediately bit her lip, squealed and sighed quietly.",
      "A little stain appeared on her borrowed skirt.",
      "Rose was at a loss.",
      "Why did it work with Cherry, but not with Selina?",
      "At home, Rose skipped going to bed, grabbed Cherry's arm and immediately went down to the cave.",
      "The ginger asked no questions, which just frustrated her further.",
      "Why would she be able to seduce Cherry, the cute but boring Best Friend, but not the stunning beauty Selina?",
      "It didn't make sense!",
      "\"Wait here\", she told her new plaything.",
      "She was not really willing to let her see how she surrendered to that plant.",
      "\"When I come back, bring me home and I'll consider fucking you again tomorrow.",
      "Understood?\" Cherry shuddered in arousal and nodded.",
      "\"Good\" Turning the vibro-egg to the highest setting and enjoying Cherry's abrupt gasps and moans, Rose left her behind and walked down the tunnel.",
      "When she finally reached her destination, she shed her clothes in seconds and let the vines welcome her.",
      "Something was different in that third night.",
      "Maybe they knew how she had turned Cherry into her toy and wanted her to remember her place.",
      "Or maybe they simply were eager to see her again.",
      "Anyway, they were viscous tonight, ravaging her body without bothering to use the flowers glow.",
      "She was thrown around like a doll, pushed against the wall, impaled on so many vines she felt like the whole plant was fucking her cunt.",
      "Her breasts were already being nursed by these celestial four-petal-flowers, her ass cheeks spread by two thicker vines, while an third thrusted into her hole.",
      "She came again and again, but that didn't seem to satisfy them.",
      "After at least six hours they laid her on the ground, face down, breasts pleasured sore rubbing against the floor and knees forced to hold her ass up high in the air.",
      "The single vine that entered her cunt was thick, firm and textured, eliciting low moans from her just by being inside her.",
      "When it finally began moving, it didn't take long before she convulsed around it.",
      "The orgasm was ground-shaking, and it took her a few moments to realize the ground was actually shaking.",
      "She wanted to get up, seek shelter somewhere with no ceiling threatening to come down on her, but the vines threw her to the ground and a hard thrust into her cunt immobilized her again.",
      "Cracks tore through the rocky floor and she whimpered.",
      "She wanted to scream, wanted to run, but oh, she never wanted to lose this feeling of fullness.",
      "As long as the vines kept fucking her, everything would be alright.",
      "She knew it.",
      "Something lush and green broke through the cracks, a bud twice as big as herself, vines and leaves sprouting everywhere around it.",
      "When the ground stopped shaking, it almost reached the ceiling.",
      "The vines inside her had stopped moving for some reason, as if in awe of what was happening.",
      "They twitched slightly when the bud bloomed and revealed its insides.",
      "\"Ah, finally!\", a melodic voice exclaimed.",
      "\"It's been centuries since I've last really breathed.\"",
      "A woman appeared between the golden petals and Rose gasped for air.",
      "The word \"woman\" didn't do her justice.",
      "Her skin was dark and saturated, her eyes as green as a rainforest after a shower.",
      "Her dark brown hair looked like the softest velvet and flowers of all kinds bloomed between the strands.",
      "She was naked and proudly stepped out of her cocoon, her full breasts putting even Selina to shame.",
      "No, she was no woman.",
      "She was a goddess.",
      "\"Persephone's my name, in case you wondered.\", she spoke in her teasingly beautiful voice.",
      "\"And you must be my little Rose.\"",
      "She needed a moment to remember that this was indeed her name.",
      "Unable to speak since her mouth had run dry, she simply nodded.",
      "Persephone smiled.",
      "\"I owe you my sincerest thanks, my sweet Rose.",
      "Without you, I'd still be trapped down there.\"",
      "She came closer, running her fingers over the vines holding Rose.",
      "\"I am sure you have a lot of questions.",
      "As my first adherent in this century, you may ask me anything.\"",
      "\"I...\", Rose breathed, voice breaking.",
      "She swallowed.",
      "\"You are... so b-beautiful.\"",
      "Her smile widened and she ran her hand through Roses hair, who whined at the sweet touch.",
      "\"Yes, I hear that often.",
      "Though it's been a while.",
      "It's pretty lonely in the underground.\"",
      "She sighed.",
      "\"I understand if it takes you some time to process this, your mortal minds are... feeble.",
      "How about I just explain to you what you need to know?\"",
      "Leaning into her touch, Rose nodded.",
      "\"Hm, Let's see...",
      "Firstly, and most importantly, you have the honor of being my adherent.",
      "That means you belong to me; body, soul and mind.",
      "Do you understand that, Rose?\"",
      "Another nod.",
      "\"Wonderful!",
      "I think you already know my name from stories, but to make sure, I'll introduce myself: I am Persephone of Nysa, daughter of Demeter, Goddess of Greenery and Flowers as well as involuntary Queen of the Underworld.",
      "Once powerful and worshipped, but deceived and trapped in a prison of cold, dead rock.",
      "\"The lovely plant you got to know is my servant, my lifeline.",
      "It allowed me to feed on your spirit, or more exactly, your... affection.\"",
      "Rose blushed, suddenly aware that she laid in the dirt in front of her goddess, a vine in her cunt and four more chaining her to the ground.",
      "\"Oh, don't worry.\", Persephone hushed her when she tried to regain her dignity.",
      "\"I don't mind.",
      "In fact, I rather like you in that position.\"",
      "Immediately Rose froze.",
      "If her goddess liked her on the ground, she'd crawl in the dirt as long as Persephone wanted her to.",
      "\"The thing is, Rose, even though I am a goddess, I am not flawless.",
      "In order to regain my power and glory I need adherents.",
      "I need you, my beloved Rose.\"",
      "She snapped her fingers and the vine in her cunt started moving again, this time in slow, caressing thrusts.",
      "Rose moaned.",
      "\"You are a particularly strong spirit.\", Persephone continued.",
      "\"A rare gem.",
      "That's why you were so defensive the first time you met my servant.",
      "But that also means that once you were mine, you'd give me far more power than a weaker spirit, like that cute Cherry.",
      "My servant has transferred my blessing and orders to you, and in return it drew power from your lust and read your mind.",
      "It's a fair exchange, you see?\"",
      "\"Yes\", she breathed, eyes falling shut from the sweet pleasure the vine gave her.",
      "\"Yes... but...\" \"But?\"",
      "\"I seduced Cherry.",
      "I wanted her, so...",
      "oh...",
      "so I did something... with my eyes...\" \"Oh, that.",
      "Well, I'm a very generous goddess.",
      "I love all my adherents, but I have my favorites, whom I grant little gifts.",
      "Since you are my servant too, I saw it fitting to give you the same little tricks my other servant is capable of.",
      "Besides, I knew you would use it for good.",
      "And - without knowing it yet - you did!",
      "The more pleasure you drew from that girl, the more power you gained.",
      "And that power is what my servant took from you, what I am taking from you now.\"",
      "The vine changed the angle of its thrust and curved itself around her clit, sending electricity through her veins until she screamed and spasmed.",
      "After she collapsed, Persephone gently caressed her face.",
      "\"Ah, my lovely Rose, you are beautiful in that state.\", she sighed.",
      "\"However...\" \"However what?\", Rose uttered between her gasps for air.",
      "Was something wrong with her?",
      "Persephone brushed her thumb over Roses lower lip, making her tremble.",
      "\"Now that I am free, Rose, I want compensation for my time in exile.",
      "I want my former glory back, my temples, my servants and sacrifices.",
      "And in order to achieve that, I need your help.\"",
      "\"I'll do anything!\", Rose affirmed immediately.",
      "\"Whatever you want me to do.\"",
      "\"Oh honey, I believe you!",
      "I just don't think you are capable of doing what I need you to do.",
      "Not yet.\"",
      "Dismayed Rose looked down.",
      "If she was no use to her goddess... if she disappointed her, she would never forgive herself.",
      "\"Don't make that face, my love.",
      "There is still hope.\"",
      "Rose looked up again.",
      "Persephones beautiful face was thoughtful, her eyes looking at the plant behind Rose.",
      "\"What I need you to do is to collect more power for me, Rose.",
      "Not from your ginger friend or the likes of her, but from people with spirits like yours.",
      "From people that don't succumb from just a look at your pretty eyes.\"",
      "\"Like Selina\", Rose whispered and her goddess nodded.",
      "\"Like that Selina.",
      "I need you to be able to... convince her of following me.",
      "To make her give every ounce of strength in her body to you, so you can transfer it to me.\"",
      "\"But how can I do that if she's a...",
      "\"strong spirit\"?\" Persephone snapped her fingers again to make the vines let go of her and Rose fell on her butt, not able of holding herself up.",
      "Her goddess kneeled between her legs, putting a finger on her chest.",
      "Rose gasped.",
      "\"I will make you my priestess, Rose.\", she said lowly and carefully dragged her finger downwards.",
      "\"I will change you, turn you into something more powerful... by giving you your own servant.",
      "I will put it right... here.\"",
      "Her Finger stopped on her lower abdomen.",
      "\"And it will grant you strength.",
      "And a lot of pleasurable options, if you are creative enough.",
      "That will make you special among my adherents, and it will be a prove of your eternal commitment to me.",
      "How would you like that, Rose?\"",
      "She was still watching Persephone's finger on her skin, but upon hearing her name her head snapped up.",
      "\"Very much, my goddess.",
      "I won't disappoint you, I promise!\"",
      "\"I know, my love.\", Persephone said and stood up.",
      "A gesture of her hand made the giant bud in the middle of the room transform, turn from a simple flower to something that looked like throne: one long petal formed the backrest, one folded itself into a seat and two more created the armrests.",
      "The sepals formed stairs leading up the the throne.",
      "Once Persephone had taken her seat, she had perfect view of her new adherent - and the plant behind said adherent.",
      "\"My dear Rose,\" she spoke ceremonially, \"I, Persephone of Nysa, put my trust in you and declare you my high priestess.",
      "Your life will be mine, and my blessing will be yours.",
      "You will harvest the love of mortals as my reaper, but your own harvest will be mine to take.",
      "No other goddess may command you, for your loyalty is mine.",
      "Do you accept?\" Rose didn't bother trying to stand up.",
      "Even if she had been strong enough, Persephone liked her on the ground.",
      "\"Yes, my goddess.\", she agreed and Persephone smiled.",
      "\"Very well.",
      "Then my servant shall salve you.\"",
      "A snap of her fingers and suddenly the dormant vines came to life, wrapped around her ankles and wrists and pulled her in the air.",
      "The already well known flowers closed their petals around her breasts, and a nectar-dripping tentacle pushed into her mouth, but additionally there was a fourth appendage rising.",
      "This one had three fleshy, thick petals like the flowers massaging her breasts, but this flower was bigger.",
      "And it didn't have a mound in its middle.",
      "No, instead it had a thick, long, curved pistil jutting out between its petals.",
      "Rose swallowed and the vines around her knee bends and ankles spread her legs, further and further apart until her knees where next to her head.",
      "Her cunt was as exposed as it could be when the three-petals-flower finally came closer.",
      "The round tip of the pistil pressed against her entrance and Rose gasped around the tentacle in her mouth.",
      "Inch by Inch it pushed forwards, slowly and teasingly until she was used to its width.",
      "Then it rammed into her with force, the upper petal closing around her abdomen, the lower two latching onto her ass cheeks.",
      "A shudder went through the vine, reached its petals and pistil and made Rose cry out in ecstasy.",
      "The vibrations on her clit, the sore skin of her ass, inside her were enough to send her over the edge.",
      "When her breathing calmed down again, she hesitantly looked at Persephone.",
      "The goddess was watching her attentively and snapped her fingers again.",
      "Another vine entered her ass, though it was more in order to stabilize her than anything else.",
      "Because even though she couldn't take her eyes off Persephone, from the corner of her eye she still noticed the bump traveling up the three-petaled vine.",
      "When it reached the beginning of pistil, she could feel the shaft widen, stretching her cunt wide to accommodate its gift.",
      "The egg-",
      "no the seed was as big as fist and if she weren't so full of aphrodisiac, she might have protested.",
      "Instead she raised her hips, rocked against the pistil and threw her head back in ecstasy.",
      "Slowly the seed passed her entrance, stretched her walls and finally hit the passage to her womb.",
      "And she knew, there was no way this could be comfortable or even just tolerable, but her understanding of pleasure was already so twisted after spending three nights in the plants tight embrace that she couldn't help but cum when the seed was forcefully pushed into her womb.",
      "Her whole body arched and she could feel Persephone's burning gaze on her skin when she trashed and shook and grind against the flower.",
      "But it wasn't over yet.",
      "She had barely recovered from the last one as another fist-sized seed stretched her wide and made her climax again.",
      "Her belly felt heavy and full, but there were still more coming.",
      "Rose lost count of the number of seeds entering her, all she knew was that Persephone was watching and she needed her to be content.",
      "When the last seed entered her, there was a visible bump on her stomach and her breasts felt heavier than before.",
      "A satiated sigh escaped her as the petals loosened and the pistil was pulled out of her.",
      "Persephone stood up and strode over to her priestess.",
      "\"How are you feeling, Rose?\"",
      "The brunette moaned in response and Persephone chuckled.",
      "\"Sounds good.",
      "And don't worry about that,\" she pointed at her swollen belly, \"it will disappear once the seeds have taken root.\"",
      "Rose mustered up all her willpower and managed to breath a vague \"How?\".",
      "\"Well, the shell will dissolve and leave only the soft sprouts.",
      "They need little space once they have connected to your body.",
      "Which is what I'm going to initiate now, if you allow, my love?\"",
      "She nodded weakly and the vines lowered her until Persephone could lay a hand on her stomach.",
      "Her skin was soft and warm...",
      "A flash of golden light followed by searing pain tore her out of her reverence.",
      "She cried out in surprise, but not even ten seconds later it was all over.",
      "\"Shshsh, it's alright.",
      "Do you feel better, Rose?\"",
      "She was breathing heavy as the vines let go of her, and actually managed to stand on her own feet.",
      "\"Yes... yes, I feel... good.",
      "Really good, my goddess.\"",
      "Persephone beamed.",
      "\"Wonderful!",
      "Then there's only one thing left to do...\" Her smile turned serious.",
      "\"Bring me Selina.\"",

      "It was around 5 a.m. when Selina unlocked the door of the cafe.",
      "Guests or her boss wouldn't arrive before 7 or - more likely - 8, but she needed the time to prepare.",
      "Besides, this was the only time of the day she could relax a little.",
      "It was still dark outside and she loved how cozy it was in here when the lights were on.",
      "The air was still cool enough and she could drink her favorite lemonade without any orders interrupting her peace...",
      "\"Huh?\"",
      "She clicked the light switch again, but nothing happened.",
      "Oh no, please no power failure!",
      "Not now, in her rare free time.",
      "Maybe it was just the fuse?",
      "Yeah, she could hear the fridge hum in the kitchen, so at least it was no complete blackout.",
      "Sighing she groped her way towards the fuse box in the back room.",
      "Did it smell funny in here?",
      "Maybe they had new flowers for the tables.",
      "She should talk to her boss about it, this sweet, heady scent might be a little too much for... for... the guests?",
      "Right...",
      "She shook her head.",
      "Maybe she should've slept a little longer.",
      "She felt awfully warm and sleepy all of a sudden... not unpleasantly, not really...",
      "but very... very...",
      "\"Woah!\", she yelled when she tripped over something long and heavy.",
      "Something like a chuckle came from the opposite side of the room and Selina froze.",
      "\"Hey!",
      "Who's there?!\", she snarled into the darkness, but her words were a little slurred.",
      "A dim, golden glow illuminated a female silhouette from behind and Selina tensed.",
      "\"How rude, Selina.\", a sweet voice answered, a little too hoarse for her to immediately recognize her.",
      "\"I stood up so early, just to visit you, and you yell at me.\"",
      "\"...Rose? What... what are you doing here?\"",
      "Blinking she leaned against a table, trying to clear her head.",

      "\"Oh, I know\", Rose answered and came closer.",

      "She told me pretty much everything: when your shift starts, when the first guests arrive, where the fuse box is...\" \"Wait...",
      "You broke the lights?\"",
      "\"Nah, just disabled them for now.",

      "\"Yeah, I mean, I know, but... why?\" Rose was directly in front of her now and Selina took a step back until her back bumped against the table.",
      "Whatever the source of the strange glow was, it hovered directly behind her.",
      "\"Well, if the lights were on, people could see through the windows in here.",
      "And I don't think that's in your interest.\"",
      "She frowned, trying to keep up with her words, but her body was too distracting.",
      "Her breathing had quickened the closer Rose had come, and her breasts felt uncomfortably heavy.",
      "Heat pooled in her lower abdomen and made her twitch when Rose placed her hands on either side of the table, trapping her between her warm body and the cool table.",
      "Something coiled itself around her leg.",
      "\"Rose... wait, are you naked?\"",
      "As if it had waited for her question, the mysterious light source rose over Rose' head and illuminated the scene completely.",
      "The brunette was indeed naked, the tanned skin of her breasts glistening in the sensual glow and her nipples stiffened.",
      "And below that...",
      "Selina blinked, sure that this must be a mistake.",
      "From in between Rose's pink folds sprouted several thick, green tentacle-esque tendrils.",
      "One of the appendages had wrapped itself around her leg, another held the golden light and a third one rose up to the height of her face, dripping with pink nectar.",
      "She blinked, waiting for it to disappear - futilely.",
      "Then she screamed.",
      "Faster than a snakes bite it thrust into her mouth, choking down her voice in her throat as even more vines wrapped around her limbs; lifting her on the table and spreading her legs in one swift movement.",
      "\"You might be a little distressed now\", Rose whispered into her ear, her voice almost feverish.",
      "\"But I promise, soon this will be all you'll ever wish for.\"",
      "If she had had troubles processing her words before, now they were echoing in her head crystal clearly, drowning out her own thoughts.",
      "She gasped for air, her throat clenching down on the tentacle inside and Rose moaned.",
      "\"Goddess, I can't wait to fuck your mouth for real.",
      "But first...\", she pressed her hand - or was it another vine?",
      "- beneath her skirt and against the growing wet stain on her panties, \"I want to see you come apart.\"",
      "She whimpered - and she wanted to believe it was out of fear - when her panties were torn to shreds and she could feel Rose caressing her dripping folds.",
      "In a desperate attempt to regain control over her body, she bit on the tentacle in her mouth, but it only caused more of this intoxicating sweetness to gush down her throat.",
      "\"Nah-ah!\", Rose scolded her.",
      "\"Bad girl.\"",
      "Without warning the tentacle thrust deeper, pumping the aphrodisiac directly into her stomach and cutting off the air.",
      "For a few seconds - or minutes?",
      "- her vision turned black, and when it returned, she was lying stark naked on her stomach, bend over the table.",
      "The dim light caused the window to reflect what happened behind her, and what she saw made her shudder.",
      "She was held in place by four, maybe five tendrils, chained to the table and legs spread enough to expose her cunt.",
      "Rose stood behind her, running a hand over Selina's bare ass with half-closed eyes.",
      "\"There are two options for me, Selina.\", she all but hummed.",
      "\"I could drug and hypnotize you until you are a brainless, lust-ridden puppet like cute little Cherry.",
      "It wouldn't take a minute until you would crawl at my feet, begging for my attention.",
      "Who knows, maybe I'd make you walk through the entire town masturbating and screaming my name?\"",
      "More slick tendrils sneaked beneath her and curled around her breasts as Rose leaned over her.",
      "\"But as tempting as that sounds, it's not as satisfying.",
      "I've spent so much time thinking of fucking you...",
      "I don't want this to be quick, or simple.",
      "So...\" Her lips were directly next to her ear and she kept eye contact with Selina through her reflection.",
      "\"I will make you beg in a more traditional way.",
      "Step one: Suck.\"",
      "It took a while, but she managed to shake her head despite the tentacle in her mouth.",
      "Rose sighed and began stroking her cunt again, small, teasing movements.",
      "Against her will, she gasped and her knees began to tremble.",
      "\"Suck my tendril, Selina.\", Rose urged her calmly.",
      "\"Be a good girl.\"",
      "She couldn't see what happened under the table, but something caressed the tender skin of the inside of her thigh.",
      "Another whimper forced itself out of her throat, and this time not even she could pretend it was completely out of disgust, or even fear.",
      "The tentacle in her mouth began to swirl around her tongue, gently, lovingly.",
      "It's heady sweetness filled her mouth and Selina knew she had to swallow, otherwise she'd go insane with how incredible the nectar tasted.",
      "But if she swallowed now, she didn't know if she'd be able to stop.",
      "\"Oh come on, Selina.",
      "We both know you want to, you just don't dare to admit it.\", Rose mocked, inserting the tip of her finger into her cunt.",
      "\"Isn't that right?",
      "You are so busy being the golden child, the flawless employee.",
      "Admitting you have desires, giving in to them... that idea at once scares and excites you, doesn't it?\" Selina closed her eyes, trying to block out her words and ministrations.",
      "\"Let's give you some more ideas, huh?",
      "For example...",
      "how it would feel if I put my vines into that pretty ass of yours.",
      "Two, three at once.\"",
      "Her other hand pulled her ass cheeks apart and dipped a fingertip inside her, only just.",
      "Selina wailed.",
      "\"Or if I put your knees on that table, next to your head so the muscles here\", the vine between her thighs rubbed up and down, \"are stretched to the limit and I can fuck you until you can't walk for weeks.\"",
      "Rose smiled.",
      "\"I'll do all of that, and more.",
      "But first...\" Her fingers thrust into her cunt without warning.",
      "\"Suck!\"",
      "Startled she swallowed a gulp of aphrodisiac.",
      "And another.",
      "And another.",
      "Defeated she moaned and milked the tentacle with her tongue, bobbing her head back and forth.",
      "She couldn't stop, not when her walls started clenching and pulsing, so close to the edge.",
      "But just before she could reach it, Rose stopped her ministrations.",
      "A pathetically disappointed sound escaped her when she pulled the tentacle out.",
      "Why would she work her up like this, just to leave her unsatisfied.",
      "Angry she looked at Rose reflection, but what she saw made her face go slack.",
      "There was a new tentacle between Rose' legs, this one shorter and thicker than the others, it's tip more blunt.",
      "It jutted upwards like a big green cock, fully erect and firm against Rose' hands.",
      "Selina swallowed.",
      "\"Do you want me to fuck you?\", Rose asked, sensually stroking her length up and down.",
      "Selina swallowed again, trying to speak but her voice failed her.",
      "God, it was so big.",
      "She didn't actually want this inside her, did she?",
      "This awfully wide girth spreading her, stretching her, reaching places inside her she didn't even know of... this horrible length lifting her hips from the table every time it thrust into her wet, dripping cunt until it could go no further, until Rose' hips were grinding against hers?",
      "This big appendage fucking her to completion?",
      "\"Yes\", she breathed defeated, but Rose continued to stroke herself with both hands.",
      "\"Ah, ah!",
      "Say it.\"",
      "A frustrated growl formed in her throat, but the desire to have this long botanic cock inside her was greater than her pride.",
      "\"Please, fuck me.\", she pressed out.",
      "\"Fuck me, Rose!\"",
      "She smiled.",
      "\"Good Girl.\"",
      "And finally, she rammed it into her waiting cunt, making Selina scream of pleasure.",
      "\"God, Rose, Rose, fuck- AH!",
      "Ah, mhm.\"",
      "The other tendrils began assaulting her ass, like promised three of them thrusting into her at once, while the others kneaded her tits greedily.",
      "It felt better than anything her dirtiest fantasies had been able to come up with, the friction between the clenching walls of her cunt and Rose' tentacle cock too good to be real.",
      "She gasped and panted when Rose seemed to go deeper every time she plunged her divine appendage back into her, rocking back her hips to meet her thrusts.",
      "God, just a little more, just a little...",
      "Suddenly Rose stilled and Selina all but sobbed.",
      "Why did she leave her hanging again?",
      "\"Rose, please, please, I need to...",
      "I need...\" \"I know, I know.\"",
      "Her free hand began to circle her clit again, keeping her right on the edge.",
      "\"But I want you to do something first.\"",
      "\"Do what?\"",
      "As long as it was quick, she'd do anything.",
      "\"To promise me something.",
      "When I am done with you, you are mine.",
      "You will do as I say without question, and will do so happily.",
      "And in return...\", She brushed her clit, making her tremble and quiver beneath her, \"...I'll fuck your brains out.",
      "Every day.",
      "For hours.",
      "In so many ways that there's not a single technique or object you could imagine to not be pleasurable, as long as I'm the one wielding it.",
      "Do you want that?\"",
      "She was so close, she'd promised her everything as long as she'd get her release.",
      "\"Yes!",
      "I'm yours, all yours!",
      "Please, Rose, make me cum now!\"",
      "Rose smiled and pulled her cock almost all the way out.",
      "Then, in a single, powerful thrust that lifted her hips from the table she sent her over the edge.",
      "Selina opened her mouth to scream, but no sound left her lips as her eyes rolled back in her head and Rose fucked her through her orgasm.",
      "When she finally came somewhat down, all it took was another deep thrust and something hot filling her up to make her climax again.",
      "She heard herself scream and moan and talk weird nonsense until Rose pulled back and she could catch her breath.",
      "\"How do you feel, Selina?\", Rose asked and pressed little kisses to the base of her spine.",
      "Selina hummed, tenderly licking at the tentacle next to her face.",
      "\"Good\", Rose chuckled, \"Because I want you to meet someone... later.\"",
      "With the help of her appendages she turned Selina around so they were face to face.",
      "\"For now, I think we should use the rest of our time, huh?\"",
      "Selina simply smiled and spread her legs even wider when Rose started thrusting again, sighing in her bliss.",
      "The last chapter was somewhat hurried, I was kinda tired of this story and wanted to finish it.",
      "But hey, I did some art!",
      "I take commissions from time to time, if you're interested.",
      "(Somebody please tell me how to insert pictures into a chapter!)"

    "text": "burning incense lamps were scattered amongst high shelves, accompanying some gold-rimmed glass jars, each filled to the brim with faintly glowing, oozing liquids: some held a shoal of fish, each delightfully mimicking the sun's golden light. others had delicate plants: vibrant, almost glowing sangria roses with a wine-red colour; exotic rich, lush lavender; canary-coloured crocus. one seemed to have its own ecosystem, emitting violent crashes of lightning and thunder, disrupting the gentle waves' peaceful rhythm as it hunted the tiny yet bright critters that resided there. sat amongst this marvellous display was a winged creature: her tiny body was thin and fragile, with gentle yet elegant wings decorated with fine, exquisite gold and arranged into beautiful patterns. atop her head sat a crown, laced with intricate designs, each jewel carved with extraordinary precision and attention. and yet a plague seemed to be destroying its delicacy: a shadow was cast upon it, riddled with disease and wrath and demons from all kinds of hells, cursed by the demons of war and chaos. \"there is nothing more warming than death's heavenly touch, her divine eyes... no creature could mimic their soft glow.\" sharply, she cast her elegant sword. its handle was wonderfully woven with gold and laced with mahogany jewels, much like the eyes of a cruel spider. and with a sudden burst of energy, the creature freed her wings, and let them spread to greet the calm night. her precious creations quivered and shook as the floor beneath her shuddered as she escaped into the darkness. gradually, mountains began to grow larger, their vast kingdom opening up to her. curling clouds and distant stars gazed upon her in wonder, acting as guidance to the creature's destination. she followed their gentle touch while carefully trailing behind the creatures that resided in the night, admiring them from afar. murky dots began to transform into sullen pine trees, surrounded by oil-slick, death ridden shadows. violently, an enraged sea whipped the coast and shattered the wildlife that lived there: the moon held an uncontrollable fury, influenced by its citizens. dim, hazy lights rode the vicious waves, which upon a closer glance, where lost, wandering spirits, which were yet to be taken by death. surrounded by this cruel nature was a cramped, meagre town. cautiously landing upon the land, she scurried down a back alley and into the marketplace, warily avoiding the eyes of the twinkling lights. she tore through the fine cloths of the stalls which the rich so gracefully admired; each was filled to the brim with strange bottles of liquids, a grand display of chickens, turkeys, geese, poultry, plum-puddings, luscious pears, juicy oranges, roasted vegetables, vibrant, glowing apples, blood-red, oozing wine and stacks and stacks of marvellous cakes. instantaneously, it seemed, the luxurious world of the wealthy moulded into that of impoverished and feeble animals. rags and pouches of beggars were battered and tattered with mud and mould. repulsed by themselves, they slunk away into the shadows and she, too, cautiously avoided their disease-ridden touch. crippled and dirty rats bit her arms and legs and suddenly, flashes of cold fire burnt her gaze and trickled after her, like an animal hunting for its prey. dusty, poisoned smoke shrivelled the creature's lungs and burnt her skin until it was cracked and fractured. though rain eventually fell and slaughtered this ferocious fire, it slashed her aching bones its accomplice blinded her with sudden shocks and lashes of light. the deep drumming of thunder warned the weak and feeble and forced them into hiding. suddenly, a shot from the side: the serene luminosity suddenly transformed into acute, wolfish fangs, poisoning her with a sharp and heinous pain that tore at her skin and bones. screeches and howls like a cruel choir resonated and echoed through the wasteland as they crashed against ruined houses in the damp and cramped streets. glass shattered and as if it was acting in retaliation, joined in the vicious battle and seemed to strike like a savage beast, bruising and cutting. scratching and scraping, blood, pure black and red, mixed together and with the rain and tainted the streets. bloodied fur and feathers like mere decorations lay on the ground, slowly blending in with their surroundings. finally, the choir ceased, and the world fell silent: only the resonating, striking bells could be heard, and the sound of a mangled creature struggling and grasping for air. as dawn settled over the land, a familiar figure came before her: death herself. decorated in glorious silk and features that rivalled nature's creatures, her touch soothed the weak and distressed, and yet brought pain to those who wished to look upon her. the warmth of her touch, her soul, seemed to slowly ignite the creature's. though pale and weak, her eyes held the strength of centuries' worth of wars, and yet a calm and reassuring loveliness. \"persephone, my love; why must you seek death? the very thing you despise, the creature that haunts you,\" the creature murmured. persephone weakly laughed, enchanted, almost, by her softly glowing eyes.",

      "cautiously landing upon the land, she scurried down a back alley and into the marketplace, warily avoiding the eyes of the twinkling lights.",
      "she tore through the fine cloths of the stalls which the rich so gracefully admired; each was filled to the brim with strange bottles of liquids, a grand display of chickens, turkeys, geese, poultry, plum-puddings, luscious pears, juicy oranges, roasted vegetables, vibrant, glowing apples, blood-red, oozing wine and stacks and stacks of marvellous cakes.",
      "instantaneously, it seemed, the luxurious world of the wealthy moulded into that of impoverished and feeble animals.",
      "rags and pouches of beggars were battered and tattered with mud and mould.",
      "repulsed by themselves, they slunk away into the shadows and she, too, cautiously avoided their disease-ridden touch.",
      "crippled and dirty rats bit her arms and legs and suddenly, flashes of cold fire burnt her gaze and trickled after her, like an animal hunting for its prey.",
      "dusty, poisoned smoke shrivelled the creature's lungs and burnt her skin until it was cracked and fractured.",
      "though rain eventually fell and slaughtered this ferocious fire, it slashed her aching bones its accomplice blinded her with sudden shocks and lashes of light.",
      "the deep drumming of thunder warned the weak and feeble and forced them into hiding.",
      "suddenly, a shot from the side: the serene luminosity suddenly transformed into acute, wolfish fangs, poisoning her with a sharp and heinous pain that tore at her skin and bones.",
      "screeches and howls like a cruel choir resonated and echoed through the wasteland as they crashed against ruined houses in the damp and cramped streets.",
      "glass shattered and as if it was acting in retaliation, joined in the vicious battle and seemed to strike like a savage beast, bruising and cutting.",
      "scratching and scraping, blood, pure black and red, mixed together and with the rain and tainted the streets.",
      "bloodied fur and feathers like mere decorations lay on the ground, slowly blending in with their surroundings.",
      "finally, the choir ceased, and the world fell silent: only the resonating, striking bells could be heard, and the sound of a mangled creature struggling and grasping for air.",
      "as dawn settled over the land, a familiar figure came before her: death herself.",
      "decorated in glorious silk and features that rivalled nature's creatures, her touch soothed the weak and distressed, and yet brought pain to those who wished to look upon her.",
      "the warmth of her touch, her soul, seemed to slowly ignite the creature's.",
      "though pale and weak, her eyes held the strength of centuries' worth of wars, and yet a calm and reassuring loveliness.",
      "\"persephone, my love; why must you seek death?",
      "the very thing you despise, the creature that haunts you,\" the creature murmured.",
      "persephone weakly laughed, enchanted, almost, by her softly glowing eyes."

    "text": "Artemis bleeds sliver beneath a full moon. she stands tall between two shores, reeds and rocks and fresh water, surrounded by and wolves and women, whom, often, she cannot tell apart. Artemis wears the pelts of her enemies, howls like one her brother's instruments, as the world around her rallies, flows between her feet. - Artemis gifts immortality to girls left gasping in damp back-alleys. she cleans up the blood, offers them a bow, shows them how to aim. \"your enemies shall be mine,\" she promises, panting behind pointed teeth, her hand covering theirs, helping pull the arrow back. - Artemis has horns that are not unlike the devil's. they twist back around her head, sit ivory and perfect, like the crown of a stag. her brother, the bright fool, once called it a halo. Artemis leaves him to his wine, returns silently to the wild, where her kingdom is a coin, both heads and tales, Heaven and Hells. - Artemis wipes blood from her lips-- red blood-- blood that is not her own. she hunts on nights like these, the pack behind her, the land moon-drunk and dangerous. she runs down the men who are careless with their power, beasts who did not bend the knee, kings who strayed too far from their walls. these nights, she is not a god. she is something with claws and fangs and foreign eyes that cut deeper than the rest. - Artemis aches beneath the ribs, both eyes black, blood buried beneath perfect nails. she wins her fights, but the fights bite back, and she indulges in the hurt, drinks it in, lets her den flood with the smell of ichor. There are the maidens-- the younger ones, the ones who belong still in this lifetime-- who have not learned. they dare to draw close to her suffering, her bleeding, her price, hands opened, intentions clean. but she snarls a feral warnings, sends them away, her teeth dripping red; horns sharp and stained. they flee as her godhood breaches the surface. - Artemis listens to the sound of Creation, her brother coaxing out small miracles from the strings at his lap. it is that hour where the day reluctantly hands over the world and night douses its corners, soothes out the creases. \"this one is new,\" he comments, tracing the scar under her lip, a lithe white curve. she stares as the light leaves the horizon, feathering her arrows, stringing her bow. \"this one is old,\" she retaliates, nodding to the harp, to the symphony that could have seduced the stars. he is hurt, but she calloused. she kisses him on the forehead, heads north. - Artemis saves those she can, and mourns the few she cannot. Arethusa, she mourns for years. for decades. for lifetimes. she mourns in the way only a goddess could, until her tears made a river, and the river made a waterfall, and the waterfall fell onto a city of men, drowned them in their sleep. it was not enough. she finds the one who left her maiden-- her companion-- her sister-- in pieces; she turns him into walking venison, sets him loose onto the night. she stalks him for a moon before putting an arrow between his legs. (and ribs. and knuckles. and eyes.) - Artemis listens to her father during midsummer nights as he tears through her domain, leaving flooded creeks, flash burns at the backs of her eyes. she sits against the soft heaving sides, her own teeth bared in what she told herself was a smile, a snarl. justice does not suit you, chimes the storm, rain that rubs the red off her knuckles. she shrugs, her shadow brought forward through the flashes, the slight image of something narrow, and sharp, and hungry. \"what is deserved, i bestow,\" she answers, and Zeus laughs, the sound of the sky tearing in two, Olympus opening above her. and where would that leave us? he asks, and she bows her head, says nothing. - The dawn is blinding. Artemis hands it all back, the trees and the men and the blood, folds it over into Apollo's hands, so much smoother than her own. he rises to the occasion and she sinks down below the horizon, a shadow coaxed back by the light. it's nothing personal. she hopes he knows. \"you could stay,\" he offers, knowing she wouldn't, knowing it was vanity. she shakes her head, squints at the sun, tries to play it off. \"they will not miss me,\" she promises, and he looks back at what she had given him, that thin ribcage of life, between which he could a heart bearing her teeth marks.",

    "text": "The somber notes hung in the air along with the smoke from cigarettes and the stench of alcohol. There were some claps as expected, the enthusiasm drained out of them. Apollo cracked a tiny smile nonetheless. He wasn't playing for them anyway, he was playing for himself. Applause wasn't needed when he felt alive that moment. He leaned in the mic for the last time that night, a baritone voice pouring from the speakers. \"Thank you.\" He had done this so many times that the tiny and filthy stage didn't bother him anymore. It was easy to slip his guitar into its case now but it never got easier to leave the stage knowing that his next few steps promised him nothing but a cold bench and a mockery of who he used to be. \"That was a good set, Apollo.\" Brushing his dark locks away from his eyes, he smiled at the bartender that he had considered a pleasant companion in such an awful place. His smile didn't match his eyes though, far from it. \"Thanks.\" That word never failed to hit him. Thanks. He was a god. Praises, worship, devotion, those were the things he would receive on a daily basis but now every measly compliment thrown his way had him grateful. He was a pathetic shadow of himself. Apollo raised a brow when the bartender slid a shot of bourbon his way, callused fingers hesitantly wrapping around the small glass. \"On the house.\" Fine wine was never out of the question when he was on Olympus, especially with Zeus around, but now he would gladly accept any drink that would pleasantly burn his throat and dull his thoughts afterwards. Especially if It would help in blurring out reality, make it bearable altogether. He raised the glass and gave a nod of acknowledgement at the bartender before downing the drink. It was too fast. It touched his lips for a second and then it was gone. Setting the glass down, he tightened the grip around the handle of his guitar case and made his way out of the bar. The place wasn't the best bar in town; it was small and often too crowded, the lighting was bad and the decor looked like shit but Apollo considered it home for the past few months. He would choose this place on any day. Once he was outside and the sound of upbeat music that replaced him was now muted, Apollo took a breath of the city air. The sky was still dark which at least gave him comfort of a sort. In an hour or two, it would lighten up and the sun would once greet him with a mocking smile. He sighed and walked over to the park, hoping that no one would take his favorite spot. Or at least Hermes was keeping the seat warm for him. The other god always had something that he was willing to share, food or clothing, things that he nicked as he continued to live to up to whatever semblance of his name. He smelled of cigarettes and despair, a stench that curled on his hair and clung to his clothes. He already tried on making poetry from that but he was stuck on a verse. Perhaps if he finished that and performed it somewhere, he'd earn quicker and get that cheap apartment down the street. He knew Hermes would appreciate a roof above their heads.",

    "text": "His nose was buried in a book. Not literally, of course, but close enough that she wouldn't be surprised to find its tip smudged with ink. It was an endearing thought. She cleared her throat to get his attention. Her efforts were met with silence. The corners of her lips lifted in a soft smile as she stepped out of her sandals and onto the plush area rug in his library. Sure, she could wear her shoes wherever, but she loved the feel of the high-pile rug between her toes. Its rich green color and lush texture reminded her of the soft spring grass. It was why he'd picked it. She draped herself over the back of his chair and pressed a kiss to the top of his head before whispering, \"Hello, gorgeous.\" His attention achieved, she quickly leaned back when he jerked into awareness. She'd been on the receiving end of accidental headbutts before. A nose gushing with blood always killed the mood. \"Sweetheart, you're home early,\" his rushed words couldn't hide the joy in his tone. He placed a ragged bookmark between the pages of the tome he was reading before setting it aside with a definite thud on the desk. \"Light reading?\" She teased as she combed her fingers through his curls. \"You're looking a little shaggy, love. Want me to trim it for you later?\" He grunted and turned in his chair, reaching for her. \"Perhaps. I've missed you.\" Slipping easily into his arms and onto his lap, she made herself at home and rested her head on his shoulder. \"I've missed you too. It seems like the warmer months are lasting longer now. At least Mother allows us visits.\" \"Yes, she's getting quite progressive in her dotage,\" he replied dryly, grunting again when she swatted him. \"I'd tell her you said that, but she might rethink her visitation policy and no one wants that.\" She wrinkled her nose and drew her legs up to her chest. His arms tightened around her and he buried his face in her hair, inhaling deeply. \"No, no one wants that. Specifically not me. It's hard enough when you're gone. Not seeing you at all during those long months -\" His voice trailed. \"I can't go back to that.\" Making a sound of agreement, she stroked his arm. It was an idle, reassuring caress. She was here and would be until the Spring came. \"She'll have to ease up even more in the future, you know.\" \"I do?\" He sounded a little dreamy as he rested his head against hers. \"Why do I know that? The contracts - they're ironclad. We'd have to draw up more and your mother isn't one to easily agree on new terms. You remember how long it took to get her to at least let us see each other during her time.\" \"Well, love, that's a thing. We need to talk. I want you to sit up so I can look at your face while saying this.\" He sat up, confused and a little concerned. \"I hate conversations that start with 'We need to talk.' We've gone over this. What did I do?\" \"We. It's what we did. A lot.\" She wiggled and grabbed one of his hands, dragging it over to rest it on her belly. \"Maybe being a grandmother will soften her up a little more, what do you think?\" Again, she was met with silence. A myriad of emotions played over his face until, at last, his awe-struck eyes filled with tears. \"Persephone, we're going to - you're really - we made -\" She nodded and flattened her hand over his, fingers. \"Yes, Hades, love, after all these centuries. We made life.\" \"Life out of death. Our miracle,\" he whispered before brushing his lips over hers. \"I'll draw up the new contracts.\" She lifted her hand and buried her fingers in his hair, tugging lightly. \"Later. For now, you're mine. All mine.\" She caught his lips for a hungrier kiss. It had been far too long and she didn't want to waste a minute. She never did. The cute must continue. Did I mention I love these two? Because I do. Persephone took so long to get comfortable these days that Hades worried she wasn't getting enough rest at night. It was his fault, of course. Well, she would correct him and remind him that it wasn't entirely his fault. It did take two to create a child, after all. He did his best to ensure that she got a good night's sleep. More often than not, that meant he spent a great many evenings sprawled on the plush chair beside their bed. While not the ideal place to lay his head for the night, he wouldn't complain about any aches or discomfort. He was still near her just in case she needed him. She made a soft sound in her sleep and a brief frown put an adorable wrinkle between her eyebrows.The corners of his lips lifted as he leaned to brushed a loose curl away from her face. She'd had no patience for braiding or binding it tonight. He wasn't going to argue. He liked her loose hair splayed over the pillow. Her expression eased and she let out a dreamy sigh. He wondered what she dreamed about and what fears had caused that frown. There were those he could ask, but his wife's mind was her own and he'd never intrude. Instead, he pushed up from the chair to carefully sit on the edge of the bed. Turning, he stretched his legs out while he sat beside her, his back pressed against the surprisingly comfortable headboard. He stroked her hair and closed his eyes. None of this had ever been planned, but it felt so right. \"What are you humming?\" Her voice was soft and husky from sleep. It did curious things to his insides that he'd rather not acknowledge in her present state. He cleared his throat. \"Humming? I was humming?\" Her eyes slowly opened and she gave him an amused smile. \"Yes, you were. You hardly make music for me. It's a treat and I almost missed it by sleeping through it.\" The chuckle rumbled in his chest as he wound a curl around his finger. Her hair was always so soft. He rested his head back against the headboard. \"Ages ago, I was wandering the Fields and came upon a mother and her daughter. While they felt no pain or true grief, the little one missed her father. Her mother assured her that he'd join them when it was time. Then, she pulled the girl into her arms and that was the lullaby she sang. I've lost the words, but the melody remains.\" Persephone's smile faded. \"Have you seen them since? Has the girl's father joined them at last?\" \"Yes, he did some years later, but for his family, it was like no time had passed at all.\" He rubbed the curl he captured with his thumb, reveling in its texture. \"I'm grateful your mother is making some allowances for us and our child, but -\" His voice caught. \"I wonder how I'll be able to wait for you both while you're away.\" With a soft grunt of effort, she pushed to sit up and scooted against him. He released her hair and wrapped his arm around her shoulders. She reached for his free hand and tangled their fingers together before pressing it to her belly. \"I wonder how we'll be able to wait for you too,\" she whispered. \"But we'll do what we must. We always have.\" He pressed a kiss to the top of her head and closed his eyes. \"So we have. You should go back to sleep, my love. I didn't mean to wake you.\" \"I don't mind. I only mind waking to find you not beside me. Stay with me in bed tonight?\" Her request was drowsy and her head lolled against his shoulder. \"Of course, my jewel. Anything for you.\" He'd never deny her.",

      "His attention achieved, she quickly leaned back when he jerked into awareness.",
      "She'd been on the receiving end of accidental headbutts before.",
      "A nose gushing with blood always killed the mood.",
      "\"Sweetheart, you're home early,\" his rushed words couldn't hide the joy in his tone.",
      "He placed a ragged bookmark between the pages of the tome he was reading before setting it aside with a definite thud on the desk.",
      "\"Light reading?\"",
      "She teased as she combed her fingers through his curls.",
      "\"You're looking a little shaggy, love.",
      "Want me to trim it for you later?\"",
      "He grunted and turned in his chair, reaching for her.",
      "\"Perhaps.",

      "Slipping easily into his arms and onto his lap, she made herself at home and rested her head on his shoulder.",
      "\"I've missed you too.",
      "It seems like the warmer months are lasting longer now.",
      "At least Mother allows us visits.\"",
      "\"Yes, she's getting quite progressive in her dotage,\" he replied dryly, grunting again when she swatted him.",
      "\"I'd tell her you said that, but she might rethink her visitation policy and no one wants that.\"",
      "She wrinkled her nose and drew her legs up to her chest.",
      "His arms tightened around her and he buried his face in her hair, inhaling deeply.",
      "\"No, no one wants that.",
      "Specifically not me.",
      "It's hard enough when you're gone.",
      "Not seeing you at all during those long months -\" His voice trailed.",
      "\"I can't go back to that.\"",
      "Making a sound of agreement, she stroked his arm.",
      "It was an idle, reassuring caress.",
      "She was here and would be until the Spring came.",
      "\"She'll have to ease up even more in the future, you know.\"",
      "\"I do?\"",
      "He sounded a little dreamy as he rested his head against hers.",
      "\"Why do I know that?",
      "The contracts - they're ironclad.",
      "We'd have to draw up more and your mother isn't one to easily agree on new terms.",
      "You remember how long it took to get her to at least let us see each other during her time.\"",
      "\"Well, love, that's a thing.",
      "We need to talk.",
      "I want you to sit up so I can look at your face while saying this.\"",
      "He sat up, confused and a little concerned.",
      "\"I hate conversations that start with 'We need to talk.'",
      "We've gone over this.",
      "What did I do?\" \"We.",
      "It's what we did.",
      "A lot.\"",
      "She wiggled and grabbed one of his hands, dragging it over to rest it on her belly.",
      "\"Maybe being a grandmother will soften her up a little more, what do you think?\" Again, she was met with silence.",
      "A myriad of emotions played over his face until, at last, his awe-struck eyes filled with tears.",
      "\"Persephone, we're going to - you're really - we made -\" She nodded and flattened her hand over his, fingers.",
      "\"Yes, Hades, love, after all these centuries.",
      "We made life.\"",
      "\"Life out of death.",
      "Our miracle,\" he whispered before brushing his lips over hers.",
      "\"I'll draw up the new contracts.\"",
      "She lifted her hand and buried her fingers in his hair, tugging lightly.",
      "\"Later.",
      "For now, you're mine.",
      "All mine.\"",
      "She caught his lips for a hungrier kiss.",
      "It had been far too long and she didn't want to waste a minute.",
      "She never did.",
      "The cute must continue.",
      "Did I mention I love these two?",
      "Because I do.",
      "Persephone took so long to get comfortable these days that Hades worried she wasn't getting enough rest at night.",
      "It was his fault, of course.",
      "Well, she would correct him and remind him that it wasn't entirely his fault.",
      "It did take two to create a child, after all.",
      "He did his best to ensure that she got a good night's sleep.",
      "More often than not, that meant he spent a great many evenings sprawled on the plush chair beside their bed.",
      "While not the ideal place to lay his head for the night, he wouldn't complain about any aches or discomfort.",
      "He was still near her just in case she needed him.",
      "She made a soft sound in her sleep and a brief frown put an adorable wrinkle between her eyebrows.",
      "The corners of his lips lifted as he leaned to brushed a loose curl away from her face.",
      "She'd had no patience for braiding or binding it tonight.",
      "He wasn't going to argue.",
      "He liked her loose hair splayed over the pillow.",
      "Her expression eased and she let out a dreamy sigh.",
      "He wondered what she dreamed about and what fears had caused that frown.",
      "There were those he could ask, but his wife's mind was her own and he'd never intrude.",
      "Instead, he pushed up from the chair to carefully sit on the edge of the bed.",
      "Turning, he stretched his legs out while he sat beside her, his back pressed against the surprisingly comfortable headboard.",
      "He stroked her hair and closed his eyes.",
      "None of this had ever been planned, but it felt so right.",
      "\"What are you humming?\"",
      "Her voice was soft and husky from sleep.",
      "It did curious things to his insides that he'd rather not acknowledge in her present state.",
      "He cleared his throat.",
      "\"Humming?",
      "I was humming?\" Her eyes slowly opened and she gave him an amused smile.",
      "\"Yes, you were.",
      "You hardly make music for me.",
      "It's a treat and I almost missed it by sleeping through it.\"",
      "The chuckle rumbled in his chest as he wound a curl around his finger.",
      "Her hair was always so soft.",
      "He rested his head back against the headboard.",
      "\"Ages ago, I was wandering the Fields and came upon a mother and her daughter.",
      "While they felt no pain or true grief, the little one missed her father.",
      "Her mother assured her that he'd join them when it was time.",
      "Then, she pulled the girl into her arms and that was the lullaby she sang.",
      "I've lost the words, but the melody remains.\"",
      "Persephone's smile faded.",
      "\"Have you seen them since?",
      "Has the girl's father joined them at last?\"",
      "\"Yes, he did some years later, but for his family, it was like no time had passed at all.\"",
      "He rubbed the curl he captured with his thumb, reveling in its texture.",
      "\"I'm grateful your mother is making some allowances for us and our child, but -\" His voice caught.",
      "\"I wonder how I'll be able to wait for you both while you're away.\"",
      "With a soft grunt of effort, she pushed to sit up and scooted against him.",
      "He released her hair and wrapped his arm around her shoulders.",
      "She reached for his free hand and tangled their fingers together before pressing it to her belly.",
      "\"I wonder how we'll be able to wait for you too,\" she whispered.",
      "\"But we'll do what we must.",
      "We always have.\"",
      "He pressed a kiss to the top of her head and closed his eyes.",
      "\"So we have.",
      "You should go back to sleep, my love.",
      "I didn't mean to wake you.\"",
      "\"I don't mind.",
      "I only mind waking to find you not beside me.",
      "Stay with me in bed tonight?\" Her request was drowsy and her head lolled against his shoulder.",
      "\"Of course, my jewel.",
      "Anything for you.\"",
      "He'd never deny her."

Carefully and evenly, with smooth, firm strokes down every inch of our bodies--at least, all the exposed parts. Mama says we have to moisturize once upon waking, once at bedtime, and once during our respective lunch breaks, if we can get away with it. Mama does it at her new job at the bank, and she expects me to do it in the girls' bathroom at my new school, where everyone else is too busy showing off for each other to notice me pull an expensive bottle of skin creme out of my backpack. We're onto Chanel this year, because apparently a little bit of high-end skincare works just as well as a whole tub of the cheap crap Mama used to buy in bulk at Costco. Mama says experience has taught her that sheer quantity of moisturizer can't replace a few hours of exfoliation, anyway, so we might as well start enjoying small doses of \"the good stuff.\" \"It's better this way, Mia,\" she says to me. \"I swear it is. Just two hours of pumice in the morning and one at night, then a dollop of creme, three times a day. Easy peasy, no scales!\" Granmama usually hisses her disapproval when Mama says things like that. But Mama just ignores her and blithely keeps on about how a thousand dollars' worth of lotion will do the trick this time. It'll stick, this time. If I follow this new regimen, maybe I won't have any more slip-ups and we won't have to move again. \"How beautiful you could be,\" Mama often says, \"if you would only do what I do.\" If you'd just try to be what I'm trying to be, is what she really means. \"Don't you want a boy to take you out on a real date?\" Mama asks me. \"With flowers and kissing? Don't you want your hand to be soft when he holds it?\" \"They aren't meant to be soft,\" Granmama always hisses back. \"They serve other purposes.\" \"Get with the times,\" Mama replies, when she's not pretending Granmama doesn't exist. \"We don't need the old ways anymore. Not when we have Chanel!\" Mama says a lot of dumb shit, I guess. * * * Tonight, Mama's sitting at her makeup table, shaking out the last few drops from a $450 bottle of...something. I can't remember if it's the hydration serum, or the one with the deeply penetrating microbeads, or the one with a single rose petal floating in micellar water. Mama taps the bottom of the bottle three times, until a little droplet of something oily and golden oozes onto her palm. She smears the liquid between her hands, warming it up so that it spreads easier across her throat, where her gular scales are just starting to shimmer back into place. \"Got a date with that Pearson boy tonight?\" she asks my reflection in the vanity mirror. I nod from where I'm standing behind her and absently scratch at the skin of my forearm. Mama notices the movement and heaves a big sigh. She spins around on her vanity stool and sets to rubbing her still-oily hands along my arm, pressing hard, angry scrubs from my wrist to my elbow and gentle, clockwise swipes on the delicate skin below my wrist. \"You're moulting,\" she chides, giving my other arm a rub for good measure. \"Did you moisturize at lunch today?\" I nod again, even though it's a lie. I haven't lotioned my skin in at least two days--not since Cole Pearson asked me out on a date. I haven't sloughed or exfoliated or pumiced, either. You can't really tell yet that I've stopped following Mama's beauty regimen. I'm a lot younger than Mama and ages younger than Granmama, so my scales are barely visible right now. In the nighttime shadows, they could almost be a trick of the light. Body glitter or highlighting powder, maybe, if you don't know what you're looking for. Cole Pearson definitely doesn't know what he's looking for. \"He seems nice,\" Mama says, almost as if she can sense the direction of my thoughts. She finishes with my arms and spins back around, away from me. \"He has pretty eyes.\" She meets my gaze again in the mirror for confirmation. I grin. \"Pretty mouth, too,\" I agree. Mama smiles back. From the way her eyes crinkle in the corners, warm and sly, I can tell she thinks we're having a moment--we're being conspiratorial. We are, I guess, but not for the reasons Mama thinks. She wouldn't approve of what I want to do to Cole Pearson. But Granmama sure would. \"Speaking of Cole,\" I say, leaning forward to give Mama a quick peck on her crown of bright red hair. \"I gotta go. He's meeting me outside the movie theater in about twenty minutes.\" Mama frowns in the mirror. \"He's not picking you up?\" \"Nah.\" I shrug and try very hard to suppress another grin--it'll look way too predatory this time. \"I told Cole I'd just meet him there. That way I don't have to rely on him to get home, if the date flames out.\" \"Flames out,\" Mama scoffs, but her gaze is already drifting down to her vast array of potions and salves. \"It won't flame out, Mia. Not with the way you say his name.\" I can't help the slight twitch at the corner of my lips. \"And how is that, Mama?\" \"Cole,\" she sighs dreamily. \"Cole, Cole, Cole.\" Inside, I feel nothing like what her flirty imitation suggests. But I'm sure as hell not going to tell her that. \"Let your mother have her fun,\" Granmama advised me a long time ago, when we first moved to the New World. \"Let her pretend like we're something we aren't, if that's what she wants. But you should be what you are, Mia. Do what we were created to do.\" Granmama remembers the dawntimes, when her name was still Echidna--the days of Hera and Zeus, and the wailing of children. She remembers when Mama was created, and when I was, and she can tell me stories about a time when beauty wasn't purchased but won over with blood and feasting and fear. A time when our kind had only scales, and jaws that could unhinge to devour the whole damned world if we wanted it badly enough. Now Mama has Chanel and a job and the occasional boyfriend, whenever we settle in a town long enough for her to meet people. Mama has delusion and hope and a daily skincare regimen that lasts a minimum of six hours. Mama likes faking human. She says humans are interesting. Says that they're worth getting to know, outside of the feast--that they're beautiful. Mama says a lot of dumb shit. As I leave the house--a tiny clapboard rental on the edge of town with a wide front porch and two bedrooms that will surely be empty by tomorrow afternoon--I give an extra foot-stomp of hello upon the porch floorboards. Granmama thumps back a hello from underneath. These days, she isn't in the hunting business. She just curls up somewhere warm and dry each time we move, content to wait out Mama's millionth attempt to make us into something we're not. Tonight, Granmama adds an extra rattle of approval to go along with the thump. Maybe it's because she can taste the scent of my skin on the night air, free of everything but the thin layer of crap Mama rubbed on my arms. Maybe Granmama can hear the scratch of my nails against the ventral scales just starting to reemerge on my neck as I move across the porch. Maybe she can sense just how beautiful I truly am. How much more beautiful I'll be, once I've made quick work of Cole Pearson. \"Humans are so lovely,\" Mama always argues. \"Humanity's worth being a part of, worth knowing.\" \"Our kind?\" Granmama always counters. \"We're at our most beautiful when we're satiated.\" I guess, when it comes down to it, I agree more with Granmama. After all, she says a lot of smart shit.",

This building is the heart of the corporation. This is the place where all operations are managed, this houses all the employees, all meetings are held here. From the name of the business, Aeaea, it is hard to tell what the company is occupied with, what the thousands of enthusiastic minions of it do. It's an agency, specialized in accommodations and the entertainer market. They book hotels, reserve tables, in the biggest secrecy or with the whole wild world knowing, depends on the customer. They have relationships with luxury hotels, apartment houses and cheap motels too. They choose the best to suit your request, be the request a place to have lovely vacation, a place to sort out a conflict between criminal organizations, a place to fake a death or fake living while you're killing yourself. They trade out business cards and names to everyone's interest. Their clients differ from one another, but all of them powerful in some way. Some have power from money, some have power from politics, some have power from fame. This is how they're financing the giant building of Aeaea. They have exclusive sources and not just for money. No one knows who works at the company. Extremely career oriented people, that's for sure. Educated and elegant people who spend all their days and nights in the building of Aeaea, just working and working creating money and money only. These people leave their friends, their houses, their marriages, everything as they slowly became one with the Aeaea. However, none of them seems to have a problem with their employer. Almost none of them. When the company holds press conferences or looks for employees - they are always looking for new people - everyone looks content and cared for. Its image radiates beauty and high class. It's flashy and perfect. Naturally, there are some nasty rumors about Aeaea. A particularly nosy reporter found some half-eaten raw meat that was most likely the chew toy of the giant dog-wolves, which guarded the building from unwanted guests. The big dogs are also a reason for concern in particular circles. That's basically the only thing that makes people question the awesomeness of Aeaea. That and a man called Odysseus. The big Odysseus scandal happened after an employee left the company and went to the newspapers to tell them all the ugliness he, in theory, experienced. His story went viral. He talked about shady deals, criminals, the agency they worked with regularly, he talked about torture and murder. He talked about beasts, monstrosities kept in the basement, creatures that did the dirty job of cleaning up the bodies of undisciplined employees and the casualties that occurred at their events. According to him the only reason he shared his story was to save everyone from Aeaea and its CEO, Circe, but it became his downfall too. Circe looks for him. He knows. He knows, when there are people in suits in front of his home. He knows she is after him, when there are no one else on the streets but him and his ex-colleagues, dozens of them. He understands it's going to be his death, when they start marching towards him, but they don't touch him just surround him, pushing him in the city for almost an hour, and he realizes they are leading him to the Aeaea building. In the Aeaea Parking Garage he is left alone. Suddenly, the hundreds of people are gone and it's only the noise of high heels getting closer. Circe stands in her grey suit outfit, formal as ever, a few co-workers at her side, and she smiles to him. Around her eyes the grin carves place for wrinkles. Even those look like snakes trying to leave her face to be able to serve her. Odyssey in theory knows what is going to happen but he is still somehow amazed when the elegant business people at Circe's side shed their suits, skins and human features and turn into the monsters he mostly saw in his nightmares. He's aware of his chances. Running and fighting is unnecessary and impossible. The beasts are at his feet in seconds, biting, pushing their claws into him, and he almost wastes the time he has to let out a shout of pain, by being surprised, before another monster goes for his throat. Almost. The last thing he sees, before getting pulled into dark oblivion, is the face of a calm and collected Circe. Odyssey ran away from her once and it seems with that, he wasted the one miracle he earned in his life. He fears the beasts are only tearing him apart for torture and they won't actually kill him. He fears tomorrow he is going to wake up and be like the monsters which are currently feasting on him. His fears are not without reason. Tomorrow he's going to walk into the building of Aeaea, smile at his co-workers and the stunned reporters, he is going to take his place at his desk and work for his boss, for Circe of Aeaea.",

She can smell the yellow tang of sweat beneath their perfume. Of course, they all wear the same perfume, musky and so strong she thinks she can taste it at the back of her throat. \"It will help,\" says Atropos, her voice low and insistent. When she leans in close, the ends of her myriad long braids tickle Eurydice's arms. Eurydice narrows her eyes at them. \"How?\" Her voice is flat. They laugh, almost in unison. It would be eerie if she had the energy to be unnerved by it right now. \"It will help you to forget,\" says Clotho, and they all laugh again. After that, it turns out, Eurydice does not need much persuading. * She drinks until the world falls out from under her. The feeling of wrongness is still sitting like a hollow ball in the pit of her stomach. * Persephone intercepts the Fates before they reach Hades' office. There's a girl with them; a scrap of a thing with mussed hair and torn clothes. The grime of the factory is on her face. Her eyes flicker lazily half open, then shut again. Her head lolls against Lachesis' shoulder. Three things occur to Persephone in very quick succession. One: the girl is very, very drunk. The kind of drunk that robs your speech and turns your bones to water. Two: she's familiar. The singer's girl. Three: the Fates are bringing her to Hades. Drunk. At night. They'll have their own reasons for serving her up like a bloody offering, Persephone knows, but just now she doesn't give a fuck about their reasons. \"What is this?\" Her voice emerges in a low growl. The Fates look at one another. They aren't fazed. \"Mr. Hades sent for her,\" says Clotho. Her voice is high and hoarse and it grates right on Persephone's nerves. Persephone forces herself to let out a long, slow breath. \"I can take this from here,\" she says, and smiles. It's a particular talent of hers: smiling even when she feels sick to her stomach. * When Eurydice wakes, the boss man's wife is watching her. \"You,\" the other woman says, her voice rough with some emotion she can't identify, \"are an idiot.\" Eurydice squeezes her eyes tight shut. When she tries to speak, she manages only a thin, wordless whimper. \"I can't help you like this again,\" says the Lady of the Underground in the same strange, fraught voice. \"You need to watch yourself.\" The words, when they come, are scratchy and indistinct. \"They told me it would help me forget.\" \"Forget what, exactly? Him? Orpheus?\" The words stick in Eurydice's throat like tiny broken twigs: \"No,\" she says. \"Hades.\"",

    "text": "A mansion towered above the small, ancient and ruined village below in its shadow. A permanent fog shrouded the abandoned ruins giving it an eerie, tense atmosphere. You wandered up the path to the ruins and looked around the buildings, finding abandoned items and furniture inside the fragile walls. It was odd to think an entire village evacuated for no documented reason. You shrugged and continued into the milky fog, holding your hands out in front of you for any obstacles. You made it to the incline, leading to the mansion on the hill. You climbed the incline without really thinking about it. You wondered to yourself if the mansion owner decided to evacuate as well. The tall, dark wooden doors were... unnerving. You held your arm, staring at it many moments without moving. You knocked on the door. Silence answered. You pushed the door open and walked inside, looking around. The mansion was well kept, the furniture was Victorian and gothic. You kinda enjoyed how it looked. \"Someone must still live here...\" You muttered under breath. The wind billowed and caught on your coat, shutting the door behind you. You gasped, covering your mouth. The stairs ahead of you illuminated to reveal a tall, angular figure descending the steps. \"And yet you still intrude.\" He sighed, disappointment tainting his words. You stepped back. \"I-I'm sorry to intrude, I didn't know this place was-\" \"You don't enter another person's house without permission, young one. Where are your manners?\" He scolded. You paused, bowing slightly to him out of respect. He stood before you, towering over you. \"I'm sorry...\" You said, keeping your eyes down. \"I suppose I can let it be...,\" He took your hand and looked you over, sniffing quietly as he kissed your knuckles, \"I am Vlad. Count Vlad Dracul.\" \"I... I'm ____.\" You answered back, blushing at how close he was. He straightened and turned away from you, his cape flourishing and caressing his thin frame elegantly. \"Do you have anywhere to stay for the night?\" He purred. You shook your head and followed him up the stairs. \"N-no, not for tonight.\" You responded. He chuckled and took your hand sweetly, his grip was so gentle. He brought you down the hall to an empty room with a grand, canopy bed. You stared at it, surprised to see anything so elegant in your life. \"You can rest here until morning... but then you leave, understood?\" He warned. You nodded. \"Yes! Of course, thank you!\" You beamed, going into the room and looking around. Vlad watched you prance around the room and chuckled, shaking his head, leaving you be. You jumped into the bed and fell into a deep and sweet sleep. The night was empty of dreams, an odd occurrence for you, but it didn't bother you. The next morning, you sat up and stretched, feeling amazingly refreshed. You went to the window and opened the drapes, frowning when the light failed to break the heavy mass of clouds. \"So stormy... that's lame.\" You sighed, closing the drapes back up. \"Oh? I prefer the storm.\" Vlad chuckled from behind you. You flinched and turned to him, keeping a grip on the dangling cloth. \"I didn't hear you come in.\" \"I didn't let you.\" \"Right... thank you for letting me stay, Count Dracul. How can I repay you?\" You offered, taking your wallet from your bag. Vlad stepped beside you, placing a hand on your shoulder. You stiffened, straightening yourself swiftly. He leaned down slightly, taking another quiet sniff, bringing his fingers through your hair. \"Perhaps you can, my dear... Tell me. Are you willing to... let me feed?\" He asked, his breath billowing over your neck, making you shiver. You gripped the edge of your shirt, you could almost feel yourself dripping. \"I... I guess you could do that...~\" You mewed, tilting your head aside. He pressed his lips to your neck, placing soft, sweet kisses on your skin. Teasing you, tasting your skin. \"Hm... You're not a virgin...\" He muttered disappointedly, pulling back from you. You stiffened and looked up at him. \"W-what? H-how would you know that?\" You asked, blushing red. \"I can smell it on you... I was hoping it was just me, but you're not fresh.\" He sighed, going out the door, \"I don't drink tainted blood.\" He waved you out of the room dismissively. You stumbled out and down the stairs, shooed away by the now obvious vampire. You grabbed the doorframe and confronted him, forcefully. \"No! Wait, I just...!\" You stammered, trying to find the words. He raised a brow at you and folded his arms. \"I... I imagine it's been ages since you just had a good hang, right? Without the worry of caring for a newly turned Vampire?\" You coaxed, opening his cape and pulling it behind his shoulders. He took your wrists, shaking his head, smiling faintly. \"You're oddly desperate about this, ____.\" He snickered, restricting you easily. You frowned, whining childishly at him. \"I am...!\" You squeaked. He hummed and brought you to his couch, sitting you down carefully. Despite what he was, he was very gentlemanly, very sweet. You enjoyed being around him more than you initially thought. He looked you in your eyes, brushing your bangs behind your ears. The light in his eyes was entirely missing, his pearly fangs poked from under his lips slightly. \"My dear... I have learned that it's best to forget mortality than having the best of it teased one millennium and abandoned the next. I craved human blood, but I don't need it, and it's better I don't get it from you. You're not pure... that means you have someone at home waiting for you... correct?\" He spoke in a soft voice, a certain pain staining his words. You almost teared up at his laments, cupping his cheek, studying his face deeply. \"N... No... I don't have anyone waiting for me...\" You whispered, brushing your thumb over his skin. \"Did he perish? My sincerest apologies...\" He offered. You laughed and tossed your hand jokingly. \"It was in college! I didn't even know the guy, it's no big deal.\" You explained, giggling. Vlad was terribly confused, but it seemed to make him a little happier to hear you were available. He pulled you closer to him, his face dangerously close to yours. \"Well... I want something more permanent than that. If you're willing.\" He purred, nipping your ear with his pointed teeth. You shivered, wrapping your arms around his neck. \"I'm more than willing...~\" You smiled, kissing him deeply, raking your hand through his slick black hair. You brushed your tongue over his fangs, exploring his mouth before he took over and forced you down on the couch, pinning your arms above your head. You pressed your leg against his side and gasped as he bucked slightly into you, wrapping your legs around him. Vlad tossed his clothes aside, revealing a slender, fit chest scattered his scars. He started peeling away your clothes, having trouble with your bra. You giggled helping him with it and tossing it in with his on the floor. He caressed your body, kissing down your chest and sucking on your tits. You squirmed, moaning, gripping the armrest slightly. He massaged the other one, rubbing himself against you. He was almost desperate to have you, piercing your flesh with his fangs as he nipped all over you. He brought his teeth to your neck, biting you as he slid inside. You were silenced, your muscles tensing greatly. He drank from you, pumping inside you swiftly. Your mind wandered, spinning around the room. He rocked the couch, pounding you hard, panting in your ears when he pulled back for breath. Your entire body trembled every muscle tightening. Your depths clamped on his member, coaxing a deep groan from Vlad. He licked your wound, blood dripping down his chin. You struggled, your legs holding him close to you. He kept you pinned to the couch, driving himself farther into you. The entire combination made you feel euphoric, random murmurs leaving your throat, soft begging for more. He gave into your requests and slammed harder into you, groaning loudly. You loved his noises, the breaths that grazed your bite made you shiver every time. \"V-Vlad, please..~!\" You cried, arching sharply. He buried his face into your breast and came inside you, replacing his hand around you, pressing your back into him, keeping you in place. You both collapsed, breathing heavily, sweating. He rolled and brought you onto his chest, panting. You were completely limp, purring quietly when he pet your hair. \"You're mine now, my dear... I hope you enjoy your stay...\" He murmured, looking down at you lovingly. You nodded and took his hand, kissing it softly. You both fell asleep, exhausted, spent, in love. The bright shine of the giant, full disc in the deep midnight sky brightened the forest around a small, lonely village. Howls of creatures in the night put everyone on edge for fear the beast would find their village again. The women of the village were stolen every full moon, leaving only the elderly or the very young to keep up the population. This moon, they hid away their women, watching carefully for the beast. The men carried swords, pitchforks, and torches, watching the illuminated shadows. Despite their barricade, the beast slunk behind the cabin where the women hid. He took a deep inhale and dug his way inside. The women shrieked, alerting the men outside. The beast growled, scanning the group quickly and snatching a curvy, beautiful lady. He broke through the wall, scooping up the lady and racing through the forest. She screamed, clinging to his fur and clawing her way out of his grasp. He grabbed her pressing her to his taut, powerful chest. She paused, stiffening. His loud heart pounded by your ear, his large muscles, hidden by fur, flexing and providing her with more than enough reason to panic. She couldn't, though... She didn't want to panic. The wolf looked down at her, laying her in the bushes and panting, his wide tongue lulling out of his mouth. She reached up slowly and pet the bloody, matted fur on his face. He closed his eyes, leaning into her touch sweetly, raising his claw and holding her hand. \"Y... You're not eating me...?\" She asked, nervously. He scanned her face, licking her nose softly. She giggled, nudging his muzzle away. He made a half smile, his fluffy tail wagging. The beast curled himself around her and covered her with his tail, allowing himself to sleep. She looked around a little upset. The night was almost out, and he would rather sleep than try anything on her. She sighed, folding her arms. \"Are you alright?\" The beast rumbled, opening one eye to look up at her. She flinched and shook her head. \"N-no... not really... I was expecting more than this.\" She admitted, petting his tail. He lifted his muzzle and laid it in her lap, licking her leg sweetly. \"How about we get to know each other first? I'm Cerberus. You?\" He offered, trying to get her mind off of that. She pursed her lips. \"_____.\" She answered simply. He smiled and closed his eyes again. \"Better. Goodnight.\" He mumbled. She whined, tugging his ear. \"I want you to have me!\" She barked. He raised his brow, sighing and sitting up to meet her eye level. \"You wouldn't want that... not with a beast. Wait until morning, I'll be human again. Then we can be together in every way.\" He chuckled. She frowned, shaking her head. \"N-no, I want the beast. It so much... more.\" She encouraged. Cerberus laid back on the tree, his claw on her shoulder. He took his tail off her and traced her body, making rounded symbols with his nails. She shivered, straightening against his chest and reaching up to pet his fur. \"What are you doing...~?\" She mewed quietly. He licked her neck and gripped her sides slightly. \"I'm preventing the curse,... I don't want you to change, like I.\" He muttered, his careful, sweet tone helped her relax. \"Thank you, Cerberus...~\" She purred, shifting her weight. He took her rags off and cupped her breasts in his large paws, nuzzling her neck. She groaned softly, pressed to his back. Cerberus slipped his paw down her stomach and teased her lips, growling softly, smirking at her sharp gasp. He rubbed her clit between his claws, making her moist and wet, getting a little excited every time she moaned sweetly. Cerberus pushed her down on her hands and knees, towering over her, pressing himself to her entrance. She put her hands on top of his, wiggling her fingers and tangling them in the fur, smiling faintly. He thrust in sharply, his thick piece stretching her open. She cried out, lowering her head into the grass. Cerberus slide into the hilt, groaning softly. He bucked sharply, knocking against her edge with ease. \"Nn... I haven't done this as a beast before...\" He grunted, licking her neck and nipping lightly. She pet his cheek, smiling wide. \"You should do it more often.\" She giggled. He nodded, giving a breathless laugh and rocking faster, his tongue hanging out. Cerberus's knot thickened quickly, tapping her chasm with his quick, shallow bucks. He groaned, his muscular chest grinding her back, making her warm in the cold forest night. He sat back and pulled her into his lap, ramming up into her, panting. His tail wagged beneath him, his knot teasing her, threatening to enter. She gripping his fur, moaning loudly, crying his name. Cerberus's knot finally pierced her, clogging her hole. She gasped, arching as he howled, his come filling her to the brim, making her feel so full. He panted, attempting to pull out and whimpering when he realized his knot was stuck. She giggled, petting his chest. \"Don't worry, it'll go down.\" She smiled. He kissed her softly, nuzzling her neck. \"I know...\" He whined softly. He was finally able to pull out about an hour later, spilling her mixture out onto the grass. She sighed lovingly, rolling her head back and relaxing in his lap. Cerberus did the same, his head resting against the tree. He closed his eyes, his tail wagged weakly, he was too relaxed to make it stop or wag any harder. She pet him until she passed out, sleeping soundly on his chest. He held her close, smiling faintly. \"I love you, ____... Goodnight~\" Centaurs are a strong, powerful race. They ruled over the forests with fearless iron strokes and wooden rods shot from their bows. They were warriors, but they remained timid around humans. Many assumed they just wished to be left alone, others assumed they were afraid to cause any accidental damage. You stretched and looked over at the Centaur's fence. It was barbed and tall, protecting their woods from the reckless humans. You sighed. You believe you saw a centaur once a long while ago. He was tall, muscular, with a full mane of deep wine red hair. He was a paint, a white horse with dapples of mocha and chocolate. He held an iron and wooden bow painted to resemble his fur. \"Hey!\" Someone shouted at you. You looked over at your friend, Gale. He raced up to you, panting, collapsing in the grass. \"Hey... ack... Hey, you still wanna go see the monsters?\" He smiled, holding the key to the centaur's gate. You squealed excitedly, taking the key. \"Oh my god, Gale! I can't believe you actually got it!\" You beamed. He laughed, sitting up and shaking his head, dust flying off his locks. You brought him to the gate, unlocking it. The fence opened slowly, the dark expanses of forest stretching far before them. \"D... Do you want to come with me?\" You offered. Gale paused and shook his head. \"N-no, I'm good. I'll be here to unlock the gate when you get back though.\" He smiled. You nodded and ran inside, hearing the rusty gate shut behind you. The darkness soon melted into bright alcoves filled with beasts of equine nature. They were magnificent, beautiful. You watched them wander their village, living their life when the beast you swore you saw outside the forest trotted out with their bow. He joined a group of males, all with weapons. You assumed it was a hunting party and climbed a tree to stay hidden. They raced past you, giving a hearty cry. The wine colored one didn't follow as closely, he seemed unenthused. You were curious, hugging the branch. You could've sworn his deep green eyes landed on you, you were stunned by their beauty, freezing straight as they went beneath you like a stampede. They rushed away, leaving a majority of the clearing barren. You jumped down and snuck behind the makeshift houses. It was safe back there, which was good. You stayed for the majority of the day, waiting for the wine stallion to return. The stallion returned much later, going into the grove behind you and laying by himself. You slowly approached him, quiet. \"You don't have to sneak around.\" He muttered. You flinched, sitting beside him. \"Okay then.\" You pouted. He glanced at you and folded his arms. \"Who are you, human? What are you doing here?\" He questioned, raising a brow at you. You lowered your head and hummed. \"I was just curious is all.\" You answered. The wine stallion looked around and nodded. \"Well, I'll let you stay for a price.\" The centaur said as he stood. You looked up at him. \"What's the price?\" You asked, standing as well. The centaur smirked and took your hand, pulling you to his torso. You blushed, looking up at him. \"Easy, let me have you tonight~\" He chuckled. \"What?\" \"You can stay in my home while you stay, but every night you stay, I get to have sex with you.\" He explained. You grew even more flushed, looking at his large body and pulling away slightly. \"I-I don't think I should...\" You stammered. He shrugged and trotted away. \"Then they'll deal with you.\" He stated simply. You raced after him. \"A-Alright! Fine, I'll do it... but what's your name?\" You asked, folding your arms, pouting. He chuckled and held a hand out to you. You let him have your hand. \"I am Oracryn.\" He stated, kissing your knuckles and smirking. He brought you to his home, closing the shade for what privacy you could get. He picked you up, wrapping your legs around his waist. He kissed you deeply, peeling your clothes away as he did. You were bare against his skin, your skin heating up everywhere you two touched. He set you down and purred. \"Bend over~\" He smirked. You did as you were told, bending over, hanging onto the table before you. He reared his hoofs over, bracing himself. You gasped, the large piece under the horse part of his body pressing against your opening. You didn't think he would be using that piece on you. Though, you weren't sure which piece his kind had at first. He thrust it into you, stretching you wide, filling you as much as possible. You cried out, gripping the wooden table tightly. He groaned, smiling down at you. \"You're definitely so much tighter than a mare-woman.\" He smirked. You panted, gasping as he started to buck sharply into you. He only fit half of his piece inside you, but it didn't matter to you and him. He pulled back and slid into you, slamming your edge with ease. His giant member kinda hurt when it hit you, but the fit felt so good. \"Ah...! O-Oracryn!\" You cried out, tensing and panting heavily. He rolled his head back and bucked harder, grabbing your wrists to hold you up. He angled his thrusts, slamming your pussy, stretching your stomach as he did. You struggled slightly, moaning loudly. Oracryn poured his gallons into you, pulling out and spilling the rest of it onto the floor, coating your leg in his milky fluid. He panted, laying in his straw nest flicking his tail. You laid motionlessly on the mounting table, shaking. \"You can lay with me, dear...\" He sighed, patting the place next to him. You stumbled over to him and flopped beside him. He wrapped his arms around you and cuddled you sweetly. You smiled, kissing his cheek before sleeping. Mako is an OC of mine, a reaper skeleton who is 7ft tall with 12 ft wingspan. His eye lights are green and his scythe has engravings on the blade. The fields outside Venobane stretched miles, grass illuminated as it waved in the wind, making the expanse shine. The great mountain housed the small cabin of a rogue Reaper. He lived alone, he worked alone. You heard many stories about the creature, curious as to what it looked like. No one, save the dead, ever actually saw the being. You assumed he was a spirit, like a ghoul, more spectral than anything else. Possibly glowing so he could see where he was going in the dark. You laughed softly at the thought, erasing stray lines from your sketch of the spectrum. You imagined he would look like he was rotting, then you imagined he would look gaseous. Basically, there were too many possibilities, and you tried to draw them all. You sighed and set the sketchbook aside. A scramble of different elements clashing horribly in lineart alone. \"Ugh... I need to take a break...\" You huffed, upset. You walked out on the town. City lights blinded the night, scaring the stars from the sky leaving a blank, dark blanket of nothing. The sounds of traffic and loud, bass heavy music drowned out the natural sounds of nature. It upset you even more than your lack of inspiration. You grabbed your motor bike and aimed for the great woods where the reaper was said to live. You got on to the highway, riding silently, your thoughts wandering. The loud blare of vehicle horns broke your thoughts. You flinched, looking up at the blinding headlights of an oncoming truck. You screamed before everything went silent. (That's the end, what are you still doing here?) (Alright, I'm kidding. Here you go.) You awoke with a start, screaming and shooting upright, looking around to find yourself in a small, wooden cabin. The furnishings were comfortable and simple. The home looked barely lived in. The bed you laid in was neat and small, soft covers in shades of minty green ensconced you. You stood slowly, dropping the sheets around you, wondering if it was all just a dream. The room around you held many recently used items. Mangas strewed a messy desk, half of them you couldn't read the titles of, the other half you could tell the contents of just by seeing the bare women on their covers. You snickered to yourself, reaching to take one of the hentai mangas. \"Oh, you're awake.\" A voice said monotonously. The voice made you drop the book. \"Who said that?\" You asked as you spun, looking for the source. A tall cloaked figure stood in the faint candle light of the cabin. His hood covered his face, large skeletal wings folded neatly behind him. You gasped softly, stepping back, panicking. \"Oh my god, what are you!?\" You shrieked. \"Calm down, or I'm kicking you out.\" He warned, walking past you and making the bed you mindlessly unraveled. \"W-what are you though...?\" You asked again. He scoffed quietly, peeling his hood back and looking at you. The lights in his skull focused on you, the cracks running down his cheeks glowed faintly with the souls of those he's captured trapped in an eternity flowing as a personal magic through his bones. \"I'm a reaper.\" He answered simply, folding his arms. You studied him, pursing your lips slightly. He stared at you, silent, growing impatient. \"I gotta say, I'm disappointed.\" You admitted. \"By what?\" He frowned. \"You're so simple...\" You sighed. The Reaper raised his uncanny and expressive brow at your statement, his wings twitching. \"Simple?\" \"You're just a skeleton! I was hoping for whisps and colors and... well... complexity.\" You explained. He shook his head slowly, walking past you. You could hear a ghostly chuckle as he passed you. A shine of emerald green flitted through the room, the source behind you making odd noises. \"How is this then?\" He asked. You turned and stood stunned, finding the tall skeleton changed into a sickly green, flesh dropping undead. You flinched, stepping away. \"I prefer the other form...\" You whined. He changed back, the flash blinding you, hiding his transformative secrets from you. \"You can call me Mako,\" He opened the dark wooden door for you, gesturing outside, \"I can take you home.\" You remembered what you thought you had dreamt. \"Wait, did the truck actually hit me?\" You finally asked. Mako smirked, closing the door. \"I thought you had forgotten. Yes. You were hit. Your soul is pretty powerful, though. I didn't find it fit to take it from you.\" He seemed unfazed by the whole situation. You wondered if he did this often, and if so, why? \"O...kay... do you know where I live?\" You changed the subject. Mako leaned on the wall, glancing at the frame beside him. He took a moment to fix it before answering you. \"I don't... I took you from your funeral.\" \"Then why would you take me home?\" \"You're going to your new home. Ilfalia.\" He took his scythe, bracing it before your neck. You gulped, leaning away from the cold metal, \"If you don't want to go there, I could always take you myself.\" \"M-maybe we could work something out? I-I like it here....\" You muttered. Mako paused, lowering his scythe. \"Y-you do..?\" He asked. You watched his stone, mental wall crack at that statement. \"O-of course... It's really nice here.\" You reiterated. Mako looked you over, spying the table of books behind you. He smirked and snapped his fingers. \"Then I have a proposal for you.\" \"Name it.\" \"You can stay if you reenact my books with me.\" He offered. You knew exactly what he meant, blushing and pointing at the dark robes on his body. \"C-can you even do any of that?\" You asked. Mako nodded, a wide smile stretching his skull. He pulled his robe off and showed you exactly what his captured souls did for him. He manipulated the deep green, almost liquid substance to exit from his fingers, coiling it on his back and on the front of his pelvis. Lengthy, slimy tendrils whipped from his back, gripping your wrists and raising you into the air. He hummed and toyed with the sensitive piece at his base. \"What do you prefer? Long or thick?\" He smirked. Your mind was blanking, you couldn't believe what this creature of death was doing to you. \"I... I don't...\" \"Aw, blanking? Hehe, I'll just do both~\" He decided, molding his piece into the perfect size for you. He took your hips and lulled his long green tongue out of his sharp jaw, licking up your body as he thrust roughly into you. You gasped, his large piece stretching you as he pushed himself in without hesitation. His tentacles trailed down your stomach, teasing your clit and entering your behind. You struggled against the feeling, uncomfortable with the tentacle writhing in your crevice. You let a choked moan when he pulled back and slammed back in, grunting happily. He dropped you onto him, chuckling at your squeaking reactions. His motions were harsh and unforgiving on your tender pussy. His appendage slipped deeper into your behind, writhing. You grit your teeth and arched, pressing against his rib cage. \"Oh? Do you like that..~?\" He chuckled bouncing you harder. You mewed sweetly. \"Y-yes! Yes, I love it! Ahhh...\" You broke, begging for more. Mako laid you down in his bed and railed you like no other. His long, iridescent tongue hung out of his mouth. His heavy, lustful breaths brushing your neck. You stared into his deep darkened depths, watching his green flames flicker over your body, watching every creamy inch bounce under him. \"M-mako...! I-I'm gonna come...\" You panted, arching and tightening as the waves of heat crashed over you. Mako groaned loudly, releasing his reaper liquid into you. His strange, effective biology driving you to the most intense orgasm you could remember, stealing your thoughts and catching your breath. When your mind returned, Mako was collapsed beside you, his wings twitching. You glanced at him, panting, smiling. \"You alright?\" You asked with a light laugh. He nodded silently, face down in his pillows. \"I don't want to move...\" He muttered. \"I can't feel my legs, haha.\" You snickered, rolling onto your side and wrapping an arm around him. \"Good.\" He huffed, his body relaxed to the point of paralysis. You hummed and dragged your finger along his spine. \"Mind if I sleep here?\" \"Of course not... You can stay here as long as you like.\" He offered. Mako finally urged himself to meet your face with a chaste kiss, smiling. You nuzzled his neck and curled up happily, sleeping soundly beside him. The colossal mountains above you stretched tall enough to tear the sky. You watched the rolling storm approach, thunder cracking deep in its heart. The flashes of light illuminated the grand wingspan of a ferocious and gigantic beast perched atop the earthy claws. You glanced up at the figure, wrapping your arms around yourself as the echoing roar rang throughout the valley. Your village was right in its grasp. The beast soared overhead, his shimmering blue scales shining in the ephemeral light cracking in the heavens. You gasped at the sight, though terrifying, it was amazingly beautiful. The beast vanished in the mass of clouds, leaving you dumbfounded. You trained for years to scale that mountain and slay the beast. You would be a great hero if you succeeded. The thought always brought you joy, making you feel light and important. You had no idea how it would end... The day finally came that you would attempt the dangerous incline to the lizard's lair. You looked up to the great height, unwavering, determined. The first step would be challenging, but swift. (let's skip the climbing because that isn't important right now.) You reached the top of the mountain, welcomed by the sight of a grand nest with scattered bones lying in the branches and hay bales. A small gasp escaped your lips. The dragon was sleeping at the far edge, his body rising and falling calmly with each deep breath. Your feet brought you to it's back without meaning to. His scales glimmered with tints of blue and purple. The dark, bumpy surface was warm to the touch. You smiled faintly, studying the beautiful tints. \"What are you doing?\" The creature rumbled, raising his head and looking at you. You flinched slightly, stepping away from him. He got to his feet, his icy eyes studying you. His claws bore into the straw of his nest making holes. You couldn't find your voice, simply staring up at the beautiful creature. \"I-I was.... I just...\" You stammered. \"Did you think you could slay me?\" He chuckled, batting your sword away. You let him knock it off the mountain, backing away as much as you could. He brought his face right up to yours, his forked tongue tasting the air. \"I wanted to claim your beauty.\" You admitted. He raised his brow. \"'Claim my beauty'?\" He threw his head back and laughed, the ground rumbling with his boisterous laugh. You felt your cheeks get really warm, you were embarrassed. \"D-Don't laugh at me!\" \"How did you intend to do that?\" He asked, resting his head on his claw. You pursed your lips, folding your arms. \"I'll figure it out! I don't need a sword to claim things!\" You stamped your foot, defiantly standing your ground against the bully of a lizard. He yawned and pushed you onto your ass. He stood to his full height, he was maybe 9 feet tall. Muscular and lean like an aviary lizard should be. \"How about I claim you myself, human?\" He smirked, stretching his wings and blocking the sun. You shielded your eyes from the sharp glint. \"What!?\" He dragged you to the back of his nest and pinned your wrists to the floor. You struggled slightly, blushing terribly. \"N-no! I won't let a dragon take me!\" You claimed, struggling. \"Hnn, you don't mean that.\" He mewed, blowing a small puff of smoke at you. You coughed and looked away from him. He dragged a claw down your body and cut your clothes off, peeling them off you. He was careful not to scar your clear skin, smiling faintly. \"Just what I want in a mate~\" He chuckled. You closed your eyes, trying not to give in. \"Stop it!\" You begged. The dragon licked up your neck, erupting shivers down your body. \"Hm, No. Why should I?\" He hummed. \"Because I don't want this!\" You barked. \"I didn't want to die but you were going to do that to me.\" He returned simply. \"But this is torture!\" \"It's only torture with intent to kill. I'm keeping you.\" \"Why?\" \"Why do you ask so many questions!? Just open up!\" He roared, spreading your legs about as far as you could spread. You watched his giant, throbbing piece rub against your opening, moistening you slightly. He thrust into you sharply, tearing your fresh womanhood. You cried out, gripping the leaves out of the nest. He groaned softly, his claws braced near your head. He pulled your legs around him, burying the rest of his shaft deep into you. You bit your lip, looking up into his deep azure eyes. His powerful body towered over you. He nuzzled your neck, nipping carefully and licking. He loved the taste of your skin, growling softly. \"Ngh, you're too tight.\" He complained. \"Thank you?\" \"I can't move... without hurting you I mean.\" He explained. You nodded and took hold of his horns. \"Just get it over with...\" You muttered, hanging on. He took a breath and rammed you, tearing in and out of you. You cried in pain and pleasure, an odd mixture you weren't sure you would ever achieve. He whipped his tail with his movements. His head was lowered into your chest. He took this chance to nip your breast, sucking lightly on your hardened nipples. He tugged on them sharply. You hugged his neck, panting loudly, moaning. Your voice caught everytime he bit you. His teeth were smooth and precise, leaving marks all over you. \"F-fuck...~\" He groaned, pressing you to his taut chest, trapping you against him. He sat back, letting you rest against his chest, bouncing you on him. \"Y-you're losing control...\" You muttered, still gripping his horns. He grit his teeth, panting, his breath caressing you. \"Good. Means we'll be done soon.\" He grunted, rolling his head back, fire billowing from his nostrils. You buried your face in his neck, you felt very, very hot. A wave of cool tightness washed over you, making you shake and gasp. He took your waist and pulled out, groaning loudly. You felt his come coat your backside, cooling you more. \"Ngh... ah...\" You panted, realizing you were completely limp. The dragon fell back, a rumble in his chest rocking you into a calm sleep. The nest was covered in your juices. It was kinda satisfying. He pet your hair as you slept, staring at the stars. \"I'm glad you enjoyed yourself...\" He muttered, pulling an animal pelt over and laying you on it. He knows you didn't exactly want this. \"Let's call this your punishment for trying to kill me.\" He decided, going to his own side of the nest and curling up. He gave you your space as he slept. The ocean spray coated your skin with a refreshing cool mist you were in dire need of. The sun beat down on you still, it didn't help your mood. You were annoyed and itching for some intimacy, but that's hard to find on the sea. You sighed and lowered your head. \"What I would do for a decent looking man...\" You groaned, glancing back at the burly and grotesque men on your ship. They hauled fishnets aboard and emptied them out, gutting fish and gathering their meat. You gripped the railing tightly, the sounds of snapping bones and sloppy guts getting on your nerves. \"Woah! What's that thing?\" A cabinboy exclaimed, tossing small fish off a long, slender, shimmering being. You turned and gasped softly at the sight. His burning cyan eyes glared at you, defiant but pleading. He wanted out of the cruel trap. \"A Merman!\" One of your sailors exclaimed. \"Gut him! His scales are worth million!\" Another one exclaimed. You cut the net off the creature and stepped away. \"No... bring him to my chamber. We will take him to the bounty office alive. I'm sure he is worth more that way.\" You explained, gesturing to them to carry him away. They nodded and did as you told, putting him in a container of water and setting him in your quarters. A small smirk ghosted your lips, chuckling softly to yourself. \"Finally, fresh meat~\" Your first mate leaned on the railing and beckoned you over, clearing his throat. \"What are you going to do with that thing?\" He asked. You smiled and shrugged, walking away from him without an answer. He doesn't need to know, not now at least. Your cabin would be his haven for, at least, the night. You hurried that way as soon as night fell, locking the door behind you and smirking at the merman trapped in a large aquarium. \"Hello there, friend~\" You chuckled evilly, tossing your hat on the table. He glared at you, curious and angered. \"What do you want with me? Why did you bring me here!?\" He barked. You tilted your head. \"I'm honestly surprised you speak English.\" You hummed. \"Answer me, dammit!\" He demanded. You tsked and stepped around the tank, feeling his hair and sighing. \"I need a man, and a slender thing like you is fucking perfect.\" You stated simply. He pulled away from you quickly. \"You can't get me to pity you.\" He growled, thrashing his fin. You pursed your lips, sighing softly and taking his face roughly, pulling him to you and kissing his moist, soft lips. He made a noise of surprise, trying to squirm out of your grasp, his struggle slowly weakening. You finally pulled back for breath, nipping his lip teasingly. \"I don't need pity. I need you.\" You purred softly. The kiss was like a drug, dragging him out of reality for a few moments. He paused, looking you over a moment and checking his tank. He made a whistle as he thought, moving back slightly. \"Maybe if you got in the tank we could... I guess have a quicky... If that will set me free.\" He gave in, folding his arms. \"It surely will.\" You purred, climbing into his tank and wrapping your arms around his neck. He squirmed slightly under you, trying to get your garments off without tearing them off. You sighed and tossed them aside yourself, letting them pile on your table. The merman attempted to plant weak kisses on your neck, barely affecting you. \"You don't have to do that, okay? I know you're just doing this to get free. I'll be quick as I can.\" You informed him, massaging his organ from his tail. He helped you relocate your hands to the base of his torso, there a small slit split open as a large, long organ slid into view. You loved its fleshy color, smiling faintly. He blushed, looking aside as you positioned yourself over him, sitting on his lengthy piece. You gasped as it filled your reaches with ease. \"F-fuck!\" You yelped, gripping his shoulders and bouncing on his odd, inhuman piece. You became flushed rather quickly, watching his starstruck gaze look over your body. Something came over the two of you, forcing you to crash your lips together in a powerful kiss. His tongue explored your mouth, his hands trailed your powerful thighs and beautiful torso. You pulled back for breath, arching back as he began to buck into you, holding the edges of the take for leverage. \"P-pirate!\" He gasped in slight confusion. He wasn't sure what to call you, and vice versa. You didn't worry about it because this wasn't supposed to be a serious event. You pushed your fingers through his hair and nipped his fan-like ears. \"C-call me ______.\" You panted, kissing his rough lips. He gripped your heavy chest, ramming you much harder than before, purring your name deeply in your ear \"You can call me Rikou.\" He grunted, spinning and laying you under him in the full ocean water. You gazed up at him longingly, wrapping your legs around his waist and held him tight against you. You gasped as his aquatic love filled you. He groaned low, arching and holding you close to him. \"F-fuck, _____...\" He sighed, laying limply on top of you. You pet his hair sweetly, sighing a bit. \"Well... you're free now, Rikou...\" You hummed, stirring in attempt to leave the tank. He let you go, looking at his fin. \"Right... thanks.\" He muttered. \"Maybe we'll meet again.\" She offered a small smile. \"Maybe... hopefully not.\" He huffed, folding his arms, \"We can't get caught in this... event... again.\" You nodded, dressing in your blouse and jacket, brushing yourself off. \"Yes... I agree. My crew will release you shortly.\" \"... Thank you ____.\" \"Of course.\" A creature from FF7 I believe is very attractive, skip if you'd like, a bit of an OC here. I couldn't make this smutty as hard as I tried so here is some fluff. Shinra was an evil, monotone building standing tall above the slow river of blue-blooded humans. Simply surviving was a task civilians struggled to achieve. Shinra created so many abominations unto nature that it was hard to keep track of them all. They often times just hid their creations away in the mountains, for the poor people of Nibelheim to stumble upon. You were one of those poor people. While hiking in the mountains near the reactor, resting at the manor since you knew exactly where to break into, you decided to visit the tall, stone grey, metallic death chamber and see what treasures you could find. You brought bolt clippers with you, whistling a jaunty tune without a care and breaking the chain on the door. You slipped inside, looking around the eerily brightened place, quieting your song. Bright blues danced on the walls like the shine of a swimming pool, mako streamed below your feet making use of the name \"lifestream\". You looked around for any shiny things you could salvage for money. Strange tubes filled with mako lined the stairs up to the door leading to the inner reactor. You peered into the tube. Is there anything actually in there...? You asked yourself. You wiped the dust off the glass and hummed, stepping back when you couldn't find anything. \"This place is surprisingly clean...\" You hummed. The sharp sound of steam releasing startled you into a jump. You hid behind the tubes, glancing over the glass to the tube that was falling open, holding a weird, humanoid form as it slept. You waited many moments, slowly standing. The creature was asleep, its jaw was exposed with teeth sharp enough to tear meat right off the bone. His claws and body were a beautiful shade of blue, his calfs changing to an odd goldfish orange. He blinked awake, slowly rising and rubbing his eyes. Aww~ He got to his feet and started jittering energetically. He acted like he had just ingested 400lbs of pure caffeine. He looked around the room, racing to the other tubes and tapping on the glass, hissing growls exiting his teeth questioningly. You forgot that you were standing, tilting your head as he focused on you. He tilted his head back. \"Uh... hi.\" You muttered. He ran up to you, startling you onto your ass. He snickered in his weird voice, pulling you back to your feet. Still holding your arm, he twisted you around, studying you and prodding your soft fleshy sides. \"Ow! Hey, quit it!\" You whined. \"Hhh...\" He hissed. He let go of you and returned to the tubes, tapping the glass, annoyed. \"What? Do you want to wake them up?\" You asked. He glanced at you, then to the tube, tapping. You went to the tube and knelt by the side, checking for any switches or buttons to open it. Seems there was none. \"Sorry, dude.\" You shrugged and stood back. He growled, hitting the glass now. \"Hitting it isn't going to help, maybe it releases when you're ready and not forcefully?\" That seemed to get through to him, he sat beside the tube and folded his legs to his chest, almost vibrating with all the energy he had. \"You should probably expend that energy.\" You suggested. He looked up at you, letting a hiss and shaking his head. \"Alright, bye then.\" You turned to leave. A sudden and large weight snagged your leg, tripping you. You yelped as you fell, landing on your face. \"Fuck, why!?\" You glared at your leg. He was hanging onto you, whining. \"What do you want from me?\" \"Grrurr....\" \"Speak English!\" You barked, frustrated. He flinched and let you go, retreating aside like a wounded animal. You rolled your eyes and left the reactor as quickly as your feet would take you. The creature watched you from the door, twitching. \"Grrurr....?\" You haven't returned to the reactor since, nor have you seen of the odd humanoid. The citizens of Nibelheim continued to travel up the same mountain but they haven't seen the creature either. At least no one you asked did. You were strangely curious what happened to it, gathering your things to head back to the reactor. There was a knock at your door. \"Right now? Uh... Okay.\" You went to answer it. You stared at the blue scales of someone familiar. \"Reactor dude?\" You wondered, craning your neck in order to look at him. \"Shiku.\" He answered, somewhat stilted. \"You can talk now?\" You hummed. \"Learned... Why leave?\" He asked you, upset. You sighed and leaned on the doorframe. \"Because I have a home?\" You huffed. He frowned, stepping inside your home. You growled, trying to appear dominant despite your obvious lack of height. \"Hey! I didn't say you could come in. Out, out, out!\" You barked, pushing his shoulders. Shiku whined, totally confused why you were being so aggressive. \"But I...!\" He started as the door slammed. \"Fucking animal...\" You growled. He bellowed at the door, clawing the wood helplessly. You covered your ears, trying to block him out. But it kinda hurt. Not your ears, but it stung inside. He had no one, his family is still undeveloped, so you're all he has. You groaned and opened the ragged door. Shiku lowered his claws, splintered wood still trapped in them. \"Friend...?\" He mewed. You allowed him into your home. He sprinted inside, looking into everything and scattering pillows. \"Calm down, Shiku.\" You muttered. \"Friend has nice nest.\" He hummed, putting everything back in its place and crouching by the potted plants. You sat on your couch and watched him study your home. Shiku made himself as small as possible. \"Friend is angry...\" \"You noticed?\" You sarcastically shot back. He nodded, laying his head on the couch beside you. He studied you closely, pushing himself up onto the seat and sitting beside you. \"Friend Lonely?\" \"What makes you think that?\" You wondered. He sniffed the air, picking up a picture from the side table. It was one of your family in Wutai, the ceremonial garments were brightly colored. He could tell that those humans don't live there if they did there would be more scents. \"Only you in nest.\" \"Brilliant deduction. What do you want?\" You returned to the initial question at hand. \"Alone too.\" \"Well you aren't staying here, you're leaving as soon as I can get you out.\" You folded your arms, glaring at him. Shiku snorted at you, nudging your shoulder with his cheek. \"Friend mean...\" He sighed, laying his head on your lap. You stiffened, watching him suspiciously. He stared back at you. He had no intention other than resting his horned head. The horns prodded your legs uncomfortably, his breath hissing over his teeth. His eyes flickered over your face, hands folded together calmly. His energy has subdued this meeting. He wasn't jittery this time, you wondered if that was just a \"first-day\" thing. Your hesitant hand graced his horns softly. \"What are you doing, Shiku?\" You sighed. He tilted his head slightly. \"Doing?\" \"You keep acting like a sad puppy.\" You giggled softly. He closed his eyes and tapped his claw to your temple. \"Friend lonely. Angry. Shiku help.\" He folded his hands back together. \"Friend help too.\" He rolled onto his side, letting an arm hang off the side of the couch. He started snoring, breathing calmly and keeping you warm. You sighed and shook your head. \"Fine, friend will help.\" Naga boi meeting This one ended up being really long (for a one-shot, past 4 pages is really long), so I'll cut it into two. Oh, btw I'm back. Yeah, I wanted to focus on original works. Well, while they're being edited I'll start working on this again. This and a One Piece fanfic I've been trying to start for a while. The jungles were hot, wet, and crowded. You adjusted the backpack on your shoulders and wiped the screen of your camera nervously. Various jungle song rang above and around you with no end, threatening your very presence. You gulped slightly, eyes darting over the shadows. \"This creature better show up soon...\" You thought nervously, checking the creature photos on your camera. The previous photos were all obvious fakes. A log in a lake, a homeless man in the woods, a weird fish with plastic stuck to it. You huffed with a bit of renewed determination and trudged through the vegetation. You came upon a river clearing, thankfully resting on a boulder and shrugging the backpack off your shoulders. You aired out your shirt, cracking your back. \"Gosh... I don't think there's really a man snake here...\" A melancholic groan escaped as you dug through your bag for your notebook, flipping it to the page littered with man-snake notes messily scribbled by the villagers. Nagas eat all beasts, humans included. Nagas are vicious, primitive beasts, relying on teeth and tails. Nagas are not intelligent. You pursed your lips. None of these even attempted to tell you what they may look like. Are they snake-headed? Are they entirely scaley? You smiled to yourself while imagining the possible outcomes. Maybe this wasn't such a bad hand. And it would be so interesting to see. I sudden noise startled you from your thoughts. Something large moved far too close for comfort. You drew your legs up onto the boulder and readied your camera, peering through your camera screen for whatever moved. \"W-who's there!?\" You barked instinctively, biting your tongue for expecting an animal t- \"Hassssn't anyone told you not to exsssplore alone?\" A hissing voice responded sharply. \"Wh...? Oh, hah hah, nice trick. Whoever you are, it isn't going to scare me. I know Nagas don't exist,\" You descended from the rock and slung your backpack back over your shoulder, \"Just another stupid person getting excited...\" Whoever was tricking you decided they would haul themselves awkwardly into the clearing. You ignored them, shaking your head. To think you were actually excited to see what this snake man would look like. \"I'm pretty sssssure I'm real...\" The odd breathy hiss was much closer now. \"Stop that...\" You growled, \"Fake hissing won't make me believe you.\" You stomped away, not getting far before you tripped on an unexpected log. You caught yourself, backpack slamming against your back, cutting up your hands and knocking some air out of you. \"Watch it!\" His taut voice pierced your pained whine. The log was pulled away from you swiftly. \"I watch it!? Fucking what's with putting a log behind me!?\" You screeched, jumping to your feet to confront the trickster. His chest was immediately at eye level, you had to step back to meekly meet his piercing gaze directly. His... eyes were rather round, with sharply pointed pupils, his angular face was intimidating with a largely defined jaw, his neck somewhat elongated. You stumbled back farther, fumbling for your camera and shakily snapping a picture of this tall, defined dangerous creature. \"What wassss that?\" He suspiciously looked you over. Your words lost their way from your brain to your throat. All you could do was stare, mouth agape. He snatched your camera and looked at it, trying to figure it out. \"What issssssss this thing? What did you do?\" He shook the machine and attempted peering through it. \"I-It's just a... a camera...\" You carefully took it back from him, picking out the picture you just snapped and showing it to him. He glared at you and studied the picture, squinting slightly. \"Er...\" He hummed, getting closer and tilting his head, \"I...\" \"Is something wrong with the picture?\" You curiously looked at the photo. It was a picture of him, low angle, shadows cast down his chest, lifting many of his scars into view and making him appear very rugged. \"Nothing issss wrong with it. Jusssst leave, or I'll poisssson you.\" He snapped, slithering off into the dark forest, the last of his charcoal brown drizzled burning orange scaled tail snapped out of view without a trace. You had to take a moment to process. All you could think of was his ashy gray hair and beautiful scales. His amazingly captivating brown eyes. You checked your photo, you couldn't see any of his tail. Shit... You huffed and ran through the vines, following the flattened grass to a thick tree. You peered up the tree, searching for him. \"Hey! S-Snake guy!?\" You called up the tree. A few birds scattered, but nothing answered. You climbed up the tree a while, catching your breath before cupping your hands around your mouth. \"Snake guy!?\" He drops from the top of the tree, catching himself on a branch around your height with his long tail. He folded his arms and glared at you, hanging upside down. \"It'sssss Igassssssha... What do you want?\" He growled. You dug your camera out of your bag and prepared it for the next photo. \"The last picture I got wasn't good enough,\" You wiggle a bit and get as comfortable as you can on your branch, \"Can I get another one?\" Igasha eyeballs you, raising his brow suspiciously. \"Why?\" \"It's a lot to explain, but basically I just have to prove to the locals you exist.\" You smile, testing out the lighting filters on your legs. Igasha shakes his head and hoists himself back up above you. \"No. I don't need more humansssss invading my territory.\" He sighed, almost dejected. You followed him, your camera slipping slightly, luckily you could snatch it up before it fell. \"W-well if they know you exist maybe they'll leave you alone since they would know the threat exists?\" You suggest, panting a bit. Igasha glances down at you, bending backward and meeting your face from above. \"I know humanssss... That'sssss never how it worksssss. Jusssssst leave me alone.\" He pulls back, but before he can leave you, you grab his shoulder and stammer nervously. \"W-wait!\" You blurt. He cocks a brow at you, nearing the cliff of his patience. You remove your small hand from his powerful shoulder, gulping a bit. \"I-I mean... I just... I'll probably never see a Naga again... could I just get a souvenir picture?\" You murmur, shaking the camera with a small laugh. He sighs and waves a dismissive hand, shaking his head. \"Fine...\" You lean back on your branch, trying to get as much of his enormous, chocolate drizzled, burnt orange tail as possible. The sunlight shimmering on it is so beautiful... He was certainly fed up with you, but you could swear a hint of amusement pulled at his lips. His chocolate eyes still held strained annoyance at you though. You snap the picture and check the quality, smiling and nodding to him. \"Perfect!\" You flashed a thumb up. Igasha climbed away quickly. \"Good, now leave.\" \"Right... thanks, Igasha. Maybe I'll see you again while looking for another monster?\" You wonder, tilting your head. He laughs and escapes your view. You frowned and picked your way to the bottom of the tree. You bounded through the jungle, ecstatic to finally have proof of a monster. You ran to the edge of the jungle, breaking through and reaching the village. Panting heavily and leaning on the wall. A villager approached you curiously, almost surprised you returned. You raised your camera triumphantly as he approached, breathlessly laughing. The villager took your camera and checked the 2 new photos, racing to the leaders. You slid to the ground and aired out your shirt again. You wondered what the villagers were going to do with your camera. Straining a bit, you rose to your feet and went to knock on the door when you heard something alarming. \"It's just an animal, who would care?\" The camera snatcher said. \"He appears to be a large beast. It would take the would village to capture him.\" Replied the leader. \"The girl got the damn thing to pose for her, she could probably trick him into coming here. We'll just ambush him like that!\" You stepped back, shaking your head incredulously and balling your fists. Before all your thoughts could come together, you fled back into the jungle to try and protect an innocent monster. Vines entangled your legs and tripped you several times in your trek. You cut them away and groaned in exasperation. It wasn't this hard to get there the first time. The large tree Igasha had vanished in finally loomed over you, the sun setting behind the dense treeline. You climbed up as far as you could, reaching a point where the branches above were too far to reach. You leaned on the trunk and caught your breath, checking the time on your phone. 19:46, it's getting late... \"I'm going to die out here...\" You thought, straightening and nodding to yourself. You took a deep breath. \"Igasha!!\" You called, cupping your mouth and emptying your lungs. Your mouth was covered by a large, clawed hand. He shushed you and pulled you higher with him, dodging wandering flashlights from below. He wraps you in his huge tail, suspending you beside him. You peered below at the villagers searching for the two of you. Igasha glared at them, glancing at you and pulling away. \"I knew thissss would happen.\" He muttered bitterly. \"I didn't know this would happen,\" You huffed, going limp and dangling, \"I was just told to get proof, they didn't tell me what would happen if I did it...\" \"That'sss what they all sssay... we'll thisss time I'm not sssparing the idiot.\" He growls, descending the tree and carrying you away. You struggle to flee, but he covers your mouth and squeezes you with his tail, \"Don't try it.\" He warns simply. He carried you away to a dark grotto hidden in a tangled mess of closely growing trees and flowers. He finally lets you go, dropping you into a mess of fur and bones. You yelp and smack a skull away from you, wiping your hand off on your shorts. Igasha bunches his tail around the grotto, tapping his claws on himself. \"Where is this?\" You ask fearfully. \"You never told me your name...\" He mutters, tilting his head at you. You pause a moment and blink. \"I asked you a question.\" You reiterate, irritated. \"This isss my grotto. My nessst...\" Igasha throws you assorted pelts and rests on his tail, turned away from you, \"I ate already...\" You lay the pelts out and lay on them, curling up slightly. \"... My name is _____.\" You hum quietly. Igasha barely stirs. \"Cool...\" SEXY TIME BOIIIIS I MEAN GIRRRRRRLS You awoke early the next morning with an aching stomach, curling tightly and whining softly, trying not to wake up Igasha. You sit up and look around the grotto, shivering at all the bones scattered around you. Igasha slept soundly in his scaley pile, sunlight dappling his dark, tan skin. He groans and tightens his coil, arm dangling, hand resting on the grass. You brushed yourself off and tried to pull yourself out of the grotto, but the opening in the trees was too high for you to climb over. You slid back to the middle of the nest and sighed, watching Igasha as he slept. His body rose and fell slowly, the rhythm of his breath rolling through his tail. His hair covered his eyes, his sharpened teeth showing from slightly parted lips. His arms were about as scarred as his chest, faint paint circling his wrists. You hum quietly and approach him, crawling up to his pile of tail and leaning on him. You tilt your head and whine softly, nudging him. \"Igasha?\" You mew. \"You're not a sssmart human.... Are you...?\" He groans, not budging from his comfortable rest. \"Guess not. Do you have anything to eat around here?\" You shrug and move a bone out from under you. \"I do...\" Igasha opens one eye, pulling his arm back and resting his head on it. You purse your lips and put your chin on his tail, nose to nose with him. \"So can I eat?\" \"I don't have anything.\" He huffed, snorting at you. You shook your head and bapped his hands. \"You just said you had food!\" You exclaim. Igasha shakes his head, straightening and stretching. He wraps his tail around you and rises, towering over your small human form. You shrunk into his coils, tensing terribly while a wild grin stretched his face. \"I do... You're my food~\" He chuckled darkly. \"W-w-w-wait. Really...! I-I didn't do anything to you...!!\" \"True....~\" He lifts you up with his tail, \"then you have to make a pact with me.\" \"Anything!\" You beg, clasping your hands together and tearing up at the thought of dying in the jungle. \"Never lead the village to me again.\" He tosses you out of the enclosed nest and hisses. You flail in the air and land in the mud, coughing and shaking the mud off. You wince slightly, sighing. You scrambled to your feet and look back at the tree spiral, frowning. You don't know why, but... you were... seriously heated when he towered over you with that terrible grin. You... Kinda wanted it to get bad. Maybe in another circumstance... \"Stop it... that's disgusting...\" You turned away and hurried back to the village, hitching a plane back home. You didn't want to think about this trip... maybe photographing monsters isn't wise, especially since a majority of the rumors you chase are fake anyway. You sighed softly, looking out the plane window, watching the jungle disappear below a sea of clouds. The thought of the enclosed nest caught your blank mind again, the feeling of his tail around you, holding you tight, the waxy scales pressed against your tired, dirty flesh. You shuddered slightly. \"Why is that so... enticing...?\" You thought, whining to yourself. You hold your arm, shivers rising up through your whole body everytime the feeling of his scales dances on your skin. You press your legs together and rest your head on the glass. \"Just forget it...\" You scold yourself, closing your eyes to sleep. Maybe you'll forget when you wake up. You're startled awake by a flight attendant gripping your shoulder. She pulls back looking concerned, pointing to the window. \"Ma'am, it's time to wake up, we're at the airport.\" She said, taking the last bag from the overhead and placing it in the chair beside you. You look outside and rub your eyes, nodding slightly before grabbing your things, leaving slowly while sleep still hangs on your eyes. It was much colder here than the jungle. You pulled your heavy coat from your bag and fluffed the big fuzzy collar around your neck. You fold your arms and wander through crowds of people to make it home, silent all the while. ---- You woke with a start in the night, sweating and holding yourself. You had no memory of climbing into bed and passing out, but you were suddenly panting fearfully in your dark room. You slammed back down onto your pillow, staring at the pitch ceiling and trying to calm down. Igasha's scales ghosted along your skin again, the memory of his constriction and closeness to you wouldn't leave you alone. Your hands skimmed along your stomach, reaching to your warm core. You gasped softly and bit your lip, your fingers slipping into your thin panties and teasing your clit carefully with cold fingers. You squirmed slightly, imagining Igasha's long, forked tongue skillfully taking in every taste of you. Your heart fluttered, seeing his sharp eyes in your mind studying your barely clothed body. You pulled your shirt up, tossing your panties aside and taking the toy from your side-table. You turn on your trusty vibrator and close your eyes, Igasha taking form once more and licking his teeth at you. \"Turn over~\" He purrs in his rumbling, dark voice. You obey your fantasy, letting it take your waist and thrust in roughly as you shoved the thick side of your toy in the same way. The perfect motion of this terribly rough fantasy just made you want him more. You pant, glancing back at this representation of your wanton lust and mewing his name softly. His eyes get more predatory the better he feels, raising his height to slam down into you with his whole weight, coaxing louder cries from you that he absolutely loved. You weren't sure if he would actually like your mews, but you kinda hoped he would. You push the vibrator deeper, hitting the edge of your chasm. You desperately wanted him inside you now, but the odds are decreasing as time goes on. You didn't know how... but you had to have Igasha at least once. You tighten as waves of pleasure cascade over you and exhaust your body for the rest of the night, wiping off the vibrator and putting it away. You rolled onto your side and hummed, frowning softly. You need Igasha. ---- Buying tickets back to the jungle was one of the most idiotic impulses you've had in a long time, but it was going to be topped easily soon enough. You packed assorted intimacies with you just to make this encounter as beautiful as it was in your fantasy. You couldn't let the village see you, however. You sneak from the airport to the jungle itself immediately, avoiding the village. The jungle is rather dense in this area, slowing your progress terribly. You push all the vines and vegetation aside, lugging a heavy bag over your shoulder. \"C'mon... I'm pretty sure his nest is this way.\" You huffed, leaning against a tree and folding your arms. \"What are you doing here?\" A familiar voice growled. You brightened and turned, smiling wide. Igasha's fangs are bloodied, his eyebrow cocked as he glared down at you. \"I... I had to see you again!\" You admit to him. He sighs and shakes his head, slithering past you. \"I told you to leave.\" He growls, ignoring you. You race after him and take his hand, tugging on him. \"No! Please! I... I really had to see you! I can't get you off my mind!\" You cry. Igasha purses his lips, looking aside and checking for any witnesses. He coils around you and carries you with him, huffing. \"You humansss are ssso irrational... fine,\" He mutters, \"You're lucky it'sss my mating ssseassson...\" You giggled excitedly, clutching your bag close. Igasha brought you to his enclosed nest, setting you inside and following after, folding his arms. You set the bag aside and opened it. He took your shoulder and pushed the bag away with his burnt orange tail. \"We won't need any of that human ssshit.\" Igasha says as he takes your wrists and pins you to the tree. You blush as he studies you. He rips your clothes off and smirks at your natural form. You felt a bit self conscious, but you wouldn't shy away now. \"Hm... well, you're ssscertainly a beauty...~\" He chuckles, nipping your neck and chest, leaving little marks all over you. You squirmed slightly, brushing your leg up against his masculine side and grazed his waxy scales. \"Thank you~\" You giggled. Igasha licks up your neck to your jaw and nips your earlobe. \"Are you fresssh?\" He hums. \"Fresh?\" You mutter. Without answering, he pushes two, long, clawed fingers into your moist chasm and thrusts them slowly, a surprised gasp following your flinch. Igasha chuckles, adding another finger and thrusting a tad faster. \"Hm, ssseemsss not... but that'sss fine. Makesss thisss easssier.\" He hisses, pulling his hand back and cleaning them off with that enticing ribbon of a tongue. Your face became even more flush, your breath hastening. He took your waist and pulled you close to his tail, his stiff piece pressing against you. You glanced down at it, eyes widening. It wasn't above average, but the thickness was almost frightening. Igasha pulls back a bit and sucks your nipple, thrusting sharply into you and stretching you. You arched and gripped his arms, wrapping your legs around him. He teases your nipples with his forked tongue and sharp teeth. You absolutely loved the feeling of his daggers gently tugging and pinching your soft mounds. His tail slides under your backside, raising you and angling his thrusts. You rock with him, your legs tight around him, getting used to his thickness. \"Igasha...\" You pant, softly giggling, \"Harder~\" Igasha raises his brow, smirking and kissing your neck. \"Of courssse~\" He purrs, slamming harder and beautifully grunting each time. The symphony of your noises gradually crescendoed, ringing through the forest as the evening fell upon the jungle. Your snake lover rolls you onto your stomach and rolls his hips, pressing your back to his chest and massaging your breasts. He nibbles your ear and pants shakily, keeping you supported under him. \"____...\" He panted sweetly, his breath grazing your ear and causing you to shiver. \"I-Igasha...~\" You return, rubbing his defined stomach and biting your lip. He groans, laying back and allowing you some space, keeping a hand on your ample bottom. \"Ngh... I didn't think a human would feel thisss good...\" He hisses weakly. You smirk, bouncing on him and hugging his chocolate drizzles. He combs his claws through his hair and grits his teeth, \"Ssstop it, you'll make me come.\" He warns through his teeth. You giggle and get off his throbbing piece, facing him before re-mounting. \"That's kinda the point, love.\" You smile, kissing his lips and rocking quickly. His breath begins to hasten as well, gripping the nesting beneath them. You try to straighten, but he holds you against him, limiting your movement and dealing the final thrusts himself, spilling his inhuman seed into you. You gasped and struggled slightly. \"Igasha, what the hell!?\" You cried. He twitches a bit, finally letting you go. \"What? That'sss what you wanted isssn't it?\" He tilted his head, nearly breathless. You want to slap him, but your body wouldn't respond. You laid on his chest, shivering a little when a bit of his love spills out of you. \"... You suck...\" You huff. He chuckles and pets your head. \"And you are going home in the morning.\"",

      "You didn't think he would be using that piece on you.",
      "Though, you weren't sure which piece his kind had at first.",
      "He thrust it into you, stretching you wide, filling you as much as possible.",
      "You cried out, gripping the wooden table tightly.",
      "He groaned, smiling down at you.",
      "\"You're definitely so much tighter than a mare-woman.\"",
      "He smirked.",
      "You panted, gasping as he started to buck sharply into you.",
      "He only fit half of his piece inside you, but it didn't matter to you and him.",
      "He pulled back and slid into you, slamming your edge with ease.",
      "His giant member kinda hurt when it hit you, but the fit felt so good.",
      "\"Ah...!",
      "O-Oracryn!\"",
      "You cried out, tensing and panting heavily.",
      "He rolled his head back and bucked harder, grabbing your wrists to hold you up.",
      "He angled his thrusts, slamming your pussy, stretching your stomach as he did.",
      "You struggled slightly, moaning loudly.",
      "Oracryn poured his gallons into you, pulling out and spilling the rest of it onto the floor, coating your leg in his milky fluid.",
      "He panted, laying in his straw nest flicking his tail.",
      "You laid motionlessly on the mounting table, shaking.",
      "\"You can lay with me, dear...\" He sighed, patting the place next to him.",
      "You stumbled over to him and flopped beside him.",
      "He wrapped his arms around you and cuddled you sweetly.",
      "You smiled, kissing his cheek before sleeping.",
      "Mako is an OC of mine, a reaper skeleton who is 7ft tall with 12 ft wingspan.",
      "His eye lights are green and his scythe has engravings on the blade.",
      "The fields outside Venobane stretched miles, grass illuminated as it waved in the wind, making the expanse shine.",
      "The great mountain housed the small cabin of a rogue Reaper.",
      "He lived alone, he worked alone.",
      "You heard many stories about the creature, curious as to what it looked like.",
      "No one, save the dead, ever actually saw the being.",
      "You assumed he was a spirit, like a ghoul, more spectral than anything else.",
      "Possibly glowing so he could see where he was going in the dark.",
      "You laughed softly at the thought, erasing stray lines from your sketch of the spectrum.",
      "You imagined he would look like he was rotting, then you imagined he would look gaseous.",
      "Basically, there were too many possibilities, and you tried to draw them all.",
      "You sighed and set the sketchbook aside.",
      "A scramble of different elements clashing horribly in lineart alone.",
      "\"Ugh...",
      "I need to take a break...\" You huffed, upset.",
      "You walked out on the town.",
      "City lights blinded the night, scaring the stars from the sky leaving a blank, dark blanket of nothing.",
      "The sounds of traffic and loud, bass heavy music drowned out the natural sounds of nature.",
      "It upset you even more than your lack of inspiration.",
      "You grabbed your motor bike and aimed for the great woods where the reaper was said to live.",
      "You got on to the highway, riding silently, your thoughts wandering.",
      "The loud blare of vehicle horns broke your thoughts.",
      "You flinched, looking up at the blinding headlights of an oncoming truck.",
      "You screamed before everything went silent.",
      "(That's the end, what are you still doing here?) (Alright, I'm kidding.",
      "Here you go.)",
      "You awoke with a start, screaming and shooting upright, looking around to find yourself in a small, wooden cabin.",
      "The furnishings were comfortable and simple.",
      "The home looked barely lived in.",
      "The bed you laid in was neat and small, soft covers in shades of minty green ensconced you.",
      "You stood slowly, dropping the sheets around you, wondering if it was all just a dream.",
      "The room around you held many recently used items.",
      "Mangas strewed a messy desk, half of them you couldn't read the titles of, the other half you could tell the contents of just by seeing the bare women on their covers.",
      "You snickered to yourself, reaching to take one of the hentai mangas.",
      "\"Oh, you're awake.\"",
      "A voice said monotonously.",
      "The voice made you drop the book.",
      "\"Who said that?\" You asked as you spun, looking for the source.",
      "A tall cloaked figure stood in the faint candle light of the cabin.",
      "His hood covered his face, large skeletal wings folded neatly behind him.",
      "You gasped softly, stepping back, panicking.",
      "\"Oh my god, what are you!?\" You shrieked.",
      "\"Calm down, or I'm kicking you out.\"",
      "He warned, walking past you and making the bed you mindlessly unraveled.",
      "\"W-what are you though...?\" You asked again.",
      "He scoffed quietly, peeling his hood back and looking at you.",
      "The lights in his skull focused on you, the cracks running down his cheeks glowed faintly with the souls of those he's captured trapped in an eternity flowing as a personal magic through his bones.",
      "\"I'm a reaper.\"",
      "He answered simply, folding his arms.",
      "You studied him, pursing your lips slightly.",
      "He stared at you, silent, growing impatient.",
      "\"I gotta say, I'm disappointed.\"",
      "You admitted.",
      "\"By what?\"",
      "He frowned.",
      "\"You're so simple...\" You sighed.",
      "The Reaper raised his uncanny and expressive brow at your statement, his wings twitching.",
      "\"Simple?\"",
      "\"You're just a skeleton!",
      "I was hoping for whisps and colors and... well... complexity.\"",
      "You explained.",
      "He shook his head slowly, walking past you.",
      "You could hear a ghostly chuckle as he passed you.",
      "A shine of emerald green flitted through the room, the source behind you making odd noises.",
      "\"How is this then?\"",
      "He asked.",
      "You turned and stood stunned, finding the tall skeleton changed into a sickly green, flesh dropping undead.",
      "You flinched, stepping away.",
      "\"I prefer the other form...\" You whined.",
      "He changed back, the flash blinding you, hiding his transformative secrets from you.",
      "\"You can call me Mako,\" He opened the dark wooden door for you, gesturing outside, \"I can take you home.\"",
      "You remembered what you thought you had dreamt.",
      "\"Wait, did the truck actually hit me?\" You finally asked.",
      "Mako smirked, closing the door.",
      "\"I thought you had forgotten.",
      "Yes.",
      "You were hit.",
      "Your soul is pretty powerful, though.",
      "I didn't find it fit to take it from you.\"",
      "He seemed unfazed by the whole situation.",
      "You wondered if he did this often, and if so, why?",
      "\"O...kay... do you know where I live?\" You changed the subject.",
      "Mako leaned on the wall, glancing at the frame beside him.",
      "He took a moment to fix it before answering you.",
      "\"I don't...",
      "I took you from your funeral.\"",
      "\"Then why would you take me home?\"",
      "\"You're going to your new home.",
      "Ilfalia.\"",
      "He took his scythe, bracing it before your neck.",
      "You gulped, leaning away from the cold metal, \"If you don't want to go there, I could always take you myself.\"",
      "\"M-maybe we could work something out?",
      "I-I like it here....\" You muttered.",
      "Mako paused, lowering his scythe.",
      "\"Y-you do..?\"",
      "He asked.",
      "You watched his stone, mental wall crack at that statement.",
      "\"O-of course...",
      "It's really nice here.\"",
      "You reiterated.",
      "Mako looked you over, spying the table of books behind you.",
      "He smirked and snapped his fingers.",
      "\"Then I have a proposal for you.\"",
      "\"Name it.\"",
      "\"You can stay if you reenact my books with me.\"",
      "He offered.",
      "You knew exactly what he meant, blushing and pointing at the dark robes on his body.",
      "\"C-can you even do any of that?\" You asked.",
      "Mako nodded, a wide smile stretching his skull.",
      "He pulled his robe off and showed you exactly what his captured souls did for him.",
      "He manipulated the deep green, almost liquid substance to exit from his fingers, coiling it on his back and on the front of his pelvis.",
      "Lengthy, slimy tendrils whipped from his back, gripping your wrists and raising you into the air.",
      "He hummed and toyed with the sensitive piece at his base.",
      "\"What do you prefer?",
      "Long or thick?\"",
      "He smirked.",
      "Your mind was blanking, you couldn't believe what this creature of death was doing to you.",
      "\"I... I don't...\" \"Aw, blanking?",
      "Hehe, I'll just do both~\" He decided, molding his piece into the perfect size for you.",
      "He took your hips and lulled his long green tongue out of his sharp jaw, licking up your body as he thrust roughly into you.",
      "You gasped, his large piece stretching you as he pushed himself in without hesitation.",
      "His tentacles trailed down your stomach, teasing your clit and entering your behind.",
      "You struggled against the feeling, uncomfortable with the tentacle writhing in your crevice.",
      "You let a choked moan when he pulled back and slammed back in, grunting happily.",
      "He dropped you onto him, chuckling at your squeaking reactions.",
      "His motions were harsh and unforgiving on your tender pussy.",
      "His appendage slipped deeper into your behind, writhing.",
      "You grit your teeth and arched, pressing against his rib cage.",
      "\"Oh?",
      "Do you like that..~?\"",
      "He chuckled bouncing you harder.",
      "You mewed sweetly.",
      "\"Y-yes!",
      "Yes, I love it!",
      "Ahhh...\" You broke, begging for more.",
      "Mako laid you down in his bed and railed you like no other.",
      "His long, iridescent tongue hung out of his mouth.",
      "His heavy, lustful breaths brushing your neck.",
      "You stared into his deep darkened depths, watching his green flames flicker over your body, watching every creamy inch bounce under him.",
      "\"M-mako...!",
      "I-I'm gonna come...\" You panted, arching and tightening as the waves of heat crashed over you.",
      "Mako groaned loudly, releasing his reaper liquid into you.",
      "His strange, effective biology driving you to the most intense orgasm you could remember, stealing your thoughts and catching your breath.",
      "When your mind returned, Mako was collapsed beside you, his wings twitching.",
      "You glanced at him, panting, smiling.",
      "\"You alright?\" You asked with a light laugh.",
      "He nodded silently, face down in his pillows.",
      "\"I don't want to move...\" He muttered.",
      "\"I can't feel my legs, haha.\"",
      "You snickered, rolling onto your side and wrapping an arm around him.",
      "\"Good.\"",
      "He huffed, his body relaxed to the point of paralysis.",
      "You hummed and dragged your finger along his spine.",
      "\"Mind if I sleep here?\"",
      "\"Of course not...",
      "You can stay here as long as you like.\"",
      "He offered.",
      "Mako finally urged himself to meet your face with a chaste kiss, smiling.",
      "You nuzzled his neck and curled up happily, sleeping soundly beside him.",
      "The colossal mountains above you stretched tall enough to tear the sky.",
      "You watched the rolling storm approach, thunder cracking deep in its heart.",
      "The flashes of light illuminated the grand wingspan of a ferocious and gigantic beast perched atop the earthy claws.",
      "You glanced up at the figure, wrapping your arms around yourself as the echoing roar rang throughout the valley.",
      "Your village was right in its grasp.",
      "The beast soared overhead, his shimmering blue scales shining in the ephemeral light cracking in the heavens.",
      "You gasped at the sight, though terrifying, it was amazingly beautiful.",
      "The beast vanished in the mass of clouds, leaving you dumbfounded.",
      "You trained for years to scale that mountain and slay the beast.",
      "You would be a great hero if you succeeded.",
      "The thought always brought you joy, making you feel light and important.",
      "You had no idea how it would end...",
      "The day finally came that you would attempt the dangerous incline to the lizard's lair.",
      "You looked up to the great height, unwavering, determined.",
      "The first step would be challenging, but swift.",
      "(let's skip the climbing because that isn't important right now.)",
      "You reached the top of the mountain, welcomed by the sight of a grand nest with scattered bones lying in the branches and hay bales.",
      "A small gasp escaped your lips.",
      "The dragon was sleeping at the far edge, his body rising and falling calmly with each deep breath.",
      "Your feet brought you to it's back without meaning to.",
      "His scales glimmered with tints of blue and purple.",
      "The dark, bumpy surface was warm to the touch.",
      "You smiled faintly, studying the beautiful tints.",
      "\"What are you doing?\"",
      "The creature rumbled, raising his head and looking at you.",
      "You flinched slightly, stepping away from him.",
      "He got to his feet, his icy eyes studying you.",
      "His claws bore into the straw of his nest making holes.",
      "You couldn't find your voice, simply staring up at the beautiful creature.",
      "\"I-I was....",
      "I just...\" You stammered.",
      "\"Did you think you could slay me?\"",
      "He chuckled, batting your sword away.",
      "You let him knock it off the mountain, backing away as much as you could.",
      "He brought his face right up to yours, his forked tongue tasting the air.",
      "\"I wanted to claim your beauty.\"",
      "You admitted.",
      "He raised his brow.",
      "\"'Claim my beauty'?\"",
      "He threw his head back and laughed, the ground rumbling with his boisterous laugh.",
      "You felt your cheeks get really warm, you were embarrassed.",
      "\"D-Don't laugh at me!\"",
      "\"How did you intend to do that?\"",
      "He asked, resting his head on his claw.",
      "You pursed your lips, folding your arms.",
      "\"I'll figure it out!",
      "I don't need a sword to claim things!\"",
      "You stamped your foot, defiantly standing your ground against the bully of a lizard.",
      "He yawned and pushed you onto your ass.",
      "He stood to his full height, he was maybe 9 feet tall.",
      "Muscular and lean like an aviary lizard should be.",
      "\"How about I claim you myself, human?\"",
      "He smirked, stretching his wings and blocking the sun.",
      "You shielded your eyes from the sharp glint.",
      "\"What!?\"",
      "He dragged you to the back of his nest and pinned your wrists to the floor.",
      "You struggled slightly, blushing terribly.",
      "\"N-no! I won't let a dragon take me!\"",
      "You claimed, struggling.",
      "\"Hnn, you don't mean that.\"",
      "He mewed, blowing a small puff of smoke at you.",
      "You coughed and looked away from him.",
      "He dragged a claw down your body and cut your clothes off, peeling them off you.",
      "He was careful not to scar your clear skin, smiling faintly.",
      "\"Just what I want in a mate~\" He chuckled.",
      "You closed your eyes, trying not to give in.",
      "\"Stop it!\"",
      "You begged.",
      "The dragon licked up your neck, erupting shivers down your body.",
      "\"Hm, No. Why should I?\"",
      "He hummed.",
      "\"Because I don't want this!\"",
      "You barked.",
      "\"I didn't want to die but you were going to do that to me.\"",
      "He returned simply.",
      "\"But this is torture!\"",
      "\"It's only torture with intent to kill.",
      "I'm keeping you.\"",
      "\"Why?\"",
      "\"Why do you ask so many questions!?",
      "Just open up!\"",
      "He roared, spreading your legs about as far as you could spread.",
      "You watched his giant, throbbing piece rub against your opening, moistening you slightly.",
      "He thrust into you sharply, tearing your fresh womanhood.",
      "You cried out, gripping the leaves out of the nest.",
      "He groaned softly, his claws braced near your head.",
      "He pulled your legs around him, burying the rest of his shaft deep into you.",
      "You bit your lip, looking up into his deep azure eyes.",
      "His powerful body towered over you.",
      "He nuzzled your neck, nipping carefully and licking.",
      "He loved the taste of your skin, growling softly.",
      "\"Ngh, you're too tight.\"",
      "He complained.",
      "\"Thank you?\"",
      "\"I can't move... without hurting you I mean.\"",
      "He explained.",
      "You nodded and took hold of his horns.",
      "\"Just get it over with...\" You muttered, hanging on.",
      "He took a breath and rammed you, tearing in and out of you.",
      "You cried in pain and pleasure, an odd mixture you weren't sure you would ever achieve.",
      "He whipped his tail with his movements.",
      "His head was lowered into your chest.",
      "He took this chance to nip your breast, sucking lightly on your hardened nipples.",
      "He tugged on them sharply.",
      "You hugged his neck, panting loudly, moaning.",
      "Your voice caught everytime he bit you.",
      "His teeth were smooth and precise, leaving marks all over you.",
      "\"F-fuck...~\" He groaned, pressing you to his taut chest, trapping you against him.",
      "He sat back, letting you rest against his chest, bouncing you on him.",
      "\"Y-you're losing control...\" You muttered, still gripping his horns.",
      "He grit his teeth, panting, his breath caressing you.",
      "\"Good.",
      "Means we'll be done soon.\"",
      "He grunted, rolling his head back, fire billowing from his nostrils.",
      "You buried your face in his neck, you felt very, very hot.",
      "A wave of cool tightness washed over you, making you shake and gasp.",
      "He took your waist and pulled out, groaning loudly.",
      "You felt his come coat your backside, cooling you more.",
      "\"Ngh... ah...\" You panted, realizing you were completely limp.",
      "The dragon fell back, a rumble in his chest rocking you into a calm sleep.",
      "The nest was covered in your juices.",
      "It was kinda satisfying.",
      "He pet your hair as you slept, staring at the stars.",
      "\"I'm glad you enjoyed yourself...\" He muttered, pulling an animal pelt over and laying you on it.",
      "He knows you didn't exactly want this.",
      "\"Let's call this your punishment for trying to kill me.\"",
      "He decided, going to his own side of the nest and curling up.",
      "He gave you your space as he slept.",
      "The ocean spray coated your skin with a refreshing cool mist you were in dire need of.",
      "The sun beat down on you still, it didn't help your mood.",
      "You were annoyed and itching for some intimacy, but that's hard to find on the sea.",
      "You sighed and lowered your head.",
      "\"What I would do for a decent looking man...\" You groaned, glancing back at the burly and grotesque men on your ship.",
      "They hauled fishnets aboard and emptied them out, gutting fish and gathering their meat.",
      "You gripped the railing tightly, the sounds of snapping bones and sloppy guts getting on your nerves.",
      "\"Woah!",
      "What's that thing?\"",
      "A cabinboy exclaimed, tossing small fish off a long, slender, shimmering being.",
      "You turned and gasped softly at the sight.",
      "His burning cyan eyes glared at you, defiant but pleading.",
      "He wanted out of the cruel trap.",
      "\"A Merman!\"",
      "One of your sailors exclaimed.",
      "\"Gut him!",
      "His scales are worth million!\"",
      "Another one exclaimed.",
      "You cut the net off the creature and stepped away.",
      "\"No... bring him to my chamber.",
      "We will take him to the bounty office alive.",
      "I'm sure he is worth more that way.\"",
      "You explained, gesturing to them to carry him away.",
      "They nodded and did as you told, putting him in a container of water and setting him in your quarters.",
      "A small smirk ghosted your lips, chuckling softly to yourself.",
      "\"Finally, fresh meat~\" Your first mate leaned on the railing and beckoned you over, clearing his throat.",
      "\"What are you going to do with that thing?\"",
      "He asked.",
      "You smiled and shrugged, walking away from him without an answer.",
      "He doesn't need to know, not now at least.",
      "Your cabin would be his haven for, at least, the night.",
      "You hurried that way as soon as night fell, locking the door behind you and smirking at the merman trapped in a large aquarium.",
      "\"Hello there, friend~\" You chuckled evilly, tossing your hat on the table.",
      "He glared at you, curious and angered.",
      "\"What do you want with me?",
      "Why did you bring me here!?\"",
      "He barked.",
      "You tilted your head.",
      "\"I'm honestly surprised you speak English.\"",
      "You hummed.",
      "\"Answer me, dammit!\"",
      "He demanded.",
      "You tsked and stepped around the tank, feeling his hair and sighing.",
      "\"I need a man, and a slender thing like you is fucking perfect.\"",
      "You stated simply.",
      "He pulled away from you quickly.",
      "\"You can't get me to pity you.\"",
      "He growled, thrashing his fin.",
      "You pursed your lips, sighing softly and taking his face roughly, pulling him to you and kissing his moist, soft lips.",
      "He made a noise of surprise, trying to squirm out of your grasp, his struggle slowly weakening.",
      "You finally pulled back for breath, nipping his lip teasingly.",
      "\"I don't need pity.",
      "I need you.\"",
      "You purred softly.",
      "The kiss was like a drug, dragging him out of reality for a few moments.",
      "He paused, looking you over a moment and checking his tank.",
      "He made a whistle as he thought, moving back slightly.",
      "\"Maybe if you got in the tank we could...",
      "I guess have a quicky...",
      "If that will set me free.\"",
      "He gave in, folding his arms.",
      "\"It surely will.\"",
      "You purred, climbing into his tank and wrapping your arms around his neck.",
      "He squirmed slightly under you, trying to get your garments off without tearing them off.",
      "You sighed and tossed them aside yourself, letting them pile on your table.",
      "The merman attempted to plant weak kisses on your neck, barely affecting you.",
      "\"You don't have to do that, okay?",
      "I know you're just doing this to get free.",
      "I'll be quick as I can.\"",
      "You informed him, massaging his organ from his tail.",
      "He helped you relocate your hands to the base of his torso, there a small slit split open as a large, long organ slid into view.",
      "You loved its fleshy color, smiling faintly.",
      "He blushed, looking aside as you positioned yourself over him, sitting on his lengthy piece.",
      "You gasped as it filled your reaches with ease.",
      "\"F-fuck!\"",
      "You yelped, gripping his shoulders and bouncing on his odd, inhuman piece.",
      "You became flushed rather quickly, watching his starstruck gaze look over your body.",
      "Something came over the two of you, forcing you to crash your lips together in a powerful kiss.",
      "His tongue explored your mouth, his hands trailed your powerful thighs and beautiful torso.",
      "You pulled back for breath, arching back as he began to buck into you, holding the edges of the take for leverage.",
      "\"P-pirate!\"",
      "He gasped in slight confusion.",
      "He wasn't sure what to call you, and vice versa.",
      "You didn't worry about it because this wasn't supposed to be a serious event.",
      "You pushed your fingers through his hair and nipped his fan-like ears.",
      "\"C-call me ______.\"",
      "You panted, kissing his rough lips.",
      "He gripped your heavy chest, ramming you much harder than before, purring your name deeply in your ear \"You can call me Rikou.\"",
      "He grunted, spinning and laying you under him in the full ocean water.",
      "You gazed up at him longingly, wrapping your legs around his waist and held him tight against you.",
      "You gasped as his aquatic love filled you.",
      "He groaned low, arching and holding you close to him.",
      "\"F-fuck, _____...\" He sighed, laying limply on top of you.",
      "You pet his hair sweetly, sighing a bit.",
      "\"Well... you're free now, Rikou...\" You hummed, stirring in attempt to leave the tank.",
      "He let you go, looking at his fin.",
      "\"Right... thanks.\"",
      "He muttered.",
      "\"Maybe we'll meet again.\"",
      "She offered a small smile.",
      "\"Maybe... hopefully not.\"",
      "He huffed, folding his arms, \"We can't get caught in this... event... again.\"",
      "You nodded, dressing in your blouse and jacket, brushing yourself off.",
      "\"Yes... I agree.",
      "My crew will release you shortly.\"",
      "\"...",
      "Thank you ____.\"",
      "\"Of course.\"",
      "A creature from FF7 I believe is very attractive, skip if you'd like, a bit of an OC here.",
      "I couldn't make this smutty as hard as I tried so here is some fluff.",
      "Shinra was an evil, monotone building standing tall above the slow river of blue-blooded humans.",
      "Simply surviving was a task civilians struggled to achieve.",
      "Shinra created so many abominations unto nature that it was hard to keep track of them all.",
      "They often times just hid their creations away in the mountains, for the poor people of Nibelheim to stumble upon.",
      "You were one of those poor people.",
      "While hiking in the mountains near the reactor, resting at the manor since you knew exactly where to break into, you decided to visit the tall, stone grey, metallic death chamber and see what treasures you could find.",
      "You brought bolt clippers with you, whistling a jaunty tune without a care and breaking the chain on the door.",
      "You slipped inside, looking around the eerily brightened place, quieting your song.",
      "Bright blues danced on the walls like the shine of a swimming pool, mako streamed below your feet making use of the name \"lifestream\".",
      "You looked around for any shiny things you could salvage for money.",
      "Strange tubes filled with mako lined the stairs up to the door leading to the inner reactor.",
      "You peered into the tube.",
      "Is there anything actually in there...?",
      "You asked yourself.",
      "You wiped the dust off the glass and hummed, stepping back when you couldn't find anything.",
      "\"This place is surprisingly clean...\" You hummed.",
      "The sharp sound of steam releasing startled you into a jump.",
      "You hid behind the tubes, glancing over the glass to the tube that was falling open, holding a weird, humanoid form as it slept.",
      "You waited many moments, slowly standing.",
      "The creature was asleep, its jaw was exposed with teeth sharp enough to tear meat right off the bone.",
      "His claws and body were a beautiful shade of blue, his calfs changing to an odd goldfish orange.",
      "He blinked awake, slowly rising and rubbing his eyes.",
      "Aww~ He got to his feet and started jittering energetically.",
      "He acted like he had just ingested 400lbs of pure caffeine.",
      "He looked around the room, racing to the other tubes and tapping on the glass, hissing growls exiting his teeth questioningly.",
      "You forgot that you were standing, tilting your head as he focused on you.",
      "He tilted his head back.",
      "\"Uh...",
      "hi.\"",
      "You muttered.",
      "He ran up to you, startling you onto your ass.",
      "He snickered in his weird voice, pulling you back to your feet.",
      "Still holding your arm, he twisted you around, studying you and prodding your soft fleshy sides.",
      "\"Ow!",
      "Hey, quit it!\"",
      "You whined.",
      "\"Hhh...\" He hissed.",
      "He let go of you and returned to the tubes, tapping the glass, annoyed.",
      "\"What?",
      "Do you want to wake them up?\" You asked.",
      "He glanced at you, then to the tube, tapping.",
      "You went to the tube and knelt by the side, checking for any switches or buttons to open it.",
      "Seems there was none.",
      "\"Sorry, dude.\"",
      "You shrugged and stood back.",
      "He growled, hitting the glass now.",
      "\"Hitting it isn't going to help, maybe it releases when you're ready and not forcefully?\"",
      "That seemed to get through to him, he sat beside the tube and folded his legs to his chest, almost vibrating with all the energy he had.",
      "\"You should probably expend that energy.\"",
      "You suggested.",
      "He looked up at you, letting a hiss and shaking his head.",
      "\"Alright, bye then.\"",
      "You turned to leave.",
      "A sudden and large weight snagged your leg, tripping you.",
      "You yelped as you fell, landing on your face.",
      "\"Fuck, why!?\" You glared at your leg.",
      "He was hanging onto you, whining.",
      "\"What do you want from me?\" \"Grrurr....\" \"Speak English!\"",
      "You barked, frustrated.",
      "He flinched and let you go, retreating aside like a wounded animal.",
      "You rolled your eyes and left the reactor as quickly as your feet would take you.",
      "The creature watched you from the door, twitching.",
      "\"Grrurr....?\" You haven't returned to the reactor since, nor have you seen of the odd humanoid.",
      "The citizens of Nibelheim continued to travel up the same mountain but they haven't seen the creature either.",
      "At least no one you asked did.",
      "You were strangely curious what happened to it, gathering your things to head back to the reactor.",
      "There was a knock at your door.",
      "\"Right now?",
      "Uh",
      "...",
      "Okay.\"",
      "You went to answer it.",
      "You stared at the blue scales of someone familiar.",
      "\"Reactor dude?\" You wondered, craning your neck in order to look at him.",
      "\"Shiku.\"",
      "He answered, somewhat stilted.",
      "\"You can talk now?\" You hummed.",
      "\"Learned...",
      "Why leave?\"",
      "He asked you, upset.",
      "You sighed and leaned on the doorframe.",
      "\"Because I have a home?\" You huffed.",
      "He frowned, stepping inside your home.",
      "You growled, trying to appear dominant despite your obvious lack of height.",
      "\"Hey!",
      "I didn't say you could come in.",
      "Out, out, out!\"",
      "You barked, pushing his shoulders.",
      "Shiku whined, totally confused why you were being so aggressive.",
      "\"But I...!\"",
      "He started as the door slammed.",
      "\"Fucking animal...\" You growled.",
      "He bellowed at the door, clawing the wood helplessly.",
      "You covered your ears, trying to block him out.",
      "But it kinda hurt.",
      "Not your ears, but it stung inside.",
      "He had no one, his family is still undeveloped, so you're all he has.",
      "You groaned and opened the ragged door.",
      "Shiku lowered his claws, splintered wood still trapped in them.",
      "\"Friend...?\"",
      "He mewed.",
      "You allowed him into your home.",
      "He sprinted inside, looking into everything and scattering pillows.",
      "\"Calm down, Shiku.\"",
      "You muttered.",
      "\"Friend has nice nest.\"",
      "He hummed, putting everything back in its place and crouching by the potted plants.",
      "You sat on your couch and watched him study your home.",
      "Shiku made himself as small as possible.",
      "\"Friend is angry...\" \"You noticed?\" You sarcastically shot back.",
      "He nodded, laying his head on the couch beside you.",
      "He studied you closely, pushing himself up onto the seat and sitting beside you.",
      "\"Friend Lonely?\"",
      "\"What makes you think that?\" You wondered.",
      "He sniffed the air, picking up a picture from the side table.",
      "It was one of your family in Wutai, the ceremonial garments were brightly colored.",
      "He could tell that those humans don't live there if they did there would be more scents.",
      "\"Only you in nest.\"",
      "\"Brilliant deduction.",
      "What do you want?\" You returned to the initial question at hand.",
      "\"Alone too.\"",
      "\"Well you aren't staying here, you're leaving as soon as I can get you out.\"",
      "You folded your arms, glaring at him.",
      "Shiku snorted at you, nudging your shoulder with his cheek.",
      "\"Friend mean...\" He sighed, laying his head on your lap.",
      "You stiffened, watching him suspiciously.",
      "He stared back at you.",
      "He had no intention other than resting his horned head.",
      "The horns prodded your legs uncomfortably, his breath hissing over his teeth.",
      "His eyes flickered over your face, hands folded together calmly.",
      "His energy has subdued this meeting.",
      "He wasn't jittery this time, you wondered if that was just a \"first-day\" thing.",
      "Your hesitant hand graced his horns softly.",
      "\"What are you doing, Shiku?\" You sighed.",
      "He tilted his head slightly.",
      "\"Doing?\"",
      "\"You keep acting like a sad puppy.\"",
      "You giggled softly.",
      "He closed his eyes and tapped his claw to your temple.",
      "\"Friend lonely.",
      "Angry.",
      "Shiku help.\"",
      "He folded his hands back together.",
      "\"Friend help too.\"",
      "He rolled onto his side, letting an arm hang off the side of the couch.",
      "He started snoring, breathing calmly and keeping you warm.",
      "You sighed and shook your head.",
      "\"Fine, friend will help.\"",
      "Naga boi meeting This one ended up being really long (for a one-shot, past 4 pages is really long), so I'll cut it into two.",
      "Oh, btw I'm back.",
      "Yeah, I wanted to focus on original works.",
      "Well, while they're being edited I'll start working on this again.",
      "This and a One Piece fanfic I've been trying to start for a while.",
      "The jungles were hot, wet, and crowded.",
      "You adjusted the backpack on your shoulders and wiped the screen of your camera nervously.",
      "Various jungle song rang above and around you with no end, threatening your very presence.",
      "You gulped slightly, eyes darting over the shadows.",
      "\"This creature better show up soon...\" You thought nervously, checking the creature photos on your camera.",
      "The previous photos were all obvious fakes.",
      "A log in a lake, a homeless man in the woods, a weird fish with plastic stuck to it.",
      "You huffed with a bit of renewed determination and trudged through the vegetation.",
      "You came upon a river clearing, thankfully resting on a boulder and shrugging the backpack off your shoulders.",
      "You aired out your shirt, cracking your back.",
      "\"Gosh...",
      "I don't think there's really a man snake here...\" A melancholic groan escaped as you dug through your bag for your notebook, flipping it to the page littered with man-snake notes messily scribbled by the villagers.",
      "Nagas eat all beasts, humans included.",
      "Nagas are vicious, primitive beasts, relying on teeth and tails.",
      "Nagas are not intelligent.",
      "You pursed your lips.",
      "None of these even attempted to tell you what they may look like.",
      "Are they snake-headed?",
      "Are they entirely scaley?",
      "You smiled to yourself while imagining the possible outcomes.",
      "Maybe this wasn't such a bad hand.",
      "And it would be so interesting to see.",
      "I sudden noise startled you from your thoughts.",
      "Something large moved far too close for comfort.",
      "You drew your legs up onto the boulder and readied your camera, peering through your camera screen for whatever moved.",
      "\"W-who's there!?\" You barked instinctively, biting your tongue for expecting an animal t- \"Hassssn't anyone told you not to exsssplore alone?\"",
      "A hissing voice responded sharply.",
      "\"Wh...?",
      "Oh, hah hah, nice trick.",
      "Whoever you are, it isn't going to scare me.",
      "I know Nagas don't exist,\" You descended from the rock and slung your backpack back over your shoulder, \"Just another stupid person getting excited...\" Whoever was tricking you decided they would haul themselves awkwardly into the clearing.",
      "You ignored them, shaking your head.",
      "To think you were actually excited to see what this snake man would look like.",
      "\"I'm pretty sssssure I'm real...\" The odd breathy hiss was much closer now.",
      "\"Stop that...\" You growled, \"Fake hissing won't make me believe you.\"",
      "You stomped away, not getting far before you tripped on an unexpected log.",
      "You caught yourself, backpack slamming against your back, cutting up your hands and knocking some air out of you.",
      "\"Watch it!\"",
      "His taut voice pierced your pained whine.",
      "The log was pulled away from you swiftly.",
      "\"I watch it!?",
      "Fucking what's with putting a log behind me!?\" You screeched, jumping to your feet to confront the trickster.",
      "His chest was immediately at eye level, you had to step back to meekly meet his piercing gaze directly.",
      "His... eyes were rather round, with sharply pointed pupils, his angular face was intimidating with a largely defined jaw, his neck somewhat elongated.",
      "You stumbled back farther, fumbling for your camera and shakily snapping a picture of this tall, defined dangerous creature.",
      "\"What wassss that?\"",
      "He suspiciously looked you over.",
      "Your words lost their way from your brain to your throat.",
      "All you could do was stare, mouth agape.",
      "He snatched your camera and looked at it, trying to figure it out.",
      "\"What issssssss this thing?",
      "What did you do?\"",
      "He shook the machine and attempted peering through it.",
      "\"I-It's just a... a camera...\" You carefully took it back from him, picking out the picture you just snapped and showing it to him.",
      "He glared at you and studied the picture, squinting slightly.",
      "\"Er...\" He hummed, getting closer and tilting his head, \"I...\" \"Is something wrong with the picture?\" You curiously looked at the photo.",
      "It was a picture of him, low angle, shadows cast down his chest, lifting many of his scars into view and making him appear very rugged.",
      "\"Nothing issss wrong with it.",
      "Jusssst leave, or I'll poisssson you.\"",
      "He snapped, slithering off into the dark forest, the last of his charcoal brown drizzled burning orange scaled tail snapped out of view without a trace.",
      "You had to take a moment to process.",
      "All you could think of was his ashy gray hair and beautiful scales.",
      "His amazingly captivating brown eyes.",
      "You checked your photo, you couldn't see any of his tail.",
      "Shit...",
      "You huffed and ran through the vines, following the flattened grass to a thick tree.",
      "You peered up the tree, searching for him.",
      "\"Hey!",
      "S-Snake guy!?\"",
      "You called up the tree.",
      "A few birds scattered, but nothing answered.",
      "You climbed up the tree a while, catching your breath before cupping your hands around your mouth.",
      "\"Snake guy!?\"",
      "He drops from the top of the tree, catching himself on a branch around your height with his long tail.",
      "He folded his arms and glared at you, hanging upside down.",
      "\"It'sssss Igassssssha...",
      "What do you want?\"",
      "He growled.",
      "You dug your camera out of your bag and prepared it for the next photo.",
      "\"The last picture I got wasn't good enough,\" You wiggle a bit and get as comfortable as you can on your branch, \"Can I get another one?\" Igasha eyeballs you, raising his brow suspiciously.",
      "\"Why?\"",
      "\"It's a lot to explain, but basically I just have to prove to the locals you exist.\"",
      "You smile, testing out the lighting filters on your legs.",
      "Igasha shakes his head and hoists himself back up above you.",
      "\"No. I don't need more humansssss invading my territory.\"",
      "He sighed, almost dejected.",
      "You followed him, your camera slipping slightly, luckily you could snatch it up before it fell.",
      "\"W-well if they know you exist maybe they'll leave you alone since they would know the threat exists?\" You suggest, panting a bit.",
      "Igasha glances down at you, bending backward and meeting your face from above.",
      "\"I know humanssss...",
      "That'sssss never how it worksssss.",
      "Jusssssst leave me alone.\"",
      "He pulls back, but before he can leave you, you grab his shoulder and stammer nervously.",
      "\"W-wait!\"",
      "You blurt.",
      "He cocks a brow at you, nearing the cliff of his patience.",
      "You remove your small hand from his powerful shoulder, gulping a bit.",
      "\"I-I mean...",
      "I just...",
      "I'll probably never see a Naga again... could I just get a souvenir picture?\" You murmur, shaking the camera with a small laugh.",
      "He sighs and waves a dismissive hand, shaking his head.",
      "\"Fine...\" You lean back on your branch, trying to get as much of his enormous, chocolate drizzled, burnt orange tail as possible.",
      "The sunlight shimmering on it is so beautiful...",
      "He was certainly fed up with you, but you could swear a hint of amusement pulled at his lips.",
      "His chocolate eyes still held strained annoyance at you though.",
      "You snap the picture and check the quality, smiling and nodding to him.",
      "\"Perfect!\"",
      "You flashed a thumb up.",
      "Igasha climbed away quickly.",
      "\"Good, now leave.\"",
      "\"Right... thanks, Igasha.",
      "Maybe I'll see you again while looking for another monster?\" You wonder, tilting your head.",
      "He laughs and escapes your view.",
      "You frowned and picked your way to the bottom of the tree.",
      "You bounded through the jungle, ecstatic to finally have proof of a monster.",
      "You ran to the edge of the jungle, breaking through and reaching the village.",
      "Panting heavily and leaning on the wall.",
      "A villager approached you curiously, almost surprised you returned.",
      "You raised your camera triumphantly as he approached, breathlessly laughing.",
      "The villager took your camera and checked the 2 new photos, racing to the leaders.",
      "You slid to the ground and aired out your shirt again.",
      "You wondered what the villagers were going to do with your camera.",
      "Straining a bit, you rose to your feet and went to knock on the door when you heard something alarming.",
      "\"It's just an animal, who would care?\"",
      "The camera snatcher said.",
      "\"He appears to be a large beast.",
      "It would take the would village to capture him.\"",
      "Replied the leader.",
      "\"The girl got the damn thing to pose for her, she could probably trick him into coming here.",
      "We'll just ambush him like that!\"",
      "You stepped back, shaking your head incredulously and balling your fists.",
      "Before all your thoughts could come together, you fled back into the jungle to try and protect an innocent monster.",
      "Vines entangled your legs and tripped you several times in your trek.",
      "You cut them away and groaned in exasperation.",
      "It wasn't this hard to get there the first time.",
      "The large tree Igasha had vanished in finally loomed over you, the sun setting behind the dense treeline.",
      "You climbed up as far as you could, reaching a point where the branches above were too far to reach.",
      "You leaned on the trunk and caught your breath, checking the time on your phone. 19:46, it's getting late...",
      "\"I'm going to die out here...\" You thought, straightening and nodding to yourself.",
      "You took a deep breath.",
      "\"Igasha!!\"",
      "You called, cupping your mouth and emptying your lungs.",
      "Your mouth was covered by a large, clawed hand.",
      "He shushed you and pulled you higher with him, dodging wandering flashlights from below.",
      "He wraps you in his huge tail, suspending you beside him.",
      "You peered below at the villagers searching for the two of you.",
      "Igasha glared at them, glancing at you and pulling away.",
      "\"I knew thissss would happen.\"",
      "He muttered bitterly.",
      "\"I didn't know this would happen,\" You huffed, going limp and dangling, \"I was just told to get proof, they didn't tell me what would happen if I did it...\" \"That'sss what they all sssay... we'll thisss time I'm not sssparing the idiot.\"",
      "He growls, descending the tree and carrying you away.",
      "You struggle to flee, but he covers your mouth and squeezes you with his tail, \"Don't try it.\"",
      "He warns simply.",
      "He carried you away to a dark grotto hidden in a tangled mess of closely growing trees and flowers.",
      "He finally lets you go, dropping you into a mess of fur and bones.",
      "You yelp and smack a skull away from you, wiping your hand off on your shorts.",
      "Igasha bunches his tail around the grotto, tapping his claws on himself.",
      "\"Where is this?\" You ask fearfully.",
      "\"You never told me your name...\" He mutters, tilting his head at you.",
      "You pause a moment and blink.",
      "\"I asked you a question.\"",
      "You reiterate, irritated.",
      "\"This isss my grotto.",
      "My nessst...\" Igasha throws you assorted pelts and rests on his tail, turned away from you, \"I ate already...\" You lay the pelts out and lay on them, curling up slightly.",
      "\"...",
      "My name is _____.\"",
      "You hum quietly.",
      "Igasha barely stirs.",
      "\"Cool...\" SEXY TIME BOIIIIS I MEAN GIRRRRRRLS You awoke early the next morning with an aching stomach, curling tightly and whining softly, trying not to wake up Igasha.",
      "You sit up and look around the grotto, shivering at all the bones scattered around you.",
      "Igasha slept soundly in his scaley pile, sunlight dappling his dark, tan skin.",
      "He groans and tightens his coil, arm dangling, hand resting on the grass.",
      "You brushed yourself off and tried to pull yourself out of the grotto, but the opening in the trees was too high for you to climb over.",
      "You slid back to the middle of the nest and sighed, watching Igasha as he slept.",
      "His body rose and fell slowly, the rhythm of his breath rolling through his tail.",
      "His hair covered his eyes, his sharpened teeth showing from slightly parted lips.",
      "His arms were about as scarred as his chest, faint paint circling his wrists.",
      "You hum quietly and approach him, crawling up to his pile of tail and leaning on him.",
      "You tilt your head and whine softly, nudging him.",
      "\"Igasha?\" You mew.",
      "\"You're not a sssmart human....",
      "Are you...?\"",
      "He groans, not budging from his comfortable rest.",
      "\"Guess not.",
      "Do you have anything to eat around here?\" You shrug and move a bone out from under you.",
      "\"I do...\" Igasha opens one eye, pulling his arm back and resting his head on it.",
      "You purse your lips and put your chin on his tail, nose to nose with him.",
      "\"So can I eat?\"",
      "\"I don't have anything.\"",
      "He huffed, snorting at you.",
      "You shook your head and bapped his hands.",
      "\"You just said you had food!\"",
      "You exclaim.",
      "Igasha shakes his head, straightening and stretching.",
      "He wraps his tail around you and rises, towering over your small human form.",
      "You shrunk into his coils, tensing terribly while a wild grin stretched his face.",
      "\"I do...",
      "You're my food~\" He chuckled darkly.",
      "\"W-w-w-wait.",
      "Really...!",
      "I-I didn't do anything to you...!!\"",
      "\"True....~\" He lifts you up with his tail, \"then you have to make a pact with me.\"",
      "\"Anything!\"",
      "You beg, clasping your hands together and tearing up at the thought of dying in the jungle.",
      "\"Never lead the village to me again.\"",
      "He tosses you out of the enclosed nest and hisses.",
      "You flail in the air and land in the mud, coughing and shaking the mud off.",
      "You wince slightly, sighing.",
      "You scrambled to your feet and look back at the tree spiral, frowning.",
      "You don't know why, but... you were... seriously heated when he towered over you with that terrible grin.",
      "You...",
      "Kinda wanted it to get bad.",
      "Maybe in another circumstance...",
      "\"Stop it... that's disgusting...\" You turned away and hurried back to the village, hitching a plane back home.",
      "You didn't want to think about this trip... maybe photographing monsters isn't wise, especially since a majority of the rumors you chase are fake anyway.",
      "You sighed softly, looking out the plane window, watching the jungle disappear below a sea of clouds.",
      "The thought of the enclosed nest caught your blank mind again, the feeling of his tail around you, holding you tight, the waxy scales pressed against your tired, dirty flesh.",
      "You shuddered slightly.",
      "\"Why is that so... enticing...?\" You thought, whining to yourself.",
      "You hold your arm, shivers rising up through your whole body everytime the feeling of his scales dances on your skin.",
      "You press your legs together and rest your head on the glass.",
      "\"Just forget it...\" You scold yourself, closing your eyes to sleep.",
      "Maybe you'll forget when you wake up.",
      "You're startled awake by a flight attendant gripping your shoulder.",
      "She pulls back looking concerned, pointing to the window.",
      "\"Ma'am, it's time to wake up, we're at the airport.\"",
      "She said, taking the last bag from the overhead and placing it in the chair beside you.",
      "You look outside and rub your eyes, nodding slightly before grabbing your things, leaving slowly while sleep still hangs on your eyes.",
      "It was much colder here than the jungle.",
      "You pulled your heavy coat from your bag and fluffed the big fuzzy collar around your neck.",
      "You fold your arms and wander through crowds of people to make it home, silent all the while.",
      "---- You woke with a start in the night, sweating and holding yourself.",
      "You had no memory of climbing into bed and passing out, but you were suddenly panting fearfully in your dark room.",
      "You slammed back down onto your pillow, staring at the pitch ceiling and trying to calm down.",
      "Igasha's scales ghosted along your skin again, the memory of his constriction and closeness to you wouldn't leave you alone.",
      "Your hands skimmed along your stomach, reaching to your warm core.",
      "You gasped softly and bit your lip, your fingers slipping into your thin panties and teasing your clit carefully with cold fingers.",
      "You squirmed slightly, imagining Igasha's long, forked tongue skillfully taking in every taste of you.",
      "Your heart fluttered, seeing his sharp eyes in your mind studying your barely clothed body.",
      "You pulled your shirt up, tossing your panties aside and taking the toy from your side-table.",
      "You turn on your trusty vibrator and close your eyes, Igasha taking form once more and licking his teeth at you.",
      "\"Turn over~\" He purrs in his rumbling, dark voice.",
      "You obey your fantasy, letting it take your waist and thrust in roughly as you shoved the thick side of your toy in the same way.",
      "The perfect motion of this terribly rough fantasy just made you want him more.",
      "You pant, glancing back at this representation of your wanton lust and mewing his name softly.",
      "His eyes get more predatory the better he feels, raising his height to slam down into you with his whole weight, coaxing louder cries from you that he absolutely loved.",
      "You weren't sure if he would actually like your mews, but you kinda hoped he would.",
      "You push the vibrator deeper, hitting the edge of your chasm.",
      "You desperately wanted him inside you now, but the odds are decreasing as time goes on.",
      "You didn't know how...",
      "but you had to have Igasha at least once.",
      "You tighten as waves of pleasure cascade over you and exhaust your body for the rest of the night, wiping off the vibrator and putting it away.",
      "You rolled onto your side and hummed, frowning softly.",
      "You need Igasha.",
      "---- Buying tickets back to the jungle was one of the most idiotic impulses you've had in a long time, but it was going to be topped easily soon enough.",
      "You packed assorted intimacies with you just to make this encounter as beautiful as it was in your fantasy.",
      "You couldn't let the village see you, however.",
      "You sneak from the airport to the jungle itself immediately, avoiding the village.",
      "The jungle is rather dense in this area, slowing your progress terribly.",
      "You push all the vines and vegetation aside, lugging a heavy bag over your shoulder.",
      "\"C'mon... I'm pretty sure his nest is this way.\"",
      "You huffed, leaning against a tree and folding your arms.",
      "\"What are you doing here?\"",
      "A familiar voice growled.",
      "You brightened and turned, smiling wide.",
      "Igasha's fangs are bloodied, his eyebrow cocked as he glared down at you.",
      "\"I... I had to see you again!\"",
      "You admit to him.",
      "He sighs and shakes his head, slithering past you.",
      "\"I told you to leave.\"",
      "He growls, ignoring you.",
      "You race after him and take his hand, tugging on him.",
      "\"No! Please!",
      "I... I really had to see you!",
      "I can't get you off my mind!\"",
      "You cry.",
      "Igasha purses his lips, looking aside and checking for any witnesses.",
      "He coils around you and carries you with him, huffing.",
      "\"You humansss are ssso irrational... fine,\" He mutters, \"You're lucky it'sss my mating ssseassson...\" You giggled excitedly, clutching your bag close.",
      "Igasha brought you to his enclosed nest, setting you inside and following after, folding his arms.",
      "You set the bag aside and opened it.",
      "He took your shoulder and pushed the bag away with his burnt orange tail.",
      "\"We won't need any of that human ssshit.\"",
      "Igasha says as he takes your wrists and pins you to the tree.",
      "You blush as he studies you.",
      "He rips your clothes off and smirks at your natural form.",
      "You felt a bit self conscious, but you wouldn't shy away now.",
      "\"Hm... well, you're ssscertainly a beauty...~\" He chuckles, nipping your neck and chest, leaving little marks all over you.",
      "You squirmed slightly, brushing your leg up against his masculine side and grazed his waxy scales.",
      "\"Thank you~\" You giggled.",
      "Igasha licks up your neck to your jaw and nips your earlobe.",
      "\"Are you fresssh?\"",
      "He hums.",
      "\"Fresh?\" You mutter.",
      "Without answering, he pushes two, long, clawed fingers into your moist chasm and thrusts them slowly, a surprised gasp following your flinch.",
      "Igasha chuckles, adding another finger and thrusting a tad faster.",
      "\"Hm, ssseemsss not...",
      "but that'sss fine.",
      "Makesss thisss easssier.\"",
      "He hisses, pulling his hand back and cleaning them off with that enticing ribbon of a tongue.",
      "Your face became even more flush, your breath hastening.",
      "He took your waist and pulled you close to his tail, his stiff piece pressing against you.",
      "You glanced down at it, eyes widening.",
      "It wasn't above average, but the thickness was almost frightening.",
      "Igasha pulls back a bit and sucks your nipple, thrusting sharply into you and stretching you.",
      "You arched and gripped his arms, wrapping your legs around him.",
      "He teases your nipples with his forked tongue and sharp teeth.",
      "You absolutely loved the feeling of his daggers gently tugging and pinching your soft mounds.",
      "His tail slides under your backside, raising you and angling his thrusts.",
      "You rock with him, your legs tight around him, getting used to his thickness.",
      "\"Igasha...\" You pant, softly giggling, \"Harder~\" Igasha raises his brow, smirking and kissing your neck.",
      "\"Of courssse~\" He purrs, slamming harder and beautifully grunting each time.",
      "The symphony of your noises gradually crescendoed, ringing through the forest as the evening fell upon the jungle.",
      "Your snake lover rolls you onto your stomach and rolls his hips, pressing your back to his chest and massaging your breasts.",
      "He nibbles your ear and pants shakily, keeping you supported under him.",
      "\"____...\" He panted sweetly, his breath grazing your ear and causing you to shiver.",
      "\"I-Igasha...~\" You return, rubbing his defined stomach and biting your lip.",
      "He groans, laying back and allowing you some space, keeping a hand on your ample bottom.",
      "\"Ngh... I didn't think a human would feel thisss good...\" He hisses weakly.",
      "You smirk, bouncing on him and hugging his chocolate drizzles.",
      "He combs his claws through his hair and grits his teeth, \"Ssstop it, you'll make me come.\"",
      "He warns through his teeth.",
      "You giggle and get off his throbbing piece, facing him before re-mounting.",
      "\"That's kinda the point, love.\"",
      "You smile, kissing his lips and rocking quickly.",
      "His breath begins to hasten as well, gripping the nesting beneath them.",
      "You try to straighten, but he holds you against him, limiting your movement and dealing the final thrusts himself, spilling his inhuman seed into you.",
      "You gasped and struggled slightly.",
      "\"Igasha, what the hell!?\" You cried.",
      "He twitches a bit, finally letting you go.",
      "\"What?",
      "That'sss what you wanted isssn't it?\"",
      "He tilted his head, nearly breathless.",
      "You want to slap him, but your body wouldn't respond.",
      "You laid on his chest, shivering a little when a bit of his love spills out of you.",
      "\"...",
      "You suck...\" You huff.",
      "He chuckles and pets your head.",
      "\"And you are going home in the morning.\""

Fuck me sideways, she wasn't kidding. \"It's after Sweet Charity,\" she says, unnecessarily. \"My mum and dad's favourite musical.\" I just about manage not to roll my eyes. Seriously, what parent looks at their brand-new baby daughter and thinks I know, I'll call her after a woman famous for being fucked over by men? I swear to god if I live to be a hundred I will never understand straight people. \"I'm Grace,\" I say. \"My mothers were Jefferson Airplane fans.\" The plural's a test; she doesn't bat an eyelid. \"Nice to meet you, Grace. I love that band.\" She sings a few bars of White Rabbit in her small clear voice. \"One pill makes you larger, and one pill makes you small, and the ones that mother gives you don't do anything at all...\" It's a million miles from the edge Grace Slick puts on that song, and it couldn't be loucher if it tried. Christ, the punters'll eat her up with a spoon. \"Don't let H catch you singing that,\" I say. \"He's touchy about drugs.\" We've never been busted yet; not successfully, at least. \"OK,\" she says, meek as you like. \"Thanks, Grace.\" Sweet Charity. What the actual fuck. She's been on the books for a week when Jay breezes in. Takes one look at Charity and goes into full-on Baby I Can Make You A Star mode, talking screentests and recording contracts. The routine's as old as the hills but it sweeps them off their feet every time, and Charity's no different. Her lips are redder, eyes dark with excitement. She's twisting a strand of her hair between her fingers. All the signs. I know how this one ends. Been there, done that, ripped up the t-shirt and used it for dusters. Fallen for the swagger, the bluster, the honey of words. Then one day you wake up in the departure lounge nursing your bruises, patching yourself together again. Knowing you were had, like a pint or a kebab. I don't want that to happen to her. Not that it's any of my fucking business, but I like the kid, OK? No point trying to warn her off. She's dazed and starry-eyed already, she's not going to listen. She's living up to her name, God help her. Hopefully Ever After. Instead, I offer to help draw up the agreement with Jay. Like I tell them both, if there's one thing I know by now, it's how to draft a contract. And I put in a clause that gives Charity an out. One tiny, dull, easily overlooked sentence, buried in the small print. She reads straight past it, but it'll be there for when she needs it. And if she wants to come back, I'll be here.",

    "text": "\"I have an idea,\" he says, looking at her bright-eyed with focused intensity. Eurydice props herself up on an elbow, the sheets rustling beneath her. \"Oh, no,\" she deadpans. She expects him to swat at her playfully, but the expression on his face is one hundred percent serious. \"What?\" She asks. Orpheus pulls in a slow breath like he's steeling himself. \"Let's get married,\" he blurts. Eurydice laughs so hard she falls flat on her back on the thin mattress. \"I'm--I'm sorry, what?\" The bed creaks wearily as Orpheus sits up. Eurydice sits too, turning again to face him. Now he looks a little afraid. \"I don't know you.\" It comes out cagey and accusatory and she hates herself a little bit for the way it makes him wince. \"And what's the point when one or both of us will probably be in the ground by this time next year, times being what they are?\" His short, sharp inhale makes her think of someone wounded. Don't, she expects him to say. What he says instead is: \"Exactly.\" She restrains herself from pulling him close; from telling him it will all be okay. She can't lie to him, and anyway, avoidant little dipshit though he might be, he's sure as hell not stupid. \"If we do this,\" she says, \"You can't bury your head in the sand. You can't pretend things are okay when they're not.\" The brief butterfly-flight of his hopeful smile makes her ache. \"I know,\" he says. \"I won't.\" \"I'm serious. If you check out on me--\" He takes both her hands in his. His expression is so earnest that for a moment she could almost forget that he's a guy who doesn't know how to deal with reality. \"I won't, okay?\" His voice cracks. She can feel how desperately he wants to believe his own lie and the tight knot in her throat bursts from bud to bloom, threatening to suffocate her. She chokes it down, shutting her eyes tightly for a moment and then opening them again. \"I promise,\" he says. And suddenly she thinks: Why the fuck not? Why shouldn't I get my shot at happiness? Why shouldn't we have time together? \"Okay,\" she says, and thinks fiercely to herself: I can be strong enough for both of us. \"Okay.\" When she leans in to kiss him, the voice in her head says: Who's in denial now?",

    "text": "The guards have yet to seal the cave. The large stone before it has been left pushed aside by order of the king. My fingers tremble as I place my hand on its cool surface. I need to go inside, but I do not want to see what I know lies in the darkness. My mother used to throw her hands in the air when I was young and prone to hiding behind her skirts when I felt shy, which was far too often. \"Ismene, you are much too old for that. Be brave, like your sister.\" Antigone would laugh with a haughty toss of her honey-coloured hair. \"She does not know how.\" She was right. My mother and sister were both women of courage and conviction, while I have only ever been timid and faltering. I am not brave, but perhaps I can pretend. I breathe deeply, and step inside. Light streams thinly through the entrance, and it takes my eyes a moment to adjust. Every step I take feels as if stones have been tied to my shoes. I want to close my eyes and run from this place of death, but now that I have begun I cannot stop. There is so much blood splattered on the cave walls and on the ground, like an altar after a sacrifice. Haemon's sword lies abandoned in the dirt, coated black with its master's dried blood. My belly churns, and I taste bile. A terrible creaking noise comes from the centre of the room, and I do not want to look, but I must, I must. My sister's body swings gently from the rope like an autumn leaf still clinging to a tree. Antigone had been beautiful in life and always spent hours in her room playing with cosmetics and mirrors, but now her eyes bulge from their sockets and her face is swollen and purple. How she would hate it. A sob escapes my lips as I reach out and take her cold hand. I failed her in life, but perhaps I can please her in death. She was taller than me, so I struggle to pull her down. She jerks horribly every time I tug on the rope, but finally I loosen the knot and she falls free. I put my knuckles in my mouth and bite down as the body hits the floor with a dull thud, to prevent myself from screaming. I can't stop now, I have work to do. The earth does not like when I tear at it. Each handful of dirt I steal brings agony upon me. The skin on my hands rips and bleeds. My fingernails tear off at the roots and I moan with pain every time earth touches the unbearably sensitive skin underneath. I could have used Haemon's blade to help cut through the hard-packed dirt, but it feels right that I should suffer. My task is endless, and the sun sets and the sky turns dark before I am close to finishing. I whisper prayers to whatever god might hear them, although I am sure that they turned their backs on my family the moment my father halted in front of Laius' chariot. When I am finished, I pull Antigone into the hole by her underarms. I don't look at her bloated face as I push the dirt on top of her lifeless body, I don't say goodbye. I tremble from pain and exhaustion when Antigone is finally swallowed by the earth. I should feel satisfaction upon completing my gruesome task, but I don't. I collapse on top of her grave, and with the last of my strength I reach for the hilt of Haemon's sword. My arms shake as my ruined hands lift the blade, and I distantly hear the harsh panting of my own breath. Let the curse on the house of Oedipus end. I am not brave, but I can pretend.",

    "text": "\"Why can't you ever just think of what I want?!\" I storm out of the house, wishing there was a door in the house I could slam so hard it would fall out of its hinges. I scream as loudly as I can to let off some steam, steadily gathering more strange looks from the mortals working on the fields surrounding their houses. Behind me, my angry strides leave a trail of dead flowers behind. Normally, all nature grows heartily in my presence, since that is basically my job description, but today is not normal. My mother Demeter thinks it would be good for my honour to accept the marriage proposal made to me by Apollo, but I refuse to marry him. Everyone always thinks he is the definition of sunshine, feasts and music. Us gods know better, though. He has had infamous affairs and will explode at the slightest provocation. This is especially true in his love life, hence why I'm stalking from my mother in my rage. It is childish, looks like a hissie fit, but I know I couldn't be held responsible for my actions had I stayed. Sadly, this if far from the first time something of the likes has happened. She constantly treats me like a child and acts as if I can't take care of myself. I'm a goddess for gods' sake! Who does she think she is?! Wait, don't answer that. She is absolutely not more powerful than I am, that's just a myth... Knowing I would destroy the mortals' harvest should I continue my rampage through the fields, I turn to my left as soon as I come across a small path into the forest. I let myself be surrounded by nature and slowly feel my anger seep away into the ground, causing some of the stones around me to crack. When I feel like I've calmed down enough not to destroy the entire forest in my hissie fit, I leave the path and sneak through the trees, helping some dying flowers on the way back to recovery while aimlessly wandering in my favourite place in the world. When I come across a small trickle of water, I follow it upstream, walking with my feet in the water as soon as the stream gets broad enough. The feeling of the cold water is soothing and refreshing. I don't care that my sandals or dress get wet, it just feels good, the water rushing over my feet. The farther I walk, the clearer the sounds of a slightly lisping whisper become. When I pass a curtain of hanging plants, a serene clearing appears in front of me, complete with pond, cascade and anthousa combing her hair. The nymph appears to be the daughter of a wood and water nymph, tending to the flowers around her own pond. I quietly join her on her rock in the middle of the pond, loath to disturb the serenity. I conjure a pastel pink flower and offer it to her as a silent peace offering and she braids it into her waist length hair. When she has finished the entire process, she looks up and gives me a knowing smile. \"You are troubled, mistress,\" she states softly. Being a goddess myself and all, I can't say I'm really surprised she seems to know more than she should, so I just roll with it. \"Pfft, tell me about it,\" I say and I proceed to tell her the entire story. She listens attentively and smiles genuinely at some of my outbursts. She actually starts giggling when I shiver at the mere prospect of marrying Apollo. Slowly, but surely, our conversation tips into gossiping. \"I'm not really supposed to know what's happening upstairs, but I so happened to catch a sinfully delicious rumour,\" the nymph tells me. \"Have you perhaps ever heard of the nymph Echo?\" I tap my chin with my index finger and nod. \"The name does ring a bell, but I don't think I've ever met her, why?\" \"Rumour has it that she has gone and fallen in love with a mortal.\" \"No!\" I gasp, scandalised. \"I thought the Olympus had decided that demigods were not supposed to be created anymore?\" \"Oh, but if the rumours are even remotely close to reality, that won't be happening soon. See, Echo was pretty talkative. Too talkative. So Hera cursed her so she is only able to repeat the last three words of the last sentence she has heard. Now this is where it becomes interesting. Echo fell in love with Narcissus. He, however, thinks he is more beautiful than even the gods and therefore rejects everyone who offers their love to him. Echo is now stuck hanging around the clearing where he lives, only able to say the words of his rejection.\" I laugh heartily. \"You can say from Hera what you may, but she has taste. Teaches Echo not to mess with our ways.\" The nymph shrugs. \"Well, it still is kind of sad. But enough of that now. So, your mother is planning to marry you to Apollo? That sounds... like a bit of a dread, really.\" I roll my eyes. \"Tell me about it. He is so... so... irritating. He really thinks he is the best you can get. And oh, that smug grin, I just want to claw my eyes out every time I see it. Wholly annoying.\" I let myself fall on my back on the rock we're sitting on and stare at the sky. \"Maybe it's time for me to head back. My mom will be furious.\" The nymph nods her head solemnly and gives me a encouraging, albeit a bit mysterious and even mischievous, smile. \"Probably, yes. But I think you can spare some time before you should really go back.\" She points towards the trees to her right. \"If you go that way, just straight ahead, you'll find another clearing, just like this one, where Echo will probably hang around to pine after Narcissus. When you continue to walk, you'll find a second clearing, which has far more flowers.\" My face lights up. \"Flowers?\" I might sound like a typical teenage girl, but I don't care. Meadows with flowers usually are the only thing that can really cheer me up when I'm down. When the nymph nods again, I stand up from the rock and take her hands in mine. \"Thank you. I really needed to get this all of my chest.\" \"You're welcome.\" I turn around and jump in the water, swimming towards the trees she pointed out earlier. The water of the lake is heavenly cool, and that says something. I know the waters on the Olympus, and this comes really close. Dripping from head to toe, I eventually climb out of the water on the far end of the lake and start walking into the forest, the birds chirping high in the sky and the insects buzzing. Everywhere I walk, flowers start to grow, from the smallest daisies to enormous roses. Soon, I stumble across the first clearing the nymph talked about. And indeed, a guy that can only be Narcissus is perched on the edge of a small pond, staring into the water. A second look confirms that he is lovestrickenly staring at his own reflection. How has Echo ever fallen for him? He obviously doesn't care for anything except for his own reflection in the crystal clear water. Echo is lingering at the edge of the clearing, every now and then stretching out her arms in Narcissus's reflection, constantly repeating the words, \"... never love you.\" She keeps trying to swallow the first word, but it still sounds like she is rejecting him over and over again. My heart clenches and I avert my eyes, aiming for the other clearing the nymph told me about. I am deeply in need of some positive energy, consisting mainly of flowers, but my mood does not brighten when I see the first rays of sunshine fall on the ground. I intended to stride resolutely onto the clearing, drop down between the flowers and lie there until I feel a bit better, but I stop dead in my tracks when I hear a high barking. By the sound of it, there must be at least five dogs on the clearing. Not one to back down from a challenge, I quietly approach the clearing and hide behind a broad tree. I press myself against the trunk and stick my head around to look into the clearing. The sight makes me almost squeak in delight, but I manage to control myself. On the clearing, two puppies are enthusiastically trying to push over their boss to get to the treat he's holding in his hands. However, that's not the first thing I notice. It might be a bit obvious to mortals, but it kind of jumps out when a dog has more than one head, let alone three. And there are two of them! They are absolutely adorable and I can't help but squeal softly at the almost domestic scene in front of me. I immediately slap my hand in front of my mouth, but it's too late. Just before I manage to hide behind the broad tree, I see the man's head whipping around in my direction. \"Shit, shit, shit,\" I mutter as I contemplate my options. In the roughly three seconds I think I have, three plans come up in my head. A, grow a bunch of plants to conceal me. B, jump real high and hide in between the branches of the tree. C, run as fast as I can. Sadly, neither of those plans seem to be good options. I jump when I hear a male voice. \"Hello? Who's there?\" A slight pause. \"I promise I won't hurt you.\" Hm-mmm. Yeah, right. Staying right where I am, I listen closely for any sound indicating he is approaching my hide-out. I don't hear anything, though, and the temptation to step into the sunlight and walk onto the clearing is getting bigger with the second. \"Hello?\" he calls again. Slow footsteps approach, the sound of two feet crushing grass and small, white flowers getting louder and louder. Maybe I should have listened to my mother. No, I say to myself. I have to take matters into my own hands now, if I want the life I've always dreamt of. Freedom, the choice to do every damn thing I want. A big, warm hand is placed on my shoulder, and I can't contain a squeak. \"Wow, easy.\" The man pulls his hand away. \"What are you doing here, on your own? You're not a nymph, are you?\" I squint my eyes. \"How can you tell?\" He actually looks uncomfortable, standing this close to me underneath this tree. He throws me a small, shy smile and rubs the back of his neck with one hand. When his two puppies try to jump on me, he pulls them back, calling an abrupt order which gets them quiet for a few seconds. \"Sorry.\" He crouches down, scratching their chins and looking up at me. \"They haven't had that much training yet.\" I try to bite back a smile. \"It's okay, really. At home, we don't have that many animals at all.\" \"Yeah?\" He stands up straight. Geez, he's tall. And he has the most beautiful eyes. \"Where do you live?\" I shake my head, not able to hold my smile after all. \"No, no, no, first, I want an answer on my question.\" \"What question?\" I give him an unimpressed look and try to lean casually against the tree, which I fear fails miserably. \"How you can tell I'm not a nymph?\" I ask, as if it is the most obvious thing in the world. He smirks. \"Well, firstly, nymphs don't squeak when they encounter something they are unfamiliar with.\" I huff indignantly, but he continues as if he didn't hear me. \"Secondly, I have come here often enough to know by heart which nymphs lives in this part of the forest, and I haven't seen you here before. Therefore, you can't be a nymph.\" After some consideration, he adds, \"and you can't be a mortal either, because then you would've fainted at the sight of two three-headed dogs.\" I snort and lean down to pet the six very enthusiastic puppy-heads in front of me. \"How do you know I didn't? Maybe I've mastered the art of fainting without falling down. Maybe I had just woken up and only squeaked because you were still there?\" As I get up again, the man lightly pulls the puppies to the clearing again, where he throws a small skull into the forest, sending the dogs running headlong into the trees. He turns to me again. \"Yes, apart from the fact that that's obviously the most logical explanation here, the fact that you didn't drop to your knees praying when I mentioned mortals, tells me all I need to know. Now, I don't think I caught your name?\" Damn, I was that close to convincing him I'm not who I seem to be. \"That might be because I haven't told you yet, don't you think?\" Saving him the trouble of actually asking for my name, I continue. \"My name is Kore.\" His face brightens in recognition. \"Ah, the daughter of Demeter. My lady, it is an honour to meet you.\" I squint my eyes. \"Uhmm, thanks, I guess? But who are you?\" I mean, flattering he knows who I am, but since I don't know him, it also looks a bit stalkerish... right? But hey, he has good manners. That's a plus point. And he's kinda cute. He straightens up to his full height and when he speaks again, his voice sounds just a tad more regal, proud. \"I am Hades, King of the Underworld, Ruler of Tartaros.\" My jaw drops. \"Oh my gods, you're the Hades? That's so awesome! \" He gives me a somewhat confused look. \"It is?\" Hades frowns, but before he can give me a look that is probably meant to be frightening, his dogs jump at his chest with the skull in one of the six mouths, causing Hades to fall flat on his back. This, of course, makes his next words even less powerful. \"I had actually expected a more frightened reaction...\" I reach forward to grab one of the dogs and lift it off his chest. \"But look, you're like a celebrity on Olympus. Everyone tells those stories about you, how you sacrificed yourself by choosing to be the god of the Underworld, being all noble and all.\" He arches an eyebrow from where he is still sitting on the ground and stands up while saying his next words. \"Yeah, right. I was the noble one. You know, I like the sound of that. Better than the original story. Anyway, why are you here? Shouldn't you be with your mother?\" \"Firstly, will you shut up about that ignorant... person.\" I clench my hands to fists. \"Secondly, I want to hear the real story about you becoming the god of the Underworld later. Thirdly, I've always wanted to see your palace. My mom never let me, though.\" I look up at him, the shy look on my face I always use to get something done with my father, Zeus. Hades and Zeus are brothers, maybe it'll work on him too. He huffs. \"What? You want me to bring you? No. Too dangerous.\" I groan. \"Oh, come on, you're the god of the Underworld. What could possibly happen down there when I'm with you?\" \"Kore, it's the kingdom of the Dead. That does it for most people. I'm bringing you back to your mother.\" \"No,\" I say demonstratively. I sit down in the middle of the field and start inspecting the flowers in my immediate vicinity. He looks at me, unimpressed - at least, that's what I think, because I'm definitely not looking in his direction. I'm not! \"And that should stop me from trying?\" \"I will tell everyone you raped me,\" I say casually. \"That you found me here and I asked you for help and you just... well, raped me.\" \"And you think they'll take your word over mine?\" \"Apollo definitely will. I'm off to marry him anyway. He won't like it, you defiling me.\" \"That little piece of shit can't touch me. I'll crush him like the annoying fly he is.\" Hades does start to sound irritated now, that's a start. He walks towards me. I shrug. \"Hey, same here. You think I'll let him do anything to me? But trust me, he'll try.\" When Hades reaches forward to grab my arms and pull me up, I quickly make a small cage of roots grow around me and stick out my tongue. He throws me a bitch-face and throws his hands up in surrender. \"Fine. But if anything happens to you, it's not my fault.\" Then, he actually starts to walk away, calling for his dogs, apparently called Kerberos and Rigaros, to come with him. What is he doing? And we were having so much fun! I quickly get rid of the roots and get up to follow him. I start talking to him almost non-stop, not giving him a chance to send me away. At first, he just looks annoyed, but after a while, I see his face softening into a relaxed expression. He even chuckles when I tell him the story about why I'm really hiding in the forest. \"Marrying Apollo? He's just pathetic.\" \"I know. And every nymph ever starts swooning when his name comes up. I really don't know what it is about him. He's such a douche.\" Hades seems to think for a minute. \"You know, if that's truly the reason you don't want to go home, I guess you could, I don't know, take a vacation in my place for a week?\" \"Would you do that for me? That's so sweet! Especially for the god of the Underworld,\" I smirk. \"If you don't stop emphasizing that, I will withdraw the invitation.\" \"Alright, alright, I'll stop. You wuss,\" I say under my breath with a roll of my eyes. \"What did you just say?\" He turns around with a thunderous expression, stopping in the process, but his eyes show mirth. \"You know, I could always have Kerberos or Rigaros tear you to pieces.\" \"You're letting your dogs do that? As I said, you're a wuss.\" I pet his cheek and walk around him with Kerberos en Rigaros behind me, barking my ears off. \"Oh, you're going to pay for that.\" The next thing I know, I'm being tackled to the ground by the king of Hell. I roll over, groaning loudly, to see him pushing himself up on his elbows, a smirk on his face. \"First lesson,\" he says. \"If you're going to live with me for a while, you won't insult me. If you do, you'll have to face the consequences.\" I try to fold my arms in front of my chest, but since Hades is looming over me, my hands end up in his sides instead. A great plan begins to form in my mind. \"Well, I guess I'll have to do just that then.\" And I start tickling him mercilessly. It takes less than five seconds for him to basically collapse on top of me, enabling me roll us over and pin his hands over his head. \"That is, if it won't be the other way around.\" I can see he's not really trying to hold me back. He's way too strong for me to keep him down if he really didn't want me to, but I think that he's enjoying this, having human (or divine) company. I'm pretty sure that under that whole bad guy facade, he is actually a big, soft teddy bear. If everything goes the way he wants it to go, that is. Maybe I should try not to get him mad. It's nice as long as it lasts, but when Hades has had enough, I'm beneath him again in seconds, now with my own hands pinned above my head. He throws me a wink, sits up straight and runs a hand through his hair. \"Well, not that I'm not enjoying this impromptu wrestling match, but we really should get going if you want a tour before dinner.\" \"Are we nearly there yet?\" \"Lesson number two, no stupid questions. Look behind you.\" I nearly pull my neck muscles to see what he means, and my jaw drops once again. \"Is that-\" Hades nods, a proud look on his face. \"One of the entrances to the Styx.\" He stands up, pulls me up from the ground as well and wipes some grass and dirt from my dress. After a short whistle, Kerberos and Rigaros run towards the black cave in front of us, disappearing completely within two seconds. I start skipping towards the cave too, eager to investigate, but Hades pulls me back. \"Wait, you're not dead, so you'll stand out terribly if you go in there on your own. I know I probably won't be able to stop you from doing something you really want, but at the very least, stay by my side until we've reached my palace.\" \"You have a palace?\" I ask. \"Well, of course I do. I'm the god of the Underworld, remember?\" He brushes off the last blades of grass and nudges me a little, his eyes lingering on mine a little longer than necessary. \"Come on, let's go.\" \"Okay, so we'll have to cross the Styx here. Very Important Lesson number three, don't ever stick your hand in the water, or you'll die.\" Being the annoying child that I am, I reach out my hand towards the river, even though we're still too far away for me to touch it. He immediately slips his arm around my waist, pulling me back, and I snort. \"I thought that only counted for mortals?\" Hades looks at the water dubiously. \"Officially, yes, but let's not test that theory, alright?\" He stalks towards the river, past the line of waiting souls, trusting me to follow along. He stops in front of a very old looking boat, in which an equally old looking man is seated. He sounds almost fond as he speaks his next words. \"Charon, my friend, how are you today?\" The old man shrugs. \"Same as always, your Grace. Some spirits here haven't got enough money to pass and won't stop being a huge pain in the ass, but the others are quite nice. They're just scared for what comes next.\" Hades nods, an understanding look on his face. \"Oh, yes, of course, the trial. Oh, well. I'd like to pass.\" Charon only then seems to notice me and looks me up and down, his eyes calculating. His next words, however, are still for Hades. \"If you don't mind me asking, your Grace, why don't you just snap your divine fingers and teleport yourself to the palace?\" I glance at Hades, but he doesn't seem to be as indignant as I thought he would be. On the Olympus, you can't talk like that to Zeus. He would kill you deader than dead. And yes, that's possible. I've seen it happen. But Hades just smiles and shrugs as well. \"I felt like a walk.\" Charon smirks, nodding towards me. Hades coughs. \"Oh yes, this is... Persephone. She wanted to see the palace so I thought I would take her down for a tour.\" Persephone... He just called me bringer of death. Awesome. I nod eagerly. \"Yeah, isn't he a nice guy?\" I say, petting him on the shoulder, ignoring the surprised look on his face. \"I was walking through the forest and I saw this nymph and... Wait before I tell you my whole life story, do you need toll or anything?\" Charon laughs heartily and gets a coughing fit from the force of it. He waves away my concern and motions for me to walk to the boat. \"No ma'am, that won't be necessary. Special guests deserve special treatment.\" I blush lightly at the compliment. \"Does the madam want the carriage for her own, or is sharing alright too?\" \"Private\" - \"Sharing!\" we say at the same time. I immediately turn pleading eyes on my impromptu friend and I see the resistance melting away from his face. He turns to Charon. \"We seem to be sharing,\" he says, to which Charon only answers with a knowing smirk. Hades pushes me in the direction of the boat with a hand placed lightly in the small of my back and helps me climb over the side before climbing in himself, ignoring all the awed stares the pair of us is gathering. When I'm seated comfortably I look around me, taking in the completely different surroundings. I place my hands on Hades's shoulders and shake them excitedly. \"Oh my gods, this is awesome! Thank you for taking me here!\" Hades smiles fondly at my antics. \"You're quite welcome, philtate.\" The pet name seems to slip in almost casually, but when I look at him, I see a blush creeping up his neck. I turn to look forward in the boat and lightly bump shoulders to indicate it's fine, causing him to sag and let out a quiet breath of relieve. When the boat is entirely filled with souls, Charon pushes off and starts rowing. I look around again excitedly and look over the side of the boat to see what the water of the Styc looks like, which prompt Hades to put an arm around my waist again to make sure I don't accidentally topple over into the water. \"Did you know, Persephone?\" Hades says, probably trying to distract me from doing dangerous things. \"Did I know what?\" I turn to face him, immediately noticing how close we are sitting. \"If you want, I could teach you how to make soul flowers?\" I'm intrigued. \"Soul flowers?\" \"Yes. You see, the power of a god is derived from their soul, which, for example, contains enough energy for you to grow an entire year's harvest in only a minute. You would feel a bit drained afterwards, but you could do it. Now, normally you make actual flowers, but you can also give a sort of corporeal form to your soul and make a soul flower.\" I clap my hands excitedly and shuffle backwards a little to create more space. \"Show me,\" I demand. He arches an eyebrow. \"Only if you ask nicely,\" Hades responds with a smirk. I press my hands together against my chest and look up to where the sky would have been, had we been on earth. \"Please, please, please! \" I beg. He laughs delightedly and I smile at the sound. \"Alright, but I'm not going to make a flower. I have a reputation to uphold.\" \"Oh, yeah, because, Gods forbid, no-one needs to know the King of the Underworld can make flowers at will. You know, it might be a good thing to soften your image a bit. It might make people less reluctant to go to your realm.\" \"I don't have to, because they go here anyway, whether they want to or not. And when they're here, they see it's not that bad.\" I groan and drop my head in my hands. \"You're such a guy. People have feelings, you know. Might be a good thing to act accordingly.\" Hades doesn't respond, but when I look up to see what's gotten into him, I'm suddenly surrounded by a bush of plants and flowers. They are different from normal flowers, though. You can almost see through them and are a simmering white. When I reach out a hand to touch them, my finger goes right through them, but they don't disappear. Charon coughs discreetly. \"Sir? We're here.\" Hades looks up at him, cheeks reddening slightly, and clears his throat as he stands up. The moment breaks and, to my great disappointment, the flowers disappear. He steps on the ground next to the boat and extends his hand to help me out too. After saying goodbye to Charon, he places his hand on my lower back and lightly pushes me in the general direction of a great, looming palace. As soon as I see the depressing place, I nod determently. \"Yep, I'm going to cheer this place up. You can definitely use some flowers.\" \"And have you thought of asking the owner of said place what he thinks of this plan?\" \"Of course not. You don't have any say in this. You would only mess it up. You know what you need? A wife. She would keep the palace nice and tidy for you while you're doing... whatever you do to pass the time.\" After a second of thought, I add, \"and she would have to be an awesome queen of course. Someone that demands respect from everyone who sees her.\" Hades quirks an eyebrow, while making sure I don't fall over anything on the ground, since I'm not exactly looking where I'm going. \"Oh, really? And do you have someone in mind or are you just fantasizing?\" \"Well...\" Me. But no way I'm gonna tell you that. \"I know a nymph who wouldn't say no to ruling an entire kingdom?\" I say nonchalantly, prodding him in the side. He looks extremely offended by the mere idea of marrying a nymph. He 'hmphs' and looks straight ahead, ignoring my chuckles. \"Nawh, don't be mad, you big baby. Maybe you could show me around the palace.\" He stops abruptly, turns around and grabs my arms. \"First of all, I'm not a baby. Second, I'm not mad, I'm just annoyed.\" \"Pff, of course. 'Annoyed'.\" He clenches his jaw - which is rather distracting, really. This may be the first time I really understand what Aphrodite means with 'he did the jaw thing and I lost it'. \"Yes,\" he growls. \"Annoyed. And why are you looking at me like that?\" \"Like wh-what?\" I say. I immediately curse myself for not being able to form a sentence of more than two words. He takes a step back when he hears me stutter. \"You're not- You're not afraid of me, are you?\" I blink twice before answering. \"What? No, of course not.\" Just slightly turned on... \"Come on, I still want to see the palace.\" I take a step closer to him and link our arms together as a silent peace offering. I see his features relax again and hear him sigh softly. \"And you promised to tell me the story of how you really became the god of the Underworld, remember? If you really didn't offer to take this place yourself, then how did you end up here?\" He sighs. \"You probably know the story of how our dad ate me and my brothers and sisters. Well, your father wasn't eaten, because our mom Rhea saved him. Zeus eventually saved us from Kronos and got to choose which realm he wanted to rule.\" \"So he chose Olympus.\" \"Yes. Now, Poseidon got to choose next, because I'm actually a pretty nice person and, being the responsible older brother, let him choose first. He didn't want the Underworld either and chose the sea. That's how I got stuck with.... this graveyard.\" \"Well, I think it's awesome.\" He shoots me a hopeful smile. \"Really?\" \"Yeah, it just needs some colour, like I said earlier.\" He looked at his palace critically, slowly starting to nod. \"Hm, I guess you've got a point. But I'm not going to do it. I've got better things to do with my time.\" I roll my eyes and lose my footing as I stumble over a small rock that somehow found its way into my path. Hades quickly grabs my waist, making sure I don't fall flat on my face. \"Like what?\" I say, as I casually hang only half a meter above the ground. \"Playing with Kerberos and Rigaros?\" He smirks and pulls me up from my admittedly uncomfortable position. \"For one thing, yes. But also, I don't know, ruling the Underworld?\" \"Pff, no, why would you think that?\" I start to giggle and shake my head. \"Now, the palace?\" He bows mockingly. \"But of course, my lady.\" The palace is huge, but Hades shows me everything in just under an hour. Well, 'shows' probably isn't the right word. He's more like a whirlwind, telling me what a room is while already walking towards the next one. But it's probably for the best, because otherwise it would've taken us three days. At some point, a servant comes up to us, telling Hades he's needed in Tartaros. He sighs. \"Fine. Persephone, if you'll follow Daichi, he'll show you to your room.\" \"Wait, I'm not coming with you?\" I ask, surprised, and maybe a bit scared and lost too. I'm gonna be alone here, in this huge palace, the palace of the dead. And I'm not... dead yet, right? What if this is all a trap?! Wait, stop thinking like that, that's not true. Right? I point at him angrily. \"If this is all a trap... Remember our talk about consequences?\" Now he looks offended for a split second, but understanding soon crosses his face and he holds up his hands placatingly. \"Yes, I do, and no, this is not a trap.\" He places his hands on my shoulders and steps a little bit closer. \"Just go with Daichi. He will make sure you won't miss anything. I'll be home before dinner.\" He is gone before I can protest. Huh, home... Sounds nice. Lost in thought, I follow Daichi to a room with a view over a grim... garden, at least that's what I think it's supposed to be. It all looks like dead plants to me. Well, there is one tree. One lonely tree with red fruits hanging from the branches. This could definitely use some more colour, so I decide that once I know how to make the soul flowers Hades showed me, I'm gonna use them to make the gardens around here a bit more colourful. But for now, what am I going to do until Hades returns? Sighing, I take a look around the room, opening cabinets and doors, eventually settling on looking through the biggest closet. I purse my lips, thinking of things that it could contain, but after a few seconds I have enough of guessing and open the doors. Hm. Maybe it would be safer to wear some clothes fitting the environment if I'm gonna roam the castle. I flip through the dresses hanging in the closet and settle on a floor-length red and black robe. Once I'm dressed and have looked at myself in the mirror abundantly to ensure everything is in the right place and I look awesome, I start going through the contents of the closet again. After several drawers of sandals and belts, I finally stumble across something infinitely more interesting. There is a very old looking key underneath a big heap of jewelry that someone clearly hoped to hide from curious eyes. Well, not from me. I'm way too good. Okay, kidding. But really, I spotted it immediately. Now only one question remains in my brain, all the other thoughts disappeared. What lock does it open? I mean, if there's a key, then there has to be a lock. You know, my mom always told me I'm too curious for my own good. Well, she can suck it up, I'm gonna find the lock this thing fits in anyway. I quietly walk to the door leading to the hallway and stick my head out to see if there's a guard outside. When I see no-one, I tiptoe into some random corridor, but the key doesn't fit on any of the doors there. I continue through the rest of the palace in much the same way, until I hear a gasp. When I quickly turn around, however, there's no-one to be seen, although I do hear a vague \"Kore...\" What? Did I just imagine that? Let's hope so. Not one to give up after one set-back, I continue my quest through the palace. Sadly, I still haven't found a single lock that even looks like it could fit the key after two hours of searching, which is why it isn't surprising I begin to slack off and turn a corner without looking if someone is approaching first. I curse when I crash into someone's chest with a little more force than is comfortable. \"Lady Persephone?\" I hear the human wall ask. I straighten my back and try to look as regal and dignified as I can. \"Yes?\" \"Thank Hades I found you, my lady. We've been looking for you all over. My master requested that you were to be brought to the dining room. You see, you weren't in your room so everybody sort of panicked..\" \"Oh, really now? Well, how about we indulge this master of yours in his wishes just this once? Lead the way.\" After passing the same corridor for what feels like thrice in five minutes, the guard stops in front of a big door that I vaguely remember passing once or twice in my quest for the lost lock. He opens the door and makes a small bow, gesturing for me to go inside. I am extremely tempted to walk into the room and announce myself by calling out, \"the me has arrived!\", but I decide against it and enter the dining room like a normal person. \"There you are!\" Hades calls out, getting out of his chair. \"I wondered where you might've run off to. To be honest, I was a bit worried.\" I skip to the table he's sitting at and sit down next to him, petting Kerberos and Rigaros in the process. \"You were worried? I'm a big girl, you know? I don't think I'm stupid enough to get myself killed in a house. I mean, you've known me for a few hours now, so I hope you can tell I'm not that stupid.\" \"You might've noticed this is not your average house, nor is it your natural habitat.\" He runs a hand through his raven black hair and smirks. \"I don't think you'd survive that long.\" He leans forward an places his hand on mine. \"I have no idea what you're talking about,\" I say, grinning back at him. \"Oh, I found a key while nosing through your closet and went to look for the lock it fit on.\" Hades rubbed a hand over his face and looks at me incredulously. \"How can you tell me this so casually and in the same sentence claim you don't know why I think you wouldn't survive the Underworld on your own?\" \"Oh come on.\" I let out an indignant huff. \"You're just worried.\" \"Yeah, so?\" The way he so casually admits his worries about me makes me blush. And somehow I don't mind that he worries about me, other than when my mom says she only worries because she doesn't want to see me hurt. \"Nothing. What do you think about the dress, anyway?\" \"I can't see it properly like this. Why don't you twirl for a bit?\" From the look on his face I'm fairly certain he knows exactly what it looks like, but just wants to see it again. Or maybe he wants a better view? Who knows. I stand up and turn around slowly, making sure to move my hips enticingly. When I stop twirling, he is still looking at me, elbows on the table and his fingertips pressed together, his eyes slightly narrowed. I give him a look and he coughs loudly before turning towards his plate. \"So, I was thinking...\" Hades starts. \"Never the best thing to do, but go on.\" \"Would you listen to me for one second without commentary?!\" When I move my fingers across my lips to zip them shut, he nods. \"Thank you. As I said, I was thinking, maybe... maybe you would like to go stargazing tonight? Daichi told me it's completely clear.\" Eyes wide, I look at him. \"You can see the stars from here?\" I ask, bewildered, but very enthusiastic. He smiles and shakes his head slightly. \"No, we would have to make a little field trip to earth, but that's done with a snap of my fingers, so shouldn't really pose a problem. What do you say?\" I'm trying really, really hard to form a normal sentence, but I only manage a kind of croak. Great. Super charming. Hades is completely quiet for two seconds before bursting out laughing. \"What was that?\" On the inside, I'm dying. My stomach clenches and I look away from him, directing my gaze to the food on my plate. Trying not to be too obvious about my feelings, I huff and fold my arms, petulantly refusing to speak after he completely unnecessarily laughed at me. Hades waits patiently for a whole minute, but when he has accepted I won't be speaking anytime soon, he continues the conversation on his own. \"So, going by the earlier parts of our conversation, I assume you are so enthusiastic you are unable to form words? In that case, stargazing it is.\" \"You know, laughing at someone can hurt someone's feelings,\" I say instead of answering, completely ignoring his last words. \"Maybe that's why they put you down here.\" He arches an eyebrow. \"Really? You're being naive.\" \"Insulting them won't exactly help your case,\" I add, starting to feel kind of angry. Forget kind of, I'm getting downright pissed. He gently places a hand on my arm. \"Philtate, listen to me. It was not an insult. It slipped out before I could control myself. To be fair, usually, there are only ghosts here. And you might think that to be awesome, they're definitely not funny.\" I throw him a scowl. \"I wasn't trying to be funny.\" He sighs. \"Fine. How can I make it up to you, huh?\" I give him a calculating look. Mkay, he's better than Apollo, I have to give him that. Way better, too. Apollo would have given up on me ten minutes ago. Hades is so sweet. And I think that says something, with him being the god of the Underworld. And he is good with animals, which is, well, one of the things that make him a good person. I don't think I've ever met a god who was genuinely interested in me. The rest is just narcissistic. I purse my lips. \"The stargazing does sound nice.\" Hades's eyes brighten. \"Great, that's decided then.\" A grin appears on my face, so wide it actually hurts, but I can't suppress it. Hoping Hades doesn't notice my stupid expression, I turn to my plate and pick up some ambrosia. I'm already lifting it to my mouth when it's suddenly hit out of my hand, an arm almost hitting me in the face. I jerk backwards in shock and look to Hades sharply, who still has his arm outstretched in my direction. \"What the hell?! What did you do that for?\" I ask, still a little shaken from the sudden outburst, my heart pounding in my chest. \"You can't eat that!\" he says, way too loud, if you ask me. \"And why not?\" \"Because then you wouldn't be able to leave the Underworld permanently anymore. You would be bound to this place.\" \"And what? You don't want me here? Is that it?\" Hades looks positively scandalised. \"What? No, that's not it. I just think you should have the choice to stay or leave, not be forced because of some stupid rule.\" All my anger melts away at this admission. Not knowing how to reply to this properly, I fall back on teasing. \"Aahw, you do care. But I am hungry, so what will I be eating?\" Hades smirks. \"I'm sure there are plenty of families upstairs who would be willing to provide two gods with some food, don't you think?\" Hades laughs heartily. \"Did you see their faces? I almost thought they were going to throw some food at us and then run into the forest, just to get away from us. Peasants.\" I throw him a glare in lieu of wacking him over the head and his relaxed face quickly morphs into a frown. \"You're the god of the freaking Underworld, of course they're scared. You don't exactly look like Eros or something.\" He smiles at that. \"What? You don't think I'm handsome?\" I point a finger at his face. \"You're twisting my words. I never said anything of the sorts,\" I say, mockingly stern. \"So you do think I'm handsome?\" \"Twisting my words again. But if you so desperately need confirmation that you're handsome, sure.\" He wiggles his eyebrows, leaning forward. \"You sure?\" \"If you keep fishing for compliments, I'm taking it back.\" I look around at the forest we're walking through. In the time it took us to eat dinner, it's turned dark outside, so while I feel like I am familiar with my surroundings, we could just as well be walking in Africa. Okay, maybe not Africa. It's too cool for that. But you get my point. I have absolutely no idea where we are. Wait, that tree looks familiar, doesn't it? No, never mind. I squint my eyes at Hades playfully. \"Where are you taking me, huh? Are you abducting me?\" \"That's rich, coming from the girl who let me take her to the Underworld after only knowing me for ten minutes. I'm taking you stargazing, remember?\" \"Oh, come on. I'm never gonna hear the end of that one, huh? I was emotionally unstable. okay? Women get that sometimes. Even goddesses.\" I worm my hand in the small space between his side and his arm, trying to get him to walk arm in arm with me. \"Well alright then, take me stargazing.\" \"Emotionally unstable?\" he repeats. My heart sinks in my chest. O, gods. What have I said now? \"Was it that time of the month again?\" \"Gasp! How dare you ask me that so shamelessly? One does not simply ask a girl if she's on her period! Really, it is no wonder you're still alone in your fancy palace.\" As soon as the words leave my mouth, I regret having said them. I throw him a worrying glance, but he isn't looking at me. \"Remember lesson number 1,\" he says, his voice emotionless. \"As long as you're with me, you won't insult me.\" I squeeze him arm where it is wrapped around mine as a silent peace offering. \"I'm sorry. Really, I am. Sometimes I have no brain to mouth filter. It wasn't true, what I said.\" He quirks an eyebrow. \"How is it not?\" I shrug lightly. \"You have me.\" Crap, that sounded way too creepy and sappy. What if he just sees me as a girl friend? Like, a girl who is also a friend? I clear my throat. \"I mean- I have absolutely no idea what I said. Just forget about it.\" All I hear is a snap of his fingers before I'm suddenly even colder than I was two seconds ago. I don't have a lot of time to process, though, because a moment later, he has cupped my face with his hands and gently presses his lips to mine. I swear, it feels like fireworks exploding in my heart. He breaks the kiss a few moments, looking down at me with a small smile tugging at the corners of his mouth, before leaning down again and capturing my lips in another breathtaking kiss that turns me into a flustered mess. I don't know how to explain it. I've only known him since that morning, but it just feels right. It feels like everything Aphrodite told me about when I was little. Well, littler. He must be thousands of years older than me. Okay, don't think about that now. Focus, Persephone. Focus. I open my eyes. I startle slightly, but am instantly intrigued by the purplish hue of his eyes. I narrow my eyes at him. Does he know that is my favourite colour and change it on purpose? \"Yes,\" he says, which startles me even more. \"Did you read my mind? Talk about no privacy.\" He scoffs. \"No, you just said it out loud.\" \"Really? I did?\" \"Well, of course you did. Do you think I would keep something like 'I can read minds' from you if I could?\" I smirk. \"I don't know, would you? After all, I am the girl that followed you to the Underworld after only knowing you for ten minutes.\" \"Thank the gods for that, otherwise this would have been very awkward.\" I start giggling uncontrollably and soon we're both laughing until our stomachs hurt, to the point we both have to sit down to make sure we don't topple over. When I've managed to get a hold of myself again, I look at surroundings, scooting a bit closer to the guy who just gave me my first kiss. He wraps an arm around my waist and pulls me as close as possible without me sitting in his lap. He presses a kiss to the crown of my head, hesitates for a moment and captures my mouth with his again. I'm the one who pulls away, eventually, mostly to get some air. Damn, he knows how to get a girl breathless. \"I know I already said I didn't know where I was, but that hasn't changed one bit. So tell me, where did you snap us off to?\" \"We,\" he pauses for a dramatic effect, \"are on the most fabulous mountain-\" \" Kore?\" My head snaps around so quickly I almost get a whiplash. \" Hermes? \" I feel Hades tighten his arms around me. \"What are you of all people doing here?\" I choose these words for the sole reason of irritating him. Everyone knows Hermes absolutely hates being called human. As predicted, he scoffs, clearly schooling his features to hide his annoyance - he's failing miserably. He takes hold of one of my so quickly I can't do anything about it and pulls me on my feet. \"Your mother is worried sick about you. She hasn't paid attention to her tasks for weeks.\" \"Wait a minute. Weeks? I was gone for a day.\" Hermes shakes his head. \"Time is different in the Underworld. You've been gone for six weeks now. Everyone had lost hope of finding you.\" I throw a meaningful glance in Hades's direction, indicating we'll have words about this, and he looks at the ground in shame. \"We're going,\" Hermes says, slipping his arm around my waist and almost taking off, but something holds him to the ground. He curses and looks behind him, where Hades has stood up, his eyes now a ice blue and his hands flaming blue fire. \" You are going. We aren't going anywhere.\" His voice is low, thunderous. The air around us seems to vibrate and the ground begins to crack. But when he looks at me, hesitation is present in his eyes. \"That's what you want, right?\" Hermes lets go of me and turns to look at Hades, a smile displayed on his face. Slowly, he too starts looking more devine. His eyes turn gold, his skin begins to shine. He is fully confident that I will go back to Olympus. \"Yes, tell him, Kore.\" In reality, no-one gives me the time to answer either one of them. Hades' eyes narrow and the cracks in the ground widen. I swallow harshly, looking into one of the closest ones, and take a horrified step back when I see skeletons climbing up the soil. \"As I said,\" Hades thunders, \"she is not going anywhere.\" \"No!\" I scream. \"Hades, stop it!\" He doesn't look at me. He ignores me completely, and I can't have him killing my half brother, how annoying he might be. \"Hades, look at me!\" I scream, jumping in between them, holding up my hands. Without really noticing, I send some energy into the ground to grow little bushes over the huge cracks. \"Look at me!\" Hades blinks, the blue in his eyes softening a bit, slowly shifting more to a warm purple, but we're not there yet. \"Hades, philtate, you have to listen to me. I'm not going anywhere you're not. But if you kill my brother, I have no choice but to go to Olympus and explain to my father what happened. You have to calm down. You hear me? Calm down. \" Hermes scoffs loudly. \"See? He's not a good fit for a goddess. He has anger management issues.\" Hades's eyes instantly turn back to icy blue. I turn around sharply. \" What did you just say?\" Honestly, I've never seen my brother this... terrified of me. \" He has anger management issues? What about our father, huh? What about you?\" I throw my arm back to point at Hades. \" He doesn't complain about his job or the fact that he still hasn't got a wife to grow old with. Every damn god or goddess on Olympus is basically the archetype of anger management issues, so don't you dare insult him like that.\" I'm ready to jump him and claw his eyes out, but two strong arms slip themselves around my waist and pull me back. One snap of his fingers, and Hades and I are back in his palace, this time in a large, almost all black room. Since I'm entirely too comfortable in Hades's embrace, I look around the room without stepping away from him. \"Are these your quarters?\" I ask. I feel him nod. \"Yes, and you'll have to excuse me. I have a war to prepare, so make yourself comfortable. \"You sound rather cheerful with a war upcoming,\" I say dryly. He shrugs. \"Remember, my army consists of dead soldiers. They're dead, so they can't die in battle, and there have been a lot of wars, so there are a lot of good dead soldiers. A war I can win, and knowing that, it's easy not to be afraid.\" \"That's not all.\" A broad grin appears on his face. \"You chose me, philtate,\" he whispers, stepping close. \"You chose me, the god of the Underworld, over Apollo, the god of the Sun and I know what more. You chose me over your own family. So the least I can do is win this war. And, between you and me, it's nice to win from my sickening brothers. We will let them see who's the strongest.\" He's gone before I completely realize he said 'we'. The fruits are still a beautiful, deep red. When I reach out to pull one off the branches, the leaves turn from black to green. It looks like only my presence makes the tree come to life, as if it's saying that I'm doing the right thing. And maybe it is. Maybe it isn't. I take a deep breath and tear the fruit of the branch, taking a big bite. The juice drips down my chin, but I don't care and take another bite. I go on and on and on, until the fruit is gone and I know it's enough. I jerk up from where I was dozing of on Hades's bed, almost falling down on the ground in the process, when the door is thrown wide open and someone comes barging in. \"What's going on? Are we being attacked?\" I ask Hades when I recognize him in the dim light from the red, orange and yellow candles scattered across the walls. \"What's going on outside?\" Hades is fuming, a good 170 pound mass of muscles and anger. \"The war is canceled.\" I give him a look. \"So you interrupted my beauty sleep for a bit of drama?\" The blue flames that enveloped him when he entered suddenly disappear. \"You don't need beauty sleep, philtate.\" Why is he so freaking adorable?! Directly after saying something so sappy he will probably forever deny having said it, the flames appear again as he starts to explain what happened earlier. \"I was just of preparing the troops, when this little shit came barging in.\" He turns away from me and gestures towards a figure standing in the shadows. I squint my eyes, but don't recognize him due to the lack of light, at least not until he takes a step forward. Hades continues like he doesn't notice my confusion. Why would my father send Apollo to talk to Hades? Wouldn't Zeus know that this is like the most irrational decision ever and that there is a huge chance that this will turn out in a fight? \"And he says that there will be a trial, because they don't want to 'crush me and my forces'. Like they could,\" Hades mutters so only I can hear him. \"I mean, I can win a war, but a trial? I'm sorry, philtate, but I fear everything is lost now.\" I throw him an unimpressed look. \"So much for the god of the Underworld. Drama queen, we'll be fine.\" I know he doesn't believe me the moment he focuses his gaze on me. He looks genuinely scared that we will be torn apart, that he'll lose what he has found. What he doesn't know, however, is that I have a secret trump card that will make it impossible for us to lose. I applaud myself mentally. Apollo clears his throat, takes a step forward. \"Kore, we have to go. Your mother is waiting for you.\" I feel a flash of irritation when he calls me Kore. \"Don't tell me what to do,\" I snap. \"And I don't care what my mother wants me to do.\" Hades places a hand on my shoulder to calm me down, and probably to make sure I don't attack him right then and there. \"Come on, philtate, we have a trial to win,\" he says calmly, before kissing me square on the mouth in front of the god I'm supposed to marry. \"Hey! Don't you dare kiss my bride!\" Apollo shouts. However, he is fully ignored by the both of us. When Hades pulls away, he narrows his eyes slightly. \"You-\" \"Anyway, we gotta go, right?\" I say, way too cheerful for the moment, but who cares? Hades tries - rather successfully for everyone else, but not for me - to hide his smirk and I know he has caught on. We walk through the dark hallways, the candles on the wall flaming bright blue as we pass, only to continue to their usual warm red a moment later. The walk through the palace is long. Too long. The only warning Hades gives me is a small squeeze of my hand, before snapping his fingers and teleporting us to the right hall, the hall where every trial is held, leaving a probably fuming Apollo behind. \"Hades,\" comes the thunderous voice of my dad. I resist the urge to roll my eyes and turn around, just like Hades beside me, to see my mom and dad sitting on the throne of the king and queen of the Underworld. He's not sitting beside Hera for once, maybe because my mom is more concerned by this than she is. Hades quirks an eyebrow. I only notice now how much younger he looks than most of the other gods. Did he do that just for me or is it because the time is different in the Underworld? \"Let's skip the formalities, shall we, brother?\" he asks, sounding very amused. \"And get your godly ass off of my throne.\" A familiar voice speaks up from a table to the side of the room. \"Try to keep things civil, Hades,\" Athena chides. The moment she speaks up, I turn around and break into a sprint. Athena is the only one of my family I actually like. She has always been like a big sister for me, and although it was only yesterday I saw her - at least for me - I still miss her. So, I think a hug is in place. Athena, however, stops me before I can do so, quickly explaining herself when she sees the hurt look on my face. \"I can't give you a hug, sweetie, I am to be the judge of this trial. I have to stay impartial.\" I study her face and see she's serious this time. Not that she's never serious or anything, but most of the time I can find a way to worm my way through some loophole or another to get her on my side. Since that doesn't seem to be the case now, I give her a nod and a smile that probably looks more like a grimace. I'm not sure if I could forgive her if she took me away from Hades. I walk back calmly to the chair Hades has sat down in. There is no chair for me, but since Hades is basically sitting on a small throne, judging by the width of the seat, I figure there is more than enough room for me to squeeze in. When I nudge his foot to make him move to the side, however, he stands up and offers the chair to me. I quirk an eyebrow, but he just shrugs and motions for me to sit down. \"Follow my lead if you want to make an unforgettable impression,\" he murmurs. \"Says the man who almost lost it at the thought of a trial,\" I whisper back, which earns me a poke in my side, but I sit on the throne anyway. \"Now sit up straight and act like you know what you're doing.\" Hades places a hand somewhere between my shoulder and the middle of my back and straightens his back. Suddenly, I see what he's doing. We probably make the perfect image of power and tranquillity. Feeling a grin break out, I quickly school my features into a more appropriate expression. \"Hades,\" Athena says eventually, after she's watched me squirm in the seat for a while. \"Where is your lawyer?\" She nods towards my mom, who sits in a chair like mine, Nike at her side. Shoot. Nike was a good choice, with her being the goddess of victory. \"Well, he died 6000 years ago,\" Hades deadpans, \"and I've made it this far, so let's continue.\" Athena quirks an eyebrow when I try not to lose my composure, and I almost fail, again, but with a lot of biting on my lower lip and a rather painful pinch in my neck from Hades, I manage to keep looking like a queen. Zeus stands up from his throne and folds his hands together. \"So, I'll tell you all how this is gonna go. Nike speaks for Demeter, Hades speaks for Kore. After that, Athena decides where Kore has to stay. All clear?\" So they're now going to fight about me without asking me what I want? Well that's just great. See, this kind of shit is why I left home in the first place. Nobody answers, but Zeus sits down again like everybody has answered him and gestures for us to begin. Nike, as expected, stands up first and begins talking about how sad I've made my mother by staying away and how bad living on the Earth is right now, because my mother has forgotten about all about her tasks. I don't see how that's my fault, but hey, did somebody ask me? No. Of course not. I almost fall asleep, so long does Nike's rant continue. I only stay awake because Hades pinches my neck at regular intervals. I don't know if he can feel me doze off in my chair or if it's meant to be supportive, but it certainly keeps me awake, so that's a good thing, I guess. And then, I've had enough of all this waiting. I stand up as well, slowly, to add some drama, and take the same pose as my father, hands folded and in front of my stomach. \"If I may say something,\" I start. I am rudely interrupted by Apollo, \"No.\" \"Well, excuse you, but I didn't ask you, so sit down on your divine ass again, blakas. \" \"Kore!\" Zeus and Demeter shout from the other end of the room. \"Yeah, FYI, I changed my name, okay? It's Persephone now. If you could actually call me that instead of basically calling me girl, that would be great.\" Zeus turns his gaze to Hades. \"What have you done to my baby girl?\" Hades gives his brother a satisfied smirk. \"Nothing. She chose to go after me, to follow me here. She wanted to stay here. And she let me kiss her.\" Not the best thing to say, in this room full of gods who kind of hate him. I facepalm as I let the cacophony of sounds roll over me that erupt after Hades's statement. \"Oh gods, Kore, he hasn't,\" my mother hesitates slightly, \"dishonored you, has he?\" I stare at her with a blank expression for a good five seconds. \"What?\" \"She's asking about our non-existent sex life,\" Hades whispers, so that only I can hear. I subtly kick him in the shin for almost making me laugh again. This is a serious trial, damnit! \"That is none of you nosy parkers' damn business,\" I hiss at my mom, starting to get really irritated by her already. I swear, she almost faints. \"Oh good gods, Zeus, he has!\" I groan. This is going to be a long trial. \"He hasn't, okay, mom? And stop asking about my sex life.\" Oh, how fun it is to use this kind of language in her presence. This can barely be considered foul language compared to some of the words I've heard mortals utter, but she already faints at the use of the word butt. \"But how hasn't he done it?\" my dad asks. \"You were here for months.\" I groan again. A long trial. \"Just because the only thought on your mind is sex with women other than your wife, doesn't mean I am the same. Besides, time is different in this part of the world. I call it space-time relativity. One day, the mortals will understand my genius and research it extensively.\" He looks at me like I've gone crazy. \"Is that a fancy way of saying you have done it? Are you speaking in tongues, young lady?\" \"No,\" I say, doing my best to shine all the exasperation through that I can muster. \"It means that the five minutes you took here to discuss my sex life in public took three hours and a half upstairs.\" He still doesn't get it. How stupid can you be? It's a miracle he actually gave birth to the goddess of wisdom. I throw my hands in the air. \"Fine, believe whatever you want. You know what? Yes, we did it. Happy?\" Hades chokes on air and glares at me, but there's no menace behind it. \"I'm gonna kill you, brother,\" my dad growls. Now it's Hades's turn to throw his hands up in exasperation. \" Now you choose to listen to her? How about the time she told Demeter she didn't want to marry a douchebag without having any say in it? And how about keeping her on a leash since the moment she was born? Has she ever had any fun?\" When I look at Athena, who is still standing on the other side of the room, I see she's almost ready to burst out into anger at the mess this trial has become. \"I want order!\" she screams, her voice high-pitched and squeaky. Zeus turns his gaze at her. \"You seriously think this was going to be a real trial? We're gods, we don't do trials.\" If I had to pick a moment where Athena would surely attack her own father, this would be it. I've never seen her this angry. Her eyes are metallic grey, the colour of her shield and spear. She takes a deep breath and walks away from our dad and the other gods sitting together. \"Fine. But then I'll choose her side.\" \"What?\" Demeter screams. I puff up my chest. Ha! That will teach them. \"Zeus, do something!\" Demeter says. \"Yes, Demeter,\" Zeus murmurs quietly, before speaking up. \"Persephone, you are to return upstairs immediately and remain there. You can't see Hades again for at least another year.\" I smirk devilishly. \"You know, I could do that. But then again, I could also just stay here. I don't really feel like dying yet, you know?\" Zeus sighs. \"Really, Kore-\" Ugh, he's using my old name again \"-stop this madness. You won't die, okay? I get it. You've just fallen in love for the first time, you'll die if you don't see him, but we can't have you making a scene right now.\" \"Oh, you simpletons,\" Hades sighs, shaking his head in mock sadness, \"how I wish it would be that simple.\" \"What do you mean?\" Apollo growls. I drop down on the small throne and turn sideways to throw my legs over one arm of the chair and lean with my back on the other. \"Well, you see, I got very hungry over the time I was here. I'm still a developing goddess, which takes a lot of energy. So, I went into the garden and found a pomegranate,\" I say over-excitedly. \"Turns out, they are delicious.\" A collective gasp can be heard all around the hall. \"Hades, you knew about this?\" Zeus asks. \"Nope,\" he says, popping the 'p'. \"At least, not until I kissed her afterwards.\" \"Look, it's no use fighting about it now,\" I say before my dad can murder his brother. \"I don't want to spend my whole life up on Olympus. I've never felt home. I've never felt like I belong there. I want to live here.\" A heart-wrenching scream of anguish sounds through the hall. My mom claps her hand for her mouth, tears running down her cheeks, all colour drained from her face. I swallow harshly. It's the truth, what I've just said, but I didn't count on this reaction. My mother and I have never really seen eye to eye on things. I just thought that she thought the same of this matter as I did, but that apparently isn't the case. The moment Hades places his hands on my waist and nudges me to continue, however, I know that what I said was the right thing. I straighten my back and look at Zeus and Athena to hear their final decision. Zeus is rubbing his temples as though all these complications ask too much of his small brain. Athena is the one to speak up, eventually. \"I think we can't deny her to stay here. She may have stayed here only a day, but she has found her place here. She looks happy for the first time in... forever.\" Demeter's face brightens somewhat. \"But she can't stay here forever! She has to take care of the plants upstairs, or else she would be ignoring her assigned task.\" For some reason, my eyes become wet with tears. \"So, what? I'll be spending half a year with you guys upstairs and a week here, because time runs different here?\" \"I think that's a great idea!\" Apollo calls out. I throw him a deathglare. What. An. Ass. \"I was only kidding, blakas!\" Athena holds up a finger. \"No wait, let's continue this trail of thought. I think this is probably the best solution, with the only change that the time should run at the same speed up- and downstairs.\" I blink. \"You can do that?\" Athena cocks her head. \"I, personally, can't. The only one that can won't help because he thinks we don't deserve his help. Trust me, we've tried. But I do know that a marriage will get the time streams to run at the same speed.\" Zeus clasps his hands together excitedly, happy that he can follow along again. After a few seconds, however, a look of true horror makes its way onto his face. \"Wait, you want to marry my only daughter off to some scumbag who doesn't even know how to think of proper punishments?!\" Athena throws him a glare. \"She's not your only daughter, remember?\" \"Well, of course I remember.\" \"Really?\" Athena looks unimpressed. \"Because it sure didn't sound like that. Have you forgotten the prophecy that was made about me? 'She will have power and glory equal to her father's'. That's why you ate my mom, remember? And then you were ready to marry me to Hephaestus like it was nothing.\" \"Someone here has daddy-issues,\" Hades whispers in my ear, which sends my into yet another fit of giggles. \"Quiet!\" Athena snaps. \"If you want me to you help you out here, I suggest you don't insult me any further.\" Hades gulps and stays quiet. Now it's Athena's turn to rub her temples. \"Alright. This is what's going to happen. Persephone will join Hades in marriage-\" \"Hold on, no-one asked me, and I'm still her father!\" Zeus calls out. \"Shut up,\" Athena hisses. \"Okay. After that, Persephone will come with us upstairs, because the plants are all dead and we need you, honey. While she's there with us, no-one will harass her. Understand?\" She looks at Apollo, who shrugs and turns his back at us, mumbling something which sounds suspiciously like 'I didn't like her that much anyway'. Athena continues. \"Persephone, you will stay on earth for six months, after which you can return to your husband, where you can stay for the rest of the year. Does everyone agree?\" After some mumbling, most of the gods nod. Hades leans his head down and whispers in my ear, \"She didn't say anything against me visiting you...\" \"Shut up, you sap,\" I whisper back, turning around. \"We have a wedding to plan.\"",

      "Echo is lingering at the edge of the clearing, every now and then stretching out her arms in Narcissus's reflection, constantly repeating the words, \"... never love you.\"",
      "She keeps trying to swallow the first word, but it still sounds like she is rejecting him over and over again.",
      "My heart clenches and I avert my eyes, aiming for the other clearing the nymph told me about.",
      "I am deeply in need of some positive energy, consisting mainly of flowers, but my mood does not brighten when I see the first rays of sunshine fall on the ground.",
      "I intended to stride resolutely onto the clearing, drop down between the flowers and lie there until I feel a bit better, but I stop dead in my tracks when I hear a high barking.",
      "By the sound of it, there must be at least five dogs on the clearing.",
      "Not one to back down from a challenge, I quietly approach the clearing and hide behind a broad tree.",
      "I press myself against the trunk and stick my head around to look into the clearing.",
      "The sight makes me almost squeak in delight, but I manage to control myself.",
      "On the clearing, two puppies are enthusiastically trying to push over their boss to get to the treat he's holding in his hands.",
      "However, that's not the first thing I notice.",
      "It might be a bit obvious to mortals, but it kind of jumps out when a dog has more than one head, let alone three.",
      "And there are two of them!",
      "They are absolutely adorable and I can't help but squeal softly at the almost domestic scene in front of me.",
      "I immediately slap my hand in front of my mouth, but it's too late.",
      "Just before I manage to hide behind the broad tree, I see the man's head whipping around in my direction.",
      "\"Shit, shit, shit,\" I mutter as I contemplate my options.",
      "In the roughly three seconds I think I have, three plans come up in my head.",
      "A, grow a bunch of plants to conceal me.",
      "B, jump real high and hide in between the branches of the tree.",
      "C, run as fast as I can.",
      "Sadly, neither of those plans seem to be good options.",
      "I jump when I hear a male voice.",
      "\"Hello?",
      "Who's there?\"",
      "A slight pause.",
      "\"I promise I won't hurt you.\"",
      "Hm-mmm.",
      "Yeah, right.",
      "Staying right where I am, I listen closely for any sound indicating he is approaching my hide-out.",
      "I don't hear anything, though, and the temptation to step into the sunlight and walk onto the clearing is getting bigger with the second.",
      "\"Hello?\" he calls again.",
      "Slow footsteps approach, the sound of two feet crushing grass and small, white flowers getting louder and louder.",
      "Maybe I should have listened to my mother.",
      "No, I say to myself.",
      "I have to take matters into my own hands now, if I want the life I've always dreamt of.",
      "Freedom, the choice to do every damn thing I want.",
      "A big, warm hand is placed on my shoulder, and I can't contain a squeak.",
      "\"Wow, easy.\"",
      "The man pulls his hand away.",
      "\"What are you doing here, on your own?",
      "You're not a nymph, are you?\" I squint my eyes.",
      "\"How can you tell?\"",
      "He actually looks uncomfortable, standing this close to me underneath this tree.",
      "He throws me a small, shy smile and rubs the back of his neck with one hand.",
      "When his two puppies try to jump on me, he pulls them back, calling an abrupt order which gets them quiet for a few seconds.",
      "\"Sorry.\"",
      "He crouches down, scratching their chins and looking up at me.",
      "\"They haven't had that much training yet.\"",
      "I try to bite back a smile.",
      "\"It's okay, really.",
      "At home, we don't have that many animals at all.\"",
      "\"Yeah?\"",
      "He stands up straight.",
      "Geez, he's tall.",
      "And he has the most beautiful eyes.",
      "\"Where do you live?\" I shake my head, not able to hold my smile after all.",
      "\"No, no, no, first, I want an answer on my question.\"",
      "\"What question?\" I give him an unimpressed look and try to lean casually against the tree, which I fear fails miserably.",
      "\"How you can tell I'm not a nymph?\" I ask, as if it is the most obvious thing in the world.",
      "He smirks.",
      "\"Well, firstly, nymphs don't squeak when they encounter something they are unfamiliar with.\"",
      "I huff indignantly, but he continues as if he didn't hear me.",
      "\"Secondly, I have come here often enough to know by heart which nymphs lives in this part of the forest, and I haven't seen you here before.",
      "Therefore, you can't be a nymph.\"",
      "After some consideration, he adds, \"and you can't be a mortal either, because then you would've fainted at the sight of two three-headed dogs.\"",
      "I snort and lean down to pet the six very enthusiastic puppy-heads in front of me.",
      "\"How do you know I didn't?",
      "Maybe I've mastered the art of fainting without falling down.",
      "Maybe I had just woken up and only squeaked because you were still there?\"",
      "As I get up again, the man lightly pulls the puppies to the clearing again, where he throws a small skull into the forest, sending the dogs running headlong into the trees.",
      "He turns to me again.",
      "\"Yes, apart from the fact that that's obviously the most logical explanation here, the fact that you didn't drop to your knees praying when I mentioned mortals, tells me all I need to know.",
      "Now, I don't think I caught your name?\" Damn, I was that close to convincing him I'm not who I seem to be.",
      "\"That might be because I haven't told you yet, don't you think?\"",
      "Saving him the trouble of actually asking for my name, I continue.",
      "\"My name is Kore.\"",
      "His face brightens in recognition.",
      "\"Ah, the daughter of Demeter.",
      "My lady, it is an honour to meet you.\"",
      "I squint my eyes.",
      "\"Uhmm, thanks, I guess?",
      "But who are you?\" I mean, flattering he knows who I am, but since I don't know him, it also looks a bit stalkerish... right?",
      "But hey, he has good manners.",
      "That's a plus point.",
      "And he's kinda cute.",
      "He straightens up to his full height and when he speaks again, his voice sounds just a tad more regal, proud.",
      "\"I am Hades, King of the Underworld, Ruler of Tartaros.\"",
      "My jaw drops.",
      "\"Oh my gods, you're the Hades?",
      "That's so awesome! \"",
      "He gives me a somewhat confused look.",
      "\"It is?\" Hades frowns, but before he can give me a look that is probably meant to be frightening, his dogs jump at his chest with the skull in one of the six mouths, causing Hades to fall flat on his back.",
      "This, of course, makes his next words even less powerful.",
      "\"I had actually expected a more frightened reaction...\" I reach forward to grab one of the dogs and lift it off his chest.",
      "\"But look, you're like a celebrity on Olympus.",
      "Everyone tells those stories about you, how you sacrificed yourself by choosing to be the god of the Underworld, being all noble and all.\"",
      "He arches an eyebrow from where he is still sitting on the ground and stands up while saying his next words.",
      "\"Yeah, right.",
      "I was the noble one.",
      "You know, I like the sound of that.",
      "Better than the original story.",
      "Anyway, why are you here?",
      "Shouldn't you be with your mother?\"",
      "\"Firstly, will you shut up about that ignorant... person.\"",
      "I clench my hands to fists.",
      "\"Secondly, I want to hear the real story about you becoming the god of the Underworld later.",
      "Thirdly, I've always wanted to see your palace.",
      "My mom never let me, though.\"",
      "I look up at him, the shy look on my face I always use to get something done with my father, Zeus.",
      "Hades and Zeus are brothers, maybe it'll work on him too.",
      "He huffs.",
      "\"What?",
      "You want me to bring you?",
      "No",
      ".",
      "Too dangerous.\"",
      "I groan.",
      "\"Oh, come on, you're the god of the Underworld.",
      "What could possibly happen down there when I'm with you?\" \"Kore, it's the kingdom of the Dead.",
      "That does it for most people.",
      "I'm bringing you back to your mother.\"",
      "\"No,\" I say demonstratively.",
      "I sit down in the middle of the field and start inspecting the flowers in my immediate vicinity.",
      "He looks at me, unimpressed - at least, that's what I think, because I'm definitely not looking in his direction.",
      "I'm not!",
      "\"And that should stop me from trying?\"",
      "\"I will tell everyone you raped me,\" I say casually.",
      "\"That you found me here and I asked you for help and you just...",
      "well, raped me.\"",
      "\"And you think they'll take your word over mine?\"",
      "\"Apollo definitely will.",
      "I'm off to marry him anyway.",
      "He won't like it, you defiling me.\"",
      "\"That little piece of shit can't touch me.",
      "I'll crush him like the annoying fly he is.\"",
      "Hades does start to sound irritated now, that's a start.",
      "He walks towards me.",
      "I shrug.",
      "\"Hey, same here.",
      "You think I'll let him do anything to me?",
      "But trust me, he'll try.\"",
      "When Hades reaches forward to grab my arms and pull me up, I quickly make a small cage of roots grow around me and stick out my tongue.",
      "He throws me a bitch-face and throws his hands up in surrender.",
      "\"Fine.",
      "But if anything happens to you, it's not my fault.\"",
      "Then, he actually starts to walk away, calling for his dogs, apparently called Kerberos and Rigaros, to come with him.",
      "What is he doing?",
      "And we were having so much fun!",
      "I quickly get rid of the roots and get up to follow him.",
      "I start talking to him almost non-stop, not giving him a chance to send me away.",
      "At first, he just looks annoyed, but after a while, I see his face softening into a relaxed expression.",
      "He even chuckles when I tell him the story about why I'm really hiding in the forest.",
      "\"Marrying Apollo?",
      "He's just pathetic.\"",
      "\"I know.",
      "And every nymph ever starts swooning when his name comes up.",
      "I really don't know what it is about him.",
      "He's such a douche.\"",
      "Hades seems to think for a minute.",
      "\"You know, if that's truly the reason you don't want to go home, I guess you could, I don't know, take a vacation in my place for a week?\"",
      "\"Would you do that for me?",
      "That's so sweet!",
      "Especially for the god of the Underworld,\" I smirk.",
      "\"If you don't stop emphasizing that, I will withdraw the invitation.\"",
      "\"Alright, alright, I'll stop.",
      "You wuss,\" I say under my breath with a roll of my eyes.",
      "\"What did you just say?\"",
      "He turns around with a thunderous expression, stopping in the process, but his eyes show mirth.",
      "\"You know, I could always have Kerberos or Rigaros tear you to pieces.\"",
      "\"You're letting your dogs do that?",
      "As I said, you're a wuss.\"",
      "I pet his cheek and walk around him with Kerberos en Rigaros behind me, barking my ears off.",
      "\"Oh, you're going to pay for that.\"",
      "The next thing I know, I'm being tackled to the ground by the king of Hell.",
      "I roll over, groaning loudly, to see him pushing himself up on his elbows, a smirk on his face.",
      "\"First lesson,\" he says.",
      "\"If you're going to live with me for a while, you won't insult me.",
      "If you do, you'll have to face the consequences.\"",
      "I try to fold my arms in front of my chest, but since Hades is looming over me, my hands end up in his sides instead.",
      "A great plan begins to form in my mind.",
      "\"Well, I guess I'll have to do just that then.\"",
      "And I start tickling him mercilessly.",
      "It takes less than five seconds for him to basically collapse on top of me, enabling me roll us over and pin his hands over his head.",
      "\"That is, if it won't be the other way around.\"",
      "I can see he's not really trying to hold me back.",
      "He's way too strong for me to keep him down if he really didn't want me to, but I think that he's enjoying this, having human (or divine) company.",
      "I'm pretty sure that under that whole bad guy facade, he is actually a big, soft teddy bear.",
      "If everything goes the way he wants it to go, that is.",
      "Maybe I should try not to get him mad.",
      "It's nice as long as it lasts, but when Hades has had enough, I'm beneath him again in seconds, now with my own hands pinned above my head.",
      "He throws me a wink, sits up straight and runs a hand through his hair.",
      "\"Well, not that I'm not enjoying this impromptu wrestling match, but we really should get going if you want a tour before dinner.\"",
      "\"Are we nearly there yet?\"",
      "\"Lesson number two, no stupid questions.",
      "Look behind you.\"",
      "I nearly pull my neck muscles to see what he means, and my jaw drops once again.",
      "\"Is that-\" Hades nods, a proud look on his face.",
      "\"One of the entrances to the Styx.\"",
      "He stands up, pulls me up from the ground as well and wipes some grass and dirt from my dress.",
      "After a short whistle, Kerberos and Rigaros run towards the black cave in front of us, disappearing completely within two seconds.",
      "I start skipping towards the cave too, eager to investigate, but Hades pulls me back.",
      "\"Wait, you're not dead, so you'll stand out terribly if you go in there on your own.",
      "I know I probably won't be able to stop you from doing something you really want, but at the very least, stay by my side until we've reached my palace.\"",
      "\"You have a palace?\" I ask.",
      "\"Well, of course I do.",
      "I'm the god of the Underworld, remember?\"",
      "He brushes off the last blades of grass and nudges me a little, his eyes lingering on mine a little longer than necessary.",
      "\"Come on, let's go.\"",
      "\"Okay, so we'll have to cross the Styx here.",
      "Very Important Lesson number three, don't ever stick your hand in the water, or you'll die.\"",
      "Being the annoying child that I am, I reach out my hand towards the river, even though we're still too far away for me to touch it.",
      "He immediately slips his arm around my waist, pulling me back, and I snort.",
      "\"I thought that only counted for mortals?\" Hades looks at the water dubiously.",
      "\"Officially, yes, but let's not test that theory, alright?\"",
      "He stalks towards the river, past the line of waiting souls, trusting me to follow along.",
      "He stops in front of a very old looking boat, in which an equally old looking man is seated.",
      "He sounds almost fond as he speaks his next words.",
      "\"Charon, my friend, how are you today?\"",
      "The old man shrugs.",
      "\"Same as always, your Grace.",
      "Some spirits here haven't got enough money to pass and won't stop being a huge pain in the ass, but the others are quite nice.",
      "They're just scared for what comes next.\"",
      "Hades nods, an understanding look on his face.",
      "\"Oh, yes, of course, the trial.",
      "Oh, well.",
      "I'd like to pass.\"",
      "Charon only then seems to notice me and looks me up and down, his eyes calculating.",
      "His next words, however, are still for Hades.",
      "\"If you don't mind me asking, your Grace, why don't you just snap your divine fingers and teleport yourself to the palace?\" I glance at Hades, but he doesn't seem to be as indignant as I thought he would be.",
      "On the Olympus, you can't talk like that to Zeus.",
      "He would kill you deader than dead.",
      "And yes, that's possible.",
      "I've seen it happen.",
      "But Hades just smiles and shrugs as well.",
      "\"I felt like a walk.\"",
      "Charon smirks, nodding towards me.",
      "Hades coughs.",
      "\"Oh yes, this is... Persephone.",
      "She wanted to see the palace so I thought I would take her down for a tour.\"",
      "Persephone...",
      "He just called me bringer of death.",
      "Awesome.",
      "I nod eagerly.",
      "\"Yeah, isn't he a nice guy?\" I say, petting him on the shoulder, ignoring the surprised look on his face.",
      "\"I was walking through the forest and I saw this nymph and...",
      "Wait before I tell you my whole life story, do you need toll or anything?\" Charon laughs heartily and gets a coughing fit from the force of it.",
      "He waves away my concern and motions for me to walk to the boat.",
      "\"No ma'am, that won't be necessary.",
      "Special guests deserve special treatment.\"",
      "I blush lightly at the compliment.",
      "\"Does the madam want the carriage for her own, or is sharing alright too?\" \"Private\" - \"Sharing!\"",
      "we say at the same time.",
      "I immediately turn pleading eyes on my impromptu friend and I see the resistance melting away from his face.",
      "He turns to Charon.",
      "\"We seem to be sharing,\" he says, to which Charon only answers with a knowing smirk.",
      "Hades pushes me in the direction of the boat with a hand placed lightly in the small of my back and helps me climb over the side before climbing in himself, ignoring all the awed stares the pair of us is gathering.",
      "When I'm seated comfortably I look around me, taking in the completely different surroundings.",
      "I place my hands on Hades's shoulders and shake them excitedly.",
      "\"Oh my gods, this is awesome!",
      "Thank you for taking me here!\"",
      "Hades smiles fondly at my antics.",
      "\"You're quite welcome, philtate.\"",
      "The pet name seems to slip in almost casually, but when I look at him, I see a blush creeping up his neck.",
      "I turn to look forward in the boat and lightly bump shoulders to indicate it's fine, causing him to sag and let out a quiet breath of relieve.",
      "When the boat is entirely filled with souls, Charon pushes off and starts rowing.",
      "I look around again excitedly and look over the side of the boat to see what the water of the Styc looks like, which prompt Hades to put an arm around my waist again to make sure I don't accidentally topple over into the water.",
      "\"Did you know, Persephone?\" Hades says, probably trying to distract me from doing dangerous things.",
      "\"Did I know what?\" I turn to face him, immediately noticing how close we are sitting.",
      "\"If you want, I could teach you how to make soul flowers?\"",
      "I'm intrigued.",
      "\"Soul flowers?\"",
      "\"Yes.",
      "You see, the power of a god is derived from their soul, which, for example, contains enough energy for you to grow an entire year's harvest in only a minute.",
      "You would feel a bit drained afterwards, but you could do it.",
      "Now, normally you make actual flowers, but you can also give a sort of corporeal form to your soul and make a soul flower.\"",
      "I clap my hands excitedly and shuffle backwards a little to create more space.",
      "\"Show me,\" I demand.",
      "He arches an eyebrow.",
      "\"Only if you ask nicely,\" Hades responds with a smirk.",
      "I press my hands together against my chest and look up to where the sky would have been, had we been on earth.",
      "\"Please, please, please! \"",
      "I beg.",
      "He laughs delightedly and I smile at the sound.",
      "\"Alright, but I'm not going to make a flower.",
      "I have a reputation to uphold.\"",
      "\"Oh, yeah, because, Gods forbid, no-one needs to know the King of the Underworld can make flowers at will.",
      "You know, it might be a good thing to soften your image a bit.",
      "It might make people less reluctant to go to your realm.\"",
      "\"I don't have to, because they go here anyway, whether they want to or not.",
      "And when they're here, they see it's not that bad.\"",
      "I groan and drop my head in my hands.",
      "\"You're such a guy.",
      "People have feelings, you know.",
      "Might be a good thing to act accordingly.\"",
      "Hades doesn't respond, but when I look up to see what's gotten into him, I'm suddenly surrounded by a bush of plants and flowers.",
      "They are different from normal flowers, though.",
      "You can almost see through them and are a simmering white.",
      "When I reach out a hand to touch them, my finger goes right through them, but they don't disappear.",
      "Charon coughs discreetly.",
      "\"Sir?",
      "We're here.\"",
      "Hades looks up at him, cheeks reddening slightly, and clears his throat as he stands up.",
      "The moment breaks and, to my great disappointment, the flowers disappear.",
      "He steps on the ground next to the boat and extends his hand to help me out too.",
      "After saying goodbye to Charon, he places his hand on my lower back and lightly pushes me in the general direction of a great, looming palace.",
      "As soon as I see the depressing place, I nod determently.",
      "\"Yep, I'm going to cheer this place up.",
      "You can definitely use some flowers.\"",
      "\"And have you thought of asking the owner of said place what he thinks of this plan?\"",
      "\"Of course not.",
      "You don't have any say in this.",
      "You would only mess it up.",
      "You know what you need?",
      "A wife.",
      "She would keep the palace nice and tidy for you while you're doing... whatever you do to pass the time.\"",
      "After a second of thought, I add, \"and she would have to be an awesome queen of course.",
      "Someone that demands respect from everyone who sees her.\"",
      "Hades quirks an eyebrow, while making sure I don't fall over anything on the ground, since I'm not exactly looking where I'm going.",
      "\"Oh, really?",
      "And do you have someone in mind or are you just fantasizing?\"",
      "\"Well...\" Me.",
      "But no way I'm gonna tell you that.",
      "\"I know a nymph who wouldn't say no to ruling an entire kingdom?\" I say nonchalantly, prodding him in the side.",
      "He looks extremely offended by the mere idea of marrying a nymph.",
      "He 'hmphs' and looks straight ahead, ignoring my chuckles.",
      "\"Nawh, don't be mad, you big baby.",
      "Maybe you could show me around the palace.\"",
      "He stops abruptly, turns around and grabs my arms.",
      "\"First of all, I'm not a baby.",
      "Second, I'm not mad, I'm just annoyed.\"",
      "\"Pff, of course. 'Annoyed'.\"",
      "He clenches his jaw - which is rather distracting, really.",
      "This may be the first time I really understand what Aphrodite means with 'he did the jaw thing and I lost it'.",
      "\"Yes,\" he growls.",
      "\"Annoyed.",
      "And why are you looking at me like that?\"",
      "\"Like wh-what?\" I say.",
      "I immediately curse myself for not being able to form a sentence of more than two words.",
      "He takes a step back when he hears me stutter.",
      "\"You're not- You're not afraid of me, are you?\" I blink twice before answering.",
      "\"What?",
      "No, of course not.\"",
      "Just slightly turned on...",
      "\"Come on, I still want to see the palace.\"",
      "I take a step closer to him and link our arms together as a silent peace offering.",
      "I see his features relax again and hear him sigh softly.",
      "\"And you promised to tell me the story of how you really became the god of the Underworld, remember?",
      "If you really didn't offer to take this place yourself, then how did you end up here?\"",
      "He sighs.",
      "\"You probably know the story of how our dad ate me and my brothers and sisters.",
      "Well, your father wasn't eaten, because our mom Rhea saved him.",
      "Zeus eventually saved us from Kronos and got to choose which realm he wanted to rule.\"",
      "\"So he chose Olympus.\"",
      "\"Yes.",
      "Now, Poseidon got to choose next, because I'm actually a pretty nice person and, being the responsible older brother, let him choose first.",
      "He didn't want the Underworld either and chose the sea.",
      "That's how I got stuck with.... this graveyard.\"",
      "\"Well, I think it's awesome.\"",
      "He shoots me a hopeful smile.",
      "\"Really?\"",
      "\"Yeah, it just needs some colour, like I said earlier.\"",
      "He looked at his palace critically, slowly starting to nod.",
      "\"Hm, I guess you've got a point.",
      "But I'm not going to do it.",
      "I've got better things to do with my time.\"",
      "I roll my eyes and lose my footing as I stumble over a small rock that somehow found its way into my path.",
      "Hades quickly grabs my waist, making sure I don't fall flat on my face.",
      "\"Like what?\" I say, as I casually hang only half a meter above the ground.",
      "\"Playing with Kerberos and Rigaros?\"",
      "He smirks and pulls me up from my admittedly uncomfortable position.",
      "\"For one thing, yes.",
      "But also, I don't know, ruling the Underworld?\"",
      "\"Pff, no, why would you think that?\" I start to giggle and shake my head.",
      "\"Now, the palace?\"",
      "He bows mockingly.",
      "\"But of course, my lady.\"",
      "The palace is huge, but Hades shows me everything in just under an hour.",
      "Well, 'shows' probably isn't the right word.",
      "He's more like a whirlwind, telling me what a room is while already walking towards the next one.",
      "But it's probably for the best, because otherwise it would've taken us three days.",
      "At some point, a servant comes up to us, telling Hades he's needed in Tartaros.",
      "He sighs.",
      "\"Fine.",
      "Persephone, if you'll follow Daichi, he'll show you to your room.\"",
      "\"Wait, I'm not coming with you?\" I ask, surprised, and maybe a bit scared and lost too.",
      "I'm gonna be alone here, in this huge palace, the palace of the dead.",
      "And I'm not... dead yet, right?",
      "What if this is all a trap?!",
      "Wait, stop thinking like that, that's not true.",
      "Right?",
      "I point at him angrily.",
      "\"If this is all a trap...",
      "Remember our talk about consequences?\"",
      "Now he looks offended for a split second, but understanding soon crosses his face and he holds up his hands placatingly.",
      "\"Yes, I do, and no, this is not a trap.\"",
      "He places his hands on my shoulders and steps a little bit closer.",
      "\"Just go with Daichi.",
      "He will make sure you won't miss anything.",
      "I'll be home before dinner.\"",
      "He is gone before I can protest.",
      "Huh, home... Sounds nice.",
      "Lost in thought, I follow Daichi to a room with a view over a grim... garden, at least that's what I think it's supposed to be.",
      "It all looks like dead plants to me.",
      "Well, there is one tree.",
      "One lonely tree with red fruits hanging from the branches.",
      "This could definitely use some more colour, so I decide that once I know how to make the soul flowers Hades showed me, I'm gonna use them to make the gardens around here a bit more colourful.",
      "But for now, what am I going to do until Hades returns?",
      "Sighing, I take a look around the room, opening cabinets and doors, eventually settling on looking through the biggest closet.",
      "I purse my lips, thinking of things that it could contain, but after a few seconds I have enough of guessing and open the doors.",
      "Hm.",
      "Maybe it would be safer to wear some clothes fitting the environment if I'm gonna roam the castle.",
      "I flip through the dresses hanging in the closet and settle on a floor-length red and black robe.",
      "Once I'm dressed and have looked at myself in the mirror abundantly to ensure everything is in the right place and I look awesome, I start going through the contents of the closet again.",
      "After several drawers of sandals and belts, I finally stumble across something infinitely more interesting.",
      "There is a very old looking key underneath a big heap of jewelry that someone clearly hoped to hide from curious eyes.",
      "Well, not from me.",
      "I'm way too good.",
      "Okay, kidding.",
      "But really, I spotted it immediately.",
      "Now only one question remains in my brain, all the other thoughts disappeared.",
      "What lock does it open?",
      "I mean, if there's a key, then there has to be a lock.",
      "You know, my mom always told me I'm too curious for my own good.",
      "Well, she can suck it up, I'm gonna find the lock this thing fits in anyway.",
      "I quietly walk to the door leading to the hallway and stick my head out to see if there's a guard outside.",
      "When I see no-one, I tiptoe into some random corridor, but the key doesn't fit on any of the doors there.",
      "I continue through the rest of the palace in much the same way, until I hear a gasp.",
      "When I quickly turn around, however, there's no-one to be seen, although I do hear a vague \"Kore...\" What?",
      "Did I just imagine that?",
      "Let's hope so.",
      "Not one to give up after one set-back, I continue my quest through the palace.",
      "Sadly, I still haven't found a single lock that even looks like it could fit the key after two hours of searching, which is why it isn't surprising I begin to slack off and turn a corner without looking if someone is approaching first.",
      "I curse when I crash into someone's chest with a little more force than is comfortable.",
      "\"Lady Persephone?\" I hear the human wall ask.",
      "I straighten my back and try to look as regal and dignified as I can.",
      "\"Yes?\"",
      "\"Thank Hades I found you, my lady.",
      "We've been looking for you all over.",
      "My master requested that you were to be brought to the dining room.",
      "You see, you weren't in your room so everybody sort of panicked..\"",
      "\"Oh, really now?",
      "Well, how about we indulge this master of yours in his wishes just this once?",
      "Lead the way.\"",
      "After passing the same corridor for what feels like thrice in five minutes, the guard stops in front of a big door that I vaguely remember passing once or twice in my quest for the lost lock.",
      "He opens the door and makes a small bow, gesturing for me to go inside.",
      "I am extremely tempted to walk into the room and announce myself by calling out, \"the me has arrived!\", but I decide against it and enter the dining room like a normal person.",
      "\"There you are!\"",
      "Hades calls out, getting out of his chair.",
      "\"I wondered where you might've run off to.",
      "To be honest, I was a bit worried.\"",
      "I skip to the table he's sitting at and sit down next to him, petting Kerberos and Rigaros in the process.",
      "\"You were worried?",
      "I'm a big girl, you know?",
      "I don't think I'm stupid enough to get myself killed in a house.",
      "I mean, you've known me for a few hours now, so I hope you can tell I'm not that stupid.\"",
      "\"You might've noticed this is not your average house, nor is it your natural habitat.\"",
      "He runs a hand through his raven black hair and smirks.",
      "\"I don't think you'd survive that long.\"",
      "He leans forward an places his hand on mine.",
      "\"I have no idea what you're talking about,\" I say, grinning back at him.",
      "\"Oh, I found a key while nosing through your closet and went to look for the lock it fit on.\"",
      "Hades rubbed a hand over his face and looks at me incredulously.",
      "\"How can you tell me this so casually and in the same sentence claim you don't know why I think you wouldn't survive the Underworld on your own?\"",
      "\"Oh come on.\"",
      "I let out an indignant huff.",
      "\"You're just worried.\"",
      "\"Yeah, so?\"",
      "The way he so casually admits his worries about me makes me blush.",
      "And somehow I don't mind that he worries about me, other than when my mom says she only worries because she doesn't want to see me hurt.",
      "\"Nothing.",
      "What do you think about the dress, anyway?\"",
      "\"I can't see it properly like this.",
      "Why don't you twirl for a bit?\"",
      "From the look on his face I'm fairly certain he knows exactly what it looks like, but just wants to see it again.",
      "Or maybe he wants a better view?",
      "Who knows.",
      "I stand up and turn around slowly, making sure to move my hips enticingly.",
      "When I stop twirling, he is still looking at me, elbows on the table and his fingertips pressed together, his eyes slightly narrowed.",
      "I give him a look and he coughs loudly before turning towards his plate.",
      "\"So, I was thinking...\" Hades starts.",
      "\"Never the best thing to do, but go on.\"",
      "\"Would you listen to me for one second without commentary?!\"",
      "When I move my fingers across my lips to zip them shut, he nods.",
      "\"Thank you.",
      "As I said, I was thinking, maybe... maybe you would like to go stargazing tonight?",
      "Daichi told me it's completely clear.\"",
      "Eyes wide, I look at him.",
      "\"You can see the stars from here?\" I ask, bewildered, but very enthusiastic.",
      "He smiles and shakes his head slightly.",
      "\"No, we would have to make a little field trip to earth, but that's done with a snap of my fingers, so shouldn't really pose a problem.",
      "What do you say?\"",
      "I'm trying really, really hard to form a normal sentence, but I only manage a kind of croak.",
      "Great.",
      "Super charming.",
      "Hades is completely quiet for two seconds before bursting out laughing.",
      "\"What was that?\"",
      "On the inside, I'm dying.",
      "My stomach clenches and I look away from him, directing my gaze to the food on my plate.",
      "Trying not to be too obvious about my feelings, I huff and fold my arms, petulantly refusing to speak after he completely unnecessarily laughed at me.",
      "Hades waits patiently for a whole minute, but when he has accepted I won't be speaking anytime soon, he continues the conversation on his own.",
      "\"So, going by the earlier parts of our conversation, I assume you are so enthusiastic you are unable to form words?",
      "In that case, stargazing it is.\"",
      "\"You know, laughing at someone can hurt someone's feelings,\" I say instead of answering, completely ignoring his last words.",
      "\"Maybe that's why they put you down here.\"",
      "He arches an eyebrow.",
      "\"Really?",
      "You're being naive.\"",
      "\"Insulting them won't exactly help your case,\" I add, starting to feel kind of angry.",
      "Forget kind of, I'm getting downright pissed.",
      "He gently places a hand on my arm.",
      "\"Philtate, listen to me.",
      "It was not an insult.",
      "It slipped out before I could control myself.",
      "To be fair, usually, there are only ghosts here.",
      "And you might think that to be awesome, they're definitely not funny.\"",
      "I throw him a scowl.",
      "\"I wasn't trying to be funny.\"",
      "He sighs.",
      "\"Fine.",
      "How can I make it up to you, huh?\" I give him a calculating look.",
      "Mkay, he's better than Apollo, I have to give him that.",
      "Way better, too.",
      "Apollo would have given up on me ten minutes ago.",
      "Hades is so sweet.",
      "And I think that says something, with him being the god of the Underworld.",
      "And he is good with animals, which is, well, one of the things that make him a good person.",
      "I don't think I've ever met a god who was genuinely interested in me.",
      "The rest is just narcissistic.",
      "I purse my lips.",
      "\"The stargazing does sound nice.\"",
      "Hades's eyes brighten.",
      "\"Great, that's decided then.\"",
      "A grin appears on my face, so wide it actually hurts, but I can't suppress it.",
      "Hoping Hades doesn't notice my stupid expression, I turn to my plate and pick up some ambrosia.",
      "I'm already lifting it to my mouth when it's suddenly hit out of my hand, an arm almost hitting me in the face.",
      "I jerk backwards in shock and look to Hades sharply, who still has his arm outstretched in my direction.",
      "\"What the hell?!",
      "What did you do that for?\" I ask, still a little shaken from the sudden outburst, my heart pounding in my chest.",
      "\"You can't eat that!\"",
      "he says, way too loud, if you ask me.",
      "\"And why not?\"",
      "\"Because then you wouldn't be able to leave the Underworld permanently anymore.",
      "You would be bound to this place.\"",
      "\"And what?",
      "You don't want me here?",
      "Is that it?\" Hades looks positively scandalised.",
      "\"What?",
      "No, that's not it.",
      "I just think you should have the choice to stay or leave, not be forced because of some stupid rule.\"",
      "All my anger melts away at this admission.",
      "Not knowing how to reply to this properly, I fall back on teasing.",
      "\"Aahw, you do care.",
      "But I am hungry, so what will I be eating?\" Hades smirks.",
      "\"I'm sure there are plenty of families upstairs who would be willing to provide two gods with some food, don't you think?\" Hades laughs heartily.",
      "\"Did you see their faces?",
      "I almost thought they were going to throw some food at us and then run into the forest, just to get away from us.",
      "Peasants.\"",
      "I throw him a glare in lieu of wacking him over the head and his relaxed face quickly morphs into a frown.",
      "\"You're the god of the freaking Underworld, of course they're scared.",
      "You don't exactly look like Eros or something.\"",
      "He smiles at that.",
      "\"What?",
      "You don't think I'm handsome?\" I point a finger at his face.",
      "\"You're twisting my words.",
      "I never said anything of the sorts,\" I say, mockingly stern.",
      "\"So you do think I'm handsome?\"",
      "\"Twisting my words again.",
      "But if you so desperately need confirmation that you're handsome, sure.\"",
      "He wiggles his eyebrows, leaning forward.",
      "\"You sure?\"",
      "\"If you keep fishing for compliments, I'm taking it back.\"",
      "I look around at the forest we're walking through.",
      "In the time it took us to eat dinner, it's turned dark outside, so while I feel like I am familiar with my surroundings, we could just as well be walking in Africa.",
      "Okay, maybe not Africa.",
      "It's too cool for that.",
      "But you get my point.",
      "I have absolutely no idea where we are.",
      "Wait, that tree looks familiar, doesn't it?",
      "No, never mind.",
      "I squint my eyes at Hades playfully.",
      "\"Where are you taking me, huh?",
      "Are you abducting me?\"",
      "\"That's rich, coming from the girl who let me take her to the Underworld after only knowing me for ten minutes.",
      "I'm taking you stargazing, remember?\"",
      "\"Oh, come on.",
      "I'm never gonna hear the end of that one, huh?",
      "I was emotionally unstable.",
      "okay?",
      "Women get that sometimes.",
      "Even goddesses.\"",
      "I worm my hand in the small space between his side and his arm, trying to get him to walk arm in arm with me.",
      "\"Well alright then, take me stargazing.\"",
      "\"Emotionally unstable?\" he repeats.",
      "My heart sinks in my chest.",
      "O, gods.",
      "What have I said now?",
      "\"Was it that time of the month again?\" \"Gasp!",
      "How dare you ask me that so shamelessly?",
      "One does not simply ask a girl if she's on her period!",
      "Really, it is no wonder you're still alone in your fancy palace.\"",
      "As soon as the words leave my mouth, I regret having said them.",
      "I throw him a worrying glance, but he isn't looking at me.",
      "\"Remember lesson number 1,\" he says, his voice emotionless.",
      "\"As long as you're with me, you won't insult me.\"",
      "I squeeze him arm where it is wrapped around mine as a silent peace offering.",
      "\"I'm sorry.",
      "Really, I am.",
      "Sometimes I have no brain to mouth filter.",
      "It wasn't true, what I said.\"",
      "He quirks an eyebrow.",
      "\"How is it not?\" I shrug lightly.",
      "\"You have me.\"",
      "Crap, that sounded way too creepy and sappy.",
      "What if he just sees me as a girl friend?",
      "Like, a girl who is also a friend?",
      "I clear my throat.",
      "\"I mean- I have absolutely no idea what I said.",
      "Just forget about it.\"",
      "All I hear is a snap of his fingers before I'm suddenly even colder than I was two seconds ago.",
      "I don't have a lot of time to process, though, because a moment later, he has cupped my face with his hands and gently presses his lips to mine.",
      "I swear, it feels like fireworks exploding in my heart.",
      "He breaks the kiss a few moments, looking down at me with a small smile tugging at the corners of his mouth, before leaning down again and capturing my lips in another breathtaking kiss that turns me into a flustered mess.",
      "I don't know how to explain it.",
      "I've only known him since that morning, but it just feels right.",
      "It feels like everything Aphrodite told me about when I was little.",
      "Well, littler.",
      "He must be thousands of years older than me.",
      "Okay, don't think about that now.",
      "Focus, Persephone.",
      "Focus.",
      "I open my eyes.",
      "I startle slightly, but am instantly intrigued by the purplish hue of his eyes.",
      "I narrow my eyes at him.",
      "Does he know that is my favourite colour and change it on purpose?",
      "\"Yes,\" he says, which startles me even more.",
      "\"Did you read my mind?",
      "Talk about no privacy.\"",
      "He scoffs.",
      "\"No, you just said it out loud.\"",
      "\"Really?",
      "I did?\"",
      "\"Well, of course you did.",
      "Do you think I would keep something like 'I can read minds' from you if I could?\" I smirk.",
      "\"I don't know, would you?",
      "After all, I am the girl that followed you to the Underworld after only knowing you for ten minutes.\"",
      "\"Thank the gods for that, otherwise this would have been very awkward.\"",
      "I start giggling uncontrollably and soon we're both laughing until our stomachs hurt, to the point we both have to sit down to make sure we don't topple over.",
      "When I've managed to get a hold of myself again, I look at surroundings, scooting a bit closer to the guy who just gave me my first kiss.",
      "He wraps an arm around my waist and pulls me as close as possible without me sitting in his lap.",
      "He presses a kiss to the crown of my head, hesitates for a moment and captures my mouth with his again.",
      "I'm the one who pulls away, eventually, mostly to get some air.",
      "Damn, he knows how to get a girl breathless.",
      "\"I know I already said I didn't know where I was, but that hasn't changed one bit.",
      "So tell me, where did you snap us off to?\"",
      "\"We,\" he pauses for a dramatic effect, \"are on the most fabulous mountain-\" \" Kore?\"",
      "My head snaps around so quickly I almost get a whiplash. \"",
      "Hermes? \"",
      "I feel Hades tighten his arms around me.",
      "\"What are you of all people doing here?\" I choose these words for the sole reason of irritating him.",
      "Everyone knows Hermes absolutely hates being called human.",
      "As predicted, he scoffs, clearly schooling his features to hide his annoyance - he's failing miserably.",
      "He takes hold of one of my so quickly I can't do anything about it and pulls me on my feet.",
      "\"Your mother is worried sick about you.",
      "She hasn't paid attention to her tasks for weeks.\"",
      "\"Wait a minute.",
      "Weeks?",
      "I was gone for a day.\"",
      "Hermes shakes his head.",
      "\"Time is different in the Underworld.",
      "You've been gone for six weeks now.",
      "Everyone had lost hope of finding you.\"",
      "I throw a meaningful glance in Hades's direction, indicating we'll have words about this, and he looks at the ground in shame.",
      "\"We're going,\" Hermes says, slipping his arm around my waist and almost taking off, but something holds him to the ground.",
      "He curses and looks behind him, where Hades has stood up, his eyes now a ice blue and his hands flaming blue fire. \"",
      "You are going.",
      "We aren't going anywhere.\"",
      "His voice is low, thunderous.",
      "The air around us seems to vibrate and the ground begins to crack.",
      "But when he looks at me, hesitation is present in his eyes.",
      "\"That's what you want, right?\" Hermes lets go of me and turns to look at Hades, a smile displayed on his face.",
      "Slowly, he too starts looking more devine.",
      "His eyes turn gold, his skin begins to shine.",
      "He is fully confident that I will go back to Olympus.",
      "\"Yes, tell him, Kore.\"",
      "In reality, no-one gives me the time to answer either one of them.",
      "Hades' eyes narrow and the cracks in the ground widen.",
      "I swallow harshly, looking into one of the closest ones, and take a horrified step back when I see skeletons climbing up the soil.",
      "\"As I said,\" Hades thunders, \"she is not going anywhere.\"",
      "\"No!\"",
      "I scream.",
      "\"Hades, stop it!\"",
      "He doesn't look at me.",
      "He ignores me completely, and I can't have him killing my half brother, how annoying he might be.",
      "\"Hades, look at me!\"",
      "I scream, jumping in between them, holding up my hands.",
      "Without really noticing, I send some energy into the ground to grow little bushes over the huge cracks.",
      "\"Look at me!\"",
      "Hades blinks, the blue in his eyes softening a bit, slowly shifting more to a warm purple, but we're not there yet.",
      "\"Hades, philtate, you have to listen to me.",
      "I'm not going anywhere you're not.",
      "But if you kill my brother, I have no choice but to go to Olympus and explain to my father what happened.",
      "You have to calm down.",
      "You hear me?",
      "Calm down. \"",
      "Hermes scoffs loudly.",
      "\"See?",
      "He's not a good fit for a goddess.",
      "He has anger management issues.\"",
      "Hades's eyes instantly turn back to icy blue.",
      "I turn around sharply. \"",
      "What did you just say?\"",
      "Honestly, I've never seen my brother this... terrified of me. \"",
      "He has anger management issues?",
      "What about our father, huh?",
      "What about you?\" I throw my arm back to point at Hades. \"",
      "He doesn't complain about his job or the fact that he still hasn't got a wife to grow old with.",
      "Every damn god or goddess on Olympus is basically the archetype of anger management issues, so don't you dare insult him like that.\"",
      "I'm ready to jump him and claw his eyes out, but two strong arms slip themselves around my waist and pull me back.",
      "One snap of his fingers, and Hades and I are back in his palace, this time in a large, almost all black room.",
      "Since I'm entirely too comfortable in Hades's embrace, I look around the room without stepping away from him.",
      "\"Are these your quarters?\" I ask.",
      "I feel him nod.",
      "\"Yes, and you'll have to excuse me.",
      "I have a war to prepare, so make yourself comfortable.",
      "\"You sound rather cheerful with a war upcoming,\" I say dryly.",
      "He shrugs.",
      "\"Remember, my army consists of dead soldiers.",
      "They're dead, so they can't die in battle, and there have been a lot of wars, so there are a lot of good dead soldiers.",
      "A war I can win, and knowing that, it's easy not to be afraid.\"",
      "\"That's not all.\"",
      "A broad grin appears on his face.",
      "\"You chose me, philtate,\" he whispers, stepping close.",
      "\"You chose me, the god of the Underworld, over Apollo, the god of the Sun and I know what more.",
      "You chose me over your own family.",
      "So the least I can do is win this war.",
      "And, between you and me, it's nice to win from my sickening brothers.",
      "We will let them see who's the strongest.\"",
      "He's gone before I completely realize he said 'we'.",
      "The fruits are still a beautiful, deep red.",
      "When I reach out to pull one off the branches, the leaves turn from black to green.",
      "It looks like only my presence makes the tree come to life, as if it's saying that I'm doing the right thing.",
      "And maybe it is.",
      "Maybe it isn't.",
      "I take a deep breath and tear the fruit of the branch, taking a big bite.",
      "The juice drips down my chin, but I don't care and take another bite.",
      "I go on and on and on, until the fruit is gone and I know it's enough.",
      "I jerk up from where I was dozing of on Hades's bed, almost falling down on the ground in the process, when the door is thrown wide open and someone comes barging in.",
      "\"What's going on?",
      "Are we being attacked?\" I ask Hades when I recognize him in the dim light from the red, orange and yellow candles scattered across the walls.",
      "\"What's going on outside?\" Hades is fuming, a good 170 pound mass of muscles and anger.",
      "\"The war is canceled.\"",
      "I give him a look.",
      "\"So you interrupted my beauty sleep for a bit of drama?\"",
      "The blue flames that enveloped him when he entered suddenly disappear.",
      "\"You don't need beauty sleep, philtate.\"",
      "Why is he so freaking adorable?!",
      "Directly after saying something so sappy he will probably forever deny having said it, the flames appear again as he starts to explain what happened earlier.",
      "\"I was just of preparing the troops, when this little shit came barging in.\"",
      "He turns away from me and gestures towards a figure standing in the shadows.",
      "I squint my eyes, but don't recognize him due to the lack of light, at least not until he takes a step forward.",
      "Hades continues like he doesn't notice my confusion.",
      "Why would my father send Apollo to talk to Hades?",
      "Wouldn't Zeus know that this is like the most irrational decision ever and that there is a huge chance that this will turn out in a fight?",
      "\"And he says that there will be a trial, because they don't want to 'crush me and my forces'.",
      "Like they could,\" Hades mutters so only I can hear him.",
      "\"I mean, I can win a war, but a trial?",
      "I'm sorry, philtate, but I fear everything is lost now.\"",
      "I throw him an unimpressed look.",
      "\"So much for the god of the Underworld.",
      "Drama queen, we'll be fine.\"",
      "I know he doesn't believe me the moment he focuses his gaze on me.",
      "He looks genuinely scared that we will be torn apart, that he'll lose what he has found.",
      "What he doesn't know, however, is that I have a secret trump card that will make it impossible for us to lose.",
      "I applaud myself mentally.",
      "Apollo clears his throat, takes a step forward.",
      "\"Kore, we have to go.",
      "Your mother is waiting for you.\"",
      "I feel a flash of irritation when he calls me Kore.",
      "\"Don't tell me what to do,\" I snap.",
      "\"And I don't care what my mother wants me to do.\"",
      "Hades places a hand on my shoulder to calm me down, and probably to make sure I don't attack him right then and there.",
      "\"Come on, philtate, we have a trial to win,\" he says calmly, before kissing me square on the mouth in front of the god I'm supposed to marry.",
      "\"Hey!",
      "Don't you dare kiss my bride!\"",
      "Apollo shouts.",
      "However, he is fully ignored by the both of us.",
      "When Hades pulls away, he narrows his eyes slightly.",
      "\"You-\" \"Anyway, we gotta go, right?\" I say, way too cheerful for the moment, but who cares?",
      "Hades tries - rather successfully for everyone else, but not for me - to hide his smirk and I know he has caught on.",
      "We walk through the dark hallways, the candles on the wall flaming bright blue as we pass, only to continue to their usual warm red a moment later.",
      "The walk through the palace is long.",
      "Too long.",
      "The only warning Hades gives me is a small squeeze of my hand, before snapping his fingers and teleporting us to the right hall, the hall where every trial is held, leaving a probably fuming Apollo behind.",
      "\"Hades,\" comes the thunderous voice of my dad.",
      "I resist the urge to roll my eyes and turn around, just like Hades beside me, to see my mom and dad sitting on the throne of the king and queen of the Underworld.",
      "He's not sitting beside Hera for once, maybe because my mom is more concerned by this than she is.",
      "Hades quirks an eyebrow.",
      "I only notice now how much younger he looks than most of the other gods.",
      "Did he do that just for me or is it because the time is different in the Underworld?",
      "\"Let's skip the formalities, shall we, brother?\" he asks, sounding very amused.",
      "\"And get your godly ass off of my throne.\"",
      "A familiar voice speaks up from a table to the side of the room.",
      "\"Try to keep things civil, Hades,\" Athena chides.",
      "The moment she speaks up, I turn around and break into a sprint.",
      "Athena is the only one of my family I actually like.",
      "She has always been like a big sister for me, and although it was only yesterday I saw her - at least for me - I still miss her.",
      "So, I think a hug is in place.",
      "Athena, however, stops me before I can do so, quickly explaining herself when she sees the hurt look on my face.",
      "\"I can't give you a hug, sweetie, I am to be the judge of this trial.",
      "I have to stay impartial.\"",
      "I study her face and see she's serious this time.",
      "Not that she's never serious or anything, but most of the time I can find a way to worm my way through some loophole or another to get her on my side.",
      "Since that doesn't seem to be the case now, I give her a nod and a smile that probably looks more like a grimace.",
      "I'm not sure if I could forgive her if she took me away from Hades.",
      "I walk back calmly to the chair Hades has sat down in.",
      "There is no chair for me, but since Hades is basically sitting on a small throne, judging by the width of the seat, I figure there is more than enough room for me to squeeze in.",
      "When I nudge his foot to make him move to the side, however, he stands up and offers the chair to me.",
      "I quirk an eyebrow, but he just shrugs and motions for me to sit down.",
      "\"Follow my lead if you want to make an unforgettable impression,\" he murmurs.",
      "\"Says the man who almost lost it at the thought of a trial,\" I whisper back, which earns me a poke in my side, but I sit on the throne anyway.",
      "\"Now sit up straight and act like you know what you're doing.\"",
      "Hades places a hand somewhere between my shoulder and the middle of my back and straightens his back.",
      "Suddenly, I see what he's doing.",
      "We probably make the perfect image of power and tranquillity.",
      "Feeling a grin break out, I quickly school my features into a more appropriate expression.",
      "\"Hades,\" Athena says eventually, after she's watched me squirm in the seat for a while.",
      "\"Where is your lawyer?\"",
      "She nods towards my mom, who sits in a chair like mine, Nike at her side.",
      "Shoot.",
      "Nike was a good choice, with her being the goddess of victory.",
      "\"Well, he died 6000 years ago,\" Hades deadpans, \"and I've made it this far, so let's continue.\"",
      "Athena quirks an eyebrow when I try not to lose my composure, and I almost fail, again, but with a lot of biting on my lower lip and a rather painful pinch in my neck from Hades, I manage to keep looking like a queen.",
      "Zeus stands up from his throne and folds his hands together.",
      "\"So, I'll tell you all how this is gonna go.",
      "Nike speaks for Demeter, Hades speaks for Kore.",
      "After that, Athena decides where Kore has to stay.",
      "All clear?\"",
      "So they're now going to fight about me without asking me what I want?",
      "Well that's just great.",
      "See, this kind of shit is why I left home in the first place.",
      "Nobody answers, but Zeus sits down again like everybody has answered him and gestures for us to begin.",
      "Nike, as expected, stands up first and begins talking about how sad I've made my mother by staying away and how bad living on the Earth is right now, because my mother has forgotten about all about her tasks.",
      "I don't see how that's my fault, but hey, did somebody ask me?",
      "No",
      ".",
      "Of course not.",
      "I almost fall asleep, so long does Nike's rant continue.",
      "I only stay awake because Hades pinches my neck at regular intervals.",
      "I don't know if he can feel me doze off in my chair or if it's meant to be supportive, but it certainly keeps me awake, so that's a good thing, I guess.",
      "And then, I've had enough of all this waiting.",
      "I stand up as well, slowly, to add some drama, and take the same pose as my father, hands folded and in front of my stomach.",
      "\"If I may say something,\" I start.",
      "I am rudely interrupted by Apollo, \"No.\"",
      "\"Well, excuse you, but I didn't ask you, so sit down on your divine ass again, blakas. \"",
      "\"Kore!\"",
      "Zeus and Demeter shout from the other end of the room.",
      "\"Yeah, FYI, I changed my name, okay?",
      "It's Persephone now.",
      "If you could actually call me that instead of basically calling me girl, that would be great.\"",
      "Zeus turns his gaze to Hades.",
      "\"What have you done to my baby girl?\" Hades gives his brother a satisfied smirk.",
      "\"Nothing.",
      "She chose to go after me, to follow me here.",
      "She wanted to stay here.",
      "And she let me kiss her.\"",
      "Not the best thing to say, in this room full of gods who kind of hate him.",
      "I facepalm as I let the cacophony of sounds roll over me that erupt after Hades's statement.",
      "\"Oh gods, Kore, he hasn't,\" my mother hesitates slightly, \"dishonored you, has he?\"",
      "I stare at her with a blank expression for a good five seconds.",
      "\"What?\"",
      "\"She's asking about our non-existent sex life,\" Hades whispers, so that only I can hear.",
      "I subtly kick him in the shin for almost making me laugh again.",
      "This is a serious trial, damnit!",
      "\"That is none of you nosy parkers' damn business,\" I hiss at my mom, starting to get really irritated by her already.",
      "I swear, she almost faints.",
      "\"Oh good gods, Zeus, he has!\"",
      "I groan.",
      "This is going to be a long trial.",
      "\"He hasn't, okay, mom?",
      "And stop asking about my sex life.\"",
      "Oh, how fun it is to use this kind of language in her presence.",
      "This can barely be considered foul language compared to some of the words I've heard mortals utter, but she already faints at the use of the word butt.",
      "\"But how hasn't he done it?\" my dad asks.",
      "\"You were here for months.\"",
      "I groan again.",
      "A long trial.",
      "\"Just because the only thought on your mind is sex with women other than your wife, doesn't mean I am the same.",
      "Besides, time is different in this part of the world.",
      "I call it space-time relativity.",
      "One day, the mortals will understand my genius and research it extensively.\"",
      "He looks at me like I've gone crazy.",
      "\"Is that a fancy way of saying you have done it?",
      "Are you speaking in tongues, young lady?\"",
      "\"No,\" I say, doing my best to shine all the exasperation through that I can muster.",
      "\"It means that the five minutes you took here to discuss my sex life in public took three hours and a half upstairs.\"",
      "He still doesn't get it.",
      "How stupid can you be?",
      "It's a miracle he actually gave birth to the goddess of wisdom.",
      "I throw my hands in the air.",
      "\"Fine, believe whatever you want.",
      "You know what?",
      "Yes, we did it.",
      "Happy?\" Hades chokes on air and glares at me, but there's no menace behind it.",
      "\"I'm gonna kill you, brother,\" my dad growls.",
      "Now it's Hades's turn to throw his hands up in exasperation. \"",
      "Now you choose to listen to her?",
      "How about the time she told Demeter she didn't want to marry a douchebag without having any say in it?",
      "And how about keeping her on a leash since the moment she was born?",
      "Has she ever had any fun?\"",
      "When I look at Athena, who is still standing on the other side of the room, I see she's almost ready to burst out into anger at the mess this trial has become.",
      "\"I want order!\"",
      "she screams, her voice high-pitched and squeaky.",
      "Zeus turns his gaze at her.",
      "\"You seriously think this was going to be a real trial?",
      "We're gods, we don't do trials.\"",
      "If I had to pick a moment where Athena would surely attack her own father, this would be it.",
      "I've never seen her this angry.",
      "Her eyes are metallic grey, the colour of her shield and spear.",
      "She takes a deep breath and walks away from our dad and the other gods sitting together.",
      "\"Fine.",
      "But then I'll choose her side.\"",
      "\"What?\" Demeter screams.",
      "I puff up my chest.",
      "Ha!",
      "That will teach them.",
      "\"Zeus, do something!\"",
      "Demeter says.",
      "\"Yes, Demeter,\" Zeus murmurs quietly, before speaking up.",
      "\"Persephone, you are to return upstairs immediately and remain there.",
      "You can't see Hades again for at least another year.\"",
      "I smirk devilishly.",
      "\"You know, I could do that.",
      "But then again, I could also just stay here.",
      "I don't really feel like dying yet, you know?\" Zeus sighs.",
      "\"Really, Kore-\" Ugh, he's using my old name again \"-stop this madness.",
      "You won't die, okay?",
      "I get it.",
      "You've just fallen in love for the first time, you'll die if you don't see him, but we can't have you making a scene right now.\"",
      "\"Oh, you simpletons,\" Hades sighs, shaking his head in mock sadness, \"how I wish it would be that simple.\"",
      "\"What do you mean?\" Apollo growls.",
      "I drop down on the small throne and turn sideways to throw my legs over one arm of the chair and lean with my back on the other.",
      "\"Well, you see, I got very hungry over the time I was here.",
      "I'm still a developing goddess, which takes a lot of energy.",
      "So, I went into the garden and found a pomegranate,\" I say over-excitedly.",
      "\"Turns out, they are delicious.\"",
      "A collective gasp can be heard all around the hall.",
      "\"Hades, you knew about this?\" Zeus asks.",
      "\"Nope,\" he says, popping the 'p'.",
      "\"At least, not until I kissed her afterwards.\"",
      "\"Look, it's no use fighting about it now,\" I say before my dad can murder his brother.",
      "\"I don't want to spend my whole life up on Olympus.",
      "I've never felt home.",
      "I've never felt like I belong there.",
      "I want to live here.\"",
      "A heart-wrenching scream of anguish sounds through the hall.",
      "My mom claps her hand for her mouth, tears running down her cheeks, all colour drained from her face.",
      "I swallow harshly.",
      "It's the truth, what I've just said, but I didn't count on this reaction.",
      "My mother and I have never really seen eye to eye on things.",
      "I just thought that she thought the same of this matter as I did, but that apparently isn't the case.",
      "The moment Hades places his hands on my waist and nudges me to continue, however, I know that what I said was the right thing.",
      "I straighten my back and look at Zeus and Athena to hear their final decision.",
      "Zeus is rubbing his temples as though all these complications ask too much of his small brain.",
      "Athena is the one to speak up, eventually.",
      "\"I think we can't deny her to stay here.",
      "She may have stayed here only a day, but she has found her place here.",
      "She looks happy for the first time in... forever.\"",
      "Demeter's face brightens somewhat.",
      "\"But she can't stay here forever!",
      "She has to take care of the plants upstairs, or else she would be ignoring her assigned task.\"",
      "For some reason, my eyes become wet with tears.",
      "\"So, what?",
      "I'll be spending half a year with you guys upstairs and a week here, because time runs different here?\"",
      "\"I think that's a great idea!\"",
      "Apollo calls out.",
      "I throw him a deathglare.",
      "What.",
      "An. Ass.",
      "\"I was only kidding, blakas!\"",
      "Athena holds up a finger.",
      "\"No wait, let's continue this trail of thought.",
      "I think this is probably the best solution, with the only change that the time should run at the same speed up- and downstairs.\"",
      "I blink.",
      "\"You can do that?\"",
      "Athena cocks her head.",
      "\"I, personally, can't.",
      "The only one that can won't help because he thinks we don't deserve his help.",
      "Trust me, we've tried.",
      "But I do know that a marriage will get the time streams to run at the same speed.\"",
      "Zeus clasps his hands together excitedly, happy that he can follow along again.",
      "After a few seconds, however, a look of true horror makes its way onto his face.",
      "\"Wait, you want to marry my only daughter off to some scumbag who doesn't even know how to think of proper punishments?!\"",
      "Athena throws him a glare.",
      "\"She's not your only daughter, remember?\"",
      "\"Well, of course I remember.\"",
      "\"Really?\" Athena looks unimpressed.",
      "\"Because it sure didn't sound like that.",
      "Have you forgotten the prophecy that was made about me? '",
      "She will have power and glory equal to her father's'.",
      "That's why you ate my mom, remember?",
      "And then you were ready to marry me to Hephaestus like it was nothing.\"",
      "\"Someone here has daddy-issues,\" Hades whispers in my ear, which sends my into yet another fit of giggles.",
      "\"Quiet!\"",
      "Athena snaps.",
      "\"If you want me to you help you out here, I suggest you don't insult me any further.\"",
      "Hades gulps and stays quiet.",
      "Now it's Athena's turn to rub her temples.",
      "\"Alright.",
      "This is what's going to happen.",
      "Persephone will join Hades in marriage-\" \"Hold on, no-one asked me, and I'm still her father!\"",
      "Zeus calls out.",
      "\"Shut up,\" Athena hisses.",
      "\"Okay.",
      "After that, Persephone will come with us upstairs, because the plants are all dead and we need you, honey.",
      "While she's there with us, no-one will harass her.",
      "Understand?\"",
      "She looks at Apollo, who shrugs and turns his back at us, mumbling something which sounds suspiciously like 'I didn't like her that much anyway'.",
      "Athena continues.",
      "\"Persephone, you will stay on earth for six months, after which you can return to your husband, where you can stay for the rest of the year.",
      "Does everyone agree?\"",
      "After some mumbling, most of the gods nod.",
      "Hades leans his head down and whispers in my ear, \"She didn't say anything against me visiting you...\" \"Shut up, you sap,\" I whisper back, turning around.",
      "\"We have a wedding to plan.\""

    "text": "Parched Argos decided to prove its epithet true with a particularly dry summer - which would have been the least of Nestor's concerns had he not needed to visit the city. As it is, he has no choice but to endure the vicious sun and hope his voyage is not fruitless. Ah, but he would have been a happy man indeed had the weather been his greatest trouble. No such luck. He is welcomed by Kapaneides Sthenelos, rests for a while, but enjoying the hospitality of the palace can wait. Apparently, at this time of the day the city's ruler is usually at the stables, and this is a perfect opportunity to speak to him away from undue attention. Besides, there are many distractions in the palace itself, and around it. Scribes busily moving tablets from one room to another, comparing notes. Officers bringing in reports. A smith demanding to know why he received less metal than he needed. Peculiar. Or, rather, not peculiar at all. Sthenelos is unperturbed, and leads the guest to a much less imposing building, with its unmistakable smells. Nestor understands the desire to train one's horses personally all too well, so the place feels entirely appropriate to him - a second home shared by most well-born men. Here the young king is, as expected. Along with a magnificent chestnut mare trotting around the yard. Circles, circles, sweat and dust. Even the horse is not enjoying the heat. - Diomedes, we have a visitor. He says he has important matters to discuss. - Good, Sthenelos. Sounds like something not meant for the palace walls to overhear. Palace walls are a fascinating existence. Very much alive and full of ears - not always friendly to the current residents of the citadel. For Argos, this is doubly true. The exhausted mare is led away by a servant, and all pretense of levity is banished from the scene along with her. Diomedes is all business now. - Khaire, son of Neleus, you honour us with your presence. - Khaire to you as well, Tydeides. I wish I was bringing happy tidings, but that choice is not mine to make. - Do those tidings come from Sparta, by chance? - Oh, so you have heard already. - No. Nothing whatsoever. Just horse gossip, - the son of Tydeus grins. Nestor fails to suppress a smile of his own. It seems, stable walls are not always deaf, either. - But of course. Incidentally, this matter you know nothing about is highly likely to end in war. The Atreidai expect all those who swore the oath of Tyndareos to remember that oath now and lead men against windy Wilusa. - Without sending an embassy to Priam beforehand? - the two Epigonoi exchange less-than-amused glances. - Oh, envoys have been dispatched. But by the elder brother, not the younger. You can deduce what that means, can you not, Diomedes? - Agamemnon wants them to fail, even if Paris acted without his father's knowledge. And the show of force without waiting for the results of the embassy is another insult. Unless the Troad is full of cowards for some reason, they will be seething with indignation, not planning to make restitution for the princeling's crime. The old man nods. Small coincidences and lapses in judgment ending in a great disaster - why must this story repeat itself so often? - Precisely. Now that he can use both his own leverage, and that of Menelaos, he can force Akhaia to unite under Mykene. Letting go of such an opportunity? Agamemnon? As if. - True. And if Priam does decide to cooperate, that just means Wilusa is weak and can be pressured into ever increasing concessions. Either way Agamemnon gets what he wants. - Well, he has never been humble in his desires. It is knowing what to do to achieve them that is the problem with him. - Forget the Atreidai for the moment. It is not their wisdom that is admired throughout Akhaia. What do you think, Neleides? Many speak sweet words to the ruler of Pylos, with their own ends in mind. For Diomedes, this is no more than a statement of cold, hard fact. Fair enough. Honesty for honesty. - I think Eris has already set the stage for precisely the kind of show She enjoys. And one can either remain a spectator, or become part of that performance. But the audience does not determine the course of the play. A canny actor, on the other hand... - So, your plan is - damage control? - Yes, damage control. As long as Agamemnon will listen to good counsel, a disaster for the Troad need not be a disaster for Akhaia. As for you two - well, you both took that oath, did you not? There is not much choice. - There is always choice. That oath was taken by private individuals. Therefore, every single one of Helen's suitors is bound to answer the call of the Atreidai. But - that's it. No armies, no ships. If all the suitors just showed up themselves, but refused to involve anyone else - what would Agamemnon do? For a moment, Nestor tries to imagine. - Do you intend to find out? - Of course not. What I mean is - something that originally concerned no more than a few dozen men should not bind all of Akhaia. There has to be something more serious. That is why I wanted to know your reasons for involving Pylos. - Consider this: is a crime committed by a shepherd and a king similar? - No. A king's actions have far-reaching consequences, therefore he should be held to a harsher standard. - There you have it. Paris saw fit to spit on xenia - very well, that is on him only. But he is not a nameless boy somewhere in the Troad. And she who followed him, willingly or otherwise - is the daughter of mighty Aigiokhos Himself. This will be spoken of. Not for a moon, not for a year - far longer. Sparta? Akhaia? The entire known world shall hear. And if a prince can go against the laws of the immortals and survive - what can be expected of simpler folk? Now, such things do not happen quickly. Generation after generation may slowly absorb this poison. But old age brings with itself the gift - or curse - of thinking in terms of centuries, whereas youth lives in the here and now. Of course one oath can not be enough to bind one land to a single purpose, and condemn another to ruin. Neither can the ambitions of a king. But there are laws to which all humans are subject, and those laws, when broken, thirst for blood. Diomedes seems to find the explanation acceptable. - A crime revealed and left unpunished festers, even if at the moment it might seem comparatively small. Akhaia's chosen medicine for such cases has always been bronze and fire, so that is what Wilusa gets if it grants Paris its protection. What do you think, Sthenelos? - I think this is going to bite everyone in the rear end. We are not talking a quick campaign here, right? Even if we take the city - can we recover after such a victory? And Agamemnon is bound to get used to being the largest wolf in the pack, so good luck curbing his appetites once we are done. - Good thing this can wait until after we deal with Wilusa, - Tydeides retorts. Nestor shakes his head. The list of potential complications is accurate, but not exhaustive. - I have one more thing for you to look forward to, young men: Hatti. Kapaneides throws his hands up in exasperation. - Could we perhaps seriously consider sabotaging this disaster before it gets out of hand? They both laugh - the two Epigonoi, spearman and charioteer. Whatever complaints or misgivings there might be - both recognize doubt for the ghost it is. Once the trumpets of war have been sounded - who cares about ghosts? Then, the ruler of Argos turns to his guest. - Let us go to the palace, son of Neleus. You are tired, and the sun is vicious. Just one more question. They say Wilusa is protected by a statue fallen from the sky, a sign of Athene's favour. Is that true? - I see no reason to doubt it. Are you wondering whether we shall be working against Her will in this matter? - We'll have to find out, it seems. And that is all there is to be said of the matter. Axiopoinos or Polioukhos, She Who metes out just punishment or She Who protects the city, whichever face Pallas Athene decides to show them - there is no choice, but to stand tall before the Goddess. *********************************************************************************** A note: yes, the author remembers there was an embassy with Menelaos and Odysseus, let us assume that happened later, there is time for multiple attempts at diplomacy.",

    "text": "Otto had quirks. Awsten knew them. He accepted them. For example, Awsten knew Otto never used social media, nor had he seen Otto use the internet in general, unless somebody asked him to Google something or anything else along those lines. Yes, he had thought it was weird at first, but as the years went on, he had gotten used to it. That was until he walked in on Otto brandishing a sword, facing off against a goat with legs. Human legs. Not just a goat, Awsten thought. Goat man? \"What the-\" was all Awsten managed to get out before both Otto and the Goat Man turned to him. \"Awsten!\" Otto yelled, surprise evident on his face. He lowered his sword, focusing on Awsten. \"You can see through the Mist?\" Awsten paused. \"Can I see through- what?\" \"You shouldn't be here! Get--\" In Otto's moment of distraction, the Goat Man had gotten close enough to swipe at Otto, leaving a red gash on his arm. \"Otto!\" Awsten cried out, taking a step forward. \"Stay away,\" Otto told him, stumbling a bit at the surprise attack. Switching the sword between his hands, he raised it above his head, and slashed it down at an angle across the Goat Man's chest. Just like that, it was gone in a cloud of gold dust. Otto sighed in relief, falling to his knees. Neither of them had noticed that Geoff had walked in behind Awsten, having heard the commotion. Otto looked at the two of them, with their jaws slack and their eyes big. Awsten had tears in his eyes. \"I can explain,\" Otto said, getting up. He slowly walked towards them, pressing on the soon-to-be scar on his arm. If only I had some ambrosia on me, he thought. He didn't bring any on tour with him, since he hadn't had any encounters with monsters in a while. \"First, can you please put the sword down?\" Geoff asked, voice shaking. \"Should I get a first-aid kit?\" \"I'll be fine,\" Otto answered, wrapping the bandana he was wearing around his arm. \"You guys should probably sit down though.\" --- \"So,\" Awsten started, trying to break the tension. They were all sitting in the back of the bus, away from the others. Awsten seemed to be trying to pull himself together, albeit unsuccessfully. \"Are you a demon hunter?\" \"Wh--What?\" Otto asked, taken aback. \"You were fighting the Goat Man. That's what that was right? So you're a demon hunter?\" \"No, that was-\" Otto figured he had to tell them, right then and there. What could he possibly lose? (The answer was a lot. He had a lot to lose.) \"You guys know about Greek Mythology, right? About Greek gods and goddesses?\" He figured they did, he just didn't know how to broach the subject that they were all real, and he had almost died multiple times because of it. Otto figured he wouldn't mention the almost dying part. They both seemed pretty shaken up, and telling them he could've been killed multiple times probably wouldn't help them to calm down. \"Yeah. Which isn't real.\" Awsten replied, sounding like even he didn't believe the words coming out of his mouth. \"That's what I thought too, but...\" Otto waved his hands aimlessly, not sure how to explain. \"You guys have heard of the goddess Hecate, right? She's the goddess of magic, witchcraft, and necromancy. And....she's also my mother.\" Their expressions did nothing to comfort Otto, and he got ready to hear them scream, or the words \"get off the bus,\" but none came. They just stared. And that was almost worse. When Otto had resigned himself to dying right then and there in Awsten's bunk, Geoff spoke up. \"So....you're a demigod?\" Geoff asked gently. \"Yeah, I-\" \"That's so cool, dude!\" Awsten interrupted, straightening up. \"Do you have, like, powers? Could you turn me into a frog?\" \"Awsten!\" Geoff reprimanded. \"What? It's a valid question.\" \"I mean, I guess so,\" Otto said thoughtfully. \"It'd only work at night, since that's when my magic is strongest-- wait, so you're okay with this?\" \"Of course, Otto. You're our best friend. Nothing's changed,\" replied Geoff. \"Yeah dude, what he said. We love you.\" Otto beamed. \"So then...what was that thing you were fighting?\" Awsten asked, still curious. His face was thoughtful, like he was scanning through his head, trying to find every bit of information he had about Ancient Greece. \"That was the Minotaur. He doesn't like me all that much,\" Otto said a bit sheepishly. \"He wouldn't have found me, but I had to make a phone call, and that's what led him here.\" \"Is that why you rarely use your phone? Does it attract monsters?\" \"Yeah, pretty much,\" Otto replied. \"It's basically a beacon for them.\" They sat in silence for a bit, Otto letting the boys take in the information. \"Wow,\" Awsten finally said. \"Yeah, it's a lot to take in.\" \"Well Otto,\" Geoff spoke up, and put his hand on his friend's knee. \"We support you.\" \"Thanks, Geoff,\" Otto replied, relief evident on his face. Awsten still had something to say, of course. \"So....how about turning me into a frog?\"",

( but now she's got a cup with something else in it / it's getting kinda blurry at a quarter past ten ) it started to fall apart during a party; she couldn't remember who had invited her or why she had come, all she remembered was drinking and being angry. they'd had a fight and she had stormed off, leaving him looking hurt in the shadows. ares had seen and followed her. he offered her a friend to talk to and she accepted. talking, and dancing, and drinking with ares was more about hurting zagreus than it was about wanting ares. she thrived on chaos and drinking until her vision blurs and until her laughter is a touch too loud, was the best kind. she knew she wouldn't be able to explain the smell of alcohol on her breath, or the purplish bruises on her neck, to her father and she laughed. ares didn't hear the bitterness behind it, instead he joined her, pressing his lips to her jaw. and zagreus saw it all. ( and he was in a hurry to be touching her skin / she's feeling kind of dirty when she's dancing with him / forgetting what she told me at the water fountain ) she could have stopped ares, stopped his wandering hands and his infrequent kisses. but, she didn't. she let the thrill of the moment run through her and she let everything blur together as they danced. then the door slammed, she didn't have to ask to know who left. she didn't expect it to hurt so much. zagreus ran from the party, getting in his car and taking off as fast as he could. his thoughts weren't on how he should be angry, how he should feel something, his thoughts were all on what he did that made her forget. she knew what it felt like to be broken, and this, this was no different. she still danced with ares, still let his hands roam, but now she was numb to it. she hadn't meant for this to happen and she hadn't expected to hate it so much. he treated her like a fragile thing and she had forgotten that he could break too... until she broke him.

    "text": "Icarus had fallen in love with Apollo the way stars form in the sky. A collection of exhales and moments of dusted tears fell in on itself, a tightness collected in his chest. They were exacerbated by heat and pressure, the god's presence and a desire to please him. Then, stars emerge in a space where nothingness used to preside, a hollow space underneath his fourth rib. Both were glittering and brilliant, doomed to die all too quickly. Icarus told himself there was no way a god would love him and it was foolish to assume otherwise. Apollo wasn't Zeus who set out to claim conquests. Icarus wasn't by any means worthy of his golden sun shine eyes and the corners of his mouth that slowly curled like drying ivy. Icarus knew to gods, humans were like intricate toys. Something to marvel at and pass the time, but never to be considered equal enough to earn the title of lover. Even his father, in all of his numerical opulence, had earned no god's love, had been given no gift of praise, had been cast no glance. Icarus was unsure what he could do to possibly glean what shine and gleam was enough to gain a god's attention. Icarus would have given anything to be witnessed by Apollo, even if for fleeting moments. His heart was an illogical, childish thing that ruled Icarus' head. It pounded in his chest like a headache, heartache. He found himself fantasizing about what if and by chances. He found himself speaking to Apollo as if he were an old friend when he were alone. He asked if he would like a piece of his meal, the last sip of his drink, the flowers he'd witnessed, the lyrics he thought of, the numbers from his father's project. The whispers among soldiers of a bow being cowards weapons didn't stop Icarus from practicing. How were they to say these things when archery was a skill of Apollo's? When the distance closed in and the animal fell with a shriek, a single blow to the heart in mock of the way Apollo had struck his own? When the meat was tender and buttery with Icarus to never swallow without thinking of Apollo? Icarus' very breath was in reverence of him as well as the ones he'd ended. He would wait until the sun was hidden away and Apollo left to his own devices and lay on his altar along with everything that had been left for him by nameless faces. He would feel the cool marble of it against his skin while staring at statues and paintings of him that decorated the rooms. Sometimes, if the sun had been too much, if it had overwhelmed him the way Apollo's brilliance had, he would lay on them naked, arms slung over the edge and fingertips brushing the linoleum floors. He would have let Apollo have everything, he would have let him use him however he pleased, play with him and his heart as he liked, so long as for a few moments of his fleeting life he was witnessed by him. He would lay on his altars and call his name, longing and desperate for acknowledgement. He lingered, vows of his devotion still leaving his skin heated, still leaving him breathless. How often he did this with eagerness, with earnestness, and never any lingering guilt. The only thing that ever lingered was Icarus in places for the god to claim things that were his, hoping one day to vanish along with the ether of fruits, blood of animals, and ambrosia. He wondered if the perfumed room mixed with his scent in a way that was pleasing or if the perfume overpowered it. He wondered if Apollo ever lingered and listened to the human whose only wish was to be his. He sought no blessing, no task or quest, no glory or fame. He simply wished to be graced with his presence, to be acknowledged, but the land was vast and the sun illuminated it all. His hopeless romanticism made him startle all the more when he realized the voice calling his name him wasn't one of many fantasies. The way Apollo called for Icarus reminded him of how people called for cats. Softly, worried they would vanish into the underbrush and away from their touch. He watched the god of sunlight and all of its splendors blink, pupils narrow like a goats before diluting into his golden hour irises like poison into water. He wondered if sometimes gods had to remember what humans looked like, if the finer details were lost on them. How frequently he'd praised his name, how carelessly, how desperately, yet before him now as he'd imagined, it was lost. The meaning of calling it didn't accomplish the radiant energy gods held. It didn't cease the valves in his heart from opening all at once and letting it flood. It didn't rightfully capture him in his splendor. Icarus was moved to tears that overflowed along with a sense of hopelessness, of no longer ever being fulfilled if not forever witnessing Apollo and his rapturous calescence. He wondered how long his blood would heat his altar, how many days he could go before the lack of Apollo's vibrance would move him to this measure. He couldn't wipe away his tears for fear of blinking and having him vanish. His touch was riant, ardent, words Icarus couldn't call the way he hadn't been able to his name. They didn't feel suited to his magnificence. His tears touched by Apollo now belonged to him, entombed by time and foreverness. His voice was the filtering of light through trees. He spoke his name once more and Icarus was grateful it was louder than the broken dam that was his body. He asked him why he felt the need to cry. Icarus couldn't explain to him how overcome with love for him he was for simply acknowledging him. He bowed before him on his hands and knees, willing to be the pedestal he perched on, only apologies escaping him. He wasn't worthy of more than a glance, yet alone a conversation. Icarus hadn't inherited his father's talent for numbers, his half brother's charm, his mother's practicality. He was dark curls and daydreams and notions of love, a pure thing of fantasy. Apollo raised his chin, Icarus an open wound, a shattering of holy glass from olympus as Apollo kissed away his tears. He thanked him for giving him a space inside of him always, of letting Apollo linger in his head, in his heart. It would be winter, it would be a time for Apollo's duties to ease, for his sister's to increase. It would give Apollo moments to steal away into the night and do as he wished while his sister worked. It would be cold, but he promised Icarus warmth the way Icarus had always promised him company. Apollo had listened as he pulled his chariot to the way Icarus would babble, share his every thought, become so open with him. He listened to the lilt in his voice as he'd call his name all hours of the day. The way everything wondrous made him think of Apollo. The way he proclaimed his love without ever having outright said such a thing. Apollo listened to someone who had devoted himself to him more than any priestess. He never cared for priestesses anyhow. The words resonated within Icarus like lyre strings, things Apollo's his deft fingers were familiar with. He understood the god to promise him, in the small space that would never house his grandeur. He understood how wildly he had been in love with Apollo, an overgrown forest strangling itself. How his love overwhelmed him, how it was all he could think of, how it fueled his every action. How it had been returned for being so genuine and without want, only to give. How Apollo's words promised to return it in kind, a mere exhale of his life. Did god's breathe? Surely they stole the breath from their lovers and Icarus would offer his own till his very last to him gratefully.",

    "text": "I was a devoted to a fault, praising Athena as her priestess. I was happy to not be married off, not to be given away to mortal kings or heroes. I wanted to be free from responsibilities and rejoice in my current life before going into the Underworld.I could have reincarnated to a different woman who is not beautiful or a princess. I could become a new woman or even a man, but that's not possible. I'm cursed and I doubt I'll be able to reincarnate after going into the River of Lethe. I'll be punished from my unintentional bad deeds. It all started to because I asked from help from my goddess. I wanted sanctuary from the Earthshaker. I begged for her to provide an intervention, yet he forcefully took me. I only became a priestess when I was younger because of my beauty. I wanted to get away from offers of men, and I spent years as her priestess. I thought I would be safe, yet she betrayed me. I wanted to remain chaste for myself and, in turn, for her. She could not sent some kind of divine help to allow me to escape from his embrace. Instead she cursed me into this monster. My beautiful hair turned into snakes, my red eyed gaze cause everyone into stone, my nails blacken and elongate into claws, and my canines become longer. Doomed to roam the earth being a monster for something that wasn't what I wanted. Gods are immune to my gaze, I found that out as I was changed when Athena cursed me at the end of the forced copulation. Poseidon was sickened by my appearance, and he disappeared. Athena turned away from me as she cast me aside her temple. The night guards looked at me and they were turned to stone. I still remember their faces, they had the same horrified looks on all of the faces in Athens. I ran all night to find some hidden place. So many innocent people were turned to stone, either coming near me due to hearing my snakes hiss, or curious of my figure near the river. Fishermen and servants became granite. I stole a cloak from one of the stonified mortals to go into self exile. I heard stories of my victims, and in turn, myself. I am a monster to everyone. I look like one and there are grotesque version of my body. I have leathery wings, I have tusks for teeth, my eyes are like fire, hooved feet, leathery skin, black thin lips, and my snakes would bite the nearest living thing. I am a vicious creature, filled with malicious toward my wrongdoers. I am against that. My snakes aren't that unruly, they are quite polite. I had to train them, and I finally got used to them curled around my neck when they are bored. It feels nice now, but I hate how they described me. The only one I hate, no, the only beings I hate are the gods. They are the ones who are supposed to help us. Sure they have their moods, but it is typically justified. It's not in my case, I was forcefully taken, and I asked for help before that. The only ones who heard my plea ignored me as I was defiled, and I was punished. I knew we were all playthings to the Gods, but we worship them. We ask for things and occasionally they will move to our will from our devotion. However, Athena didn't help me despite my pleas. I was devoted to her and she turned me into a monster. While there was copulation in her sacred temple, I did not want it. I fought against it, but what mortal can fight against a God? I'm angry at the Gods, specifically at Athena and Poseidon. It's something that no sane Greek will ever think, that the Gods are immoral and despicable. To no longer worship the higher beings because of being wronged due to losing my faith. I guess that some of the rumors that the other Greeks tell are semi-right. I am angry, but I don't take it out on everyone. It's a mistake that people are gazing at me when my cloak doesn't cover me well. It might be because my snakes sometimes move even though I sing them a lullaby to keep them asleep beforehand. However, at night the marketplaces are loud occasionally when I go out to buy food. There are times where I need to get rid of the statues that occasionally litter the area. At least I gain some strength to hall the statues onto my small raft to my cave. No use in leaving them in the towns as it would alert the Greeks of my presence. It's best if they believe their countrymen went out to vanquish me and failed to do so. One day one man will be brave and make an attempt on my life, and to that I wish him luck. I laugh at my grim thoughts. I am on borrowed time and well aware that my notary will soon bring a hero onto the mouth of my cave. I am alone and hated. I am angry and I have no faith toward the Gods. This is something no other Greeks would ever comprehend. To feel the wrath of the Gods upon them, to be hated by all mortals, that is what they fear. To not be favored and discarded like a toy. To not have glory, and have their honor shredded by the teeth of a dog. It is the opposite of what any Greek would want. That is what I am, and I accept it. I sigh as I touch the heads of one of my green mambas, she is named Nefeli, one of the prettiest snakes upon my head because her scales are gorgeous. She is one of my favorites, along with Kostas, because they wrap themselves around my neck to comfort me. The other snakes lick my face or wrap themselves around my arms when I am upset. They are precious things, whose venomous bites do not kill me. I guess even Athena can do something right. I hear the rocks shift and the familiar groan of a statue about to fall. There is no crash and I prepare myself for the foolish guest about to meet me. I will not make it easy on him, I do not plan to die quite yet. My name is Medusa and I am an ex-priestess. I was also a beautiful young woman before I was contaminated by Poseidon and cursed with a horrible appearance by Athena. I am feared due to my unique ability of turning mortals and minor deities into stone. I am a Gorgon, one of the three \"monsters\" who has this ability. One day I plan to go out and meet my \"sisters\" in this large world. I wish to know their stories, if they were a Gorgon by birth, or were they punished for a misdeed not under their control. I, a monster, turns to gaze at the mouth of the cave. I see a shadow while I hide behind one of the stalagmites towards the middle of my home. I might as well greet my guest and keep his sword. I can start on making a collection of swords, marking each and every person who comes into my home to kill me. It will serve as a reminder and motivation to seek out my \"sisters\" across this world. I do not pray that they are alive, but I know that they are alive. The world is cruel and I know that they are strong enough to survive it. I just need to collect a few swords and take a few of them to sell. I'll get enough money to travel to the lands they occupy and be among those similar to myself. However, those plans are for the future and I must focus on the present. I step into the light and I smile at the foolish mortal. He turns to stone immediately, his head whipping to the side where I deliberately scuffed my sandals on the cavern floor. His lips are parted slightly, in-taking a breath of surprise, and it will remain that way for all of eternity. At least until I decide I should break the statue. Another one added to my small collection around this mostly rocky island. My name is Medusa and I am a monster.",

    "text": "From the earth's dark embrace, they emerged into a world of blinding white. As far as the eyes could see, snow and ice draped upon the land, glistening under the grey sun and breathing chills into even the hearts of Gods. Seldom did they leave their kingdom behind. Rarer was the Queen's presence to grace the surface world in its wintry months. Perhaps it was to spare her heart, iron and steel as it was, of the devastation that was wrought in her absence. A gentle hand on her husband's wrist, slowing the chariot in its advance. Four black steeds trampled the snow, disturbing the stillness from which they ascended to. Elegant fingers gathered the pleats of her skirt, Persephone stepped down from Hades' side. She knew this meadow. She knew every tree, every bush, every sprig of grass that she and her nymph sisters danced by. She knew the lake, with its sweet water to cool their skin on a summer day. She knew wild patches of flowers, sprouting from the earth in abundance where her feet touched. If Persephone closed her eyes, she could hear bird songs filling the sky. She could hear faint skips of delicate hooves, a sudden splash of water, quiet flutterings and wayward laughters that made up the music of her youth. But all was swallowed in stark white grief, silenced in a way that even the Underworld was less lonely. Eyes that invoked the devotion and fear of those before them misted over. Persephone leaned against her husband's stoic presence, ever her looming shadow. \"In her sorrow, she has turned the realm under her care into which she hates most.\" Hades didn't answer, but followed as his wife tread forward. Persephone stopped when the toes of her winter boots touched frozen water. She kneeled, her dark fur cloak spilled around her like a blooming, macabre flower. No life could be coaxed out of the earth beneath. Demeter had cursed the land barren, to grieve and to die with her withered heart. And Persephone knew, not even the will of the Iron Queen could undo this devastation, lest she gave into her mother's demands. \"Frail are the mortals, but so is a God's pride.\" The snow shifted beside her. Persephone watched as Hades too kneeled, his long, pale fingers smoothed upon the ice. Where his skin touched, the surface was coaxed into transparency, like the truth that only death could offer. There, Persephone saw, in the murk of sand, mud and rocks, there was life. Slumbering catfish in their burrows, startling minnows lancing away from a lurking pike, and hovering asps in the far depths. Hades rose, and with him, the ice clouded over, shrouding away precious flickers of life. He helped Persephone to her feet, and immaculately adjusted the collar of her cloak. As if Hestia herself had kindled a hearth between them, Persephone could feel life thrumming under the very soles of her feet. Arid trees folded into themselves in hibernation, deep roots tangling in anticipation of Spring. Seeds lay dormant, kept warm and protected by Gaia, until Helios' first warm ray chased away the frost. Creatures huddled in their dens, plump and peaceful, waiting for colours to burst upon their world again. With a joyous chortle, Persephone flung herself into Hades' arms, impudent as if she was Kore once more. Her laughter didn't cease, even as he stumbled and they slid onto ice. The faintest hint of a smile graced his steely thin lips, and she grasped his hands, spinning them both in abandon. Life was beautiful, because it was temporal. And in the white waste Demeter cast upon the lands, there was death, but it was not the same eternity awaiting all in Persephone's kingdom. Here, death also held the same temporal preciousness, a halting of time that was both terrifying and fascinating. Here, they danced upon the cold white, finding joy upon the sorrow of one who cursed their union. The invitation to Olympus could wait, as the gilded columns and halls decorated in lies could never bring the same gratification as the simple truth of their joined hands. What were the Muses' songs to Persephone's tinkling laughter? What were Zeus' wandering eyes to the resolute gaze of Hades? Her glee was endless, even when they tripped. Ever so protective, he slotted himself beneath her, cushioning her fall as peals of giggles still fluttered from her lips. She curled into his arms, her mirth muffled in the cool skin of his neck. There was no question of her improper manners, no disapproval scowl. Not even a slight admonishment, but a gentle hand threading through her tumbling tresses, patient as her amusement died down into a gracious smile. \"It seems we are late, dear one.\" He hummed, the sound as deep and rich as the earth. As his namesake. \"My absence will not be missed, for I offer only truth, and truth is a dread that consumes the decadence of their egos.\" Persephone pouted, lips the colour of pomegranate. \"Must we go, then? If they detest you so and my departure will only bring more grief?\" Hades looked at her then, amusement flickering in endless obsidians. \"But wife, where is the fun in that?\" And she laughed again, above cruel winds and crueller Gods.",

    "text": "The screech owl swooped in and perched on the arm of Hades's throne. The owl made a sound, and Hades stiffened. He waved the owl away and stood, grabbing his staff. \"What? What happened?\" I asked, standing as well. \"A mortal has passed Charon.\" He muttered. \"What? How is that possible?\" Hades was about to reply when a sound caught my attention. I put a hand over his chest to stop him. He froze and glanced at me with his good eye, raising an eyebrow. I put a finger to my lips. Then I heard it. Music. It was singing and a lyre. I could not hear the words, but it was as if the song this man was singing was sorrow in itself. The sound of his voice filled me with a despair so strong that I fell back into my throne. Hades gripped his staff harder and sat back down, slowly. \"My lord! My lady!\" A servant ran in, waving his hands. \"A mortal, at the gates! He has tamed Cerberus and he will be here soon! He... he wishes to take his wife back to the realm of the living.\" The song grew louder and soon a man appeared in the doorway. He was nearly as beautiful as his voice: golden curls fell over green eyes and a fair face. Apollo's son, no doubt. He did not stop his song until he was before us, at our feet, and he knelt. \"Lord Hades, Lady Persephone, I come before you as a lover slighted. My heart longs for my wife, Eurydice. I appeal to you so I may bring her back to the realm of the living, where she belongs.\" The man says, and he weeps, tears flowing from his eyes though his voice is steady and strong. \"Stand, mortal,\" Hades says firmly. \"What is your name?\" \"Orpheus,\" he replies. Hades grimaces and I reach over to take his hand. The man's gaze shifts to me and his eyes are desperate. \"My lady, please...\" I sigh and shake my head. \"Orpheus, your wife is gone. The Moirai have deemed it her time. There is nothing to be done for her now.\" \"No, it was a mistake. We have just wed! I know it was not Eurydice's time.\" His gaze flickered hopelessly back and forth between my husband and I. I hated depriving a man of his wife, but mortals died and we could do nothing about that. \"I am sorry, we cannot--\" Orpheus cut Hades off. \"Wait! Please! Please, let me sing for you. Perhaps you will change your mind.\" Hades began to protest. \"We cannot--\" \"Wait,\" I squeezed Hades's hand. He looked to me, raising an eyebrow. I met his gaze, replying to Orpheus. \"We like music. Sing for us.\" Hades studied my eyes for a moment, his face unreadable. After a moment, he nodded, turning back to Orpheus. \"Sing,\" he permitted. I turned my attention to Orpheus as well. He picked up his lyre and began to play a tune so melancholy it made the room colder. When he began to sing, his voice was filled with a fresh, raw pain that I felt deep inside of me. He sang a song of his wife, Eurydice. They were madly in love, he sang for her, he played for her, he lived for her. They were newlyweds, the day after their wedding when she died. They had been eating together on a hill when a viper emerged and bit Eurydice. The poison killed her quickly and she died in Orpheus's arms. He sung of his journey to the Underworld, encouraged by his father, Apollo. I almost laughed then. It was just like my friend to suggest such a thing. Orpheus had persuaded Charon to ferry him across with his song. He sang it all the way to our gates, soothing Cerberus to sleep with a lullaby. Orpheus finished his song with his plea, his longing to reunite with his wife. He searched mine and Hades's face desperately. I had tears in my eyes. I turned to Hades. His face was guarded, but his eyes had softened. \"Get this man a room.\" He muttered. \"What?\" Rhadamanthys, one of our judges of the dead, who had been watching the scene, sputtered. \"Did I stutter?\" Hades replied, still looking at Orpheus. \"Get this man a room.\" \"Hades?\" I asked. \"We will make a decision tonight.\" He replied, finally moving his gaze from Orpheus to me. \"We need to discuss it.\" He waved Rhadamanthys to come forward. \"Now, find him a room in the wing adjacent ours. Do not feed him if he wishes to leave.\" Rhadamanthys took Orpheus by the arm and led him away. When we were alone, Hades stood. \"We have considerations to make.\" He took his staff and began to leave to our wing. I followed, tears still on my cheeks. Hades was always better at concealing his emotions than I. If it were possible inside the palace, I knew flowers would be blooming in my trail. \"Hades.\" I said, catching up to him. He did not reply. \"Hades!\" Hades stopped and turned to me. He took me by my shoulders and kissed my forehead, just above my diadem. \"When we get to our chambers, we will discuss it.\" He said quietly. I nodded, understanding. These were delicate matters. We could not discuss them in the corridors where those may hear. I took his hand, lacing our fingers as we walked. He was tense, even as we entered our chambers. He removed his cape and his crown, sitting heavily at the end of our bed. I removed my diadem and sat beside him. \"Hades, my love,\" I put my arm around his shoulders. \"My darling,\" he replied quietly. I laid my head on his shoulder. \"We must let her go.\" Hades chuckled shortly, sharply. \"Must we? Can we?\" \"Are we supposed to just leave this man to his grief?\" I asked, rubbing circles into his shoulder. \"Mortals die, Persephone. There is nothing we can do once they are dead.\" \"Hades, we can. This is our kingdom.\" Hades chuckled again, genuinely this time. \"My love, you know that is not how it works. We must abide by the laws of Fate, meaning we cannot spare mortals.\" \"Just once, Hades. You and I know full well what it is like to miss a lover. We know the longing. I thought you would sympathize as well. I know that being without you is like missing a part of myself.\" \"All mortals grieve, Persephone.\" \"But did you not hear his pain? Did you not feel it? Hades, please, I thought you would have understood him. They are in love. Can you not spare a fellow--\" \"Of course I understand!\" Hades exclaimed, standing suddenly. I stared, surprised. Hades rarely had a temper, he was always calm. It was always me. \"Hades..?\" I whispered. He gripped the edge of the table we had set our crowns on. He did not face me, but his shaking shoulders gave him away. I had seen my husband cry perhaps three times in centuries of marriage. It terrified me. \"Hades,\" I said again, standing. \"Hades, look at me.\" I put a hand on his shoulder and he stilled. Gently, I turned him to face me. He stared at the ceiling, refusing to meet my eyes with tears in his. I cupped his cheek and guided his face down so our gazes met. He gave no protest, meeting my gaze with his seeing eye--gold and glistening with tears. I brushed the tears from both his eyes and kissed him softly. I leaned my forehead against his. \"My love,\" I whispered. \"My darling,\" he replied, voice rough. \"My dearest, my one and only, my king, my everything,\" I said, watching a corner of his mouth turn up. It lowered again, a moment later, but it was enough for now. \"What is burdening you?\" \"You say I do not sympathize. I do, Persephone. Damn it all, I do.\" He sighed, \"I know longing stronger than anything. We are separated, you go to the overworld to your mother and your friends and your gardens. I stay here, alone.\" His voice grew more bitter as he spoke. \"Yet you say I do not understand.\" I frowned. \"I had never considered that.\" \"Of course you did not. You may miss me, but you are happy there. You are happy with your mother and your gardens, far grander than the one I can give you here. But I am always here, Persephone! Shunned by my brothers to this land of the dead. No one knows longing as I do.\" \"You know I miss you terribly.\" I say, searching his eye intensely. \"But you do not know the loneliness, Persephone. You do not know the isolation. I do not see the living for weeks on end! I stay here with the souls and their stories and their hate, longing for you.\" My own tears had reappeared. \"I am sorry, I did not think--\" \"No, do not apologize. There is nothing to be done.\" He took my hands from his face, lacing our fingers between us. \"I cannot bear your suffering.\" He smiled wryly. \"You do not bear it.\" I scoffed, \"Hades, you know what I mean. I cannot bear you suffering.\" Hades seemed less upset now, having gotten his words out. He brushed his lips against mine. \"I do not suffer when you are here. I do not suffer when I think of you.\" \"Do you wish for Orpheus to suffer as well?\" I whisper against his lips. Hades exhaled shakily. \"Persephone--\" \"I know you wish to help them.\" I pointed out. \"Of course I do. I know his pain, I felt it as rawly as my own. But I cannot simply free a soul. Atropos would have my head.\" I kiss him again, slow and gentle. I squeeze his hands. \"We must try. Surely there is a way.\" \"My darling...\" \"Hush, we will find a way.\" \"How?\" I smiled. \"Who kept my mother from taking me back? Who's idea was the pomegranate?\" Hades smiled as well. \"Mine,\" he replied. \"Then I firmly believe you will come up with another brilliant idea.\" \"And if I cannot?\" \"You will.\" I tugged at his hands and pulled him back to bed. He sat willingly now, letting me pull him back and wrap his arms around me. \"Tell me, what do you think when we are separated?\" \"Do you wish to make me cry again? I will not do it, Persephone.\" I laughed weakly. \"No, my love, we are discussing.\" I rubbed his back. \"Tell me. What is your first thought as Charon rows me away?\" He closes his eyes, sighing. \"Do not look back.\" \"What?\" \"I tell myself not to look back. I know that if I do, I will not be able to restrain myself. If I do, I will jump onto that boat myself and swim us back. I had to remind myself that you would be back, and I would manage until then.\" I smiled again, kissing his cheek. \"When have I last told you I love you?\" I felt his lips turn up and I pressed kisses across his face. \"It has been a dreadful few hours.\" \"Well I must tell you again: I love you, Hades.\" He presses his lips to mine for a long moment before he replies. \"I love you too, but we will not get any discussing done if you continue kissing me.\" \"Very well,\" I sighed wistfully, \"I will hold myself back.\" This drew a laugh from him. \"Only for now, my darling.\" \"Okay, well, we have 'do not look back.'\" Hades seemed to turn it over in his mind for a moment before his eyes lit up. I wished to immortalize the look of joy on his face, more precious than any jewel he had ever given me. \"An idea, my love?\" I asked. \"Yes, it may be... parlous but it will work. We can give them a chance.\" I woke up to an empty bed and footsteps, pacing. I sat up drowsily, seeing my husband, already fully dressed and pacing around the room. \"My love, my dearest, my one and only,\" I sighed, rubbing my eyes. Hades turned to look at me, surprised I was awake. \"Why are you already awake and dressed and pacing?\" \"We tell Orpheus our decision. I know we did what we could, but I do not wish to make this man his own demise.\" \"You say it is all we can do.\" \"It is!\" I sighed, sliding out of bed. \"Give me a moment to dress.\" I found a gown and donned my diadem once again. I walked barefoot in the palace, used to it from my life in the overworld. Now it was merely preference. I took Hades's hand. \"Come, my love, we have done what we can.\" We walked to the throne room hand in hand. As we entered, I saw Orpheus, forced to kneel by Minos. \"Minos!\" Hades called, snapping his fingers. \"Release him!\" Minos did so, grudgingly. Orpheus stood, head still bowed. \"Lord Hades, Lady Persephone, I hope you have considered my plea?\" \"We have.\" I answered, sitting with Hades on our thrones. \"And you have decided?\" Hades nodded, \"Persephone and I have made a decision to the most of our abilities. We have tried to do what we can, Orpheus.\" He waves Minos out of the room, leaving just us and Orpheus. \"We know the pain of longing for a lover.\" \"Hades knows, especially.\" I added. Hades nodded again, solemnly. \"I will have Hecate bring in your wife.\" Orpheus's face lit up. \"Eurydice?\" \"Yes,\" I answered, my heart aching for the man. \"We hope to let you return with her.\" He raised an eyebrow. \"You hope?\" Hades had sent for Hecate through a screech owl. I was spared from answering Orpheus as she walked in, the ghost of a girl in her awake. \"Orpheus,\" Hades said, drawing Orpheus's attention from desperately trying for glances of his wife. \"This is not often permitted. We had to make... choices. We cannot allow you to simply take Eurydice back.\" This gained Orpheus's full attention. \"What?\" \"It is against the laws of Fate to simply free a soul after Death has claimed it. Therefore, we have special terms.\" \"Anything,\" Orpheus breathed. \"You may take Eurydice back. But during your entire journey back to the overworld, you may not look back at Eurydice. Until the light of the overworld hits her and she is living again, you may not look back at her.\" \"B-But how will I know she is with me?\" \"Let your love and your faith in that love reassure you. If you can make it to the overworld with her, she is yours.\" Hades explained. I could tell he was fighting to keep an even expression. \"I will do it.\" Orpheus said, \"I will make it and I will take my wife back.\" Hades smiled slightly. \"Then go, Orpheus, son of Apollo. Go, and take your sorrows with you. I hope I will not see either of you for decades to come.\" It was a compliment from Hades, a wish for fair health and longevity, but Orpheus did not seem to understand it. Either way, he nodded and kneeled. \"Thank you for giving us a chance.\" They do not make it. Orpheus makes it just out and in his jubilation forgets that Eurydice must be hit with overwordly light. He turns, and watches her fade into shades again. He sings a new song, one of grief only. Eurydice returns and Hades weeps when he sees her. \"We did what we could.\" I whispered, even though I knew we should have tried harder. \"We gave all that we could and he still could not do it.\" Hades replies quietly, his head on my shoulder. \"I do not think we could have stopped it. Fate has a way. Eurydice was meant to stay here. But sometimes, Persephone, I cannot help but wonder...\" \"Neither can I,\" I agree. Orpheus's soul arrives a month later. He had tried to take his life multiple times but the world did not let him, refusing to lose his music. He was killed by Maenads, who were displeased by his despairing song. Orpheus is offered Elysium, but he refuses. He insists upon the Fields of Asphodel, to be reunited with his love. It appears Orpheus's song had a happy ending after all.",

      "\"How?\" I smiled.",
      "\"Who kept my mother from taking me back?",
      "Who's idea was the pomegranate?\" Hades smiled as well.",
      "\"Mine,\" he replied.",
      "\"Then I firmly believe you will come up with another brilliant idea.\"",
      "\"And if I cannot?\"",
      "\"You will.\"",

      "If I do, I will jump onto that boat myself and swim us back.",
      "I had to remind myself that you would be back, and I would manage until then.\"",
      "I smiled again, kissing his cheek.",
      "\"When have I last told you I love you?\" I felt his lips turn up and I pressed kisses across his face.",
      "\"It has been a dreadful few hours.\"",
      "\"Well I must tell you again: I love you, Hades.\"",
      "He presses his lips to mine for a long moment before he replies.",
      "\"I love you too, but we will not get any discussing done if you continue kissing me.\"",
      "\"Very well,\" I sighed wistfully, \"I will hold myself back.\"",
      "This drew a laugh from him.",
      "\"Only for now, my darling.\"",
      "\"Okay, well, we have 'do not look back.'\" Hades seemed to turn it over in his mind for a moment before his eyes lit up.",
      "I wished to immortalize the look of joy on his face, more precious than any jewel he had ever given me.",
      "\"An idea, my love?\" I asked.",
      "\"Yes, it may be... parlous but it will work.",
      "We can give them a chance.\"",
      "I woke up to an empty bed and footsteps, pacing.",
      "I sat up drowsily, seeing my husband, already fully dressed and pacing around the room.",

      "Hades turned to look at me, surprised I was awake.",
      "\"Why are you already awake and dressed and pacing?\"",
      "\"We tell Orpheus our decision.",
      "I know we did what we could, but I do not wish to make this man his own demise.\"",
      "\"You say it is all we can do.\"",
      "\"It is!\"",
      "I sighed, sliding out of bed.",
      "\"Give me a moment to dress.\"",
      "I found a gown and donned my diadem once again.",
      "I walked barefoot in the palace, used to it from my life in the overworld.",
      "Now it was merely preference.",
      "I took Hades's hand.",
      "\"Come, my love, we have done what we can.\"",
      "We walked to the throne room hand in hand.",
      "As we entered, I saw Orpheus, forced to kneel by Minos.",
      "\"Minos!\"",
      "Hades called, snapping his fingers.",
      "\"Release him!\"",
      "Minos did so, grudgingly.",
      "Orpheus stood, head still bowed.",
      "\"Lord Hades, Lady Persephone, I hope you have considered my plea?\"",
      "\"We have.\"",
      "I answered, sitting with Hades on our thrones.",
      "\"And you have decided?\" Hades nodded, \"Persephone and I have made a decision to the most of our abilities.",
      "We have tried to do what we can, Orpheus.\"",
      "He waves Minos out of the room, leaving just us and Orpheus.",
      "\"We know the pain of longing for a lover.\"",
      "\"Hades knows, especially.\"",

    "text": "Penelope Waits A short film CHARACTERS Penelope: beautiful woman in her late 20s Newscaster: disembodied announcer voice Young Telemachus: four-year-old boy Telemachus: eight-year-old boy Antinous: man in 20s Suitor 2: man in 20s or 30s Suitor 3: man in 30s Suitor 4: man in 30s Odysseus: athletic man in early 30s SCENE 1: in an expensive looking living room PENELOPE *flipping through channels watching TV* Boring...seen it...reality show...seen it...boring... *stops on news channel* NEWSCASTER This just in, Troy has fallen to the Greeks. In a clever ploy led by Captain Odysseus, the Trojans let a giant wooden horse filled with Greek soldiers into their camp. Troy is in ruins and it looks like our brave soldiers will be home soon. PENELOPE *jumps up and shrieks with joy, pumping her fists and dancing around* Yes! Oh, I knew it! I knew they could do it! YOUNG TELEMACHUS *stumbles into room clutching blanket and rubbing eyes* Mommy? PENELOPE *seizes YOUNG TELEMACUS in a hug and spins him around, making him laugh* He's coming home, baby. Your daddy's coming home! YOUNG TELEMACHUS *looks around, unsure* Daddy's coming home? PENELOPE Yes baby, he's coming home. He'll get to see how big you are in person! Won't it be nice to finally be able to see him? YOUNG TELEMACHUS *warming up to the idea* Then Mommy won't be sad anymore? PENELOPE *getting on her knees and putting a hand on YOUNG TELEMACHUS' shoulder* Mommy isn't sad, sweetheart. Mommy was just worried about Daddy. He hasn't been home since right before you were born. But he'll be home soon and we can be a family again. YOUNG TELEMACHUS *satisfied* Okay, Mommy. Can we have pizza? PENELOPE *smiles indulgently* Always thinking with your stomach, just like your father. Oh, I can't wait for you to meet him! Of course we can celebrate with pizza. Do you want olives on yours from our tree? YOUNG TELEMACHUS *makes disgusted face* No olives! Olives are yucky! PENELOPE Alright, no olives on your half. You'll learn to like them eventually. *hums happily to herself as she takes YOUNG TELEMACHUS' hand and swings it walking to the kitchen to pull out pizza ingredients* SCENE 2: in the living room PENELOPE *pacing with phone in her hand* ODYSSEUS *voice only, coming from phone* You've reached Odysseus. I can't answer the phone right now because I'm trying to win a war but I'll get back to you as soon as possible. *beeping noise* PENELOPE *nervously* Hey honey. I saw the news a few weeks ago but I still haven't heard from you. Is General Agamemnon debriefing you guys still? I would've thought you'd be home by now...We're starting to get worried. Telemachus really wants to see you...he keeps asking when you're going to be home...Anyway, call me back when you get this. Love you. Bye. *hangs up and paces some more, talking to herself* What is taking him so long? Is this how wars work? Do the men stay deployed even after it's supposed to be over? You'd think they'd at least be able to contact their families so they wouldn't have to worry! I haven't heard from him in over a month...He can't be dead though. They would have said something, sent a letter or men to my door. No, he can't be dead. I guess I'll just keep trying. *weeks pass and she is on the phone again, listening to ODYSSEUS' voicemail again, followed by a beep* *obviously frustrated* Odysseus, this is getting ridiculous. The war ended two months ago and I still haven't heard anything from you. Telemachus can't stop crying--he thinks you're dead! I know you aren't, I can feel it, but I'd appreciate at least a text message if you can't call. All the neighbors are starting to wonder if you went AWOL. Call me, okay? YOUNG TELEMACHUS *pops his head into the room* Was that Daddy? PENELOPE *trying and failing to be cheerful* It was his voicemail, anyway. How about we go play Legos? YOUNG TELEMACHUS *saddened* No, that's okay. I'll go watch a movie. *leaves room* PENELOPE *angry* Odysseus, where are you? SCENE 3: 2 years later, in a grocery store PENELOPE *pushing shopping cart with disinterested TELEMACHUS riding on the back of the cart* ANTINOUS *jogs up to PENELOPE* Heyyyy. Your husband was that big military guy, right? The one with the fancy house on the hill? PENELOPE *annoyed* Is. He is that big military guy. So? ANTINOUS So I figure since he's missing in action that you could use a night on the town. How about it? You, me, dinner? PENELOPE Thank you, but I'm married. I don't go on dates with other men. ANTINOUS Come on, he's been gone what, two years now? If he was going to come back, he already would have. You need to live a little. PENELOPE *cool anger* I said I'm not interested. If you'll excuse me, I have to finish my grocery shopping. *hurries out of the aisle leaving ANTINOUS dumbstruck* TELEMACHUS *fiddling with some candy he pulled from the shelf at checkout* Mom, who was that guy? PENELOPE Honestly, I have no clue. A gold-digger, most likely. TELEMACHUS What's a gold-digger? PENELOPE Someone who's only interested in your daddy's money. TELEMACHUS *looks troubled, fidgeting increases* Is Daddy really not coming back? PENELOPE *strained smile* Don't you listen to what anyone else says. He's coming back. He's been delayed somehow but he is coming back. I know he is. SCENE 4: One year later, in the living room TELEMACHUS *peering through blinds in front window* They're all camped out on the lawn. One has flowers and another has a fancy blue bag. *blinds snap back into place as he turns around* I think one of them is going to ring the doorbell. PENELOPE *grabs knitting supplies and spreads things out to make it look like she's been working for hours* I'm ready for him when he does. *doorbell rings* Telemachus, would you get the door? TELEMACHUS Sure, Mom. *opens door to reveal SUITOR 2; TELEMACHUS takes an aggressive stance* My mom's busy right now. Come back later. SUITOR 2 *arrogantly* I'm sure she's not too busy to see me. *muscles his way past TELEMACHUS, who sulks* Penelope! You look...busy. PENELOPE *sitting amid gigantic knitting supplies mess* I've been working on this for hours and have hardly gotten anywhere. SUITOR 2 What exactly are you working on? PENELOPE I'm knitting baby blankets for children in third world countries. Isn't that great? I haven't even finished the first one and I promised I would make fifty. SUITOR 2 Well it looks exhausting. How about you take a break and join me for dinner? I know a great place by the river, very romantic. PENELOPE *insincere sweetness* Oh, you know I'd love to but this project has taken over my life. I still have so much work to do. I won't be able to do anything fun until it's finished. Maybe another time? SUITOR 2 *crestfallen* Alright, if you're sure. But as soon as you're done we need to have dinner. *snatches a package of Oreos from TELEMACHUS on his way out* TELEMACHUS *complaining* Mom, he took my Oreos! Every time they come over they take my food like it's theirs. PENELOPE *weary sigh as she disentangles herself from yarn* I know, sweetheart and I'm sorry. But at least they do always leave. TELEMACHUS *flops onto the couch* What if they figure out it's a trick and refuse to leave? PENELOPE *looks out window at ANTINOUS, SUITOR 3, SUITOR, and SUITOR 4* Then I'll have to figure something else out. I'll cross that bridge if I come to it. For now, do you want to sneak out the back and go to the park? TELEMACHUS Okay. *belligerently* But we shouldn't have to sneak out of our own house. SCENE 5: in the living room PENELOPE *walks into room and sees TELEMACHUS holding a book* What have you got there? TELEMACHUS *embarrassed* I was just looking at pictures of Dad. PENELOPE *gets emotional and kneels by son on the floor, looking at wedding pictures* I really miss him. I wish you could get to know him. He's so smart and brave and everything I ever wanted in a husband. He would be a great father if he had the chance. TELEMACHUS *closes book, looks serious* Why do you think he hasn't come home? PENELOPE *sighs* He could be stranded on a desert island with no way to contact us for all I know but he's the most clever man I've ever met. No matter how lost he is, he'll find his way back to us. SUITOR 3 *voice heard through door after repetitive pounding* Penelope! I know you're in there, and you need out of that house! PENELOPE *momentary panic* Oh, why won't they leave me alone! Quick, hide the scrapbook. I'll get the knitting. *spreads knitting things out to make it look like she's been at it for hours* TELEMACHUS *answers door* Go away. My mom's working. SUITOR 3 Your mom works too much. *muscles his way in* Penelope, darling, I've come to whisk you away to the movies. You need a night off; you've been knitting nonstop for months! PENELOPE I'm still not finished. SUITOR 3 *demanding, annoyed posture* How much do you have left to do? If you were any kind of knitter you would have finished ages ago. PENELOPE My progress has been slow, I'm afraid. Knitting isn't my specialty but how could I refuse for such a good cause? These blankets are going to children who don't have a way to stay warm. Would you really deprive these children from warmth by taking me from my work? SUITOR 3 I suppose not, but you can't knit forever. You need some fun in your life! I know all kinds of fun things we could do together. PENELOPE Whatever you're planning will have to wait until I've finished these blankets. SUITOR 3 How many do you have left? PENELOPE *realizing she's already made most of them with defeat* Three. *quickly* But who knows how long those will take? Let's not set anything up until I'm done for sure. SUITOR 3 *weary* Alright, Penelope. I'll be back to check on your progress later. *grabs package of Skittles from TELEMACHUS on his way out* TELEMACHUS *whines* Moooooooom. PENELOPE I know, I know, he stole your food. Why these pigs think it's okay to steal food from a kid every time they come over, I'll never understand. I'll get you some more candy at the store. SCENE 6: at a park *SUITOR 4 is coming onto PENELOPE, who tries to stall him. TELEMACHUS is sitting on the swings when approached by ODYSSEUS in disguise* ODYSSEUS Hey kid, mind if I join you? TELEMACHUS *shrugs and pulls lollipop from his mouth* I guess not. You're not one of them, are you? ODYSSEUS *confused* One of who? TELEMACHUS Those guys who always bother my mom. They all want to marry her but she thinks they're dumb. ODYSSEUS *frowns* Where is your mom? TELEMACHUS *points to PENELOPE and SUITOR 4; PENELOPE looks distinctly uncomfortable* Over there with one of the dumb guys. They always steal my snacks when they come over. *suddenly worried* You don't think he'll steal my lollipop, do you? ODYSSEUS *suppressing anger* I don't think he'd take it since you've already licked it. You say your mom doesn't like any of those guys? TELEMACHUS *shakes head* No, she misses my dad too much. She says nobody will ever be as smart or as brave as him. She's waiting for him to come back from the war. *scrutinizes ODYSSEUS* You kind of look like him. I've seen pictures. ODYSSEUS *moment of internal conflict* Do you want to get rid of those guys? TELEMACHUS Yeah! They're all loud and mean and take my food. They don't seem to like me much. They camp out in the yard and never really leave. Mom always looks worried after they come over. She wants them to go away too. ODYSSEUS *conspiratorial* Can I tell you a secret, Telemachus? TELEMACHUS *suspicious* How do you know my name? ODYSSEUS Because I am your dad. I want those guys to stop bothering your mom too. Dear Penelope, she's been so patient. TELEMACHUS How do I know you're really him? You look like him but... ODYSSEUS I know a secret that only our family knows. There's an olive tree growing in the master bedroom. Your mom probably puts olives on pizza from that tree all the time. We did that a lot when she was pregnant with you. She was always craving olives. TELEMACHUS Okay, so maybe you are my dad. Mom says that the tree is the family secret so you must be family to know it. Let's go tell her! She'll be so excited! ODYSSEUS Hang on, sport. We need to get rid of those pesky suitors first. TELEMACHUS *eyes light up mischievously* How? ODYSSEUS I have a few ideas. Come on, kid. Let's show them who is boss around here. PENELOPE *finally shakes off SUITOR 4, approaches TELEMACHUS looking annoyed* Well now that that's over, we should head home. You have homework to do. TELEMACHUS Aww Mom, we haven't been here that long! I'm still talking to my new friend. PENELOPE *suspicious* New friend, huh? You're a little old to be hanging out at parks, aren't you? ODYSSEUS Just trying to be friendly, ma'am. I lost my only child years ago and never got to see him grow up. PENELOPE *still suspicious* Do you live around here? I haven't seen you around and I know almost everyone in this neighborhood. ODYSSEUS I used to live here. I moved away for many years but decided to come back. \"There's no place like home\" and all that. PENELOPE *progressively more suspicious* You know, you do remind me of someone. Maybe I have seen you before. *comes to conclusion that the stranger is ODYSSEUS* Say, why don't you join us for dinner this week? I'm having a dinner party with a bunch of friends and we're going to have a contest for fun. ODYSSEUS What kind of contest? PENELOPE Oh, you'll see. But it would take someone extremely clever to win it. Will we see you there? TELEMACHUS *makes pleading eyes* Please please please? We could do that thing we talked about. *exaggerated winking, being extremely obvious* ODYSSEUS Alright, I'll be there. When and where? PENELOPE *points* The big house on the hill at six on Saturday. We'll see you then. *smiles mysteriously and reaches for TELEMACHUS' hand* Come on, honey, you still have homework to do. You'll see your new friend later. TELEMACHUS *drawn out* Okay. *turns to ODYSSEUS* Make sure to be there! ODYSSEUS Kid, I wouldn't miss this for the world. *puts hands in pockets and walks off whistling* SCENE 7: in a fancy dining room *PENELOPE, TELEMACHUS, and all four suitors are seated at the table when the doorbell rings* TELEMACHUS *gets excited* I'll get it! ANTINOUS *annoyed* Who else did you invite? I thought this was going to be a celebration that you finally finished that humanitarian project so we could spend some time with you *mutters of agreement from other suitors* PENELOPE I've gathered you all here for a very special purpose, Antinous. You'll see shortly. TELEMACHUS *grinning* Look Mom, he came! I told you he'd come. PENELOPE *mysterious smile* I didn't doubt you, sweetheart. I figured he would. He has a stake in this contest. SUITOR 4 What's this about a contest? I thought we were just having dinner. PENELOPE I've decided that Odysseus has been gone long enough but I can't date just anyone. Whoever wins the contest is at least as skilled as he was so I'll date the winner. Simple as that. SUITOR 3 *amidst more murmuring, outrage* What? This is ridiculous! I bought you a Tiffany necklace! SUITOR 2 And I brought flowers and chocolates! PENELOPE *calmly* All very nice gestures. But I need someone with skills, hobbies, and interests that align with mine so gifts won't cut it. If you don't want to participate in the contest, you can leave. *more muttering but she continues* My husband was a skilled archer, you know. He was a runner up for the Olympic team ten years ago. Whoever manages to string his old bow and shoot an arrow through twelve axe heads will win. SUITOR 4 That's impossible! SUITOR 3 I still say this is ridiculous. ODYSSEUS I think it's a great idea. Whoever takes the place of such a great military hero should at least be able to fill his shoes. SUITOR 2 *muttering* No one asked your opinion. Who invited him anyway? TELEMACHUS I did! ANTINOUS *under his breath* I never liked that kid. *more loudly* Alright, Penelope, whatever you want. May the best man win! *SUITOR 2's arrow breaks a vase* *SUITOR 4's arrow goes through the window* *SUITOR 3's arrow almost hits TELEMACHUS, who dives for cover* *ANTINOUS' arrow narrowly misses ODYSSEUS* *ODYSSEUS successfully pulls off the trick* ANTINOUS *whining* That isn't fair! We've all wanted to date Penelope for years and this guy randomly shows up and beats us? He shouldn't have been allowed to participate in the first place! ODYSSEUS *casually leans against wall, twirling bow* Why are you all so intent on Penelope when she has a husband out there somewhere? Surely there are unmarried women in this town worth your notice. SUITOR 2 Yeah, but Penelope's the richest. SUITOR 3 Just look at this house! I live in a studio apartment. I'd kill for a house like this! PENELOPE *to TELEMACHUS, whom she is standing behind, hugging* I told you. Gold-diggers. ODYSSEUS So you hound this poor woman and steal her son's snacks for money? SUITOR 4 *shrugs* And because she's hot. ODYSSEUS I'd say you've more than worn out your welcome here. ANTINOUS *angry* Who are you to tell us what to do? There is no master of this house. That pipsqueak can't get rid of us any more than you can. TELEMACHUS *offended* Hey! PENELOPE *holds TELEMACHUS back* Shh. I want to see where this goes. ODYSSEUS *holding bow more menacingly* Just because the master of the house isn't here doesn't mean you should overrun it. ANTINOUS You can't tell me to leave. This isn't your house. I have just as much right to be here as you do. *other suitors nod in agreement* ODYSSEUS Actually, this is my house. I'll give you approximately ten seconds to get out before I demonstrate my archery skills on you. *mutters of the name \"Odysseus\" and \"it can't be\" from the suitors* ANTINOUS *laughs* Nice try, stranger. Odysseus is dead. He died in the war and never came back. ODYSSEUS On the way home my helicopter crashed, killing all of my men and leaving me marooned on an island. It's taken me a while to get home, I'll admit, but don't think I won't shoot. I did things in Troy that a pretty boy like you wouldn't believe. I'll say it once more. Get out. *other suitors scramble out the door in fear of their lives* ANTINOUS I don't think so. I've waited too long for Penelope to be foiled by some faux Odysseus. You get out. I'm taking this woman for drinks. ODYSSEUS *shrugs* Don't say I didn't warn you. *shoots Antinous in the shoulder* You might want to get to a hospital before you lose too much blood. ANTINOUS *clutching wounded arm and gasping* You're insane! ODYSSEUS War does that to you. Have a nice trip. ANTINOUS *stumbles out the door where one of the other suitors calls him an ambulance* PENELOPE *runs to ODYSSEUS and crushes him in a hug with tears in her eyes* I knew it was you, I just knew it! ODYSSEUS *stroking her hair* How did you know I was alive? PENELOPE I'm not sure. I just knew. I knew you would figure something out and find a way back to us. TELEMACHUS He knew about the olive tree, Mom. That's how I knew he was really Dad. ODYSSEUS *ruffles TELEMACHUS' hair* That's my boy. How about we have some olive pizza? PENELOPE *strangled happy laugh/cry noise* Oh, I've only dreamed of this. Making pizza with my whole family. TELEMACHUS I still don't like olives. ODYSSEUS *laughs and claps a hand on TELEMACHUS' shoulder as ambulance siren sounds outside* You'll learn to, son. *ODYSSEUS walks to kitchen with an arm around PENELOPE and an arm around TELEMACHUS* *happy chatter becomes indistinguishable as they walk farther away and the camera fades* THE END",

      "Let's go tell her!",
      "She'll be so excited!",
      "ODYSSEUS Hang on, sport.",
      "We need to get rid of those pesky suitors first.",
      "TELEMACHUS *eyes light up mischievously* How?",
      "ODYSSEUS I have a few ideas.",
      "Come on, kid.",
      "Let's show them who is boss around here.",
      "PENELOPE *finally shakes off SUITOR 4, approaches TELEMACHUS looking annoyed* Well now that that's over, we should head home.",
      "You have homework to do.",
      "TELEMACHUS Aww Mom, we haven't been here that long!",
      "I'm still talking to my new friend.",
      "PENELOPE *suspicious* New friend, huh?",
      "You're a little old to be hanging out at parks, aren't you?",
      "ODYSSEUS Just trying to be friendly, ma'am.",
      "I lost my only child years ago and never got to see him grow up.",
      "PENELOPE *still suspicious* Do you live around here?",
      "I haven't seen you around and I know almost everyone in this neighborhood.",
      "ODYSSEUS I used to live here.",
      "I moved away for many years but decided to come back.",
      "\"There's no place like home\" and all that.",
      "PENELOPE *progressively more suspicious* You know, you do remind me of someone.",
      "Maybe I have seen you before.",
      "*comes to conclusion that the stranger is ODYSSEUS* Say, why don't you join us for dinner this week?",
      "I'm having a dinner party with a bunch of friends and we're going to have a contest for fun.",
      "ODYSSEUS What kind of contest?",
      "PENELOPE Oh, you'll see.",
      "But it would take someone extremely clever to win it.",
      "Will we see you there?",
      "TELEMACHUS *makes pleading eyes* Please please please?",
      "We could do that thing we talked about.",
      "*exaggerated winking, being extremely obvious* ODYSSEUS Alright, I'll be there.",
      "When and where?",
      "PENELOPE *points* The big house on the hill at six on Saturday.",
      "We'll see you then.",
      "*smiles mysteriously and reaches for TELEMACHUS' hand* Come on, honey, you still have homework to do.",
      "You'll see your new friend later.",
      "TELEMACHUS *drawn out* Okay.",
      "*turns to ODYSSEUS* Make sure to be there!",
      "ODYSSEUS Kid, I wouldn't miss this for the world.",
      "*puts hands in pockets and walks off whistling* SCENE 7: in a fancy dining room *PENELOPE, TELEMACHUS, and all four suitors are seated at the table when the doorbell rings* TELEMACHUS *gets excited* I'll get it!",
      "ANTINOUS *annoyed* Who else did you invite?",
      "I thought this was going to be a celebration that you finally finished that humanitarian project so we could spend some time with you *mutters of agreement from other suitors* PENELOPE I've gathered you all here for a very special purpose, Antinous.",
      "You'll see shortly.",
      "TELEMACHUS *grinning* Look Mom, he came!",
      "I told you he'd come.",
      "PENELOPE *mysterious smile* I didn't doubt you, sweetheart.",
      "I figured he would.",
      "He has a stake in this contest.",
      "SUITOR 4 What's this about a contest?",
      "I thought we were just having dinner.",
      "PENELOPE I've decided that Odysseus has been gone long enough but I can't date just anyone.",
      "Whoever wins the contest is at least as skilled as he was so I'll date the winner.",
      "Simple as that.",
      "SUITOR 3 *amidst more murmuring, outrage* What?",
      "This is ridiculous!",
      "I bought you a Tiffany necklace!",
      "SUITOR 2 And I brought flowers and chocolates!",
      "PENELOPE *calmly* All very nice gestures.",
      "But I need someone with skills, hobbies, and interests that align with mine so gifts won't cut it.",
      "If you don't want to participate in the contest, you can leave.",
      "*more muttering but she continues* My husband was a skilled archer, you know.",
      "He was a runner up for the Olympic team ten years ago.",
      "Whoever manages to string his old bow and shoot an arrow through twelve axe heads will win.",
      "SUITOR 4 That's impossible!",
      "SUITOR 3 I still say this is ridiculous.",
      "ODYSSEUS I think it's a great idea.",
      "Whoever takes the place of such a great military hero should at least be able to fill his shoes.",
      "SUITOR 2 *muttering* No one asked your opinion.",
      "Who invited him anyway?",
      "TELEMACHUS I did!",
      "ANTINOUS *under his breath* I never liked that kid.",
      "*more loudly* Alright, Penelope, whatever you want.",
      "May the best man win!",
      "*SUITOR 2's arrow breaks a vase* *SUITOR 4's arrow goes through the window* *SUITOR 3's arrow almost hits TELEMACHUS, who dives for cover* *ANTINOUS' arrow narrowly misses ODYSSEUS* *ODYSSEUS successfully pulls off the trick* ANTINOUS *whining* That isn't fair!",
      "We've all wanted to date Penelope for years and this guy randomly shows up and beats us?",
      "He shouldn't have been allowed to participate in the first place!",
      "ODYSSEUS *casually leans against wall, twirling bow* Why are you all so intent on Penelope when she has a husband out there somewhere?",
      "Surely there are unmarried women in this town worth your notice.",
      "SUITOR 2 Yeah, but Penelope's the richest.",
      "SUITOR 3 Just look at this house!",
      "I live in a studio apartment.",
      "I'd kill for a house like this!",
      "PENELOPE *to TELEMACHUS, whom she is standing behind, hugging* I told you.",
      "Gold-diggers.",
      "ODYSSEUS So you hound this poor woman and steal her son's snacks for money?",
      "SUITOR 4 *shrugs* And because she's hot.",
      "ODYSSEUS I'd say you've more than worn out your welcome here.",
      "ANTINOUS *angry* Who are you to tell us what to do?",
      "There is no master of this house.",
      "That pipsqueak can't get rid of us any more than you can.",
      "TELEMACHUS *offended* Hey!",
      "PENELOPE *holds TELEMACHUS back* Shh.",
      "I want to see where this goes.",
      "ODYSSEUS *holding bow more menacingly* Just because the master of the house isn't here doesn't mean you should overrun it.",
      "ANTINOUS You can't tell me to leave.",
      "This isn't your house.",
      "I have just as much right to be here as you do.",
      "*other suitors nod in agreement* ODYSSEUS Actually, this is my house.",
      "I'll give you approximately ten seconds to get out before I demonstrate my archery skills on you.",
      "*mutters of the name \"Odysseus\" and \"it can't be\" from the suitors* ANTINOUS *laughs* Nice try, stranger.",
      "Odysseus is dead.",
      "He died in the war and never came back.",
      "ODYSSEUS On the way home my helicopter crashed, killing all of my men and leaving me marooned on an island.",
      "It's taken me a while to get home, I'll admit, but don't think I won't shoot.",
      "I did things in Troy that a pretty boy like you wouldn't believe.",
      "I'll say it once more.",
      "Get out.",
      "*other suitors scramble out the door in fear of their lives* ANTINOUS I don't think so.",
      "I've waited too long for Penelope to be foiled by some faux Odysseus.",
      "You get out.",
      "I'm taking this woman for drinks.",
      "ODYSSEUS *shrugs* Don't say I didn't warn you.",
      "*shoots Antinous in the shoulder* You might want to get to a hospital before you lose too much blood.",
      "ANTINOUS *clutching wounded arm and gasping* You're insane!",
      "ODYSSEUS War does that to you.",
      "Have a nice trip.",
      "ANTINOUS *stumbles out the door where one of the other suitors calls him an ambulance* PENELOPE *runs to ODYSSEUS and crushes him in a hug with tears in her eyes* I knew it was you, I just knew it!",
      "ODYSSEUS *stroking her hair* How did you know I was alive?",
      "PENELOPE I'm not sure.",
      "I just knew.",
      "I knew you would figure something out and find a way back to us.",
      "TELEMACHUS He knew about the olive tree, Mom.",
      "That's how I knew he was really Dad.",
      "ODYSSEUS *ruffles TELEMACHUS' hair* That's my boy.",
      "How about we have some olive pizza?",
      "PENELOPE *strangled happy laugh/cry noise* Oh, I've only dreamed of this.",
      "Making pizza with my whole family.",
      "TELEMACHUS I still don't like olives.",
      "ODYSSEUS *laughs and claps a hand on TELEMACHUS' shoulder as ambulance siren sounds outside* You'll learn to, son.",
      "*ODYSSEUS walks to kitchen with an arm around PENELOPE and an arm around TELEMACHUS*",
      "*happy chatter becomes indistinguishable as they walk farther away and the camera fades* THE END"

    "text": "One thing that both gods find entertaining is watching Icarus panic his way through his education. Students have always been the same, Apollo thinks: scrambling through practical exercises and tests of knowledge, bemoaning how much there is to know in such little time. To Icarus's credit, his enthusiasm for his field of study never flags. He always, always wants to know the secrets of the cosmos, to grasp how they turn, to work out a way to be the first human on the sun. His passion for astronomy stays strong - although his will to survive his studies, or life in general, seem to sputter constantly. Icarus is perpetually in a state of sleep-deprived misery. Stressed, anxious, and depressed all at once. Most of the time he keeps it at bay with his sarcasm, but sometimes... like now... Apollo is at Icarus's apartment, having just arrived after setting the sun for the day. Helios is already there, perched on top of the refrigerator, watching with raised eyebrows as Icarus goes through the throes of some kind of meltdown. It seems to be exam-related. He looks exhausted, as usual, and is grimly measuring out more coffee, clearly intending to force himself to stay awake longer. The boy always does this; always descends into a panic over minor things, lacking an immortal's sense of eventuality. It's particularly excessive since Icarus knows his material better than most of his classmates; it makes his insecurity and overreactions look comically ridiculous. The biggest real obstacle to his success in his studies, is his inability to care for himself properly. Apollo will insist he eat a real breakfast tomorrow. For now, though he doesn't even greet the boy before he steps over to him, holding up a hand. \"Heed my words...\" he begins. Helios looks over at him, sharply. \"...and fall asleep. Be at peace,\" Apollo finishes. He quickly puts an arm out and catches Icarus as the boy sags, eyes closing, coffee and spoon dropping to the countertop. Apollo gathers Icarus up; the boy slumbers on. His eyelids are colored a deep purple with exhaustion. Apollo shakes his head, tutting. \"I'm putting him in his bed. I don't expect him to wake for at least ten hours. You don't need to stay around,\" Apollo tells Helios. \"Ha! Like I'm gonna let you cheat your way to first place, you cheating shit!\" Helios snorts derisively. He hops down off the refrigerator and scampers ahead of them, flinging himself into Icarus's bed and adopting a suggestive position and leering. \"Toss him over here!\" Apollo gives him a withering stare and eases Icarus onto the bed, taking a moment to tug off his shoes and setting them neatly on a nearby chair. He leans over to tuck Icarus's hair out of his face. The boy shifts slightly, still deeply asleep, and half-turns towards Helios, grasping his arm. Helios almost has enough time to compose his face into an expression of smug triumph, but at nearly the same moment, Icarus reaches out for Apollo as well, pulling him closer. Pulling him by the hair, in fact. Icarus's fingers are latched around the nearest coil of Apollo's hair and yanking, not particularly gently, pulling Apollo's face in close. Helios' face goes through the expressions of startled, annoyed, and amused in rapid succession. \"Well, that's that. Guess you better climb in too.\" \"It seems the decision's been made for me,\" Apollo agrees, trying to fight a happy blush from his face as he disentangles his hair from Icarus's grip. He lays himself down next to the two of them, dismissing his clothing with a thought. Icarus audibly sighs in his sleep, wriggling a little as the heat from two sun gods washes over him from either side, warming his bed. Apollo and Helios have each taken one of his hands in one of theirs, touching over the center of the human's chest, over the beating heart. \"This kid's greedy,\" Helios observes fondly. \"A two-god sort of guy. Couldn't be satisfied with just one or the other.\" \"Well, it's as we've seen. Icarus is not lacking in ambition.\" Helios snorts again and for the next eight hours, forty-two minutes and fourteen seconds, they say and do nothing more. They only watch their human sleep. It is not a spectacularly interesting show. Icarus is out; traces of Apollo's curse still weaving about his skull, keeping him quiet and still, though he occasionally stirs and reaches a hand out, apparently to satisfy his unconscious self that the gods are still there. After a while, Apollo discovers that blowing gently on Icarus's neck - the same place where Helios was kissing him to such great effect earlier - causes the boy's fingers to twitch and his lips to part. The gods give each other a knowing look over the top of Icarus's head, filing the knowledge away for later when they can use it to maximum mischief. And then, without quite realizing he's doing it, Apollo is leaning forward to meet Helios's lips in a gentle kiss, shared over their sleeping mortal. They smile at each other genuinely for a brief moment, before Helios grins. \"Nice! Just the right amount of tongue. All-around good kiss!\" \"Now you're not going to get another one for two decades,\" Apollo tells him, rolling his eyes. \"Whatever. You won't be able to keep lips off of me now that you've been reminded what a great kisser I am,\" Helios scoffs smugly. Apollo's lips twitch in a smirk. \"Eos was better.\" The familiar glare graces Helios's face. \"So it's like that, eh? Fine. I'll just give Artemis a smooch and compare your technique.\" \"Pfft. She'd kick your ass into next week.\" Their squabbling eventually gets lively enough to overcome even the sleep curse, and Icarus awakens, hair mussed and eyes still half-closed. He grouchily and groggily throwing in his two cents even while rubbing his eyes, adding to the argument before he even knows what it's about. The sun rises late that day.",

    "text": "When Apollo kisses Icarus for the first time, it's a gentle kiss on the cheek, given without actually thinking of the competition. Icarus has been talking about his latest passion, calculating the lifetime of the sun. It's a calculation a little beyond him, something he would encounter later in his studies, but he's interested now, and has made an effort to figure it out ahead of schedule. Neither Helios nor Apollo offer insight of their own, though neither can hide a smile. Icarus seems to be in some form of denial about the sun gods in his apartment - this is true on any given day. He usually just ignores it: the closest Apollo has seen him directly acknowledge their identities, is to argue that they only do stuff with the sun, not that they are the sun, or control it. Apollo's seen it many times before, and no longer takes offense. It's a mortal inability to fully comprehend the scale of gods, or of so many things beyond their scope. In any case, it's sweet how much Icarus cares about this. The grouchy demeanor falls away from his face as he explains the unnecessarily complicated math, the physics, radioactive dating. Icarus's whole body lights up as he talks, hands gesturing excitedly, animated like Apollo's never seen before. He's burning with a curiosity to understand, to learn. Apollo thinks, yes, this is worth Prometheus's sin, that humans should want to do math to find out how old the sun is, and when Icarus pauses in his explanation, Apollo leans over and presses a kiss to his face. It's less showy than Helios' kisses, and less sensual than Apollo's own usual efforts, but he earns a blush and an awkward, shy smile from Icarus. Helios had long lost interest in the math conversation and perks up at this. \"What? You're giving out kisses?! Gimme one too!\" Greedy Titan. \"You got one last decade, it's enough.\"",

    "text": "Apollo learns, from receiving a smug text, that Helios has taken Icarus on a joyride through the space between realms - giving the boy a little thrill as they tore through the inky void on his golden chariot (in the noisy motorcyclical form it takes these days). Presumably, Helios got a snuggle out of it as well, if Icarus was holding onto the god as they flew. This will not stand. Apollo arrives promptly at Icarus' apartment the next day, after the mortal has completed his classes and returned. The boy has enough time to place his heavy book satchel on the table and when he looks up, Apollo is standing there, next to him. Icarus yelps and squirms away in an amusingly unmanly fashion, but Apollo is not here to wind him up today. \"You're looking pale, Icarus. I've told you before that you lock yourself away indoors too much,\" Apollo tells him, disapproval in his voice. He takes Icarus's arm, firmly, and pulls him back towards the door to his apartment. \"H-hey, wait-!\" \"Your Vitamin D levels are dangerously low. It will begin affecting your health negatively soon. It's because you avoid sunlight,\" Apollo lectures. \"We're going to correct this.\" \"Wait. You're saying...\" Icarus gives him a flat, disbelieving look as Apollo pulls him through the door. \"You're the sunlight. You're giving me the D?\" Apollo pauses, closing the door behind them, and looks over at Icarus, and smirks. \"Yes. I'm giving you the D.\" Icarus sighs noisily - but Apollo is pleased to note his cheeks have colored a little. \"You - can't just say that-!\" Icarus sputters, but Apollo has already turned and begun pulling him down the steps and toward his own chariot, where it's parked by the side of the road. \"This is your car?\" Icarus looks doubtfully at the golden Prius. \"Yes. It's one of the safest vehicles available, and sensible, as well as stylish.\" Apollo lets them in and waits until Icarus has buckled his safety belt before he pulls away from the curb and into the Space Between Worlds. He doesn't bother trying to impress Icarus with the view in the heavenly realm - Helios has already beaten him to that. Yet, in spite of the fact that he's seen it once before, Icarus still seems fascinated with the view outside the Prius's windows. He peers out, nervous but curious, asking if those are the same constellations he can see from earth. Apollo confirms that they are, though viewed from the other side. They pass an empty space near Lyra, and Apollo wonders to himself if Icarus' corpse would look pretty, turned into stars, someday. When the mortal died. Apollo thinks the mortal would make a fetching constellation, but finds he isn't looking forward to it. Apollo uses his turn signal and exits the void, pulling out onto a pristine beach of high, rocky cliffs edged in white sand and achingly bluegreen waters. Icarus is suitably impressed. He steps out of the car, looking around. \"Oh... this place is gorgeous...! Where are we?\" \"Galifos. In Greece.\" He pronounces both names with the original accent; something he knows is a secret turn-on for the mortal. As hoped, a faint spot of color appears in both cheeks of Icarus's face, but he's too entranced with the view to do more than stare, openmouthed, at his surroundings. \"It's incredible. I - hey?!\" Icarus has apparently just noticed Apollo's clothes are missing. The spots of red spread wildly over his entire face and neck, and he whips around abruptly, hiding his eyes like the shy child he sometimes is. \"It's a nude beach, Icarus.\" Apollo has had many centuries to become accustomed to the shifting concepts of modesty, as regards nudity; but doesn't always bother to apply them to himself. He strides past Icarus, only slowing to muss his hair and otherwise doesn't comment on how endearingly idiotic the human looks. \"You'll need to strip off if you want to join me. And you should. You need as much D as your body can take.\" \"There's no way you don't know what that sounds like,\" Icarus mutters after him, mutinously. Apollo stretches out on the warm sand, already feeling better for being here, in the open, no other people around but him and Icarus, and the pristine waters and the bright sun in the sky. It takes Icarus a few minutes to summon his courage to walk over and join him, and he drops ungracefully down onto the sand, still looking embarrassed and annoyed. He's still mostly-clothed - but he's removed his shirt, anyway, and his shoes and socks. Apollo's mildly disappointed, but accepts the compromise. \"I'm not going in the water,\" Icarus says, sounding nervous but firm. Ah, yes. He'd drowned, before. Evidently some things stay etched in the psyche. \"Of course.\" They watch the gulls wheel over the sea, crying out at each other over the sounds of the waves crashing \"Nice, isn't it,\" Apollo comments. After a moment, Icarus agrees. \"Yeah, this place is cool,\" he says, looking out at the water. Aside from being too pale, and a little too skinny by Apollo's standards, and the messy haircut, Icarus's body is pleasing. Apollo is pleased to see the small signs of the somatosensory stimuli affecting it - the grains of sand, the breeze, the warm sun.",

    "text": "The golden hero Odysseus woke up gently. The Phaeacian crew stared at him openly, but he was quite used to it by now. Being a long-lost hero has its high points, and it's low ones, and Odysseus can't decide if the fame was a high one or a low one. The rocking of the waves that had become almost like a second heartbeat to him had slowed to a light rhythm. Sitting up, Odysseus took stock of his surroundings lazily. He didn't recognize anything around him, and panic seized his chest. Sitting up fully, he called, \"Guys, where are we?\" The Phaeacians glanced at him, unimpressed, and herded him off the boat after impatiently explaining that they're on Ithaca. Traipsing through the forest, Odysseus eventually started to see signs of his home. The tree he climbed for a rare apple, just to see it sacrificed to Aphrodite. The fountain where his arrow landed, earning him ten drachmas from Iobates. The shop he got his first sword from, all passing landmarks on his way home. Home. The concept is foreign, yet so completely right. After twenty years of suffering, he'll finally get to go home. --- In the last stretch of forest that lays between his house, the trees suddenly grew quiet, and the air filled with the calming smell of books and paper he's grown to associate with Athena. Spinning around, he finds the goddess lounging on a fallen tree trunk, eyes trained on a scroll rather leisurely. The faint curl of her lips suggested the gray-eyed goddess wasn't really reading, but studying him. Odysseus dropped his head politely, as ogling a virgin goddess could have fatal repercussions, and he wasn't looking to end up like Actaeon. The tan of her skin is tawny, a golden-brown, so unlike the Grecian beauty standards of pale and fair, that truly, Athena doesn't look Grecian at all, rather like a people he's only heard of in stories, in a southern land on the supposed other side of the world. Odysseus thinks that's bigger bull than the cows his men died to eat. Athena set the scroll down. \"Well, Odysseus. It seems you've made it this far. Congratulations.\" \"Thank you,\" he murmured. \"You have two options,\" she continued regally. \"You can disguise yourself as a beggar and wait weeks until you kill the suitors, or you could do the smart thing and go kill them now.\" Odysseus furrowed his eyebrows, looking up. \"Why would I disguise myself?\" Athena's gray eyes filled with immortal amusement, as if to say, what a cute human. A shame they live so short. \"I have not the faintest idea,\" she chuckled. When Odysseus just stared at her, she gave a little wave with her hands. \"Go on, then. Peace be with you, and all that jazz.\" And with that, she disappeared. Odysseus stared at the place she had been, then swiveled firmly, exasperated with gods, and marched the last few miles to his house. As he got closer, he noticed a very prevalent aura of wrong. The door of his house was laying at a very unnatural angle, off of its hinges. Abandoned swords were scattered along the courtyard, and silence pressed into his chest. Walking inside, Odysseus surveyed the damage, mildly impressed. The carnage wasn't near anything he'd seen during the war or on the journey back, but it was certainly destructive. Bodies, barely recognizable, lay strewn along the floors, most of them sporting stab wounds. Odysseus knelt to feel one. It was still warm. Someone cleared their throat from the shadows. There, amidst all the blood and death, sat a lone figure on an upturned barrel. Odysseus drew his sword, cautious. \"What is this?\" he asked quietly. The figure looked up and chuckled lowly. \"What,\" they said bitterly. \"You don't recognize your own son?\" Odysseus gasped and dropped his sword. \"T-Telemachus?\" Telemachus had grown now, far bigger than the infant Odysseus had left behind. Blonde hair underlaid with black shone under the candlelight, and hard, strapping muscle bulge under the straps of his tunic. The young man now glared at his father hatefully. \"Don't call me that,\" he growled. \" Twenty years you've been gone, Odysseus. You should've stayed missing.\" Recovering from the shock, Odysseus warned, \"I'm your father, Telemachus. Speak with respect.\" \"Too little, too late, Dad.\" On the last word, Telemachus stood and hurled a golden knife at the god-like hero. Only instinct saved him from death, but the dagger pierced Odysseus' side, and he crumpled to the ground with an agonised scream. Telemachus knelt beside his father. He bent to whisper in Odysseus' ear, \"The only reason you're still alive, is my mother. For the rest of your miserable life, remember that. Twenty years, for Apollo's sake.\" Telemachus hailed two servants, and they lugged Odysseus up the stairs into Penelope's private chamber. Penelope sat on her throne, as queen of Ithaca, undoing her step-father's shroud. Her eyes flickered up to the ensemble that enters her room. If she felt an emotion when her husband was carried in half-dead and moaning deliriously, she doesn't show it. Odysseus suddenly recalled Agamemnon's bitter warning about women, and wished dearly that he had listened. \"Odysseus,\" she murmured, voice unpleased. The servants set him down on the floor, and he craned his head awkwardly to gaze up at his wife. Her black, straight hair fell in glossy waves, and angular eyes gazed at him dispassionately. The servants left the room silently, but Telemachus crossed the room to stand beside his mother's throne, where he watched with muted fury in his eyes. The god-like hero's side throbbed and spilled red liquid. \"Penelope,\" Odysseus gasped, \"please, help me, I swear by the gods-\" \"Quiet,\" she ordered. It was no louder than her normal tone, but the word echoed around the room like she had shouted. Odysseus's mouth clacked shut. When she began to talk, the words fell like lashes on his back. \"My husband, Odysseus. Gods, do you know how much I cried for you? How I died a bit, every day? How I longed for my husband to return from the war? I begged Aphrodite to harden my heart. I begged Artemis to shoot and kill me. I begged Hestia to swallow me in her flames, for Tyche to let me fall upon misfortune. \"But that was the first year. I stopped crying by the second, stopped missing you by the fifth. It's been twenty years, Odysseus. That's longer than our marriage! You can't possibly expect me to stay here and play the part of patient, faithful wife forever? So,\" Penelope said, words flying from her mouth like hornets, \"I had my son, Telemachus finally kill those wretched suitors this morning. Fitting that you'd show up now,\" she sniffed. She handed the unfinished shroud off to Telemachus, who scowled and draped it over his father, and wrapped it tightly so Odysseus couldn't move. \"But no matter,\" Penelope continued, smiling coldly. \"I no longer require your services, and I find I'm quite done moping. I'm glad I got to share this angry monologue with you. My therapist says I'm emotionally constipated. There is someone I'd like you to meet, however.\" A thin, dark-skinned stranger with her dark hair half shaved off strode into the room. Dressed in a typical chiton, she stood near Penelope, who then crushed her in a kiss. Odysseus struggled against the suffocating shroud. Black spots gathered in his vision. \"This is Aja,\" Penelope introduced, grinning proudly. \"She's my wife, and a daughter of Athena.\" Aja gazed at him as if he were a lowly servant, not worth and iota of her time. Odysseus suspected he would've found it ironic, that a daughter of Athena married his wife while her mother had assisted him all this while, if he wasn't dying. \"I've moved on, Odysseus. Can you truthfully say you have stayed faithful to me, husband, these long years? If you can,\" Penelope said, with a golden aura surrounding her that showed the blessing of some traitor heavenly host, \"I'll let you live. Can you say that, husband?\" Odysseus hesitated, only for a second, but enough for Penelope. \"That's too bad,\" she said. Coolly, she motioned to Telemachus and Aja, who both nodded. His son pressed down harder on the shroud, blocking off his air supply, while Aja, the stranger woman, grabbed Penelope's needle. His ex wife's wife knelt by him, and stabbed him in one eye with the needle. Fresh, hot pain rolled down Odysseus' spine. Blood filled his airway. Odysseus choked his last breath in, staring at his old family as they sneered at his body. Then he saw no more. --- Odysseus awoke to the sloshing sound of water first. The rocking of the waves. The sky was dark and unnatural. The next thing he noticed was that he didn't have a boat. Panicking, Odysseus swam hard. He spotted a tiny island about a half mile off. When he got within feet of the island, a man appeared on the beach. Dark black hair and sea-green eyes seethed at him. Poseidon and Odysseus faced off. Poseidon broke the silence first. \"Odysseus, you've made a lot of people angry. My pathetic little brother Zeus protected your mortal life, but your afterlife was up for grabs. I found this a suitable punishment, and the rest are inclined to agree.\" \"What? Who else?\" Odysseus shouted over the crashing tide. Seaweed tangled in his feet and salt caked in his creases. Poseidon simply shimmered and disappeared into sea foam. In the spot he had been, Calypso suddenly glared at him, enraged. Her wild black curls stuck up randomly, and her chocolate skin shone with an unnatural pallor. Then Calypso was gone and Circe fumed in her place, and sparks flew off of her light brown skin. She shimmered away and the blinded Cyclops hissed and cursed at him. Then all was quiet. Odysseus broke for the beach. As soon as he made it to the shore, an invisible hand pushed him back to the start. Odysseus tried again. And again. And again. Until the end of eternity.",

      "Odysseus stared at the place she had been, then swiveled firmly, exasperated with gods, and marched the last few miles to his house.",
      "As he got closer, he noticed a very prevalent aura of wrong.",
      "The door of his house was laying at a very unnatural angle, off of its hinges.",
      "Abandoned swords were scattered along the courtyard, and silence pressed into his chest.",
      "Walking inside, Odysseus surveyed the damage, mildly impressed.",
      "The carnage wasn't near anything he'd seen during the war or on the journey back, but it was certainly destructive.",
      "Bodies, barely recognizable, lay strewn along the floors, most of them sporting stab wounds.",
      "Odysseus knelt to feel one.",
      "It was still warm.",
      "Someone cleared their throat from the shadows.",
      "There, amidst all the blood and death, sat a lone figure on an upturned barrel.",
      "Odysseus drew his sword, cautious.",
      "\"What is this?\" he asked quietly.",
      "The figure looked up and chuckled lowly.",
      "\"What,\" they said bitterly.",
      "\"You don't recognize your own son?\"",
      "Odysseus gasped and dropped his sword.",
      "\"T-Telemachus?\" Telemachus had grown now, far bigger than the infant Odysseus had left behind.",
      "Blonde hair underlaid with black shone under the candlelight, and hard, strapping muscle bulge under the straps of his tunic.",
      "The young man now glared at his father hatefully.",
      "\"Don't call me that,\" he growled. \"",
      "Twenty years you've been gone, Odysseus.",
      "You should've stayed missing.\"",
      "Recovering from the shock, Odysseus warned, \"I'm your father, Telemachus.",
      "Speak with respect.\"",
      "\"Too little, too late, Dad.\"",
      "On the last word, Telemachus stood and hurled a golden knife at the god-like hero.",
      "Only instinct saved him from death, but the dagger pierced Odysseus' side, and he crumpled to the ground with an agonised scream.",
      "Telemachus knelt beside his father.",
      "He bent to whisper in Odysseus' ear, \"The only reason you're still alive, is my mother.",
      "For the rest of your miserable life, remember that.",
      "Twenty years, for Apollo's sake.\"",
      "Telemachus hailed two servants, and they lugged Odysseus up the stairs into Penelope's private chamber.",
      "Penelope sat on her throne, as queen of Ithaca, undoing her step-father's shroud.",
      "Her eyes flickered up to the ensemble that enters her room.",
      "If she felt an emotion when her husband was carried in half-dead and moaning deliriously, she doesn't show it.",
      "Odysseus suddenly recalled Agamemnon's bitter warning about women, and wished dearly that he had listened.",
      "\"Odysseus,\" she murmured, voice unpleased.",
      "The servants set him down on the floor, and he craned his head awkwardly to gaze up at his wife.",
      "Her black, straight hair fell in glossy waves, and angular eyes gazed at him dispassionately.",
      "The servants left the room silently, but Telemachus crossed the room to stand beside his mother's throne, where he watched with muted fury in his eyes.",
      "The god-like hero's side throbbed and spilled red liquid.",
      "\"Penelope,\" Odysseus gasped, \"please, help me, I swear by the gods-\" \"Quiet,\" she ordered.",
      "It was no louder than her normal tone, but the word echoed around the room like she had shouted.",
      "Odysseus's mouth clacked shut.",
      "When she began to talk, the words fell like lashes on his back.",
      "\"My husband, Odysseus.",
      "Gods, do you know how much I cried for you?",
      "How I died a bit, every day?",
      "How I longed for my husband to return from the war?",
      "I begged Aphrodite to harden my heart.",
      "I begged Artemis to shoot and kill me.",
      "I begged Hestia to swallow me in her flames, for Tyche to let me fall upon misfortune.",
      "\"But that was the first year.",
      "I stopped crying by the second, stopped missing you by the fifth.",
      "It's been twenty years, Odysseus.",
      "That's longer than our marriage!",
      "You can't possibly expect me to stay here and play the part of patient, faithful wife forever?",
      "So,\" Penelope said, words flying from her mouth like hornets, \"I had my son, Telemachus finally kill those wretched suitors this morning.",
      "Fitting that you'd show up now,\" she sniffed.",
      "She handed the unfinished shroud off to Telemachus, who scowled and draped it over his father, and wrapped it tightly so Odysseus couldn't move.",
      "\"But no matter,\" Penelope continued, smiling coldly.",
      "\"I no longer require your services, and I find I'm quite done moping.",
      "I'm glad I got to share this angry monologue with you.",
      "My therapist says I'm emotionally constipated.",
      "There is someone I'd like you to meet, however.\"",
      "A thin, dark-skinned stranger with her dark hair half shaved off strode into the room.",
      "Dressed in a typical chiton, she stood near Penelope, who then crushed her in a kiss.",
      "Odysseus struggled against the suffocating shroud.",
      "Black spots gathered in his vision.",
      "\"This is Aja,\" Penelope introduced, grinning proudly.",
      "\"She's my wife, and a daughter of Athena.\"",
      "Aja gazed at him as if he were a lowly servant, not worth and iota of her time.",
      "Odysseus suspected he would've found it ironic, that a daughter of Athena married his wife while her mother had assisted him all this while, if he wasn't dying.",
      "\"I've moved on, Odysseus.",
      "Can you truthfully say you have stayed faithful to me, husband, these long years?",
      "If you can,\" Penelope said, with a golden aura surrounding her that showed the blessing of some traitor heavenly host, \"I'll let you live.",
      "Can you say that, husband?\" Odysseus hesitated, only for a second, but enough for Penelope.",
      "\"That's too bad,\" she said.",
      "Coolly, she motioned to Telemachus and Aja, who both nodded.",
      "His son pressed down harder on the shroud, blocking off his air supply, while Aja, the stranger woman, grabbed Penelope's needle.",
      "His ex wife's wife knelt by him, and stabbed him in one eye with the needle.",
      "Fresh, hot pain rolled down Odysseus' spine.",
      "Blood filled his airway.",
      "Odysseus choked his last breath in, staring at his old family as they sneered at his body.",
      "Then he saw no more.",
      "--- Odysseus awoke to the sloshing sound of water first.",
      "The rocking of the waves.",
      "The sky was dark and unnatural.",
      "The next thing he noticed was that he didn't have a boat.",
      "Panicking, Odysseus swam hard.",
      "He spotted a tiny island about a half mile off.",
      "When he got within feet of the island, a man appeared on the beach.",
      "Dark black hair and sea-green eyes seethed at him.",
      "Poseidon and Odysseus faced off.",
      "Poseidon broke the silence first.",
      "\"Odysseus, you've made a lot of people angry.",
      "My pathetic little brother Zeus protected your mortal life, but your afterlife was up for grabs.",
      "I found this a suitable punishment, and the rest are inclined to agree.\"",
      "\"What?",
      "Who else?\" Odysseus shouted over the crashing tide.",
      "Seaweed tangled in his feet and salt caked in his creases.",
      "Poseidon simply shimmered and disappeared into sea foam.",
      "In the spot he had been, Calypso suddenly glared at him, enraged.",
      "Her wild black curls stuck up randomly, and her chocolate skin shone with an unnatural pallor.",
      "Then Calypso was gone and Circe fumed in her place, and sparks flew off of her light brown skin.",
      "She shimmered away and the blinded Cyclops hissed and cursed at him.",
      "Then all was quiet.",
      "Odysseus broke for the beach.",
      "As soon as he made it to the shore, an invisible hand pushed him back to the start.",
      "Odysseus tried again.",
      "And again.",
      "And again.",
      "Until the end of eternity."

    "text": "The light from somewhere far above on Olympus was fading to a cool twilight. Helios's sun setting somewhere long below the horizon. It was getting late, and Apollo figured it was just about time to pack up. He could claim he and Hermes were training all day, but as a god of truth that didn't sit well with him. The truth was they were mostly just fooling off. Overdramatic games of tag and the occasional challenge of honor. Typical training. Apollo lowered his sword. He had never been great with swords, not as good as Athena at least, but that didn't matter with Hermes. The youngest Olympian was just learning and took little skill to defeat. But he was picking up skills quickly, and Apollo couldn't have been more proud. Hermes was panting as he lowered the small sword in his hand. Apollo smiled at him. \"You did great Hermes!\" Hermes was positively beaming at the praise. \"You've gotten so much better, you almost landed a few hits on me!\" Apollo leaned down, ruffling his hair. \"I'm proud of you.\" \"I did get you!\" Hermes protested, ducking away from Apollo's hand. \"Oh? Are you sure?\" Apollo filled his voice with mock fear. \"You've surely gotten stronger then. One day you might even be able to defeat me.\" \"I can defeat you now!\" Hermes insisted. \"I just don't because I don't want to hurt you!\" \"You sure about that?\" \"Yes!\" \"Well then, I'd better watch my back next time we spar, my baby brother might just defeat me. What would that do to my reputation?\"Hermes burst into a fit of giggles, which was cut off with a yawn. \"Let's get you home. Your mother is sure to be worried by now.\" \"No.\" \"No?\" \"I want to stay with you!\" \"Well Hermes, I'm not doing anything exciting. You're sure to be bored.\" \"I don't care!\" \"Okay then. Let's go see your sister Artemis shall we?\" Hermes smiled. Apollo leaned down, grabbing Hermes's hand. Space warped around them and they appeared in Artemis's camp. Apollo guided Hermes towards the fire where Artemis was sitting. She turned her head towards him and patted the spot on the log next to her. Then she caught sight of Hermes. She sent Apollo a scrutinizing glance. Helios's sun had set, and Selene's moon was crawling up the sky. Apollo sat down and pulled Hermes on to the log next to him. \"Don't wander off,\" Apollo warned. \"Monsters might eat you.\" \"I wouldn't let them!\" Hermes insisted. \"Okay, but beware Herms.\" Apollo turned to Artemis. \"Isn't it a bit late for him?\" Artemis asked. Apollo shrugged. \"He'll be fine.\" Hermes tried to get off the log, but Apollo grabbed his shoulder. \"Nope.\" \"But-\" \"Nope.\" Hermes pouted but didn't try to get up again. He looked tired. Artemis smiled but shook her head as she remembered why Apollo was here. \"Will she live?\" \"You doubt my healing prowess?\" Apollo asked rhetorically. \"Of course she'll live. I wouldn't let one of my sister's precious hunters die from simple poison.\" Artemis's shoulders sagged from relief. \"Thank the fates.\" Apollo nodded, his gaze turned towards the fire. He didn't recognize what Artemis had on a stick. \"What's that?\" \"Marshmallow.\" \"What?\" \"A food the Egyptian pantheon put together. They taste well melted and dipped in nectar.\" Apollo nodded. \"And how did you get some?\" Apollo felt Hermes shift next to him, leaning on him. \"A cat gave them to me.\" \"What?\" \"You heard me. She called herself Bast.\" \"Huh. Let me try one\" Apollo glanced at Hermes, he looked half asleep. Artemis handed him a 'Marshmallow' on a stick. \"Hold it above the fire for a while\" \"Sure.\" \"How's his training going?\" \"It's going. He's improving a lot, I'm proud of him.\" \"You should be.\" Apollo nodded, looking towards Hermes again. He smiled. \"Tired?\" \"No,\" Hermes mumbled. \"Yeah, you are.\" Apollo shook his head, they hummed a quiet lullaby to lull him fully asleep. Wrapping his free arm around Hermes, he turned back to Artemis and his stick with the marshmallow. With a frown, Apollo noticed it was burning. He hastily pulled it from the fire. Artemis snickered. \"Why didn't you tell me it was on fire?? Its ruined!\" \"No, it's not. The outsides burnt but the inside isn't.\" Apollo blew out the fire. \"You sure this is edible?\" \"Certain.\" Apollo took a bite of it, expecting it to have a little give. Instead, melted goop exploded over his face. Apollo turned to look at Artemis. \"How dare you.\" Artemis cackled. Apollo licked his lips. He rid his face of the marshmallow goop with a single thought. \"You know, that wasn't actually half bad, despite its er. Explosive tendencies. \"You know, you're really adorable with Hermes. Never thought I would see you of all gods tote around a kid and sing them to sleep.\" \"Shut up. \"It's true! You're so sweet to him. You've come quite far from wanting to throw him into Tartarus.\" \"Fuck you.\" \"What? It's true.\" \"I was dumb. And angry. I want to go back and punch me in the dick. He's such a sweet- No that's not the word, little shit stole my bow yesterday. He's enjoyable.\" \"You love him.\" \"Well yeah, he's my little brother.\" Artemis shook her head. \"Go get him home. Maia will have your head if you keep him much longer.\" \"True. See you, Artie\" \"Bye Apollo\" Apollo picked up Hermes, and space warped around them and he was at Maia's lovely home. Apollo knocked on the door, and it swung open in what was probably less than a second. Maia stood there. Looking entirely peeved. \"You were supposed to have him back a half hour ago.\" \"He wanted to go on an adventure with me. So I took him to see my sister until he fell asleep. That's not terrible, is it Maia?\" \"No. But that doesn't change anything!\" \"Yeah yeah okay. Let's just get him into a proper bed shall we?\" Maia stepped aside begrudgingly and let Apollo carry the sleeping Hermes to his room. Apollo leaned over his bed, tucking in the young god. He pressed a kiss to his forehead as Maia stood aside impatiently. Eyes tracking his every move, as if he would hurt him. Apollo walked out of the room, Maia not long behind him. \"He has more training tomorrow,\" Apollo informed her, breaking the silence. \"You take him every day.\" \"He's an Olympian God, Maia, he needs to know how to defend himself. I will see you in the morning.\" Apollo disappeared in a flash of light.",

    "text": "The cold November air dragged against my skin in a fit of rage. As clear as the skies might have been, the wind had been relentless. Hades and I were walking barefoot in the terf of the high school's football field. It was technically trespassing, but I was a sucker for a good place to watch the stars. On a beautiful night like this, how could I pass up such an opportunity? Hades sweatshirt draped over my frame, a bit too large for me. It was somehow cozier. My hair was unruly, but I managed to throw it up into a ponytail. Tonight was unprompted, but Hades loved to make a romantic gesture, no matter how big or little it might have been. My cell phone's vibrations woke me out of a dead sleep when he called me, telling me that he was waiting outside. It was two in the morning, but the stars never slept. Why should we? Eventually, we landed in the center of the field, the sky a map for us to view. We both sat criss-crossed, letting the grass prickle at our thighs. Though I loved the stars, I was no good with constellations. Hades pointed a few out to me, enough for me to joke that he should drop English and become an astronomer, but he didn't know many. Still, we sat happily, content to even be viewing them. After a while, Hades' skin grew goosebumps. I offered him back his sweatshirt, but he declined too quickly. \"I don't want you to get cold,\" he said, his breath a fog against the air. I laughed softly, and said, \"The cold doesn't easily bother me. I've got thick skin.\" \"I'm okay, Seph - really. I'd feel bad if I took it back from you,\" he admitted. The silence graciously overcame us once again. The stars seemed to shine a little more brightly tonight than they had the past few days. I liked to think it was because we were sitting here looking at them. They knew they had an audience tonight, and they were getting a little cocky. It was all the better, though. The stars acted as personal spotlights for us as well. \"I like the winter,\" I mumbled out. \"It's poetic, if you think about it.\" \"Everything is dead, or dying. Doesn't make good weather to grow flowers,\" he countered. \"That's why my mother hates winter. Although, it doesn't slow down business. Once Valentine's Day hits, sales spike up enough to cover whatever we lost the months before. But I like the winter, and everything dying. The leaves become beautiful, vibrant, warm colors that scatter the sky before paling in comparison and falling. The coldness is so much better than the heat, because when it's too cold you can layer up enough until you're warm. But you can't strip down enough to cool off in the heat. The holidays make us warm enough anyway,\" I described. I tore my eyes away from the sky briefly to look at him, and he was staring right back at me, so interested in what I had to say. I couldn't help but smile at how in love he looked. I never wanted that look to die. \"And besides,\" I continued, still looking at him. \"It's reassuring and beautiful to know that once spring comes, everything will come back to life. The world keeps cycling around in seasons, and so much happens in so little of time. Just knowing there's beauty after death is enough.\" \"That was very poetic,\" he agreed, chuckling. Then, he said, \"It gets dark too early, though.\" \"More time to look at the stars then.\" That was enough for him. He nodded at me, still smiling, before looking back up at them. I allowed my eyes to cast back to them, admiring how brightly they shined once more. In darkness, there is light. In coldness, there is warmth. In everything, there is Hades, right beside me. Somehow, that was enough for me.",

    "text": "Nijimura had been sitting on a hill under a large popular tree watching his father's flocks. He was a prince, but here he was in the humble fields. His father had fifty sons, not all of them could be living the high life in the city, not to mention, he was definitely not his father, Priam's favorite, that belong to Hector. Hector was a great hero and the whole city of Troy loved him, Nijimura was seen more as a beautiful man who couldn't stay away from the women of the city, he flirted all day and all night with the dozens of women hopping to be made his wife, but none of them seemed worth it. None of their beauty could capture his attention (and if were honest that is the only thing that mattered in ancient Greece when picking out a wife.). He felt so alone, but he could not marry someone who was so dull, he wanted someone as blessed as he was that he could look forward going home to. Nijimura complicated this and the fight his bull had lost to Ares, the immortal god of war. He was glad to be done with the god and felt no remorse in his lost battle, he was glad to be done interacting with the god and hoped to never be at risk of seeing them again. As Nijimura looked over the flocks two beautiful men and a woman approached him. All of them were dressed in fine fabrics and laced with gold. Their faces shone like moons and they moved with such grace there was no way that they were human. The three beautiful specimens appeared to be bickering amongst each other, with one holding a golden apple that they all seemed to be fighting over. The three finally stopped in front of him, they were so gorgeous that Nijimura couldn't get his mouth to open to even give a pick-up line he had been practicing for hours sitting there looking after the fluffy white blobs. If fact, he couldn't even move his limbs to get up. The three finally stopped arguing amongst themselves and looked down at Nijimura. \"Ah here he is.\" A blonde one said to the other. \"I see, you were quite right in your assessment.\" The others agreed. Then the one in the middle with baby pink hair spoke up,\" Mortal, I am Momoi, the queen of the gods, goddess of marriage, children, and royalty.\" The blonde man then spoke up,\" I am Kise, the god of love.\" \"And I,\" the last, a green haired man, who seemed more uncomfortable being here than the others, \"am Midorima, God of wisdom, war and the crafts.\" Momoi spoke up, \"You, Nijimura of Troy, have been chosen to judge use three goddess for the prize of this golden apple.\" She then handed him the apple, on it was inscribed in Greek, the words \"the most beautiful\". \"Oh, great gods, how could I, a mere mortal, ever judge three perfect beings?\" Nijimura cried out, not really knowing what else to say in the presence of such beautiful glory. Really how could he decide? \"You are the most beautiful masculine man on Earth, logically beauty recognizes beauty, and therefore you must choose.\" Midorima responded. \"That and you showed fairness to Ares who won against your bull, giving up the prize with no hesitation, so we expect you to be fair in this also.\" \"Of course, we can give you some time to decide, this is a very important decision after all.\" Kise added with a glint in his eyes. The other gods nodded, all smirking at each other. \"Then tomorrow at dawn we shall all met back up for the decision.\" Momoi declared and the gods all left. Not long however, Nijimura had chased a sheep up a hill, only to find it perched on top of the lap of the Queen of the Gods. \"Hello Mortal. I know it is hard for your finite mind to pick from our infinite beauty, but I could make the choice easier, I am the queen of heaven and of royalty, if you pick me, I could make you rich and give you all of this continent as your Kingdom.\" She purred out. Nijimura was greatly swayed by her words. He could finally show his good for nothing father that he was worth something. Before he could respond though, the goddess was gone. He grabbed the run-away sheep and began to make his way to the bottom. There was a cave, and a voice called out to him from the cave. Nijimura recognizing the voice of the god walked into the cave where Midorima was waiting him. \"Nijimura I know that Momoi has offered you many great lands, and that these will impress the people of Troy and your father, but they will still not love you. For you did not gain these on your own but were given them by a goddess, they will say that you are weak and will not amount to much. I offer you, however, the wisdom and battle prowess for you to stand on your own two feet and gain all of your lands through your own hands. Then your father and all of Troy will be impressed.\" Nijimura may not have been the smartest prince of Troy, but even he could see the logic here and her offer seemed more tempting then that of Momoi. But once again, before he could respond, the god had disappeared. Nijimura then left the cave and went back to his fields and to the spot on the hill where he watched them. The sun was starting to set on the land, and when he reached the top of the hill he saw the beautiful god Kise laughing and running around the sheep. The light caught on hair and the sunset made his eyes glow. \"There you are prince of Troy!\" He called out. Nijimura made the rest of the way towards the god of love. \"I see in your heart, you do not plan on choosing me, but wait till you hear what I have to offer you before you make your choice.\" \"Beautiful god, I do not think you could offer anything to rival what I have already been offered.\" The God stopped playing and walked over with a smile and twinkle in his eyes, \"That is where you are wrong. I know what they offered you, just as they know what I will offer you. I offer you which you greatly desire, I offer you the love of the most beautiful mortal in the world.\" \"I thought you said that I was the most beautiful mortal.\" \"No, that is not what we said, we said you were the most beautiful masculine man living on earth.\" \"Then you offer me the most beautiful woman?\" \"No, not quite.\" Kise responded with a small giggle. Nijimura knitted his eyebrows in confusion. \"Then who, o holy one.\" \"I will give you the love of Akashi of Sparta, the most beautiful of feminine men. The wife of Aomine.\" \"Ha, and what good is some married beautiful man to me? What will he be able to provide?\" Nijimura scoffed, of course he heard of the beauty of Akashi of Sparta, everyone had, but what did it matter to him. He needed someone who would leave him heirs. Kise seemed almost frustrated, but no willing to give up on getting her prize so soon he responded, \"Akashi is called the Queen of Sparta for a reason, he was raised practically as a girl, and even has a daughter he cares for, and for the fact that he is married, that it little enough to overcome, a minor detail.\" \"A daughter? Through a concubine?\" Kise just shrugged, \"Either way, is it not someone of equal beauty you long to make your wife, is that not what you have been searching for? Akashi is all of that, and a queen who knows all womanly duties, and is also the child of the great Zeus, who would protect him and his lover.\" Kise did have a point here, by marrying someone of Zeus' line, he could also write himself into history and get better placement in the underworld. The god also said he was raised as a female, and could run a household, raise a child, and not to mention his renowned beauty. Nijimura had longed to hold someone who was as beautiful as he was, and bringing the queen to Troy would make everyone, including his brother and father, jealous. Nijimura didn't think that Kise could pose a good offer but he was mistaken. Nijimura did not even look around to know that the love god had left. The next morning Nijimura sat upon the top of the hill and waited for the gods to appear. They did as Dawn awoke. He was startles with their sudden appearance beside him, but not really surprised. \"Nijimura, Prince of Troy, I hope you have come to fair conclusion to the winner of the competition.\" Momoi announced looking smug, thinking she won, but the other gods also had a similar expression. \"Who do you choose as the most beautiful?\" Nijimura stood and addressed the gods, \"My fair immortals, you must not be mad at me and my assessment, but to me Love is the most beautiful thing, and therefore Kise wins the apple.\" Kise jumped and ran up to grab the golden apple from Nijimura's hand. The other immortals looked upset at the outcome and did not accept his choice and left grumbling. \"Troy will not be in our favor Prince.\" Momoi shouted as they left. \"You have chosen wisely my prince, and I shall not abandon you, you shall have your prize.\" Kise giggled. Not long after, they had gotten a boat and a crew who was willing to take Nijimura across the sea to the city of Sparta under the pretense that it was for exploration and diplomacy with the Greeks. They made it across the sea swiftly to the city of Sparta. And when it was announced that a Prince of Troy had come to the city, he was accepted into the house of Aomine, the king of Sparta. He was a strong and rich man known throughout the land for his ruthlessness, but he was a rude and a man who enjoyed earning glory for himself, fighting for himself and little else. Nijimura was welcomed into the house by the staff and made his way into the throne room. There sat Aomine, and his wife, Akashi. Nijimura's eyes caught on the beauty of the Queen, he had bright red hair and soft crimson eyes that blazed in dull hall, his skin was as if it was carved from pure marble- a beauty to rival the gods themselves. He stood there with his daughter. The young girl clung to Akashi when he entered, but he just gently pushed her off and back into a proper stance for meeting guest. \"Welcome to Sparta, Prince Nijimura of Troy.\" Aomine greeted him. \"I am glad to make your acquaintance Aomine King of Sparta.\" He responded. After telling tales to each other and explaining why he was here, he was provided with a place to stay for his time in Sparta, for him and his men. At dinner there was a feast held in his honor, and they all drank and ate. But the entire time Nijimura could not take his eyes off of Akashi. He moved so gracefully. \"I see your very interested in my wife Akashi.\" Aomine appeared next to him. \"Why yes, he is truly beautiful. How did you manage to become so lucky?\" He asked. \"Gods knows why. He was allowed to choose and for some reason he chooses me, people say it's because of my money, but I don't mind for a beauty like that.\" They both let out a laugh. \"Have a wife of your own?\" he asked after a few more drinks. \"No, I do not. I hope to be lucky as you!\" \"Ha! I bet you do!\" and they feasted late into the night. After a while they were all went off to bed, but Nijimura had gotten a little too into the festivities, and Akashi ordered a few men to take him to his room and led the way. When he was placed down, the guards left, but Akashi stood over him and looked on him for a moment. Nijimura had no control over his mouth, \"My queen, you are the most beautiful creature to grace this planet, you are even more lovely then the gods, and I would know I have seen them.\" Akashi scowled and started to walk out of the room, \"Do not disrespect the immortals so, or it will come back to haunt you.\" He said before leaving the room. The next morning, he awoke for breakfast, to find it to much later in the day then he had intended to awaken. He went down to find some food but most of it had been eaten, and the servants were working on creating lunch. He was just about to give up on breakfast when Akashi spotted him and came over. \"Can I help you sir?\" He asked in a voice like warm honey. \"I was attempting to find some breakfast it seems as though it has all been put away.\" \"True, however there is some bread here in the back. I'll go and retrieve it.\" Akashi went to go get the bread, but Nijimura followed to the displeasure of the kitchen staff as he almost knocked over several bowels and got in the way of a young serving girl who spilled some sort of stew onto the floor. He apologized and attempted to help but Akashi took him by the hand and led him away saying, \"I do not believe they need any further help from you, Prince of Troy.\" When they got to the bread, Akashi grabbed a small loaf of fresh bread and handed it to him without so much of a word. He ate quickly, and Akashi left him as soon as he could without being rude. Nijimura later went out hunting with Aomine and shot a large boar for their dinner. When they returned Aomine sung of his great archery skills and Nijimura was flattered, but Akashi didn't even lift an eyebrow, he was calmly composed as he brought in the boar and got the staff on it so that they could cook it as soon as possible. Dinner was relatively calm, tales were told from all over the world between the prince and the king and those that had gathered there. They all went to their separate rooms for the evening, still feeling the effects from the night before. Nijimura walked around the castle instead, wondering how he was to bring Akashi back to Troy with him. He made plans to attempt to woo him the next day, but then Kise appeared to him. \"Nijimura, how is your romance coming along?\" the god asked. \"To tell you the truth, it isn't.\" he replied, sighing. \"O, I'm sure he will come along, especially with some help from me. Here take this potion and put it in his food, and he will surely fall in love with you.\" Kise gave him a small glass vile with a clear liquid swishing inside. Nijimura nodded and the god disappeared. The next morning, Nijimura spotted Akashi walking around a garden. He quickly plucked an apple and put the potion that Kise had given to him onto it. He then called out to Akashi and tossed the apple to him. However, Akashi did not even attempt to catch the apple but instead dodged it, and then proceeded to scowl at him, but even then, his beauty shone through. \"Prince of Troy, why do you throw fruit at me?\" \"I thought that you might be hungry, and it was the most beautiful fruit for the most beautiful man.\" Akashi frowned softened. \"Then you must be unaware that in Greece, that if I had caught your apple, then I would be accepting your proposal to marry you. Now you have gone and wasted a perfectly fine apple.\" There was a glint of amusement in his eyes. Nijimura just blushed, not knowing how else to respond. Akashi moved past him but continued to stroll around the garden. In a moment Nijimura followed him. He made small talk, talking about the weather, how lovely the house was, the difference between Greece and Troy and how beautiful his daughter was. \"So, is she yours? Or your husband's?\" Nijimura asked. Akashi hid his face in the leaves in a nearby tree, saying, \"Both, our daughter is by blood both of ours.\" Before Nijimura could ask Akashi how, he turned around, \"It is about time for lunch, do you not think so?\" Nijimura found himself hungry and realized that they had been talking all morning. Akashi smiled warmly. \"It was nice to talk to you son of Priam.\" Before he opened the door and moved through it like silk on the wind. Nijimura followed him through and stole every glance he could at Akashi that Aomine couldn't see. He was starting to fall hard for the beautiful, graceful, and mysterious man that was the Queen of Sparta. After lunch Nijimura didn't know what to do and went back to the garden and sat in the shade of a tree, staring out into the sky and across the amazing garden. Later he was awoken by a soft laughter, his eyes fluttered open to see Akashi above him smiling. \"If you were tired, why did you not simply go back into your room?\" \"I wanted to think.\" Akashi sat next to him in the grass so softly, that he didn't hear anything change. \"Hum, and what were you thinking about?\" \"You.\" \"Oh.\" They sat there in silence for a while enjoying the breeze. Akashi was staring at Nijimura openly, something he had not done. \"You are the most beautiful man I have ever seen.\" Akashi eventually said. \"I could say the same thing to you.\" Nijimura replied finally turning to meet his gaze. Akashi soon broke the gaze. His daughter then came tumbling through the bushes towards her mother and landed in his lap. \"You never said how you were able to have a child.\" \"Your right.\" At first, he didn't try to explain, but as the subject didn't change and the atmosphere became tenser. \"You have heard that I am the son of Zeus correct? Well it seems that somehow, through him, I am able to reproduce.\" Nijimura's eyes went wide at the emission, and Akashi avoided his eye contact as much as possible. \"That's amazing.\" Was all that Nijimura could say. Akashi fixed him with a dark look, but then seeing that he was serious his expression softened, \"most people find it disgusting, unnatural.\" Nijimura shook his head and was about to respond, but then Aomine can along the path, saw them, and came up to them. \"So this is where you have been Akashi. I expected to see you on the loom, not lounging with our foreign prince.\" Akashi wordlessly got up and went into the large house. Aomine turned towards Nijimura eyeing him wearily. \"So, Prince of Troy, when do you expect to leave my ports?\" He asked in a tighter voice. \"Oh, I believe it should not be long now.\" Nijimura replied, Aomine apparently did not like the way Nijimura said the sentence, for he gave a small frown. \"Yes, you should continue your journey.\" He nodded and left. That night at dinner Akashi boldly came and eat part of his meal besides Nijimura. He greatly enjoyed the company of the queen and in his obsession with Akashi, he didn't notice the hard look that Aomine gave him from across the room. Nijimura had been going back to his room that night, light on his feast. He was progressing well with Akashi, and he didn't even have to thank Kise. While he was strolling through the house, he overheard an argument from a room, one of the voices sounded like Akashi, and he went over to listen. \"I am perfectly capable to handling myself, you forget I am still a man.\" \"That is where you are wrong, you were brought here to act as a woman, so that is how you will act.\" Aomine's voice boomed. It then sounded like Akashi was going to say something more, but a hard-smacking sound silenced him. \"You are not to see that Trojan again, understand?!\" he commanded. Nijimura ran from the door as quickly and quietly as he could before he could hear any further response, he went down the hall and hide into a room not far off. Not long afterwards, Aomine barged out of the room. He stormed down the hall past the room Nijimura had hidden himself in. Nijimura slowly crept out and back to the room where the argument had taken place. He slowly opened the door and saw Akashi lying on the floor clothing strewn and tears running down his perfect cheeks making his eyes glow rimmed with same red that centered the large orbs. Nijimura ran into the room and held Akashi, \"What happened to you?\" Akashi quickly obtained his sobs, \"You have to leave, if Aomine finds you here he will certainly kill you, he is already planning on forcing you out of Sparta tomorrow.\" \"That is not what I asked, I asked what has happened to you.\" Akashi gave him wide eyes. \"Why do you care about me? You must leave, for your own safety.\" \"I am only concerned about your safety, in all honesty I only came to Sparta in hopes of meeting you and making you my wife.\" \"Your wife? Surely you knew I was married already.\" \"Yes, but the god Kise promised that I would have you.\" Akashi seemed slightly scandalized by this. \"So, I am just a prize to you then?\" \"No, maybe at first, but there is no way I could think that way now. You have captured my heart in every way.\" Akashi's eyes crinkled with a watery smile. \"And surely you do not want to stay with Aomine as your husband treating you as he does.\" Akashi nodded. \"I will leave with you, back to Troy, but we must leave quickly, for Aomine was already suspecting you before now, surly he is looking for you.\" Nijimura nodded and grabbed Akashi's hand. \"then we must hurry and get the men ready.\" They ran down the halls where the Trojans were and quickly awoke them, telling them that they were leaving that very moment. The men in their confusion and adrenaline did not question why, but simply took everything they owned and rushed out down to the boats as discreetly as they could. Just as Nijimura was leaving with Akashi in tow he heard Aomine shout out, he wanted Akashi and Nijimura found, they were both missing. The two shared a look, Nijimura squeezed Akashi's hand encouragingly and they fled from the palace into the city and then the harbor with everything that they could carry that belong to Akashi. They quickly boarded the ship, and all of the Trojan men quickly made the ship ready to sail. They saw lanterns being lit in the palace, and could hear shouts, they noticed that Akashi has gone missing. In no time they were ready to push off, and Kise was there to give wind to the sails. With the help of the god on their side they were able to get to the sea before anyone had come down to the harbor. Akashi looked longingly back on Sparta as the ships departed from the harbor, \"Goodbye my home, my daughter and my friends.\" And Nijimura came to pull him into an embrace, \"I can't help feeling this is only going to stir more trouble.\" Akashi continued, and before he could say more, Nijimura gently placed his lips onto of Akashi's stopping him from his train of thought. \"It is fine now my love, you do not have to think of Aomine or Greece again. You are now my wife, and I will not let anything happen to you,\" and they sailed back to Troy, Akashi's new home.",

      "\"You are the most beautiful masculine man on Earth, logically beauty recognizes beauty, and therefore you must choose.\"",

      "What will he be able to provide?\" Nijimura scoffed, of course he heard of the beauty of Akashi of Sparta, everyone had, but what did it matter to him.",
      "He needed someone who would leave him heirs.",
      "Kise seemed almost frustrated, but no willing to give up on getting her prize so soon he responded, \"Akashi is called the Queen of Sparta for a reason, he was raised practically as a girl, and even has a daughter he cares for, and for the fact that he is married, that it little enough to overcome, a minor detail.\"",
      "\"A daughter?",

      "And when it was announced that a Prince of Troy had come to the city, he was accepted into the house of Aomine, the king of Sparta.",
      "He was a strong and rich man known throughout the land for his ruthlessness, but he was a rude and a man who enjoyed earning glory for himself, fighting for himself and little else.",

      "Nijimura shook his head and was about to respond, but then Aomine can along the path, saw them, and came up to them.",
      "\"So this is where you have been Akashi.",
      "I expected to see you on the loom, not lounging with our foreign prince.\"",
      "Akashi wordlessly got up and went into the large house.",
      "Aomine turned towards Nijimura eyeing him wearily.",
      "\"So, Prince of Troy, when do you expect to leave my ports?\"",
      "He asked in a tighter voice.",
      "\"Oh, I believe it should not be long now.\"",
      "Nijimura replied, Aomine apparently did not like the way Nijimura said the sentence, for he gave a small frown.",
      "\"Yes, you should continue your journey.\"",
      "He nodded and left.",
      "That night at dinner Akashi boldly came and eat part of his meal besides Nijimura.",
      "He greatly enjoyed the company of the queen and in his obsession with Akashi, he didn't notice the hard look that Aomine gave him from across the room.",
      "Nijimura had been going back to his room that night, light on his feast.",
      "He was progressing well with Akashi, and he didn't even have to thank Kise.",
      "While he was strolling through the house, he overheard an argument from a room, one of the voices sounded like Akashi, and he went over to listen.",
      "\"I am perfectly capable to handling myself, you forget I am still a man.\"",
      "\"That is where you are wrong, you were brought here to act as a woman, so that is how you will act.\"",
      "Aomine's voice boomed.",
      "It then sounded like Akashi was going to say something more, but a hard-smacking sound silenced him.",
      "\"You are not to see that Trojan again, understand?!\"",
      "he commanded.",
      "Nijimura ran from the door as quickly and quietly as he could before he could hear any further response, he went down the hall and hide into a room not far off.",
      "Not long afterwards, Aomine barged out of the room.",
      "He stormed down the hall past the room Nijimura had hidden himself in.",
      "Nijimura slowly crept out and back to the room where the argument had taken place.",
      "He slowly opened the door and saw Akashi lying on the floor clothing strewn and tears running down his perfect cheeks making his eyes glow rimmed with same red that centered the large orbs.",
      "Nijimura ran into the room and held Akashi, \"What happened to you?\" Akashi quickly obtained his sobs, \"You have to leave, if Aomine finds you here he will certainly kill you, he is already planning on forcing you out of Sparta tomorrow.\"",
      "\"That is not what I asked, I asked what has happened to you.\"",
      "Akashi gave him wide eyes.",
      "\"Why do you care about me?",
      "You must leave, for your own safety.\"",
      "\"I am only concerned about your safety, in all honesty I only came to Sparta in hopes of meeting you and making you my wife.\"",
      "\"Your wife?",
      "Surely you knew I was married already.\"",
      "\"Yes, but the god Kise promised that I would have you.\"",
      "Akashi seemed slightly scandalized by this.",
      "\"So, I am just a prize to you then?\"",
      "\"No, maybe at first, but there is no way I could think that way now.",
      "You have captured my heart in every way.\"",
      "Akashi's eyes crinkled with a watery smile.",
      "\"And surely you do not want to stay with Aomine as your husband treating you as he does.\"",
      "Akashi nodded.",
      "\"I will leave with you, back to Troy, but we must leave quickly, for Aomine was already suspecting you before now, surly he is looking for you.\"",
      "Nijimura nodded and grabbed Akashi's hand.",
      "\"then we must hurry and get the men ready.\"",
      "They ran down the halls where the Trojans were and quickly awoke them, telling them that they were leaving that very moment.",
      "The men in their confusion and adrenaline did not question why, but simply took everything they owned and rushed out down to the boats as discreetly as they could.",
      "Just as Nijimura was leaving with Akashi in tow he heard Aomine shout out, he wanted Akashi and Nijimura found, they were both missing.",
      "The two shared a look, Nijimura squeezed Akashi's hand encouragingly and they fled from the palace into the city and then the harbor with everything that they could carry that belong to Akashi.",
      "They quickly boarded the ship, and all of the Trojan men quickly made the ship ready to sail.",
      "They saw lanterns being lit in the palace, and could hear shouts, they noticed that Akashi has gone missing.",
      "In no time they were ready to push off, and Kise was there to give wind to the sails.",
      "With the help of the god on their side they were able to get to the sea before anyone had come down to the harbor.",
      "Akashi looked longingly back on Sparta as the ships departed from the harbor, \"Goodbye my home, my daughter and my friends.\"",
      "And Nijimura came to pull him into an embrace, \"I can't help feeling this is only going to stir more trouble.\"",
      "Akashi continued, and before he could say more, Nijimura gently placed his lips onto of Akashi's stopping him from his train of thought.",
      "\"It is fine now my love, you do not have to think of Aomine or Greece again.",
      "You are now my wife, and I will not let anything happen to you,\" and they sailed back to Troy, Akashi's new home."

    "text": "The young woman had been sleeping on her throne for the last few weeks, curled up against the hard surface with nothing to keep the cold away. As her servants came in and out to check on their Queen, and as they wondered as to why she would be resting in such a manner, one of the wiser and older servants told them the most likely answer. Spring was nearing its end, and with it, the time her Majesty spent away from her lover. Not that anyone would dare to mention it in front of the goddess of the Underworld. She would never admit it. Nevermind that she'd been missing her other half so much she took to spending her nights not-quite sleeping in anticipation.Whispers grew and grew, twinkling laughter and knowing looks and by the time Flynn arrived with news and teasing jokes for the Queen, all of the palace waited with her. \"Good morning your Majesty!\" The brown haired god of thiefs landed, the wings in his boots fluttering around his ankles. With a smile carved to charm and flirting skills to rival the goddess of love, Flynn made his way to the steps before the throne, the mischievous glint never leaving his eyes. \"Anxious are we?\" The goddess glared at him, white hair flashing dark flames as she woke fully and streched. \"Don't be foolish, why would i be?\" \"Well, having to be apart from your sweetheart for so long must be awfull.\" Flynn continued, grining as Elsa scowled. \"Im used to it.\" Her quiet words reached him and his smile faultered a fraction, before returning full force as he flew to her side, taking her hand and kissing it, his eyes full of afeccion. They had been friends for centuries now, troughout the girls cold moods and his infuriating troublemaking ways. \"My Queen, dont make such an expression.\" He said, half serious and then his tone changed, teasing and making the goddess roll her eyes as he finished. \"Otherwise you'll make me want to tell Moana just how much she's missed.\" \"Dont you dare.\" His laugh echoed as he doged a punch, flying back to the steps. Unable to help herself, Elsa smiled too. \"What did you came here for anyway?\" \"To deliver a message as usual.\" His lips quirked as he bowed deeply before saying. \"Her majesty, Moana the goddess of spring has finnished her duties to the mortal world and will be arriving shortly. Your beloved is coming home.\" Now a genuine smile graced Flynn's lips, but Elsa was too preocupied to notice it as she shot up from her throne, silver braid swishing as she made her way to a mirror to check herself. \"Oh my titans, i don't have time to...\" She whirled on Flynn then, black fire making her silver strands go dark. \"Why did you not warn me before. I must look like a mess!\" She rambled on, trying hurriedly to smooth her hair and long navy blue dress wich must be all kinds of bunched after her little nap. Flynn chuckled as he moved closer, grabing her arms gently, the wings on his feeth already restless to fly somewhere else. \"You look exuberant as usual, Elsa. Calm down.\" She looked at her friend, blue eyes wide. He kissed her forehead and took flight. As he turned, he shouted in place of a goodbye: \"Just don't forget to wipe the drool off your lovely cheek.\" His cackling laughter filled the throne room as he left, Cerberus trying to take a bit off him as he flew by. Elsa breathed deeply and exhaled, trying to compose herself. But before she could, a voice she knew all too well, no matter how much time they were forced to spend apart, reached her ears. \"Elsa!\" The delight in Moana's voice crashed into her with almost as much force as the goddess herself, trowing her body against her lover with closed eyes and a wide smile. \"I missed you so much.\" The last part was barely there, a whisper, meant to no ears but theirs. Elsa burried her face on the place where neck met shoulder, smelling the scent of grass and flowers and sun from the dark skin her wife, her life partner. Before she could form the words, warm lips, so oposite her own, cut her off, covering her cold mouth in a deep, longing filled kiss, and just like that she was lost in between hands searching for hips, bodies meshing together, teeth finding skin. Moana came away breathless, eyes hazy. The goddess of death gulped trying to contain herself. And yet, when the goddess of spring smiled at her, slow and lovingly, brown curls falling over her arms as they got closer, Elsa felt her hair burst into flames without her permission. You see, as much of a calm and composed goddess she was, the ruler of the underworld did not really like to be kept away from her lover, and Olympus be dammed if she wasn't going to try and make up for the lost time.",

You are all in my hands, now.\" [End flashback] Our heroes fought the evil mexican Dia de los Muertos cultists. They matched them at every blow, at every strike, at every scrap, at every rape. A battle raged for five thousand years, blood having long drenched the land into a foul swamp. But they did not get any closer, to winning or losing. Dead rose, zombies fell, yet the struggle was far from over. So they settled into a dance competition instead. \"But who is going to arbiter, uh?\" said Meesh suspiciously. \"True, bias is a very serious problem\" nodded Leo wisely. So the three did a mexican spell to Xolotl, and the mascots from Five Nights At Freddy's returned, as did Devil Panda Holy God, Kubo and Kylo Wren! \"That's not fair!\" said Coraline, snot falling on Coco's face. \"You will so loose now!\" said Panda evilly and rapistly, but Kayla shoved tortillas up his nose and killed him again. \"Now, let us begin!\" said Golden Freddy as he rubbed his oily, gangrenous penis on Manolo's panties. Manolo was first, and put on a lovely dress and danced the marimba. But the black oil gave him genital warts, so he scraped his genitalia, leaving a black red hole full of blood as his penis and testicles were reduced to purplish straps of pus-infused bloody meat. This made him slip and fall on his face. \"0/10\" said Bonnie \"3/10\" said Freddy \"-9/10\" said Chica, \"#PizzaGateInYourTummy.\" \"10/10\" said Foxy, who was staring at Meesh's lovely ass. \"4/10\" said Golden Freddy. \"ichi/ziyuu\" said Kubo boredly. \"2/10\" said Kylo Wrecked. \"So the score is overwhelmingly negative\" said Cat, \"That means you DIE!\" \"NOOOOOO!!!!!\" screamed Manolo, but it was too latte, a door to deepest Hell opened and he was raped by elephant demons with eye barbed cocklets for all eternal history. \"Now its your turn, Bayonetta\" said Freddy evilly and lustfully. Bayonetta smirked, and performed all dances of Heaven and Hell with exquisite macarena side dishes. Everyone upvoted 10/10 except Kubo who was jealous, so he died instead and was raped by dolphin demons of despise. \"We lost two of our own!\" cried Leo criedly. \"Now you can no longer win!\" said Jack who pointed his finger heroically. \"For glory!\" shouted Caroline. \"For justice!\" shouted Jack. \"For love!\" shouted Sally. \"For fortitude!\" shouted Mayor. \"For prudence!\" shouted Jeanne. \"For righteousness!\" shouted Cereza. \"For truth!\" shouted the cat. \"For compassion!\" shouted Meesh. \"In name of the Moon, may these ignanimous ignobile ignorant idiots be sent to HELL!!!!!!\" shouted Norman, and his eyes glowed pure pink. \"Noooo!!!!\" the evil ones cried but it was too latte, evil tentacles sent them to the Fields of Elysium where they would be raped by Greek Heroes for beyond all history into futures unknown, boys and girls! And so Halloween was restored, and they did trick or treating worth for two years (geddit). But every shadow has a light, and from Heaven descended an evil being, the sun shining that purged all shadows. \"Next time, Haloowieners, next tiem!\" she cackled evilly It was....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................MAMA ODIE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",

    "text": "-1- The road to Hades is not where mortals think. Persephone walks the path, which: for all the ways the world has changed in hundreds of years, it remains as it always was. The path is always the same and it always begins in the forest, though which forest may differ. Last time, she walked back down from a cursed sea of trees, embracing souls who got lost along the way and leading them home. The year before, she found the path to the underworld through the forest on the Rhine, gathering pine needles and fir twigs to decorate Hades' hearth with. This year, she walks an old path far from home. It calls to her, as one path always does. This one is winding through old, impossibly old mountains. It's a path she thought would call her sooner than it has; beneath the mighty mountains lay Tartarus, the cursed land that segregated hectonchaires in their time, strange monsters birthed by her great-grandmother. Her husband buried them far from Mount Olympus, their massive bodies distorting the earth above. The hectonchaires are there still: the original tenants, deep in these mountains. And Persephone walks their path, knowing that the mighty mountains are but one way home. Sometimes, she stops walking and presses a hand down to the moist ground, feels the warmth of their breath in the damp soil as they turn, hungry-mouthed, toward Persephone Carpophorus, the fruit-bearer -- but she does not allow them to surface. It is not yet time for them to meet. Instead, she stands and dusts off her fingers. She resumes her trek, walking down the mountain lands of what is now Kentucky (how funny a sound, she thinks; this year, she mumbles it under her breath as she walks the trail, Ken-tuck-ee, Ken-tuck-ee, Ken-tuck-ee). She has been here before, of course -- like mankind, Persephone is a wanderer at heart. All paths wander and meander - sometimes through cities and rivers, regrets and hopes, light and dark, but only one path leads to her winter home. The only home any of them have, in the end. She walks and she walks and she walks, until she comes to a path where all divergent paths lead to one. -2- The path to hell, humans have written, is a solitary path best traveled alone. They are wrong. She usually completes the first leg of her journey alone, but not the second. Humanity often accompanies her, regardless of the mood she's in. At first, she found the shades a terrifying reminder of her journey; now they are only companions. She finds comfort in them; they, too, were pulled here without warning. She prepares to see them in the beyond, taking one last deep breath of fresh air before committing back to the world below. She presses her hand to the door of a cave; it should be cold but it warms to her touch. The realm, like the man, is pliable to her caress. She walks down the path and she touches the walls as her eyes adjust -- blinding sunshine to ill-starred night. Her stomach twists in a desire for what is already gone, but she swallows and continues ahead. It has always been dark here, though he has done his best in the centuries since her marriage to make the place more welcoming, the moment of her transition less bizarre. This year he has gone for a golden theme; Hades Plouton has feted his halls in elaborate golden petals and ferns, living up to his name. She plucks a small metallic flower and puts it in her hair, knowing he will be pleased by her acceptance of his offering. She does not have the heart to tell him that gilded cages are no less binding. She suspects he already knows. Shades filter past her in her journey; discombobulated Christians, Muslims, Buddhists, and more filing down to her shores. They are all her guests, and Persephone Poludegmon, she who receives many, smiles upon them. Most of them who come no longer keep the old ways, but fortunately Persephone has many names, and she recognizes all her children. She is growing closer to the point where she will become, once more, the queen of the realm; the barking of her dog alerting her to her approach as he keeps the shades on the straight path. Once, she had feared Hades dog; but now, she knows the dog would allow her passage. As if to prove the point, Kerberos barks happily at her return; the shades filter past him quickly, perhaps relieved she occupies the dog's time. The dog of hell flops onto his belly and she pets him; like most things in Hades' realm, the dog is far less fearsome in her presence. It scares her still, sometimes, the power she has here; she is Hades' equal, in a way neither Hera nor Amphitrite is in their own realm. At the end of the hall of gilded earth, the path widens unto the shores of the river Styx. This year, Hades has painted the shoreline with strange, silver sand for her; an approximation of an ocean from a man who has never been to one. She pities him for that, but they both know there are limits of where they can go together. Hades' hall is not a self-imposed exile. The spot where he last came up - where he took her - no longer bears fruit. She doubts Enna's field ever will bear fruit again. Her mother holds grudges, and so does Hades. Hades' beach is festered with souls, all those who have not been able to pay the ferryman's coin to cross. There have been so many waiting in the last few centuries; humans have forgotten the old ways. Fortunately, god's marriages allow certain privileges, certain transmutations of powers. She needs to only think of him, feels the familiar tug of Hades' powers in her palms, and coins appear. She plies Hades' gold, putting coins under tongues. An orderly queue forms, because in Hades' realm, the shades learn quickly to stay on the right side of their iron rule. She would like to change the rule about the coins, but such traditions are hard to break and Hades breaks his rules for so few. She presses coins into shades' palms, emptying Charon's shores of the stragglers. She could go ahead of her subjects, but, because their fear is visible on sniveling noses and wide eyes, she nods toward Charon to take them first. Let them see that not all deathless gods are cruel; rigid, yes, but not unmerciful. It takes a few trips for him to ferry them over to Hades' shore and she makes a note of the delay; she will tell Hades it keeps her from him longer, and see if that is enough to make his unyielding heart melt. While she is waiting, she stares at Hades' beach. It is a kind if terrible gift; he knows that to be here is hard for her. He has always been aware of her sacrifice of the world above. She wonders, as she always has, if it is hard for him to make that sacrifice. When she had asked, once, whether he regretted earning her mother's wrath, he said it did not matter. He did not much care for the above ground, anyway. That had been that. She supposed Demeter might -- might -- let him go to Olympus, but neither of them has ever been fond of Olympus. In a way, it is a mercy she ended up here - she cannot imagine what it would be to be Apollo, Aries, or Athena's wife; she has no patience for the family disputes, and they all cheat at Petteia anyway. In so many ways, she knows, she was lucky. But, still, she thinks, it would have been nice to be asked if she had wanted to rule such a dark place, if anyone had ever thought to ask what she wanted in the brokerage of her marriage. She was taken against her will, and perhaps the fault is hers for never asking mother to speak of her match (for Demeter would never give her willingly), or Hades fault for taking her without mother's permission, or mother's fault for never telling her what she was always meant to be, or father Zeus' fault for...really, many, many things, but most importantly of all, not communicating to any of them. She shook her head. She should not focus on things so long-gone; her abduction was very long ago. She has made her peace with her fate. Mostly. She looks at the impressive waves in the silver soil Hades has crafted for her as Styx burbles at the shore. Styx does not exactly lap at the shore, for it does not behave like the water above. It is water, all right, but it is brackish and cloudy and full of oaths and secrets. She drops a toe in and it fizzes and bubbles around her; she does not walk further in. Once, she thought it bubbled because she was an above-creature trespassing upon its wet abode, but now she knows that isn't the case. It is meant to be a comfort; a bit of the above welcoming her back to the down below. The clapping of an oar on a boat diverts her attention; Charon finally has room for her. \"Good to have you back,\" Charon says when she finally boards the boat. He had once been far more taciturn, but since she gives him the majority of his trade these days, his attitude has become far more subservient to her. \"Slow days, without ye.\" \"Ah,\" she says; she offers an obol, though he, of course, takes her for free. She does not say it is good to be back, for the gloomy halls and hallow spaces leave little room for joy. Already she misses the sun, the seas, and the sand: the crumbles of silver, the gloomy churn of Lethe and Styx, and even the low lights ensconced in golden flowers cannot compare to the sheer variety of natural life and light her mother has prepared up above. It is not a right and natural place, the underworld, and Hades tries and tries and tries to make the majesty measure up to the up above and never quite makes it right. But she does, as always, appreciate the effort. She feels the leaves caught in her clothing crumble as she and the boatman row their way toward the city of Dis in agreeable silence. True to form, he says nothing as her clothing transforms, her chthonic powers coming to bear; green turtleneck and practical jeans becoming the familiar peplos and chiton. These, she wears for him: he has always preferred the older style. \"Welcome home, Persephone Praxidike,\" Charon says as they breach the other side of that silver shore. He holds his hat in his hands as she stands upon her lands, a sign of respect that she acknowledges with a small nod. She is severe, as befits a queen, and he does not expect more than her nod in return. With age has come acceptance of who she is, what she is, what she must be. She is the Praxidike, exactor of justice. That is the problem of being a part-time underworld god, she thinks: no matter how she feels, she has her duties to attend to. And so does her husband. -3- The road to the city of Dis is shorter than humans think it is. There are so many stories of it being a hard and difficult climb, surrounded by hazards, and none of them are true. Every year her walk here is a bit different; the six months she goes up to the surface, Hades goes crazy, tries to find more and more ways to make it more to her liking. He tries hard. She cannot fault him for that. This year, it is a cozy village road, with lapis lazuli and sapphire skies and diamond moons. It reminds her of her girlhood in the Elysium fields, and she is sure that is in the intention. Her heart tugs as she thinks of Hades, six months alone, painting the world under the world just for her. It is almost welcoming, in that anything in this strange world is welcoming. He has done a great deal to it since she first came on the back of his chariot, all those years ago. When she first came to the underworld, it was black, blacker than darkness itself. He hadn't bothered to form anything to his realm, not then. He'd had no muse before her. She had screamed, and wailed, and beat against his helmet and his breastplate, and hard-hearted Hades had not let her go, had told her their marriage had been arranged with her father, but she saw only blackness for his realm: it was dark, and it was cold. She'd put her hand up from his chariot and she'd seen it vanish into the pitch and she had screamed, startled. His arm had wrapped around her waist, as oppressive as it was comforting, and she'd fainted. This is the first memory she has always held of them: her kidnapping, her weakness. But her second memory is truer of what she has known of him as his wife: by the time she awoke, he had created torches, installed bronziers of hardened ore with bits of the Phlegethon. At the time, it was a mark of how alien he was to her, to need to make adjustments to a realm just so she could see her barren new home. Now, she understands: having been below since time immortal, her uncle-husband's eyes had adjusted to the darkness. It had been an oversight, nothing more; perhaps the same was true of her marriage charter. Her eyes had gotten used to the darkness, and his gentleness too. It had simply taken her a long time to see either, unaccustomed as she was to looking for it. She drifts through the city's streets, admiring his handiwork this year in what passes for the gardens of the dead. It is more sparse at the ground versus what he has made of their (lack of) sky; copper mushrooms and granite turnips brush against the asphodel and dirt path through the city, and she allows a few to become real, nourishing nightcaps and buttonshades. It's a frivolous waste of power - they will die, as all things down here die. Except herself and her husband, of course. Not them, never them; king and queen eternal when all the other Gods will be laid to waste, the eldest son inheriting the final kingdom. When her father made her queen here, he sealed her eternal responsibilities: she will live long after every Olympian dies. She does not look forward to her lord father becoming one of their many guests; Zeus will find it odd to find himself him without a castle. She knows there is a chance he will endevour to take her husband's place, but between uncle and father, she knows where her loyalties will lie -- though such will bring her mother to weep. Hades has no grand castle. He has never quite enjoyed ostentation in that way, which she appreciates. She had no patience for her father's grandstanding as a small child hiding by her mother's skirts; she has less patience still, now. She walks up the cliff face past dozens of souls, who part for her in reverent grace or confused shuffling. It is not Olympus in its golden glory; this is a more natural path, one simple incline to a cliff upon which sits two chairs and three staircases, each a path to a different land within their land. On the other end of the cliff is eternal darkness, primordial and terrifying. She does not look down into that deep and eternal pit as she climbs. There are some steps even Gods fear to tread. She feels the ichor in her veins sing, as it always does when she is close to him. It is a reminder from the fates of their destiny-thread; wound together until the very end of the time. She comes to the top of his hill and she finds him, her heart speeding a bit at the sight of her husband on his own throne. He has been working hard, she sees immediately; he is pale, skin mottled like marble, eyes hard as flint and yet they turn to softness at the sight of her. He's dressed in a more modern style for her - a black suit, with a black tie, and black shoes and socks and no doubt black pocket square tucked in his suit jacket. Color is something he loves but struggles to replicate outside of his stones. His eyes take in her look, and though he is too stern to smile, she feels the warmth of his heart as his hand delicately reaches for her own. \"I missed you,\" he says, in a low and deep murmur. His voice is as dry leaves upon empty paths, and she wavers not at all as she takes her place beside him. Her throne is threaded with golden vines this year, she notes; she wonders, sometimes, if he still feels guilty for how she came here and what she gave up to stay. She takes his hand, the closest to a kiss he'll ever give her in public. \"Thank you for the flower,\" she whispers, and sees the hand of the king shiver in hers in return. He loves her with a more brilliant and electric love than father Zeus loves Hera, than Poseidon loves Amphitrite. Their gazes wander; they fall too far in love with the realms charged to them. She understands that, now; it's easy for them to take a mortal woman or man, dance in a human skin for a few weeks while nurturing a quick love affair.Their realms need little tending, are not streaming with new arrivals to situate and old rivalries and squabbles to settle. Hades has never forgotten his responsibilities. And neither does she. \"It suits you,\" he says. \"Could say the same for your suit,\" she replies, squeezing his hand as she beckons the first shade to approach for judging. Hand in hand, they weigh out the final justice of the underworld for thousands of new arrivals. Once her most hated duty, now simply one of many. The reaping, she has found, is as important as the sowing; the beginning as important as the end. For is it not true that though her husband once married her without her will, that he has not tried for the past millennium to make her allotment better? Is it not Hades, the eldest, who received the least-wanted realm but the deepest riches? Such creatures as them are prone to taking the long view, and their judgments of humans are no different: every person is a contradiction, more complex than mother's morality or father's fancies. Their people come from everywhere, at every age -- though fewer children this year, she notes with approval. It is a good start to the half-year: no souls are Tartarus-bound, not yet. And though there is no sun and no sky down here, she sees each clearly. She isn't aware of how much the unused muscles tax her until she realizes her legs ache and her heart burns. She has not to say a word of her distress; Hades grabs her hand and leads her back to their home. It's different every year, their home, as he keeps trying to refine it to her interests. This year, it is a cottage in a field-maze thousands of miles along; emeralds and citrine taking the place of the cornstalk and wheat. It is a monumentally beautiful scene, one even stone-cold Aphrodite would weep for it had a man done this for her. It moves Persephone's heart to pity. He is, she knows, afraid that she will leave, that one year she will simply not return and Zeus will shrug his shoulders and say that Hades has had his chance. It will not happen - Persephone, too, has her responsibilities. But it is easy to forget that, she knows: she is her father's daughter, as much as he is her father's brother. Capriciousness is in their blood. She reaches out and opens the door; rich wood from a tree so old she cannot even name it anymore. She crooks a finger and leads him in; he shuts the door quickly and presses his long face to her neck, his stern facade crumbling into a hidden passion. She folds fingers into his unruly hair as his beard scratches her cheek and is rewarded with a whimper. It is the most mysterious part of winter for her; how even the smallest of touches seems to produce such a powerful response in him. His fingers fumble for the lantern - he doesn't need it, but she needs the light for the moment and he needs her. Flame sparks quickly in their lantern - and of course, it still is a lantern, for he keeps to the old ways. She doesn't complain; she likes the warmth. It's still always cold down here. She can see her breath, and holding him brings little warmth to her. Though he blocks most of the view, she can see plants in terracotta planters. She reaches out to touch a leaf, suspicious, and chuckles as she hits synthetic leaves. \"I tried the real ones first, but...\" Hades says, by way of apology, and she sees it all too clearly: the king of the dead, panicking in a huddle of brown leaves thanks to Demeter's curse, and it makes her a bit sad even if she chuckles. She feels the shadow of a smile on her throat as he nuzzles her. \"Thankfully, Hermes can prove useful. If chatty.\" \"He's always chatty.\" She strokes his cheek. \"It's part of his role, you know.\" \"Mm. So it is.\" He changes the topic as he breaks away from her for the first time, pulling a long slice of iron from the soil and refining it into a knife. \"How's your mother?\" \"Still mad,\" she says, creating a pomegranate from nothing. \"You're still 'that man' to her, you know.\" \"Demeter always did hold grudges,\" he says, watching her split the pomegranate with his knife. Certain rituals must always be done; this tells them how much time they'll have. Seeds spill out: five perfect arils fall into her hands. An early spring, then. It satisfies her, but she sees him flinch a bit, so she holds up a finger, gently procuring the sixth aril. \"Careful,\" he whispers, but his lips twitch into a rare smile. \"My younger brother is rather fond of his rules, you know.\" \"Our secret,\" she says, eating all six before he can talk her out of it. The pomegranate vanishes; if Zeus has a quibble with her actions, he chooses to ignore it. There are no thunderclaps down here. Zeus hasn't seen her since the drawing of lots between her husband and her mother anyway. She does not mind. There are worse fates with Zeus than to be his neglected child. And it is better to be a neglected child, she thinks, than a neglected wife. Hades' arms circle around her and she feels comfort; as comfortable as one can be in a death-god's cold embrace. \"Come to bed?\" Hades asks, voice heavy with love. She swallows and nods. He warms at her touch, grabbing her hand easily; she has gotten better at not flinching at the coldness. The mixing of their fingers as he leads her feels somewhat profane as he leads her back to their bed. He lights the lantern with a wave of his hand; petals are strewn on her bed. Rose petals, just plucked. It's another bit of home in a land so far away, and nothing he could have done for himself. It's a romantic gesture, but a damn sad one. \"Hermes again?\" She asks, sitting down and delighting in the smell of roses as she holds petals to her nose. She misses flowers already, will miss them for months now. She savors it and he watches her for a long moment, saying nothing. \"He has his uses,\" he says finally. His eyes are wet and soft, and his hands are shoved in two fists, and she knows he wants, more than anything, to touch her. And though doing so will destroy his gift, she wants him to; wants to hear him whimper and cry and break against her, to be her partner and hold her as she tries to forget everything she loves above: mother, the trees, the flowers. She wishes her mother and husband could have made a better compromise; she wishes neither was so uncompromising. She wants to take him to the ocean-shore, claim him upon the waves as her own. She wishes mother would come here, to the shores of the Styx, at least; wishes that they could feast on the sweet fruits of the eternal harvest in asphodel and light. But she has long given up on dreams such as this. She lays down in his roses, smiling deeply as he stands above her. It's only then that she notices the mural above her that he's made -- a lantern glowing in bright topaz, the flames light in rubies, and all around them shining onyx. Of all the copious displays of his affection, this one is the one that tightens her throat. She thinks of him working along these six months, pulling minerals and ore from the earth, bedecking an entire realm just to try to make it tolerable for her. \"You look lovely,\" he says, quiet as always. She wonders if he sees his handiwork shining in her eyes. \"Then come to bed,\" she says. \"What are you waiting for?\" \"They'll die. I wanted - I wanted you to have a bit of above, for a while at least. I can't -- \" \"Come,\" she says, curling a finger. He is her husband, and her friend, and once her abductor, too, but in the realm of their bed, she has always held all the control. \"Your queen commands.\" With that, he needs no further permission to crawl into her bed; the roses crumple under her, their sweet scent turning cloying as they blow away. She catches the frown on his face, and reaches up, planting one hand on his iron cheek. \"Kiss me, husband. I have missed you,\" she says, and then he is on her. He presses a kiss to her lips, and life and death intertwine in their bed: shoots of flowers blossom around her, decay, and crumple to dust. His kisses taste of mossy caverns, dry plains. It is a bittersweet commingling; their bed is a sterile one, yet their union is but part of the fertility dance of the land above: things grow, die, and grow again. But here, nothing grows but the heart. And perhaps that is enough, she thinks, running her arms across his back as he kisses her like a man in the grips of a fervent prayer, as she scratches her fingers through the death god's back and hears him cry out her name.

      "Last time, she walked back down from a cursed sea of trees, embracing souls who got lost along the way and leading them home.",
      "The year before, she found the path to the underworld through the forest on the Rhine, gathering pine needles and fir twigs to decorate Hades' hearth with.",

      "It calls to her, as one path always does.",
      "This one is winding through old, impossibly old mountains.",

      "Her husband buried them far from Mount Olympus, their massive bodies distorting the earth above.",
      "The hectonchaires are there still: the original tenants, deep in these mountains.",

      "Sometimes, she stops walking and presses a hand down to the moist ground, feels the warmth of their breath in the damp soil as they turn, hungry-mouthed, toward Persephone Carpophorus, the fruit-bearer -- but she does not allow them to surface.",
      "It is not yet time for them to meet.",
      "Instead, she stands and dusts off her fingers.",
      "She resumes her trek, walking down the mountain lands of what is now Kentucky (how funny a sound, she thinks; this year, she mumbles it under her breath as she walks the trail, Ken-tuck-ee, Ken-tuck-ee, Ken-tuck-ee).",
      "She has been here before, of course -- like mankind, Persephone is a wanderer at heart.",

      "Most of them who come no longer keep the old ways, but fortunately Persephone has many names, and she recognizes all her children.",
      "She is growing closer to the point where she will become, once more, the queen of the realm; the barking of her dog alerting her to her approach as he keeps the shades on the straight path.",
      "Once, she had feared Hades dog; but now, she knows the dog would allow her passage.",
      "As if to prove the point, Kerberos barks happily at her return; the shades filter past him quickly, perhaps relieved she occupies the dog's time.",
      "The dog of hell flops onto his belly and she pets him; like most things in Hades' realm, the dog is far less fearsome in her presence.",
      "It scares her still, sometimes, the power she has here; she is Hades' equal, in a way neither Hera nor Amphitrite is in their own realm.",
      "At the end of the hall of gilded earth, the path widens unto the shores of the river Styx.",
      "This year, Hades has painted the shoreline with strange, silver sand for her; an approximation of an ocean from a man who has never been to one.",

      "She presses coins into shades' palms, emptying Charon's shores of the stragglers.",
      "She could go ahead of her subjects, but, because their fear is visible on sniveling noses and wide eyes, she nods toward Charon to take them first.",
      "Let them see that not all deathless gods are cruel; rigid, yes, but not unmerciful.",
      "It takes a few trips for him to ferry them over to Hades' shore and she makes a note of the delay; she will tell Hades it keeps her from him longer, and see if that is enough to make his unyielding heart melt.",

      "When she had asked, once, whether he regretted earning her mother's wrath, he said it did not matter.",
      "He did not much care for the above ground, anyway.",
      "That had been that.",
      "She supposed Demeter might -- might -- let him go to Olympus, but neither of them has ever been fond of Olympus.",
      "In a way, it is a mercy she ended up here - she cannot imagine what it would be to be Apollo, Aries, or Athena's wife; she has no patience for the family disputes, and they all cheat at Petteia anyway.",
      "In so many ways, she knows, she was lucky.",
      "But, still, she thinks, it would have been nice to be asked if she had wanted to rule such a dark place, if anyone had ever thought to ask what she wanted in the brokerage of her marriage.",
      "She was taken against her will, and perhaps the fault is hers for never asking mother to speak of her match (for Demeter would never give her willingly), or Hades fault for taking her without mother's permission, or mother's fault for never telling her what she was always meant to be, or father Zeus' fault for...really, many, many things, but most importantly of all, not communicating to any of them.",
      "She shook her head.",
      "She should not focus on things so long-gone; her abduction was very long ago.",
      "She has made her peace with her fate.",
      "Mostly.",
      "She looks at the impressive waves in the silver soil Hades has crafted for her as Styx burbles at the shore.",
      "Styx does not exactly lap at the shore, for it does not behave like the water above.",
      "It is water, all right, but it is brackish and cloudy and full of oaths and secrets.",
      "She drops a toe in and it fizzes and bubbles around her; she does not walk further in.",
      "Once, she thought it bubbled because she was an above-creature trespassing upon its wet abode, but now she knows that isn't the case.",
      "It is meant to be a comfort; a bit of the above welcoming her back to the down below.",
      "The clapping of an oar on a boat diverts her attention; Charon finally has room for her.",
      "\"Good to have you back,\" Charon says when she finally boards the boat.",
      "He had once been far more taciturn, but since she gives him the majority of his trade these days, his attitude has become far more subservient to her.",
      "\"Slow days, without ye.\"",
      "\"Ah,\" she says; she offers an obol, though he, of course, takes her for free.",
      "She does not say it is good to be back, for the gloomy halls and hallow spaces leave little room for joy.",
      "Already she misses the sun, the seas, and the sand: the crumbles of silver, the gloomy churn of Lethe and Styx, and even the low lights ensconced in golden flowers cannot compare to the sheer variety of natural life and light her mother has prepared up above.",
      "It is not a right and natural place, the underworld, and Hades tries and tries and tries to make the majesty measure up to the up above and never quite makes it right.",
      "But she does, as always, appreciate the effort.",
      "She feels the leaves caught in her clothing crumble as she and the boatman row their way toward the city of Dis in agreeable silence.",
      "True to form, he says nothing as her clothing transforms, her chthonic powers coming to bear; green turtleneck and practical jeans becoming the familiar peplos and chiton.",
      "These, she wears for him: he has always preferred the older style.",
      "\"Welcome home, Persephone Praxidike,\" Charon says as they breach the other side of that silver shore.",
      "He holds his hat in his hands as she stands upon her lands, a sign of respect that she acknowledges with a small nod.",
      "She is severe, as befits a queen, and he does not expect more than her nod in return.",
      "With age has come acceptance of who she is, what she is, what she must be.",
      "She is the Praxidike, exactor of justice.",
      "That is the problem of being a part-time underworld god, she thinks: no matter how she feels, she has her duties to attend to.",
      "And so does her husband.",
      "-3- The road to the city of Dis is shorter than humans think it is.",
      "There are so many stories of it being a hard and difficult climb, surrounded by hazards, and none of them are true.",
      "Every year her walk here is a bit different; the six months she goes up to the surface, Hades goes crazy, tries to find more and more ways to make it more to her liking.",
      "He tries hard.",
      "She cannot fault him for that.",
      "This year, it is a cozy village road, with lapis lazuli and sapphire skies and diamond moons.",
      "It reminds her of her girlhood in the Elysium fields, and she is sure that is in the intention.",
      "Her heart tugs as she thinks of Hades, six months alone, painting the world under the world just for her.",
      "It is almost welcoming, in that anything in this strange world is welcoming.",
      "He has done a great deal to it since she first came on the back of his chariot, all those years ago.",
      "When she first came to the underworld, it was black, blacker than darkness itself.",
      "He hadn't bothered to form anything to his realm, not then.",
      "He'd had no muse before her.",
      "She had screamed, and wailed, and beat against his helmet and his breastplate, and hard-hearted Hades had not let her go, had told her their marriage had been arranged with her father, but she saw only blackness for his realm: it was dark, and it was cold.",
      "She'd put her hand up from his chariot and she'd seen it vanish into the pitch and she had screamed, startled.",
      "His arm had wrapped around her waist, as oppressive as it was comforting, and she'd fainted.",
      "This is the first memory she has always held of them: her kidnapping, her weakness.",
      "But her second memory is truer of what she has known of him as his wife: by the time she awoke, he had created torches, installed bronziers of hardened ore with bits of the Phlegethon.",
      "At the time, it was a mark of how alien he was to her, to need to make adjustments to a realm just so she could see her barren new home.",
      "Now, she understands: having been below since time immortal, her uncle-husband's eyes had adjusted to the darkness.",
      "It had been an oversight, nothing more; perhaps the same was true of her marriage charter.",
      "Her eyes had gotten used to the darkness, and his gentleness too.",
      "It had simply taken her a long time to see either, unaccustomed as she was to looking for it.",
      "She drifts through the city's streets, admiring his handiwork this year in what passes for the gardens of the dead.",
      "It is more sparse at the ground versus what he has made of their (lack of) sky; copper mushrooms and granite turnips brush against the asphodel and dirt path through the city, and she allows a few to become real, nourishing nightcaps and buttonshades.",
      "It's a frivolous waste of power - they will die, as all things down here die.",
      "Except herself and her husband, of course.",
      "Not them, never them; king and queen eternal when all the other Gods will be laid to waste, the eldest son inheriting the final kingdom.",
      "When her father made her queen here, he sealed her eternal responsibilities: she will live long after every Olympian dies.",
      "She does not look forward to her lord father becoming one of their many guests; Zeus will find it odd to find himself him without a castle.",
      "She knows there is a chance he will endevour to take her husband's place, but between uncle and father, she knows where her loyalties will lie -- though such will bring her mother to weep.",
      "Hades has no grand castle.",
      "He has never quite enjoyed ostentation in that way, which she appreciates.",
      "She had no patience for her father's grandstanding as a small child hiding by her mother's skirts; she has less patience still, now.",
      "She walks up the cliff face past dozens of souls, who part for her in reverent grace or confused shuffling.",
      "It is not Olympus in its golden glory; this is a more natural path, one simple incline to a cliff upon which sits two chairs and three staircases, each a path to a different land within their land.",
      "On the other end of the cliff is eternal darkness, primordial and terrifying.",
      "She does not look down into that deep and eternal pit as she climbs.",
      "There are some steps even Gods fear to tread.",
      "She feels the ichor in her veins sing, as it always does when she is close to him.",
      "It is a reminder from the fates of their destiny-thread; wound together until the very end of the time.",
      "She comes to the top of his hill and she finds him, her heart speeding a bit at the sight of her husband on his own throne.",
      "He has been working hard, she sees immediately; he is pale, skin mottled like marble, eyes hard as flint and yet they turn to softness at the sight of her.",
      "He's dressed in a more modern style for her - a black suit, with a black tie, and black shoes and socks and no doubt black pocket square tucked in his suit jacket.",
      "Color is something he loves but struggles to replicate outside of his stones.",
      "His eyes take in her look, and though he is too stern to smile, she feels the warmth of his heart as his hand delicately reaches for her own.",
      "\"I missed you,\" he says, in a low and deep murmur.",
      "His voice is as dry leaves upon empty paths, and she wavers not at all as she takes her place beside him.",
      "Her throne is threaded with golden vines this year, she notes; she wonders, sometimes, if he still feels guilty for how she came here and what she gave up to stay.",
      "She takes his hand, the closest to a kiss he'll ever give her in public.",
      "\"Thank you for the flower,\" she whispers, and sees the hand of the king shiver in hers in return.",
      "He loves her with a more brilliant and electric love than father Zeus loves Hera, than Poseidon loves Amphitrite.",
      "Their gazes wander; they fall too far in love with the realms charged to them.",
      "She understands that, now; it's easy for them to take a mortal woman or man, dance in a human skin for a few weeks while nurturing a quick love affair.Their realms need little tending, are not streaming with new arrivals to situate and old rivalries and squabbles to settle.",
      "Hades has never forgotten his responsibilities.",
      "And neither does she.",
      "\"It suits you,\" he says.",
      "\"Could say the same for your suit,\" she replies, squeezing his hand as she beckons the first shade to approach for judging.",
      "Hand in hand, they weigh out the final justice of the underworld for thousands of new arrivals.",
      "Once her most hated duty, now simply one of many.",
      "The reaping, she has found, is as important as the sowing; the beginning as important as the end.",
      "For is it not true that though her husband once married her without her will, that he has not tried for the past millennium to make her allotment better?",
      "Is it not Hades, the eldest, who received the least-wanted realm but the deepest riches?",
      "Such creatures as them are prone to taking the long view, and their judgments of humans are no different: every person is a contradiction, more complex than mother's morality or father's fancies.",
      "Their people come from everywhere, at every age -- though fewer children this year, she notes with approval.",
      "It is a good start to the half-year: no souls are Tartarus-bound, not yet.",
      "And though there is no sun and no sky down here, she sees each clearly.",
      "She isn't aware of how much the unused muscles tax her until she realizes her legs ache and her heart burns.",
      "She has not to say a word of her distress; Hades grabs her hand and leads her back to their home.",
      "It's different every year, their home, as he keeps trying to refine it to her interests.",
      "This year, it is a cottage in a field-maze thousands of miles along; emeralds and citrine taking the place of the cornstalk and wheat.",
      "It is a monumentally beautiful scene, one even stone-cold Aphrodite would weep for it had a man done this for her.",
      "It moves Persephone's heart to pity.",
      "He is, she knows, afraid that she will leave, that one year she will simply not return and Zeus will shrug his shoulders and say that Hades has had his chance.",
      "It will not happen - Persephone, too, has her responsibilities.",
      "But it is easy to forget that, she knows: she is her father's daughter, as much as he is her father's brother.",
      "Capriciousness is in their blood.",
      "She reaches out and opens the door; rich wood from a tree so old she cannot even name it anymore.",
      "She crooks a finger and leads him in; he shuts the door quickly and presses his long face to her neck, his stern facade crumbling into a hidden passion.",
      "She folds fingers into his unruly hair as his beard scratches her cheek and is rewarded with a whimper.",
      "It is the most mysterious part of winter for her; how even the smallest of touches seems to produce such a powerful response in him.",
      "His fingers fumble for the lantern - he doesn't need it, but she needs the light for the moment and he needs her.",
      "Flame sparks quickly in their lantern - and of course, it still is a lantern, for he keeps to the old ways.",
      "She doesn't complain; she likes the warmth.",
      "It's still always cold down here.",
      "She can see her breath, and holding him brings little warmth to her.",
      "Though he blocks most of the view, she can see plants in terracotta planters.",
      "She reaches out to touch a leaf, suspicious, and chuckles as she hits synthetic leaves.",
      "\"I tried the real ones first, but...\" Hades says, by way of apology, and she sees it all too clearly: the king of the dead, panicking in a huddle of brown leaves thanks to Demeter's curse, and it makes her a bit sad even if she chuckles.",
      "She feels the shadow of a smile on her throat as he nuzzles her.",
      "\"Thankfully, Hermes can prove useful.",
      "If chatty.\"",
      "\"He's always chatty.\"",
      "She strokes his cheek.",
      "\"It's part of his role, you know.\"",
      "\"Mm.",
      "So it is.\"",
      "He changes the topic as he breaks away from her for the first time, pulling a long slice of iron from the soil and refining it into a knife.",
      "\"How's your mother?\"",
      "\"Still mad,\" she says, creating a pomegranate from nothing.",
      "\"You're still 'that man' to her, you know.\"",
      "\"Demeter always did hold grudges,\" he says, watching her split the pomegranate with his knife.",
      "Certain rituals must always be done; this tells them how much time they'll have.",
      "Seeds spill out: five perfect arils fall into her hands.",
      "An early spring, then.",
      "It satisfies her, but she sees him flinch a bit, so she holds up a finger, gently procuring the sixth aril.",
      "\"Careful,\" he whispers, but his lips twitch into a rare smile.",
      "\"My younger brother is rather fond of his rules, you know.\"",
      "\"Our secret,\" she says, eating all six before he can talk her out of it.",
      "The pomegranate vanishes; if Zeus has a quibble with her actions, he chooses to ignore it.",
      "There are no thunderclaps down here.",
      "Zeus hasn't seen her since the drawing of lots between her husband and her mother anyway.",
      "She does not mind.",
      "There are worse fates with Zeus than to be his neglected child.",
      "And it is better to be a neglected child, she thinks, than a neglected wife.",
      "Hades' arms circle around her and she feels comfort; as comfortable as one can be in a death-god's cold embrace.",
      "\"Come to bed?\" Hades asks, voice heavy with love.",
      "She swallows and nods.",
      "He warms at her touch, grabbing her hand easily; she has gotten better at not flinching at the coldness.",
      "The mixing of their fingers as he leads her feels somewhat profane as he leads her back to their bed.",
      "He lights the lantern with a wave of his hand; petals are strewn on her bed.",
      "Rose petals, just plucked.",
      "It's another bit of home in a land so far away, and nothing he could have done for himself.",
      "It's a romantic gesture, but a damn sad one.",
      "\"Hermes again?\"",
      "She asks, sitting down and delighting in the smell of roses as she holds petals to her nose.",
      "She misses flowers already, will miss them for months now.",
      "She savors it and he watches her for a long moment, saying nothing.",
      "\"He has his uses,\" he says finally.",
      "His eyes are wet and soft, and his hands are shoved in two fists, and she knows he wants, more than anything, to touch her.",
      "And though doing so will destroy his gift, she wants him to; wants to hear him whimper and cry and break against her, to be her partner and hold her as she tries to forget everything she loves above: mother, the trees, the flowers.",
      "She wishes her mother and husband could have made a better compromise; she wishes neither was so uncompromising.",
      "She wants to take him to the ocean-shore, claim him upon the waves as her own.",
      "She wishes mother would come here, to the shores of the Styx, at least; wishes that they could feast on the sweet fruits of the eternal harvest in asphodel and light.",
      "But she has long given up on dreams such as this.",
      "She lays down in his roses, smiling deeply as he stands above her.",
      "It's only then that she notices the mural above her that he's made -- a lantern glowing in bright topaz, the flames light in rubies, and all around them shining onyx.",
      "Of all the copious displays of his affection, this one is the one that tightens her throat.",
      "She thinks of him working along these six months, pulling minerals and ore from the earth, bedecking an entire realm just to try to make it tolerable for her.",
      "\"You look lovely,\" he says, quiet as always.",
      "She wonders if he sees his handiwork shining in her eyes.",
      "\"Then come to bed,\" she says.",
      "\"What are you waiting for?\"",
      "\"They'll die.",
      "I wanted - I wanted you to have a bit of above, for a while at least.",
      "I can't -- \" \"Come,\" she says, curling a finger.",
      "He is her husband, and her friend, and once her abductor, too, but in the realm of their bed, she has always held all the control.",
      "\"Your queen commands.\"",
      "With that, he needs no further permission to crawl into her bed; the roses crumple under her, their sweet scent turning cloying as they blow away.",
      "She catches the frown on his face, and reaches up, planting one hand on his iron cheek.",
      "\"Kiss me, husband.",
      "I have missed you,\" she says, and then he is on her.",
      "He presses a kiss to her lips, and life and death intertwine in their bed: shoots of flowers blossom around her, decay, and crumple to dust.",
      "His kisses taste of mossy caverns, dry plains.",
      "It is a bittersweet commingling; their bed is a sterile one, yet their union is but part of the fertility dance of the land above: things grow, die, and grow again.",
      "But here, nothing grows but the heart.",
      "And perhaps that is enough, she thinks, running her arms across his back as he kisses her like a man in the grips of a fervent prayer, as she scratches her fingers through the death god's back and hears him cry out her name.",
      "Perhaps in the darkness, a gentle hand holding a lantern will be enough."

    "text": "They both lied sideways on the bed, with Hebe wrapped up in her brother's protective embrace. Her face buries itself against the stack of blankets and pillows, as she could feel Ares thrust into her with languid movement. She calls out his name softly, repeatedly, until it turned raspy and got lost amidst her moans. \"Br-brother...\" Hebe whimpers, squirming under him. \"No... pl-please...\" He breathes out a chuckle, the sound of his voice low and rich like the night. \"And yet, your body's telling me otherwise,\" he nuzzles his cheeks against hers, running small pecks upon it. As if to prove his point, he grinds deeper into her, then leering when Hebe's cries became louder. \"Oh, see? You actually love it when I do it like this, don't you?\" \"All y-your... fault... a-ahh! Mmh...\" \"Heh, yet, it seems you've become just as insatiable. Here, look how much you're dripping for me.\" The war god slithers a hand down between her legs, and fingers the rim of her folds. The way they're split open resembles a bird landing upon a flower, and seeking for that sweet nectar it holds. He's planted deeply inside her, throbbing, feeling her wet lips continue to welcome him more and more. The sounds of their flesh pounding against each other is like wondrous music to him, never tiring of it no matter how many times he's made love to her. Suddenly, Ares pauses in his ministrations. He takes a moment to observe his sister, who laid there in all her wanton glory. Even as children, he was always taken by Hebe's beauty-- with those gentle eyes and soft waves of hair that fell across her breasts, her nipples pink and perky from his touches. And those lips, gods, nothing felt better than her lips-- all pleased mewls and tender kisses, and shy licks of her tongue while deep-throating his member. Not even Aphrodite, his most frequenting paramour, could incite this kind of excitement in Ares like Hebe can. \"Brother? Is something the matter?\" The goddess of youth's voice then brings him out of his thoughts. He blinks at her a few times, before donning a playful smirk. \"Yes? Waiting for me, are you?\" She pouts. \"Must you always tease... oh!\" before she could react, he decided to promptly flip their positions, so that she was now atop of him. \"O-ohh...!\" His large, soldier's hands grip her waist tightly, and now fucked her just like that. Hebe bounces up and down on his dick, her brother's roughness of her causing her to moan uncontrollably. \"Ahh...! A-Ares...!\" \"Heh, like it? Do you feel like coming?\" \"Y-yes...! Oh, yes... in-inside...!\" \"Come with me, then, sister.\" Ares was able to finally grant her wish after several more, deep thrusts. Loud, high-pitched sobs escape from her as she climaxes, and trembled like mad when his essence spills into her. It felt so good, gods, it always does-- to love and become one with her most cherished person. Honestly, there's nothing else in her eternal life that she could ask for better. Thoroughly spent, Hebe collapsed onto the other in exhaustion. While she busied herself with catching her breath, Ares was caressing her and whispering praises to her. She cuddles to him even closer in response, a warm, blushing smile on her face. \"Night, brother...\" \"Sleep well, my love.\" And for all until the morning, they continued to stay like that within one another's embrace, both content and full of love.",

    "text": "The first time someone calls him beautiful he cries. Unable to stop the tears that fall and fall. (Even then his love calls him beautiful.) They hold each other the rest of the night; beautiful, beautiful, being whispered in his ear until he falls asleep. Beautiful had a different meaning then, it meant i love your tragic smile and that fiery hair. It meant, I'm not in love with you, I'm in love with how you look. He didn't realise this until later and then he cried for a different reason. The second time someone calls him beautiful he laughs, a bitter and empty thing. He still does not believe it, does not believe he is a person worthy of the word, but still his love whispers to him: \" you're so beautiful.\" He leaves as soon as the sun has risen; his heart in his throat, tears pricking his eyes as he chokes on the pieces. Beautiful here meant broken. Meant, i'm sorry you're broken, I'm sorry you love me, I'm sorry that it has to end like this. Beautiful here was synonymous with leaving, with heartache. The third time someone calls him beautiful he smiles, coolly replying, \" i know. \" This time it isn't special and he knows it; the other body in his bed is simply using him. \" you're absolutely stunning, \" choked out between gritted teeth, short nails leaving scratches down his back. After they are done he cries, letting his golden wings fall limply behind him. Here he had no illusions that beautiful meant anything other than: you're a good fuck. It was written in the scratches down his back and the bruises on his throat, you're only good for sex. He gets used to this meaning of beautiful, hearing it often enough when strangers warm his bed. The fourth time someone calls him beautiful he doesn't reply, not verbally, instead he presses his lips against theirs in a hungry kiss. He is empty and full of so much tragedy, so much sorrow, so much love. They kiss until he pulls away, breathless and face flushed a cherry red. He leaves then and there. He is a starving god and he knows this, he knows that he is hungry, wanting, for the one thing he can't have for himself. This is the last time he kisses a stranger for the fun of it. He doesn't stay long enough to hear this meaning of beautiful. Nor does he care. It doesn't fill the emptiness in his chest or set his heart aflame. Beautiful was a word and nothing more.... The first time she calls him beautiful he feels something. Like his heart has been set on fire. He is speechless for a long moment, the only sound between them the beats of their hearts. Love me, they seem to say. Love me, Love me. He stammers, running long fingers through his hair and staring at her. When he tells her she's beautiful too, he really means i love you. When she says he's beautiful, she means it. She doesn't mean you're only good for sex, or i only love you for your looks, or i wish you would fuck me. She calls him beautiful and it damn near brings him to tears.... The first time he calls him beautiful, the meaning is lost in translation. It is lost in a mess of confusing feelings that the word causes, especially coming from him. The god of healing, who only seems to succeed in breaking his heart again and again. They hate each other, or so it seems, and beautiful could have meant so many things. He never suspected it meant beautiful. They fight for hours, voices raised and hearts beating out of their chests. He screams, i hate you! But they both know I hate you doesn't mean i hate you, it means: im scared of how much I love you. They kiss after this, burning and hungry - I love you / you're beautiful - and it's like an explosion.... Now, he knows what beautiful means. It means: I love you, heart and soul, from Psyche as she runs her fingers along his golden wings, making him shiver. It means: I love you so much, despite our past, from Apollo as he presses gentle kisses between his shoulder blades, making him sigh with pleasure.",

Do not worry, though, for they are young and still learning thier spears. They will return.\" Hypnos gave Thanatos a sleepy smile, and placed his own hand over his brother's. \"Yes, I suppose so. I should go back to Pasithea and tell her this.\" And so, now free of worry and mostly eclipsed by weariness, the god of sleep disappeared into the darkness, and the god of death let off a sharp-toothed smile as he watched him go. / They blended in with the pale, cold colors of the boy's room. White-gray hair, bright blue eyes, Morpheus was merely watching the boy in his sleeping state. \"Morpheus,\" said the boy, opening his eyes and reaching out to run his hand over the godling's pale face. \"you're still here.\" \"I am always here,\" the godling responded, taking the boy's hand and brushing thier lips against it. \"watching over you.\" \"You must leave, before my father wakes and makes you.\" The boy whispered, shuddering -- it was not because of the cold. \"I must,\" -- a kiss to his palm -- \"do no,\" -- to the inside of his wrist -- \"such thing.\" -- leaning forward to press one to his neck. \"I am a god, he can do nothing to me.\" \"Do not hurt him, my Dreamer, please.\" The boy -- the demigod, perhaps? -- pleaded, softly, leaning to kiss the godling's cheek. \"If you do not want it so, then it will not be.\" Morpheus promised, kissing the boy's lips. \"Sleep, youthful Maliki, I'll keep my brothers, and your monsters, away.\" The boy, now surely a demigod, stared for a moment at his godly lover and then his eyelids fluttered close. / \"He is mine! Mine, dark Morpheus, do you understand?\" Hebe sobbed, electricity sparking in the air around the goddess of youth. \"You can not have him!\" The godling of dreams lifted thier chin, determined not to give thier feelings for the demigod up. \"Please, gentle Hebe, please. I love... I love him.\" The goddess of youth made a strangled noise in the back of her throat, and stood up straight. Her sobs ceased. \"Do you, really, love him as you say?\" \"Yes,\" breathed Morpheus, thier fingers curled into fists. \"Yes, I love him as I say.\" Hebe let free a soft sigh, and tapped her fingers against thier cheek. \"I beg you, do not turn my son into a tragedy, Morpheus.\" They let out an unsteady breath. \"I won't,\" they promised, \"I won't, I won't.\" They cried, dropping thier head against her shoulder. / He laughed against thier skin, thier fingers digging into his sides as he kissed them. \"Morpheus,\" the boy said, his voice feather-light and breathless, \"tell me something amazing.\" They laughed, leaning up to kiss the boy hungrily. \"You,\" they muttered, \"you, you.\" Maliki pushed them away to stare at their face, so very close to his own. \"Tell me something else.\" \"I love you,\" and Morpheus kissed him again, softer, \"and I shall always love you.\" The boy ran his fingers through thier hair, pulling away again, \"What of when I die?\" \"I shall love you still,\" the godling whispered, and made to kiss him again. The boy shoved him lightly, and they fell from the bed, \"No, you can not, you must not.\" The godling suddenly angered and growled, thier eyes narrowing, \"You do not tell me what I must not do.\" And then he was alone, inside the pale colors of his room, he was alone. / There were two long, deep scratches on his arm and his leg. \"Morpheus,\" he choked out and he was not alone. They appeared instantly, thier eyes cutting straight to the wounds he had aquired, \"You stupid boy.\" \"I did not,\" -- he winced, closing his eyes -- \"mean to.\" The godling's gaze softened, and they knelt to place a hand on the wounds. \"You can not heal me, I know.\" the boy bit out, but they stopped him sharply, \"You do not tell me what I can not do.\" The demigod laughed weakly, and lifted his hand -- bloody and sweaty and weak as he was -- to brush the godling's hair out of his eyes. Morpheus kissed his blood soaked palm. \"You do not get to leave me, I promised her.\" Maliki smiled at his godly lover, \"She will understand,\" and let out a shaky breath and then breathed no more. The god of dreams did not move, besides for their fingers which curled around the dark locks and the tears that feel from thier nose. / The voice from the darkness was almost gentle when it called thier name. \"Morpheus.\" Thanatos stood by the trees, the familiar scent of smoke and death drifting off him in waves. \"Morpheus,\" the death god said again, softer, \"Morpheus, what have you done?\" They shook thier head, arms curling tighter around the dead boy's shoulders. \"I loved him, Uncle. I loved him and it killed him. / Falling in love with a god is not a death sentence, the story is only a tragedy if the god loves you back.",

    "text": "I. Out of all that swam the vast oceans or crashed across the lightning brightened sky or haunted the dark depths of the earth, there was only one thing that the King of Hades feared, and that was her. He feared Persephone because she looked at him as no one else ever had. She looked at him without fear, and with something else in her eyes that Hades could not name. The death god can be forgiven thinking he could chase her off. He did not know enough of life to know what that look meant, but Persephone soon taught him. II. It's true, Persephone ran from Hades, but she ran to her father. She clasped Zeus's knees. She pled with hard reason and soft sighs as only a favored child can. Zeus was weak before his daughter's pleas. Perhaps he felt the pull of the Fates tugging Persephone toward Hades. Zeus gave his consent. He agreed on the condition that Persephone never tell her mother of their bargain. Perhaps Persephone thought that making her mother sad for awhile was worth having a husband for eternity, but she agreed. With that promise, the fate of earth and all beneath it was decided. III. Persephone went back to a meadow of green and growing things, where she knew Hades would have to come, for all that is young and beautiful has to yield itself up to time and death, except the gods. Hades came in his chariot and cast his shadow upon Persephone. He watched her eyes grow wide and expected her to run away again. When she ran to him, leaping into his chariot with the fierce grace of an Amazon, Hades was unready. She took the reins from his weakened grasp and drove the chariot of death beneath the earth by herself. IV. It was not until he was back within the misty darkness of his own kingdom did the death god realize that Persephone had stolen his chariot and him. He thundered at her, loud and angry enough to prove himself Zeus's brother. The spirits of the dead quaked. But Persephone laughed. It was the first laughter Hades ever heard. The look she saw on his face made her laugh louder. He was red with rage when she kissed him. Her lips were soft. Her breasts were soft too, when she pressed herself against him. And, at least, she had stopped laughing. V. He let her slide her hand beneath his garments, and wrap her hand around the part where even a god is only a man. She felt him shiver at her touch. She saw that he trembled as much from fear as lust. The daughter of Zeus was pitiless. Persephone wanted Hades. She wanted all that he was, and all that he had, and she wanted him inside her. So, she pressed him back against the flame-licked ground of hell, and she made to take him. Nothing surprised her more than his hand holding her back. Hades looked no less surprised. VI. Hades asked her if she were sure this was what she wanted. He asked if she would stay with him forever among the shadows under the earth. Her smile was honey sweet. She told him no. Hades understood then that she was crueler than death to smile so while she broke his heart. To his credit, he took the answer like a decent man, not a vengeful god. He nodded in understanding. Hades tried to push her off, but Persephone would not be moved. Just because you cannot have a thing always doesn't make it not worth having, she said. VII. Let me show you, she said coaxingly. Here, perhaps, Clotho paused in her weaving. It was a moment when everything hung upon the thread of fate. If Persephone doubted her beauty or Hades' answer, she never showed it. Hades dark eyes were made darker with lust, but he made no answer. He searched for something in Persephone's face. Persephone realized what he sought, and gave it to him. She could not blush, but she lowered her eyelashes, as shyly and prettily as a maiden. Then she smiled, a true and honest smile. Clotho spun, and Hades breathed out his consent. VIII. After Persephone rode Hades toward a little death, and took her own pleasure too, she collapsed against his broad chest. Her clever fingers reached up to play with his sweat-damped curls. He pressed his cheek eagerly into her warm hand. She ventured to speak. I love the sunlight and the green and growing things too much to leave them forever, said Demeter's daughter. A sigh rattled in mighty Hades' chest. You will always come back? He did not sound mighty then, but like a child. Persephone began to not only desire and covet him, but love him. They exchanged yeses. IX. Persephone looked upon her pretty, stern-faced, gentle-handed lover. She rolled upon her back and looked to the ceiling where every precious jewel and metal found within the earth glittered down at her. She listened to the whisperings of the people of the other side, people she may yet be able to help because the other side was her side now. Then Persephone rejoiced. I was right to steal you, Persephone said. Hades groaned. You must never say so, he insisted. Better they think I stole you. Persephone laughed at the thought. That no one need be stolen occurred to neither. X. Much later, Persephone sealed their marriage contract as her father had instructed. She made an oath, and ate of the fruit of the underworld. She did not eat enough to require she remain always, but enough that she could return when she chose. Then she let Hades lick the red juices from her lips. All that she wanted in the world above and world below was hers, most especially him. Persephone came and went at her pleasure. While grief-stricken Demeter plunged the world into cold winter each time Persephone did, Persephone always chose to return to gentle Hades' warm embrace.",

    "text": "POV Persephone My name was Kore and I brought the spring. I was young when we first met, but not as young as They would have you believe. They still called me maiden then, but I was a woman, I knew what I was doing. You know, it's funny, I used to idolise them. They were so powerful, so bright. For a long time, I thought they could do no wrong. I clearly did not know them very well. It wasn't like I hadn't had relationships before him; I had. Until Demeter found out about them. People will tell you that she was just trying to protect me. Ignore them. They don't have a clue what they're talking about. Demeter was not a mother to me and I was not a daughter to her. I was just an asset, something that she could assign to do the work she didn't feel like doing. She was never outright cruel to me, but she definitely did not love me. I was a convenient tool for her usage, and for too long a time I remained blissfully ignorant of that. I remember the first time I sensed something was amiss. It was when I began to court Apollo. He was sweet, patient, and he was so very proud of each beautiful sunrise and sunset. And I was proud of him for it. One day she caught me smiling at the sunset and frowned. \"Why do you smile?\" she asked as if I was forbidden happiness; as if I did not have my own life; as if doing so required her permission. The next morning, she made sure that I had missed the sunrise, I wonder if she was jealous of the gift that Apollo had given me. From that point on she made sure I was always inside when Apollo was painting the sky. She kept me busy, she sent me to plant flowers and make them grow, the very next day she would send me to harvest them. The day after that she would send me to Hermes, to sell them. That was her mistake because Hermes and I got along like a house on fire. I would arrive with my wears, and we would haggle over the price. We spent days on end arguing, and I enjoyed every second of it. He was so clever and witty, such a charmer, but he was just as flighty as I and eventually we would grow bored of arguing over prices, we soon moved to other topics. I had not yet realised the pattern, so one day I came home skipping and smiling. The next time she sent me, Hermes was not there. Nor the time after that. Nor the time after that. She would still send me for flowers. But after Hermes, she began to send company with me, three water nymphs. I suppose she was trying to appease me either that or spy on me. They were nice enough, but I did not know them, I did not like them, I did not trust them. They were with me when I first saw it. It was beautiful. And this may sound like the ramblings of an old woman, but I knew. I knew somehow that this flower was mine. I called the nymphs over, I didn't know any better. \"Look,\" I said, \"look here, at this flower\" \"Oh Kore, you don't want that.\" They smirked at each other. \"Don't you know? That's a lonely flower\" They giggled and tittered at me. I didn't care. It made sense to me. A lonely flower for a lonely girl. So I plucked it, entwined it into my hair and continued in my task. The next time we went out, there were three. I picked them all, entwined them in my hair, next to the first. The time after that there was a whole meadow of Narcissus flowers. The girls stopped giggling. I smiled. Picked one. Entwined it in my hair. I would have put them all in if I could fit them. But no sooner had my fingers brushed the second when a great rumbling began. I had thought the flower was beautiful, but then I saw him, and no word of a lie I forgot how to breathe. He held out one pale hand, eyes dark. What could I do but take it? People will tell you that I screamed. That I cried. Ignore them. They don't have a clue what they're talking about. They say he seized me like a prisoner In truth, he seized me like an opportunity. POV Hades (See the end of the chapter for more notes.) Her name was Kore and she brought the spring. At first, I didn't have more than a passing awareness of her. She was just another child of Zeus's, and believe me, there wasn't exactly a short supply of those. She wasn't even regularly around Olympus. I assumed that she- just like me- didn't particularly care for the drama of other gods. Turns out her mum was nuts. Although I didn't find that out until later. Much later. She was young when I met her, not as young as everybody says, but young. And she stormed into my life with all of the passion of her youth, providing me with an essential part of myself I never knew was missing. I was lonely, you see. I didn't have a clue that I was, but I was. Look, my family has never been what you would consider stable. My father killed his father, married his sister and became king. He ruled well for a time until he realised that just as he killed his father for the throne, we might kill him. So he swallowed us in his paranoia. No literally, I spent the formative years of my life in his digestive tract. Not pretty. That is until mum got her head in gear and plotted with Zeus and Gaia to free us. She probably didn't anticipate Zeus starting a war and using our life debts to him to make us into his little toy soldiers. But you live and learn. So yeah, what I'm saying is, not the most stable family background. And the result was a bunch of messed up kids, I like to think that I'm the most stable of them, but emotions are tricky on a good day. So I was lonely but didn't realise it. I had Spot of course and all of my loyal court. But what I really needed was someone to share with, someone with intelligence, someone with a backbone. People say that I kidnapped her, lured her in and trapped her. People say that I did this with Zeus's permission. They're lying, I've never needed that idiot's permission to do anything. Really, I just wanted to try my hand at something other than death. The Narcissus flower is a little bit of a masterpiece if I do say so myself. (And I do.) I think I probably put a little bit too much of myself into it though, because when she picked it - I felt it. I went to see who had dared to claim my creation, and I was struck dumb when I saw her. The nymphs that were with her all looked uneasy, but she didn't. She was kneeling in the dirt tucking my work of art into her hair with this tiny little smile on her lips. I don't think I've ever been so curious as I was in that moment. So I did what came naturally. I fled. I kicked myself so hard when I got home that I still have a bruised shin. Then I came up with a genius idea. I made three more flowers, just - you know, to test the waters a little. And then I waited, and believe me I know what a stalker I sound like but I wasn't being creepy, I promise. I had it all planned out, you see. This time I was gonna talk to her, spout out a good chat-up line and hope for the best. I even had a few days to think about what line I would use. I was quite proud of \"Are you Prometheus in disguise? Cos baby you light my fire.\" But in the end, I decided to go with \"Hey girl, are you a child of Zeus? Cause you leave me thunderstruck.\" I figured it was more relatable. Yeah, I know, they're so bad it's painful, but I wanted to keep things light, not scare her off. I figured maybe she had thought the first flower was pretty but wouldn't care too much about the others. But when she showed up again a few days later not only did she pick the new ones, she still wore the first! It suited her. I like to tell myself that I'd been waiting for her to finish her work, that I didn't want to distract her. Yeah, I suck at lying. Even to myself. Truthfully I was terrified of being rejected, and I know how silly it sounds; the big scary Lord of the Underworld scared of being rejected by this tiny woman. You have to bear in mind that she was the first girl I'd ever flirted with. She would have been the last too, if not for the fact that- well, I didn't actually flirt with her. Nah, I turned tail and ran again. I actually think I still have a few hairs missing from where I pulled them out from frustration. I came back again the next day - of course I did! She wasn't there. So I figured she wasn't coming back. I was so angry with myself, why was I such a coward? Why couldn't I pluck up the courage to go over there and say hello? So then I decided that I probably wasn't cut out for this, planted another Meadow of Narcissus flowers, and went home. I didn't plan to come back. In fact, I had almost forgotten about her. Almost. Until a few days later she picked another flower. Then it gets kind of blurry. The next thing I remember, I was standing in my stupid chariot, holding out my hand like some lovestruck fool. Actually, you know what, that description sounds about right. I made her promise not to tell anyone this next part so she probably won't have told you, but that's when I opened my mouth. To this day I still have no idea what I was going to say, probably something stupid. But that doesn't matter because as soon as she put her hand in my palm, I swallowed my tongue. I almost choked to death. And trust me - as the Lord of the Underworld - I can appreciate the irony. People say that she screamed, that she cried. They probably think they're telling the truth too. But I kid you not she was laughing, the only tears on her face were ones of mirth. By the Fates I love her. Disclaimer: I didn't come up with the pickup lines. Kudos to whoever did.Fun fact, Hades' hound is called Cerberus which comes from the root word Kerberos|Kerberos meaning spotted. Essentially, Hades named his dog Spot.

The sunlight caresses your cheek, and you turn your face up to the sun's warmth and know that he is watching you. Your father would not approve. Your father has picked out a nice girl from the village, or at least he had back when you could still walk freely. Your father curses the gods, sometimes. Quietly, with a fierce anger you do not understand. Not that it matters much- there is only god you care about. It was the music that first drew you to him. Sweet strains of a lyre, melodies he pulled from the air just for you. His lips traced the shell of your ear and his fingers on the strings were his fingers inside of you, playing your heart as easily as breathing. And you fell, faster and harder than ever before and his touch was fire and his mouth branded you untouchable, undefeatable, immortal. Your father's fingers are bloody and shaking, and the feathers weigh heavy on your back. You look down the steep side of the tower you are trapped in and out across the wide ocean, blue and sparkling. Your father's hands push you into the air, and suddenly you are soaring, you are flying free and the air is kissing you, holding you, laughing with you as you swoop and skim the tops of the waves. The sun beats hot on your back, and the secret grows inside of you. Your heart pounds and the blood runs hot in your veins. You climb higher into the sky, ignore your father's warning shouts. The sun is hot and merciless, and the sky is wide around you and the sun is hot, hotter, it is searing through your thin shirt and burning the skin of your back, you look down and see liquid drops of wax falling and you are falling, you cannot hear your father's voice anymore. You fall for years. The wind rushing past is quiet. The wax has cooled and you feel it on your skin, hard and cold. You are cold. You close your eyes, and you are dark and cold, and still falling. The ocean is colder. You see red, and feel your bones break inside you, and what god has ever cared for a mortal? They are distractions, fleeting thoughts or a passing pleasure, but you are no one to grow old with. You will descend to the dark halls where the sun has never shone, and Persephone will hear your story and share a dark look with her husband, a look that speaks of the foolishness of gods and the destruction they leave in their wake. There are many stories like yours, here. Your father will scream, and cry, and rage against the heat of the sun that sunk you, and Apollo will not hear his curses. He is far away, laughing in a forested glade, chasing a beautiful nymph with leaves in her hair and tears in her eyes as she runs.",

    "text": "Eric remembers sliding down his father's great wet tongue. The last thing he saw before the giant teeth clicked shut afore him, and his father swallowed him, was his mother's face. Horror struck, her warm brown eyes wider than he had ever seen then before, gasping, and reaching for him as if to save him. He did not know it back then, but his father struck her down. But Eric was made of bigger things than acid could dissolve, so alive he stayed, forever burning, regenerating, dying over and over and over and over- until his siblings joined him. Then they all burned, but at least they had company. Eric remembers that too, once Zeus rescues them all. There is a reason he picked up the hearth, chose the home as his domain, after all. He couldn't leave the burning of that stomach behind, because it was the only home he'd ever known, and as such, the fireplace becomes his symbol. The symbol of the first place his family resided. His name, back then, was Hestia, but it is a dead name, so no mortal dares to speak it. (Kronos lies in pieces, and Eric is thankful for it) Once upon a time, Poseidon, broad, dripping water everywhere, took his hand asked for marriage. Water splashed into the hearth, but Eric didn't mind, not even when it sizzled as it refused to go out. He'd been used to it. Poseidon is welcome by his hearth. But not like that. Eric smiled, patted his hand, and firmly told him no. Apollo, golden, asked a week later, and Eric had to close his eyes before telling him no, because he did not want to see the eyes gliding along his curves- along the curves that were not his. Both wanted a woman, and Eric had never been that. They move along, his hearth empty but for the fire burning in it. Not even an hour later, Aphrodite arrived, draped herself against the kitchen table and said: ''Sweetheart, if you don't want them, do me.'' Eric swore an oath of virginity right then and there. (The coy look on her face still haunts his nightmares, and there is not a single thing Aphrodite could ever do- soft curves, long lashes and plush lips- that would make him love her in that way. She took it hard but came back for the pie anyway. He adored her for that, really. She was always welcome, but she too does not stay by his fire.) This is how he lives: baking pies, tending to the hearth, loving and loving and loving. Even himself, even on the days he cannot stand this. The worst days are when he bleeds, but just as stomach acid could not dissolve him, his own body cannot tear him apart. He loves himself. Intensely, greatly, a love of legends. He is the hearth, the one all come home to, the flickering flame of eternity, the one constant thing in this world. There will always be a home, and he is the embodiment of it. Gods and Goddesses are what the world makes them. Whether or not Man thought up the Gods, or the Gods thought up Man, they exist, and the thoughts of others contort the Gods. Aphrodite is the most obvious one in this- she twists and morphs at every turn, changing to the view of what the one she meets finds the most beautiful. It is not something she means to do- it is part of her being, she cannot help it. She was born this way. Just like Eric was born this way. With shapely, child-bearing hips. With breasts large, in comparison to his small frame. Eric looks like a woman because humanity thinks that's what home looks like, but he is not. He is bitter and tired of being defined by what he is not- Eric is a great many things, and a woman is not one of them. He is a man. He is home. He is the hearth. He is himself. The earth can shake as Gaia tries to wake, the sea can bubble with Ouranous remains, his father can scream slurs from the bottom of the Tartarus so loudly they can hear him in the world above, but Eric won't change. This is him. For the first time in his life, Eric lets himself rest alongside the hearth. After that, it gets easier. Forsaking the name of Hestia helps. He is the most worshipped God, for every time someone loves their home he is loved, and yet he is also the first whose Godly power declines. Do not mistake power for strength- he has simply forsaken the name of Hestia, and if anyone invokes a name that is not his that is their problem. He is the God Eric now, the deity shaped only by his own thoughts instead of humanity. His body begins to change, becomes as male as his mind. The world changes with him. A new era starts. Within its dawn, Eric is e verywhere, travelling from place to place. But in truth, he's always liked a stable place the best, so in the end, after decades of travel, he settles in the South of the United States. Southern hospitality, they say, is the best- though they only start saying so after Eric arrives. Being the God of the Hearth has some perks. On the other hand, it also means this: there are those who need a home there, so very badly. He's always been drawn to places where there are those in need of the hearth. This is also why he relocates to Samwell University, the number one most LGBT+ friendly campus. So many go there to find a home, so the home of all homes moves there. If his own queerness played a factor in it, well, nobody's going to snitch on him, right? He joins the men's hockey team, and it's one of the best decisions he ever made. He loves everything about them: the sense of togetherness, the closeness bordering on a cult (...though the likeliness to a cult itself might not be a good thing), the way of life and even the way they sing ''Take Me Home, Country Roads'' when absolutely wasted, at four am on the way back from the pub. It's a family, a home. The Haus is the embodiment of this, and it has a proper kitchen, not those ridiculously small ovens the dorms possess, and Eric cannot wait until he'll be able to live there. The inhabitants are drawn to the kitchen each and every hour he spends there, snacking and devouring and doing unspeakable things to his pie. But they're lovely, really, and they sit by his hearth and Eric is content. Then there's Jack. There is something so terribly mortal about Jack- Jack, who cries, who fucks up, who is awkward, who skates at five am and drags the rest of 'em out of the Haus to go with him. Eric has never lacked people to sit by his hearth, but Jack is the first one he wants to keep there always.",
