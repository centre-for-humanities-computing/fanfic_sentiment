    "text": "\"And that is how you stay a virgin forever,\" Hera finished. Hebe gazed up at her with wide eyes. \"Every year?\" Hera nodded. \"Every year.\" Hebe looked down at her hands. \"Well, that won't be a problem for me. I'm never getting married or having lovers.\" Hera stifled a sigh. Hebe had been spending entirely too much time with her bastard half-sisters. \"Yes, well, you say that now but you may change your mind in the future, dear.\" \"I won't.\" \"Hmm.\" \"I just want to stay with you and Father forever,\" Hebe went on, yawning hugely. \"Well. Wanting to stay with your family is quite admirable but you may want one of your own someday.\" \"Won't.\" She snuggled up against Hera, her eyes falling closed. Hera held her and stroked her arm until she was soundly asleep, then untwined herself to stand up, kissing her forehead. \"Sleep well, my darling,\" she whispered. \"Die, scum!\" Ares cried, running into the room. \"As worthless as I am, I'm afraid I can--oh hello dear.\" Zeus stopped in the doorway when he saw Hera and a newly-awakened Hebe staring back at him. \"Hi Mommy!\" Ares said, jumping on the bed. \"We're playing Good Brother, Bad Brother! I'm Zeus and he's Hades!\" Hera arched an eyebrow at her husband over her son's head. Zeus just grinned and shrugged. \"It's his favorite game, what can I say.\" \"Zap, zap!\" Ares said, shooting imaginary lightning bolts. \"Poor Hestia would weep,\" Hera said dryly. \"Meanwhile, I do believe it is past someone's bedtime.\" She put her hands on her hips and gazed down at Ares. Ares blinked up at her, then turned to Zeus. \"You heard her, it's past your bedtime.\" \"Are we having a party?\" asked Hebe, yawning again. \"No, we are having no such thing,\" Hera said, adjusting the blanket around her daughter. \"You are going back to sleep, and your brother will be joining you shortly thereafter.\" \"But Eris is still up!\" Ares whined, standing up just so he could stomp his foot. \"And Eris will get a spanking, as will you, my boy, if you don't listen to me.\" Ares' eyes widened and he fled the room. \"I'm going to bed right now!\" he shouted after him. \"Children,\" said Zeus, shaking his head. \"So easy to manipulate.\" Once they'd got Hebe nodding off again, tucked Ares in, and found Eris pillaging in the kitchen and sent her off to bed as well with an earful of stern words, Hera and Zeus found themselves for once in a quiet home. \"Shall we follow our children's examples, my queen?\" Zeus asked, holding out a hand. Hera hesitated the barest fraction of a second. After all, it hadn't been so long ago that he had last taken someone else to bed, and it wouldn't be too long before it happened again, either--Hera was no fool. But whenever she looked into his eyes, her resolve crumbled. \"We shall,\" she said, taking his hand and letting him lead her away.",

    "text": "\"Everything is so dull,\" Sherlock says. \"You're the lord of the dead,\" Stamford says. \"Your kingdom is rich beyond measure and grows every day, how can you possibly be bored?\" \"Gems and shades are equally worthless,\" Sherlock says dismissively. \"Jewels and pretty metals might buy mortal delights, but I am not mortal. And as for the shades - every single one of them has the same story: I had a life, and now it is ended.\" \"You want entertainment then? Perhaps a living guest?\" \"Who, exactly,\" Sherlock says dryly, \"would want to be a guest and room in the kingdom of the dead?\" He should have known better than to pose such a question to Stamford. Stamford, who frequently introduces individuals with a point and parts them without, Stamford brings him John. John brings laughter to the realm of the dead. He tries to stifle his amusement at first, says things like: \"This is the court of judgement, we can't laugh here.\" Sherlock says, \"This is my kingdom where only the truth may be spoken, for it's only here that it's wanted. And what could be more true than laughter?\" \"I shouldn't laugh,\" John says, mouth struggling to stay still as they watch Sisyphus, making his way up the hill, inch by inch. \"I mean, it's not funny.\" \"It is,\" Sherlock says as the stone rolls back yet again, and like his word is a key, John lets his laughter go. Time passes, above as well as below. \"I don't want a throne,\" John says. \"I want people to respect you,\" Sherlock says. \"I'm a guest,\" John says, frowning and Sherlock curses for the first time the fear and revulsion others hold him in, for he does not know where he has gone wrong, how he has not made his meaning plain. (He remembers at last that a single arrow cannot strike two breasts.) \"I want them to see how I value you and know to value you the same,\" he says awkwardly, for he is rich in gold and jewels and not in words. \"Well,\" John says, \"that's - nice. But I'm not, you know. Anything special.\" \"I can know the shape of a man's life in a glance,\" Sherlock says. \"I think I know your worth.\" \"I'm not gold for you to keep,\" John says. \"I didn't say you were,\" Sherlock says. \"I am known to be just, too, John.\" \"So if I wanted to leave, you'd let me?\" \"Do you want to leave?\" Sherlock says, heart cold in his chest. \"Not yet.\" Not yet. He expects there to be a messenger eventually - Mycroft cannot keep himself from meddling. It is Anthea who comes, grey-eyed Anthea, sprung full-formed from Mycroft's head. Perhaps Mycroft knows he is slightly more likely to hear out and listen to something that might be wisdom rather than something that is undoubtedly trickery. (Of course Mycroft knows.) \"John's sister wants him back,\" she says without preamble. \"She scours the earth with her fury; it bakes with her rage.\" \"Why should such temper matter to me?\" Sherlock says. \"All come to my kingdom in the end anyway.\" \"It might not matter to you,\" Anthea says. \"But it matters to your brother that the world isn't destroyed because you had to abduct some company.\" \"He's one to talk,\" Sherlock snaps. \"The world is more important than a dalliance.\" \"He means 'the world is more important than your dalliance'.\" \"Regardless, it is important.\" \"It doesn't matter to Mycroft,\" he hisses. \"To him all beings are nothing more than stones on a petteia board. Well, he may think all the world and everything on it is a game piece for him to move, but it's not. Or if it is, then this one piece is mine and he can't have him. I value John more than he ever will. Hasn't he always wanted that of me? To have a heart he can manipulate?\" Gently Anthea says, \"One - or even two hearts is nothing to the Moirae. They sever the threads just the same.\" \"Who do you think you're talking to?\" Sherlock snaps. \"This is my kingdom, where all threads end - I am not the same as them.\" \"All beings are in the weave,\" Anthea says. \"Even Mycroft. Even you.\" \"Go back to Mycroft,\" Sherlock says. \"Tell him to find Harry a replacement brother. And if he claims he can't, tell him: 'exactly'.\" John says, \"I'm forgetting what sunlight felt like.\" Sherlock wants to say: \"I won't change for you. \"At least, I don't think I will. I don't think I have, because you can tell when I try. But the loss of you - John, why is the thought so abhorrent, simply going back to what my life was before you? It would leave me hollow. \"No, worse. It would leave me aware of my hollowness. \"I would - I would do anything for you. And if it made you happier to leave I would - \"I would let you go. \"I'm told that's love. Is that enough to keep you?\" He thinks the answer is no. Sherlock says, \"Stay with me,\" passes John a pomegranate seed from mouth to mouth. John smiles, kisses back with a new seed on his tongue. \"'Brother',\" Anthea recites, \"'Yours is a kingdom made entirely of discarded petteia stones. Surely you can play your games without the use of one still in play?'\" She looks him, cold and terrible on his throne. \"To be fair, he has not spoken with you since John entered your kingdom.\" \"You're supposed to be wise,\" Sherlock says through his teeth. \"What's your argument to make me dismiss my John.\" \"John is a creature of sunlight,\" she says. \"You can't keep him in the dark.\" \"He likes walking in the shadows with me,\" Sherlock says. \"I'm sure he does,\" Anthea says. \"Every being likes shade after too long in the sun. That doesn't mean they want to stay there and never know the sun again.\" \"Go back to Mycroft. Tell him whatever you want, but make sure he knows that if he tries to take John from me I'll close my gates. Let's see the value he puts on any of his pieces then.\" John says, \"Love brings more people to your kingdom than despair ever will.\" His words are layered upon themselves, too many meanings for one sentence. (Has it brought you? Sherlock does not dare to say.) \"Stay with me,\" Sherlock says, pomegranate seed contained in his kiss. (\"Yes,\" John says, licks red juice from his lips.) \"There's a lot of people on the shore,\" John says. \"There's a famine above,\" Sherlock says. Admits: \"Your sister isn't best pleased with your living arrangements.\" \"Always was a bit dramatic, Harry,\" John says wryly. \"You don't - want to leave?\" \"I'm happy where I am,\" John says. \"Don't leave me,\" Sherlock breathes, nothing but hope in his mouth. John shakes his head. \"I have to,\" he says. Looks at the people wandering the shore, being ferried across the Styx. (Hope tastes like ash.) \"I'll come back,\" John says, promises. \"You won't,\" Sherlock says bitterly. \"How exactly can the realm of the dead hope to compare to the living?\" \"Oh, I don't know,\" John says mildly. \"The pomegranates here are the best in any realm.\" In his open palm - one two three \"It's always been my choice,\" he says. (promises taste like pomegranate)",

    "text": "Say it: John is dead. Repeat (hope it gets through): John is dead. John is dead. Not possible. Not possible. (Whatever remains, however improbable) Then. Since it is not possible that John is dead (though he is, perhaps you should amend that - it is not possible that John can remain dead, permanently parted from you) what can you do to correct this state of affairs? You turn your back on Lestrade, on cases, on your brother; turn your back and try to think. You dream of John on the third night. You say, \"If this is all I will have for the rest of my life, I can be content with that.\" John says the truth he would once have couched in niceties to save your feelings, though you told him often you had none - \"No you won't.\" You always said the day John knew the truth before you would herald the end of your world. \"You can't go on like this, Sherlock!\" \"I worry about you.\" \"Freak - there's been a murder, a weird one, nasty - don't you want to see?\" \"You know John wouldn't - he wouldn't want this for you. He wouldn't like to see you like this.\" You hear them through a haze, their voices so distant, as if they are the ones speaking from another country, not John, waiting patiently for your dreams. You may have lived with John, but you existed before him, and you will exist after him. You keep telling yourself that with every breath, hoping that repetition will make it truth. (You've heard this song before: this can't be happening to me, not me, things like this happen to other people, not me - for me he will come home, it will all have been a dream, a nightmare, because I'm different, therefore he's different - such things do not happen to us. Before, you always said: oh, stop being stupid and face the facts.) It is like an equation that you cannot work out - you know every step, the result is always correct, for you double-check at every stage, and yet you wish it wasn't. It isn't supposed to work like that - you are not supposed to work like that. Grief has made a mockery of your pride - you see so clear now: you are like everybody else before Death. \"I'm dreaming,\" you say. \"Yes,\" John tells you. His smile - is it exactly as you remember it? John had so many for you, perhaps it is simply a new one he has learnt. \"I don't want to wake up,\" you confess. \"You will,\" John says, bluntly truthful. You remember you trusted him to tell you what lines you were crossing, what morals you trod upon. This is the same, isn't it, this honesty, so terrible and sharp like a knife between your ribs. You turn your head and meet his eyes for the first time and they are - you look at them straight on and they are colourless. Not white: the total absence of colour. Your breath catches in your throat. \"Sherlock?\" Not-John says. \"What's wrong?\" You wake and think of John's eyes. You cannot recall their colour. You say, blue, brown? Pathetic, you could once name the exact shades a painter would use. You say, something light. and mean, they shone when the light hit them just right, they were clear and steady and he looked right at me and he saw something worth praising and something worth thought, and he didn't look away when he found himself looking at blood and shadows. You say, why can't I remember? You say, \"Oh. Oh, I am forgetting John.\" (You existed before him and you will exist after him and this is how: by letting time take him from you, by letting it blur and erase every memory that cuts you open, and the blunting of your grief is the fog of your new life, seeping through you, remaking you.) You pace the confines of the flat. (When did it become a cage instead of a home?) There, John's laptop, a fine film of dust between the keys - over the keys now. John's favourite mug, sitting by the sink, unwashed, the last few drops of cold tea now a sticky patina across the bottom. John's chair, out of alignment from where he'd shoved it back in his haste to get up and follow you, John everywhere, in everything, but never to come through the door again, never to laugh or smile or fling cushions at your sulking back, never again to make tea or throw out body parts or change everything (the flat, your world) just by walking in. Remember: the way he said 'that's amazing', the way it filled you with heat, you who had been cold almost all your life - pride and something tender that made you smile with a wonder you could feel in the uncertain lift of your mouth. Remember: the feel of his hand in yours, calluses and lifelines, warm and solid, fingers curling against yours every time you fall, don't worry, i'll be there to pick you back up, promise, just - try not to fall so much, yeah? Remember: John. John's smile, John's exasperated frown, John's laugh, giggly and delighted against your ear, John's grin, the way he licked his lips, the way he said your name, the exact colour of his eyes- You stop, stand still in the middle of the room, hands curling at your side, head tilted up and back, looking to the ceiling (John's room). You close your eyes. You say, \"The fare for a living man to cross the Styx is mistletoe, the golden bough of Aeneas.\" Yours is not a mind made to know the path between the worlds of life and death. Even as you walk, it twists before your eyes, your logical mind rebelling, interpreting it all as something you can understand, as pavement and cobbles and worn patches of earth, as grass and sky, stone and sand. You know the reality is nothing like what you see. You begin to play your violin as you cross the ink-black river, Charon's fierce gaze nothing to the music in your head - this song, this is the song you will play for John if - when - and it will be the best thing you have ever performed in your life, repayment for all those times when you played nothing but the shrieking disharmonious chords of your thoughts. You coax majesty from your instrument, seguing from movement to movement, song to song, barely notice when your feet touch earth, when you walk past whining Cerberus, through gates that twist and blur in the corner of your eye. You walk for an age, an eternity, and not long at all, to stand before the thrones of the King and Queen of the Dead. Observe. You see: a man, clean-shaven, stern-faced and brooding, something familiar in the curve of his nose and the tilt of his chin, hands callused (miner's hands). You see a girl, perhaps sixteen as you understand years, hands and feet soft and unmarked (scented, no, anointed, balsam oil, for the dead), uncertain in her husband's shadow, her eyes wide and troubled. You see: streaks of white in the man's beard, fingers ringed with heavy gold (four: index, left, middle, left, ring finger, right, middle, right; three stones - amethyst, emerald, sardonyx - metal surrounding them dinted and scratched, probably pure), a crown so bright and bejeweled you flinch. You see a woman in the prime of her life, straight-backed and almost haughty, elusive promise of youth ripened not into beauty but into strikingness, something that will last. Six, no, seven months pregnant (but dead - her hand does not flutter and curve protectively, she gives none of the little winces and sighs provoked by an active foetus, gives her rounded belly no regard at all. You have a moment of understanding - of course nothing grows in the realm of the dead). You see: the man's sunken eyes, bright with wisdom, a face marked by years of frowning, beard and hair the dead white of age, skin creased and worn. You see a woman with staring eyes, misted and grey and looking always just beyond you, her brittle grey hair elaborately coiffed, liver-spotted hands made fragile by the addition of heavy rings. (Her thumb brushes the back of his hand, old, familiar habit; he cradles her fingers like rose petals, something new and precious) You see all this and more in one moment, and some of the things you see sitting upon the thrones of the King and Queen of the Dead are not in the slightest bit human. You can bear the sight no more than you could bear to see John's beloved face made mockery by lack of colour. For the first time in your life, you avert your eyes. You had speeches for this moment. Your voice would have soared, you would mix lofty rhetoric with earthy realism, sweeping generalisations tempered with heart-cut-quick-close personal anecdotes. You would tell them everything you loved of John that you never said when he was alive, and everything you despised and yet would not change for all the world. You would have touched their emotions with your own, would have used the universal desire for a mate, would have used everything you had to force them to see your loss as the earth-shattering disaster it is to you. Another first: your words fail you. Your hands keep moving, the music keeps playing, but your voice has fled. You say: \"Please,\" all your love compressed into a single word. Apollo has written paeans with less eloquence than the crack of your voice. You will never remember what you said or played to bring tears to every eye under the rim of the earth where Death is lord. You know only that the Queen looked at you and smiled with still-damp cheeks and said, \"Husband, let him have what he wants.\" (There is a phrase isn't there, about the difference between wanting and needing, having and getting. You can't remember it under the deluge of JohnJohnJohnohplease.) \"So be it,\" the Lord of the Dead says, and something collapses inside you, relief heavy as mountains, light as air. \"Wait,\" she says, when that feeling is at its height and you don't know what to do - it will smother you, choke you, you cannot cope with the breadth of it. \"A condition - a test, if you will.\" (crown of dead leaves in her hair, goddess of spring) \"A test?\" You say, voice choked and small. You do not say, anything, anything, I will do anything, throw what you will at me, I will win if it means John's return. You are not entirely a fool. \"Of faith,\" she says. \"Do you have faith, Sherlock, famous of name?\" in John, only ever in John \"Turn,\" she says, pomegranate red mouth curved in a smile. \"And walk. Behind you will follow your beloved. Do not look back.\" She knows you have been doing nothing but since John died. The smile of Hades is quiet and self-assured. \"None leave the underworld by the way they came to it. Follow the path - you will know it. Do not leave it, and you will walk once more in the sunlight of the living world. Halt not, speak not, turn not until you both have left our kingdom. Then, and only then, will John Watson be yours once more.\" \"Thank you,\" you say, your heart thundering in your chest. He laughs. It rolls like thunder. \"He thanks us, wife.\" Her laughter is sweet like spring rain. \"How goes it, husband? What fools these mortals be!\" You turn and begin to walk. You do not look back. Their laughter follows you. You can hear your heart beating, blood rushing in your ears, the sound of your feet against earth, against stone, the echo of Hades' laughter. You cannot hear John. The path is steep, and John's leg still trouble(d)s him now and then; he would not be able to keep from making small noises of discomfort, not at the unrelenting pace you are setting. You cannot hear him swearing softly under his breath, you cannot hear his footsteps, cannot hear the whisper of his clothing, his hands trailing against tree trunks or stone walls. You cannot hear him breathing. When the laughter of Hades no longer rings in your ears you can hear nothing but absence, nothing but what should have been. If you spoke, surely John could not keep himself from making some sarcastic remark back, surely he would reply, and you open your mouth - (speak not) You bite down until your lip bleeds. Hours and hours pass and you keep eyes determinedly fixed upon the path ahead of you, though every fibre in you cries and screams that you are walking alone, that you have been tricked, that there is no one following you. The silence has never been so terrible since the morning you woke and didn't have to realise John was not there, woke and didn't have to remind yourself he was gone. Your breath rasps in your throat, ragged and wet, the noise unbearably loud and from behind you there is no noise at all, just your tears, echoing. You are alone, and the sunlight is cold and weak on your face - you are alone and you cannot bear it, must know and so you turn and look.",

      "Your breath rasps in your throat, ragged and wet, the noise unbearably loud and from behind you there is no noise at all, just your tears, echoing.",
      "You are alone, and the sunlight is cold and weak on your face - you are alone and you cannot bear it, must know and so you turn and look."

    "text": "It was a lush party filled with overflowing cups. All around Persephone the Gods reclined in their splendor, gossiping and idly chattering; she hung back, afraid to bring herself forth and make herself known among the Gods. Dite called her forth. It was always laughing, smiling Dite, who felt the need to draw her from her shyness and from under the shell Demeter had built around her. That morning Demeter was far away at a harvest festival being held in her name, and there would be no chance that word would get back to her about what had transpired this evening. \"Come, come child,\" Dite said, smiling, holding a goblet of pure amber liquor. Persephone approached with caution; everyone knew of Aphrodite's incredible jealous, as well as her incredible erotic gifts. When Dite bent forward to kiss her, Persephone simply did as the woman bade rather than risk death. Dite's mouth was sweeter than ambrosia, hotter than a wellspring of boiling water; Persephone fell into it with a moan, and onto the divan that Dite had arranged for them both. Dite molded breasts with her soft hands; she teases across the nipple, hardly brushing, making Persephone cry out and writhe desperately. \"Sip of my ambrosia,\" Dite requested, holding forth a chalice. Persephone did, but Dite did not simply spill the liquid in the girl's mouth, but dribbled it down her neck, licking it from her satin skin and slowly sliding down toward her breasts. Oh, the time she spent lavishing attention on not only the tips but by kissing around and around the velvet of her areolas and down to the sloping undersides. She rubbed her face against that silky skin and purred. Dite chuckled while Persephone wrothe, nibbling golden thighs, biting at her toes. \"Ahh, sweet child. You know your power now.\" Persephone could barely concentrate, even with the approving chuckle of the other gods. She was aware of them toasting her in her feverish delirium. \"Ahh, please!\" she begged. There were soft chuckles, the loudest of all Dite's. She kissed her mons venerius, the little mountain that carried her name. \"You have learned to bow to your Goddess. Now you shall have your reward.\" Persephone gasped as Dite poured the goblet of wine over her sex. Using her entire tongue against her labia, Dite parted the outer lips to feast upon the soft, sweet pink treat within. Persephone made a sound of great frustration, sobbing wildly and yanking on Dite's hair; the older woman pinned her down and fiercely savaged her sex with her tongue, laving her clitoris, treating it as if it were the sweetest piece of candied fig, the ripest sugared date. Persephone tossed against the blankets, until Dite's hands at her breasts pinned her down. \"Mmmmm,\" she sighed. Pesephone balanced on the knife-edge of pleasure and, with a great sob, tumbled off. Dite surfaced with a grin. \"Nectar of the gods,\" she declared, and bent forward to kiss her.",

      "Dite's mouth was sweeter than ambrosia, hotter than a wellspring of boiling water; Persephone fell into it with a moan, and onto the divan that Dite had arranged for them both.",
      "Dite molded breasts with her soft hands; she teases across the nipple, hardly brushing, making Persephone cry out and writhe desperately.",
      "\"Sip of my ambrosia,\" Dite requested, holding forth a chalice.",
      "Persephone did, but Dite did not simply spill the liquid in the girl's mouth, but dribbled it down her neck, licking it from her satin skin and slowly sliding down toward her breasts.",
      "Oh, the time she spent lavishing attention on not only the tips but by kissing around and around the velvet of her areolas and down to the sloping undersides.",
      "She rubbed her face against that silky skin and purred.",
      "Dite chuckled while Persephone wrothe, nibbling golden thighs, biting at her toes.",
      "\"Ahh, sweet child.",
      "You know your power now.\"",
      "Persephone could barely concentrate, even with the approving chuckle of the other gods.",
      "She was aware of them toasting her in her feverish delirium.",
      "\"Ahh, please!\"",
      "she begged.",
      "There were soft chuckles, the loudest of all Dite's.",
      "She kissed her mons venerius, the little mountain that carried her name.",
      "\"You have learned to bow to your Goddess.",
      "Now you shall have your reward.\"",
      "Persephone gasped as Dite poured the goblet of wine over her sex.",
      "Using her entire tongue against her labia, Dite parted the outer lips to feast upon the soft, sweet pink treat within.",
      "Persephone made a sound of great frustration, sobbing wildly and yanking on Dite's hair; the older woman pinned her down and fiercely savaged her sex with her tongue, laving her clitoris, treating it as if it were the sweetest piece of candied fig, the ripest sugared date.",
      "Persephone tossed against the blankets, until Dite's hands at her breasts pinned her down.",
      "\"Mmmmm,\" she sighed.",
      "Pesephone balanced on the knife-edge of pleasure and, with a great sob, tumbled off.",
      "Dite surfaced with a grin.",
      "\"Nectar of the gods,\" she declared, and bent forward to kiss her."

    "text": "There's one thing they always leave out of the legends. This, Psyche decided, as she combed her long hair for the twentieth time that morning, was to keep maidens forever ignorant of the fates that awaited them. Paradise can be terribly stifling. And as lovely as her little house was, with its obedient servants, its cups of ambrosia, and its time of quiet reflection, she did miss the companionship of her husband. Her servants worried after her constantly, whispering rumors of the true, bestial nature of her lover. She lived for the nights, and the light he would bring to her with every fall of the sun. *** She heard the door slide open and stirred in her veiled bed. \"Dearest?\" she murmured. \"Yes,\" he said, his voice soft and soothing. She felt the warmth of his hand as it reached out for her, caressing her skin. \"Sweet Psyche,\" he sighed. \"How I miss you in the light of the morn.\" His lips caressed her neck, her earlobe, the side of her jaw and drifted lower. She no longer considered his invisibility a peculiarity, and instead gave herself up to the lavish attention of his tongue and hands. She felt the mattress dip beneath his weight. \"I miss you greatly,\" she confessed. \"We have a lovely home, and the servants are kind, but...\" his palm stroked from her cheek to the line of her jaw, down her neck to her shoulders, to the valley between her breasts. Minutes passed by before he fully cupped her breasts, what felt, to Psyche, like hours of agony. \"Would that you might play with the fruits of my sex,\" she begged. \"Paitence, beauty,\" he crooned in her ear. \"This is no race to be won with folly...Ahh, sweetness,\" he trailed off, as she stroked along the silken pathway to his cock again and again. It was odd, that she couldn't be afraid of this man, this beast who should be befouling her. Ahh, but if this be befouling...well, may she be befouled forevermore, then. His tongue made a criss-cross pattern on her nipple before sucking it deep, moaning at her endless stroking. Suddenly, her hands were locked over her head. \"Tonight,\" he declared, \"you shall know the true master of your body.\" She laughed. \"And you yours?\" She squeezed him gently. He moaned and suckled her neck. \"I well understand who has mastered my body and soul.\" His left hand strummed over her parted labia like a master of the lute, and her head fell back on a groan. \"Darling. Sweeter than ambrosia.\" He covered her like a fleece, arms and legs tucked against hers, his glorious cock filling and stretching her, making her howl. Marvelous darling. No matter who he was, marvelous he would always be. He stretched her with his love, hurt her, but gave her such fervent ecstasy that she sobbed and sobbed his name, until he roared his pleasure and filled her with love. She drowsed and awoke to an empty bed. Hope in the dawn of a morning lived without him.",

    "text": "The first time she saw him, she knew she wanted him. There was something dark and sinister about him -- only fitting, given he was the Lord of the Underworld -- that fascinated her. He had taken to spying on her as she bathed with her servants, and she knew he was there. She even made sure to strip off her clothes in such a way that he got a good view of her bosom and derriere. Then one day, he simply snatched her up and made off with her to his subterranean lair. She hadn't been afraid, but excited. She was young, after all, and new and different things intrigued her. That, and she'd been so utterly cossetted, repressed and suffocated by her mother that such a change of pace was more than welcome. She remained in his world for many months. He wasn't much for idle chatter and, the rare times he did speak, it was in a deep bass rumble she found oddly soothing. But he also ensured she was fed and clothed properly; kindnesses which she never refused. Then, inevitably, he would come to her. He would take her up in his arms, his black eyes blazing with a fiery intensity and his heavy brow furrowed as he placed her on the bed. His large hands were rough as they wandered everywhere; in her long sun-bleached hair, along her soft peaches-and-cream skin... finally reaching their destination. Fingers would find the tender rosy lips of her vagina and plunge within, and he would kiss her with such force that it never failed to halt her breath. Then, when she could stand it no more, she would take the sturdy length of his cock into her soft waiting core, crying out with exquisite pleasure as he pounded into her with the ferocity of a warhorse at full charge. The ache that he'd leave as a mark of having so taken her was a delightful reminder. Months passed in this way, until Demeter kicked up such a fuss that mighty Zeus had no choice but to call those involved directly to his throne. Mother was in full rage from the delays, and seethed when Persephone followed Hades into the throne room, trailing a few steps behind her lover. Apparently, the fuss was that Mother had refused to let anything grow unless she had her daughter back. Demeter flung some hefty accusations in Hades' face, decrying him as a thief and rapist. Hades snorted, but didn't bother to dignify the bluster with a reply. Then Zeus said the words Persephone had only dreamed she'd hear: \"She can't go back to you, not if she's eaten anything in the realm of the dead.\" He then turned to regard Persephone herself. \"Have you eaten at all?\" \"Well,\" she hedged. \"I had some pomegranate seeds this morning...\" \"This is an outrage!\" Demeter bellowed. \"If I do not get my daughter back, I will not permit the crops to grow... and all your precious humans will die from starvation, Zeus!\" Zeus dismissed her with a wave of the hand. \"How many did you eat, Persephone?\" \"Umm... I think it was six.\" Zeus nodded. \"Very well. Then a compromise shall be in order. For six months out of the year, she will remain with Hades. And for the remaining six months, she shall be at home with you.\" Demeter opened her mouth to protest once again. \"Take it or leave it,\" Zeus added in a tone that brooked no argument. \"Well, fine,\" Demeter huffed. \"Six months. But I still won't let anything grow while she's gone!\" \"Fair enough,\" Zeus replied mildly. Then to Persephone's surprise, he winked at the young girl. \"For now, she'll spend a little while longer with Hades, so there'll be a full six months to start with.\" Then the King of Gods dismissed them all, and told them all to go home and relax. Maybe sleep the stress of it off if they could, or find... alternative methods of blowing off steam that were acceptable. So, from that day forward, she's had to put up with her insufferable mother who'll sprinkle blooms of flowers to grow within the ground only as long as her daughter is present. Her mother, who's never forgiven Hades for eloping with her young daughter and won't even so much as give an inch of respect to her daughter's loving, if gruff, husband. Then, that glorious day comes when Hades returns with his black chariot to snatch her back into the Underworld, where there's no Mother shrieking about how her daughter deserves someone better, like maybe that nice boy Apollo... The best part of visiting her mother is always the leaving and, that for all his lack of charm, at least she knows her deep serious lover will be eternally faithful. And when shows her that night in his own silent way how much he's missed her -- with his arms bound tightly around her and his cock buried deep within her -- then she knows that silly and flighty Apollo kid could never be fit to spit-shine the sandals of her enigmatic Lord. It's not altogether a bad gig, being the Queen of the Dead. *Fin*",

      "She even made sure to strip off her clothes in such a way that he got a good view of her bosom and derriere.",
      "Then one day, he simply snatched her up and made off with her to his subterranean lair.",
      "She hadn't been afraid, but excited.",
      "She was young, after all, and new and different things intrigued her.",
      "That, and she'd been so utterly cossetted, repressed and suffocated by her mother that such a change of pace was more than welcome.",
      "She remained in his world for many months.",
      "He wasn't much for idle chatter and, the rare times he did speak, it was in a deep bass rumble she found oddly soothing.",
      "But he also ensured she was fed and clothed properly; kindnesses which she never refused.",
      "Then, inevitably, he would come to her.",
      "He would take her up in his arms, his black eyes blazing with a fiery intensity and his heavy brow furrowed as he placed her on the bed.",
      "His large hands were rough as they wandered everywhere; in her long sun-bleached hair, along her soft peaches-and-cream skin... finally reaching their destination.",
      "Fingers would find the tender rosy lips of her vagina and plunge within, and he would kiss her with such force that it never failed to halt her breath.",
      "Then, when she could stand it no more, she would take the sturdy length of his cock into her soft waiting core, crying out with exquisite pleasure as he pounded into her with the ferocity of a warhorse at full charge.",
      "The ache that he'd leave as a mark of having so taken her was a delightful reminder.",
      "Months passed in this way, until Demeter kicked up such a fuss that mighty Zeus had no choice but to call those involved directly to his throne.",
      "Mother was in full rage from the delays, and seethed when Persephone followed Hades into the throne room, trailing a few steps behind her lover.",
      "Apparently, the fuss was that Mother had refused to let anything grow unless she had her daughter back.",
      "Demeter flung some hefty accusations in Hades' face, decrying him as a thief and rapist.",
      "Hades snorted, but didn't bother to dignify the bluster with a reply.",
      "Then Zeus said the words Persephone had only dreamed she'd hear: \"She can't go back to you, not if she's eaten anything in the realm of the dead.\"",
      "He then turned to regard Persephone herself.",
      "\"Have you eaten at all?\"",
      "\"Well,\" she hedged.",
      "\"I had some pomegranate seeds this morning...\" \"This is an outrage!\"",
      "Demeter bellowed.",
      "\"If I do not get my daughter back, I will not permit the crops to grow... and all your precious humans will die from starvation, Zeus!\"",
      "Zeus dismissed her with a wave of the hand.",
      "\"How many did you eat, Persephone?\" \"Umm...",
      "I think it was six.\"",
      "Zeus nodded.",
      "\"Very well.",
      "Then a compromise shall be in order.",
      "For six months out of the year, she will remain with Hades.",
      "And for the remaining six months, she shall be at home with you.\"",
      "Demeter opened her mouth to protest once again.",
      "\"Take it or leave it,\" Zeus added in a tone that brooked no argument.",
      "\"Well, fine,\" Demeter huffed.",
      "\"Six months.",
      "But I still won't let anything grow while she's gone!\"",
      "\"Fair enough,\" Zeus replied mildly.",
      "Then to Persephone's surprise, he winked at the young girl.",
      "\"For now, she'll spend a little while longer with Hades, so there'll be a full six months to start with.\"",
      "Then the King of Gods dismissed them all, and told them all to go home and relax.",
      "Maybe sleep the stress of it off if they could, or find... alternative methods of blowing off steam that were acceptable.",
      "So, from that day forward, she's had to put up with her insufferable mother who'll sprinkle blooms of flowers to grow within the ground only as long as her daughter is present.",
      "Her mother, who's never forgiven Hades for eloping with her young daughter and won't even so much as give an inch of respect to her daughter's loving, if gruff, husband.",
      "Then, that glorious day comes when Hades returns with his black chariot to snatch her back into the Underworld, where there's no Mother shrieking about how her daughter deserves someone better, like maybe that nice boy Apollo...",
      "The best part of visiting her mother is always the leaving and, that for all his lack of charm, at least she knows her deep serious lover will be eternally faithful.",
      "And when shows her that night in his own silent way how much he's missed her -- with his arms bound tightly around her and his cock buried deep within her -- then she knows that silly and flighty Apollo kid could never be fit to spit-shine the sandals of her enigmatic Lord.",
      "It's not altogether a bad gig, being the Queen of the Dead.",

    "text": "The humans got it all wrong. You cannot kidnap one who follows you willingly, knowing of where you will lead them and surrendering themselves to you just the same. She had loved him upon first sight; a strange sort of magic between future lovers that only the gods know, and humans think they are familiar with. She remembers his dark eyes and pale too-cool hand intertwining with her warm, tanned fingers. His free hand had been buried in her blonde, sun-kissed hair as their lips met for the first time. His lips were cold, and yet there was a comforting sense of familiarity with the contact, as if she had been intended for him from the first. It had been a stolen moment, and he had vanished into the darkness when the footsteps of her mother drew near. \"Kore! Why are you standing out here in the dark?\" Demeter had queried, using Persephone's childhood appellation. She remained ignorant of her daughter's nocturnal visitations. Persephone gazed up at the constellations she and Hades had been admiring together. \"Because I wish to be alone, Mother, in order to stargaze.\" Demeter snorted. \"My dear child, there is so much to be done tomorrow. You do not intend to shirk your duties in growing things anew for the humans.\" Demeter wrapped an arm around her daughter, inexorably pulling Persephone inside. \"Come. You must rest. We will have a busy day tomorrow.\" =================== A few nights later, Hades had bestowed upon her a precious gift: a flower that could never wilt. Its stem was crafted from white gold, the metallic leaves studded with emeralds, and the bloom carved from some precious red gemstone that had not yet been named. Persephone had been overwhelmed from receiving such a gift. Never had she been given something that so resembled who she truly was, not as the child her mother still thought her as, but the goddess she both was and wanted to be. He had placed the gift in Persephone's hair, tucking the stem behind her ear so it shone at just the right angle, its gemmed leaves glowing softly in the moonlight. Then, he placed his hands around her waist and kissed her again. He had no choice but to vanish again when her mother appeared. =================== It had taken several more weeks, with Hades bestowing upon her other precious gifts in his courting of her, before they were able to properly spend time alone. She had taken to her room, citing weariness from a long day handling the prayer requests of the humans who petitioned herself and her mother for the tending of their crops, their medicinal herbs and the flowers they chose for their beauty. Demeter looked upon her daughter with pity, and allowed the girl to retire early. In the quiet dark of her room, she nearly ran into Hades' broad chest and bit back the instinctive yelp of surprise. \"How do you come and go, unseen by any eyes, milord?\" She asked, her flayed nerves from a hectic day causing her voice to shake. Or perhaps it was his proximity that caused her words to come out in tremulous tones. \"I have my ways,\" he replied, his deep voice carrying an almost... mischievous note, that was so very unlike the staid, unruffled Lord of the Dead. His tone changed; although the alterations in cadence were always quite subtle. Others, who didn't know him as well as she, often claimed erroneously that he spoke in a certain monotone. His voice seemed tender to her, now, and vexingly nervous. \"My love, these days without you have been torturous. I cannot exist without you by my side any longer. Will you come with me to the Underworld, to reign by my side as my Queen?\" \"Milord, you honor me greatly with such a request. But surely there are far greater goddesses better suited than I?\" \"I love no one but you,\" he replied softly. \"Not before, not now. Not ever. I pledge myself upon the Styx that you are all to me. I shall be satisfied with none but you.\" Persephone gasped. Without so much as the faintest hesitation, he had uttered the Unbreakable Vow, which promised death if one attempted to circumvent it. Truly, Lord Hades must love her beyond all expression to commit such a vow! \"Milord.\" Her voice was quieter now, choked with emotion. \"I am a young goddess. I have never known such love or devotion. I only know that, if your feelings are as great for me as mine are for you, then we must never be apart again.\" Hades nodded, his brow furrowed in thought. \"My love, allow me to express that which cannot be said in words.\" He opened his arms to her. \"Come to me, my Queen.\" He captured her lips against his then lifted her in his arms, carrying her over to her bed. It seemed fitting that her new husband should consecrate their union, not through the ridiculous pomp of mortal ceremonies, but through lying with her in the bed of her childhood home. His cool, large hands tenderly pulled aside the yards of fabric that made her dress and cast it to the floor. She was left naked and trembling under his piercing gaze; his lips upturned in the faintest hint of a smile, before pressing against her breast to suckle. A cool hand found its way to her most delicate and secret spot, fingers deftly tracing the soft damp flesh until she began to whimper and squirm. He uttered hushing noises, and his mouth journeyed to the precious site. Her hands grasped at his black hair as he plundered her bounty, until her throat tightened from the screams of pleasure that were denied utterance past her tightly clenched teeth. \"Hades,\" she cried, trying to keep her voice down as best she could to avoid alerting the household. \"Please!\" He crawled his way up her body, muscles under the pallid flesh flexing with the restrained urge to ravish her immediately. He reminded her of a great panther, his almost predatory gaze inciting primal urges within her that she never knew existed. He kissed her yet again, and she felt... she felt the length of him slowly entering her, and she placed her thighs around his waist to grant him greater access. She could feel her own muscles, tightly surrounding him and it was... perfect, harmonious as the heavens themselves. She wanted more, wanted him like this always. Oh, but he was being so agonizingly slow! His languid pace frustrated her, and the animal growl that ripped past her lips startled her... as did the realization that her own nails were clawing at his back like a tigress in heat. Indeed, it seemed blood rushed through her veins like liquid fire, as her body sweat and pulsated from their lovemaking. She heard his soft, indolent chuckle in her ears. \"Please, my love!\" she begged him. \"You drive me to madness!\" She gasped when he obediently altered the tempo to slam his hips against hers, filling her completely. She clung to him as he ravished her thoroughly, his hard yet fluid thrusts battering her and still leaving her hungering for more, until they were both spent and panting. When he slipped from her, he simply held her in his arms, breathing in her scent, of flowers, sweat and sex. There would be trials tomorrow, but for now nothing could keep them apart. *Fin*",

      "He captured her lips against his then lifted her in his arms, carrying her over to her bed.",
      "It seemed fitting that her new husband should consecrate their union, not through the ridiculous pomp of mortal ceremonies, but through lying with her in the bed of her childhood home.",
      "His cool, large hands tenderly pulled aside the yards of fabric that made her dress and cast it to the floor.",
      "She was left naked and trembling under his piercing gaze; his lips upturned in the faintest hint of a smile, before pressing against her breast to suckle.",
      "A cool hand found its way to her most delicate and secret spot, fingers deftly tracing the soft damp flesh until she began to whimper and squirm.",
      "He uttered hushing noises, and his mouth journeyed to the precious site.",
      "Her hands grasped at his black hair as he plundered her bounty, until her throat tightened from the screams of pleasure that were denied utterance past her tightly clenched teeth.",
      "\"Hades,\" she cried, trying to keep her voice down as best she could to avoid alerting the household.",
      "\"Please!\"",
      "He crawled his way up her body, muscles under the pallid flesh flexing with the restrained urge to ravish her immediately.",
      "He reminded her of a great panther, his almost predatory gaze inciting primal urges within her that she never knew existed.",
      "He kissed her yet again, and she felt...",
      "she felt the length of him slowly entering her, and she placed her thighs around his waist to grant him greater access.",
      "She could feel her own muscles, tightly surrounding him and it was... perfect, harmonious as the heavens themselves.",
      "She wanted more, wanted him like this always.",
      "Oh, but he was being so agonizingly slow!",
      "His languid pace frustrated her, and the animal growl that ripped past her lips startled her... as did the realization that her own nails were clawing at his back like a tigress in heat.",
      "Indeed, it seemed blood rushed through her veins like liquid fire, as her body sweat and pulsated from their lovemaking.",
      "She heard his soft, indolent chuckle in her ears.",
      "\"Please, my love!\"",
      "she begged him.",
      "\"You drive me to madness!\"",
      "She gasped when he obediently altered the tempo to slam his hips against hers, filling her completely.",
      "She clung to him as he ravished her thoroughly, his hard yet fluid thrusts battering her and still leaving her hungering for more, until they were both spent and panting.",
      "When he slipped from her, he simply held her in his arms, breathing in her scent, of flowers, sweat and sex.",
      "There would be trials tomorrow, but for now nothing could keep them apart.",

    "text": "They say it's the city that never sleeps. You don't know. You have to, at least during the day. You work as a barista during the mornings and party all night. You like the clubs. You like the scene, the drugs. You like to dance, and all the boys and girls that come with it. You love the moment you leave your body and just exist under all the lights and music, under the bodies and hands, the chemicals. You live for oblivion and you couldn't care less. You share a flat with two guys and two girls, a big loft with not enough beds and too many windows. There are Jalil and Christopher, who are sometimes together when Chris isn't fucking April behind Jalil's back. April half-lives in the neighborhood theater, bouncing between black and glitter, and Senna takes turns sinking her claws into all of their backs. You like to think you wouldn't keep her around if her modeling gigs didn't pay for the rent on the months the rest were short. It's a Tuesday, just after midnight, and you're walking home when the car pulls up next to you. Something sleek, and black, with tinted windows. The one on the passenger side rolls down just a crack, and you stop to peer in, although you know you probably shouldn't. You look like a club kid, not a hooker or a dealer, but you never know. The first thing he does is ask your name. You're startled enough to give it to him. \"David,\" he rumbles, and the vibration of it hits you in your stomach, in your chest. Sharp. \"David.\" It means 'beloved,' you want to tell him, because you feel he should know. Beloved, in Hebrew. You remember when you thought that was true. Before your family ripped in half and you drifted here with your father, before his new family and your new stepsisters, before they picked at every little part of you and you fled, because you'd rather have the lions sink their claws into you than give those scavengers the satisfaction of your corpse. He tells you to get in. You can't see him, not a bit of him, not even his eyes. He's ugly, for all you know. A monster. You curl your fingers around the door handle, feeling the hum of it when he clicks unlock. You wave off Jalil's frown, April's open mouth. Chris is impassive, or maybe just pissed because Senna's puked all over his shoes again. Anyway. You get in the car. You curl into the seat, humming softly to yourself. You can't quite focus on anything, even though you try. Jalil's fault. He came up to you with a shiny pill between his teeth. Something purple, tonight, or lavender, or lilac. Shockingly colored against Jalil's white teeth. When you kissed him you slipped him tongue, and you know Chris noticed. But you always take what Jalil gives you, because Jalil always knows where to get the good drugs, the safe ones. The ones that make everything slippery and shimmering and velvet, still leave you with a feel-good buzz for work in a few hours. You head onto an overpass, through a tunnel of inky darkness, an underground parking garage. He hands you a key and puts you in the elevator while he talks to the doorman. You ride all the way to the top, numb, and when you get there you can't find the light switch, and you're still busy fumbling for it when he comes up behind you. You're not even scared. He's strong, but just in the way you like, and he worships you. You can feel it in every touch, from the whisper-light ones like velvet on your mouth to the bruises on your thighs. He's a god to you, and you worship him - the body you know only by touch, the deep voice belonging to no face. You wake up too late, and there's a key on the bedstand, with a note that says \"yours\" in scrawling, scratched hand writing. You call in sick to work, because you don't have any clothes with you, and you're not even sure where the hell you are. You find the nearest subway entrance and spend a half an hour trying to figure out what the hell is going on. But you go back, of course. You're mother always said you were too stupid and curious for your own good, and, oh, you're so curious. You want to know. The lights are off when you open the door, but he grabs you when you turn to leave. Later that night he grabs you again, differently, when you reach for the light switch. He tells you, commands you, to never turn on the lights, that it's the one thing you cannot do. You agree, because it's the only moment he's ever scared you. You ask him what he does. He tells you he's a corporate headhunter, with a flash of sharp teeth you feel rather then see. You ask him for stuff and he says yes without a thought. He leaves things all over the apartment for you to find. You're petulant, and you disappear for a few days, and the only thing he does is fuck you for an extra hour or two when you get back. You love him and he must know it. He must. By fall you accept things. You pick up your stuff from the apartment and leave. Senna is crying, with April's arm tight around her waist. Another trip to the clinic, you think, shaking your head. There are modeling jobs and there are modeling jobs, and Senna's never given a damn which were which until the aftermath. Next door, Christopher sprawled all over Jalil's bed, and Jalil is sitting up next to him, staring out the window. You watch Chris press his face into Jalil's thigh, sleepily. You watch the curl of his spine underneath the sheet, and the way Jalil runs his fingers through Christopher's hair, too rough for so early in the morning. Christopher just laughs. You never did understand them. But you wave to Jalil and he nods, like he saw this all coming, and hell, maybe he did. He's the smartest person you'll ever meet, no matter how stupid he gets when it comes to Christopher. You pass months in blissful darkness. You still work at the coffeeshop. You like hanging out with Ganymede there, and Galahad. So you work the mornings and sleep during the days, just waking up when he slides into bed behind you. It's not normal, but you're of the \"don't fix it if it ain't broke\" camp, and whatever this is, it ain't broke. One day you run into your stepmother in the lobby, of all places, of all times. You were just going out to get coffee, but now it has to be lunch at the cafe down the street, a lunch date with your stepmother and stepsisters. You pay for it with the platinum credit card he gave you, and you can feel your stepmother's gaze, the way her eyes have narrowed. She picks you apart with questions, those damned questions you've always been helpless against. They ask you what he's like, and you make it up. You give him Christopher's looks and Jalil's personality, with a little Senna to taste, just because you think it'll be easy to remember. They ask to meet him, and you hem and haw and make excuses. You barely see him, you protest, and at least you know that's true. They say it's weird, the way he's only around at night, working late, always gone before dawn. You think that yourself, sometimes. Where does he go during the day? Work? Really? Does he have another family? Does he keep someone else across town in another apartment? A girl for the day, a boy for the night. Maybe he's a serial killer, or mobster. You don't even know what he looks like, for God's sake. You could pass him on the sidewalk, or on the subway, and you'd never know. Three nights later you turn the light on. You're honestly not sure if you forget, if you just reflexively snap it on like you do when he isn't home, or you made the mistake of letting your stepmother's bullshit get to you for once in your life, but you turn the light on. He's gone before you even get a good look, before you realize anything more than blonde hair and eyes like ice and how tall he is, how big, and you never would have guessed. You want to stop him, you know you do, but you can't. You don't know why, but you can't. Maybe because you feel like you deserve this, that he deserves to be mad at you. You go back to the apartment for a few days, intent on surviving until you can scrape up the courage to go back. April is a whirlwind in the throes of pre-opening night. Senna crawls into your bed that first night and you get great satisfaction over kicking her out. Jalil and Christopher are oddly touchy-cozy whenever you see them, and you end up crawling into their bed, not quite crying. Christopher surprises you by hugging you first, wrapping himself tightly around you while Jalil pets your head, your shoulder. You work your way out from between their bodies the next morning. The key to the penthouse still works, keeps working. You sleep in your old apartment most nights, but you keep coming back here. You don't like it because it's empty now, empty in a way it wasn't before. You realize. It took you this long to realize. The same furniture, the same rooms, but now there are no sheets with his shape on them, no steam on the bathroom mirror, no cold cup of coffee sitting on the table, no newspaper with the missing business section. No life. A thousand little pieces of him and you never appreciated one. Because you wanted to see his face. You deserve this.",

She learns the difference between the truth one speaks and the truth that others hear. She learns what love is, and what it is not. She learns that she is beautiful, and that beauty is power.

At night she dreams - for even goddesses dream, sometimes - of what it might be like to bed the dark and brooding lord of the dead, whose hands were cold when he seized her out of the sunlight, and whose eyes are dark and unreadable. But when she is dreaming, she cannot help compare him to lecherous Zeus or violent Apollo or drunken Dionysus, and, strangely, the comparisons are favorable to dark, silent Hades, who at least is - slightly - kind.

She understands why Zeus married her to Hephaestus, sooty Hephaestus, Hephaestus without any ambition at all, Hephaestus who could never be talked into challenging Zeus, even by the most beautiful goddess ever. She even loves her crippled husband, in a casual sort of way. She is the goddess of love, after all. She understands Zeus's decision - that does not mean she likes it. Hephaestus was a logical choice for Aphrodite's husband, given that Zeus did not want the gods to fight over her, nor her husband to rebel. But Aphrodite had her eye on someone else entirely: Ares, the war god. Aphrodite's predecessor Ishtar was a goddess of love and war, after all; why should Aphrodite not emulate her? Ares is handsome and stupid and malleable, and could have been made to follow Aphrodite's slightest whims with ease. Nevertheless, she is married to Hephaestus, so she makes the best of it. She sleeps with her crippled husband once in a while, to keep him happy or to repay him for the priceless jewelry he crafts for her, and the rest of the time, she amuses herself with beautiful, doomed mortal lads, or - by preference - handsome, arrogant, stupid Ares. She flatters him, of course, assuring him that he is strong and brave, and that had she had her own choice she would have married him, and all of this is true. She flatters him, too, that he is far, far better in bed than her crippled husband is, but this is, rather to her own surprise, false. Ares is brusque and forceful even in bed, occupied with his own pleasure and not with hers, content to roll over and fall asleep as soon as he has spent himself within her. Crippled Hephaestus, knowing he is not as desirable, exerts himself to his utmost to see that she is pleased, not even daring to enter her until she has spent herself two or three times upon his fingers or his tongue. She rather likes bedding Hephaestus, as long as she keeps her eyes closed - but of course she never tells Ares that. Instead, she pets and makes much of him, telling him he is everything any woman could ever want in a man. Ares's hands are as hard as Hephaestus's are, though from weapons, not from tools; he comes to her bed reeking of blood and other, unmentionable things, and falls upon her hungrily, aroused by killing. So typical of a man, she thinks, and spreads her legs for him, because she is the goddess of carnal love, and this is a simple thing to give the god who gives her victories. She cannot help thinking of Hephaestus, who washes himself carefully before he dares enter her bedchamber, and takes pains to anoint himself with scents he knows please her. But Hephaestus will not bring her power, only gold; and so she spreads her legs for Ares, and tells him he is wonderful, and that she loves him dearly. It is even mostly true: she is the goddess of love, after all.",

    "text": "Ashes of Spring He wondered what exactly it was that drove him back to her day after day. Certainly there were mortals aplenty for him to take his pleasure with; willing or unwilling, none could resist him. It had been rather long since those below him began building large cities, began to be more interested in their own lives than remembering that the existence of those lives relied solely on the pleasure or wrath of the Gods of Olympus. But down in the meadows next to the seashore, a fair, lovely little thing finally caught his eye. She was the youngest daughter of Erechtheus, whose two other daughters had come to strange and terrifying fates themselves. Their little sister, Creusa, had just barely come out of childhood. She was a quiet girl, loving to sit by the sea and weave flowers into garlands for her hair, occasionally telling stories to her kitten or an invisible playmate she had made for herself. Spread by the strong, wild wind, her hair would come tumbling down her shoulders and fan out in strands of ruddy spun gold to frame her sweet, white face. He began to watch her every day, ignoring whatever else had concerned him before. He watched as she led her rather lonely life, having no one but a sharp tongued nurse to speak with, longing for the big sisters she had adored. For nearly five years, Creusa prayed for her sisters who had gone away. The eldest, Procnis, had left only to die, (the horribleness of her death was hidden from the little girl). Orithyia simply vanished one day in a huge gust of wind that had come from the banks of the Ilissus, a day on which Creusa had been sick with a cold and cooped inside. She had never seen her sister again. The god knew that the reason Creusa came to the cliffs was to perhaps be carried off in one of the great gusts that came off the ocean to see her beloved sister. She was not to know, of course, that Boreas had taken that lovely sister as his own, and that Apollo himself had warned the North Wind against touching his own chosen prize. She was too young to woo, but he wanted her desperately, this tiny kittenish girl of purity and sweetness. He wanted to sweep her up in his arms and take her as his own, to lay her down on his exquisite golden sheets, wrap her in silk and soft warm covers, to pull her sweet tiny body beneath his and possess her--and to keep her here with him in his divine halls for always. This one would not come willingly. She was too young to understand what he wanted from her, and he had no intention of waiting for her to grow older. He wanted her now: more than Cassandra, more than Daphne, more than Coronis, or Marpessa. She was made for him, the silent sunny child, meant to leave her life of refined loneliness, to submit to him and not be sold off to some arrogant man who would lock her sunshine away and meet her light with brutality and mortal clumsiness. Only, it would be too long--too long to wait for the proper permission to take her up to his heavenly halls. But in the meantime, he would have her. Have her by the roaring ocean she loved, caressed by the sea breezes and sweet air. As a child, she would fear him, but it did not signify. Creusa belonged to him, and before long she would learn to look upon him with love and devotion. * * * Creusa took her time as she carefully picked her way down the rocky steps of the shore. She didn't often come this way, as the rocks were dark and sharp. There was, however, a dark cave carved into the hillside where occasionally she stayed when the sun was too hot to bear. She would lie down on a little smooth shelf, on the edge of one wall, and sometimes fall asleep listening to the waves and roaring wind. Today was cold and gusty, however, and after being cooped up inside for most of the morning, the fresh air felt wonderful to her. The yellow poppies were in bloom in the early spring, and she hastily removed her veil and began piling them, bright and cheerful against the gray of the sky, into the cloth. For a long time she sat on the dry, cool grass, choosing the freshest blooms and laying them carefully next to each other. She wanted to stay longer--nurse was in a horrible mood after mother had left, and she didn't want to go back--but it was getting rather cold, and she had forgotten her new blue cloak, the one Mother had woven for her thirteenth birthday, with the beautiful flowers embroidered around the hem in vibrant yellows and reds and pinks. Mother was coming home today, and she had made the trip specifically to bring home all the brightest flowers she could find. She would even brave Nurse's wrath to arrange them in bunches in the great hall, to cheer her up after the long ride. Finally, Creusa rose to her feet, made sure she had the bundle securely in her hand, and headed up the cliff. But at the top, where the winds were the strongest, she walked abruptly into a tall, immoveable shape. Starting immediately, shaken and alarmed, she looked up to see the most beautiful man she had ever seen in her life appear out of nowhere. He hadn't been there before. She was sure, because she always checked the cliff top for a stray sheep or dangerous bull before wandering across the land. The windswept plain had been empty until this stranger appeared suddenly in front of her. She couldn't help but stop and simply stare at him. He was tall--taller than any man she had ever seen, but neither gangly nor bulky. Indeed, by his divinely beautiful face and noble presence, the knowledge of what he must be entered her heart like a dagger. Child as she was, however, no notion of crawling or obeisance came to her. She simply looked at him in wonder, at his delicately crafted tunic and robes, the radiant gold of his hair, the way he was looking at her as intently as she was looking at him. Finally the great stranger smiled, a gentle smile such as one might give to a child, and spoke her name. \"Creusa.\" His voice was soft, caressing, loving in a way she remembered her mother used to speak to her when she was but a toddling baby. For an instant she felt an overwhelming urge to walk over to him and beg to be wrapped in his arms, embraced and rocked in comfort and warmth. She did the only thing that she could possibly have done at that point. To come across a God, standing and breathing in one's way like any other mortal was one thing, but to have that God actually know, and then speak one's name--that was something else. To cover the squeak that had escaped her mouth, Creusa managed the lowest curtsey she could conjure, and whispered \"My Lord.\" She heard the soft crunching of footfalls of bare feet on grass, and then felt a strong hand under her chin, lifting her face up. \"My child,\" the God said softly, \"Do you know who I am?\" And she did, at that moment. There simply was no other this Being could be. \"The great God of Light, my Lord. Apollo.\" This last word she said in a whisper, hardly daring to speak it aloud to its rightful owner. Radiance and Beauty personified. How many statues had she seen? Skilled and crude, clothed and gloriously bare, and yet they were all mere heaps of rubble--cold, unfeeling stone next to the blazing glory of the man standing before her. He could take her right now, he knew. Scoop her up in his arms and bear her down to that dark cave, just as he had planned, and take his pleasure from her terrified body. He closed his eyes in anticipation as he imagined her sweet flesh, the softness of her breasts, the whiteness of her thighs, the tight heat waiting for him between her legs, her golden hair falling about her face, the silk of it as he threaded his hands through it. He would, he knew, soon. But she was even lovelier than he had envisioned, sweeter, shining inside with a white pure light few maidens had in such abundance. Truly, any maiden he had wanted--not with simply the heated love of desire--but divinely, as a God--had had this shining pure light. Cassandra had had it, but she had been cold, shunning love for reverence and holy worship. Coronis had had it, but her overabundance of passionate desire had consumed her in the end. And so he stood there, tall, regal, supremely beautiful and absolute in his divinity, and stretched his hand out toward her. \"Come here, Creusa,\" he said softly. It was not in her to resist, and Creusa moved to the God, a heavy, strange sensation filling her more with each step. Far too soon, she had reached him, and he had reached around her and pulled her against himself with one swift movement. Too startled to even shriek, she simply froze against him, half expecting to be incinerated where she stood. But he was simply warm, as mortals are, smelling of sunshine on roses and the purest sweet breezes. The next moment the world tilted and she was held up in his arms--not cradled--but slung across his shoulder and chest the way women carry young children. Indeed, she had never felt so small. \"Good girl,\" he whispered against her hair, and he began to walk. She knew already where he was headed. So this was to be her fate. She had indeed heard tell more times than she could count the stories of heroes, those men born of a God's love for a mortal woman. It always seemed to Creusa that the Gods were horribly selfish beings, to impregnate a girl and leave her to live or perish as luck would have it. She secretly and fearfully scorned the great god Zeus for these proclivities, his infidelities. She worshiped the maiden goddesses--the wisdom and dignity of Athena, the warmth and sweetness of Hestia, and the beauty and wildness of Artemis. If Apollo was implicated in these stories she tried not to listen. She worshiped the God, for his beauty above mortals, for his prophecies that guided the race of men, for his justice, and for his gifts of healing and the divinity of music. She did not want to think he could be prone to such base actions. And now here he was, her adored God, the one she had prayed to and talked to in secret, whom she had worshiped so fervently, carrying her as his prize to a dark cave under the sea. She didn't want to go, didn't want to disappear into that darkness, to leave the comfort of the sun. She could only look up at Helios and his chariot at the last moment, somehow through clenching throat trying to vocalize her terror and pleading. The Sun ignored her, though feeling a twinge of pity for the stricken girl, another human misery adding to the myriads he had seen on his long journeys across the sky. It was only a few steps from the cliff to the cave, but it was the defining moment of Creusa's life. Along the rocky carved-out steps pretty flowers yellow as the sun were strewn, their fragile blossoms whipped and torn by the uncaring wind.",

    "text": "\"Zeus!\" The King of the Gods almost rolled his eyes heavenward before realizing he was already there. Who do I look to for help? he wondered half-heartedly as he heard sharp footsteps approach his chambers. The doors swung open violently to admit a dark-haired beauty. A clearly furious dark-haired beauty. Zeus opened his mouth to inquire after her presence, but the woman spoiled his attempt with a dismissive wave of her hand and her barking voice. \"What is the meaning of this?\" she demanded, her eyes flashing dangerously. For a moment, Zeus was strongly reminded of his wife and wondered if she'd, for once, been the one to step out on him and give birth to the goddess standing in front of him. Said goddess, however, continued to speak before he could follow that train of thought: \"Have you dared to bar me from the mortal realm?\" \"My dear Hekate-\" he began. \"Don't 'dear' me, Zeus,\" Hekate spat. \"Your charms may work on the pretty fools you so love to seduce, but I want answers, and I want them now.\" Zeus raised his eyebrows. \"Any how would you even know if I barred you from mortals?\" he asked smoothly. \"Your place is in the Underworld, if I recall correctly.\" \"Don't get facetious with me,\" Hekate responded. \"If you do indeed recall correctly, I have equal shares in heaven, sea, and earth, and every right to walk among them as I please.\" \"You would abandon Queen Persephone for one of these errant strolls?\" Zeus asked. Hekate's eyes flashed again. \"Your daughter is more than capable of handling herself, and I do not take errant strolls.\" \"No indeed.\" Zeus leaned forward in his seat. \"I believe you've found yourself quite the paramour. Medea, isn't that her name? She's causing a bit of a stir. I can almost hear her angry outbursts all the way up here.\" \"She is my priestess and my responsibility. I won't have you interfering-\" \"Oh, but she's more than just a responsibility to you,\" Zeus interrupted. \"Don't think to lie to me, Hekate. I know all about your relationship with the mortal, and you've done a better job of filling her bed than reigning in your wild devotee.\" Hekate lifted her chin. \"I have no reason to lie to you. I love Medea. Her anger is completely justified, and if I must prove so, I will.\" \"We shall see,\" Zeus said. \"But as it stands, your relationship with her is forbidden.\" \"On what grounds?\" Hekate protested. \"You, of all people, have got a lot of nerve to prevent me from romancing a mortal!\" \"Now listen to me!\" Zeus thundered, finally reaching the end of his patience. He rose from his seat to tower over Hekate. \"Loving a mortal only leads to tragedy. I will not have you neglecting your duties over a rebellious heathen.\" \"My duties have never suffered anything and you know it,\" Hekate managed to say through gritted teeth. \"All the more reason to stop you now, before things get out of hand.\" He stopped Hekate's protest with a glance. \"I will not change my mind. You may leave.\" Hekate glared at him fiercely before turning on her heel and walking away. Zeus sat down wearily. Somehow, he suspected that this moment wasn't a victory for him. *** \"Oh, Hek,\" Hermes said, guiding the most recent batch of dead souls into Hekate's charge. \"I think what old Zeusie is trying to tell you is that you need a man.\" He winked at her. Hekate snorted. \"Oh really? And what man would be brave enough to wed me?\" Hermes grinned mischievously and cocked his head, a perfect pose of innocence. \"I would, darling, you know that. After dealing with Apollo, you can't be any worse, right?\" Hekate tried glaring at him, but quickly found herself relaxing at his incessant teasing instead. Hermes continued, \"Seriously though, think about it. No woman's ever made a permanent relationship with another woman, except for Iphis, and she was turned into a man before marrying Ianthe. Why should you be the exception?\" Hekate's shoulders slumped. \"Because I really love her,\" she said, her expression more open than it ever had been around her flighty friend. Hermes gave her a sympathetic smile and rested a hand on her shoulder. \"I know, darling. But you've been at crossroads before. Ouranos' balls, you're the goddess of them. You'll get through.\" \"Being at a crossroads means I have a choice, Hermes.\" Hekate reached her hand out to touch his hair, but the movement was stopped by an unseen force separating earth from underworld. \"But I can't walk the path back into the mortal realm anymore.\" Hermes jerked his chin over to the souls waiting to be led to their afterlife. \"How do you think they feel?\" *** Later, back in her home, Hekate reflected on her conversation with Hermes. She'd looked over at the shades, who'd started to look increasingly uncomfortable in their unfamiliar surroundings, and for the first time felt sorry for them. She realized that all of them were irrevocably separated from their loved ones by the veils of life and death. As she moved around her workshop tending to her potions - the recipes of which, she realized with a pang, she'd taught to Medea herself - she remembered seeing, for the first time, the grief and fear in the eyes of those she escorted to their afterlives. For a moment, she felt guilty for wanting more when she already had the gifts of immortality and divine powers. But then she paused as she reached the potion that granted youth after a complex ritual of dismemberment. Medea had used this potion to perfection, tricking the silly daughters of Pelias into killing their own father. Medea was beautiful when she worked. Hekate stared at the bubbling liquid as the future played out in her mind. Medea would grow old alone and die. Hekate would greet her lover at the gates of the Underworld, and once Medea crossed the river Lethe, she'd forget every moment spent with her chosen goddess. Every lesson, every devotion. Hekate wouldn't forget like the souls she guides. She would spend eternity watching what she lost from across the river. Fear filled her suddenly, quickly followed by a wave of fury. Anger she could deal with, so she allowed it to mask the terror. She'd chosen her path a long time ago, and, by the gods, she was going to walk it. *** \"Zeus!\" Hekate threw open the doors and walked right up to Zeus, invading the King of the Gods' personal space. Eye to eye with him, she said, \"I want Medea, and I will not take 'no' for an answer.\" \"Do you know what your priestess has done?\" Zeus asked, appearing completely unruffled by Hekate's challenge. \"Apparently her ranting and raving weren't getting enough results for her peace of mind. She burned the king of Corinth and his daughter to death and then murdered her own children to spite her husband.\" Hekate nodded. \"I know. Guider of souls, remember?\" If ever she had doubted Medea's willpower (she hadn't), she had no cause to any longer. \"Wipe that smile off your face,\" Zeus said. \"The mortal needs to be judged for desecrating her familial roles.\" \"Says the god who waged war on his own father and imprisoned him in Tartarus.\" \"He ate my brothers and sisters!\" \"Her husband broke his marriage vows!\" \"And she didn't do the same in your bed?\" \"Unlike some people,\" Hekate said, looking at Zeus pointedly, \"I do not take marriage vows lightly. The last time she was in my bed was before she met Jason.\" Zeus snorted. \"Zeus, I am serious. Yes, I visit her. She is my priestess, after all. But she has not been my lover while she was married to that sorry excuse for a mortal. She needs me now, Zeus.\" Hekate's voice changed to almost pleading, her expression plaintive. Zeus stroked his beard, and Hekate held her breath as he thought. \"No.\" Hekate's breath rushed from her body. \"Why not?\" she asked, completely confused and frustrated. \"Because she is a mortal, still married, and a woman!\" Hekate shook her head. \"You think you can sleep with mortals whenever you want and just forget them when you're done. You immortalize boys at a whim and then leave them to their eternal lives while you move on to your next conquest.\" She looked Zeus straight in the eye, raw honesty is every feature of her face and in the tone of her voice. \"Medea means more to me than everyone you've ever been with has to you; boys, girls, even your wife. I would devote my immortal life to one woman, even without the bonds of marriage to keep me with her, and you deny me that path? Where has your justice gone?\" Zeus stood immobile for so long Hekate thought he'd somehow locked eyes with Medusa. Finally, he inclined his head and spoke one word: \"Go.\" It was all the permission she needed. She was gone before the vibrations of Zeus' voice reached the edges of the room. *** They stumbled into Hekate's inner sanctum, laughing and clinging to each other as if fused together. Somehow they made it to the bed, Medea falling back onto it and pulling Hekate with her. Their hands roamed over each other's bodies, pulling off clothes and eliciting gasps and moans of pleasure. Desperation soon arched their backs, and afterward they lay next to each other, their panting the only sound accompanying their physical bliss. \"Hekate...\" Medea began, uncharacteristically hesitant, running her fingers along the goddess' belly. \"My children...?\" Hekate stopped Medea's hand and kissed her fingertips. \"Just fine. I escorted them to Elysium myself.\" \"Good,\" Medea murmured. Hekate gave her a calculating look. \"Do you wish to see them again?\" \"No.\" Medea quickly shook her head and leaned in for a chaste kiss. \"It's time for me to move on. I made a mistake by choosing Jason over you. I won't make it again.\" Hekate smiled so brightly that Medea was nearly dazzled. The goddess pulled her lover closer, and for that night, as every night for the rest of eternity, they made love.",

    "text": "Thetis sent her daughter to us when she turned nine; a lovely girl, slender as an almond tree. Her hair was darker than her mother's, reddish-gold in hue. We hid her true name from her (and what mother would name her child for grief?) that we might protect her; we clothed her in white wool and taught her to spin. Before she came to us, she had run wild, an untamed weed; beautiful in blossom, perhaps, but requiring the gentle, guiding hands of the master gardener to bring her from bloom to fruitful womanhood. Her father had entrusted her education to his herb-masters and star-watchers, and she had learned only the wisdom of men in her youth; she has forgotten how to blush, to laugh, to be soft. The calluses on her feet will, no doubt, wear away with time and care. We made certain of the girl's virginity before admitting her to maiden chambers. She learns a softened gait and a modest speech; for the first time in her life, her locks are combed and plaited, her hair is a crown. We did these things for our foster-daughter out of love. Thetis feared that because she was her mother, men might look to her proud glance to find there the prowess of Zeus, the arm of Poseidon, the fleet feet of Hermes. We took her into our arms to teach the modesty of Demeter, the softness of Aphrodite, Persephone's maiden grace. She begged us to be allowed to wield arms, to carry a bow on her shoulders, to never marry. At her mother's request, we denied her these things, and brought her up, secluded. In the company of women, she learned to tame her willfulness and lust. We kept her from the harbor and the shore. *** When he is sixteen, Achilles sneaks out of the house. A ship has come from Ithaca. He has heard the girls giggling about the stropping sailors, cracking bawdy jokes between themselves (always careful, though, they know full well that they would be whipped if any man overheard their talk of penises and plum-rich arseholes). As far as he can tell, it's the usual merchant ship, laden with cloth and bronze - spears and swords for the men; mirrors and girdles for the women. Some of Lykomedes' household are puttering among the wares, offering bargain prices for coarse woolen cloth and cheap jewelry. Achilles veils his red-gold braids -- he knows that his hair would give him away if he were to uncover his head - and walks down to the docks, where sailors are smiling at servant women, carefully pretending that the well-bred women do not exist. In his fine white dress and veil, the sailors don't give him a passing glance. The boy lingers among the cloth and jewels for a little while, pretending to choose some bauble for himself. Tall spears fill the corner of his vision. He longs to pick one up, feel its heft in his arm, remember what it was like to throw a spear, to hold a sword, to wrestle in the mud with Chiron, before collapsing exhausted in the summer sun. A man of about forty is sitting by the weapons, wrapped in a grey cloak. He briefly glances at Achilles, then dismisses him as unimportant, scenery, a girl to be ignored. Achilles is relieved. At least he won't have to explain why he can't, even after seven years, tear himself away from the weapons; the gnawing feeling that he should have had another life. His right hand reaches towards a spear. Breasts shift uncomfortably beneath his dress. \"What do you want?\" the grey-clad man asks. \"Oh,\" Achilles stammers. He has never been caught with weapons, not for years, not since his mother delivered him as a hostage to Lykomedes. \"I... well, I was just wondering how strong a man had to be to wield such a mighty weapon.\" He tries a nervous giggle. By all the gods, please let this man think that he is just some overawed girl looking for a display of machismo. The man holds Achilles' gaze. \"What is your name?\" \"Pyrrha.\" The response is automatic. Achilles has been forbidden his own name for so many years that sometimes he forgets that it was ever his. \"Well, Pyrrha,\" the man says, slowly, as though he is digesting some great thought, \"a very strong man might never wield this spear well. A very weak one, however, might find a way, with skill and cunning, to turn weakness into a weapon, and such a man could be mighty with this spear.\" Achilles isn't sure if the man is flirting with him. In some ways, his voice and his eyes remind him of Chiron, in the days before he started to bleed, before his mother decided that he would be a girl. \"I am Odysseus,\" the grey-cloaked man says. \"Like the king of Ithaca?\" Odysseus smiles. \"Yes, exactly like the king of Ithaca. It's good to know they don't fill maidens' heads with fluff in Skyros.\" Achilles' brow creases. \"Well... if you're the king of Ithaca, what are you doing here? You haven't been received by the court; you're down on the docks selling cheap cloth. It doesn't make sense.\" Odysseus' smile has widened; he looks very much like a cat that has cornered a mouse and can now play it for as long as he likes. \"We're here because of an oracle,\" he says. \"The bitch at Delphi told us that we would find Thetis' son here, and that he would be the greatest fighter the Argives have ever seen. She also told us that he would be the first damn person to touch a spear once we came ashore. So that's a hecatomb wasted.\" That afternoon, the Ithacan ship lifts her anchor and beats to windward, heading East. Wrapping a linen bandage around his chest, Achilles prays. \"Mother, I have obeyed thee, though thy commands were hard to bear; too obedient have I been: now they demand me, and I go to the Trojan war and the Argolic fleet.\"",

    "text": "Once upon a time, in a faraway land known as Milan, there was a boy named Pato, and he possessed a marvelous goalscoring touch. He loved nothing as much as scoring goals (except for maybe looking in the mirror so he could fix his hair), and he was very proud of his goalscoring touch. But one morning he woke up and discovered that his touch was gone. No matter how many times he tried to score, the ball always went high or wide or off the crossbar or straight at the keeper or, worst of all, the offside whistle had gone before he could even shoot. Pato could not bear to have lost his dearest possession (aside from his hair), and so he went to the home of his lover, the goddess Barbara, and sat before her door and began to lament the loss of his goalscoring touch. \"Barbara!\" he cried. \"If your father truly is a god and you truly love me, how could you have allowed my goalscoring touch to have been stolen? For I would not have lost it if it had not been taken from me. Indeed, I fear you have lied to me in some wise, that perhaps you love me not or your father be not a god, if you have let my goalscoring touch fall into the hands of another. For you know I love nothing so much as to score magnificent goals, and if you love me, you would want me to have what I love, and if your father is a god, you would have the power to secure it, and therefore verily - \" And then he broke off, for the goddess Barbara had opened her door and stepped outside, and straightaway tripped over him. The heel of one of her Ferragamo pumps drove into his thigh, and she dropped her briefcase on his foot. \"Pato!\" she said. \"What on earth are you doing sitting on my doormat?\" \"I am lamenting the loss of my goalscoring touch,\" Pato explained. \"How long have you been sitting there?\" demanded the goddess Barbara. \"There will be a dozen pictures of you in the tabloids tomorrow. Why didn't you ring the bell?\" Pato ignored her questions, took a deep breath and broke into his wail anew. \"Barbara! If your father truly is a god and you truly love me, how could you have allowed my goalscoring touch to have been stolen? For I would not have lost it if - \" \"Pato,\" Barbara snapped. \"I have a board meeting in fifteen minutes. Go inside and wait for me, and when I am finished with my work for the day I will tell you how to get your goalscoring touch back.\" \"Yes, Barbara,\" Pato said meekly, and did as he was told. When the goddess Barbara returned from her business meeting, she summoned Pato to her home office and said, \"The secret of your lost goalscoring touch lies with the Samba Dancer of Santos, but he will not tell you unless he is compelled. You must go to his home and lie in wait, and when he returns from his night of drunken debauchery, you must grab hold of him and not let go. He will dance every dance that he knows, and you must match him step for step without releasing him, until he is exhausted and agrees to tell you what you wish to know. Do you understand?\" Pato stared at her blankly. \"Grab him and hold on and dance with him until he's tired and says he'll tell you where your goalscoring touch has gone and how to get it back,\" she said. \"I grab him and hold on and dance with him until he's tired and says he'll tell me where my goalscoring touch has gone and how to get it back,\" Pato repeated obediently. \"Very good,\" the goddess Barbara said. \"Now go.\" Pato turned to leave, then turned back. \"But, Barbara,\" he said. \"Where will I find the Samba Dancer of Santos?\" The goddess Barbara sighed. \"In Santos, Pato.\" \"Oh, okay,\" Pato said. He turned around again and left, pausing only briefly to check his hair in the mirror on the wall. \"Mother was right,\" Barbara muttered. \"Dumb and pretty has drawbacks after all.\" * As the goddess Barbara had instructed, Pato went to Santos and lay in wait for the Samba Dancer, and when he came stumbling back from the dance club at five in the morning, Pato leapt out and grabbed him in a ballroom dance hold. Just as Barbara had warned him, the Samba Dancer of Santos strove mightily to dance out of his arms, but Pato matched him step for step, until finally the Dancer collapsed against his chest. \"All right, all right, I give up! I've been out dancing and doing shots all night, this totally isn't fair.\" \"But you give up?\" Pato asked carefully, because it was always important to do exactly what the goddess Barbara said. \"And you'll tell me what I want to know?\" \"Yeah, yeah, fine. I'd make you ask what you want to know but I know everything so I know that already. Let me go, I need to sit down before I throw up, and trust me, jello shots do not look as pretty the second time around.\" Pato released the Samba Dancer of Santos, who took a few tottering steps and collapsed on his couch. \"Right. So, your goalscoring touch is gone because you have angered the god of the people of Sweden. You weren't paying attention to what you were doing, and you let Nesta dislocate his shoulder, and he was carried off to the underworld where players go when they retire. Zlatan was very upset. They hadn't even played a whole season together. So he went down into the underworld to bring Nesta back. \"At the entrance of the underworld is a mighty three-headed creature whose duty is to prevent any man whose name is still numbered amongst a first eleven from entering. The head on the left has a round face and dishwater-blond hair and pasty skin, and the head on the right has a round face and dark hair and dark skin, and the head in the center has very disreputable-looking facial hair, although Zlatan was hardly in a position to judge. Zlatan approached the beast and said, \"'I am Zlatan, and I am a god to the people of Sweden, and I have come to the underworld to find Alessandro Nesta and bring him back with me. Let me pass.' \"The creature shook its middle head, which said, 'Zlatan Ibrahimovic, we guard the country of retired souls. None who yet plays may enter here. Return when you are too old and crippled to hobble off the bench, even in Italy, even for Milan, and then we shall let you pass.' \"'I am Zlatan,' said Zlatan, 'and you will let me pass now.' And then he kicked the creature in each of its three heads. \"The creature did not fall down dead or even unconscious as Zlatan had expected, since he had a great deal of experience in kicking people in the head. However, it is a little known fact that to the three-headed beast that guards the underworld, a kick in the head is truest gesture of friendship that exists. It did not fall, but all three heads began to weep tears of a shared love of manly violence, and it did embrace Zlatan with all six of its arms, saying, \"'At last, one who understands us!' \"'At last, a true companion of our soul!' \"'Oh my friend, I am so happy I could bite you!' \"'I am Antonio!' \"'I am Rodney!' \"And the last head, whose name is Rino, bit Zlatan on the shoulder, for he was too overwhelmed with emotion to speak. So Zlatan was allowed to pass into the underworld by the three-headed guardian, and next found himself at the River of Penalties Missed. On the near shore was the boat which ferries footballers to the long retirement from which none returns, and within the boat was the ferryman. Zlatan approached him and said, \"'I am Zlatan, and I am a god to the people of Sweden, and I have come to the underworld to find Alessandro Nesta and bring him back with me. Bring me across the river.' \"'I am SuperPippo,' said the ferryman, 'and I travel many times a day between the realm of the active and the realm of the retired. But the souls of the unretired are too heavy. I do not have the strength to row you across.' \"'Do you not?' asked Zlatan. 'Indeed that is a shame, for I brought you this Scudetto as payment for your labor. But if it is impossible - ' \"'Impossible is nothing,' snapped the ferryman, already holding out his hands. 'Give that to me, and I will take you across the river. Oh, my precious darling,' he cooed, cradling the trophy in his hands. Zlatan climbed into the boat, which immediately sank so low in the water that it lapped over the sides. 'Sit still,' ordered SuperPippo. He placed the Scudetto safely in the middle of the boat, took up his oars, and with great effort rowed to the other shore. \"Once he climbed ashore, Zlatan made his way to the court of the Dread Lord Guardiola, who rules over retired souls. And when at last Zlatan stood before the Dread Lord and his Queen, he said, \"'I am Zlatan, and I am a god to the people of Sweden, and I have come to the underworld to find Alessandro Nesta and bring him back with me. Bring him to me, and let us return to the world above.' \"'That's all very interesting,' said Dread Lord Guardiola. 'But why exactly should I do that?' \"'I am Zlatan,' Zlatan repeated. 'Small Swedish children sing paeans to my prowess with a football. And I will fuck your wife if you don't.' \"'He's rather good-looking,' said Figo, Queen of the Trolls. 'I like a strong nose. I'd probably let him, if it came down to it.' \"'Oh, fine,' said Dread Lord Guardiola. 'Alessandro Nesta, whoever you are, you are free to follow this hooligan back to the upper world.' \"'Just remember, don't look back!' Queen Figo shouted after them, trolling, as was his nature. \"And as was thus inevitable, having passed again through the gates and across the river and up to the entrance where his three-headed friend awaited, as he passed the threshold into the world above, Zlatan glanced back to make certain that Nesta was behind him and broke his compact with the Dread Lord and his Queen. \"'You stupid fucking fuck!' said Nesta. 'Why the fuck did you do that? Now I have to go back and be retired forever! Fuck you!' \"'Fuck me?' said Zlatan. 'Fuck you, you fucking pussy! What, do you want to be retired forever?' \"'Of course not, you dumb fuck!' said Nesta. \"'Then why don't you fight to stay, you stupid useless piece of shit!' \"And so Nesta threw himself at Zlatan in an attempt to strangle him, but try as he might, Zlatan could not carry him across the threshold into the world of the unretired. 'I AM ZLATAN!' he shouted. 'I AM A GOD TO THE PEOPLE OF SWEDEN, AND I CAME TO BRING ALESSANDRO NESTA BACK WITH ME, AND I WILL NOT LEAVE WITHOUT HIM! I WILL DESTROY YOUR FUCKING ARMIES OF TIKI-TAKA MIDGETS! I WILL FUCK YOUR SISTER! ALL OF YOUR SISTERS! AND YOUR DAUGHTERS, AND ANY AT LEAST MODERATELY GOOD-LOOKING COUSINS, AND - ' \"'For the love of Paolo Maldini,' said Dread Lord Guardiola. 'Just take him and go, so long as you never come back.' \"And that is the story of how Zlatan Ibrahimovic brought Alessandro Nesta back from the underworld.\" \"Oh,\" said Pato. \"But if he got Nesta back in the end, why is he still angry at me?\" \"Ah,\" said the Samba Dancer of Santos. \"That's just because he doesn't like your face. Sacrifice a pelican, a swordfish and an unusually large ass to the god of the people of Sweden and pray for forgiveness, and your goalscoring touch will return.\" And so Pato did, and they all lived happily ever after, or at least until his next stupid mistake.",
    "sentences": [
      "Once upon a time, in a faraway land known as Milan, there was a boy named Pato, and he possessed a marvelous goalscoring touch.",
      "He loved nothing as much as scoring goals (except for maybe looking in the mirror so he could fix his hair), and he was very proud of his goalscoring touch.",
      "But one morning he woke up and discovered that his touch was gone.",
      "No matter how many times he tried to score, the ball always went high or wide or off the crossbar or straight at the keeper or, worst of all, the offside whistle had gone before he could even shoot.",
      "Pato could not bear to have lost his dearest possession (aside from his hair), and so he went to the home of his lover, the goddess Barbara, and sat before her door and began to lament the loss of his goalscoring touch.",
      "\"Barbara!\"",
      "he cried.",
      "\"If your father truly is a god and you truly love me, how could you have allowed my goalscoring touch to have been stolen?",
      "For I would not have lost it if it had not been taken from me.",
      "Indeed, I fear you have lied to me in some wise, that perhaps you love me not or your father be not a god, if you have let my goalscoring touch fall into the hands of another.",
      "For you know I love nothing so much as to score magnificent goals, and if you love me, you would want me to have what I love, and if your father is a god, you would have the power to secure it, and therefore verily - \" And then he broke off, for the goddess Barbara had opened her door and stepped outside, and straightaway tripped over him.",
      "The heel of one of her Ferragamo pumps drove into his thigh, and she dropped her briefcase on his foot.",
      "\"Pato!\"",
      "she said.",
      "\"What on earth are you doing sitting on my doormat?\"",
      "\"I am lamenting the loss of my goalscoring touch,\" Pato explained.",
      "\"How long have you been sitting there?\" demanded the goddess Barbara.",
      "\"There will be a dozen pictures of you in the tabloids tomorrow.",
      "Why didn't you ring the bell?\" Pato ignored her questions, took a deep breath and broke into his wail anew.",
      "\"Barbara!",
      "If your father truly is a god and you truly love me, how could you have allowed my goalscoring touch to have been stolen?",
      "For I would not have lost it if - \" \"Pato,\" Barbara snapped.",
      "\"I have a board meeting in fifteen minutes.",
      "Go inside and wait for me, and when I am finished with my work for the day I will tell you how to get your goalscoring touch back.\"",
      "\"Yes, Barbara,\" Pato said meekly, and did as he was told.",
      "When the goddess Barbara returned from her business meeting, she summoned Pato to her home office and said, \"The secret of your lost goalscoring touch lies with the Samba Dancer of Santos, but he will not tell you unless he is compelled.",
      "You must go to his home and lie in wait, and when he returns from his night of drunken debauchery, you must grab hold of him and not let go.",
      "He will dance every dance that he knows, and you must match him step for step without releasing him, until he is exhausted and agrees to tell you what you wish to know.",
      "Do you understand?\" Pato stared at her blankly.",
      "\"Grab him and hold on and dance with him until he's tired and says he'll tell you where your goalscoring touch has gone and how to get it back,\" she said.",
      "\"I grab him and hold on and dance with him until he's tired and says he'll tell me where my goalscoring touch has gone and how to get it back,\" Pato repeated obediently.",
      "\"Very good,\" the goddess Barbara said.",
      "\"Now go.\"",
      "Pato turned to leave, then turned back.",
      "\"But, Barbara,\" he said.",
      "\"Where will I find the Samba Dancer of Santos?\"",
      "The goddess Barbara sighed.",
      "\"In Santos, Pato.\"",
      "\"Oh, okay,\" Pato said.",
      "He turned around again and left, pausing only briefly to check his hair in the mirror on the wall.",
      "\"Mother was right,\" Barbara muttered.",
      "\"Dumb and pretty has drawbacks after all.\"",
      "* As the goddess Barbara had instructed, Pato went to Santos and lay in wait for the Samba Dancer, and when he came stumbling back from the dance club at five in the morning, Pato leapt out and grabbed him in a ballroom dance hold.",
      "Just as Barbara had warned him, the Samba Dancer of Santos strove mightily to dance out of his arms, but Pato matched him step for step, until finally the Dancer collapsed against his chest.",
      "\"All right, all right, I give up!",
      "I've been out dancing and doing shots all night, this totally isn't fair.\"",
      "\"But you give up?\" Pato asked carefully, because it was always important to do exactly what the goddess Barbara said.",
      "\"And you'll tell me what I want to know?\"",
      "\"Yeah, yeah, fine.",
      "I'd make you ask what you want to know but I know everything so I know that already.",
      "Let me go, I need to sit down before I throw up, and trust me, jello shots do not look as pretty the second time around.\"",
      "Pato released the Samba Dancer of Santos, who took a few tottering steps and collapsed on his couch.",
      "\"Right.",
      "So, your goalscoring touch is gone because you have angered the god of the people of Sweden.",
      "You weren't paying attention to what you were doing, and you let Nesta dislocate his shoulder, and he was carried off to the underworld where players go when they retire.",
      "Zlatan was very upset.",
      "They hadn't even played a whole season together.",
      "So he went down into the underworld to bring Nesta back.",
      "\"At the entrance of the underworld is a mighty three-headed creature whose duty is to prevent any man whose name is still numbered amongst a first eleven from entering.",
      "The head on the left has a round face and dishwater-blond hair and pasty skin, and the head on the right has a round face and dark hair and dark skin, and the head in the center has very disreputable-looking facial hair, although Zlatan was hardly in a position to judge.",
      "Zlatan approached the beast and said, \"'I am Zlatan, and I am a god to the people of Sweden, and I have come to the underworld to find Alessandro Nesta and bring him back with me.",
      "Let me pass.'",
      "\"The creature shook its middle head, which said, 'Zlatan Ibrahimovic, we guard the country of retired souls.",
      "None who yet plays may enter here.",
      "Return when you are too old and crippled to hobble off the bench, even in Italy, even for Milan, and then we shall let you pass.'",
      "\"'I am Zlatan,' said Zlatan, 'and you will let me pass now.'",
      "And then he kicked the creature in each of its three heads.",
      "\"The creature did not fall down dead or even unconscious as Zlatan had expected, since he had a great deal of experience in kicking people in the head.",
      "However, it is a little known fact that to the three-headed beast that guards the underworld, a kick in the head is truest gesture of friendship that exists.",
      "It did not fall, but all three heads began to weep tears of a shared love of manly violence, and it did embrace Zlatan with all six of its arms, saying, \"'At last, one who understands us!'",
      "\"'At last, a true companion of our soul!'",
      "\"'Oh my friend, I am so happy I could bite you!'",
      "\"'I am Antonio!'",
      "\"'I am Rodney!'",
      "\"And the last head, whose name is Rino, bit Zlatan on the shoulder, for he was too overwhelmed with emotion to speak.",
      "So Zlatan was allowed to pass into the underworld by the three-headed guardian, and next found himself at the River of Penalties Missed.",
      "On the near shore was the boat which ferries footballers to the long retirement from which none returns, and within the boat was the ferryman.",
      "Zlatan approached him and said, \"'I am Zlatan, and I am a god to the people of Sweden, and I have come to the underworld to find Alessandro Nesta and bring him back with me.",
      "Bring me across the river.'",
      "\"'I am SuperPippo,' said the ferryman, 'and I travel many times a day between the realm of the active and the realm of the retired.",
      "But the souls of the unretired are too heavy.",
      "I do not have the strength to row you across.'",
      "\"'Do you not?' asked Zlatan. '",
      "Indeed that is a shame, for I brought you this Scudetto as payment for your labor.",
      "But if it is impossible - ' \"'Impossible is nothing,' snapped the ferryman, already holding out his hands. '",
      "Give that to me, and I will take you across the river.",
      "Oh, my precious darling,' he cooed, cradling the trophy in his hands.",

    "text": "The Muses are immortal, and they cannot recall when they first came into the world. They are shaped by mortal belief, and their knowledge of their own beginning changes as new tales are told and new songs are sung. In the early days, it does not matter. They dwell in the shining palace atop Mount Olympos, drinking nectar and ambrosia. By day, they dance before Apollo, while the brilliant sunlight gleams from his hair and his golden harp, and at night they share the rites of Dionysos, wilder but no less beautiful. But things change. The sacrifices grow less frequent, and so do the hymns that give the gods their form. At last Polyhymnia looks at her sisters in despair and says, \"They do not believe in us anymore.\" The shadow of belief sustains them for a time. Poets invoke the Muses because their predecessors did, out of literary convention. Small consolation, when the Oracle's cave at Delphi ends in bare earth and rock, and Olympos is only a mountain. Their power to shape the physical world dwindles and then disappears altogether. They realize, to their horror, that they are entirely dependent on mortals to preserve the steps of a dance, the words of an epic poem. The Muses are the daughters of Memory, and if memory fails, they too will fall. The library is burning. They can feel it, as each manuscript and roll of papyrus crumbles in ash. It is like having pieces of themselves torn away, whirled on the wind like the Sibyl's leaves of prophecy. Melpomene stands transfixed, while the tears slide down her face unheeded. \"A hundred and twenty plays he wrote me,\" she whispers, \"and I've lost all but seven.\" \"The ones who did this,\" Klio promises grimly, \"their names will be forgotten forever.\" For centuries they wander. Sometimes they find a home, one alone or a few of them together, but it never lasts for long. All they can do is offer their gift, the breath of inspiration, and hope it is accepted. When they cross paths with Apollo, though his hair shines as brightly as ever, his face is pale and the sound of his harp has grown bitter. Kalliope meets Dionysos one night in the vale of Tempe. \"Hail, lord, joy to mortals,\" she greets him respectfully. \"How is it with you, and with your followers?\" \"They serve Me still, though they do not know it,\" he answers with undisturbed calm. She sees the divine madness in his eyes, and shivers. Though much is taken, much abides, and if the works of humanity are fragile, at least they are endlessly inventive in creating new ones. Euterpe collects lyric poems written in languages that did not exist a mere thousand years ago, and they are sung to the accompaniment of new instruments. Terpsikhore boasts of the new forms of dance that appear in the villages of China and France, or the royal courts of Spain and Joseon. O for a Muse of fire, that would ascend the brightest heaven of invention. They bend their heads together over the lines, scratched with a quill pen. \"I wonder which of us he wants?\" Erato teases. \"I miss dancing in the heavens,\" Melpomene says wistfully. She stretches her slender arms toward the stars. \"Lost to us now--\" Klio gives a satisfied sigh. \"I knew there was going to be a battle.\" \"You can't kill off the fat knight,\" Thalia says, outraged. \"He was my favorite character. Plague you with boils and blisters and bunions -\" The author can't hear her, of course. They can no longer even pass through the ivory gate of dreams to appear to mortals in their sleep. But they breathe in the lines as they are written and re-written, and it is a little bit like the smoke of sacrifice. Still they wander, hovering hopefully in dance studios and observatories, beside ball-point pens and typewriters. They console one another over the losses and share the best of the gifts that mortals create. One day Ourania calls them all to a dry, wind-swept plain that vibrates like a great drum. The spacecraft leaps upward, cradling its occupant, and Ourania laughs and sings as she is carried to the heavens in fire.",

    "text": "There is a herd of cattle wandering the banks of the Styx. They pause, every now and then, to crop at the short stems of asphodel that trail up to the lip of the water. Their lowing is neither mournful nor bucolic. Mostly, it's just loud. Persephone stares at them. The lead cow is branded with a disk and five extending rays. Helios', then. She sighs. Her first day, first hour even, back in the Underworld, and already trouble. \"Hermes,\" she says, turning to her brother and escort and hiding her laughter behind another sigh. He looks entirely too innocent. \"Why is there a herd of cows chewing up my husband's garden?\" Hermes beams at her. The pale river-light flashes on a chain of silver at his throat. Persephone could swear she'd been wearing it herself, only a moment before. \"I'm sure I don't know,\" he says breezily. \"But he is the god of wealth, you know.\" He grins cheekily at her. \"Maybe he's decided to expand his holdings.\" \"Perhaps,\" says a cool dark voice from the empty air beside them. A helmet appears, lifted away from a pale, dark-eyed face, and then Hades is watching Hermes with laughter in his eyes. Hermes grins broadly. He's wearing a circlet of emeralds now. Persephone squints at it; it looks familiar, but she can't place it. \"I had been thinking of holding a feast,\" Hades says, his eyes meeting hers and softening, crinkling at the corners with his smile. Persephone can't help it; she laughs. Her world is pale, beautiful, and fresh around her, the little tendrils of grasses and the white stars of asphodel quick in her blood. There is a new planting of narcissus a little further up the bank, and a wild riot of chamomile, mint, sage, and thyme a few yards inland. Hades has been busy. She hopes the cows won't ruin everything. Hermes wears a smile both sly and innocent. \"It's a good thing, then,\" he says, smile only broadening, \"that Helios has been so kind as to offer his cattle for the occasion.\" \"Very generous of him indeed,\" Hades says, his eyes twinkling as he scans the bag Hermes wears over one shoulder; the leather is clearly branded with the seal of Apollo. \"I had no idea he cared.\" Persephone snorts. There's no point in arguing with either of them when they get like this. And anyway, she doesn't mind. \"We'll have to be sure to invite him, then,\" she says sweetly, then reaches over and bops her brother on the nose. He scowls, but can't hold it, and his smile returns as though it had never left. She eyes him slyly, and his grin only widens. \"But first, Hermes, o great god of flocks and herds,\" she declaims lavishly, \"I charge you to stop your damn cows from eating my garden.\" Hermes bows gallantly, mockingly, at the waist, his caduceus held forth like a banner. \"As you command, o iron queen!\" he declares grandly, and flies off across the fields, his laughter following after him. Hades turns and smiles at her, the secret smile that's only hers, and proffers his arm. \"Come,\" he says, on the edge of laughter, \"it seems we have a feast to prepare for.\" Persephone watches as one of the cows begins chomping at a pomegranate tree. Hermes is attempting to shoo it off, in between his laughter. She sighs fondly. \"I really do hate cows.\"",

    "text": "---------------------- Standing on the cliff, awaiting her fate, this was not what Psyche had expected. Not a gentle wind to carry her to a meadow, not a palace full of treasure, not invisible servants attending to her every need. And certainly not pleasure in her marital bed. Tucked into the impossibly comfortable bed that was now hers, her hand drifted down between her legs, more out of habit than arousal. She drowsily played with herself for a while, before fading off to sleep. Her hand was still there when she awoke to the touch of her new husband. His hand brushed the hair from her face, stroking her cheek. That same hand then traced her arm, until his hand rested on top of hers. \"Allow me, my darling\" he whispered in her ear, his hand beginning to stroke her while he kissed her lips. He seemed to know exactly how she liked to be touched: the speed, the pressure, the location, were all perfect. It was dark, and the lights throughout the palace had been extinguished, so she could not see him. But she moaned in pleasure as he worked his fingers between her legs and explored her body with his mouth. She kissed him back when he kissed her mouth. He suckled on her nipples, and she arched her back, pushing her breasts into his mouth. When he pushed her legs apart and began to lick and suck, she cried out, clutching at the sheets as the pleasure built and built until it exploded in an orgasm. She felt him slide inside her moments later, and rocked her hips up, moving with him as he consummated their marriage. He kissed her neck, her jaw, her lips, her eyelids, her ears, showering her with affection and murmuring endearments. She felt him shudder and grow still. Then he was gone. She spent the next day eagerly waiting for his return, this mysterious husband of hers, who was also a stranger. She wondered who he was, what he looked like, what he was like. And, with nothing else to do all day, she found herself aroused at the thought of his hands and his voice, anonymous in the dark, and counting the hours until sundown. He had his reasons. It's not that Cupid particularly thought that secrets were good for a marriage. But he knew how mortals responded to the sight of gods, and he wanted Psyche to love him for himself, not his godhood. So he set out to seduce her, to gain her trust. The son of Venus isn't exactly a stranger to desire, to pleasure, to the myriad ways that gods and humans have found to derive satisfaction from sexuality. And he knew that consummating his marriage to Psyche would be pleasurable, even if he had to hide his identity from her.What he didn't expect was that it would be so fucking hot.He hadn't expected to find her with her hand already between her legs. He hadn't expected her to be so responsive to a stranger's touch, so willing, so eager. And he hadn't expected that the fact that she couldn't see him, didn't know who he was, would excite him so much. When night finally comes, Psyche can't sleep. She's eager for her husband to come again. Torn between curiosity and the excitement that his mystery provides, she waits impatiently for the night to grow dark enough for him to arrive. When he does, she greets him with enthusiasm, doing what she can to return the pleasure he gives. Her tongue snakes into his mouth, her arms and legs wrap around his body. She kisses whatever body parts she can reach, but since she can't see him, and doesn't have enough experience with men to be able to navigate by touch and instinct alone, there is only so much she can do. But even so, it's all he can think about sometimes.---------It turns out, that it's all she can think about sometimes too. And when he comes home and discovers that she has left a blindfold and a text of stories of the gods disguising themselves on the bedside table, he realizes exactly what she means.",

She needed no true sight or prophecy then to comprehend the sounds. The last of her city's warriors, those not murdered without honor in their beds, were fighting and dying in the streets. Slowly, painfully, she crawled back to the goddess's statue, wrapping her arms once more around the cold stone and kissing those alabaster hands. Odysseus had aided her by decrying Ajax's actions and allowing her to flee back into the temple, but the gesture had bought her only a few moments before Ajax or another warrior returned. \"O Lady,\" she whispered through bruised, cracked lips. \"Pallas Athena, hear my prayer. I am your priestess, and I have been abused. Listen, O Goddess, to how the Greeks have insulted you. Shall your temples be defiled, your priestesses dishonored? Shall your suppliants be dragged from your sacred halls and abused in the streets? I beseech you for protection. I beseech you for vengeance against Ajax the Greek. I beseech you for aid, Athena.\" She rested her cheek against the statue's knee, too weary to stand. Her eyes ached from the smoke and her own futile tears. \"Hear my prayer, Ageleia.\" A warm hand stroked her hair then, gentle and tender as a sister's. \"You call me protectress of the people, and yet Troy burns,\" Athena observed dryly. Cassandra kept her cheek resting against Athena's knee. Her breath caught in her throat, hope so sweet and strong that she nearly choked upon it. Troy was doomed, but perhaps some of Troy's people might yet be spared. Andromache and Astyanax still lived; perhaps Athena could find some way to shield them from Troy's fate-- Visions came to her then, swift and merciless. She heard Andromache say, sorrowing, \"Falling down--down--all broken--and none to pity.\" She saw a much-older Andromache extend her hands to Helenus, and the look in his eyes as he clasped her hands and said with no trace of irony, \"All hail Queen Andromache.\" The images ceased, leaving only anguish. No escape for her little nephew then, and Andromache and Helenus were destined for other shores. \"Troy was doomed once my brother chose Aphrodite's gift, my lady,\" she said, voice hoarse, and then corrected herself. \"It was doomed the moment Eris set that apple among you. My lady, I know this was not your will.\" \"No,\" Athena agreed, and there was such rage in her voice that Cassandra shivered. \"It was not my will that I could not save your city or your people.\" Her hand stilled on Cassandra's hair. \"Or you, my little priestess. I could not save you from my brother's curse.\" Or Ajax's abuses, Cassandra didn't say, but the goddess seemed to hear her nonetheless, for in the next moment Athena said, \"I swear to you on the river Styx, little priestess. I shall deliver such misery upon Ajax that his suffering will be remembered for eternity.\" \"Thank you, my lady,\" Cassandra said. Another vision came and went quicker than a breath. Ajax's great suffering would have made her smile with bitter satisfaction, had she had anything in her heart but grief and despair. \"Come with me,\" the goddess said. \"Themyscira will be your sanctuary.\" ** ** Life on Themyscira for Cassandra was quiet and solitary. Hippolyta had greeted her with a respectful welcome, and given her a small house by the sea and the promise that she would not be disturbed. \"No man will ever abuse you so again,\" Hippolyta had sworn. \"You are safe here from man's cruelties.\" So Cassandra tended her garden, coaxing marrows and radishes from the earth, watching as her trees yielded figs and pomegranates. Birds, exhausted from their flights across the sea, often came to rest on the shore. She fed them seeds and bread, saw their future flights in her mind's eye. Each day she walked the beach and watched the waves surge towards the shore and retreat. Some days she praised Poseidon, who had aided Athena in her vengeance against Ajax. Other times she cursed him, for he'd aided the Greeks in the war, tricked them into bringing the horse and its deadly cargo inside Troy's gates. Time flowed oddly on Themyscira. Before Cassandra quite realized it, months, then years, then decades had passed. After a century or so, perhaps more, perhaps less, Cassandra became aware that one Amazon was disobeying Hippolyta's orders and intruding upon Cassandra's privacy. The next day Cassandra pretended to sleep beneath the pomegranate tree that overlooked the beach. In truth, though, she watched for her visitor. Soon enough the nearby bushes rustled and a girl peered through. It was Diana, Hippolyta's daughter. Cassandra saw the girl's eyes bright with curiosity, the intent look on her face. So the princess of the Amazons was curious about the last princess of Troy. Cassandra pretended to sleep, and soon enough the girl slipped away, back to her mother's side. That night Cassandra prayed to Athena as she always did. \"Thank you for your mercy, O Goddess,\" she whispered. \"Thank you for this sanctuary. I worship you with every breath and in every moment.\" When she dreamed, she dreamed of the future, fragments of experiences that left her waking with a moan, her body drenched in sweat and her heart racing with a mingled joy and sorrow. She had seen Diana grow into a young woman, no, a warrior, seen friendship shift to love, and that love to disbelief as Cassandra spoke a prophecy. She pressed a trembling hand to her lips, where she could taste still their first and final kisses. Cassandra wept for the first time since Troy had fallen. \"Athena, Athena,\" she called. \"Have I earned such unkindness? Must Apollo's curse steal even the sweet uncertainty of love from me?\" Athena did not answer her. Alone in her house, Cassandra bowed her head and tried to forget. The visions were seared upon her mind though, like a brand. For weeks she watched Diana stand alone on the beach, in plain sight but not approaching, her pale eyes fixed earnestly upon Cassandra's house. At last Cassandra broke as she knew she would. What use was fighting fate? Hector had gone to his death with honor; she could bear this promised grief with equal dignity. Diana sat upon the beach, her head resting upon her knees, half-dozing. When Cassandra approached, Diana lifted her face towards her like a flower searching out the sun. Her young face went slack with brief wonder. Then her pale cheeks flushed and she bit her lip, expression suddenly shy and uncertain. The look didn't suit the confident woman Cassandra remembered in her visions. \"Come,\" Cassandra whispered, holding out her hand. The moment stretched before her, impossible to fight. Diana's hand would be warm from the sun, she knew, and callused from handling weapons. \"It is the day.\" \"The day?\" Diana echoed, puzzlement and awe in her gaze. \"The day of what?\" Cassandra tried to smile, and was not entirely certain that she succeeded. \"The day upon which we are to meet,\" she said, and gave herself over to love and loss.",

Actaeon she met in the darkened wood,he prooved his worth to her. A shot he was,so skilled and fine, and pious suppliant.Dianna, goddess fair, invited him along,so as to share the hunt and game a while.Thus side by side they roamed the mounts and streams,and Artemis enjoyed the time spent withher friend. \"Fair huntress,\" said he, \"will not youever a husband take, to wed and love?For much like man and bird and bee, so godsmust wish for love?\" The virgin laughed, so pureand free, and left him there to walk alone. A spring she found so clear and fresh to batheaway the dirt. The deer stood by while birdsand nymphs all sang to praise her shining form.The theban hunter came upon her thereand quailed to see such sights. His heart felt burstand passion struck him dumb with all its might.Not long he waited, hidden so, but cameto speak to her. Dianna, Leto's girl,felt Fury scorch her heart. \"Go!\" she bade, buthe could not leave for Eros held him fast.Of love he spoke and promised her to giveboth house and veil and ne'ver stray away.\"Actaeon,\" said she, \"I do not think thatthe fire which burns your heart and soul has muchto do with mine. I burn for hunting deerand chasing hares all through the wintry hills.These feet so strong and coarse are made to walkthe wood, my eyes to spot the hawk above.I wish not for a veil or house nor loveof wilder kind. To freely roam and never stopis all I want from life. Speak not of lovefor Cupid's arrow never shall wound me!\" The hunter grieved but spoke again to winthe maid so fair. His words were wrought to charmmany a blushing girl to fall for him,and many a young girl had. But the queenof trees and dogs and piety would nothim lend her ear. A curse she cast uponhim then, for terrible she was indeed.\"The god of love has struck you with his craze,a dog you liken when it has a scent;it howls and barks and strains to chase it far.I do not have much sympathy for sucha dogged man. My curse will teach you notto strain the leash so hard. Be patient, man,and do not speak a word of what you've seen.Or else you'll turn into a deer, and thenyou'll never have a taste of love again.\" So Eros rules the heart of man and bringshim to his knees. Another view the giltDianna has of what is fair and whatis worth the chase. She stands aloneso strong and fast and knows not of regret.",

    "text": "When an angel slips through the synagogue's window on Sabbath evening, followed immediately by the god Mercury, Aster does not scream. She stares, she forgets to breathe, forgets about the service, but does not scream. Mercury stops and perches on the window sill, coming no further. The angel, however, enters fully and stretches its wings, huge and golden, across the span of the room. Aster's parents take no notice. Her younger sister yawns as the prayer reading continues in the light of two slowly burning candles. Aster remains silent and petrified. \"She is clearly bound to come with me, Malakh,\" says Mercury, and Aster jumps, hand clutching at her mother's robes. Her mother tsks and smooths her hair, a slight line of annoyance engraved between her eyebrows. No one else reacts. Aster chokes down fear. This is something mortals should not see. \"Aster!\" her mother hisses. \"You're too old for this fidgeting.\" Aster stills, not because of her mother's scolding, but because the angel is speaking. \"Her faith will deliver her to me. It is stronger than you think,\" Malakh says. \"Besides, she's in her own synagogue, what do you think her first impulse will be?\" \"To follow someone she recognizes, someone whose face she has seen hundreds of times in stone and paint - someone familiar. Not the messenger of a severe and invisible god.\" Mercury sounds smug, playful, in contrast to the angel's even and expressionless voice. \"She will know her true God when she sees me,\" Malakh says. \"This is not your temple.\" Mercury dangles a leg carelessly inside the window. Aster can see the gleam of white feathers on his sandals. Between his fingers he twirls a thin staff and it hits her that he is here in his capacity as psychopomp - conductor of souls to the underworld. Someone is going to die. In quick succession, Aster fears for her mother, then for herself, then for her sister, before remembering that \"she,\" of course, could mean any woman in the synagogue. She peers around in suppressed panic, half-expecting someone to fall bleeding and shrieking to the floor. But the service continues peacefully enough. No, she thinks, it can't be real, it can't be. It's a vision, she's fallen asleep, she's hallucinating - she grasps at any explanation except reality. She knows everyone here in this room. They are her family and her family's friends, a tight-knit community of permanent outsiders in a varied, ever-changing world. None of them - \"None of them will die,\" she hisses under her breath. As soon as she speaks the words, two inhuman gazes snap towards her. Mercury sits bolt upright. Malakh's wings stiffen. \"Malakh,\" Mercury says, \"that little girl can hear us.\" \"And see us, no doubt,\" Malakh replies, still calm and meditative. \"Perhaps she is of a line of prophets.\" \"It's unwise to spy on gods.\" \"Yes.\" Malakh takes a step forward and his wings pass through the columns and people and candles as if they were air. Aster's thread of courage breaks. She whirls and dashes through the congregation. Her mother hisses her name, but she takes no heed, slipping away through the crowd. Outside, the air is cool and quiet. She has not escaped. Her breath rings in her ears and her eyes fill with light as they come: descending from above, the wind from their wings smelling of fire and lightning. It freezes her to the spot. \"Do not fear,\" Malakh says, neither threatening nor kind. \"Prophet child, you must know that an angel of God will do you no evil.\" \"So he says.\" Mercury alights on the ground and circles her with delicate steps. \"Your master is a harsh one, Malakh. Perhaps he'll smite the child for idolatry. She must believe in me to see me, yes?\" \"But she does not worship you. And why should He smite her whom He has gifted with sight?\" Malakh counters. \"Perhaps he's not the giver.\" The two of them look at Aster and she finds she can breathe now, though fear still pulses in her throat. \"Well, little one? Do you think this vision is a gift from your god?\" Mercury says, half-mocking. If an angel and a god don't know the answer, then surely she cannot, either. But in the cold center of her fear, an idea sprouts. She speaks up with more confidence than she feels. \"It's clear what has happened. I was permitted to see you so I could perform a Judgment. Like Paris,\" she says. \"To choose who receives the - the prize.\" Malakh and Mercury appear mildly skeptical, but interested. \"You believe you are qualified to judge between us?\" Malakh says. \"Well, Paris was chosen because he was innocent in the ways of the world, wasn't he? And unbiased?\" \"So you think yourself innocent and unbiased?\" Mercury this time. \"The scriptures say children are.\" \"That is true,\" Malakh says, even as Mercury protests, \"They are wrong.\" They glance at each other and both fall silent. \"Why else would you appear before me just when this dispute arose?\" Aster hurries on. Mercury shrugs as if the whole matter is beneath him. \"It is all one to me,\" he says. \"Since she knows our old stories so well, she will likely decide in my favor, anyway.\" \"She is Jewish!\" Malakh protests. Aster listens to them argue with astonishment. There is a distinct lack of divinity to the squabbling. In the end, they harangue each other into agreeing, perhaps as much to their own surprise as hers. \"I will defer to your judgment,\" Malakh says finally. \"I swear it upon our God.\" \"And I swear it upon - myself,\" Mercury smirks. Aster draws herself up as tall as she can. \"My judgment is this: you must ask the dying person what she wants, and then abide by her decision.\" Mercury needles her a bit about her judgment being to ask someone else's judgment; but not long after, the congregation begins to file out (Aster spies her mother's thunderous face, no longer as intimidating as it seemed in the past) and both Mercury and Malakh grow very still. It is old Sarah who falls stricken to the dust. Aster covers her face with both hands, feeling tears begin to come. There are shouts and calls for help. Someone runs toward Ostia for a doctor. She hears Malakh speak. \"Both of us have a claim to be your soul's guide after death. You must decide what you want. We have both agreed to comply with your own desire.\" Aster is close enough to hear the old woman sputter, \"But - I don't want to die,\" close enough to see identical expressions of pure annoyance on two unearthly faces, close enough to witness Sarah's miraculous recovery from what a moment ago had seemed to be a fatal fit. And too close to escape her mother boxing her ear as she laughs and laughs, the loudest sound in the sudden silence brought about by an absence of divine messengers.",

Hestia eyes them. \"Brother...\" But she doesn't finish the thought, waiting to see what he does. Hades clears his throat. \"I call this meeting of the Idiot Council to order,\" he says in a rough imitation of Zeus' gravelly voice, standing above the ZEUS figure. \"What idiot business have we to discuss today? \"Well, Brother Zeus,\" he says, softening his voice to sound more like Poseidon's as he steps to the corresponding figure. \"Your daughter trounced me in a contest for a city using an olive tree.\" Back to Zeus. \"Trounced you with an olive tree? Now just how did she do that? \"The contest was to see who could give them a better gift. She gave them an olive tree. I thought I had it locked, because who even likes olives? I mean, I could take a dump right there and win the contest, right? And as we all know, I am just classy enough to do that. \"I like olives. \"I know you do, Brother Zeus. But I thought, surely the people of this city can't have as poor taste as my brother. And my gift was excellent. I smote the ground and a spring of water gushed forth! I don't even have enough fingers to count how many times better than an olive tree that is. \"But you said she trounced you. \"Yes, well. They complained because the spring was saltwater, see. \"You gave them a saltwater spring? \"Of course! I'm the god of the sea! \"That is idiotic. Excellent, Brother Poseidon. You've outdone yourself.\" \"Well, he is the god of the sea,\" Hestia protests. But Hades goes on, still speaking as Zeus. \"I've a tale of my own to relate. I'll... we'll say had a minor indiscretion with a mortal. \"Which time are we talking about here?\" He switches back to Poseidon. \"Yes, yes, we all know I cannot keep it in my pants and I doubt I could keep track of them all even if my brain were a normal size, but here I'm talking about Semele. The mother of my boy Dionysus, remember? Yes, her. Well, you see, my lovely wife Hera, you all know Hera here of course, she made Semele doubt my true identity. Still not entirely sure how she did it, because who else is much of a pompous blowhard as I? With respect to you, Brother Poseidon, of course. \"Of course. \"So Semele asked me for a favor. Without waiting to hear what it was, I swore on the River Styx that I would grant it. Well, the favor turned out to be seeing me in my true godly form.

After all, we could never aspire to be as intelligent, as kind, or as generally wonderful as her.\" Hestia blushes, looking down at the ground. \"They're all wonderful, in their own ways...\" \"Their own idiot ways,\" Hades says in his own voice. \"Anybody who would ever try to make you feel bad is an idiot, plain and simple, and not worth you defending them.\" \"But...\" Even as Hestia tries to protest, she can't help but feel a spark of warmth in her stomach He's working so hard to cheer her up, and she knows he means what he says, which is the most important part of all. She wishes they all got along, but for now, she's glad to have him as an ally. Instead of pressing the point, she hugs him. \"Thank you, brother.\" He hugs her back. \"It's nothing.\" But it is something, and she knows it. \"Hey,\" she says suddenly, remembering. \"Would you like to try this drink from the east? It's called tea...\"",

    "text": "She outgrew love like other things: home and flowers blown, fruit fallen from the vine. Winter came and laid its blanket down. Six seeds within her pulled her underground, with stones. Fingernails still grow after death, and her skin grew white within those walls. Tresses, lips and lashes grew black with fungus. Like decay, she grew into a queen, all her flowers gone. Underneath, grain and home curled in sleep. They did not disturb her now, like other things. She never grew to love him. Spring came, like other things: fruit and flowers, cereal and chaff. That summer was the first time she heard Orpheus sing. His hair was as bright as a chariot; his mouth was red like fruit. His song sang of earlier days, before the fruit, before the fall. Persephone looked away. On her knees, she had eaten the seeds, and now she knew. Above the ground was the tomb of childish things. There was no going there again, her belly ripe with rot. She was looking forward to the fall. That winter, another girl got gone, her eyes gaping and gilded. Persephone professed disinterest (Eurydice was not the first to run away from home), until Orpheus followed to disinter her. From the first meeting, her husband hated him. Orpheus's hair and harp sang of spring and other things, when Persephone was bright and prospered still, a blossom. In his efforts to exhume his wife, Orpheus excavated her husband even farther down, dug him right down to the root when there had never been a flower. There there was the seed of a man--resentful, jealous and alone, sick for homes he never had. Orpheus's eyes were the color of Hades's brothers' houses. \"He cast me out,\" said Hades. \"Is this my kingdom? Is this my home?\" \"That's all behind us,\" Persephone told her husband. \"Now we are grown up.\" Hades never could deny her but one thing. He let Orpheus go up with but one command, the thing that his wife had told him about going forward. Orpheus disobeyed, and the punishment was that he should grow up and forget her there, the green girl in a cave. She wore the price in her eyes that he paid with his heart. Underground, Persephone reached from her throne to cup the young girl's cheek. Her hand was thin and pale like bone, her nails sharp as briars. The girl's cheek was petal-soft, warm with life and surface-thoughts. Her mouth--trembling, longing, lost--was as ripe as Orpheus's, full before the rot. The flesh of fruit used to taste like home.

    "text": "\"I came here to win Helen's hand,\" he said, looking around discontentedly. \"But it looks like I'll have a lot of competition.\" \"Does that bother you?\" asked the young lady next to him. Her eyes were frank and curious as she looked into his, no hint of the dissembler before him. Not tactful, perhaps, but no gift for lying, either. Odysseus wished they'd put him next to one of the others. Iphthime, perhaps, who was more beautiful; or Clytemnestra, who was more entertaining. \"It doesn't bother me in the least,\" he said, except of course it did. If he beat Agamemnon to the punch, which he could, then that would make for a decidedly uncomfortable meeting next time. If he lost (deliberately, natch), then that would be decidedly embarrassing. Bit of a no-win situation. \"It should,\" said the lady, occupying herself with peeling a grape. Odysseus shook his head, more in irritation than anything else. \"If you win, you'll have to deal with all the others. Probably in battle, too, and though Ithaca's no shrinking violet, I doubt you can stand up to the forces of Mycenae plus everyone else here.\" It was on the tip of his tongue to protest that of course he could; he was Odysseus and if nothing else, he could probably talk Agamemnon out of it. But for a moment he was so surprised that he could only reply smoothly to her farewell, without thinking of a way to get her alone and quiz her on her knowledge of his military strength. He watched her go, and when he turned back to the other guests Iphthime seemed a little less pretty and Clytemnestra a little more dull. \"I think you're right,\" he said to her eventually. \"Marrying your cousin would be more trouble than it was worth.\" \"I knew you were clever,\" she said. \"I think we are all too much of a hassle, personally. If I were a man, I'd wash my hands of the lot of us.\" \"All of you?\" \"Well, Clytemnestra will always be the one who isn't Zeus's daughter, after all. She's never had much patience with Helen as it is; can you imagine another thirty years of being compared to her? No man would stand for it; no woman will, either. And Timandra's barely been married a year and it seems she already has a boy-toy. The rumours aren't repeated in Tyndareus's house, of course, but that doesn't stop them spreading. And as for me...\" \"What spoils your chances?\" he asked. She was no Helen (but Odysseus had realised fairly swiftly that it would be no picnic to be married to Helen), but she was lovely. It might be counted against her that she was quick-witted and quicker-tongued, for no man wanted a wife who was smarter than he was, but - she wasn't even looking at him. \"My father,\" she said, her voice weary. \"He says no man shall marry me unless that man can race him and win.\" Odysseus considered this. \"Isn't your father Icarius? The champion runner?\" \"Yes.\" She sighed, looking so dejected that Odysseus had to restrain himself from trying to tickle her. \"No one has ever beaten him.\" \"No one?\" \"He is the fastest man in the world,\" she said, some pride creeping into her voice. \"He says only the man fleeter of foot than he is worthy of his daughter.\" The comment rankled and Odysseus got up and left after a few more minutes. No one appreciated Ithaca, that was the trouble. He'd show her worthy. In all the contests for Helen's hand he would show her his mettle, his skill and his honestly - or dishonestly - magnificent brain. The son of Laertes was worthy of any woman. With this in mind, just to make sure, Odysseus went to Athena's temple to pour a few libations. You know. Just in case. Icarius had proved surprisingly spry for an old man. \"Old? Why, he's forty,\" she said. \"You won't be as strong when you're forty.\" \"I will.\" \"I'll bet you that you won't be able to string that bow of yours when you're his age.\" \"I'll take that bet. I'll fire it, even.\" \"We'll see. Hadn't you better be warming up?\" While Odysseus stretched, he eyed Icarius with the trepidation that was appropriate when approaching prospective fathers-in-law and no one else. Her father seemed to approve of him in a general sense, because kings didn't come along every day proposing to your daughters, but specifically: \"You're an uppity boy.\" It would be unutterably idiotic to offend him, Odysseus told himself. You want to marry his daughter, even if you're not sure why. If you offend him he might well go to great lengths to trip you up and that will be more humiliating than (deliberately) losing to Agamemnon. \"Insult me again and I'll elope with her,\" he said. She was only a few feet away, she could hear him and he knew she was rolling her eyes. It didn't make the bulging of Icarius's eyes any less satisfying. She came closer, looking infuriatingly serene in her sky-blue peplos. \"Do you think you could have handled that better?\" \"Only Athena could,\" Odysseus said piously, raising his eyes to heaven and hoping against hope that she was listening. \"And the other gods.\" \"And them. Yes.\" \"By the way,\" she said carelessly, \"this isn't like Helen's...whatever Helen called it. Stud market. If you win this race, you don't get to back out of the betrothal. If you're not sure you want to marry me, I'd start running in the opposite direction right now.\" Odysseus stared at her. One couldn't challenge one's potential bride to a contest of skill in retaliation for being called a coward. You couldn't. Really. \"I am sure,\" he said, biting each word out like they tasted sour. \"Good to know,\" she said, and walked away. Of course, Odysseus won. That's how these stories go, because Odysseus is a hero generally (if not in this particular story). Of course he won, in all possible ways. \"It's not fair,\" he told her on their wedding night. \"You know all my secrets now: the size of my military force, that Ithaca's actually much richer than I say it is - the size of my civilian force, if we're going to get into personal matters - \" she laughed - \"but I know next to nothing about you. Tell me your secrets, Penelope.\" \"My secret?\" Her head was resting against his shoulder, she sounded half-asleep. Odysseus tickled her and found she was perfectly awake. After a period that was nothing but pleasure, he asked again. \"I wanted to marry you,\" she said. \"Right from the very beginning.\" \"And I thought you were no good at lying,\" Odysseus said, smiling at her in the darkness. \"Am I lying now, or was I lying then? You decide, my dearest. One of them must be true.\" It occurred to Odysseus, as Penelope fell asleep for real this time, that he had married a woman who was cleverer than himself. It disturbed him less than he had supposed it would. Who else, after all, would be worthy of Odysseus?",

Artemis' retinue was essentially a traveling banquet of downy arms and thick thighs, while Athena occasionally took the shape of willow-pricked scholars or poets to indulge in the same. Even that hag Hecate whetted herself on willing ghosts, with her dogs and owls watching. The only mystery, then, was Hestia, whose faded gaze and tremulous lips made her no mystery at all, until the day Ares caught her abandoning the hearth. She had fled from her wooden perch (he refused to call it a throne) while all the gods were at rest, dizzy and ambrosial after another of Zeus' triumphs. Tailing her across the sky, Ares smirked as he recognized the Colline Gate of Rome; now there was a people of goodly followers, martial and obedient -- those swimming beards on Olympus could keep their fussy Greeks, who for all that logic and thought, had never thought of gladiators. Hestia did not bother to disguise herself. Ares sympathized: he hated the texture of human flesh from the inside, the sweating and leaking and smells. Only the blood was beautiful. With a bundle at her hip, the goddess placed her hand to the paved ground, and sank through. The Campus Sceleratus, Ares realized. Of course. A Vestal, probably innocent, sentenced to die. Hestia cradling one of her own until the end. He didn't follow her into the underground chamber. Even he had his limits. For twenty days, he paced around the sullen columns along the field, under the heavy-lidded sky. When Hestia emerged during the first blush of a storm, her bundle was gone. \"You should have strangled her, or made her immortal,\" Ares said. \"Either one.\" \"It was not her way,\" Hestia said. The rain pasted her veil to her cheeks and wrenched the white from her dress. \"I trust your presence was of some succor?\" The query had a leer in his mind, but the words came out damp. Soft. \"She broke the lamp the first day,\" Hestia looked at the rain shattering on the flagstones by the gate. \"She was terrified of the wait, the loneliness. And I said, 'I am all things and nothing, first-born and last-born. You will wait a hand-span in time. I will wait forever.'\" He took her arm, just the inside of the elbow, to help her into the waiting chariot by the gate. For once, the gold-bridled horses were silent. \"Was the girl comforted?\" Hestia sat down beside him, elbow still bent, knees forced together: \"She lay down smiling and said no more.\" \"Good,\" Ares said, and his hand on Hestia's cheek was of no consequence because he was actually touching her veil, and his thumb on her shaking lips also because of the veil, and the wetness inside her mouth was only the rain.",

    "text": "Come to me, little Christian. Yes, this is heaven. Yes, this is hell. You did not think the Underworld was a fable now, did you? Cross yourself all you like, you will find no holy water here. You will find Acheron and Lethe and Styx and Cocytus. You may drink your fill if you do not drown. Beg all you like. It will do no good. I am not known for my mercy and neither is my husband. He stole me, did you know? I was a goddess at play under the watchful eye of Helios and then the black earth swallowed me as my intended swept me away. I do not care that you were faithful to your wife. Aphrodite would laugh at you for claiming such a thing as a virtue. I congratulate your wife for giving you no reason to stray. Or did you stray? Is that why you are so vehement? My husband tried to take a lover or two; nymphs with white skin and green eyes. He has a type, that husband of mine. Leuce was before my time but her poplar no longer stands. I had Acheron flood his banks and poison her roots. Minthe. She was so pretty and conniving. Fresh-faced and aromatic; I enjoyed grinding her beneath the heel of my boot. My husband was lucky not to feel the heel of my boot. My husband did not know what he was stealing when he brought me here. He stole a maiden (only slightly spoiled) and he fashioned a queen. I lied. Goddesses are not known for their honesty. Do not look so surprised. My father was the finest trickster ever born of a Titan, a charming trait he has passed on some of his sons and not a few of his daughters. You may see Hermes here. Do check your pockets on the way through. My half-brother has sticky fingers. I lied. I am sometimes merciful. Was I not merciful to Adonis, my beautiful boy? Aphrodite, foolish creature, believed I had no heart, that I might be immune to beauty and charm made flesh. I do have a heart, Christian, despite the faithlessness of the Goddess of Love. She sent Psyche to me, too. Psyche is beautiful, all wide-eyed and earnest. The image of Aphrodite, some say. I think Psyche is far more beautiful, being mostly mortal and untempered by power. I might have taken Psyche as a consort, along with Adonis, save that she was enraptured by Aphrodite's feckless godling son. I never can resist a chance to ruffle Aphrodite's feathers, you understand. You do not believe that I, too, can be a champion of true love? You do not believe that I love my husband? Oh, but I do. This is not one of Aphrodite's fleeting fancies. I love Hades, insofar as an iron queen can love. I love Adonis. I love my rivers and my dog and I even love Charon, decrepit and cantankerous though he is. I promise you, Christian: this sacred, iron heart can warm to the touch.",

    "text": "\"You [Thetis] only among the immortals beat aside shameful destruction from Kronos' son [Zeus] the dark-misted, that time when all the other Olympian gods sought to bind him, Hera and Pallas Athena...\" - Homer, Iliad 1. 397 ff (trans. Lattimore) I. Lachesis (the lot caster) Stop me if you've heard this story before. But you haven't, have you? It is not sung in polite gatherings, this story. It is whispered in mystery rites and comes to light only in the darkness of caves and forests, where it began. When Kronus ruled, they say, there were a million years of peace and prosperity, but Zeus' rule was not as prosperous. Where Kronus had swallowed his rivals whole, Zeus gave them power in exchange for support. His rule was maintained through intricacies - through averted alliances, unacknowledged strength, and placated anger. But even so, Zeus, like his father and his father's father before him was challenged... He was not challenged by any usurping son, nor by a mighty god, but rather by two goddesses - his own beloved wife and favored daughter. One might wonder why the queen of the gods and the favorite child of Zeus challenged him, dethroned him, had him withering, bound and demeaned. Listen...Hera never wanted to be queen -- not of Olympus, not of the world, and certainly not of Zeus. It was no honor, Hera knew, to be thus chosen. She wasn't chosen because she was the most beautiful of the goddesses like Aphrodite, nor because she was the wisest like Zeus' wife before her. No, Hera was picked because while she belonged to the greatest family among the immortals, she was the least of her sisters. She wasn't the strongest, wisest, or the fairest of Kronus' daughters, wasn't a threat to Zeus. So he may bed her for eternity without ever worrying about her son displacing him. No, he never lusted after her like he did for Demeter, Thetis, or Metis -- willing to risk, even for a moment, everything in his kingdom for her. Instead, he courted her, and she's quite certain that despite having shared Zeus with so many women, she's the only one he ever courted. He asked her to marry him three times (and thrice she refused him)-- the first time not even five days past since he swallowed Metis to eliminate the threat to his rule -- and Hera refused him. The second time, he did not ask. She was watching the birds on Mount Kokkux when a wounded cuckoo flew into her arms, and she held it close to her breast and whispered to it, willing it to heal. But when her will did not work on it, she sensed that she had been tricked. And her surprise was enough for Zeus to resume his form and overcome her protests, so she became another one of his conquests. Afterwards, he surprised her by offering her the throne of Olympus. Still, she did not want it. She left him behind on that mountain, and went to their mother and Rhea promised to keep her presence from Zeus as only she could. On the first day she was there, Rhea said, \"He will give you many honors.\" \"I do not wish them,\" Hera said, \"Not after how he dishonored me.\" On the second day, Rhea said, \"He will give you noble offspring.\" \"I do not wish them,\" Hera said. \"Not unless they grow up to usurp him.\" And this, Rhea understood. She herself had raised Zeus to challenge his father, to overthrow him. Still, on the third day, she said, \"He will grant you much power.\" \"I do not wish it,\" Hera said, and hesitated before adding, \"Not if I have to share it with him.\" Rhea smiled at this for she knew a way to Hera's heart now and knew that she craved power. When Zeus came to her next, he asked her one more time if she would be his queen. And Hera said, \"I would have you swear an oath first. That you will never again violate me, nor touch me in any way unless I consent to it.\" And Zeus swore by all the gods he could name, not really understanding the promise. \"Swear by the Styx,\" Hera said. And only now did the oath weigh on him and he considered it for a long time before agreeing. When he had sworn the oath, she refused him one more time. \"But you promised to be my queen, with our mother as witness.\" \"I will keep my word,\" Hera said. \"But not yet.\" And now she had him under her power. He could not violate her or force her, and she knew that his delicate balance of power depended on his marrying her. So Hera had power for now, and she had gotten it without giving in to him. She let him wait for a long time. Three hundred years he waited, and when Aphrodite finally made her way from the sea to Olympus, he was so mad with wanting Hera that he granted Aphrodite her wish of marrying Hephaestus. And in exchange, he asked her to fill Hera's heart with love for him. And so they were married, but Hera never forgave him for violating her, and Zeus could never forgot the centuries of humiliation she had put him through. --- II. Clotho (the weaver) The Goddess of Wisdom is wiser than she lets on. Her lovely grey eyes take in all of the world around her, but rarely react to things. She's aloof, stately, and always independent. She has no permanent companions, and she is a champion of heroes. She has no wish to keep consort with lesser beings. She punishes transgressors, guides and supports the heroes, and if ever there are disputes between the feminine and the masculine, she upholds the teachings of her father. She stands as a symbol of all the power men have and reminds them all that Zeus did not need a woman to give birth to Athena, and that she's a motherless child. She herself, however, remembers Metis all too well. Her mother kept her within herself for as long as was needed for Athena to understand the world she was going to go out into one day. Her mother forged her an armor and weapons suited for war, and as Metis worked on this, Athena knows that Zeus felt each strike of the hammer as a debilitating headache, and Metis kept striking that hammer long after the armor, the robes, the shield, and the sword had been finished. And while Athena never wanted to leave her, Metis prepared her for that day. And the Goddess of Wisdom learned well from her mother how to bide her time, how to be patient, but even so, Metis sent her daughter out fully armed and ready to take on the world if there was ever need of it. Athena is careful not to repeat her mother's mistakes. Metis was wise, wiser than even Athena herself, but she was passionate, and that was dangerous. Metis helped Zeus take over the world, and when Zeus wanted to marry her, she gladly gave in. And then in the heat of passion, she uttered the words that proved to be her downfall. She told Zeus that their son would rule the world. And Zeus could never live with that threat, and he courted Hera instead. So Athena knows that she cannot ever present a threat to Zeus or to Hera, whom he now favors so much. Athena is not allowed to hate Hera openly. To do so would be dangerous, to do so would indicate that she remembers the fate of Metis, that she remembers her mother at all. And Athena must never seem to have divided loyalties because she knows that she is Zeus' favorite (and that he will give her all the powers willingly) only as long as she is an extension of his own self. When Artemis asks Zeus for independence from men and for eternal chastity, Zeus begrudges her this, but he fears her power just enough that he gives in to her. She is not one to do things with strategy, nor has she the patience to wait for things. But Zeus sees the way Apollo looks at her, sees how she averts her gaze only when there are others present, and he wonders what the offspring of such powerful gods might be able to accomplish, and so he gives in to Artemis, after protest. Athena, however, does not have to negotiate for her independence. Zeus encourages it. For all that he pretends that she is all his, he remembers Metis and remembers that from her line is there to be a son that will overthrow him. Persephone's wish to remain unmarried is answered by Zeus asking Hades to take her as his bride, and when Demeter is able to bring all the gods, even Zeus himself, down to Earth to seek her forgiveness, Athena knows that Demeter could be a worthy ally. Demeter knows the value of patience, of waiting things out until the world itself changes to meet her ends. Hera, in contrast, is reckless, Athena thinks. She is quickly angered and quickly retaliates, and Athena has seen Zeus fight with her, seen the anger Hera can stir in him, and the passion, too. And this knowledge, this connection, Athena can use to her advantage. So she takes to watching Hera, and learns to admire her. Zeus is the one who turns Io into a cow to hide his infidelity from Hera, and Hera is the one who guards the cow and leads it away to safety, and this is not lost on Athena. And Athena begins to wonder if there's an art to Hera's recklessness, if Hera chooses to play the jealous wife as Athena chooses to be the dutiful daughter while she, too, waits patiently for things to change. So Athena takes a chance, and finds Hera alone in her garden with her golden apples, and she says, \"It is curious that all your work towards destroying Io just led to her being free in a land away from Zeus and reunited with her son. Such a shame.\" Hera's hands still, and Athena can feel that stillness spreading all over the garden that was a wedding gift to Hera. \"Have you come to mock me, Athena?\" Hera asks, \"To throw Zeus' infidelities in my face like your father does?\" Athena knows that Hera's anger is real, but so is her fear. \"I think we both know that you can destroy things - people - more efficiently than that.\" \"Io proved to be difficult,\" Hera says, and Athena feels her own armor going up, knows that Hera is testing her now. Athena says, \"She was a priestess of yours, no?\" \"She betrayed me all the same.\" \"But that did not matter. You know Zeus' ways. You know how little consent means to him.\" \"It does not matter. She deserved to be punished.\" Hera is determined to keep her thoughts from Athena, and Athena knows that she will need to reveal her own secrets before Hera will trust hers to Athena. So she says, \"As did Medusa, I suppose. But neither Io nor Medusa could be deemed unlucky.\" Hera scoffs at that and laughs, and says, \"You cursed the lovely Medusa with hair that will turn a man to stone.\" Athena considers her answer carefully and says, \"Some might say that I gave Medusa the means to ensure that no man would ever violate her again.\" She sees Hera stiffen and then relax, understanding. And Athena smiles. She appreciates cunning and strategy, and Hera, whose power depends all on how she manipulates and hurts Zeus in turn, is a better strategist than anyone else. They cannot yet talk about Metis or Zeus' infidelities or Athena's chastity, but they understand each other. --- Hera knows patience, too, Athena learns. She is the only one of the gods who spends significant periods of time in her own temples, listening to the worshippers praying to her. She values them and values her priestesses. She has patience for humanity that few gods do. So when Hera curses Echo to only be able to repeat the words of others, it is not out of impatience. So Athena asks her about Echo, and Hera says, \"Zeus thinks he has my leave to find pleasure elsewhere since I have gone away from him to give birth to my son. And Echo thought that she could keep his affairs from me. I do not think that she would have done me the same favor.\" And this confession is significant, so unexpected that it takes the Goddess of Wisdom several moments to understand its implications, and her gaze drops to Hera's swollen belly. \"What did you do, Hera?\" \"The Fates have prophesied that the end of Zeus' rule will come one day, and the rulers of the past have always been brought down this way.\" Hera says, and then confesses, \"I lay with Uranus, and Gaia gave me her blessings.\" This unsettles Athena, so much so that she reveals a secret even greater than Hera's and says, \"My mother never thought that she needed a son to rescue her,\" and bites her tongue and wonders if she has said too much. Now Hera knows about Athena's stake in this, knows that Athena remembers Metis. But then she sees the stricken look on Hera's face, and she realizes that Hera is not watching for her slips and is not planning to turn them against her one day, realizes that she still does this with Hera, never being quite able to trust anyone, but that's the art of war, and she knows war. It is only after she has analyzed all of this that it occurs to her where her words have fallen amiss. Hera does not like being compared to Zeus' lovers, not the ones who came before her, all of whom he desired (destroyed) more. And not the ones after her, whom Hera must never allow herself to see as anything but weak (for having given in to Zeus, even when they didn't. For not having the power she eventually acquired over him, and for not having to fight that war for an eternity.) She regards the queen of Olympus carefully, and realizes that in one way, Hera is better - no, wiser - than even her own mother: Hera never chose this. And the queen of the gods sees her marriage as a war, is more cautious in her approach to Zeus than Metis ever was and she knows how to wield beauty, fragility, and compliance as power, an art that not even Athena knows. So Athena learns to see these things as power, too, and Hera acknowledges that maybe, Zeus could be overcome with cunning and not with might. When Hera gives birth to Typhon, Zeus rages at this outrage and lashes out and exiles him, but Hera is pleased to have displeased him so. And Zeus reminds Hera that only he may give birth to a perfect child alone and without a mate. Hera's eyes meet Athena's as Zeus thunders on, and they both remember Metis and remember that she had more to do with Athena's perfections than Zeus ever could. --- This is how it happens, the start of the war to end all wars: It is Hera who remembers to forget to invite Eris to the wedding of her foster daughter (and her rival, if Zeus had his way), Thetis. \"What could you expect to gain out of this?\" Athena asks. Hera smiles, and says, \"You plan the conflict, Athena, but leave the distractions up to me.\" \"You cannot know what Eris will do to avenge this dishonor.\" \"No, but I can count on Eris to live up to her name.\" Athena smiles even though she still has her doubts, but she thinks she would enjoy watching someone else do the thinking. When the golden apple drops, it drops in the midst of several goddesses. \"For the Fairest,\" it says. Hestia smiles and steps back from it, too wise to let herself become a part of this. Artemis smirks as she turns away. She knows how this contest will be judged, and the goddess of the hunt would willingly lay with a man before she would let one judge her worth. But neither Hestia nor Artemis is more chaste or more sensible than Athena, who chooses to court this title. As does Hera, who already has all the honors and all the powers that such a title might bring. \"This is meant for me, of course, you'll agree,\" Athena says as she reaches for the apple, and she's not surprised to find her hand grasped by Hera's, keeping her from the prize. Their eyes meet over their joined hands, and Athena's are full of appreciation because she can see exactly where this will lead. And the smugness in Hera's eyes makes Athena bite her lip to keep from smiling. Finally, Hera says, \"But, Athena, you know all about war and weapons, and would you not say that the arrow is meant for the person it lands the closest to?\" \"Only if the archer is a poor marksman, my queen. If a well trained archer had shot it, it would not land close to its target, but on it.\" Seeing that the prize is coveted by Zeus' beloved wife and favored daughter raises its worth, but only one goddess is brave enough to take them on. As they gently claw at each other's hands, Aphrodite takes the apple and says, \"It does not matter whom it landed closest to nor who thinks it belongs to her. An impartial judgment would demand that a gift meant for the most beautiful go to the Goddess of Beauty.\" Hera's fingers tighten on Athena's hand in acknowledgement of their triumph before letting go, and Hera says, \"A judgment! Finally, something sensible has been spoken.\" And she looks at Athena with distaste as if Athena should have been the one to come up with the suggestion. \"An impartial judge then,\" Athena says and turns to Zeus as all eyes turn away from the lovely apple and the lovelier goddesses and focus on the king of Olympus. Zeus' eyes glance at the apple and linger on Aphrodite as she holds the apple close to her shapely form, near her heart. And as he continues to gaze at the lovely sea-born goddess, he refuses to judge the contest. For surely, no one can think him an impartial judge. He would favor his own beloved daughter or his queenly wife, and not the goddess he cannot keep his eyes from. Aphrodite holds his gaze and agrees, \"It would be most unfair to me, if Zeus were to judge, as wise and knowledgeable as he is.\" Both Hera and Athena nod solemnly, as if they fully sympathize with Aphrodite's plight. And so the role of an impartial judge is passed on to a human, and Hera and Athena are both relieved because they can always count on human stupidity to do the rest of their work for them. They let Aphrodite go first, who is the first to offer Paris a bribe: the most beautiful woman on earth, an image of Aphrodite herself. And so glazed are Paris' eyes with Helen's beauty, so saturated is his brain with her essence, and so filled are his ears with Aphrodite's promise of Helen's love that Paris does not even realize the value of the gifts being offered by Hera and Athena. Paris picks Aphrodite, picks Helen, and Athena and Hera have the prize they were after. --- So while the gods all take part in the Trojan War, Athena and Hera prepare themselves for another war, one where the stakes are even higher. But it is not a war waged on battlefields with blood and weapons. No, Hera and Athena fight more subtly, and they plan more cautiously. No one thinks anything of it when Hera and Athena start being seen together, consorting together in some private room because everyone knows that they are united in a common goal in having a common enemy in Paris, in Troy. And they no longer have to hide or punish those who happen to find out their secrets. --- They get the idea from Hephaestus, who traps Aphrodite and Ares in an invisible net in order to expose their affair to the gods. And as the immortal gods gaze at the lovers, Hera's eyes meet Athena's, and they can never decide whose idea it originally was. Hera goes to her garden after the spectacle is over, and Athena knows where to find her. Hera says, \"We cannot kill Zeus, but trapping him inside a net would give us power over him, to do with him as we like.\" \"Just so,\" Athena says. \"But how would we gain power over Hephaestus and convince him to betray his father?\" Hera smiles, and says, \"You already have power over him, Athena. Use it.\" Athena considers this and considers how this is Hera's way and Aphrodite's, but she considers this beneath herself. Hera says, \"It is just another tool, another strategy.\" \"Would he not betray me, afterwards, when he does not get what he wants?\" \"You get the secret from him, and I'll handle the rest. He'll never be more loyal to Zeus than he is to me.\" --- When Athena has the net, she brings it to Hera, and Hera hides it under her marriage bed. She considers borrowing Aphrodite's girdle - and her charms - from her, but dismisses the notion. Aphrodite has different concerns than Hera and Athena do, but she is clever and it would not be long before she figures out how she has played into their hands, how she continues to do so. Zeus, however, is too assured of his own powers, too confident in the fact that all the gods love him - or at the very least, fear him - to suspect anything. He comes to Hera's bed, not suspecting any treachery. It is not that he trusts her, Hera knows, but rather that he trusts in his greater might, despite the oath he took. So she lets herself wither beneath him one last time, and when he wakes up, she stands above him and smiles benevolently. He smiles back before trying to reach for her and too late, he realizes that he is trapped. And he roars in anger, struggles against his invisible chains, curses Hera and blesses Metis, who never would have tricked him so. Athena comes rushing to the room, followed by all the gods. Athena braces herself for battle and wonders which gods would fight on her side, besides Hera. But not a single god steps forward to rescue Zeus, and none questions this state of affair, and Hera naturally takes charge, and orders them out. \"Have you no shame? This is a matter between a wife and her husband.\" But Athena watches as the gods listen to Hera, not caring if they can defeat her or not. For now, they will not challenge her rule. --- Betrayal comes from the least expected place for Athena, but it is not because she trusts Thetis as Hera does, but rather because she does not - or did not - consider Thetis a threat. But when Thetis, who refused Zeus's bed for she loved Hera too much, frees Zeus, the king of Olympus finds his wife on her throne, and remembering his promise to never lay hands on her without consent, he traps her on her gold throne and gives her leave to rule from there for eternity. And then he comes to Athena for her counsel and asks her what he should do with his wife for she has power over him and he cannot let her keep secrets of her own. And Athena has a choice: she can give up Hera, let her be swallowed whole by Zeus as Metis was, and keep the secrets she learned from her. She doubts it not that she can win this war by herself. Or she can give up Hera's secrets, give up Hephaestus' art and his trust, and render Hera powerless so Zeus will keep her and not be threatened by her. She makes a choice and gives Hephaestus up, and Zeus is content to throw his son out of the sky and into exile, for he finds Hephaestus a threat, but not Hera. Athena knows that Hera will not forgive her for this, but suddenly, it does not seem so important to win this war as much as to have someone to share that victory with. For Hera, the betrayal of Thetis is as nothing compared to Athena's. She did not enter into this lightly, had put more thought into this alliance with Athena than into her war with Zeus, and she was prepared to be imprisoned in Tartarus for it, just as long as Zeus was brought down. What Hera doesn't understand, however, is that they have only lost the first battle. The war rages on. --- III. Atropos (the inevitable) Athena will always remember the words her mother spoke before sending her out into the world, \"You must weave your own destiny, daughter.\" \"I will certainly weave one better for you than your husband.\" Metis will hold her to that, Athena knows. And she knows that Hera, too, will have to be freed from her prison. But it will take work to gain Hera's trust again. Hera will hold this against Athena for hundreds of years as only Hera can, but Athena will use that time to weave them a better story. Hera will eventually forgive her for the small betrayal, if it could be called that. And when that happens, they will set another plan in motion, and they will watch the pieces fall into place. The Fates will always prophesy the end of Zeus' rule, and Zeus will never not think that he will be overcome by might and power. But Zeus' throne will crumble under the weight of wisdom and cunning and not by force of destruction and weapons. For Ares will always be the passion of war - its violence and its recklessness. But Athena, who knows how to bide her time, knows how to plan, how to set things in motion, will wait patiently for all the pieces to fall into their inevitable place. And she will wait for Zeus, too, to fall. -end-",

      "--- Betrayal comes from the least expected place for Athena, but it is not because she trusts Thetis as Hera does, but rather because she does not - or did not - consider Thetis a threat.",
      "But when Thetis, who refused Zeus's bed for she loved Hera too much, frees Zeus, the king of Olympus finds his wife on her throne, and remembering his promise to never lay hands on her without consent, he traps her on her gold throne and gives her leave to rule from there for eternity.",
      "And then he comes to Athena for her counsel and asks her what he should do with his wife for she has power over him and he cannot let her keep secrets of her own.",
      "And Athena has a choice: she can give up Hera, let her be swallowed whole by Zeus as Metis was, and keep the secrets she learned from her.",
      "She doubts it not that she can win this war by herself.",
      "Or she can give up Hera's secrets, give up Hephaestus' art and his trust, and render Hera powerless so Zeus will keep her and not be threatened by her.",
      "She makes a choice and gives Hephaestus up, and Zeus is content to throw his son out of the sky and into exile, for he finds Hephaestus a threat, but not Hera.",
      "Athena knows that Hera will not forgive her for this, but suddenly, it does not seem so important to win this war as much as to have someone to share that victory with.",
      "For Hera, the betrayal of Thetis is as nothing compared to Athena's.",
      "She did not enter into this lightly, had put more thought into this alliance with Athena than into her war with Zeus, and she was prepared to be imprisoned in Tartarus for it, just as long as Zeus was brought down.",
      "What Hera doesn't understand, however, is that they have only lost the first battle.",
      "The war rages on.",
      "--- III.",
      "Atropos (the inevitable) Athena will always remember the words her mother spoke before sending her out into the world, \"You must weave your own destiny, daughter.\"",
      "\"I will certainly weave one better for you than your husband.\"",
      "Metis will hold her to that, Athena knows.",
      "And she knows that Hera, too, will have to be freed from her prison.",
      "But it will take work to gain Hera's trust again.",
      "Hera will hold this against Athena for hundreds of years as only Hera can, but Athena will use that time to weave them a better story.",
      "Hera will eventually forgive her for the small betrayal, if it could be called that.",
      "And when that happens, they will set another plan in motion, and they will watch the pieces fall into place.",
      "The Fates will always prophesy the end of Zeus' rule, and Zeus will never not think that he will be overcome by might and power.",
      "But Zeus' throne will crumble under the weight of wisdom and cunning and not by force of destruction and weapons.",
      "For Ares will always be the passion of war - its violence and its recklessness.",
      "But Athena, who knows how to bide her time, knows how to plan, how to set things in motion, will wait patiently for all the pieces to fall into their inevitable place.",
      "And she will wait for Zeus, too, to fall.",

    "text": "I. I would not mingle with their feasts; to me Their nectar smack'd of hemlock on the lips, Their rich ambrosia tasted aconite. Hades did not particularly enjoy Zeus's feasts. He attended them, of course, because to do otherwise would be considered a slight, but he looked forward to them as little as Artemis craved a man's touch. Even among the deathless gods, the king of the underworld was not considered a popular guest. The gods offered awkward small-talk about how, er, good Hades was at his job, and then hurriedly found an excuse to meet up with another god or goddess across the room. And the rare half-mortals visiting Olympus tended to blanch when they realized to whom they were speaking, sidling away and obviously wishing they'd given him an assumed name. Hades lifted his goblet of nectar to his lips, inhaling the warm, heady scent. While the ambrosia and nectar Hera created didn't quite make up for the unpleasantness, they certainly eased things a little. He took a careful sip. This time the nectar tasted of the finest spices and an unfamiliar wine; it brought to mind the distant east, where other gods dwelled. \"Do my eyes deceive me, or is the lord of the underworld smiling?\" Dionysus was already flushed, though whether that was from wine or mere merriment, Hades wasn't quite certain. The younger god clutched at his empty drinking cup and smirked. Hades ignored Dionysus's slightly mocking tone. \"You should try the nectar,\" he said mildly. Dionysus snorted. \"That swill? I'll stick to my own, thank you very much.\" He took a quick gulp of his wine, which had refilled at his words. \"Enjoying yourself?\" Hades didn't rise to Dionysus's bait. Let Dionysus stir madness in someone else's breast this banquet. Instead he let his long, level look speak for him. After a moment, Dionysus snorted. \"Once again you're dull as dirt, uncle. I think I shall go see if Ares or Comus is interested in a drinking contest.\" He brushed at his long hair, which had fallen into his eyes, and frowned. \"Where's my crown?\" Hades looked around, but the ivy crown was nowhere to be found. \"No doubt atop Hermes's head,\" he commented, quelling his amused smile before it could reach his lips. Each banquet he played a mental game of guessing what item Hermes would steal; last time the young god had stolen Poseidon's trident. Dionysus scowled. \"If Hermes has stolen my crown,\" he began, and then stopped as a child shrieked with mirth. It was an unfamiliar sound at one of Zeus's feasts, and Hades found himself looking around to find the source of the laughter. A small girl with midnight-dark hair dashed towards him, giggling as Hermes pursued her. Dionysus's crown was perched atop her head, but, being rather too large for her, it kept sliding down her forehead and obscuring her sight. Half-blind, she stumbled into Hades, crowing with laughter as the god automatically steadied her with his free hand. The other hand gripped his goblet tighter as cool nectar spilled upon his fingers. \"Sorry!\" she said, not sounding apologetic at all as she pushed the crown away from her eyes and smiled up at him. He recognized her at once, then, or at least those familiar features and those sky-blue eyes. This was Demeter's child. \"That is quite all right, child,\" he said, trying to remember her name. \"However, I believe that crown belongs to Dionysus.\" \"Oh, I know, but Hermes said--\" the child said, but Hermes caught up then. \"I said how Dionysus must have carelessly left his crown on one of the tables, and that we ought to return it at once,\" Hermes supplied hastily, looking far too innocent to be believed. The girl directed a frown at him that was puzzled and a little indignant. \"No, you said you'd stolen--\" she began, only to be interrupted once more. \"Persephone!\" Demeter seemed to tower over them all in her fury; from the corner of his eye, Hades saw Hermes hurriedly making an exit. The goddess was flushed with anger. \"You disgrace us both! Return that crown at once and come with me. I had thought you old enough to behave at one of Zeus's banquets, but I see that I was mistaken.\" Persephone's eyes widened. \"But I was only--\" She subsided at her mother's look, pulling the crown off and handing it meekly to Dionysus. \"I am sorry for the disturbance,\" she mumbled, the apology directed at the feet of Hades and Dionysus. \"And that I wore your crown without permission, cousin.\" \"I don't blame you,\" Dionysus assured her, and then glanced at Demeter. \"Don't be too harsh, Demeter. It was all Hermes's doing.\" Demeter shook her head and planted a firm hand between Persephone's shoulder blades, pushing the child away from the two gods and towards the nearest exit. \"Farewell,\" she called over her shoulder. \"Farewell,\" they echoed. Dionysus raised an eyebrow, looking a little amused as he inspected the crown for any damage. Satisfied that neither Hermes's theft nor Persephone's race through the banquet hall had harmed the crown, he put it on and adjusted it carefully. \"Quite an unusual child,\" he remarked. \"Indeed,\" Hades agreed. He took another sip of his nectar. This time, it tasted pleasantly of pomegranates. ** ** \"Uncle,\" Athena said with a polite smile. She greeted him with a raised goblet. Hades echoed the gesture, nodding back. \"Athena.\" \"Shall I catch you up on the latest adventures and rivalries?\" she asked with a wry look. It was moments like these that Hades suspected she detested Zeus's banquets as much as he did. \"I know you do not hear much of Olympus in your kingdom.\" \"If you wish,\" Hades said. Truth be told, he was not particularly interested, but at least Athena did not look at him with any sort of trepidation. It would be nice to have a conversation where the other person wasn't staring at you as though you'd sprouted three heads. \"Apollo is still sulking over Marpessa,\" Athena began. She arched a delicate eyebrow at Hades's puzzled expression. \"You didn't hear about Marpessa? She's a mortal princess, pursued by both Apollo and a mortal named Idas. Zeus had her choose between them, and she chose the mortal. Apparently she said that Apollo would tire of her once she grew old.\" \"Wise choice,\" said Hades. He caught sight of Dionysus across the hall, scowling into his goblet, and thought of Semele, who'd wept and cursed Hera as she'd stood before his throne. Dionysus had not yet asked after his mother, but Hades knew he would, eventually. \"Mortal-god entanglements rarely end well,\" he added, more quietly. \"It was indeed a sensible decision,\" Athena said. Hades looked up from his nectar in time to spot the fleeting, pleased smile that briefly warmed Athena's wintry gray eyes. Ah. Perhaps Athena had helped Marpessa along with her decision. It was either that, or she was simply proud of a mortal for making such a prudent choice. \"And then there is Persephone, causing her mother grief and scorning Aphrodite,\" Athena continued. \"She aims to become one of Artemis's maidens, she says, and woe to anyone, god or mortal, who tries to woo her!\" Athena sounded approving. \"The last time I saw Persephone, she was still a child,\" Hades said. He tried to recall her face, but all he could remember was that she'd looked like Demeter, with the same dark hair and pale eyes. He wondered if she now looked more or less like her mother. \"Time passes...\" He paused to consider his words. \"Time passes both slowly and swiftly in the underworld. I take it she has grown into womanhood?\" \"She has,\" Athena said a trifle dryly, \"though she has done her best to hide it. She wears the garb of Artemis and runs through the woods without care for her appearance. Or so Demeter complains.\" Hades could well imagine Demeter's reaction. \"And Artemis has accepted her as one of her maidens?\" Athena pursed her mouth. \"Well. She has told Persephone that she will, but she is taking her time in doing so. I suspect that she doesn't want to anger Demeter. And, of course, she doesn't want to incur Zeus's displeasure either.\" \"Zeus? Why would Zeus be angry?\" Hades asked. He'd expect Aphrodite to be furious--her revenge upon those who scorned love was legendary--but what had Zeus to do with Persephone? The look Athena directed at him was a little amused, but a little condescending as well, as though she sometimes thought Zeus alone of Cronus and Rhea's children had been given the gift of intelligence. \"Come now, uncle. A beautiful young maiden, scorning love? We all know my father takes that as a particular challenge.\" \"Ah,\" Hades said. \"Yes.\" He found himself flinching away from the thought. He knew of his brother's fondness for the chase, of Zeus's delight in finding the most unwilling women and softening their hearts towards him--or, if that failed, using his powers as king of the gods to break their will and take what he pleased. Hades thought of the merry child who'd raced around the banquet hall with Dionysus's crown atop her head, soon broken to halter at Zeus's whim, and felt a little ill. When he looked again at Athena, he couldn't read the expression in her pale eyes. \"For now Artemis and I keep her by our sides at all times,\" she said. It was only then that Hades realized Artemis was nowhere to be found in the banquet hall. \"Zeus hesitates to do anything while Persephone is one of our guests. Soon, however, he will lose his patience, and then--\" She shrugged. \"And then,\" Hades echoed bleakly. Eventually Zeus would disregard the law of hospitality and do as he pleased. No one would be able to stand against him. He was king, after all. \"There is nothing to be done?\" \"Well....\" Athena frowned and lowered her voice, so that Hades had to step closer to hear her next words. \"I have been thinking lately, that if we could somehow hide Persephone away for a time, out of Zeus's sight, he would turn to other pursuits.\" For a moment, Hades felt hope briefly warm his chest. Then common sense took hold once again. \"Zeus is lord of the sky, there are few places he cannot see,\" he pointed out. \"Yes, indeed very little is concealed from him,\" Athena agreed. She met his gaze squarely. \"I will come to the point, uncle. Your kingdom is one of those places.\" At first Hades wanted to laugh. He tried to imagine the daughter of Demeter in the dark halls of his palace, and failed. \"The underworld is no place for a goddess,\" he said. \"It would only be for a short while, a few months at the most,\" Athena said. A note of entreaty crept into her voice. \"Please, uncle. Zeus would never think to look in your palace.\" \"For good reason,\" Hades muttered. Still, Athena was right. Zeus would not consider the underworld. Nor would he dare to venture there in pursuit of Persephone, should he discover where she was hidden. Hades frowned. \"Persephone is willing to do this?\" \"Artemis and I wished to get your answer before we broached the subject with her,\" Athena said, rather evasively, he felt. \"In other words, she might refuse my hospitality,\" Hades said. \"No,\" Athena said firmly. \"Not after I have spoken to her. This is the best way for her to avoid Zeus. She will see that.\" While Hades did not doubt Athena's ability to persuade, he also didn't doubt the revulsion a young goddess would hold for his kingdom. What child of the goddess of spring and life would enjoy the dark and somber hush of the kingdom of the dead? \"However she answers you, let her know she is always welcome as a guest in my kingdom,\" he said, and was rewarded by Athena's smile. ** ** \"May I have leave to speak, my lord?\" Charon asked, leaning against his oar and frowning. They were halfway across the Acheron. On the receding bank, Hades could see countless shades wandering dejectedly along the shore, waiting their hundred years, as well as the occasional flicker of silver as a more-fortunate shade clutched at his or her obolus and waited for Charon. Hades raised an eyebrow. He had decided to tell each of his servants the news separately, just for this moment, when each one could speak his mind without fear. \"You know I prefer honesty to evasiveness,\" he answered. He waved his hand when Charon hesitated. \"Speak.\" \"Are you certain of this, my lord?\" Charon asked, not quite meeting his eyes. \"It is all very well and good to try and aid this Persephone, but what if Zeus does come here? You'll excuse me for saying so, but I wouldn't enjoy witnessing an argument between you and the king of the gods.\" \"It will be fine, Charon,\" Hades said, imbuing his words with as much confidence as he could muster. He would not admit--to himself or to his servant--that he was also nervous, waiting to hear from Athena whether or not Persephone had agreed to the plan. \"Zeus would not dare to come here. Even when he appointed Minos, Rhadamanthus, and Aeacus as judges, he did not enter my hall but stood beside the bank of the Styx.\" \"That is true,\" Charon agreed. He still looked dubious. Then he brightened a little. \"It would be a sight though, Persephone in your palace. A very different change than when Hermes, ah, graces the underworld with his presence.\" A sour note crept into his voice. Hades hid a smile. Charon did not have any fondness in his heart for the messenger of the gods. Hades suspected this was due in part to Hermes ignoring Charon and flying over the Acheron when he came bearing messages. Charon cleared his throat. \"What does she look like?\" \"I only saw her as a small child, but she had hair as black as night, and eyes as blue as the clearest sky. And a laugh like a bell,\" Hades said. He paused. \"She must be beautiful, though, or else Zeus would not be so captivated.\" \"You will introduce us?\" Charon asked eagerly. \"Not that I don't love my job, my lord, but Persephone's visit will be the most exciting thing to happen in centuries!\" \"And it does not hurt that she is alive and beautiful, unlike your other passengers,\" Hades said a little dryly. \"Indeed, my lord,\" Charon agreed, and rowed them towards the bank of the Acheron with renewed vigor. ** ** The field in Enna was filled with greenery and smelled overwhelmingly of flowers. Hades resisted the urge to sneeze as he landed his chariot. The winged horses snorted and stamped their hooves as they eyed the field. Hades already missed the flowers of the Asphodel Meadows, which bloomed without scent. He squinted, raising his hand to block the bright sunlight. Three women stood before him. \"Hades,\" Athena said as she came forward and clasped his free hand in greeting. She smiled warmly at him. \"Well met, uncle.\" \"I have spoken with my brother. Apollo will keep his silence,\" Artemis said. She did not offer a greeting, scowling instead. No doubt she was irritated that her protection had not been enough for Persephone. Hades did not take offense. \"That is excellent news,\" he said politely. \"I thank you and Apollo.\" Then, at last he turned to the final woman. \"And I greet you, Persephone.\" Persephone had indeed grown into womanhood. Her features were no longer anything like her mother's but wholly her own, with a pale, high forehead and a mouth that promised stubbornness and an inability to yield. Her hair fell in windswept curls around her face. There was a leaf caught in one of the tendrils, pale green against the dark. \"My lord,\" she said with cold disdain. Hades felt each syllable like a blow. \"Shall we go?\" \"I--\" Hades said, taken aback. His gaze flickered towards Athena, who looked rueful, and Artemis, who looked a little satisfied. Apparently Athena had managed to convince Persephone that this was necessary, not pleasant. At last he bowed. \"We shall go whenever you are ready.\" \"Then let us go,\" Persephone said. She turned and embraced first Athena and then, for a moment longer, Artemis. \"Fare you well, Athena. Thank you for your help. Fare you well, Artemis. I trust I shall be back among your maidens soon.\" Hades offered her his hand but she ignored it, climbing into the chariot on her own. He stared at her for a moment, at a loss. Would she be like this throughout her entire visit, distant and aloof? \"Fare you well, nieces,\" he said at last. Then, with a flick of the reins, he and Persephone were off, the chariot flying swiftly towards Arvenus. II. (Demeter to Persephone)...thou should'st dwell For nine white moons of each whole year with me, Three dark ones in the shadow with thy King. \"My lady Persephone,\" Charon said, nearly stepping into the Acheron during his enthusiastic bow. \"It is indeed an honor. Let me be the first to welcome you to the underworld.\" \"Thank you,\" Persephone said without any great enthusiasm. One of the shades drifted close to her, and she stepped quickly away, her eyes widening in dismay. \"This is Charon. He ferries the dead across the Acheron and the Styx,\" Hades said. He glared at the shade until it drifted away, momentarily regretting that he had sent the chariot and his horses back home. Hades had intended a proper showing of the underworld to Persephone, but perhaps it would have been better to simply take Persephone to her chambers and let her adjust in private. \"Greetings, Charon,\" Persephone said politely, and then backed away from still another shade. \"Why do these dead wander here? Should they not be in Elysium or Tartarus?\" \"They have not paid the toll, my lady,\" Charon explained. \"They died at sea, or were not buried with an obolus or danake in their mouths. They must wander the bank of the Acheron for a hundred years as payment instead.\" \"I see,\" Persephone murmured. She looked for a long moment at the milling dead, and at last shook her head. \"May we go?\" \"Of course, my lady, of course,\" Charon assured her. As she stepped past him onto the boat, Charon shot Hades a curious look. Hades simply shrugged in answer. How could he convey in a glance that Persephone was not pleased with her situation? He stepped onto the boat as well, keeping a polite distance from Persephone. \"This is the Acheron, river of sorrow,\" he began. \"Perhaps you have heard of the other four. There is Cocytus, river of lamentation; Phlegethon, river of fire; Lethe, river of....\" ** ** \"This is my home,\" Hades said. The boat ride had been quiet save for his attempts to tell her of his kingdom. Persephone had simply stared at the river, and even Charon, after a few failed attempts at humor, had fallen silent and simply rowed. He could not read Persephone's expression, for all emotion had leeched from her face at the sight of the palace. He tried to view it through her eyes, and found it severely wanting. What goddess filled to the brim with life and youth would enjoy the sight of this dark, gloomy place? Hades stepped into the forecourt, and was pleased to see all three judges at their posts, heads bent in conversation as an anxious-looking shade hovered before them. \"This is the court where the dead are judged.\" Hades raised his voice. \"Minos! Rhadamanthus! Aeacus!\" \"My lord,\" Minos and Aeacus said, Rhadamanthus a beat behind them. The three judges rose to their feet and bowed as one to Hades, then to Persephone. \"Welcome to the underworld, lady Persephone,\" said Aeacus, smiling. \"We hope you will be comfortable during your sojourn here.\" \"I thank you for your greetings,\" Persephone said. This time she almost smiled, Hades was certain of it. She glanced at the shade. \"He stands in judgment?\" \"Yes, my lady,\" Minos said. \"We are deciding where he shall go, to the Asphodel Meadows, to Tartarus, or to Elysium.\" \"How do you decide?\" Persephone asked, showing the first spark of interest Hades had seen. She stepped closer to the dead soul, studying him as the unfortunate shade looked miserable. \"By examining his actions,\" Rhadamanthus explained. \"If he has done nothing truly good or truly evil, he goes to the Fields of Asphodel. If he has committed evil, he will go to Tartarus. If he has led a good life, he will go to Elysium.\" \"I see,\" Persephone said. She turned to Hades. \"If they are the judges, what do you do?\" Her tone was curious rather than confrontational, and Hades felt something in him ease. Perhaps she might find this place bearable after all. \"If they cannot come to a decision, they come to me. I oversee the entire underworld and decide on the punishments of those in Tartarus. I make certain no shades escape to the surface, for many do try. I see that Cerberus is fed.\" Hades hesitated, and then added, a little sheepishly, \"I also tend the flowers.\" \"The flowers?\" This time Persephone definitely smiled, the gesture softening the severe lines of her face. \"The ones in the Asphodel Meadows? They are beautiful.\" Hades smiled back. He made a mental note to bring a vase of the flowers to Persephone's chambers. Would she enjoy them each night of her stay, he wondered, or would that be intrusive? \"Yes, they are,\" he agreed. He glanced at the judges. \"You have my apology for our interruption. Be wise and well.\" \"Be well, my lord,\" the judges chorused. \"Be well, Lady Persephone.\" \"Now, let me show you my great hall,\" Hades said to Persephone. \"I trust you will find it satisfactory.\" \"I hope so, my lord,\" Persephone murmured, but she was back to looking dubious as she matched his pace and walked at his shoulder into the next room. There she stopped abruptly. He turned to watch in astonishment as all the color drained from her face and fury darkened her eyes. \"What is that?\" she demanded in strident and accusing tones, pointing. \"What do you mean by this?\" Puzzled, Hades followed the direction of her finger. He had crafted this gift himself, carving it from purest marble and polishing it so that it shone even in the murky darkness of the hall. \"It is your throne,\" he said. \"A throne.\" Persephone spit out the words as though they were poison. \"What need have I of a throne in your hall, my lord?\" The title was mocking. Hades stared at her, bewildered at her reaction. \"I did not intend any offense,\" he said carefully, feeling as though he were walking treacherous ground. \"You are my guest, and a goddess. It would be discourteous to offer you anything but a throne.\" \"You gave me a throne as a gift to your guest,\" Persephone said. Now she sounded more puzzled than angry. \"Yes, of course. Did you expect to sit on the floor?\" Persephone stared at him for a moment. Then, to his further surprise, she dissolved into laughter. The clear, bell-like sound rang through the room, briefly muffled as she pressed her hands to her face and shook her head. \"Forgive me,\" she said, once she had stopped laughing. She looked at him then, with a warm, rueful smile that invited him in on the joke. Hades spread his hands, still puzzled, but relieved as well. \"What is there to forgive?\" \"My abominable conduct, for one,\" Persephone said wryly. \"I fear I labored under a misapprehension. Artemis led me to believe you had tricked Athena and would force me to marry you instead of Zeus.\" \"And you thought me clever enough to somehow fool Athena, goddess of wisdom,\" Hades said. He felt an incredulous smile tug at his mouth. \"You give me more credit than I am due, Persephone. Besides, I would not break the law of hospitality. You are free to stay, and free to leave whenever you wish.\" \"Thank you,\" she said. Her smile, as it curved her lips, was more beautiful than any Asphodel flower, and Hades felt his breath catch in his chest. After a moment, he smiled back. \"Welcome to my hall, Persephone.\" ** ** \"Does it not get dull here?\" Persephone asked. She sat on her throne, surveying the room with an interested gaze. She had taken off her sandals, and one of her feet tapped out a slow beat upon the floor. She rested her chin in her hand and eyed Hades. \"You tend the flowers, and feed Cerberus, and oversee the judges, I know, but the days must drag on nonetheless.\" \"They do,\" Hades admitted. \"But I am not alone. Charon is always willing to tell me stories of those he's ferried. And Minos is an excellent storyteller.\" \"My lord,\" Minos said, coming into the hall as though Hades had summoned him rather than simply mentioned him by name. \"We need your counsel. We have looked at this shade's life and cannot come to a decision as to her fate.\" Hades waved a hand. \"Send her in,\" he said, privately pleased. Now Persephone could see him perform one of his duties. \"Your name, shade?\" he said to the flickering, distressed spirit who hovered before the thrones. \"I was one known as Eumelia, my lord,\" the shade said, and then threw herself at Persephone's feet. \"My lady, my lady, I knew not your name or status to worship you while I lived, but pray send me to Elysium,\" she begged, oblivious to Persephone's startled expression. \"I have committed a cruelty, I freely admit as much, but nothing terrible enough to deserve Tartarus. Please, my lady.\" \"It is not me you should implore, but Hades,\" Persephone said, a pale flush creeping into her cheeks. The shade flinched at the name and darted a quick, terrified look at Hades. \"Speak to Clymenus?\" she whispered. \"Oh, my lady, I couldn't.\" Persephone glanced at Hades, and when he nodded, turned to Minos. \"What has she done in her life that you cannot choose?\" \"It is very much a quandary, my lady. She has committed both a great evil and a great good.\" \"I see,\" said Persephone, frowning. Then she turned back to Hades. \"My lord, it seems to me that if she has committed both great evil and great good, then she has balanced the scales. Should she not go to the Asphodel Meadows?\" At that, the shade let out a howl of despair. \"Not the Meadows, my lady! I could not bear the tedium!\" Persephone frowned upon the shade. \"You do not wish to be thrown into Tartarus, and now, when offered a better option of the Fields, you scorn the offer?\" she said, very low and deceptively mild. Only Hades was close enough to see the hard look in her eyes. \"Perhaps you should have thought of this moment before you committed a great evil, Eumelia.\" \"But my lady--\" the shade began to protest. Hades held up a hand, and the shade fell silent. \"Persephone's reasoning is sound. Escort the shade Eumelia to the Meadows, Minos.\" This time he ignored the shade's entreaties and cries. He turned to Persephone, letting pleasure color his voice. \"That was well done.\" \"Thank you, my lord,\" Persephone said with a satisfied smile. She reached for the nearby bowl of fruit, lifted a ripe apple to her lips. \"Stop!\" Hades said, panicked. He grabbed Persephone's wrist, felt the warm skin and strong muscle move under his grip as she tried to tug her hand away. He tightened his grasp. \"What are you doing?\" she snapped, the old suspicion back in her eyes. \"Forgive me, I had forgotten to warn you,\" Hades said quickly, his gaze fixed upon the apple only a finger's width away from Persephone's mouth. \"If you eat anything other than nectar and ambrosia here, you will not be able to return to the surface.\" The idea of Persephone staying here was...well, it had some appeal, if Hades was honest with himself, but the idea of Persephone trapped unwillingly for the rest of time was horrifying. \"I see,\" Persephone said. Her expression softened a little. \"Thank you for the warning.\" He released her, and she dropped the apple back into the bowl. \"Then might I have some ambrosia?\" \"Of course,\" Hades said, breathing a sigh of relief. Persephone rested her chin on her fist and smiled at him, pale eyes gleaming with mischief. \"And perhaps tomorrow I might be the one to feed Cerberus?\" she suggested, and laughed once more at his expression. ** ** \"How often do you use your chariot?\" Persephone asked after the first week. She was seated sideways on her throne again, feet swinging idly over the armrest, her eyes focused upon his face. \"Not often,\" Hades answered, wondering why she was interested and trying not to be distracted by her pale bare feet. The goddess had not worn any sort of footwear in her time in the underworld, not since she'd first discarded her sandals. \"I use it when Zeus has one of his banquets, but otherwise I do not venture outside the underworld. Well, except in emergencies, when shades escape and I must retrieve them.\" It had never happened often, and occurred even less after he'd installed Cerberus at the gates. Persephone arched an eyebrow. \"The horses must grow bored. How do you keep them from idleness?\" \"Well, they are immortal, so they do not run to fat as mortal horses do, but Charon also takes them on weekly flights.\" \"Flights?\" There was a gleam in Persephone's eyes that Hades was beginning to recognize, one that promised mischief and upheavals in his life. \"Do you think Charon would mind if we rode the horses today?\" \"You want to...ride the horses,\" Hades said carefully, in case he had misunderstood. \"Yes,\" said Persephone. She smiled a little, no doubt at his expression. \"If you do not wish to, I understand, I only thought it might liven up the day--\" \"I will prepare the horses myself,\" Hades said. As he neared the stables, he caught sight of his reflection in the silver gate and paused, studying his half-pleased, half-bemused look. The faint smile felt odd on his lips, but he was growing used to Persephone and her unusual ideas, the way she seemed content to take the tedious routine of the underworld and turn it upside down. Both horses greeted him with startled snorts, craning their heads and huffing puzzled but happy hellos into his shoulder as he patted them on the neck. \"How would you two enjoy a flight?\" he queried, not waiting for an answer as he opened the door and lead them outside. Persephone smiled at the sight of the horses. \"I was too distracted before. I didn't notice how beautiful they were,\" she said quietly, reaching out and stroking one's glossy black mane. Then she turned the smile upon Hades. \"Are you ready?\" Hades nodded. He started to ask if she needed assistance, and then watched without much surprise as Persephone expertly vaulted onto the back of the nearest horse. \"Artemis and her maidens often ride wild horses,\" Persephone explained, laughing. In the next instant, she and her horse were aloft, her dark hair whipping around her face and a warm flush darkening her cheeks. \"Shall we race to Lethe and back?\" she asked. \"Race?\" Hades echoed, but then she was gone, her laughter trailing after her. He watched her go for a second, before his horse's impatient snort brought him back to his senses. He smiled at the stallion and mounted. \"Go ahead, catch her,\" he murmured into that listening ear, and then closed his eyes as the horse leapt upwards, wind roaring in his ears. ** ** \"I think I shall never tire of these,\" Persephone said happily, kneeling among the Asphodel flowers. There was a smudge of dirt upon her cheek; still more was caked upon her feet as she wiggled her toes in the dirt. Hades stilled his tongue before what he wanted to say could spill out and betray him. These types of compulsions had grown during Persephone's time here, as she had sat on her marble throne and shared his table and his duties. Flying the horses had become a near daily thing, and he knew both he and the horses would miss the flights once Persephone was gone. The urge to say, 'You shall always have these flowers by your bedside, even when you return to the surface' or something equally impractical was overwhelming. He swallowed back the words and nodded his agreement. Then he offered her a flower, gesturing for her to tuck it into her hair. She did so, the moon-pale flower made still paler by the darkness of her hair. Persephone smiled in delight. \"Shall we have the judges to dine with us tonight? I find myself longing for one of Minos's stories.\" \"As do I,\" Hades agreed. He stood, offering her a hand. She took it, hauling herself upright with a bright laugh. Her hand was warm in his; the heat lingered even after she pulled away. She gathered up the flowers she had cut, and smiled at him. \"Do you think Charon would like a bouquet for his boat?\" she asked. \"It might brighten the waters of the Acheron a little.\" Hades pictured Charon's expression upon being handed a bouquet of flowers, and bit back a smile. \"He would appreciate the gesture, I am certain,\" he said. Then he looked up as a distant sound reached his ears. It almost sounded like wings, but the horses were all in the stable-- \"Hermes!\" Persephone cried, glowing with delight. The flowers tumbled, forgotten, to her feet, the whiteness spreading across the greenery like spilled wine. She extended her arms and laughed as Hermes landed and immediately swept her into an embrace. Hades watched, fighting the urge to scowl. He had no claim on Persephone. Besides, Hermes was one of the few gods with whom Hades actually enjoyed spending time. Hades could not begrudge him a visit. \"Hermes,\" he said, and winced inwardly at the coolness of the greeting. \"Welcome, nephew.\" Hermes didn't look at him though, grasping Persephone by the elbows and pulling back to study her. \"You look well, cousin,\" he said, voice warm with relief. \"Better than I expected, after Apollo explained what happened. He has not harmed you?\" Puzzlement replaced Persephone's joy. \"Who would or could harm me in the underworld?\" she asked. \"There is no danger here, cousin. Even Cerberus is tame once he knows you are a friend and guest of Hades.\" \"A guest of Hades? Does he insist you call yourself that and not his prisoner?\" Hermes said, laughing harshly. \"Apollo told us what he saw.\" \"And what did Apollo tell you?\" Persephone demanded, flushing a dark, ugly red and scowling at him. \"Lies, apparently, or else you would not be so rude to Hades in his own kingdom. You have not answered his greeting and now you act as though he forced me here against my will!\" \"But he did!\" Hermes said, startled. \"...Or at least that's what Apollo told Demeter after she searched the world for you. He said that Hades snatched you from a field in Enna while Artemis and Athena were distracted.\" \"I did not,\" Hades interjected, seeing that Persephone was about ready to yell with fury. \"She came with me of her own free will.\" \"And why would she do that, uncle?\" Hermes finally looked at him, and the cold suspicion in his eyes hurt. Hades had thought Hermes knew him better than that. \"I do not mean to be rude, but no one visits the underworld willingly.\" \"Hades extended an invitation to visit his palace for as long as it took for Zeus to lose interest,\" Persephone said flatly. \"Athena and Artemis, if you bother to ask them, will tell you the truth. They arranged it, after all.\" Her eyes glinted, cold as ice. \"And I shall have words with Apollo regarding his lies.\" \"Persephone,\" Hades said. \"Doubtless Apollo was trying to protect you from your mother's wrath.\" \"Trying to save his own skin from my mother, more like,\" Persephone muttered darkly. She shook her head. \"Hermes, I swear to you by the river Styx that I came here of my own free will. I swear that Hades has given me leave to go whenever I wish. I swear that I have enjoyed my time spent here.\" Hermes, who had winced a little at the mention of the river Styx, nevertheless looked relieved. \"I am glad to hear it,\" he said, and then turned to Hades. \"Forgive me, uncle, for my discourtesy.\" Hades waved a hand. \"You are forgiven. You had no reason to doubt Apollo's word.\" \"No reason but my own common sense,\" Hermes said, frowning. \"I knew you for a better god than that.\" He looked at Persephone. \"Your mother has caused uproar on Olympus, Persephone. No flowers, no fruit, nothing blooms on earth. The mortals are struggling to survive this endless winter Demeter has cast upon the world in her misery, and Olympus wants for sacrifices. She will only relent once you are returned to her side. I have orders from Zeus. You must come with me.\" Hades closed his eyes for an instant, the words like a blow. He'd known this moment was coming, after all. He should have been ready. Now Persephone would return to the surface, and he would have to...adjust to the hole she'd leave in his life. It was as simple as that. \"And what if I do not wish to return?\" Persephone demanded. Hades opened his eyes to stare. \"Persephone,\" he said, her name tentative on his lips. He watched a pale flush spread across her cheeks, noticed the way she kept her gaze focused on Hermes. \"Do not--\" Hermes, Hades was relieved to see, looked just as bewildered as Hades himself. \"Cousin, Zeus has given you an order. You must obey.\" \"I see,\" Persephone said. Hades recognized this look at least; it was the miserable, angry one she'd worn in the field of Enna, when she'd thought she had no choice or voice in her own life. She took a deep breath, then turned to Hades. When she spoke, her voice was low. \"I am sorry, my lord.\" Hades wanted to speak, to assure her she had nothing to apologize for, but the words cluttered up his throat and he couldn't breathe a single syllable. Instead he shook his head and caught her hand between his, squeezing it gently. There was a long silence, and then Hermes cleared his throat, looking unusually hesitant. \"Shall we go, cousin?\" \"I need a few things at the palace,\" Persephone said, pale eyes not leaving Hades's face. \"I'll be but a moment.\" With that, she turned and walked away, trampling the discarded flowers under her feet. Hades watched her go, his chest aching. \"Uncle, I--\" Hermes began, and stopped with a sigh. \"I am sorry, uncle.\" \"So am I,\" Hades said bleakly and turned away from the sight of Persephone's receding back. ** ** \"She is truly gone, my lord?\" Charon demanded, bursting into the hall. Hades didn't look away from the empty marble throne next to him. He would have to get rid of it, somehow. Simply looking at it brought fresh pain. \"Hermes escorted her to the surface yesterday,\" he said. Charon swore. \"Forgive me, my lord, but why? She seemed happy here!\" \"She was, I think,\" Hades said. \"But Zeus ordered her to return.\" \"Zeus,\" Charon muttered darkly, and then paced before Persephone's throne, scowling at the floor. Finally his frenzied pacing eased, and he stood between the two thrones, shoulders bowed. \"I shall miss her, my lord.\" 'So will I,' Hades didn't say. He didn't need to. He rested his head in his hands, closing his eyes against the weariness. \"My lord,\" Charon said after a moment, with forced cheer. \"That is a waste of perfectly good fruit!\" \"Charon, what are you talking about?\" Hades demanded irritably. \"The pomegranate, my lord,\" Charon said. \"You've split it open and left everything but the seeds. Isn't the flesh the best part?\" \"I have not had a pomegranate in days,\" Hades began, and then looked up. Slowly he turned to look at the bowl of fruit, the pomegranate that Charon held in his hand. \"I--\" He felt himself smiling, an incredulous overwhelming happiness welling up inside him. Laughter burst from him, making Charon jump. \"My lord?\" Charon said, looking at him as though he had gone mad. \"I did not eat those seeds, Charon,\" Hades said. He watched realization steal slowly upon Charon's face, and then together they both gave into their delight, their laughter ringing through the hall. Hades took the pomegranate, and held it up, watched how it caught the torchlight and glittered like red jewels. \"Pomegranates,\" he murmured after a moment, \"shall forever be my favorite fruit.\"",

      "\"No doubt atop Hermes's head,\" he commented, quelling his amused smile before it could reach his lips.",

      "The other hand gripped his goblet tighter as cool nectar spilled upon his fingers.",

      "\"No, you said you'd stolen--\" she began, only to be interrupted once more.",
      "\"Persephone!\"",

      "\"I don't blame you,\" Dionysus assured her, and then glanced at Demeter.",
      "\"Don't be too harsh, Demeter.",

      "\"Quite an unusual child,\" he remarked.",

      "Dionysus had not yet asked after his mother, but Hades knew he would, eventually.",
      "\"Mortal-god entanglements rarely end well,\" he added, more quietly.",

      "Hades looked up from his nectar in time to spot the fleeting, pleased smile that briefly warmed Athena's wintry gray eyes.",
      "Ah.",
      "Perhaps Athena had helped Marpessa along with her decision.",
      "It was either that, or she was simply proud of a mortal for making such a prudent choice.",
      "\"And then there is Persephone, causing her mother grief and scorning Aphrodite,\" Athena continued.",

      "And, of course, she doesn't want to incur Zeus's displeasure either.\"",
      "\"Zeus?",
      "Why would Zeus be angry?\" Hades asked.",
      "He'd expect Aphrodite to be furious--her revenge upon those who scorned love was legendary--but what had Zeus to do with Persephone?",
      "The look Athena directed at him was a little amused, but a little condescending as well, as though she sometimes thought Zeus alone of Cronus and Rhea's children had been given the gift of intelligence.",
      "\"Come now, uncle.",

      "We all know my father takes that as a particular challenge.\"",

      "\"Yes.\"",
      "He found himself flinching away from the thought.",
      "He knew of his brother's fondness for the chase, of Zeus's delight in finding the most unwilling women and softening their hearts towards him--or, if that failed, using his powers as king of the gods to break their will and take what he pleased.",
      "Hades thought of the merry child who'd raced around the banquet hall with Dionysus's crown atop her head, soon broken to halter at Zeus's whim, and felt a little ill.",
      "When he looked again at Athena, he couldn't read the expression in her pale eyes.",

      "\"My lady, my lady, I knew not your name or status to worship you while I lived, but pray send me to Elysium,\" she begged, oblivious to Persephone's startled expression.",
      "\"I have committed a cruelty, I freely admit as much, but nothing terrible enough to deserve Tartarus.",
      "Please, my lady.\"",
      "\"It is not me you should implore, but Hades,\" Persephone said, a pale flush creeping into her cheeks.",
      "The shade flinched at the name and darted a quick, terrified look at Hades.",
      "\"Speak to Clymenus?\" she whispered.",
      "\"Oh, my lady, I couldn't.\"",
      "Persephone glanced at Hades, and when he nodded, turned to Minos.",
      "\"What has she done in her life that you cannot choose?\"",
      "\"It is very much a quandary, my lady.",
      "She has committed both a great evil and a great good.\"",
      "\"I see,\" said Persephone, frowning.",
      "Then she turned back to Hades.",
      "\"My lord, it seems to me that if she has committed both great evil and great good, then she has balanced the scales.",
      "Should she not go to the Asphodel Meadows?\"",
      "At that, the shade let out a howl of despair.",
      "\"Not the Meadows, my lady!",
      "I could not bear the tedium!\"",
      "Persephone frowned upon the shade.",
      "\"You do not wish to be thrown into Tartarus, and now, when offered a better option of the Fields, you scorn the offer?\" she said, very low and deceptively mild.",
      "Only Hades was close enough to see the hard look in her eyes.",
      "\"Perhaps you should have thought of this moment before you committed a great evil, Eumelia.\"",
      "\"But my lady--\" the shade began to protest.",
      "Hades held up a hand, and the shade fell silent.",
      "\"Persephone's reasoning is sound.",
      "Escort the shade Eumelia to the Meadows, Minos.\"",
      "This time he ignored the shade's entreaties and cries.",
      "He turned to Persephone, letting pleasure color his voice.",
      "\"That was well done.\"",
      "\"Thank you, my lord,\" Persephone said with a satisfied smile.",
      "She reached for the nearby bowl of fruit, lifted a ripe apple to her lips.",
      "\"Stop!\"",
      "Hades said, panicked.",
      "He grabbed Persephone's wrist, felt the warm skin and strong muscle move under his grip as she tried to tug her hand away.",
      "He tightened his grasp.",
      "\"What are you doing?\" she snapped, the old suspicion back in her eyes.",
      "\"Forgive me, I had forgotten to warn you,\" Hades said quickly, his gaze fixed upon the apple only a finger's width away from Persephone's mouth.",
      "\"If you eat anything other than nectar and ambrosia here, you will not be able to return to the surface.\"",
      "The idea of Persephone staying here was...well, it had some appeal, if Hades was honest with himself, but the idea of Persephone trapped unwillingly for the rest of time was horrifying.",
      "\"I see,\" Persephone said.",
      "Her expression softened a little.",
      "\"Thank you for the warning.\"",
      "He released her, and she dropped the apple back into the bowl.",
      "\"Then might I have some ambrosia?\"",
      "\"Of course,\" Hades said, breathing a sigh of relief.",
      "Persephone rested her chin on her fist and smiled at him, pale eyes gleaming with mischief.",
      "\"And perhaps tomorrow I might be the one to feed Cerberus?\" she suggested, and laughed once more at his expression.",
      "*",
      "* ** \"How often do you use your chariot?\" Persephone asked after the first week.",
      "She was seated sideways on her throne again, feet swinging idly over the armrest, her eyes focused upon his face.",
      "\"Not often,\" Hades answered, wondering why she was interested and trying not to be distracted by her pale bare feet.",
      "The goddess had not worn any sort of footwear in her time in the underworld, not since she'd first discarded her sandals.",
      "\"I use it when Zeus has one of his banquets, but otherwise I do not venture outside the underworld.",
      "Well, except in emergencies, when shades escape and I must retrieve them.\"",
      "It had never happened often, and occurred even less after he'd installed Cerberus at the gates.",
      "Persephone arched an eyebrow.",
      "\"The horses must grow bored.",
      "How do you keep them from idleness?\"",
      "\"Well, they are immortal, so they do not run to fat as mortal horses do, but Charon also takes them on weekly flights.\"",
      "\"Flights?\"",
      "There was a gleam in Persephone's eyes that Hades was beginning to recognize, one that promised mischief and upheavals in his life.",
      "\"Do you think Charon would mind if we rode the horses today?\"",
      "\"You want to...ride the horses,\" Hades said carefully, in case he had misunderstood.",
      "\"Yes,\" said Persephone.",
      "She smiled a little, no doubt at his expression.",
      "\"If you do not wish to, I understand, I only thought it might liven up the day--\" \"I will prepare the horses myself,\" Hades said.",
      "As he neared the stables, he caught sight of his reflection in the silver gate and paused, studying his half-pleased, half-bemused look.",
      "The faint smile felt odd on his lips, but he was growing used to Persephone and her unusual ideas, the way she seemed content to take the tedious routine of the underworld and turn it upside down.",
      "Both horses greeted him with startled snorts, craning their heads and huffing puzzled but happy hellos into his shoulder as he patted them on the neck.",
      "\"How would you two enjoy a flight?\" he queried, not waiting for an answer as he opened the door and lead them outside.",
      "Persephone smiled at the sight of the horses.",
      "\"I was too distracted before.",
      "I didn't notice how beautiful they were,\" she said quietly, reaching out and stroking one's glossy black mane.",
      "Then she turned the smile upon Hades.",
      "\"Are you ready?\" Hades nodded.",
      "He started to ask if she needed assistance, and then watched without much surprise as Persephone expertly vaulted onto the back of the nearest horse.",
      "\"Artemis and her maidens often ride wild horses,\" Persephone explained, laughing.",
      "In the next instant, she and her horse were aloft, her dark hair whipping around her face and a warm flush darkening her cheeks.",
      "\"Shall we race to Lethe and back?\" she asked.",
      "\"Race?\" Hades echoed, but then she was gone, her laughter trailing after her.",
      "He watched her go for a second, before his horse's impatient snort brought him back to his senses.",
      "He smiled at the stallion and mounted.",
      "\"Go ahead, catch her,\" he murmured into that listening ear, and then closed his eyes as the horse leapt upwards, wind roaring in his ears.",
      "*",
      "* ** \"I think I shall never tire of these,\" Persephone said happily, kneeling among the Asphodel flowers.",
      "There was a smudge of dirt upon her cheek; still more was caked upon her feet as she wiggled her toes in the dirt.",
      "Hades stilled his tongue before what he wanted to say could spill out and betray him.",
      "These types of compulsions had grown during Persephone's time here, as she had sat on her marble throne and shared his table and his duties.",
      "Flying the horses had become a near daily thing, and he knew both he and the horses would miss the flights once Persephone was gone.",
      "The urge to say, 'You shall always have these flowers by your bedside, even when you return to the surface' or something equally impractical was overwhelming.",
      "He swallowed back the words and nodded his agreement.",
      "Then he offered her a flower, gesturing for her to tuck it into her hair.",
      "She did so, the moon-pale flower made still paler by the darkness of her hair.",
      "Persephone smiled in delight.",
      "\"Shall we have the judges to dine with us tonight?",
      "I find myself longing for one of Minos's stories.\"",
      "\"As do I,\" Hades agreed.",
      "He stood, offering her a hand.",
      "She took it, hauling herself upright with a bright laugh.",
      "Her hand was warm in his; the heat lingered even after she pulled away.",
      "She gathered up the flowers she had cut, and smiled at him.",
      "\"Do you think Charon would like a bouquet for his boat?\" she asked.",
      "\"It might brighten the waters of the Acheron a little.\"",
      "Hades pictured Charon's expression upon being handed a bouquet of flowers, and bit back a smile.",
      "\"He would appreciate the gesture, I am certain,\" he said.",
      "Then he looked up as a distant sound reached his ears.",
      "It almost sounded like wings, but the horses were all in the stable-- \"Hermes!\"",
      "Persephone cried, glowing with delight.",
      "The flowers tumbled, forgotten, to her feet, the whiteness spreading across the greenery like spilled wine.",
      "She extended her arms and laughed as Hermes landed and immediately swept her into an embrace.",
      "Hades watched, fighting the urge to scowl.",
      "He had no claim on Persephone.",
      "Besides, Hermes was one of the few gods with whom Hades actually enjoyed spending time.",
      "Hades could not begrudge him a visit.",
      "\"Hermes,\" he said, and winced inwardly at the coolness of the greeting.",
      "\"Welcome, nephew.\"",
      "Hermes didn't look at him though, grasping Persephone by the elbows and pulling back to study her.",
      "\"You look well, cousin,\" he said, voice warm with relief.",
      "\"Better than I expected, after Apollo explained what happened.",
      "He has not harmed you?\" Puzzlement replaced Persephone's joy.",
      "\"Who would or could harm me in the underworld?\" she asked.",
      "\"There is no danger here, cousin.",
      "Even Cerberus is tame once he knows you are a friend and guest of Hades.\"",
      "\"A guest of Hades?",
      "Does he insist you call yourself that and not his prisoner?\" Hermes said, laughing harshly.",
      "\"Apollo told us what he saw.\"",
      "\"And what did Apollo tell you?\" Persephone demanded, flushing a dark, ugly red and scowling at him.",
      "\"Lies, apparently, or else you would not be so rude to Hades in his own kingdom.",
      "You have not answered his greeting and now you act as though he forced me here against my will!\"",
      "\"But he did!\"",
      "Hermes said, startled.",
      "\"...Or at least that's what Apollo told Demeter after she searched the world for you.",
      "He said that Hades snatched you from a field in Enna while Artemis and Athena were distracted.\"",
      "\"I did not,\" Hades interjected, seeing that Persephone was about ready to yell with fury.",
      "\"She came with me of her own free will.\"",
      "\"And why would she do that, uncle?\" Hermes finally looked at him, and the cold suspicion in his eyes hurt.",
      "Hades had thought Hermes knew him better than that.",
      "\"I do not mean to be rude, but no one visits the underworld willingly.\"",
      "\"Hades extended an invitation to visit his palace for as long as it took for Zeus to lose interest,\" Persephone said flatly.",
      "\"Athena and Artemis, if you bother to ask them, will tell you the truth.",
      "They arranged it, after all.\"",
      "Her eyes glinted, cold as ice.",
      "\"And I shall have words with Apollo regarding his lies.\"",
      "\"Persephone,\" Hades said.",
      "\"Doubtless Apollo was trying to protect you from your mother's wrath.\"",
      "\"Trying to save his own skin from my mother, more like,\" Persephone muttered darkly.",
      "She shook her head.",
      "\"Hermes, I swear to you by the river Styx that I came here of my own free will.",
      "I swear that Hades has given me leave to go whenever I wish.",
      "I swear that I have enjoyed my time spent here.\"",
      "Hermes, who had winced a little at the mention of the river Styx, nevertheless looked relieved.",
      "\"I am glad to hear it,\" he said, and then turned to Hades.",
      "\"Forgive me, uncle, for my discourtesy.\"",
      "Hades waved a hand.",
      "\"You are forgiven.",
      "You had no reason to doubt Apollo's word.\"",
      "\"No reason but my own common sense,\" Hermes said, frowning.",
      "\"I knew you for a better god than that.\"",
      "He looked at Persephone.",
      "\"Your mother has caused uproar on Olympus, Persephone.",
      "No flowers, no fruit, nothing blooms on earth.",
      "The mortals are struggling to survive this endless winter Demeter has cast upon the world in her misery, and Olympus wants for sacrifices.",
      "She will only relent once you are returned to her side.",
      "I have orders from Zeus.",
      "You must come with me.\"",
      "Hades closed his eyes for an instant, the words like a blow.",
      "He'd known this moment was coming, after all.",
      "He should have been ready.",
      "Now Persephone would return to the surface, and he would have to...adjust to the hole she'd leave in his life.",
      "It was as simple as that.",
      "\"And what if I do not wish to return?\" Persephone demanded.",
      "Hades opened his eyes to stare.",
      "\"Persephone,\" he said, her name tentative on his lips.",
      "He watched a pale flush spread across her cheeks, noticed the way she kept her gaze focused on Hermes.",
      "\"Do not--\" Hermes, Hades was relieved to see, looked just as bewildered as Hades himself.",
      "\"Cousin, Zeus has given you an order.",
      "You must obey.\"",
      "\"I see,\" Persephone said.",
      "Hades recognized this look at least; it was the miserable, angry one she'd worn in the field of Enna, when she'd thought she had no choice or voice in her own life.",
      "She took a deep breath, then turned to Hades.",
      "When she spoke, her voice was low.",
      "\"I am sorry, my lord.\"",
      "Hades wanted to speak, to assure her she had nothing to apologize for, but the words cluttered up his throat and he couldn't breathe a single syllable.",
      "Instead he shook his head and caught her hand between his, squeezing it gently.",
      "There was a long silence, and then Hermes cleared his throat, looking unusually hesitant.",
      "\"Shall we go, cousin?\"",
      "\"I need a few things at the palace,\" Persephone said, pale eyes not leaving Hades's face.",
      "\"I'll be but a moment.\"",
      "With that, she turned and walked away, trampling the discarded flowers under her feet.",
      "Hades watched her go, his chest aching.",
      "\"Uncle, I--\" Hermes began, and stopped with a sigh.",
      "\"I am sorry, uncle.\"",
      "\"So am I,\" Hades said bleakly and turned away from the sight of Persephone's receding back.",
      "*",
      "* ** \"She is truly gone, my lord?\" Charon demanded, bursting into the hall.",
      "Hades didn't look away from the empty marble throne next to him.",
      "He would have to get rid of it, somehow.",
      "Simply looking at it brought fresh pain.",
      "\"Hermes escorted her to the surface yesterday,\" he said.",
      "Charon swore.",
      "\"Forgive me, my lord, but why?",
      "She seemed happy here!\"",
      "\"She was, I think,\" Hades said.",
      "\"But Zeus ordered her to return.\"",
      "\"Zeus,\" Charon muttered darkly, and then paced before Persephone's throne, scowling at the floor.",
      "Finally his frenzied pacing eased, and he stood between the two thrones, shoulders bowed.",
      "\"I shall miss her, my lord.\"",
      "'So will I,' Hades didn't say.",
      "He didn't need to.",
      "He rested his head in his hands, closing his eyes against the weariness.",
      "\"My lord,\" Charon said after a moment, with forced cheer.",
      "\"That is a waste of perfectly good fruit!\"",
      "\"Charon, what are you talking about?\" Hades demanded irritably.",
      "\"The pomegranate, my lord,\" Charon said.",
      "\"You've split it open and left everything but the seeds.",
      "Isn't the flesh the best part?\"",
      "\"I have not had a pomegranate in days,\" Hades began, and then looked up.",
      "Slowly he turned to look at the bowl of fruit, the pomegranate that Charon held in his hand.",
      "\"I--\" He felt himself smiling, an incredulous overwhelming happiness welling up inside him.",
      "Laughter burst from him, making Charon jump.",
      "\"My lord?\" Charon said, looking at him as though he had gone mad.",
      "\"I did not eat those seeds, Charon,\" Hades said.",
      "He watched realization steal slowly upon Charon's face, and then together they both gave into their delight, their laughter ringing through the hall.",
      "Hades took the pomegranate, and held it up, watched how it caught the torchlight and glittered like red jewels.",
      "\"Pomegranates,\" he murmured after a moment, \"shall forever be my favorite fruit.\""

    "text": "I. Fall of Troy When Kassandra was three years old, she prophesied the fall of Troy, with words like firebrand, lust, and destruction: words she was not old enough to understand and not able to speak. And no one doubted that it was Apollo who spoke through her. King Priam snatched the still crying infant from the arms of his queen and gave him up lest he bring doom on all of Troy. But Hecuba never forgave Kassandra for this and when time came, she parted easily from her and sent her to be reared at the sanctuary of the mouse god. When Kassandra refused Apollo on a whim, not yet old enough to understand its full implications, she so feared the taking away of her sight that when Apollo pronounced his curse on her, she could only think to be grateful that gods could not take back gifts already bestowed, only mar them. And this curse, too, felt like a blessing, certainly more so than the visions did at first. She had borne the burden of prophecies revered, grown up in another city, away from family and siblings, returned home to find herself a stranger in her own city, but when no one believed her words, they forgot them soon enough. And she found that when people did not fear her, she could persuade them in other ways than to tell them that she had seen the future. - II. Sack of Thebe When Andromache was three years old, she bound herself to Hektor with words she was barely able to repeat as her mother said them for her. An oracle had prophesied that Andromache would one day be the queen of a Greek city, and her mother, unable to bear the thought of her only daughter living across a wide sea, had King Eetion send a marriage proposal to Troy as part of a trade treaty, and so Andromache became betrothed to Hektor. Years later, when her mother parted from Andromache and sent her to Troy, she made Andromache promise that she would visit often, and said, \"After all, did I not defy the Fates themselves to ensure that you would be able to?\" In Troy, she found herself alone in a household filled with Priam's children. As the wife of his eldest, she was the first - and the only - outsider amongst them. Her mind and ears strained to keep up with their rapidly spoken dialect, which she had thought she was fluent in. Hektor spoke to her slowly, and waited patiently for her to process his words and gave her time to come up with her answers, but in the women's quarters, her silence made her easily overlooked. So she built her life around Hektor, and she missed her brothers and her parents and counted days till her mother would send for her, or till Hektor would leave to negotiate treaties so she may leave. When Hektor finally left that first winter, and the weather made it impossible for Andromache to travel north. She was left to spend her days in women's hall, and she cried herself to sleep every night. \"You've been crying,\" a woman said to her. She was surprised at being spoken to when she had taken care to sit away from everyone at her loom, and so accustomed she had become to the Trojans' clipped dialect that it took her a while before realizing that Kassandra had addressed her in her own tongue, and she remembered that Kassandra, too, lived far from her family in Apollo's sanctuary that was closer to Thebe than it was to Troy. \"I have been far from home for too long, and now the Fates conspire to keep me away longer,\" Andromache replied. Kassandra considered her words for a while before she said, \"Perhaps it is to give you time to make a home here?\" Taking that as reproach, Andromache hastened to explain, \"It is only that I feel the absence of Hektor and have little to occupy myself with.\" \"Too many people have claims on Hektor, and if he's your only connection to Troy, you will often find yourself missing your Thebe.\" And so Andromache took her advice and started to make a place for herself amongst Priam's daughters. When Hektor returned, she found herself dividing her time between him and Kassandra, who provided Andromache with a glimpse of home away from Thebe, and she found herself grounded in Troy as she never had been throughout her marriage. When Hektor went away next, she missed him less, and when time came for Kassandra to return to Apollo's temple, she asked Andromache to come with her and took her to Thebe, and instead of staying at the temple, she came back to Troy with Andromache. Next spring, Andromache found herself pregnant, and custom called for her to travel to her mother's house for the birthing. This time, Kassandra did not offer to go with her, and instead, she persuaded Andromache to stay in Troy and said, \"Hektor would not ask you to stay, but he would want to see his firstborn delivered in Troy. Stay through this, and I will come with you to Thebe next spring.\" And Andromache stayed less for Hektor, and more because she liked the thought of Kassandra being with her in Thebe and wondered what her eldest brother would think of her sister-in-law. Three days later, she received word that Thebe was besieged by Greek forces, and King Eetion had asked for reinforcements. And Hecuba said, \"It is a good thing, Daughter, that you did not go to Thebe as you had wanted to, or you, too, would be in grave danger.\" Remembering rumors about Kassandra that she had previously dismissed, Andromache went to her and asked, \"Did you know that Thebe would be besieged?\" \"I knew that the Achaeans were on their way, and that Thebe is closest to the shores they had docked at,\" replied Kassandra, not really answering Andromache's question. \"Did you think I might be endangered? Is that why you would have me stay?\" \"I only wanted you safe in Troy.\" \"But I would have been able to let my father know! My mother, at least, could have come to Troy and avoided the battles.\" \"They would not have heeded your word. Did your mother not defy the gods themselves in sending you to Troy instead of to Greece? Why believe in prophecies now?\" \"As you defy them now,\" said Andromache, and then, more quietly, \"What will become of Thebe?\" Kassandra did not reply, but her silence was an answer. Andromache lost the baby first, at the end of that year, and then news came that the Achaeans had slayed all of her brothers and King Eetion. She could not thank Kassandra for her life, nor forgive her. - III. A Thousand Ships The first time Andromache saw Kassandra through a vision was a fortnight before Paris brought Helen to Troy, when Priam was still refusing to admit to the Greek envoys that he knew where his son was at all. It started calmly with Kassandra going still as a fortress, her eyes glazing over and her mouth stilling in the middle of what she was saying to Hecuba, and Andromache watched as Hecuba's eyes turned cold and she turned away and slowly, this reaction went around the room. Only Polyxena stayed and held her hand but Andromache could sense the fear in the little girl. Andromache gestured for Polyxena to let her take Kassandra, but she could feel the tremors starting through her even before they retreated from the women's hall. Kassandra fell into a frenzied trance, and her rapidly spoken Trojan dialect was lost on Andromache's ears and for this she was thankful. And as she watched Kassandra lose all control, she understood Kassandra's need for for it, and her need to guide people away from their destinies in the face of her utter lack of control over herself. She found herself wondering how Kassandra would recover herself again after having lost herself so completely to the visions. But she would see this again before Helen came. This is how Kassandra lost herself and found herself again, always recovering with a greater resistance. She still could not forgive her, but she understood her. --- When Helen came to Troy, her presence shattered Kassandra's carefully cultivated aloofness, and the words of Apollo came through her mouth unheeded once more. She saw a thousand ships instead of the dozen that Paris and Helen brought with them to Troy. Saw blazing fires burning in Helen's brilliant eyes, and she prophesied death, doom, and destruction. She felt the weight of the sight and the curse both as she spoke, but her impassioned words were no match for Helen's grace and beauty, for her sheer presence that seemed to overwhelm even Kassandra. In the mist of eyes that regarded her with suspicion and pity, she saw recognition in Helen's. Calmed by this acknowledgement, Kassandra came back to herself to find Andromache holding on to her through the visions. She waited to fully recover from the visions before finding Helen and asked, \"You have seen the destruction of Troy, have you not?\" \"I would not have come here if I had,\" Helen replied, regarding Kassandra carefully. And then said, \"No, what I see is the presence of Apollo in you. Of his blessing. And his curse.\" \"Will you not go back, then? Knowing what you bring?\" \"You cannot think that *I* bring this destruction you speak of?\" \"Not you, but Nemesis brings destruction through you.\" \"Or so your visions show you. But I have known gods to be liars and prophecies to be trickery,\" Helen said with conviction, and this unsettled Kassandra. Helen's blasphemy did not come from lack of belief as Andromache's did, or from a sense of arrogance as Paris' did, but rather from complete belief in the existence of the gods and the existence of their indifference towards her. And she sensed the presence of the sight in Helen, a sight that came from who she was - a daughter of the gods, if she believed the rumors, Zeus, or Nemesis, or both --, and not because any god had seen fit to bless her or curse her. So Helen stayed, and the ships came, but Kassandra could not find it in her to blame Helen for any of it. And through the years, she watched Helen weave war, death, and destruction into her tapestries while the other women weaved flowers or pleasing patterns, and she knew that the war sat heavily on Helen's mind, but Helen never spoke any words of guilt or regret, even if that would have made things easier for her. But Helen took responsibility for the deaths in her own way, weaving death shrouds for the fallen of Troy, and Kassandra saw her retreat to her own quarters when the news of death came from the Greek side, the deaths of a former suitor, a friend, or a relative. These deaths, she was not allowed to mourn in public, and when she came back, her eyes were always brighter, and her smiles a bit more dazzling, as if to convince the Trojans that the Greek losses did not mean anything to her, as if she had always been theirs and never an enemy. And Kassandra thought, not for the first time, that Helen's easy grace and beguiling smiles cost her something. She did not ask Helen to return to the Greeks again, and she knew that going to the Greek camps with warriors that cursed Helen's name with each waking hour would not be safe. But in the last year of the war, after Paris' death, when she could barely sleep from being plagued by all the visions of every death and dismemberment, she gave into her weakness and pleaded with Helen again to return to Menelaus. \"Kassandra, Kassandra...you still don't understand, do you? You cannot change what's written.\" \"You sell yourself short, Helen, if you feel that you have no control over your actions.\" \"My actions, yes, but I do not fool myself into thinking that any of them make a bit of a difference to the indifferent gods.\" - IV. Death of Hektor The first time Kassandra saw Hektor's death was when Andromache gave birth to Astyanax, and Andromache sensed the change in Kassandra and remembered Thebe. \"What do you see?\" Andromache asked her, still weak from childbirth. Kassandra shook her head, and said, \"Nothing you need worry about.\" \"You need not protect me from whatever it is. Tell me so I can decide for myself what to do.\" She did not mention Thebe, but the loss of her home and her city still sat between them. \"Your husband will not always be victorious on the battlefield,\" Kassandra replied. Andromache let out a brittle, hollow laugh, and said, \"If Troy should fall as you say it will, I never imagined that it would happen with Hektor still living.\" Despite the lightness of her response, Kassandra could sense Andromache's despair. She reached out and stroked Andromache's arm in comfort, which Andromache grasped in hers and held on to. Finally, she let go, and said, \"I am tired. I think I shall sleep for a bit.\" When Andromache told Hektor of this, he reassured her, but did not stay away from the battlefields. In her waking hours, she knew that if Hektor stayed with her, it would only hasten the prophecies, but at night, she clung to him and asked him to make promises he could not keep. \"How long do we have?\" she would ask Kassandra when they were alone, unable to focus on anything else. She found that if she did not focus on Hektor's fate, she started to wonder about her own, which she refused to ask Kassandra about. And eventually, she could not keep up the level of anxiety, which started to fade as the fear of Hektor's death became a distant possibility. But she saw Kassandra arguing with Hektor one day, and while she could not hear them, she knew it would not be long. So she retreated to her room and played with her son as if it were just another day. When Hektor was leaving to meet Achilles in the battlefield, Helen stopped him and said, \"Hektor, beware unexpected aid. The gods love Achilles and will play tricks on anyone who wishes him harm.\" Hektor nodded his acknowledgement and smiled his gratitude, and Andromache could tell that it pained Kassandra that he should heed Helen's warnings, but refused to believe his own sister. But it did not make a difference, in the end. - V. Greeks Bearing Gifts. When the wooden horse was brought inside the city, Kassandra found Astyanax and went looking for Andromache, who was still in mourning for Hektor. Finding her, she thrust the child at her, and said, \"It won't be long now, Andromache. You should leave. Find Polyxena and take her with you.\" \"Where will I go?\" Andromache asked. \"Hide in one of the villages along Mount Ida and wait till the Greeks have left. And then travel to the sanctuary of Apollo near Thebe.\" Andromache came out of her daze long enough to look at her with doubt, \"The Greeks have left already, Kassandra. What do you see now?\" Kassandra shook her head and pushed her towards the door. \"Find Polyxena. And go.\" \"Come with us!\" \"I cannot. I need to warn others.\" \"No one would believe you.\" \"You do.\" And for now, Kassandra felt that that was enough. She felt compelled to save Andromache, save something of Troy, and while she hoped to convince others, she needed to know that Andromache was safe, that she would take care of Astyanax and Polyxena. Andromache nodded and embraced her, and Kassandra drew strength from that before she went looking for Helen in the women's quarters. She had not been given the luxury to mourn the death of her husband, and Priam had insisted on her taking another Trojan prince as a consort. Helen was hard to comfort and harder to read, but she had no doubt that she could trust Helen with this and that Helen would believe her. So Helen came with her to the Wooden Horse, and together, they both moved about it silently, feeling every nook and flank that could hide secrets. And finally, Helen held a finger to her lips and motioned Kassandra away. And she spoke softly but loud enough that her voice would carry towards anyone hiding inside the horse. \"Agamemnon?\" She called out first, imitating the voice of her sister Klytemnestra. And spoke gently in Greek with words that Kassandra could only half understand. Not hearing a reply, she called out to Odysseus next, in the voice of Penelope, and Kassandra watched as Helen slipped from one persona to another, and beneath her perfect imitation of other men's desires, Kassandra sensed Helen's longing for home, for her sister and her kinswomen. She hesitated before finally calling out to Menelaus, using her own voice, and somehow, this bit of honesty took more out of her than all the easy mimicry had. She shook her head slightly and turned away. Kassandra sensed movement inside, but she did not need that confirmation to know what lurked inside. No one came out, and Helen could not convince them to give up their secret. --- Andromache was brought back to the women's camps after the fall, when Kassandra had already imagined her safely away. She was covered in blood and ashes and alone. She did not speak, and Kassandra feared that she already knew what she would say. Kassandra reached over to take Andromache in her arms, but Andromache grasped Kassandra's hands and pulled her into an embrace. She could not let Kassandra comfort her now; she had her sorrows now, but Kassandra had lived with this since Paris' birth, and she could not understand how she had survived this when Andromache did not think she could live much longer with all these deaths. Andromache had known that the Greeks would never forgive Polyxena for betraying Achilles, for being able to do what none of the warriors of Troy had been able to, for leading Achilles to his death. The threat she presented outweighed her value as a war prize, but Astyanax had only been a child and could have been molded into anything. But even so, she knew that she would have raised him with one purpose only. They waited long enough to bring them food or water that when it was brought in, few women refused it. While the other women drank their water, Andromache watched Helen soak the ends of her tattered robes into her cup and use the damp cloth to wipe away the soot on her face, her arms, and her breasts. She dipped her fingers into it to smooth her wayward hair, and let just enough water pass through her parched lips to moisten them. Andromache turned away from her, unable to make out her actions, but fearing that she knew. Kassandra followed her gaze, but did not turn away and said, \"This war made Hektor into what he became, just as it has shaped Helen. This is the only way she'll survive, and Helen will always find a way to survive.\" And this, Andromache could not understand. It was this that she held Helen most in contempt for: that Helen could live, should want to live, having lost everything. If death were offered to her instead, she would've willingly traded places with Helen under Menelaus' sword or even with Polyxena on Achilles' tomb. - VI. Mycenae Kassandra saw the death of Agamemnon before leaving Troy, and it was a comfort to know that she would not have to endure this for too long. This was the first, the only vision, that she welcomed, and having lost everything, she felt the weight of the curse lift. She could not tell if this lack of visions of the future meant an end to her life or an end to the curse. She felt the presence of Apollo again only after arriving in Mycenae, in a place filled with transgressions and hubris. Agamemnon could not be bothered with finding a place for her once he arrived inside his city to find his wife still faithful, loving, and as lovely as ever, and more humble than he remembered. A wiser man would have found that reason to doubt her words, but Agamemnon fell easily into the net Klytemnestra had set for him. Klytemnestra lingered outside after Agamemnon went in, and approached Kassandra as she reached for something inside the folds of her flowing peplos. She spoke carefully so that Kassandra would understand her, \"How was Helen when you last saw her?\" \"Alive,\" Kassandra said. \"Menelaus could not kill her.\" Klytemnestra smiled, \"I never thought he would. But I have had no news of her in so long.\" When Kassandra did not reply, Klytemnestra asked, \"Will I see my sister again?\" \"I'm not a fortune teller, nor a proper oracle. I see what Apollo shows me.\" \"So you still have his gift?\" Klytemnestra asked, and Kassandra understood the purpose of these questions. To be sure, Klytemnestra was worried about her sister, but she was also worried about the success of what she had planned for Agamemnon. Kassandra nodded, and watched as Klytemnestra took out a gleaming knife from the folds of her clothes. Klytemnestra regarded her with thought, her fingers still tightly wound around the knife. \"Tell me,\" she asked, \"Have you given Agamemnon hints to his fate?\" \"You could not wish him harm more than I do. He killed your Iphigenia, but he destroyed all of my people.\" \"We have a common goal, then,\" said Klytemnestra. \"But I also know his powers of persuasion, and know that it is easy to love him, if he puts his mind to convincing you. I do not wish to harm you.\" Kassandra nodded, \"I understand. I do not begrudge you this. Rather you than him. Rather death than life as Agamemnon's slave.\" And Klytemnestra regarded her with respect in her eyes, her right hand still tightly wound around the knife as her left played with its blade lightly. Finally, she smiled and took the blade of the knife in her left hand and extended it towards Kassandra with the blunt end first, offering it to her. \"Aegisthus will want to make sure that any threats are eliminated after I take care of Agamemnon,\" Klytemnestra said, as if in apology. \"And he will see you as a threat.\" And Kassandra did not know if the knife was supposed to offer protection against Aegisthus or offer another way out, but for once, she felt like she had a choice. She knew that she would not die by Klytemnestra's hand, so she took the knife and held on to it. \"Now,\" Klytemnestra said, \"there are spirits that need appeasing, and I have waited for this too long.\" Kassandra sensed the warning in the words as Klytemnestra turned away from her and walked inside the lion gates of Mycenae. Kassandra's hands played with the knife as she watched her go, and she did not wait to hear Agamemnon's death throes. -end-",

      "Finding her, she thrust the child at her, and said, \"It won't be long now, Andromache.",
      "You should leave.",
      "Find Polyxena and take her with you.\"",
      "\"Where will I go?\" Andromache asked.",
      "\"Hide in one of the villages along Mount Ida and wait till the Greeks have left.",
      "And then travel to the sanctuary of Apollo near Thebe.\"",
      "Andromache came out of her daze long enough to look at her with doubt, \"The Greeks have left already, Kassandra.",
      "What do you see now?\" Kassandra shook her head and pushed her towards the door.",
      "\"Find Polyxena.",
      "And go.\"",
      "\"Come with us!\"",
      "\"I cannot.",
      "I need to warn others.\"",
      "\"No one would believe you.\"",
      "\"You do.\"",
      "And for now, Kassandra felt that that was enough.",
      "She felt compelled to save Andromache, save something of Troy, and while she hoped to convince others, she needed to know that Andromache was safe, that she would take care of Astyanax and Polyxena.",
      "Andromache nodded and embraced her, and Kassandra drew strength from that before she went looking for Helen in the women's quarters.",
      "She had not been given the luxury to mourn the death of her husband, and Priam had insisted on her taking another Trojan prince as a consort.",
      "Helen was hard to comfort and harder to read, but she had no doubt that she could trust Helen with this and that Helen would believe her.",
      "So Helen came with her to the Wooden Horse, and together, they both moved about it silently, feeling every nook and flank that could hide secrets.",
      "And finally, Helen held a finger to her lips and motioned Kassandra away.",
      "And she spoke softly but loud enough that her voice would carry towards anyone hiding inside the horse.",
      "\"Agamemnon?\"",
      "She called out first, imitating the voice of her sister Klytemnestra.",
      "And spoke gently in Greek with words that Kassandra could only half understand.",
      "Not hearing a reply, she called out to Odysseus next, in the voice of Penelope, and Kassandra watched as Helen slipped from one persona to another, and beneath her perfect imitation of other men's desires, Kassandra sensed Helen's longing for home, for her sister and her kinswomen.",
      "She hesitated before finally calling out to Menelaus, using her own voice, and somehow, this bit of honesty took more out of her than all the easy mimicry had.",
      "She shook her head slightly and turned away.",
      "Kassandra sensed movement inside, but she did not need that confirmation to know what lurked inside.",
      "No one came out, and Helen could not convince them to give up their secret.",
      "--- Andromache was brought back to the women's camps after the fall, when Kassandra had already imagined her safely away.",
      "She was covered in blood and ashes and alone.",
      "She did not speak, and Kassandra feared that she already knew what she would say.",
      "Kassandra reached over to take Andromache in her arms, but Andromache grasped Kassandra's hands and pulled her into an embrace.",
      "She could not let Kassandra comfort her now; she had her sorrows now, but Kassandra had lived with this since Paris' birth, and she could not understand how she had survived this when Andromache did not think she could live much longer with all these deaths.",
      "Andromache had known that the Greeks would never forgive Polyxena for betraying Achilles, for being able to do what none of the warriors of Troy had been able to, for leading Achilles to his death.",
      "The threat she presented outweighed her value as a war prize, but Astyanax had only been a child and could have been molded into anything.",
      "But even so, she knew that she would have raised him with one purpose only.",
      "They waited long enough to bring them food or water that when it was brought in, few women refused it.",
      "While the other women drank their water, Andromache watched Helen soak the ends of her tattered robes into her cup and use the damp cloth to wipe away the soot on her face, her arms, and her breasts.",
      "She dipped her fingers into it to smooth her wayward hair, and let just enough water pass through her parched lips to moisten them.",
      "Andromache turned away from her, unable to make out her actions, but fearing that she knew.",
      "Kassandra followed her gaze, but did not turn away and said, \"This war made Hektor into what he became, just as it has shaped Helen.",
      "This is the only way she'll survive, and Helen will always find a way to survive.\"",
      "And this, Andromache could not understand.",
      "It was this that she held Helen most in contempt for: that Helen could live, should want to live, having lost everything.",
      "If death were offered to her instead, she would've willingly traded places with Helen under Menelaus' sword or even with Polyxena on Achilles' tomb.",
      "- VI.",
      "Mycenae Kassandra saw the death of Agamemnon before leaving Troy, and it was a comfort to know that she would not have to endure this for too long.",
      "This was the first, the only vision, that she welcomed, and having lost everything, she felt the weight of the curse lift.",
      "She could not tell if this lack of visions of the future meant an end to her life or an end to the curse.",
      "She felt the presence of Apollo again only after arriving in Mycenae, in a place filled with transgressions and hubris.",
      "Agamemnon could not be bothered with finding a place for her once he arrived inside his city to find his wife still faithful, loving, and as lovely as ever, and more humble than he remembered.",
      "A wiser man would have found that reason to doubt her words, but Agamemnon fell easily into the net Klytemnestra had set for him.",
      "Klytemnestra lingered outside after Agamemnon went in, and approached Kassandra as she reached for something inside the folds of her flowing peplos.",
      "She spoke carefully so that Kassandra would understand her, \"How was Helen when you last saw her?\" \"Alive,\" Kassandra said.",
      "\"Menelaus could not kill her.\"",
      "Klytemnestra smiled, \"I never thought he would.",
      "But I have had no news of her in so long.\"",
      "When Kassandra did not reply, Klytemnestra asked, \"Will I see my sister again?\"",
      "\"I'm not a fortune teller, nor a proper oracle.",
      "I see what Apollo shows me.\"",
      "\"So you still have his gift?\" Klytemnestra asked, and Kassandra understood the purpose of these questions.",
      "To be sure, Klytemnestra was worried about her sister, but she was also worried about the success of what she had planned for Agamemnon.",
      "Kassandra nodded, and watched as Klytemnestra took out a gleaming knife from the folds of her clothes.",
      "Klytemnestra regarded her with thought, her fingers still tightly wound around the knife.",
      "\"Tell me,\" she asked, \"Have you given Agamemnon hints to his fate?\"",
      "\"You could not wish him harm more than I do.",
      "He killed your Iphigenia, but he destroyed all of my people.\"",
      "\"We have a common goal, then,\" said Klytemnestra.",
      "\"But I also know his powers of persuasion, and know that it is easy to love him, if he puts his mind to convincing you.",
      "I do not wish to harm you.\"",
      "Kassandra nodded, \"I understand.",
      "I do not begrudge you this.",
      "Rather you than him.",
      "Rather death than life as Agamemnon's slave.\"",
      "And Klytemnestra regarded her with respect in her eyes, her right hand still tightly wound around the knife as her left played with its blade lightly.",
      "Finally, she smiled and took the blade of the knife in her left hand and extended it towards Kassandra with the blunt end first, offering it to her.",
      "\"Aegisthus will want to make sure that any threats are eliminated after I take care of Agamemnon,\" Klytemnestra said, as if in apology.",
      "\"And he will see you as a threat.\"",
      "And Kassandra did not know if the knife was supposed to offer protection against Aegisthus or offer another way out, but for once, she felt like she had a choice.",
      "She knew that she would not die by Klytemnestra's hand, so she took the knife and held on to it.",
      "\"Now,\" Klytemnestra said, \"there are spirits that need appeasing, and I have waited for this too long.\"",
      "Kassandra sensed the warning in the words as Klytemnestra turned away from her and walked inside the lion gates of Mycenae.",
      "Kassandra's hands played with the knife as she watched her go, and she did not wait to hear Agamemnon's death throes.",

    "text": "\"Are you really going like that?\" Venus asked. She pouted dramatically at the mirror, then reached for a tissue to blot her lipstick. \"Oh, honestly, Minnie, no wonder you don't have a date for the formal.\" \"Don't call me Minnie,\" Mina snapped. \"There's nothing wrong with the way I'm dressed. And oh, wait, who's your date to the formal again? No, don't tell me, I know this one! Isn't it that stuttering engineering major? You're going to have a great time dancing the night away.\" Venus flushed despite herself. \"Daddy wants me to go with him, all right? It wasn't my idea,\" she said defensively. \"He's not your father,\" Mina said nastily. \"He's mine. Just because he was married to your stupid whore mother for a year-long fit of temporary insanity doesn't make you part of our family.\" \"Girls, girls,\" tutted a low voice from the doorway. \"I would hate to think that the sisters of Omicron Lambda Upsilon can't get along even on the night of our biggest social event of the year.\" \"Fuck off, June,\" Mina sighed. \"We'll be down in a minute.\" \"Since you're going to be running the ticket table, you'd better,\" June sniffed, and went her way in a cloud of expensive French perfume. Venus and Mina stared after her, momentarily united in antipathy. \"I can't believe Dad goes out with her,\" Mina said at last. \"Ugh, don't remind me,\" Venus muttered. \"I never thought I'd say this but I wish he'd stayed with that lunatic English professor with nine kids.\" \"God, no,\" Mina said absent-mindedly, pushing past Venus at the mirror to grab a hairbrush. \"I was afraid he was going to marry her. One stepsister is bad enough.\" \"Thanks,\" Venus said. \"I feel really special now.\" \"Oh gosh, sorry if I'm not terribly concerned. I doubt anything I say could so much as scratch the Teflon coating on your enormous ego.\" Mina finished brushing her hair and pulled one of the elastic bands off the hairbrush handle. \"Come on, I'm almost done, we need to get downstairs.\" \"Are you - oh, for God's sake, give me that,\" Venus snapped, and yanked the elastic out of Mina's hands. In less than five minutes Mina's hair was pinned up and Venus was putting the finishing touches on her makeup, ignoring Mina's clearly specious complaints. \"There. Now at least I won't be embarrassed to sit next to you. I know Daddy offered to get you contacts, too, so why you insist on wearing those awful glasses - \" \"I like my glasses,\" Mina said stiffly. \"Not that it's any of your business. Now can we go already? June's going to blow a gasket.\" \"Oh, fuck June,\" Venus said, but she snatched her clutch up from her bed and walked out the door without looking back to see if Mina was following her. * June was too busy micro-managing the decorations in the hall downstairs to do more than hiss, \"What took you so long?\" Unfortunately, the ticket table was already set up, so between that and June's lack of attention Mina and Venus were left with nothing to distract them but each other until people started filtering in. Mina counted the singles in the cash box five times in icy silence and smiled so widely at the first man who came up to buy a ticket that he nearly ran back out the door. Selling tickets kept them busy for half an hour or so, and then, the glorious moment for which Mina had been waiting finally arrived. \"Oh, look,\" she said sweetly. \"Your date is here.\" \"At least I have one,\" Venus snapped, but it was a weak retort and they both knew it. The young man in question made his way up to their table, blissfully unaware of the abject humiliation and petty satisfaction that his approach was inspiring in his date and her step-sister, respectively. \"H-hello,\" he stammered, once he was close enough that Venus couldn't keep up the pretense of failing to notice him. \"You m-must be V-V-\" \"Venus,\" Venus said. \"Like the tennis player. This is my sister, Minnie. As in Mouse.\" \"Step-sister,\" Mina corrected, more out of habit than active vitriol. She might be about to spend the majority of the OLY formal getting drunk on her own at the bar, but at least she wouldn't have to make conversation with an engineering major. It was hard to get particularly worked up at Venus under the circumstances. \"Have a lovely time,\" she added, gestured for a couple of the freshers to take over at the ticket table, and beat a strategic retreat to the open bar, where she would have unlimited access to free alcohol and a good vantage point from which to observe the inevitable social trainwreck. * \"Well, that's just... fascinating,\" Venus said, smiling weakly. The engineering student's stutter hadn't seemed to impede him from rambling on about fluid mechanics (whatever that meant) for forty minutes straight. \"I'm just going to - Daddy!\" \"How's my pretty girl?\" he boomed, dislodging June's possessive grip on his arm so he could swoop in to claim a kiss as his god-given right. \"I'm great!\" Venus beamed at him, her pleasure equal parts genuine and spiteful. No matter what June did or how well she thought she'd snared him, Venus would always be her Daddy's pretty girl. \"What are you doing here, Daddy?\" \"I had to check up on my girls, didn't I?\" He patted June on the shoulder, a little like he might have petted a dog. June kept her head up, but Venus could see the faint flush on her cheeks. \"I didn't want my Junebug to organize a party and then have no one to dance with, after all. Not that you have to worry about that, of course! This fellow is showing you a good time, right?\" The engineering major stumbled at the force of his clap on the back. \"Oh, yes,\" Venus agreed. He didn't notice her lack of enthusiasm, but then, he wasn't a particularly subtle man. \"Good, good! I'm glad. June thought he'd be a good match for you, not like those meathead football players you're always going with.\" \"June thought?\" Venus repeated dangerously. June smiled at her, poisonously sweet. \"And aren't you glad I did?\" she purred. \"Well, I'm just going to go powder my nose,\" she added, and stood on tip-toe to press a kiss to his cheek. Venus didn't even know what excuse she made to follow after her, but it wasn't like either her stepfather or her date could tell an implausible social fiction from a hole in the ground. \"You told Daddy to have that - that - \" she hissed when she caught up to June, right outside the ladies room. June looked smugly superior as she pushed the door open and left Venus choking for words in her wake. \"I would have hated to see you dateless at our biggest social event of the year, darling. Really, all I did was make a tiny suggestion that no one had asked you and he should have one of his students take you. You know how your father worries about you.\" Venus wanted very badly to scream, but there were other girls in the bathroom, and appearances had to be maintained. \"You know,\" she said, \"some people might see your dating a man more than twice your age as some sort of... Freudian cry for help. Something to do with a lack of male authority figures in your childhood.\" \"Oh, but darling,\" June said as she reapplied her lipstick, seemingly unconcerned, \"I'm sure some people would say the same about your prurient interest in your stepfather's sex life. Isn't it good that we both know better? I'm sure you're not really jealous, no matter what it would look like to a stranger. Or, well...\" She drew out her hesitation beautifully; Venus was grudgingly impressed. \"I hope so, anyway. I would really hate for it to be awkward if I ended up being your stepmother some day.\" \"I'm sure you would,\" Venus managed from between gritted teeth, and let June lead the way back into the hall. She'd already lost the battle; it would have been pointless to pretend otherwise. Venus' date was waiting right outside with a glass of champagne, which she knocked back with unseemly haste. Their father had found Mina at the bar - they were probably sharing a Scotch and talking about some obscure mathematical theorem, Venus thought bitterly; of course it was fine if his clever girl didn't have a date to the formal - and June went to retrieve him without a backwards glance. \"W-w-would you like t-to d-dance?\" the hapless engineering major asked. Venus liberated another flute of champagne from a passing waiter and handed it back to him, empty, before he had time to move out of arm's reach. \"Sure,\" she muttered. \"Why not. Don't step on my feet.\" * \"Buzz off, twerp,\" Mina said, as the third idiot fresher in fifteen minutes started to ask if he could get her a drink. She'd known it was a mistake to let Venus put makeup on her, she thought irritably. It just seemed to give people ideas that she was actually interested in trading her time and attention for free alcohol. It was an open bar, for god's sake; the alcohol was already free. At least her father and June had left, so she didn't have to drink to counteract the nauseating sight of June fawning over his every word like she didn't have a single original thought in her head. You took the small victories where you found them, she reflected, and looked up from her nearly-finished Scotch just in time to see Venus slap her date full across the face in the middle of the dance floor and burst into tears. \"Hey, asshole, back off,\" she snapped, shoving in between him and Venus. She didn't even remember how she'd gotten across the room. \"What's wrong? Did he hurt you? Come on, we can - no, seriously, jackass, back off.\" The engineering major was gabbling out apologies as fast as his stutter would let him, but Venus was crying too hard to say anything, so Mina wrapped an arm around her shoulders and herded her out of the hall before any more of a fuss could be raised. \"Okay, okay, come on, whatever it was it couldn't have been that bad. Stop crying already, your eyeliner's running and you look like a raccoon.\" \"He said - Daddy said - \" Venus hiccuped. Well, that would do it. \"Look,\" Mina started, then sighed. She kept Venus moving up the stairs toward their room while she worked out what to say. \"Look, Dad is a really shitty parent,\" she finally settled on. \"He means well but he is just crap at it. I'm sure whatever it was, he didn't mean it the way it sounded.\" \"That - that Special Olympics reject put his hand on my ass,\" Venus hissed, swiping angrily at her eyes. \"And when I told him to move it or lose it he said Daddy said I'd put out for him.\" \"Um,\" Mina said. \"Yeah, that's. Pretty much impossible to misinterpret.\" They had finally arrived at their room. Mina opened the door and let Venus storm inside ahead of her. \"It's not fair,\" Venus ranted. At least she had stopped crying. Mina wasn't used to feeling sorry for Venus, and she didn't like the feeling much. \"Just because I'm not - not clever, or - I'm not a goddamned whore!\" \"Nobody thinks you're a whore.\" Mina locked the door behind her, and jumped when she turned around to find Venus standing alarmingly close. \"Daddy tried to pimp me out to one of his students,\" Venus said, her eyes shining crazily. \"I am a goddamned free woman and I will sleep with who I fucking want - \" \"Yes, yes, okay - \" Mina tried to say, and was cut off when Venus grabbed her face and smashed their mouths together. It was initially the least sexy kiss Mina had ever had. She didn't know who Venus was really kissing - please god that it wasn't Dad - but it wasn't her. Venus kept at it, though, and after a minute she gave up on kissing angrily and just made out, and that was - well, Venus had had a lot of practice kissing. She was good at it. \"Wait, wait,\" Mina managed, pulling back. Venus glared and tried to pull her head down again, but Mina was a lot stronger than she was and the element of surprise had been well and truly lost. \"Are we doing this because you actually want to have sex with me, or because you want to get back at Dad?\" \"Can't it be both?\" Venus asked. Mina hesitated, and she added, \"Look, you're the one who's always going on about how I'm not really your sister. It's not like it's illegal or anything.\" \"That's a really great pickup line. Hey baby, we wouldn't be breaking any state or federal laws if we went to bed together,\" Mina snorted. Venus rolled her eyes. \"But yeah, whatever, okay.\" Venus looked mildly surprised. \"Really?\" \"What, did you change your mind?\" \"No, I just didn't expect... I mean - \" at which point Mina lost her patience and kissed Venus again. It was more fun than she'd expected - kissing Venus, getting her over to the bed, peeling her out of her fancy dress. They'd probably never gotten along so well in their lives, not since the day Venus and her mother had moved in with Mina and her Dad, when Venus had taken one of Mina's books without permission and Mina had ripped the head off of Venus' favorite doll to make her cry. \"Hang on,\" she panted, sliding off of Venus' mostly-naked body; Venus just laughed and reached up to unhook Mina's bra. Mina shrugged the straps off her shoulders but swatted Venus' hands away when she tried to cup her breasts. \"No, seriously, hang on. Do you have a preference?\" she added, rummaging in her bedside drawer. \"Not the purple one, that's my favorite, but we can use whatever else you want.\" Venus leaned over her shoulder, her breath warm and distracting in Mina's ear. \"Mina, you've been holding out on me,\" she said, almost admiring, as she examined the contents of Mina's collection. \"Some of us don't like to depend on the unreliable interests of men to supply our need for dick,\" Mina said, and ducked when Venus tried to hit her in the face with a vibrator. Then Venus apparently realized that a vibrator had a somewhat obvious use when in bed with another naked girl, and let retaliation go in favor of more collaborative activities. * \"Do you think Diana's relationship with her brother is kind of creepy and incestuous?\" Venus mused out loud. \"Seriously, it's really weird that she took him to the formal.\" Mina opened one eye but remained otherwise limply flopped out on the bed. \"A, you just had sex with your step-sister. Glass houses, stones. B, this is your idea of pillow-talk?\" \"I'm just saying,\" Venus said, comfortably. \"She never dates. He's always in her room. It's kind of suspicious.\" \"Why are you telling me this,\" Mina mumbled into her pillow. Venus stretched lazily, and took a certain amount of personal satisfaction in the fact that Mina rolled over to watch. \"Well, you're on the lacrosse team with her. You would know, wouldn't you?\" \"I can assure you that I have never seen any proof in the lacrosse team's locker room that Diana's been fucking her twin brother in there,\" Mina said. \"Jesus Christ, go to sleep. You just got off three times, what more does it take?\" Venus hummed a little and snuggled down beside Mina, despite the sweat covering them both. \"Oh, Minnie, by the way. I hope you know this doesn't change anything,\" she said, in between yawns. \"I'm still going to beat your ass out on the Paris Fellowship application.\" \"Yeah, we'll see about that,\" Mina muttered. Venus pressed an absent-minded kiss to her collarbone. Mina's breasts made for an amazing pillow, she thought, and slipped easily into sleep.",

      "\"Since you're going to be running the ticket table, you'd better,\" June sniffed, and went her way in a cloud of expensive French perfume.",
      "Venus and Mina stared after her, momentarily united in antipathy.",
      "\"I can't believe Dad goes out with her,\" Mina said at last.",
      "\"Ugh, don't remind me,\" Venus muttered.",
      "\"I never thought I'd say this but I wish he'd stayed with that lunatic English professor with nine kids.\"",
      "\"God, no,\" Mina said absent-mindedly, pushing past Venus at the mirror to grab a hairbrush.",
      "\"I was afraid he was going to marry her.",
      "One stepsister is bad enough.\"",
      "\"Thanks,\" Venus said.",
      "\"I feel really special now.\"",
      "\"Oh gosh, sorry if I'm not terribly concerned.",
      "I doubt anything I say could so much as scratch the Teflon coating on your enormous ego.\"",
      "Mina finished brushing her hair and pulled one of the elastic bands off the hairbrush handle.",
      "\"Come on, I'm almost done, we need to get downstairs.\"",
      "\"Are you - oh, for God's sake, give me that,\" Venus snapped, and yanked the elastic out of Mina's hands.",
      "In less than five minutes Mina's hair was pinned up and Venus was putting the finishing touches on her makeup, ignoring Mina's clearly specious complaints.",
      "\"There.",
      "Now at least I won't be embarrassed to sit next to you.",
      "I know Daddy offered to get you contacts, too, so why you insist on wearing those awful glasses - \" \"I like my glasses,\" Mina said stiffly.",
      "\"Not that it's any of your business.",
      "Now can we go already?",
      "June's going to blow a gasket.\"",
      "\"Oh, fuck June,\" Venus said, but she snatched her clutch up from her bed and walked out the door without looking back to see if Mina was following her.",
      "* June was too busy micro-managing the decorations in the hall downstairs to do more than hiss, \"What took you so long?\"",
      "Unfortunately, the ticket table was already set up, so between that and June's lack of attention Mina and Venus were left with nothing to distract them but each other until people started filtering in.",
      "Mina counted the singles in the cash box five times in icy silence and smiled so widely at the first man who came up to buy a ticket that he nearly ran back out the door.",
      "Selling tickets kept them busy for half an hour or so, and then, the glorious moment for which Mina had been waiting finally arrived.",
      "\"Oh, look,\" she said sweetly.",
      "\"Your date is here.\"",
      "\"At least I have one,\" Venus snapped, but it was a weak retort and they both knew it.",
      "The young man in question made his way up to their table, blissfully unaware of the abject humiliation and petty satisfaction that his approach was inspiring in his date and her step-sister, respectively.",
      "\"H-hello,\" he stammered, once he was close enough that Venus couldn't keep up the pretense of failing to notice him.",
      "\"You m-must be V-V-\" \"Venus,\" Venus said.",
      "\"Like the tennis player.",
      "This is my sister, Minnie.",
      "As in Mouse.\"",
      "\"Step-sister,\" Mina corrected, more out of habit than active vitriol.",
      "She might be about to spend the majority of the OLY formal getting drunk on her own at the bar, but at least she wouldn't have to make conversation with an engineering major.",
      "It was hard to get particularly worked up at Venus under the circumstances.",
      "\"Have a lovely time,\" she added, gestured for a couple of the freshers to take over at the ticket table, and beat a strategic retreat to the open bar, where she would have unlimited access to free alcohol and a good vantage point from which to observe the inevitable social trainwreck.",
      "* \"Well, that's just... fascinating,\" Venus said, smiling weakly.",
      "The engineering student's stutter hadn't seemed to impede him from rambling on about fluid mechanics (whatever that meant) for forty minutes straight.",
      "\"I'm just going to - Daddy!\"",
      "\"How's my pretty girl?\" he boomed, dislodging June's possessive grip on his arm so he could swoop in to claim a kiss as his god-given right.",
      "\"I'm great!\"",
      "Venus beamed at him, her pleasure equal parts genuine and spiteful.",
      "No matter what June did or how well she thought she'd snared him, Venus would always be her Daddy's pretty girl.",
      "\"What are you doing here, Daddy?\"",
      "\"I had to check up on my girls, didn't I?\"",
      "He patted June on the shoulder, a little like he might have petted a dog.",
      "June kept her head up, but Venus could see the faint flush on her cheeks.",
      "\"I didn't want my Junebug to organize a party and then have no one to dance with, after all.",
      "Not that you have to worry about that, of course!",
      "This fellow is showing you a good time, right?\"",
      "The engineering major stumbled at the force of his clap on the back.",
      "\"Oh, yes,\" Venus agreed.",
      "He didn't notice her lack of enthusiasm, but then, he wasn't a particularly subtle man.",
      "\"Good, good!",
      "I'm glad.",
      "June thought he'd be a good match for you, not like those meathead football players you're always going with.\"",
      "\"June thought?\" Venus repeated dangerously.",
      "June smiled at her, poisonously sweet.",
      "\"And aren't you glad I did?\" she purred.",
      "\"Well, I'm just going to go powder my nose,\" she added, and stood on tip-toe to press a kiss to his cheek.",
      "Venus didn't even know what excuse she made to follow after her, but it wasn't like either her stepfather or her date could tell an implausible social fiction from a hole in the ground.",
      "\"You told Daddy to have that - that - \" she hissed when she caught up to June, right outside the ladies room.",
      "June looked smugly superior as she pushed the door open and left Venus choking for words in her wake.",
      "\"I would have hated to see you dateless at our biggest social event of the year, darling.",
      "Really, all I did was make a tiny suggestion that no one had asked you and he should have one of his students take you.",
      "You know how your father worries about you.\"",
      "Venus wanted very badly to scream, but there were other girls in the bathroom, and appearances had to be maintained.",
      "\"You know,\" she said, \"some people might see your dating a man more than twice your age as some sort of...",
      "Freudian cry for help.",
      "Something to do with a lack of male authority figures in your childhood.\"",
      "\"Oh, but darling,\" June said as she reapplied her lipstick, seemingly unconcerned, \"I'm sure some people would say the same about your prurient interest in your stepfather's sex life.",
      "Isn't it good that we both know better?",
      "I'm sure you're not really jealous, no matter what it would look like to a stranger.",
      "Or, well...\" She drew out her hesitation beautifully; Venus was grudgingly impressed.",
      "\"I hope so, anyway.",
      "I would really hate for it to be awkward if I ended up being your stepmother some day.\"",
      "\"I'm sure you would,\" Venus managed from between gritted teeth, and let June lead the way back into the hall.",
      "She'd already lost the battle; it would have been pointless to pretend otherwise.",
      "Venus' date was waiting right outside with a glass of champagne, which she knocked back with unseemly haste.",
      "Their father had found Mina at the bar - they were probably sharing a Scotch and talking about some obscure mathematical theorem, Venus thought bitterly; of course it was fine if his clever girl didn't have a date to the formal - and June went to retrieve him without a backwards glance.",
      "\"W-w-would you like t-to d-dance?\" the hapless engineering major asked.",
      "Venus liberated another flute of champagne from a passing waiter and handed it back to him, empty, before he had time to move out of arm's reach.",
      "\"Sure,\" she muttered.",
      "\"Why not.",
      "Don't step on my feet.\"",
      "* \"Buzz off, twerp,\" Mina said, as the third idiot fresher in fifteen minutes started to ask if he could get her a drink.",
      "She'd known it was a mistake to let Venus put makeup on her, she thought irritably.",
      "It just seemed to give people ideas that she was actually interested in trading her time and attention for free alcohol.",
      "It was an open bar, for god's sake; the alcohol was already free.",
      "At least her father and June had left, so she didn't have to drink to counteract the nauseating sight of June fawning over his every word like she didn't have a single original thought in her head.",
      "You took the small victories where you found them, she reflected, and looked up from her nearly-finished Scotch just in time to see Venus slap her date full across the face in the middle of the dance floor and burst into tears.",
      "\"Hey, asshole, back off,\" she snapped, shoving in between him and Venus.",
      "She didn't even remember how she'd gotten across the room.",
      "\"What's wrong?",
      "Did he hurt you?",
      "Come on, we can - no, seriously, jackass, back off.\"",
      "The engineering major was gabbling out apologies as fast as his stutter would let him, but Venus was crying too hard to say anything, so Mina wrapped an arm around her shoulders and herded her out of the hall before any more of a fuss could be raised.",
      "\"Okay, okay, come on, whatever it was it couldn't have been that bad.",
      "Stop crying already, your eyeliner's running and you look like a raccoon.\"",
      "\"He said - Daddy said - \" Venus hiccuped.",
      "Well, that would do it.",
      "\"Look,\" Mina started, then sighed.",
      "She kept Venus moving up the stairs toward their room while she worked out what to say.",
      "\"Look, Dad is a really shitty parent,\" she finally settled on.",
      "\"He means well but he is just crap at it.",
      "I'm sure whatever it was, he didn't mean it the way it sounded.\"",
      "\"That - that Special Olympics reject put his hand on my ass,\" Venus hissed, swiping angrily at her eyes.",
      "\"And when I told him to move it or lose it he said Daddy said I'd put out for him.\"",
      "\"Um,\" Mina said.",
      "\"Yeah, that's.",
      "Pretty much impossible to misinterpret.\"",
      "They had finally arrived at their room.",
      "Mina opened the door and let Venus storm inside ahead of her.",
      "\"It's not fair,\" Venus ranted.",
      "At least she had stopped crying.",
      "Mina wasn't used to feeling sorry for Venus, and she didn't like the feeling much.",
      "\"Just because I'm not - not clever, or - I'm not a goddamned whore!\"",
      "\"Nobody thinks you're a whore.\"",
      "Mina locked the door behind her, and jumped when she turned around to find Venus standing alarmingly close.",
      "\"Daddy tried to pimp me out to one of his students,\" Venus said, her eyes shining crazily.",
      "\"I am a goddamned free woman and I will sleep with who I fucking want - \" \"Yes, yes, okay - \" Mina tried to say, and was cut off when Venus grabbed her face and smashed their mouths together.",
      "It was initially the least sexy kiss Mina had ever had.",
      "She didn't know who Venus was really kissing - please god that it wasn't Dad - but it wasn't her.",
      "Venus kept at it, though, and after a minute she gave up on kissing angrily and just made out, and that was - well, Venus had had a lot of practice kissing.",
      "She was good at it.",
      "\"Wait, wait,\" Mina managed, pulling back.",
      "Venus glared and tried to pull her head down again, but Mina was a lot stronger than she was and the element of surprise had been well and truly lost.",
      "\"Are we doing this because you actually want to have sex with me, or because you want to get back at Dad?\" \"Can't it be both?\" Venus asked.",
      "Mina hesitated, and she added, \"Look, you're the one who's always going on about how I'm not really your sister.",
      "It's not like it's illegal or anything.\"",
      "\"That's a really great pickup line.",
      "Hey baby, we wouldn't be breaking any state or federal laws if we went to bed together,\" Mina snorted.",
      "Venus rolled her eyes.",
      "\"But yeah, whatever, okay.\"",
      "Venus looked mildly surprised.",
      "\"Really?\" \"What, did you change your mind?\"",
      "\"No, I just didn't expect...",
      "I mean - \" at which point Mina lost her patience and kissed Venus again.",
      "It was more fun than she'd expected - kissing Venus, getting her over to the bed, peeling her out of her fancy dress.",
      "They'd probably never gotten along so well in their lives, not since the day Venus and her mother had moved in with Mina and her Dad, when Venus had taken one of Mina's books without permission and Mina had ripped the head off of Venus' favorite doll to make her cry.",
      "\"Hang on,\" she panted, sliding off of Venus' mostly-naked body; Venus just laughed and reached up to unhook Mina's bra.",
      "Mina shrugged the straps off her shoulders but swatted Venus' hands away when she tried to cup her breasts.",
      "\"No, seriously, hang on.",
      "Do you have a preference?\" she added, rummaging in her bedside drawer.",
      "\"Not the purple one, that's my favorite, but we can use whatever else you want.\"",
      "Venus leaned over her shoulder, her breath warm and distracting in Mina's ear.",
      "\"Mina, you've been holding out on me,\" she said, almost admiring, as she examined the contents of Mina's collection.",
      "\"Some of us don't like to depend on the unreliable interests of men to supply our need for dick,\" Mina said, and ducked when Venus tried to hit her in the face with a vibrator.",
      "Then Venus apparently realized that a vibrator had a somewhat obvious use when in bed with another naked girl, and let retaliation go in favor of more collaborative activities.",
      "* \"Do you think Diana's relationship with her brother is kind of creepy and incestuous?\" Venus mused out loud.",
      "\"Seriously, it's really weird that she took him to the formal.\"",
      "Mina opened one eye but remained otherwise limply flopped out on the bed.",
      "\"A, you just had sex with your step-sister.",
      "Glass houses, stones.",
      "B, this is your idea of pillow-talk?\"",
      "\"I'm just saying,\" Venus said, comfortably.",
      "\"She never dates.",
      "He's always in her room.",
      "It's kind of suspicious.\"",
      "\"Why are you telling me this,\" Mina mumbled into her pillow.",
      "Venus stretched lazily, and took a certain amount of personal satisfaction in the fact that Mina rolled over to watch.",
      "\"Well, you're on the lacrosse team with her.",
      "You would know, wouldn't you?\"",
      "\"I can assure you that I have never seen any proof in the lacrosse team's locker room that Diana's been fucking her twin brother in there,\" Mina said.",
      "\"Jesus Christ, go to sleep.",
      "You just got off three times, what more does it take?\" Venus hummed a little and snuggled down beside Mina, despite the sweat covering them both.",
      "\"Oh, Minnie, by the way.",
      "I hope you know this doesn't change anything,\" she said, in between yawns.",
      "\"I'm still going to beat your ass out on the Paris Fellowship application.\"",
      "\"Yeah, we'll see about that,\" Mina muttered.",
      "Venus pressed an absent-minded kiss to her collarbone.",
      "Mina's breasts made for an amazing pillow, she thought, and slipped easily into sleep."

    "text": "Three warriors brought together on the plains of Troy, between city walls and the charred hulks of the Achaian ships. Achilles stalked up and down in the middle distance, the fringes on his helm shaking with each step and his face set with grief. Hector, hand trembling, reached back to Deiphobos for his spear. Nothing in his hand. No familiar weight of ash and bronze. \"Deiphobos,\" Hector said, jabbing his hand back again, but he knew now there would be no answer. The presence he'd felt at his side, the one who'd brought him out here and away from safety, was still there, but not the same. Not sweat and leather and human warmth, but the high cool chill of Olympus. Already reaching for his sword, he turned his head just far enough to see grey-eyed Athena staring back, implacable. Achilles, teeth gleaming in a snarl, raised his own spear and charged. \"Next Zeus married bright Themis who bare the Horae (Hours), and Eunomia (Order), Dike (Justice), and blooming Eirene (Peace), who mind the works of mortal men...\" --Hesiod, Theogony. Trans. Hugh G Evelyn-White. Eunomia found Dike midway down the twentieth century, where the few thin strands of belief that still persisted were knotted into something stronger by the tides of war. She was on her knees in a storeroom, one hand pulling at the fastenings of a battered canvas satchel while the other sorted through an open first aid box. \"You can't do it,\" Eunomia said. Dike put a handful of thin paper packets (\"for topical application, 5g sterile crystalline sulphanilamide\") on to the floor beside her, next to a collection of brown glass vials. The top few packets slithered to the floor. \"It's not just,\" she said, not looking up. The stiff buckle finally gave way, and she pulled the tongue free. \"They interfere all the time.\" Eunomia leaned against the door frame, and felt it shift from metal to marble and back again. \"Would you challenge the gods, then?\" she asked. The blade of the question cut her as well, its edge undulled by all the years between then and now. \"It's not just,\" Dike said again. She picked up the loose packets and sat back on her heels, finally staring up at her sister. \"I just need to save one.\" Eunomia didn't ask which one. Dike was justice, and obligation, and loyalty. It was not just to be given away as a prize with no say in the matter; not fair to find yourself in a war for the sake of a brother who'd been a burning brand since his conception. \"The story is complete, gods or no,\" she said. The storeroom wavered around them, changing to a classroom, chalk dust hanging in the sunlight air; then the damp stone walls and smell of trampled rushes in a feudal hall, and finally the stones of a grave barrow and the ashes of a pyre cooling next to it, on the Trojan plains. Dike opened her hands, letting the drugs fade back into the future. Their surroundings shifted again to the slopes of Mount Parnassus, hellebore, anenome and saxifrage bright and gallant against the pale limestone. In the distance, someone was singing. \"Then I'll change its echoes,\" she said. Erato, the muse of love poetry Helen pulled her hand back from the water. The drops that fell were quickly absorbed into the waves, lost without trace, and the chill on her skin faded almost as fast. She rested her hand on the wooden rail of the boat and looked ahead into the dawn. Alessandro was sprawled out along the prow, gaze fixed on the distant smudges of buildings emerging from the mists. What she could see of his face was lit up by more than the morning sun. He'd looked at her like that, too, when they met in the shadows of her husband's court; but it was his voice that had persuaded her, not his face. Whispering into her ear, telling her of his home.The smudges were more distinct shapes now, red and pink and orange like coral, but made rather than grown. A tall narrow tower with precise corners stood out above the haze, gold gleaming from the top. The campanile, Paris had murmured. From up there you can see the whole city, a jewel, small enough to hold in your hand... The rower behind her dug the blade of his oar into the sea with a splash. When Helen looked down again there were dozens of sharp glints in the water, like spears, and dark forms massing below them. She blinked again, and they were just fish, small and silver, scattering through the water. Too late to return, now. The gondola docked in front of the palace, a building decorated with stone carvings as fine and intricate as lace. There were people everywhere, and all of them seemed to be watching Helen. At the edge of the waterfront there was a smaller group, dressed in velvets and furs, with faces that were not just waiting but judging. Paris scrambled out and hugged one of the women, saying something too quickly for Helen to comprehend. The rower busied himself with the mooring rope. Helen looked down at the water lapping against the wood of the dock. \"My lady,\" a voice said. The face she saw when she looked up was a duller, older version of Alessandro's; an everyday face, but kind. Oh, the heir's my brother Ettore, Alessandro had said, rolling his eyes, So responsible... He was holding out his hand. His grip didn't waver, even as Helen hauled herself up to balance awkwardly on her split and scaled tail. He kept holding her hand even when she was on the dock and Paris gestured for women to wrap her lower half in salt-water soaked cloths, keeping her safely concealed. \"I hope you will be happy here,\" Ettore said. A black-headed gull that had been watching them with sharp grey eyes from the top of a mooring post cawed, its cry harsh and piercing. Clio, the muse of history Hetty swung her hockey stick up on to her shoulder and frowned at an inoffensive patch of ivy that was curling across the brick arch of the gymnasium. This whole inter-house rivalry had gone on quite long enough. What had begun as a childish squabble over who would share a study with whom had now spilled over into a school-wide argument, with everybody bent on expressing their own opinion. As the senior prefect of Wilusa House, Hetty felt she bore some responsibility, but she found herself at a loss as to how to intervene - particularly given her own games captain was one of the chief instigators. She was still thinking when she arrived at the hockey field for practice and found the other girls in two clumps on either side of the field, glowering at each other. Nelly, who considered herself the injured party in the whole affair, was pacing up and down in front of one of the groups, holding forth in an aggrieved tone. Hetty sighed, and bent down to lace her boots. \"Awfully dire, isn't it?\" Hetty looked up to see Helen, the cause of all the argument, standing in front of her. She looked cool and neat in her summer uniform - Helen didn't play hockey - and sounded amused, but the face under the shady brim of her straw hat looked more than a little regretful. \"Silly little beasts,\" Hetty said. \"And we've the match against Sparta this weekend.\" Helen bit her lip. \"Perhaps I should -\" she began, but Hetty shook her head. \"No,\" she said, her mind quite made up. \"They need to stop quarrelling themselves. But they need an excuse, and I'm about to give them one.\" She strode out on to the field clapping for attention just as Paris arrived, laughing and breathless, hair tumbling loose on her shoulders. \"Don't start without me! Look, I'm just putting -\" \"Now.\" Hetty's deeper voice cut across Paris' light tones. \"This has gone on quite long enough, and it's dragging down the school. So Paris - \" she turned, looking. \"Nelly. Come here.\" The two of them came, their respective followers trailing behind them. \"Right.\" Hetty, between them, leaned on her hockey stick. \"Let's settle this like gentlemen. A duel.\" Both of them looked startled, but Paris was the first to speak. \"A duel?\" she said, incredulous, but Hetty was already overriding her. \"You're all carrying on as if this were something important,\" she said. \"If it's that important, you should be prepared to fight for it.\" Hetty had hoped was that the sheer ridiculousness of the idea would bring them back to the senses. Instead, to her disappointment - if not surprise - Nelly suddenly lunged at Paris, hands outstretched. Paris ducked, but not in time to avoid having her hair yanked. \"You cat!\" Paris swung back wildly. Nelly stepped back and kicked out with accuracy. Hetty scrambled out from between the combatants, rapidly re-considering the merits of her plan. Certainly, the other girls seemed undistressed, each cheering for their own fighter, but - Hetty shook her head. No, this had gone on too long for simple diplomacy. But as the fight progressed it became apparent the advantage was all Nelly's. Not only was she fast and nimble, as befitted the Argives' wing forward. But Paris, a competent enough centre, seemed incapable of pressing Nelly, and flinched whenever she came close - no, surely not? The games captain, a coward? Nelly grabbed Paris by her necktie and shook her like a rat, and Paris did nothing but hang there limply. Hetty opened her mouth to declare Nelly the winner, when suddenly a presence descended upon the field, and Miss Pallas, the games mistress, was among them, grey eyes flashing. \"Brawling in public! Bullying!\" She swooped on Paris, pulling her away from Nelly and into the shelter of her arm. \"Are you injured?\" Paris shrugged, looking dazed, but Miss Pallas was already turning on the rest of the girls. \"I am appalled at your behaviour,\" she declared. \"You are all to report to the Great Hall immediately - immediately! - while I take this poor child to Matron. And as of this moment, you are all on silence.\" Hetty picked up her stick. In the distance Helen followed along behind Paris and Miss Pallas, her back rigid and unreadable. Euterpe, the muse of lyric poetry \"Andoro-san!\" Andoro pushed away the mascara-wielding hand of one of the five make-up artists hovering around her to see Polyxena bouncing up and down, the stiff red layers of her tutu quivering with excitement. Since Andoro had last seen her she'd knotted tiny golden bells into her pigtails that tinkled with each bounce. \"What is it?\" Andromache asked, amused. Polyxena stopped mid-bounce and leant forward, bringing one hand up to her mouth as if guarding her words. \"Aki-kun isn't going to perform,\" she hissed. Loudly. The make-up artists froze as well, and the man who'd been advancing on Andoro with an outstretched pair of hair-straighteners fumbled and dropped them with a clatter. Andoro waved them all away. \"Not perform?\" she said. Polyxena had to be wrong, but Andoro felt hope rising inside her anyway. The women's Red team had lost the last nine Kohaku Uta Gassen New Year's Eve song contests, and would probably lose the tenth as well; but Aki, although young, was the strongest contestant on the opposing men's White team. She forced her excitement down again. \"Really?\" Polyxena nodded, bells chiming in emphasis. \"Really. He and Agame-san argued over who got Briseis-san as a lead backing dancer, because she's been training with Aki-san, but Agame-san's Chryseis-san had to go back to Hokkaido because her father's very ill, and Agame-san said he had to have Briseis-san instead. She's very pretty, don't you think?\" Backstage gossip, surely. Andoro stood up, pulling her overskirt free from another persistent aide, and walked over to one of the stage monitors to check the countdown. Polyxena trailed in her wake. On screen, Helen, immaculate as always, sang a slow ballad for her lost home, while ribbon dancers wove patterns of regret in the background. Five more minutes. \"He'll perform,\" she said, not looking behind her. Helen finished, and the hosts exchanged banter; nothing about Aki, but she found herself staring at the White team's host. There was sweat on his forehead, and he stumbled on one of his lines. She tried not to make anything of it. The voice that answered her wasn't Polyxena's. She spun round. Heki smiled at her. \"He won't,\" he repeated, gently, and took her hand. Andoro tightened her fingers on his. \"So we have a chance?\" He kissed her on the hand, trained by years of performances not to disturb her make-up. \"Please, do your best,\" he said, an answer in itself, and yet another aide was there, fussing and pushing him out of the way, ushering Andoro away through the wings and on to her entrance spot. She took a deep breath, checked ahead where the judges sat, waiting above the crowd like the gods on Olympus, and thought, for the first time, about victory. They announced Aki's withdrawal after her song, the White team host obviously distressed and the Red team's offering relieved sympathies. Andoro fought her way through a crowd of dancers dressed as eggplants in shiny purple tuxedoes, each of them expressing their own opinion about the news, and found Kasando and Polyxena drinking sips of smuggled sake in a corner while the live on-stage feed played on Kasando's laptop. Polyxena flung her arms around Andoro. \"We've won!\" \"Not yet,\" Kasando said, always pessimistic, but even she brightened up as act after act went on, with no Aki, and the Red team were obviously struggling. When Kurosu came out in Aki's expensive firebird costume, belatedly, the wires designed to carry him down to the stage in a glorious entry of flames and smoke got stuck, leaving him hanging (\"like a chicken waiting for the pot,\" Polyxena said). His performance, after that, was surprisingly competent; but he couldn't hit the high notes, and he wasn't Aki. Kasando took Andoro's cell phone away from her to text in her votes, ignoring her pleas that she needed it to find Heki. Polyxena had rounded up half a dozen junior dancers on roller skates and was teaching them a Greek circle dance. Andoro fought her way back through the crowd, looking for an unoccupied (and undamaged) bathroom. Past Aki's dressing room, door still shut and silent, and Andoro found what she was looking for. As she opened the door a woman walked briskly down the corridor, heels clicking. She was dressed in silver armour, a costume Andoro didn't remember, and dark glasses hid her eyes. Andoro slid the door shut behind her. She heard the woman's footsteps stop, and a sharp knock. Urania, the muse of astronomy Outside the viewport the burned-out hulks hung in loose clusters, debris orbiting slowly around them and the blue sphere of the Earth watching above. Achilles let his fist thump against the bulkhead, controlling the impact, when all he wanted to do was rip everything apart. There was ash in his eyelashes when he blinked, all he could smell was melted plastic, and he ached, bone-deep, but none of that mattered anymore. \"Replay,\" he said to the AI, again, and for the thousandth time he watched Patroclus spin out of control in the Aspis, destabilised by a rogue AI, and then the unlucky shot from behind that knocked out all his shielding. Achilles made himself watch, as he hadn't when it had all happened, as Patroclus tried to regain control and get closer to the Klisieh and safety. Fuel spilled silently into space and froze, the external lights on the Aspis flickered, candles in a strong wind, and Hector in the Harma came up from below like a shark and fired into the belly of the Aspis, splintering it into a thousand pieces. Patroclus hadn't died instantly. Achilles muttered to the AI, and it expanded all the data from the EVA suit, audio as well as visual, starting with the harsh claxon of the alarm after Patroclus' helmet was torn loose. Ten seconds, and the water on Patroclus' tongue boiled away, the soft tissues of his face bulging against empty space. Twenty seconds, and the oxygen probe alarms went off; forty, and he was convulsing and cyanosed. And then the seconds ticked off slowly, inexorably, while Patroclus' heart - the heart Achilles had lain next to only two nights ago, listening to the warm solid beat through Patroclus' chest - continued to beat. Until, at three minutes and eighteen seconds the arterial pressure fell below critical, and the blood boiled in his veins. Achilles cut off the suit data, but the monitors continued in a silent indictment. Hector had gone EVA himself, suit tether uncoiling behind him as he navigated to the suit and, piece by piece, disassembled it to take back with him, leaving Patroclus drifting free in nothing but a bloodstained thermowrap, his body battered into incomprehensibility. The Trojans were already using the suit's codes, cutting through the panicking Achaians and forcing them back, and back again. The AI showed Achilles the Troy orbital station, as fragile and as distant as ever, and all the conditional probabilities, calculated to five decimal places. Fight and die. Run and live. \"What do you think?\" he said to the AI. Context. \"You know why we're fighting. Is it worth it?\" The AI hummed, indicating a need for further input. Achilles shook himself. Suddenly he wanted to run, physically, somewhere where his bare feet could strike the ground, until he was exhausted and the air burned clear down into his lungs. Ten years in space now, and no end in sight other than his own. \"I don't mind dying if it means something,\" he said. The AI kept humming. \"Athena?\" Achilles said. \"Tell me what to do.\" The death of Hector on the plain of Troy was considered throughout the classical world to be the acme of the tragic experience in literature, and the passage continued to be held in the same esteem well into the medieval period. An Irish scribe of post-Roman times, having copied out an account of a Latin retelling of Hector's death, wrote a personal note in the manuscript's margin: \"I am greatly grieved at the above-mentioned death.\" - Thomas Cahill, Sailing the Wine-Dark Sea. Dike was weeping, her face red and blotchy, and her voice was choked with emotion. \"Why won't it change?\" she said, groping for Eunomia's hand in the grass next to her. Eunomia squeezed it in reassurance, and looked up at the circle of muses. \"It's Athena, isn't it?\" she said on her sister's behalf. \"Changing things?\" Melpomene pushed her tragedian's mask back on her head and stared down at the two of them. \"What makes you think the events you describe were going to happen any other way?\" Dike sniffled. \"Because they're different,\" she said, voice breaking on the last word. Eunomia squeezed her hand again, and wondered if the muses would mind if she dipped a handkerchief in one of their sacred springs to clean her sister's face. Melpomene shrugged. \"You wanted the same story.\" She reached up to pull the mask back into place. When she spoke again, her voice was cold and metallic. \"Do you think the gods can undo their actions, once past? Can anyone?\" Dike covered her face with her hands, shoulders heaving. One by one the muses drifted away, uninterested in their younger and more limited half-sisters. A warbler chirruped from a low branch behind them. Calliope was the last to leave. As Homer's muse, she had declined to offer the sisters a story, but not unkindly. Eunomia tugged Dike to her feet and ducked her head in apology. \"I'm sorry,\" she said, but Calliope held up her hand, palm out. Eunomia halted. \"Go forward,\" Calliope said, her words chiming like bells. \"You can always tell a new story.\" Thalia, muse of comedy \"Hello?\" Helen stepped hesitantly into the dusty room, her footsteps echoing. A few dozen scrolls were scattered carelessly on the low wooden table. \"Is anyone here?\" No one answered, but the room didn't feel empty. Shrugging, Helen walked forward, looking down at the scrolls. She traced the edge of one with a finger, wary of damaging such a priceless object, and wondered what the marks on it were saying... \"Ah, there you are.\" Helen jumped. Priam had come up on her before she'd realised. The lantern in his hand swayed to and fro, sending shadows bouncing around the walls. Priam's robes were torn and stained, and his hair dishevelled; he looked more than thirty years older than the kind and noble king she'd met when she first came to Troy. \"I am sorry,\" she said, but he had put the lantern down with a thump and was sorting through the scrolls, pushing them aside with irritated, jerky movements. \"I was very fond of Hector.\" Priam put his finger down on one of the marks in front of him and stared into the darkness in front of him. \"So was I,\" he said, after a moment. Helen swallowed, her throat thick. \"My son's body has lain outside these city walls for eight days and nights,\" Priam said. He was still looking into nothingness. \"And yet it remains incorruptible, as fresh as the moment Achilles let out his life's blood. And, every morning in the Achaian camp, another corpse is found, drained white, with none of our soldiers to take account for it.\" \"I'm not sure-\" \"It's happened before.\" Priam's finger tightened on the scroll. \"The dead rise, but they do not remember the living. They destroy them, and of some they make more of themselves, until their black tide covers the earth. Unless they are stopped...\" He shoved the scroll away and gazed at Helen. \"You beat your brothers at wrestling in the sports of your youth, and outran all comers at the games. Did you ever think there was more to you than some man's prize?\" Helen shook her head in denial, even as her heart beat faster. She'd beaten all that down inside her years ago, a battle more bitter than any ordained by rules or referees. \"Into each generation one girl is born,\" Priam said. \"A Chosen one, with the strength and skill to hunt the vampires.\" Helen, staring back at him, felt her hand tighten as if reaching for a weapon. \"The Slayer,\" Priam said, and let the scroll roll shut with a snap. \"Cup of tea?\"",

      "Andoro pushed away the mascara-wielding hand of one of the five make-up artists hovering around her to see Polyxena bouncing up and down, the stiff red layers of her tutu quivering with excitement.",
      "Since Andoro had last seen her she'd knotted tiny golden bells into her pigtails that tinkled with each bounce.",
      "\"What is it?\" Andromache asked, amused.",
      "Polyxena stopped mid-bounce and leant forward, bringing one hand up to her mouth as if guarding her words.",
      "\"Aki-kun isn't going to perform,\" she hissed.",
      "Loudly.",
      "The make-up artists froze as well, and the man who'd been advancing on Andoro with an outstretched pair of hair-straighteners fumbled and dropped them with a clatter.",
      "Andoro waved them all away.",
      "\"Not perform?\" she said.",
      "Polyxena had to be wrong, but Andoro felt hope rising inside her anyway.",
      "The women's Red team had lost the last nine Kohaku Uta Gassen New Year's Eve song contests, and would probably lose the tenth as well; but Aki, although young, was the strongest contestant on the opposing men's White team.",
      "She forced her excitement down again.",
      "\"Really?\" Polyxena nodded, bells chiming in emphasis.",
      "\"Really.",
      "He and Agame-san argued over who got Briseis-san as a lead backing dancer, because she's been training with Aki-san, but Agame-san's Chryseis-san had to go back to Hokkaido because her father's very ill, and Agame-san said he had to have Briseis-san instead.",
      "She's very pretty, don't you think?\" Backstage gossip, surely.",
      "Andoro stood up, pulling her overskirt free from another persistent aide, and walked over to one of the stage monitors to check the countdown.",
      "Polyxena trailed in her wake.",
      "On screen, Helen, immaculate as always, sang a slow ballad for her lost home, while ribbon dancers wove patterns of regret in the background.",
      "Five more minutes.",
      "\"He'll perform,\" she said, not looking behind her.",
      "Helen finished, and the hosts exchanged banter; nothing about Aki, but she found herself staring at the White team's host.",
      "There was sweat on his forehead, and he stumbled on one of his lines.",
      "She tried not to make anything of it.",
      "The voice that answered her wasn't Polyxena's.",
      "She spun round.",
      "Heki smiled at her.",
      "\"He won't,\" he repeated, gently, and took her hand.",
      "Andoro tightened her fingers on his.",
      "\"So we have a chance?\"",
      "He kissed her on the hand, trained by years of performances not to disturb her make-up.",
      "\"Please, do your best,\" he said, an answer in itself, and yet another aide was there, fussing and pushing him out of the way, ushering Andoro away through the wings and on to her entrance spot.",
      "She took a deep breath, checked ahead where the judges sat, waiting above the crowd like the gods on Olympus, and thought, for the first time, about victory.",
      "They announced Aki's withdrawal after her song, the White team host obviously distressed and the Red team's offering relieved sympathies.",
      "Andoro fought her way through a crowd of dancers dressed as eggplants in shiny purple tuxedoes, each of them expressing their own opinion about the news, and found Kasando and Polyxena drinking sips of smuggled sake in a corner while the live on-stage feed played on Kasando's laptop.",
      "Polyxena flung her arms around Andoro.",
      "\"We've won!\"",
      "\"Not yet,\" Kasando said, always pessimistic, but even she brightened up as act after act went on, with no Aki, and the Red team were obviously struggling.",
      "When Kurosu came out in Aki's expensive firebird costume, belatedly, the wires designed to carry him down to the stage in a glorious entry of flames and smoke got stuck, leaving him hanging (\"like a chicken waiting for the pot,\" Polyxena said).",
      "His performance, after that, was surprisingly competent; but he couldn't hit the high notes, and he wasn't Aki.",
      "Kasando took Andoro's cell phone away from her to text in her votes, ignoring her pleas that she needed it to find Heki.",
      "Polyxena had rounded up half a dozen junior dancers on roller skates and was teaching them a Greek circle dance.",
      "Andoro fought her way back through the crowd, looking for an unoccupied (and undamaged) bathroom.",
      "Past Aki's dressing room, door still shut and silent, and Andoro found what she was looking for.",
      "As she opened the door a woman walked briskly down the corridor, heels clicking.",
      "She was dressed in silver armour, a costume Andoro didn't remember, and dark glasses hid her eyes.",
      "Andoro slid the door shut behind her.",
      "She heard the woman's footsteps stop, and a sharp knock.",
      "Urania, the muse of astronomy Outside the viewport the burned-out hulks hung in loose clusters, debris orbiting slowly around them and the blue sphere of the Earth watching above.",
      "Achilles let his fist thump against the bulkhead, controlling the impact, when all he wanted to do was rip everything apart.",
      "There was ash in his eyelashes when he blinked, all he could smell was melted plastic, and he ached, bone-deep, but none of that mattered anymore.",
      "\"Replay,\" he said to the AI, again, and for the thousandth time he watched Patroclus spin out of control in the Aspis, destabilised by a rogue AI, and then the unlucky shot from behind that knocked out all his shielding.",
      "Achilles made himself watch, as he hadn't when it had all happened, as Patroclus tried to regain control and get closer to the Klisieh and safety.",
      "Fuel spilled silently into space and froze, the external lights on the Aspis flickered, candles in a strong wind, and Hector in the Harma came up from below like a shark and fired into the belly of the Aspis, splintering it into a thousand pieces.",
      "Patroclus hadn't died instantly.",
      "Achilles muttered to the AI, and it expanded all the data from the EVA suit, audio as well as visual, starting with the harsh claxon of the alarm after Patroclus' helmet was torn loose.",
      "Ten seconds, and the water on Patroclus' tongue boiled away, the soft tissues of his face bulging against empty space.",
      "Twenty seconds, and the oxygen probe alarms went off; forty, and he was convulsing and cyanosed.",
      "And then the seconds ticked off slowly, inexorably, while Patroclus' heart - the heart Achilles had lain next to only two nights ago, listening to the warm solid beat through Patroclus' chest - continued to beat.",
      "Until, at three minutes and eighteen seconds the arterial pressure fell below critical, and the blood boiled in his veins.",
      "Achilles cut off the suit data, but the monitors continued in a silent indictment.",
      "Hector had gone EVA himself, suit tether uncoiling behind him as he navigated to the suit and, piece by piece, disassembled it to take back with him, leaving Patroclus drifting free in nothing but a bloodstained thermowrap, his body battered into incomprehensibility.",
      "The Trojans were already using the suit's codes, cutting through the panicking Achaians and forcing them back, and back again.",
      "The AI showed Achilles the Troy orbital station, as fragile and as distant as ever, and all the conditional probabilities, calculated to five decimal places.",
      "Fight and die.",
      "Run and live.",
      "\"What do you think?\" he said to the AI.",
      "Context.",
      "\"You know why we're fighting.",
      "Is it worth it?\"",
      "The AI hummed, indicating a need for further input.",
      "Achilles shook himself.",
      "Suddenly he wanted to run, physically, somewhere where his bare feet could strike the ground, until he was exhausted and the air burned clear down into his lungs.",
      "Ten years in space now, and no end in sight other than his own.",
      "\"I don't mind dying if it means something,\" he said.",
      "The AI kept humming.",
      "\"Athena?\" Achilles said.",
      "\"Tell me what to do.\"",
      "The death of Hector on the plain of Troy was considered throughout the classical world to be the acme of the tragic experience in literature, and the passage continued to be held in the same esteem well into the medieval period.",
      "An Irish scribe of post-Roman times, having copied out an account of a Latin retelling of Hector's death, wrote a personal note in the manuscript's margin: \"I am greatly grieved at the above-mentioned death.\"",
      "- Thomas Cahill, Sailing the Wine-Dark Sea.",
      "Dike was weeping, her face red and blotchy, and her voice was choked with emotion.",
      "\"Why won't it change?\" she said, groping for Eunomia's hand in the grass next to her.",
      "Eunomia squeezed it in reassurance, and looked up at the circle of muses.",
      "\"It's Athena, isn't it?\" she said on her sister's behalf.",
      "\"Changing things?\" Melpomene pushed her tragedian's mask back on her head and stared down at the two of them.",
      "\"What makes you think the events you describe were going to happen any other way?\" Dike sniffled.",
      "\"Because they're different,\" she said, voice breaking on the last word.",
      "Eunomia squeezed her hand again, and wondered if the muses would mind if she dipped a handkerchief in one of their sacred springs to clean her sister's face.",
      "Melpomene shrugged.",
      "\"You wanted the same story.\"",
      "She reached up to pull the mask back into place.",
      "When she spoke again, her voice was cold and metallic.",
      "\"Do you think the gods can undo their actions, once past?",
      "Can anyone?\"",
      "Dike covered her face with her hands, shoulders heaving.",
      "One by one the muses drifted away, uninterested in their younger and more limited half-sisters.",
      "A warbler chirruped from a low branch behind them.",
      "Calliope was the last to leave.",
      "As Homer's muse, she had declined to offer the sisters a story, but not unkindly.",
      "Eunomia tugged Dike to her feet and ducked her head in apology.",
      "\"I'm sorry,\" she said, but Calliope held up her hand, palm out.",
      "Eunomia halted.",
      "\"Go forward,\" Calliope said, her words chiming like bells.",
      "\"You can always tell a new story.\"",
      "Thalia, muse of comedy \"Hello?\" Helen stepped hesitantly into the dusty room, her footsteps echoing.",
      "A few dozen scrolls were scattered carelessly on the low wooden table.",
      "\"Is anyone here?\"",
      "No one answered, but the room didn't feel empty.",
      "Shrugging, Helen walked forward, looking down at the scrolls.",
      "She traced the edge of one with a finger, wary of damaging such a priceless object, and wondered what the marks on it were saying...",
      "\"Ah, there you are.\"",
      "Helen jumped.",
      "Priam had come up on her before she'd realised.",
      "The lantern in his hand swayed to and fro, sending shadows bouncing around the walls.",
      "Priam's robes were torn and stained, and his hair dishevelled; he looked more than thirty years older than the kind and noble king she'd met when she first came to Troy.",
      "\"I am sorry,\" she said, but he had put the lantern down with a thump and was sorting through the scrolls, pushing them aside with irritated, jerky movements.",
      "\"I was very fond of Hector.\"",
      "Priam put his finger down on one of the marks in front of him and stared into the darkness in front of him.",
      "\"So was I,\" he said, after a moment.",
      "Helen swallowed, her throat thick.",
      "\"My son's body has lain outside these city walls for eight days and nights,\" Priam said.",
      "He was still looking into nothingness.",
      "\"And yet it remains incorruptible, as fresh as the moment Achilles let out his life's blood.",
      "And, every morning in the Achaian camp, another corpse is found, drained white, with none of our soldiers to take account for it.\"",
      "\"I'm not sure-\" \"It's happened before.\"",
      "Priam's finger tightened on the scroll.",
      "\"The dead rise, but they do not remember the living.",
      "They destroy them, and of some they make more of themselves, until their black tide covers the earth.",
      "Unless they are stopped...\" He shoved the scroll away and gazed at Helen.",
      "\"You beat your brothers at wrestling in the sports of your youth, and outran all comers at the games.",
      "Did you ever think there was more to you than some man's prize?\"",
      "Helen shook her head in denial, even as her heart beat faster.",
      "She'd beaten all that down inside her years ago, a battle more bitter than any ordained by rules or referees.",
      "\"Into each generation one girl is born,\" Priam said.",
      "\"A Chosen one, with the strength and skill to hunt the vampires.\"",
      "Helen, staring back at him, felt her hand tighten as if reaching for a weapon.",
      "\"The Slayer,\" Priam said, and let the scroll roll shut with a snap.",

    "text": "At the top of the hill, the chariot driver continued straight ahead under the ridge instead of taking the left fork down into the valley. The rougher track shook the wicker vehicle even more than the main road had, but the youth barely slowed the trotting horses, expertly guiding his mares around the larger stones. His younger passenger protested. \"Hey -- you missed the Argos road.\" \"Chill -- this will still get us there,\" he responded over his shoulder. \"Just... not as quickly.\" \"But King Aegialeus -- \" \" -- won't expect us before the evening meal.\" The driver slowed the horses for a rock that spanned the track, but the chariot still rode over it with a lurch. \"Indeed,\" he went on as he twitched the horses faster again, \"arriving any earlier would be rude.\" \"Agamemnon! You said we'd go straight there -- \" \"Besides, Menelaus, up this way we'll have more chance to try out our new spears.\" \"But they're for -- \" Menelaus started, then caught himself. \"Oh, right -- we need to test them. In action.\" \"To make sure they won't embarrass us on tomorrow's hunt,\" the driver agreed. Menelaus hesitated a moment longer, started laughing. \"Brother, you are the worst.\" Agamemnon spared a moment's attention away from the road to grin back at him -- and was rewarded with a bump that nearly threw the chariot over. It took both of them several moments to wrench it back to level and settle the horses. Time, the driver told himself silently, to take it a bit slow, even with the dust. Besides, they were starting up the approach to the pass. The horses would want resting soon -- at the spring, if it was still running this time of year. \"Idiot,\" Menelaus said, once he had resettled their new spears in the sheath strapped to the car's side. \"Worried old man,\" his older brother retorted. \"One day your impulsiveness is going to get us killed. You know that, right?\" \"So you keep saying.\" Agamemnon ignored the exaggerated sigh behind them, for as they rounded the bend of the ridge, there was another chariot under the old oak. A stranger's. It was larger than theirs -- wide enough to block passage -- though still pulled by only the two horses. One person held the once-sweaty geldings while another watered them. A third filled a skin from the spring. Agamemnon slowed to a stop three lengths away, and Menelaus hopped out to catch the near bridle and hold the horses. As their dust cloud caught up and rolled over him, Agamemnon thought quickly -- what would strangers with a chariot this fine be doing here, in the hills above Mycenae and Argos? Was it only these three or were they an advance party? Regardless, his duty was clear -- Atreus had thumped the lesson of Laius's death into his head often enough. And until the top of the pass, this was still Mycenae territory, making him host in more ways than one. Only once the dust had cleared enough they could see clearly, and speak without choking, did he realize the three were all women -- one still holding their horses, two in front of her with a spear ready and a bow strung and nocked. Wearing short tunics and leggings, no less, and holding their weapons like they knew how to use them. All the more reason to be polite. \"In the name of Zeus, Guardian of Strangers, hail!\" he called to them. The archer replied, \"In the name of Zeus, Guardian of Hosts, hail!\" She had a deep voice for a woman, and was a little older than the other two. Menelaus coughed -- possibly because of the dust, instead of the half-mockery aimed at his older brother. Which Agamemnon knew to ignore. \"Our thanks,\" he returned. \"What brings you to Mycenae?\" \"Ah -- we're past Argos then?\" the horsewoman said. Her voice was clear, but accented with the tones of the south. Spartan, maybe? \"Continue on,\" and he indicated the way he'd come, \"and go left down the valley, and it takes you straight to the west gates.\" Horsewoman shook her head. \"You mistake us -- we're heading north by the shortest road as we can.\" Three women, unaccompanied, wishing to avoid the cities -- he supposed that, even armed, they might have a reason to. Or if they were exiles and on the run. But all he said was, \"From here, all roads lead to Argos or Mycenae -- or,\" and he gestured up at the mountain looming from the north, \"to Nemea over the back side of Mt. Artemision here, though that's a hard way for wheels.\" The women glanced at each other, then the horsewoman nodded to him. \"If you could direct us by that road, we'd appreciate it.\" Definitely Spartan phrasing. And with a tone like that, probably high-born. Which of King Tyndareus's lords had daughters his age? He couldn't remember -- and his father would whack him for admitting it. \"Actually, it's back the way you came, about eight furlongs.\" \"What, the foot-path at the abandoned town?\" \"Told you,\" said the spearwoman. \"Shut up, Mica.\" \"Just sayin'.\" Through gritted teeth: \"Shut. Up.\" Before laughter got the best of him, or at least gave him a cough like Menelaus, Agamemnon interrupted with, \"Nay, it's a farmers' wagon track -- between here and Lyrkeia, the old town.\" \"Oh.\" In this, the horsewoman spoke for all three: each had a nonplussed look. They must have missed it. This was getting more and more interesting. \"We'd be glad to escort you there,\" he added with a small bow. \"Our thanks,\" the spokeswoman said with just as small a bow. It took a few minutes to turn their geldings around. Agamemnon offered to help pick up their chariot, but the three women were strong enough to handle the lightly laden wicker themselves. Before they mounted, he introduced himself. \"I am Agamemnon, son of Atreus -- this is my brother, Menelaus.\" Which made the women exchange looks again. \"I am C-Clothia.\" The horsewoman stumbled over the transparently fake name -- obviously not used to deceit. He almost called her on it before remembering she was a guest in his land. Besides, if he didn't... the temptation to let her tangle her own reins was too strong to give up. She continued, \"And these are Critylla and Mica.\" And with his own mares rested, both parties were ready. It wasn't until he mounted behind his brother that Menelaus realized: \"Wait -- we'll be in their dust.\" \"Well, they are our guests,\" Agamemnon murmured just loud enough only Menelaus could hear. Besides, this way, he could see whether they missed the wagon track again. Being less used to the road, the women drove slower -- but competently, Agamemnon was pleased to note. Word had it that Spartan girls trained well -- and trained naked as any youth. He wondered how long he could find excuses to stay with them. He suspected it would be worth watching. As would finding out just what they were up to. Speculation kept him pleasantly occupied as he hung back, just beyond their clearing dust cloud. The Spartans stopped at the shepherd's cot. As Agamemnon came up beside them, Clothia pointed at the track winding up the hill beyond the paddock. \"Is that it?\" \"Aye,\" Menelaus. \"That'll take you straight over the mountain.\" Mentally, Agamemnon kicked his little brother. Mica shook her head. \"They take wagons up that thing?\" \"Up isn't the hard direction,\" Agamemnon quickly said, cutting off Menelaus before he could spoke his wheels again. \"But given how light your load is, down shouldn't be a problem.\" Then he added, \"Much.\" The women looked at each other. That's it, he thought. Take the bait. We're good, strong young men at your service. \"Let me guess,\" Clothia said, \"we can't miss the way.\" \"That's right,\" Agamemnon said. \"Just bear left at the second herm, the one without a head. When you reach the ridge, continue up instead of taking the first way down. Oh, and before then, as you cross the meadow, ignore the cairns -- they're for the hunters.\" He made the directions as confusing as possible -- in truth, the route was indeed obvious, with the side-ways being footpaths no wagon or chariot could take. Menelaus gave him an odd look, but played along -- for once. The women again consulted each other silently. \"Our thanks, Agamemnon,\" Clothia said. \"We do not wish impose upon your hospitality any longer, but could you perhaps recommend a guide for us?' Ha! \"Speak nothing of it. We can show you the way ourselves.\" And bless his heart, Menelaus only nodded. After Agamemnon insisted three times that it was no imposition, the women gave in. The wagon track was even slower than the road, but no rougher if you stayed in the wheel-grooves. It was, however, steeper -- to save the horses, only the driver could ride, with the others walking. Since Menelaus was lighter, he got to take the reigns, but Agamemnon wasn't about to give him control of Balius and Xanthus, and walked them holding Xanthus's bridle. As needed, he helped Mica and Critylla, who also walked, when their chariot caught straying out of the grooves. By the third time, Mica even thanked him for it. With stops at the two springs for rest and water, and a noon-meal of bread and olives from a pair of shepherds, they didn't reach the border between Mycenaen and Corinthian territory until mid-afternoon. Without difficulty. Clothia stood beside him on the ridge, looking down at the vale of Nemea with its pine forest. \"You were right,\" she said. \"We couldn't miss it.\" Agamemnon smiled. \"Aye.\" She measured him with narrowed eyes. \"So?\" He raised innocent eyebrows. \"So?\" \"So is the road to Nemea as obvious as this one?\" He opened his mouth, then thought a moment. \"To Nemea, yes,\" he said honestly, \"but the only road out goes straight down to Kleonai, where it meets the main road north from Corinth. You'll have to pass through the town -- ask for directions to Tenea -- that road will let you bypass Corinth.\" \"I... see.\" He wasn't sure if she was more disconcerted by his directions or his open acknowledgement of their desire to avoid cities. \"Well then,\" he said in an imitation of his uncle's heartiest manner -- the one Thyestes put on when he was about to say something the most cutting, \"before our farewells, I bid you one favor.\" \"Yes?\" As if, as guest, she could deny it. \"Your name.\" Her true name. If Clothia were a dog, she would have snarled. As a human, and a noble at that, she only smiled with all the sweetness of honey mixed with wormwood. \"Clytemnestra.\" \"Tyndareus's daughter?!\" Menelaus blurted at his shoulder. The Spartan king's daughter bowed to him, mouth set as if it held an unripe olive. \"But what are you --!\" he began, but Agamemnon interrupted, \"Brother! Courtesy to our guest.\" Clytemnestra looked at him, then glanced at the boundary stone -- the one beyond which they would no longer be guests. Agamemnon smiled sweetly. \"Again, our thanks,\" Clytemnestra said. \"May the gods protect you on your journey, no matter where it takes you,\" Agamemnon said pointedly. Clytemnestra looked at him a moment, then her shoulders slumped slightly. \"Let me guess -- you know the way around Kleonai without asking for directions.\" Agamemnon bowed slightly. It was that or grin like a lunatic. \"We would be glad of your continued assistance,\" she said, voice resigned. \"Lady!\" Critylla protested, even as Menelaus squawked. Agamemnon stepped on his brother's sandaled foot, while Clytemnestra cut Critylla off with a gesture. \"They've shown themselves to be honorable hosts,\" she said. \"Always,\" Agamemnon agreed. \"By Nemean Zeus, you have nothing to fear from us.\" \"By Nemean Zeus,\" Menelaus echoed hastily. Mica shifted the spear in hand, then glanced down at the sanctuary just visible below. The looks both she and Critylla gave the brothers promised that what the will of the gods didn't protect, the hands of women would. Though in truth, Agamemnon had no intentions that way -- not when there was an adventure to be had. And as for Menelaus, he was still more interested in horses and hounds than girls. Clytemnestra let out a breath. \"Then let us be off, while the sun still shines.\" As Agamemnon came round to step into his chariot, Menelaus caught his arm. \"Brother,\" he said through gritted teeth. \"Hunting with Aegialeus can wait,\" Agamemnon told him. \"Besides, from here, this is the fastest way back.\" \"One day, brother -- \" \" -- but not yet,\" Agamemnon said. \"Not while the gods favor the bold.\" Menelaus looked at him a moment, then just shook his head as he released his arm. The way down was faster than up, even with holding the horses back -- and, at times, the chariots as well. Agamemnon and Menelaus switched off who drove and who pulled. It was longer work than Agamemnon expected, but he wasn't about to complain when the women didn't. It was probably just as well the parties had to stay too far apart to talk. Finally the slope flattened, though the road still went downhill through scattered oaks and then clustered pines -- flat enough that after resting the horses they could all ride. The sun was still just over the western mountains when they reached the sanctuary of Nemean Zeus, below the cave where the Lion had denned. Menelaus eagerly pointed out the latter, and the valley where Heracles had fought it. \"We'd best lodge here,\" Agamemnon said, nodding at the guest-houses for pilgrims that lined the main road up from Kleonai. \"There's little else between here and town.\" Clytemnestra glanced at the disappearing sun, and nodded reluctantly. And truth be told, Agamemnon was glad of stopping. Mica and Menelaus both drooped as well, though Critylla looked fine -- her stamina was disturbing. Separate lodgings for men and women, of course, though they bartered together for their evening meal. Critylla made short work of preparing it while Mica borrowed a coal for an outdoor hearth-fire. As meals went, even without meat and with sour wine, it was good. It had been a long day. Agamemnon, sitting across from Clytemnestra, considered her face in the flickering firelight -- her strong nose and straight brow. She stared into the coals, frowning. Time, he thought, to bring this to a head. When she noticed his gaze, he said, \"I've been patient enough. So where are you going?\" Critylla stirred and Mica choked back a protest, but Clytemnestra only blinked -- remembering, no doubt, that her privacy was no longer bound by guest-law. She took a considering breath, then said, \"Theseus of Athens abducted my sister, and we're going to rescue her.\" It was Agamemnon's turn to blink. \"You mean Helen?\" \"Ah -- you've heard of her.\" Who hadn't? Harpers up and down the peninsula had sung her praises since she was old enough to dimple a smile. \"Is Theseus really that stupid?\" he said, at the same time Menelaus said, \"Is Helen really that pretty?\" Clytemnestra rolled her eyes, and Agamemnon swatted Menelaus upside the head. \"Ow! Hey!\" \"Thank you,\" Clytemnestra said. \"Don't mention it,\" Agamemnon said. \"Well I will,\" Menelaus said. \"That hurt!\" \"And in answer to your questions, yes,\" Clytemnestra said. \"Then why?\" Agamemnon asked. \"Does stupidity need a reason beyond beauty?\" Agamemnon waved that aside. \"I mean, why you?\" Clytemnestra looked grim. \"I always promised my little sister I'd protect her.\" \"Ah.\" Agamemnon knew about those sorts of promises. All the times he'd taken the beating for Menelaus, or stopped their half-brother Aegisthus from picking on him. \"Oh,\" Menelaus said, and then glanced at his brother. Then, \"But wait -- how are you going to take Athens with just two soldiers?\" \"Three,\" Agamemnon corrected. Hadn't he seen her sword belt? \"Cities are defended against armies, not against a couple 'mere women'.\" \"What do you mean -- sneak in?\" Menelaus said. \"Use deception?\" Clytemnestra waggled her hand in indifference. But then, what did honor mean to a woman, anyway? No more than her name, and she'd already shown what she thought of that. This promised to be a truly interesting adventure. It was all Agamemnon could do to keep from grinning, even as Menelaus started to argue. # In the morning, the Spartans did indeed train -- with an emphasis on sword, spear, and bow over athletics -- and did it like any youth. For all his speculation the day before, Agamemnon resolutely ignored them as he drilled his brother with sword alone -- training was too important. The sight of the naked women, though, made Menelaus more than usually distracted. \"That's -- \" Agamemnon whacked his shoulder with the flat of his sword. \" -- what you get for gawking.\" \"Ow! But it's not -- \" Menelaus barely parried the next blow. \" -- what you're supposed to look at.\" \"But they're -- \" \" -- not who you're fighting.\" Agamemnon whacked the other arm. \"Watch the sword, not the sheathes.\" Menelaus flushed even more at the double-meaning. This was not the time for him to suddenly get old enough to notice the other sex -- not when it kept him from defending himself. Agamemnon snarled and knocked the sword out of his brother's hand, then brought blade up to his throat. \"That's four times dead.\" He pointed at the sword in the dust. \"Concentrate! Or you really will get killed.\" The women finished first, leaving Agamemnon no reward for his virtue. By the time they were ready to leave, Menelaus had died three more times but was finally getting his guard up, and even managed a couple counter-attacks. It was just... so frustrating. For all his vows, Agamemnon wouldn't be able to protect his brother forever -- he had to make sure he could survive on his own. They left Nemea soon after, on the smooth road that let all of them ride. Only as they departed did Agamemnon realize he also hadn't seen how well the women could fight. \"I was trying to tell you,\" Menelaus said. \"They're good.\" Agamemnon grimaced but didn't respond. Which meant he had to hear his brother go on and on about the neat trick Mica had used with the spear to disarm Clytemnestra. At their rest stop halfway to Kleonai, Agamemnon found himself beside Mica as they tended their respective horses. She was the same age as him and Clytemnestra, though not as striking at the latter. \"You've got an admirer,\" he said, \"for your spear-work.\" She paused to look at him, but he kept his face carefully blank. \"Do I now?\" He nodded toward Menelaus. \"He was quite distracted by it.\" Mica smiled. \"Oh, was he now. By my spear-work.\" \"So he says.\" Agamemnon had to work to keep his lips from twitching. \"Ah, well,\" she turned back to checking her gelding's hind hoof. \"He's too young for the likes of me.\" \"Aye,\" Agamemnon agreed. Balius shifted as he inspected her knee -- she sometimes got inflamed if she pulled for too long. When she stood up, Mica said, \"You're not bad yourself.\" Then added, \"With a sword.\" Agamemnon smiled. \"It's all in the practice.\" She politely agreed, hiding a smile of her own. He would have gone on, but caught sight of Clytemnestra, watching them with a frown. \"Are we ready to leave?\" she asked. \"Yes'm,\" Mica said, in her soft Spartan accent. \"Aye,\" Agamemnon agreed. As the party prepared to mount, Clytemnestra caught Agamemnon alone, and held up a finger to stop him. She stared into his face a heartbeat, eyes narrowed. \"I protect my own,\" she said in a soft voice stiffened with iron resolve. \"Of course,\" Agamemnon agreed, voice just as low. \"That's why you're following Helen.\" \"And don't you forget it.\" He doubted he would. He nodded and hopped onto his chariot, saying more loudly, \"Follow me 'round Kleonai, then,\" as if that was what they'd been discussing. True to his word, though, when the road reached the river plains, he lead the Spartans off between fields, north around the town. In the olive groves to the east, however, the tracks began crisscrossing like a labyrinth, hiding the main road over the next mountains. It was easy to follow once you were on it, but it was only marked at the town gate. Twice he thought he had it, only to realize it was another side road for the olive pickers. It was Menelaus who first pointed out the right way. \"There!\" \"Aye,\" Agamemnon agreed and smoothly turned his mares onto it -- heading onward. The horses could go a little further still, and the sun was barely halfway up the sky. \"Hey!\" Menelaus said but subsided when Agamemnon ignored him. Agamemnon smiled to himself. They stopped at the well beside another sheep-pen, just before the road headed up the mountain in earnest. As they rested and fed the horses, Clytemnestra came over to the brothers. Slowly, almost as if reluctantly, she said, \"Our thanks for all you have done for us.\" Agamemnon bowed his head for a moment. \"Zeus strike me if I've been a bad host.\" Which pulled a chuckle out of her. \"Nay -- nothing like one. And Zeus strike me if, like a bad guest, we impose upon you any longer.\" \"It'll be no imposition at all,\" Agamemnon said smoothly. \"In that case,\" she began, then realized what he'd said. \"It 'will'?\" Menelaus finally caught on. \"Wait, what?\" \"You're not coming with us,\" Clytemnestra continued, halfway between a command and a question. \"It would,\" Agamemnon said with a straight face, \"be dishonorable to abandon a rescue mission.\" Menelaus made a strangled sound. \"You are not coming with us,\" Clytemnestra said more firmly. \"Right,\" Menelaus agreed, \"we're already -- ow.\" Agamemnon kept his foot on his brother's. \"Of course we are,\" he said to her. \"My father, Atreus, is a friend of Tyndareus -- we cannot stand aside and not help when his family is in need.\" \"Ow,\" Menelaus said again. \"I -- \" Clytemnestra began, then shook her head. \"Politics,\" she said, voice disgusted. \"We will rescue Helen,\" Agamemnon said. \"My word on it.\" \"Ouch,\" Menelaus said, as if to vary things. Clytemnestra looked into Agamemnon's eyes. Hers were a dark blue, he was startled to realize. She let out her breath, as if concluding his resolve was indeed solid. \"Fine. I accept your assistance,\" and then turned with a swirl of her tunic to stalk back to her handmaids. Agamemnon wanted to sigh himself. Instead, he let his brother's foot go. \"THANK you,\" Menelaus muttered. \"You're welcome,\" Agamemnon replied sweetly. \"Never mind Aegialeus -- if our father finds out.\" Mention of Atreus and his likely wrath was almost enough to dampen the spark that drove Agamemnon -- even for such an adventure as this promised to be. Who knew how far this one would take them? Menelaus went on, \"Are you really just doing this to stay friendly with Tyndareus?\" \"Swear to me on our grandfather's name that you wouldn't want to be known for rescuing Helen of Sparta.\" Agamemnon looked into Menelaus's eyes, and his brother looked away. \"You can't.\" Menelaus covered his face with his hand. \"You owe me,\" he said against his palm. Agamemnon just laughed. Menelaus limped over to the horses to console himself in Xanthus's mane. # Beyond Tenea, they stopped at the top of the pass to look out at the sea: the head of a long deep bay, green below them, blue beyond, and misty at the horizon. Agamemnon pointed right down the coast. \"Epidaurus is around the headland. The island ahead is Salamis, where Telamon rules. His father, old Aeacus, still holds Aegina with his Myrmidons, the half-hidden island to its right. And down there, we take the coast road left,\" he gestured along the curving sweep of the shoreline, \"over the Isthmus, through Megara, Eleusis, and then Athens, beyond Salamis.\" \"It's beautiful,\" Menelaus said, gazing raptly at the ocean. Clytemnestra chewed her lip thoughtfully. \"So another three days?\" \"More like four,\" Agamemnon said, though it was pure guess. \"Distances are deceiving.\" She nodded. \"Then let's get going.\" # Late the next day, they straggled into the harbor town of Kenchreai, across the Isthmus from Corinth. The road down to the sea had been rougher than expected, and having never taken it before, Agamemnon made a wrong turn twice. The coast road itself had wound in and out of every inlet and ridge. Distance was, indeed, deceiving. \"We should go on,\" Clytemnestra said. \"It's still light.\" \"Princess,\" Agamemnon said with as much patience as he could muster, \"the horses must rest.\" \"As must we,\" Menelaus added. Both he and Mica were looking more than a little worn. \"And eat.\" \"Besides,\" Critylla said, \"there's a shrine here to Artemis the Healer that was founded by Atalanta.\" Which made Mica perk up. \"Oh! We have to visit that!\" \"By Atalanta,\" Clytemnestra repeated. Critylla and Mica nodded in unison. \"Sometimes, you fangirls are just a little too much,\" Clytemnestra said. Ignoring her, Critylla went on, \"it's on the north side of town, near to the natural hot baths.\" \"Baths,\" Menelaus said longingly. Clytemnestra's shoulders slumped. \"A bath,\" she said faintly, \"sounds lovely.\" \"As does dinner,\" Agamemnon said. \"Food,\" Menelaus said in the same longing voice. There was lodging as well, as usual near a place of healing. The pools themselves were not part of the shrine itself, though they were said to ease the aches of age. Certainly, they were relaxing. Agamemnon thought if he stayed in them long enough, the knot in his shoulder from holding the reins might in fact loosen one day. Curiously enough, it was from neither the bath attendants nor the priests that they learned about Helen. Halfway through nodding off over dinner, Menelaus said, \"By the way, your sister was here.\" \"What!?\" Clytemnestra said, with Mica's \"When?!\" and Critylla's \"How??\" close behind. Agamemnon swatted his brother up-side the head. \"Ow! What was that for?\" \"For that 'by the way',\" Agamemnon said. \"Waiting this long to say something. Spill.\" \"Now,\" Clytemnestra agreed. \"Well, that's what our hostess said. When Theseus passed through ten days ago, with his 'young bride from Sparta,' she insisted on stopping for the night. Bathed in the pools and came out -- how'd she put it? -- 'even lovelier than before.' She was quite taken with her,\" Menelaus said. Then in the silence, \"The hostess with Helen, not the other way around.\" \"Well, of course not,\" Mica said indignantly. Agamemnon pinched the bridge of his nose. \"Swat him again,\" Critylla told him. \"Won't do any good,\" Agamemnon said. \"Besides, that's poor reward for news like this.\" \"You're welcome,\" Menelaus said. \"Bride?!\" Clytemnestra finally erupted. \"BRIDE!?\" \"Which tells us something about his intentions toward her,\" Agamemnon said, then immediately regretted it under Clytemnestra's glare. \"Not,\" she said through gritted teeth. \"Helping.\" Agamemnon turned to his brother. \"Did she say where they were going?\" \"Athens, of course,\" Clytemnestra said. Menelaus nodded. \"Attica.\" Of which Athens was one part of, but never mind. \"So not on to Thessaly -- good.\" To the women's blank looks, he explained, \"Where Peirithous, his sworn brother, is from.\" Clytemnestra closed her eyes. \"I hadn't thought of that.\" Mica shuddered. Agamemnon clapped his hand on Menelaus's shoulder. \"Good job.\" The answering smile was enough to make the whole trip worthwhile. # They were rested enough at dawn to train again -- this time all together. When Agamemnon crossed swords with Clytemnestra, he found Menelaus was right -- she was good. Not strong like a man, but quick. Worse, her flashing breasts and dark triangle below were much harder to ignore, when right in front of him. It was probably just as well they stuck to standard drills instead of sparring freely. Agamemnon then switched to giving Menelaus a new lesson in humility -- his little brother had been feeling pleased with how quickly he'd picked up Mica's trick with the spear. Which was, indeed, a good trick but you could counter it if you knew it was coming. \"Enough,\" Clytemnestra said. \"It's time and past to be off.\" Agamemnon glanced at the sun, a hand's width clear of the sea to the east, and nodded. \"But I want to practice this some more,\" Menelaus said. Taking an interest in weapon-work, wonder of wonders. Not to be discouraged. \"Then do it when we rest the horses,\" Agamemnon told him. North of the Isthmus, the coast road ran straighter and smoother. It was also the only real road, carrying all traffic north and east into the mainland under the looming coastal hills. Oh, there were side-tracks for locals, but between being unfamiliar with them and Clytemnestra's eagerness to catch up with her sister, they took the main way. Besides, this far from home few were likely to recognize them. The hills opened out into a small plain, Megara in the center, while the sun was halfway down the afternoon sky. The acropolis itself was several furlongs inland of the harbor, on a low lonely hill. Agamemnon pointed at Menelaus. \"Ruled by?\" Menelaus gave him a look. \"Megareus.\" Then after a moment, \"Unless he died?\" \"Not that I've heard, though he'd be getting on in years.\" Agamemnon glanced at Clytemnestra, who shrugged -- she'd heard nothing either. Critylla sniffed. \"I'm more worried at the two full squads of foot-soldiers by the gate, than at their commander.\" Agamemnon nodded, though really soldiers were only as good as their captain. \"Something's poked the ant nest.\" To Clytemnestra, \"If you're still interested in not catching anyone's attention, it may be worth the extra time to go around the city.\" She grimaced. \"It might even be faster,\" Critylla added. \"It might, at that,\" Clytemnestra murmured, then shook her head. \"Right -- inland and around.\" As it was, the tracks through the fields were not as confusing as at Kleonai, if only because the plain was narrower. They had nearly circled the city's north wall when they were stopped by a patrol of a hand of chariots plus outriders on horses. All the men were armed and alert. Clytemnestra halted her chariot beside Agamemnon's to parley. \"Hail, in the name of Zeus,\" Agamemnon called out. Men should talk to men. \"Hail,\" the patrol captain replied. He was nearly as old as Atreus, with the same ease of long command. \"State your name and business in Megara.\" Agamemnon twitched -- so much for courtesy. \"With whom do I talk?\" \"Timalcos, son of Megareus, if it's worth your knowing.\" Worth it? For another son of a king, of course it was. \"Agamemnon, son of Atreus.\" In the corner of his eye, Agamemnon saw Clytemnestra close her eyes with a pained look, though it wasn't like he'd named her. Or their mission. Timalcos considered that a moment. \"You're a long way from Mycenae.\" \"We're traveling to Delphi, to consult the oracle for my father.\" \"A bit off the main road as well.\" \"We were misdirected,\" Agamemnon agreed. Timalcos snorted. \"I see.\" He glanced at the city's east gate, nearly as well-guarded as the west gate they'd avoided. \"Well, I suppose you'd have need of haste. Just so you know, the Boeotian road goes north from Eleusis, not here.\" Agamemnon frowned, but nodded. \"Our thanks.\" And then Clytemnestra had to speak up. \"Why the formal welcome?\" she asked, indicating the patrol and guards. \"Are you at war?\" Timalcos smiled wryly, making him look even more like an old campaigner. \"Not yet, gods willing. Let's just say we're none too happy with Theseus right now and leave it at that.\" \"Theseus -- \" Clytemnestra began, but Agamemnon raised a hand to cut her off. \"Is Attica safe, then?\" Since that was the question they would have asked, if their story was true. \"I'd pass through quickly, if I were you, pilgrims to sacred Delphi or no.\" \"I see,\" Agamemnon said. And then, since that was a clear dismissal, \"In that case, we'd best move quickly. May the gods favor you in this endeavor.\" \"And may they protect you in yours.\" At Timalcos's signal, the patrol chariots parted to let them pass through. The soldiers watched them till they passed out of sight behind an olive grove. # When they next rested the horses, at a stream crossing the main road, Clytemnestra walked stiffly over to Agamemnon -- her posture equal parts tired and annoyed. \"So it's Delphi now?\" He shrugged, more concerned by Balius's knee -- it was getting warm, though not yet swollen. \"It worked,\" he said. \"And it's not like I lied about my name.\" \"Ha. Ha,\" she said, completely unamused. \"Very funny.\" Then she sighed. \"Fine, it's a fair hit. It's just, it'd be nice to know these things ahead of time. So we don't tell different stories.\" Agamemnon straightened. That, he supposed, was just as fair a hit. \"Aye. It was the inspiration of the moment.\" She nodded, apparently satisfied, and walked stiffly off again, and this time it was all tiredness. That night, at a prosperous farm halfway to Eleusis, Menelaus got Agamemnon alone as he applied a poultice to Balius's knee. \"What did Timalcos mean, about needing haste to Delphi?\" Agamemnon frowned. \"I don't know,\" he admitted. It was a small worry, compared to the question of how under heaven two men and three women could rescue a stolen princess, but it was enough to make him wonder if he should be having second thoughts. # From the hill looking down at Eleusis, they could see the gate was unguarded. \"This ought to be easier,\" he told Clytemnestra. And with the sun's chariot heading down the slope of the sky, it was time to stable and rest their own horses for the night. And themselves. \"Oi,\" Critylla said, \"behind us.\" They turned and saw a dust-cloud rising from the road behind them. \"Someone's riding hard,\" Menelaus observed. \"Several someones,\" Agamemnon agreed. At least twenty horse, he thought. Maybe more. \"Megareans?\" \"Or whoever they were afraid of,\" Agamemnon suggested. \"Oh no,\" Clytemnestra said softly. \"Or maybe not,\" Agamemnon went on. \"No, no, no, no,\" she insisted. \"Ma'am?\" Mica said. \"Pray that I'm wrong,\" Clytemnestra said, \"because otherwise it's a short ride to Hades.\" Mica and Critylla looked at each other and paled. Clytemnestra whipped her horses into a quick canter. What on earth --? With a last glance at the cloud, Agamemnon followed. It did no good. Clytemnestra's brothers caught up with them outside the town wall -- together with twenty-two men, all riding horses instead of encumbering chariots. Castor leapt astride Clytemnestra's off-horse and reined it in, while two riders closed on either side of Balius and Xanthus and halted them. Before Agamemnon could so much as drop reins and draw sword, Polydeuces had jumped aboard their chariot and thrown Agamemnon and Menelaus out on the ground. As Agamemnon rolled to a stop, two men were already upon him, a sword at his throat and boots on his hands. A heartbeat later, a hand grabbed his tunic and hauled him upright. The two coldest blue eyes he'd ever seen pierced his gaze. \"Abduct my sister, will you?\" Clytemnestra screamed something, but Agamemnon didn't hear it over the smack of Polydeuces's fist on his jaw. Pain and bright darkness and confusion. As he slowly shook it off, he heard her shouting, repeatedly, that she wasn't being abducted, that they were helping, to stop it. Her words were stopped by a slap, the sound of which brought Agamemnon fully to. He was still held up by his tunic, cloth bunched tight under his armpits and feet barely touching the ground -- which put him eye to eye with Polydeuces. The twins were no more than a handful of years older than him, but that span felt like a gulf. They were mature warriors, as dangerous as freshly sharpened blades and just as bright. He ought to fight back. He had to. But he didn't have the chance. Polydeuces looked at him, lean face drawn in a contemptuous sneer. \"You are?\" he asked, giving Agamemnon a shake. \"Agamemnon, son of Atreus.\" That he kept his voice level was a small thing to be proud of, but he was. \"And is that your story, too -- that you're out to 'rescue' my little sister?\" \"Clytemnestra asked,\" and he swallowed to keep his voice from cracking, \"for our assistance.\" Polydeuces made a disgusted sound and threw him back to the ground. This time, soldiers didn't bother covering him with swords. \"Well, you can go back,\" Polydeuces said. \"We,\" Castor said, cupping Clytemnestra's cheek with his hand, \"will take care of this.\" \"Take our sister with you,\" Polydeuces said. \"Athens will fall,\" Castor said. \"And we'll send Theseus to the underworld,\" the brothers said together. Clytemnestra swallowed. \"Take Athens? You and what army?\" Castor gestured west, and Agamemnon looked up at the chariots and horsemen, over a hundred, riding down the hill towards town. \"That army.\" \"Oh crap,\" Menelaus whispered, and Agamemnon silently agreed. So much for being a man. So much for being brave. \"How,\" Clytemnestra started, then swallowed herself. \"How did you get here so fast?\" \"We got home soon after you disappeared without a trace,\" Polydeuces said. \"And rode hard all the way,\" Castor continued. \"They tried to stop us in Megara,\" Polydeuces said. \"Had to kill a few captains before they'd let us through. Or we'd have caught up sooner.\" Timalcos? Agamemnon fleetingly wondered. He hoped not. His legs had probably stopped trembling enough that he could stand. He had to push himself up, but he made it to his feet. \"You, though,\" Castor said, looking at him for the first time, \"aren't worth bothering with.\" \"Go home, little sister,\" Polydeuces said. At their joint signal, the Spartans warriors all mounted. As he turned his horse's around towards Eleusis, Castor looked at Agamemnon one last time. \"Return her or die.\" And then they galloped off, leaving the five in a cloud of dust and Agamemenon, at least, with a chest that felt empty. Oh crap, indeed. Agamemnon limped over to Menelaus -- his left knee didn't want to take his weight. His brother was dusty but not bloody. He offered his hand -- Menelaus looked up bleakly and took it. On his feet, he looked steadier than Agamemnon felt. \"You hurt?\" Menelaus shook his head. \"Not on the outside.\" What was next? Oh, yes -- Balius and Xanthus. Agamemnon turned and limped over. The mares were skittish, but unharmed. He gentled them with soft noises. Soon he felt able to stand without fear of toppling over. \"Never mind them,\" Clytemnestra said at his shoulder, \"how are you?\" He looked at her. How could he possibly answer that? She caught his chin and turned his head, looking at where Polydeuces had punched him. She winced, and thinking about it, he supposed it did hurt. She held up a damp rag and started cleaning the side of his face, carefully working around the worst bruise. \"Very, very tired,\" he finally told her. She nodded. \"They have that effect on people.\" Agamemnon took a deep breath. \"I see why some call them Godborn.\" \"My mother,\" Clytemnestra said, \"is not an adulteress.\" Her voice had the same coldness as her brothers -- nearly throwing Agamemnon back into a panic. \"O-of course not,\" he quickly said. \"I spoke only of their reputation.\" He almost added that, besides, it would be no slur on Leda to have bedded Zeus, but the sharp blue of Clytemnestra's eyes suggested he hold off on that. She hmphed, but continued cleaning his face. \"There,\" she finally said with a nod. \"My thanks.\" He touched the swelling tenderly. Well, he'd had worse. Or just as bad, anyway. He took another deep breath. \"So, shall we go?\" Clytemnestra nodded, then looked at him oddly. \"Go where?\" \"Home.\" Where else? She pinched the bridge of her nose. \"So much for your honor.\" She looked at him, blue eyes hard. \"Remember that? Your 'word' that you would see this through?\" Protests tumbled through his head faster than he could pick one to stammer out -- that her brothers would rescue Helen, that it was pointless with just the five of them, that word given to a woman didn't matter. \"Just remember,\" she went on, \"that my brothers know our plans.\" That caught him. Her brothers knew that he'd vowed to help. If Agamemnon called off now, they'd spread the word -- and he'd lose his honor before he'd had a chance to establish it. And if he didn't break his word, they'd kill him. Oh crap didn't begin to cover it. Menelaus marched over to Agamemnon. \"Town,\" he said, pointing at the gate a few furlongs away. \"Shelter. Food.\" Then, when Agamemnon didn't respond, \"NOW.\" His face was more determined than Agamemnon had ever seen before. He nodded, though the movement hurt his jaw. \"Right. Food and shelter for the night.\" For now, anyway. # Agamemnon lay awake on his pallet in a shelter off the sacred way leading to the Eleusian shrine, listening to Menelaus snore lightly. It was totally unfair that Polydeuces, by ordering him to give up, had ensured that he couldn't. It was enough to convince him the twins really were Godborn. From now on, he told himself, he'd think through ALL the options BEFORE acting. # In the morning, even with sleep made restless with dreams of being smacked up and down his father's hall, Agamemnon felt steadier. Steady enough to tell Clytemnestra over their shared breakfast, \"I am sorry, for yesterday. I was -- in shock.\" Clytemnestra looked him over, then slowly nodded. \"Those assholes are shocking.\" He nodded. \"I'll be better prepared, next time.\" With a sword already drawn and a knife sheath on each thigh, at the least. Maybe a troop of archers behind him as well. \"Ready to go on?\" she asked. \"Ready,\" he confirmed. And maybe, if he lived that lie, it would become truth. Ivory become horn. \"Yes, but go on to where?\" Critylla asked as she broke a second loaf of bread. Clytemnestra whirled on her. \"Athens, of course.\" \"And walk into your brothers again?\" \"She's right,\" Agamemnon said, crouching beside Critylla. His knee protested slightly, but not as much as his jaw when he chewed. \"We need a plan. And information.\" To think it through beforehand. Clytemnestra turned up her hand. \"We go there, sneak around them, and get inside.\" Agamemnon and Critylla exchanged a look. Clytemnestra might be good with a sword, but she was no tactician. Agamemnon sat back on his heels. \"Let's start with what we do know.\" Then when no one replied, \"Which would be?\" Mica nodded. \"Castor and Polydeuces and their army passed through town without stopping to sack it, then went on to Athens.\" \"The baker said,\" Critylla added, \"he'd just heard they've set siege to the citadel, but no one knows any more.\" Menelaus hurried up, taking a bundle out from under his cloak. \"Sorry I'm late -- here's the cheese.\" \"About time,\" Clytemnestra grumped. Agamemnon looked at his brother. \"I suppose you got caught up, talking with someone?\" Menelaus ducked his head. \"Sorry.\" \"No, no,\" Agamemnon said, and patted the ground beside him. \"Sit. We were just sharing everything we know.\" Menelaus blinked, dropped beside him, and started ticking off items. \"Athens is under siege. Athens has been taken by storm. Athens has repulsed the attack. Theseus is leading the defense. Theseus isn't there. Theseus -- \" \"What?!\" three women's voices said at once. \" -- got married again.\" \"Back up one,\" Agamemnon told him. \"Theseus isn't in Athens?\" He accepted a chunk of bread and cheese from Critylla. \"Thanks.\" \"Why wouldn't he be?\" Clytemnestra said. \"Mr glmm blffth,\" Menelaus answered, then swallowed. \"Because he got married again?\" \"What does that have to do with anything?\" Agamemnon asked. Menelaus dropped his bread and cheese in his lap and continued ticking off, \"Theseus married a Spartan princess in Eleusis, the moment he reached Attic soil. Theseus married Helen in Athens. Theseus married her at his mother's home. Oh, and get this one -- Theseus married a Trojan princess.\" \"Trojan?\" Clytemnestra said. \"As in Troy in Ionia?\" Menelaus grinned. \"I know -- wild, isn't it?\" Agamemnon wondered if knowing nothing was better than knowing too much. Something niggled at him, though. Something about... \"Theseus's mother,\" he said suddenly. \"Aethra -- isn't she from Megara?\" \"The man said she's in Aphidna,\" Menelaus said. \"Made it sound like outskirts of Athens.\" Oh, Agamemnon thought. Oh. \"I thought Athens was too small to have outskirts,\" Clytemnestra said. \"If Theseus is such a great hero, why hasn't he taken a bigger city to rule, instead of keeping to the small citadel of Athens his father held?\" \"No,\" Agamemnon said, thoughts too jumbled to come out correctly. \"I mean, yes, Athens is small, or so I hear. But Aphidna, it's north and east, on the road to Aulis.\" He was hazy on the details, but he remembered that much. They all looked at him. \"You're saying he took Helen north to Thessaly?\" \"No, I'm saying I think we have a trail,\" Agamemnon said. Clytemnestra narrowed her eyes considering. \"Boy,\" Critylla said, \"were there any more market stories?\" Menelaus shook his head. \"That's the lot.\" \"Athens is a dead end for us,\" Agamemnon told Clytemnestra. \"This may also be a dead end, but we don't know yet. And more importantly, your brothers aren't checking it out.\" \"Afraid of them?\" Clytemnestra said. \"More clever than them,\" he countered. Which got him a snort. \"The muscleheads.\" \"We can always circle back to Athens, if the trail is false.\" After another moment, Clytemnestra nodded. \"To Aphidna,\" she agreed. The five hurried through the rest of their meal and got horses ready. As they did so, Agamemnon said to Menelaus, \"Told you we'd go hunting.\" Menelaus blinked, and then smiled. \"You said we'd use our spears, though.\" \"As for that,\" Agamemnon said, \"we'll have to see what quarry we find.\" # Attica was a wide country -- easy riding, but much larger than Agamemnon had expected. The town of Aphidna turned out to be most of the way to Aulis, north over the central hills and overlooking the Euboean Straight. Late afternoon, they were still nowhere close, and they'd pushed Balius harder than Agamemnon liked. All the horses were tiring, after this long a journey, even fed with grain. They lodged with another farmer. His wife gave them dinner from her hastily expanded pot and word that Theseus and Helen had passed through last market-day, heading north. It was all Agamemnon could do to only grin in triumph -- the trail was hot, and it was real. Clytemnestra flushed. He let Critylla and Mica talk her out of trying to press on through the dark night of a waning moon on horses not up for it. Instead, he questioned the farmer's wife further and learned that no, neither Theseus nor his pretty bride had come back -- still up north, far as she knew. In Aphidna or beyond? No way of knowing without following the trail. He was as eager to follow it as Clytemnestra, but that'd have to wait till morning. After, he went into the stable to check Balius's poultice in the fading daylight. Her knee was much improved. If they didn't push too hard or too long, tomorrow, she should be fine. And from talking with the farmer, they should reach Aphidna by noon. Agamemnon leaned against the stable wall, scratching Xanthus and thinking about Clytemnestra. She was a king's daughter through and through, protecting her sister with a single-mindedness that was almost -- well, worthy of a man. And if not able to defy her older brothers, she could stand up to them without flinching. And she was of an age to be married. Lost in thought, he didn't hear her approach till she stepped into the stable. \"Agamemnon?\" \"In here,\" he said, and with a last pat for Xanthus stepped out of the stall. Clytemnestra, silhouetted against the darkening sky, wore her cloak against the evening chill. \"How is she?\" He glanced into Balius's stall. \"Should be good.\" \"You really do care for your horses, almost as much as your brother.\" \"Of course.\" That's what men do. A pause, then, \"I never asked -- what are their names?\" \"Balius and Xanthus.\" A small choked sound. \"You named your chariot horses Dappled and Yellow?\" \"They're fine names,\" he said defensively. \"Accurate, too.\" With that, another pause. Think before you act, he reminded himself. But nonetheless he suddenly said, \"My future isn't certain.\" She stirred, but in the dim light he couldn't see her face. He went on, \"I am my father's oldest son, but he favors my younger brother.\" \"Menelaus?\" she asked, puzzled. \"Half-brother, I mean -- Aegisthus.\" \"Ah.\" He still couldn't tell what she was thinking. \"Nothing is certain -- Aegisthus is still too young, and there's... rumors about his paternity. With a powerful father-in-law, I could still take the throne after Atreus.\" She drew herself up. \"Politics again.\" He grimaced, though she could no more see his face than he could the distaste no doubt on hers. \"In the line of Tantalus and Pelops, it's play politics or die.\" She said nothing, only stood still. Finally, \"And why do you tell me this?\" He wanted to say he meant to approach Tyndareus about marrying her, and ask whether she would agree or argue against it. He pulled the reins on the impulse. Give yourself, and her, time to think it through. Instead, he replied, \"Now's not the time to answer that. Once we have Helen back, ask that question again.\" Unexpectedly, she chuckled. \"You are deceptively subtle, for a man.\" He spent the time falling asleep wondering what she meant by those last three words. # Their first sight of Aphidna was not promising: a scattered collection of square houses stacked on a hillside but otherwise barely fortified. \"Are we sure this is it?\" Clytemnestra asked again. \"The man insisted that we couldn't mistake it,\" Critylla said patiently. \"Mistake it for a town, that is,\" Clytemnestra muttered. Menelaus snickered. \"Shall we?\" Agamemnon said. \"Why bother?\" Clytemnestra said. \"Theseus would never hide something as precious as Helen in a -- a -- a midden like this.\" \"A maiden in a midden?\" Menelaus said. Agamemnon frowned at him. If the boy was going to make bad jokes, at least he could make them dirty. \"I think it's rather quaint,\" Mica suddenly said. \"Like a mountain village.\" Clytemnestra rounded on her. \"My sister doesn't do 'quaint'.\" \"Exactly,\" Menelaus said, \"you don't do quaint when you're a que-- \" Agamemnon and Clytemnestra both glared at him, but it was Critylla who whapped him upside the head. \"Ow! I was just trying to lighten the mood.\" Clytemnestra shook her head. \"Let's get this over with,\" and started back to her chariot. \"But I -- \" Menelaus started, but Agamemnon caught him by the head and turned it to face him. \"She's a king's daughter -- some jokes, you just don't make, okay?\" \"Fine,\" Menelaus muttered, and shook off Agamemnon's grasp. At the top of the hill, they found half of the town had not been visible from below -- the more prosperous half. This looked more promising, and indeed, Clytemnestra looked a little less sour. In the nearly empty agora, Agamemnon pulled up in front of a wine-seller's shop where two old men sat in the sun against the wall. \"Greetings, elders. We've a message for Aethra -- is she in residence?\" \"Aye, sonny,\" the younger and sprier one said. \"Left lane off the square, up the slope to the largest house. Even someone my age couldn't miss it.\" \"Is the young bride with her, as well?\" The old men cackled. \"You've heard of her, eh? Aye, you may catch a glimpse of her as well -- if you're lucky.\" \"I pray Hermes I am,\" Agamemnon said. They needed luck. \"And Aphrodite,\" the old man replied. With a laugh, Agamemnon thanked him and twitched the horses into a walk. At the inn where the buildings thinned and grew larger, Agamemnon pulled over into the stable yard. Clytemnestra came up beside him. \"Aphrodite?\" she said, voice shimmering with anger. Agamemnon blinked. \"His joke, not mine.\" \"She's only twelve summers old.\" The words sounded as if she'd bitten them out of the air. \"Which is why I'm not looking to her for a bride.\" \"You're looking for a bride?\" Menelaus asked, then took a step back, hands up, when Agamemnon and Clytemnestra turned on him. Agamemnon sighed, then told him, \"Not yet, but I will be soon. That or our father will.\" \"Oh.\" \"Indeed,\" Clytemnestra muttered. But her anger had passed. She hadn't thought he...? \"Why are we stopping here?\" Critylla asked. Agamemnon pointed at Menelaus, who immediately replied, \"Scouting is easier on foot.\" And when Agamemnon held up two fingers, \"And -- gossip from the stable?\" \"Right.\" Menelaus had shown him the value of that. Clytemnestra let out a slow breath through close lips, then nodded. From the stable-hands they learned that, yes, Aethra lived just up the way. Theseus weren't here, though, only those new guards he left behind -- the ones to stay clear of when they came down into town to drink of a night off. None of them had seen the young bride, but they'd talked with thems who had -- everyone agreed she was a beauty. The details were vague, but Agamemnon guessed there were at least a double-handful of soldiers. On a hunch, he asked about the shrine on the hill above them, and learned that yes, there was one up there, to the club-foot god some called Hermes. Better yet, a path up was just behind the inn. For luck like that, it was worth actually visiting the shrine to make an offering to Hermes, lame or not. Silently, Agamemnon vowed to give the god his best dagger if he survived the day. All five took their weapons, spear-blades wrapped to hide their glint. They climbed the slope silently. Partway up, a house clearly larger than the others came into view -- the old man was right, they couldn't have missed it. As for guards, Agamemnon saw three, all facing the lane. \"Are the rest around the other side, or just off duty?\" Critylla murmured. \"Let's get a little higher, then circle round,\" he murmured back. A goat-track leading behind an outcrop brought them to a couple furlongs of the house -- compound, really. As he crouched behind the rock, Agamemnon felt sweat clinging to his tunic, and didn't know if it was from the noon sun or nerves. \"I don't see anyone,\" Clytemnestra said. Agamemnon shook his head. Either the guards were well hidden on this side, or... At a building's corner, movement -- Critylla had her bow drawn and aimed before he knew it. An old man came into view, holding the halter lead for a pony. A matronly woman walked beside it, talking with the riding girl. All were unarmed. Just as there was no mistaking the house, there was no mistaking Helen of Sparta. Agamemnon clapped his hand on Clytemnestra's shoulder to keep her from standing. \"Wait for it.\" \"So close,\" she whispered, but settled back. He sympathized -- he was also trained for action, not sitting. Helen and attendants and her placid pony -- shouldn't a girl her age be on something with more spirit? -- headed out on a path up the hill, to the right of their outcrop. No guards followed, or even seemed to be watching. Surely it wasn't this easy? After a few dozen heartbeats, Mica tapped Clytemnestra's shoulder, and pointed at the goat-track, as it crossed hillside and Helen's path. Clytemnestra nodded, and Agamemnon let her stand. They followed her in a line, women before, men guarding their rear. Agamemnon kept more of an eye on the house than his footing, but still it was Menelaus who stumbled. They were closer than a small child's spear throw when Helen's party saw them and stopped. Clytemnestra called out, \"Helen!\" \"Clytie!\" Helen hopped off the pony and ran toward her sister. The next several moments were filled with hugs and squeals and overlapping conversation -- half of it \"missed you\" and \"so worried\" and the other half \"Uncle Theseus\" this and \"Uncle Theseus\" that. While that went on, the attendants led the pony up. Agamemnon addressed the older woman. \"The gods be with you -- Aethra?\" A guess, but she nodded graciously. \"And with you -- Clytemnestra, daughter of Tyndareus, and...?\" \"Agamemnon, son of Atreus -- my brother, Menelaus.\" Who was, he realized, standing rooted like a willow, staring at Helen like a moon-eyed calf. Oh gods, not now -- not him. Not that Helen wasn't the beauty everyone said: dark eyes, lustrous hair, clear brow, and a voice like a sparkling stream. Which was now protesting: \"No! If I leave now, then I won't get the very special gift Uncle Theseus is bringing me.\" \"Is that where he is now?\" Agamemnon asked her. \"Yes, and it's been days already!\" \"But Helen,\" Clytemnestra said, \"Father is -- \" \"And it was so far, the trip from Sparta. My feet are still blistered.\" \"Now, Helen, they are almost healed,\" Aethra said. Why had he thought this was going to be easy? It was going to be an even longer trip back to Sparta, with a spoiled princess like this. Agamemnon cleared his throat, and -- was that? Yes -- from in front of the house, the clear ring of sword on sword, and again. Aethra looked sharply at him. \"Nay, not ours,\" told her. \"You'd all best come with us.\" Another clang, followed by a shout. Aethra nodded, reluctantly -- only half-believing him. \"There's a hidden cave -- with supplies,\" and indicated the hill above the outcrop. Agamemnon took her arm and pulled her forward. \"Lead on,\" he told her, giving her a push. \"And quickly.\" Helen protested, but Clytemnestra cut her off with a sharp, \"Helen -- drill!\" And wonder of wonders, with a worried look behind her, the girl shut up. And even hurried, despite her blistered heel. Critylla sent the old man and the pony, with a slap on its haunch, around the hill as a blind. Agamemnon first heard the hoof-beats behind them soon after they ducked under the thin pine trees. In a clearing, he and Mica turned and unwrapped their spears -- just as the horses caught up. Riden by Castor and Polydeuces. Agamemnon held steady against the storm of their arrival -- but not steady enough to get in the first thrust as he should have with a long weapon. He fended off Castor's sword thrust and countered with the spear butt against the horse's flank. It was the last blow Agamemnon got in, as further horsemen thundered up. In another moment, he was disarmed, and some unknown soldier's sword was at his throat. Dammit. # Helen's brothers took charge of her, of course -- along with credit for rescuing her. It had taken them a couple days to reduce the citadel of Athens, and only then had learned that Theseus wasn't there. And now they were here, and the quarry theirs, for all Agamemnon and Clytemnestra had caught it first. The real blow came from Castor, however. \"Go home,\" he said, returning Agamemnon's spear with a toss. Agamemnon caught it, single-handed, frowning at the man. Why had he gloated as he said that? Polydeuces tossed Menelaus his spear in turn, then paused. \"Oh, that's right -- you don't have a home.\" \"What?\" Menelaus said. The brothers looked at each other, then at the twins. Polydeuces smiled like a hornet. \"While you were gone, Thyestes deposed his brother Atreus -- your uncle holds the scepter of Mycenae now. He's even named his bastard son Aegisthus heir.\" \"No home, no future,\" Castor agreed. Agamemnon could say nothing, feel nothing. \"He's dead?\" Menelaus said, as if the words meant something. Polydeuces only smirked. \"You bastards!\" Menelaus said. The two only laughed as they went back to taking charge of everything. \"Dammit!\" Menelaus shouted. Agamemnon couldn't agree more, though his anger wasn't at the twins, not any more. \"It's the same thing,\" he said slowly. \"What?\" Menelaus said. \"It's the same damn family story,\" Agamemnon said, more firmly. \"It just keeps happening.\" Which sobered Menelaus. He knew their sordid family history as well as anyone, what Atreus and Thyestes had survived. Agamemnon whirled and clasped his brother's forearm. \"But it stops with us.\" \"Agamemnon?\" Menelaus looked into his brother's eyes, his own dark eyes confused. \"Let us swear, the two of us -- we'll never be like them. The curse of Tantalus's line dies with our father. No more fighting, not between us.\" Menelaus swallowed, then nodded. \"I swear, on Zeus the Father.\" \"On Zeus the Father,\" Agamemnon agreed. Later, they would solemnize it over a sacrifice on the god's altar, but the true oath started here. They had each other's backs. Like brothers should -- like blood brothers. The brothers embraced, and Menelaus started crying. Agamemnon wanted to cry himself, but now he was too numb. Later. Later he would mourn his father, even the hard man that he was, and later still he would somehow avenge him. But for now, he held his younger brother and comforted him. He had nothing else, now. # Back at Aethra's house, the looting was complete and the Spartans were preparing to leave. Even Aethra was to be carried off as a slave. Castor ranted over how no one knew where Theseus was, but no matter how much he howled, the trail was cold -- as if the man had slipped under the earth. There was nothing else for them but to head back to Sparta with their sisters. The twins really were almost like a divine wind, a tempest that blew through everything they touched, with no one to hinder them. Even the pouting Helen didn't talk back to her brothers. In the midst of the packing, Clytemnestra came up to Agamemnon and Menelaus. \"Since my brothers won't have thanked you, I supposed it's up to me. The house of Tyndareus is in your debt.\" Agamemnon bowed slightly, as did Menelaus. \"You are welcome, daughter of Tyndareus.\" After a moment, Menelaus added, \"At least you have Helen back unharmed.\" \"And untouched,\" Clytemnestra agreed. \"That,\" Agamemnon said, because it was expected of him, \"is good.\" It was something. Another pause. Clytemnestra coughed, then said, \"You know, those two are almost never home.\" Meaning her brothers. \"Ah. That must make things more comfortable.\" She made an impatient sound. \"What I'm trying to say is, there are worse places to spend your exile than in my father's court.\" Oh. Agamemnon hadn't even gotten as far thinking where they would go now. To Aegialeus maybe, though Argos was too close to Mycenae for safety. \"With you,\" Menelaus said, \"and H-Helen?\" Clytemnestra rolled her eyes, but agreed. \"Agamemnon, can we?\" he asked eagerly. Wearily, Agamemnon nodded. Then to Clytemnestra, \"We thank you for your offer.\" \"It is the least my father can do, for what you've done.\" Agamemnon watched as his brother hurried off to tell Mica and Critylla -- he doubted the boy could say two words to Helen herself. Softly, to Clytemnestra, he said, \"You know, I haven't got the heart to tell him it's hopeless, with her.\" She nodded sadly, then said, \"Well, stranger things have happened.\" Indeed, though he could think of precious few just then. Then his brain caught up with what she wasn't saying. He cleared his throat. \"Is this your way of asking that question from last night?\" She turned to look at him with her bright blue eyes. \"Why, yes -- yes it is.\" \"Then you already know the answer,\" he said, gesturing towards Menelaus, still excited at the prospect of spending exile in Sparta. An excitement that Agamemnon didn't share -- though he felt a stirring of hope. With the backing of a father-in-law like Tyndareus, he'd have a chance of retaking Mycenae. If he could win Clytemnestra's hand, that is. With a small smile and an even smaller bow, Clytemnestra left him.",

      "\"Well then,\" he said in an imitation of his uncle's heartiest manner -- the one Thyestes put on when he was about to say something the most cutting, \"before our farewells, I bid you one favor.\"",
      "\"Yes?\"",
      "As if, as guest, she could deny it.",
      "\"Your name.\"",
      "Her true name.",
      "If Clothia were a dog, she would have snarled.",
      "As a human, and a noble at that, she only smiled with all the sweetness of honey mixed with wormwood.",
      "\"Clytemnestra.\"",
      "\"Tyndareus's daughter?!\"",
      "Menelaus blurted at his shoulder.",
      "The Spartan king's daughter bowed to him, mouth set as if it held an unripe olive.",
      "\"But what are you --!\"",
      "he began, but Agamemnon interrupted, \"Brother!",
      "Courtesy to our guest.\"",
      "Clytemnestra looked at him, then glanced at the boundary stone -- the one beyond which they would no longer be guests.",
      "Agamemnon smiled sweetly.",
      "\"Again, our thanks,\" Clytemnestra said.",
      "\"May the gods protect you on your journey, no matter where it takes you,\" Agamemnon said pointedly.",
      "Clytemnestra looked at him a moment, then her shoulders slumped slightly.",
      "\"Let me guess -- you know the way around Kleonai without asking for directions.\"",
      "Agamemnon bowed slightly.",
      "It was that or grin like a lunatic.",
      "\"We would be glad of your continued assistance,\" she said, voice resigned.",
      "\"Lady!\"",
      "Critylla protested, even as Menelaus squawked.",
      "Agamemnon stepped on his brother's sandaled foot, while Clytemnestra cut Critylla off with a gesture.",
      "\"They've shown themselves to be honorable hosts,\" she said.",
      "\"Always,\" Agamemnon agreed.",
      "\"By Nemean Zeus, you have nothing to fear from us.\"",
      "\"By Nemean Zeus,\" Menelaus echoed hastily.",
      "Mica shifted the spear in hand, then glanced down at the sanctuary just visible below.",
      "The looks both she and Critylla gave the brothers promised that what the will of the gods didn't protect, the hands of women would.",
      "Though in truth, Agamemnon had no intentions that way -- not when there was an adventure to be had.",
      "And as for Menelaus, he was still more interested in horses and hounds than girls.",
      "Clytemnestra let out a breath.",
      "\"Then let us be off, while the sun still shines.\"",
      "As Agamemnon came round to step into his chariot, Menelaus caught his arm.",
      "\"Brother,\" he said through gritted teeth.",
      "\"Hunting with Aegialeus can wait,\" Agamemnon told him.",
      "\"Besides, from here, this is the fastest way back.\"",
      "\"One day, brother -- \" \" -- but not yet,\" Agamemnon said.",
      "\"Not while the gods favor the bold.\"",
      "Menelaus looked at him a moment, then just shook his head as he released his arm.",
      "The way down was faster than up, even with holding the horses back -- and, at times, the chariots as well.",
      "Agamemnon and Menelaus switched off who drove and who pulled.",
      "It was longer work than Agamemnon expected, but he wasn't about to complain when the women didn't.",
      "It was probably just as well the parties had to stay too far apart to talk.",
      "Finally the slope flattened, though the road still went downhill through scattered oaks and then clustered pines -- flat enough that after resting the horses they could all ride.",
      "The sun was still just over the western mountains when they reached the sanctuary of Nemean Zeus, below the cave where the Lion had denned.",
      "Menelaus eagerly pointed out the latter, and the valley where Heracles had fought it.",
      "\"We'd best lodge here,\" Agamemnon said, nodding at the guest-houses for pilgrims that lined the main road up from Kleonai.",
      "\"There's little else between here and town.\"",
      "Clytemnestra glanced at the disappearing sun, and nodded reluctantly.",
      "And truth be told, Agamemnon was glad of stopping.",
      "Mica and Menelaus both drooped as well, though Critylla looked fine -- her stamina was disturbing.",
      "Separate lodgings for men and women, of course, though they bartered together for their evening meal.",
      "Critylla made short work of preparing it while Mica borrowed a coal for an outdoor hearth-fire.",
      "As meals went, even without meat and with sour wine, it was good.",
      "It had been a long day.",
      "Agamemnon, sitting across from Clytemnestra, considered her face in the flickering firelight -- her strong nose and straight brow.",
      "She stared into the coals, frowning.",
      "Time, he thought, to bring this to a head.",
      "When she noticed his gaze, he said, \"I've been patient enough.",
      "So where are you going?\" Critylla stirred and Mica choked back a protest, but Clytemnestra only blinked -- remembering, no doubt, that her privacy was no longer bound by guest-law.",
      "She took a considering breath, then said, \"Theseus of Athens abducted my sister, and we're going to rescue her.\"",
      "It was Agamemnon's turn to blink.",
      "\"You mean Helen?\"",
      "\"Ah -- you've heard of her.\"",
      "Who hadn't?",
      "Harpers up and down the peninsula had sung her praises since she was old enough to dimple a smile.",
      "\"Is Theseus really that stupid?\" he said, at the same time Menelaus said, \"Is Helen really that pretty?\" Clytemnestra rolled her eyes, and Agamemnon swatted Menelaus upside the head.",
      "\"Ow! Hey!\"",
      "\"Thank you,\" Clytemnestra said.",
      "\"Don't mention it,\" Agamemnon said.",
      "\"Well I will,\" Menelaus said.",
      "\"That hurt!\"",
      "\"And in answer to your questions, yes,\" Clytemnestra said.",
      "\"Then why?\" Agamemnon asked.",
      "\"Does stupidity need a reason beyond beauty?\" Agamemnon waved that aside.",
      "\"I mean, why you?\" Clytemnestra looked grim.",
      "\"I always promised my little sister I'd protect her.\"",
      "\"Ah.\"",
      "Agamemnon knew about those sorts of promises.",
      "All the times he'd taken the beating for Menelaus, or stopped their half-brother Aegisthus from picking on him.",
      "\"Oh,\" Menelaus said, and then glanced at his brother.",
      "Then, \"But wait -- how are you going to take Athens with just two soldiers?\" \"Three,\" Agamemnon corrected.",
      "Hadn't he seen her sword belt?",
      "\"Cities are defended against armies, not against a couple 'mere women'.\"",
      "\"What do you mean -- sneak in?\" Menelaus said.",
      "\"Use deception?\" Clytemnestra waggled her hand in indifference.",
      "But then, what did honor mean to a woman, anyway?",
      "No more than her name, and she'd already shown what she thought of that.",
      "This promised to be a truly interesting adventure.",
      "It was all Agamemnon could do to keep from grinning, even as Menelaus started to argue.",
      "# In the morning, the Spartans did indeed train -- with an emphasis on sword, spear, and bow over athletics -- and did it like any youth.",
      "For all his speculation the day before, Agamemnon resolutely ignored them as he drilled his brother with sword alone -- training was too important.",
      "The sight of the naked women, though, made Menelaus more than usually distracted.",
      "\"That's -- \" Agamemnon whacked his shoulder with the flat of his sword. \"",
      "-- what you get for gawking.\"",
      "\"Ow!",
      "But it's not -- \" Menelaus barely parried the next blow. \"",
      "-- what you're supposed to look at.\"",
      "\"But they're -- \" \" -- not who you're fighting.\"",
      "Agamemnon whacked the other arm.",
      "\"Watch the sword, not the sheathes.\"",
      "Menelaus flushed even more at the double-meaning.",
      "This was not the time for him to suddenly get old enough to notice the other sex -- not when it kept him from defending himself.",
      "Agamemnon snarled and knocked the sword out of his brother's hand, then brought blade up to his throat.",
      "\"That's four times dead.\"",
      "He pointed at the sword in the dust.",
      "\"Concentrate!",
      "Or you really will get killed.\"",
      "The women finished first, leaving Agamemnon no reward for his virtue.",
      "By the time they were ready to leave, Menelaus had died three more times but was finally getting his guard up, and even managed a couple counter-attacks.",
      "It was just...",
      "so frustrating.",
      "For all his vows, Agamemnon wouldn't be able to protect his brother forever -- he had to make sure he could survive on his own.",
      "They left Nemea soon after, on the smooth road that let all of them ride.",
      "Only as they departed did Agamemnon realize he also hadn't seen how well the women could fight.",
      "\"I was trying to tell you,\" Menelaus said.",
      "\"They're good.\"",
      "Agamemnon grimaced but didn't respond.",
      "Which meant he had to hear his brother go on and on about the neat trick Mica had used with the spear to disarm Clytemnestra.",
      "At their rest stop halfway to Kleonai, Agamemnon found himself beside Mica as they tended their respective horses.",
      "She was the same age as him and Clytemnestra, though not as striking at the latter.",
      "\"You've got an admirer,\" he said, \"for your spear-work.\"",
      "She paused to look at him, but he kept his face carefully blank.",
      "\"Do I now?\"",
      "He nodded toward Menelaus.",
      "\"He was quite distracted by it.\"",
      "Mica smiled.",
      "\"Oh, was he now.",
      "By my spear-work.\"",
      "\"So he says.\"",
      "Agamemnon had to work to keep his lips from twitching.",
      "\"Ah, well,\" she turned back to checking her gelding's hind hoof.",
      "\"He's too young for the likes of me.\"",
      "\"Aye,\" Agamemnon agreed.",
      "Balius shifted as he inspected her knee -- she sometimes got inflamed if she pulled for too long.",
      "When she stood up, Mica said, \"You're not bad yourself.\"",
      "Then added, \"With a sword.\"",
      "Agamemnon smiled.",
      "\"It's all in the practice.\"",
      "She politely agreed, hiding a smile of her own.",
      "He would have gone on, but caught sight of Clytemnestra, watching them with a frown.",
      "\"Are we ready to leave?\" she asked.",
      "\"Yes'm,\" Mica said, in her soft Spartan accent.",
      "\"Aye,\" Agamemnon agreed.",
      "As the party prepared to mount, Clytemnestra caught Agamemnon alone, and held up a finger to stop him.",
      "She stared into his face a heartbeat, eyes narrowed.",
      "\"I protect my own,\" she said in a soft voice stiffened with iron resolve.",
      "\"Of course,\" Agamemnon agreed, voice just as low.",
      "\"That's why you're following Helen.\"",
      "\"And don't you forget it.\"",
      "He doubted he would.",
      "He nodded and hopped onto his chariot, saying more loudly, \"Follow me 'round Kleonai, then,\" as if that was what they'd been discussing.",
      "True to his word, though, when the road reached the river plains, he lead the Spartans off between fields, north around the town.",
      "In the olive groves to the east, however, the tracks began crisscrossing like a labyrinth, hiding the main road over the next mountains.",
      "It was easy to follow once you were on it, but it was only marked at the town gate.",
      "Twice he thought he had it, only to realize it was another side road for the olive pickers.",
      "It was Menelaus who first pointed out the right way.",
      "\"There!\"",
      "\"Aye,\" Agamemnon agreed and smoothly turned his mares onto it -- heading onward.",
      "The horses could go a little further still, and the sun was barely halfway up the sky.",
      "\"Hey!\"",
      "Menelaus said but subsided when Agamemnon ignored him.",
      "Agamemnon smiled to himself.",
      "They stopped at the well beside another sheep-pen, just before the road headed up the mountain in earnest.",
      "As they rested and fed the horses, Clytemnestra came over to the brothers.",
      "Slowly, almost as if reluctantly, she said, \"Our thanks for all you have done for us.\"",
      "Agamemnon bowed his head for a moment.",
      "\"Zeus strike me if I've been a bad host.\"",
      "Which pulled a chuckle out of her.",
      "\"Nay -- nothing like one.",
      "And Zeus strike me if, like a bad guest, we impose upon you any longer.\"",
      "\"It'll be no imposition at all,\" Agamemnon said smoothly.",
      "\"In that case,\" she began, then realized what he'd said.",
      "\"It 'will'?\" Menelaus finally caught on.",
      "\"Wait, what?\"",
      "\"You're not coming with us,\" Clytemnestra continued, halfway between a command and a question.",
      "\"It would,\" Agamemnon said with a straight face, \"be dishonorable to abandon a rescue mission.\"",
      "Menelaus made a strangled sound.",
      "\"You are not coming with us,\" Clytemnestra said more firmly.",
      "\"Right,\" Menelaus agreed, \"we're already -- ow.\"",
      "Agamemnon kept his foot on his brother's.",
      "\"Of course we are,\" he said to her.",
      "\"My father, Atreus, is a friend of Tyndareus -- we cannot stand aside and not help when his family is in need.\"",
      "\"Ow,\" Menelaus said again.",
      "\"I -- \" Clytemnestra began, then shook her head.",
      "\"Politics,\" she said, voice disgusted.",
      "\"We will rescue Helen,\" Agamemnon said.",
      "\"My word on it.\"",
      "\"Ouch,\" Menelaus said, as if to vary things.",
      "Clytemnestra looked into Agamemnon's eyes.",
      "Hers were a dark blue, he was startled to realize.",
      "She let out her breath, as if concluding his resolve was indeed solid.",
      "\"Fine.",
      "I accept your assistance,\" and then turned with a swirl of her tunic to stalk back to her handmaids.",
      "Agamemnon wanted to sigh himself.",
      "Instead, he let his brother's foot go.",
      "\"THANK you,\" Menelaus muttered.",
      "\"You're welcome,\" Agamemnon replied sweetly.",
      "\"Never mind Aegialeus -- if our father finds out.\"",
      "Mention of Atreus and his likely wrath was almost enough to dampen the spark that drove Agamemnon -- even for such an adventure as this promised to be.",
      "Who knew how far this one would take them?",
      "Menelaus went on, \"Are you really just doing this to stay friendly with Tyndareus?\"",
      "\"Swear to me on our grandfather's name that you wouldn't want to be known for rescuing Helen of Sparta.\"",
      "Agamemnon looked into Menelaus's eyes, and his brother looked away.",
      "\"You can't.\"",
      "Menelaus covered his face with his hand.",
      "\"You owe me,\" he said against his palm.",
      "Agamemnon just laughed.",
      "Menelaus limped over to the horses to console himself in Xanthus's mane.",
      "# Beyond Tenea, they stopped at the top of the pass to look out at the sea: the head of a long deep bay, green below them, blue beyond, and misty at the horizon.",
      "Agamemnon pointed right down the coast.",
      "\"Epidaurus is around the headland.",
      "The island ahead is Salamis, where Telamon rules.",
      "His father, old Aeacus, still holds Aegina with his Myrmidons, the half-hidden island to its right.",
      "And down there, we take the coast road left,\" he gestured along the curving sweep of the shoreline, \"over the Isthmus, through Megara, Eleusis, and then Athens, beyond Salamis.\"",
      "\"It's beautiful,\" Menelaus said, gazing raptly at the ocean.",
      "Clytemnestra chewed her lip thoughtfully.",
      "\"So another three days?\"",
      "\"More like four,\" Agamemnon said, though it was pure guess.",
      "\"Distances are deceiving.\"",
      "She nodded.",
      "\"Then let's get going.\"",
      "# Late the next day, they straggled into the harbor town of Kenchreai, across the Isthmus from Corinth.",
      "The road down to the sea had been rougher than expected, and having never taken it before, Agamemnon made a wrong turn twice.",
      "The coast road itself had wound in and out of every inlet and ridge.",
      "Distance was, indeed, deceiving.",
      "\"We should go on,\" Clytemnestra said.",
      "\"It's still light.\"",
      "\"Princess,\" Agamemnon said with as much patience as he could muster, \"the horses must rest.\"",
      "\"As must we,\" Menelaus added.",
      "Both he and Mica were looking more than a little worn.",
      "\"And eat.\"",
      "\"Besides,\" Critylla said, \"there's a shrine here to Artemis the Healer that was founded by Atalanta.\"",
      "Which made Mica perk up.",
      "\"Oh!",
      "We have to visit that!\"",
      "\"By Atalanta,\" Clytemnestra repeated.",
      "Critylla and Mica nodded in unison.",
      "\"Sometimes, you fangirls are just a little too much,\" Clytemnestra said.",
      "Ignoring her, Critylla went on, \"it's on the north side of town, near to the natural hot baths.\"",
      "\"Baths,\" Menelaus said longingly.",
      "Clytemnestra's shoulders slumped.",
      "\"A bath,\" she said faintly, \"sounds lovely.\"",
      "\"As does dinner,\" Agamemnon said.",
      "\"Food,\" Menelaus said in the same longing voice.",
      "There was lodging as well, as usual near a place of healing.",
      "The pools themselves were not part of the shrine itself, though they were said to ease the aches of age.",
      "Certainly, they were relaxing.",
      "Agamemnon thought if he stayed in them long enough, the knot in his shoulder from holding the reins might in fact loosen one day.",
      "Curiously enough, it was from neither the bath attendants nor the priests that they learned about Helen.",
      "Halfway through nodding off over dinner, Menelaus said, \"By the way, your sister was here.\"",
      "\"What!?\" Clytemnestra said, with Mica's \"When?!\"",
      "and Critylla's \"How??\" close behind.",
      "Agamemnon swatted his brother up-side the head.",
      "\"Ow!",
      "What was that for?\"",
      "\"For that 'by the way',\" Agamemnon said.",
      "\"Waiting this long to say something.",
      "Spill.\"",
      "\"Now,\" Clytemnestra agreed.",
      "\"Well, that's what our hostess said.",
      "When Theseus passed through ten days ago, with his 'young bride from Sparta,' she insisted on stopping for the night.",
      "Bathed in the pools and came out -- how'd she put it?",
      "-- 'even lovelier than before.'",
      "She was quite taken with her,\" Menelaus said.",
      "Then in the silence, \"The hostess with Helen, not the other way around.\"",
      "\"Well, of course not,\" Mica said indignantly.",
      "Agamemnon pinched the bridge of his nose.",
      "\"Swat him again,\" Critylla told him.",
      "\"Won't do any good,\" Agamemnon said.",
      "\"Besides, that's poor reward for news like this.\"",
      "\"You're welcome,\" Menelaus said.",
      "\"Bride?!\"",
      "Clytemnestra finally erupted.",
      "\"BRIDE!?\"",
      "\"Which tells us something about his intentions toward her,\" Agamemnon said, then immediately regretted it under Clytemnestra's glare.",
      "\"Not,\" she said through gritted teeth.",
      "\"Helping.\"",
      "Agamemnon turned to his brother.",
      "\"Did she say where they were going?\" \"Athens, of course,\" Clytemnestra said.",
      "Menelaus nodded.",
      "\"Attica.\"",
      "Of which Athens was one part of, but never mind.",
      "\"So not on to Thessaly -- good.\"",
      "To the women's blank looks, he explained, \"Where Peirithous, his sworn brother, is from.\"",
      "Clytemnestra closed her eyes.",
      "\"I hadn't thought of that.\"",
      "Mica shuddered.",
      "Agamemnon clapped his hand on Menelaus's shoulder.",
      "\"Good job.\"",
      "The answering smile was enough to make the whole trip worthwhile.",
      "# They were rested enough at dawn to train again -- this time all together.",
      "When Agamemnon crossed swords with Clytemnestra, he found Menelaus was right -- she was good.",
      "Not strong like a man, but quick.",
      "Worse, her flashing breasts and dark triangle below were much harder to ignore, when right in front of him.",
      "It was probably just as well they stuck to standard drills instead of sparring freely.",
      "Agamemnon then switched to giving Menelaus a new lesson in humility -- his little brother had been feeling pleased with how quickly he'd picked up Mica's trick with the spear.",
      "Which was, indeed, a good trick but you could counter it if you knew it was coming.",
      "\"Enough,\" Clytemnestra said.",
      "\"It's time and past to be off.\"",
      "Agamemnon glanced at the sun, a hand's width clear of the sea to the east, and nodded.",
      "\"But I want to practice this some more,\" Menelaus said.",
      "Taking an interest in weapon-work, wonder of wonders.",
      "Not to be discouraged.",
      "\"Then do it when we rest the horses,\" Agamemnon told him.",
      "North of the Isthmus, the coast road ran straighter and smoother.",
      "It was also the only real road, carrying all traffic north and east into the mainland under the looming coastal hills.",
      "Oh, there were side-tracks for locals, but between being unfamiliar with them and Clytemnestra's eagerness to catch up with her sister, they took the main way.",
      "Besides, this far from home few were likely to recognize them.",
      "The hills opened out into a small plain, Megara in the center, while the sun was halfway down the afternoon sky.",
      "The acropolis itself was several furlongs inland of the harbor, on a low lonely hill.",
      "Agamemnon pointed at Menelaus.",
      "\"Ruled by?\" Menelaus gave him a look.",
      "\"Megareus.\"",
      "Then after a moment, \"Unless he died?\"",
      "\"Not that I've heard, though he'd be getting on in years.\"",
      "Agamemnon glanced at Clytemnestra, who shrugged -- she'd heard nothing either.",
      "Critylla sniffed.",
      "\"I'm more worried at the two full squads of foot-soldiers by the gate, than at their commander.\"",
      "Agamemnon nodded, though really soldiers were only as good as their captain.",
      "\"Something's poked the ant nest.\"",
      "To Clytemnestra, \"If you're still interested in not catching anyone's attention, it may be worth the extra time to go around the city.\"",
      "She grimaced.",
      "\"It might even be faster,\" Critylla added.",
      "\"It might, at that,\" Clytemnestra murmured, then shook her head.",
      "\"Right -- inland and around.\"",
      "As it was, the tracks through the fields were not as confusing as at Kleonai, if only because the plain was narrower.",
      "They had nearly circled the city's north wall when they were stopped by a patrol of a hand of chariots plus outriders on horses.",
      "All the men were armed and alert.",
      "Clytemnestra halted her chariot beside Agamemnon's to parley.",
      "\"Hail, in the name of Zeus,\" Agamemnon called out.",
      "Men should talk to men.",
      "\"Hail,\" the patrol captain replied.",
      "He was nearly as old as Atreus, with the same ease of long command.",
      "\"State your name and business in Megara.\"",
      "Agamemnon twitched -- so much for courtesy.",
      "\"With whom do I talk?\"",
      "\"Timalcos, son of Megareus, if it's worth your knowing.\"",
      "Worth it?",
      "For another son of a king, of course it was.",
      "\"Agamemnon, son of Atreus.\"",
      "In the corner of his eye, Agamemnon saw Clytemnestra close her eyes with a pained look, though it wasn't like he'd named her.",
      "Or their mission.",
      "Timalcos considered that a moment.",
      "\"You're a long way from Mycenae.\"",
      "\"We're traveling to Delphi, to consult the oracle for my father.\"",
      "\"A bit off the main road as well.\"",
      "\"We were misdirected,\" Agamemnon agreed.",
      "Timalcos snorted.",
      "\"I see.\"",
      "He glanced at the city's east gate, nearly as well-guarded as the west gate they'd avoided.",
      "\"Well, I suppose you'd have need of haste.",
      "Just so you know, the Boeotian road goes north from Eleusis, not here.\"",
      "Agamemnon frowned, but nodded.",
      "\"Our thanks.\"",
      "And then Clytemnestra had to speak up.",
      "\"Why the formal welcome?\" she asked, indicating the patrol and guards.",
      "\"Are you at war?\"",
      "Timalcos smiled wryly, making him look even more like an old campaigner.",

      "They lodged with another farmer.",
      "His wife gave them dinner from her hastily expanded pot and word that Theseus and Helen had passed through last market-day, heading north.",

      "\"You're looking for a bride?\" Menelaus asked, then took a step back, hands up, when Agamemnon and Clytemnestra turned on him.",
      "Agamemnon sighed, then told him, \"Not yet, but I will be soon.",
      "That or our father will.\"",
      "\"Oh.\"",
      "\"Indeed,\" Clytemnestra muttered.",
      "But her anger had passed.",
      "She hadn't thought he...?",
      "\"Why are we stopping here?\" Critylla asked.",
      "Agamemnon pointed at Menelaus, who immediately replied, \"Scouting is easier on foot.\"",
      "And when Agamemnon held up two fingers, \"And -- gossip from the stable?\" \"Right.\"",
      "Menelaus had shown him the value of that.",
      "Clytemnestra let out a slow breath through close lips, then nodded.",
      "From the stable-hands they learned that, yes, Aethra lived just up the way.",
      "Theseus weren't here, though, only those new guards he left behind -- the ones to stay clear of when they came down into town to drink of a night off.",
      "None of them had seen the young bride, but they'd talked with thems who had -- everyone agreed she was a beauty.",
      "The details were vague, but Agamemnon guessed there were at least a double-handful of soldiers.",
      "On a hunch, he asked about the shrine on the hill above them, and learned that yes, there was one up there, to the club-foot god some called Hermes.",
      "Better yet, a path up was just behind the inn.",
      "For luck like that, it was worth actually visiting the shrine to make an offering to Hermes, lame or not.",
      "Silently, Agamemnon vowed to give the god his best dagger if he survived the day.",
      "All five took their weapons, spear-blades wrapped to hide their glint.",
      "They climbed the slope silently.",
      "Partway up, a house clearly larger than the others came into view -- the old man was right, they couldn't have missed it.",
      "As for guards, Agamemnon saw three, all facing the lane.",
      "\"Are the rest around the other side, or just off duty?\" Critylla murmured.",
      "\"Let's get a little higher, then circle round,\" he murmured back.",
      "A goat-track leading behind an outcrop brought them to a couple furlongs of the house -- compound, really.",
      "As he crouched behind the rock, Agamemnon felt sweat clinging to his tunic, and didn't know if it was from the noon sun or nerves.",
      "\"I don't see anyone,\" Clytemnestra said.",
      "Agamemnon shook his head.",
      "Either the guards were well hidden on this side, or...",
      "At a building's corner, movement -- Critylla had her bow drawn and aimed before he knew it.",
      "An old man came into view, holding the halter lead for a pony.",
      "A matronly woman walked beside it, talking with the riding girl.",
      "All were unarmed.",
      "Just as there was no mistaking the house, there was no mistaking Helen of Sparta.",
      "Agamemnon clapped his hand on Clytemnestra's shoulder to keep her from standing.",
      "\"Wait for it.\"",
      "\"So close,\" she whispered, but settled back.",
      "He sympathized -- he was also trained for action, not sitting.",
      "Helen and attendants and her placid pony -- shouldn't a girl her age be on something with more spirit?",
      "-- headed out on a path up the hill, to the right of their outcrop.",
      "No guards followed, or even seemed to be watching.",
      "Surely it wasn't this easy?",
      "After a few dozen heartbeats, Mica tapped Clytemnestra's shoulder, and pointed at the goat-track, as it crossed hillside and Helen's path.",
      "Clytemnestra nodded, and Agamemnon let her stand.",
      "They followed her in a line, women before, men guarding their rear.",
      "Agamemnon kept more of an eye on the house than his footing, but still it was Menelaus who stumbled.",
      "They were closer than a small child's spear throw when Helen's party saw them and stopped.",
      "Clytemnestra called out, \"Helen!\"",
      "\"Clytie!\"",
      "Helen hopped off the pony and ran toward her sister.",
      "The next several moments were filled with hugs and squeals and overlapping conversation -- half of it \"missed you\" and \"so worried\" and the other half \"Uncle Theseus\" this and \"Uncle Theseus\" that.",
      "While that went on, the attendants led the pony up.",
      "Agamemnon addressed the older woman.",
      "\"The gods be with you -- Aethra?\"",
      "A guess, but she nodded graciously.",
      "\"And with you -- Clytemnestra, daughter of Tyndareus, and...?\" \"Agamemnon, son of Atreus -- my brother, Menelaus.\"",
      "Who was, he realized, standing rooted like a willow, staring at Helen like a moon-eyed calf.",
      "Oh gods, not now -- not him.",
      "Not that Helen wasn't the beauty everyone said: dark eyes, lustrous hair, clear brow, and a voice like a sparkling stream.",
      "Which was now protesting: \"No!",
      "If I leave now, then I won't get the very special gift Uncle Theseus is bringing me.\"",
      "\"Is that where he is now?\"",
      "Agamemnon asked her.",
      "\"Yes, and it's been days already!\"",
      "\"But Helen,\" Clytemnestra said, \"Father is -- \" \"And it was so far, the trip from Sparta.",
      "My feet are still blistered.\"",
      "\"Now, Helen, they are almost healed,\" Aethra said.",
      "Why had he thought this was going to be easy?",
      "It was going to be an even longer trip back to Sparta, with a spoiled princess like this.",
      "Agamemnon cleared his throat, and -- was that?",
      "Yes -- from in front of the house, the clear ring of sword on sword, and again.",
      "Aethra looked sharply at him.",
      "\"Nay, not ours,\" told her.",
      "\"You'd all best come with us.\"",
      "Another clang, followed by a shout.",
      "Aethra nodded, reluctantly -- only half-believing him.",
      "\"There's a hidden cave -- with supplies,\" and indicated the hill above the outcrop.",
      "Agamemnon took her arm and pulled her forward.",
      "\"Lead on,\" he told her, giving her a push.",
      "\"And quickly.\"",
      "Helen protested, but Clytemnestra cut her off with a sharp, \"Helen -- drill!\"",
      "And wonder of wonders, with a worried look behind her, the girl shut up.",
      "And even hurried, despite her blistered heel.",
      "Critylla sent the old man and the pony, with a slap on its haunch, around the hill as a blind.",
      "Agamemnon first heard the hoof-beats behind them soon after they ducked under the thin pine trees.",
      "In a clearing, he and Mica turned and unwrapped their spears -- just as the horses caught up.",
      "Riden by Castor and Polydeuces.",
      "Agamemnon held steady against the storm of their arrival -- but not steady enough to get in the first thrust as he should have with a long weapon.",
      "He fended off Castor's sword thrust and countered with the spear butt against the horse's flank.",
      "It was the last blow Agamemnon got in, as further horsemen thundered up.",
      "In another moment, he was disarmed, and some unknown soldier's sword was at his throat.",
      "Dammit.",
      "# Helen's brothers took charge of her, of course -- along with credit for rescuing her.",
      "It had taken them a couple days to reduce the citadel of Athens, and only then had learned that Theseus wasn't there.",
      "And now they were here, and the quarry theirs, for all Agamemnon and Clytemnestra had caught it first.",
      "The real blow came from Castor, however.",
      "\"Go home,\" he said, returning Agamemnon's spear with a toss.",
      "Agamemnon caught it, single-handed, frowning at the man.",
      "Why had he gloated as he said that?",
      "Polydeuces tossed Menelaus his spear in turn, then paused.",
      "\"Oh, that's right -- you don't have a home.\"",
      "\"What?\" Menelaus said.",
      "The brothers looked at each other, then at the twins.",
      "Polydeuces smiled like a hornet.",
      "\"While you were gone, Thyestes deposed his brother Atreus -- your uncle holds the scepter of Mycenae now.",
      "He's even named his bastard son Aegisthus heir.\"",
      "\"No home, no future,\" Castor agreed.",
      "Agamemnon could say nothing, feel nothing.",
      "\"He's dead?\" Menelaus said, as if the words meant something.",
      "Polydeuces only smirked.",
      "\"You bastards!\"",
      "Menelaus said.",
      "The two only laughed as they went back to taking charge of everything.",
      "\"Dammit!\"",
      "Menelaus shouted.",
      "Agamemnon couldn't agree more, though his anger wasn't at the twins, not any more.",
      "\"It's the same thing,\" he said slowly.",
      "\"What?\" Menelaus said.",
      "\"It's the same damn family story,\" Agamemnon said, more firmly.",
      "\"It just keeps happening.\"",
      "Which sobered Menelaus.",
      "He knew their sordid family history as well as anyone, what Atreus and Thyestes had survived.",
      "Agamemnon whirled and clasped his brother's forearm.",
      "\"But it stops with us.\"",
      "\"Agamemnon?\" Menelaus looked into his brother's eyes, his own dark eyes confused.",
      "\"Let us swear, the two of us -- we'll never be like them.",
      "The curse of Tantalus's line dies with our father.",
      "No more fighting, not between us.\"",
      "Menelaus swallowed, then nodded.",
      "\"I swear, on Zeus the Father.\"",
      "\"On Zeus the Father,\" Agamemnon agreed.",
      "Later, they would solemnize it over a sacrifice on the god's altar, but the true oath started here.",
      "They had each other's backs.",
      "Like brothers should -- like blood brothers.",
      "The brothers embraced, and Menelaus started crying.",
      "Agamemnon wanted to cry himself, but now he was too numb.",
      "Later.",
      "Later he would mourn his father, even the hard man that he was, and later still he would somehow avenge him.",
      "But for now, he held his younger brother and comforted him.",
      "He had nothing else, now.",
      "# Back at Aethra's house, the looting was complete and the Spartans were preparing to leave.",
      "Even Aethra was to be carried off as a slave.",
      "Castor ranted over how no one knew where Theseus was, but no matter how much he howled, the trail was cold -- as if the man had slipped under the earth.",
      "There was nothing else for them but to head back to Sparta with their sisters.",
      "The twins really were almost like a divine wind, a tempest that blew through everything they touched, with no one to hinder them.",
      "Even the pouting Helen didn't talk back to her brothers.",
      "In the midst of the packing, Clytemnestra came up to Agamemnon and Menelaus.",
      "\"Since my brothers won't have thanked you, I supposed it's up to me.",
      "The house of Tyndareus is in your debt.\"",
      "Agamemnon bowed slightly, as did Menelaus.",
      "\"You are welcome, daughter of Tyndareus.\"",
      "After a moment, Menelaus added, \"At least you have Helen back unharmed.\"",
      "\"And untouched,\" Clytemnestra agreed.",
      "\"That,\" Agamemnon said, because it was expected of him, \"is good.\"",
      "It was something.",
      "Another pause.",
      "Clytemnestra coughed, then said, \"You know, those two are almost never home.\"",
      "Meaning her brothers.",
      "\"Ah.",
      "That must make things more comfortable.\"",
      "She made an impatient sound.",
      "\"What I'm trying to say is, there are worse places to spend your exile than in my father's court.\"",
      "Oh.",
      "Agamemnon hadn't even gotten as far thinking where they would go now.",
      "To Aegialeus maybe, though Argos was too close to Mycenae for safety.",
      "\"With you,\" Menelaus said, \"and H-Helen?\" Clytemnestra rolled her eyes, but agreed.",
      "\"Agamemnon, can we?\" he asked eagerly.",
      "Wearily, Agamemnon nodded.",
      "Then to Clytemnestra, \"We thank you for your offer.\"",
      "\"It is the least my father can do, for what you've done.\"",
      "Agamemnon watched as his brother hurried off to tell Mica and Critylla -- he doubted the boy could say two words to Helen herself.",
      "Softly, to Clytemnestra, he said, \"You know, I haven't got the heart to tell him it's hopeless, with her.\"",
      "She nodded sadly, then said, \"Well, stranger things have happened.\"",
      "Indeed, though he could think of precious few just then.",
      "Then his brain caught up with what she wasn't saying.",
      "He cleared his throat.",
      "\"Is this your way of asking that question from last night?\"",
      "She turned to look at him with her bright blue eyes.",
      "\"Why, yes -- yes it is.\"",
      "\"Then you already know the answer,\" he said, gesturing towards Menelaus, still excited at the prospect of spending exile in Sparta.",
      "An excitement that Agamemnon didn't share -- though he felt a stirring of hope.",
      "With the backing of a father-in-law like Tyndareus, he'd have a chance of retaking Mycenae.",
      "If he could win Clytemnestra's hand, that is.",
      "With a small smile and an even smaller bow, Clytemnestra left him."

    "text": "He woke in the night and rose from his bed. His robe lay nearby and he wrapped it around himself, ignoring the soft sounds of protest from the bed. A soft hand reached for him and he brushed it away; she was pregnant, her belly swelling ever so slightly, and it upset her when he left. That, at least, had come as a surprise to both of them. She had been brought to his bed as a spoil of war and though he took pleasure in her beauty, he had not expected to feel anything for her. There was a fondness there now, born of close contact and, perhaps, the child that she carried inside her. Fondness, however, was not love, and he could not stay. He made his way down the hall, bare feet slapping softly against the floor. He didn't take a light with him. He didn't need one. The way to Helenus's room was well known to him, and the door was never locked. He tugged it open, slipped inside. The room was dark. From the bed came the sound of slow, deep breathing. He leaned back against the door and just listened, soothed by that rhythmic susurration, until his feet began to ache from the cold. \"Old man,\" he said, voice harsh in the quiet of the room. There was a stirring from the bed and he clenched his hands into fists. \"Wake up.\" He listened to the rustle of blankets, the soft sigh as Helenus dragged himself upright. There was a flare of light as Helenus lit the candle beside his bed and stared with weary eyes across the room. \"Neoptolemus,\" he murmured. It was invective and invitation. Neoptolemus accepted both and made his way across the room, dropping his robe on the floor. He knelt by the side of the bed, closing his eyes and sighing softly as Helenus cupped his face with a big hand. It was shameful, going to his knees before a man he named slave, but that was why he did it. To be the son of a hero, to be a hero himself, was a heavy burden. Nothing could lessen that heaviness, but Helenus helped. Rough fingers combed through his hair, gently separating out the knots, smoothing stray strands. He closed his eyes, shivering as Helenus's hands moved from hair to skin, tracing the graceful line of his neck, brushing down his shoulders. His touch smoothed away tension, drew out all of the cares of the day and cast them aside. It was why he came back time and time again to push against those hands, to lie beneath the man that he had claimed as his own once the killing had finished. \"Come into the bed, then, boy,\" Helenus sighed, cupping Neoptolemus's face and drawing him up. He laid indulgent kisses on the young man's face, following them with his fingertips to touch and retouch as he pressed his master onto his back. Neoptolemus went willingly, closing his eyes against the flickering of the candle and sending all of his focus into the tender fall of Helenus's hands along his naked body. Chest, belly, hips, thighs; Helenus caressed each in turn, bending until his forehead pressed against Neoptolemus's abdomen. His nostrils flared and a shiver ran up his spine as he scented the boy's skin, so fresh, so eager. His tongue flicked out, tasting, and a tremulous moan greeted this newest touch. \"Shh,\" he said, laughing against a tight belly. Neoptolemus shifted beneath his hands, the impatience of youth. He bit gently and the boy hissed. \"Don't tease me,\" he demanded. His leg rose, hooked across Helenus's hips. It was delightfully unsubtle, just one of the things that Helenus had grown to love about this strange, dark boy. He moved up, covering Neoptolemus with his own body, circling the boy's wrists with his hands. Neoptolemus was strong and fine, but he never fought to break Helenus's grip. His legs spread as easily as a well-practiced whore, and Helenus buried his face in the boy's neck as he rolled his hips down, relishing the lean body beneath him. There was oil on the table and Helenus used it, coating his fingers, pressing them roughly into Neoptolemus. He moaned, clawing at Helenus's arms, gasping at each thrust, each curve of the thick fingers inside him. They moved together, straining against each other, until Neoptolemus gripped the back of Helenus's neck and pulled him down. \"Please,\" he rasped. That was all it took. Helenus pushed in even as Neoptolemus pulled him in with his legs and the two came together with a simultaneous cry of pain and pleasure. It was a dance of mutual need and desire, give and take. Hands grasped, teeth clamped over tender flesh, leaving bruises that would linger for days. They both left their encounters the same way, marked inside and out, but in the heat of their passion, nothing mattered but the connection. They fed off of each other in this way, clinging and thrusting, whispering one another's names, breathing protestations of adoration that would go unsaid until they were together again like this, spoken only in their eyes, in the faint brush of a hand or a closeness when there were no others to see. It was a known fact that there was something between them, but none but the two of them knew how deep it went. Neoptolemus finished first, his cry muffled by Helenus's palm. He continued to thrust, shuddering as the boy's sweet body clenched around him, drawing him deeper, holding him tighter, until he, too, reached his climax and fell in a sweat-drenched heap on top of Neoptolemus. \"My boy,\" he murmured, stroking a shivering flank. \"Shh, it's all right.\" Gradually, Neoptolemus calmed, his breathing growing even, and Helenus shifted to the side, drawing him close and kissing his smooth forehead. \"Sweet boy,\" he sighed. \"You do tax me.\" Usually, this drew laughter, a gentle jeer, a sweetness. Tonight, Neoptolemus pressed tighter against his side and sighed softly. \"I feel strange lately,\" he said. \"As though there is something hanging over me. Tell me true, Helenus, do I worry over nothing?\" And Helenus, who had his sister's gift of prophecy and who had always been believed, knew to what Neoptolemus referred. Death, on black wings, coming for the shining boy at his side. Too soon. Far, far too soon. To deny his gift, to lie when asked a question, went against all he believed. He should tell Neoptolemus, prepare the boy to meet his end. It was the right thing to do. But right did not always mean good and, knowing how little time they had left, he smoothed Neoptolemus's hair and pitched his voice low and lied. \"Yes, my love. You worry over nothing.\"",

    "text": "She has long since ceased to mark the passage of the years, but she does not need to see time being partitioned into its manifold boxes--minutes, and hours, and days--to know that it has been a long, long time since she has last seen her sister. She cannot blame her. Even for Euryale, the halls still echo with the memory of Medusa's laughter, and Stheno, well, Stheno is different now. She talks too quickly, like a mortal, and her eyes are brittle and over-bright. Even when she is home, she no longer bothers to change out of the clothing she has acquired among the humans--legs sheathed in denim, tight-fitting shirts that chatter with images and words--and she paces constantly, nervously before she finally catches herself, lighting a cigarette with a short, self-deprecating laugh. Sorry, she always says, it's just so different there, you know? The way time moves in the mortal realms, rushing forward, always forward, like a river that sweeps everything before it and it just feels so stifling, so suffocating sometimes, this place where the hours do nothing but sleep and collect into pools. I know, says Euryale. And she does know. She knows how heavy eternity can feel if you don't allow yourself to open your mouth and drown. * * * * We were goddesses once. The Hellenes would have liked to forget it, perhaps, but they were young gods then. They were still insecure, bloodthirsty, and querulous, eager to eradicate the vestiges of Stories to which they did not belong. I think that they must have feared what we represented, resented the reminder that they too might one day be forgotten, their temples abandoned, derelict and old. How could they have helped it? It is the nature of the divine, after all, to yearn for the infinite, to expand itself from one eternity to the next. How can a god help but be tormented by the memory of its own genesis? What can it do to protect itself from the impulse to erase its own beginnings, to forget that it had been the worship of mortals that had drawn it from the darkness, given it a name and face and a place to drink? So when we first knelt in supplication to Olympus, begging for the scraps of belief we needed to survive, they gave us place in the stone halls of the utter west but they also made us monsters. I still remember how my sister wept when the birds she had once loved plummeted from the sky, their feathers a perfect study in marble as they shattered mercilessly upon the earth. She who had once been Medusa the Beloved, beautiful Meduse, Hope in War and Laughter in Battle, would never have anyone gaze upon her again, already disfigured by the fear of the men who were spreading her new stories. We held her for long nights in the darkness, Stheno and I, as she screamed and beat her wings and scored the stone with her talons of brass. We wondered then if it was really worth it, this existence living on crumbs of worship from other gods. But we had been goddesses of justice and war--proud, existing to die in battle-- and we were not strong enough to endure the craven deaths of the truly forgotten. (Thin and starving in the darkness, pared down to a rumor.) The fear of men is bitter and tastes of ash. It has nothing of the savor of devotion. But it suffices. * * * * Sthenno wears boots and tight denim, her angular face dwarfed by a pair of tinted glasses. Her bandana lies discarded in her lap. The serpents hiss and nip sleepily at her fingers as she gently strokes their heads, watching her sister pensively through a sheet of amber glass. She feels awkward, vaguely guilty. She is aware that she should have visited, oh, thirty, forty years ago and that it is only her cowardice that has kept her away, but she doesn't really know how to apologize and Euryale wouldn't have wanted to hear it anyhow. It was just that....nothing ever changed here. The stone halls of the utter west continued to echo with the sounds of water, and the corridors that lead to Dis (cold, echoing with ghostly voices) smelled perpetually of incese and ash, scarred by the sacrifices that Euryale still burned in memory of the people for which they had once been gods. Every year, there were new gouges in the walls on the anniversary of their sister's death, evidence of Euryale's seven nights of ritual grief. Euryale hadn't even altered her appearance in ages--scaled and serpentine, draped in white linen, stubbornly maintaining the aura of horror that suited a monster of old. Even Sthenno still had a hard time looking her directly in the face, turned aside by the sight of naked truths too terrible to bear. For her part, Sthenno had figured out long ago how it would be with these new generations of mortals-- these men who crawled, dreaming, into their machines and let the humming soothe away the old thirst for horror and salvation. The influence of the Hellenes had endured far longer then they would have expected, but the old myths had lost their ability to awe and terrify. They could survive still on the pale residue of belief that remained, and though they could not change their essential natures, they could put on new forms and faces. They could leave. But Euryale would never leave. Her second sister would remain here forever--mourning their lost sibling, honoring a people for whom not even a memory remained--nothing but a shadow and a rumor that haunted the nightmares of men. Even now, her sister is whetting her blade of silver and stone, the corpse of some variety of seabird splayed on the table beside her. She will flay its body, lay out its innards in whorls and patterns like widow's lace, burn it upon a pyre of rosemary and young wood and murmur prayers in a language that is no longer even spoken in dreams. \"You don't have to do this,\" Sthenno blurts, suddenly, desperately. \"You can stop. You can leave.\" Euryale does not lift her eyes from the blade. \"No,\" she says in a quiet voice, \"I can't.\" * * * * It happens like this: They are the three sisters of violence, and their dominion is war. They subjugate the gods of the lands around them, and eat the flesh of those that remain. Their monuments rise implacably above the fertile deltas of the southern oceans, and they stand--proud and terrible--back to back in their temples, faces carved into dread aspects of stone and ivory and jade. Sthenno rides before their armies, and Medusa rides behind. Medusa sings to their soldiers of triumph and reminds them sweetly of their families, while Stheno, dread Stheno, is shrill and fierce as the wind, brandishing a scythe in each of her many arms. And above them, grim Euryale, passing judgment with rod and brazen wings, sternly admonishing men that there is virtue that the gods expect even in the heat of war. Perhaps they grow complacent, fat with plunder and slaves, or maybe it happens too gradually for them to notice--but the day comes when all of their sacrifices taste of blood and they realize, sick with horror, that the meat upon their altars has been carved from the flesh of their own children, when slaves begin to run scarce during war. 'Our noble people have become as demons,' Euryale cries unto sisters, 'And they make us into beasts, thinking of nothing but murder and intrigue and bottomless hunger.' (And it came to pass that fair Medu spilled out her immortal blood unto the keeper of the dismal gates, and was granted passage unto the bowels of the earth. In the darkness, she thrust her spear into the flesh of the world-snake until the writhing of its agony had covered her once-beloved cities from before her face and buried them in the sea.) It is a lie of the Olympians that it could only have been the foul ugliness of the gorgon that made its gaze as fatal as stone--for even as monsters, they were beautiful. No, beloved, it was the unendurable grief in their eyes, the intolerable despair. For what man can hope to behold the anguish of a goddess and flesh remain? * * * * \"Do you know?\" Stheno says, unexpectedly, her voice cold and curiously detached. \"I never told you. Athene let me see her once. They had affixed her head to some sort of damned shield, but I placed a few drops of my blood on her tongue and woke her. Old magic. But perrhaps I shouldn't have. Maybe it hurt her. I don't even know what I hoped to do.\" \"Stheno.\" The way Euryale says her name, Stheno knows she wants her to stop, but she can't now, she can't, ever again. \"I talked to her for a while,\" she continued, helplessly. \"I asked her where she was now, what there was after this. I was scared. Had she gone back to the primordial darkness? To Dis? To the shadow valleys of our brother-gods, perhaps? Maybe even after our divinity had died, our hell would still remain.\" \"Stop it, Stheno! Stop it.\" Covering her ears and cringing like a frightened child, Euryale, grim Euryale, who always, always did what she was supposed to do long after it had ceased to matter. \"She said there was no place for gods,\" Stheno whispers, \"She said that it was cold.\" * * * * There's a woman sitting on the end stool when you turn around, though you hadn't heard anyone come in, and you bring her a menu and a complimentary bowl of peanuts and ask her if there was anything she would like to start her off. She asks for a dark lager, please, and a napkin. Her voice is polite but she doesn't seem particularly willing to chat, which is a shame but you know how it is. You can respect that. She sits there through the black hours, drinking steadily, her hat pulled down over her eyes. There's an aura of inscrutable mystery about her, somehow, and you find yourself setting down glasses with care, afraid to to disturb the air of stillness and solemn gravitas. She's a strange duck, but you keep them coming with quiet efficiency and ten minutes before closing, she carefully counts out the bills and precise number of coins, thanks you, and leaves. There's an unusual coin among the change when you finally get around to picking it up--a small, crude disc, probably copper. You can't really make out the details, but it seems to be embossed with the face of a woman, hair twining wildly around the sallow cheeks like ivy, like snakes. She'd probably mistaken it for a dime or a penny, but it's that's not much. You won't sweat it. You take a fancy to it, slip it into your pocket or purse. Joke to yourself that it can be your good luck charm. Nothing much really happened, now that you think about it, but sometimes you still find yourself thinking about her. During in-between moments, maybe, or just as you're falling asleep. You wonder where she came from. You wonder what she knows. -End-",

    "text": "She wakes alone in a large bed and lies still while memory floods back. Gathering narcissus flowers in a meadow on the slopes of Olympus, great black horses rising from the earth, a hand stifling her screams... and then unconsciousness. She is still wearing her own tunic; the bedclothes are drawn up neatly around her and undisturbed. She has not been violated yet. She draws in a few deep breaths. This is a small space to compose herself for what is to come. She girds courage around herself and prepares to face her captor. Whatever comes next, she will be prepared to fight. **** Erinyes, goddesses of vengeance, lead her to a golden hall. Couches surround a table laden with the choicest food; apples and grapes, fresh bread and sweetmeats. The Lord of this place comes forward to meet her. She has the impression of overwhelming power and strength, dark intense eyes under aquiline brows, the power to make and unmake creation confined in the flesh of a god. It is Hades, brother of Zeus, King of the Dead, who with his brothers overthrew the Titans and who now holds her entirely in his power. \"Lady,\" he says ironically, \"welcome to my domain. Do let me offer you refreshments.\" He waves her to a seat and takes the couch opposite. She sits carefully, warily, but rape does not yet seem to be on the agenda for the evening. \"Quite a welcome,\" she says. \"I am more used to hospitality that doesn't begin with violent kidnap.\" \"In Olympus?\" he asks. \"I'm surprised you rule out any approach at all.\" If she acknowledges this is true, she does not say so to the all-powerful deity who holds her prisoner. \"Do eat and drink,\" he says again. \"I thank you, but no,\" she replies. \"As you will,\" he says, and he begins to discourse on the beauties of the Peloponnese, effortlessly holding down two sides of the conversation while she listens in growing confusion. This kidnapping is not what she had expected. \"Your bedchamber is yours,\" he says at the end of the evening. \"None of my creatures will disturb you there.\" Then he leaves her and she returns to her room. *** The Erinyes bring her to Hades' Hall again the next night and again the night after. She is left to her own devices during the day, and each evening she sits at an abundantly laden table, while the ruler of the underworld talks to her as if she were an honoured guest. And each night she retires to her room to sleep alone. *** \"Welcome, my lady.\" \"Lord Hades.\" \"I have had gastronomical delights prepared just for you. Quail eggs and tartlets made from the apples of the Hesperides. Can I not tempt you to eat?\" \"Not tonight, I thank you. I find delicacies lose their flavour when given from the hand of a kidnapper.\" \"Another time then. Can I interest you instead in the latest work of a mortal poet...\" *** As the days pass, she begins to breathe a little easier. She doesn't let down her guard, never that; she still doesn't know why Hades brought her here. In all her experience, a god capturing a nymph can have only one outcome and it never ends well for the nymph. It would be the height of folly to trust her kidnapper. Yet she cannot live indefinitely in a state of terror and though she stays alert she also begins to relax. During her days she starts to explore Hades' palace and when no one stops her, she ventures further afield. She walks through a great pomegranate orchard and sits among flowers in the Elysian Fields. These trees and flowers of the underworld are strange to a nymph of sunlit harvests, but strangely familiar too, and as she inhales the scent of narcissus or rests a hand against the bark of a pomegranate tree she finds comfort. She sometimes comes to Hades' great golden hall as he sits in judgement, the three judges of the Underworld beside him and the Erinyes poised to do his bidding, but she prefers to be outside and, as promised, she remains unmolested by any of the god's creatures. But she still takes care that no food or drink should pass her lips here in the Underworld, and each night, when Hades sets a feast before her, she smiles but does not eat. *** They talk of drama and poetry, of mortal creativity and grace. But they have never talked of her life before he kidnapped her. \"Do you miss your mother?\" he asks abruptly. \"She must miss you.\" She stills. How to answer? How much to give away? She settles on: \"My mother will no doubt miss a useful pawn in her games of petteia with Hera and Zeus.\" He raises an eyebrow but does not pursue it. *** The next night there is a petteia board set out on one side of the hall: a genuine board with tiny gemstones for playing pieces, not the parody the Olympians play out with human lives in their never-ending power struggles. \"I thought you might play,\" he says. She smiles and takes a seat. ** \"I had not marked you down as a great player of games,\" she says, moving one of her pieces. \"Oh no?\" he asks \"You were furious when you left Zeus on Olympus,\" she says. \"You called down curses and you shook the earth in your fury. It was a scene of great passion. It did not make me think of well-planned strategy and revenge delayed.\" \"You were there?\" \"I was there. You wouldn't have seen me. When the gods gather in assembly, nymphs are only part of the background decor. It was the day before...\" she trails off. \"It was the day before I swooped in to steal the latest nymph to attract Zeus's adoration,\" he finishes for her. He places a piece on the board. \"Your move.\" *** For six nights they move game pieces on the board. For six nights the patterns become more complex. On the seventh, Persephone makes her final move. Hades is boxed in, with nowhere else to go. \"I win,\" she says. He surveys the board calmly. \"And you are a worthy opponent, my lady,\" he says. He gestures towards the table laden with its usual feast, but she takes no food or drink in her victory. Instead, she looks back at the game board and challenges him to a rematch. *** Tonight's mortal poetry is a tale of the conquests of Zeus, of half-human children fathered on mortal princesses. Persephone shivers and pulls her expression back into its old, impassive mask. Hades still notices of course. \"The poetry does not please you? It does not make you feel wistful for your Olympian home?\" \"It hits a little close for comfort,\" she admits. He waits in silence for her to continue. \"You said yourself that I had drawn Zeus's attention,\" she says carefully. \"A nymph in Olympus has very few options. She can be seduced willingly or chased and caught against her will; either way her role is that of a conquest. If it's not Zeus, it will be Apollo or Ares. There is little choice and no lasting way to say no.\" For once, his face is not impassive. He looks genuinely shocked. \"But your mother?\" he asks. \"You're a daughter of Demeter; surely you're not without protection!\" \"I was not without protection,\" she concedes, \"while my mother had use for me in her schemes. But the value of a virgin daughter was fast giving way to the usefulness of a distraction for Zeus. I became adept at running and adept at hiding during my last months in Olympus.\" \"My brother's advances were not welcome, then?\" he asks. \"Not welcome, no,\" she says quietly, then shakes herself. \"But you should not suppose that made him want me less. I can assure you that my unwillingness will only have made him more furious to see me snatched from under his nose. Your kidnap is as effective as you ever thought it was.\" *** \"Do you believe I would not hurt you?\" he asks abruptly a month later. \"You will only kidnap me and hold me prisoner?\" She is sure that the lift of her eyebrow is every bit as sardonic as his. \"No, I mean... I can't even apologise for the kidnap.\" As if a god ever owed an apology to a nymph. \"But I wouldn't force myself on you.\" \"I am entirely in your power,\" she points out. \"That's not.... I wouldn't... being stronger than you shouldn't mean I can do anything I like.\" \"So you won't be a rapist,\" she concedes. \"How kind! Don't you think it's sad if that's the greatest tribute that can be paid to you? It's a great testimony to your character: he may be a kidnapper, but at least he's not a rapist.\" \"Don't. I know how petty it is. You are caught up entirely in my battle with my brother and I won't let you go. But I wouldn't rape you.\" \"No,\" she admits. \"I believe you would not.\" And it's true. Even in her gilded cage, she feels safer now than she did on Olympus. \"You have been used in too many people's power struggles even before I kidnapped you. But you were a suitable means to an end and I would do it all again. For that I am sorry.\" \"I can only hope it has had the desired effect,\" she says. \"Oh yes,\" he says. \"By all reports, my brother is most satisfactorily enraged.\" \"And that, at least, is something.\" She thinks of being pursued, of the terror of knowing that there is nowhere to run, and she is vindictively glad about every least inconvenience to Zeus. But she still doesn't eat from Hades' feast. *** Zeus sends Hermes to Hades to protest against her imprisonment. He claims to speak on behalf of her mother; that might even be true. The story of maternal grief she is sure is false. She is present when Hades receives him, but stands pale and silent, tries to fade back into the walls, a perfectly decorative nymph. It is only then that she realises how much she has relaxed in this palace of the Underworld, how much she trusts that, even in judgement, Hades will act justly and without caprice. The great dog Cerberus pads over to sit at her feet, putting himself between her and Hermes. She twists her fingers in his fur and finds his presence comforting. Hades appears different in his majesty and state. He is forbidding and aloof and she remembers again how much power he wields with a single finger. She knows his anger still burns strong against his brother, but Zeus is, after all, his liege lord no matter their temporary enmity. She surprises herself with how relieved she is when Hades sends Hermes away without her. *** \"You are not at all what I expected,\" says Hades over their customary game of petteia. \"In what way?\" \"Oh, I admit I had not given you a great deal of thought, beyond how I could use you against Zeus. That was my failing, of course. I may have bought into your mother's propaganda. I suppose I expected a perfectly demure nymph. Beautiful, perhaps a little silly, adoring any god that came her way.\" Once again she is reminded of the difference in their experience, of the power and privilege he takes for granted. She draws in a breath and wonders how to explain. \"Few nymphs are like that really,\" she says. \"But consider your power: you could do anything you chose to me and I have no way of stopping you. I may know you wouldn't, but you could. Before you abducted me, I had bent every thought for months towards how to escape your brother's attentions. I planned every move so as not to be alone with him; I memorised each rock and stream of Olympus for hiding places and so I never had to go anywhere without an escape route where I could run away. And even so I could not have kept him away as long as I did if he had not enjoyed my fear, the thrill of the chase.\" He is silent, his eyes troubled.\"You are saying that nymphs adopt a kind of protective camouflage around the gods?\" he asks. \"Of sorts,\" she agrees. \"Our thoughts can be our own, even when our bodies cannot. And if we are seen as living accessories in the palace of the gods, there's a kind of safety in that.\" \"I thank you for the compliment,\" he says at last. For a moment she wonders what he means; then she realises that it's been a long time since she has truly guarded her words in his presence. **** He obviously thinks about her words some more, and after he wins their next petteia match (eighteen games to her, twenty-three to him, seven draws) he asks whether she has friends she misses. \"Oh, yes,\" she says. Then her eyes widen in sudden horror. \"But you are not to kidnap any more nymphs to keep me company. The Erinyes and I get on just fine.\" It is even true; between Hades' attendants and the freedom to roam his domain, she is building a second home here, even aside from their comfortable evenings together. \"I wouldn't dream of it,\" he assures her seriously. \"Anyway, my closest friend was Aetna and she moved away from Olympus years ago. Don't get me wrong, I'm glad she got out, but it's been some time since we could exchange girlish confidences.\" \"Aetna?\" he asks. \"Oh! She married...\" \"She married Hephaestus,\" Persephone agrees. \"Just months after he failed to marry me.\" She realises that Hades must have heard the story; no doubt that also fed his belief that she would be spoiled and silly. She flushes. \"Whatever you might have heard,\" she says, \"it's unlikely to be true. I would have taken him no matter his scars. I didn't know him, nor he me, and it might have been a disaster, but he wanted a wife and he didn't want to stay on Olympus; that was enough to count in his favour. I wouldn't have judged him by his physical appearance.\" It is suddenly very important to her that he believe she is not that shallow. Zeus's golden good looks swim before her eyes, fatally marred by his arrogance and selfishness; she compares them to Hades' aquiline nose and powerful, overcast brows and stops that train of thought abruptly. \"But that's not how it worked out,\" he prompts gently. \"No,\" she agrees. \"My mother refused him before he ever spoke to me in person. And she did pass comments on his deformities. She was neither kind nor discreet and her remarks were repeated all over Olympus. It did not make him think well of me.\" She shakes herself. \"Well, that's all old history now. He married Aetna and took her to Sicily and I believe they are happy together. But it did make continuing our friendship awkward, even before I was abducted by the King of the Underworld.\" She smiles at him. \"Amazingly enough, not everything in my life is your responsibility.\" \"If you say so.\" \"Aetna was my last resort,\" she says abruptly. \"If Olympus became unbearable, I thought I might go to them. But I couldn't expect Hephaestus to welcome me and even if he had he couldn't have protected me against Zeus. I did think that in the worst-case scenario I might escape to them to raise the inevitable child of my rape.\" He has no words to say to that, but he squeezes her hand comfortingly as they part for the night and does not even make his customary offer of fruit from his feast. **** She places her petteia piece carefully on the board, leaving him nowhere to move and bringing their score level at twenty-six games each. He concedes with a graceful wave of his hand. \"I have been thinking,\" he says as they adjourn to the couches. \"You were present for my last argument with my brother. You knew I was furious. You have survived all your life in the cesspit that is Olympus.\" \"Your point?\" she asks carefully. \"You knew these things,\" he says, \"and yet the very next morning there you were, gathering narcissus flowers in a meadow shaded by weeping cypress and white poplar trees. One might almost think you were trying to attract the attention of the Lord of the Dead.\" Truth be told, she had expected him to realise this sooner. \"And I was desperate...\" she admits. \"Desperate to escape my brother's attentions,\" he finishes for her. \"But to deliberately stage-manage your own abduction! It was a terrible risk. You had no idea what I might do to you.\" \"No, I did not. And I was genuinely terrified. But I had nowhere else to go. I suppose I had come to a point where I feared staying in Olympus more than I feared the unknown.\" She smirks a little. \"I did not think you could be worse than your brother and even if you were as bad I would still have had the satisfaction of knowing I had frustrated him.\" \"My lady, I continue to be surprised by your unexpected depths. I salute you. I would have welcomed you to my realm more lavishly had I known you chose to be here.\" He leans across the table, his smile warm and inviting as he offers her half of a perfectly ripe pomegranate. \"Now can I persuade you to eat the fruits of my orchard?\" She can't help smiling back at him, sharing his warmth, but she shakes her head. \"Why, sir,\" she says, \"a forced choice is not a free choice and I will not share your feast.\" *** Demeter is still furious at the loss of her daughter - and more furious still, Persephone deduces, at the loss of her influence over Zeus. She is trying to force him to assert his authority over Hades - no matter that that might bring on war between all the Olympians. The news is brought to the Underworld by the Erinyes, returning from their missions of vengeance; crops are failing and mortals curse the gods. Persephone shudders at the chaos and suffering and shrinks further from the thought of war. If Zeus's anger with Hades turns to all-out war the whole earth will suffer for it. Yet she does not plead to be released. She is uncomfortably aware that to reward her mother's tactics would simply encourage more of the same. No god or goddess can be permitted to hold the Earth itself hostage; no one would ever be safe again if its bounty is destroyed at Demeter's whim. Still, the peace Persephone has found here starts to feel fragile and she fears that Zeus and her mother may be able to force her from the underworld. Hades does not offer to let her go, though he looks more sombre as more newly dead enter his realm with tales of blight and starvation. She spends more time wandering the Asphodel fields, murmuring nonsense to Hades' strong black cattle and running with Cerberus through the strange half-light. But she also spends longer in Hades' great Hall when he sits in state to hand out good judgement and she treasures every moment of their evenings together. *** The inevitable happens at last. Zeus issues formal judgement in his role as King of the Gods; that judgement is in Demeter's favour. Persephone may spare a moment to think cynically that other factors than justice are involved; yet still the moment has come. Hermes arrives in the Underworld in pomp and he recites the divine decree. She freezes and she can see Hades tense. Will he concede defeat, or will he defy his brother? If he chooses defiance, she thinks it would be for her; perhaps she deludes herself and it would simply be a refusal to give up his revenge. Hermes trembles in Hades' presence. He doesn't belong here and he knows it, but he has the protection of the name of the King of the Gods and he does not back away from the gathering thunder in Hades' face. Persephone looks back at Hades. He has never said the words. Can she believe he loves her, or is she still just a valuable political pawn? Can she stake her future on having a place in his court? Put another way, can she risk losing the world to war if he does choose to fight for her? Hermes arrived at night. The ever-laden table is between them, overflowing with all the fruits of Hades. She stretches out her hand to take a single perfect pomegranate segment. Hades' eyes widen - almost imperceptibly, but she has learned to read that forbidding, beloved face. He knows what she's doing, even if he barely believes it and his eyes gleam with delight and triumph. Reassured, she bites into the fruit. Hermes leaps forward to stop her and there is a brief struggle; his strength is greater than hers, but Hades is there too. He catches her wrist and takes the pomegranate from her. Hermes is silent as Hades inspects the fruit. He raises his sceptre and it cleaves the Earth; his voice thunders from the underworld throughout the spheres and all the way to Olympus. \"Persephone has eaten seven, pomegranate seeds,\" he declares. \"For seven months she shall dwell in my halls as my wife; the remaining five she may return to her mother.\" This time he does not resist when Hermes moves to escort her back to Zeus; it is she who holds up a hand to wave the messenger back. She steps forward on tiptoe. \"Five months,\" she murmurs into Hades ear, \"then I will return to be your wife in more than name.\" She draws his lips into a deep passionate kiss, the first fruits of loving to come. His lips soften and part under hers and he lets out a faint gasp. She sweeps her tongue between his lips, over his teeth and deeply, briefly into his mouth, chasing his faint sounds of pleasure. When she steps back she turns to Hermes. \"Now,\" she says, \"I'm ready.\" *** Life on Olympus is radically different when you are the wife of Hades and Queen of the Underworld as opposed to an anonymous nymph. Even Zeus dares not touch her now, and she dissuades her mother's more importune demands with a raised eyebrow and a mask of gravitas. Bringing springtime abundance back from the Underworld also provides a wonderful excuse to escape from the heights of Olympus. Persephone walks through fields and valleys, skips lightly over mountaintops. Flowers bloom under her feet and fertility and abundance follow in her wake. If Demeter thought her control of the produce of the Earth was a sure new weapon, she has overreached herself. For five months of each year, Persephone will walk the earth and mortals will have full harvests, no matter what her mother's choices are. The whole world has become her domain, and though she misses Hades with a deep, sharp longing she cannot but be moved by the praise and gratitude of the humans who receive her plenty. And when her path takes her to Sicily, she is reconciled with Hephaestus and spends long golden afternoons talking with Aetna. But she is sure to return to Olympus when the end of her five-month exile approaches. Grand gestures, after all, mean more when seen by an appropriate audience. With a fine sense of drama, Hades' sceptre strikes through the mountain and a chasm opens to the Underworld, stonework breaking apart in the central hall of Olympus. Persephone registers Zeus's fury with smug pleasure. Erinyes flood from the ground, wings beating like thunder, forming an honour guard. She does not look back; with her head held high she steps into the Earth. *** Hades is waiting for her at the centre of his realm. Five months has been too long to live on the memory of one kiss and she hurries forward. He reaches for her hungrily, sinks his hand into her hair. \"My lady, my love,\" he murmurs as he kisses her. His lips move over her face, then back to her mouth. He bites gently at her lips and then kisses her deeply. Her hair falls from its pins into loose waves around them. She presses forward against him, returns to his kisses eagerly, passion consuming them. \"It's been too long,\" he murmurs as he trails his lips down the column of her throat. \"I'm here,\" she assures him. \"I'm yours if you are mine.\" With a wave of his hand the world shifts around them and they are in a stately room she has never seen before. A large bed is draped with luxurious hangings and he joyfully sweeps her towards it. Now he is kissing her neck, sucking gently at the column of her throat. Their hands pull ineffectually at each other's clothes, reluctant to move apart long enough to undress. She kisses him again and her hands trace the strong contours of his chest, delighting in the way he trembles at her touch. His own hands skim her nipples and she gasps in pleasure. They fall together onto what will now be their shared bed. FIN",

    "text": "entautha lektron iketeuomen phugasFugitive from his bed, I am supplicant here.Euripides' Helen, line 799translation my own You think you already know my story, but you do not. Men have been telling and retelling my story for ages. Women too, but mostly men. Men try to own my story the way they have always tried to own me. My father, my husband, my lover and now these story tellers. But stories slither like snakes in the hands of the Pythia. They change their shapes of their own accord, and not even she can control them. You don't know me. These men who approach the wall of thorns, certain it will be they who penetrate--they do not know me, nor do they care to. What do they know of the inner life of a woman? They see my face, the thousand ships it launched. They call me Beauty. They fight for my skin, not my soul. I never knew why Leda and Tyndareos were so eager to hide me from men's eyes. I couldn't leave the palace--no girl of royal blood could--but at least Klytemnestra could loiter in the hall when visitors came, men from other lands. She sneered at me as she left, proud of her access, her ambition showing even then. I cared not for status, though I was curious to see what they hid from me, what would happen if I were not hidden. In my young girlhood, Theseus stole me away thinking that I must truly be a worthy prize for Leda and Tyndareos to secure me away so tightly. Only the swift actions of my brothers Kastor and Polydeukes saved me from his plans. Their actions, and Theseus' distaste for unripe flesh. He had planted me with his mother, until I was ready. Why steal me at all, you may ask, if he did not want a 9-year-old child? So no one else could have me, of course. I was not a girl, I was time: booty, honor, prize. Precious object. Once I returned, the abduction just reinforced the story that Theseus began to tell when he stole me. So beautiful. The most beautiful. No one else more beautiful. It was a lie. I was no more beautiful than any other girl, but men want most what they cannot have, and so my parents ensured the fate they feared as completely as if they had intended it in the first place. Goddess, God-mother, Eris, Discord, Maleficent--call her what you will--she used me to tell her story of the bitter uninvited guest, just as thoroughly as Theseus used me to tell his manly honor in his old age. Tyndareos used me to gain his own prizes as well. All the Gods used me as a pawn in their games, a bit player in their stories. Goddesses are closer kin to Gods than they are to mortal women. They care only for their favorites, and to the dung heap with the rest. But it is not even entirely Eris' fault. She sows the discord, but we choose to let it ripen and reap it. We tell our own stories, too. Kalliste, the inscription on the apple will read. Kalliste, claim the suitors at the door. Odysseus, Diomedes, Antilokhos, Agamemnon, Menelaos, Philoktetes, Aias, Teukros. They all stand there, and more. This army of Akhaian men now, each claiming me as his prize--they frighten Tyndareos. He comes upon an agreement with Odysseus, always keen to find an angle. He wants Tynadareos' aid in his suit of my cousin Penelope. He was only at my door for show. My \"beauty\" compelled them all. I was always a prize more than I was a bride, neither lover nor beloved. I was an entangling alliance. In the end, it doesn't matter which one of them Tyndareos chooses for me. Menelaos gives him most gifts, buys me outright. The night he pierces me with his spindle, I fall asleep. The wall of thorns grows up again around me. I sleepwalk through this new life, through all the duties of a good Akhaian wife. I weave, I spin, I press the olives into oil, I submit to my husband, and I sleep through it all. The household around me may as well be frozen in time for all that I interact with it. Not even the birth of my daughter can wake me from this slumber. Hermione is frail, fuzzy-headed, mewling like a baby goat when I pass her to the wet nurse. She will be better loved by the serving-women of the house. My own heart is frozen. Try as I might, I cannot summon love for this girl, born to be yet another prize. I can only summon pity. Everything changes when Paris arrives. For the first time in my life, I do not fear a man. He is not warlike. He does not look upon me as an object to fear or to fuck. He looks at me. He looks in my eyes--and I feel my own heat. I wake up, flushed and furious. I find that I want to take control of my own story. This time, I am not abducted. I go willingly. I follow this man who cares more for eros than for time. The Akhaians say this makes me a whore, but the Akhaians are the ones who bought and sold me. What do I care for their judgment? The Trojans are welcoming, at first. Priam and Hekuba look on Paris with the same fear my parents looked at me: the fear of an awful fate foretold. We only have eyes for each other. We spend our days in bed, but not asleep. We do not interact with Ilium outside our bedroom walls, but Ilium is not frozen. Ilium is soaked in our heat. Agamemnon, eager to tell the story of his glory, calls on the alliance made on the altar of my virginity. The thousand ships are launched. When Hektor drives Paris out of my bed and spurs him onto the battlefield, at first I weep. Then I remember I have a story to tell, and I get out of bed to prepare for battle. Tyndareos may have been my mother's husband, but he was not my father. Now that I had something to live for, I would fight for it. I use my divine powers, my birthright, to aid the Trojans. I imitate the voices of the Akhaians' wives, and sent their hearts homeward. I use my knowledge of the men themselves, gained in their pursuit of me, against them. It is all for naught. Menelaos and Agamemnon will not allow their honor to be so thoroughly damaged by a mere woman. They are Zeus' playthings, but so am I, and he finally allows them to take the city, by way of his favorite daughter's favorite. When Menelaos comes upon me, clinging to the knees of the marble goddess, I can see murder in his eyes. To save my skin, I transfer my supplication to him. I tell him stories of unwilling abduction, of escape to Egypt. He considers my story, and of its potential for the restoration of his honor. If I never went to Paris' bed, he can bring me back to his. If I was asleep in Egypt this whole time, he could reclaim me with a kiss. All I want is to survive. Paris could not protect me, for all that he was able to waken me. I return with Menelaos. I try to become the dutiful wife again. When we hear of the fate of Agamemnon, I tremble thinking Menelaos might once again threaten to loose his murderous rage on me. He does not. He looks on me from time to time with fear, but he has no need. I long for my sister's strength, but I do not have it any longer. I yearn for the nerve to place a twin blade into a twin back, and send Menelaos to Hades with his brother. I have not the strength, alas. I am asleep once again. The wall of thorns has returned.",

    "text": "When they were children, Clytemnestra used to hate her sister Helen. Not because of her beauty, and not because of the sweetness of her personality, but because Helen stole their father's affection. Helen was Zeus' bastard, yet Tyndareus doted on her. A man should consider his sons above his daughters, for daughters were good only for marriage, but Tyndareus delighted in Helen. He brought gifts to her cradle: a mirror, so she could see how her beauty grew each day; a small wooden horse, symbol of wealth and nobility; a puff of raw cotton, soft and white like her skin. Even though her cradle was set beside Helen's, Tyndareus ignored Clytemnestra, his own flesh and blood. The wet nurse who suckled both princesses preferred Helen, who took the breast without fuss and thrived. Clytemnestra refused to suck. She bit. She spat out the milk and screamed. The nurse fed her from a bottle with a clay teat in the shape of a poppy-head. For years afterwards, Clytemnestra could recall the taste of opium and the deadening of her senses. She blamed the wet nurse and the drug for both her lack of emotion and her ability to feel too much. Their mother Leda did not speak of the circumstances of their birth, but there were always servants who would gossip, especially as the children grew older and began to display the traits of their sires. Four children from two fathers, hatched from two eggs - Castor and Clytemnestra in one, Helen and Pollux in the other. The servants whispered that Zeus the Thunderer had lain with Leda in the shape of a swan. Clytemnestra sidled into the kitchens and listened from the shadows while the cook, a garrulous man who sang songs and wove tales as he seasoned and spiced and carved the food for the royal table, told tales of a great white bird and parted white thighs. Though Clytemnestra didn't understand everything the cook said, she observed the reactions around her. The male servants would thump their fists and whistle their appreciation, and the maids would blush and giggle. From this, Clytemnestra understood that her mother was perceived as an object - not as a queen, as was her due, but as a woman to be desired, pitied, and scorned. Whenever they walked by the river, Clytemnestra would hold Helen's arm tight. The servants following after them would nod and murmur their approval of such sisterly devotion. Clytemnestra liked to point at the swans. \"There's your father,\" she would say in an undertone, indicating the large mute bird with its graceful long neck and its elegant snowy wings. Helen never replied. She kept her eyes downcast, a blush mantling her cheeks. She even managed to make humiliation beautiful. The polished bronze mirrors showed Clytemnestra that she was attractive in an ordinary way, but what good was ordinary beauty when Helen claimed a shimmering, Olympian-given beauty? Clytemnestra was as dark as Helen was fair, yet few people seemed to notice her black hair, pansy-dark eyes and smooth golden skin. Occasionally, traders and bards from the east passed through Sparta. Clytemnestra and Castor always took their place near the hearth first, and their dark good looks often provoked favourable comment from the easterners. \"Like the goddess Astarte!\" one man cried, his gaze admiring as he looked at Clytemnestra. She preened, pleased with the compliment, until Helen and Pollux entered the room and the man clutched his breast and sighed, staring at Helen. \"A vision of perfection! Truly, Aphrodite is come amongst us!\" Astarte and Aphrodite: one goddess, two names. Though she knew the trader had been in his cups and was probably seeking the best way to praise the royal daughters, Clytemnestra wondered if the compliments had deeper meaning. She puzzled over this for days. The girls were on the cusp of womanhood; Helen slower to fill out her curves, Clytemnestra the first to wear the bundled cloth to soak up her menstrual blood. Clytemnestra began casting bold looks at the youths gathered at her father's court. Though they professed devotion to the beautiful Helen, their expressions held only a wistful hope, bland and insipid. When they met Clytemnestra's challenging gaze, they sent her scorching, assessing glances, and Clytemnestra knew she would have power over men. Her certainty strengthened on the day Helen was abducted by Theseus of Athens and his Lapith companion Pirithous. Clytemnestra's jealousy vanished, melted like wax in the sun, as she watched her family weep and rage. She shed no tears, felt no anger. Instead she realised that Helen's beauty was a passive thing, a poisonous thing. Though still so young, Helen was made aware of her looks every day, and was taught to fear the effects of time. Now her beauty had made her an object of desire. Theseus didn't want Helen for her dowry or political alliance, or for her skill at weaving or her sweet nature. He wanted her because she, like him, was a child of Zeus, and because she was beautiful. Clytemnestra realised that, if handled carefully, beauty could be a weapon. But Helen's beauty made her weak, a victim of man's lust - just as their mother Leda became a victim of Zeus' lust. While she waited for her brothers to rescue her sister, Clytemnestra swore by the dark goddess Nemesis that she would never allow herself to be the victim of any man. Instead of jealousy, she felt a fierce love for her pitiful sister. From then on, Clytemnestra would not be judged against Helen. Helen would be judged against Clytemnestra. When Helen returned, she brought with her Theseus' mother, Queen Aethra, who attested that Helen had not been violated during her abduction. The word of a queen was not enough for Tyndareus, who ordered doctors and midwives to examine his precious daughter. Clytemnestra sat beside her sister and held Helen's hand while the examination took place. Helen wept, and so Clytemnestra leaned close, letting her hair down to shield her sister's face from the curious gaze of the servants. Later, her virginity declared intact, Helen was welcomed back to her father's table with great ceremony. Afterwards, their bellies full and their tongues loosened by wine, the sisters lay on the bed in the room they shared and whispered to one another beneath the light of the full moon. Clytemnestra had grown accustomed to sleeping alone and had come to think of the room as hers, but she put aside her selfishness in order to listen to Helen's tale. \"Men rape a woman and call it marriage,\" Clytemnestra said, careful to keep her voice neutral after Helen had poured out the story. She'd heard the frantic whispered conversation between the doctors and midwives and knew her sister was no virgin despite what Tyndareus had been told. \"I love him,\" Helen said, and snuffled into her sister's shoulder. \"Theseus is the most handsome man I've ever seen. I love him. I'll die without him.\" Clytemnestra patted Helen's hair. \"You won't die.\" A month later, their father announced that Clytemnestra's marriage would take place within three days. The news shocked her, but Helen clapped her hands in delight. \"They're only marrying me off to drive up the bidding on you,\" Clytemnestra told her. \"Father adds to your list of potential suitors daily. By announcing my wedding, he's signalling that your marriage is almost imminent.\" Helen's excited expression slid into consternation. \"I still think of Theseus,\" she said, but her tone suggested otherwise. Clytemnestra married Tantalus, king of Pisa, an ordinary man from the extraordinary house of Atreus. Her new husband spent the wedding feast staring at Helen. When they went to bed, Clytemnestra made certain he knew which sister he'd wedded. Her deflowering was painful, and she bled as if he'd wounded her with a sea-lance. In retaliation, she scratched and bit and gave Tantalus a black eye. A petty war broke out between Pisa and Mycenae. Tantalus, puffed up with importance, went out to defend his city. Clytemnestra took charge in his absence, enjoying the taste of authority. Certain that the women, children and elderly were safe within the walls and that the city was well provisioned in case of a siege, she sat at a window overlooking the plain and watched the plumes of dust in the distance. As evening fell, she saw a lone horseman break from the dust and ride towards the city. Unafraid of whatever news he brought, she sat at her table and was writing to her sister when she heard that her husband was dead. \"Murdered, Highness,\" the messenger cried, sweat cutting rivulets through the dust masking his face. \"Cut down by Agamemnon of Mycenae. I have orders for you, Highness, the last command of your husband. He begged you to flee before Agamemnon seizes the city. Flee to your father and beg for his support.\" Clytemnestra considered the messenger's words. \"Agamemnon, you said? He is distant cousin to my husband.\" \"Yes, Highness. He offends against the gods with this unholy act. Blood-guilt will be upon him.\" The messenger shifted, obviously impatient at her lack of urgency. \"But hurry, gather your jewels and your women, you must flee!\" She smiled and remained where she sat, deaf to the messenger's pleas. When she heard the thunder of horses' hooves and the clank of bronze armour outside the city walls, she stood and walked through the courtyard. Her people called to her for protection, and she promised all would be well. Clytemnestra opened the gates and faced her husband's murderer. Agamemnon was not handsome. He was rough and brutish, with a thick black beard. Yet when he saw her, his expression softened and he looked at her with desire. \"Welcome to Pisa, my lord.\" She dipped her head to acknowledge him, then turned her back and walked away, leaving behind her a stunned silence. Only when she reached the steps of the great hall did Agamemnon call out to her. \"Lady, under what terms do you surrender this city?\" She looked over her shoulder. \"Today I lost my husband. Tomorrow, I will take another. Marry me, Agamemnon of Mycenae, and Pisa is yours.\" Agamemnon shouted with laughter. \"Clytemnestra, you are a woman without peer. I will marry you, and make you Queen of Mycenae and Pisa.\" Clytemnestra continued her letter to Helen later that night, after her first coupling with Agamemnon. His wildness had excited her; she rode him astride, both of them laughing, both of them falling in love. Not that she would tell Helen of such things in so direct a manner, but she felt she had to communicate her joy somehow. For the first time in her life, she wanted Helen to share her feelings. She wanted Helen to enjoy the pleasure of a powerful man rather than the inept fumblings of a pretty princeling. The house of Atreus calls to us and commands us, she wrote. Use your influence with Father. Insist upon Menelaus as your husband. Two sisters wedded to two strong brothers! How perfect it will be.",

      "Theseus didn't want Helen for her dowry or political alliance, or for her skill at weaving or her sweet nature.",
      "He wanted her because she, like him, was a child of Zeus, and because she was beautiful.",
      "Clytemnestra realised that, if handled carefully, beauty could be a weapon.",
      "But Helen's beauty made her weak, a victim of man's lust - just as their mother Leda became a victim of Zeus' lust.",
      "While she waited for her brothers to rescue her sister, Clytemnestra swore by the dark goddess Nemesis that she would never allow herself to be the victim of any man.",
      "Instead of jealousy, she felt a fierce love for her pitiful sister.",
      "From then on, Clytemnestra would not be judged against Helen.",
      "Helen would be judged against Clytemnestra.",
      "When Helen returned, she brought with her Theseus' mother, Queen Aethra, who attested that Helen had not been violated during her abduction.",
      "The word of a queen was not enough for Tyndareus, who ordered doctors and midwives to examine his precious daughter.",
      "Clytemnestra sat beside her sister and held Helen's hand while the examination took place.",
      "Helen wept, and so Clytemnestra leaned close, letting her hair down to shield her sister's face from the curious gaze of the servants.",
      "Later, her virginity declared intact, Helen was welcomed back to her father's table with great ceremony.",
      "Afterwards, their bellies full and their tongues loosened by wine, the sisters lay on the bed in the room they shared and whispered to one another beneath the light of the full moon.",
      "Clytemnestra had grown accustomed to sleeping alone and had come to think of the room as hers, but she put aside her selfishness in order to listen to Helen's tale.",
      "\"Men rape a woman and call it marriage,\" Clytemnestra said, careful to keep her voice neutral after Helen had poured out the story.",
      "She'd heard the frantic whispered conversation between the doctors and midwives and knew her sister was no virgin despite what Tyndareus had been told.",
      "\"I love him,\" Helen said, and snuffled into her sister's shoulder.",
      "\"Theseus is the most handsome man I've ever seen.",
      "I love him.",
      "I'll die without him.\"",
      "Clytemnestra patted Helen's hair.",
      "\"You won't die.\"",
      "A month later, their father announced that Clytemnestra's marriage would take place within three days.",
      "The news shocked her, but Helen clapped her hands in delight.",
      "\"They're only marrying me off to drive up the bidding on you,\" Clytemnestra told her.",
      "\"Father adds to your list of potential suitors daily.",
      "By announcing my wedding, he's signalling that your marriage is almost imminent.\"",
      "Helen's excited expression slid into consternation.",
      "\"I still think of Theseus,\" she said, but her tone suggested otherwise.",
      "Clytemnestra married Tantalus, king of Pisa, an ordinary man from the extraordinary house of Atreus.",
      "Her new husband spent the wedding feast staring at Helen.",
      "When they went to bed, Clytemnestra made certain he knew which sister he'd wedded.",
      "Her deflowering was painful, and she bled as if he'd wounded her with a sea-lance.",
      "In retaliation, she scratched and bit and gave Tantalus a black eye.",
      "A petty war broke out between Pisa and Mycenae.",
      "Tantalus, puffed up with importance, went out to defend his city.",
      "Clytemnestra took charge in his absence, enjoying the taste of authority.",
      "Certain that the women, children and elderly were safe within the walls and that the city was well provisioned in case of a siege, she sat at a window overlooking the plain and watched the plumes of dust in the distance.",
      "As evening fell, she saw a lone horseman break from the dust and ride towards the city.",
      "Unafraid of whatever news he brought, she sat at her table and was writing to her sister when she heard that her husband was dead.",
      "\"Murdered, Highness,\" the messenger cried, sweat cutting rivulets through the dust masking his face.",
      "\"Cut down by Agamemnon of Mycenae.",
      "I have orders for you, Highness, the last command of your husband.",
      "He begged you to flee before Agamemnon seizes the city.",
      "Flee to your father and beg for his support.\"",
      "Clytemnestra considered the messenger's words.",
      "\"Agamemnon, you said?",
      "He is distant cousin to my husband.\"",
      "\"Yes, Highness.",
      "He offends against the gods with this unholy act.",
      "Blood-guilt will be upon him.\"",
      "The messenger shifted, obviously impatient at her lack of urgency.",
      "\"But hurry, gather your jewels and your women, you must flee!\"",
      "She smiled and remained where she sat, deaf to the messenger's pleas.",
      "When she heard the thunder of horses' hooves and the clank of bronze armour outside the city walls, she stood and walked through the courtyard.",
      "Her people called to her for protection, and she promised all would be well.",
      "Clytemnestra opened the gates and faced her husband's murderer.",
      "Agamemnon was not handsome.",
      "He was rough and brutish, with a thick black beard.",
      "Yet when he saw her, his expression softened and he looked at her with desire.",
      "\"Welcome to Pisa, my lord.\"",
      "She dipped her head to acknowledge him, then turned her back and walked away, leaving behind her a stunned silence.",
      "Only when she reached the steps of the great hall did Agamemnon call out to her.",
      "\"Lady, under what terms do you surrender this city?\"",
      "She looked over her shoulder.",
      "\"Today I lost my husband.",
      "Tomorrow, I will take another.",
      "Marry me, Agamemnon of Mycenae, and Pisa is yours.\"",
      "Agamemnon shouted with laughter.",
      "\"Clytemnestra, you are a woman without peer.",
      "I will marry you, and make you Queen of Mycenae and Pisa.\"",
      "Clytemnestra continued her letter to Helen later that night, after her first coupling with Agamemnon.",
      "His wildness had excited her; she rode him astride, both of them laughing, both of them falling in love.",
      "Not that she would tell Helen of such things in so direct a manner, but she felt she had to communicate her joy somehow.",
      "For the first time in her life, she wanted Helen to share her feelings.",
      "She wanted Helen to enjoy the pleasure of a powerful man rather than the inept fumblings of a pretty princeling.",
      "The house of Atreus calls to us and commands us, she wrote.",
      "Use your influence with Father.",
      "Insist upon Menelaus as your husband.",
      "Two sisters wedded to two strong brothers!",
      "How perfect it will be."

    "text": "The palace of Proteus was a far cry from the cave on Mount Nysa where Dionysos had spent his formative years. When he'd arrived on Pharos, his ship steered to the island more by the wiles of Boreas than by any ability of the helmsman, Dionysos had been annoyed. Egypt was where he'd wanted to go, after he'd heard tales of a great river that ran backwards, where cats were worshipped and where women made water standing up. Instead, the black ship beached itself on the shores of Pharos, the island that lay just shy of the Nile Delta. Its king, Proteus, came out to meet him in person, and greeted him with every respect due to a son of Zeus: albeit a son of Zeus who laboured under the punishment of jealous Hera. Dionysos' memory of his past was shaky. Fragments of recollection came to him at odd times, like snatches of a half-forgotten dream. Some of the things he remembered were surely fantasy, images wrought of the madness he suffered, but when he spoke of these memories to his followers, sometimes they would tell him it was not fantasy but the truth. Dionysos couldn't remember why he'd set out on his wanderings. Whenever he asked the satyrs and Maenads who followed him so assiduously, they gave him always the same answer: \"We travel to spread the truth!\" \"The truth of what?\" he would ask, his brow furrowing in confusion. His followers would protest, pleading with him not to frown for fear it would mar his beauty and render his countenance dissolute. Only when he was calm would they make their reply: \"The truth brought by the vine!\" His black ship was laden with amphorae, each one holding a different wine. From Mykonos came a strong, astringent white. From Naxos, he had a red, thick and syrupy, almost unpalatable unless it was watered down. And from Thera: a glorious full-bodied black, rich with the taste of the volcano. These were just the wines gathered from the Circling Islands. Dionysos had a host of other vintages culled from the lands of the Middle Sea, and each wine was his own creation. The amphorae were stowed in the prow and along the ship's bows. His followers had breached several during their voyage, but still the wine flowed without cease. Dionysos was the wellspring of wine: his blood, the juice of the grape. Wherever he was made welcome, he would take an amphora of the wine best suited to the personality of his host. At Pharos, he selected a wine of Thrace that tasted of the wilderness and the mountains. Leaving his followers to their own drunken, debauched devices, he descended from the ship, carrying the amphora cradled in his arms like a babe. Proteus waited. He was not, as Dionysos had expected, a wizened old man with a hoary beard and pale, red-rimmed eyes. Neither was he as gaudily noble as Zeus, or as quietly elegant as his beloved grandmother, Rhea. She had aged well, vanishing in the golden time of the old gods, sustained by her Mysteries. One day, Dionysos knew, he would be initiated into them. But not yet: not so soon. He had to make his own way in the world first, and he had to learn his own truths by which all gods measure mankind and one another. Proteus, the Old Man of the Sea, was unlike any other god he'd met. Tall and handsome, but with age worn through him, the way the sea shapes a rock into a pebble and thence to a grain of sand, Proteus wore his many years with dignity. His skin was tight, but his smile was soft and his eyes young and bright. He looked at Dionysos with pleasure: the anticipation of news from far-flung places and an admiration to which Dionysos, well aware of his beauty but not yet certain enough to trade on it, was accustomed. Proteus ordered his servants to attend to his guest's every need. Dionysos was shown to a room overlooking the Delta. The narrow stretch of water between island and mainland made him want to be done with the politeness demanded of xenia. He wanted to be free to wander, untrammelled, through the desert land. He wondered how the vine would fare in such a country: if the resultant wine would taste dry and arid, or if the black soil disgorged by the inundation of the Nile would render it full and rich. He took the amphora down to dinner. Under the curious gaze of Proteus, he banished the servants and poured the wine himself. He offered the first cup to his host, sitting quietly upon his couch as he waited for a reaction. Proteus drank. He did so slowly, thoughtfully. His lips glistened and his eyes hooded as he felt the effects, and then he smiled. Dionysos poured more wine, this time for them both. \"This is a glorious wine, Dionysos, almost akin to the heavenly nectar drunk by the Olympians.\" Proteus held up his goblet, swirling the dark liquid around the golden bowl to release its scent. He looked sidelong at his guest. \"There are rumours, you know: rumours that with this new drink, this wine, you seek to become a second Prometheus for humankind.\" Dionysos managed a smile. \"The gift of fire is perhaps more useful than the gift of fermented grapes.\" \"One could argue that, indeed. But there are some who would not be convinced.\" \"Are you one of them?\" Proteus shrugged, a slight movement that rustled the band of gold-threaded linen he wore over his shoulders. \"I try to avoid controversy. My opinion is scarcely valid in the wider scheme of things.\" \"You are the Old Man of the Sea, one of the wisest of the old gods,\" Dionysos protested. \"How can your opinion carry no weight when you know everything?\" \"That's precisely why I cannot have an opinion.\" Dionysos sat back on his couch and tucked his feet beneath him \"Very well. So your remark that I was a new Prometheus...\" \"Purely an observation, dear boy. Think nothing of it.\" It was impossible for him to do that. Dionysos snorted. \"I grant there is a certain similarity. Something happened in Attika that made me wonder at what I was doing. The comparison with Prometheus was there at the edge of my mind. But it is not a tale for the dinner-table.\" Proteus raised his eyebrows, waiting. Dionysos sighed and put down his cup. \"Before I left on my travels, I wanted to pass on the secret of viticulture. Training the vines, pressing the grapes, creating from the richness of the crop a drink unparalleled... It is not that I fear menial tasks, but I believed that humankind should learn this art for themselves.\" \"Indeed,\" Proteus murmured, his expression neutral. \"My choice fell on a peasant of the Attic plains, Ikarios by name,\" Dionysos continued. \"He was like the vine himself, strong and sturdy, skin as dark as the grape from his years of labour in the fields. He had a daughter, young and comely, called Erigone. They were simple people. In their hands, the gift I gave them would not be abused. \"Ikarios was quick to learn. The men of Attika do not easily trust strangers, but he respected me for all that my disguise was that of a Phoenician sailor. We planted vines and I made them grow, much faster than their natural rate. He understood then that I was no mere sailor, but still he treated me with the same respect. He did not fear the gods - why should he? He had done nothing wrong.\" \"Ah,\" Proteus interrupted, \"I sense hubris.\" \"I did not think it was.\" Dionysos gazed into his cup. The surface of the wine shivered. \"But just because a man does nothing wrong, it does not mean he is innocent. Ikarios' only crime was to hold me in the same regard as any other man, even when he knew I was a god. I am not so haughty that I find this disrespectful, but to those watching me, it was seen as an insult.\" \"Lady Hera is jealous,\" Proteus observed. \"She may despise your existence, but, to her, it is more grievous that your godhead was ignored. It reflects badly on her husband, faithless though he is. But, please: I would hear the end of this.\" Dionysos took a sip of the wine, letting its taste rest on his tongue for a moment. It reminded him of home. Whenever he drank it, he could almost believe he was transported back to Mount Nysa. He wondered what image, if any, it conjured for Proteus, but he did not want to ask. \"Ikarios gathered in the crop,\" he continued, \"assisted by his daughter. They pressed the grapes, and in due time, they produced wine. They took it into the village to share with their neighbours. At first, the wine was greeted with enthusiasm. Such a drink had never been tasted before, and the effects it had were exciting and unusual. Soon, everyone was happy. \"But then they overindulged, and happiness turned sour. Men began to clutch their heads and bellies; they vomited where they stood. A cry arose: Ikarios has poisoned us! And so,\" Dionysos paused, \"and so they killed him. They took him to the fountain and forced him to drink the pure spring water until his body could no longer hold it and it spewed from him. He drowned.\" Proteus set down his cup, but kept its bowl cradled in his palms. \"The next day, Erigone searched for her father. None of the villagers could recall what had become of him. They had sore heads; their memories of the night before were hazy and indistinct, and yet they remembered the freedom the wine had offered. They asked Erigone for more wine. \"She found Ikarios at last, floating facedown in the fountain. Horrified by the damage wrought by the wine and grieving for her father, Erigone hanged herself. \"And thus,\" Dionysos finished softly, \"wine and death are inseparable companions amongst mankind. Prometheus' gift of fire ended with his perpetual torment, but it made life better for humans. I am not sure that my gift can make the same claim.\" \"But wine could make a man forget he was cold and had no fire,\" Proteus said. \"A man heady with your gift can forget many things. Just look at your followers. How many of them know who they are?\" \"They are Bacchants.\" \"Yes. They define themselves through you. Conformity, not individuality. A mass sacrifice to the vine.\" Proteus tilted his head, regarding his guest thoughtfully. \"That is a powerful gift, son of Zeus. Powerful, and dangerous. Perhaps more dangerous than fire: for when Prometheus was punished, Zeus punished humankind, too. He sent Epimetheus, the brother of Prometheus, a beautiful woman - and with her came a box...\" \"Pandora.\" Dionysos grimaced and took another sip of his wine as if to rid himself of the taste of that name. \"Your wine is like Pandora's box. Drink enough of it, and it evokes many emotions: love, joy, lust, anger, misery, hope. Which of those is the true state of a man? Does wine release inner truth, or does it cloud perception with falsehood?\" Dionysos sighed. \"I meant for it only to bring joy and to ease heartache.\" \"Prometheus was the same,\" Proteus said, but not unkindly. \"Humans are created idealistic, but gods?\" \"I hope that, when I am the same age as you, I will be able to wear my jaded nature with as much elegance and ease as you do now.\" Proteus laughed. \"You won't.\" \"You are so certain?\" \"Of course. Have you drunk so much of your own wine that you forget I have the gift of prophecy?\" Proteus's eyes gleamed with amusement. \"Usually I do not give away my prophecies without a fight, but for you, I am willing to offer it freely - if you wish for a prophecy, that is. You should be aware, my lord Dionysos, that you carry the selfsame gift within you, although you are not yet tested enough in the world to make oracular pronouncements. But it will come.\" Dionysos considered. He did not think he wanted to know what his future held, not when he remembered so little of the past. Besides, he knew he was afflicted by madness: when he was in his right mind, perhaps he would return and question Proteus again. Until then, he asked the first question that came to him. \"The villagers in Attika - were they right in calling my wine a poison?\" Proteus held his gaze, his expression intent as if the answer came from deep within him. \"In the future, it will be claimed that only in drunkenness do men speak the truth. Your prophecies, dear one, will come through wine, and wine makes one forget the truths that are told. It will be a curse as well as a boon.\" Dionysos felt disappointed. \"Then truth is poison.\" \"That is why you suffer now.\" Proteus held out his goblet. \"Pour me another.\"",

    "text": "The stream trickled past, its source somewhere up the cliff face. No cascading waterfall, no tumultuous rapids. This was not a proper magic river. The water came down reluctantly, taking its sweet time. The war goddess shot her guide a disdainful look. Unimpressive. She would have stepped over it, maybe getting a sandal slightly damp, if she still had feet. Nothing remained of Eris but the intangible shade she once was, before matter coalesced, before the gods transformed into beings of flesh. Just as dying humans returned to dust, beings like Eris returned to shadow. She didn't like that, not one bit, so Persephone gave her the choice she gave everyone. The nature goddess was Queen of the Underworld, now, of death and rebirth, darkness and sunlight. She didn't appear personally to every soul, leaving that up to Charon the Ferryman, but this was her sister before her, stripped from her physical form. Strange, really, how the war above had turned out, but Persephone didn't ask how it was possible her ancient sister hovered by the banks of the Lethe, faced with this choice, of all things. \"You know what this is, don't you, sister?\" the Queen asked, referring to more than just the underwhelming stream. A skeptical Eris replied, \"The Styx is endless! You seriously want me to believe this puddle is one of the Five?\" Persephone allowed herself a small smile. \"This is the Lethe, the river of forgetfulness. I give you the choice, sister, to be reincarnated, if you wish, but there is one requirement. You must drink this water and remember nothing.\" Eris' rage stirred the air around her. Persephone felt it but didn't let her serene smile falter. This was hard, more difficult for her than Eris would ever know. Eris would be the first god to do so, if she chose a second life. The results were unpredictable, and to demand a goddess drink from the Lethe was unconscionable. The rules were rules, though, not to mention, if Eris were made mortal, what madness could befall a human with a god's millennia of memories? It would be a cruel torment. Eris stalled for time, inwardly wracked with grief and fear. She would have sobbed if she still had eyes, and was glad she hadn't any, because she could never let Persephone see her weep. She thanked Nyx she remembered the loophole. \"You've got to be kidding me, Persey. I know about Mnemosyne's pool. Humans know about it. You must take me there immediately. It will allow me to retain my memories beyond death.\" Persephone shook her head. \"It is a myth concocted by frightened mortals, Eris. The Underworld only contains the five rivers. Besides, Mnemosyne has no power here.\" \"She's the goddess of memory. She can manipulate minds!\" \"She isn't here and there is no water of memory, only water of forgetting. You must drink before the next step.\" Persephone gazed sternly at the spot Eris' eyes would be. She couldn't know for sure, but she suspected the war goddess was glaring back. \"You haven't even told me what that is, and you expect me to forfeit my identity?\" \"You can be reincarnated, Eris.\" Persephone said for the second time, trying to keep the impatience out of her tone. \"You can live on, have a second chance at life.\" \"I will retain my power, will I not?\" Eris asked hopefully. The Queen sighed. \"I cannot do that. I do not know how. This is the first time in our history that this has happened. You are the first of us to perish.\" That surely didn't mean...It couldn't mean...No, no, that wasn't right. That wasn't fair! \"A human?! You expect me to allow myself to be made human?!\" \"It is that or oblivion, sister.\" \"Losing my memories is my oblivion!\" Persephone shook her head. Nature goddess first, death god second, her heart ached at the thought of her sister's total extinction. She softened her voice, trying to be comforting. A soul somehow survived its remolding. \"You will still be you.\" \"But I won't know that, will I?\" Eris countered. None of the war gods ever listened to reason, Persephone thought. \"Drink,\" she commanded. \"No, I cannot.\" \"I am trying to save your life, Eris.\" Eris wondered why Persephone couldn't understand. The nature goddess had never been faced with such an ultimatum. She had suffered a cold marriage to Hades, but that was nothing remotely similar to this. \"I am trying to save my very existence!\" Eris shouted, losing composure, pain seeping into her voice. Persephone tried to think of how to persuade her. If Eris feared being forgotten, perhaps some assurance would help. She had a feeling humans would never forget the gods entirely. \"They will talk about you. They will compose songs and write plays. You will survive in stories. You may be thought a myth, but you will last through the ages, and one day, you will see your true name in a book and you will feel whole again.\" \"That is not enough!\" Eris cried. \"It is all I can give you!\" Persephone insisted. \"You try my patience! Take the water!\" Darkness suddenly fell, and the grass by the stream faded from green to brown, the flowers around Persephone's feet withering, though the Lethe continued to trickle past. Hades, Lord of the Underworld, approached the two goddesses. \"What is the commotion?\" he quietly asked, his voice deep, with a slight echo. \"Your niece will not drink of the Lethe,\" Persephone replied, head bowed. \"Hades, my Lord, you must allow me to drink of Mnemosyne's fountain!\" Eris pleaded. \"She cannot,\" Persephone interjected. She stepped closer to Hades, touching his arm. \"Husband, you do not understand. Her mind will burn up!\" Hades looked puzzled. A goddess dying was a sobering thought enough without contemplating what effect reincarnation could have on such a being. \"How can you be sure?\" \"Five thousand years in a human brain? Are you serious?\" \"Then she will merely die again and choose the Lethe to erase the pain.\" Simple solution, he thought. Trial and error. \"A human brain cannot even function with that much memory,\" Persephone protested. Hades shrugged. \"Shouldn't that be up to Mnemosyne?\" Eris gasped. So Persephone had lied, after all. \"She meddles in minds, I command souls,\" Persephone replied. \"The dead are our responsibility, not hers.\" Hades bent down and peered into the clear stream, then looked up at Eris' shade. He turned to his wife and said the first smart thing all day, in Eris' opinion. \"Have you even asked her?\" Eris hovered before the memory goddess, who gave the shade an appraising look. \"So you wish to retain your memories in the next life?\" \"I cannot live without the knowledge of what I am. I would rather cease to exist.\" Mnemosyne paused and thought. Eris thought she saw the goddess smirk. \"You don't understand how the human mind works, do you?\" \"I do not understand why this decision is not my own,\" Eris replied. \"A human thinks very differently from one of you war gods. From any god,\" Mnemosyne explained. \"That much memory, which you access so easily every moment, file with no trouble, calling up moments like pictures? A human memory doesn't function that way, not at all. And a war god? Even the most evil human has a shred of compassion, and that much hatred can't be held in such a fragile heart. They think of survival, then pleasure, then more often than not, they think of love, and you war gods have no love in you.\" Eris fleetingly thought of Deimos. She pictured his features softened, sitting with him in fresh grass feeling the wind. They had begun doing this more often, peacefully watching humans and struggling to understand them as they went about their daily lives. His brother Phobos came with them sometimes, and the three set out to explore every unfamiliar experience. They visited Parnassus, listened to music, attended Dionysus' parties, and lurked in the shadows of mundane places. Typically, they grew bored and played cruel tricks on mortals instead, but in the process, began to relate to each other as people and, this was the strangest part, talked to each other. Mnemosyne characterized the gods of the House of War as mindless vengeful specters, but she had misjudged at least three. \"Give me a drop. Just a drop, diluted in the waters of the Lethe. Let me retain some sense of self, please, I beseech you!\" Mnemosyne considered this, and with a pained look, reluctantly replied, \"Yes. Yes, I can do that. But just one drop.\" Eris would have danced with joy, another new activity she surprisingly found pleasure in, and perhaps now she could, in her new body. She could rejoice she had been given the chance to retain her identity despite the obstacles set by such villainous death gods! Persephone and Hades approached, a cup of the Lethe's water in the goddess' hands. Mnemosyne waved her palm over the dark pool, and placed her hand, palm-down, over the cup. A single drop fell from her hand into the clear water, turning it an ominous black. \"Drink,\" Hades commanded, and the shade of Eris reached out a spectral hand to take the cup. Hades touched her other hand, and the three gods could see her more clearly now. She was petite, but homely. Her long black hair was bushy and tangled, twigs, leaves and bits of dried blood and gore in it like the flowers Persephone weaved into her own. She wore a man's black tunic and leather boots underneath warriors' armor, the battered breastplate spattered with her own blood. A jagged black scar circled her neck. Eris took the cup and drank thirstily, licking the drops around her lips, praying to Nyx she didn't miss the one that truly mattered. Eris always prayed to Nyx, the goddess of night, because even gods had Creators, had mothers, and this one deserved all a young war goddess' thanks and gratitude. \"I am ready,\" Eris said, grinning confidently. Hades took Persephone's hand, and they pointed at Eris, whose form started to lose substance again. She watched as her hands vanished, then her arms, her anxiety growing as she became intangible again. She felt memories slipping. What was she doing here? Why was she in the Underworld? Had she died? How was that possible? Wasn't she immortal? She tried to hold onto one thought, one image, of Deimos smiling at her, a hint of love in his look, but even that slipped, and she gazed up at Mnemosyne, fearful and confused. The memory goddess had a sympathetic expression lacking in the death gods' features. They were emotionless as they worked their spell, stoic as statues, but in Eris' last moments of consciousness, she saw Mnemosyne holding her gaze with a mix of worry, hope, and guilt.",

      "Hades looked puzzled.",
      "A goddess dying was a sobering thought enough without contemplating what effect reincarnation could have on such a being.",
      "\"How can you be sure?\"",
      "\"Five thousand years in a human brain?",
      "Are you serious?\"",
      "\"Then she will merely die again and choose the Lethe to erase the pain.\"",
      "Simple solution, he thought.",
      "Trial and error.",
      "\"A human brain cannot even function with that much memory,\" Persephone protested.",
      "Hades shrugged.",
      "\"Shouldn't that be up to Mnemosyne?\" Eris gasped.",
      "So Persephone had lied, after all.",
      "\"She meddles in minds, I command souls,\" Persephone replied.",
      "\"The dead are our responsibility, not hers.\"",
      "Hades bent down and peered into the clear stream, then looked up at Eris' shade.",
      "He turned to his wife and said the first smart thing all day, in Eris' opinion.",
      "\"Have you even asked her?\"",
      "Eris hovered before the memory goddess, who gave the shade an appraising look.",
      "\"So you wish to retain your memories in the next life?\"",
      "\"I cannot live without the knowledge of what I am.",
      "I would rather cease to exist.\"",
      "Mnemosyne paused and thought.",
      "Eris thought she saw the goddess smirk.",
      "\"You don't understand how the human mind works, do you?\"",
      "\"I do not understand why this decision is not my own,\" Eris replied.",
      "\"A human thinks very differently from one of you war gods.",
      "From any god,\" Mnemosyne explained.",
      "\"That much memory, which you access so easily every moment, file with no trouble, calling up moments like pictures?",
      "A human memory doesn't function that way, not at all.",
      "And a war god?",
      "Even the most evil human has a shred of compassion, and that much hatred can't be held in such a fragile heart.",
      "They think of survival, then pleasure, then more often than not, they think of love, and you war gods have no love in you.\"",
      "Eris fleetingly thought of Deimos.",
      "She pictured his features softened, sitting with him in fresh grass feeling the wind.",
      "They had begun doing this more often, peacefully watching humans and struggling to understand them as they went about their daily lives.",
      "His brother Phobos came with them sometimes, and the three set out to explore every unfamiliar experience.",
      "They visited Parnassus, listened to music, attended Dionysus' parties, and lurked in the shadows of mundane places.",
      "Typically, they grew bored and played cruel tricks on mortals instead, but in the process, began to relate to each other as people and, this was the strangest part, talked to each other.",
      "Mnemosyne characterized the gods of the House of War as mindless vengeful specters, but she had misjudged at least three.",
      "\"Give me a drop.",
      "Just a drop, diluted in the waters of the Lethe.",
      "Let me retain some sense of self, please, I beseech you!\"",
      "Mnemosyne considered this, and with a pained look, reluctantly replied, \"Yes.",
      "Yes, I can do that.",
      "But just one drop.\"",
      "Eris would have danced with joy, another new activity she surprisingly found pleasure in, and perhaps now she could, in her new body.",
      "She could rejoice she had been given the chance to retain her identity despite the obstacles set by such villainous death gods!",
      "Persephone and Hades approached, a cup of the Lethe's water in the goddess' hands.",
      "Mnemosyne waved her palm over the dark pool, and placed her hand, palm-down, over the cup.",
      "A single drop fell from her hand into the clear water, turning it an ominous black.",
      "\"Drink,\" Hades commanded, and the shade of Eris reached out a spectral hand to take the cup.",
      "Hades touched her other hand, and the three gods could see her more clearly now.",
      "She was petite, but homely.",
      "Her long black hair was bushy and tangled, twigs, leaves and bits of dried blood and gore in it like the flowers Persephone weaved into her own.",
      "She wore a man's black tunic and leather boots underneath warriors' armor, the battered breastplate spattered with her own blood.",
      "A jagged black scar circled her neck.",
      "Eris took the cup and drank thirstily, licking the drops around her lips, praying to Nyx she didn't miss the one that truly mattered.",
      "Eris always prayed to Nyx, the goddess of night, because even gods had Creators, had mothers, and this one deserved all a young war goddess' thanks and gratitude.",
      "\"I am ready,\" Eris said, grinning confidently.",
      "Hades took Persephone's hand, and they pointed at Eris, whose form started to lose substance again.",
      "She watched as her hands vanished, then her arms, her anxiety growing as she became intangible again.",
      "She felt memories slipping.",
      "What was she doing here?",
      "Why was she in the Underworld?",
      "Had she died?",
      "How was that possible?",
      "Wasn't she immortal?",
      "She tried to hold onto one thought, one image, of Deimos smiling at her, a hint of love in his look, but even that slipped, and she gazed up at Mnemosyne, fearful and confused.",
      "The memory goddess had a sympathetic expression lacking in the death gods' features.",
      "They were emotionless as they worked their spell, stoic as statues, but in Eris' last moments of consciousness, she saw Mnemosyne holding her gaze with a mix of worry, hope, and guilt."

    "text": "Mnemosyne would later smugly comment that Eris had no shred of love in her black heart. The same could be said for her two closest companions, despite their origins. Everyone had wondered, what side would the twin sons of War and Love choose? They blinked their baby eyes with fire and ice, black midnight hair and shock white. Lurking in shadows, the twins caused discomfort when they entered a room, and left a sense of foreboding as they left one. They even gave Ares the creeps. Aphrodite didn't bother trying to turn them. Eris always found it odd to see godlings flit about in physical forms, running through the halls of Olympus tripping over their sandals when they could easily teleport. The twins would compete with each other, testing their speed, strength, and talents at frightening people. They played pranks on members of the court without using their powers, hiding behind pillars and stifling mad giggles. Eris couldn't relate. They looked so very much like humans, except for the eyes. When she was their age, which she couldn't remember very well, she manifested from shadow, just a feeling in the air, intangible. An uneasy feeling in the gut. One of the boys, Deimos, said her presence was like hearing a flute gone flat and started calling her Discord. She called the boy Terror, but teased that he couldn't scare the hair off a cat. Eris was petite and homely. Her long black hair was usually bushy and tangled, and she often wore a man's black tunic with leather boots, underneath a warrior's armor, her hair frizzed out over the battered breastplate, a sheathed sword on her belt. If she really wanted to give a good impression, she would put on a flowing crimson dress, typically a chiton. The war goddess didn't bother shortening the long garment to her height, but let it drag behind her, accumulating dust and filth, developing ragged edges. The other gods got the impression she left these articles banging around the bottom of a rusted chest, unlaundered for centuries, but Eris could recreate the look with a hand wave. Ares had summoned her to his temple for a meeting, so it was an occasion that warranted her red chiton. She hurried there now. Quite some time had passed since the twins had come to annoy her, and their father, the war god Ares, only mentioned them in passing. Eris had teamed with Ares for millennia, manipulating mortals and orchestrating wars. Her diminutive stature belied her ferocity on the battlefield. Eris was the goddess of discord and strife, and she could insinuate herself quietly into a situation to foment chaos, but Ares brought her to battle for her blazing rage. Quakes rumbled beneath her feet, flames shot from her hands, her small form would grow, and she would let out a piercing shriek to deafen foes. Ecstatic from the bloodshed, the war goddess reveled in such destructive victories. Ares had an unparalleled ally in Eris, who doubled as subtle saboteur and nightmare creature. Eris didn't expect to leave Ares' spotlight so soon, but there they were, the two brats, standing before her. Nyx damn it. Ares sat in his throne looking bored, leg flung over one armrest, his now-adult sons flanking him. Pale, raven-haired Phobos stood to his right, and met Eris' gaze with eyes that made her shift on her feet and swallow hard, fear rising in her gut. Tan, white-haired Deimos wasn't half as creepy, unless he put in the effort. His specialty was actually a form of panic - that stark, surprising realization of an oncoming threat. The desire to flee more than anything. Phobos' grim stare made Eris consider leaving the room, but Deimos just looked cocky, like if he opened his mouth, something inane would come out in the guise of wit. \"Hey Discord, I think you made a wrong turn. The Ugly Convention is down the hall.\" Like that. \"You speak when spoken to,\" Ares reprimanded his son. Deimos looked sheepish but once his father turned away, mouthed something at Eris. \"You look hot.\" She just rolled her eyes. Hadn't she babysat the freak? \"I thank you for coming, sister,\" Ares said. \"I am in need of your...\" He paused, making his tone suggestive. \"...Talents.\" \"My talents?\" Eris repeated, raising an eyebrow. She sauntered towards the throne, changing her gait so her hips - what she had for hips, at least - swayed from side to side. He shot her a flirtatious grin, but swiftly turned serious. \"It is well past the time my sons must taste their first blood, and I can think of no better tutor. There is a conflict brewing between two armies in Macedon.\" \"That pitiful little kingdom?\" Eris snorted. Ares glowered. Much like his sons, his eyes took on a solid color, a bloody red, but only for the briefest moment before he put on a smile. \"You're backing them, aren't you?\" Eris said. \"You want Macedon to expand its territory.\" \"Precisely, and you're the most ruthless goddess I know, not to mention inventive, so I'm putting you in charge of half the operation.\" Eris couldn't help but swell with pride. She always craved Ares' rarely given praise. Despite their chemistry on the battlefield, they had become distant from each other since his romance with Aphrodite. But she was no longer in the picture; something to do with stalking a human called Adonis. Without her presence, Eris could sweep back into his life. And his sons' lives. \"I'm flattered, Ares, but you don't seriously expect me to babysit your brats?\" \"Excuse me, we're standing right here,\" Deimos groused. Ares stood up. With eyes narrowed, he approached Eris, who was over a head shorter. He tilted her chin up, her lips sealed in a pout. He leaned close to whisper in her ear. \"You will obey me.\" Louder, for his sons' benefit, he added, \"I will give you Deimos to command as you will.\" Before she could protest, he added, \"He will make an excellent lieutenant, Eris. As will Phobos, which is why he will be with me.\" \"Him? You want to pair me with him?\" \"I, for one, am in favor of this decision, Father,\" Deimos said. \"Phobos, I feel you will make a much better lieutenant,\" Eris said. \"For my purposes,\" she hastily added, noticing Ares' increasing agitation. \"I have commanded you and still you defy me? I am your superior, Eris, not merely your brother. I am War!\" he bellowed. \"Actually, Athena might have something to say about that,\" Deimos added without thinking. Before Ares could respond to Deimos' flippant comment, Phobos finally spoke, \"Father, I understand our aunt's frustration. She and my brother have never gotten along very well. Perhaps it would also be wise to keep Deimos close by you so you may better instruct him.\" He winked at Eris. This one was a keeper, no question. Deimos snapped, \"And why wouldn't you need 'better instruction?'\" \"Frankly, I'm not as hotheaded as you are,\" his brother replied. \"What's done is done, Phobos is with me. I need his subtlety,\" Ares said. At Deimos' hurt look, he added, \"And Eris needs your skills with panic. Hers is the second phase of my plan - shock and awe. You provide the shock, she provides the awe. Got it? Good. Now get out of my sight, all three of you.\" Outside the temple, Deimos sidled up to Eris. \"So, Discord, why are you so afraid to be close to me, anyway?\" Unhesitant, she replied, \"Because you're a pain in the ass.\" \"Well, I could be,\" he said, leering. \"You're disgusting, you know that?\" \"What in Zeus' name is your problem, woman?\" \"You're my problem, but not for long. You're my subordinate, so I order you to leave me alone until the day of the battle.\" \"We have to plan. And that's gonna require quite a bit of time. Long hours, just the two of us. We could get take-out. I think there's a kebab place around here.\" Phobos, sitting against the temple wall some yards away, stifled a laugh, bringing him to the others' attention. The silent fear god had a sense of humor, at least, probably from Aphrodite's side. No doubt the same reason Deimos was so Nyx-damned annoying, just like his mother. \"What's so funny?\" Eris asked, tapping her foot. \"You guys make life so much less lonely,\" Phobos said, chuckling, before realizing his mistake. His face fell, and he tried to put his stone-cold mask of a face back on, getting a puzzled mix of sympathy and pity from the others. War gods didn't confess feelings like that. War gods weren't even supposed to feel things like that. \"I mean...\" \"I know what you mean, bro,\" Deimos said, smiling slightly at his twin. They looked so much alike, Eris thought. It was beyond strange for her to see them now, as grown men, and to find out they had actually missed her. \"You, me, kebabs, hummus, my place,\" Deimos said, pointing at Eris, then two thumbs at himself. Phobos just sat and watched, amused, while Eris squirmed, trying to figure a way out of this. She was millennia older, and his commanding officer. Turning down a date, which was a human concept to begin with, should have been easy. But in a way, he was a refreshing contrast to Ares, who occupied her mind most days. Time had slowed to a crawl waiting for him to come back to her. His son was easy, and so very young. He was still aging at the rate of a human. She hoped he didn't think like one, or they'd be in trouble come the war in Macedon. \"As if I would lower myself,\" Eris spat. \"I hear you lower yourself just fine,\" Deimos replied cheekily. \"Excuse me?\" \"You're in trouble now, brother,\" Phobos commented. \"Have you actually seen Eris when she's angry?\" \"You wouldn't like it,\" Eris growled. Deimos backed up, holding his hands up. Had she gotten taller? Phobos, still sitting, could sense Deimos' growing fear, and had his own aversive reaction to the goddess. She didn't make a single sound, but he could still feel it in his teeth, a chill down his spine, as if she were scraping metal across stone. So that's why his brother called her Discord. \"So, Terror, what'll it be? Buried alive, or burnt to a crisp?\" \"Just apologize to the lady,\" Phobos prodded. \"Sorry, Discord,\" stammered a contrite Deimos. \"Won't happen again.\" Her form seemed to diminish, once again a head shorter. The irritating frequency went away, and Phobos mentally filed the incident for later. Don't insult Eris' personal life. But that didn't mean she wasn't still fair game for a scare. Phobos stood up and called to his twin, \"Come on, let's get out of here.\" Deimos still stood close to Eris. Even when she was threatening violence, he liked being around her. Exasperated, she began a hand wave that would teleport her, but while Phobos' attention was elsewhere, Deimos stopped her hand, gripping her wrist. \"I really am sorry,\" he said, low enough that Phobos wouldn't hear. Eris held her glare, but was hyperaware of his palm, his sweat, the heat his skin. It had been too long since anyone had touched her. He let go, and she continued her motion, vanishing silently, leaving a faint red mist behind. \"What in Tartarus was that about?\" Phobos asked him, having noticed the unusual intimacy. Deimos shrugged, feigning ignorance. Despite the casual way he conducted his personal life, the young fear god didn't hold back at all on the battlefield. There he became a monstrous, ghostly nightmare. Which fit perfectly, because when Eris emerged, she drove a chariot of bone, a skeletal horse before her, shrieking a piercing, discordant pair of notes. They were intangible, at the periphery. Her horse could pass through flesh, but when it came out the other side, that mortal wasn't left the same, shredded psychically. The two of them tried to keep some control, to make sure their side stayed sane, directing their mortal chess pieces' hatred at the innocent enemy. Combatants in a mere land feud didn't deserve this kind of horror, but the two of them were shadow creatures. It was what they were made for. Eris wasn't sure how much time had passed, but as soon as there was a lull, she stopped shouting, stopped moving, and stood still. Deimos teleported beside her. They were covered in blood and gore, and there were still some people hanging on, just barely, by their feet. The fear god relaxed, his form shrinking, his eyes' glow dimming, and put a hand on her shoulder. \"Terror,\" she said, feeling the warmth there. She was tiny and pale again, breathing heavy under her armor, holding her sword and watching the sun set in the distance over the carnage. War gods weren't supposed to feel, but there were a few things they did. Ares and Aphrodite's sons were testament to that. Eris reached up and took Deimos' hand. She could feel him standing behind her, only just. She leaned back, so he wrapped his arms around her. Turning around, Eris pulled him close, feeling the radiating heat of his body against hers. She still clutched her sword's handle, but wished she had her red dress on. Leaning down, he kissed her, hard. Hastily, he started to unfasten her armor, so she helped him, dropping the metal breastplate to the ground. But when his rough hands tore at her tunic with a terrifying intensity, pulling it up, Eris panicked. She pushed him back with all her strength and pointed her sword at him. Breathing hard, he looked wolfish. Hungry. Eris shook her head, blinking her eyes. She rubbed them with her free hand and looked at him again. The fear started to dissipate, and he didn't look scary anymore. Merely desperate, like a human. But Eris was a goddess, and stronger than him - physically and magically - and for a moment she had felt as helpless as a mortal girl. It was a shock to her system, fearing she was in any danger. \"How did you do that?\" she asked, impressed. Confused, he panted, \"Do what?\" Unable to explain, she kissed him, this time, with less ferocity, between them a gentle, building arousal. What would Phobos say? He would walk by and without even trying, fill Eris with the fear she was doing something they would regret for millennia. \"We make quite the team, don't we?\" Deimos said, running his hands over her exposed skin, over her armor, brushing the hair out of her eyes. \"That remains to be seen,\" she replied, kissing his neck. They lazily kissed on the corpses of the dead, not for the last time. The memory goddess would be right, they were heartless murderers, although someone quickly glancing would see the tenderness between them, see something beginning. A shred of sick, twisted love.",

      "\"I'm flattered, Ares, but you don't seriously expect me to babysit your brats?\"",
      "\"Excuse me, we're standing right here,\" Deimos groused.",
      "Ares stood up.",
      "With eyes narrowed, he approached Eris, who was over a head shorter.",
      "He tilted her chin up, her lips sealed in a pout.",
      "He leaned close to whisper in her ear.",
      "\"You will obey me.\"",
      "Louder, for his sons' benefit, he added, \"I will give you Deimos to command as you will.\"",
      "Before she could protest, he added, \"He will make an excellent lieutenant, Eris.",
      "As will Phobos, which is why he will be with me.\"",
      "\"Him?",
      "You want to pair me with him?\"",
      "\"I, for one, am in favor of this decision, Father,\" Deimos said.",
      "\"Phobos, I feel you will make a much better lieutenant,\" Eris said.",
      "\"For my purposes,\" she hastily added, noticing Ares' increasing agitation.",
      "\"I have commanded you and still you defy me?",
      "I am your superior, Eris, not merely your brother.",
      "I am War!\"",
      "he bellowed.",
      "\"Actually, Athena might have something to say about that,\" Deimos added without thinking.",
      "Before Ares could respond to Deimos' flippant comment, Phobos finally spoke, \"Father, I understand our aunt's frustration.",
      "She and my brother have never gotten along very well.",
      "Perhaps it would also be wise to keep Deimos close by you so you may better instruct him.\"",
      "He winked at Eris.",
      "This one was a keeper, no question.",
      "Deimos snapped, \"And why wouldn't you need 'better instruction?'\" \"Frankly, I'm not as hotheaded as you are,\" his brother replied.",
      "\"What's done is done, Phobos is with me.",
      "I need his subtlety,\" Ares said.",
      "At Deimos' hurt look, he added, \"And Eris needs your skills with panic.",
      "Hers is the second phase of my plan - shock and awe.",
      "You provide the shock, she provides the awe.",
      "Got it?",
      "Good.",
      "Now get out of my sight, all three of you.\"",
      "Outside the temple, Deimos sidled up to Eris.",
      "\"So, Discord, why are you so afraid to be close to me, anyway?\" Unhesitant, she replied, \"Because you're a pain in the ass.\"",
      "\"Well, I could be,\" he said, leering.",
      "\"You're disgusting, you know that?\"",
      "\"What in Zeus' name is your problem, woman?\"",
      "\"You're my problem, but not for long.",
      "You're my subordinate, so I order you to leave me alone until the day of the battle.\"",
      "\"We have to plan.",
      "And that's gonna require quite a bit of time.",
      "Long hours, just the two of us.",
      "We could get take-out.",
      "I think there's a kebab place around here.\"",
      "Phobos, sitting against the temple wall some yards away, stifled a laugh, bringing him to the others' attention.",
      "The silent fear god had a sense of humor, at least, probably from Aphrodite's side.",
      "No doubt the same reason Deimos was so Nyx-damned annoying, just like his mother.",
      "\"What's so funny?\"",
      "Eris asked, tapping her foot.",
      "\"You guys make life so much less lonely,\" Phobos said, chuckling, before realizing his mistake.",
      "His face fell, and he tried to put his stone-cold mask of a face back on, getting a puzzled mix of sympathy and pity from the others.",
      "War gods didn't confess feelings like that.",
      "War gods weren't even supposed to feel things like that.",
      "\"I mean...\" \"I know what you mean, bro,\" Deimos said, smiling slightly at his twin.",
      "They looked so much alike, Eris thought.",
      "It was beyond strange for her to see them now, as grown men, and to find out they had actually missed her.",
      "\"You, me, kebabs, hummus, my place,\" Deimos said, pointing at Eris, then two thumbs at himself.",
      "Phobos just sat and watched, amused, while Eris squirmed, trying to figure a way out of this.",
      "She was millennia older, and his commanding officer.",
      "Turning down a date, which was a human concept to begin with, should have been easy.",
      "But in a way, he was a refreshing contrast to Ares, who occupied her mind most days.",
      "Time had slowed to a crawl waiting for him to come back to her.",
      "His son was easy, and so very young.",
      "He was still aging at the rate of a human.",
      "She hoped he didn't think like one, or they'd be in trouble come the war in Macedon.",
      "\"As if I would lower myself,\" Eris spat.",
      "\"I hear you lower yourself just fine,\" Deimos replied cheekily.",
      "\"Excuse me?\"",
      "\"You're in trouble now, brother,\" Phobos commented.",
      "\"Have you actually seen Eris when she's angry?\"",
      "\"You wouldn't like it,\" Eris growled.",
      "Deimos backed up, holding his hands up.",
      "Had she gotten taller?",
      "Phobos, still sitting, could sense Deimos' growing fear, and had his own aversive reaction to the goddess.",
      "She didn't make a single sound, but he could still feel it in his teeth, a chill down his spine, as if she were scraping metal across stone.",
      "So that's why his brother called her Discord.",
      "\"So, Terror, what'll it be?",
      "Buried alive, or burnt to a crisp?\"",
      "\"Just apologize to the lady,\" Phobos prodded.",
      "\"Sorry, Discord,\" stammered a contrite Deimos.",
      "\"Won't happen again.\"",
      "Her form seemed to diminish, once again a head shorter.",
      "The irritating frequency went away, and Phobos mentally filed the incident for later.",
      "Don't insult Eris' personal life.",
      "But that didn't mean she wasn't still fair game for a scare.",
      "Phobos stood up and called to his twin, \"Come on, let's get out of here.\"",
      "Deimos still stood close to Eris.",
      "Even when she was threatening violence, he liked being around her.",
      "Exasperated, she began a hand wave that would teleport her, but while Phobos' attention was elsewhere, Deimos stopped her hand, gripping her wrist.",
      "\"I really am sorry,\" he said, low enough that Phobos wouldn't hear.",
      "Eris held her glare, but was hyperaware of his palm, his sweat, the heat his skin.",
      "It had been too long since anyone had touched her.",
      "He let go, and she continued her motion, vanishing silently, leaving a faint red mist behind.",
      "\"What in Tartarus was that about?\"",
      "Phobos asked him, having noticed the unusual intimacy.",
      "Deimos shrugged, feigning ignorance.",
      "Despite the casual way he conducted his personal life, the young fear god didn't hold back at all on the battlefield.",
      "There he became a monstrous, ghostly nightmare.",
      "Which fit perfectly, because when Eris emerged, she drove a chariot of bone, a skeletal horse before her, shrieking a piercing, discordant pair of notes.",
      "They were intangible, at the periphery.",
      "Her horse could pass through flesh, but when it came out the other side, that mortal wasn't left the same, shredded psychically.",
      "The two of them tried to keep some control, to make sure their side stayed sane, directing their mortal chess pieces' hatred at the innocent enemy.",
      "Combatants in a mere land feud didn't deserve this kind of horror, but the two of them were shadow creatures.",
      "It was what they were made for.",
      "Eris wasn't sure how much time had passed, but as soon as there was a lull, she stopped shouting, stopped moving, and stood still.",
      "Deimos teleported beside her.",
      "They were covered in blood and gore, and there were still some people hanging on, just barely, by their feet.",
      "The fear god relaxed, his form shrinking, his eyes' glow dimming, and put a hand on her shoulder.",
      "\"Terror,\" she said, feeling the warmth there.",
      "She was tiny and pale again, breathing heavy under her armor, holding her sword and watching the sun set in the distance over the carnage.",
      "War gods weren't supposed to feel, but there were a few things they did.",
      "Ares and Aphrodite's sons were testament to that.",
      "Eris reached up and took Deimos' hand.",
      "She could feel him standing behind her, only just.",
      "She leaned back, so he wrapped his arms around her.",
      "Turning around, Eris pulled him close, feeling the radiating heat of his body against hers.",
      "She still clutched her sword's handle, but wished she had her red dress on.",
      "Leaning down, he kissed her, hard.",
      "Hastily, he started to unfasten her armor, so she helped him, dropping the metal breastplate to the ground.",
      "But when his rough hands tore at her tunic with a terrifying intensity, pulling it up, Eris panicked.",
      "She pushed him back with all her strength and pointed her sword at him.",
      "Breathing hard, he looked wolfish.",
      "Hungry.",
      "Eris shook her head, blinking her eyes.",
      "She rubbed them with her free hand and looked at him again.",
      "The fear started to dissipate, and he didn't look scary anymore.",
      "Merely desperate, like a human.",
      "But Eris was a goddess, and stronger than him - physically and magically - and for a moment she had felt as helpless as a mortal girl.",
      "It was a shock to her system, fearing she was in any danger.",
      "\"How did you do that?\" she asked, impressed.",
      "Confused, he panted, \"Do what?\" Unable to explain, she kissed him, this time, with less ferocity, between them a gentle, building arousal.",
      "What would Phobos say?",
      "He would walk by and without even trying, fill Eris with the fear she was doing something they would regret for millennia.",
      "\"We make quite the team, don't we?\" Deimos said, running his hands over her exposed skin, over her armor, brushing the hair out of her eyes.",
      "\"That remains to be seen,\" she replied, kissing his neck.",
      "They lazily kissed on the corpses of the dead, not for the last time.",
      "The memory goddess would be right, they were heartless murderers, although someone quickly glancing would see the tenderness between them, see something beginning.",
      "A shred of sick, twisted love."

    "text": "A Thousand Kisses by Anne-Li It had begun so well - what had happened? What had he done wrong? One thing Klaus prided himself on was his ability to look level-headedly at every situation. His sharp mind and eyes removed all extraneous details to get to the bottom of each problem. He was aware that some people called him blunt because of this - and perhaps rightly so. What most of them thought of him was yet another thing that had no bearing on the obstacles he faced. However, he did keep a healthy view of people's opinion of him. He never deluded himself into thinking that they might find him likeable or even lovable. When some people still insisted on liking - or even loving - him, he considered this suspicious. What were they after? What did they want? What was the catch? The Earl of Red Gloria had been forced to spend five whole years insinuating himself far enough into Klaus's paranoid heart to allow Klaus to believe that the man just might love him for his own sake. That he wasn't after some knowledge Klaus possessed, some material object he owned or even some ability of his. Five years of flirting, following around and relentlessly pursuing, until Klaus one day, more or less out of the blue, realised that he had begun to trust the Brit with that most fragile part of himself - his heart. To convince himself that a relationship between himself and the other wasn't pure madness had taken close to a sixth year. Before leaving the office that Friday night, the last thing he did was to call North Downs. When he finally had Dorian on the line he said only \"I'm ready. If you mean what you say, I'm at my apartment.\" He hadn't expected the Earl until the following day, but just as he was brushing his teeth before going to bed someone knocked frantically on his door and there Dorian stood, looking almost on the verge of panicking. They had stayed in the apartment the entire weekend. Klaus had never felt such peace and acceptance as he found in Dorian's arms, when their sated bodies nestled together. Sex or not, just to be allowed to touch felt like a blessing from the God he hadn't believed in since childhood. They had sex though - brilliant, explosive, mind-numbing sex that he had previously suspected were just the feverish delusions of horny writers of romance novels or porn magazines. Together they did basically everything two healthy males could indulge in, without resorting to too many props or perversions. At first Dorian allowed Klaus to top exclusively. Then he slowly paved the way for a reversal by acquainting Klaus's rear with clever fingers during amazing blow jobs, followed by tantalizing tastes of what he referred to as \"the Turkish treat\" - rimming. Finally, one hazy evening when they had just returned from a successful mission, both of them eager and in good moods, the Brit had - with infinite care and the gentlest of lovemaking - taken Klaus's last virginity. Klaus still recalled that night in perfect detail - every loving touch and awkward pause, the strangeness of being filled and worshipped from within, of being stroked and at the same time giving Dorian such obvious pleasure. The master art thief had treated him as if he was the most precious thing on Earth. Not something a man should remember with fondness, he would tell himself: he ought to have been embarrassed by his own skittishness - yet the Earl had never given any hint that he had behaved in an unmanly fashion. There was no doubt in Klaus's heart whatsoever that Dorian had adored him that night - that he had even loved him. So... What had gone wrong? Give me a thousand kisses... I love you! Love you, love you, love you, love you! I want to live forever with you! Your very presence makes me forget everything else. Nothing else matters. Even that cruel \"joke\" he played on me so long ago is a blessing now, in a way - without it I never would have been with you like this. I love you, Klaus Heinz von dem Eberbach, and I will love you until the end of time. Klaus even suspected that he knew the moment when things changed. Before then everything had certainly been fine. Better than fine - everything had been perfect. He had been happy. A reason to worry in itself, perhaps, but he had been singularly content with his life. Oh, there had still been annoyances - he still hadn't been promoted, he still had to deal with the Alphabet on a daily basis, his father was still after him to marry and so on. But he had had Dorian to make up for things. His bright, golden, oh so generous lover, who would tease away all his worries and make him smile. Who seemed to enjoy his very presence as a gift from some higher power. Who would cover him in kisses, smother him with caresses and leave him breathless with loving. They weren't together around the clock, of course - that would have been both too much and too impractical. Any time Klaus was off for longer than a day, though, Dorian would show up - regardless of whether Klaus had informed him of this fact or not. As before he often invited himself along on missions. The Alphabet found out about their relationship rather early on, when A, B and Z had happened to rush in on the two of them in a... very compromising position. They had been staying at a safe house in DeLynn and the three agents had been eager to notify Klaus of a sighted suspect. Since then knocking on Klaus's door before going in was no longer just obligatory - it was done very loudly and insistently until Klaus answered in no uncertain words that they could enter - and \"Yes! Yes! Oh yes!\" was not an acceptable answer... Klaus was only glad that the trio hadn't arrived five minutes earlier, when he had been face down on the bed with Dorian vigorously pounding into him. As it was Dorian had just finished and was sucking him off when the door was flung open... Ah yes, those had been the good days.. When Dorian wasn't with him in Bonn or at the Schloss, he called at least once a week. Often on returning home Klaus would find a post card from where Dorian's own little missions took him - often a postcard of some painting or statue that shortly afterwards happened to go missing... They had arguments over Dorian's occupation - which often turned into arguments over Klaus's own occupation - which often turned into rough, angry sex followed by sweet, loving make-up sex, during which Dorian spent hours worshipping every part of Klaus's body - or long, luxurious marathon sessions of kisses... The kisses. Yes. They marked what Klaus privately thought of as the beginning of the end... Klaus had visited Dorian at North Downs. They had been together for a year and a half and while that wasn't any kind of official anniversary, Dorian had sounded a bit tired when they spoke over the phone. Klaus had, in a rather uncharacteristically hasty decision, said that he would come to visit. The joy in Dorian's voice - and later in his eyes at seeing Klaus - had been worth the trip and more besides. He had arrived at two o'clock sharp and they had gone for a walk in the forest surrounding the castle. Sex outdoors was still very novel and not something during which Klaus thought he would ever really relax. He did have to admit that it had its charms to feel the warm sun on his body as they lay together beneath the ancient oaks of Dorian's homestead. They talked about going out for dinner. Nowhere fancy, just to a small restaurant in the nearby village, where people knew Dorian and wouldn't bat an eye at seeing him escorted by a man. Klaus, wearing only his trousers, lay with his upper body against a tree. The Earl himself at first nestled along Klaus's side, with his head on Klaus's chest. Then he moved to straddle Klaus's upper thighs, caressing his torso with strong hands. His eyes - blue like the bluebells that grew in abundance around the castle - met Klaus's filled with smouldering desire as Dorian began to recite his favourite poem. \"Give me a thousand kisses...\" he said, then broke contact between their eyes to kiss Klaus's right nipple. For a long while he anointed the tiny bud with his tongue, teasing it expertly. Then he pulled away. \"Then a hundred...\" he said, apparently now more to Klaus's nipples than to Klaus himself, for he bent to the other side to pay the same homage there. Klaus felt his cock begin to stir. As Dorian sat back he scooted a little closer and lifted his gaze. \"Then give me another thousand kisses...\" This time, when he bent his neck, their mouths met. First just teasingly, lips to lips, then with more force - tongues greeting and playing, testing one another. Dorian tasted like nothing Klaus could describe. No women he had kissed had tasted even remotely like sunlight and heaven and justice and truth - or had by just bringing their lips together made Klaus forget the rest of the world... It felt as if they kissed forever, mixing their very beings. With a beatific smile Dorian withdrew, his eyes heavy-lidded. His clever fingers found Klaus's nipples and he shifted their bodies so their groins met. Klaus willingly cooperated, thrusting up slowly. \"... and yet another hundred,\" Dorian continued. He began to bend down again, apparently intending to indulge in on another such amazing kiss. And that's when Klaus blew it. Even half a year later he still didn't know how he blew it, but that was when things changed. It had felt like such a harmless thing to say! He still saw no harm in it! For fuck's sake, it had felt like an almost romantic, mushy, stupid thing to say! He had said it because he had wanted to please his lover, to prove he was actually paying attention! \"You must have kissed me a thousand and a hundred times already,\" he said. Dorian started to smile, but then the smile froze. His big, blue eyes widened, before blinking. Once. Twice. Trice. Then he pulled back, sharply. \"No I haven't!\" he said - urgently, as if such a thing actually mattered - as if either of them could have kept count after so many months. Klaus, surprised by the vehement tone of Dorian's voice, hadn't known how to reply, so he had shrugged. Again - it wasn't as if it actually mattered! However, apparently the stupid thing had mattered, if only to Dorian. He had risen from their green bed. \"No I haven't!\" he had repeated, sounding... almost scared. \"I haven't!\" He shook his head, glorious locks like a whirl of gold in the sunlight. \"I can't have!\" Then he turned around and ran for his castle. Then a hundred. No! No! No! Oh my, what have I done? What have I been doing? I forgot! The very thing my life here depends on - and I forgot! Now I've got to stop! Right away! I must stop! But how can I? I love you so, my dearest German Rose, my one and only! Oh, cruel fate... I can't bear leaving you! I love you... I've got to stop... Klaus followed Dorian, of course, seriously worried over what had happened. He caught up with him before they reached the ancestral home of the Red-Glorias. By then Dorian had calmed down a bit. He hugged Klaus hard, though, almost clinging to him. With his face pressed against Klaus's neck he muttered something about being momentarily confused, something about a mission detail he had suddenly come to think of. Then he apologized for leaving Klaus \"high and dry\" as he put it. By way of further apology he showed Klaus an alternate use of the giant tub in Dorian's bathroom, one which involved oil-slick bodies and lots of bubbles. Klaus let himself be seduced into forgetting the problem. There had, however, been no further kisses. That was the gist of the matter. No further kisses. Oh, it had taken Klaus a while to catch on. Dorian still visited often enough. He called. Postcards arrived. They still made passionate love often enough - or had rough, sweaty sex. Dorian would suckle his nipples and his cock - would use his clever, lovely tongue both here and there to arouse and pleasure him. He would give him that Turkish treat until Klaus would come from that maddening touch alone. But he would not kiss Klaus's mouth. Once in a great while, maybe, a long, tender kiss was bestowed - but no more marathon sessions, no feather light kisses good morning, no indulging kisses good night, no stolen pecks when no Alphabet (or at least not too many of them) could see... Klaus missed those kisses, damn it! But quite apart from that, the marked change made him wonder. What he said had clearly upset Dorian. That \"explanation\" given was obviously so much horse piss. Klaus had commented on the number of kisses between the two of them - had this frightened the free-spirited Dorian; made him feel bound somehow? Had it shaken him awake from their honeymoon dream? Had it made him see reason? Had they kissed so often that Dorian no longer saw a point in continuing? And - of course - did that mean that soon the rest of their lovemaking and intimacies would bore him too? Was the moment in Dorian's life that was Klaus, bit by bit, coming to an end? Or maybe the story hadn't been horse piss after all? Sometimes people get confused. Perhaps Dorian had been ill that day and really had mixed things up in his mind. That didn't sound plausible, but Klaus did consider the possibility, hoping to find another explanation than that his touch bored the man he loved. Still - that left the mystery of the missing kisses. Only in that case the amount of them might not be the problem, but rather the... quality. Klaus hadn't been totally inexperienced when he finally allowed the Earl to bed him. He had been with some women. Not a herd of them, but the ones he had been with seemed pleased enough with how he treated them. They had mostly been one-night stands, picked up at bars for the sole purpose of sex. Love hadn't had a place in his life, until Love had almost literally barrelled into him, held him down and tied him up. The women, though - he had kissed most of them and there had been no voiced complaints. Of course, in such situations one doesn't comment much on the minor details - there was no need, since no repeat performance was expected. He had assumed he had done well enough. Perhaps he had been mistaken. He honestly didn't think it was an experience thing, though. Dorian knew what he had gotten into when they became lovers. He had known Klaus wasn't as sophisticated and experienced as he was himself. In fact he had seemed to delight in introducing Klaus to all possible sorts of pleasures. They had spent considerable time trying out different kisses and beyond a few minor suggestions, the kisses in themselves, as Klaus gave them, seemed to have met with enthusiastic approval. Had he found Klaus's technique less than satisfactory, Dorian would have gently pushed him in the correct direction. After pondering the matter thoroughly, Klaus drew the conclusion the problem might be simply that Dorian found the taste of his mouth repellent. The rest of him was aesthetically pleasing enough, so Dorian still indulged in his body, but no longer in his mouth - at least not tastewise, as he always seemed greatly pleased when Klaus used his mouth for other purposes than kissing. Possibly some British sense of the appropriate kept the nobleman from voicing his dissatisfaction out loud. Totally ridiculous, but the answer matched up to the facts of the situation. Klaus decided that while he found it incredibly stupid, he would field test his hypothesis. He greatly disliked changing for anyone - but for Dorian he would be willing, if only in a minor detail. So he tried. God help him, he tried. Never let it be said that Iron Klaus would surrender without a fight. Dorian meant a lot to him and he would not let the man slip away due to Klaus's lacks. Not if the problem could be remedied. Klaus quit smoking. He knew Dorian to be courting justice somewhere across the Atlantic, not expected back for a fortnight. So he requested a long weekend off, Friday to Monday, and went cold turkey. It hadn't been easy. Had he had some friend he had trusted enough, he would have just chained himself in the bedroom, asked to have food delivered and the key returned come Monday night. As it was he forced himself not to slip into the tobacco store for more cigarettes on his unusually long morning runs. He stayed in Bonn, rather than to have the butler try to \"assist\" him. The first days were hellish, but he accomplished his mission - as always. Come Monday afternoon, he felt more tired than he usually would have been after four days off, but the need for nicotine merely simmered deep in his mind, rather than clawed at his sanity every waking moment. Tuesday morning he went to work as usual. Okay, so maybe he didn't have to make B cry by growling at him for walking too loudly. Perhaps he had been just a tiny bit restless. And maybe he had badgered the Chief just a little too forcefully about a new mission. But the day passed and he rewarded himself with a good meal that night. Again, fried potatoes did make at least some sort of substitute for cigarettes. After that things sailed along smoothly, even with four Alphabets - C, R, S and W - calling in sick. All with proper doctor's certificates. He might have been ever so slightly concerned, had he not recognised Dr. Wennham as a man they had worked with in the past. A slacker himself, the man had left the third day of the mission crying, complaining to all and sundry that Klaus demanded the impossible. Of course he did! That was the only way he would get the bare minimum done! Never mind. He would take the AWOL 'bets to task on their return. At the moment he had a more important fish to fry. Something else he thought might sour his mouth was coffee. That, however, was a more temporary effect, so he wouldn't have to give it up totally - which was for the better. He didn't think the Alphabet would survive him quitting both of his habits simultaneously. Besides, he wasn't sure if he actually was willing to give up coffee... Cigarettes was one thing - he had read the reports of how unhealthy they were and had considered quitting for a long while. Coffee was another matter entirely. Maybe switch to a different brand or whatever, but if Dorian really loved him he shouldn't force him to. As an experiment, however, instead of a cup as soon as he got out of bed that Saturday, he drank a good-sized glass of water and downed a caffeine tablet, courtesy of the NATO doctor. That didn't quite equal coffee, he knew that, but the combination should have a similar effect. He felt jittery and alert, but not in the good way coffee made him feel, but rather in a forced way he disliked. It was, however, for a good cause. The day of Dorian's return from overseas had come. Finally the door bell rang. Klaus rose and started towards the door. A glance at the wall clock confirmed that Dorian had made good time from the airport - a quarter to 12. Unless the flight was delayed he usually arrived between 12 and half past. Perhaps the plane landed early. If it was Dorian at all and not some salesman or some guy sent to read his electric meter. Klaus didn't hurry towards the door. He never did. Sometimes he would get there in time, at other - Click. --times Dorian would beat him. The door opened. Even if Klaus had expected it, he still tensed, waiting to ascertain that whoever had just broken into his home really was a welcome intruder. He liked his and Dorian's little game, but knew all too well that he couldn't fully relax about security breaches. However, this particular intruder really was welcome. Feasting his eyes on Dorian's happy smile Klaus walked the last meters and promptly hoisted the man off the ground. He enjoyed the feel of his lover's solid body in his arms, pressing his nose against his shoulder, with the golden hair in his eyes... Dorian chuckled, caressed his shoulders possessively and rubbed his smooth-shaven cheek eagerly against Klaus's, like a cat marking its owner's hand. He even dropped a playful kiss on Klaus's ear. \"Good morning, my dearest darling! Have the 'bets behaved while I was away?\" Klaus snorted, then let the man down to let him remove his outdoor clothes. \"Some are slacking, as they always are,\" he said. Then he remembered something that Dorian possibly might want to know. \"Mrs. A's ill. A mentioned--\" Before he had time to continue, Dorian broke in, nodding, \"Yes, isn't it amazing? G gave me a call.\" Klaus frowned. Why would Dorian think that amazing? Had he misunderstood or was it possibly some English thing he didn't know about? \"--that it'd take a while before she'll get better.\" \"Another month or so, yes. I have this little necklace laying around, plaited white, red and yellow gold, with stones just the colour of her eyes. I'm sure she'll like it.\" Klaus knew Dorian had befriended the woman at the NATO Christmas gathering and had mentioned her illness in case Dorian wanted to send her a \"get well\"-card or whatever. Perhaps they were better friends than he had thought, if Dorian sent her jewellery for being sick? In the end he shrugged it off as Dorian being opulently generous again - he was that, at times, when James didn't keep him in line. \"Your pack, then?\" he asked. Since Dorian had divested himself of his spring jacket he stepped closer and hugged him again. On breathing in he all but tasted the unique smell of warm male, expensive eau de cologne, lavender and Dorian. The other hugged him back in turn, pressing them tightly together. \"Oh, the boys are just fine.\" Social niceties dealt with. There. This would normally be when Klaus offered coffee - and Dorian would make himself a \"cuppa\". Tea which mysteriously had appeared, together with a white and green china set, in Klaus's cupboard one morning when he was sure Dorian had visited Japan. Since he didn't want to drink coffee before testing his hypothesis he knew this was his time to act. He shifted stance, wrapping his arms loosely over Dorian's, to hold him in place and get his hands into that thick mop of lovely, lovely curls. Klaus liked Dorian's hair. He wouldn't say so to anyone but Dorian: wouldn't even mention it to the man himself in as many words, but in rare moments of idle contemplation, Klaus had found himself comparing the locks to the shimmer of gold, almost alive in its vibrant glory. Soft like angel wings, when Dorian let it slip over Klaus's skin -yet with wispy kind of solidity when Klaus used a handful to caress himself with while Dorian's mouth was otherwise occupied, usually with torturing Klaus's balls. Dorian looked up at him. He was only slightly shorter than Klaus, negligible in every way, but he often hammed it up with fluttering eyelashes and seductive glances. As he lowered his lips Klaus felt a minute tension in the body he held, then the succulent mouth parted to invite him in. Yes! Not aware how of much he had expected an instant rejection, Klaus pressed further, initiating a long, sweet kiss. Dorian tasted like pure heaven - if possible even better than Klaus remembered. Perhaps there was something to that whole cigarettes affecting taste thing. Their lips worked against one another - now Dorian giving, now Klaus; tongues sometimes barely touching, sometimes gliding sweetly against one another. Dorian's hands caressed in wide strokes over his back and Klaus felt intoxicated, lost - almost drunk. The Brit's hand went farther down, taking a decidedly possessive hold of his buttocks, squeezing them firmly just the way Klaus liked, and then he used them to bring their groins together. So many sensations... Klaus was half-hard already, eager to follow Dorian's lead on their next move, though unwilling to surrender the mouth that tasted so good and gave his own such pleasure. Dorian appeared to be in no hurry either, clinging to the kiss as if it was the last of its kind, exploring Klaus's mouth as though a map later would be of vital importance. He hummed deep in his throat: a low, murmuring sound that Klaus's interpreted as pure contentedness. They stood so, in the hallway, kissing one another, until Klaus felt a hint dizzy from having breathed recycled air for too long. Perhaps it was partly the caffeine tablet too - or the relief he felt, that his ploy apparently had worked. He started to push Dorian towards the bedroom. Now he wanted to feel skin against skin and get his mouth on Dorian's dick for a while. Then he wanted some more kisses. \"You tasted very good today, my own,\" Dorian told him, one hand still on Klaus's arse while the other was working on the buttons of his billowing, bright green blouse. \"I quit smoking,\" he explained, pleased with the evidence that Dorian really had felt a difference. Dorian's entire face lit up in a smile. \"You did?! Oh, darling! I'm so glad for you!\" He hugged him enthusiastically, then took his hand and tugged him the rest of the way to the bed. Klaus eagerly followed. Since Dorian had been gone for a while they didn't bother with much in the way of foreplay - both were already hard and raring to go. Time for slow touches later, when the edge had been taken off. So they engaged in a sixty-nine, with Klaus on his back and Dorian arched above him. To his pleasure Klaus found that the flesh now fed to him also tasted richer than before - as did, at some point later, Dorian's cum. Afterwards Dorian twisted around to lie with his head on Klaus's shoulder. Klaus caressed the silken skin over his belly, enjoying the feel of sex-warm muscles. Then he bent down to catch his lover's lips. That was when Dorian twisted away, as if afraid that Klaus's mouth would burn him... He did try to make the move look natural, by bending to nuzzle at Klaus's nearest nipple, but he didn't quite succeed. Suddenly Klaus felt very, very cold... Dorian didn't kiss him again that night. Then give me another thousand kisses. I'm so sorry, my love, my own - I'm so, so sorry! You try so hard and I just can't! Oh, how will you ever forgive me? Can you ever? This is torture. Torture! A month later, Klaus died. He had gone undercover to spy on a meeting between a Helsinki mob boss and a Russian arms dealer. Rumour had it that the latter was actually in league with the KGB, who was trying to trade information about a supposedly top secret Finnish army base. The base, Klaus knew, didn't exist, but when NATO got the tip - ironically enough from the mob boss himself, a distant cousin to Volovolonte as well as most faithful to the Finnish flag - they had wanted to investigate the sudden interest. Double the irony - while it was the mob boss who had invited NATO's presence, the operation had been kept secret from his men, to avoid tale-telling. Klaus had been introduced as one of Volovolonte's men, cooling his heels in the land of the thousand lakes from having been a bit too eager in collecting protection money from the hookers of Rome. However, one of Don Makkonen's men had actually visited Rome while Klaus had barged his way to Volovolonte that time he pursued Dorian to retrieve the Lubjanka report. The man recognized Klaus - and shot him. The bullet hit Klaus in the side. He wrestled the would-be-assassin to the ground - with a little help from Don Makkonen - then collapsed even as the ambulance rolled to a stop. Enveloped in a fog of sounds and colours he was vaguely aware of how they loaded him onto a gurney as the hard, rolling Finnish words was spoken loudly around him. His entire world billowed, like a wave, ending in black lightning. That was when he died. In the 30 seconds before they had his heart pumping again, hesitatant at first but then with the same persistent doggedness as always, he saw a vision he would never forget. He saw Dorian. Not Dorian as when they first met, an unstoppable force of nature. Not Dorian from six days previous, strolling towards his car with one, last, jaunty wave goodbye. Not Dorian as he looked the moment orgasm hit him - how his eyes widened and pupils dilated; how his mouth opened wider and wider as if in both shock and awe; how even his very hair seemed to sparkle with electricity... No, he saw Dorian in the House Gloria library, wearing his dark red velvet smoking gown. The man stood by the old polar bear rug on which they had made love more than once. His right hand reached for volume VI of an art encyclopaedia. Klaus recognized the pale blue, silver-ornamented spine. He had seen volumes often enough on the bedroom night table. In his left hand he carried a green crystal glass with some golden beverage - perhaps the expensive brandy which he on occasion favoured. Klaus saw everything clearly, as if he stood just behind Dorian - as if he could touch him by just reaching out. As if it was any of those many evenings they had spent there, together, before getting ready to retire to the bedroom. Yet what he saw was not a memory. Klaus knew what had happened. He was aware that he had been shot. In a purely instinctive way he had no doubt of his own death. He even suspected his mind had somehow produced the image before him as a last ditch effort to send him off with something nice to keep him company. He had time to wonder if there might be some truth to those old wives' tales about the spirit leaving the body at the moment of death to visit a dear one before going wherever souls go in the end. Not that he expected a white-bearded Gootvater to bid him welcome to Heaven - or a cloven-hoofed Versucher to cautiously allow him entrance to the nether plains. There was strangeness in the world, though. For example he had, after their initial meeting, found out more about Caesar Gabriel and his friends, which couldn't be explained rationally. \"Dorian,\" he said, without even meaning to. Dropping book and glass, the man in question whirled. He saw Klaus - clearly saw him, no question about it - and screamed. Then, while the abrupt yell still lingered, the Brit dove towards him, reaching out as if he was going to grab him. For a wild moment Klaus thought it would work - that Dorian really would get hold of him and pull him into the reality of House Gloria. Alas, no. Dorian's fingers went straight through him as through so much air - Klaus didn't even feel them. He heard Dorian's screamed \"no,\" though, - heard the one word so loudly that his skull still rang from the sound, when he woke to life again, in the back of the Finnish ambulance. Then a second hundred. No! No! No! I can't! I can't let you die! I refuse to! But how can I help you? I can't! Not like this! But I can't be with you otherwise! Why must I chose? This is too much to ask! I need you so much... I fear that I must do it, though! I must be strong and when the day come when you really need me, I must be there for you! I can't bear to lose you forever! Sometimes one has to make a sacrifice... Why must it be so hard, though? There's still a little time left - for better and for worse, to enjoy you before this ends. I'll fly free again and so, in the fullness of time, will you. Perhaps in the end, you'll fly back to me. There's still a little time left, though - oh such a short time left... He never asked if Dorian had seen him. If Dorian had, he rather thought that the man would have told him. While he himself might be a sceptic, Dorian was open to possibilities - though by no means a conventional believer. Besides, Klaus wasn't sure how to phrase such a question - \"Were you haunted by my ghost while I was dead?\" He didn't think so... Regardless, Dorian didn't mention anything out of the ordinary. He had to tell Dorian about getting shot - it was a bit hard not to, seeing as the next time they met, in Antwerpen, he still wore bandages, even if the wound didn't hurt much any longer. Dying he didn't mention - he hadn't stayed dead, in the end, so no use prattling on about what could have been. Dorian then mother-henned him, no matter how hard Klaus tried to discourage him - though maybe he didn't try exceptionally hard when mother-henning in bed including making Klaus lie absolutely still while Dorian did all the work - and how hard he worked... Including - and this was a very important include in Klaus's mind - kissing him! Repeatedly! On the mouth! That night in Antwerpen marked a drastic change for the better on the kissing front. Things still weren't as they had been in the initial phase of their relationship, when kisses had fallen like drops of rain, but Dorian no longer avoided mouth-to-mouth contact as if Klaus had oral herpes in its contagious stage. Instead each meeting would include a minimum of two kisses - sometimes three or four, doled out with the greatest devotion. Klaus occasionally wondered about Dorian's strange behaviour, but he no longer doubted his love. Which was good - for Klaus had long since decided that the day Dorian left him would be the day Klaus went to the chief and signed himself up for wet work. He would never kill himself or take unnecessary risks, but everyone in NATO - with high enough clearance - knew that those who worked in that field - assassination - never lived long. Then give me yet another thousand kisses, and yet another hundred. It's almost done. Almost over. Almost time. So help me, I can't wait any longer. I must tell you now. I must explain and hope - beg, hope, plead - that you'll be all right with that. Hope you'll understand. Hope you trust me enough. I love you so much... You're a remarkable man, my own - perhaps you'll understand better than I can dream of. I'm scared, though... Terrified. It's a huge thing I've kept secret from you. I should have told you months ago - years ago. You wouldn't have believed me, though, so how could I? Perhaps you still won't, but I've run out of time. I'm coming now. I'm coming to you, my dear Major von dem Eberbach. I'm coming to you - for the last time. Their relationship was changing again. This time Klaus wasn't sure what the problem was. With just one fall off the wagon he hadn't smoked since quitting. What else could he do? Especially since Dorian wouldn't tell him about his worries. Not that Klaus had asked - he didn't know how to broach the subject. Talking never solved much anyway. He worried, though, about the ferocity Dorian lately showed in their lovemaking. The Earl would pound into him as if fucking was about to go out of fashion and he wanted to get in as much as possible before it was considered gauche. At other times Klaus would wake up in the early morning hours to find the Earl awake, just sitting there, in the dark, studying him. Even when Dorian slept he did so while wrapping as much of himself around as much as Klaus as possible, holding on to him tightly, sometimes almost suffocating him. Klaus began to suspect that something was very wrong. That Dorian might be dying. Some disease. Not the plague. They didn't use protection, something he was sure Dorian would insist on if he had a fatal illness that he could transmit veneraly. Besides, he had had himself tested after the recent shooting, as the Finns had given him a blood infusion. Something else, then, that made Dorian act the way he did. Still, he didn't ask. \"You about to snuff it?\" felt tasteless and sooner or later something would happen. If Dorian really was dying he, Klaus, could do nothing about it - better just enjoy their time together and not make things more difficult for the golden-haired Brit. Besides, maybe he was mistaken. Maybe some other reason existed for Dorian's off-again, on-again mood. So when the day came, as it eventually must, that Dorian broke into his apartment with a very serious expression and a hint of despair in his eyes, Klaus mentally steeled himself for the worst. When he tried to initiate an embrace and Dorian simply held up a hand and said \"No,\" Klaus didn't betray his hurt with even a flinch. So, wet work it would be? If Dorian died life would be pointless, so he might as well do something useful to end it. If leaving instead was on the schedule Klaus would let him go - he certainly would make no kind of scene, not even there, in the privacy of his own home. He had already decided that if Dorian broke up with him he would simply indicate that he himself had also had some news to share - a change of NATO division. Nothing to do with Dorian's news whatsoever. He would then talk to the Chief in the morning. The man had assured Klaus years ago that he would be accepted in that line of work, no questions asked. He didn't want to live again without sunshine. \"Klaus, I... We... I need to tell you something. Something important.\" So he is leaving me. Otherwise he would have kissed me. Not betraying this thought, he nodded. \"In the living room.\" He didn't bother to offer coffee - or tea. He felt too tense to add caffeine to the mixture and if Dorian wanted tea then he bloody well knew where the stuff was kept. So they sat on the high-backed, old-fashioned couch, turned towards one another, and waited. Klaus waited, that was, while Dorian fidgeted. He looked at the small pastel of Schloss Eberbach that Klaus's mother had painted, which hung on the wall over the television. He studied his knees. He glanced at Klaus. He corrected the lay of his bracelets. He wiped non-existent dust off his collar. He tapped his fingernails on his thighs. Klaus felt like shaking him, just to get him to be still. \"Oh, this is awkward,\" Dorian said with a weak chuckle. Klaus didn't comment. Awkward it was, so better just get it over with. Inside he felt leaden and so very, very tired. \"Klaus?\" He looked up and met the blue gaze. Dorian's eyes seemed unusually bright. Not bright like they got when he was about to cry - something Klaus had seen only twice - but in a more vivid way. They were bluer than he remembered them ever being: an intense, all-encompassing blue with a hint of gold-shimmering green and pin-point pupils. This alarmed Klaus faintly, because he didn't see why that should be. Had Dorian taken something? Medications? Drugs? \"I... have a confession to make.\" Wanting it over and done with, Klaus nodded again. \"Out with it.\" Confession? Leaving he could say nothing about, that was the other's call, but... If he has been unfaithful I will kill him. Dorian turned his face sideways. He looked pained. When he turned back again, his eyes gleamed, reminding Klaus of a cat's, shining in the dark. \"I never meant to wait this long before telling you. I kept saying to myself I should tell you, but... it never seemed like the right moment and I just wanted a little more time to... to be with you.\" This puzzled Klaus. \"Before what?\" Was Dorian dying after all, not leaving him for some two-bit male strumpet? Why no kissing, then? He wanted to reach out, but in the end stayed still, rather than to risk exposing his heart. \"I'm getting there. I'm sorry, my dear, but, please, let me finish? I know what I need to say. It's just... difficult.\" He shrugged. Dorian bridged the distance between them with a hand, stroking almost reverently over Klaus's knuckles. Klaus had to make a conscious effort to neither flinch nor pull away. Dorian felt feverishly warm. \"You sick?\" he asked. Dorian smiled bleakly. \"No.\" \"You feel hot.\" The smile wavered - for a brief moment it was Dorian's usual, bright smile, the one that signalled that he was on the verge of saying something outrageous. Then the happy expression dimmed and he shook his head. \"It's not because I'm ill. I... Klaus...\" He looked down again, breaking contact between their eyes and pinching his own shut. Klaus waited. His mind, though, raced, trying to find a reasonably explanation for the odd behaviour. Undercover KGB agent? Secretly straight with wife and children? Post-operation transsexual female? Alien? The blue eyes flashed open and this time Klaus could have sworn they beamed light back into the room. They seemed to have gotten brighter even as Dorian had held them closed. \"Klaus... Do you believe in... the extraordinary?\" \"I have seen things I can't explain scientifically,\" he replied. Like the second time he met Caesar Gabriel and his friends... That had really been an eye-opener. Perhaps not a clear \"yes\", but as close as he was willing to go, at the moment. A slow headache was creeping up on him. He wished he had offered coffee/tea first. He felt as if he could have used a cup of something strong and intensely black. Dorian reached out again. As he did Klaus noted that he must have used one of those bath bomb thingies again, which had left a faint golden shine to his skin. Klaus had exactly once made the mistake of allowing a bomb into the water when they both reclined in the roman bath at House Gloria. The blasted thing had smelled good enough, but he hadn't realised about the gold dust until afterwards. Laurence had even complimented him on his \"radiance\" for fuck's sake! He allowed the hand to touch him, thinking that Dorian wanted to caress his cheek. Which he did - his touch almost burning. Then the fingertips travelled higher, resting for a moment over his frontal lobe, before withdrawing. Even as Dorian still moved the headache vanished. \"What did you do?\" Klaus asked sharply. \"I just wanted to make you feel better, my dearest one. I... I'm on the brink now, you see, so I can do such tiny things. Look at me, Klaus. See what your sharp spy eyes see. You see the change, don't you?\" he asked pleadingly. \"The preparations are almost finished now.\" \"So help me God, yes, I can see it!\" he hissed. The shining eyes; the golden skin and the way Dorian's hair glowed; almost vibrated with electricity. \"Preparations for what?\" \"For my... return. I'm almost ready to go... home.\" The quiet, reverent way he said the last word made Klaus want to shudder, as he remembered his earlier, joking theories. Home... Go home... \"You're not human, are you?\" He wanted to feel stupid asking the question - wanted Dorian to laugh or reach for the phone to transfer him to a mental asylum. He didn't feel stupid, though, and Dorian neither laughed nor moved. As if his words released something, Dorian's hair - the hair Klaus so loved to feel caressing his skin - shifted. The hue went a full shade darker, more golden, and the curls drew in on themselves, tightening up to form almost a helmet around his head. Dorian himself started and reach up to touch a strand. Then he chuckled nervously. \"I guess there's really no use denying it. Besides, this is what I came to talk to you about. Klaus - I can't say I never thought this would happen. I did. In the beginning, that was even why... why I started it. Why I always started it. With anyone. But you... Believe whatever you wish, Klaus - and I know you will anyway - but whatever you believe, please believe this: I love you. I fell in love with you and I... I forgot - all right? I know - I'm the hen-brained idiot, am I not? You call me that often enough...\" \"How can you forget you're a fucking alien?\" Dorian's eyebrows went up. He stared at Klaus for a moment. Then a wistful smile played on his lips. \"I'm not a little green man from Mars, love. Nor will there be any tentacle sex. Klaus - I'm not an alien.\" \"What are you, then?\" He wouldn't make a second guess, not after having failed with his first. The smile filled out with a dash of mirth, even if it remained wistful. \"You're such a quiet man in bed, my dear. I'm not complaining, don't think that I am! It makes each sound I can coax from between your lips so much more precious. Has to do with your upbringing, I guess.\" \"What the fuck has that got to do with anything?\" Klaus retorted testily. \"Do you remember back in May? With... Big Blue?\" Klaus promptly blushed at the mention of the sex aid toy. \"Of course I remember,\" he muttered, unwilling to think too long about that particular night. This was not the time to get aroused. \"That's the only time I ever got you to call out my name in bed, dear.\" An instant repudiation was on Klaus's lips. He had called out \"Dorian\" several times. Not often, no, but there had been occasions. If Dorian even was the other's name? God knew what the big secret really was about. If not an alien, then what? An elfling? An incubus? \"Well, it's not my real name - my name really is Dorian, but I was tempted to answer anyway, just that once.\" Puzzled, Klaus thought back to that night. Then he blanched. Dorian twirled a lock of his hair with a finger, pulling as if testing its strength. \"I'm really only a minor deity,\" he said apologetically. And let us kiss thousands more -- There. It is said. You know. My heart - and my fate - now lies in your gun-callused hands. \"A... minor deity.\" Dorian nodded seriously. Klaus sighed. This is just my luck. \"What's really going on?\" Dorian shrugged. His skin had begun to shift to a more golden hue. His eyes were almost entirely blue now, with just a faint rim of white and a speck of black in the middle. He was still Dorian, though - the face, his smile, the way he sat... \"I seduced a lover from my brother, Apollo. He cursed me. I was sent to the mortal plane. That was a long, long time ago. He would only let me return when I had kissed the same human - the same, willing human - a thousand and a hundred times in a row. I never managed, even if I wanted to... not until now... and now I don't want to leave you!\" The last was said in a wail and Dorian buried his face in his hands. Klaus watched the shivering shoulders, then took a deep breath and scooted close. 't's still Dorian. Just Dorian. I... think? He caressed the long back and all but hissed when Dorian pressed close, curling into him and holding him hard. The warmth almost scalded him. He didn't let go, though, but continued to stroke the body in his arms. The... god... in his arms? \"How many kisses do we have left?\" he asked. The body slumped even heavier against him and there was a sound which he, after a moment's puzzling, translated to \"one\". He sighed. You really believe in cutting things close, don't you? The solution, however, as he saw it, was very simple. \"If you want to stay,\" he said, \"then hit the street and smooch the first guy you see.\" Dorian's head came up like a jack-in-the-box - his eyes now completely, startlingly blue. \"But then I could never kiss you again! Don't you think I would have done that as soon as I realised how many times we had already kissed if I could have?!\" \"But you kissed--\" \"Never on the mouth!\" was quickly, almost angrily repudiated before Klaus could even name one of the hanger-ons that he in his bleaker moments had wondered if Dorian kept on the side. Dorian leaned closer again, resting his head against Klaus's shoulder. \"You stopped kissing me. Then you started again. That mean you want to... go home now?\" He wondered where \"home\" might be and if a mere human could get there, like a hero in a Greek myth. Isn't there something about a field? Through a volcano? Or a riddle? I won't try to convince him otherwise. Not now. No weeping scene. He has made up his mind. Besides, the way he looks now, there's no turning back. And I'm not sure I could remain his lover and never kiss him again. Dorian shook his head. The motion when he pressed his cheek into Klaus's throat felt as a cigarette lighter flame not far from his skin. Then he sat up again and while there was no discernable pupil left in the blue orbs, Klaus knew them to be fixed on him. \"I don't want to go, my dearest,\" said the minor deity with such utter conviction that Klaus could not doubt the words. \"But then you died.\" \"You saw me.\" \"I do have a few powers left. I gain more the closer I get to the... goal. I saw you die.\" \"You brought me back to life?\" \"No! That's just it! I couldn't! I couldn't, Klaus! I was - am - as powerless as most humans! I couldn't protect you, whom I hold dearest. And...\" He closed his eyes for a moment, again as if in great pain. \"... and I wouldn't have been there to - to receive you. When you died. You would have... moved on. Passed. You would have been lost to me forever - do you understand?\" \"Not... really.\" With a frustrated wail, Dorian struck out. His fist impacted with Klaus's living room table, which promptly broke, splinters flying in all directions. Klaus only barely managed to get his arms up to protect his face. He hissed when something scratched him, followed by a slow trickle of blood down his right arm. Then he hissed much louder, when something burned him. Lowering his arms, he saw Dorian withdraw his hand. The wound had closed. \"See?\" the other said pleadingly. \"I will be able to protect you, if you let me, to heal your wounds if you are hurt. I couldn't before. And when the day come that you do die I will be there, Klaus - I'll be waiting to show you... true miracles.\" \"You talk about leaving. I don't--\" want you to go! I want you here, with me! \"--understand why.\" A frustrated shrug answered him. Then Dorian reached up, touching Klaus's throat with his fingertips. They felt as if they should burn through his skin. \"I can't stay. This is not our sphere. If I was strong - at the height of my strength - I could visit. Now I'm weak and I won't be that strong again for years upon years... I will be with you in spirit, though, each step on your march, and I will come to you in your dreams, that I promise. Luck will always be with you.\" \"Luck?\" he asked, not getting the reference. A shy smile. \"Someone will write 'Though she is arguably the most powerful goddess in the entire history of Creation, there are no temples to her. She doesn't like the clicking of rosaries, but is attracted to the sound of dice'. Not that I'm the most powerful, not even remotely. And my eyes aren't green, that's just poetic licence. I do have a soft spot for last, desperate million-to-one chances though - and you will always be able to depend on those, my own. Anyway - that's me.\" He winked. \"Just call me Lady Luck.\" \"I would have thought you a god of art or thieving or whatever.\" A shrug. \"We all have our hobbies. Klaus...\" He stood. \"I... I love you so much. More than I can find words for, while my mind is still somewhat limited by human restraints. I... think that it is time now, though. I'm sorry I waited so long.\" Klaus rose. This is too soon! his mind wailed, but he knew he had to stay strong. Dorian seemed upset enough for both of them. \"One kiss?\" \"Yes.\" \"Then you will be with me always, visit me in my dreams and wait for me when I die?\" \"Yes.\" \"Do you know when that will be?\" \"No, I'm sorry. But Luck--\" \"--will always be with me. So presumably I won't be killed by someone else having a lucky day. I really thought Luck was supposed to be female. Figures my luck is just a queer fop.\" Dorian smiled through his golden tears. \"A misunderstanding. I was wearing a stola...\" Klaus snorted. Then he stepped forward and embraced the human-shaped god that was his lover. The touch burned him, but he held on so hard his grip might have broken the bones of a mere mortal. For a second he managed to rest his forehead against Dorian's. \"I love you,\" he said, looking into the eternal blue. Then he leaned down, at the same time as Dorian reached up. Their lips met. They kissed. Their joining lasted for aeons, until the scalding touch finally forced them apart. For another second or two Klaus looked at the beloved shape... before it slowly dissolved into flakes of gold dust... There. It is done. I'm home again, my labour of love complete. My brother's curse turned out to be a blessing in the end, after all. I should have known. Thanks, Apollo. Without it I would have paid my modern day hero no attention. The way I am now it is endurable to wait the span of a human life. So live your life to the fullest, my dearest, dearest Iron Klaus. Live it long and live it well. Be happy. Luck will always be with you and I will always wait for you. Soon enough we will be together and then we shall never, ever be apart. Our love will be legend. We shall kiss again. Yes - let us kiss thousands more. So we will never know, how many we've had... THE END",

      "He hadn't expected the Earl until the following day, but just as he was brushing his teeth before going to bed someone knocked frantically on his door and there Dorian stood, looking almost on the verge of panicking.",

      "Sex or not, just to be allowed to touch felt like a blessing from the God he hadn't believed in since childhood.",

      "Together they did basically everything two healthy males could indulge in, without resorting to too many props or perversions.",
      "At first Dorian allowed Klaus to top exclusively.",
      "Then he slowly paved the way for a reversal by acquainting Klaus's rear with clever fingers during amazing blow jobs, followed by tantalizing tastes of what he referred to as \"the Turkish treat\" - rimming.",
      "Finally, one hazy evening when they had just returned from a successful mission, both of them eager and in good moods, the Brit had - with infinite care and the gentlest of lovemaking - taken Klaus's last virginity.",

      "The master art thief had treated him as if he was the most precious thing on Earth.",

      "Klaus even suspected that he knew the moment when things changed.",
      "Before then everything had certainly been fine.",
      "Better than fine - everything had been perfect.",
      "He had been happy.",
      "A reason to worry in itself, perhaps, but he had been singularly content with his life.",
      "Oh, there had still been annoyances - he still hadn't been promoted, he still had to deal with the Alphabet on a daily basis, his father was still after him to marry and so on.",
      "But he had had Dorian to make up for things.",
      "His bright, golden, oh so generous lover, who would tease away all his worries and make him smile.",
      "Who seemed to enjoy his very presence as a gift from some higher power.",
      "Who would cover him in kisses, smother him with caresses and leave him breathless with loving.",
      "They weren't together around the clock, of course - that would have been both too much and too impractical.",
      "Any time Klaus was off for longer than a day, though, Dorian would show up - regardless of whether Klaus had informed him of this fact or not.",
      "As before he often invited himself along on missions.",
      "The Alphabet found out about their relationship rather early on, when A, B and Z had happened to rush in on the two of them in a... very compromising position.",
      "They had been staying at a safe house in DeLynn and the three agents had been eager to notify Klaus of a sighted suspect.",
      "Since then knocking on Klaus's door before going in was no longer just obligatory - it was done very loudly and insistently until Klaus answered in no uncertain words that they could enter - and \"Yes!",
      "Yes!",
      "Oh yes!\"",
      "was not an acceptable answer...",
      "Klaus was only glad that the trio hadn't arrived five minutes earlier, when he had been face down on the bed with Dorian vigorously pounding into him.",
      "As it was Dorian had just finished and was sucking him off when the door was flung open...",
      "Ah yes, those had been the good days..",
      "When Dorian wasn't with him in Bonn or at the Schloss, he called at least once a week.",
      "Often on returning home Klaus would find a post card from where Dorian's own little missions took him - often a postcard of some painting or statue that shortly afterwards happened to go missing...",
      "They had arguments over Dorian's occupation - which often turned into arguments over Klaus's own occupation - which often turned into rough, angry sex followed by sweet, loving make-up sex, during which Dorian spent hours worshipping every part of Klaus's body - or long, luxurious marathon sessions of kisses...",
      "The kisses.",
      "Yes.",
      "They marked what Klaus privately thought of as the beginning of the end...",
      "Klaus had visited Dorian at North Downs.",
      "They had been together for a year and a half and while that wasn't any kind of official anniversary, Dorian had sounded a bit tired when they spoke over the phone.",
      "Klaus had, in a rather uncharacteristically hasty decision, said that he would come to visit.",
      "The joy in Dorian's voice - and later in his eyes at seeing Klaus - had been worth the trip and more besides.",
      "He had arrived at two o'clock sharp and they had gone for a walk in the forest surrounding the castle.",
      "Sex outdoors was still very novel and not something during which Klaus thought he would ever really relax.",
      "He did have to admit that it had its charms to feel the warm sun on his body as they lay together beneath the ancient oaks of Dorian's homestead.",
      "They talked about going out for dinner.",
      "Nowhere fancy, just to a small restaurant in the nearby village, where people knew Dorian and wouldn't bat an eye at seeing him escorted by a man.",
      "Klaus, wearing only his trousers, lay with his upper body against a tree.",
      "The Earl himself at first nestled along Klaus's side, with his head on Klaus's chest.",
      "Then he moved to straddle Klaus's upper thighs, caressing his torso with strong hands.",
      "His eyes - blue like the bluebells that grew in abundance around the castle - met Klaus's filled with smouldering desire as Dorian began to recite his favourite poem.",
      "\"Give me a thousand kisses...\" he said, then broke contact between their eyes to kiss Klaus's right nipple.",
      "For a long while he anointed the tiny bud with his tongue, teasing it expertly.",
      "Then he pulled away.",
      "\"Then a hundred...\" he said, apparently now more to Klaus's nipples than to Klaus himself, for he bent to the other side to pay the same homage there.",
      "Klaus felt his cock begin to stir.",
      "As Dorian sat back he scooted a little closer and lifted his gaze.",
      "\"Then give me another thousand kisses...\" This time, when he bent his neck, their mouths met.",
      "First just teasingly, lips to lips, then with more force - tongues greeting and playing, testing one another.",
      "Dorian tasted like nothing Klaus could describe.",
      "No women he had kissed had tasted even remotely like sunlight and heaven and justice and truth - or had by just bringing their lips together made Klaus forget the rest of the world...",
      "It felt as if they kissed forever, mixing their very beings.",
      "With a beatific smile Dorian withdrew, his eyes heavy-lidded.",
      "His clever fingers found Klaus's nipples and he shifted their bodies so their groins met.",
      "Klaus willingly cooperated, thrusting up slowly.",
      "\"... and yet another hundred,\" Dorian continued.",
      "He began to bend down again, apparently intending to indulge in on another such amazing kiss.",
      "And that's when Klaus blew it.",
      "Even half a year later he still didn't know how he blew it, but that was when things changed.",
      "It had felt like such a harmless thing to say!",
      "He still saw no harm in it!",
      "For fuck's sake, it had felt like an almost romantic, mushy, stupid thing to say!",
      "He had said it because he had wanted to please his lover, to prove he was actually paying attention!",
      "\"You must have kissed me a thousand and a hundred times already,\" he said.",
      "Dorian started to smile, but then the smile froze.",
      "His big, blue eyes widened, before blinking.",
      "Once.",
      "Twice.",
      "Trice.",
      "Then he pulled back, sharply.",
      "\"No I haven't!\"",
      "he said - urgently, as if such a thing actually mattered - as if either of them could have kept count after so many months.",
      "Klaus, surprised by the vehement tone of Dorian's voice, hadn't known how to reply, so he had shrugged.",
      "Again - it wasn't as if it actually mattered!",
      "However, apparently the stupid thing had mattered, if only to Dorian.",
      "He had risen from their green bed.",
      "\"No I haven't!\"",
      "he had repeated, sounding... almost scared.",
      "\"I haven't!\"",
      "He shook his head, glorious locks like a whirl of gold in the sunlight.",
      "\"I can't have!\"",
      "Then he turned around and ran for his castle.",
      "Then a hundred.",
      "No",
      "!",
      "No",
      "!",
      "No",
      "!",
      "Oh my, what have I done?",
      "What have I been doing?",
      "I forgot!",
      "The very thing my life here depends on - and I forgot!",
      "Now I've got to stop!",
      "Right away!",
      "I must stop!",
      "But how can I?",
      "I love you so, my dearest German Rose, my one and only!",
      "Oh, cruel fate...",
      "I can't bear leaving you!",
      "I love you...",
      "I've got to stop...",
      "Klaus followed Dorian, of course, seriously worried over what had happened.",
      "He caught up with him before they reached the ancestral home of the Red-Glorias.",
      "By then Dorian had calmed down a bit.",
      "He hugged Klaus hard, though, almost clinging to him.",
      "With his face pressed against Klaus's neck he muttered something about being momentarily confused, something about a mission detail he had suddenly come to think of.",
      "Then he apologized for leaving Klaus \"high and dry\" as he put it.",
      "By way of further apology he showed Klaus an alternate use of the giant tub in Dorian's bathroom, one which involved oil-slick bodies and lots of bubbles.",
      "Klaus let himself be seduced into forgetting the problem.",
      "There had, however, been no further kisses.",
      "That was the gist of the matter.",
      "No further kisses.",
      "Oh, it had taken Klaus a while to catch on.",
      "Dorian still visited often enough.",
      "He called.",
      "Postcards arrived.",
      "They still made passionate love often enough - or had rough, sweaty sex.",
      "Dorian would suckle his nipples and his cock - would use his clever, lovely tongue both here and there to arouse and pleasure him.",
      "He would give him that Turkish treat until Klaus would come from that maddening touch alone.",
      "But he would not kiss Klaus's mouth.",
      "Once in a great while, maybe, a long, tender kiss was bestowed - but no more marathon sessions, no feather light kisses good morning, no indulging kisses good night, no stolen pecks when no Alphabet (or at least not too many of them) could see... Klaus missed those kisses, damn it!",
      "But quite apart from that, the marked change made him wonder.",
      "What he said had clearly upset Dorian.",
      "That \"explanation\" given was obviously so much horse piss.",
      "Klaus had commented on the number of kisses between the two of them - had this frightened the free-spirited Dorian; made him feel bound somehow?",
      "Had it shaken him awake from their honeymoon dream?",
      "Had it made him see reason?",
      "Had they kissed so often that Dorian no longer saw a point in continuing?",
      "And - of course - did that mean that soon the rest of their lovemaking and intimacies would bore him too?",
      "Was the moment in Dorian's life that was Klaus, bit by bit, coming to an end?",
      "Or maybe the story hadn't been horse piss after all?",
      "Sometimes people get confused.",
      "Perhaps Dorian had been ill that day and really had mixed things up in his mind.",
      "That didn't sound plausible, but Klaus did consider the possibility, hoping to find another explanation than that his touch bored the man he loved.",
      "Still - that left the mystery of the missing kisses.",
      "Only in that case the amount of them might not be the problem, but rather the... quality.",
      "Klaus hadn't been totally inexperienced when he finally allowed the Earl to bed him.",
      "He had been with some women.",
      "Not a herd of them, but the ones he had been with seemed pleased enough with how he treated them.",
      "They had mostly been one-night stands, picked up at bars for the sole purpose of sex.",
      "Love hadn't had a place in his life, until Love had almost literally barrelled into him, held him down and tied him up.",
      "The women, though - he had kissed most of them and there had been no voiced complaints.",
      "Of course, in such situations one doesn't comment much on the minor details - there was no need, since no repeat performance was expected.",
      "He had assumed he had done well enough.",
      "Perhaps he had been mistaken.",
      "He honestly didn't think it was an experience thing, though.",
      "Dorian knew what he had gotten into when they became lovers.",
      "He had known Klaus wasn't as sophisticated and experienced as he was himself.",
      "In fact he had seemed to delight in introducing Klaus to all possible sorts of pleasures.",
      "They had spent considerable time trying out different kisses and beyond a few minor suggestions, the kisses in themselves, as Klaus gave them, seemed to have met with enthusiastic approval.",
      "Had he found Klaus's technique less than satisfactory, Dorian would have gently pushed him in the correct direction.",
      "After pondering the matter thoroughly, Klaus drew the conclusion the problem might be simply that Dorian found the taste of his mouth repellent.",
      "The rest of him was aesthetically pleasing enough, so Dorian still indulged in his body, but no longer in his mouth - at least not tastewise, as he always seemed greatly pleased when Klaus used his mouth for other purposes than kissing.",
      "Possibly some British sense of the appropriate kept the nobleman from voicing his dissatisfaction out loud.",
      "Totally ridiculous, but the answer matched up to the facts of the situation.",
      "Klaus decided that while he found it incredibly stupid, he would field test his hypothesis.",
      "He greatly disliked changing for anyone - but for Dorian he would be willing, if only in a minor detail.",
      "So he tried.",
      "God help him, he tried.",
      "Never let it be said that Iron Klaus would surrender without a fight.",
      "Dorian meant a lot to him and he would not let the man slip away due to Klaus's lacks.",
      "Not if the problem could be remedied.",
      "Klaus quit smoking.",
      "He knew Dorian to be courting justice somewhere across the Atlantic, not expected back for a fortnight.",
      "So he requested a long weekend off, Friday to Monday, and went cold turkey.",
      "It hadn't been easy.",
      "Had he had some friend he had trusted enough, he would have just chained himself in the bedroom, asked to have food delivered and the key returned come Monday night.",
      "As it was he forced himself not to slip into the tobacco store for more cigarettes on his unusually long morning runs.",
      "He stayed in Bonn, rather than to have the butler try to \"assist\" him.",
      "The first days were hellish, but he accomplished his mission - as always.",
      "Come Monday afternoon, he felt more tired than he usually would have been after four days off, but the need for nicotine merely simmered deep in his mind, rather than clawed at his sanity every waking moment.",
      "Tuesday morning he went to work as usual.",
      "Okay, so maybe he didn't have to make B cry by growling at him for walking too loudly.",
      "Perhaps he had been just a tiny bit restless.",
      "And maybe he had badgered the Chief just a little too forcefully about a new mission.",
      "But the day passed and he rewarded himself with a good meal that night.",
      "Again, fried potatoes did make at least some sort of substitute for cigarettes.",
      "After that things sailed along smoothly, even with four Alphabets - C, R, S and W - calling in sick.",
      "All with proper doctor's certificates.",
      "He might have been ever so slightly concerned, had he not recognised Dr. Wennham as a man they had worked with in the past.",
      "A slacker himself, the man had left the third day of the mission crying, complaining to all and sundry that Klaus demanded the impossible.",
      "Of course he did!",
      "That was the only way he would get the bare minimum done!",
      "Never mind.",
      "He would take the AWOL 'bets to task on their return.",
      "At the moment he had a more important fish to fry.",
      "Something else he thought might sour his mouth was coffee.",
      "That, however, was a more temporary effect, so he wouldn't have to give it up totally - which was for the better.",
      "He didn't think the Alphabet would survive him quitting both of his habits simultaneously.",
      "Besides, he wasn't sure if he actually was willing to give up coffee...",
      "Cigarettes was one thing - he had read the reports of how unhealthy they were and had considered quitting for a long while.",
      "Coffee was another matter entirely.",
      "Maybe switch to a different brand or whatever, but if Dorian really loved him he shouldn't force him to.",
      "As an experiment, however, instead of a cup as soon as he got out of bed that Saturday, he drank a good-sized glass of water and downed a caffeine tablet, courtesy of the NATO doctor.",
      "That didn't quite equal coffee, he knew that, but the combination should have a similar effect.",
      "He felt jittery and alert, but not in the good way coffee made him feel, but rather in a forced way he disliked.",
      "It was, however, for a good cause.",
      "The day of Dorian's return from overseas had come.",
      "Finally the door bell rang.",
      "Klaus rose and started towards the door.",
      "A glance at the wall clock confirmed that Dorian had made good time from the airport - a quarter to 12.",
      "Unless the flight was delayed he usually arrived between 12 and half past.",
      "Perhaps the plane landed early.",
      "If it was Dorian at all and not some salesman or some guy sent to read his electric meter.",
      "Klaus didn't hurry towards the door.",
      "He never did.",
      "Sometimes he would get there in time, at other - Click.",
      "--times Dorian would beat him.",
      "The door opened.",
      "Even if Klaus had expected it, he still tensed, waiting to ascertain that whoever had just broken into his home really was a welcome intruder.",
      "He liked his and Dorian's little game, but knew all too well that he couldn't fully relax about security breaches.",
      "However, this particular intruder really was welcome.",
      "Feasting his eyes on Dorian's happy smile Klaus walked the last meters and promptly hoisted the man off the ground.",
      "He enjoyed the feel of his lover's solid body in his arms, pressing his nose against his shoulder, with the golden hair in his eyes...",
      "Dorian chuckled, caressed his shoulders possessively and rubbed his smooth-shaven cheek eagerly against Klaus's, like a cat marking its owner's hand.",
      "He even dropped a playful kiss on Klaus's ear.",
      "\"Good morning, my dearest darling!",
      "Have the 'bets behaved while I was away?\" Klaus snorted, then let the man down to let him remove his outdoor clothes.",
      "\"Some are slacking, as they always are,\" he said.",
      "Then he remembered something that Dorian possibly might want to know.",
      "\"Mrs. A's ill.",
      "A mentioned--\" Before he had time to continue, Dorian broke in, nodding, \"Yes, isn't it amazing?",
      "G gave me a call.\"",
      "Klaus frowned.",
      "Why would Dorian think that amazing?",
      "Had he misunderstood or was it possibly some English thing he didn't know about?",
      "\"--that it'd take a while before she'll get better.\"",
      "\"Another month or so, yes.",
      "I have this little necklace laying around, plaited white, red and yellow gold, with stones just the colour of her eyes.",
      "I'm sure she'll like it.\"",
      "Klaus knew Dorian had befriended the woman at the NATO Christmas gathering and had mentioned her illness in case Dorian wanted to send her a \"get well\"-card or whatever.",
      "Perhaps they were better friends than he had thought, if Dorian sent her jewellery for being sick?",
      "In the end he shrugged it off as Dorian being opulently generous again - he was that, at times, when James didn't keep him in line.",
      "\"Your pack, then?\" he asked.",
      "Since Dorian had divested himself of his spring jacket he stepped closer and hugged him again.",
      "On breathing in he all but tasted the unique smell of warm male, expensive eau de cologne, lavender and Dorian.",
      "The other hugged him back in turn, pressing them tightly together.",
      "\"Oh, the boys are just fine.\"",
      "Social niceties dealt with.",
      "There.",
      "This would normally be when Klaus offered coffee - and Dorian would make himself a \"cuppa\".",
      "Tea which mysteriously had appeared, together with a white and green china set, in Klaus's cupboard one morning when he was sure Dorian had visited Japan.",
      "Since he didn't want to drink coffee before testing his hypothesis he knew this was his time to act.",
      "He shifted stance, wrapping his arms loosely over Dorian's, to hold him in place and get his hands into that thick mop of lovely, lovely curls.",
      "Klaus liked Dorian's hair.",
      "He wouldn't say so to anyone but Dorian: wouldn't even mention it to the man himself in as many words, but in rare moments of idle contemplation, Klaus had found himself comparing the locks to the shimmer of gold, almost alive in its vibrant glory.",
      "Soft like angel wings, when Dorian let it slip over Klaus's skin -yet with wispy kind of solidity when Klaus used a handful to caress himself with while Dorian's mouth was otherwise occupied, usually with torturing Klaus's balls.",
      "Dorian looked up at him.",
      "He was only slightly shorter than Klaus, negligible in every way, but he often hammed it up with fluttering eyelashes and seductive glances.",
      "As he lowered his lips Klaus felt a minute tension in the body he held, then the succulent mouth parted to invite him in.",
      "Yes!",
      "Not aware how of much he had expected an instant rejection, Klaus pressed further, initiating a long, sweet kiss.",
      "Dorian tasted like pure heaven - if possible even better than Klaus remembered.",
      "Perhaps there was something to that whole cigarettes affecting taste thing.",
      "Their lips worked against one another - now Dorian giving, now Klaus; tongues sometimes barely touching, sometimes gliding sweetly against one another.",
      "Dorian's hands caressed in wide strokes over his back and Klaus felt intoxicated, lost - almost drunk.",
      "The Brit's hand went farther down, taking a decidedly possessive hold of his buttocks, squeezing them firmly just the way Klaus liked, and then he used them to bring their groins together.",
      "So many sensations...",
      "Klaus was half-hard already, eager to follow Dorian's lead on their next move, though unwilling to surrender the mouth that tasted so good and gave his own such pleasure.",
      "Dorian appeared to be in no hurry either, clinging to the kiss as if it was the last of its kind, exploring Klaus's mouth as though a map later would be of vital importance.",
      "He hummed deep in his throat: a low, murmuring sound that Klaus's interpreted as pure contentedness.",
      "They stood so, in the hallway, kissing one another, until Klaus felt a hint dizzy from having breathed recycled air for too long.",
      "Perhaps it was partly the caffeine tablet too - or the relief he felt, that his ploy apparently had worked.",
      "He started to push Dorian towards the bedroom.",
      "Now he wanted to feel skin against skin and get his mouth on Dorian's dick for a while.",
      "Then he wanted some more kisses.",
      "\"You tasted very good today, my own,\" Dorian told him, one hand still on Klaus's arse while the other was working on the buttons of his billowing, bright green blouse.",
      "\"I quit smoking,\" he explained, pleased with the evidence that Dorian really had felt a difference.",
      "Dorian's entire face lit up in a smile.",
      "\"You did?!",
      "Oh, darling!",
      "I'm so glad for you!\"",
      "He hugged him enthusiastically, then took his hand and tugged him the rest of the way to the bed.",
      "Klaus eagerly followed.",
      "Since Dorian had been gone for a while they didn't bother with much in the way of foreplay - both were already hard and raring to go.",
      "Time for slow touches later, when the edge had been taken off.",
      "So they engaged in a sixty-nine, with Klaus on his back and Dorian arched above him.",
      "To his pleasure Klaus found that the flesh now fed to him also tasted richer than before - as did, at some point later, Dorian's cum.",
      "Afterwards Dorian twisted around to lie with his head on Klaus's shoulder.",
      "Klaus caressed the silken skin over his belly, enjoying the feel of sex-warm muscles.",
      "Then he bent down to catch his lover's lips.",
      "That was when Dorian twisted away, as if afraid that Klaus's mouth would burn him...",
      "He did try to make the move look natural, by bending to nuzzle at Klaus's nearest nipple, but he didn't quite succeed.",
      "Suddenly Klaus felt very, very cold...",
      "Dorian didn't kiss him again that night.",
      "Then give me another thousand kisses.",
      "I'm so sorry, my love, my own - I'm so, so sorry!",
      "You try so hard and I just can't!",
      "Oh, how will you ever forgive me?",
      "Can you ever?",
      "This is torture.",
      "Torture!",
      "A month later, Klaus died.",
      "He had gone undercover to spy on a meeting between a Helsinki mob boss and a Russian arms dealer.",
      "Rumour had it that the latter was actually in league with the KGB, who was trying to trade information about a supposedly top secret Finnish army base.",
      "The base, Klaus knew, didn't exist, but when NATO got the tip - ironically enough from the mob boss himself, a distant cousin to Volovolonte as well as most faithful to the Finnish flag - they had wanted to investigate the sudden interest.",
      "Double the irony - while it was the mob boss who had invited NATO's presence, the operation had been kept secret from his men, to avoid tale-telling.",
      "Klaus had been introduced as one of Volovolonte's men, cooling his heels in the land of the thousand lakes from having been a bit too eager in collecting protection money from the hookers of Rome.",
      "However, one of Don Makkonen's men had actually visited Rome while Klaus had barged his way to Volovolonte that time he pursued Dorian to retrieve the Lubjanka report.",
      "The man recognized Klaus - and shot him.",
      "The bullet hit Klaus in the side.",
      "He wrestled the would-be-assassin to the ground - with a little help from Don Makkonen - then collapsed even as the ambulance rolled to a stop.",
      "Enveloped in a fog of sounds and colours he was vaguely aware of how they loaded him onto a gurney as the hard, rolling Finnish words was spoken loudly around him.",
      "His entire world billowed, like a wave, ending in black lightning.",
      "That was when he died.",
      "In the 30 seconds before they had his heart pumping again, hesitatant at first but then with the same persistent doggedness as always, he saw a vision he would never forget.",
      "He saw Dorian.",
      "Not Dorian as when they first met, an unstoppable force of nature.",
      "Not Dorian from six days previous, strolling towards his car with one, last, jaunty wave goodbye.",
      "Not Dorian as he looked the moment orgasm hit him - how his eyes widened and pupils dilated; how his mouth opened wider and wider as if in both shock and awe; how even his very hair seemed to sparkle with electricity...",
      "No, he saw Dorian in the House Gloria library, wearing his dark red velvet smoking gown.",
      "The man stood by the old polar bear rug on which they had made love more than once.",
      "His right hand reached for volume VI of an art encyclopaedia.",
      "Klaus recognized the pale blue, silver-ornamented spine.",
      "He had seen volumes often enough on the bedroom night table.",
      "In his left hand he carried a green crystal glass with some golden beverage - perhaps the expensive brandy which he on occasion favoured.",
      "Klaus saw everything clearly, as if he stood just behind Dorian - as if he could touch him by just reaching out.",
      "As if it was any of those many evenings they had spent there, together, before getting ready to retire to the bedroom.",
      "Yet what he saw was not a memory.",
      "Klaus knew what had happened.",
      "He was aware that he had been shot.",
      "In a purely instinctive way he had no doubt of his own death.",
      "He even suspected his mind had somehow produced the image before him as a last ditch effort to send him off with something nice to keep him company.",
      "He had time to wonder if there might be some truth to those old wives' tales about the spirit leaving the body at the moment of death to visit a dear one before going wherever souls go in the end.",
      "Not that he expected a white-bearded Gootvater to bid him welcome to Heaven - or a cloven-hoofed Versucher to cautiously allow him entrance to the nether plains.",
      "There was strangeness in the world, though.",
      "For example he had, after their initial meeting, found out more about Caesar Gabriel and his friends, which couldn't be explained rationally.",
      "\"Dorian,\" he said, without even meaning to.",
      "Dropping book and glass, the man in question whirled.",
      "He saw Klaus - clearly saw him, no question about it - and screamed.",
      "Then, while the abrupt yell still lingered, the Brit dove towards him, reaching out as if he was going to grab him.",
      "For a wild moment Klaus thought it would work - that Dorian really would get hold of him and pull him into the reality of House Gloria.",
      "Alas, no. Dorian's fingers went straight through him as through so much air - Klaus didn't even feel them.",
      "He heard Dorian's screamed \"no,\" though, - heard the one word so loudly that his skull still rang from the sound, when he woke to life again, in the back of the Finnish ambulance.",
      "Then a second hundred.",
      "No",
      "!",
      "No",
      "!",
      "No",
      "! I can't!",
      "I can't let you die!",
      "I refuse to!",
      "But how can I help you?",
      "I can't!",
      "Not like this!",
      "But I can't be with you otherwise!",
      "Why must I chose?",
      "This is too much to ask!",
      "I need you so much...",
      "I fear that I must do it, though!",
      "I must be strong and when the day come when you really need me, I must be there for you!",
      "I can't bear to lose you forever!",
      "Sometimes one has to make a sacrifice...",
      "Why must it be so hard, though?",
      "There's still a little time left - for better and for worse, to enjoy you before this ends.",
      "I'll fly free again and so, in the fullness of time, will you.",
      "Perhaps in the end, you'll fly back to me.",
      "There's still a little time left, though - oh such a short time left...",
      "He never asked if Dorian had seen him.",
      "If Dorian had, he rather thought that the man would have told him.",
      "While he himself might be a sceptic, Dorian was open to possibilities - though by no means a conventional believer.",
      "Besides, Klaus wasn't sure how to phrase such a question - \"Were you haunted by my ghost while I was dead?\"",
      "He didn't think so... Regardless, Dorian didn't mention anything out of the ordinary.",
      "He had to tell Dorian about getting shot - it was a bit hard not to, seeing as the next time they met, in Antwerpen, he still wore bandages, even if the wound didn't hurt much any longer.",
      "Dying he didn't mention - he hadn't stayed dead, in the end, so no use prattling on about what could have been.",
      "Dorian then mother-henned him, no matter how hard Klaus tried to discourage him - though maybe he didn't try exceptionally hard when mother-henning in bed including making Klaus lie absolutely still while Dorian did all the work - and how hard he worked...",
      "Including - and this was a very important include in Klaus's mind - kissing him!",
      "Repeatedly!",
      "On the mouth!",
      "That night in Antwerpen marked a drastic change for the better on the kissing front.",
      "Things still weren't as they had been in the initial phase of their relationship, when kisses had fallen like drops of rain, but Dorian no longer avoided mouth-to-mouth contact as if Klaus had oral herpes in its contagious stage.",
      "Instead each meeting would include a minimum of two kisses - sometimes three or four, doled out with the greatest devotion.",
      "Klaus occasionally wondered about Dorian's strange behaviour, but he no longer doubted his love.",
      "Which was good - for Klaus had long since decided that the day Dorian left him would be the day Klaus went to the chief and signed himself up for wet work.",
      "He would never kill himself or take unnecessary risks, but everyone in NATO - with high enough clearance - knew that those who worked in that field - assassination - never lived long.",
      "Then give me yet another thousand kisses, and yet another hundred.",
      "It's almost done.",
      "Almost over.",
      "Almost time.",
      "So help me, I can't wait any longer.",
      "I must tell you now.",
      "I must explain and hope - beg, hope, plead - that you'll be all right with that.",
      "Hope you'll understand.",
      "Hope you trust me enough.",
      "I love you so much...",
      "You're a remarkable man, my own - perhaps you'll understand better than I can dream of.",
      "I'm scared, though... Terrified.",
      "It's a huge thing I've kept secret from you.",
      "I should have told you months ago - years ago.",
      "You wouldn't have believed me, though, so how could I?",
      "Perhaps you still won't, but I've run out of time.",
      "I'm coming now.",
      "I'm coming to you, my dear Major von dem Eberbach.",
      "I'm coming to you - for the last time.",
      "Their relationship was changing again.",
      "This time Klaus wasn't sure what the problem was.",
      "With just one fall off the wagon he hadn't smoked since quitting.",
      "What else could he do?",
      "Especially since Dorian wouldn't tell him about his worries.",
      "Not that Klaus had asked - he didn't know how to broach the subject.",
      "Talking never solved much anyway.",
      "He worried, though, about the ferocity Dorian lately showed in their lovemaking.",
      "The Earl would pound into him as if fucking was about to go out of fashion and he wanted to get in as much as possible before it was considered gauche.",
      "At other times Klaus would wake up in the early morning hours to find the Earl awake, just sitting there, in the dark, studying him.",
      "Even when Dorian slept he did so while wrapping as much of himself around as much as Klaus as possible, holding on to him tightly, sometimes almost suffocating him.",
      "Klaus began to suspect that something was very wrong.",
      "That Dorian might be dying.",
      "Some disease.",
      "Not the plague.",
      "They didn't use protection, something he was sure Dorian would insist on if he had a fatal illness that he could transmit veneraly.",
      "Besides, he had had himself tested after the recent shooting, as the Finns had given him a blood infusion.",
      "Something else, then, that made Dorian act the way he did.",
      "Still, he didn't ask.",
      "\"You about to snuff it?\" felt tasteless and sooner or later something would happen.",
      "If Dorian really was dying he, Klaus, could do nothing about it - better just enjoy their time together and not make things more difficult for the golden-haired Brit. Besides, maybe he was mistaken.",
      "Maybe some other reason existed for Dorian's off-again, on-again mood.",
      "So when the day came, as it eventually must, that Dorian broke into his apartment with a very serious expression and a hint of despair in his eyes, Klaus mentally steeled himself for the worst.",
      "When he tried to initiate an embrace and Dorian simply held up a hand and said \"No,\" Klaus didn't betray his hurt with even a flinch.",
      "So, wet work it would be?",
      "If Dorian died life would be pointless, so he might as well do something useful to end it.",
      "If leaving instead was on the schedule Klaus would let him go - he certainly would make no kind of scene, not even there, in the privacy of his own home.",
      "He had already decided that if Dorian broke up with him he would simply indicate that he himself had also had some news to share - a change of NATO division.",
      "Nothing to do with Dorian's news whatsoever.",
      "He would then talk to the Chief in the morning.",
      "The man had assured Klaus years ago that he would be accepted in that line of work, no questions asked.",
      "He didn't want to live again without sunshine.",
      "\"Klaus, I... We...",
      "I need to tell you something.",
      "Something important.\"",
      "So he is leaving me.",
      "Otherwise he would have kissed me.",
      "Not betraying this thought, he nodded.",
      "\"In the living room.\"",
      "He didn't bother to offer coffee - or tea.",
      "He felt too tense to add caffeine to the mixture and if Dorian wanted tea then he bloody well knew where the stuff was kept.",
      "So they sat on the high-backed, old-fashioned couch, turned towards one another, and waited.",
      "Klaus waited, that was, while Dorian fidgeted.",
      "He looked at the small pastel of Schloss Eberbach that Klaus's mother had painted, which hung on the wall over the television.",
      "He studied his knees.",
      "He glanced at Klaus.",
      "He corrected the lay of his bracelets.",
      "He wiped non-existent dust off his collar.",
      "He tapped his fingernails on his thighs.",
      "Klaus felt like shaking him, just to get him to be still.",
      "\"Oh, this is awkward,\" Dorian said with a weak chuckle.",
      "Klaus didn't comment.",
      "Awkward it was, so better just get it over with.",
      "Inside he felt leaden and so very, very tired.",
      "\"Klaus?\"",
      "He looked up and met the blue gaze.",
      "Dorian's eyes seemed unusually bright.",
      "Not bright like they got when he was about to cry - something Klaus had seen only twice - but in a more vivid way.",
      "They were bluer than he remembered them ever being: an intense, all-encompassing blue with a hint of gold-shimmering green and pin-point pupils.",
      "This alarmed Klaus faintly, because he didn't see why that should be.",
      "Had Dorian taken something?",
      "Medications? Drugs?",
      "\"I... have a confession to make.\"",
      "Wanting it over and done with, Klaus nodded again.",
      "\"Out with it.\"",
      "Confession?",
      "Leaving he could say nothing about, that was the other's call, but...",
      "If he has been unfaithful I will kill him.",
      "Dorian turned his face sideways.",
      "He looked pained.",
      "When he turned back again, his eyes gleamed, reminding Klaus of a cat's, shining in the dark.",
      "\"I never meant to wait this long before telling you.",
      "I kept saying to myself I should tell you, but... it never seemed like the right moment and I just wanted a little more time to... to be with you.\"",
      "This puzzled Klaus.",
      "\"Before what?\"",
      "Was Dorian dying after all, not leaving him for some two-bit male strumpet?",
      "Why no kissing, then?",
      "He wanted to reach out, but in the end stayed still, rather than to risk exposing his heart.",
      "\"I'm getting there.",
      "I'm sorry, my dear, but, please, let me finish?",
      "I know what I need to say.",
      "It's just... difficult.\"",
      "He shrugged.",
      "Dorian bridged the distance between them with a hand, stroking almost reverently over Klaus's knuckles.",
      "Klaus had to make a conscious effort to neither flinch nor pull away.",
      "Dorian felt feverishly warm.",
      "\"You sick?\" he asked.",
      "Dorian smiled bleakly.",
      "\"No.\"",
      "\"You feel hot.\"",
      "The smile wavered - for a brief moment it was Dorian's usual, bright smile, the one that signalled that he was on the verge of saying something outrageous.",
      "Then the happy expression dimmed and he shook his head.",
      "\"It's not because I'm ill.",
      "I... Klaus...\" He looked down again, breaking contact between their eyes and pinching his own shut.",
      "Klaus waited.",
      "His mind, though, raced, trying to find a reasonably explanation for the odd behaviour.",
      "Undercover KGB agent?",
      "Secretly straight with wife and children?",
      "Post-operation transsexual female?",
      "Alien?",
      "The blue eyes flashed open and this time Klaus could have sworn they beamed light back into the room.",
      "They seemed to have gotten brighter even as Dorian had held them closed.",
      "\"Klaus...",
      "Do you believe in... the extraordinary?\"",
      "\"I have seen things I can't explain scientifically,\" he replied.",
      "Like the second time he met Caesar Gabriel and his friends...",
      "That had really been an eye-opener.",
      "Perhaps not a clear \"yes\", but as close as he was willing to go, at the moment.",
      "A slow headache was creeping up on him.",
      "He wished he had offered coffee/tea first.",
      "He felt as if he could have used a cup of something strong and intensely black.",
      "Dorian reached out again.",
      "As he did Klaus noted that he must have used one of those bath bomb thingies again, which had left a faint golden shine to his skin.",
      "Klaus had exactly once made the mistake of allowing a bomb into the water when they both reclined in the roman bath at House Gloria.",
      "The blasted thing had smelled good enough, but he hadn't realised about the gold dust until afterwards.",
      "Laurence had even complimented him on his \"radiance\" for fuck's sake!",
      "He allowed the hand to touch him, thinking that Dorian wanted to caress his cheek.",
      "Which he did - his touch almost burning.",
      "Then the fingertips travelled higher, resting for a moment over his frontal lobe, before withdrawing.",
      "Even as Dorian still moved the headache vanished.",
      "\"What did you do?\" Klaus asked sharply.",
      "\"I just wanted to make you feel better, my dearest one.",
      "I... I'm on the brink now, you see, so I can do such tiny things.",
      "Look at me, Klaus.",
      "See what your sharp spy eyes see.",
      "You see the change, don't you?\" he asked pleadingly.",
      "\"The preparations are almost finished now.\"",
      "\"So help me God, yes, I can see it!\"",
      "he hissed.",
      "The shining eyes; the golden skin and the way Dorian's hair glowed; almost vibrated with electricity.",
      "\"Preparations for what?\"",
      "\"For my... return.",
      "I'm almost ready to go... home.\"",
      "The quiet, reverent way he said the last word made Klaus want to shudder, as he remembered his earlier, joking theories.",
      "Home...",
      "Go home...",
      "\"You're not human, are you?\"",
      "He wanted to feel stupid asking the question - wanted Dorian to laugh or reach for the phone to transfer him to a mental asylum.",
      "He didn't feel stupid, though, and Dorian neither laughed nor moved.",
      "As if his words released something, Dorian's hair - the hair Klaus so loved to feel caressing his skin - shifted.",
      "The hue went a full shade darker, more golden, and the curls drew in on themselves, tightening up to form almost a helmet around his head.",
      "Dorian himself started and reach up to touch a strand.",
      "Then he chuckled nervously.",
      "\"I guess there's really no use denying it.",
      "Besides, this is what I came to talk to you about.",
      "Klaus - I can't say I never thought this would happen.",
      "I did.",
      "In the beginning, that was even why... why I started it.",
      "Why I always started it.",
      "With anyone.",
      "But you...",
      "Believe whatever you wish, Klaus - and I know you will anyway - but whatever you believe, please believe this: I love you.",
      "I fell in love with you and I... I forgot - all right?",
      "I know - I'm the hen-brained idiot, am I not?",
      "You call me that often enough...\" \"How can you forget you're a fucking alien?\" Dorian's eyebrows went up.",
      "He stared at Klaus for a moment.",
      "Then a wistful smile played on his lips.",
      "\"I'm not a little green man from Mars, love.",
      "Nor will there be any tentacle sex.",
      "Klaus - I'm not an alien.\"",
      "\"What are you, then?\"",
      "He wouldn't make a second guess, not after having failed with his first.",
      "The smile filled out with a dash of mirth, even if it remained wistful.",
      "\"You're such a quiet man in bed, my dear.",
      "I'm not complaining, don't think that I am!",
      "It makes each sound I can coax from between your lips so much more precious.",
      "Has to do with your upbringing, I guess.\"",
      "\"What the fuck has that got to do with anything?\" Klaus retorted testily.",
      "\"Do you remember back in May?",
      "With... Big Blue?\" Klaus promptly blushed at the mention of the sex aid toy.",
      "\"Of course I remember,\" he muttered, unwilling to think too long about that particular night.",
      "This was not the time to get aroused.",
      "\"That's the only time I ever got you to call out my name in bed, dear.\"",
      "An instant repudiation was on Klaus's lips.",
      "He had called out \"Dorian\" several times.",
      "Not often, no, but there had been occasions.",
      "If Dorian even was the other's name?",
      "God knew what the big secret really was about.",
      "If not an alien, then what?",
      "An elfling?",
      "An incubus?",
      "\"Well, it's not my real name - my name really is Dorian, but I was tempted to answer anyway, just that once.\"",
      "Puzzled, Klaus thought back to that night.",
      "Then he blanched.",
      "Dorian twirled a lock of his hair with a finger, pulling as if testing its strength.",
      "\"I'm really only a minor deity,\" he said apologetically.",
      "And let us kiss thousands more -- There.",
      "It is said.",
      "You know.",
      "My heart - and my fate - now lies in your gun-callused hands.",
      "\"A... minor deity.\"",
      "Dorian nodded seriously.",
      "Klaus sighed.",
      "This is just my luck.",
      "\"What's really going on?\" Dorian shrugged.",
      "His skin had begun to shift to a more golden hue.",
      "His eyes were almost entirely blue now, with just a faint rim of white and a speck of black in the middle.",
      "He was still Dorian, though - the face, his smile, the way he sat...",
      "\"I seduced a lover from my brother, Apollo.",
      "He cursed me.",
      "I was sent to the mortal plane.",
      "That was a long, long time ago.",
      "He would only let me return when I had kissed the same human - the same, willing human - a thousand and a hundred times in a row.",
      "I never managed, even if I wanted to... not until now... and now I don't want to leave you!\"",
      "The last was said in a wail and Dorian buried his face in his hands.",
      "Klaus watched the shivering shoulders, then took a deep breath and scooted close. 't's still Dorian.",
      "Just Dorian.",
      "I... think?",
      "He caressed the long back and all but hissed when Dorian pressed close, curling into him and holding him hard.",
      "The warmth almost scalded him.",
      "He didn't let go, though, but continued to stroke the body in his arms.",
      "The... god... in his arms?",
      "\"How many kisses do we have left?\" he asked.",
      "The body slumped even heavier against him and there was a sound which he, after a moment's puzzling, translated to \"one\".",
      "He sighed.",
      "You really believe in cutting things close, don't you?",
      "The solution, however, as he saw it, was very simple.",
      "\"If you want to stay,\" he said, \"then hit the street and smooch the first guy you see.\"",
      "Dorian's head came up like a jack-in-the-box - his eyes now completely, startlingly blue.",
      "\"But then I could never kiss you again!",

    "text": "Cassandra enters the palace with her eyes closed shut. Unerringly her feet forge a path up the stairs and into the hall, though her mind is still full of images: blood that pours from Agamemnon and from her, the distant chambers of Hades which soon will be her home. It will be a blessing to be out of Apollo's burning reach. Clytaemnestra's footsteps clack across stone. \"You dare come into my house, you little harlot?\" \"There seemed no point in waiting.\" The backs of her eyelids are burning red, but in this flickering echo of torchlight Cassandra sees every year that Clytaemnestra waited for her husband to come home, the thoughts of Helen with her new man, the hope that she and Helen were still alike enough to find pleasure in the same things. She sees pain and knife-sharp memory. Not to mention anger. \"Look at your better, girl!\" The footsteps storm closer, no longer disguising the wet drag of Clytaemnestra's blood-soaked chiton or the madness breathing at the edge of her voice. Cassandra knows that madness well; it makes her laugh and laugh and laugh. Laughing, indeed, she falls to the floor, ten long years of war from all three of their perspectives filling her mind beyond capacity; it's Cassandra's that gutters and dies. \"Helen, how could you leave Sparta? Will I ever see you again?\" \"I am happy here, sister - on the days I do not weep.\" \"Do you even remember me? When we were children? I have no memory of you, just three too different daughters: one dead, one mad, one dull and plain and reverent.\" \"I'll have no children, but you're always in my heart.\" \"Come home, so I may laugh with you again; I am so dreadfully alone.\" \"Come home to Troy - the world is vast and splendid, you will see.\" \"... If they return without you, then I'll go. I have yet work to do.\" \"You are diligent, sister, all too...\" \"GET UP!\" Clytaemnestra is screaming. \"GET UP!\" Cassandra's mind is still overcome by the great dark anger she can see. She does not get up, but is dragged, clothes wrenched around her neck as she is tossed against the wall. Wetness seeps onto her hair from somewhere near pain in her skull; she wonders if Apollo is watching, if he cares his favourite toy is being broken. \"How could you?\" she begs in someone's voice, certain only that it isn't hers. \"FILTHY TROJAN WHORE!\" She's thrown again; it feels like she's been bathing, with her skin soft from oil but her hair still wet, dripping on her shoulders. The pain is gone, but she's sure it shan't forget her. Aegisthus' bed was never enough. Oh, yes, she sees that now. They are not so alike, in the end, these sisters. Helen would never let the blood touch her hands. \"LOOK AT ME!\" The last sight Cassandra sees is her most complete and perfect vision; it's accompanied by a crack like thunder. It is a woman's face drawn white, blood in her hair and on her cheeks, eyes dark and hollow. And so she goes.",

    "text": "What more could be expected of her, cursed daughter of incest? What else could she do? Certainly, Ismene thought as she ducked past guards, fugitively seeking out her sister's tomb, she couldn't be expected to obey her king's law, not in the end. The cave was easy to find, just beyond the palace walls. Creon might believe he could lock her sister away without the miasma finding him, but he wasn't so arrogant as bring a tomb inside the city. She followed the stone stairs down, away from the upper world, imagining her sister taking the same path, head held high as if walking to her marriage bed. \"Oh, who is it now?\" came her sister's strident voice as Ismene unlocked the door with her stolen key. \"Is Creon not content with... Ismene?\" She'd been here for less than a day, but Ismene thought she could already see the darkness and the hunger seeping into Antigone's skin. She held her torch aloft, stepping fully into the room, tears swelling at the sight of Antigone's reddened eyes and loose hair. \"Oh, Antigone...\" she cried, rushing over to embrace her sister. They held each other for long, full seconds. \"Come now,\" she said, trying to keep her voice strong, despite how frail her sister felt in her arms. She continued, drawing back, \"Let us escape - to Athens, or elsewhere if Theseus will not take us. We must be gone from Thebes.\" \"We - no...\" Antigone replied, shaking her head and wiping away fresh tears. \"I am wedded to this death - I cannot...\" \"You cannot?\" Uncomprehending, Ismene stared at her sister, frozen. She explained fervently. \"They would know,\" she said, frowning as she watched ants crawl beneath them. \"They would know that you had freed me, think you as worthless as I; I cannot - it is right they should think one of our family virtuous, that the possibility should remain that we sinned by choice rather than necessity.\" Then she looked up pleadingly, hope (which had to be for Ismene, since it could not be for herself) rounding her eyes to circles. That look snapped Ismene from her disbelief. She shouted helplessly, \"I don't care what they think, Antigone!\" Her gaze darted around the tomb, if it could be called that, empty of every offering, belonging or memory. \"I care that you will die, not long from now!\" Did Antigone not realise this? \"If my virtue is the price for your life, then I wish I had never been born to our noble house.\" Reaching a hand back, she loosened her own hair from its respectable knot and tossed her comb to the floor. \"Respect is worth nothing,\" she insisted, meeting her sister's eyes again. \"Come with me.\" But Antigone backed away, shaking her head as a little of her old stubborn pride came over her posture, though her voice was still laced with misery. \"No, Ismene, by the two goddesses, I won't,\" she declared. \"A woman may not abandon her home. You were not at the ceremony, but the gods themselves observed it: this is the house of my marriage, my rightful place.\" For a moment, Ismene stared, part of her mind now calculating how long the guards would take to realise their key was missing and reach the cave behind her. It would not be long. \"Antigone...\" she pleaded desperately. Yet her sister did nothing but turn her back, trembling as she raised her eyes to the wall. \"Leave me now, Ismene.\" In her mind she could already hear the footthumps of the Theban guards. \"No,\" she said simply, helplessly, then threw the torch to the sandy floor.",

    "text": "The Collective of Cycladean Goddesses (or simply the Collective, as it was affectionately known) met once a year in June, and had been doing so for many years now. Someone was nominated to play host and for one week they all had the chance to let their hair down (or put it up, in the case of the Sirens, who used the opportunity to slob around and be generally cantankerous). One year, maybe twenty before the Greco-Trojan War, it was Calypso's turn to have everyone over to Ogygia. It had been a great success, with lots of wine and trading of potion recipes - Phaethusa and Lampetia had been on a shopping trip to Egypt, so had lots of innovations to share from their friends over there. Late on Friday night, however, nearly everyone had gone to bed, pleading exhaustion and an early start on the tide tomorrow. Circe and Calypso were the only ones still awake. They were both rather drunk. \"But, I mean, what I'm saying is,\" Circe slurred, her betwitching and sweet voice tripping quickly over syllables, \"I've met the Muses and they're all fucking - awful! Absolutely fucking awful! Obsessed with the men in their life, won't stop talking about them - there are other things to sing about, you know?\" \"Mmmm,\" nodded Calypso, feeling quite tired herself and beginning to wonder how long it would take to clean up the cave. \"But that's their problem, you know? Clearly they don't have lives - and if they don't have lives they don't have lives; it's probably because they all live together like they're still children or something. At least the Sirens have separate houses.\" \"Yeah, yeah, I bet that's it.\" Circe deflated slightly, sinking against purple cushions. She didn't really have much else to bitch about, not involving the Muses anyway, though their cooking had been awful too and they'd been too cheap to order takeaway ambrosia. \"Do you ever think about moving back to the mainland?\" she decided on as a question, thinking that the Muses had at least had the opportunity for takeaway ambrosia. \"Well...\" Mulling it over, Calypso hesitated, swirling her wine in the cup before taking another swallow. \"I can tell you a story about that - you know my half-sisters look after Hera's garden, down in Morocco?\" Nodding, Circe replied, \"Oh yeah, with that dragon, what's his name - Ladle?\" \"Ladon,\" Calypso corrected. \"I think... Anyway, I went to visit them a couple of months ago and, well - they're meant to be near the sea, aren't they? But there was nowhere to land my boat and wandering up the mountain there was this viper and - uggh.\" She shuddered at the memory. \"It was awful.\" \"Couldn't you command it?\" Circe asked, shifting on her chair and wanting the story now. \"You can, like, talk to animals as well as I can.\" \"Yes, well, I did tell her!\" Also leaning forward on her chair, Calypso gesticulated her story, castigating the rug beneath their chairs with a pointed finger. \"I'm visiting the Hesperides, I said, so you'd best tell me the way or their dragon will come and cook you up. But then! Oh, then she had the nerve to say back that she'd never heard of them! And so I asked, still fairly politely, but, you know, firm: well, they live near here, so I'm surprised by that... And she dared say, like, look, love, the mountains are slightly larger than whatever little bit of rock you're from; this isn't epic, right, so we don't all know each other - now piss off before I bite you!\" Circe could barely contain herself, \"Fucking rude!! How dare she!\" \"I know! And I'm thinking, I'm not standing for this - and she was only maybe a foot long besides - so I swung my walking stick and flicked her off the path, carrying on my way...\" Slightly out of breath, Calypso paused, shaking her head and sipping some more wine to cool herself down (though, had they remembered to mix in the water for this batch? Oh well). \"Anyway, that's the problem with the mainland, isn't it? Everyone's so rude. I can't imagine ever coming to Aeaea and being treated like that if I were trying to find you.\" \"No one would have the nerve!\" Circe shook her head, fire in her eyes. \"Honestly... This is why we need the Collective, you know,\" she continued fervently. \"This is why we need to stick together, because no one else is going to do it, are they? I mean, are they?\" \"No!\" Calypso agreed angrily, though she wasn't entirely sure what Circe meant, precisely. \"They're not!\" \"We need to tell each other these things, so that we know we're not alone!\" \"Yeah!\" \"YEAH!\" That of course was when Thelxiepeia groaned from the floor. \"Will the pair of you keep it down?\" she asked blearily. \"Some of us don't want to crash on our own rocks tomorrow.\" \"Oh, yeah,\" Calypso replied sheepishly, as Circe took her cue to get some rest herself. \"Sorry.\" And so the CCG Meet ended, for another year.",

    "text": "\"I want Polyxena.\" The line's always crackly when my father calls me. It's hard to make out his words over the rasp of rain on the grimy window. \"You want who?\" \"Polyxena. Hector's sister.\" Then something about Troilus, and something about a temple. I get about one word in three, but it's not worth making him repeat himself. Achilles, hero of the War, man of honour (though he was draft-dodging in drag when he met my mother), never repeats himself. You're expected to be listening first time round. \"Polyxena?\" I repeat, when the crackling settles down to silence. \"Isn't she dead?\" \"She's alive,\" says Achilles. \"She's the girl who told them about...\" About your heel, I don't say. Told them how you could be killed. Paris and Deiophobus, with their bows: or Apollo himself, if you believe what you read in the red-tops. I never believe anything with a by-line. \"And now to make amends,\" says my father. \"I want you to do it.\" \"Do what?\" \"Make the sacrifice,\" and suddenly his words are very clear. \"Slit her throat and send her scurrying down to me.\" * * * I don't like the idea of slitting a girl's throat, never mind if she's responsible for my father's death. Turns out I'm not the only one. Next morning -- though it's dark enough for night, the sun never shines here any more and the rain comes down, and down -- there's a middle-aged woman waiting for me in my office, dressed in black: designer black, though it's stained with mud and crumpled with wear. Her face is crumpled, too, but that's just grief. I've seen a lot of that since the War ended. I know who she is before she says a word, but I let her tell me anyway. \"I am Hecuba, who was Queen of Troy.\" She speaks like an oracle, like a woman who's used to addressing crowds. \"All my children are lost to me, taken by the Greeks, hurried down to Hades: all my children save my daughter Polyxena, my last joy. Please, please don't take her from me!\" \"I'm Pyrrhus,\" I say, though she has to know this already. \"Achilles has asked for Polyxena, and I must honour his wishes: he is my father.\" \"He is dead,\" spits Hecuba. \"My daughter is alive.\" \"Many are dead,\" I say. \"Let your daughter be the last.\" \"Take me instead!\" she pleads, and the tears start. I knew she'd cry. I don't offer her a tissue. \"Why would he want you?\" I say. It's vicious, but it's true. She's not young: her body's slack with age and grief and all those kids. My father might welcome her death, but he'd cold-shoulder her ghost. Not like pretty Polyxena. (I checked her file. She's a doll.) \"Polyxena is young,\" sobs Hecuba. I don't want to be impressed by the way she holds my gaze despite the tears. \"You might wed her. Any living man might wed her. Don't send her down to the dark, I beg you.\" \"It isn't my call,\" I say, and it's not really a lie. * * * Polyxena must've been watching my door, because the echo of Hecuba slamming it has hardly died away before she's cracking it open again, slinking in like a lady who doesn't want to be seen. Her hair is slick and dark with rain, but I know from the photographs that it's pale and fine when it's dry. Her dress is wet and clinging, too, which makes up for the high collar and the long skirt. Never mind if she doesn't want anyone to see her, she's a sight worth looking at. \"I'm sorry,\" I blurt out before she can say anything. Funny: it's not even a lie. \"Don't be sorry.\" She's hoarse -- she must have wept and wailed at a lot of funerals lately -- and she doesn't help anything by lighting up a cigarette. (I take the one she offers me.) \"My father --\" \"I... admired him,\" she says, staring out of my window at the rain, the ruins, the distant looming ships at the quay. \"Your father. He was a great man.\" \"I know.\" \"If things had... if the War had never happened, I would have wed him gladly.\" I try to think of her as a stepmother. Can't. She's nothing like my mother Deidamia at all. My mother is like a statue, solemn, burnished, a work of art. Polyxena is no older than me: she looks very young, in a way I don't think I ever was, in her damp dress, with her pale skin and red red lips. \"If the War had never happened, we'd none of us be here,\" I say roughly. \"I don't mind. What he wants. That he wants me.\" She's smoked her cigarette to the filter: she lights another, hands deft, without looking down, and keeps talking. \"I'd rather die a princess -- a virgin princess -- than live a slave amongst your... amongst the Greeks.\" \"We're not savages,\" I snap. \"You'd be --\" \"Send me to your father,\" says Polyxena, lifting her chin. \"I shan't flinch from it.\" Then, softly, \"will you do it? Will you make the sacrifice?\" It's the only thing I can do for her. \"Tonight,\" I say. \"At my father's tomb.\" -end-",

    "text": "He's barely been in the other god's presence for five minutes, and his temples are already pounding gently just beneath reach of his fingers. It's a talent Zeus has. Hades is also certain Zeus has something else to attend to, some lightening bolt or other project that should require careful attention. But no, he pulled his brother aside to talk about his latest fucking conquest. Poor Io. Poor Hera, for that matter, who was shamed into marrying him in the first place. Zeus is an idiot. As often as it occurs to him, Hades knows that it's not entirely fair. Zeus is good at controlling the unmanageable family atop Olympus, and just enough in his dealings with the mortals and immortals who come to him for help. But his desires and moods are as changeable and unpredictable as the weather he holds sway over. The only constant, so far as Zeus is ever concerned, is that he will weather the consequences. His latest conquest might not, but that's immaterial. Zeus is forever. They're not. Keeping up with those kind of changes, with the why's and how's and what-for's, for more than about five bloody minutes makes Hades seasick. He is the constant against Zeus's whims, one of the few inevitabilities in a world of conflicting desires. Zeus is not that much younger than Hades - certainly not after millennia of their rule - but he never fails to make Hades feel incredibly old and tired, and that only compounds his irritation at his brother's insensibility. Can he ever decide, just once, that he doesn't have to have whatever it is he wantsnow like a spoiled child. So \"idiot\" it is. It's much simpler. -- Hera is different. Hera is more constant, and Hades likes that about her. She was once a sister he could rely on, proud and haughty and convinced of her own righteousness, to cut through whatever it was that was holding them back. However, she is also miserable. Oh, she'll always deny it, even on those days Hades sits beside her in her garden and misses what she once was. She threads flowers through her hair and teases her handmaidens and tells Hades he's projecting his own gloom onto her, but the slight tremble to her lips suggests she knows she's not fooling him. And they both know that she can't hide the anger burning in her eyes concerning her husband's latest antics. The hating and the hiding have turned her cruel as well as miserable, and Hades pays his sister fewer visits than he once did. He misses her haughty confidence, but he'll never tell her that. When he comes to her after Io, Hades listens to her lies as though he believes every word and lets her ignore the elephant in the room and never mention Io. He twists flowers through her hair in a way Persephone taught him and talks of household management. It's not her fault, that she and Zeus are what they are. -- \"You're wet.\" Hades wrinkles his nose. He's never hated the smell of sea brine, but he can't say he's fond of it, either. And Poseidon positively reeks of it. But Poseidon just shakes his hair our like a dog and grins as the curls spring back into place. \"What did you expect, brother?\" Hades snorts and doesn't answer, because there is none that really works, and Poseidon ignores his brother entirely and starts talking excitedly about sea battles and Athena and possibly having bested her for once. Hades sighs. Not only does he find the rivalry between Poseidon and their niece tiresome, he is certain that neither of his brothers could stay on one topic to save their lives. But unlike Zeus, who's changes are all-too-often sudden and unwarned, Poseidon is relatively easy to read. Oh, the wind can pick up and there can be a storm in his eyes before anyone knows it, but Hades knows the language. The shifts are also steady, almost rhythmic in nature. His fury, his calms, his good-natured ribbing and bouncing when he's gotten his way. He's as constant as the tides - he will change, but it will be more gradual than Zeus's sudden gales. Hades is still mildly irritated by the wave of enthusiasm for tiremes crashing against each other and upping his workload, however. -- But while Zeus inspires exhaustion, Hera unspoken pity, and Poseidon mild irritation, if there is one sibling he truly dislikes, it is Demeter. She is everything Hades is not - greenery and sunlight, and pure, blinding life scurrying around her. She bursts with it, and Hades can feel his own coldness curling inwards whenever she is around. There shouldn't be so much of that in one place. And it certainly doesn't help that she loathes him in turn. He took Persephone away. Never mind that she comes back to her mother every fall. Nevermind that Hades adores her daughter. Hades and Demeter are complete opposites, and then he took Persephone away. He doesn't come near her if he can possibly avoid it. -- Hestia is tending the fire. Hades comes in quietly and sits on the floor beside her, watching her watch the flames, and how the reddish heat flickers over her pale face. She ignores him at first - but then, Hestia ignores everyone at first, her focus always on the sacred flame. Finally, she glances at him, arching a brow. \"How are they?\" Hades smiles sardonically. \"Do you really want to know?\" \"I can guess.\" She wipes a brown curl back behind her ear and leans back, cocking her head slightly. \"And your realm?\" \"As it always is. Just as the family is as different as ever.\" Hestia smiles, and they settle back to enjoy each other's presence in silence. The warmth flickers over Hades, too. It's comforting, as changeable as the gods of the living are, that he will always be able to steal a few moments at Hestia's hearth and with it a small taste of true peace.",

    "text": "It was a small, slightly worn-in basement bar in New York City called the Vines, and Castiel was certain there was some kind of occult significance to the twelve carefully arranged tables and columns in twelve different varieties of wood. The columns were also elaborately carved with vines and satyrs and mythical scenes. Castiel did not recognize all of them. Nor did he recognize the incredible array of bottles and glasses behind the bar, crammed into almost overflowing shelving. The barman knew them all by name and method of distillation, however, and was happy to share if Castiel asked. There was something that was bothering Castiel slightly about that barman, even so. He was tallish and thinnish and had curly dark hair, with incredibly green eyes and an easy smile, and he appeared to know all of his customers by name. Castiel was also fairly certain that the gorgeous blonde at the end of the bar was only ordering mixed drinks to watch him make them, because he tossed bottles around as though it were a paid performance. Castiel did not know as much about human interaction as he would like, but he would have thought they were flirting if she were not addressing him as a brother. Everyone else called him Danny. None of that bothered Castiel, however. There was just something about the man that the angel couldn't quite place. He hadn't come in sober, however, and apparently it was interfering with his senses. But Danny was also pouring whiskey shots with no showmanship to speak of while he chatted with his sister and asked the people coming in how business was going, so Castiel made himself quite comfortable before the crowds started to part and the barman's gorgeous sister stopped laughing at her brother's antics and departed. By now, the bar was mostly empty. It occurred to Castiel dimly that the barman might like him to leave as well. So he wasn't terribly surprised when Danny hung a few newly cleaned glasses overhead and leaned across the bar. \"Are you just going to keep shooting back whiskey until you keel over on my floor?\" he asked. Castiel considered it. \"I will not keel over.\" Danny snorted. \"If you say so. Still, are you planning on doing it with whiskey or can I interest you in something else?\" This got a surprised blink out of the angel. \"I beg your pardon?\" The barman shrugged. \"I can respect it if you know what you like, but I know one drink can get boring after awhile, especially when you've run up a tab of....\" He checked one of the sheets of paper by the cash register. \"Seventeen of them.\" \"Oh.\" Castiel glanced at the line of bottles, wondering if he should humor the man or not. \"What is in the turquoise bottle?\" he asked finally. \"That?\" Danny flipped a glass up from under the bar and reached for it. \"That was a favorite drink in Atlantis, once upon a time. Haven't had anyone order it in nearly a hundred years. My uncle was rather fond of it once, though.\" He measured it into the glass and pushed it across the bar. \"I always thought it was a bit seaweedy.\" Castiel lifted it to his lips. It did have an unusually salty flavor. \"So tell me,\" Danny added, tapping the table lightly. \"Is this a getting smashed in celebration, or is this sticking one's head in a barrel of wine to drown your troubles?\" Castiel stared into the drink from Atlantis and moistened his lips. It was slightly sticky. \"I am... undecided.\" \"Ah. One of those.\" He shrugged and picked up a rag to wipe down the bar. \"Well, I'm not going anywhere.\" After Castiel was finished with the turquoise drink, Danny told him he wouldn't like a red bottle because it was intended for the Kindly Ones and got him something luridly purple instead. Then he pulled up the stool behind the bar and poured himself a glass of wine. \"So does this have anything to do with the Christian apocaylpse, angel boy?\" Castiel blinked. Danny threw his hands up, palms out in surrender. \"Hey, my nose is clean. Not all of us are Hermes.\" He ran a hand along the lip of his glass and added quietly, \"I'm the most mortal of the gods, anyway, so I didn't stand a chance against the likes of Lucifer.\" \"It's over,\" Castiel answered. \"Lucifer and Michael are trapped in Lucifer's cage.\" Danny - or rather Dionysus, Castiel recognized the feel of him now, even surrounded by the buzz of drunkenness that would have otherwise disguised such a similar aura - picked up the glass, regarded the wine within for a moment, and then tossed the entire thing back. \"So who did you loose?\" he asked. \"How is that your conclusion?\" Castiel said. \"You said you were undecided. If you didn't loose someone important to you, then I can't fathom how tonight could be anything but a getting smashed in celebration.\" \"Oh.\" Castiel regarded the lurid purple drink. It was entirely too sweet, and he was trying not to think about Gabriel because of it. \"They weren't... lost,\" he said finally. He expected Dionysus to clarify what he meant - at any rate that was Dean or Sam's usual reaction to Castiel taking a metaphor too literally - but the old god just cocked his head slightly, staring at Castiel as though those green eyes could bore through vessels and stare straight into souls. \"Oh,\" he said. \"Oooh.\" Then he pulled two wine glasses out and reached under the bar for a bottle of what looked like liquid gold. \"What is that?\" Castiel asked. \"Fremented ambrosia,\" Dionysus answered as he poured it. \"Basically a liquor store in a glass, to be honest, but Zeus won't drink anything else.\" He corked the bottle again, picked up the glasses, and made his way around the bar. \"You know, in case you weren't smashed already.\" When Castiel reached for the glass, their fingers touched. Dionysus's were unnaturally warm. \"So who were they?\" he asked, sliding onto the bar stool beside him. \"These people you didn't exactly loose?\" Dionysus didn't ask that many more questions, but the silence that filled the bar was one of cavernous inquiry and not comfortable drinking, and Castiel found himself filling it in little spurts. He didn't say very much, but it was clearly enough for someone like Dionysus to put things together. \"You are drunk,\" Dionysus said finally. \"None of you godly buggers ever tell me that much.\" He rested his cheek on the heel of his palm and regarded Castiel for a moment. \"So the one that's still on earth, you leave in the grips of normality while you work out what's what for in Heaven?\" There didn't seem to be any good response to that. \"Yes,\" Castiel answered. \"Hmm.\" At some point, Dionysus had moved so close that the two sat elbow to elbow. Castiel couldn't find it in himself to object. Dionysus was solid, warm, real, even if he was a pagan god. \"But not because you particularly wanted to,\" the god added. He cupped his hand over Castiel's. \"What is right can outweigh what I want,\" Castiel said. \"So I've been told.\" Castiel sighed. He was tired. Not the sort of bone-deep exhaustion he had felt as he lost his grace; that was an exhaustion that would go away if he allowed himself to sleep. This was a kind of exhaustion that started in the angel and not in the vessel. He could barely believe it was over, and he was still almost expecting to have to either kill something or bring something else back to life. The anticipation was like a wire stretched too taught and ready to snap. As though he knew what Castiel was thinking, which was entirely possible, Dionysus edged a little bit closer, shoulder to shoulder now instead of simply elbow to elbow. \"Believing that doesn't make the world a simpler place.\" Castiel shook him off and lifted the ambrosia to his lips again. \"Nor should it.\" Dionysus chuckled at his sudden stiffness. \"Would your boyfriend object to me?\" he asked. \"Boyfriend?\" Castiel repeated. \"The older of the two mortals you spoke of,\" Dionysus explained. \"The one you nearly fell for. It was clear you were very much in love.\" \"Oh.\" Dean would, in fact, likely disapprove of Dionysus, but mostly as a blanket objection to pagan gods. \"We are not lovers.\" Dionysus gave him another sideways glance. \"Unrequited or because your father would disapprove?\" Castiel glared. \"That is an oversimplification of Scripture and you know it.\" \"I didn't mean two men. I meant the Watchers. Or was that an oversimplification, too?\" \"Oh.\" \"You don't know what's wrong or right, what's up or down, but I think you do know what you want.\" Castiel looked at his glass and considered whether or not to reach for the bottle again. It had been rather interesting. But he was distracted by a passing thought. \"People do not usually... care this much about a stranger's thoughts.\" \"I don't like unhappy people.\" Dionysus smiled slightly. \"I like uptight excuses even less.\" He put the glass down and leaned in a little. \"I'm the god of lightening or loosening up, of drunken confessions, of stopping worrying long enough to have a little fun. I like people, I like this world, and over the course of the night I've decided you're a good guy even if you're an egregiously dense one as well. So make yourself happy.\" He moved quickly, almost snakelike, and kissed Castiel against the jawline. Castiel stiffened a little, but it was a quick, chaste kiss, and then the god stood up. \"For luck,\" he said. \"Sometimes you have to get a little drunk to admit what you want.\"",

    "text": "\"Was this the face that launched a thousand ships,And burnt the topless towers of Ilium?Sweet Helen, make me immortal with a kiss:...Come, Helen, come, give me my soul again.Here will I dwell, for heaven be in these lips,And all is dross that is not Helena!\" --Christopher Marlowe, The Tragical History of Doctor Faustus She had the beauty of a goddess, did Helen of Sparta, but it was empty--hollow--like the gilding on a wooden chair long since decayed, only a shell. It was an inhuman beauty on a human woman; she lacked the substance to fill it, and it left her with as much animation as that fragile breath of gold. A goddess would have taken that face and form and made them desirable, or commanding, or both--she could have filled them, while Helen had her human limitations. She was her husband's prize but not his beloved, a shocking and beautiful possession. Aphrodite, filled with careless mischief that bled into malice, winged on by her triumph over Hera and Athena, knew this better perhaps than any mortal could, this daughter of the ocean foam or of Zeus, goddess of beauty and desire--she saw and understood that Helen, in possessing the one to such excess, could not inspire the other. And so she set that fire of want in Paris of Troy's heart and watched, knowing he would have his reward. No man had ever spoken of passion to Helen, and all that she knew of such words she had overheard, or learned from songs; the glory of being called beautiful in tones not of cool reason but burning emotion overwhelmed her entirely. Greece was a land where she had been a thing--in Troy, she had hoped, it would be different. It was not. In Troy she was a catalyst, a beginning, the cause for war and destruction, and as time passed and Aphrodite's magic faded from Paris he came to see Helen as others did. And she, blindly confused at first and then with anger that grew with comprehension, railed against the gods who had brought her to this--who had allowed her to be born as she was, with a beauty she could not be--who had used her, used her as harshly as humans ever had, as a thing. Paris was not what she had expected him to be--had thought he was--and her infatuation faded; but as the war continued, grinding all the men and joy of a generation down into the dust for the gods to trample, she fell in love. Hector brother of Paris, son of Priam, spoke to Helen as to any other human--showed her the real kindness he did to all of his people--laid no blame on her for the horrors she had brought to him. And that honest decency caught her and held her, and burned like fire in her veins. He was among the best of men, was Hector husband of Andromache, father of Astynax, beloved. Andromache gave herself up to grief and rage when Achilles killed him, but Helen fell into herself. When the walls of Troy were breached and the towers burned, fire leaping into the skies, the pyre of her dreams--when Troy fell, Helen went numbly, cold and frozen, back to Sparta. She had children there, and their love was in its way as true and pure as Hector's had been in his. That, finally, eased away the ice from all that burning. (Centuries later, Marlowe wrote of her as one like a goddess herself, with the power and the presence that her beauty had needed. She would have laughed to hear that, had she been able to cease her weeping at the words for long enough.) Now, here, in the afterworld, where all go in their times, and our appearances are shaped by our minds, here is Helen. That terrible dehumanizing Beauty is gone: hers is a lovely face, but not one to launch a fleet or burn a city. Here, at last, she finds peace.",

Not much to say about it, is there? But her lips are pink and her eyes are kind, and she doesn't look threatening. She was a princess, once. That's enticing to him, and that's why he leans into the kiss, he tells himself. Because kissing a princess beats kissing the daughter of an Earl. Because by kissing him, she makes him a prince.

The whole affair drags on like a reminder of Jason's slow but steady abandonment, the dinners at the palace that began three months ago, the way she has lain for a month untouched by his hands. Creusa is too young to be married yet - though Medea remembers such facts are never so fixed as one might assume, there is for the moment no danger to her house. Still, all the while she screams and screams to be delivered from her pain, her callous husband does not come. Not to see the birth of his second son. Not to see the death of his wife, all too imminent. There is blood on her thighs, hot and wet and flowing from her, but it's not enough to ease the baby's passage. She is dying, she knows she is, and though her body is enamelled with sweat her hands feel dry as bone. It feels wrong, that she should die like this. Grown men have lain in pieces beneath her hands, yet here she is being ripped apart by a mere infant? How can this... How? As Medea slips into unconsciousness, forcing the child's shoulders out into the world, she vows she will survive this, that she will never be this weak again. It is only when the vow is fully formed inside her that she allows her mind release. The nurse calls her a witch when she wakes up alive; Medea laughs it off, a smile on her face.",

    "text": "\"I've been having these dreams,\" she said, and because it was Erin, Dave just nodded and flipped open his phone. He almost texted Rob, \"Women, huh?\" Not that Rob would know. He felt a cold touch on his forearm. It was Erin's hand, and it felt like it had been dipped in ice. Startled, he flinched. \"Dave, listen to me.\" The cold touch faded, but his gaze didn't leave the cell phone. Erin snapped her fingers in his face. \"This is important!\" Dave stopped walking, looking up from his phone to meet her scowl. \"Oh, I'm the asshole?\" Exasperated, Erin threw up her hands and started to walk away. Dave shoved his phone in his pocket. \"Okay, Babe, okay! Tell me about these dreams of yours.\" She turned, opened her mouth to speak, but paused, shaking her head. \"Forget it. You'll think it's nothing.\" Dave brushed past her, annoyed. This was shaping up to end like every conversation they'd had the past week. The two had ended their on again/off again relationship after one too many fights, unsure there was any point in staying together. But they had reunited after one coffee, \"for old times sake,\" and \"one drink\" became \"one night.\" \"Alright, alright!\" she relented. \"The dreams are about you.\" Dave stopped walking again, turned, and gave Erin an appraising look. She appeared distraught, pale, and she had her arms wrapped tightly around herself. She looks chilled to the bone, he thought, remembering her touch before. He approached her and held his hand out. She took it. \"But, you're not you. In the dreams. I mean, you look like you, but...\" Dave frowned and squeezed her hand. \"I don't understand why you're so upset. Sounds like a typical dream.\" Erin looked almost...frightened, now, and he wished he hadn't said that. Concern for her washed over him, the emotion's strength catching him off guard. He wanted to keep her safe from what scared her. But if it was him she was scared of... The idea was ludicrous. Just last night Erin had acted just as she always had around him - dismissive and arrogant, like he was a movie she rented that she wouldn't give more than two stars. But the look on Erin's face as she started to recount her dream? All that confidence had drained out of her. \"We were on a battlefield, you and I. And we had swords. They were...\" She hesitated, swallowing. \"They were coated in...in dried blood.\" Dave put his other hand out and she silently took that too. \"And there were bodies. So many bodies...\" Erin looked like she was going to vomit. \"It was so real. I could smell it. The carnage was like nothing I'd ever seen. And I turned to you and...you weren't you. You were like a shadow. Sort of transparent. We found one living man in the mass of...of bodies, and he was just barely holding on, you know? He was begging, saying, 'No, please, no.' But I raised my sword, and...and I...\" Erin paused, shutting her eyes tight and leaning into Dave. After a deep breath, she opened her eyes and continued. \"I killed him. I ran him through. I watched as the blood spilled out of him and the life leave his eyes. And then I could hear this...laughter. This manic, shrieking cackle.\" Erin looked past Dave's shoulder, her eyes wide, as if she were watching it happen. He wanted nothing more than to banish that terrified look from her face forever. \"And it was me.\"",

    "text": "Cupid is good looking and well liked and cool enough that things that would make anyone else look lame just seem to heighten his popularity. Like the matchmaking thing. He hadn't meant to start doing it, but his mom ran one of those Internet dating sites and maybe he was just destined to follow in her footsteps. Megan in English had been moaning about not being asked to the Valentine's dance, and then Chris is Biology had said he really didn't know who to ask; Cupid had merely suggested they go together, and the next thing they're walking around school hand in hand and buying him lunch to say thanks. Soon it's a regular thing. He finds out pretty quickly that he has a natural talent for knowing just who fits with who, it's like he can just tell, and it's a strange gift to have, sure, but not everyone can be athletes or mathematicians or drama kids, and besides, he gets way more cookies than those guys. He likes to think he's making a difference. The free lunches don't hurt either. No, he has a pretty sweet gig going on; his grades are good, people are actually starting to pay for his help finding their 'soulmate', and he always has a date for parties. And then she shows up. He's running late for Gym when he turns a corner and literally runs right into her, and she's the most beautiful thing he's ever seen. He stands there dumbstruck for a moment before he realizes she's still on the ground and he's just gawking like an idiot. \"Sorry, sorry,\" he says, offering her his hand and helping her to her feet. \"Jupiter, I am such a klutz.\" \"It's fine,\" she says, and Tertius, even her voice is perfect, soft and low. \"I don't know you,\" he says, and then shakes his head. \"I mean, who are you? I mean, um...\" \"I'm new,\" she says, biting her bottom lip in amusement, and Cupid may be in love, just a little bit. \"I'm Psyche.\" \"Cupid,\" he tells her, offering a hand and wondering just when any semblance of cool he possessed flew out the window. She shakes it anyway. \"Well, Cupid, do you think you could tell me where Home Ec is? I am seriously lost.\" \"Yes, sure, absolutely,\" he says, and seriously, he swears he used to be less of a babbling mess. \"Up the stairs, first corridor to the left.\" \"Thanks,\" she says, slinging her bag over her shoulder. \"It was nice meeting you.\" \"Yes,\" he says. \"Right, you too.\" She disappears out of sight and he lets his head drop back against the wall with a painful thud. \"I am totally lame,\" he says to himself. The freshman kid walking out of the bathroom right then probably agrees. + \"How was school?\" his mom asks when he walks into the kitchen, dumping his stuff on the table. \"I fell in love,\" he sighs, and okay, so he's totally being overdramatic, but he's a teenager so it's allowed. \"Brilliant,\" Venus says, not looking up from the folders in front of her, all of them filled with charts and client details. \"Just make sure you're compatible.\" \"Of course,\" he says, and heads upstairs. \"Oh,\" Venus calls, \"your father called. He's got some extended leave coming up, wants to take you on an obstacle course or shooting or something. I don't know. You know what Mars is like. Make sure you call him back; I really do not want to speak to him any more than necessary. He messes up my chi.\" \"Will do,\" Cupid says, and then shuts himself in his room. Seriously, his family? So screwed up. + The next day at school everyone's talking about Psyche. Everywhere Cupid goes people are whispering about the new girl, guys with lust, girls with jealousy, and he has to stop himself interrupting several conversations to tell the speaker just where they can shove their opinions. He's sitting in History contemplating all the horrible ways he could dispose of Roger Peterson when Psyche sits down next to him. \"Cupid, hi,\" she says, and she doesn't seem to notice how the room hushes as everyone turns to stare at them. \"Hey Psyche,\" he says, ducking his head in embarrassment when he realizes he's blushing. \"Is it okay if I sit here?\" she asks. \"Only I don't actually know anyone else.\" \"It's fine,\" he says quickly, and the smile she gives him practically makes him melt. He spends the rest of the class gripping his pen tightly and staring straight ahead. Tertius this was getting ridiculous. + \"She's perfect,\" he tells his mom over dinner, \"and I'm a complete freak around her.\" \"Is she pretty?\" Venus asks, picking at her vegan salad like she's not just going to eat an entire tub of Ben and Jerry's later. \"She gorgeous. The most beautiful girl I've ever seen.\" Venus narrows her eyes and pouts, and Cupid has to stop himself rolling his eyes. His mother's obsession with her glory days as a much-adored supermodel can get a little scary at times; he wishes he could get her one of those mirrors, the sort from Snow White & the Seven Dwarfs. Of course, if it ever said anyone else's name, a woodsmen and a poison apple would be the least of their worries. \"Well,\" she says eventually. \"Then you should just ask her out. The one thing, the only thing, your father and I have in common is our stunning good looks and incredible intelligence. You're very blessed. She'd be crazy not to want you.\" Cupid blinks. \"How'd your date go last night?\" he asks. Venus scoffs. \"He ordered steak and talked about baseball for forty minutes. Men are such morons.\" + Eleven guys have asked Psyche out by the time Cupid gets to school Friday. She's said no to all of them. Cupid's feeling pretty damn good about it until he opens his locker and finds about fifty notes all asking for expertise in setting them up with their perfect date. And every one of them mentions said date by name. He gets a detention and a warning from the principle when he tries to burn them all in the trashcan outside the cafeteria. + \"She doesn't date,\" Fortuna says instead of a greeting, dropping into the seat next to him and ignoring their home room teacher as he babbles on about the next weekend's PTA fundraiser. \"Um,\" Cupid says, and Fortuna rolls her eyes. \"I'm trying to help you out here so listen up,\" she says, crossing her legs and sending Gaius Augustus a look of pure ice when he stares at them for too long. \"The very lovely Psyche does not date. Not because she doesn't want to, but because she has two horrid sisters who make her feel like every decision she ever makes is wrong. Very Cinderella without all the creepy singing mice. Besides, she's beautiful, and if there's one thing boys have absolutely no idea how to handle, it's a beautiful woman. So, she doesn't date, but that doesn't mean she won't. Not if the right person asks her.\" She leans closer, and Cupid likes Fortuna, he really does, but she's still kind of really freaking terrifying sometimes. \"That's all I can tell you,\" she says. \"Fate is now in your hands.\" \"That sound ominous,\" Cupid says, frowning. \"Does it? Good. I'm trying it out. I feel like I need a catchphrase.\" She leans back in her chair, pulls a coin from her purse and begins flipping it in the air. Cupid's a little nervous to notice it always lands on heads. + He finds her outside the smoothie place alone and reading In the Grip of the Minotaur, and sends Fortuna a silent 'thank you' for this one last bit of advice. \"Hi,\" he says, shoving his hands in his pockets when his finger won't stop twitching. She looks up, blinks, and then smiles, bright and earnest. \"Hey! Want to sit down?\" \"Yeah,\" he says, \"thanks. I'm not interrupting you from your book am I?\" \"No,\" she says, marking the page with a receipt and putting it in her bag. \"Not at all. I always find that the Greeks should be read in small doses anyway.\" \"Absolutely. Of course I may just be holding a grudge after that one entire summer my mom made everyone call her Aphrodite.\" Psyche laughs, her head tipping back, and it's open and honest and Cupid's fixated. \"Go out with me,\" he says before he knows what he's doing, and Psyche freezes, her eyes widening, and he honestly thinks she's going to say no when she leans forwards and bites her lip. \"Okay,\" she says eventually, and it takes him a moment to realize that it's not a rejection. \"Really?\" She smiles then, and it's small and unsure and not like her other smiles at all, but Cupid likes it all the same. \"Yes, really,\" she says. + \"You're awfully cheery,\" Venus says from where she's eyeing up five different pairs of shoes and testing them up against what seems to be a new Prada dress. \"I have a date,\" Cupid says, smiling. Venus gives him a mildly annoyed look. \"You realize you practically just sang that, right?\" \"Not looking forward to your date tonight?\" Cupid says in response and watches his mom's eyes narrow further. \"It is not a date,\" she says, \"I am merely meeting your father for drinks to discuss his alimony payments. And how they need to be increased.\" \"Mom, I turn eighteen in three months,\" Cupid points out. \"And that is why it needs to be upped now,\" she says with a smirk. It's kind of disturbing how his parents attempt to screw each other over at every opportunity, but it would be much easier to take if he didn't know these meetings always ended up with them checking into a hotel suite, too. He is going to need so much therapy one day. \"Wear the grey shirt,\" Venus says, turning back to her task. \"It makes your eyes sparkle.\" \"Tell Dad I said hi.\" + He's booked a table at a restaurant in town, nice but not intimidating and with a wide enough menu that she should be able to find anything to eat. He's even phoned to confirm. Twice. As luck would have it, he gets stuck in traffic and doesn't have her number to let her know he's running late. His phone does buzz but it's just a text from Fortuna telling him it's always wise to check the traffic reports, and if that doesn't highlight exactly why he finds her creepy then nothing does. He gets to the restaurant fifteen minutes late, abandoning his car in the first empty space he sees and hoping like hell Psyche hasn't left. She hasn't. She's wearing a pale blue dress and her hair is curling around her shoulders in the breeze and every man around is watching her in awe. \"Hi,\" Cupid says, running over, \"I am so sorry. I got stuck in traffic.\" She exhales deeply and then smiles, and he can see the way her shoulders relax, realizes he's not the only one that's nervous and doesn't know what to do with that. \"My sisters,\" she says, and she sounds relieved and happy. \"They said you'd probably stand me up.\" \"Why would I do that?\" he says and she shrugs. Fortuna hadn't been exaggerating when she'd said Psyche's sisters made her insecure, and Cupid hates them then, hates that their jealousy could have such an effect on someone so lovely. He reaches out and takes her hand, links his fingers through hers and opens the restaurant door. \"Shall we?\" \"Yes,\" she says. \"Also, do you know why I received a text from Fortuna about the weather?\" \"No idea,\" he says, making a mental note to grab his umbrella from the trunk of his car as soon as they leave. + \"So,\" Fortuna says from where she's leaning up against his locker, \"how'd it go?\" \"It was perfect,\" Cupid says, and he knows he's grinning like an idiot but he doesn't really care. \"All that matchmaking and now you've finally found someone of your very own,\" she says with a dramatic sigh, and Cupid laughs. \"Jealous?\" \"Please,\" she scoffs, \"I do alright for myself.\" \"Thanks for the tip about the rain by the way,\" he says as he takes his books from his locker and puts them in his bag. \"I have no idea what you're talking about,\" she says, and then nods down the hallway. \"Here comes your lady love. Also, you owe me.\" \"Later.\" \"Was that Fortuna?\" Psyche says as she joins him, and Cupid kind of love how she really doesn't notice the way everyone looks at her. \"Yeah, she says hi.\" Psyche smiles and then grabs the remaining books from his hands. \"Walk you to class?\" she says, and Cupid laughs, takes her hand and pulls her closer, kissing her gently. \"Absolutely.\"",

      "Not because she doesn't want to, but because she has two horrid sisters who make her feel like every decision she ever makes is wrong.",
      "Very Cinderella without all the creepy singing mice.",
      "Besides, she's beautiful, and if there's one thing boys have absolutely no idea how to handle, it's a beautiful woman.",
      "So, she doesn't date, but that doesn't mean she won't.",
      "Not if the right person asks her.\"",
      "She leans closer, and Cupid likes Fortuna, he really does, but she's still kind of really freaking terrifying sometimes.",
      "\"That's all I can tell you,\" she says.",
      "\"Fate is now in your hands.\"",
      "\"That sound ominous,\" Cupid says, frowning.",
      "\"Does it?",
      "Good.",
      "I'm trying it out.",
      "I feel like I need a catchphrase.\"",
      "She leans back in her chair, pulls a coin from her purse and begins flipping it in the air.",
      "Cupid's a little nervous to notice it always lands on heads.",
      "+ He finds her outside the smoothie place alone and reading In the Grip of the Minotaur, and sends Fortuna a silent 'thank you' for this one last bit of advice.",
      "\"Hi,\" he says, shoving his hands in his pockets when his finger won't stop twitching.",
      "She looks up, blinks, and then smiles, bright and earnest.",
      "\"Hey!",
      "Want to sit down?\"",
      "\"Yeah,\" he says, \"thanks.",
      "I'm not interrupting you from your book am I?\"",
      "\"No,\" she says, marking the page with a receipt and putting it in her bag.",
      "\"Not at all.",
      "I always find that the Greeks should be read in small doses anyway.\"",
      "\"Absolutely.",
      "Of course I may just be holding a grudge after that one entire summer my mom made everyone call her Aphrodite.\"",
      "Psyche laughs, her head tipping back, and it's open and honest and Cupid's fixated.",
      "\"Go out with me,\" he says before he knows what he's doing, and Psyche freezes, her eyes widening, and he honestly thinks she's going to say no when she leans forwards and bites her lip.",
      "\"Okay,\" she says eventually, and it takes him a moment to realize that it's not a rejection.",
      "\"Really?\"",
      "She smiles then, and it's small and unsure and not like her other smiles at all, but Cupid likes it all the same.",
      "\"Yes, really,\" she says.",
      "+ \"You're awfully cheery,\" Venus says from where she's eyeing up five different pairs of shoes and testing them up against what seems to be a new Prada dress.",
      "\"I have a date,\" Cupid says, smiling.",
      "Venus gives him a mildly annoyed look.",
      "\"You realize you practically just sang that, right?\"",
      "\"Not looking forward to your date tonight?\" Cupid says in response and watches his mom's eyes narrow further.",
      "\"It is not a date,\" she says, \"I am merely meeting your father for drinks to discuss his alimony payments.",
      "And how they need to be increased.\"",
      "\"Mom, I turn eighteen in three months,\" Cupid points out.",
      "\"And that is why it needs to be upped now,\" she says with a smirk.",
      "It's kind of disturbing how his parents attempt to screw each other over at every opportunity, but it would be much easier to take if he didn't know these meetings always ended up with them checking into a hotel suite, too.",
      "He is going to need so much therapy one day.",
      "\"Wear the grey shirt,\" Venus says, turning back to her task.",
      "\"It makes your eyes sparkle.\"",
      "\"Tell Dad I said hi.\"",
      "+ He's booked a table at a restaurant in town, nice but not intimidating and with a wide enough menu that she should be able to find anything to eat.",
      "He's even phoned to confirm.",
      "Twice.",
      "As luck would have it, he gets stuck in traffic and doesn't have her number to let her know he's running late.",
      "His phone does buzz but it's just a text from Fortuna telling him it's always wise to check the traffic reports, and if that doesn't highlight exactly why he finds her creepy then nothing does.",
      "He gets to the restaurant fifteen minutes late, abandoning his car in the first empty space he sees and hoping like hell Psyche hasn't left.",
      "She hasn't.",
      "She's wearing a pale blue dress and her hair is curling around her shoulders in the breeze and every man around is watching her in awe.",
      "\"Hi,\" Cupid says, running over, \"I am so sorry.",
      "I got stuck in traffic.\"",
      "She exhales deeply and then smiles, and he can see the way her shoulders relax, realizes he's not the only one that's nervous and doesn't know what to do with that.",
      "\"My sisters,\" she says, and she sounds relieved and happy.",
      "\"They said you'd probably stand me up.\"",
      "\"Why would I do that?\" he says and she shrugs.",
      "Fortuna hadn't been exaggerating when she'd said Psyche's sisters made her insecure, and Cupid hates them then, hates that their jealousy could have such an effect on someone so lovely.",
      "He reaches out and takes her hand, links his fingers through hers and opens the restaurant door.",
      "\"Shall we?\"",
      "\"Yes,\" she says.",
      "\"Also, do you know why I received a text from Fortuna about the weather?\"",
      "\"No idea,\" he says, making a mental note to grab his umbrella from the trunk of his car as soon as they leave.",
      "+ \"So,\" Fortuna says from where she's leaning up against his locker, \"how'd it go?\"",
      "\"It was perfect,\" Cupid says, and he knows he's grinning like an idiot but he doesn't really care.",
      "\"All that matchmaking and now you've finally found someone of your very own,\" she says with a dramatic sigh, and Cupid laughs.",
      "\"Jealous?\"",
      "\"Please,\" she scoffs, \"I do alright for myself.\"",
      "\"Thanks for the tip about the rain by the way,\" he says as he takes his books from his locker and puts them in his bag.",
      "\"I have no idea what you're talking about,\" she says, and then nods down the hallway.",
      "\"Here comes your lady love.",
      "Also, you owe me.\"",
      "\"Later.\"",
      "\"Was that Fortuna?\" Psyche says as she joins him, and Cupid kind of love how she really doesn't notice the way everyone looks at her.",
      "\"Yeah, she says hi.\"",
      "Psyche smiles and then grabs the remaining books from his hands.",
      "\"Walk you to class?\" she says, and Cupid laughs, takes her hand and pulls her closer, kissing her gently.",
      "\"Absolutely.\""

    "text": "\"Even-handed One, Great Leveler, Final Judge, we beseech you. Dark Lord, Night Lord, Wealthy One, we call on you for assistance.\" A breeze scudded around Kastagir, riffling his coat ends, and scudded past Darius, where it picked up the tang of strong alcohol. \"Lord of the Underworld, Lord of the Dead, All-Mastering Hades, come forth, we ask, and hear our bargain, that you may add to your wealth in your own time.\" Darius watched the storm gathering to the west and said quietly, \"Sunda.\" Kastagir nodded and drew a knife, holding it between the two of them. Darius twined one hand over his on the hilt and placed the palm of his free hand against the blade. Sunda mirrored him and they drew the knife down in a smooth motion that left blood falling from both hands. Red drops hit the too-dry earth in soft plops of moisture on near-dust; by the time their hands had healed with shimmering sparks, the wind had died away. The night fell silent, too: no dog-fox barked, no owl cried, not so much as a twitter of songbirds chirping sleepily about 'is it morning yet?' \"A bargain, you said,\" Someone breathed and Kastagir felt goose bumps rise on his skin and his nape prickle. \"And why should I bargain for that which will be mine soon or late?\" Darius bowed to the shadows and said, \"It is not the shortest of tales, Lord. We have metheglyn, or retsina, or boom-boom, if you'd like?\" It was a rusty chuckle out of the night, but a laugh nonetheless. \"Boom-boom. And yes, Kastagir, stir up your fire. I am intrigued.\" Kastagir grinned. \"This isn't the sort of stuff that usually sends people to you; I have more pride than that, thanks. But you may like this one. I've been aging it in oak.\" He poked the fire into shedding a little more light and tugged a rock over to make a seat for himself. Darius filled a cup with boom-boom, closed the tap, and placed the cup beside the folding chair covered with a spare blanket they'd left empty for the god. He appeared in it as Darius said simply, \"Another attack comes through this pass soon, Lord. Maybe in the morning, maybe tomorrow night, but no later than that. If they're held off even another two days, the business of driving them back out can begin. If they make it through... it may be years, or longer, before these invaders can be sent out of your lands.\" The cup in Hades' hand gleamed gold in the firelight where it had been pale wood before. \"And when the attack begins, more souls will become mine,\" Hades said quietly. \"They all come to me in the end.\" \"They don't all believe in you, Lord,\" Kastagir pointed out bluntly. \"There are those who do, at the kind of level not even their church can overwrite, but if this army isn't opposed there'll be a damn sight fewer of them by the new moon.\" Hades raised the cup slightly, acknowledging that point. Despite the light from the fire, shadows pooled around his feet and legs; they made it difficult to see his face. Kastagir suspected it was a kindness to them, or maybe he just hated seeing immortals come and go from his lands. \"What do you want, and what do you offer?\" Darius said quietly, \"Once, you let Sisyphus go back to see his death rites properly carried out. His punishment for trying to evade his return is legend still, my Lord. We are not such fools. Both Kastagir and I know the rites to send souls back to you. Will you lend us ghosts to hold this pass for their distant descendants? As soon as their descendants arrive to hold the pass, we will send them back to you.\" Hades drank more of the boom-boom and waited, silence mounding around in ever-thickening layers, to see if there was more. When neither Darius nor Kastagir broke the night, he chuckled again, a sound like dirt pattering into a grave, and asked, \"Why should I? They are already mine. You will eventually be mine. Those who come here will, one day, also be mine. What can you offer me that I do not already have?\" Kastagir shrugged. \"We brought gifts, Lord, certainly. Rude not to, and no one sane is rude to you. Metals taken from your realms that once sent you souls, a gem or three taken from deep in the earth, more of the wine and boom-boom to take back for your court since it can't be made there.\" \"Other than that,\" Darius went on calmly, \"we may only ask. We know that all things are, eventually, yours. But there are fewer and fewer who believe in you; we ask that we may continue to help you in your followers' realm.\" \"And then,\" Kastagir said reasonably, \"in some ways, we're all worshipers of you and your lady.\" Thunder rumbled far off as Hades leaned forward and tipped his cup over to sit upside down and empty beside the embers. \"Explain yourselves.\" \"Who is more aware of life and death than we?\" Darius asked. \"We who have lived long enough to see how death comes, and life comes, and death again.\" Kastagir added, \"We who send so many to you, either wrapping them for the grave or sticking metal through them to send them there?\" \"And who is more aware of rebirth, both our own and the world's, than we?\" Darius asked seriously. \"Your lady is well served by us.\" Small flames danced over the embers, reflected in the dark of Hades' eyes; eventually, the shifting light indicated that he nodded. \"As am I. You once sent me thousands, Darius.\" \"In another life,\" Darius agreed, and added, pained, \"Some of those I trained still do.\" Kastagir leaned back and drank more of his boom-boom. \"And now he preaches rebirths to his flock.\" \"You,\" Hades murmured to Kastagir, low and slow as a late night pulse, \"have sent no small number to me, Sunda Kastagir, and returned no few who were called away unlawfully.\" Kastagir just nodded. \"So I have. I don't hold with calling the dead up for small things, Lord.\" \"Meaning that you do not see this as a small thing and I should agree?\" Hades asked them. But his words held no edge to cut them, dripped no venom to poison them. \"Agreement is yours to give or withhold,\" Darius said, hands turned up empty on his habit. \"And the gifts are yours regardless, Lord. We're grateful you've come and heard our request.\" \"That said,\" Kastagir rumbled, \"if we didn't think it was a fair bargain for both sides, we'd have been fools to call you up to hear it. We try not to be fools, and certainly not to or around gods.\" \"Being in no hurry to join me in my realms?\" Hades finished, amused now. \"So you offer me your gifts, the blood you have shed and likely will shed again here, the souls of my people's enemies, and the hope of more living souls who will remember and respect me.\" Darius nodded. \"Yes. And we ask it as those who bring the Even-Handed One a bargain good for both sides, and as ones who know you of old and respect you and your lady.\" Kastagir grinned. \"And if there's a wine or beer she prefers, I'll make her a batch when this blasted war is over and a man can get makings again.\" The night folded in over them again while Hades considered it, silent as a dead cave and dark as a grave. \"She was always fond of apple wine,\" Hades said at last, mild as spring frost after the winter. He picked up his cup, solid gold now in his hand and gracefully curved as a collarbone, refilled it with the metheglyn and sipped the brew contemplatively. \"Although these, too, have been fair. Very well. Bring forth your map and I will call my shades to the places you request. In return, I charge you both to give these gifts of yours into the nearest sinkhole you may find -- I do not underestimate the trouble of travel in these days, else I would have you bring them to my river in the southwest -- and to walk these lands in three nights and send back to my realm any shade fool enough to remain.\" Darius nodded. \"More than fair, Lord. Thank you.\" Kastagir brought the maps out and said simply, \"Thank you. We'll keep doing what we can for your people.\" Hades smiled, slow and cold as the grave. \"Yes. I know you will.\" And he leaned forward to take a more personal hand than usual in gathering possessions to his realms. Notes, Comments, Commentary: I think this is in Greece during WWII, but you never know with Sunda and Darius.... Metheglyn can be another name for mead, or it can be made with honey locust sap instead of honey.",

    "text": "The Book of Chaos 2: 1. The world was yet formless, but it was beginning to take form. 2. From the void emerged the twin serpents of time, Chronos and Ananke. 3. Chronos wrapped himself around the primordial world, latching onto his own tail with his mouth in order to hold himself in place against the shifting cosmos. 4. Ananke, however, darted to and fro, inside and outside, helping to shape and birth Gaia from within the stability of Chronos. 5. As Gaia took shape, Uranus, the sky, formed over her in order to cover and protect the earth from the void. 3: 1. Gaia was lifeless rock, still asleep. 2. Nyx and Erebus came together, and gave birth to Aether, the air. 3. And the winds swirled beneath the sky, and cut mountains and valleys over the volcanic earth. 4. Again Nyx and Erebus came together, and birthed Hemera, the day. 5. For the first time, there was light upon the world, and warmth from above, and the living rock slowly began to stir. 6. From Aether and Hemera was born Thalassa, the goddess of the sea, spreading out and cooling the bubbling lava. 7. Gaia awakened, and embraced Uranus, her perpetual mate. 8. From Gaia and Uranus came Pontus, the god of the sea, and Tethys, the goddess of the rivers and lakes. 9. And the rivers flowed down from the mountains and met the seas, and the rains fell upon the earth, and the world began to live. 4: 1. And Gaia gave birth to Hyperion. And Hyperion was not a man, but he was the father of all men. 2. And Gaia gave birth to Theia. And Theia was not a woman, but she was the mother of all women. 3. And Hyperion and Theia begat Helios, the sun, the light of the day. 4. And the light of the newborn sun rained brightly over the young earth. 5. And Hyperion and Theia begat Selene, the moon, silver to complement Helios's gold. 6. And the light of the moon shone gently over the young earth. 7. And Hyperion and Theia begat Eos, the dawn, the bringer of the day. 8. And the birth of their daughter, Eos, heralded a coming transition. The world was about to change. 5: 1. And so it came to pass that Gaia gave birth to Iapetus, the god of life. 2. First it was the seas which began to stir with life, tiny things at first which could not be seen with one's eyes. 3. But life bloomed and it blossomed, and as the eons turned, it grew and flourished. 4. The grasses in the seas spread out across the lands, growing into vast, untouched primeval forests. 5. The solemn, ancient trees sent their roots into the mother earth and reached their leafy fingers unto the father sky. 6. And Pontus and Thalassa begat Proteus, the god of change. 7. And there were fishes of many kinds swimming in the seas, and for a time, life was a wild cacophony of infinite variation, ever-changing. 8. Insects spread across the land, blooming flowers following in their wake, bringing with them the coming of change across the world. 9. And there were animals, of many kinds, beasts strange and wonderful, the likes of which the world would never see again. 10. Out of the primordial mists of the prehistoric world, the dragons were born, slithering out of their eggs and taking to wing on the warm winds of the young earth. The Book of Dragons 2: 1. And then, out of the Chaos and onto the ever-changing world, Themis was born. 2. And Themis was the goddess of natural law. She brought order out of chaos, and she formed patterns where there was only confusion before. 3. And from Iapetus and Themis, life and order, Prometheus was born. 4. And Prometheus came upon the younger children of Hyperion and Theia, and saw that they were not gods, nor beasts, nor dragons, but something entirely new. 5. They were men, and they were women, and though they seemed weak and frail beside the mighty beasts, they were far more clever and cunning. 6. They were adaptable and capable of doing many things with their hands, and Prometheus saw in them this untapped potential. 7. The dragons have holed themselves up in their lairs, Prometheus said to himself. They have done little for eons but terrorized the weaker beasts. 8. Perhaps in these new beings there is potential for ones who can finally challenge the reign of the dragons. 9. And so, Prometheus took the young humans under his wing, and hid them away so that the dragons might not find them and devour them. 10. Prometheus guided them and taught them, bringing out their potential and giving them many gifts of knowledge formerly reserved for the gods. 11. They learned to make fire, not with their thoughts or breath but with their hands. And they learned to build. 12. And when the humans began to build vast and mighty cities, Prometheus could hide them from the dragons no longer. 3: 1. The dragons saw what the humans had done, and what they had build, and they were angry, and jealous. 2. How dare these upstart, fragile apes usurp what should be rightfully theirs? 3. The dragons came upon Babylon, the first great city of the humans. It was a shining gem of artifice, masterfully constructed of wood and stone. 4. The dragons surrounded Babylon, and burned it with their fiery breath, and crushed it with their claws, and ground its ruins beneath their scales. 5. But the humans were undeterred. They rebuilt Babylon, and it was twice as glorious and twice as beautiful as it had been before. 6. Metis had given them thought, and Morpheus had brought them dreams, and the humans were determined not to squander these gifts. 7. They offered sacrifice to Nyx, asking for her blessing. And the goddess of the night stretched out her hand and blanketed them in comforting shadow. 8. They offered sacrifice to Hypnos, asking for his blessing. And the god of sleep let the dragons drift away in slumber for a time. 9. And under the cover of the night, humans crept into the lairs of the dragons and stole away their most priceless treasures while the dragons slept. 10. Many dragons died in their sleep as the humans took vengeance upon that which had been destroyed at Babylon. 4: 1. Marduk, the most powerful of the surviving dragons, awoke from his slumber, and he was enraged. 2. And he gathered his brethren together, and once again the dragons made war upon men. 3. But men had gained much while the dragons had slept. Their blades could pierce dragonhide, and they had learned to wield magic with far more alacrity than the dragons ever had. 4. The dragons were beaten back that day, and much blood was shed upon the earth, blood of dragons and blood of men. 5. Marduk was shamed, and angered, but he knew that he would not win this day. 6. Marduk withdrew his brethren from the field, and for a time men had peace once again. 7. Marduk went to speak with Tiamat, the mother of the dragons, about the human scourge. 8. They build and steal, Marduk said to her, and they slay our hatchlings in their sleep. We must destroy them all, or all is lost. 9. But Tiamat was unphased, and merely shook her head, and said, We will not bring down these creatures through war. 10. They are small and quick, and there are many more of them than there are of us. They live and die in the span of decades, while our kind take an age to mature. 11. Let us turn them away from the gods. Let them worship us, instead, as is our due. Then we shall have their power as well. 5: 1. And so Marduk returned to Babylon. 2. He transformed himself into the shape of a man, and walked amongst the people unnoticed for what he truly was. 3. And Marduk showed to the people of Babylon images of dragons, graceful and beautiful, and he bid them to worship them. 4. But the humans were hesitant at first. They still remembered the destruction of Babylon. 5. But Marduk had the patience of dragons. Generations passed, as he slowly warped and corrupted the hearts of men. 6. And men made for themselves images of dragons, wrought in gold or carved in crystal. And men began to worship dragons rather than the true gods. 7. And the gods cast their gaze down upon the city of Babylon, and they saw men bowing down before the crystal dragon, and they were displeased. 8. And so the gods sent Eris down unto the world to sow strife amongst the human peoples. 9. And men fought with men, and nations were sundered and their tongues confused. 10. And so the city of Babylon was destroyed a second time, but this time it was by men. The Book of Themis 2: 1. Thou shalt not murder. 2. It is forbidden to you to slay another being with malicious intent. 3. You may slay a living being out of immediate defense for your life or the life of another. 4. You may slay a living being in just retribution for crimes against another, but never against yourself. 5. For true justice is without bias or malice, and truth is blind and yet sees all. 6. Murderers will find themselves cast into Erebus upon death, where they will spend ten eons of suffering to atone for their crime, reliving the pain which they caused again and again. 3: 1. Thou shalt not steal. 2. It is forbidden to you to take unto yourself that which rightfully belongs to another. 3. Thieves will find themselves cast into Erebus upon death, where they will have nothing, and spend an eon in the darkness to atone for their crime. 4. To atone for this crime in life, you must return that which was stolen if possible, or if not, to make fair restitution to the one from whom you stole. 4: 1. Thou shalt not rape. 2. It is forbidden to you to violate the personal sanctity of a woman who is not your own. 3. The wives of other men are forbidden to you to touch. 4. Neither shall you violate an unmarried daughter. You must take her to wife in marriage before she is your own. 5. Neither shall you violate another man in such a way as you would a woman. 6. If a man seeks to live as a woman, he must be taken by another man as a wife, and married before the eyes of the gods, even as he would a woman. 7. Neither shall you take for wife your sibling, nor your parent, nor your child, nor any siblings, parents, or children of any of these. 8. Only those to whom you do not share an immediate tie of blood may be taken as wife. 9. Adulterers will find themselves cast into Erebus upon death, where they will know only darkness and see never the face of Eros, and spend an eon alone to atone for their crime. 5: 1. Thou shalt not make for thyself a crystal dragon. 2. It is forbidden to you to turn your face upon the gods, and to give instead your worship to other beings. 3. You shall not make an image or figure to worship of any dragon or animal or man or beast that walks or slithers upon the earth, or swims within the sea, or flies within the air. 4. You shall keep sacred the gods, and offer sacrifices only to the gods. 5. Idolaters will find themselves cast into Erebus upon death, where the face of all the gods shall be turned from them, and they shall be alone in the darkness for a thousand eons. 6. To atone for this crime in life, you must destroy your idols and make sacrifice to the gods in repentence. 6: 1. Thou shalt not violate a sacred place. 2. It is forbidden to you to profane a temple, or fane, or sanctuary, or caern. 3. The gods shall turn their backs upon he who defiles a sacred place, and he shall know not succor nor comfort in their arms. 4. Defilers will find themselves cast into Erebus upon death, where the face of all the gods shall be turned from them, and they shall be alone in the darkness for a thousand eons. 5. To atone for this crime in life, you must restore the sanctity of the place which you had previously violated, and make sacrifice to the gods in repentence. 7: 1. Then Themis turned her gaze to the dragons, for she knew that they were not innocent. 2. Do not think that I believe you blameless in all things, she told them. 3. You are more than beasts, but less than gods, but your might and power make you a danger to men and beasts and gods alike. 4. Marduk, for your crimes against men and gods, I hereby cast you into Tartarus to be imprisoned for a thousand eons. 5. And mighty Marduk roared and wailed as he was cast into the pit. 8: 1. And Themis turned her gaze to those among the humans who wielded the power of magic. 2. You mages, she said. You wield power above and beyond the capabilities of ordinary men. 3. You are as powerful as your wit and skill can make you, and you can challenge the might of the dragons, yea even the might of the gods themselves. 4. Should you violate the laws of heaven, it shall not be to Erebus that your souls be sent, but to Tartarus, to be imprisoned so that you may not threaten anyone else. 5. The same onus that applies to any dragon or magical beast applies to you. 9: 1. Thou shalt not raise the dead. 2. It is forbidden to you to return to life any being which has passed beyond the veil. 3. You shall not disturb the peace and happiness of the souls within Elysium, neither shall you prematurely end the punishment of the souls within Erebus or Tartarus. 4. The fate of souls is for the gods alone to decide, and no man nor beast shall interfere with it. 5. Necromancers will find themselves cast into Tartarus upon death, to be imprisoned for a hundred eons. 10: 1. Thou shalt not manipulate time. 2. It is forbidden to you to traverse time to return to that which has already occurred in order to alter the course of events. 3. Each thing must happen in its appointed time, and not one hour sooner nor later. 4. You may not utter prophecies of what may come, for the future is to be known only to the gods. 5. You may not artificially extend your lifespan beyond the count of years granted to you. 6. Chronomancers will find themselves cast into Tartarus upon death, to be imprisoned for all of eternity. 11: 1. Thou shalt not violate the minds of others. 2. It is forbidden to you to trespass upon the thoughts of another being in order to bend their will to your own. 3. The free will of man is a gift of the gods, and only the gods may see fit to withhold it. 4. Neither may you alter the memories of another being in order to trick them into following your will. 5. Controllers will find themselves cast into Tartarus upon death, to be imprisoned for fifty eons. 6. To atone for this crime in life, you must subvert your will to that of the person whose will you violated, and become their slave for a period of their choosing.",

    "text": "He kept telling himself that he had good reasons for following Prince Ganymede - that it was his job to protect him, and he couldn't protect him if he wasn't in sight. That's what he told himself.But there just might be a slight difference between tailing him on a hunting expedition in the mountains - where the trees were full of wolves and boars and all sorts of potentially dangerous animals - and folding himself into the servant's corridors under the balcony wall, with the small windows overlooking the library. They were not only within the walls of Dardania - and Zeus had to admit that it was an exceptionally peaceful city, and shot a dirty look towards Apollo's temple - but they were inside the castle walls, not three corridors away from Ganymede's own room.So he tried to tell himself that he was only doing his duty, but it even sounded hollow to his own ears.The real reason - and Zeus finally decided he was man enough to admit it, if only to himself - that he was watching him so closely is because he was with his new tutor. Ilarus. His lip curled just to even think the name, and he forced a tight clamp on his power. There had been too many thunderstorms in Troas, and Zeus hadn't cared, until Ganymede had sighed that it would be a very bad year for crops, and - Demeter was going to kill him.The thunderstorms stopped then, for the most part, but the damage was done. Zeus resigned himself to hiding in his mortal form for a great deal of time longer, and doing the best he could to help.But Ilarus made him rethink everything about the dubious detriments of calling up another storm. He was tall and handsome, dark-haired, intelligent, and he told stories of the world beyond Troy's walls - stories that lit a fire behind Ganymede's eyes, and another, utterly different one in the black depths of Zeus's heart. He wasn't allowed to put that look there. He wasn't allowed to make eyes at the prince, to smile at him, to let him know in all the unsubtle and cunning ways that he wanted him.And Ganymede wasn't allowed to want him back.+ the evening previous +Ganymede slowly worked the comb through his hair, picking out each individual knot, giving it the same loving care and attention that many women reserved only for their children. But then, he was quite fond of his hair, and the blood was humming in his veins and he absolutely had to look perfect tomorrow. Everything had to be perfect.His hands were trembling and they caught on a difficult snarl - he gasped as the motion tugged painfully at his scalp, but he couldn't sort himself out enough to slow down. Then, there was a gentle pressure on his wrists - gentle, but strong, and Ganymede sighed back into the touch. Idaios.\"Yes, my lord?\"He hadn't realized he'd spoken aloud and his cheeks flushed, embarrassed. \"I- thank you.\" He'd only been his manservant for three months - or was it four now? - but Ganymede had never known anyone so able to understand exactly what he needed, when he needed it, and when he'd rather be left alone. So he swallowed his nerves and pride, and let his servant work the smooth shell comb from his nervous fingers, and closed his eyes.When fingertips pressed at his scalp in quiet, soothing circles, he felt the words bubble up in his throat, and no power in the world could keep them leashed, not when Idaios was making him limp as a dishrag and equally thoughtful.\"...Ilarus walked us through the temple district today. He's been to the temple of Zeus at Knossos, did you know?\" There was a slight coughing sound from behind him, but he paid it no heed. \"Imagine, seeing the very hills that the great god was born on.\"\"I'm sure they're just like any hills,\" Idaios muttered gruffly.\"Well physically, maybe. But it's the principle of the thing, the history behind it, knowing what has happened. You're very good at this, you know,\" he added, tilting his head back to peer up at his gray-eyed servant.\"My lord has very fine hair.\"Ganymede wasn't sure if he meant fine, as in quality, or fine as in - but it really didn't matter, did it, not when those hands felt so nice. \"Mmmm. I'm going to leave it down tomorrow. Ilar's eyes kept jumping when it caught the sun- ow,\" he muttered, at a sudden tug.\"Sorry,\" the servant said hastily.\"No, it's fine. 'Dora would say that beauty is pain,\" and he put on a perfect imitation of the fluttering velvet tones of his brother's sweetheart. Idaios chuckled behind him, and he could very nearly feel the vibrations, all along the back of his neck. \"You're wonderful. I do worse on a daily basis.\" A quiet settled between them for a long moment, as Ganymede slowly lost the thread of his thought in the prickling motions of his hair moving. He could almost feel every strand, every connection - weaving and unweaving, and parting for his servant's strong hands.\"He wants to meet in the library tomorrow,\" Ganymede whispered, and Idaios went still, and quiet. He pressed back into the hands a little, impatient, but maybe also because he was nervous and Idaios was slowly growing to be the only thing that made him feel safe. \"I know what he wants, and I'm not averse, I'm just...\"A breathy sigh, and then those beautiful fingers were on his scalp again, in a rolling caress that was surely not intended to be anywhere near as sensual as it felt. Ganymede melted utterly into it, nearly purring in the back of his throat. \"Do not let him do anything you object to,\" was all he said, and Ganymede couldn't think, he was all liquid and unraveled.But he nodded, slowly, as the words filtered in and arranged themselves into a semblance of order. \"Of course not.\" He was a prince, and he knew his rights. It was just -He wanted Ilarus to have good intentions. He wanted to think the best of him. He didn't want to believe that something as stupid as lust could tip the balance of their utterly satisfying intellectual relationship.But he wanted, oh he wanted. Idaios and his perfect hands only made it worse, but Ganymede couldn't bring himself to tell him to stop.+ the library +He did know that Ilarus had been to the Temple at Knossos, and no, it didn't make it any better knowing he'd been perfectly courteous.Zeus pressed his nose to the slit of a window and watched, as the scene unfurled itself between the scroll stacks. The Prince of Troy, wrapped in royal blue with his hair spilling past his shoulders, untrapped, on this day of days - and Ilarus, with his dark eyes and gold rings that he claimed were gifts from faraway kings, for the services of knowledge he'd done for them.Zeus hated that he was telling the truth.He watched the game begin. It was the man's move, it had to be, and there it was - the pause in their lilting conversation, the brush of fingertips against an unruly curl.And now, the boy's. To lean into it, catlike, and beckon with his eyes so blatantly that Zeus shuddered, and curled in tighter on himself.He told himself that he was better than this man, that Ganymede deserved patience and courtship and virtue. That he was worth more than a quick fuck in the hills, but the truth was, if he didn't win him over completely - if it could only happen once - Zeus would never be satisfied. He knew the difference between someone you appreciated and someone you treasured. He knew that people like Ilarus came and went, and people like Ganymede lasted.It didn't make it any easier to watch as their lips met, as Ilar's fingers slid into his hair and he saw - maybe he imagined it, but no, he knew his Prince's facial expressions too well by now - a slight wince cross the Price's parted lips. Zeus knew what it was. The hairs were catching on his rings, and he wasn't delicate enough, he wasn't perfect. Zeus could be perfect.He told himself this.The next move was Ganymede's, and it was swift and decisive. He moved forward, pushed Ilarus up against the nearest stack - it rattled, but held - and he pressed up against him, long and lovely, and the kiss became filthy, uneven. Zeus trapped a thumb to his own lips, hard, until he heard the bones creak, because seeing him like this was breaking him apart, piece by piece. The headache of keeping the storm at bay was only tightening - the jealousy burned, and he could only stay put because he'd known this day would come. A day when Ganymede's fingers would touch another man's skin, the day that man would moan and gasp in surprise because they didn't know, they could not have known what the Trojan Prince was capable of. Zeus knew. He'd known it from the moment he'd seen him, that this boy would be the undoing of men.Ilarus was trembling head to toe now, one hand gripping the wood shelf to steady himself, the other at Ganymede's back - shaky, as if he didn't know what to do with it, or rather, couldn't decide. Ganymede was hitching a leg up around his waist and sliding his tongue along the lines of his neck and gripping and grinding and purring, and Zeus gritted his teeth. This was beyond jealousy, now, this was pure carnality, roiling through his veins.Thunder rolled.Ganymede moaned.Ilar's head snapped up and he watched, wide-eyed, as the sky grew darker. \"I don't believe this,\" he muttered, and there was a hint of despair in his voice, a strangled incredulity. \"Another storm?\"\"I love storms,\" Ganymede muttered in a breathy whisper, and that was it, Zeus pressed the heel of his hand to his groin, the other one firmly clamped over his mouth.\"Well we'll have to make the best of this one, then,\" Ilarus murmured in return, and the thunder cracked, and lightning flashed.It was a vicious cycle. Ganymede responded to the call of the thunder, which made Zeus rock harder into his hand and bite down on his knuckles to keep himself in control. Ilarus responded to Ganymede's enthusiasm, and his cries made Zeus angrier, and the storm raged harder. And with every roll of thunder, Ganymede whimpered.Zeus came first.It was the messy mindfuck of an image - Ilarus spread over the drafting table, Ganymede straddling his hips, rubbing slow and indecent against him as they kissed, with one of Ilar's hands locked in Ganymede's hair - and the sound he made, a startled, gasping mewl into the hollow of his throat. Zeus came apart. He bit down so hard he drew blood, and it was a double shock then, the pleasure and the pain. He could hear, heartwrenchingly, the sound of Ganymede following. From another man's touch. Another man, and a thunderstorm.+ later +Ganymede collapsed into his room as an utter wreck of himself, soaked to the skin and shivering head to toe. \"Idaios?\" he called, trying very hard not to sound completely pathetic. \"I-Idaios...\"He'd just squeezed his eyes shut and resolved to drying off alone when a warm, clean cloth wrapped around and around his body.\"My lord,\" Idaios murmured, an inch away from Ganymede's ear, his presence like a solid tree trunk with its roots sunk in deep. The Prince shuddered, still overstimulated, but he was wetly grateful and after a moment, the man seemed to understand. He didn't have to move at all, then, as Idaios dried him off, rolling him in the clean warmth until it had soaked away every trace of the rain. He didn't have to lift a finger as he peeled the wet clothes from his body and tossed them in a corner. He let himself be carried off, bundled and warm and safe, to his bed, where Idaios slipped him under his covers and lay his hair out in a straggled line across his pillow, where it could dry.It was still raining. The thunder had stopped - a short storm, then, and now there was just rain, sweet and gentle, and Ganymede could almost still feel it on his skin - when he'd run out of the library, half-terrified, half-disgusted with himself, and it had felt like the skies had simply opened up around him.It cleansed him. Drove whatever madness pleasure had left from his body, but now he felt nothing, nothing at all.Idaios sighed, very quietly, and stood to go.\"Wait-\"Ganymede hated how wretched he sounded, how weak. He was a Prince of Troy, not a catamite to be coddled and bent and used. But he hadn't behaved particularly Princely today. Princes don't lose control so rashly in public. Princes don't run out on their almost-lovers after doing so.Princes don't come to the sound of thunder.Idaios, wonderful, wonderful Idaios, didn't question the order or the tone it was given in. He sat at the edge of the bed, seemed to understand that Ganymede needed the closeness, the comfort. He wriggled pale fingers until he could lock them in the very edge of the servant's shirt, and he did no more than smile.\"Tell me a story,\" he breathed, for something to say to fill the space.\"Mmm.\" A strong arm reached for him, and pulled until Idaios was leaning up against the headboard, with Ganymede's head pillowed in his lap. It was endearing and audacious and he liked it, because it was exactly what he needed right then. Someone warm and breathing, who would not judge him, who would put his hands in his hair without tugging, without expecting more from him - without unleashing something inside of him that Ganymede had only just grown aware of. It was nice. \"Who is your favorite, of the gods?\"It should have been a terribly impertinent question, but Ganymede replied instantly. \"Zeus.\" He'd always been his favorite, recent experience with thunderstorms notwithstanding.The admission seemed to amuse him, and he felt rather than heard a low chuckle ripple over his skin. \"All right. I'll tell you a story of Zeus, then.\"Ganymede made a breathy noise, as hands settled on his scalp and worked in a long circle. \"Tell me a story of Zeus and Heracles.\"The hands stopped for a moment, in something like surprise. \"Heracles?\"\"Mmhm.\" Ganymede shifted and turned, until the stroking started up again, and he quieted. \"The one with the giants.\"\"Why that story,\" came the question, but the Prince knew that Idaios knew that it was his favorite. Zeus choosing Heracles, to stand by his side, to fight off the earth giants attacking Olympus. There was a prophecy, and some other things, but what Ganymede loved best had nothing to do with that.He yawned, and turned his face into Idaios's hand, so he could murmur the truth between his perfect fingers. \"...He sounds almost human then.\"",

      "He didn't have to move at all, then, as Idaios dried him off, rolling him in the clean warmth until it had soaked away every trace of the rain.",
      "He didn't have to lift a finger as he peeled the wet clothes from his body and tossed them in a corner.",
      "He let himself be carried off, bundled and warm and safe, to his bed, where Idaios slipped him under his covers and lay his hair out in a straggled line across his pillow, where it could dry.It was still raining.",
      "The thunder had stopped - a short storm, then, and now there was just rain, sweet and gentle, and Ganymede could almost still feel it on his skin - when he'd run out of the library, half-terrified, half-disgusted with himself, and it had felt like the skies had simply opened up around him.",
      "It cleansed him.",
      "Drove whatever madness pleasure had left from his body, but now he felt nothing, nothing at all.Idaios sighed, very quietly, and stood to go.\"Wait-\"Ganymede",
      "hated how wretched he sounded, how weak.",
      "He was a Prince of Troy, not a catamite to be coddled and bent and used.",
      "But he hadn't behaved particularly Princely today.",
      "Princes don't lose control so rashly in public.",
      "Princes don't run out on their almost-lovers after doing so.Princes don't come to the sound of thunder.Idaios, wonderful, wonderful Idaios, didn't question the order or the tone it was given in.",
      "He sat at the edge of the bed, seemed to understand that Ganymede needed the closeness, the comfort.",
      "He wriggled pale fingers until he could lock them in the very edge of the servant's shirt, and he did no more than smile.\"Tell me a story,\" he breathed, for something to say to fill the space.\"Mmm.\"",
      "A strong arm reached for him, and pulled until Idaios was leaning up against the headboard, with Ganymede's head pillowed in his lap.",
      "It was endearing and audacious and he liked it, because it was exactly what he needed right then.",
      "Someone warm and breathing, who would not judge him, who would put his hands in his hair without tugging, without expecting more from him - without unleashing something inside of him that Ganymede had only just grown aware of.",
      "It was nice.",
      "\"Who is your favorite, of the gods?\"It should have been a terribly impertinent question, but Ganymede replied instantly.",
      "\"Zeus.\"",
      "He'd always been his favorite, recent experience with thunderstorms notwithstanding.",
      "The admission seemed to amuse him, and he felt rather than heard a low chuckle ripple over his skin.",
      "\"All right.",
      "I'll tell you a story of Zeus, then.\"Ganymede made a breathy noise, as hands settled on his scalp and worked in a long circle.",
      "\"Tell me a story of Zeus and Heracles.\"The hands stopped for a moment, in something like surprise.",
      "\"Heracles?\"\"Mmhm.\"",
      "Ganymede shifted and turned, until the stroking started up again, and he quieted.",
      "\"The one with the giants.\"\"Why that story,\" came the question, but the Prince knew that Idaios knew that it was his favorite.",
      "Zeus choosing Heracles, to stand by his side, to fight off the earth giants attacking Olympus.",
      "There was a prophecy, and some other things, but what Ganymede loved best had nothing to do with that.He yawned, and turned his face into Idaios's hand, so he could murmur the truth between his perfect fingers.",
      "\"...He sounds almost human then.\""

    "text": "Meleager 2071 A.C.E. \"I'm sorry, Mrs. Calydon, but as soon as the program finishes downloading, your son will die,\" said the three-headed robot Dr. Fates. \"But why?\" asked Althea Calydon. \"You don't really expect an answer, do you?\" retorted the dry humor of Dr. Fates's artificial intelligence. Althea looked at her baby boy in his incubation chamber. She couldn't let her son die. \"I can't accept that,\" the young mother said. \"She ejected the diskette, write-protected it, and stuffed it in her coat pocket. She took her son out of the chamber and wrapped him in a warm blanket. They beat a hasty retreat. --- The child in question was Meleager Calydon, the genetically-engineered son of Althea Calydon, and her husband OEneus Calydon, president of Calydon Enterprises, which you might remember took out Quest Enterprises in 2035. Now OEneus Calydon was quite a shady character. Besides his legitimate businesses like computers, sporting equipment, and elevators, he also dealt in Colombian drug cartels and Japanese doujinshi rings. In his haste to acquire more wealth, he overlooked paying Diana Artemiso, the leader of the Colombian Mafia. Forgetting to pay the Mafia is a big mistake. Diana Artemiso, in her anger, sent a computer virus -- codename BOAR -- to destroy Calydon Enterprises's systems. Now OEneus may not have been the brightest light on the holographic chandelier, but his son was state-of-the-art. Part of his intelligence came from knowing when he needed help. To kill this invader, he brought in Theseus Macintosh, Pirithous Dell, Jason Gateway, Peleus Compaq (later father of Achilles Compaq), Telamon Pentium (later father of Ajax Pentium), and the young Nestor E. Apple II, among others. Another, very notable addition to this group was Atlanta Windows-Microsoft, the intelligent and beautiful daughter of Iasus Microsoft, another leader in the computer industry. She had all the latest equipment, and she knew how to use it. Meleager fell in love almost instantly. The team began by setting up a firewall and deploying search-nanoprobes. Everyone donned their Virtual-Reality visors and logged onto WorldNet. From there, they swiftly navigated their way to the source of the problem: Calydon Enterprises's main computer. The VR visors translated all of this into a marsh. The BOAR virus detected these prodigies and lashed out, rending, maiming, and tearing the VR bodies and destroying the neural nets of one after another of Unnamed Redshirts. None of them were of noble parentage, so it wasn't any great loss. Jason, unbeknownst to any of the other heroes, was trying to get to the drug deals of Artemiso, asked her help in aiming his Magneto-Spear. She allowed the MS to touch, but nothing more. She liked his desperate butt-kissing, though. Maybe she could find a use for him at Gateway Industries. It was Atalanta of Microsoft blood, with inborn ingenuity and software stolen from around the world, with a virtual arrow charged with energy from the firewall, who made the first mark on the cyber-beast. It crackled with white-hot electricity and screamed--a harsh, unpleasant sound. \"Atalanta has disabled it!\" Meleager cried joyfully, as much to get her attention as to congratulate her. Anceus, a new employee at Calydon, with only an entry-level position, had joined this mission looking for advancement, and it didn't appear to be doing him any good. How was he supposed to impress the boss's son when this...female had just struck the first blow? Well, he'd show her. \"Is that the best you can do? Chick? Let the best do the rest.\" He charged the BOAR in t he same way Telemon had. This, and the anger of the femenist Artemiso, sent the self-absorbed little upstart to the Royal Order of Redshirts. Theseus was able to adapt one of the search-nanoprobes into a grenade launcher, using contained magnets. This owuld have been effective, but something was deflecting the missiles. Things got worse when Jason decided to try his spear again and hit his improvised launcher, effectively shortint it out. Meleager stepped to the forefront, and attacked from the side, hitting the BOAR's periphery with a blast of static electricity. He tried again, this time connecting and doing some real damage. He struck again and again, rushing and attacking. Finally, a shout went up: \"We got it!\" and raucous nerdy laughter the likes of which hadn't been seen since Revenge of the Nerds sounded throughout the Calydon Mainframe. Meleager gave the remains of the virus to Atalanta. It was only fair, since she had gotten \"first blood.\" \"Thank you,\" she said, and kissed him. Meleager was barely able to keep his mind in VR. --- Once they'd all logged out, Plexippus and Toxeus, two of Meleager's uncles who'd been in the hunting party, were jealous that Atalanta had gotten all the honor and fame out of all who had been there. They hacked into the system and stole the remains of the virus for themselves. They were the deserving ones, they rationalized. Meleager didn't see it that way. They'd taken from a heroine, and what's more, they'd taken from the woman he loved. He drew his hand phaser and vaporized them on the spot. --- Althea was relieved that Meleager had been victorious, but when her tricorder read the phaser residue of her brothers, she fries a few circuits in the ol' brain and scraps her idea for a celebration of Meleager's victory, planning a memorial service for her brothers instead. In the heat of her anger, she uses her high-profile access to break into the ward and boots up the computer in the ward where Meleager had been taken out of incubation. She took The Disk, the one that sealed her son's fate, and began to put it into the drive. She drew her hand back, unsure if what she was planning was right. This happened four times. It's only fair, she decided. Why should OEneus celebrate while I am in mourning? An eye for an eye, I say! Well, I brought you into this world, Mellie, and watch me take you out! She finished the download. The:::ding::: of completion seemed to be a deathly groan. It was the groan of her son, dying. He was courageous, and handled the pain regally. His only regret that he had died by a bloodless and dishonorable death, not having his brain electricity jerked across cyberspace as he fought for his life. --- Weeks later, Althea recovered from her grief and hysteria and realized what she had done. She took the coward's way out of guilt. Meleager's systers were insonsolably sad and depressed, their grief never-ending and all-powerful over them...until Diana Artemiso invited them to be citizens of CyberNation, a WorldNet community, where they all became mindless drones.",

      "Meleager cried joyfully, as much to get her attention as to congratulate her.",
      "Anceus, a new employee at Calydon, with only an entry-level position, had joined this mission looking for advancement, and it didn't appear to be doing him any good.",
      "How was he supposed to impress the boss's son when this...female had just struck the first blow?",
      "Well, he'd show her.",
      "\"Is that the best you can do?",
      "Chick?",
      "Let the best do the rest.\"",
      "He charged the BOAR in t he same way Telemon had.",
      "This, and the anger of the femenist Artemiso, sent the self-absorbed little upstart to the Royal Order of Redshirts.",
      "Theseus was able to adapt one of the search-nanoprobes into a grenade launcher, using contained magnets.",
      "This owuld have been effective, but something was deflecting the missiles.",
      "Things got worse when Jason decided to try his spear again and hit his improvised launcher, effectively shortint it out.",
      "Meleager stepped to the forefront, and attacked from the side, hitting the BOAR's periphery with a blast of static electricity.",
      "He tried again, this time connecting and doing some real damage.",
      "He struck again and again, rushing and attacking.",
      "Finally, a shout went up: \"We got it!\"",
      "and raucous nerdy laughter the likes of which hadn't been seen since Revenge of the Nerds sounded throughout the Calydon Mainframe.",
      "Meleager gave the remains of the virus to Atalanta.",
      "It was only fair, since she had gotten \"first blood.\"",
      "\"Thank you,\" she said, and kissed him.",
      "Meleager was barely able to keep his mind in VR. --- Once they'd all logged out, Plexippus and Toxeus, two of Meleager's uncles who'd been in the hunting party, were jealous that Atalanta had gotten all the honor and fame out of all who had been there.",
      "They hacked into the system and stole the remains of the virus for themselves.",
      "They were the deserving ones, they rationalized.",
      "Meleager didn't see it that way.",
      "They'd taken from a heroine, and what's more, they'd taken from the woman he loved.",
      "He drew his hand phaser and vaporized them on the spot.",
      "--- Althea was relieved that Meleager had been victorious, but when her tricorder read the phaser residue of her brothers, she fries a few circuits in the ol' brain and scraps her idea for a celebration of Meleager's victory, planning a memorial service for her brothers instead.",
      "In the heat of her anger, she uses her high-profile access to break into the ward and boots up the computer in the ward where Meleager had been taken out of incubation.",
      "She took The Disk, the one that sealed her son's fate, and began to put it into the drive.",
      "She drew her hand back, unsure if what she was planning was right.",
      "This happened four times.",
      "It's only fair, she decided.",
      "Why should OEneus celebrate while I am in mourning?",
      "An eye for an eye, I say!",
      "Well, I brought you into this world, Mellie, and watch me take you out!",
      "She finished the download.",
      "The:::ding::: of completion seemed to be a deathly groan.",
      "It was the groan of her son, dying.",
      "He was courageous, and handled the pain regally.",
      "His only regret that he had died by a bloodless and dishonorable death, not having his brain electricity jerked across cyberspace as he fought for his life.",
      "--- Weeks later, Althea recovered from her grief and hysteria and realized what she had done.",
      "She took the coward's way out of guilt.",
      "Meleager's systers were insonsolably sad and depressed, their grief never-ending and all-powerful over them...until Diana Artemiso invited them to be citizens of CyberNation, a WorldNet community, where they all became mindless drones."

    "text": "What is happening? I do not understand. What is this? I do not want this. Why am I changing? I want to stay. \"Poseidon, Lord of the Seas, leave me be!\" I cried. How is it that I can speak? What has happened to me? I reached out to my master with my mind. Why would he not answer me? I could always feel my lord. I could not any longer. Have I done something wrong? I had been a faithful servant for centuries. He has never shown displeasure to me before now. I do not know what to think. Sea water rushed into the place I spoke from. There is a tunnel inside of me. I choke. Why is it I am choking? I move. I feel something move. I have somehow moved long tentacles. They are mine. I do not recognize them. I do not recognize the body they are attached to. This is not me. Why am I not me? I have a body. A body like one of the octopi. No, not the octopi. Their tentacles are darker and with suction cupping and a slippery touch. I have coated over octopi many times, but in this body I cannot. This body, my lord, reminds me of a human's. They are disgusting, vile creatures that do not value the oceans. Surely you have not made me into one of them, sir. What have I done to anger you so much? I do not understand your intentions, my lord. Please, if it is not you who has done this to me, help me! Rest, my child. Close your eyes and leave your past self behind. You have been born anew and I will not allow you to be harmed before you have fulfilled your prophecy. You are destined to become a greater being than a mere human. Rest and believe in the Fates. They will not do you harm.. \"Mother, she seems to be waking up,\" a deep voice boomed, shaking me out of my sleep. It reminded me of my master's, but was not as grand as his. This tone did not rid me of sleep, but simply annoyed my new mind. This voice left something to be desired. I opened my eyes to see a pair of light green orbs staring down at me. What is this? There is a human next to me. It is ugly, much like the rest of them. Its short dark hair and huge frame scared me very much. I feel small compared to it. It is abnormally large compared to all the other humans that I have seen. I am inside a human hut. It is very small, with one bed and a few woven baskets, and makes me miss the vast ocean of my lord. I feel so tired in this small body. It was hard to move my limbs. Why was I brought here? \"Oh you are finally awake. You gave us quite a scare,\" a human with arctic-shell hair chattered. It was of medium human height, smaller and frailer than the other humans I have observed. It has wrinkles, a sign of human aging, everywhere, even on its ancient hands. I am a human now. Will this horrific wrinkle thing happen to me as well? I do not want to be wrinkled. I wish to stay myself. \"A scare,\" I repeated and wondered why I could understand this language. Human speech had always seemed garbled and crass next to my own beautiful tongue. It seems that this human understands me, since it nods and smiles, but I cannot comprehend how. How do I know these human words? I could never grasp the threads of this language, but now my tongue is fluent. It must have been Lord Poseidon's doing. \"A scare is definitely an understatement! Thene and I found you unmoving on the northern beaches, completely covered in sea foam. I couldn't even feel a heartbeat on you, at first. I thought you were dead. But don't worry my dear. There is not a mark on you,\" the human chattered. It does seem very concerned about me, but still keeps looking outside the hut for something or someone. Maybe another human? \"What is sea foam?\" I do not understand some human terms, but I seem to have a good understanding of this language. Why is it so? I realized I cannot feel my lord. It must be this human body's fault. My mind feels so much smaller than before. I had been able to feel myself in all the corners of the world but not anymore. My senses have been dulled and I cannot even smell the human stench surrounding most of these two-legged animals. Maybe it is because I am human now myself. I did not know humans had such limited senses. \"Sea foam?\" It looked at me in a different way. As though it cannot understand me. \"She must not be from these parts. I guess the elders were right. We can use her,\" it muttered, but I could still hear it. \"Sea foam is the yellow and white bubbles that ocean waves bring to land.\" That is me! No, that was me. I was this sea foam it is talking about. Except it is wrong! I was the most important ocean dweller, except for my lord. I knew everything about the oceans and would recap every detail of what has been happening to my lord when he could not watch over his domain. I could talk to every creature and could tell you the exact time King Aegan fell into me, fell to his death. I could tell you which ships sank and when, which sailors survived and which were dragged down into Lord Poseidon's dark waters. I was about to correct it when the door slammed into the wall. It was the short-haired human from when I first opened my eyes. What does it want now? It is looking at me very strangely. As though it cannot look away. Does my human body look even worse than its? I could never bear to see myself in this form. I will have to avoid seeing my reflection since I am probably as ugly as this human. \"Mother! They are coming! Is she ready?\" \"Almost! Can you hold them off for a short time Thene? I need to explain this to her,\" the older human cries, obviously anxious and nervous. It makes me nervous as well. What are they planning to do with me? The short-haired human leaves the hut. \"Oh, my dear, I would never wish this fate on a foreign soul. I wish they would take my own daughter in place of you. You are too beautiful to die, but that is why you are the sacrifice. Your beauty, little one,\" it whispers, listing a lock of my hair, \"will appease the Lord of the Seas.\" \"The Lord of the Seas is already appeased. He is happy, or at least he was the last time I could sense him. You do not need a sacrifice,\" I try to convince it. I do not wish to die as a human. I am a mere mortal now, but as sea foam I was invincible. I was immortal like my lord. The human is angry at me. I do not understand humans. They wear their emotions on their face, yet I cannot understand them very well. Why is it angry at me? I speak the truth and the truth is in my favor. Does it not want master to be happy? \"Insolent girl!\" It cries, grabbing my tentacle and pulling me up to a sitting position. I can now see I am wearing the same ugly attire as this human. Did it dress me? I never wore these unsightly garbs in my former state. I had no need for them. But from my observations, humans like the one with me prefer to cover their ugly bodies. They are right to do so. But why use even uglier material to cover their already ugly selves? \"How dare you speak as though you are familiar with the Lord of the Seas! Your beauty is breathtaking but your mind is wicked and corrupt. A dangerous combination. It is well that you are to be sacrificed or else you may seduce our husbands without lifting a single finger.\" Why would I want to seduce these human men? They are ugly. \"I do not need your ugly men. You should not worry,\" I try to appease this human, trying to tell it that I will not touch them. This makes it even angrier. What am I doing wrong? I cannot see how I am upsetting it. It grabs my left tentacle and forces me out of the human bed. I am annoyed. It was very warm in this strange structure. When I voiced my concerns, it almost growled in the manner of land animals with short tails and thick fur. I did not know humans could do this, but it looks very scary now. I start to shrink away when I realize I am unable to stand on my lower two tentacles, as the human does, without holding on to the bed. \"Let's go, you vile woman. I will be much too happy to let you die,\" it growls and its face is contorted in an unhappy expression. This is very different from its happy and concerned face when I first awoke. Is its change in mood my fault or is it regular human behavior? I wish to apologize to it, but decide against this. The apology may hurdle it into an even worse state of mind and it may use its tentacles against me. It tugs on my tentacle and I stumble and almost fall. It does not let go of me and almost pulls my tentacle out. My tentacle hurts. This is my first time feeling hurt. I thrust my other tentacle out to steady myself and regain my balance just as the human pulls at my tentacle again. I grab onto it and stumble with my lower tentacles through the opening of the human hut. There is a crowd of arctic-shell haired humans with very light brown skin huddled around the hut. Most have very short hair, maybe an inch in length, and the rest have very long hair, almost as long as their upper tentacles. Their clothes are as torn and dirty as my own. They are ugly. They stare at me and at the human next to me. Why are they staring? I look down at my new body. My new skin is lighter than theirs, not darkened by the sun into a different color. It is only a very light tan, the color of my beautiful foam. Maybe I am not as ugly as I thought; after all, my favorite color is in my skin. I touch my hair with my free tentacle. It is the color of the dusty human castles far south. My skin does not have wrinkles. I am happy. Does this mean I do not look like the human next to me? Maybe I am a handsome human. I will be the only one then. The group of humans is still staring at me. I do not know why, but it makes me uncomfortable. I never felt uncomfortable when humans stared at me in my foam form. \"Who are you? Where am I?\" I ask them these questions and the older humans break out of their separate trances. \"What are you planning to do to me?\" A few humans look to the ground with a shameful expression on their faces. It makes them seem just a little less ugly. They think I am angry with them because they want to sacrifice me. But I do not see anything wrong with sacrifices. I simply do not wish to be sacrificed. But if sacrifices make Poseidon happy... \"You are on the island of Cyprus, fair lady. We are the people of this island. We found you on our shores and believe you are a gift from the gods,\" a short-haired human answered. I decide I don't like the reverence in its tone. I am only an ugly human like it. They should not be awed. Then I notice one of the long-haired humans is unhappy. It has an expression similar to the scary woman next to me. The scary human cuts in. \"We are taking you to eastern cliffs, where we will chain you to the rocks as a sacrifice to the Lord of the Seas, the giver of horses, the Earth-Shaker Lord Poseidon. He will be pleased with a maiden as beautiful as you.\" It says this in a very happy tone. I realize it wants me to die. Are all humans this cruel and blood-thirsty? I do not want to be chained to a rock and made to wait for my master. \"And what if Lord Poseidon does not come for me?\" I ask, hoping they will free me. Then I can get away from this scary woman and pray for the rest of my short human life to be turned back into sea foam. Maybe Lord Poseidon will answer my prayers if I pray for at least an hour every day. \"Then you will wed one of the single men of this village and work in the fields with the rest of us women. I should hope our lord collects you, because your hands are too soft our tasks. The only thing you will be good for is carrying water at midday and even that I imagine your thin frame cannot handle. So you will probably then clean your husband's house and concentrate on pleasing him. I think my brother will be happy with such a beautiful wife,\" the scary human ranted, aiming to frighten me. It worked. I do not want to please a human husband. I pleased the dolphins by singing their praises. I pleased the octopi by clinging to their tentacles. But I do not know how to please an ugly human husband. One of the other humans frowns. \"Kaede, can't we sacrifice someone else? She is so pretty... I cannot bear to see her leave us. I have only seen her thrice, but I am already enamor--\" \"Stop! Thene, stop this nonsense. She is not as pure as you may think she is. Why, she thinks she has talked to the Lord Poseidon. She's either crazy or wicked and trying to get out of her sacrificial duty. Any woman should be honored to become a sacrifice.\" The scary human, Kaede, starts walking and I have no choice but to hold on to it and move my lower tentacles at the same time it moves its. It is uncomfortable and the wide slabs of flesh at the very bottom of my tentacles have begun to hurt very much. I do not like it. I want the pain to stop, but the scary human is walking faster and faster. \"Kaede, stop! She is having trouble walking. Do you really expect her not to collapse before she gets to the eastern cliffs? I will carry her,\" the human that asked the scary human to allow someone else to be sacrificed. I like this human. It tried to protect me. I think the scary woman is called Kaede and this short-haired one is called Thene. I remember observing that humans have these things called names. They use these names to call a certain human to them. It is a very good idea. I should have given the octopi names so I could call them now and they could scare away all these humans. Thene gently lifts my body up. My head rests on its shoulder and its one of its upper tentacles holds up my lower tentacles and its other upper tentacle holds my upper body. I feel very comfortable. \"Are you okay?\" He inquires. \"No,\" I whisper quietly. \"I am very scared.\" \"Don't be. Lord Poseidon may not come for you. And if he doesn't, I will ask my mother, Kaede, for your hand in marriage. You will be my wife and bear my children. No one will harm you, my beautiful Aphrodite,\" he murmurs, calming me very much. \"What have you called me?\" I have been given a human name. I am now more human. This both upsets me and pleases me. I would not mind staying with this nice human. He is ugly, but he is very calm. He can teach me how to please a man and how to bear children. I have never understood how children come out of long-haired humans. One moment the humans are very fat, then they are thinner and with a small child. Are the children inside of the humans? Or do the children come from elsewhere and eat the mother's fat to grow? Is that why humans are so thin when they are very old? Oh, the mysteries of this race. Now my race. \"Aphrodite, my beauty. Aphros means foam in our Greek language and I thought it fitting since you were covered in foam when mother and I first found you.\" It mistook my perplexed face as outrage, when I was simply wondering how such a scary woman could have birthed such a kind human. \"Please, do not be angry! Do not worry for your chastity. I did not touch you inappropriately. All I did was carry you into mother's house and gave you to her so she could bathe and dress you. I did not watch!\" \"I am not worried. You are very nice and do nice things. You make me happy,\" I smiled, its patting of the place under my lower back pleasing me very much. Maybe humans are not that bad, since they can make me very happy. It grinned and lightly pinched the place it was patting. \"I'm glad, dear Aphrodite.\" Its eyes went wide when I smiled at it and it only broke out of its daze when it, Kaede, the mob of ugly humans, and I reached the cliffs. I had been too busy talking to Thene to pay attention to the walk to the cliffs. Cliffs are what humans call the slab of rock that is at a much higher than the sea, and it will kill you if you jump into the sea from one of these cliffs. Thene began telling me the story of two star-crossed lovers that jumped from these cliffs in order to be together in death since they could not marry on earth, but I was not interested in a human tale. When we reached the edge of the cliff, Thene did something very strange. He placed me on the ground, walked to the very edge, kneeled down, turned around, and slowly lowered himself down. Kaede dragged me toward the edge and I saw that some rocks jutted out more than most and Thene had used these to climb down. A very ingenious idea. These humans were cleverer than I had first thought. \"I'm ready, Mother!\" He yelled. I suppose he had to yell since he was a good distance from the top of the cliff. But what was he ready for? At this time, I was looking over the edge of the cliff and holding onto Kade. I should have known not to trust humans. Kaede smiled in its very scary way, grabbed my tentacles, and pushed me off. I screamed for less than a second until a hard, warm body caught me. Thene, my savior, cradled me against its chest until I stopped shaking. Could I not have climbed down like Thene? Did I really have to be pushed down? Does Kaede dislike me enough to want to scare me this terribly? I remember seeing these cliffs from the ocean and thinking of how beautiful they looked, but how the image of human children playing on top of them marred their beauty. I had been too far away to see the ominous metal chains welded into the rock. My fear intensified when Thene set me down, even though I very much wanted to stay in its warm tentacles, and started to chain my lower and upper tentacles. He locked the metal chains around my lower and upper tentacles with a low \"I'm so sorry, my beautiful Aphrodite.\" The chains hurt my skin very much. I did not like it. \"Kaede, Thene, may I please sit here without the chains? I will not be able to climb up anyway,\" I looked up and pleaded, trying to look as innocent as possible, but I could tell Kaede knew I was lying. It scowled at me from above. And it shook its head. Thene, on the other hand, looked completely convinced. So did most of the short-haired humans that had followed us, which were now looking over the edge of the cliff in silence. It seemed that I could only convince the younger short-haired ones. They had that awed emotion in their eyes and I think they would believe anything I say. \"Mother, I think--\" Thene tried to convince its mother, but with no avail as Kaede cut it off. \"No. I will not allow this woman to bewitch you. Leave, everyone. Now!\" Everyone shuffled back to the collection of huts further inland. Even Kaede left after glaring at me and telling me that it will \"make me disappear\" if Lord Poseidon will not accept me. I do not want to disappear, unless Kaede can turn me back into sea foam. Then I will be eternally grateful to this human. But I do not think it can do that, since it is not Lord Poseidon, and also its words left me with a bad feeling. I sat and waited for Lord Poseidon to come for me. I waited, and waited, and waited until darkness began setting in. I definitely believed in my lord, but maybe I had done something to displease him? Should I have made an offering to him as soon as I became a human? I don't think Kaede had any bulls for me to offer. A while later, as the evening wore on, I saw a huge disturbance in the ocean. The waters were twisting in a circle, like a whirlpool, and had become very dark. This continued for a few minutes until the earth started to shake and I felt the ground rumble. A three-pronged spear began to lift out of the water and a man along with it. Poseidon, Lord of the Seas, the Earth-Shaker, had finally come for me! His form soon fully emerged from the ocean and a single wave slowly raised him up to me. I should have been disappointed, for his outward appearance was that of an older human's. He had a few wrinkles on his face and a bushy white beard, but I could not describe him in a word not synonymous to magnificent or stunning. His eyes were the color of the sea. I could not tear my eyes away. Is this the emotion the humans felt when they stared at me? His mere presence demanded my respect and I willingly gave it to him. His majestic aura left me no doubt. This was my lord, the one I shall serve until I die. \"My lord,\" I whispered, crawling onto my knees in a low bow of complete submission. The wave had set him down on my slab of rock, only a foot away from me. I was so close to my revered companion, the ruler of all seas. \"Rise, Aphrodite,\" he commanded and I stood up, ignoring the shakiness in my tentacles and the pain I felt when I used them. He walked over and touched each chain. They loosened and fell to the ground. I was freed. \"Do you know why you are here?\" \"I do not, my lord. I have been faithful to you for my entire existence, and you have now turned me into a human. I do not wish to offend you, sire. I simply do not understand your intentions,\" I said to him, praying he would not be angry for doubting his actions. I could not bring myself to look in his eyes to see if he was angry. \"Look at me Aphrodite,\" he ordered and I obeyed. He did not seem angry, but I have learned looks can be deceiving. \"You have been my faithful servant for thousands of years. This is not a punishment as I know you think it is. This is a gift. You are not human. You are a goddess. You will not die until all the sea foam of earth vanishes, and for that to happen all the seas and rivers will have to dry out. That will only occur if I die. I am immortal. I will not die. You will not die.\" \"My lord...\" I trailed off, not knowing what to say. This was such an honor. Should he really have chosen me? \"You are the Olympian Goddess of Love and Beauty, but this title comes at a price. You will bring joy to all of Greece and beyond, but you will be weak. You cannot fight and will never be able to learn to do so. Should you throw a dagger, your aim will forever be crooked. Should you draw a sword, you will never hit your target. Little one, if you wish to return to sea foam, tell me now. Otherwise, I shall take you to Mount. Olympus where you will reside for the rest of eternity,\" he concluded, staring shrewdly at me. I nodded. There was not much of a choice. This was too big of an opportunity to miss. This was the chance of a lifetime. \"I will come with you my lord, and serve you and your brothers for the rest of time.\" \"I hope you keep your naivety and innocence, if only for a little while longer. It is too refreshing for a god as old as I,\" he murmurs, touching my cheek. He gently grasped my tentacle and pulled me toward him. Then the ocean rumbled once again and a giant wave enveloped my master and I. I closed my eyes, fearing what the water could do to my human, or goddess, form. When I opened them again, I found myself on above the clouds, standing on a misty surface that I should not have been able to stand on, staring at the imposing Kingdom of the Olympians. It was grand, marvelous, and nothing at all like human castles. Those had been gaudy and simply plain compared to this majestic structure. White mist reached higher than my knees and rushed through my toes, healing my aches, steadying and energizing my body. But even with the mist's power pulsing through my veins, I felt minuscule, dwarfed by the Kingdom of the Gods. Built of pearly white stone, this was the ultimate temple of worship. Beams lifted the ceiling high into the remaining clouds and I could see faces of gods carved into the outside walls. I was shocked to see my new name, Aphrodite, already engraved into one of the center beams. \"Welcome to Mount. Olympus, my child.\"",

      "I do not want to please a human husband.",
      "I pleased the dolphins by singing their praises.",
      "I pleased the octopi by clinging to their tentacles.",
      "But I do not know how to please an ugly human husband.",
      "One of the other humans frowns.",
      "\"Kaede, can't we sacrifice someone else?",
      "She is so pretty...",
      "I cannot bear to see her leave us.",
      "I have only seen her thrice, but I am already enamor--\" \"Stop!",
      "Thene, stop this nonsense.",
      "She is not as pure as you may think she is.",
      "Why, she thinks she has talked to the Lord Poseidon.",
      "She's either crazy or wicked and trying to get out of her sacrificial duty.",
      "Any woman should be honored to become a sacrifice.\"",
      "The scary human, Kaede, starts walking and I have no choice but to hold on to it and move my lower tentacles at the same time it moves its.",
      "It is uncomfortable and the wide slabs of flesh at the very bottom of my tentacles have begun to hurt very much.",
      "I do not like it.",
      "I want the pain to stop, but the scary human is walking faster and faster.",
      "\"Kaede, stop!",
      "She is having trouble walking.",
      "Do you really expect her not to collapse before she gets to the eastern cliffs?",
      "I will carry her,\" the human that asked the scary human to allow someone else to be sacrificed.",
      "I like this human.",
      "It tried to protect me.",
      "I think the scary woman is called Kaede and this short-haired one is called Thene.",
      "I remember observing that humans have these things called names.",
      "They use these names to call a certain human to them.",
      "It is a very good idea.",
      "I should have given the octopi names so I could call them now and they could scare away all these humans.",
      "Thene gently lifts my body up.",
      "My head rests on its shoulder and its one of its upper tentacles holds up my lower tentacles and its other upper tentacle holds my upper body.",
      "I feel very comfortable.",
      "\"Are you okay?\"",
      "He inquires.",
      "\"No,\" I whisper quietly.",
      "\"I am very scared.\"",
      "\"Don't be.",
      "Lord Poseidon may not come for you.",
      "And if he doesn't, I will ask my mother, Kaede, for your hand in marriage.",
      "You will be my wife and bear my children.",
      "No one will harm you, my beautiful Aphrodite,\" he murmurs, calming me very much.",
      "\"What have you called me?\" I have been given a human name.",
      "I am now more human.",
      "This both upsets me and pleases me.",
      "I would not mind staying with this nice human.",
      "He is ugly, but he is very calm.",
      "He can teach me how to please a man and how to bear children.",
      "I have never understood how children come out of long-haired humans.",
      "One moment the humans are very fat, then they are thinner and with a small child.",
      "Are the children inside of the humans?",
      "Or do the children come from elsewhere and eat the mother's fat to grow?",
      "Is that why humans are so thin when they are very old?",
      "Oh, the mysteries of this race.",
      "Now my race.",
      "\"Aphrodite, my beauty.",
      "Aphros means foam in our Greek language and I thought it fitting since you were covered in foam when mother and I first found you.\"",
      "It mistook my perplexed face as outrage, when I was simply wondering how such a scary woman could have birthed such a kind human.",
      "\"Please, do not be angry!",
      "Do not worry for your chastity.",
      "I did not touch you inappropriately.",
      "All I did was carry you into mother's house and gave you to her so she could bathe and dress you.",
      "I did not watch!\"",
      "\"I am not worried.",
      "You are very nice and do nice things.",
      "You make me happy,\" I smiled, its patting of the place under my lower back pleasing me very much.",
      "Maybe humans are not that bad, since they can make me very happy.",
      "It grinned and lightly pinched the place it was patting.",
      "\"I'm glad, dear Aphrodite.\"",
      "Its eyes went wide when I smiled at it and it only broke out of its daze when it, Kaede, the mob of ugly humans, and I reached the cliffs.",
      "I had been too busy talking to Thene to pay attention to the walk to the cliffs.",
      "Cliffs are what humans call the slab of rock that is at a much higher than the sea, and it will kill you if you jump into the sea from one of these cliffs.",
      "Thene began telling me the story of two star-crossed lovers that jumped from these cliffs in order to be together in death since they could not marry on earth, but I was not interested in a human tale.",
      "When we reached the edge of the cliff, Thene did something very strange.",
      "He placed me on the ground, walked to the very edge, kneeled down, turned around, and slowly lowered himself down.",
      "Kaede dragged me toward the edge and I saw that some rocks jutted out more than most and Thene had used these to climb down.",
      "A very ingenious idea.",
      "These humans were cleverer than I had first thought.",
      "\"I'm ready, Mother!\"",
      "He yelled.",
      "I suppose he had to yell since he was a good distance from the top of the cliff.",
      "But what was he ready for?",
      "At this time, I was looking over the edge of the cliff and holding onto Kade.",
      "I should have known not to trust humans.",
      "Kaede smiled in its very scary way, grabbed my tentacles, and pushed me off.",
      "I screamed for less than a second until a hard, warm body caught me.",
      "Thene, my savior, cradled me against its chest until I stopped shaking.",
      "Could I not have climbed down like Thene?",
      "Did I really have to be pushed down?",
      "Does Kaede dislike me enough to want to scare me this terribly?",
      "I remember seeing these cliffs from the ocean and thinking of how beautiful they looked, but how the image of human children playing on top of them marred their beauty.",
      "I had been too far away to see the ominous metal chains welded into the rock.",
      "My fear intensified when Thene set me down, even though I very much wanted to stay in its warm tentacles, and started to chain my lower and upper tentacles.",
      "He locked the metal chains around my lower and upper tentacles with a low \"I'm so sorry, my beautiful Aphrodite.\"",
      "The chains hurt my skin very much.",
      "I did not like it.",
      "\"Kaede, Thene, may I please sit here without the chains?",
      "I will not be able to climb up anyway,\" I looked up and pleaded, trying to look as innocent as possible, but I could tell Kaede knew I was lying.",
      "It scowled at me from above.",
      "And it shook its head.",
      "Thene, on the other hand, looked completely convinced.",
      "So did most of the short-haired humans that had followed us, which were now looking over the edge of the cliff in silence.",
      "It seemed that I could only convince the younger short-haired ones.",
      "They had that awed emotion in their eyes and I think they would believe anything I say.",
      "\"Mother, I think--\" Thene tried to convince its mother, but with no avail as Kaede cut it off.",
      "\"No. I will not allow this woman to bewitch you.",
      "Leave, everyone.",
      "Now!\"",
      "Everyone shuffled back to the collection of huts further inland.",
      "Even Kaede left after glaring at me and telling me that it will \"make me disappear\" if Lord Poseidon will not accept me.",
      "I do not want to disappear, unless Kaede can turn me back into sea foam.",
      "Then I will be eternally grateful to this human.",
      "But I do not think it can do that, since it is not Lord Poseidon, and also its words left me with a bad feeling.",
      "I sat and waited for Lord Poseidon to come for me.",
      "I waited, and waited, and waited until darkness began setting in.",
      "I definitely believed in my lord, but maybe I had done something to displease him?",
      "Should I have made an offering to him as soon as I became a human?",
      "I don't think Kaede had any bulls for me to offer.",
      "A while later, as the evening wore on, I saw a huge disturbance in the ocean.",
      "The waters were twisting in a circle, like a whirlpool, and had become very dark.",
      "This continued for a few minutes until the earth started to shake and I felt the ground rumble.",
      "A three-pronged spear began to lift out of the water and a man along with it.",
      "Poseidon, Lord of the Seas, the Earth-Shaker, had finally come for me!",
      "His form soon fully emerged from the ocean and a single wave slowly raised him up to me.",
      "I should have been disappointed, for his outward appearance was that of an older human's.",
      "He had a few wrinkles on his face and a bushy white beard, but I could not describe him in a word not synonymous to magnificent or stunning.",
      "His eyes were the color of the sea.",
      "I could not tear my eyes away.",
      "Is this the emotion the humans felt when they stared at me?",
      "His mere presence demanded my respect and I willingly gave it to him.",
      "His majestic aura left me no doubt.",
      "This was my lord, the one I shall serve until I die.",
      "\"My lord,\" I whispered, crawling onto my knees in a low bow of complete submission.",
      "The wave had set him down on my slab of rock, only a foot away from me.",
      "I was so close to my revered companion, the ruler of all seas.",
      "\"Rise, Aphrodite,\" he commanded and I stood up, ignoring the shakiness in my tentacles and the pain I felt when I used them.",
      "He walked over and touched each chain.",
      "They loosened and fell to the ground.",
      "I was freed.",
      "\"Do you know why you are here?\"",
      "\"I do not, my lord.",
      "I have been faithful to you for my entire existence, and you have now turned me into a human.",
      "I do not wish to offend you, sire.",
      "I simply do not understand your intentions,\" I said to him, praying he would not be angry for doubting his actions.",
      "I could not bring myself to look in his eyes to see if he was angry.",
      "\"Look at me Aphrodite,\" he ordered and I obeyed.",
      "He did not seem angry, but I have learned looks can be deceiving.",
      "\"You have been my faithful servant for thousands of years.",
      "This is not a punishment as I know you think it is.",
      "This is a gift.",
      "You are not human.",
      "You are a goddess.",
      "You will not die until all the sea foam of earth vanishes, and for that to happen all the seas and rivers will have to dry out.",
      "That will only occur if I die.",
      "I am immortal.",
      "I will not die.",
      "You will not die.\"",
      "\"My lord...\" I trailed off, not knowing what to say.",
      "This was such an honor.",
      "Should he really have chosen me?",
      "\"You are the Olympian Goddess of Love and Beauty, but this title comes at a price.",
      "You will bring joy to all of Greece and beyond, but you will be weak.",
      "You cannot fight and will never be able to learn to do so.",
      "Should you throw a dagger, your aim will forever be crooked.",
      "Should you draw a sword, you will never hit your target.",
      "Little one, if you wish to return to sea foam, tell me now.",
      "Otherwise, I shall take you to Mount.",
      "Olympus where you will reside for the rest of eternity,\" he concluded, staring shrewdly at me.",
      "I nodded.",
      "There was not much of a choice.",
      "This was too big of an opportunity to miss.",
      "This was the chance of a lifetime.",
      "\"I will come with you my lord, and serve you and your brothers for the rest of time.\"",
      "\"I hope you keep your naivety and innocence, if only for a little while longer.",
      "It is too refreshing for a god as old as I,\" he murmurs, touching my cheek.",
      "He gently grasped my tentacle and pulled me toward him.",
      "Then the ocean rumbled once again and a giant wave enveloped my master and I. I closed my eyes, fearing what the water could do to my human, or goddess, form.",
      "When I opened them again, I found myself on above the clouds, standing on a misty surface that I should not have been able to stand on, staring at the imposing Kingdom of the Olympians.",
      "It was grand, marvelous, and nothing at all like human castles.",
      "Those had been gaudy and simply plain compared to this majestic structure.",
      "White mist reached higher than my knees and rushed through my toes, healing my aches, steadying and energizing my body.",
      "But even with the mist's power pulsing through my veins, I felt minuscule, dwarfed by the Kingdom of the Gods.",
      "Built of pearly white stone, this was the ultimate temple of worship.",
      "Beams lifted the ceiling high into the remaining clouds and I could see faces of gods carved into the outside walls.",
      "I was shocked to see my new name, Aphrodite, already engraved into one of the center beams.",
      "\"Welcome to Mount.",
      "Olympus, my child.\""

    "text": "one. the girl with the lamp Her lover comes to her at night (not every night). Semele spends the evening lighting lamps for him (so he can find his way back to her). He's a diligent lover (she's afraid that someone else is keeping him). When he comes to her (comes in her), his great hands cover her breasts and move slowly over her skin. He's so careful not to hurt her, this frail mortal in his arms (she wonders if he ever thinks of crushing her). But the only thing he has ever done (but not the only thing he could ever do) to harm her is keep his silence. Because no one else does. \"Slut,\" says Agave in the morning. Her (serpent's) tongue flicks out to taste the last of the wine on her lips. \"He loves me,\" Semele says (and today he does). \"You've brought shame on all of us,\" Ino says. Her eyes are red and swollen, her voice hoarse. A family has turned Cadmus from their door (who wants an ally who can't control his whorish daughters?). Semele lies on her bed and weeps. (He doesn't come to comfort her.) \"You could just ask him to prove it,\" says her maid, a woman of (cow-faced) calm good sense. She smiles (like a cat) at Semele's tears and presses her hand down on her stomach. \"You don't want the little one growing up fatherless.\" Her maid always knows. Semele's mouth wobbles, but she manages a grin. He comes again that night, his fierce mouth on hers (beard scratching at her throat). She begs him, gasping for breath as he ruts inside her. He says, \"yes, yes\" and \"I'll give you the world, anything\" and spends himself with a loud groan. She's not supposed to remind him of the things he says when he has his eyes closed. She does anyway. \"I want to see you as you truly are,\" she says. She'd never thought it was possible for gods to look so sick (unless he isn't a god). \"No,\" he says. \"No, no, no, no, no.\" If he were a god, then he wouldn't refuse. She says so. She asks and asks and asks and reminds him that he promised (pouting. He doesn't like women who pout. He says it makes him think of his wife). In the end, he agrees. She blinks a moment (did she knock over a lamp?) and then there's screaming, sobbing, in a voice that doesn't sound like her own. Her blood is boiling under her skin and she reaches out her flaming hands to him, the god, the king of gods, and begs with the little whimper he loved, only she's burning now, burning and the little whimper is a high-pitched keening that won't ever stop. \"He dreams only of hunting,\" Actaeon's mother says fondly. Actaeon, lying in the grass, knows it's not true. He dreams of many things, like flying and games of discus (and of his aunt, Semele, in the arms of Zeus). He has left his dogs to run wild and his horse to drink its fill at the river while he sprawls on the ground, listening to the bees and the whisper of flowers. He almost falls asleep, lazy (drowning in life). After a long time, he thinks he might go and find his horse before it guzzles itself to death (he's bored). Actaeon ambles along the bank until he comes to the pool where he left it: a glade of unspeakable beauty, with the white willows leaning over the shining silver waters, trailing their weeping branches. He recognises the lush green of the grass, and the rippling surface must be - The shock hits him, thrumming through his veins and he can hear his heart beating in his ears. He opens his mouth to speak, but his throat is dry. He should be dead now, burning in the wrath of a goddess; he should be dead now, but he feels keenly alive, trembling with delight and fear and desire. His cock is growing, now so hard he thinks it might burst with wanting it. She is naked, not the commonplace nudity of hetairai, but a deadly secret he has come upon; he has profaned the purity of Artemis (his cock jerks). The maiden, marble and untouchable stands six feet away, her skin flushed and tanned, a trickle of water sliding over her breast. Her clothes lie discarded on the other side of the pool and she is looking at them, her gaze cool and unconcerned (he thinks of her wrapped around him, crying out in ectasy). Actaeon watches the play of water over her skin, coalescing round one perfect nipple, or skimming the rounded curve of her breast. The moisture glistening between her legs is from bathing, or not from bathing, he can't think, he can't decide. She decides for him. One stride and she has his chiton in her powerful grip, bringing their faces together. This close, her scent would drive any animal mad; at the end of the day, Actaeon is only an animal like any other. He covers her mouth with his, forcefully, and is rewarded when she pulls him tighter against her. And then the game changes and Actaeon is flung to the floor; he gasps for breath. She is on him a moment later, pushing against him. There has never been anything like this for Actaeon. He hears his chiton rip and feels the warm breeze on his cock before Artemis, straddling him, smiles and glides up his body. He bucks up, kissing her between her legs and hears her pleased sigh. Bolder, he lifts his face to her curls and she presses down. He finds the bud at the apex of her thighs and his tongue flicks out to taste it. High above him somewhere, she moans, and the smell of her lust is overwhelming. Actaeon whimpers against her, loving the pain of her fingers tangled in his hair, and she forces herself down harder against his lips, again and again until she writhes suddenly with a loud cry. She falls back against his chest, her glossy black hair brushing against his cock. His hips buck and his breath catches in his throat as he gazes at her, her fair brow gleaming with sweat. \"Goddess,\" he whispers. It's a prayer, and Artemis opens her eyes to smile, sly and half-satisfied. She moves back down his torso and sits on his knees, holding him down. He wants, with a desperation until now unknown to him, to flip them over, to push her down and fuck a goddess with all the lust left in him, to thrust until she comes again, this time screaming his name. He tries to buck again, but he can't move, held by iron will and iron wrists. \"Now,\" Artemis says, and smiles. She's careful about it (like a virgin, not like a virgin should be), but she moans in pleasure as she slides down his cock. She squirms vigorously until she's firmly seated, making approving noises all the way, which make Actaeon pant with the effort of not begging. Her hands on his chest push him into the grass as she begins to grind against him. Every time he tries to rear up, to take control, she forces him down more brutally into the ground, biting or scratching him as punishment. Once, she puts her fingers to a nipple and twists; Actaeon screams, half-insane with craving her. For his response, she allows him to thrust up once into her taut, athletic body, before shoving him back down to take her own pleasure. Actaeon is blind with desire. He thinks (if he does think) about sacrifice sacrifice sacrifice; Goddess, I'll spend my days prostrate to feel this again. But now, now, there is only Artemis and wild ardour. Longing and recklessness overtaking sense, he grasps Artemis by the hair to pull her down for a kiss; livid at his presumption, perhaps, she crushes her mouth against his, stealing his breath. Then she rears back on her heels, slamming her hips down viciously, more violent than a woman ever could be. Actaeon is screaming again, a sound less human than the goddess above him; he thinks it might be begging for mercy, for climax, for her. His hands are allowed to find her hips, to help her as she hammers down on his cock, squeezing and flexing. Finally, she throws her head back with a passionate cry, with a shudder so intense that she trembles all through her body and Actaeon can feel it. He's keening, he knows it, as he drives up into her - - and is suddenly cold and bereft. He comes with a shout, splattering all over himself and Artemis as she stands up. She smoothes her hands over her breasts in a movement so lewd Actaeon half-believes his empty cock twitches. She touches a fingertip to the semen on her slender, muscled inner thigh and tastes it delicately; Actaeon once more forgets to breathe. \"Not unpleasant,\" she says, considering. \"I still don't see what the fuss is about.\" Actaeon watches her move, dreamlike, through the water of the pool. She shakes herself dry and dresses in a trice, then crosses back towards him. \"A blessing, first,\" she says. \"You shall die participating in the sport you love most.\" She traces a finger down his stomach, smiling. \"And if you ever open your mouth to speak again, of this or anything else, I will punish you.\" Actaeon only whimpers, conscious of the bitemarks on his chest and the scratches on his shoulder. The sun is red and low in the sky when he can first bring himself to move. The goddess Artemis has left him sore and wanting and he begins to limp home, horse in tow. Without thinking, he turns to call for his dogs. Someone - some woman - is screaming. \"Bacchus, euoi!\" They are mad, these women. They must be, to strip themselves like that, to writhe in ecstasy, to shriek so piercingly. Pentheus pictures one in his mind: her rich, sky-blue chiton torn to expose her breasts; her dark hair wild and uncontrolled; her sinuous movements on the ground. He imagines his mother like that. \"You Thebans,\" the stranger says. His eyes are black like spilled ink, his mouth painted and his skin pale like a woman's. It makes Pentheus sick to look at him; the bottom drops out of his stomach and his tongue goes dry. \"What is it about you and mothers?\" \"Never mention her name,\" Pentheus manages, rage thankfully overcoming illness. \"I didn't,\" says the stranger, spreading out his hands with a harmless smile. It's not harmless at all; it frightens Pentheus. At least, fear is a better name for it than anything else. \"Why don't we talk about mine, instead?\" \"I know what your mother is,\" Pentheus says contemptuously. \"She's another of your whores.\" The stranger's hand comes up; never let it be said Pentheus flinches from a blow. But the stranger only puts his hand to Pentheus's cheek, gentle, even a caress. \"Oh,\" he says, hardly a breath. \"I hoped you'd say that.\" Pentheus does take a step back from this, the sickness rising in his chest. It's too late; he feels feverish already, his chest thumping so hard it almost hurts. \"Don't touch me.\" \"Why?\" The stranger is watching him, his head tilted on one side. \"What do you fear?\" Pentheus fears nothing. \"You were going to take me to your bacchants,\" he spits. \"Where are they?\" \"The bacchae will tear you apart if they see you like this,\" the stranger says. \"Let me dress you first.\" Pentheus hesitates, remembers the stranger's accusation of cowardice, and flushes. \"Do it, then.\" \"Isn't it lucky,\" the stranger remarks, cheerful as ever. \"I have something in your size.\" It turns out to be red. Pentheus holds the linen in his hands; seen through half-closed eyes, it looks like a river of blood. The stranger dresses him slowly, carefully. Every movement seems deliberate, wrapping him assiduously in the folds of scarlet cloth. There must be something wrong with him; he feels dizzy on today of all days. He has work to do. But not now. The stranger is running his long-fingered hands down Pentheus's chest. \"What -?\" \"Just a thought,\" the stranger says, smiling. He nuzzles Pentheus's ear and Pentheus lets him. It even seems like a good idea. He can find out things, if the stranger wants him. He lets his head fall back. The stranger's mouth is hot and wet on his throat and his hands seem to be everywhere, stroking and squeezing. Pentheus tries to kiss him, but the stranger laughs soft and low, and turns his face away. \"Is this - \" part of the disguise, he wants to say. The stranger seems to hear him. \"People will see you are a lover of the god,\" he says, warm and reassuring. But, Pentheus wants to say. He doesn't get much further than that. The stranger's hands are where they shouldn't be, and he feels feverish again. The heat, that must be it, which makes his bones heavy and his body lazy. He itches all over. The stranger has him in his grip. Pentheus cries out, and hopes the slaves didn't hear him. He thinks of them coming inside - to see what is wrong; and what is wrong is everything, their king in the hands of a rebel leader, their king undone by a girlish man. \"This is when the women are at their peak,\" the stranger murmurs. \"This is the zenith of their madness. Let me show you.\" I am a sane and reasonable man, Pentheus thinks, and then, twisting and moaning in the stranger's arms, doesn't think at all. The backs of his eyelids burn bright from the sun; he can hear a voice not his own sobbing out breath after breath while the stranger's grasp grows punishing and a lesser man would beg for mercy. He licks his upper lip and tastes his own salty sweat. Finally, with his face buried in the stranger's shoulder, he feels the splash of semen soaking his peplos and the scent of it catches his nose. \"That is the sign by which they shall know you,\" says the stranger, chuckling at some private joke. \"And all - all the women are like this?\" \"When they feel like it,\" says the stranger with a shrug. \"Come with me now, and they will dance with you in their arms.\" \"Will they love me?\" \"As much as they love their own sons,\" says the stranger. \"Will they - \" even with the stranger's breath in his ear and his fingers stroking his nipple, Pentheus can't quite say it. But the stranger knows his heart intimately. \"They'll all want a piece of you,\" he says. Pentheus looks at himself in the polished silver mirror, leaning back against the stranger. He looks curious and unlike a man, unlike a king. His face is reddened and his mouth curved oddly, upturned. If he didn't feel so peculiar, he would demand of the stranger what he had done. But he does trust him. The stranger has not led him wrong yet, so Pentheus takes his outstretched hand and lets him lead him from the room.",

      "She squirms vigorously until she's firmly seated, making approving noises all the way, which make Actaeon pant with the effort of not begging.",
      "Her hands on his chest push him into the grass as she begins to grind against him.",
      "Every time he tries to rear up, to take control, she forces him down more brutally into the ground, biting or scratching him as punishment.",
      "Once, she puts her fingers to a nipple and twists; Actaeon screams, half-insane with craving her.",
      "For his response, she allows him to thrust up once into her taut, athletic body, before shoving him back down to take her own pleasure.",
      "Actaeon is blind with desire.",
      "He thinks (if he does think) about sacrifice sacrifice sacrifice; Goddess, I'll spend my days prostrate to feel this again.",
      "But now, now, there is only Artemis and wild ardour.",
      "Longing and recklessness overtaking sense, he grasps Artemis by the hair to pull her down for a kiss; livid at his presumption, perhaps, she crushes her mouth against his, stealing his breath.",
      "Then she rears back on her heels, slamming her hips down viciously, more violent than a woman ever could be.",
      "Actaeon is screaming again, a sound less human than the goddess above him; he thinks it might be begging for mercy, for climax, for her.",
      "His hands are allowed to find her hips, to help her as she hammers down on his cock, squeezing and flexing.",
      "Finally, she throws her head back with a passionate cry, with a shudder so intense that she trembles all through her body and Actaeon can feel it.",
      "He's keening, he knows it, as he drives up into her - - and is suddenly cold and bereft.",
      "He comes with a shout, splattering all over himself and Artemis as she stands up.",
      "She smoothes her hands over her breasts in a movement so lewd Actaeon half-believes his empty cock twitches.",
      "She touches a fingertip to the semen on her slender, muscled inner thigh and tastes it delicately; Actaeon once more forgets to breathe.",
      "\"Not unpleasant,\" she says, considering.",
      "\"I still don't see what the fuss is about.\"",
      "Actaeon watches her move, dreamlike, through the water of the pool.",
      "She shakes herself dry and dresses in a trice, then crosses back towards him.",
      "\"A blessing, first,\" she says.",
      "\"You shall die participating in the sport you love most.\"",
      "She traces a finger down his stomach, smiling.",
      "\"And if you ever open your mouth to speak again, of this or anything else, I will punish you.\"",
      "Actaeon only whimpers, conscious of the bitemarks on his chest and the scratches on his shoulder.",
      "The sun is red and low in the sky when he can first bring himself to move.",
      "The goddess Artemis has left him sore and wanting and he begins to limp home, horse in tow.",
      "Without thinking, he turns to call for his dogs.",
      "Someone - some woman - is screaming.",
      "\"Bacchus, euoi!\"",
      "They are mad, these women.",
      "They must be, to strip themselves like that, to writhe in ecstasy, to shriek so piercingly.",
      "Pentheus pictures one in his mind: her rich, sky-blue chiton torn to expose her breasts; her dark hair wild and uncontrolled; her sinuous movements on the ground.",
      "He imagines his mother like that.",
      "\"You Thebans,\" the stranger says.",
      "His eyes are black like spilled ink, his mouth painted and his skin pale like a woman's.",
      "It makes Pentheus sick to look at him; the bottom drops out of his stomach and his tongue goes dry.",
      "\"What is it about you and mothers?\"",
      "\"Never mention her name,\" Pentheus manages, rage thankfully overcoming illness.",
      "\"I didn't,\" says the stranger, spreading out his hands with a harmless smile.",
      "It's not harmless at all; it frightens Pentheus.",
      "At least, fear is a better name for it than anything else.",
      "\"Why don't we talk about mine, instead?\"",
      "\"I know what your mother is,\" Pentheus says contemptuously.",
      "\"She's another of your whores.\"",
      "The stranger's hand comes up; never let it be said Pentheus flinches from a blow.",
      "But the stranger only puts his hand to Pentheus's cheek, gentle, even a caress.",
      "\"Oh,\" he says, hardly a breath.",
      "\"I hoped you'd say that.\"",
      "Pentheus does take a step back from this, the sickness rising in his chest.",
      "It's too late; he feels feverish already, his chest thumping so hard it almost hurts.",
      "\"Don't touch me.\"",
      "\"Why?\"",
      "The stranger is watching him, his head tilted on one side.",
      "\"What do you fear?\"",
      "Pentheus fears nothing.",
      "\"You were going to take me to your bacchants,\" he spits.",
      "\"Where are they?\"",
      "\"The bacchae will tear you apart if they see you like this,\" the stranger says.",
      "\"Let me dress you first.\"",
      "Pentheus hesitates, remembers the stranger's accusation of cowardice, and flushes.",
      "\"Do it, then.\"",
      "\"Isn't it lucky,\" the stranger remarks, cheerful as ever.",
      "\"I have something in your size.\"",
      "It turns out to be red.",
      "Pentheus holds the linen in his hands; seen through half-closed eyes, it looks like a river of blood.",
      "The stranger dresses him slowly, carefully.",
      "Every movement seems deliberate, wrapping him assiduously in the folds of scarlet cloth.",
      "There must be something wrong with him; he feels dizzy on today of all days.",
      "He has work to do.",
      "But not now.",
      "The stranger is running his long-fingered hands down Pentheus's chest.",
      "\"What -?\"",
      "\"Just a thought,\" the stranger says, smiling.",
      "He nuzzles Pentheus's ear and Pentheus lets him.",
      "It even seems like a good idea.",
      "He can find out things, if the stranger wants him.",
      "He lets his head fall back.",
      "The stranger's mouth is hot and wet on his throat and his hands seem to be everywhere, stroking and squeezing.",
      "Pentheus tries to kiss him, but the stranger laughs soft and low, and turns his face away.",
      "\"Is this - \" part of the disguise, he wants to say.",
      "The stranger seems to hear him.",
      "\"People will see you are a lover of the god,\" he says, warm and reassuring.",
      "But, Pentheus wants to say.",
      "He doesn't get much further than that.",
      "The stranger's hands are where they shouldn't be, and he feels feverish again.",
      "The heat, that must be it, which makes his bones heavy and his body lazy.",
      "He itches all over.",
      "The stranger has him in his grip.",
      "Pentheus cries out, and hopes the slaves didn't hear him.",
      "He thinks of them coming inside - to see what is wrong; and what is wrong is everything, their king in the hands of a rebel leader, their king undone by a girlish man.",
      "\"This is when the women are at their peak,\" the stranger murmurs.",
      "\"This is the zenith of their madness.",
      "Let me show you.\"",
      "I am a sane and reasonable man, Pentheus thinks, and then, twisting and moaning in the stranger's arms, doesn't think at all.",
      "The backs of his eyelids burn bright from the sun; he can hear a voice not his own sobbing out breath after breath while the stranger's grasp grows punishing and a lesser man would beg for mercy.",
      "He licks his upper lip and tastes his own salty sweat.",
      "Finally, with his face buried in the stranger's shoulder, he feels the splash of semen soaking his peplos and the scent of it catches his nose.",
      "\"That is the sign by which they shall know you,\" says the stranger, chuckling at some private joke.",
      "\"And all - all the women are like this?\"",
      "\"When they feel like it,\" says the stranger with a shrug.",
      "\"Come with me now, and they will dance with you in their arms.\"",
      "\"Will they love me?\"",
      "\"As much as they love their own sons,\" says the stranger.",
      "\"Will they - \" even with the stranger's breath in his ear and his fingers stroking his nipple, Pentheus can't quite say it.",
      "But the stranger knows his heart intimately.",
      "\"They'll all want a piece of you,\" he says.",
      "Pentheus looks at himself in the polished silver mirror, leaning back against the stranger.",
      "He looks curious and unlike a man, unlike a king.",
      "His face is reddened and his mouth curved oddly, upturned.",
      "If he didn't feel so peculiar, he would demand of the stranger what he had done.",
      "But he does trust him.",
      "The stranger has not led him wrong yet, so Pentheus takes his outstretched hand and lets him lead him from the room."

    "text": "Phlegethon (the river of fire) Hell is what you make it - this, Hades knows, is true. There are cities here, and there are eternal plains. There are wastelands and forests and deep seas. He has walked them for eons, and he never grows tired of his ever-changing domain. Let Zeus have the heavens and Poseidon the sea. Let the rest of the Dodekatheon squabble over the earth - he still possesses them all, within his kingdom. And for better or worse - depending on your point of view - he shares his kingdom with the souls of the dead. Call it what you will: Hell. Sheol. Jahannam. Naraka. Gehenna. Dis. The House of the Lie. Tartarus. It matters not. Sooner or later, every soul who is born with Hera's blessing, who travels Poseidon's seas, who makes love under Apollo and Artemis's skies, who drinks the wine of Dionysus... eventually, they come to him. Sometimes they plead, curse, and rage, bargaining with Charon for passage back to the world above. Sometimes they fall at his feet, thanking him for deliverance. He almost prefers their anger, when their throats open up and howl, because then they shine. They come so close to godhood in it; a pure, blinding rage that pierces truer than one of his niece's arrows. He and the other gods are creatures of Destruction, who must not touch mankind too deeply. Icarus fell when he soared too close to the sun - the legends still tell of this. Humans forget that once, the sun was Helios, and a god. For humans and gods do not, can not, ever come to any good. Apollo has learned this. Poseidon has learned this. You'd think that Zeus would have figured it out over the milennia, but Hades' younger brother has always been obstinate and more than a little blind to the idiosyncracies of humanity. Hades knows this, though, because it is his job. To come close enough to those souls that reside in his kingdom and watch them burn. Listen to every scream out of every throat and hear every plea for forgiveness. He's gotten so accomplished at it, he can differentiate between the heretics and the sowers of discord; between the wood of suicides and the gluttonous. The screams of the fire-bringer, though. Those are like nothing else. Hades wishes he could block them out. ~*~*~*~ Cocytus (the river of lamentation) It was a perfect and brilliant solution then. It's all a blur to him now. He'd watched her for years - remembers her birth and how radiant Demeter glowed as she held her baby daughter. Hades had kissed his sister, wishing her well, and inquiring why such a beautiful child would be named \"pursuit of grief\". Don't they have a saying about how children will always make you cry before you laugh? she'd responded, laying a hand atop his. I expect much laughter, so I thought I would prepare myself for the grief. Prophecy had never run in the family before - not that branch, at least. Apollo was a different matter. But it hadn't changed anything - Demeter had been more right than he'd ever suspected. He remembers her, barely out of childhood, serious and calm, explaining the rules of a game to a few wood nymphs. Recalls the sound of her laughter as a young woman, trading jests with Hermes about the Spartans. Memorized the exact reshaping and fullness that occurred in her body when she passed into womanhood. Youthful innocence blossoming into true beauty, and it drove him mad to possess even a small part of that beauty. He's not proud of the kidnapping. Nor is he proud of forcing her, that first time. She was bowed below him, shuddering and pleading, and then a sound echoed from her. A pure keen of heartbreak and loss, and it had finally pierced the possessive haze surrounding him. He'd frozen, moving to his side and gathering her into his arms. She pressed her face, wet with tears, into his chest - he'd never even noticed she was crying - and let him console her before curling into a ball and falling asleep. That lament had echoed throughout the whole of hell, and it still rung when he rose the next morning and walked the banks of Acheron. Standing there on the bank of the river, it occurred to him that he'd done her wrong - no matter how beautiful, she was the daughter of his sister and his brother, and she deserved more than possession. It took time, but she stopped crying. Consented to walking with him along Lethe's banks or sitting in his palace to hear grievances. He showed her the Elysian Fields and Isle of the Blest, but it wasn't long before she actually requested to visit the Wood of Suicides and the Malebolge. She wanted to learn every aspect of his domain, she said, if she was to stay here with him. On the seventh day, she took a bite of pomengranate, spat four seeds into her palm, and kissed him. Beneath the taste of her lips and pomengranate, beyond the softness of her body against his and the flutter of her dress against his feet, he hears it again. That cry, and he realizes it's not coming from her: it's Demeter, calling for her lost child. Zeus comes to him the next day, Hermes beside him, and they negotiate the terms - Persephone will spend eight months on the earth and four in his kingdom. He could argue, but his sister's grief and his brother's temper force his hand. For Persephone, he's willing to compromise, and that scares him more than anything ever has. Now, those eight months pass in what seems like an endless trudge. He does his duty as a monarch each day, and returns to his empty palace each night. But then the ninth month comes, and the smell of fresh grass and flowers creeps into the Eternal City. He can tell she's returned before he even ventures into his chambers to find her there, warm from the sun and speaking of what she's done in the interregnum. Then, it was necessity and brute force. It was constant fighting and soothing tempers and a good deal of tentative reaching-out. Now, it is companionable silences or spirited arguments. It is easy banter and pragmatic decisions they share between them. He knows she'll never tell him how much she misses her mother and the sun for those four months. And he'll never tell her that he would have given up everything - his title, his power, all the wealth in his kingdom, even his immortality - for even just a day more with her. It's not love, but even Aphrodite would admit it's close. ~*~*~*~ Styx (the river of hate) When he closes his eyes, he can see the man as he was once. Hades still wonders if Thetis knew what she was doing, anointing a son like that with Stygian protection. He'd given his consent for her to immerse the child, but as he'd sat on the shore, listening to the startlingly shrill cries of the infant, he'd almost stopped her. Humans are fragile - of course Hades knows this. It would be impossible not to, with all the ways they manage to find their way to him. But this boy-child is staring at his kingdom with widened brown eyes and huddling closer to his mother's breast, absolutely terrified. This is the prophesied savior child of Peleus and Thetis, the feared future king of the Myrmidons? Why do you wish this, Thetis?, Hades had asked. She had stared him down, so strongly reminiscent of his Persephone that he'd taken a step back. Because he is my son, Rich One. If I do not protect him from the Sky-Father and the Ocean Lord, who will? Who, indeed? If he allows her to go through with this, his younger brother will not see it as protection. Zeus will see it as Hades' continued meddling in what should be a personal matter: Thetis spurned Zeus and Poseidon, but went to Hades of her own volition. Considering the tongue-lashing Hades received over his treatment of Hercules, he feels a little payback is in order. But yes, though he can be as petty and as judgmental as the other gods, there is a reason one of his epithets is \"the just one\". Everyone comes to him in the end, even the other gods. He had watched as the black waters closed over Achilles' head. Watched as the boy emerged, glowing with immortality and uncrying. Apotheosis strips you to the core - Hercules told him that once, standing at Ceberus's gates - takes what you were and makes you into what you need to be. Achilles needed to be the strongest, physically and mentally, and he'd met the gaze of the Lord of the Dead completely, all fear gone from those fathomless eyes. It was then that Hades began to hate him. Achilles grew into manhood, and the souls he culled from the earth in his travels of war told Hades of his ferocity when they reached his palace of judgment. Told him that Achilles had spoken his name as he'd killed them. Greet Lord Hades for me, when you see him. It became a game between them - the number of men Achilles killed pitted against which souls Hades accepted and which he cast out to wander the earth as shades. Patroclus had not been one that Hades wished to cast out, but Hector's treatment of his body had left Charon no choice but to leave him on the shore of the living. When Achilles cut Hector down, Hades heard the entreaties of Priam and Hecuba and Paris - give us justice on the man who desecrates our son, our brother. Justice, then. All it had taken was a reminder to Apollo, and then a whispered command into the ear of Paris. One shot to an exposed flaw. Thetis's protection had failed, and Achilles welcomed into the kingdom of the dead. Hades hears the criticism, but the choice went to Charon, and Achilles had carried his obolus like every other soul. That little snipe Achilles made while speaking with Odysseus was ungrateful of him, but then again, what good is a beaten enemy? ~*~*~*~ Acheron (the river of sorrow) He'd always hated the lyre. Many musicians dwell in his kingdom - hell does have all the best music - but none had ever impressed him. When you've only got six strings to work with, what can you really express? Then came Orpheus. When the son of dreams played his lyre, it was like nothing Hades had ever heard. Orpheus had come to plead for the return of his lady love, and when his music floated over the Lake of Fire and the Elysian Fields alike, all of Hell listened. The boy's fingers ran over the instrument, and the sounds that issued forth were like nothing Hades had ever known. Minor chords wept along with Orpheus, and crescendoed over the silent Eternal City. Orpheus begun to sing - a haunting, beautiful melody about the unfairness of love and the hope of reunion (it would have been manipulative of him if his love for the girl weren't so obviously, painfully pure) - and before he knew it, his wife's hand had covered his. Persephone never expressed affection in public. Ever. His lovely, fallen goddess had crafted herself into the feared Iron Queen. The pitiless ruler of the underworld whose justice was harsher than even his own. It was better to be despised, she had told him once, than pitied. She was no child yearning for her mother; her choice had been made. But this song, this lament for a stolen woman, had touched her in a way that he never could have done. And so they broke the rules for this boy, to give him the second chance he'd earned. Persephone had brought the girl from the banks of Acheron, where Charon had first ferried her across, and given Orpheus the instructions - his faith would have to carry him through the kingdom of the dead, and nothing else. Hades had thought it harsh of Persephone, but she'd been implacable, and so he'd pointed the boy to the path he'd need to climb to the upper entrance to his domain. Hell was quiet - had been ever since the last note had been plucked from Orpheus's lyre - and so his wail of loss echoed across the underworld. Persephone's eyes closed next to him, a quiet sigh of disappointment breathed out amid the lamentation for Eurydice. Do not let him plead his case again, my lord, she'd said, rising from her throne. I do not wish to see her so disappointed a second time. He hadn't asked why she was so sure that it was Orpheus's lack of faith that doomed him. Why she knew that, had he granted Orpheus another chance, he would again doubt that Eurydice was with him. The girl was now under his wife's protection, and not even he dared to incur her wrath when it came to lost women. He had sins of his own to atone for. ~*~*~*~ Lethe (the river of forgetfulness) It took one day - one single, human day - for everything to change. On this day, he'd found the main Gates wide open, Cerberus curled in a corner whimpering, and a man in Judean garb awaiting his presence. Hades knew prophets and princes when he saw them, and the man certainly carried himself well, but this man was no mere prophet. He looked - not like one of Hades's own breathren, but like Hercules, like Achilles. The man invited him to sit - invited him, in his own palace, and if that wasn't warning enough, he didn't know what else would have convinced him - and they took seats on the smooth slate ground beneath the Gates. Cerberus, snuffling and nosing at Hades's side, the big baby, laid between them, and the Judean absently scratched at the dog's ruff above the left head before speaking. You know what I'm here for, Lord Hades. No epithets. No fearful titles of placation and flattery. Just his name, and it didn't sound strange at all from this thin, wide-eyed halfling. And he couldn't pretend the man wasn't right - he knew, had known since he'd seen him. Why are you still here, then? Take your souls and go. I have no quarrel with you, nor with your followers. I wanted to speak to you, he answered simply. And they did, the Judean asking this question or that question about various souls in his kingdom. Telling him a rather amusing parable about a rich man and his servant. Listening as Hades spoke of how Persephone had been rather off-color recently (gods couldn't get sick, per se, but even they had their less-than-healthy days). The man was easy to talk to - very much like Odysseus, actually - and, had Hades known of his importance, he'd have fallen at the man's feet and begged him to be spared what was to come. As it was, the man had turned just outside the Gates. I am truly sorry, Lord Hades, for what my coming brings. I wish you and your Persephone well. The Gates closed, and Hell changed. It became harsher and kinder in turns as the humans believed they were more or less worthy of punishment. Elysium's groves of olive trees grew tall, then disappeared altogether, to be replaced by first vines of grapes, then by fields of wheat. The great rivers began to dry up and form a central lake - sometimes of flame, sometimes of ice - then flowed once again. His palace grew from a majestic onyx fortress into a twisted crimson abattoir, and it had taken him centuries to gather enough power to wrest it back to his control again. He'd always disliked the color red, but the belief heralded by the Judean's followers was pervasive. Soon after, Persephone faded away altogether. He shut himself away in his sorrow, letting the underworld do with itself what it would. He had his palace, Cerberus lazing across the threshold, and the spectre of Persephone to mourn. As the centuries passed, there were fewer and fewer souls who remembered him as the vibrant, fair ruler of the ever-changing lands - not the sullen, brooding guardian of a place of torment. The epithets changed as well, and he became entwined with another feared guardian of souls. They called him Morningstar, now, and with that knowledge, he waited. Time was one thing he did have left.",

      "He's gotten so accomplished at it, he can differentiate between the heretics and the sowers of discord; between the wood of suicides and the gluttonous.",
      "The screams of the fire-bringer, though.",
      "Those are like nothing else.",
      "Hades wishes he could block them out.",
      "~*~*~*~ Cocytus (the river of lamentation)",
      "It was a perfect and brilliant solution then.",
      "It's all a blur to him now.",
      "He'd watched her for years - remembers her birth and how radiant Demeter glowed as she held her baby daughter.",
      "Hades had kissed his sister, wishing her well, and inquiring why such a beautiful child would be named \"pursuit of grief\".",
      "Don't they have a saying about how children will always make you cry before you laugh?",
      "she'd responded, laying a hand atop his.",
      "I expect much laughter, so I thought I would prepare myself for the grief.",
      "Prophecy had never run in the family before - not that branch, at least.",
      "Apollo was a different matter.",
      "But it hadn't changed anything - Demeter had been more right than he'd ever suspected.",
      "He remembers her, barely out of childhood, serious and calm, explaining the rules of a game to a few wood nymphs.",
      "Recalls the sound of her laughter as a young woman, trading jests with Hermes about the Spartans.",
      "Memorized the exact reshaping and fullness that occurred in her body when she passed into womanhood.",
      "Youthful innocence blossoming into true beauty, and it drove him mad to possess even a small part of that beauty.",
      "He's not proud of the kidnapping.",
      "Nor is he proud of forcing her, that first time.",
      "She was bowed below him, shuddering and pleading, and then a sound echoed from her.",
      "A pure keen of heartbreak and loss, and it had finally pierced the possessive haze surrounding him.",
      "He'd frozen, moving to his side and gathering her into his arms.",
      "She pressed her face, wet with tears, into his chest - he'd never even noticed she was crying - and let him console her before curling into a ball and falling asleep.",
      "That lament had echoed throughout the whole of hell, and it still rung when he rose the next morning and walked the banks of Acheron.",
      "Standing there on the bank of the river, it occurred to him that he'd done her wrong - no matter how beautiful, she was the daughter of his sister and his brother, and she deserved more than possession.",
      "It took time, but she stopped crying.",
      "Consented to walking with him along Lethe's banks or sitting in his palace to hear grievances.",
      "He showed her the Elysian Fields and Isle of the Blest, but it wasn't long before she actually requested to visit the Wood of Suicides and the Malebolge.",
      "She wanted to learn every aspect of his domain, she said, if she was to stay here with him.",
      "On the seventh day, she took a bite of pomengranate, spat four seeds into her palm, and kissed him.",
      "Beneath the taste of her lips and pomengranate, beyond the softness of her body against his and the flutter of her dress against his feet, he hears it again.",
      "That cry, and he realizes it's not coming from her: it's Demeter, calling for her lost child.",
      "Zeus comes to him the next day, Hermes beside him, and they negotiate the terms - Persephone will spend eight months on the earth and four in his kingdom.",
      "He could argue, but his sister's grief and his brother's temper force his hand.",
      "For Persephone, he's willing to compromise, and that scares him more than anything ever has.",
      "Now, those eight months pass in what seems like an endless trudge.",
      "He does his duty as a monarch each day, and returns to his empty palace each night.",
      "But then the ninth month comes, and the smell of fresh grass and flowers creeps into the Eternal City.",
      "He can tell she's returned before he even ventures into his chambers to find her there, warm from the sun and speaking of what she's done in the interregnum.",
      "Then, it was necessity and brute force.",
      "It was constant fighting and soothing tempers and a good deal of tentative reaching-out.",
      "Now, it is companionable silences or spirited arguments.",
      "It is easy banter and pragmatic decisions they share between them.",
      "He knows she'll never tell him how much she misses her mother and the sun for those four months.",
      "And he'll never tell her that he would have given up everything - his title, his power, all the wealth in his kingdom, even his immortality - for even just a day more with her.",
      "It's not love, but even Aphrodite would admit it's close.",
      "~*~*~*~ Styx (the river of hate)",
      "When he closes his eyes, he can see the man as he was once.",
      "Hades still wonders if Thetis knew what she was doing, anointing a son like that with Stygian protection.",
      "He'd given his consent for her to immerse the child, but as he'd sat on the shore, listening to the startlingly shrill cries of the infant, he'd almost stopped her.",
      "Humans are fragile - of course Hades knows this.",
      "It would be impossible not to, with all the ways they manage to find their way to him.",
      "But this boy-child is staring at his kingdom with widened brown eyes and huddling closer to his mother's breast, absolutely terrified.",
      "This is the prophesied savior child of Peleus and Thetis, the feared future king of the Myrmidons?",
      "Why do you wish this, Thetis?, Hades had asked.",
      "She had stared him down, so strongly reminiscent of his Persephone that he'd taken a step back.",
      "Because he is my son, Rich One.",
      "If I do not protect him from the Sky-Father and the Ocean Lord, who will?",
      "Who, indeed?",
      "If he allows her to go through with this, his younger brother will not see it as protection.",
      "Zeus will see it as Hades' continued meddling in what should be a personal matter: Thetis spurned Zeus and Poseidon, but went to Hades of her own volition.",
      "Considering the tongue-lashing Hades received over his treatment of Hercules, he feels a little payback is in order.",
      "But yes, though he can be as petty and as judgmental as the other gods, there is a reason one of his epithets is \"the just one\".",
      "Everyone comes to him in the end, even the other gods.",
      "He had watched as the black waters closed over Achilles' head.",
      "Watched as the boy emerged, glowing with immortality and uncrying.",
      "Apotheosis strips you to the core - Hercules told him that once, standing at Ceberus's gates - takes what you were and makes you into what you need to be.",
      "Achilles needed to be the strongest, physically and mentally, and he'd met the gaze of the Lord of the Dead completely, all fear gone from those fathomless eyes.",
      "It was then that Hades began to hate him.",
      "Achilles grew into manhood, and the souls he culled from the earth in his travels of war told Hades of his ferocity when they reached his palace of judgment.",
      "Told him that Achilles had spoken his name as he'd killed them.",
      "Greet Lord Hades for me, when you see him.",
      "It became a game between them - the number of men Achilles killed pitted against which souls Hades accepted and which he cast out to wander the earth as shades.",
      "Patroclus had not been one that Hades wished to cast out, but Hector's treatment of his body had left Charon no choice but to leave him on the shore of the living.",
      "When Achilles cut Hector down, Hades heard the entreaties of Priam and Hecuba and Paris - give us justice on the man who desecrates our son, our brother.",
      "Justice, then.",
      "All it had taken was a reminder to Apollo, and then a whispered command into the ear of Paris.",
      "One shot to an exposed flaw.",
      "Thetis's protection had failed, and Achilles welcomed into the kingdom of the dead.",
      "Hades hears the criticism, but the choice went to Charon, and Achilles had carried his obolus like every other soul.",
      "That little snipe Achilles made while speaking with Odysseus was ungrateful of him, but then again, what good is a beaten enemy?",
      "~*~*~*~ Acheron (the river of sorrow)",
      "He'd always hated the lyre.",
      "Many musicians dwell in his kingdom - hell does have all the best music - but none had ever impressed him.",
      "When you've only got six strings to work with, what can you really express?",
      "Then came Orpheus.",
      "When the son of dreams played his lyre, it was like nothing Hades had ever heard.",
      "Orpheus had come to plead for the return of his lady love, and when his music floated over the Lake of Fire and the Elysian Fields alike, all of Hell listened.",
      "The boy's fingers ran over the instrument, and the sounds that issued forth were like nothing Hades had ever known.",
      "Minor chords wept along with Orpheus, and crescendoed over the silent Eternal City.",
      "Orpheus begun to sing - a haunting, beautiful melody about the unfairness of love and the hope of reunion (it would have been manipulative of him if his love for the girl weren't so obviously, painfully pure) - and before he knew it, his wife's hand had covered his.",
      "Persephone never expressed affection in public.",
      "Ever.",
      "His lovely, fallen goddess had crafted herself into the feared Iron Queen.",
      "The pitiless ruler of the underworld whose justice was harsher than even his own.",
      "It was better to be despised, she had told him once, than pitied.",
      "She was no child yearning for her mother; her choice had been made.",
      "But this song, this lament for a stolen woman, had touched her in a way that he never could have done.",
      "And so they broke the rules for this boy, to give him the second chance he'd earned.",
      "Persephone had brought the girl from the banks of Acheron, where Charon had first ferried her across, and given Orpheus the instructions - his faith would have to carry him through the kingdom of the dead, and nothing else.",
      "Hades had thought it harsh of Persephone, but she'd been implacable, and so he'd pointed the boy to the path he'd need to climb to the upper entrance to his domain.",
      "Hell was quiet - had been ever since the last note had been plucked from Orpheus's lyre - and so his wail of loss echoed across the underworld.",
      "Persephone's eyes closed next to him, a quiet sigh of disappointment breathed out amid the lamentation for Eurydice.",
      "Do not let him plead his case again, my lord, she'd said, rising from her throne.",
      "I do not wish to see her so disappointed a second time.",
      "He hadn't asked why she was so sure that it was Orpheus's lack of faith that doomed him.",
      "Why she knew that, had he granted Orpheus another chance, he would again doubt that Eurydice was with him.",
      "The girl was now under his wife's protection, and not even he dared to incur her wrath when it came to lost women.",
      "He had sins of his own to atone for.",
      "~*~*~*~ Lethe (the river of forgetfulness)",
      "It took one day - one single, human day - for everything to change.",
      "On this day, he'd found the main Gates wide open, Cerberus curled in a corner whimpering, and a man in Judean garb awaiting his presence.",
      "Hades knew prophets and princes when he saw them, and the man certainly carried himself well, but this man was no mere prophet.",
      "He looked - not like one of Hades's own breathren, but like Hercules, like Achilles.",
      "The man invited him to sit - invited him, in his own palace, and if that wasn't warning enough, he didn't know what else would have convinced him - and they took seats on the smooth slate ground beneath the Gates.",
      "Cerberus, snuffling and nosing at Hades's side, the big baby, laid between them, and the Judean absently scratched at the dog's ruff above the left head before speaking.",
      "You know what I'm here for, Lord Hades.",
      "No epithets.",
      "No fearful titles of placation and flattery.",
      "Just his name, and it didn't sound strange at all from this thin, wide-eyed halfling.",
      "And he couldn't pretend the man wasn't right - he knew, had known since he'd seen him.",
      "Why are you still here, then?",
      "Take your souls and go.",
      "I have no quarrel with you, nor with your followers.",
      "I wanted to speak to you, he answered simply.",
      "And they did, the Judean asking this question or that question about various souls in his kingdom.",
      "Telling him a rather amusing parable about a rich man and his servant.",
      "Listening as Hades spoke of how Persephone had been rather off-color recently (gods couldn't get sick, per se, but even they had their less-than-healthy days).",
      "The man was easy to talk to - very much like Odysseus, actually - and, had Hades known of his importance, he'd have fallen at the man's feet and begged him to be spared what was to come.",
      "As it was, the man had turned just outside the Gates.",
      "I am truly sorry, Lord Hades, for what my coming brings.",
      "I wish you and your Persephone well.",
      "The Gates closed, and Hell changed.",
      "It became harsher and kinder in turns as the humans believed they were more or less worthy of punishment.",
      "Elysium's groves of olive trees grew tall, then disappeared altogether, to be replaced by first vines of grapes, then by fields of wheat.",
      "The great rivers began to dry up and form a central lake - sometimes of flame, sometimes of ice - then flowed once again.",
      "His palace grew from a majestic onyx fortress into a twisted crimson abattoir, and it had taken him centuries to gather enough power to wrest it back to his control again.",
      "He'd always disliked the color red, but the belief heralded by the Judean's followers was pervasive.",
      "Soon after, Persephone faded away altogether.",
      "He shut himself away in his sorrow, letting the underworld do with itself what it would.",
      "He had his palace, Cerberus lazing across the threshold, and the spectre of Persephone to mourn.",
      "As the centuries passed, there were fewer and fewer souls who remembered him as the vibrant, fair ruler of the ever-changing lands - not the sullen, brooding guardian of a place of torment.",
      "The epithets changed as well, and he became entwined with another feared guardian of souls.",
      "They called him Morningstar, now, and with that knowledge, he waited.",
      "Time was one thing he did have left."

    "text": "There was a familiar itch in the back of his head that told Gabriel this was probably bad news. Ignoring that itch was all but instinct at this point, though, so he popped down to Earth to check it out. He wasn't even there for a minute before he started berating himself for coming down. It was the Winchesters - of course it was the Winchesters, who else could draw him down here but a couple of sigil-protected idiots? Anyway, it was Sam and Dean, and rather than do anything new or creative they lit a ring of holy oil on fire. Of course. Gabriel sighed dramatically, mostly because he knew how much it pissed them off. \"What do you want?\" \"You been messing around down here?\" Dean bit off. The guy was so tense, it was ridiculous. No wonder he suited Michael so well. Gabriel rolled his eyes. \"It's a little hard to pull Trickster moves now that my cover's been broken. Thanks for that, by the way.\" Dean sneered, and Sam's brow wrinkled. Gabriel raised his eyebrows in exaggerated surprise. \"Oh, wait a minute. You were expecting it to be me. But since it's not me, you've got no leads.\" Their silence was confirmation enough for a wide grin to spread across his face. Though now that he thought about it, he wondered. He'd pulled some pretty good ones in his time. Who was good enough to be mistaken for him? Rocking on his heels, he said, \"Oh, what the hell, I'll bite. What's my copycat done?\" Sam dug into his bag and pulled something out. \"Copied a Greek god,\" he said, tossing a golden apple into the ring of fire. Gabriel caught it, turned the apple over in his hands, stunned. But sure enough, KALLISTE was inscribed on it in a familiar hand. \"Oh man, does this take me back,\" he murmured, tracing the markings. So this was what caused that itch. \"The police found that on the scene of a double homicide,\" Sam explained. \"Two professors at a local college killed each other in cold blood. Their specialties were ancient Greek mythology. Apparently, they were both vying for tenure and the school was only going to give it to one of them.\" \"They were rivals, probably muckraking each other's work to try to get ahead, dragging their students into it, yadda yadda.\" Gabriel waved a hand around in the air absently. He'd heard this story a hundred times, even interfered once or twice. But not this time... no, he knew who this was. Continuing, he said, \"So, given the violent death and this here apple, you figured someone tried to teach them a lesson?\" Dean and Sam glanced at each other. \"Are you saying it's not?\" Sam asked cautiously. Gabriel snorted. \"Afraid so, kiddies! This here's the real thing,\" he said, holding up the apple. \"The Golden Apple of Discord.\" \"What, so some ancient goddess of chaos decided to pop up in Nowhere, USA and pull an old trick on a couple of Greek myth geeks?\" Disbelief was not a good look for Dean, however often it appeared on his face. Gabriel pretended to think it over. \"Yeah, pretty much.\" Dean scoffed, and Gabriel decided to take the higher ground and ignore him. \"These professors of yours, what did they focus on? The Iliad, right?\" Sam blinked. \"Uh, yeah.\" \"Eris is vain. She loves having worshipers, almost as much as she loves mischief and mayhem. But she's also jealous. Very jealous.\" Gabriel looked past the Winchesters and grinned. In ancient Greek, he asked, \"What did they do, write a paper on you and then forget about you, Eris?\" The Winchesters spun around, coming face to face with an attractive woman with long dark hair and a prominent Grecian nose. Eris could have been mistaken for human, if it wasn't for that old-fashion chiton she still wore. Though that buzz of something supernatural that hovered around her probably made it difficult for her to hide. She pouted playfully at Gabriel. \"Of course not. Do you think me so petty? They wrote two,\" she added before frowning and kicking at the ground. \"Before moving on to Aphrodite!\" Gabriel rolled his eyes. \"Always with Aphrodite,\" he complained halfheartedly. \"When are you going to give it up? People like her.\" Eris kicked at the ground again. \"I will give it up when they forget her name completely!\" \"Ooh, that's gonna take a while,\" Gabriel said, wrinkling his nose. \"You'd have to knock Mamma Mia off Broadway to do that, and have you seen the reviews? People love that show.\" Making a frustrated sound, Eris glared at him. \"I never should have taught you to play with humans!\" With that, she disappeared in a poof of smoke, taking her apple along with her. Coughing, Gabriel waved the smoke out of his face. \"She always did have a fondness for theatrics,\" he said nostalgically, taking in the flabbergasted expressions on the Winchesters' faces with no small amount of pleasure. Tapping his foot mock-impatiently, he said, \"Can I go now?\" Blinking slowly, Dean went to find the fire alarm. Sam looked at Gabriel warily. \"So, you and Eris...?\" Gabriel tsked. \"An archangel doesn't kiss and tell, Sammy.\"",

    "text": "Unlike some of the others, Hermes still has power in this world. Hestia's lost ground badly these last few years; the microwave and 'Super Mom' diverted attention from the hearth and she's been trying to recoup ever since. (Although even Hestia refuses to accept Martha Stewart as one of hers.) Hera is faded and quiet, little help to her favorite sister. The Queen of the Gods is only now recovering from the Catholic church's long promotion of celibacy. The slow drive towards gay marriage, oddly, has been good for her. Hermes has been wondering how long it will be until Zeus finds himself searching for a new queen, and which of the goddesses Hera might take up with. His step-mother has never appreciated her husband's numerous affairs. Apollo has always had his sun-worshipers, and the spread of psychology in the last century has kept his name known and that of his half-brother Dionysus. Artemis is doing surprisingly well. There'd been a few centuries after men took over childbirth when Hermes was afraid she'd fade, but Wicca and the feminist movement have been very good for her and Athena both. Grey-eyed Athena still shakes her head sometimes, however, and looks at her skin, and murmurs disbelievingly, 'Black?' Death and sleep, as ever, are universal. Hades and Morpheus have simply adapted to the times and enjoyed the rise of the Goth movement. War, too, does well, on all the battlefields large and small. Ares is constantly busy, constantly invoked, and as likely to wear varying colors of camouflage as his favorite red and black. His brother, Hephaestus, is willing to help the others, as always, and in these technological days has aid in plenty to offer. Poseidon and Amphitrite, of course, never lost their worshipers. Sailors worship the sea, and love her, and fear her. Prayers for safety come with every storm, with every leave-taking; thanks for safe return are just as common. As for Hecate, well, there will always be those who need dark deals and darker vengeance. There will always be fervent prayers over crops, too, although the slow spread of large farms, manufactured fertilizer, and genetically engineered crops seem to leave Demeter quieter every year. The vegans are some help, but Zeus was a god of crops and the sky, both; those prayers go to him as well, and cost him, too, apparently. He's lost some of his power as the secrets of the weather have been fathomed, but he regains some ground each storm season and as the threat of global warming spreads. Some things have changed; others have stayed the same. Where necessary, the gods have shifted their priorities and powers as best they can, tacking on the currents of mortal ideas and needs, and beliefs. Hermes has always done well, though, with little need to change. He finds that ironic, when he stops to think about it. Everyone knows the tricksters, the tale-carriers, the quick-witted and quick-tongued. They don't always know who he is, but the silhouetted profile of the figure with helmet and chiton and the winged sandals is known in any number of lands, not just Greece. His silhouette delivers flowers across the States, and his staff, with its coiled serpents, rides the back of ambulances everywhere. It was his symbol before Asclepius used it, but Hermes doesn't begrudge sharing that power with his nephew. Hermes does what he's always done: carries rumors and whispers, steals this and that, stirs mischief here, negotiates peace there, and keeps a hand in everything and an alibi always. As a result, unlike some of the gods, Hermes still receives power -- in steady trickles and tiny currents and sometimes in the mad, overpowering spikes that sire new children. Hermes watches over those children when and as he can, and worries about them. Too many of the other gods don't, but Hermes knows his own and cares for them as best he can. Some of them, though -- the ones most like him and occasionally the ones who have nothing in common with him at all -- Hermes loves. Which is why, this once, he's in Tartarus on his own business. \"Hades.\" Bare moments pass before his uncle appears. Danger wreathes Hades, dark as the graves and caves that form the source of his power. Hades' greatest power flows from blindness and blind folly, death threats, or worse, the refusal to grant death. Not even Zeus ever dared to challenge this brother. The underworld might have seemed the worst of the choices to draw when the three deities diced for their shares of the world, but Hades learned long ago how best to use its powers. Now he looks young and nearly innocent in black leather and denim, black hair and pale skin and finely wrought platinum jewelry. Those dark eyes see everything, however, and the set of his mouth tells Hermes his uncle hasn't lost his aversion to giving up what's his. Worse, Hades thinks everything in the underworld is his. \"Hermes. I thought you'd brought someone who needed my personal attention.\" Hades smiles, danger hidden behind surprisingly red lips, red as pomegranates, as he asks, \"So what brings you to my realm?\" \"You have one of my sons.\" Hades winces at that. \"I have several of your sons, Hermes.\" His voice is unexpectedly gentle on the words, soft as sleeping in snow or relaxing into bathwater turning pink. \"Some of them keep Persephone company when I'm busy.\" Hermes has to smile. On business or not, calling due old favors from a more powerful god or not, some ideas are just too ludicrous. \"I guarantee you that you don't allow this one to keep her company.\" His smile goes as edged and dangerous as his uncle's. \"And you do owe me a favor or twelve, Hades.\" Hades nods, sleek hair falling over his eyes and sliding away again as he does. \"I do. But there are always complications with retrieving the dead, nephew....\" Hermes just grins at his uncle. Negotiations are among his particular masteries, after all and Hades hasn't said 'No.' Therefore, so far as Hermes is concerned, they're only dickering over ways, and means, and price. \"Of course there are, Uncle Hades. But I'm sure we can work out ways around any problem. Shall we discuss it?\" <>:<>:<>:<>:<> It wasn't the sea-shaded eyes, right now a Caribbean turquoise, that made her so beautiful, or even the angle of cheekbones over full, luscious lips. Her hair was the white blond of sea-spray, caught up in a tumble and spill of curls and tendrils that made him want to run his hands through it and take it out of what little order the pearl strand had imposed, but that wasn't it, either. Coral-tinted lips smiled at him and if he'd had a heart it would have stopped. As it was, Fitz found himself on his knees, gazing at her feet and wanting to worship her with hands and mouth from her toes to her crown, and so hard he wished he still had a body that could touch hers. She was too substantial and he felt truly a ghost next to her. Her smile tinted her voice, a husky, purring pleasure in her tone that brought his head up as surely as his name had. \"Hugh FitzCairn, surely you're not going to kneel to me?\" If she'd sounded truly upset, Fitz might have babbled. As it was, he turned his sunniest smile on her, looking up from under an unruly mass of blond curls of his own. \"Have we met, my lady?\" She laughed, and he sighed in contentment at making her so happy, then blushed when she apologized. \"I'm sorry. Here.\" Somehow she muted her effect a little and Fitz felt the lust ease its grip on him. Which didn't mean he wouldn't find her a comfortable spot in the field if she looked interested.... And he'd lost a few minutes staring at her, apparently. She only looked amused and pleased in a 'cat that lapped up the cream' way-- Fitz, old boy, she's going to slap you at this rate. Lord, what an image though. Her chuckle eased his concerns. \"Lovely man, another time, I will take you up on that. You think the sweetest things. And the not so sweet. I'm truly flattered. But this isn't the time or the place. Listen to me, Fitz. Do you want to be able to worship women with that sweet body of yours again?\" Fitz blinked and wished, again, for his pipe. \"Dear lady, my body's in truly regrettable condition by now, isn't it?\" She only smiled. \"Ah, but that part isn't your problem, Fitz. Someone else would handle that. What you need to tell me is, do you want to live?\" \"Well of course I do,\" he said. \"Wine, women, song, friends to laugh with, enemies' graves to dance over. Hundreds of women who've never known me, tales still untold.... Plenty still to do.\" She laughed, low and pleased, and it stirred parts of Fitz that refused to admit they might have rotted in a coffin somewhere else. \"Ah, you're still mine, Fitz.\" She sounded very satisfied by that. \"Good. The price for this is paid, but someone had to make my part worth my while. Now you have.\" \"I'm afraid I don't understand.\" Fitz didn't have so much as a hint, actually, much less a clue, but that was all right. He did have a lovely view. She only laughed again. \"It's simple enough, gorgeous. You have a chance to walk the world again, breathe real air, taste real wine, worship real women.\" She watched him, mouth curved with that same knowing smile. \"All it will take is two things. Follow your guides -- we'll hand you off, one to another, don't worry about that -- and speak no word 'til you feel sunlight on your face and have your sword in your hand.\" \"Damn,\" Fitz said mildly. \"No escaping the Game, hmm?\" \"Beautiful man, you did escape.\" A graceful, foam-pale hand cut through the air to indicate the spirits nearby and the pallid attempt at sunlight in the fields. \"The question is whether the escape was worth the cost.\" Fitz laughed. \"Oh. Well, if that's the way it is... the Game is a small price to pay for real wine, real women, and new songs. Follow you and the guides you pass me along to, and not a word, you said?\" She nodded, unexpectedly solemn. Fitz wanted to wipe that from her face, replace it with her smile. \"Yes. Not a word until you have daylight and sword hilt in hand. The chance will only be offered once, Hugh FitzCairn, and your father paid dearly to get it for you.\" She smiled briefly. \"He offered to pay me to guide you, but, well, how could I not if you were still mine?\" Fitz stared then, blue eyes wide. \"My father? I have one? I always thought we immortals just... hatched or something. Found under a cabbage leaf maybe.\" She only smiled and shook her head. \"No, Fitz, and I can't tell you more than that. It's not safe to know. But I thought you'd like to know that your father loves you this much.\" Fitz tucked that away in the same part of his mind that heard her say she'd show up in his bed one day. He'd ask again then. In the meantime, he had another question. \"I say. Haven't I heard something like this before? Orpheus, it was, and Eurydice?\" The lovely woman -- goddess, Fitz was starting to realize, and he had acquired a few ideas about which one she was, too -- nodded. \"You have. Which means you know how that turned out. Remember, Fitz. Not a word. No matter what, or for what matter.\" She smiled suddenly, looking him over from head to toe and lingering with a very flattering interest at parts in between. \"I'd be truly disappointed not to be able to show up in your bed one week.\" Fitz chuckled. \"I'll look forward to dying a happy man, sweet lady. Should I ask your name?\" She only smiled. \"I think you already know it.\" Her chuckle was warm wickedness, chocolate sin, and he wanted to roll in it. \"Think you can follow my ass out of here? I'll even guarantee the other two you'll follow will be just as much fun to watch. You never did mind watching hips swaying in front of you.\" She giggled. \"I'll admit, we were counting on that when we set this up.\" Laughter bubbled out of him, and mischief, and a joie de vivre that might yet translate back into life. The other shades slowly approached him, trying to bask in the warmth that now emanated from him, however faintly. \"When do we start?\" \"If you're ready, now.\" She set a finger across his lips and for the first time since he'd died, Fitz felt someone's touch. It burned through him like brandy on an empty stomach and he barely heard her warning. \"Not a word, Fitz. Barely a sound. When we reach the stream, I'll point to your new guide, who'll do the same at the next leg of the journey to introduce your last guide. Make no sound, accept no further gifts. Eat no food, drink no wine, and stray not from the path lest you be lost.\" There was no mistaking her warning. <>:<>:<>:<>:<> Fitz swung around and only then realized the sweet scent under it was sun-warmed metheglyn. Their path apparently went past the post stamp-sized garden of St. Julien's and Darius sat on his heels on the flagstone patio. Mud lay under his nails, covered his hands, and spackled his arms to the elbow, under the rolled up sleeves of his habit. A small stack of weeds lay beside him, withering in the sunlight -- How? Fitz had to wonder. It's not that hot, really.... -- and Darius smiled at him, fond and familiar. \"Thirsty, Fitz? Or did you run out of tobacco again?\" he asked. Fitz paused, hand reaching into his pocket automatically for the pipe that, once again, wasn't there... and he realized that the sound of Aphrodite's feet was steadily fading away. An exasperated breath hissed out but he kept any words behind his teeth as he ran to catch up with her. Really, he thought, feeling no little aggrieved. Bad enough to keep a man from talking to Darius, but to add metheglyn to the bait.... Well. That's simply underhanded. Still. Can't say She didn't warn me. Drink no wine indeed. But it's going to take the devil's own luck to find some metheglyn when I'm back and damn it, I can still smell it! <>:<>:<>:<>:<> Besides which, the goddess was fascinating to watch. So far, they'd passed through olive groves and lavender fields, a rocky promontory that ran to a sea-lashed beach by way of the Athens agora, and every other type of terrain in between. Sometimes Fitz had three or four paces before the terrain changed; other times, like the beach, a reality might last a quarter mile. Fitz looked up from picking his way carefully across a shale slide and Aphrodite had turned around to smile at him. As he took the last step to her side, the rocky mountain pass faded into a high narrow meadow full of late summer wheat and a narrow blue-green stream. Aphrodite smiled and pointed to the stunning black-haired woman waiting with a patient, too-knowing smile. Fitz swept them both his best bow and as he straightened the goddess blew him a kiss and vanished. His new guide laughed softly and reached up to tuck a strayed curl back up into the tumbled black mass of her hair. Fitz had to pause and study her. This one wasn't a goddess. She was gloriously human and had quite obviously been the mold for every Mediterranean beauty since time began, or Aphrodite had emerged from that sea, at least. Olive-skinned with chocolate eyes, and those lashes were thick enough to make looking up through them seem new and alluring again. Slender with muscle everywhere she wasn't curved to remind a man why he wanted to roll around with a woman, long feet and toes that only looked elegant in the sandals and long fingers designed to caress a man -- Fitz could have watched her walk until the moon set. She had clearly been waiting for him to finish his appraisal, but she was smiling at him and he grinned about the light it put in her eyes and the way it shifted the lines of her face. Her chuckle was low and husky, and she gave him the most speaking, 'come hither' glance Fitz thought he'd ever seen before she turned away. Fitz hoped, and prayed, that he'd be allowed to remember her after he made it out, even if he was quite sure there'd never be another woman quite like her. If he could, he'd have to name his next ship after her. <>:<>:<>:<>:<> \"Pub, whorehouse, or church lunch, Connor MacLeod could start a bar brawl faster than any man I've ever met.\" \"Ah,\" came the husky, burred retort, \"but he could charm the ladies, too. You never met his wife.\" FitzCairn turned to find the speakers, their voices as familiar to him as his own from taverns the width and breadth of the Mediterranean. Rocks and boulders had been piled together to shape a primitive but efficient open-air forge. Some shade, a water trough barely a hand-span deep with scummy water, and an anvil near a cold fire bed. Sunda Kastagir was standing over the anvil, a small hammer hanging apparently absently in one hand and maybe it really was -- the Moor was a superb blacksmith when he liked you. With two sharp, careful blows, Kastagir set the pins through the hilt and tang, hammering them down onto the caps. As Kastagir swung the blade up to guard, Ramirez stood from the wall he'd been lounging against. Supervising the work in progress, or arguing, depending on who you asked, Fitz didn't doubt. Ramirez' brown eyes were normally merry; at the moment, he looked both skeptical and exasperated. He held the sword's sheath in one hand: scarlet leather, worked in gold and black threads and polished steel bolts. A black and scarlet belt hung from his other hand, clearly awaiting the weight of leather and steel. Ramirez glanced over and snapped, \"Hells, FitzCairn, you met the man. Kindly explain to this overbearing bear of a brawler that my Highlander could charm women as well as his kinsman.\" Kastagir snorted. \"Ah, but I never met the younger Highlander, remember, Ramirez? So? What is this Duncan like, Hugh?\" \"A young idiot,\" Ramirez growled, \"with the luck of Isis and Osiris both.\" Fitz began to respond... and felt his mouth snap shut before he even realized he'd bitten the words back. Only then did he see the sharp look Ramirez was giving him. It was the same wordless warning of danger that had driven the two of them out of public houses ahead of press gangs, robbers, and irate husbands in twenty countries. As soon as Fitz fell resolutely silent, Ramirez saluted him. The triumphant grin concealed most of the pain twisting across the old Spaniard's face, and he and Kastagir were both swirling away like tavern smoke in the breeze of an opened door. Kastagir's laugh boomed out, and his voice, too, calling, \"Hugh, enjoy the blade!\" Then they were gone, and that beautiful blade-- That I couldn't have accepted! Fitz reminded himself. FitzCairn turned to follow his lovely guide again, teeth gritted against an uncharacteristically fierce resentment. Damn it all, bad enough to leave me without their company for however long I've been here -- and the Elysian Fields would have been much more entertaining with those two around -- but to deprive me of a chance to have a good, long argument where I'd win no matter what. That was uncalled for! Another half-mile or so of walking eased some of his irritation, though none of his determination. The view ahead was superb, after all, if the sky still made his head hurt. Besides. Hugh FitzCairn had lost any number of bets in his life -- frequently by being too drunk to win, he had to admit -- but he wasn't about to concede defeat. Not least because, at this rate, he'd obviously hate not seeing the third guide. <>:<>:<>:<>:<> Ice-white hair poured back from her crown, shoved carelessly behind her ears and held back from her eyes by a thin strip of black leather. Mostly, though, it was confined by braids. Thin braids and thick; three strands, four, five. Some tied off, some knotted into themselves, and others trying to fray apart into tendrils and mischief. Gold and silver cord twined through the tiny braids until some of them seemed more cord than hair. In the thicker braids, bells and beads of every color and material wove in and out in a random mix of metal, crystal, and cheap, gimcrack iridescent plastic. Like the plastic, her hair caught every shade and tint of the sunset. Her eyes were colorless as water in clear glass. Fitz shot his second guide a smile full of gratitude when she turned back to him, finally. She smiled back, amused by something, and dropped a low curtsey that made Fitz try not to consider where her mouth now was in relationship to his height.... The mortal woman laughed, richly amused, and waved him towards the waiting goddess. She straightened then and walked away, seemingly off the mountain and into the air. The bright-hued goddess (and Fitz somehow didn't doubt in the least that she was) smoothed down the fluttering ribbons that made her tunic, then shrugged and smiled over the impossibility of making them something other than what they were: a raven's bait of a distraction, in every color and sheen imaginable, and none of them long enough or concealing enough to keep Fitz from having to bite his tongue. Constantly. Bronze skin gleamed here and there under the ribbons, and now and then there was an occasional glimpse of ash blond curls or copper nipples.... Fitz hadn't realized he'd be so grateful to have a beautiful woman turn her back on him. She's beautiful, Fitz lad, and flattered by the interest -- that was in the eyes -- but so was some kind of warning. Lord. Beautiful as Masamune's blades and every bit as dangerous. Somehow. He sighed gustily and wished for his pipe. And I hate getting my blood on blades. <>:<>:<>:<>:<> Don't eat or drink, which is how they caught Persephone. Take no gifts, Aphrodite said -- that lovely sword. I wonder if it was real, or a memory of one Kastagir made years back? He made the most incredible scimitars.... No gifts. No sound. Not until I have my sword and something else... sunlight on the blade? On me? On both of us? I'd better be careful. I imagine the tax bureaus have nothing on a god of the dead who wants to be picky about technicalities. And stay on the path. I nearly walked off to borrow that pipe from Darius. Fitz sighed, certain that 'It was only for a moment,' simply wouldn't be sufficient excuse to the Lord of the Dead. The list of things he was promising himself when he had a body again was really starting to mount up. Much like portions of his anatomy, following such lovely ladies out. The frustrated hiss cut across the silence, laid red-plum frustration across the fading light of the sky, and Fitz turned in surprise. He knew that voice, too, and the last time Amanda had sounded like that, she'd been dangling over a wall, Duncan leaning on her feet to hold her while she reached (in vain) for an emerald the size of a baby's fist. When FitzCairn turned, however, he saw two things, not one. The contrast between them froze him in place as if he'd turned to see Medusa there. Behind him, to the left, Amanda hung from a mountaineer's rig, the tips of her fingers barely an inch too far from a faceted crystal the size of a cantaloupe. Farther to his left, though, and within hand's reach, stood a second goddess. She looked precisely like the one he'd been following, who was within reach of his right hand. Both goddesses were frowning, at Fitz and at the scene before him. Then they turned, in unison, and began walking again, and Fitz realized he had no choice but to go with them. Even if I stay, I won't see Amanda -- I didn't find Ramirez, or Darius, in my wanderings. He trudged between them, trying not to listen to the aggravated insults being directed at him, and feeling part of his mind still puzzling over something. Amanda's ropes didn't run to anything, they just faded off. Fitz frowned, following his lovely guide and almost as distracted by his thoughts as by her long, strong legs swaying and tantalizing under those ribbons. The frustrated commentary faded away behind him and he sighed in relief, still feeling faintly guilty for not helping a friend get something she so clearly wanted. Amanda was always sneaky and stubborn, even for one of Rebecca's students -- all that beautiful steel under that lovelier skin was part of her infinite charm.... Surely she'll find something she can use to reach that last inch. If she'd just wear bras, it wouldn't be a problem. He could only hope she'd succeeded though, as he followed his guide out. Hope, and wonder who, exactly, he was following, and who his father might be to have guides like this owing him favors.... <>:<>:<>:<>:<> Fitz could smell things, now, though, and that was almost a forgotten pleasure, like touch, or taste.... The scent of amber and saffron and lemon drifted to him from before and behind him. Sulfur had been there briefly, although the rotten-egg tinge was long since gone from the air. Old rock and old earth around him, and the indefinable freshness of night air about to heat... it was definitely dawn coming, and fresh air ahead. But they'd been climbing forever. His feet hurt, his heart ached, and he had the worst case of blue balls in recorded history when his third guide stepped out of the passageway and into a sunlit grove. She cast a shadow across his feet and Fitz almost wanted to stare at the blackness of it after so much grey, but he was much more interested in the surface. As he stepped out of the rock crevice, Fitz felt fabric drag at his skin: cotton, denim, leather, wool. He could almost discern the separate threads and grains of the fabrics and couldn't decide if his skin was crawling or if he wanted to wrap himself up in sensation and roll in it. His first dawn since that damnable duel with Kalas spread around him in all its considerable beauty. A morning breeze was rising and it blew his hair around his face, cooled the beads of sweat along nape and hairline. In the edge of his vision, he saw the sunlight halo into sparks and shimmering rainbows along his companion's silhouette, but he was much more focused on the blade lying abandoned on a boulder in front of him. The black leather hilt of the scimitar soaked up the morning light, and the scarlet and gold scabbard looked like Spanish work. The scabbard was Ramirez' doing, Fitz was sure, and wondered how it had come here when he and Kastagir were both dead, and Fitz had been. He picked up the blade and tested the balance, nearly purring as he pulled sword from sheath. Kastagir's work, down to the maker's mark carved into the hilt, and beautifully balanced as ever. Sunlight cut itself on the edge and Fitz felt himself settle onto the earth beneath his boots with a thump that should have been audible. He was solid again, as he hadn't been in ages... and his stomach was growling. The twin goddesses smiled at him. \"Fare well, Hugh FitzCairn,\" the first told him and chuckled. The second one, who'd never entirely left the cavernous path for the sunlit realms, smiled. \"Fare you very well. No doubt that we will see you again one day, but do try not to return to those realms too soon.\" Fitz smiled at them, looked at the sun on his blade and his hand, and sheathed the scimitar with a single skillful motion. He double-wrapped the belt around waist and onto hip, settled the blade with a dandy's practiced grace, and bowed to them. \"Fair goddesses, I cannot thank you enough, but I'll try.\" The first one laughed, sparks exploding off her with the motion. \"The way you burn through life will be enough thanks.\" She glanced at her twin, one eyebrow raising, and then they were both simply... gone. Fitz spun, looking for them, then laughed as his stomach growled again. \"A sword, a body, and good boots. And the grace of their memories. What more could a man ask for?\" He considered the path down off the mountain, the question of where exactly he was, and who had inherited his money, and winced. Food, and passport, and all the other inconveniences necessary in these times.... \"Hmm. Well. Maybe a tad bit more, but I think I'd better prevail on more mortal friends for hospitality.\" Fitz stuck his hands the pocket of his coat, wishing he'd been wearing a cloak in the realms below, and resigned himself to the idea that he'd have to find a way to hide this lovely blade. He was not giving it up. He was already whistling as he walked down off the mountain. It was going to be a gorgeous day. But then, they all were. <>:<>:<>:<>:<> \"That there be two of you to guide him on any leg was not permitted,\" Hades said softly, intrigued or dangerous, or perhaps both. \"And you have no twin, Iris. Who presumes to disguise herself in my realms?\" The twin goddesses chuckled in unison. \"Who else would have the power?\" one of them asked, very amused. Light shifted around her and poured out into the cavern. The edges were harder, but the danger seemed less that way, nonetheless. Persephone pushed a long, wavy lock of brown hair back from her face and smiled at him. \"You're sulking, love.\" \"He was mine, and you helped him escape, Persephone?\" Hades watched her, puzzled. With the fingers of one hand -- the nails had been painted deep purple -- he twisted a ring around and around on the other hand. Sparks exploded off the black opal again and again as the ring spun on that pale flesh. \"Why?\" \"Ah, love, you cheated first. He'd have never seen me if you hadn't made another spirit look, and sound, like his friend. Amanda's not dead. We both know you're not allowed to use her yet.\" Persephone walked up to Hades -- Ruler of the Underworld, Lord of Death and Dreams, master of riches incalculable, oldest son of Cronos and possibly the most dangerous -- and raised his hand to her mouth to kiss it. Against her sun-gilded skin, his pallor stood out more clearly. Her lips were dark red as the juice of fresh blackberries. Hades sighed, resigned or pleased, or perhaps both, and touched her cheek with the other hand. His fingers traced her skin gently, reverent as if she were fragile or easily stained, or perhaps both. \"Why, though, my lovely wife? If you wished him freed, could you not have asked me? Am I that fearsome to you?\" Iris chuckled softly. \"Lord Hades, you never looked closely at that one, did you?\" \"He was Hermes' son, Iris. I treated him accordingly, when it came time for judgment. A kindly man, in his own way. What did I not see?\" Hades didn't look at the messenger goddess, only at his wife. \"Ah, love. If I'd asked you to free him, you'd have worried I wished to leave you.\" Persephone cradled the hand against her cheek with her own, and shifted the one she'd kissed down to rest over her heart, between her breasts. Green silk slid against Hades' fingers as she said, \"And he was yours, my deadly love, but he was also ours.\" Hades' mouth drew down only the most minute amount, but the light in the cavern began to fade and the temperature slid downward, as well. His wife's nipples were already tight, he saw, and knew it had nothing to do with cold, or at least not the cold of the cavern. \" 'Ours,' you say. Who is this 'we,' then, Persephone? Your mother's?\" Iris bowed to him respectfully, brave enough to invite his attention away from his wife. \"Not at all, my lord, in the sense you mean. None of our children are fertile, which means the Lady Persephone's mother has but little interest in most of them. Hugh FitzCairn was yours when he was dead, my lord, but in life, he was a worshipper of all goddesses and all women.\" Persephone chuckled and slid her husband's hands down over her breasts, purring at such a cold touch against such tender skin. \"He was a rake, a womanizer, and a lover of all things female. Aphrodite is still purring over his thoughts for her, and even Helen would have happily bedded him, Hades.\" Her voice dropped to a husky murmur which Iris tactfully ignored, as a messenger so often must. \"Notice to whom I returned, my lord husband. Do feel free to make a most... intimate inspection to be sure I did not bed him.\" Amusement had, finally, begun to lighten Hades' eyes. \"I begin to understand. Shall we conduct this conversation elsewhere? Where we can discuss the penalties for such trickery and use of power in these realms for which I am responsible?\" \"Ah, under penalty does sound so pleasurable of a sudden,\" Persephone whispered to him, and the two of them vanished away, leaving the cavern lighter in appearance and atmosphere both. <>:<>:<>:<>:<> Hermes stretched, enjoying the feel of his own gender again and the freedom from the jiggle and sway that even so trim a goddess as Iris endured. Female form was fun for mischief, but he preferred his own shape. How his son Hermaphroditus endured the disadvantages of both, he'd never know. The breeze skittered around him, tousling his hair, and Hermes leaped onto it to skim down the air and check that Fitz was in fact headed towards civilization. Once he knew where his son was headed, he could prod a few likely (and deserving) marks towards him. Besides. He wanted to stay away from the entrances to the Underworld for a day or three, until Hades got over any lingering irritation. It would be safe to visit again after that. Persephone had thought it a waste to leave Fitz in the Underworld, and she'd make her point to her husband. Or make the most of his point, however it should be phrased. Hermes grinned, remembering how smoothly she'd handled Hades and wishing, again, that he'd made a pass at either of them centuries ago. Pity Hades was so involved in her. He was dangerous enough to be fun.... No. Hermes would be safe enough there on Zeus or Hera's business, but over all, it might be safest to give the couple a few days to work out the balance of power between themselves again. No matter how tempting it was to meddle. Hermes trailed rainbows across the hills of Greece as he went, a thank you to Iris for the use of her appearance, and laughed to have set his son loose on the world again. More mischief, more havoc, more deals made and changed.... The world needed more men like Hugh FitzCairn. So did the women of the world. A wide grin spread across his face as Hermes wondered, again, how well Aphrodite might reward a messenger who could swear that her most faithful follower had made it into the world again.... Oh, yes. It was going to be a gorgeous day again. But then, they all were. <>:<>:<>:<>:<> An end <>:<>:<>:<>:<> Comments, Commentary, & Miscellanea: The sea-foam goddess is, of course, Aphrodite. The human woman who set the mold for all Mediterranean beauties is, of course, Helen of Troy. (If this description doesn't match Homer's, I can only point out that that he was writing poetry and I'm working with myth....) Persephone first appeared in the guise of Iris, the other messenger of the gods and a frequent visitor to the Underworld. Vanzetti and Taz suggested perils, and Vanzetti reminded me that where Hades is concerned, Persephone is almost certainly involved. Many thanks to both, and to my quick (and encouraging) betas!",

      "\"Good.",

      "\"All it will take is two things.",
      "Follow your guides -- we'll hand you off, one to another, don't worry about that -- and speak no word 'til you feel sunlight on your face and have your sword in your hand.\"",
      "\"Damn,\" Fitz said mildly.",
      "\"No escaping the Game, hmm?\" \"Beautiful man, you did escape.\"",
      "A graceful, foam-pale hand cut through the air to indicate the spirits nearby and the pallid attempt at sunlight in the fields.",
      "\"The question is whether the escape was worth the cost.\"",
      "Fitz laughed.",
      "\"Oh.",
      "Well, if that's the way it is... the Game is a small price to pay for real wine, real women, and new songs.",
      "Follow you and the guides you pass me along to, and not a word, you said?\"",
      "She nodded, unexpectedly solemn.",
      "Fitz wanted to wipe that from her face, replace it with her smile.",
      "\"Yes.",
      "Not a word until you have daylight and sword hilt in hand.",
      "The chance will only be offered once, Hugh FitzCairn, and your father paid dearly to get it for you.\"",
      "She smiled briefly.",
      "\"He offered to pay me to guide you, but, well, how could I not if you were still mine?\" Fitz stared then, blue eyes wide.",
      "\"My father?",
      "I have one?",
      "I always thought we immortals just... hatched or something.",
      "Found under a cabbage leaf maybe.\"",
      "She only smiled and shook her head.",
      "\"No, Fitz, and I can't tell you more than that.",
      "It's not safe to know.",
      "But I thought you'd like to know that your father loves you this much.\"",
      "Fitz tucked that away in the same part of his mind that heard her say she'd show up in his bed one day.",
      "He'd ask again then.",
      "In the meantime, he had another question.",
      "\"I say.",
      "Haven't I heard something like this before?",
      "Orpheus, it was, and Eurydice?\"",
      "The lovely woman -- goddess, Fitz was starting to realize, and he had acquired a few ideas about which one she was, too -- nodded.",
      "\"You have.",
      "Which means you know how that turned out.",
      "Remember, Fitz.",
      "Not a word.",
      "No matter what, or for what matter.\"",
      "She smiled suddenly, looking him over from head to toe and lingering with a very flattering interest at parts in between.",
      "\"I'd be truly disappointed not to be able to show up in your bed one week.\"",
      "Fitz chuckled.",
      "\"I'll look forward to dying a happy man, sweet lady.",
      "Should I ask your name?\"",
      "She only smiled.",
      "\"I think you already know it.\"",
      "Her chuckle was warm wickedness, chocolate sin, and he wanted to roll in it.",
      "\"Think you can follow my ass out of here?",
      "I'll even guarantee the other two you'll follow will be just as much fun to watch.",
      "You never did mind watching hips swaying in front of you.\"",
      "She giggled.",
      "\"I'll admit, we were counting on that when we set this up.\"",
      "Laughter bubbled out of him, and mischief, and a joie de vivre that might yet translate back into life.",
      "The other shades slowly approached him, trying to bask in the warmth that now emanated from him, however faintly.",
      "\"When do we start?\"",
      "\"If you're ready, now.\"",
      "She set a finger across his lips and for the first time since he'd died, Fitz felt someone's touch.",
      "It burned through him like brandy on an empty stomach and he barely heard her warning.",
      "\"Not a word, Fitz.",
      "Barely a sound.",
      "When we reach the stream, I'll point to your new guide, who'll do the same at the next leg of the journey to introduce your last guide.",
      "Make no sound, accept no further gifts.",
      "Eat no food, drink no wine, and stray not from the path lest you be lost.\"",
      "There was no mistaking her warning. <>:<>:<>:<>:<> Fitz swung around and only then realized the sweet scent under it was sun-warmed metheglyn.",
      "Their path apparently went past the post stamp-sized garden of St. Julien's and Darius sat on his heels on the flagstone patio.",
      "Mud lay under his nails, covered his hands, and spackled his arms to the elbow, under the rolled up sleeves of his habit.",
      "A small stack of weeds lay beside him, withering in the sunlight -- How?",
      "Fitz had to wonder.",
      "It's not that hot, really.... -- and Darius smiled at him, fond and familiar.",
      "\"Thirsty, Fitz?",
      "Or did you run out of tobacco again?\" he asked.",
      "Fitz paused, hand reaching into his pocket automatically for the pipe that, once again, wasn't there... and he realized that the sound of Aphrodite's feet was steadily fading away.",
      "An exasperated breath hissed out but he kept any words behind his teeth as he ran to catch up with her.",
      "Really, he thought, feeling no little aggrieved.",
      "Bad enough to keep a man from talking to Darius, but to add metheglyn to the bait....",
      "Well.",
      "That's simply underhanded.",
      "Still.",
      "Can't say She didn't warn me.",
      "Drink no wine indeed.",
      "But it's going to take the devil's own luck to find some metheglyn when I'm back and damn it, I can still smell it! <>:<>:<>:<>:<> Besides which, the goddess was fascinating to watch.",
      "So far, they'd passed through olive groves and lavender fields, a rocky promontory that ran to a sea-lashed beach by way of the Athens agora, and every other type of terrain in between.",
      "Sometimes Fitz had three or four paces before the terrain changed; other times, like the beach, a reality might last a quarter mile.",
      "Fitz looked up from picking his way carefully across a shale slide and Aphrodite had turned around to smile at him.",
      "As he took the last step to her side, the rocky mountain pass faded into a high narrow meadow full of late summer wheat and a narrow blue-green stream.",
      "Aphrodite smiled and pointed to the stunning black-haired woman waiting with a patient, too-knowing smile.",
      "Fitz swept them both his best bow and as he straightened the goddess blew him a kiss and vanished.",
      "His new guide laughed softly and reached up to tuck a strayed curl back up into the tumbled black mass of her hair.",
      "Fitz had to pause and study her.",
      "This one wasn't a goddess.",
      "She was gloriously human and had quite obviously been the mold for every Mediterranean beauty since time began, or Aphrodite had emerged from that sea, at least.",
      "Olive-skinned with chocolate eyes, and those lashes were thick enough to make looking up through them seem new and alluring again.",
      "Slender with muscle everywhere she wasn't curved to remind a man why he wanted to roll around with a woman, long feet and toes that only looked elegant in the sandals and long fingers designed to caress a man -- Fitz could have watched her walk until the moon set.",
      "She had clearly been waiting for him to finish his appraisal, but she was smiling at him and he grinned about the light it put in her eyes and the way it shifted the lines of her face.",
      "Her chuckle was low and husky, and she gave him the most speaking, 'come hither' glance Fitz thought he'd ever seen before she turned away.",
      "Fitz hoped, and prayed, that he'd be allowed to remember her after he made it out, even if he was quite sure there'd never be another woman quite like her.",
      "If he could, he'd have to name his next ship after her. <>:<>:<>:<>:<> \"Pub, whorehouse, or church lunch, Connor MacLeod could start a bar brawl faster than any man I've ever met.\"",
      "\"Ah,\" came the husky, burred retort, \"but he could charm the ladies, too.",

      "FitzCairn turned to find the speakers, their voices as familiar to him as his own from taverns the width and breadth of the Mediterranean.",
      "Rocks and boulders had been piled together to shape a primitive but efficient open-air forge.",
      "Some shade, a water trough barely a hand-span deep with scummy water, and an anvil near a cold fire bed.",
      "Sunda Kastagir was standing over the anvil, a small hammer hanging apparently absently in one hand and maybe it really was -- the Moor was a superb blacksmith when he liked you.",
      "With two sharp, careful blows, Kastagir set the pins through the hilt and tang, hammering them down onto the caps.",
      "As Kastagir swung the blade up to guard, Ramirez stood from the wall he'd been lounging against.",
      "Supervising the work in progress, or arguing, depending on who you asked, Fitz didn't doubt.",
      "Ramirez' brown eyes were normally merry; at the moment, he looked both skeptical and exasperated.",
      "He held the sword's sheath in one hand: scarlet leather, worked in gold and black threads and polished steel bolts.",
      "A black and scarlet belt hung from his other hand, clearly awaiting the weight of leather and steel.",
      "Ramirez glanced over and snapped, \"Hells, FitzCairn, you met the man.",
      "Kindly explain to this overbearing bear of a brawler that my Highlander could charm women as well as his kinsman.\"",
      "Kastagir snorted.",
      "\"Ah, but I never met the younger Highlander, remember, Ramirez?",
      "So?",
      "What is this Duncan like, Hugh?\"",
      "\"A young idiot,\" Ramirez growled, \"with the luck of Isis and Osiris both.\"",
      "Fitz began to respond... and felt his mouth snap shut before he even realized he'd bitten the words back.",
      "Only then did he see the sharp look Ramirez was giving him.",
      "It was the same wordless warning of danger that had driven the two of them out of public houses ahead of press gangs, robbers, and irate husbands in twenty countries.",
      "As soon as Fitz fell resolutely silent, Ramirez saluted him.",
      "The triumphant grin concealed most of the pain twisting across the old Spaniard's face, and he and Kastagir were both swirling away like tavern smoke in the breeze of an opened door.",
      "Kastagir's laugh boomed out, and his voice, too, calling, \"Hugh, enjoy the blade!\"",
      "Then they were gone, and that beautiful blade-- That I couldn't have accepted!",
      "Fitz reminded himself.",
      "FitzCairn turned to follow his lovely guide again, teeth gritted against an uncharacteristically fierce resentment.",
      "Damn it all, bad enough to leave me without their company for however long I've been here -- and the Elysian Fields would have been much more entertaining with those two around -- but to deprive me of a chance to have a good, long argument where I'd win no matter what.",
      "That was uncalled for!",
      "Another half-mile or so of walking eased some of his irritation, though none of his determination.",
      "The view ahead was superb, after all, if the sky still made his head hurt.",
      "Besides.",
      "Hugh FitzCairn had lost any number of bets in his life -- frequently by being too drunk to win, he had to admit -- but he wasn't about to concede defeat.",
      "Not least because, at this rate, he'd obviously hate not seeing the third guide. <>:<>:<>:<>:<> Ice-white hair poured back from her crown, shoved carelessly behind her ears and held back from her eyes by a thin strip of black leather.",
      "Mostly, though, it was confined by braids.",
      "Thin braids and thick; three strands, four, five.",
      "Some tied off, some knotted into themselves, and others trying to fray apart into tendrils and mischief.",
      "Gold and silver cord twined through the tiny braids until some of them seemed more cord than hair.",
      "In the thicker braids, bells and beads of every color and material wove in and out in a random mix of metal, crystal, and cheap, gimcrack iridescent plastic.",
      "Like the plastic, her hair caught every shade and tint of the sunset.",
      "Her eyes were colorless as water in clear glass.",
      "Fitz shot his second guide a smile full of gratitude when she turned back to him, finally.",
      "She smiled back, amused by something, and dropped a low curtsey that made Fitz try not to consider where her mouth now was in relationship to his height....",
      "The mortal woman laughed, richly amused, and waved him towards the waiting goddess.",
      "She straightened then and walked away, seemingly off the mountain and into the air.",
      "The bright-hued goddess (and Fitz somehow didn't doubt in the least that she was) smoothed down the fluttering ribbons that made her tunic, then shrugged and smiled over the impossibility of making them something other than what they were: a raven's bait of a distraction, in every color and sheen imaginable, and none of them long enough or concealing enough to keep Fitz from having to bite his tongue.",
      "Constantly.",
      "Bronze skin gleamed here and there under the ribbons, and now and then there was an occasional glimpse of ash blond curls or copper nipples....",
      "Fitz hadn't realized he'd be so grateful to have a beautiful woman turn her back on him.",
      "She's beautiful, Fitz lad, and flattered by the interest -- that was in the eyes -- but so was some kind of warning.",
      "Lord.",
      "Beautiful as Masamune's blades and every bit as dangerous.",
      "Somehow.",
      "He sighed gustily and wished for his pipe.",
      "And I hate getting my blood on blades. <>:<>:<>:<>:<> Don't eat or drink, which is how they caught Persephone.",
      "Take no gifts, Aphrodite said -- that lovely sword.",
      "I wonder if it was real, or a memory of one Kastagir made years back?",
      "He made the most incredible scimitars....",
      "No gifts.",
      "No sound.",
      "Not until I have my sword and something else... sunlight on the blade?",
      "On me?",
      "On both of us?",
      "I'd better be careful.",
      "I imagine the tax bureaus have nothing on a god of the dead who wants to be picky about technicalities.",
      "And stay on the path.",
      "I nearly walked off to borrow that pipe from Darius.",
      "Fitz sighed, certain that 'It was only for a moment,' simply wouldn't be sufficient excuse to the Lord of the Dead.",
      "The list of things he was promising himself when he had a body again was really starting to mount up.",
      "Much like portions of his anatomy, following such lovely ladies out.",
      "The frustrated hiss cut across the silence, laid red-plum frustration across the fading light of the sky, and Fitz turned in surprise.",
      "He knew that voice, too, and the last time Amanda had sounded like that, she'd been dangling over a wall, Duncan leaning on her feet to hold her while she reached (in vain) for an emerald the size of a baby's fist.",
      "When FitzCairn turned, however, he saw two things, not one.",
      "The contrast between them froze him in place as if he'd turned to see Medusa there.",
      "Behind him, to the left, Amanda hung from a mountaineer's rig, the tips of her fingers barely an inch too far from a faceted crystal the size of a cantaloupe.",
      "Farther to his left, though, and within hand's reach, stood a second goddess.",
      "She looked precisely like the one he'd been following, who was within reach of his right hand.",
      "Both goddesses were frowning, at Fitz and at the scene before him.",
      "Then they turned, in unison, and began walking again, and Fitz realized he had no choice but to go with them.",
      "Even if I stay, I won't see Amanda -- I didn't find Ramirez, or Darius, in my wanderings.",
      "He trudged between them, trying not to listen to the aggravated insults being directed at him, and feeling part of his mind still puzzling over something.",
      "Amanda's ropes didn't run to anything, they just faded off.",
      "Fitz frowned, following his lovely guide and almost as distracted by his thoughts as by her long, strong legs swaying and tantalizing under those ribbons.",
      "The frustrated commentary faded away behind him and he sighed in relief, still feeling faintly guilty for not helping a friend get something she so clearly wanted.",
      "Amanda was always sneaky and stubborn, even for one of Rebecca's students -- all that beautiful steel under that lovelier skin was part of her infinite charm....",
      "Surely she'll find something she can use to reach that last inch.",
      "If she'd just wear bras, it wouldn't be a problem.",
      "He could only hope she'd succeeded though, as he followed his guide out.",
      "Hope, and wonder who, exactly, he was following, and who his father might be to have guides like this owing him favors.... <>:<>:<>:<>:<> Fitz could smell things, now, though, and that was almost a forgotten pleasure, like touch, or taste....",
      "The scent of amber and saffron and lemon drifted to him from before and behind him.",
      "Sulfur had been there briefly, although the rotten-egg tinge was long since gone from the air.",
      "Old rock and old earth around him, and the indefinable freshness of night air about to heat...",
      "it was definitely dawn coming, and fresh air ahead.",
      "But they'd been climbing forever.",
      "His feet hurt, his heart ached, and he had the worst case of blue balls in recorded history when his third guide stepped out of the passageway and into a sunlit grove.",
      "She cast a shadow across his feet and Fitz almost wanted to stare at the blackness of it after so much grey, but he was much more interested in the surface.",
      "As he stepped out of the rock crevice, Fitz felt fabric drag at his skin: cotton, denim, leather, wool.",
      "He could almost discern the separate threads and grains of the fabrics and couldn't decide if his skin was crawling or if he wanted to wrap himself up in sensation and roll in it.",
      "His first dawn since that damnable duel with Kalas spread around him in all its considerable beauty.",
      "A morning breeze was rising and it blew his hair around his face, cooled the beads of sweat along nape and hairline.",
      "In the edge of his vision, he saw the sunlight halo into sparks and shimmering rainbows along his companion's silhouette, but he was much more focused on the blade lying abandoned on a boulder in front of him.",
      "The black leather hilt of the scimitar soaked up the morning light, and the scarlet and gold scabbard looked like Spanish work.",
      "The scabbard was Ramirez' doing, Fitz was sure, and wondered how it had come here when he and Kastagir were both dead, and Fitz had been.",
      "He picked up the blade and tested the balance, nearly purring as he pulled sword from sheath.",
      "Kastagir's work, down to the maker's mark carved into the hilt, and beautifully balanced as ever.",
      "Sunlight cut itself on the edge and Fitz felt himself settle onto the earth beneath his boots with a thump that should have been audible.",
      "He was solid again, as he hadn't been in ages... and his stomach was growling.",
      "The twin goddesses smiled at him.",
      "\"Fare well, Hugh FitzCairn,\" the first told him and chuckled.",
      "The second one, who'd never entirely left the cavernous path for the sunlit realms, smiled.",
      "\"Fare you very well.",
      "No doubt that we will see you again one day, but do try not to return to those realms too soon.\"",
      "Fitz smiled at them, looked at the sun on his blade and his hand, and sheathed the scimitar with a single skillful motion.",
      "He double-wrapped the belt around waist and onto hip, settled the blade with a dandy's practiced grace, and bowed to them.",
      "\"Fair goddesses, I cannot thank you enough, but I'll try.\"",
      "The first one laughed, sparks exploding off her with the motion.",
      "\"The way you burn through life will be enough thanks.\"",
      "She glanced at her twin, one eyebrow raising, and then they were both simply... gone.",
      "Fitz spun, looking for them, then laughed as his stomach growled again.",
      "\"A sword, a body, and good boots.",
      "And the grace of their memories.",
      "What more could a man ask for?\"",
      "He considered the path down off the mountain, the question of where exactly he was, and who had inherited his money, and winced.",
      "Food, and passport, and all the other inconveniences necessary in these times....",
      "\"Hmm.",
      "Well.",
      "Maybe a tad bit more, but I think I'd better prevail on more mortal friends for hospitality.\"",
      "Fitz stuck his hands the pocket of his coat, wishing he'd been wearing a cloak in the realms below, and resigned himself to the idea that he'd have to find a way to hide this lovely blade.",
      "He was not giving it up.",
      "He was already whistling as he walked down off the mountain.",
      "It was going to be a gorgeous day.",
      "But then, they all were. <>:<>:<>:<>:<> \"That there be two of you to guide him on any leg was not permitted,\" Hades said softly, intrigued or dangerous, or perhaps both.",
      "\"And you have no twin, Iris.",
      "Who presumes to disguise herself in my realms?\"",
      "The twin goddesses chuckled in unison.",
      "\"Who else would have the power?\" one of them asked, very amused.",
      "Light shifted around her and poured out into the cavern.",
      "The edges were harder, but the danger seemed less that way, nonetheless.",
      "Persephone pushed a long, wavy lock of brown hair back from her face and smiled at him.",
      "\"You're sulking, love.\"",
      "\"He was mine, and you helped him escape, Persephone?\"",
      "Hades watched her, puzzled.",
      "With the fingers of one hand -- the nails had been painted deep purple -- he twisted a ring around and around on the other hand.",
      "Sparks exploded off the black opal again and again as the ring spun on that pale flesh.",
      "\"Why?\"",
      "\"Ah, love, you cheated first.",
      "He'd have never seen me if you hadn't made another spirit look, and sound, like his friend.",
      "Amanda's not dead.",
      "We both know you're not allowed to use her yet.\"",
      "Persephone walked up to Hades -- Ruler of the Underworld, Lord of Death and Dreams, master of riches incalculable, oldest son of Cronos and possibly the most dangerous -- and raised his hand to her mouth to kiss it.",
      "Against her sun-gilded skin, his pallor stood out more clearly.",
      "Her lips were dark red as the juice of fresh blackberries.",
      "Hades sighed, resigned or pleased, or perhaps both, and touched her cheek with the other hand.",
      "His fingers traced her skin gently, reverent as if she were fragile or easily stained, or perhaps both.",
      "\"Why, though, my lovely wife?",
      "If you wished him freed, could you not have asked me?",
      "Am I that fearsome to you?\"",
      "Iris chuckled softly.",
      "\"Lord Hades, you never looked closely at that one, did you?\"",
      "\"He was Hermes' son, Iris.",
      "I treated him accordingly, when it came time for judgment.",
      "A kindly man, in his own way.",
      "What did I not see?\" Hades didn't look at the messenger goddess, only at his wife.",
      "\"Ah, love.",
      "If I'd asked you to free him, you'd have worried I wished to leave you.\"",
      "Persephone cradled the hand against her cheek with her own, and shifted the one she'd kissed down to rest over her heart, between her breasts.",
      "Green silk slid against Hades' fingers as she said, \"And he was yours, my deadly love, but he was also ours.\"",
      "Hades' mouth drew down only the most minute amount, but the light in the cavern began to fade and the temperature slid downward, as well.",
      "His wife's nipples were already tight, he saw, and knew it had nothing to do with cold, or at least not the cold of the cavern. \"",
      "'Ours,' you say.",
      "Who is this 'we,' then, Persephone?",
      "Your mother's?\" Iris bowed to him respectfully, brave enough to invite his attention away from his wife.",
      "\"Not at all, my lord, in the sense you mean.",
      "None of our children are fertile, which means the Lady Persephone's mother has but little interest in most of them.",
      "Hugh FitzCairn was yours when he was dead, my lord, but in life, he was a worshipper of all goddesses and all women.\"",
      "Persephone chuckled and slid her husband's hands down over her breasts, purring at such a cold touch against such tender skin.",
      "\"He was a rake, a womanizer, and a lover of all things female.",
      "Aphrodite is still purring over his thoughts for her, and even Helen would have happily bedded him, Hades.\"",
      "Her voice dropped to a husky murmur which Iris tactfully ignored, as a messenger so often must.",
      "\"Notice to whom I returned, my lord husband.",
      "Do feel free to make a most... intimate inspection to be sure I did not bed him.\"",
      "Amusement had, finally, begun to lighten Hades' eyes.",
      "\"I begin to understand.",
      "Shall we conduct this conversation elsewhere?",
      "Where we can discuss the penalties for such trickery and use of power in these realms for which I am responsible?\"",
      "\"Ah, under penalty does sound so pleasurable of a sudden,\" Persephone whispered to him, and the two of them vanished away, leaving the cavern lighter in appearance and atmosphere both. <>:<>:<>:<>:<> Hermes stretched, enjoying the feel of his own gender again and the freedom from the jiggle and sway that even so trim a goddess as Iris endured.",
      "Female form was fun for mischief, but he preferred his own shape.",
      "How his son Hermaphroditus endured the disadvantages of both, he'd never know.",
      "The breeze skittered around him, tousling his hair, and Hermes leaped onto it to skim down the air and check that Fitz was in fact headed towards civilization.",
      "Once he knew where his son was headed, he could prod a few likely (and deserving) marks towards him.",
      "Besides.",
      "He wanted to stay away from the entrances to the Underworld for a day or three, until Hades got over any lingering irritation.",
      "It would be safe to visit again after that.",
      "Persephone had thought it a waste to leave Fitz in the Underworld, and she'd make her point to her husband.",
      "Or make the most of his point, however it should be phrased.",
      "Hermes grinned, remembering how smoothly she'd handled Hades and wishing, again, that he'd made a pass at either of them centuries ago.",
      "Pity Hades was so involved in her.",
      "He was dangerous enough to be fun.... No",
      ". Hermes would be safe enough there on Zeus or Hera's business, but over all, it might be safest to give the couple a few days to work out the balance of power between themselves again.",
      "No matter how tempting it was to meddle.",
      "Hermes trailed rainbows across the hills of Greece as he went, a thank you to Iris for the use of her appearance, and laughed to have set his son loose on the world again.",
      "More mischief, more havoc, more deals made and changed....",
      "The world needed more men like Hugh FitzCairn.",
      "So did the women of the world.",
      "A wide grin spread across his face as Hermes wondered, again, how well Aphrodite might reward a messenger who could swear that her most faithful follower had made it into the world again....",
      "Oh, yes.",
      "It was going to be a gorgeous day again.",
      "But then, they all were. <>:<>:<>:<>:<> An end <>:<>:<>:<>:<> Comments, Commentary, & Miscellanea: The sea-foam goddess is, of course, Aphrodite.",
      "The human woman who set the mold for all Mediterranean beauties is, of course, Helen of Troy.",
      "(If this description doesn't match Homer's, I can only point out that that he was writing poetry and I'm working with myth....) Persephone first appeared in the guise of Iris, the other messenger of the gods and a frequent visitor to the Underworld.",
      "Vanzetti and Taz suggested perils, and Vanzetti reminded me that where Hades is concerned, Persephone is almost certainly involved.",
      "Many thanks to both, and to my quick (and encouraging) betas!"

    "text": "It seemed Cassandra had always been on the island and Diana always fascinated by her. She remembers the respect Hippolyta afforded the prophetess. The awe with which she was treated by the Amazons. She kept herself apart from the women, living in a small house by the sea, seperate and mysterious. She had been brought to Themyscira by Athena herself, who had asked the Queen to give the woman of Troy shelter. Protection. Most of the Amazons, knowing of the war of Troy, Cassandra's curse, and her own wish to be left alone did so gladly. Cassandra was no Amazon though she had been given the same gifts as any Amazon. A gift of welcome and a guarantee that no man would ever treat her again the way she had suffered in her life before. She was one of them in name but little more and she made no effort to grow to know the sisterhood of the Nation. She lived in her self-imposed exile, seemingly content, for many years. Diana had always been curious about her, catching glimpses of the woman walking on the sand, standing on a rock and staring out at the horizon. She'd always wondered. Had coaxed her mother to tell her everything of the woman by the sea. Hippolyta had reluctantly told her daughter of Cassandra's life. Of the gift Apollo had given her and then twisted when the young woman had refused to give herself to him. She spoke of Cassandra's tortured life, how many had thought her mad because of that curse. Never believing what the woman spoke was truth. Diana had always wondered if it were possible to break the curse, she hoped it was, the loneliness that seemed to cloak Cassandra was a tangible pain that she empathized with greatly. She'd determined then, that somehow, she would find a way to break Apollo's curse. Her mother, touched by her daughter's compassion, had gently questioned her desire. Cassandra was a priestess of Athena, were there anyone that could break such a curse it would have been the goddess herself. Diana had stubbornly insisted that, perhaps, was why Athena had asked to bring the prophetess there. Hippolyta hadn't been able to argue that. She knew better than anyone the curses gods could lay upon those that walked the Earth. She knew too, that sometimes, curses were broken. It pained her to admit, she did not believe, no matter how determined Diana was, that Cassandra's was one of them. But Diana, in all her stubbornness, was fixed upon the idea to try. She'd begun spending time on the beach, near the land upon which Cassandra's home rested. Many times she would see the woman move about the land around her home. Tending a small garden, feeding what birds would reach the island, and sometimes just staring at the sea for hours at a time as if communing with Poseidon himself. Days would turn into weeks and weeks into months and Diana would faithfully visit the beach, never venturing closer. Unwilling to encroach upon Cassandra's sanctuary until bidden welcome by the lady herself. When the moment came, when Diana looked up to find Cassandra standing over her, hair wafting in the breeze, she'd still been so very surprised. What she'd been most surprised by was the sudden wave of nervousness that had overcome her. And how beautiful, and so very sad, Cassandra's eyes were. \"Come...\" Cassandra had murmured, holding out her hand. \"It is the day.\" \"The day?\" Diana had been so very confused by the statement and she'd wondered if that was not how everyone who met Cassandra felt. If, perhaps, that was how Apollo had cursed her so. But she did not say so. She would not. \"The day of what?\" A smile had touched the other woman's face, a gentle, knowing, and perhaps weary, smile. \"The day upon which we are to meet.\" Cassandra seemed always to know everything and yet she always said nothing. They became friends, she and the princess, and sometimes, sometimes, Diana would have the feeling Cassandra knew more than would speak. That she had seen things that lay ahead for Diana's future but she did not offer anything beyond the occasional cryptic statement and looks filled with things that she did not understand. As curious as she was, Diana would not ask, did not want to ask Cassandra to risk the curse again. Fearing that, somehow, she would not believe what the other woman would say and she didn't ever want to do that to Cassandra. The world of men had done such and Themyscira was not the world of men. It was to be Cassandra's sanctuary. Diana wasn't sure when she lost her heart to the prophetess, when it went from compassion and friendship to something else entirely but she does remember the moment she knew. Walking up the path to Cassandra's home and seeing the other woman in the doorway, dressed in a gown the color of the sea, and looking to Diana as if she'd just descended from Olympus itself. Cassandra had smiled when she reached her, holding out her hand as she had upon the day they'd met and, when Diana had taken it, leaned forward to lightly brush a kiss upon her lips. \"Is this the day upon which we are to love?\" Diana's voice had trembled when she'd the question, certain every emotion she felt was written across her soul and laid bare for the other woman to see. There hadn't been an immediate answer to her question, not one voiced in any spoken language. Cassandra had drawn her into her home and taken her to her bed. There, Diana had, with surprisingly sure hands, removed the soft gown from the seer's body and seen there the scars left by Troy. She'd done her best to soothe each one, her touch bringing soft cries of pleasure to Cassandra's lips and a hint of tears to her eyes. She can remember, afterwards, laying her head upon the older woman's breast, fingers toying with a lock of her hair and hearing Cassandra murmur, \"Rest, Diana, we will have many days upon which we are to love.\" Diana had believed then, that this was to be where she would spend her life. In Cassandra's arms, in her bed, and her life. That some day she would rule the Amazons with Cassandra by her side and it would be this way until her days came to an end. If her days came to an end. But she was wrong. Cassandra's visions sometimes came to her in dreams, violent nightmares that would cause her to thrash in her sleep, striking out blindly. Diana became accustomed to these dreams, soothing the images away, but one night Cassandra's visions came to her in a dream and she woke first, peacefully. Diana awoke to find her lover staring at her silently, eyes solemn. She'd asked what was troubling Cassandra, if she had seen something, and the other woman would not answer. Instead, it was Cassandra who had loved Diana that night, her lips and hands bringing the princess to a feverish pitch before letting her fall into orgasm. Much later, when Diana had been slipping into sleep once more, she'd heard whispered, \"Someday, my princess, you will leave this island...forbidden to return.\" She'd fallen asleep with a denial on her lips. It was many, many years later when she walked onto the Javelin, surrounded by the Justice League, that she saw Cassandra, watching from beneath a tree and those whispered words came back to her with a rush of shame. She hadn't believed. Like the thousands before her, she hadn't believed. And, like the people of Troy, her home was lost to her because of it. But worse still...she had failed to believe. She had failed to believe. She had failed Cassandra.",

    "text": "October 31, 1996 She knelt in the intersection of two hill paths that didn't warrant the name 'road,' upright and at home as the pine saplings growing on either side. The moon hadn't risen over the mountains yet, and she wore dark fabrics with no sheen to them. Rough cotton or wool, Krycek thought, not the shadowed pool of black but something barely lighter: forest shadows green, dried blood red, or maybe charcoal gray. Her hair was black, her face a pale triangle under it with cheekbones he could have sharpened his blades on. Her hands were the other visible things in the night -- darker than her face but not tan, long, strong fingers with silver rings, constantly moving as she sectioned and combed smooth hair with no glimmer of light on it or in it or through it, not even reflected light from her rings or Krycek's firefly of a flashlight. Krycek settled to his knees almost in front of her, eye to eye, and he'd made very sure that he wasn't on either path. \"Lady.\" She smiled without baring her teeth and answered in English, \"If a man has no home, then all places are equally far from it, I think.\" \"I'm here to make a deal,\" Krycek said, sticking to his point rather than tangle himself in her logic. Concealing his expressions was habit; holding still the aches beneath them was another matter, but he did it. Her smile tilted further up at the edges and she murmured, \"Oh, yes. Everyone comes to me to trade, man. Would you bargain with me?\" Krycek shook his head once, and tried not to think how alike they were with their dark hair and dark clothes and pale faces in the night. \"No one gets the better of bargains with you, not that I've ever heard. No one even lies and claims they did, Lady.\" Her hands came to a stop in the midnight of her hair and now her smile bared teeth that made Krycek breathe deeply, once, to still his heartbeat against terror. White teeth, white as a well-fed child's, and lips dark purple as ripe cherries -- there was nothing inhuman about her, yet his heart wanted to pound. \"No,\" she whispered, and the trees whispered it back. \"No. No one does. Wise man. One of the few. What would you have of me, then? An ear to hear, an eye to see, a foot to know the path? All these you have already, son of my daughter.\" Krycek accepted and ignored his fear with a practiced thought and said evenly, \"My enemies move through shadows, recover from things that should be death. And they are not all from here, Lady.\" \"No,\" she said softly. \"They are not.\" The ground trembled under Krycek, and she asked more quietly again, \"What would you have from me and what will you pay?\" \"Give me what I need.\" He forced the next words out through a throat full of ashes and acid. \"And take what payment is due that will still leave me able to do what must be done.\" She tilted her head to study him, surprised for the first time that night. \"Well, well, well. Had you not closed that so, child, it might have been your death.\" \"And it may yet. I know.\" Krycek nodded. \"But not until I can destroy them, Lady. If they win, who will come and make bargains with you?\" \"Not them,\" she agreed and her hands began to move again, parting, sectioning, and combing hair that fell into the shadows around her. \"So be it.\" A scream behind his shoulder came from a mountain cat; when Krycek whipped his head back around she was gone. Three weeks later, so was his left arm. # # # At the dark of the moon, he collapsed in a field of winter wheat, and rolled to protect what was left of his arm with a need so new it was not yet reflex. Oak trees rustled and whispered around the field's edges, still dressed in dead, drab leaves that declined to fall. Pain traced white lines along his vision, drew unknown constellations among the stars. The wind bit at him from that clear sky and Krycek whispered, \"Damn you.\" \"I could poison all of Rome with your bitterness,\" the breeze murmured. The hay rustled around him, whispering, \"You made the bargain.\" \"I paid,\" Krycek grated out around the spark and scream of truncated muscle and bone, of nerves trying to transmit signals that could not be received. \"For what?\" An owl flew past, almost noiseless. In its wake, Krycek heard the susurrus of words. \"Silver and shadow, son of my daughter.\" A canine or lupine howled, \"Your arm is not gone, it is no longer where you expect.\" Green eyes reflected the last of the light from a city miles away and someone asked, \"What will you open with it, where will you reach with it?\" He woke in the morning amid concentric circles of different tracks, small and large, and wondered if the wolf and the deer really had been dancing. That convinced him it was time to eat his last energy bar and stumble out to civilization again. # # # Krycek spent six weeks cursing his way through learning to use a prosthetic over skin not yet healed. Six weeks of weaning himself off painkillers whose muzziness he couldn't afford. Six weeks of convincing underlings and thugs, minions and hirelings and henchmen that he wasn't an easy target. (He made three hardened criminals, muggers who'd kill a nun for the day's collection, piss themselves one night by smiling at them and reciting the Blazing Saddles litany of recruits. It was in English and they spoke German and Czech, but they paled and ran and his laughter ran after them, taking his breath with it.) Six weeks of pain and strain, his energy drained by the trauma, his mind dulled by the constant catch in his movements, the inconstant reminders that he was no longer whole. Six weeks and one night he looked up at the moon through glass imperfections in a cottage the Englishman had mentioned, absently, in the way that meant going there was an order. The moon came and went, larger and then smaller, round and then imperfect, dark and then light, and Krycek snarled at it, banging his good hand on the desk in frustration. And felt his left hand hit the desk, curl through the wood, and trip a latch within that he hadn't suspected was there. He froze, wondering already if this was madness, but when he turned on the reading lamp, a compartment lay open. Krycek ran the fingers of his right hand over the inlaid section of wood that functioned as door as well as decoration, then deliberately turned the light off again. It took seven tries before he could reach in with his left hand, the arm which felt the poisoned needle slide through and only sent whispered messages of cold fog and the bitter taste of unripe almonds in the back of his throat. Then the fingers he couldn't see closed around an equally invisible slim, leather-bound journal. If his missing arm had dripped blood on the book, there was nothing to see when the light came back on. # # # Lying in his bed that night, good arm outside the duvet and his nonexistent arm flexing and stretching under the down comforter, Alex Krycek watched the moonlight paint its path across the ceiling. The drawn window hangings murmured to him in a rustle of cloth. \"And now, son of my daughter?\" \"Now, mother of my mother,\" Krycek whispered back. \"Now, I begin to see. Shadows, you said, and the backs of mirrors are silver.\" Soft laughter fell around him with the dust motes in the moonlight. \"Shadows of doors and canyons, silver of mirrors and windows and water. What think you of my price now?\" \"I think,\" Krycek whispered, \"that I'll thank You most properly with the conspirators' hearts in the palm of my left hand.\" \"Silver, and shadow, and sinister,\" sang the owl outside the window. \"Yes,\" hissed the radiator, and then the night was silent. Krycek closed his eyes, and smiled with hidden teeth, and fell asleep dreaming of the silver tips of leaves in moonlight and the shadows between windows in New York buildings. ~~~ finis ~~~ Comments, Commentary, & Miscellanea: Philip of Macedon -- father to Alexander the Great, a great warrior in his own right, and one of his most protracted wars was with his wife, Olympia, said to be a priestess of Hecate. Hecate is goddess of the crossroads, the dark of the moon, dark magic, dark hounds, and dark bargains. There have been claims through history of witches braiding spells, tangling fates, or smoothing futures with the twining or releasing of their hair. Yes, Tunguska/Terma is set in early November, per the X-Files Timeline. Ah, yes, Hedley Lamarr's classic list of villains to hire to assault Rock Ridge: \"I want rustlers, cut throats, murderers, bounty hunters, desperados, mugs, pugs, thugs, nitwits, halfwits, dimwits, vipers, snipers, con men, Indian agents, Mexican bandits, muggers, buggerers, bushwhackers, hornswogglers, horse thieves, bull dykes, train robbers, bank robbers, ass-kickers, shit-kickers and Methodists.\" And if you've never heard this list, go watch Blazing Saddles. Call it an antidote to this. The Englishman -- also known as Well-Manicured Man. Be grateful I've never made him an immortal. He's terrifying enough now. Mirrors are made by applying a thin layer of silver to the back of a sheet of glass. No, I don't know what's in the journal, but I don't doubt it's useful. Last, and not least: Inspired by various quotes from Neil Gaiman's Books of Magic). To wit: This they know:... The darkness is there. The darkness is waiting. And the things in the darkness They whisper before they feast. They are to be placated and persuaded, They are to be loved and sacrificed to, They are to be prayed to and distrusted. And so there is magic. The witch-queen always has three face; who waits at the crossroads, for your sacrifices, Waits in the underworld, In the sacred groves, In the moon. She sits beneath a dead king, hanging from a tree branch, And will show you all manner of elegant charms. -- At the heart of every mystery, Whispers the twice-born boy, who rose from the dead, -- is the grain of my corn and the wine of my blood. \"I am the mistress of all mirrors, woman. Give me the boy, or one night your reflection will sneak out of its frame and cut your sleeping throat.\" \"He dances on the edge of the known, like a crazy man, pitting himself against heaven and the pit, because he is John Constantine, and he is alive.\" I hope you enjoyed.",

    "text": "The pup, gray and slender and whip-quick, lacking the two extra heads of her mother, looked, Cerberus told Charon, like her father--a fine sighthound belonging to King Eurystheus, met and mated with in a moment's quick passion in the world of the living. Charon nodded and thought of her own daughter's father--an explorer, drowned in a sea crossing, newly brought into the Roman religion before his death and still unsure of its gods and customs. He hadn't known enough to fear her. He had asked her questions and listened carefully and kissed her, to stop her leading him onto the boat, to prove to himself and to her that he couldn't possibly be dead. She had let him kiss her, and more, and then she had ferried him across the Styx into the underworld, like any other soul. Her daughter's hair was dark brown, not black, and she had color to her, as though she had not lived all of her life in the underworld. She smelled of water, but not of the cold deep still water of the Styx. She smelled of the sea, the scent of her father. The pup and the girl grew up together, nameless, because they were something like gods, and gods' names are left to mortals. The pup learned to guard the gate of Hades, to stare coldly at the newly dead and raise the fur on her ruff and make low sounds in her throat like rocks settling against each other. She learned to seem as implacable as death itself, ever-present and watching. For all her narrow, fine-boned hunting body, she learned to frighten and to command respect. The girl never learned her own mother's work so well as the pup did hers. She listened to the dead and asked them about their lives and took her time ferrying them over the Styx. Some of the dead, those new to the religion of Rome, told the girl stories, in a language that was Latin, but Latin accented heavy and strange, about a sea that many died in crossing--that they had died in crossing. It was a godless sea, they said, a place where you could call out and offer your soul and your service and your life and receive no help from any god of Rome. After years of the Styx and the dead and the underworld, the girl became a woman, and she ran away. The dog came with her, because the dog had learned to be most implacable and ever-present when it came to her friend. The woman and the dog found the sea that the dead spoke of; and, soon after, the sailors that braved it to trade with Rome began to have their prayers answered. The captain would see a dog in the waves, gray as the low sky above and the tearing water below; and he would turn, at a touch on the shoulder, to glimpse for one instant a woman, robe undisturbed by the wind but dark hair blown wild by it--and that was all. But afterwards the ship and all aboard would come safe through the storm. The sailors gave the woman a name, in their language, which was not the Latin of Rome. They called her Nehalennia, and the dog became Markuon, and when Charon and Cerberus came, years later, to bring their daughters back home, Nehalennia and Markuon showed them the engraved stones that the sailors offered to them and the temple that had been built for them, and they refused to return. Charon and Cerberus argued with their daughters. They told them the living world changed quickly, and that, though the Styx and the underworld would endure, this one sea passage and this one small people who left stones engraved in Latin but who spoke and named in a different tongue might soon pass away. The pantheon of Rome would last, but the beliefs of these people would fade, and Nehalennia and Markuon (and the names, which were not of Rome or Greece, did not come easily to the mothers' tongues) might well fade with them. They told their daughters to come back--to stay with them and be safe. But the daughters said no and stayed in the world of the living, and their mothers let them stay. They were worshipped and grew closer and closer to each other and to the sea and the shore and to the people that they had chosen. Until, one day, a flood rushed down the river into their sea and tore away their temple and the stones that had been offered to them, and the people, homes and lives devastated, did not replace them. They moved on and away, leaving Nehalennia and Markuon behind. As the woman and the dog were quiet together, making a decision in silence by their sea, Charon and Cerberus came and asked their daughters if they would come home, now. They told them to come back and be sure of themselves and of their place in the universe and of what they presided over. Come back and be part of death and of Rome-that-will-endure. But again the daughters said no. They said they had become gods of passages, as their mothers were gods of one passage. They would go with the people who had become theirs. They would help them through whatever passages they might face. So they went, a dark-haired woman and a sky-gray dog, and Charon and Cerberus watched them go, and grieved.",

    "text": "The Moon and Sun were lovers since the beginning of time,But their love would be torn away by a terrible crime.Sadly as a crying dove,Soon ended their heavenly love.But soon, as time would tell,Two would fall into their eternal love well. Death brought them apart,These heavenly lovers.But they were bound together,Forever.Reborn again to life,And falling once more in love. Deception blinded both by lies,But soon truth would come forth.Finding each other once again,Bringing them together once more. At first, they felt no love.But as time would pass,They soon felt the warmth that was once there before.Loving each other,Now and forever. Now the Moon and Sun are one more,Opening love's door.Can they be together now,Or will Death bring them once more down? The full Moon gleamed bright and illuminated the hill with its silver glow. Two figures stood side-by-side on the top of the hill; digits linked together at the sides. One was green, and one was yellow. The green one turned his head towards the yellow one next to him and smiled. \"You look lovely in the Moonlight, Apollo\" the green one said. The yellow one turned his head towards the green one and smiled as well. \"You look lovely too, Artemis\" Apollo said to Artemis. A light blush crept onto Artemis's face plate. Then both turned their heads forward. Soon, Artemis began singing a small hymn. For the Sun who shines the brightest in the Noon Sky,I fell in love with you.For my Apollo,I love you with all my Spark. A small smile crept on Apollo's dental plate, and then Apollo began his own hymn. For the Moon who shines the brightest in the Midnight Sky,I fell in love with you.For my Artemis,I love you with all my Spark. Now Artemis was one that smile now. He turned and faced Apollo and stared into Artemis's blue optics. Then slowly, he leaned forward. Their lips were just inches apart, and Artemis whispered, \"I love you, my Sun.\" Apollo whispered back, \"I love you, my Moon.\" They closed their optics and leaned in closer, and they were about to kiss, when suddenly a loud explosion shook the hill and sent the two bots flying in the air. Artemis landing on the ground with a THUD, and a daze took over. The daze would have continued, but a loud scream of his lover shook him out of it. \"APOLLO!\" he yelled and jumped up. His optics widely scanned the area, and then they grew wide when he saw what had happened to his lover. Hades was holding Apollo by one of his servos. The large grey bot had a wicked smirked on his faceplates. Artemis took a step forward, while un-sheathing his stingers, and growled, \"Let Him Go!\" Hades just chuckled. \"Mine now\" his hissed, and then his transformed and flew off. Artemis, though in vain, ran after the ship flying away, while carrying his lover. While he was running, he tripped, and the earth made contact with his face plate. \"Apollo...\" he mourned, \"Apollo...my Sun...\" But then hope flared up, and he jumped up. He soon began running towards the base. He ran and ran. For his lover, for Apollo, his Sun. While, running through the woods and then finally out of them, another jet attacked him. It was the Harpy. It transformed and shot his fire canon at him, but he managed to dodge it. Artemis fired his stingers at the Harpy, but the Harpy was quick. \"So sorry, but ve Lord sayz that vou can't make it back to ze otherz!\" said the Icy Harpy. Artemis just growled and continued fighting back. He thought he had the upper hand, but a blast from the Harpy sent him flying and hitting the ground. He didn't move, pain flared through his body. The Harpy walked over and put a pede on Artemis's back. \"Stupid bot...\" the Harpy said in a crackling mad voice. The Harpy pushed Artemis further into the ground. Quickly, the green bot sent out a distress signal, but the pede was lifted off his back and swiftly kicked his side, sending him flying. Artemis hit a tree was a loud CRACK, and soon darkness took a hold of him. But all Artemis could think about was his lover Apollo. My dear Sun... Artemis, though in the darkness of his mind, heard voices around him on the outside. The voices continued and then slowly began to fade away. Silence once again came forth. Slowly, he on-lined his optics, and the outside world began hazy and then clear. He was in the Med. Bay of the base. He reached up and rubbed the side of his helm; then realization struck him. He immediately sat up and yelled, \"APOLLO!\" There was a loud CLANG, and curses, and soon Hestia came walking in, a scowl on his face. He walked over and ordered Artemis to, \"Hush kid, quit ya yelling!\" Artemis turned his head and glared at the mech, who glared right back. But soon, Artemis's glare faded, and he bowed his head. \"Apollo...\" he muttered and then brought his legs up to his chest. Hestia's glare faded away to pity, and he placed a servo on Artemis's shoulder. \"Don't worry...we'll find him...don't worry...\" Hestia reassured, which caused Artemis to look up at the red and white mech. Hestia smiled a small, reassuring smile, and a small smile tug at Artemis's lips. Then medic turned and walked away, and the small smile fell from Artemis's lips. Later on... Artemis was sitting on the side of the medical berth, and he himself was staring at the floor, thinking about Apollo. Soon, he felt a breeze of wind and looked up to see Hermes standing before him. \"HowAreYouFeeling,Artmeis?\" the blue speedster sincerely asked. Artemis stared at the blue mech in front of him and then shifted his glance away. \"I am fine Hermes, just...sad...\" Artemis replied, hurt lining the last part of his statement. Hermes's sky-blue optics softened. He placed a servo on Artemis's shoulder, which caused the green mech to look up, and said, \"Don'tWorry,We'llFindApollo...JustYouWait!\" A small silver of a smile lit up the blue bot face. Artemis struggle and barely succeeded in forming a smile on his own dental plates. Then, in a gust of wind, the blue blur shot out of the Med. Bay. In the Monitor Room... Both Poseidon and Athena were watching the screens for any sign of Hades or his minions. They were also worry about Apollo, hoping that he was alright. They felt a gust of wind behind them, and they turned to see the blue speedster Hermes standing there with his servos crossed over his chest. \"What is it Hermes?\" Poseidon asked, optic ridge raised. Athena also had his optic ride raised. \"!\" the blue speedster said, \"AndWhereHeIsKeepingArtmeis!\" Poseidon thought about then, turned his head to Athena, turned it back, and then nodded. \"Alright, but don't engage in a fight with Hades or any of his minions, okay?\" Poseidon ordered/asked. Hermes nodded his head and shot out of the base. Athena turned and faced Poseidon. \"Do you think that was wise Poseidon?\" the black and gold mech asked. The red and blue mech looked way and then looked towards Athena. \"I hope so Athena, I hope so...\" At Hades's underground base... The large sliver mech sat in his throne, a scowl on his face. He was thinking of what he should do with his little 'prize'. The 'prize' was currently lying in a cell on the opposite side of the throne room. Apollo was still unconscious and lying on his stomach in the cage of Hades' base. A couple of scratches marked his body. Inside of his processor, the yellow mech drifted in the darkness. Artemis...where are you? Artemis...are you coming to find me...My Moon...where are you? These words echoed in his mind. He was worried, not for himself, but for his lover. Was Artemis injured...or worst? Fear pierced the darkness, which made him come to the reality of the outside world. Apollo groaned and on-lined his optics. The world and ground were a dark grey, which worried Apollo. He instantly pushed himself up and back up into the wall. While scanning the area around him and outside the cage, his optics stopped on Hades, and they soon grew big. He gasped, which caught Hades' attention. \"Well, well...looks like the little Apollo is awake\" the huge sliver mech said, and then stood up and began his way towards the yellow mech. Fear racked through Apollo's body, and he tried to push the wall back, vainly trying to keep more distance from the approaching Hades. The large mech stopped at the entrance of the cage and paused. \"What do with you little Apollo? What to do?\" Apollo was now trembling with fear. Then Hades stopped pondering, and a smirk formed on his dental plates. \"Bait...\" The red optics stared at the trembling bot, and a servo began to open the cage. Hades began into the cage with Apollo. Soon, the underground base was filled with screams of pain. In the Rec. Room... Artemis sat on the couch with arms crossed on top of his legs and leaning over, and his head bowed. He had been counting the cracks in the floor, which suddenly a gust of wind blew into the base. Artemis looked up and saw the blue blur shot in and skid to a stop. \"Poseidon,Poseidon!I'veFoundHim!I'veFoundHim!\" Hermes called out to the empty Rec. Room, hoping to get the red and blue mech who he was calling. Instantly, Artemis body went rigid. Him? Did Hermes find-... The green mech jumped up and ran over to the blue speedster. \"Hermes, who did you find? WHO DID YOU FIND?!\" Artemis cried out, grabbing one of Hermes's arms. He shook at it, yelling the same statement before. Hermes looked down and was about to reply, when another voice beat him to it. \"Artemis, let go of Hermes\" said Poseidon as he walked in. Artemis was kneeling, hanging to Hermes's arm. He jerked his head up and glared at Poseidon. \"Not in till Hermes tell me who he has found!\" Artemis yelled back. The green bot looked up at the blue bot, waiting for the answer. Hermes met Artemis's optics, then looked over to Poseidon. Poseidon nodded, and Hermes bowed his head. \"I've...I'veFoundApollo...\" Artemis gasped, nearly having a spark attack. Poseidon nodded and comm.-ed the others to come. All seven of them were walking through the forest that lay on the outskirts of the city. Everyone's guards were up, and one green mech in particular was also worried. Hermes said he had spotted Hades and his minions out here, he had also seen Apollo, but there was no way of getting him, not with Hades around. So, the blue speedster headed back to get the others. They were making their way through, but then stopped on the outskirts of a clearing. What was in the middle of the clearing is what made them stop. A little yellow form was lying there, pink stains marked his body, as well as, the grass. Artemis gasp, and before he could think about his actions, he launched forward. He rushed out into the clearing, wanting to get to Apollo before the yellow mech could offline. What the green mech didn't know was that Hades and his three minions, Harpy, Cerberus, and Ares, were watching from inside the forest. When Artemis was half towards his fallen love, a blast shot out of the forest and shot him. It sent him flying and ended up hitting a tree. He slid down the tree, and barely managed to keep his optics on. The green mech slowly reached out, wanting to reach his love. \"A...pol...lo...\" Artemis managed to mutter through his cracked and leaking dental plated, before darkness took hold of him. By this time, the others had come out and attack Hades and his minions. Hestia ran towards Apollo, while Athena reached over to Artemis. Hestia then nodded to the black and gold mech to follow him back to the base. Hopefully he could save the two mechs. He slowly began to power up his optics. Everything inside of his processor was fuzzy and hard to think straight. He couldn't yet remember why he was her, whenever here was. Soon, once his optics were fully online, he scanned the area above him. It was a ceiling. It took a bit, then he realized it was the ceiling in the Med. Bay. MED. BAY?! Artemis jerked his body up, but soon he slumped forward. His whole body, spark in all, was heavy and in pain. \"Uggg...\" he vocalized the pain and slowly laid back down. He was about to fall into recharge, but soon an image of Apollo flashed in his mind. Apollo...where is Apollo... He looked around and turned his head to get a better view of the room, when the person in the berth next to his stopped his search. It was Apollo. The yellow mech was hooked up to a spark monitor and an IV drip of Energon. Artemis reached out with his hand towards his lover, but couldn't reach. \"A...pol...lo...I'm so sorry I couldn't protect you...\" Artemis began, tears began to fall as well, \"I'm sorry...\" Then the green mech turned his head up, and began to look at the ceiling. He also placed his arm once again next to him, and shut off his optics. I'm sorry Apollo... The pain. There had been pain that filled his world when Hades had been beating him. Pain. It lasted so long that soon, nothing in the world matter. He couldn't feel anything else. The one thing that kept him tethered to the world of the Living was that of his lover Artemis. Artemis...where are you...Artemis, are you still alive...Artemis...my Moon... He lived through the pain and torture only for the green mech he loved so dearly. He had to, for something inside of him told him that Artemis was not dead. So, he lived and bared the pain for his lover. A lover he would soon see again. Artemis...I am coming for you...your Sun is coming... Then, the pain stopped. He didn't know why, but it did. Soon, the pain just disappeared. After that, Apollo then decided to come out of the unconscious world and into the outside reality. He slowly on-lined his optics and saw the ceiling that did not belong to the base that Hades had worked in. Then, a pressure on his right servo made him turn his head. A raspy gasp escaped his vocalizer, and fluids threatened to leak from his optics. There, resting his own helm on Apollo's servo, was Artemis. The green mech had his face plates turned towards him, but his optics were closed. Apollo couldn't move much, only a few twitches. But the yellow mech wanted jump up and embrace his lover. He hugged him and... \"Ar..tem..is...\" Apollo managed to mutter out, and the yellow mech managed to twitch his servo. Then the yellow mech turned his head back up and shut his optics off. It hadn't work, he hadn't gotten Artemis up. He wished to cry to heavens, and Apollo was about to fall into recharge and try to forget the outside world, when a voice made him quickly on-line his optics and turn his head to the side. \"Apol...lo...\" Artemis muttered, still having his optics off. But that was not for long, for soon the green mech's optics came on-line and stared at Apollo's own optics. They were locked in a staring contest, that was in till Artemis threw a servo over his lover's chest and buried his helm into the yellow mech's neck. \"Apollo! You're awake, you're alive!\" The yellow mech then wrapped his own servos around the green mech and held tight. \"Yes Artemis, I'm am awake. I am so glad you are all right too...\" Apollo replied, his voice a little less raspy. The yellow then felt liquids leaking into his neck wires. Apollo patted his lover on the back and slowly began to sit up. Artemis shifted and sat on the side of the berth, sitting next to Apollo. His servos were still around his lover's neck, and face still buried into the yellow mech's neck. Apollo, who was now sitting, still had his servos wrapped Artemis frame. Then Artemis spoke, \"Apollo...I am so sorry I couldn't keep you from Hades...I am so sorry I couldn't protect you...I...\" Apollo cut him off with a soft 'shush' and reply, \"It is alright Artemis...it is alright...I am here now, and I will always be here for you...My Moon...\" Then the green mech shifted and sat up facing Apollo. Their optics were locked, and Artemis leaned closer in. \"Apollo...my lovely Sun...I will never leave you...I love you forever...\" Artemis whispered when his and Apollo's lips were mere inches apart. Then Apollo replied, \"I will always be here too Artemis...my beautiful Moon...I love you forever...\" Then, they leaned in closer, shuttered their optics off, and their lips finally met. I was a soft but loving kiss that they held together. To them, it felt like forever was passing them by, but they didn't care. They were going to be together, forever. Then, they slowly broke the kiss and touched foreheads. \"I love you...\" they said together, a soft smile forming on both of their lips. The Sun and Moon,Lovers forever.Together they will be,And not death will they never part.For they are together,Till always.",

    "text": "It was a summer day in a charming village on the southwest coast of a particular England. Further description is probably unnecessary. The Author would like nothing better than to stretch out for a few paragraphs of tangy salt air, cheeky seabirds, and tourists looking dubiously at their white boating shoes and the baskets of shrimp on the pier. But the story, by its lack of angst, erratic capitalization, and elliptical conversation fragments, already stretches the bounds of speculative fiction; it will therefore be assumed that the Reader is tolerably familiar with the features of a seaside resort and doesn't need a great whack of wordcount on the subject. The sun sparkling on the glassy waves may be taken as read. On with the story. The tall man with the dark, shrewd, sympathetic face arrived at his inn alone, and on foot. There was nothing particularly odd about this; the village was small and notable mostly for its sea-fishing, and didn't contain enough square miles for the inn to be other than close to the train station. The man had been there in past summers, and remembered the desk clerk's name and to ask after his wife's lumbago; he was shown up to his room with great solicitude, and in return tipped with precision. Once the door closed, and he was alone, there was the important business of unpacking to be attended to. The bowler hat was hung symmetrically on the rack; the brown tweed jacket of his off-duty suit, immaculate and unwrinkled despite the journey, he draped over a hanger. He ran his fingers over a few surfaces as he put away shirts, undershirts, pants, trousers, and handkerchiefs, but it was only a reflexive gesture and he found next to no dust. The inn was one he'd selected himself: it was as well-scrubbed and friendly as its world. Task complete, he opened the window and allowed himself the luxury of standing and breathing in the sea air. It was nearly always sunny in this England, and this day was no exception; he lingered for several moments, admiring the trim flowerboxes that hung from the windows of the opposite house, before abstracting from his right breast pocket a small notebook. Arden Forest, read the first page to which he turned. Enter Act V. Consult w/ heroine Rosalind/\"Ganymede.\" Note: good candidate for D. e. M. training. The corners of his mouth turned up fractionally as he read, for he was fond of Shakespeare. Another entry, headed, Small pig-infested South Sea island did not meet with the same approbation. Enter end 12th chapter. Rescue murderous crew of schoolboys left too long to their own devices. Jeeves sighed, and, returning to the valise he'd just unpacked, withdrew from its emptiness a naval officer's uniform. While he was in the process of laying it out for the next morning, he thought he heard familiar laughter below. He went to the window, but saw only the edge of a paper sunshade painted with butterflies, disappearing around the corner out of view. # Four days later, the hallway door swung open. If anyone had been standing in the tidy little inn bedroom at the time, they would have had a glimpse not of the usual wooden panels and plaster and Victorian prints of dubious quality, but of another seaside quite different to the one properly located outside, crowded with war ships and cruisers. The grim harbor had no witnesses, however, as the room was empty, and the door promptly shut on its tropic breeze. The vast number of unaware persons in this world who believed it to be the one and only real world were left, for the moment, undisabused. The dark man did not stagger in, by any means; his step shifted deliberately from a firm to a noiseless tread as he entered the room, and his expression changed very little as he took off the peaked white-topped cap and threw it back into the waiting valise. But an observer - again, an entirely hypothetical one aside from the Author and the Reader, who in this case don't count - might have noticed that the still-spotless uniform was being shucked with a good deal of speed, and went into the valise folded with no very great care. Jeeves had had a long few days of it, between the weeping, epically unhygenic schoolboys and the sticky atmosphere of atomic age political allegory. He'd amused himself at some points speculating what his employer would have had to say about the whole situation, but aside from a wistful urge to push the head of the boy's choir overboard he could come up with very little. Despite their mutual and indubitable Britishness, the two worlds were too incompatible; he could not wish Mr Wooster here even in jest. Aside from anything else, it would have put his young master off bacon permanently. After a thorough bath and a long night's sleep, he rose and put on his own clothes again, and, checking first with the desk clerk and finding no calls or messages, he proceeded down to the seafront and relieved his feelings by whiling away the rest of the first week paddling around in a shrimp boat. # At some point during the long, dull stretch of afternoon that Sunday, all the peace and solitude began to register as irksome, not to say suspicious. There had been no letters bearing news of stolen silver and auntly wrath, or frantic telegrams begging the return of the prop of the household. While this was not unprecedented in the history of his holidays away from 3a Berkley Mansions, London, W.1, it was certainly unusual. Jeeves took an egg-and-cress sandwich and his copy of The Times down to one of the innumerable rows of deckchairs by the seawall, and there among innumerable old ladies and gentlemen taking the sun he flipped through its pages, searching for the fly in the ointment. The society engagements contained no impending nuptial disasters; he looked for, but found no mention of the arrest of one Ephraim Gadsby, of the Nasturtiums, Jubilee Road, Streatham Common. Baffled, he was scritching a bored and importunate shopcat under its chin while he paged through advertisements promising large sums of money lent, no security necessary, boasting the virtues of Mulliner's Snow of the Mountains Face Cream, or advising those in trouble to Leave It To Psmith! Crime not objected to!, when a collective wheezy sigh arose and swept through the elderly denizens of the deckchairs, like a gentle wind blowing through a large display of harmonicas. Jeeves looked up, and followed the admiring gazes to a young couple climbing onto a tandem bicycle. The boy, bright-haired and insouciant in white linen and dark glasses, was in front holding the machine steady, while the girl, in an extremely unpracticed manner, attempted to climb sidesaddle on the backseat, displaying flashes of shapely calves and ankles. Jeeves recognized her butterfly-spangled sunshade a moment before she turned and caught sight of him; she said something to the boy, and they both caught his eyes and waved, their turned faces inspiring another deep, rattling sigh of longing from the deckchairs. They were young, bubbling over with espieglerie and joie de vivre; they were both, frankly, indecently lovely. Jeeves narrowed his eyes slightly as he nodded back. None of the spectators seemed to have noticed this interaction, all still rapt and staring. The pair of them seemed too beautiful, too golden and desirable to belong to this world. This was, of course, because they did not. Jeeves was well aware that it was within the rights of a deus ex machina to visit any world he or she chose, whether on business or for pleasure, and that this included a world chosen by another of the guild as his particular home-spot. He wasn't, however, especially pleased by that fact, especially when the unannounced visitor was a literal deus. Those of the ancient gods who still remained in general circulation tended, on the whole, to be those most addicted to creative interference. The cat at the side of his deckchair, alone unimpressed, and annoyed at its sudden neglect, leapt onto Jeeves's newspapery lap and began eating the remains of his sandwich. By the time he'd extricated the animal from himself and his plate, and folded his newspaper again, the young couple had mounted the bicycle and begun trundling down the path, ringing the bell and swerving wildly and with a complete lack of necessity, as the pedestrians parted before them like waves at low tide. Jeeves reflected darkly for a moment on the utter stupidity of having the half of the couple who was driving be the one who was proverbially blind. # That night, Jeeves was ensconced at a table downstairs at the inn, addressing himself to Spinoza's Treatise on the Improvement of the Understanding and the consumption of a quiet Welsh rarebit and pint, when over the sociable din of the other drinkers he heard a high, clear whistle. Glancing up, he saw Cupid winding his way across the room. The process was somewhat impeded by a tendency on the young god's part to bump directly into every person and piece of furniture in between, as it evidently didn't occur to him that mortals and their props wouldn't automatically move out of his way, but he seemed wholly unbattered (unlike some of the people, or indeed some of the furniture) and unbowed, broadcasting his charming smile liberally around the room. Jeeves laid down his book and cleared his throat, and the god oriented on him and headed over. \"What ho, old jam-basket,\" he said, first patting the back of the chair opposite Jeeves to find it and then tossing himself into it, uninvited. \"Fancy running into you.\" Jeeves thought of pointing out that he was one of the few things in the room that Cupid had not in fact run into at this point, but confined himself to inquiring if Cupid and his lady wife were enjoying their little visit. \"Oh yes. Well, pretty well. It's a jolly little place, though a bit narrow to my way of thinking.\" \"Narrow, my lord?\" Jeeves noticed a barmaid lingering, breathlessly, behind the god's elbow and wished, vainly, for her to depart. \"Well, you know, there's not much scope for my gifts in a world where the heights of the divine pash. seem to be expressible at most with a bit of heated knee-fondling.\" \"Mfreep,\" said the barmaid, or words to that general import. Cupid's blank gaze went unerringly to her face, now flushed a fetching pink. He smiled. \"Muriel, isn't it?\" She nodded helplessly, eyes wide. \"Muriel,\" he repeated, in caressing tones, \"Would you do something for me?\" The girl strained with every atom of her being to express her entire willingness to do anything he asked, anything at all. Jeeves closed his eyes and took a deep, calming breath. \"Would you....bring me a bottle of champagne? Oh, and another one of,\" gesturing negligently and nearly knocking over Jeeves's pint glass, \"whatever my friend here is drinking. Thank you.\" Jeeves felt beholden to point out, \"Small inns on the British coast are not especially known for the quality of their champagne, my lord.\" Cupid looked mildly confused. \"But it'll be smashing, naturally. I mean, I ordered it.\" He noticed Muriel still standing staring at him, and said kindly in her direction, \"Run along and fetch those drinks now, there's a good girl.\" Muriel squeaked and ran for the bar. \"Now, where was I?\" \"Bemoaning the limited scope of my world.\" \"Oh, yes. But Psyche says she finds it peaceful and,\" a bright, roguish look, \"one does have to keep one's own chosen darling happy, doesn't one.\" \"I could not say, my lord.\" \"Couldn't you?\" asked Cupid, grin growing even more worryingly bright. Mercifully, Muriel and two more barmaids returned at this moment with their drinks, so Jeeves was spared trying to formulate a response; he was, however, obliged to watch as the three girls, giggling nervously, asked Cupid for his autograph. To Jeeves's profound irritation, he agreed, and cheerfully signed each of their hands with the name of a leading matinee idol. (None of the girls seemed to notice that each of the signed names belonged to a different matinee idol.) When they had gone at last, and the predictably excellent old bottle of champagne the barmaids had left was wrangled open with a minimum of efficiency and a maximum of foam, the god proposed a toast. One toast to Jeeves turned into another to both their beloveds. Jeeves politely did not protest his part in this dedication. And then Cupid decided, and would not be dissuaded from his decision, that the occasion called for a game of darts. Unfortunately, there was an unattended board, and Cupid produced from somewhere a set of handsome black and gold-tipped darts. \"I must say, though, my old toffee-engine, I don't understand it,\" he said, offering the black darts to Jeeves. They were sleekly fletched and perfectly weighted. \"Understand what, my lord?\" \"Why you like things to be so orderly,\" inflecting the word to mean desperately dull, \"and yet you so seldom interfere or break the bounds of the plausible. This champagne for example,\" he waved it expressively. \"I made it appear in the inn's backroom, but you know and I know you might have perfectly well changed it to vinegar. Or made lovely young whatshername, the barmaid, dump it over my head - I could see you were only longing to do it. It is your world, you can do what you like with it. So why didn't you?\" Jeeves inspected the points of his darts. \"I have always felt, my lord, that such methods lack subtlety.\" \"Hmph,\" said the god, and threw. If Jeeves had been concerned for the health of those in the immediate vicinity, he needn't have been; blind or not, Cupid threw with lethal accuracy. Being no slouch at darts himself, and basking in the comfortable feeling of having had the last word for the moment, Jeeves was just beginning to enjoy himself when the god threw his second treble twenty and then remarked, \"But what am I doing to do with you?\" Jeeves's throw went cockeyed, and his dart bounced off one of the wires and clattered to the ground. Clearing his throat, he went to retrieve it, asking mildly, \"I beg your pardon, my lord?\" \"And so you bally well ought to,\" said Cupid, smiling, his eyes unnaturally lit from within. \"For you don't appreciate me at all. Do you?\" He held out one hand, and the darts in the board came flying back out of the cork into his waiting grasp. \"You don't approve of me one whit, and I'd like to know what I've ever done to you. I could do quite a bit, you know.\" He paced slowly, soundlessly closer. \"If your employer hasn't ever taken more than the most disposable fancies to any of his young ladies, and they to him, it's only because I didn't care to disoblige you.\" The god's eyes were wide, sightless and fathomless as the sea. They did not belong in this room, this inn, this neat and charming little town; what was rising from their depths was dark and old. It had no place or purpose in this world except to break it and gloat lovingly over the pieces. \"If,\" the god said softly, \"if I threw this dart right now in the general direction of your left upper ribcage, you might find yourself acting less subtly, Jeeves. You would have time to close your eyes, perhaps, unless you really wanted to be inspired with an overruling passion for that little barmaid, or the chappie with the port and lemon over yonder.\" The golden dart twitched in Cupid's fingers. \"But you couldn't stand forever looking like a stuffed frog with its eyes glued closed. You'd have to wish yourself somewhere, and open your eyes on someone. Where would you go, I wonder? Where is home?\" Jeeves looked away, and coughed, like a sheep clearing its throat on a distant, misty hill five miles away. \"Your throw, I believe, my lord.\" Cupid blinked, shrugged impatiently, and threw: double bull, a perfect finish. The small crowd that had gathered to watch, which had been oblivious to the more metaphysical moments of the game, let out a cheer, and Cupid, pleased, bowed to each and every one of them, all in more or less the wrong directions. Jeeves handed the champagne bottle back to the god, remarking, \"I must say, my lord, that you seem to be making very reckless use of your divine accoutrements this evening.\" \"Oh, I'm always being chided for not looking after them properly,\" said Cupid, taking a negligent swig from the bottle and grinning around the room. \"Among other things I'm chided for. That's the only reason the guv'nor let me marry to disoblige m'mother, you know: he thought Psyche was such a nice steady girl.\" He wobbled slightly on his feet, and laughed, sounding surprised. \"And have you become steadier under her influence?\" inquired Jeeves, taking the black darts out of the board and collecting them together in a large cambric handkerchief he kept in his pocket. Cupid laughed again. \"Not noticeably.\" He took another drink, staggered as the bottle came down, and began feeling around behind him for a chair. \"I could have told him I wouldn't, but. But I had to marry my Psyche, she would keep getting into the most awful jams without me, and anyway she's my - my home...\" His knees buckled, and Jeeves caught him neatly under the arm as he fell, letting the darts drop from his loosening hand. Jeeves picked these up as well. \"Water from the river Lethe,\" he said, as he steered the god solicitously towards the door. \"I'm afraid I took the liberty of putting a few drops in the bottle while you threw. It seemed the best course of action.\" \"You had...in your waistcoast pocket....?\" Cupid said, dredging up incredulity from somewhere as his feet dragged along like lead. \"I happened to have a vial with me, yes. It is, admittedly, a rather implausible coincidence. But as you said yourself,\" Jeeves reminded the unconscious god, \"this is my world.\" Cupid was lighter than expected, so it was easy enough to carry him to a nearby park bench and dispose him, carefully, in a seated position. Jeeves was just taking a moment to write down a formula on the pad of paper he kept in his breast pocket when - in another remarkable stroke of good fortune - there came wandering by a slim figure carrying a lamp. \"Oh, dear,\" said Psyche. Jeeves explained that he regretted to say the god of love had imbibed not wisely but too well. He had just been in the process of writing down a little remedy of his own invention which gentlemen told him they found extremely invigorating after such nights. \"I'm sure they do. Oh,\" Psyche said, shaking her head as she came around to heft Cupid to his feet, \"for your sake, husband, what sort of mess have you gotten into now?\" Cupid leaned into her and nuzzled her neck, and she rolled her eyes. \"Thank you for looking after him, Jeeves. I don't suppose you know where he's left his...?\" Jeeves offered the darts in the handkerchief. \"Thank you,\" she said, gratefully. \"You really are a wonder.\" \"Not at all, my lady,\" said Jeeves. \"Will you require further assistance in conveying him home?\" \"Oh no, I'll be quite all right.\" she said, shifting her husband's arm over her shoulder. Cupid made a happy-sounding noise. His free hand came up, and began to wander regions from which Jeeves tactfully averted his eyes. She went on, in a fond and exasperated voice, \"I did tell him, you know, not to try to stir up trouble with you on your own ground. Considering the psychology of the individual.\" For a moment, her words echoed in Jeeves's ears with precisely his own intonations. Then she laughed, ruefully, and seemed again only an exceedingly lovely girl, brushing a kiss against the side of her husband's forehead. \"Silly ass.\" Jeeves bowed. Psyche smiled at him, and fumbled in the handkerchief before extracting one of the gold-tipped darts. \"Here,\" she said, holding it out, and when, Jeeves came no further, huffed an annoyed breath, reached out and fitted it in the buttonhole of his jacket like a flower. \"A gift, just in case you ever find you want it.\" She hefted Cupid up again, eliciting another pleased murmur and grope, and then turned and staggered off into the night. Jeeves watched the gods walking away, and then, as the calm night swallowed them, turned back to resume his dinner. # Arden Forest was shady and green, and young Ganymede - or Rosalind, as she was revealed to be - was just the sort of young lady Jeeves most admired in a distant and platonic way. \"Then is there mirth in heaven,\" he intoned, dressed in flowing golden robes he flattered himself suited him immensely, \"When earthly things made even atone together.\" # The train back to London had a comforting solidity, and as he came in the flat door a pleasant light baritone voice was raised in song. \"--give me your answer do. I'm half crazy, all for the love of -- what ho,\" said Mr Wooster, rising from the piano bench and beaming. \"That you, Jeeves?\" \"Indeed, sir,\" he said, placing his bag at his feet. \"Silly question, I suppose, unless you have occult powers of disguise of which I'm not aware,\" Mr. Wooster observed. \"Have a good holiday?\" \"Quite agreeable, though somewhat more full of incident than I would have preferred.\" \"You shall have to tell me all about it. Still,\" said Bertie hopefully, \"good to be home, what?\" \"Very good indeed, sir,\" said Jeeves. ###",

      "# Four days later, the hallway door swung open.",
      "If anyone had been standing in the tidy little inn bedroom at the time, they would have had a glimpse not of the usual wooden panels and plaster and Victorian prints of dubious quality, but of another seaside quite different to the one properly located outside, crowded with war ships and cruisers.",
      "The grim harbor had no witnesses, however, as the room was empty, and the door promptly shut on its tropic breeze.",
      "The vast number of unaware persons in this world who believed it to be the one and only real world were left, for the moment, undisabused.",
      "The dark man did not stagger in, by any means; his step shifted deliberately from a firm to a noiseless tread as he entered the room, and his expression changed very little as he took off the peaked white-topped cap and threw it back into the waiting valise.",
      "But an observer - again, an entirely hypothetical one aside from the Author and the Reader, who in this case don't count - might have noticed that the still-spotless uniform was being shucked with a good deal of speed, and went into the valise folded with no very great care.",
      "Jeeves had had a long few days of it, between the weeping, epically unhygenic schoolboys and the sticky atmosphere of atomic age political allegory.",
      "He'd amused himself at some points speculating what his employer would have had to say about the whole situation, but aside from a wistful urge to push the head of the boy's choir overboard he could come up with very little.",
      "Despite their mutual and indubitable Britishness, the two worlds were too incompatible; he could not wish Mr Wooster here even in jest.",
      "Aside from anything else, it would have put his young master off bacon permanently.",
      "After a thorough bath and a long night's sleep, he rose and put on his own clothes again, and, checking first with the desk clerk and finding no calls or messages, he proceeded down to the seafront and relieved his feelings by whiling away the rest of the first week paddling around in a shrimp boat.",
      "# At some point during the long, dull stretch of afternoon that Sunday, all the peace and solitude began to register as irksome, not to say suspicious.",
      "There had been no letters bearing news of stolen silver and auntly wrath, or frantic telegrams begging the return of the prop of the household.",
      "While this was not unprecedented in the history of his holidays away from 3a Berkley Mansions, London, W.1, it was certainly unusual.",
      "Jeeves took an egg-and-cress sandwich and his copy of The Times down to one of the innumerable rows of deckchairs by the seawall, and there among innumerable old ladies and gentlemen taking the sun he flipped through its pages, searching for the fly in the ointment.",
      "The society engagements contained no impending nuptial disasters; he looked for, but found no mention of the arrest of one Ephraim Gadsby, of the Nasturtiums, Jubilee Road, Streatham Common.",
      "Baffled, he was scritching a bored and importunate shopcat under its chin while he paged through advertisements promising large sums of money lent, no security necessary, boasting the virtues of Mulliner's Snow of the Mountains Face Cream, or advising those in trouble to Leave It To Psmith!",
      "Crime not objected to!, when a collective wheezy sigh arose and swept through the elderly denizens of the deckchairs, like a gentle wind blowing through a large display of harmonicas.",
      "Jeeves looked up, and followed the admiring gazes to a young couple climbing onto a tandem bicycle.",
      "The boy, bright-haired and insouciant in white linen and dark glasses, was in front holding the machine steady, while the girl, in an extremely unpracticed manner, attempted to climb sidesaddle on the backseat, displaying flashes of shapely calves and ankles.",
      "Jeeves recognized her butterfly-spangled sunshade a moment before she turned and caught sight of him; she said something to the boy, and they both caught his eyes and waved, their turned faces inspiring another deep, rattling sigh of longing from the deckchairs.",
      "They were young, bubbling over with espieglerie and joie de vivre; they were both, frankly, indecently lovely.",
      "Jeeves narrowed his eyes slightly as he nodded back.",
      "None of the spectators seemed to have noticed this interaction, all still rapt and staring.",
      "The pair of them seemed too beautiful, too golden and desirable to belong to this world.",
      "This was, of course, because they did not.",
      "Jeeves was well aware that it was within the rights of a deus ex machina to visit any world he or she chose, whether on business or for pleasure, and that this included a world chosen by another of the guild as his particular home-spot.",
      "He wasn't, however, especially pleased by that fact, especially when the unannounced visitor was a literal deus.",
      "Those of the ancient gods who still remained in general circulation tended, on the whole, to be those most addicted to creative interference.",
      "The cat at the side of his deckchair, alone unimpressed, and annoyed at its sudden neglect, leapt onto Jeeves's newspapery lap and began eating the remains of his sandwich.",
      "By the time he'd extricated the animal from himself and his plate, and folded his newspaper again, the young couple had mounted the bicycle and begun trundling down the path, ringing the bell and swerving wildly and with a complete lack of necessity, as the pedestrians parted before them like waves at low tide.",
      "Jeeves reflected darkly for a moment on the utter stupidity of having the half of the couple who was driving be the one who was proverbially blind.",
      "# That night, Jeeves was ensconced at a table downstairs at the inn, addressing himself to Spinoza's Treatise on the Improvement of the Understanding and the consumption of a quiet Welsh rarebit and pint, when over the sociable din of the other drinkers he heard a high, clear whistle.",
      "Glancing up, he saw Cupid winding his way across the room.",
      "The process was somewhat impeded by a tendency on the young god's part to bump directly into every person and piece of furniture in between, as it evidently didn't occur to him that mortals and their props wouldn't automatically move out of his way, but he seemed wholly unbattered (unlike some of the people, or indeed some of the furniture) and unbowed, broadcasting his charming smile liberally around the room.",
      "Jeeves laid down his book and cleared his throat, and the god oriented on him and headed over.",
      "\"What ho, old jam-basket,\" he said, first patting the back of the chair opposite Jeeves to find it and then tossing himself into it, uninvited.",
      "\"Fancy running into you.\"",
      "Jeeves thought of pointing out that he was one of the few things in the room that Cupid had not in fact run into at this point, but confined himself to inquiring if Cupid and his lady wife were enjoying their little visit.",
      "\"Oh yes.",
      "Well, pretty well.",
      "It's a jolly little place, though a bit narrow to my way of thinking.\"",
      "\"Narrow, my lord?\" Jeeves noticed a barmaid lingering, breathlessly, behind the god's elbow and wished, vainly, for her to depart.",
      "\"Well, you know, there's not much scope for my gifts in a world where the heights of the divine pash.",
      "seem to be expressible at most with a bit of heated knee-fondling.\"",
      "\"Mfreep,\" said the barmaid, or words to that general import.",
      "Cupid's blank gaze went unerringly to her face, now flushed a fetching pink.",
      "He smiled.",
      "\"Muriel, isn't it?\"",
      "She nodded helplessly, eyes wide.",
      "\"Muriel,\" he repeated, in caressing tones, \"Would you do something for me?\"",
      "The girl strained with every atom of her being to express her entire willingness to do anything he asked, anything at all.",
      "Jeeves closed his eyes and took a deep, calming breath.",
      "\"Would you....bring me a bottle of champagne?",
      "Oh, and another one of,\" gesturing negligently and nearly knocking over Jeeves's pint glass, \"whatever my friend here is drinking.",
      "Thank you.\"",
      "Jeeves felt beholden to point out, \"Small inns on the British coast are not especially known for the quality of their champagne, my lord.\"",
      "Cupid looked mildly confused.",
      "\"But it'll be smashing, naturally.",
      "I mean, I ordered it.\"",
      "He noticed Muriel still standing staring at him, and said kindly in her direction, \"Run along and fetch those drinks now, there's a good girl.\"",
      "Muriel squeaked and ran for the bar.",
      "\"Now, where was I?\"",
      "\"Bemoaning the limited scope of my world.\"",
      "\"Oh, yes.",
      "But Psyche says she finds it peaceful and,\" a bright, roguish look, \"one does have to keep one's own chosen darling happy, doesn't one.\"",
      "\"I could not say, my lord.\"",
      "\"Couldn't you?\" asked Cupid, grin growing even more worryingly bright.",
      "Mercifully, Muriel and two more barmaids returned at this moment with their drinks, so Jeeves was spared trying to formulate a response; he was, however, obliged to watch as the three girls, giggling nervously, asked Cupid for his autograph.",
      "To Jeeves's profound irritation, he agreed, and cheerfully signed each of their hands with the name of a leading matinee idol.",
      "(None of the girls seemed to notice that each of the signed names belonged to a different matinee idol.)",
      "When they had gone at last, and the predictably excellent old bottle of champagne the barmaids had left was wrangled open with a minimum of efficiency and a maximum of foam, the god proposed a toast.",
      "One toast to Jeeves turned into another to both their beloveds.",
      "Jeeves politely did not protest his part in this dedication.",
      "And then Cupid decided, and would not be dissuaded from his decision, that the occasion called for a game of darts.",
      "Unfortunately, there was an unattended board, and Cupid produced from somewhere a set of handsome black and gold-tipped darts.",
      "\"I must say, though, my old toffee-engine, I don't understand it,\" he said, offering the black darts to Jeeves.",
      "They were sleekly fletched and perfectly weighted.",
      "\"Understand what, my lord?\"",
      "\"Why you like things to be so orderly,\" inflecting the word to mean desperately dull, \"and yet you so seldom interfere or break the bounds of the plausible.",
      "This champagne for example,\" he waved it expressively.",
      "\"I made it appear in the inn's backroom, but you know and I know you might have perfectly well changed it to vinegar.",
      "Or made lovely young whatshername, the barmaid, dump it over my head - I could see you were only longing to do it.",
      "It is your world, you can do what you like with it.",
      "So why didn't you?\" Jeeves inspected the points of his darts.",
      "\"I have always felt, my lord, that such methods lack subtlety.\"",
      "\"Hmph,\" said the god, and threw.",
      "If Jeeves had been concerned for the health of those in the immediate vicinity, he needn't have been; blind or not, Cupid threw with lethal accuracy.",
      "Being no slouch at darts himself, and basking in the comfortable feeling of having had the last word for the moment, Jeeves was just beginning to enjoy himself when the god threw his second treble twenty and then remarked, \"But what am I doing to do with you?\" Jeeves's throw went cockeyed, and his dart bounced off one of the wires and clattered to the ground.",
      "Clearing his throat, he went to retrieve it, asking mildly, \"I beg your pardon, my lord?\"",
      "\"And so you bally well ought to,\" said Cupid, smiling, his eyes unnaturally lit from within.",
      "\"For you don't appreciate me at all.",
      "Do you?\"",
      "He held out one hand, and the darts in the board came flying back out of the cork into his waiting grasp.",
      "\"You don't approve of me one whit, and I'd like to know what I've ever done to you.",
      "I could do quite a bit, you know.\"",
      "He paced slowly, soundlessly closer.",
      "\"If your employer hasn't ever taken more than the most disposable fancies to any of his young ladies, and they to him, it's only because I didn't care to disoblige you.\"",
      "The god's eyes were wide, sightless and fathomless as the sea.",
      "They did not belong in this room, this inn, this neat and charming little town; what was rising from their depths was dark and old.",
      "It had no place or purpose in this world except to break it and gloat lovingly over the pieces.",
      "\"If,\" the god said softly, \"if I threw this dart right now in the general direction of your left upper ribcage, you might find yourself acting less subtly, Jeeves.",
      "You would have time to close your eyes, perhaps, unless you really wanted to be inspired with an overruling passion for that little barmaid, or the chappie with the port and lemon over yonder.\"",
      "The golden dart twitched in Cupid's fingers.",
      "\"But you couldn't stand forever looking like a stuffed frog with its eyes glued closed.",
      "You'd have to wish yourself somewhere, and open your eyes on someone.",
      "Where would you go, I wonder?",
      "Where is home?\" Jeeves looked away, and coughed, like a sheep clearing its throat on a distant, misty hill five miles away.",
      "\"Your throw, I believe, my lord.\"",
      "Cupid blinked, shrugged impatiently, and threw: double bull, a perfect finish.",
      "The small crowd that had gathered to watch, which had been oblivious to the more metaphysical moments of the game, let out a cheer, and Cupid, pleased, bowed to each and every one of them, all in more or less the wrong directions.",
      "Jeeves handed the champagne bottle back to the god, remarking, \"I must say, my lord, that you seem to be making very reckless use of your divine accoutrements this evening.\"",
      "\"Oh, I'm always being chided for not looking after them properly,\" said Cupid, taking a negligent swig from the bottle and grinning around the room.",
      "\"Among other things I'm chided for.",
      "That's the only reason the guv'nor let me marry to disoblige m'mother, you know: he thought Psyche was such a nice steady girl.\"",
      "He wobbled slightly on his feet, and laughed, sounding surprised.",
      "\"And have you become steadier under her influence?\" inquired Jeeves, taking the black darts out of the board and collecting them together in a large cambric handkerchief he kept in his pocket.",
      "Cupid laughed again.",
      "\"Not noticeably.\"",
      "He took another drink, staggered as the bottle came down, and began feeling around behind him for a chair.",
      "\"I could have told him I wouldn't, but.",
      "But I had to marry my Psyche, she would keep getting into the most awful jams without me, and anyway she's my - my home...\" His knees buckled, and Jeeves caught him neatly under the arm as he fell, letting the darts drop from his loosening hand.",
      "Jeeves picked these up as well.",
      "\"Water from the river Lethe,\" he said, as he steered the god solicitously towards the door.",
      "\"I'm afraid I took the liberty of putting a few drops in the bottle while you threw.",
      "It seemed the best course of action.\"",
      "\"You had...in your waistcoast pocket....?\" Cupid said, dredging up incredulity from somewhere as his feet dragged along like lead.",
      "\"I happened to have a vial with me, yes.",
      "It is, admittedly, a rather implausible coincidence.",
      "But as you said yourself,\" Jeeves reminded the unconscious god, \"this is my world.\"",
      "Cupid was lighter than expected, so it was easy enough to carry him to a nearby park bench and dispose him, carefully, in a seated position.",
      "Jeeves was just taking a moment to write down a formula on the pad of paper he kept in his breast pocket when - in another remarkable stroke of good fortune - there came wandering by a slim figure carrying a lamp.",
      "\"Oh, dear,\" said Psyche.",
      "Jeeves explained that he regretted to say the god of love had imbibed not wisely but too well.",
      "He had just been in the process of writing down a little remedy of his own invention which gentlemen told him they found extremely invigorating after such nights.",
      "\"I'm sure they do.",
      "Oh,\" Psyche said, shaking her head as she came around to heft Cupid to his feet, \"for your sake, husband, what sort of mess have you gotten into now?\" Cupid leaned into her and nuzzled her neck, and she rolled her eyes.",
      "\"Thank you for looking after him, Jeeves.",
      "I don't suppose you know where he's left his...?\" Jeeves offered the darts in the handkerchief.",
      "\"Thank you,\" she said, gratefully.",
      "\"You really are a wonder.\"",
      "\"Not at all, my lady,\" said Jeeves.",
      "\"Will you require further assistance in conveying him home?\"",
      "\"Oh no, I'll be quite all right.\"",
      "she said, shifting her husband's arm over her shoulder.",
      "Cupid made a happy-sounding noise.",
      "His free hand came up, and began to wander regions from which Jeeves tactfully averted his eyes.",
      "She went on, in a fond and exasperated voice, \"I did tell him, you know, not to try to stir up trouble with you on your own ground.",
      "Considering the psychology of the individual.\"",
      "For a moment, her words echoed in Jeeves's ears with precisely his own intonations.",
      "Then she laughed, ruefully, and seemed again only an exceedingly lovely girl, brushing a kiss against the side of her husband's forehead.",
      "\"Silly ass.\"",
      "Jeeves bowed.",
      "Psyche smiled at him, and fumbled in the handkerchief before extracting one of the gold-tipped darts.",
      "\"Here,\" she said, holding it out, and when, Jeeves came no further, huffed an annoyed breath, reached out and fitted it in the buttonhole of his jacket like a flower.",
      "\"A gift, just in case you ever find you want it.\"",
      "She hefted Cupid up again, eliciting another pleased murmur and grope, and then turned and staggered off into the night.",
      "Jeeves watched the gods walking away, and then, as the calm night swallowed them, turned back to resume his dinner.",
      "# Arden Forest was shady and green, and young Ganymede - or Rosalind, as she was revealed to be - was just the sort of young lady Jeeves most admired in a distant and platonic way.",
      "\"Then is there mirth in heaven,\" he intoned, dressed in flowing golden robes he flattered himself suited him immensely, \"When earthly things made even atone together.\"",
      "# The train back to London had a comforting solidity, and as he came in the flat door a pleasant light baritone voice was raised in song.",
      "\"--give me your answer do.",
      "I'm half crazy, all for the love of -- what ho,\" said Mr Wooster, rising from the piano bench and beaming.",
      "\"That you, Jeeves?\"",
      "\"Indeed, sir,\" he said, placing his bag at his feet.",
      "\"Silly question, I suppose, unless you have occult powers of disguise of which I'm not aware,\" Mr. Wooster observed.",
      "\"Have a good holiday?\"",
      "\"Quite agreeable, though somewhat more full of incident than I would have preferred.\"",
      "\"You shall have to tell me all about it.",
      "Still,\" said Bertie hopefully, \"good to be home, what?\" \"Very good indeed, sir,\" said Jeeves.",

    "text": "What can you say about a twenty-one year old girl who died? That she wasn't twenty-one, for starters. She was thirty-two when she died and looked every day of it. History has proved that to be a bad age for great and careless people (Gilles Villeneuve and Swami Vivekananda, for example. Karen Carpenter.) Astrologically, Pluto comes around to visit you when you're thirty-two, after the exuberant carelessness of Zeus and Hermes have showered you in their bright, unseeing light. When Pluto comes, the blindness recedes from your eyes as his cool, leaden shadow falls over you, and he will make you answer for every excess of your youth. Everyone knows that this was the revenge of the stars on Alexander the Great, who died of a mysterious fever at the age of thirty-two, but at this time the Aegeans were not yet a superstitious lot, because their lives were not yet governed by the cold and impersonal light of distant planets, just very powerful gods, against whose randomness no salt over your shoulder and no straw men could guard you. But he was twenty-one, still the darling of benevolent divinities. He remained so until the end. Perhaps they knew that they had already taken everything he could give. It is not often that human beings have a choice as stark as that which was offered to Achilles, son of Peleus, which is one way of looking at it. He had been at war for about five years by then - five years in Troy proper, that is, because the other way of looking at it was that Achilles had always been at this war, that he learned to walk and run and fight and be, because he was always, always, always meant to be this soldier on this plain, his glory as inevitable as death, as inevitable as the sky in his rainy-grey eyes. He walked into a bar. They all did that on their furloughs. He was still a general; the Myrmidons were going to raze this town to the ground later sometime, but he had time for a drink before it happened. There were townsfolks lingering on the shore, holding hands, singing, looking dreamily at the horizon. There was nothing to disturb the view, no ominous looming figures of black ships. This little Pleasantville would be a minor operation, mainly scheduled for keeping his soldiers' hand in as and when strategy ordered them off the plain. No one seemed to know who he was. He sat at the bar and asked for wine. Over in the corner an old woman was telling a gathering the story of Tantalus and how he cut up and served his own son Pelops as food for the gods. He watched the storyteller wave her hands, painting pictures of the horror, only half-listening. He knew this story of course; he had seen it enacted before his very eyes when they set out to sail. Agamemnon had murdered his own daughter to ensure good winds for the journey. Iphigeneia had been young, intelligent and gorgeous, very enthusiastic about being married to Achilles himself. That hadn't worked out. She had fought frantically before they killed her. The funny thing was, Pelops had been her great-grandfather, Agamemnon and Menelaus' grandfather. It had never occurred to her that the gods might resurrect her the way they did Pelops. It had never occurred to her at all that history was repeating itself. \"Nothing much's changed, has it?\" a voice sounded in his ear. He turned and there she was, dressed in combat fatigues and leather. She was tall, bronzed, with the sort of body that took years of fencing and running and good hard knocks to build up. She had long, olive-black hair and eyes darker than any child of Priam's. Achilles thought she was the most beautiful woman he had ever seen. \"Still bloodthirsty buggers, the lot of them.\" She sat down next to him and signalled for wine, too. \"It's the curse, isn't it. You can't end it. Their fathers and forefathers will all haunt them until they have their own mouthfuls.\" Achilles remembered the omen after her sacrifice. \"Like a snake,\" he said. \"Swallowing - \" \"Its own eggs. Exactly,\" she finished, picking up the cup before her and draining it in a gulp. \"Who's the redhead, then?\" He stared at her, wondering what had happened to him. \"Hi, I'm talking to you, Sparky,\" she waved five long, callused fingers before his face and laughed. \"Pyrrhus,\" he said, not taking his eyes off her face. \"I'm Pyrrhus. And you're lovely.\" \"Whatever gave you that idea?\" She looked pleased, tilting her head and looking him over appreciatively. \"Try Penny.\" \"Penny,\" he breathed. \"Penelope?\" \"Ugh, no,\" she laughed again. \"Penelope is a horrible name. So is Penny, but my only other option is Silly. Very silly. I discourage people from addressing me by name as a rule.\" Achilles made an effort to smile, even though his heart seemed in danger of beating its way right out of his mouth at any moment. \"Not even your lovers?\" \"Especially not my lovers,\" she said, raising an eyebrow. \"So what should I call you, then?\" It was out before he knew it, as inevitable, really, as everything else about him. Her eyebrow shot up a little higher, an eagle's wing upon her brow, and she said, \"'Your majesty' will do.\" -- Three years later They knew they were fighting each other even before the masks of war came off. It was in the movements, the curve of an arm as it swept around the other's body, the sweat-damp curls that escaped from a helmet, the surprise and the ferocity in the cries of passion. Things that no lover ever forgot about Achilles or Penthesilea. Time had drawn them close once more, almost as close as they had been that night in the town that was not so much as a memory even in the minds of its destroyers. He found an opening and wounded her arm slightly before she pulled back and swung hard at his head. She was strong. She could crush and wound you and make you utterly forget who you were. She did not give you time or space. She would mean everything to you, consume you and give nothing back. He could not crumble to dust for her, though. He might have; it might have been easy and possible, but there were reasons that he did not, too many reasons, all of which came down to the single fact that he was not meant for her. Three years ago they had been drinking wine together and talking about the sons of Atreus. She had told him that they were cursed, and he had agreed, and wondered how the curse could be broken. She had shrugged as if she did not care, and said, \"By someone brave enough to reverse destiny. To swallow the snake. To kill the father - or kill themselves.\" He looked her in the eye and advanced towards her. He remembered the wisdom in them. She beat him back, attacking him with new reserves of energy that welled up in her just as she seemedd about to give up. It would not be too difficult to be beaten by this woman. You could give yourself up with honour; she would destroy you so completely that nothing, not even shame, could be left. She could entwine and break the threads of fate, invert destiny and kill the killer. He thought, and thought that a curse was not a bargain with the gods. The House of Atreus could reverse their fortunes, but he could never break his. He did not hate her for being unable to change what always had been. He did not even hate for dying when she finally did, sword knocked out of her hand, his blade sliced clean through her heart. She had her destiny too, and he was it. She had not made a bargain, she had not been cursed. She was beautiful and brave and he had loved her for it, but he never thought that she might have deserved more. She was lying sprawled, still on the ground. Someone pulled her helmet off gently - she had fought well - and the hair, still long and black, fanned out on the earth around her. Her eyes were open, the wisdom gone, the fear gone. He knelt beside her to close them and noticed the eagle-wing brows, furled now, bleached by daylight battles. \"I hope you're clean, gorgeous,\" she had said on the stairs, leaning against the banister to look down at him. The eyebrows kept flying upwards, as though he were a perpetual incredulity. And he was. Someone murmured his name. A crowd had gathered around them. Her blood pooled about them, lapping at his knees. I'm not, he thought, kissing the forehead, smooth and fading without life. I carry my death with me, and now you have yours. What can you say about a twenty-one year old boy who died? Pluto never had the chance to summon him. He was actually twenty-eight when it happened, the arrow flying into his heel almost an accident, if anything the stars have orchestrated for eternities can be an accident. What can you say about Achilles dying? Perhaps this: that he did not deserve more. That no one, not even a woman, not even a queen of the Amazons, ever got less.",

      "He was still a general; the Myrmidons were going to raze this town to the ground later sometime, but he had time for a drink before it happened.",
      "There were townsfolks lingering on the shore, holding hands, singing, looking dreamily at the horizon.",
      "There was nothing to disturb the view, no ominous looming figures of black ships.",
      "This little Pleasantville would be a minor operation, mainly scheduled for keeping his soldiers' hand in as and when strategy ordered them off the plain.",
      "No one seemed to know who he was.",
      "He sat at the bar and asked for wine.",
      "Over in the corner an old woman was telling a gathering the story of Tantalus and how he cut up and served his own son Pelops as food for the gods.",
      "He watched the storyteller wave her hands, painting pictures of the horror, only half-listening.",
      "He knew this story of course; he had seen it enacted before his very eyes when they set out to sail.",
      "Agamemnon had murdered his own daughter to ensure good winds for the journey.",
      "Iphigeneia had been young, intelligent and gorgeous, very enthusiastic about being married to Achilles himself.",
      "That hadn't worked out.",
      "She had fought frantically before they killed her.",
      "The funny thing was, Pelops had been her great-grandfather, Agamemnon and Menelaus' grandfather.",
      "It had never occurred to her that the gods might resurrect her the way they did Pelops.",
      "It had never occurred to her at all that history was repeating itself.",
      "\"Nothing much's changed, has it?\" a voice sounded in his ear.",
      "He turned and there she was, dressed in combat fatigues and leather.",
      "She was tall, bronzed, with the sort of body that took years of fencing and running and good hard knocks to build up.",
      "She had long, olive-black hair and eyes darker than any child of Priam's.",
      "Achilles thought she was the most beautiful woman he had ever seen.",
      "\"Still bloodthirsty buggers, the lot of them.\"",
      "She sat down next to him and signalled for wine, too.",
      "\"It's the curse, isn't it.",
      "You can't end it.",
      "Their fathers and forefathers will all haunt them until they have their own mouthfuls.\"",
      "Achilles remembered the omen after her sacrifice.",
      "\"Like a snake,\" he said.",
      "\"Swallowing - \" \"Its own eggs.",
      "Exactly,\" she finished, picking up the cup before her and draining it in a gulp.",
      "\"Who's the redhead, then?\"",
      "He stared at her, wondering what had happened to him.",
      "\"Hi, I'm talking to you, Sparky,\" she waved five long, callused fingers before his face and laughed.",
      "\"Pyrrhus,\" he said, not taking his eyes off her face.",
      "\"I'm Pyrrhus.",
      "And you're lovely.\"",
      "\"Whatever gave you that idea?\"",
      "She looked pleased, tilting her head and looking him over appreciatively.",
      "\"Try Penny.\"",
      "\"Penny,\" he breathed.",
      "\"Penelope?\" \"Ugh, no,\" she laughed again.",
      "\"Penelope is a horrible name.",
      "So is Penny, but my only other option is Silly.",
      "Very silly.",
      "I discourage people from addressing me by name as a rule.\"",
      "Achilles made an effort to smile, even though his heart seemed in danger of beating its way right out of his mouth at any moment.",
      "\"Not even your lovers?\"",
      "\"Especially not my lovers,\" she said, raising an eyebrow.",
      "\"So what should I call you, then?\"",
      "It was out before he knew it, as inevitable, really, as everything else about him.",
      "Her eyebrow shot up a little higher, an eagle's wing upon her brow, and she said, \"'Your majesty' will do.\"",
      "-- Three years later They knew they were fighting each other even before the masks of war came off.",
      "It was in the movements, the curve of an arm as it swept around the other's body, the sweat-damp curls that escaped from a helmet, the surprise and the ferocity in the cries of passion.",
      "Things that no lover ever forgot about Achilles or Penthesilea.",
      "Time had drawn them close once more, almost as close as they had been that night in the town that was not so much as a memory even in the minds of its destroyers.",
      "He found an opening and wounded her arm slightly before she pulled back and swung hard at his head.",
      "She was strong.",
      "She could crush and wound you and make you utterly forget who you were.",
      "She did not give you time or space.",
      "She would mean everything to you, consume you and give nothing back.",
      "He could not crumble to dust for her, though.",
      "He might have; it might have been easy and possible, but there were reasons that he did not, too many reasons, all of which came down to the single fact that he was not meant for her.",
      "Three years ago they had been drinking wine together and talking about the sons of Atreus.",
      "She had told him that they were cursed, and he had agreed, and wondered how the curse could be broken.",
      "She had shrugged as if she did not care, and said, \"By someone brave enough to reverse destiny.",
      "To swallow the snake.",
      "To kill the father - or kill themselves.\"",
      "He looked her in the eye and advanced towards her.",
      "He remembered the wisdom in them.",
      "She beat him back, attacking him with new reserves of energy that welled up in her just as she seemedd about to give up.",
      "It would not be too difficult to be beaten by this woman.",
      "You could give yourself up with honour; she would destroy you so completely that nothing, not even shame, could be left.",
      "She could entwine and break the threads of fate, invert destiny and kill the killer.",
      "He thought, and thought that a curse was not a bargain with the gods.",
      "The House of Atreus could reverse their fortunes, but he could never break his.",
      "He did not hate her for being unable to change what always had been.",
      "He did not even hate for dying when she finally did, sword knocked out of her hand, his blade sliced clean through her heart.",
      "She had her destiny too, and he was it.",
      "She had not made a bargain, she had not been cursed.",
      "She was beautiful and brave and he had loved her for it, but he never thought that she might have deserved more.",
      "She was lying sprawled, still on the ground.",
      "Someone pulled her helmet off gently - she had fought well - and the hair, still long and black, fanned out on the earth around her.",
      "Her eyes were open, the wisdom gone, the fear gone.",
      "He knelt beside her to close them and noticed the eagle-wing brows, furled now, bleached by daylight battles.",
      "\"I hope you're clean, gorgeous,\" she had said on the stairs, leaning against the banister to look down at him.",
      "The eyebrows kept flying upwards, as though he were a perpetual incredulity.",
      "And he was.",
      "Someone murmured his name.",
      "A crowd had gathered around them.",
      "Her blood pooled about them, lapping at his knees.",
      "I'm not, he thought, kissing the forehead, smooth and fading without life.",
      "I carry my death with me, and now you have yours.",
      "What can you say about a twenty-one year old boy who died?",
      "Pluto never had the chance to summon him.",
      "He was actually twenty-eight when it happened, the arrow flying into his heel almost an accident, if anything the stars have orchestrated for eternities can be an accident.",
      "What can you say about Achilles dying?",
      "Perhaps this: that he did not deserve more.",
      "That no one, not even a woman, not even a queen of the Amazons, ever got less."

    "text": "Everyone has a terrible secret and this was Achilles'. He liked being a woman. So it was in a manner of speaking. Achilles was at the age when nothing and no one was good enough, and what could have been good enough was absent, distant, or unheard-of, and was, consequently, nothing and no one. Achilles was also at the age when proximity was everything. Take his sexual appetites. Proximity worked wonders for them. He liked his sexual appetites too. They were fantastic entertainment. When you are a serving wench of Scyros - the only kingdom in the Aegean smaller and pokier than Phthia, thanks, Mother - life's little pleasures are limited. Achilles counted himself lucky that the one pleasure accessible to him could not, by any stretch of reason, be called little. Did this have everything or nothing to do with his liking for being a woman? One or the other cannot be decided upon for certain. Even Achilles was constructed of webs of subtle complexities (although most people would only remember this after his tragi-comic, heroi-villainous death). He liked the sense of self he achieved in the women's quarters; liked that beneath the skirts, the trinkets and the make-up, there was something immutable; a heartbeat, a soul whose outlines only seemed more vital, more solid, even, as he immersed himself deeper and deeper in this ridiculous charade, a desire that broadened and deepened every day in denial. To Achilles, that desire was him. The more he suppressed it, the more it grew, and the more he was Achilles. And there was his body. It wasn't just his manhood, that possession which was, in the head cook's general terms, his sausage (a food that always elicited titters from the other girls). Every other day, all of him was growing taller and wider under the dresses the seamstresses (who were in on the secret from the start) kept letting out tirelessly. It was as though keeping his feelings bottled up were making his blouses burst at the seams and his ankles gangle scandalously beneath his hems. He was an adolescent, and beginning to look it now, albeit a bit suspiciously. After all, a girl growing as tall as he was ought to have developed a bit more in the mysterious area between the throat and stomach, where other girls were showing the beginnings of secret, beautiful things, all dips and curves and softnesses that made life, delicately speaking, hard for him. He wanted those, wanted to uncover and look at and touch them. Wanted to - this was where the complex part came in - own them. But Achilles, as we have said before, was at the age when nothing was good enough. That was why he was in disguise in Scyros, after all. Never mind his clever, slightly dotty mother's reasons, rooted in politics and destiny. He was here to wait out his years of not-good-enough, not-strong-enough, of not-fast-enough, of plain just-not-enough. And what better place for a boy to go, to wait and watch and not be good enough, but among women? If he was lanky, flame-haired and as flat as the plain of Athens, it was alright, wasn't it? It was certainly not as bad as meeting destiny at fourteen, not knowing whether you were capable of outrunning it. Besides, he had plenty of good points to balance it out. The keen eye and nimble fingers that would one day be the toast of Agammemnon's armies stood him in good stead as he learnt and enjoyed crochet and handwork. He could thread three needles faster than most girls could do one. He could weave and spin well into lunchtime, when the other kids were panting and faint with hunger. No less than Chiron had drilled endurance into him, after all, and even the royal housekeeper of Scyros, formidable as she was, was little match for the wisest and best centaur of all. And no one envied or hated him for it. He was perfectly crap at cooking - no sense of smell worth speaking of - and that cheered them up a good deal. Besides, he was very jolly to sit next to when they were allowed to watch the boys fighting in the sandpit, for he was bound to get flustered, and then he would hop up and down, clutch his hair and try to give them orders. All in all, he was sweet and charming and knew the best ever dirty jokes; and if he was so beautiful that a lift of his lashes sometimes made a girl catch her breath, well, what did it matter? He had no breasts and had to fill his uniform with wads of cotton, everyone knew. They had all caught him at it, for try as he might, he never could wake up earlier than the rest of them. One day, he was lumbering around the princess' quarters, picking up her dirty clothes for laundry. He had a boner the size of Mycenae from touching and holding all the exquisite bits of soft, lacy lingerie Deidameia left lying around, but the girls passing by thought his difficulty was thanks to the extra-thick wad of cloth they were all allowed on their heavy-flow days - no fancy sanitary stuff for mere maids of all work, if you please - and he got a lot of sympathetic looks out of it. Often he had fantasized about catching one of the other girls and revealing his identity. What he wanted would surely follow, as it was only his right as a prince and a man. It took all his reserves of moral courage and sense of duty to stop him from doing so, especially in the tortuous, heavenly nights, when they all lay packed together on the mats that stretched from end to end of the servants' quarters. He acquired quite a reputation for being the only maid who was never afraid to get up and go to the bathroom alone in the dead of night. \"Oh Kiki, are you quite done?\" Deidameia waved and smiled as she entered her bedroom, attended by her air of supreme confidence, exotic perfume and the floating array of silk scarves she always wore on outdoor excursions to protect her flawless complexion from the Hellenic sun. Jealous women were wont to attribute the princess' beauty to fine feathers. \"Silks and diamonds,\" the scullery maid was apt to sniff. \"If Kiki here had 'em she'd look fine as any princess of the realm, believe you me.\" But Achilles, who was always called Kiki inspite of the fact that his given name on the stipend roll was Pyrrha, was never quite inclined to believe it. It was true that Deidameia was always dressed within an inch of her life, even when she went to bed - her nightgowns had rubies sewn into their bodices. But they were all accoutrements; accessories to her pale, pure skin, her mass of soft, springy, rosemary-scented hair, the wit and humour sparkling in her dark eyes. His voice shook a little as he turned and answered, bowing low. \"Quite finished, beauty of beauties,\" he said, picking up the basket, not daring to incline his gaze any further upwards than the hem of her cream satin gown. \"Darling,\" she said, flinging the scarves and string after string of pearls at him, \"do me a favour and leave out something for me to wear this evening. I'm so tired I can't keep my eyes open. Have to be at dinner with Father tonight.\" \"But -\" he began helplessly, and realised it was futile. He was standing at the foot of her bed holding bundles of her clothes, and she, her shoes kicked off, had already wriggled out of her suit and into sleep. He put down the basket, wrapped the pearls around his wrists, and crept to her closet. Oh, he knew it would have been sensible to go and call Ara or Pepper and ask them to do the lady's bidding. How well he knew it, Achilles with his dark, plain gowns and fake menstrual cycle! But yearning overcame, aye, and desire won; a little choking wave rose in his throat and would not be calmed until he thrust his hand in the midst of this dark, fabulous space, scented faintly with jasmine and orange blossom, where silks and chiffons whispered to velvets and crepes and cotton, oh, such cotton as made Achilles groan and rub himself a little against the cool wood - cotton from the fields of mystic, feminine Egypt across the Mediterranean. Should the princess wear the rose satin, with pink pearls lining the collar? The purple velvet, perhaps, with a rope of aquamarine jewels in her glossy braid. Achilles had a vision of Deidameia walking towards him in that shocking, becoming purple, peeling it off her body as she came - and his hands reaching up to undo the jewels from her braid, letting it slide through the unravelling hair, trailing delicately down her naked spine - and he would place his mouth on the small of her back and trace the path back upward - and her hair would form a gorgeous curtain about them - He bit his lip. No, no. Best think of her in the full-sleeved white gown. Even if the sleeves were all fine, handcrafted lace, and you could catch the shadow of a glimpse of her breast when she raised her hands to adjust the little veil over her eyes. Such a jaunty little veil, almost a netted cap, but it was the suggestion of mystery that did it, the possibility of womanly enigma, and oh, Achilles was going to lose it if he didn't breathe now and think of - of sword practice, and Chiron's punishments, and taking a cold, cold dip in the sea. Very cold. With Patroklos. He bit his lip so hard it bled. Later in the day, the girls noticed Kiki wearing a fresh gown, but didn't ask him about it. The most graceful of them tended to stain on first days. He shouldn't have done it. But he was Achilles. It was neither in his nature nor his destiny to have headed straight back to his sleeping mat after his ritual midnight excursion to the loo. In fact, he hadn't even reached the loo when fate led his feet away from the washrooms, towards and into to Deidameia's dark, silent quarters. He padded across the threshold, thankful for the dark to hide his burning, flushed face. The room was closed, heavy with her scent, the jasmine hanging in the air like incense in a temple sanctum. His head spun with the nearness of it, and her. Weakly he breathed and leaned on the arm of a chair to catch his balance. And touched a piece of silken, slightly damp underwear. His eyes, closed of their own volition, opened in a flash. But he had not - and she had not - \"Wear it, won't you, Kiki.\" He spun around in the direction of the big four-poster even before she had said his name, shame mingling with arousal and a tinge of what was not fear, what could never be fear because fear did not exist in Achilles, but it was something that made his heart pound and his senses diamond-sharp. Of course she was there, a figure darker than darkness, the intense, overpowering heart of the night. He cleared his throat. \"Lady.\" \"Wear it.\" It was impossible to disobey her, because she was his mistress; because she was wise and powerful and two years older, besides, and she was as beautiful as the stars. And he did want to obey her, somewhat. Slowly, he raised his bare feet, one after the other, and pulled the thing - such a thing - over, sliding it up his legs. It felt like they'd grown longer and oh, the silk felt good against his skin. Good after days of coarse wool and linens and being a bloody boy and wasn't it a little tight? Just a little. Just right. There was a spark and a flare; she lit the candles swimming in the lotus jar. She had worn the purple, after all, with a gold girdle and a gold comb loose in her hair. Little curls had escaped, hanging about her face. She looked very dishevelled, very flushed, and very beautiful. \"Kiki dear,\" she said, looking into his eyes. \"You are such a bad girl.\" \"What have I done?\" he asked, alarmed. She raised an eyebrow. \"Oh,\" he said, understanding. Bad, girl. \"And yet, you are one. You have to be.\" She shifted and leaned back against her cushions. \"I saw you, you know, when you were laying out my clothes.\" He bit his cheek and almost looked away. \"I have pretty things, don't I?\" She smiled a little. \"Very pretty. You, for one. Extremely pretty.\" \"Thank you, ma'am,\" he said demurely. \"I try my best.\" \"Ah, but Kiki-kins,\" she replied, equally demure, \"your best, I'm afraid, must needs be better.\" His Adam's apple bobbed nervously. \"I hate sharing some things,\" the princess continued. \"Books, for one. Clothes, sometimes.\" \"I do understand,\" he told her. \"Secrets, on the other hand.\" She raised a hand to her hair and took out the comb. \"I like secrets.\" He watched intently the way her hair coiled downwards and unwound, spilled across the cushions, ate up the candlelight. \"Want to share?\" she asked softly. He nodded slowly, struck dumb. \"Wonderful,\" she smiled. \"Now drop that skirt.\" He did drop it. It felt almost as wonderful as the silk panties. She pulled him onto the bed and pushed him back against the cool sheets. 'My, my, Miss Kiki,\" she whispered, laughing, \"what character your chest has.\" Kiki flushed as she bent her head to kiss his character-filled chest and stroke the little rosy points on them - oh gods, and he had thought them useless, oh gods - and whimpered. \"I'm going to take you,\" she said in a low, rough voice. He gasped and shuddered and squeaked, \"It's not - time of month -\" But she growled and sucked his chin and all he could think of was her, and - \"How do you do that?\" he wailed. And Deidameia showed him how to do it and to be it, as she strung her gold about his neck and wrapped him in her silk scarf. He could feel her curves just by looking at them, when she stripped her dress off her body. He shut his eyes as she teased him with it until he could not tell which was velvet and which her skin, and he almost wept for the beauty of it all. She took his hands in hers and moulded his body beneath them, making him shiver and groan and cry out as she touched him in places he had never known could feel so good, and he scored her back with his nails as she moved above him, engulfing and trapping him, clutching the sheets and saying the most delightful things about belowstairs and underneath and his bottom and she - didn't - just - she did, and they did, and words slipped away from Achilles' power. \"Mia,\" he sobbed as he crumpled into himself. \"Mia darling.\" \"Oh, Kiki,\" she murmured, holding him close, gentling him. \"My Kiki baby.\" This is the true story of how Achilles lost his virginity, although in later years he and, it must be confessed, the noble Patroklos, never did admit to it. It wasn't real, after all, unless there was a man involved. Deidameia and Kiki continued their lessons on how to be properly feminine well into the next few months, until an unfortunate mistake that Mia - he always called her Mia in private - refused to take the blame for, was committed. It is true that little Neoptolemos was born in strict legitimacy, but nearly as true, too, that the spirit of the circumstances was dubious in more than one way. His father was apt to keep his distance from him in the years to come, but it must be mentioned that Neo greatly enjoyed the occasional visit from his Aunt Pyrrha, so long as she and his mother did not get into a nagging quarrel, which, alas, they did more often than not.",

      "She raised a hand to her hair and took out the comb.",
      "\"I like secrets.\"",
      "He watched intently the way her hair coiled downwards and unwound, spilled across the cushions, ate up the candlelight.",
      "\"Want to share?\" she asked softly.",
      "He nodded slowly, struck dumb.",
      "\"Wonderful,\" she smiled.",
      "\"Now drop that skirt.\"",
      "He did drop it.",
      "It felt almost as wonderful as the silk panties.",
      "She pulled him onto the bed and pushed him back against the cool sheets. 'My, my, Miss Kiki,\" she whispered, laughing, \"what character your chest has.\"",
      "Kiki flushed as she bent her head to kiss his character-filled chest and stroke the little rosy points on them - oh gods, and he had thought them useless, oh gods - and whimpered.",
      "\"I'm going to take you,\" she said in a low, rough voice.",
      "He gasped and shuddered and squeaked, \"It's not - time of month -\" But she growled and sucked his chin and all he could think of was her, and - \"How do you do that?\" he wailed.",
      "And Deidameia showed him how to do it and to be it, as she strung her gold about his neck and wrapped him in her silk scarf.",
      "He could feel her curves just by looking at them, when she stripped her dress off her body.",
      "He shut his eyes as she teased him with it until he could not tell which was velvet and which her skin, and he almost wept for the beauty of it all.",
      "She took his hands in hers and moulded his body beneath them, making him shiver and groan and cry out as she touched him in places he had never known could feel so good, and he scored her back with his nails as she moved above him, engulfing and trapping him, clutching the sheets and saying the most delightful things about belowstairs and underneath and his bottom and she - didn't - just - she did, and they did, and words slipped away from Achilles' power.",
      "\"Mia,\" he sobbed as he crumpled into himself.",
      "\"Mia darling.\"",
      "\"Oh, Kiki,\" she murmured, holding him close, gentling him.",
      "\"My Kiki baby.\"",
      "This is the true story of how Achilles lost his virginity, although in later years he and, it must be confessed, the noble Patroklos, never did admit to it.",
      "It wasn't real, after all, unless there was a man involved.",
      "Deidameia and Kiki continued their lessons on how to be properly feminine well into the next few months, until an unfortunate mistake that Mia - he always called her Mia in private - refused to take the blame for, was committed.",
      "It is true that little Neoptolemos was born in strict legitimacy, but nearly as true, too, that the spirit of the circumstances was dubious in more than one way.",
      "His father was apt to keep his distance from him in the years to come, but it must be mentioned that Neo greatly enjoyed the occasional visit from his Aunt Pyrrha, so long as she and his mother did not get into a nagging quarrel, which, alas, they did more often than not."

At the onset of his dominion over the realm of the Underworld it was a simple place, little more than shadow and mist divided by the five great rivers. For eons he quietly presided over the kingdom of shades and little changed. During her original confinement Persephone found the land to be the morbid reverse of the world she had known before. As the daughter of the goddess of growth she could not fathom that a place could exist where things did not grow. Those long months she walked each cavern and plain and along each of those dread rivers in search of life in any form. The lone pomegranate given to her by Pluton was the only such thing Persephone the prisoner experienced of life. Upon her first return to Hades as consort and queen of the land something strange occurred. From her gown fell seeds from the world above and soon quite soon afterward growth occurred in the underworld. Meadows of asphodel flowers exploded into being where before were only barren plains. Persephone's heart gladdened and lightened at the sight, she was no longer a prisoner in a strange land for now she was its mistress. Pluton did not question the change wrought in his land. It was fair and fitting that Demeter's daughter would transform the world around her. They ruled together as lord and lady of Hades from that time forward. Every mortal has met them when the Fates at long last cut one's thread of life, from the poorest of beggars to the greatest of kings. Those souls nearly every one of them who has entered the Lord and Lady's receiving hall has remained in the Underworld. After many years of reign the world-under-the-world altered once more. Behind their receiving hall did a road begin and branched down three paths. One path went down, down into the dark recesses of Tartarus where Tantalus and Typhon among others were imprisoned. The second path wandered into the heart of the fields of asphodel while the third path led to a land unseen in the house of Hades before. That land was forever enshrined in springtime and twilit by soft stars that were ne'er to be seen in the world above. The lord was amazed and thought there was no more fitting a place to represent the majesty of his wife and consort. Poets have called this place Elysium or the Elysian Fields though it is thought that lady herself or even her lord husband named it. It is also said that when Elysium appeared Pluton asked Persephone what ought be done. She replied, \"The good may go there.\"",

    "text": "She had grown up in the light, in the warmth and care of the sun and flowers, but she was truly beginning to love the dark. She missed the feel of wet grass tickling her feet as she walked, face upraised, in the morning to find wreathes and garlands for herself. In its place, she had replaced that affection with the feeling of the breeze the souls made as they populated their little heavens and the rich inviting smell of the Styx as she strolled through the Elysian Fields. She was the Queen of the Dead and it was beneath her to mourn her past. Mourning was for the living. Here, the dead came to rest. But she still, in her stomach, felt of the seeds she had tasted roiling and settling. It made her long for the spring to come, for her mother to come and sweep her away from this life of cold, calm judgment, this life of wilting. She longed for blooming again, renewal, only her mother could bring. \"My love?\" She hadn't even heard her husband approach, silently as always, until she turned and her eyes were drawn to his hands. They were both stretched out to her in offering. In his left hand, he held a blooming white lotus flower, its petals folding over and around the curves of his fingers and palm. If it still lived here, in the realm of death, he had blessed it with his breath and forever preserving the bloom. In his right hand, he held the same sweet fruit that had condemned her to this life and this husband who coveted her light and life so much he hid her from the very things that made her flush with both. \"You are troubled.\" \"It was cruel,\" she told him, pushing the pomegranate away. She only touched his wrist, the barest amount of friction with her fingertips she could stand, before pulling back. The lotus flower she took, letting her fingers stroke the petals. \"Death is rarely cruel, my love,\" he said, reaching over and running his fingers through her long hair. She flinched away from the pale cool fingers. \"It is rarely cruel because it is life's only certainty.\" \"You punished that boy for making you feel.\" She turned away from him completely, cradling the precious blossom in her hands. His hands rested on her waist, thumbs rubbing in circles along the light fabric of her wrap. \"No. Orpheus could have saved his wife if he had been resolute. It was no phantom following him.\" He gave a quiet sigh against her hair. \"Defying death should never be easy, my love. It upsets the order of things. Orpheus failed to remember that. He failed to trust the words of a god. For that -- his own choices -- he is being punished.\" \"No, my love,\" she disputed. For him, it was a term of endearment. For her, it was a term of loathing. A term of disrespect. He never seemed to care so long as the words were being said. \"He is being punished for making you feel. It clouds your precious judgment.\" His fingers pulled her hair away from her neck. His lips pressed against where her pulse should be. \"He is not you, my love.\"",

    "text": "Now, when dawn had turned to dusk, Ariadne left the rocks of storm-tossed Naxos and came inland, with her comely feet bare and light on the dusty road. The sky was dark and she was much unhappy, but she prayed to Poseidon, who she had so lately betrayed, and eventually she came to a small cottage by the roadside. The windows were lit and Ariadne sank to her knees and gave her thanks to the god. When she knocked, the door was answered quickly. \"Ill-starred Ariadne,\" said the poor woman, \"you are welcome in my house.\" The Princess of Crete fell and hugged the poor woman's knees and so the poor woman took her by the hands and led her to the table, which even at this late hour still had hot food and plate laid for a guest. Ariadne was seated there and fed with the best of the poor woman's meat and bread. After the meal, they went together to the shrine to pray to Poseidon, giving thanks for the food. They drank a cup of wine together, too, and then there came a knock at the door. \"My son is here,\" said the poor woman and indeed her son entered, young and strong and handsome. Dark-eyed Ariadne kissed his hands and he kissed hers, welcoming her as a guest in his house. He gave her his bed that night and slept in the stable, while abandoned Ariadne lay awake thinking of her fate, until sweet-natured Sleep took pity on her and closed her eyes. But even then she found no relief, for she dreamt of her ignominious future, the traitor princess, the stupid slut. Cow-brained Ariadne, open-legged Ariadne, the cuckold's daughter cuckolded. When she wakened, there were tears on her pillow. The poor mother and her son insisted she stay with them and so Ariadne spent her days spinning or preserving food. The son was always gentle with his mother, who screwed up her eyes against the sun, and he smiled often upon Ariadne. One night, Ariadne lay in the son's bed and listened to the sound of music in the hills, the soft piping of the flute, the hum of a lyre's strings. She left the bed, she left the house and she fled into the hills, towards the music which sang wild in her blood. She ran for miles, desperate, until she finally came unto the god's presence. \"Dance, Ariadne,\" said bright Dionysus, laughing with his maenads. She took his outstretched and danced on her comely feet until they were bruised and bleeding. He caught her to him as she stumbled and swung her so that she never touched the ground, flying, dancing with the maenads in the air. Dark-eyed Ariadne woke in her own bed, and thought it was a dream. The son smiled when he saw her at breakfast and she did not speak of the wonders the god had brought her to. At a village party, the son brought her a cup of wine. Ariadne took it and prayed silently to Dionysus that he might bless this revel and the people who had been so kind to her. She danced with the son again and again, and clenched her hands round his, wishing the night would not end. Even twice-born Dionysus could not stave off the dawn, but then nor did he want to. At dawn the son caught Ariadne's hands again and pulled her away from the dance. \"What is it?\" she asked, but the son only smiled and they ran together, away from the others, into the lonely hillside. Once more Ariadne heard the singing pipe, but now she only held the son close and kissed him harder. \"Purest Ariadne,\" he whispered into her mouth and she dug her fingers into the strong arms of Dionysus the liberator and felt her soul to be cleansed. When he made love to her, it was slow and long; he traced patterns in wine across her belly and licked it away, he kissed her breasts, her cunt, and when he finally entered her she welcomed him gladly. \"I'll make you Star-crowned Ariadne,\" he promised afterwards, to make up for all the sadness of her life, and she kissed him again. Drink with me ancient winesAnd learn with me new stars,Then spit sweet on my tongueFor time is ever ours.And we'll learn it once more,We'll sail my wine-dark shore.Forget your yesterday,For tomorrow is here.",

    "text": "\"...the happiness of those for whom the day is blessed but doubly blessed the night.\" - Euripides' Bacchae This story is told in many ways. In the first, Zeus the Thunderer, lord of Olympus, takes the girl, his own daughter, the Underworld's queen, in the fruit-heavy fields of summer. Persephone's hair is pale, burnished by months of sunlight. She does not consent, but neither does she resist - she is another man's wife, but not above the earth. And Zeus, she knows, will have all the goddesses whose virginity is not sacred. Hers meant nothing once her name changed from Kore, once she felt the sweet-sour pomegranate seed burst between her teeth. And so she bears Zeus' child in herself as the nights lengthen and she travels down to her husband's realm. There, among the dead, her flesh caressed by that dark world's lord, Persephone's child changes. He becomes a strange thing, flesh infused by mystery, by that madness which is the true knowledge of life and death. That madness lies quiet in Persephone, who travels between the realms, daughter of one world and queen of another, but in her son, conceived in sunlight, nurtured in dark and born in the uncertain brightness of another spring, it explodes. The child's name is Dionysus. She leaves the boy and his strange eyes with her mother when autumn comes again. Demeter, all abundant, cares for him as her hair grows white with winter. She whispers into his infant ears the secrets of her Mysteries. But Hera (Demeter's sister, Persephone's aunt, Zeus' wife and queen) sees the boy and knows that her husband has betrayed her yet again. She looks at the boy and thinks not of Persephone's motherhood, but of Zeus' smug fatherhood. And she sends strong-handed Titans to tear the boy to pieces, limb rent from limb, organs spilling onto the hard, cold ground. Zeus rescues one pieces only from the wreckage - a heart, still beating, blood red as pomegranates and as wine. He takes that heart, warm in his hands, and gives it to a lovesick Theban princess, Semele, with hair of dark curls chiseled like volcanic stone. It slips down her throat and, in an unspoken mystery of rebirth, sparks new life in the safety of her womb. The tale is told to Persephone by torch-bearing Hecate, and Persephone, silent upon her dark throne, weeps, for her son is hers no longer. - Another story is told. The story is that Persephone, with the cold seed of Hades inside her, can conceive a child no longer. She lies in bed and touches her hipbones, jagged with long months eating only pomegranates, and she thinks of her mother's warmth, her softness, the way her arms can curve. She knows that to her, all that is denied, and she buries her head in her husband's shoulder, lonely. Above the earth, a half-sibling is conceived for her, son of her father, Zeus, and a mortal girl, one of his numberless conquests. By Hera's jealousy the girl is destroyed, consumed by the fire of her lover, but the child is saved, an infant, vulnerable with the months he lost within his mother's womb, his eyes lit with the fire by which his mother died. He must be hidden, protected from Hera's sight. Strong-calved Hermes carries him down beneath the earth, to his childless half-sister. And Persephone raises the boy, who plays games by the banks of Lethe, and learns the screams of Tartarus only as another beauty of the world. When Persephone returns to her mother's house and again plays Kore, Rhea, Zeus' mother and the child's grandmother, cares for him, for her own children grew to adulthood in the caves of Crete or in their father's stomach, far from her eyes. These women love the boy, whose name is Dionysus, and with them he learns the fluidity of the world, that a family can mean anything, that death is beautiful, that the darkness is made of all the brightest colors of the world. He watches Persephone in the arms of her husband, her lips red with pomegranate, weeping and laughing in the same breath, and knows that ecstasy means many things. When he is grown to dark-eyed adulthood he goes up to the world of humanity, for in the sunlight he has things he must grow, but he never forgets that he has a home within the earth. - A third story is told. In this story, the child Dionysus is hidden, not by the heavy layers of earth and death, but by women's clothes - long skirts, curls in his dark hair, paint reddening his cheeks. He is raised by Semele's sister, the queen Ino, who does not know how to raise this god-child who traverses all bounds. She is kind, and does the best she can, but the young god bursts in wildness from her human tutelage. Still young, he goes to Asia, dressing sometimes as a man, sometimes as a woman, as his mood suits, and everywhere forming his worship, molding it out of his own hands. Vines wind around his bare forearms and to all he is beloved. His journeys take him to the limits of the sky, to his father's palace, where he stands before his stepmother's simmering fury and demands his place with a red smile. When it is given to him he demands something else - his fire-murdered mother, beloved in his imagination, returned to life and given glimmering immortality. Yes, he is told, if he desires it, but he must fetch her from beneath the earth himself. This prospect does not frighten him: he travels down, singing with a throaty voice, his thyrsus marking the time. His vines make a bridge for him across the dark, seething waters of Acheron, and soon he travels through the mists of Hades, his songs echoing on the silence like blows upon the taut hide of a drum. In the Fields of Asphodel he finds his mother, a girl as she was when she died, her eyes blinded with the same fire that brightened his, and leads her with him like a Maenad. With a mad solemnity he promises to teach her to dance. As he leaves he does not apologize to his uncle for stealing a citizen from his realm. He only leaves vines winding around the trunks of the pomegranate trees, a parting gift. Soon they hang heavy with grapes which, when pressed, make a wine strong as death. Persephone watches him go, and in her silence she understands.",

    "text": "\"Senseless.\" Hera lets that word be her curse. Her husband is senseless, of course. His pursuit of women - nymphs - goddesses - is against all sense. Then again, there was little sense in their marriage. This is the sense of their existence now. He thinks he hides what he does. She sees, and does all she can to preserve her honour. And others suffer. Especially the women. She is goddess of birth. She doesn't know why Zeus thinks he can hide bastards and wenches from her. At her side, the peacock spreads his tail. The hundred eyes of Argos look around. They are at peace. All she can do is make the best of her senseless husband's doings. There is only one in all of Hades's domain who never mourns. The boy sits in the golden fields, under the sun-that-is-not. He dangles his feet in a stream. His toenails are still singed, like the ends of his blond hair. He smiles. Sometimes, he laughs quietly at his own thoughts. A swan swims along the river, and when it passes the boy, it nips at his tunic. The boy smiles and throws it grains. When it hisses, he hisses back. When others ask him why he never mourns, Phaeton looks surprised. After all, he did touch the sun. It's only in stories that cities rise easily. It takes three years for the walls to be finished. The dragon-soldiers take wives from local villages. The wives' brothers come to the city to help, and to shelter from the wars. They bring their wives, and their aging parents, and the villages follow. Three years later, Cadmus stands on top of the tower. Around him, there is the city. Slaves are sweeping up the marketplace. The sun has set, only a red glow on the horizon. \"It's not fire,\" Athena says. \"I know it's not fire.\" He smiles. \"You taught me how to recognise it, remember? And how to teach people to fight it.\" She crosses her arms. The armour makes a dull sound, or maybe that's her snort of disbelief. Cadmus offers the goddess his hand. \"Thank you.\" She takes his hand with a frown. It's a Tyrian custom, and he doesn't feel like losing it. \"It's not over,\" she says. \"You will have a long life.\" \"Everyone does. Except the ones who die early.\" Cadmus smiles. \"I'd rather thank you when I can. I'll do the formalities tomorrow. Would you like an ox or several goats?\" Athena's fingers squeeze his. She smiles, just a little. The grass tears under the grasping fingers. One clump holds, and the fingers, hand, arm, pull the body attached to them out of the water. Hermaphroditos shakes. The arm gives out. The fall to the ground is a shock that brings up water from abused lungs. He retches, water and bile. When it stops, he pushes his tongue against his teeth to spit out the last of it. His teeth are smaller, closer together, and the shock of it makes him retch again. It's harder to stop it this time. He lies on his side, looking at the grass. He, he thinks. He can feel her, what used to be her, a languid heat at the base of his spine. If he stops thinking, he can be her. But he won't, he knows, because Hermaphroditos is the son of the Lady and the Messenger, and stronger than a nymph. Stronger than a nymph anywhere except in the lake and river she commands. Hermaphroditos feels that his leg is still in the water. He knows he almost drowned. He used that last breath for his curse. \"Mother,\" he whispers. Inside him, something twists in fear. The nymph would fear his mother, but the nymph - part of him - is a woman, and women are his mother's domain. He forces out the prayer past too-narrow teeth. Aphrodite does not come, but her peace descends on her son (son-daughter). He rolls to his back, feeling each grain of dirt and blade of grass. The sun is blinding. With his eyes closed, he moves his hands over his body. The chest is softer, and his exploring fingers stop at the hips, then return upwards. The shoulders are narrower now. There is a depression in the middle of the right collarbone. Did the nymph ever break hers? He knows the nymphs who serve his mother are often hunters, but his limbs are heavier now, softer. Hermaphroditos wonders how his face looks like. He can feel a slimmer jaw, more flesh on the cheekbones. The hair is longer and that, more than anything, drives home the change. Like a woman, he cries. The sun dries the tears. Hermaphroditos rises, arms spread for balance. The lake is behind him (her). It's a slumbering presence at the back of the mind. A source of power. Hermaphroditos opens hir mind, letting the power flow. It is hir lake now. The crown is heavy on her head. The black of the robe makes her tanned skin sallow. With the silver earrings, her freckles look ridiculous. Behind her, a curtain moves. The reflection of her husband appears next to her in the mirror. \"You are late,\" he says. His voice grates. \"It was a warm autumn,\" Kore says. She shrugs, in an imitation of her mother. \"Do you know it's warm up there? There was corn and fruit to be gathered, and I had my friends to walk with me to the orchards. The air smelled of apples. We could bathe in the sea and stay out late and sing and dance and have fun.\" Her voice is piercing, she knows. It always is. The underworld is cold and dreary and she doesn't fit here so much that it hurts. He takes her hand, and she smiles. The spiders are born by the hundreds. They scatter, tiny black many-legged pearls. They find their way to the highest trees and to the lowest cellars. And each of the spiders weaves a net in their own pattern. Each of the patterns hearkens back to the first. Arachne has taught her craft to a nation. Her art will never be forgotten.",

    "text": "\"America?\" Artemis checked her horse as it attempted to shy at a passing breeze, and appraised the man who had approached her. Too short, too florid, too soft in the stomach. He was nothing like Orion had been -- but then, Orion would never have sat through the tedium of acquiring a classical education. And classical educations were wonderful things. \"They say the colonies offer boundless prospects to a man with his wits about him,\" the florid man said, edging his roan horse closer to hers. \"Of course, it's no place for a woman on her own, Miss Hunter, but my brother has made quite a success for himself in the tobacco business, and I suspect your brother might be interested in a proposition.\" He winked. Artemis stifled a frown. Oh, for the times when she had the power and freedom to hunt whatever prey she chose, whenever she chose. Still. If idiots like this were sailing across the western ocean these days, perhaps it was time for her family to explore new ranges as well. \"Brother?\" she called, raising her voice and lifting one hand from her reins to attract Apollo's attention. \"Alex, dear, this fellow -- Mister... oh, how silly of me, I seem to have forgotten your name, sir -- Alex, this fellow has a proposition for you.\" She pressed her right heel into her horse's side, encouraging him to sidle a step away from the florid man. Apollo excused himself from a squawking clutch of landed gentry and their various human accoutrements and strode across the meadow, grasses and wildflowers bending subtly aside to keep dust and pollen away from his clothes. \"Cynthia, dearest, do recall that the hunt is yet to start -- there is no call to speak at the top of your lungs.\" He nodded to the florid boor. \"Good day, Mister Burleigh. You wished to speak with me?\" \"Ah, yes, indeed, Doctor Hunter,\" said the boor. \"Miss Hunter, I am pleased to make your acquaintance, and look forward to the opportunity to admire your horsemanship, which I am told is superior.\" Now the men would begin discussing matters of the world, so she, as a gently bred woman, was expected to excuse herself and join the handful of wives and daughters who had come to watch their menfolk hunt. Artemis sighed. \"I am sure my riding is nothing special, but I thank you for the compliment.\" She directed her horse to the far edge of the clearing, where grass abruptly gave way to oak and ash and elm, and wondered when their hosts would finally stop indulging this chatter and lollygagging and set the hounds to flush the fox. Apollo might be here to talk medicine and money, but she had used nearly the whole remaining store of her power to make the humans overlook the incongruity of a woman sitting her horse astride rather than sidesaddle and riding with the hounds as an equal to the men. She had no patience left for idle conversation. Artemis hungered for the chase and the kill. This business with foxes was a pitiful imitation of her former glory, but hunting was all she had left besides Apollo, and she would not let the memory of her forests go without a fight. --------------- \"America.\" \"Don't sound so dubious,\" said Apollo, frowning at the harpsichord as he ran through a set of scales. \"This contraption has gone out of tune again. Hermes's blasted turtle shell held a pitch better than this.\" \"Naturally it did; one of us made it,\" said Artemis. She scratched behind the ears of Arcas, her latest greyhound, soothing him until he dropped his head back onto his paws beside her on the sofa. \"Are you playing this evening or will you simply grumble until moonrise?\" \"I am going to fix this beast. You may do what you wish,\" Apollo said as he propped up the lid of the harpsichord and glared down at the strings. He pressed three keys -- Arcas whined at the dissonant jangle -- and began tightening screws. \"Meanwhile, I repeat: Mister Burleigh has suggested that I go to America and set up practice in Charlestown. The area is apparently ripe for growth and educated men are somewhat scarce on the ground compared to farmers and merchants.\" \"I repeat: America,\" said Artemis, abandoning the sofa to stalk back and forth across the parlor of the townhouse she and her brother had been renting these past five years. \"If educated men are scarce on the ground, who will know our names? It is enough trouble to get by in Europe, where at least the memory of our reign is imprinted in the very bones of the earth.\" Apollo laid his left hand flat on the harpsichord keys, playing a deliberately ear-mauling noise. \"Leave the poetry to me. You have no ear for it. But think, Artemis: the memory of our past may sustain us, but it also imprisons us. In Europe, we are dead as dust. Everyone knows that nobody worships the gods of Greece and Rome these days. In America, though, who is to say what we might persuade people to try in the name of new beginnings?\" \"For a god of learning, you can be unspeakably thick. They will never give up their Christ,\" Artemis snapped. \"They will shove him down the throats of the Indians until their own gods are reduced to pitiful shadows, like us. We are stuck with a half life, brother. At least this one is comfortable. Why borrow trouble?\" Apollo played a chord, twisted a screw a quarter turn, played again, and nodded to himself. \"For a goddess of wild places, you can be unspeakably domestic,\" he said. \"Honestly, Artemis, when was the last time we did anything interesting? We used to play games with whole nations at stake. We used to matter. Even if we remain shadows of ourselves, we might matter on a human scale in a new world.\" He sat on his padded bench and ventured a series of two-handed chords and arpeggios. Nothing jarred more than was inevitable on an instrument with such range, and he smiled. \"Ah. Harmony restored.\" Artemis eyed him skeptically. \"You want to find meaning and purpose for your life. Among humans.\" \"I don't see how it's any of your business if I do,\" said Apollo. \"I think I shall accept Mister Burleigh's offer. You may remain here in Oxford with your dogs and horses and rot in your comfortable prison for all I care. I shall be recreating myself in a new world.\" He began to play a popular tune, humming under his breath in his vibrant, golden tenor. Artemis took a moment to place the melody. Greensleeves. Oh. Suddenly, her brother's determination to leave civilization for the wilderness, and to play the virtuous human doctor, made vastly more sense. \"Which of Burleigh's relatives have you fallen for and what is her name?\" she asked. \"Edith, his niece,\" said Apollo, still playing the silly melodramatic song. \"She and her brother are visiting England now that James is defeated in Ireland and William secure on the throne. The brother will remain in Oxford to study law, but Edith will return to her father in Charlestown next spring.\" \"With a husband, one presumes.\" Artemis's fingers twitched, aching to curve around a javelin or bow. \"Tell me, brother, why I should not find the girl and slay her on the spot as you do to my lovers. It would be kinder for her in the end.\" \"I killed one presumptuous human--\" Apollo began. \"Orion was not presumptuous! Actaeon was presumptuous. I am perfectly capable of dealing with presumption myself. You killed Orion out of jealousy.\" Apollo shrugged. \"Perhaps. Whatever the case, that business is long over and done. Edith, on the other hand, is living here and now, and if you so much as speak crossly to her--\" \"--you will moan and whine and be impossible to live with for a week, and then you will forget her and forgive me, as you always do,\" Artemis finished for him. \"But I confess I have grown bored these past decades, so I will concede not to kill her out of hand. You will introduce us. If she is tolerable, I may even let you keep her until you find a new obsession.\" \"How marvelously charitable of you,\" Apollo murmured, rustling through a stack of sheet music. \"Will you also graciously accompany us to Charlestown and live in our house until she dies and I inherit? Or will you vanish into the woods as you did when we were young?\" Artemis smiled. \"I will leave you guessing, of course. What else is family for?\" She sank gracefully back onto the sofa and settled one hand on her greyhound's ribs, waiting for her brother to entertain her. --------------- \"America!\" Edith spun in a tight circle, throwing out her arms and letting her unpinned hair whip round like a heavy rope. \"Do you see, Cynthia? There, that green low on the horizon -- that is America!\" \"I'm sure it will be lovely once we are close enough to make out details,\" said Artemis, stepping forward to catch her sister-in-law before the girl tripped herself and crashed to the deck. \"You should not be so careless in your condition.\" \"Oh, I am not nearly so far along as all that,\" said Edith, but she allowed Artemis to walk her over to the port rail and lean against it for support. She craned her neck, looking forward and aft, but Apollo was nowhere in sight. \"Where is Alexander? I have not seen him since we ate this morning.\" Artemis pulled her skirts away from a passing sailor's feet. \"Most likely he has vanished into the captain's cabin again in his ongoing quest to learn navigation. Alex gets caught up in his obsessions and often neglects to tell people where he is going. You may have noticed this by now,\" Artemis said dryly. Edith laughed. \"True -- like my brother sneaking off to read filthy poems in Greek when he was meant to be working sums for our father. Well, I am used to that sort of thing,\" said Edith. \"It is much safer to for a man to lose himself in a book than to lose himself in the forest.\" \"Also true,\" agreed Artemis. For one thing, gods of wisdom were generally pleased to find others in their domain, so long as the scholars did not boast too highly of their knowledge. Gods of the wilderness and the hunt, on the other hand... well, suffice it to say that there were reasons her archery had been feared in her heyday. She wondered how long Edith would last before Apollo tired of her, and whether the girl would still have enough spirit to be worth hunting by then. \"Still, enough of Alexander,\" said Edith. \"We've come safely through wind and wave all the way to the Carolinas. Tonight we will eat at my father's table. Soon I will have my own house, and perhaps you will find a man in town who is as good to you as Alexander is to me. I would dearly wish to see you happy, Cynthia.\" Find a man who would be as good to her as Apollo was to his lovers? That would not be difficult. Find a man she would care to dally with? That would be much harder. Since Orion, there had been so few-- But enough of melancholy. Artemis turned to the horizon and the low, green smudge of land that held the next chapter of her life, unwritten and full of unknown potential. \"Your uncle told me once that America is full of boundless prospects, for those who have the strength and wit to pursue them,\" she said to Edith. \"I am an excellent huntress. I am sure I will find happiness here, one way or another.\" \"Spoken like the sister I know and worship,\" said Apollo, sweeping up from behind them to wrap one arm around Edith and another around Artemis. \"This is a new beginning for us all. Let us make the most of it.\" Edith tilted her head upward to meet Apollo's kiss, and they proceeded to make an indecent spectacle of themselves, according to English standards. Artemis stepped away and closed her eyes, letting the forests and islands and temples of Europe slip away. That was past. That was gone, like her dogs and horses and spears. Yes, the humans' memory of those days sustained her, but she did not have to be that old self anymore. Whatever she and Apollo became in this new land would be their choice, and theirs alone. Faintly, the sea wind carried the scent of trees to her nose. --------------- End of Story",

      "\"With a husband, one presumes.\"",
      "Artemis's fingers twitched, aching to curve around a javelin or bow.",
      "\"Tell me, brother, why I should not find the girl and slay her on the spot as you do to my lovers.",
      "It would be kinder for her in the end.\"",
      "\"I killed one presumptuous human--\" Apollo began.",
      "\"Orion was not presumptuous!",
      "Actaeon was presumptuous.",
      "I am perfectly capable of dealing with presumption myself.",
      "You killed Orion out of jealousy.\"",
      "Apollo shrugged.",
      "\"Perhaps.",
      "Whatever the case, that business is long over and done.",
      "Edith, on the other hand, is living here and now, and if you so much as speak crossly to her--\" \"--you will moan and whine and be impossible to live with for a week, and then you will forget her and forgive me, as you always do,\" Artemis finished for him.",
      "\"But I confess I have grown bored these past decades, so I will concede not to kill her out of hand.",
      "You will introduce us.",
      "If she is tolerable, I may even let you keep her until you find a new obsession.\"",
      "\"How marvelously charitable of you,\" Apollo murmured, rustling through a stack of sheet music.",
      "\"Will you also graciously accompany us to Charlestown and live in our house until she dies and I inherit?",
      "Or will you vanish into the woods as you did when we were young?\" Artemis smiled.",
      "\"I will leave you guessing, of course.",
      "What else is family for?\"",
      "She sank gracefully back onto the sofa and settled one hand on her greyhound's ribs, waiting for her brother to entertain her.",
      "--------------- \"America!\"",
      "Edith spun in a tight circle, throwing out her arms and letting her unpinned hair whip round like a heavy rope.",
      "\"Do you see, Cynthia?",
      "There, that green low on the horizon -- that is America!\"",
      "\"I'm sure it will be lovely once we are close enough to make out details,\" said Artemis, stepping forward to catch her sister-in-law before the girl tripped herself and crashed to the deck.",
      "\"You should not be so careless in your condition.\"",
      "\"Oh, I am not nearly so far along as all that,\" said Edith, but she allowed Artemis to walk her over to the port rail and lean against it for support.",
      "She craned her neck, looking forward and aft, but Apollo was nowhere in sight.",
      "\"Where is Alexander?",
      "I have not seen him since we ate this morning.\"",
      "Artemis pulled her skirts away from a passing sailor's feet.",
      "\"Most likely he has vanished into the captain's cabin again in his ongoing quest to learn navigation.",
      "Alex gets caught up in his obsessions and often neglects to tell people where he is going.",
      "You may have noticed this by now,\" Artemis said dryly.",
      "Edith laughed.",
      "\"True -- like my brother sneaking off to read filthy poems in Greek when he was meant to be working sums for our father.",
      "Well, I am used to that sort of thing,\" said Edith.",
      "\"It is much safer to for a man to lose himself in a book than to lose himself in the forest.\"",
      "\"Also true,\" agreed Artemis.",
      "For one thing, gods of wisdom were generally pleased to find others in their domain, so long as the scholars did not boast too highly of their knowledge.",
      "Gods of the wilderness and the hunt, on the other hand... well, suffice it to say that there were reasons her archery had been feared in her heyday.",
      "She wondered how long Edith would last before Apollo tired of her, and whether the girl would still have enough spirit to be worth hunting by then.",
      "\"Still, enough of Alexander,\" said Edith.",
      "\"We've come safely through wind and wave all the way to the Carolinas.",
      "Tonight we will eat at my father's table.",
      "Soon I will have my own house, and perhaps you will find a man in town who is as good to you as Alexander is to me.",
      "I would dearly wish to see you happy, Cynthia.\"",
      "Find a man who would be as good to her as Apollo was to his lovers?",
      "That would not be difficult.",
      "Find a man she would care to dally with?",
      "That would be much harder.",
      "Since Orion, there had been so few-- But enough of melancholy.",
      "Artemis turned to the horizon and the low, green smudge of land that held the next chapter of her life, unwritten and full of unknown potential.",
      "\"Your uncle told me once that America is full of boundless prospects, for those who have the strength and wit to pursue them,\" she said to Edith.",
      "\"I am an excellent huntress.",
      "I am sure I will find happiness here, one way or another.\"",
      "\"Spoken like the sister I know and worship,\" said Apollo, sweeping up from behind them to wrap one arm around Edith and another around Artemis.",
      "\"This is a new beginning for us all.",
      "Let us make the most of it.\"",
      "Edith tilted her head upward to meet Apollo's kiss, and they proceeded to make an indecent spectacle of themselves, according to English standards.",
      "Artemis stepped away and closed her eyes, letting the forests and islands and temples of Europe slip away.",
      "That was past.",
      "That was gone, like her dogs and horses and spears.",
      "Yes, the humans' memory of those days sustained her, but she did not have to be that old self anymore.",
      "Whatever she and Apollo became in this new land would be their choice, and theirs alone.",
      "Faintly, the sea wind carried the scent of trees to her nose.",

    "text": "Thetis lives by the sea. Achilles is overcome by a sense of peace as he walks along the beach, sifting the sand through his bare toes. He carries his shoes in one hand and hitches up his kilt delicately with the other. Overhead the gulls are crying their welcome home. He's about to think that it isn't right to be this happy, then pushes the thought away. It comes back with the gull's next cry. He squints at the light and hurries on to knock at the blue door, shoes grating on the glints of brine and fish scales. It's been four years since he was last here, painting it with Patroklos' help (kissing him in full view of the watching waves). It's faded now, stripped and peeling with the wind and salt, but still blue. And Thetis is still white, and her hair still the dry, delicate gold of sea-snakes and sand. To Achilles she is beautiful, even though she and he are both four years older than when they last met. She doesn't hear his knock on the door, doesn't hear his canny footsteps springing along the floorboard, doesn't turn her head from the window as he comes in to her room. He has to touch her to become part of her world, take her fingers in his own to speak her language. Her voice, when she speaks, is unnecessarily loud. \"Achilles,\" she says, turning, her voice resounding like a foghorn in the wooden room. He squeezes her hand. Her face softens. \"My little boy.\" He faces her fully. \"How are you, Mother?\" he asks silently, his lips outlining the words like carven fruit. She breaks into a smile. \"Lonely,\" she says. \"You?\" He shakes his head and hopes his eyes will speak to her. She hesitates for one bare moment before opening her arms and folds him into an embrace. Thetis is in turns called a goddess, a witch, a mad woman and a traitor. She has run away from people, her own husband in particular, all her life. They disturb her. This is contrary - but not very contrary - to the fact that she is the daughter of a man mightier than Agamemnon king of kings, and once sat at banquets which might have put the Tudor monarchy to shame, plying cutlery and diplomatic conversation in a manner worthy of their Victorian successors. (She is the reason Achilles knows which fork to pick up during which course at a dinner in Mycenae.) Thetis is more educated than most of the men at Achilles' father's court. She is also more easily frightened of cages and graves than most young animals in the stables. An incident of violence soon after Achilles' birth left her permanently deaf, and free at last of the music of kitchen sinks and snores, she drifted away from big, blustery Peleus, who loves her still, but shares much of her straight-backed pride, and refuses to set his eyes on her again. This is the only common bond of their royalty. Thetis, too, refuses to meet her husband or her father's family, although she still owns the favours and the ears (oh, cruel pun) of the highest and mightiest of them. She is Destiny's failed experiment, and finally, on the seashore, she has freed herself from its persistent clutches. \"What is Destiny, after all,\" she muses thoughtfully over her mulled wine, \"but another name for Death.\" Achilles at her feet shifts restlessly. Her aged, icy eyes fall on him and pierce his heart. \"What should I do?\" he asks her. She shrugs gracefully. \"You know I've always encouraged you to make your own decisions,\" she begins. \"Ma,\" he says. \"I will.\" \"Then - do.\" \"Do you want me to go?\" Her face wrinkles a moment, a helpless wave. Her voice drops to a whisper, like the sea lapping in to shore. \"I don't want to tell you,\" she says. He puts his hand on her knee. \"You didn't want me to have a sword four years ago.\" \"Four years ago,\" she tries to laugh. \"Four years ago you were fourteen years old. You were still my baby, even though I tried to make you believe that we were just friends.\" His lips quirk. He's not smiling, he's frowning. \"That reminds me,\" she says, in a voice that signifies a changing tide. \"Your son and his mother were here to see me a while ago.\" \"Yeah. I mean - yes.\" he nods. \"They're quite well,\" she says carefully. \"He's very clever. For a three-year old.\" \"I know.\" He doesn't. He hasn't seen his ex-fiancee or his son since little Neo's second birthday. Neoptolemus, wise beyond his years. \"Do they know that you might go to Troy?\" \"I haven't told anyone yet,\" he says. \"I haven't made up my mind.\" \"Make it up fast,\" she says. \"The gods will not wait for you, nor Agamemnon.\" \"But I don't know--\" he begins, and stops. She looks down at him and takes his hand then, and draws him to look out of her window. \"It's never happened to me before,\" he says uncertainly to the Aegean. She rests her head against the pane and watches his mouth. \"I always thought - it's been so easy to make decisions. Out on the streets I am called fleet-footed Achilles, but they know that I'm just as quick with my eyes, with my heart. I've never needed to stop and think before. And now - now it's even easier. A yes/no choice. Stay or go. Life or death. Chance or destiny.\" She strokes his hair as he pauses, his eyes warring with the setting sun. \"What keeps you here?\" she asks softly. \"I know you aren't afraid.\" \"No,\" he says. \"But Deidamia and Neo will be. Peleus. My lands, my folks. Patroklos.\" He pauses again. \"You.\" She shakes her head to say, Not on my account. They watch the sky come over dark. \"What is the ocean,\" Thetis wonders aloud, \"but drop upon drop.\" \"Little drops of water,\" Achilles repeats automatically. What is the ocean but individual drops of water. What is the world but a breath at a time. \"Achilles,\" she says suddenly, louder than ever. \"Achilles.\" \"Yes, Mother?\" He takes her lace-crafted hand, white and translucifying. \"No one will be there to die with you,\" she says. \"Here, there, anywhere.\" His brow furrows. \"I know,\" he says. \"I know that.\" \"Remember it.\" Her voice crashes against the rocks of the shore, comes back to Achilles as a mighty whisper. \"Your tomorrows are so uncertain in these times. If you go, at least something will be salvaged. Something will be sure.\" \"I never thought of it that way,\" he says awkwardly. She hasn't been looking at him; she hasn't heard him. She closes her eyes and turns her face against the wind. \"Glory,\" she breathes, out into the cold starry air. -- \"I'm probably going, after all,\" he finally tells her as he leaves before daybreak. \"Patroklos - Patroklos thinks we should.\" She looks at him oddly, then nods and kisses his brow. \"You're so young,\" she says, and for the first time since evening her voice is soft and measured, like a human mother's voice. \"You don't know anything.\" \"Goodbye, Ma,\" he says. \"But you'll have enough time to learn, I suppose,\" she says. \"Yes,\" he says, not really understanding. \"I'll come to see you.\" \"Ma - thanks. I don't think you should.\" She places a fond hand against his cheek. \"I am your mother, aren't I,\" she says. Achilles thinks that now is not the time to bring up the fact that she's never said it quite that way before. It all worked out for the best after all, he thinks in the car, driving back home. He's never really understood her. They've never belonged in each other's world.",

    "text": "They don't start out as friends. Venus is not a goddess who likes to share, and she resents the takeover of her temples, the usurpation of her titles and imagery. She especially resents that mortals now associate these things with a virgin. Once, the Romans called her Venus Genetrix, called her \"Mother\". Venus is thoroughly prepared to dislike Mary, whom she expects to be boring and holier-than-thou, or irritatingly naive like so many other \"virgins\" who've borne the progeny of gods. It turns out, though, that Mary is a pretty cool chick. No matter how many people call her the Queen of Heaven, she's still just Miriam from Nazareth at heart. The first time they meet, Venus says, \"Ave, Maria\" to be polite. Mary smiles at her and says \"Shalom\". There is something about Mary's smile, her warmth, that Venus finds irresistible. They strike up a conversation about where to get the best lamb in Rome and the trials of divine motherhood (and why no one can manage to paint a divine baby that looks like an actual baby). Mary is adjusting pretty well, all things considered, but she confesses that her fellow virgins, Diana and Minerva, aren't really all that much fun (Venus secretly agrees). They strike up an unlikely friendship. And friendship with Venus pretty much always comes with benefits. Venus was worried that the phrase \"Blessed Mary, Ever-virgin\" might be literally true. Maybe her hymen grew back, like Prometheus's liver. Maybe she really hadn't ever known the touch of a man, though that seemed highly unlikely, given that she was married, after all. But it turns out it's just one of those things they say, that it's a metaphorical and theological virginity (the regard humans have for which has never made any sense to Venus). Mary has deep brown eyes and a gorgeous tumble of black curls, her Semitic skin a gorgeous olive hue. Her blue veil is thrown over the back of the chair in Venus's bedchamber, the rest of her clothes are strewn about the floor. She smells of lilies, which mingle with the smell of the ocean breeze through the window and the pungent smell of female arousal that fills the room. Venus inhales deeply. She knows all the ways a woman's body can be made to feel pleasure, and she's been slowly teaching Mary, who is an excellent student. (It surprises her that Mary's so willing, but Mary points out that there's nothing in the Torah forbidding sex between two women.) She takes in the sight of Mary's body laid out on the bed, the picture of ideal womanhood, soft and full, her hair tumbled out over her head. Venus dips down and sucks first on one nipple, then the other. Mary makes a breathy sound of pleasure underneath her. Venus uses her mouth and hands to toy with Mary's breasts, until Mary's squirming underneath her, her legs spreading open. Venus reaches her hand down, strokes over Mary's clit, feels how wet she is. She slides a finger in, then two. She's rewarded with a hitch of Mary's hips. Three fingers go in effortlessly. What Venus has in mind beyond that is going to require a change in position. \"Knees up, my Star of the Sea, legs spread nice and wide.\" Mary obliges, and Venus takes another moment to enjoy the view. Three fingers again, stroking up and stimulating the g-spot, which earns her a moan. Now four, close together. She works them in and out, and Mary is clearly enjoying herself. She tucks her thumb into the bundle of her fingers and adds it. Mortals would need lube, but Venus is the goddess of sex and desire and has no need for Astroglide. Mary is slick and wet and eager, and Venus can make her even more so. Mary sighs in pleasure. Venus has elegant, graceful hands, and she knows how to use them. The feeling of Venus's fingers inside her, stroking her, stretching her open is one she has come to love. It straddles the border of pleasure and pain and never fails to give her an orgasm (of course, if Mary doesn't have an orgasm when she's with Venus, it's because Venus doesn't want her to). Mary has no idea how many of Venus's fingers are inside her, she can't really tell at this point, can only feel the delicious fullness, the intensity of the sensation. Venus has worked her whole hand in, up to the wrist, and Mary is overcome with pleasure. But then she sighs in disappointment when she feels Venus's hand withdraws. Venus smiles. She places her hands together, palms facing each other, and begins to slide them in. Ten fingers, sliding in. She intends to go slowly, gently, but Mary, who normally has the patience of a saint (as well she should) is bucking her hips. Venus holds her hands still, letting Mary adjust and control the movement. After a few moments, she pushes in, enjoying the gasp from Mary's mouth as she works her hands in up to the wrist, collapsing them so that one hand is balled inside the other. Mary screams out, a combination of pleasure and pain, sensation too intense to process. She orgasms in waves, her muscles clenching almost painfully down on Venus's hands, and Venus rides the waves with her, absorbing the power of Mary's pleasure and reveling in the power she has to make her feel it. Occasionally she wriggles a finger a bit or clenches or unclenches her hands, bringing forth a new wave of orgasm, until she can tell that Mary is spent, panting on the bed, eyes rolled back in her head, limbs loose, inarticulate. Slowly, gently, she withdraws her hands, and Mary moans as they come out. Mary wants them out, but she doesn't, wants the pain to go away without losing that deliciously full feeling. Venus wipes her hands clean on a cloth near the side of the bed and crawls up to hold Mary, who kisses her full on the lips and then allows her head to be cradled onto Venus's bosom. Venus strokes Mary's now-sweat-streaked hair until they both fall asleep.",

    "text": "The night they met, he hadn't realized who she was. He had gone to Greece to fight in the Revolution. One night, drinking at a bar with Bryon and Sam Howe and other Phillhellines (and he likes that word, all those \"l\"s tripping off the tongue), a beautiful woman walked into the bar, and even though they did't know who she was, they were all riveted by her. It was pretty much a given that either Jack or Byron would be the first to approach her. Jack, having two perfectly good feet, beat Byron to the punch.He got more than he bargained for. ---- \"Not yet, Jack.\" Aphrodite smiles sweetly and makes him stop. If Aphrodite tells you to wait, you wait, regardless of how much or how little self-control you might normally have. Jack groans in frustration. He is rock-hard and balls-deep inside the goddess of desire, and she won't let him finish. She whispers in his ear, \"You trust me, don't you, Jack?\" He nods. Somewhere deep in the back of his mind he thinks that perhaps he shouldn't trust her, that lust and desire are never things to be trusted- enjoyed, indulged, yes, but never trusted. He's not tied up, he's not held down, he's under no contract, he's free to leave whenever he wants. But he can't orgasm until she says so, and so he stays. Jack enjoys making the implicit power explicit as much as the next guy, but Aphrodite is a goddess, and she loves power. Jack wants her, wants every inch of her, and she knows it, any one who knew how to look could see it on his face, but she can feel it. The feeling of his desire is as sweet as ambrosia, and she's going to take her fill. She takes him in her mouth, slowly, sliding lips down to meet the base of his cock, tongue making lazy patterns on the shaft. She swallows around him. She would smile at the way he gasps, desperate, but it's hard to smile with a full mouth. Every time she feels him approach orgasm, she holds him there by changing her technique, or stopping, or simply through sheer force of her divine will. Jack would have thought it was impossible not to orgasm while Aphrodite deepthroated him, but that was before he met her. He's frustrated, but not too frustrated to enjoy a good thing while it lasts. She straddles his face; Jack has a quick and nimble tongue. He does his level best to bring her off while she strokes him in her hand, stopping each time he gets to the edge. She comes five times before she dismounts and kisses his cheek, then his mouth, tasting her own sweetness on his lips. \"Please\" he says. He aches, he wants, he needs. She smiles at him, sweetly. \"Please what?\" she asks. \"Please let me come\" he says, his voice desperate, almost prayerful. Aphrodite lays back on the bed, spreads her legs in invitation. \"Be my guest,\" she says. Jack positions himself between her legs and slides into her, closing his eyes in bliss as he feels himself slide inside her, feels her warm wetness enfold him. Jack may be desperate, but he still has his pride, so he does his best to take his time, long, slow, full strokes, until Aphrodite is moving her hips underneath him, urging him faster and harder, and he obliges. She orgasms and the contractions bring him over the edge, finally, blissfully. He holds himself still letting the pleasure and relief wash over him for a moment before collapsing back on the bed. \"Thank you\" he breathes out. \"Oh, believe me, it was my pleasure\" Aphrodite tells him before he slips into sleep.

    "text": "Aphrodite likes it rough. She likes it soft and gentle too, rose petals and candles. But sometimes she wants the thorns, wants the candle wax dripped on her skin. Hephastus, her ever-obliging husband, made her a gorgeous set of metal cuffs and chains, and sometimes she wears them, and sometimes her partner does. But when she really wants it rough, without the trappings, without restraint, she calls Ares. Ares has no qualms about hurting her, won't hesitate to take what he wants and make her beg for more. Nobody ever makes Aphrodite beg. Sometimes she worries that this means he's stronger than her, but she can start wars too, and she could bring him down if she really wanted to. And she knows he wants her, desires her, she can see it in his eyes, hear it in his voice, feel it in his kiss.... He's holding her wrists down, one on either side of her head. She struggles a little. She doesn't want to get away, she just wants to know that she can't, wants to feel the strength in his arms as he holds her down. He growls at her and shoves her wrists down harder against the bed. If she were mortal, he'd have to worry about the circulation to her hands, but she's not. He leans his head in and bites at her neck, and she arches her back, moaning. He's pinned her legs somehow, some sort of crazy wrestling trick, and she'll have to ask him to show her later, but right now, she's just trying to arch into him, grind against him, and she can't. She can't really do anything but moan and whimper and whisper in his ear. \"Fuck me.\" He chuckles, throaty and pleased with himself. \"Patience, dove.\" Just because Aphrodite can start a war doesn't mean she's the boss of him. Right now he's enjoying nibbling at her neck and feeling the tendons of her hands move under his as she wiggles her fingers, impotently impatient. He moves his head lower and sucks on her nipples, one, then the other, feels them hard and firm in his mouth, teases them with his tongue. He pulls her hands above her head shifts his grip, so that her wrists are crossed under one hand, leaving the other free. He starts the nibbling again, his free hand caressing her, molding her breasts, pinching her nipples. She wriggles underneath him, her body responding with pleasure. He slides his hand lower, eases a finger into the cleft between her legs, teases her clit, enjoys the look on her face as she tips her head back in pleasure, her beautiful body stretched out beneath him. He puts his knee between hers and spreads her legs apart. He repositions himself again, takes one wrist in each hand and slides them down, maneuvering them over the bed until her hands are where he wants them, by her sides. He angles himself into her, and she tips her hips to meet him. She is wet and tight and perfect, just as she is every time, and he fits into her as perfectly and cleanly as a sword into its sheath. She wraps her legs around his waist, locks her ankles at the small of his back. She bucks her hips to his rhythm, pulling him into her, harder, deeper. She tries to reach up and kiss him, lick his neck, bite his shoulder, but she can't rise up far enough because of how he's holding her. She growls in frustration, and tries to free her hands. He responds by pushing them down harder against the bed, and speeding up his rhythm. When she can sense that Ares is right on the brink, she flexes her muscles around him, and he comes inside her, hard, and she's right behind him, her muscles spasming on his twitching cock. He holds onto her the whole time, arms still pinned to the bed, until he's done and has pulled out and stands up to go fetch them both some wine. There are fingerprints on her wrists, but they'll be healed by morning.",

    "text": "For these give joy and sorrow; but thou, Proserpina, sleep.\"~Algernon C. Swinburne, from \"Hymn to Proserpina\" Psyche stepped out of the mouth of the tunnel, gripping the box that Aphrodite had given her. It was heavy, now, filled with Persephone's beauty. Glancing behind her, Psyche shivering at the sight of the dark tunnel leading down to Hades. She wished she could erase the journey from her mind -- the women washing their bloody garments in the river Styx, the wistful ghosts lining the shores, Charon leering at her as he plucked the copper coins from her mouth... Psyche shuddered, hurrying away from the tunnel's mouth. \"Come back and visit any time,\" Persephone had told her as she placed the box in Psyche's hands. Psyche had nodded, smiling sweetly, but now she vowed that only death itself could make her step back into Tartarus. For a moment, she envied the gods their immortality. How miserable and dreary death must be! Psyche hurried through the streets of Lacadaemon, wanting to leave that tunnel and the memory of the underworld far behind her. Only when she'd left the city and started down the long path towards Aphrodite's palace did the tension begin to leave her shoulders. She'd done it! She'd ventured into hell itself and emerged again, unscathed! Which other mortal woman could say such a thing? Better still, she'd completed her fourth and final task! Hugging the beautifully inlaid box to her chest, Psyche finally allowed herself to smile. She carried Persephone's beauty in there, whatever it was -- the goddess hadn't let Psyche watch her fill the box. Now Psyche could return to Aphrodite and hand it over, and the goddess would finally reunite her with Eros. Wistfully, Psyche laid a hand upon her swollen stomach, remembering how pleased her husband had been when they'd learned that she was pregnant. She might have gotten drunk on his kisses that night, on the slide of his smooth hands over her body. Sweet Eros. She remembered the first, and only, glimpse she'd gotten of him, lifting the lantern over his sleeping form. The force of his beauty had shocked her senseless, and the knife she'd brought along to behead him with had fallen from her fingers, as though it too were overcome with shame at the thought of slicing through his golden skin. Psyche winced, remembering what had happened next. The lantern tipping in her hand. The drop of burning hot wax. And Eros, waking, his face twisted with horror and pain at the sight of her, of what sheOd tried to do to him. Tears prickled in her eyes, and she wiped them away. He'd forgive her. He had to. There was the baby to consider, after all, and surely he wouldn't discount all that she'd suffered for his sake. How many trials and humiliations his mother, Aphrodite, had put her through! How many indignities Psyche had suffered, and she being of noble birth, the most beautiful of mortal women! Of course, her beauty had gotten her into this mess, winning her Aphrodite's spite. But Eros had loved her at first for her beauty, he'd said. For that alone, she couldn't bring herself to hate the Fates who'd made her beautiful. Well, you're certainly not very beautiful now, a voice inside her said. It sounded a bit like Aphrodite's -- no wonder. She'd heard the goddess's spiteful tones so often that it didn't surprise Psyche that they'd insinuated themselves into her head. Ruefully she lifted a hand to her unkempt hair, wishing that the voice weren't quite so accurate. What a sight she must look, barefoot and disheveled, unwashed, in rags, and heavy with pregnancy besides! Eros would probably take one look at her and decide to find a different wife, one who hadn't nearly murdered him in his sleep. And no doubt Aphrodite had planned it that way, Psyche thought, glowering at the box in her hands. The scheming bitch! She'd hated Psyche before she even met her, and all because the human woman had been born nearly as beautiful as she. I'll show her, Psyche thought, pausing mid-step in the middle of the forest path as a new thought came to her. She carried beauty with her, didn't she? She could steal a bit for herself -- not all of it, of course; she'd need something to take back to Aphrodite. But a little bit. Enough to make her beautiful again. Enough to remind Eros why he'd fallen in love with her. Smiling at her own cunning, Psyche opened the box. Sleep wafted up like a ghostly shade, tinged with scent of that Stygian palace: overripe fruit and the hint of something as dark and rich as the veins of gold running through clotting earth. A scent dark and faintly cloying, utterly impossible to ignore. It curled its arms around her neck, touching spectral fingers to her eyelids. Psyche struggled against it in vain, slamming the lid of the box shut against it. Yet it only coiled around her tighter, bearing her down. Psyche didn't realize she'd fallen until she felt the grass beneath her cheek. Warmed by the sun, it felt softer and more inviting than any of the down-filled pillows in Eros's palace. The box slipped from her fingers. Sleep wrapped around her like a blanket. Closing her eyes, she gave herself up to it. In her dreams, Eros came to her, his strong hands cupping her shoulders and the heat of his breath warming her neck as he buried his face in her hair. She inhaled his familiar fragrance, that sweet scent of sun, and sky, and summer fields, mixed with his own heady musk. Intoxicating, that scent. She nuzzled his neck, winding her arms around his strong shoulders. Her fingers brushed something soft and downy on his back, and she gasped, remembering the wings she'd glimpsed in that one, brief flash of lamplight. He'd always kept them hidden from her before. Eros lifted himself up on one elbow and smiled at her, his eyes twinkling with mischief. She'd never seen him smile before, but how well she could imagine it! He reached over his shoulder and plucked one of his own white feathers, and she sighed happily as he touched it to her lips. He drew the feather down her neck, drawing a line between her breasts. She moaned, arching up into the too-light touch. Smiling, he traced the curve of her left breast, drawing an ever-tightening spiral around her nipple. \"Yes,\" she murmured, wanting more. \"You like that, do you?\" The voice was female and dripping with scorn. By now, Psyche knew it as well as she knew her husband's voice. Opening her eyes, Psyche found herself staring up at Aphrodite, whose perfectly-shaped lips curved in spiteful amusement, and whose blue eyes sparkled with some private malice, bright as diamonds, and just as cold. Gasping, Psyche drew back, startled to realize that she really was in bed, one softer and wider than she'd ever seen. A down mattress dipped beneath her weight, and silk sheets clung to her naked skin -- her clothes were missing. Psyche blushed at her nakedness, drawing the sheet up around her. Aphrodite only smirked, managing to make even her malice seem beautiful. In the flickering candlelight, her hair glowed as golden as the many fibulae holding the top edges of her silk chiton up around her white shoulders and down the length of her long, smooth arms. The chiton itself was simpler than any Psyche had seen Aphrodite wear before -- no gold or silver threads, no jewels or pearls, no intricate embroidery. It was fashioned of a pink silk as pale and opalescent as the inside of a seashell, and it made AphroditeOs skin glow against it. A simple gold girdle fastened it around Aphrodite's small waist. She wore no sandals, and no jewelry either, save for the row of golden fibulae holding up her chiton. The simplicity of her garments framed Aphrodite's beauty as her elaborate costumes never did, and Psyche swallowed at the unspoken message that the understated clothing conveyed. Whatever it was that Aphrodite had sent her to borrow from Persephone, it hadn't been beauty. Aphrodite didn't need to borrow that: her loveliness needed no enhancement, no refinement. The wooden box had been another of her traps -- and Psyche had walked right into it of her own accord. Psyche drew back into the pillows, wondering what would happen to her now. Aphrodite lifted the feather she was holding, twirling it idly in the air. \"It's his, you know,\" she said conversationally. \"I plucked it just this morning. I always did love his wings -- they're softer than any bird's, donOt you think? But I suppose you never felt them, did you?\" Psyche shook her head, afraid to speak. Wide-eyed, she glanced around the room, looking for an escape. Aphrodite's bower gleamed with opulence. Sheer silk hangings in creamy pinks and violets hung from the ceiling. Clustered candles shone in the corners, gold-dipped pearls gleaming softly around them, arranged in bowls like grapes. The air smelled of roses, honey, and some fainter, sea-sharp scent that brought a blush to Psyche's cheeks. But she saw no door. With all of the hangings, the exit could be anywhere. Aphrodite tapped the feather against Psyche's lips, drawing her attention back to her. \"You really were a naughty thing,\" she said. \"I told you not to peek inside that box. But you couldn't resist, could you? You had to get some of it for yourself.\" Her eyes narrowed, and she rose from the chair she'd been sitting in, her body shifting smoothly, like a cat's. She climbed onto the bed, and sat on the side of it, crossing her long legs haughtily before her. \"You're vain, greedy, and not nearly as special as you think you are,\" she sneered. \"Why on earth do you think you're worthy of my son?\" \"I... I love him,\" Psyche stammered, clutching the sheet to her chest. Aphrodite's nearness made her nervous. She could see the goddess's nipples beneath her thin silk chiton, the perfect curves of her breasts. A blush came to Psyche's cheeks, and she swallowed, aroused despite herself. Aphrodite drew the feather across her own lips, smiling coldly. \"I know what you were dreaming about,\" she said. \"I donOt know what you mean,\" Psyche said, hugging herself defensively. \"I... I was dreaming about my parents. About playing with my sisters as a girl.\" Aphrodite slapped her sharply across the cheek. \"DonOt lie to me,\" she said. \"I know what Persephone bottles into those sleeps of hers -- she invented them for herself, when sheOs alone for all those lonely months without her husband.\" Psyche tried to control her shock, but the goddess saw through it in a second. \"You're surprised?\" she said. \"I don't blame you. Hades puts most people off. Too much time in the underworld. All those dark mists. All those ghosts whisping around. It's utterly morbid.\" She waved her hand, long fingernails flashing in the sunlight. \"Still,\" she said, \"He's Zeus's brother. He must have inherited some of the family talent. Now the question, my dear,\" she continued, leaning close enough to Psyche that the human woman could smell the sweet fragrance of her hair, \"Is did you?\" \"Did I what?\"E Psyche asked, trying not to look at the long line of thigh the goddess was exposing. The open sides of Aphrodite's chiton fell away from her crossed legs, and Psyche could faintly see the patch of shadow between Aphrodite's thighs. \"Don't play coy with me,\" Aphrodite said. \"Consider this your fifth and final task. This time, I can make sure nobody helps you. I want to see all that you've learned from Eros. I want to see if you're worthy of my son.\" \"You... you mean?\" Psyche stammered, unable to believe her ears. Her heart began pounding even harder. Surely the goddess couldn't expect her toE...E why, they were both women! But Aphrodite nodded, wrinkling her nose in annoyance. \"You've detracted quite a bit of attention from my temples with all your hubris,O she sneered. \"Here's your chance to start making up for it.\" Stretching, she lifted her chin proudly, reaching upward to let the golden curtain of her hair down from its knot. She looked even more beautiful with her hair falling around her shoulders, the too-perfect lines of her face softened by the fragrant curls. \"Worship me,\" she said. Psyche shook her head to clear it, feeling as if she were back in the dream. Surely the goddess couldn't be serious! But Aphrodite was crawling up the bed to sit beside her. Leaning back against the pillows, the goddess looked at her expectantly. Swallowing, Psyche leaned forward, and touched AphroditeOs cheek, still holding the sheet up to cover her own nudity. Blue eyes swept down to watch her hand, like a cat studying its prey, and Psyche bit her lip, unsure what to do. How could two women possibly make love together? Wracking her brain, she tried to think back to her nights with Eros, remembering what he did to her. Eros always kissed her when he came to her at night, but glancing at Aphrodite's sneering lips, Psyche couldn't bring herself to show that much affection to the goddess who'd brought her such torments. She let her hand fall away from Aphrodite's cheek, and reached instead for one of the golden fibulae holding up Aphrodite's chiton. Psyche unfastened the first pin with only a little bit of fumbling. It was difficult to do one-handed. She set the fibula on the night table, trying not to look at the ivory skin revealed by the drooping fabric of Aphrodite's chiton. Biting her lip, Psyche reached for the next pin, slowly pulling it from the silk. This time, the top of the chiton gaped low enough to reveal a perfect breast. PsycheOs cheeks flared hot, and Aphrodite smirked. \"Do you take so long undressing him?\" she asked. \"IOm amazed he puts up with it. He never was a very patient boy.\" \"He comes to me naked,\" Psyche said. Aphrodite shook her head. \"I can see why.\" Sitting up, she pulled the chiton over her head, letting it fall to the floor in a puddle of silk. Her body was so blinding in its beauty that Psyche could only gape for a moment. The sheet sheOd been holding up around her fell free as her hand slackened in shock. She'd seen a hundred statues of Aphrodite, but none of them did the goddess justice. Aphrodite stretched her shoulders slightly, as if covering herself with clothing had been a ridiculous burden that she was glad to be free of. Psyche drank in the sight of her, longing to hold those beautiful breasts in her hand, yet horrified of her own desire. How could she possibly want to touch her cruel mother-in-law like that? Aphrodite laughed at her hesitation. \"Well you certainly are a timid thing,\" she said. \"I can see why he chose you. He always did like to have his own way with everything.\" Her cheeks flaring hot, Psyche leaned forward, extending her hand. She meant to touch her fingers to Aphrodite's breast, but at the last moment, her courage gave way. She touched the collarbone instead, drawing her finger along the jutting length of it. Aphrodite rolled her eyes. Glaring at her, Psyche felt her uncertainty momentarily unsettled by hatred. She did reach for the goddess's breast, squeezing it hard enough to hurt. \"Is that better?\" she asked. Aphrodite stretched languidly, as though Psyche didn't have her breast in one hand. \"Watch yourself, human,\" she said. \"You're entirely too cocky. Do you think that sleeping with a god makes you worthy to be one of us?\" \"You're jealous,\" Psyche breathed, realizing the words even as she spoke them. Her hand fell from Aphrodite's breast, landing in her own lap. Aphrodite's eyes flashed. \"Of you? Hardly. You, my dear, are a summer's day. Your beauty will peak with noon and die with the setting sun. Time takes all your kind in the end. I am summer eternal,\" she said, shaking her hair. \"I'll still be lovely when you're rotting in the grave.\" \"No,\" Psyche said, gaining confidence as she spoke. She'd touched a nerve, and that was something. Better that than unpenatrable boredom. \"Not of my beauty. You're jealous of me for having him. It must be hard, isn't it? He's the most beautiful god in all Olympus, and the only one that you can't touch.\" \"You don't know what you're talking about. He's my son!\" \"Oh yes,\" Psyche said. \"I saw the statues. He was such a chubby little thing. IOll bet you were surprised when he grew up to look like he did.\" And lowering her voice, she leaned forward, breathing into Aphrodite's ear, \"And he did inherit the family talent.\" She flicked out her tongue, tracing the curve of the goddess's ear, and felt relieved to see Aphrodite's chest rise briefly at the touch. \"You nursed him, didn't you?\" she asked, and Aphrodite nodded, breathing heavily. Psyche squeezed her full breasts, kneading them back and forth. \"He loves my breasts,\" she said. \"He won't take his mouth off them.\" She flicked her tongue against one of Aphrodite's nipples, licking around it slowly as she tweaked its twin with her fingers. Some of the malice had left the goddess's eyes; she watched Psyche expectantly, her chest rising and falling with her breath. Psyche planted a slow kiss on the tip of Aphrodite's nipple, and pulled away, refusing to suck on it just yet. Eros sometimes buried his face between Psyche's breasts, so she did that, breathing in the honey-sweet fragrance of the goddess's skin. \"Sometimes,\" she whispered, pulling back slowly, \"he likes to make love to me there.\" She placed two fingers between Aphrodite's breasts, rubbing them back and forth to demonstrate, and the goddess drew in a breath. \"He comes on them,\" Psyche whispered, \"and then he licks it off.\" And she ran her tongue down the curve of Aphrodite's full breast, lapping it slowly, as Eros did to her. Psyche lifted her head, doing her best to mirror the mischievous smile Eros had shown her in her dream. She must have done it right -- Aphrodite breathed in sharply, her eyes widening a bit with disbelief. Still smiling, Psyche ducked her head and fastened her mouth over the goddess's nipple. Aphrodite cried out, and her hands tangled in PsycheOs hair. Psyche sucked the nipple slowly, kneading her other breast with her hand. Her free hand stroked its way down Aphrodite's side, sliding over her flank and the curve of her hip. Psyche curled her hand around the jutting hipbone, trying not to think of what lay between the goddess's smooth thighs. Gathering her courage, she slid her hand over Aphrodite's hip. Her fingers encountered the soft patch of pubic hair, nearly as lush and thick as the golden tresses on the goddess's head, and Psyche swallowed. Tentatively, she ran a finger down that soft valley, drawing it into the clefts between the goddess's downy lips. Aphrodite was wet there. Feeling a bit more confidant, Psyche explored that moist valley. At the deepest patch of wetness, she pushed in, relieved to feel her finger sliding inside. Aphrodite arched up against her hand, moaning. Swallowing, Psyche added another finger, curving up, searching for that spot that Eros always found. There. Aphrodite bucked beneath her hand and gasped, tossing her head back onto the pillow. Psyche curled her fingers again, and then again, stroking that spot as hard as she could. \"He loves to fuck me,\" she whispered. \"He starts off slow, and then he speeds up, moving back and forth inside me.\" She echoed the words with her fingers as she spoke, and Aphrodite rocked back against her, her hips moving in the rhythm of the sea. With her thumb, Psyche explored the skin between the goddess's inner lips, searching for the little nub she'd discovered between her own legs as a girl. Her thumb brushed over it, and Aphrodite cried out, her eyes drifting shut in pleasure. Moistening her thumb with some of the AphroditeOs own juices, Psyche rubbed it in a circular motion, still pressing her fingers in and out of the goddess. Aphrodite moaned, and started trembling beneath Psyche's hands. Psyche stroked her until the last of the tremors ran its course. Pulling her hand free, she studied the clear liquid coating her fingers. She sniffed it curiously, finally identifying the sea-sharp scent pervading the room. As Aphrodite watched with languid eyes, Psyche brought the hand to her mouth. She imagined that it tasted as pearls might taste, if they were melted in moonlight into this glistening potion. Aphrodite smiled, with none of her usual scorn. Sitting up, she tipped Psyche back against the mattress, spreading her legs apart with her hands. Psyche only had time to gasp before Aphrodite's face disappeared between her legs. Now she knew where Eros had inherited that clever tongue of his from! Aphrodite had her moaning and shaking within minutes. Closing her eyes, Psyche gave herself up to pleasure. When the last of the tremors eased, she opened her eyes to find Aphrodite leaning over her, a thoughtful look on her face. \"Congratulations,\" Aphrodite said. \"You've passed.\" Psyche blinked, her head only just beginning to clear. \"You mean...?\" Aphrodite nodded. \"I consent to your marriage,\" she said. \"I'll have Zeus himself declare your union.\" \"Oh, thank you!\" Psyche breathed, forgetting, for a moment, all of the trials that Aphrodite had put her through within the last few days. She threw her arms around the goddess. Aphrodite chuckled, and patted her head. \"You thank me now,\" Aphrodite said. \"You just wait. He's been driving me crazy with his whining and moping these last few days. Soon enough, you'll be begging me to take him off your hands.\" She glanced at Psyche calculatingly, and drew a finger down her spine. \"Or to take you off his,\" she added. Psyche blushed, glancing down at the sheets. \"What would he say if he knew?\" she asked. \"About us?\" Aphrodite smirked. \"Why don't you tell him and see?\" she said. \"I think he'd find the thought of it intriguing.\" \"Really?\" Psyche felt her eyes widen. Aphrodite smirked. \"Surely you don't think it's a coincidence he chose you,\" she said. \"Boys like girls who resemble their mothers, and out of all the women and goddesses in the world, only you could rival me.\" Psyche felt herself blush. Surely the goddess had to be joking! Yet the rules were different for immortals, Psyche knew. Zeus was married to his sister, after all, and it was no secret that Aphrodite slept with her husband's brother, Ares. Incest didnOt seem to matter much to the gods. Perhaps Eros did secretly lust for his mother, just as Aphrodite seemed to yearn for him. Psyche shook her head to clear it, knowing that she should be shocked and offended. Yet... perhaps when one slept with the gods, one ought to do as the gods themselves did. Touching a hand to her stomach, Psyche smiled. She was married to a god, she had slept with a goddess, and soon, she would be bearing an immortal herself. And since Aphrodite seemed to have forgiven her, who knew? Perhaps in time she could convince Eros to feed her nectar and ambrosia and burn away her own mortality. It might be hubris to consider it, but hubris had led her into Eros's bed, and into the bed of his mother. Perhaps there was something to be said for hubris after all. Psyche wasn't a goddess -- not yet, at least -- but the rules were different for immortals, and she might as well start learning them now. Cuddling close to Aphrodite, Psyche kissed her once, quickly. \"You know,\" she said. \"I might just ask you to do that.\" And into the goddess's ear, she breathed, \"Perhaps one day we'll truly share him.\" Aphrodite inhaled sharply. Rolling over, she pressed Psyche back down to the mattress. Psyche smiled, wrapping her arms around the goddess as Aphrodite covered her with kisses. Perhaps, she thought, she'd write a thank you note to Persephone. The little box hadn't done much for her beauty, but it had given her more than she ever thought she'd have. Finis.",

      "She inhaled his familiar fragrance, that sweet scent of sun, and sky, and summer fields, mixed with his own heady musk.",
      "Intoxicating, that scent.",
      "She nuzzled his neck, winding her arms around his strong shoulders.",
      "Her fingers brushed something soft and downy on his back, and she gasped, remembering the wings she'd glimpsed in that one, brief flash of lamplight.",
      "He'd always kept them hidden from her before.",
      "Eros lifted himself up on one elbow and smiled at her, his eyes twinkling with mischief.",
      "She'd never seen him smile before, but how well she could imagine it!",
      "He reached over his shoulder and plucked one of his own white feathers, and she sighed happily as he touched it to her lips.",
      "He drew the feather down her neck, drawing a line between her breasts.",
      "She moaned, arching up into the too-light touch.",
      "Smiling, he traced the curve of her left breast, drawing an ever-tightening spiral around her nipple.",
      "\"Yes,\" she murmured, wanting more.",
      "\"You like that, do you?\"",
      "The voice was female and dripping with scorn.",
      "By now, Psyche knew it as well as she knew her husband's voice.",
      "Opening her eyes, Psyche found herself staring up at Aphrodite, whose perfectly-shaped lips curved in spiteful amusement, and whose blue eyes sparkled with some private malice, bright as diamonds, and just as cold.",
      "Gasping, Psyche drew back, startled to realize that she really was in bed, one softer and wider than she'd ever seen.",
      "A down mattress dipped beneath her weight, and silk sheets clung to her naked skin -- her clothes were missing.",
      "Psyche blushed at her nakedness, drawing the sheet up around her.",
      "Aphrodite only smirked, managing to make even her malice seem beautiful.",
      "In the flickering candlelight, her hair glowed as golden as the many fibulae holding the top edges of her silk chiton up around her white shoulders and down the length of her long, smooth arms.",
      "The chiton itself was simpler than any Psyche had seen Aphrodite wear before -- no gold or silver threads, no jewels or pearls, no intricate embroidery.",
      "It was fashioned of a pink silk as pale and opalescent as the inside of a seashell, and it made AphroditeOs skin glow against it.",
      "A simple gold girdle fastened it around Aphrodite's small waist.",
      "She wore no sandals, and no jewelry either, save for the row of golden fibulae holding up her chiton.",
      "The simplicity of her garments framed Aphrodite's beauty as her elaborate costumes never did, and Psyche swallowed at the unspoken message that the understated clothing conveyed.",
      "Whatever it was that Aphrodite had sent her to borrow from Persephone, it hadn't been beauty.",
      "Aphrodite didn't need to borrow that: her loveliness needed no enhancement, no refinement.",
      "The wooden box had been another of her traps -- and Psyche had walked right into it of her own accord.",
      "Psyche drew back into the pillows, wondering what would happen to her now.",
      "Aphrodite lifted the feather she was holding, twirling it idly in the air.",
      "\"It's his, you know,\" she said conversationally.",
      "\"I plucked it just this morning.",
      "I always did love his wings -- they're softer than any bird's, donOt you think?",
      "But I suppose you never felt them, did you?\" Psyche shook her head, afraid to speak.",
      "Wide-eyed, she glanced around the room, looking for an escape.",
      "Aphrodite's bower gleamed with opulence.",
      "Sheer silk hangings in creamy pinks and violets hung from the ceiling.",
      "Clustered candles shone in the corners, gold-dipped pearls gleaming softly around them, arranged in bowls like grapes.",
      "The air smelled of roses, honey, and some fainter, sea-sharp scent that brought a blush to Psyche's cheeks.",
      "But she saw no door.",
      "With all of the hangings, the exit could be anywhere.",
      "Aphrodite tapped the feather against Psyche's lips, drawing her attention back to her.",
      "\"You really were a naughty thing,\" she said.",
      "\"I told you not to peek inside that box.",
      "But you couldn't resist, could you?",
      "You had to get some of it for yourself.\"",
      "Her eyes narrowed, and she rose from the chair she'd been sitting in, her body shifting smoothly, like a cat's.",
      "She climbed onto the bed, and sat on the side of it, crossing her long legs haughtily before her.",
      "\"You're vain, greedy, and not nearly as special as you think you are,\" she sneered.",
      "\"Why on earth do you think you're worthy of my son?\"",
      "\"I... I love him,\" Psyche stammered, clutching the sheet to her chest.",
      "Aphrodite's nearness made her nervous.",
      "She could see the goddess's nipples beneath her thin silk chiton, the perfect curves of her breasts.",
      "A blush came to Psyche's cheeks, and she swallowed, aroused despite herself.",
      "Aphrodite drew the feather across her own lips, smiling coldly.",
      "\"I know what you were dreaming about,\" she said.",
      "\"I donOt know what you mean,\" Psyche said, hugging herself defensively.",
      "\"I...",
      "I was dreaming about my parents.",
      "About playing with my sisters as a girl.\"",
      "Aphrodite slapped her sharply across the cheek.",
      "\"DonOt lie to me,\" she said.",
      "\"I know what Persephone bottles into those sleeps of hers -- she invented them for herself, when sheOs alone for all those lonely months without her husband.\"",
      "Psyche tried to control her shock, but the goddess saw through it in a second.",
      "\"You're surprised?\" she said.",
      "\"I don't blame you.",
      "Hades puts most people off.",
      "Too much time in the underworld.",
      "All those dark mists.",
      "All those ghosts whisping around.",
      "It's utterly morbid.\"",
      "She waved her hand, long fingernails flashing in the sunlight.",
      "\"Still,\" she said, \"He's Zeus's brother.",
      "He must have inherited some of the family talent.",
      "Now the question, my dear,\" she continued, leaning close enough to Psyche that the human woman could smell the sweet fragrance of her hair, \"Is did you?\"",
      "\"Did I what?\"E Psyche asked, trying not to look at the long line of thigh the goddess was exposing.",
      "The open sides of Aphrodite's chiton fell away from her crossed legs, and Psyche could faintly see the patch of shadow between Aphrodite's thighs.",
      "\"Don't play coy with me,\" Aphrodite said.",
      "\"Consider this your fifth and final task.",
      "This time, I can make sure nobody helps you.",
      "I want to see all that you've learned from Eros.",
      "I want to see if you're worthy of my son.\"",
      "\"You... you mean?\" Psyche stammered, unable to believe her ears.",
      "Her heart began pounding even harder.",
      "Surely the goddess couldn't expect her toE...E why, they were both women!",
      "But Aphrodite nodded, wrinkling her nose in annoyance.",
      "\"You've detracted quite a bit of attention from my temples with all your hubris,O she sneered.",
      "\"Here's your chance to start making up for it.\"",
      "Stretching, she lifted her chin proudly, reaching upward to let the golden curtain of her hair down from its knot.",
      "She looked even more beautiful with her hair falling around her shoulders, the too-perfect lines of her face softened by the fragrant curls.",
      "\"Worship me,\" she said.",
      "Psyche shook her head to clear it, feeling as if she were back in the dream.",
      "Surely the goddess couldn't be serious!",
      "But Aphrodite was crawling up the bed to sit beside her.",
      "Leaning back against the pillows, the goddess looked at her expectantly.",
      "Swallowing, Psyche leaned forward, and touched AphroditeOs cheek, still holding the sheet up to cover her own nudity.",
      "Blue eyes swept down to watch her hand, like a cat studying its prey, and Psyche bit her lip, unsure what to do.",
      "How could two women possibly make love together?",
      "Wracking her brain, she tried to think back to her nights with Eros, remembering what he did to her.",
      "Eros always kissed her when he came to her at night, but glancing at Aphrodite's sneering lips, Psyche couldn't bring herself to show that much affection to the goddess who'd brought her such torments.",
      "She let her hand fall away from Aphrodite's cheek, and reached instead for one of the golden fibulae holding up Aphrodite's chiton.",
      "Psyche unfastened the first pin with only a little bit of fumbling.",
      "It was difficult to do one-handed.",
      "She set the fibula on the night table, trying not to look at the ivory skin revealed by the drooping fabric of Aphrodite's chiton.",
      "Biting her lip, Psyche reached for the next pin, slowly pulling it from the silk.",
      "This time, the top of the chiton gaped low enough to reveal a perfect breast.",
      "PsycheOs cheeks flared hot, and Aphrodite smirked.",
      "\"Do you take so long undressing him?\" she asked.",
      "\"IOm amazed he puts up with it.",
      "He never was a very patient boy.\"",
      "\"He comes to me naked,\" Psyche said.",
      "Aphrodite shook her head.",
      "\"I can see why.\"",
      "Sitting up, she pulled the chiton over her head, letting it fall to the floor in a puddle of silk.",
      "Her body was so blinding in its beauty that Psyche could only gape for a moment.",
      "The sheet sheOd been holding up around her fell free as her hand slackened in shock.",
      "She'd seen a hundred statues of Aphrodite, but none of them did the goddess justice.",
      "Aphrodite stretched her shoulders slightly, as if covering herself with clothing had been a ridiculous burden that she was glad to be free of.",
      "Psyche drank in the sight of her, longing to hold those beautiful breasts in her hand, yet horrified of her own desire.",
      "How could she possibly want to touch her cruel mother-in-law like that?",
      "Aphrodite laughed at her hesitation.",
      "\"Well you certainly are a timid thing,\" she said.",
      "\"I can see why he chose you.",
      "He always did like to have his own way with everything.\"",
      "Her cheeks flaring hot, Psyche leaned forward, extending her hand.",
      "She meant to touch her fingers to Aphrodite's breast, but at the last moment, her courage gave way.",
      "She touched the collarbone instead, drawing her finger along the jutting length of it.",
      "Aphrodite rolled her eyes.",
      "Glaring at her, Psyche felt her uncertainty momentarily unsettled by hatred.",
      "She did reach for the goddess's breast, squeezing it hard enough to hurt.",
      "\"Is that better?\" she asked.",
      "Aphrodite stretched languidly, as though Psyche didn't have her breast in one hand.",
      "\"Watch yourself, human,\" she said.",
      "\"You're entirely too cocky.",
      "Do you think that sleeping with a god makes you worthy to be one of us?\"",
      "\"You're jealous,\" Psyche breathed, realizing the words even as she spoke them.",
      "Her hand fell from Aphrodite's breast, landing in her own lap.",
      "Aphrodite's eyes flashed.",
      "\"Of you?",
      "Hardly.",
      "You, my dear, are a summer's day.",
      "Your beauty will peak with noon and die with the setting sun.",
      "Time takes all your kind in the end.",
      "I am summer eternal,\" she said, shaking her hair.",
      "\"I'll still be lovely when you're rotting in the grave.\"",
      "\"No,\" Psyche said, gaining confidence as she spoke.",
      "She'd touched a nerve, and that was something.",
      "Better that than unpenatrable boredom.",
      "\"Not of my beauty.",
      "You're jealous of me for having him.",
      "It must be hard, isn't it?",
      "He's the most beautiful god in all Olympus, and the only one that you can't touch.\"",
      "\"You don't know what you're talking about.",
      "He's my son!\"",
      "\"Oh yes,\" Psyche said.",
      "\"I saw the statues.",
      "He was such a chubby little thing.",
      "IOll bet you were surprised when he grew up to look like he did.\"",
      "And lowering her voice, she leaned forward, breathing into Aphrodite's ear, \"And he did inherit the family talent.\"",
      "She flicked out her tongue, tracing the curve of the goddess's ear, and felt relieved to see Aphrodite's chest rise briefly at the touch.",
      "\"You nursed him, didn't you?\" she asked, and Aphrodite nodded, breathing heavily.",
      "Psyche squeezed her full breasts, kneading them back and forth.",
      "\"He loves my breasts,\" she said.",
      "\"He won't take his mouth off them.\"",
      "She flicked her tongue against one of Aphrodite's nipples, licking around it slowly as she tweaked its twin with her fingers.",
      "Some of the malice had left the goddess's eyes; she watched Psyche expectantly, her chest rising and falling with her breath.",
      "Psyche planted a slow kiss on the tip of Aphrodite's nipple, and pulled away, refusing to suck on it just yet.",
      "Eros sometimes buried his face between Psyche's breasts, so she did that, breathing in the honey-sweet fragrance of the goddess's skin.",
      "\"Sometimes,\" she whispered, pulling back slowly, \"he likes to make love to me there.\"",
      "She placed two fingers between Aphrodite's breasts, rubbing them back and forth to demonstrate, and the goddess drew in a breath.",
      "\"He comes on them,\" Psyche whispered, \"and then he licks it off.\"",
      "And she ran her tongue down the curve of Aphrodite's full breast, lapping it slowly, as Eros did to her.",
      "Psyche lifted her head, doing her best to mirror the mischievous smile Eros had shown her in her dream.",
      "She must have done it right -- Aphrodite breathed in sharply, her eyes widening a bit with disbelief.",
      "Still smiling, Psyche ducked her head and fastened her mouth over the goddess's nipple.",
      "Aphrodite cried out, and her hands tangled in PsycheOs hair.",
      "Psyche sucked the nipple slowly, kneading her other breast with her hand.",
      "Her free hand stroked its way down Aphrodite's side, sliding over her flank and the curve of her hip.",
      "Psyche curled her hand around the jutting hipbone, trying not to think of what lay between the goddess's smooth thighs.",
      "Gathering her courage, she slid her hand over Aphrodite's hip.",
      "Her fingers encountered the soft patch of pubic hair, nearly as lush and thick as the golden tresses on the goddess's head, and Psyche swallowed.",
      "Tentatively, she ran a finger down that soft valley, drawing it into the clefts between the goddess's downy lips.",
      "Aphrodite was wet there.",
      "Feeling a bit more confidant, Psyche explored that moist valley.",
      "At the deepest patch of wetness, she pushed in, relieved to feel her finger sliding inside.",
      "Aphrodite arched up against her hand, moaning.",
      "Swallowing, Psyche added another finger, curving up, searching for that spot that Eros always found.",
      "There.",
      "Aphrodite bucked beneath her hand and gasped, tossing her head back onto the pillow.",
      "Psyche curled her fingers again, and then again, stroking that spot as hard as she could.",
      "\"He loves to fuck me,\" she whispered.",
      "\"He starts off slow, and then he speeds up, moving back and forth inside me.\"",
      "She echoed the words with her fingers as she spoke, and Aphrodite rocked back against her, her hips moving in the rhythm of the sea.",
      "With her thumb, Psyche explored the skin between the goddess's inner lips, searching for the little nub she'd discovered between her own legs as a girl.",
      "Her thumb brushed over it, and Aphrodite cried out, her eyes drifting shut in pleasure.",
      "Moistening her thumb with some of the AphroditeOs own juices, Psyche rubbed it in a circular motion, still pressing her fingers in and out of the goddess.",
      "Aphrodite moaned, and started trembling beneath Psyche's hands.",
      "Psyche stroked her until the last of the tremors ran its course.",
      "Pulling her hand free, she studied the clear liquid coating her fingers.",
      "She sniffed it curiously, finally identifying the sea-sharp scent pervading the room.",
      "As Aphrodite watched with languid eyes, Psyche brought the hand to her mouth.",
      "She imagined that it tasted as pearls might taste, if they were melted in moonlight into this glistening potion.",
      "Aphrodite smiled, with none of her usual scorn.",
      "Sitting up, she tipped Psyche back against the mattress, spreading her legs apart with her hands.",
      "Psyche only had time to gasp before Aphrodite's face disappeared between her legs.",
      "Now she knew where Eros had inherited that clever tongue of his from!",
      "Aphrodite had her moaning and shaking within minutes.",
      "Closing her eyes, Psyche gave herself up to pleasure.",
      "When the last of the tremors eased, she opened her eyes to find Aphrodite leaning over her, a thoughtful look on her face.",
      "\"Congratulations,\" Aphrodite said.",
      "\"You've passed.\"",
      "Psyche blinked, her head only just beginning to clear.",
      "\"You mean...?\" Aphrodite nodded.",
      "\"I consent to your marriage,\" she said.",
      "\"I'll have Zeus himself declare your union.\"",
      "\"Oh, thank you!\"",
      "Psyche breathed, forgetting, for a moment, all of the trials that Aphrodite had put her through within the last few days.",
      "She threw her arms around the goddess.",
      "Aphrodite chuckled, and patted her head.",
      "\"You thank me now,\" Aphrodite said.",
      "\"You just wait.",
      "He's been driving me crazy with his whining and moping these last few days.",
      "Soon enough, you'll be begging me to take him off your hands.\"",
      "She glanced at Psyche calculatingly, and drew a finger down her spine.",
      "\"Or to take you off his,\" she added.",
      "Psyche blushed, glancing down at the sheets.",
      "\"What would he say if he knew?\" she asked.",
      "\"About us?\" Aphrodite smirked.",
      "\"Why don't you tell him and see?\" she said.",
      "\"I think he'd find the thought of it intriguing.\"",
      "\"Really?\" Psyche felt her eyes widen.",
      "Aphrodite smirked.",
      "\"Surely you don't think it's a coincidence he chose you,\" she said.",
      "\"Boys like girls who resemble their mothers, and out of all the women and goddesses in the world, only you could rival me.\"",
      "Psyche felt herself blush.",
      "Surely the goddess had to be joking!",
      "Yet the rules were different for immortals, Psyche knew.",
      "Zeus was married to his sister, after all, and it was no secret that Aphrodite slept with her husband's brother, Ares.",
      "Incest didnOt seem to matter much to the gods.",
      "Perhaps Eros did secretly lust for his mother, just as Aphrodite seemed to yearn for him.",
      "Psyche shook her head to clear it, knowing that she should be shocked and offended.",
      "Yet... perhaps when one slept with the gods, one ought to do as the gods themselves did.",
      "Touching a hand to her stomach, Psyche smiled.",
      "She was married to a god, she had slept with a goddess, and soon, she would be bearing an immortal herself.",
      "And since Aphrodite seemed to have forgiven her, who knew?",
      "Perhaps in time she could convince Eros to feed her nectar and ambrosia and burn away her own mortality.",
      "It might be hubris to consider it, but hubris had led her into Eros's bed, and into the bed of his mother.",
      "Perhaps there was something to be said for hubris after all.",
      "Psyche wasn't a goddess -- not yet, at least -- but the rules were different for immortals, and she might as well start learning them now.",
      "Cuddling close to Aphrodite, Psyche kissed her once, quickly.",
      "\"You know,\" she said.",
      "\"I might just ask you to do that.\"",
      "And into the goddess's ear, she breathed, \"Perhaps one day we'll truly share him.\"",
      "Aphrodite inhaled sharply.",
      "Rolling over, she pressed Psyche back down to the mattress.",
      "Psyche smiled, wrapping her arms around the goddess as Aphrodite covered her with kisses.",
      "Perhaps, she thought, she'd write a thank you note to Persephone.",
      "The little box hadn't done much for her beauty, but it had given her more than she ever thought she'd have.",
      "Finis."

    "text": "I. Maia Among your earliest memories is seeing your father chained, condemned to hold up the heavens for his part in the Titans' battle against the new gods. You take it to heart as an early lesson in not standing out, and you grow shy, quiet, serious. Your sisters, too young to remember, are wilder and bolder; you're the one helping your mother keep your family together. When word spreads that a new Huntress Goddess is looking for maiden companions, Pleione takes you and your sisters to join up. You are content. You have your life. You have your sisters. It suffices. *** Quiet, caring, responsible. These are the words used to describe you, and they're probably right. Your reputation spreads as one who is kindhearted and trustworthy, and before you know it you've gone from simply helping dissuade Alcyone from keeping baby birds and talk Merope through ridiculous crushes on mortals to being a confidante and shoulder to cry on for most of the younger girls in Artemis's train. You appreciate it for the most part, though it frustrates you to get mixed up in their drama. You manage to keep mostly to the sidelines (as will be echoed in later life). *** Eventually you chafe at your position. You are young, and foolish as the young so often are. You dream, and you grow restless. Quiet, caring, responsible sounds so tedious. You say you have fallen in love with the Arcadian countryside. You say you want space to yourself, and your reputation for shyness makes it believable. (Neither are untrue, but it is more a secret desire for rebellion that motivates you.) You receive permission to strike out on your own. You are not built for rebellion, it turns out; your ideas of daring are laughable. But, thankfully, independence does suit you. II. Zeus Unaccustomed to having any visitors at your isolated dwelling on Mount Cyllene, you're understandably shocked when you find an Olympian, and the King of Gods besides, at your door. You rather trip all over yourself trying to show him due hospitality, you sheepishly recall. But he hardly even seems to notice. He is charming, and calls you beautiful - and, though you've heard it before, you can't help believing it when he says it. You let yourself be flattered, for you are young, and foolish as the young so often are, and a night of passion seems worth any price. *** It is only later that you regret. Later that you realize your naivety. Later, when your body swells with child and the weight of your solitude seems greater than ever. You curse yourself for a flattered fool, but then recognize that other truth: refusal was never an option. Better that you were awed. Everything considered, you know you were lucky. You've heard that stories - as who hasn't? - of Leto, of Alcmene, of Semele. You don't feel lucky, though. You feel lost, aching, and alone. You're just a girl, in a world that seems far too big for you. *** Life changes, whether you will it or no. You can't go home again. Ironic, then, that it's now you wish more than you ever have for your old home. You long for the comfort of your mother, your sisters, the other maidens of Artemis's company who had become as good as family. But you have given up that life, irrevocably now, and you accept that. You will endure on your own. So you curl into yourself in the darkness of your cave, and sing yourself and your unborn child to sleep with a tune you used to sing your sisters. III. Hermes You are awakened abruptly. You immediately recognize Artemis's twin, but you have no idea why an irate Apollo is in your home. You still don't understand after his tirade, something about stolen cows that confuses you even more after you realize his accusations are directed at the newborn who lies beside you in his swaddling bands. You hold the infant to you protectively and, calmly as you can, point out the sheer impossibility of the accusations. Except little Hermes starts arguing with him, and you can only stare in disbelief and wonder how far in over your head you are. *** When your son is finished with Apollo, he has convinced the sun god to let him keep the cattle - in exchange for an instrument he just invented. Shortly after, Hermes wins himself a place among the Olympians, and the position of Herald of the Gods. His precipitous rise simultaneously pleases and saddens you. You are proud, of course you are proud. But... They say all children grow too fast, but he has never needed you from the first. You can see nothing of yourself in the charming trickster, and know you will never understand this strange divine child of yours. IV. Arcas You settle into the quiet patterns of your life once again, finding it changed just slightly. You still live in solitude for the most part. But you are no longer unknown as you were, and there is a certain respect for you as mother of a god. You have visitors more often - some you'd never dreamed to meet, for you're acquainted with many of the Olympians now (though you've never had occasion to meet Hera, and rather hope it remains that way). And your son comes by fairly frequently, bringing you all the news from Olympus and the wide world. *** Your favorite times are when Hermes comes by with fantastic tales of what he's been up to. One day it is releasing a young woman transformed into a heifer from the hundred-eyed giant guarding her. Another time it's guiding a hero back from a venture to the underworld, and another, helping a different hero - Athena's latest favorite, and from the reports you've been hearing of his ingenuity and valor, you can see why - and his men resist a sorceress. Then one day he shows up not with stories but with an infant and a request for a favor from Zeus. *** Arcas, the child's name is. His mother, Callisto, is unable to care for him (having fallen afoul of Hera and Artemis, through no fault of her own). You don't even wait for the end of the explanation before agreeing to raise him as your own. After all, you feel better when you can be of use, and it's been too long since you had anyone to care for. You were made for motherhood; it'll be nice to raise a child who actually needs your care. Much as you love Hermes, there never was a child born who took less mothering. V. The Pleiades One night you dream a flock of seven grey doves have roosted in the orchard outside your cave. There are no birds around when you wake - but there is a dark-haired, grave-faced goddess come to see you. You invite Artemis in politely, even as your heart is racing. It's your sisters, she says, and your mother. So sorry. You force yourself to listen as she tells of the man who pursued them. He's been dealt with - her feral smile makes you shiver - but there was only one way to spare them. You understand. You wish you didn't. *** You try to make sense of the whirlwind of emotions that hits you. There's fear - it could have been you; it was only chance that you left them, and you've wished many times to be back. There's anger. Couldn't they have just submitted? At least then they'd be here today. But you know that's terrible, and you feel ashamed as soon as the thought registers. And then, just honest sorrow. You recall your dream, and know it will not happen; their bestial brains will not know you to find you. They might as well be gone from this life. *** You square your shoulders, dry your tears. You always feel better with a purpose, and a sad task remains to you. You prepare for one of your periodic visits to Atlas; your father deserves to hear this from you. It's not an easy visit, but it's soothing to share your grief, and you remain until the sky is strewn with stars. Looking up, your gaze unerringly finds the bright forms of the boy you loved as your own and his true mother. An idea occurs. You go as supplicant to the King of Gods. Your turn to ask a favor. *** Seven new stars shine in the heavens that night. Their light seems to reach out to you. You feel more alone than ever. Someday you will join them; that assurance also you have received, for though your lifespan is long, it is not limitless. It's scant comfort, but it's something. Until then... All beings have their share of sorrow. You will carry yours. You've stood on your own for many years now. You will continue to do so. You have yourself. You have your life. You have your purpose, such as it is. You will remember your sisters. It suffices.",
