Her mouth tastes of vomit and her breath is coming in deep, sobbing gasps, not quiet, proper tears but a death-rattle, shaking her body as she struggles to draw in air. The scratch of sandaled feet on stone; she squeezes her eyes shut. \"Forgive me,\" she shudders. \"There is nothing to forgive.\" She doesn't need to look to know those unnaturally silver eyes are fixed on her. Fabric rustles and she hears the clink of a spear laid to rest beside her. \"He--\" and her voice cracks at the absurdity of it all. The embodiment of the ocean, fierce and deep and unimaginably vast, and yet the method he chose was so very, very human. \"He defiled me.\" \"He defiled this temple,\" the voice snaps out like a whip and she flinches. A hand against her head brushes back the long strands of her hair. \"Nothing he could do would defile you.\" She can't hold back the fresh flood of tears, hot and burning her eyes. \"He praised me for my hair.\" Her soft, curling hair, that she keeps so long because despite everything, she never feels as pretty as her sisters. The hand goes rigid. \"My uncle,\" an acknowledgement of failure in those words, \"has never been very good at keeping his hands to himself.\" She opens her eyes and delicate, calloused fingers trace tear-tracks down her face. There is terrible understanding in those eyes. \"I'm tired of being afraid,\" she whispers. \"Never again.\" Gentle hands cup her cheeks and the goddess presses a kiss against her forehead. \"Never again will you have to be afraid.\" Squirming, wriggling sensation and her hair thickens. Her skirt twines around her, rippling into scaled hide, bones and muscle merging and lengthening into deadly coils. A little hissing chorus sings in her ears, a wordless promise of protection. Those silver eyes hold hers as the goddess pulls her upright and she can feel them fixing, scaling over, tearless now and ever-watchful. Athena smiles, an uncertain expression that makes her look like the girl she has never been. \"And all who look upon her are turned to stone.\" A serpent's tongue flicks across her cheek and she smiles back.",

    "text": "Achilles has been waiting for a short eternity when Patroclus finally arrives, and he is so much better than the shade he has become in Achilles' memories, even though he is now a shade, Achilles fancies he can still see a flush in his lover's cheeks, maybe if he listens hard enough there will be a heartbeat battling beneath Patroclus' - his Patroclus - ribcage, thrumming out Achilles' own name. For a moment, after stepping on the shore that only the dead can touch, strong, brown legs wobbling slightly, Patroclus doesn't see him. He looks confused, lost and scared, and Achilles knows he has a right to do so, because this is Hades and there is no light here, which makes up the beauty of Patroclus' soul. Then - then Patroclus sees him, and Achilles feels himself become the moon, and the attention of the wandering dead who never approach shifts from himself to Patroclus, who has just become the sun in this place of darkness and silence. Patroclus' eyes shine copper, and his lips stretch back, and oh, he still has a chip on his canine and a mole by his mouth and his hair is a shining ebony, blue, black and an abundance of freckles almost as mahogany as the colour of his skin are peppered over his nose and cheeks, and for one, blissful moment that Achilles could and would and will spend an eternal lifetime remembering, Patroclus sees him and makes toward him, as Achilles does toward Patroclus, and they reach for each other's hands- And then, it is over. (-the sun and the moon's orbits never cross, and all Achilles had just experienced was the eclipse, the pretence of acknowledgement or of being one whole being for even a sliver of a second-) Patroclus' glowing eyes gloss over, and suddenly, his eyes are still looking at Achilles' face but he is not seeing anymore, his freckles are bleaching from his skin and the muscle drops away from his frame, his shoulders hunch a little, like there is no point in wasting effort in standing straight (Posture! Posture shows the men what kind of man you are! Chiron's age old teachings turning to smoke memories), his arm, which had just seconds before been straining for Achilles' own, drops to his side quite suddenly, for suddenly the spirit realises it doesn't know what it is reaching for, and now, unlike seconds before, there is no flush anywhere on his body, just a deathly pallor that makes even the palest parts of Achilles look pink and rosy. Achilles is frozen. He stands, arm still outstretched but he daren't take another step, the transformation that had just occurred before him making his godly blood run cold (oh, that must be the cause of this, he does not deserve you, the slurs coming from his mother's divine lips, and he remembers the shaking of her head and the sharpness of her eyes, and she must have known, she must of, he is a mortal and you do not have an eternity, her warnings ignored for his all important, all encompassing war), before he shudders and moves to a neutral position. Perhaps, the worst thing about being dead is the inability to cry, because right now he doesn't know what else to do. He had heard tales, of course, about mortals forgetting themselves once they crossed the River Styx, but he had never dreamed that it could happen to him and Patroclus, for, the spirits around him, they- His blood runs cold as he realises he hasn't spoken to any of them at all, so focused and desperate for Patroclus (he remembers, bitterly, what he had been wishing for in his eternity, eyes forever locked on Charon's ferry that never, ever contained Patroclus, praying to gods that could either not hear him or no longer cared - return him to me, return him to me, please, mighty gods, return him to me) that he had neglected to think of anything else, anything at all (even the flame haired boy who called himself a man who sat by his side for a while and told gruesome tales of what he deemed victories, he hadn't even given him a first look, except when the boy had spat after telling all his bloody, broken tales I'm glad I did not give him peace and then, Achilles had willed him into Tartarus, but he had no power here and the boy walked away and for the slightest, briefest of moments, Achilles' longing turned to hate) and now, and now, Patroclus was- \"Patroclus?\" he asks, quietly, the most humbly he had ever spoken, those who had known him in life would've been shocked, unknowing of how much waiting had changed him. The spirit is still smiling, blankly and openly like a book as it replies kindly, as if it were an old, washer woman who was hard of hearing: \"Who?\" Achilles resigns himself to an eternity of watching and following, and he thinks of his pride and honour and determination and all the souls on these fields with their blood on his hands, and knows that this is his punishment. The shade that once had been Patroclus walks away, weaving through the trees planted by the Lady Persephone, and as always, Achilles follows, and he is still the moon, and Patroclus remains the sun, and to this day, they are, as they have always been, one.",

    "text": "Dating websites, the latest method Midgardians used to find a mate. Not that Loki ever seen to have trouble with before, but mind you he was curious though and this internet dating seemed to cut out the hassle of trying to find someone to chat up. So Loki had a date, after shifting through the profiles of nutcases and the married nymphomaniacs here he stood at the bar of high class restaurant sipping some quite exquisite scotch while he waiting for his date to arrive. She was already late; if his watch was correct she was late by over half an hour by now. His jaw tightened in annoyance. \"Five more minutes.\" He thought \"Five minutes and then I am leaving\" That would give him enough to time to enjoy his drink. Maybe he could go out to a bar and salvage something from this disastrous experiment. \"I'm assuming you are Loki.\" Purred a rich female voice which he likened to honey. He turned his head to identify its owner. \"And you are late.\" He stated flatly. \"Fashionably late, I'd like to think,\" She countered \"are we going to have dinner or shall I leave you alone with your drink?\" He raised his eyebrows in surprise; it was very rarely a simple midgardian had the audacity to speak to him like that even when they didn't know who he truly was. Then again as he studied her, he was being to doubt that assumption, she wasn't human at all. She was average height, made taller by a pair of glossy black heels. She was toned which emphasis her curves, much like the little black and white dress she wore. But it was her face that drew him in. Her face was oval shape, with a long thin nose and a pair of plum, cherry coloured lips that seemed to be in a perpetual smiling pout. Her olive skin tone contrasted with her eyes, gold in colour and rimmed with bronze around the outer iris. Maybe she was worth the wait. The woman who stood before him was also drinking in his appearance. His lean but muscular build was clearly visible through his crisp white shirt and well cut black three piece suit. His long raven black hair hung at his shoulders, framing his pale face and those startling cheek bones that could cut stone. \"Well, then Eris, we should better be seated then.\" He answered A young waiter lead them to a secluded table and Loki held her chair out for her before sitting himself and handed her a menu. Without sparing a glance at each other they quickly ordered meal and a good bottle of wine and sent the waiter scurrying off. Loki looked across the table and directly into her eyes, the harder he looked a silver aura became more and more visible and he was sure she was doing the same to him. \"Eris, are we just going to pretend that both our parents named us after ancient gods?\" he asked \"Only if you want to, I can maintain this glamour for as long as I need\" She replied with a smile. \"But I was wondering what the exiled asgardian prince would look like in all his finery.\" He laughed bitterly. \"My finery? Well I would love to see one of the very few legitimate daughters of Zeus in her natural attire, even though she doesn't hold a seat on Olympus\" Her smile didn't slip but her eyes hardened. \"Touche, using my half siblings against me, Loki. Can't say I didn't deserve it\" She glanced down at the table \"And I would be lying if I told you I didn't mean to upset you, being the Goddess of Chaos I have a cruel tongue.\" The waiter arrived with the wine and two glasses, Loki poured them both a glass. \"I have it on good authority I have a silver tongue, so we do make a pair.\" \"The Greek Goddess of Chaos and the Norse God of Mischief out on a date, if our families could see us.\" Loki chuckled and a grin spread across his face. \"I doubt they're much that would shock them now.\" \"You did give birth to a six legged horse.\" They both bursted into laughter. \"Ha! That story isn't true I can assure you. Changing the subject, what are you doing on Midgard?\" \"A girl's got to get he kicks somehow, why not Earth?\" she paused to sip her wine. \"These humans are so complex and yet so simple at the same time.\" \"Easily underestimated too. Especially the ones who turn into green beasts\" Eris snorted. Loki smiled at her. He felt almost at ease her presence, this rarely happened to him, especially as of late. Perhaps it was a feeling of kinship between two shunned royals he thought to himself. \"We have something in common there\" \"We do?\" \"You laid wasted to most of New York with alien army; I destroyed the Troy with an apple.\" \"Yes, your golden apples.\" His eyes shone in awe. \"That fruit is legendary throughout the realms; the magic you used caused one of the bloodiest Civil Wars ever seen.\" \"Coming from you, that is quite a complement.\" \"Strange it's only limited to the female of your species.\" \"Strange? Loki, magic fruit isn't exactly mind bending,\" The waiter soon arrived with the meal. \"Shall we eat?\" They ate in silence for a while. \"Loki, what are you doing here?\" \"I am in a three Michelin star restaurant on a date with the Lady Eris.\" She smiled causing her bottom lip to curl outward, making it appear pumper. \"We both know I mean Earth.\" \"I am on the run, as you probably suspected, from Asgardian justice.\" Loki said, spitting the last two words out. \"Earth is the last place they would look.\" \"On the run yet you still have time to date.\" \"What is life without a little pleasure?\" \"I couldn't agree more.\" \"But why aren't you in Olympus, Really now, and don't tell me you got tired of the orgies and the endless feasts?\" \"If only,\" she sighed \"after the Great Civil War spilled over into Earth and became the Trojan War, I am no longer trusted throughout all of mighty Olympus. There I am a social pariah, not that my social calendar wasn't full before. But now I am only called upon when they have need of my skills, failing that I am subjected to lectures on morality from hypocrites. Earth is the one safe place where I am free from all of that. Sad but true.\" Eris raised her wine glass with that last statement. \"So you are in hiding?\" \"You can call it that if you want.\" She said indifferently. \"But tell me, why did you cause the Civil War?\" \"According to my family, I threw a tantrum because I wasn't invited to some wedding.\" \"Well, is that true?\" \"Partly,\" she smiled bitterly \"I just had enough.\" She shrugged \"I wanted to prove what I could do. I wanted watch the high and mighty ladies brought to their knees, to show all of Olympus how pathetic and shallow they truly were. If you are going to ask if I regret it, I don't.\" Loki looked at her face, her jaw was tight and her eyes were practically glowing with conviction. He cast his mine back to what he'd done. What he did revealed his true heritage but how long would it have stayed secret if he hadn't. How long would he have had to live in Thor's hulking shadow? \"Seems we do have a lot in common,\" he began. She had been so open with him that he felt obliged to do the same. Then he found himself telling her about the ruined coronation, the venture into Jotenheim, the fact he was only just a pawn used to make peace, his brief reign and he fall into the abyss and parts of what inevitably came next. It almost felt good to tell someone, someone who seemed almost to understand. When he was finished he stared blankly down at the white table cloth, unwilling to meet her eyes. Eris looked at him; the imposing marble statue she'd met at the bar now looked vulnerable and small. She reached across the table and took his hand in hers. \"Do you regret falling from grace?\" she asked. His long fingers encircled hers. \"No, not now anyway.\" \"At least we still have our tricks.\" She told him \"I would still like you in your finery.\" \"I will if you will.\" His grin lit up his features. Then the air shifted and shimmered around him, at the same time a thin mist surrounded engulfed her. Within seconds Loki was sat there in his black and green and black leather armor, the golden horns on his helmet glinted in the dim light of the restaurant. He maintained the illusion to the rest of the diners, there was really no need to scare anyone at moment. \"No offence but that helmet looks utterly ridiculous, do you use it to charge at the enemy or is it just for extra height?\" She queried. Loki stayed quiet instead opted to simply raise his eyebrows. She really did have an acid tongue. Eris had changed but not drastically. Her hair had become wilder and thicker, barely restrained by a jewel studded crown that also acted as a comb. A matching gold bracelet dug into the flesh of her upper left arm. Her halter neck gown began lilac in colour towards the top and sank into a deeper shade of violet past her golden belt. The skirt of the dress seemed to be almost to float, translucently as if supported by an invisible breeze. \"It's a shame,\" she raised her eyebrows at his comment, \"I was rather hoping the rumours about your kind and their hatred clothing were true.\" \"Who said it wasn't.\" She smirked. Loki felt her bare foot stroke his inner thigh; even through the thick armor of his trousers the sensation sent an ache through his body. In one breathe she was insulting him and in the next trying to arose him. He found himself almost liking this game. \"Let me show you one of my favourite tricks.\" \"Not before we get some more wine I hope.\" Loki gestured to a waiter and turned his attention back to Eris. \"Look at the man over there,\" He pointed to the corner where a banker type was attempting to butter up the two men in expensive suits. Eris looking at him in mild disgust and wondered why they weren't in some seedy strip club somewhere. \"What are you going to do to him?\" he eyes shone in bemusement. \"This.\" Loki made a gesture with his hand causing snakes erupted from the man's glass. The man gave a terrified shriek, practically jumped onto his chair. The man's companions, who seemed unaware of the riving snakes, stared at him in sheer horror before quickly leaving. The man terrified man looked around for the snakes which had long disappeared then up at the faces of the startled dinners. His mouth opening and closing like a startled fish. \"Poor puppy.\" Eris thought as the man was kindly asked to leave and ushered towards the door. Loki and Eris looked at each other and started giggling like children. \"I think it's my turn, look at the couple to your left.\" She nodded in their direction. \"He's cheating on her and she knows about it, but doesn't want to upset the apple cart, so to speak.\" \"What are you going to do?\" She didn't answer but instead grinned and got up from her seat, leaving an image of her disguised self in her seat. She was invisible to the other diners, moving like she was made from vapours till she reached the couple. She bend down to whisper in the woman's ear. He could feel the power that dripped off her words vibrate around the room. \"You saw him look at the arse of that waitress, ogle that woman the bar, look at him. He's making a fool out of you and you know it, Are you going to let him carry on?\" \"No.\" the woman said out loud. Her partner looked at her in shock. \"What, babe?\" \"No.\" she said unsure. \"No!\" she sounded more confident this time. \"I am done! I am done with your cheating! Your lies!\" The woman was getting more and more angry and louder. \"I am done with you, I want a divorce and I want you out of MY apartment, yes mine! Because I'm the one who pays the bills. I want you out!\" She grabbed her bag. \"But, Sarah I've never cheated on you, baby,\" he pleaded \"I love you.\" \" Bull. Shit\" she stood up \"If you loved me so much why did I see you with your tongue down another woman's throat?\" \"Baby..\" \"Don't you dare baby me you pig!\" she shouted, emptying a glass of red wine down his front, before stalking out of the restaurant. The restaurant was silent yet again and the waiters were already on edge. Break up scenes were hardly new, but a man going berserk and a dramatic break up in the space of ten minutes was something strange. \"Wow. The power of suggestion.\" He said raising a glass to Eris who had long returned to her chair. \"Until she actually spoke of it, I didn't believe he was cheating.\" \"Don't look so impressed, it was just a little suggestion.\" \"Stop underrating your skills.\" \"Come on that one was easy.\" \"If it was so easy then how did you know he was cheating on her? Telepathy maybe?\" \"No! I wouldn't wish that on anyone! I'm just very emphatic to people's desires.\" \"Is it just limited to humans?\" he murmured, leaning across the table, towards her. \"Some things are just obvious.\" She leaned in herself \"Shall we get out of here?\" \"Do you have any ideas?\" he asked as he threw a few notes on the table. Curiously Eris did the same, transforming back into her midgardian clothes as she did so. He was slightly shocked, he expected her to be the kind of person to run out on a bill. \"I have an idea.\" She smiled wickedly, showing off two rows of perfect white teeth. There was something madder than just sex going through her mind. \"I bet you do.\" He answered confidently, truth be told he had no idea what she had planned; the concept both scared and excited him. \"Take my hand.\" She held her hand out towards him. \"Teleporting to where?\" He asked. But she offered no explanation, so obediently he placed his hand in hers. Then the restaurant melted away. After causing a bit of mischief in the restaurant, Eris takes Loki to the one place he shouldn't anywhere near (See the end of the chapter for notes.) Loki was teleporting by some else's magic, a feeling he wasn't used to. They were no longer in the restaurant. They were in nothingness. All he could feel was his hand in Eris's and hear her softly whispering in an unfamiliar language. That and the sensation that his stomach was in his boots. Thankfully that feeling didn't last long as he felt the feeling of solid ground beneath his feet. He breathed a sigh of relief. \"We're here,\" she whispered in his ear, \"you can open your eyes now.\" He wasn't aware they were shut till he opened them. \"I'm just not used to tele-\"He began but suddenly stopped. His stomach was defiantly stomach was in his boots this time as he looked up at the rest of rebuilt Avenger tower from its balcony. \"WHY. AM. I. HERE?\" he spat. Staring down at her smug face filled him with more rage. \"Is this your little plan? Huh? Flirt with me then trade me to the men who had me imprisoned in exchange for the All Father knows what!?\" She made no attempt to answer him. In fact she made no attempt to move. \"Answer me!\" He snarled, his face inches from her's. \"Nobody is home.\" She said flatly. \"What?\" he asked reeling in disbelief, still too angry to comprehend. \"I said nobody is home\" \"Nobody is home?\" he repeated. \"So what shall we do now then? Pop back another time when hopefully someone is in? Maybe they'll let us stay for dinner whilst we talk about old times.\" \"Are you quite done?\" He looked at her in disbelief. \"Look we could stay out here all night and you can rant like a lunatic or I can break us into the home of your enemies. Which would you prefer?\" \"How?\" \"There is more in heaven and Earth than you could possibly dream of in your philosophy, Loki.\" She held out her hand and blue sparks began to dance in her palm. \"Magic.\" \"Almost, magic AND science.\" Loki was intrigued. \"How can you..?\" \"A lady has to have some secrets, besides I've been on Earth many more times you.\" He didn't press the matter any further, he was too curious. Instead he watched her as she dance over to a grey metal box on the side of the building. She tore the metal box open exposing mesh of tangled wires and placed her hand amongst them, letting herself get acquainted with the energy that flowed through them, till she felt she was controlling it. She felt it pulse through her, through its circuit boards till she found what she was looking for. There was a brief clicking noise coming from around the building. To Loki, the clicking seemed a bit of an anti-climax, considering what she had just done was momentous. Eris removed her hand from amongst the cables, feeling the energy she had taken on drain from her body, she stumbled back into the grasp of two strong arms. \"Have you just opened every door is this place?\" He murmured into her hair. \"What do you think?\" She leant back to rest her head against his chest. \"I think you incredible.\" Eris smiled, choosing to stay, leaning against him for a few moments longer before taking the hand he wrapped around her waist and leading him to the open glass door. \"Let's go inside.\" This place was much as he remembered, still with the extensive bar in the corner and the bland decoration. He was hardly surprised that Stark had rebuilt in the exact same why. He looked over to the spot on the floor were the Hunk had thrown him repeatedly. The memory forced him to break out into a cold sweat. \"Loki,\" she murmured, he had gone whiter a shade of his usual pale. \"Loki, you know why I brought you here?\" She handed him a tumbler of scotch. He took it without moving his gaze from the newly laid floor. \"Why?\" He took a sip. \"For kicks I'm guessing.\" \"Almost certainly,\" she cradled her drink against her chest, \"But to also help you.\" \"Help?\" \"Destroy what destroys you. This place is where you were defeated, is it not?\" She gestured theatrically to their surroundings with her free hand. \"And this place will always hold some painful memories of that unless we do something to change that.\" \"By breaking in, when nobody is here.\" He answered dryly. Breaking in is just the beginning, we're going to desecrate the house of your enemies.\" He laughed softly, moving closer towards her. \"This is how you get your kicks.\" She bridged the small gap between them, pulling him down so her face could meet his; she briefly placed her lips against his. She retracted, though only slightly, leaving less than an inch between them. \"Defiantly\" she sighed. Then her golden eyes locked onto his blue ones. Then the glasses smashed on the floor. His lips pressed against hers in desperation and she responded, opening her mouth to deepen the kiss, her fingers entwined in his hair in a bit to pull him closer. His hands wrapped around her as if he was trying to do the same. Breathlessly they broke apart and smiled at each other. This time it was her who pulled him in, crushing his mouth against hers. His hands traced the soft satin of her dress, then cupping her buttocks. Eris responded by out a quick gasp of pleasure, wrapping her leg around his thigh. Tangled together, they awkwardly stumbled against the bar. Loki hoisted her up on to the bar sending a few glass bottles flying off and smashing on the floor. She was now the same height as him, her sweaty hands fumbling to undo his buttons. He helped her by shrugging off both his jacket and waistcoat. Although she his tie undone in seconds using it to pull him in for another kiss. He moved his lips from hers, trailing them down to her collar bone where he gnawed neck, his hands roamed across her back desperately searching for a way to get that dress off. \"Need a hand there.\" She murmured against his cheek. She leaned away from him, undoing a zipper under her arm. \"I think I can manage from here.\" He grabbed the bottom of the dress pulling it up over her head before discarding with his clothes and the broken glass. He paused and looked down at her almost naked in front of him. Her lacy black knickers, the honey coloured expanse of her midriff, her plump breasts, and the way she looked at him through the smudged make-up, the bruised lip and the crumpled hair. She looked like a feast, his cock harden further against his trousers. He quickly yanked down her knickers and she undid his belt forcing his trousers down as well, and then he pulled her in closer, trailing his mouth down from her neck to her breasts, her skin burned where he lips touched. He placed his mouth over her already hard nipple. \"Loki.\" She groaned arching her back. As he enters her, she wrapped her legs around his waist, pulling him in deeper. Rocked together against the bar's counter, each thrust sending a wave of ecstasy through her. She could feel herself coming to orgasm. \"Oh, Loki!\" she cried again, digging her nails into his back, as he cumed inside her. \"You are fantastic.\" He murmured breathlessly. She rested her head against his chest placing a kiss on his collar bone, his cock still inside her. \"I know.\" He chuckled and in turn kissed her hair as he wrapped his arms around her sweating body. - Eris woke up to find herself in the arms of the God of Mischief, her head resting against his chest. During the night they must have found one of the many beds located in the tower as they were draped in white bedding. She sleepily titled her head to look at the sleeping god. His face was relaxed, making his sharp features appear softer, almost innocent. She sighed, gently moving out of his arms so not to wake him and padded over the en suite bathroom to clean up. Looking at herself in the bathroom mirror, she methodically removed the remains of her make up. Her mind more focused on the night before and the sleeping asgardian in the next room. \"Last night had been great.\" She thought discovering one of Loki's love bites on her next, what to do next was the difficult bit. She returned minutes later and walked over to a built in wardrobe, glancing briefly at the Loki's naked body barely draped in a white bed sheet. She noticed the inflamed scratch marks tracking down in back and smiled to herself. Loki woke up feeling happy but somewhat foggy headed. He blinked, his eyes adjusting to the midmorning light and to the image of Eris, her back to him at the foot of the bed, methodically buttoning up a purple man's shirt she'd dug out from the wardrobe. \"Planning on loving me and leaving me?\" His voice, thick with sleep send a shiver down her spine. She stopped buttoning up the shirt. \"You were asleep, didn't want to wake you.\" She replied flat. \"So now you've fucked me you don't want me, is that it?\" His tone was more hurt than angry. \"It's whatever you want it to be.\" She turned to look at him. \"Are you taking that shirt as a trophy? Am I a conquest?\" He asked as he moved to sit up. \"Am I not one of yours?\" \"Eris,\" he sighed throwing himself back down on the bed and rubbing his face with in hands. \"I love playing games but stop answering every question with a question.\" \"Why?\" He opened his eyes in frustration, so he could glare at her. She grinned at him like a child. \"What do you propose we do next?\" \"I propose you stop acting like a child.\" \"Now, who's acting like a child?\" she counted. He laughed. \" Touche, I propose you come over here.\" She obeyed, besides not getting the answer she was looking for. He sat up as she approached and placed his hands on her hips. \"I am a prince on the run, you are a princess in hiding. It sounds almost like a fairy tale.\" \"Except I am not a princess.\" She interjected. \"You are hardy a pheasant. What I am attempting to say is, shall we have a little fun while we're here? Together?\" \"Why not?\" she said straddling him, \"You are one hell of shag.\" \"So we'll just fuck for ever, then.\" \"I certainly won't complain.\" She pushed down on to the bed and straddling him. He laughed.\" You won't.\" Nothing like a bit of breaking and entering, throwing expensive booze on the floor and sex. An attempt at domestic bliss and invasion of privacy to come Loki and Eris, the Norse God of Mischief and the Greek Goddess of Chaos had been together for nearly six months drifting across Europe, living in lavish properties they either owned or \"acquired\". Eris had an extensive number of properties throughout the planet. Right now she and Loki found themselves in her villa in Greece. Unlike most of her other properties this one was simpler and cosier, to her it seemed to feel more like home than anywhere else (See the end of the chapter for notes.) Loki and Eris, the Norse God of Mischief and the Greek Goddess of Chaos had been together for nearly six months drifting across Europe, living in lavish properties they either owned or \"acquired\". Eris had an extensive number of properties throughout the planet. Right now she and Loki found themselves in her villa in Greece. Unlike most of her other properties this one was simpler and cosier, to her it seemed to feel more like home than anywhere else. Eris looked out on the coastline of the Greek island; the lazy ocean glistening in the sunlight lapped the mountainous cliffs that formed a natural harbour, the little fishing boats bobbling gently on its surface. She thought about how everything had changed since her people came, how it had pretty much stayed the same. The landscape had changed with the changing tide but the people here stayed the same. \"Eris,\" Loki called from the other room, bringing her out of her daydream. \"What is this?\" \"What?\" she replied lazily, \"You haven't found some ex-lover in the kitchen cupboard, have you?\" \"No.\" he replied, she knew a simple reply from him meant he'd found something interesting. She went to go find out what. She found him in the living room staring down at a huge mosaic of a circle with arrows spreading out from its centre in all directions. \"It's the symbol of chaos.\" \"It's not the symbol, I'm interested in.\" Her gut tightened, if he knew what was laid under it. \"I can feel power, a strong magic from this spot.\" He looked at her expectantly, like she was going to tell him. \"Probably an enchantment I placed on it years ago.\" She answered as blase as possible, \"Come on, let's have lunch.\" He looked at her unconvinced, but he dropped it. - Loki had left her to go take care of some business somewhere, truth be told she didn't really what he was doing, along as he was out the way for her to check her vault. As much as she liked Loki even loved him, she didn't trust him as far as she could throw him.She walked to the centre of the mosaic and drew an oriental dagger from her side and dug it into the tip of her finger causing a droplet of blood, gold in colour to drop onto the centre of the circle. In response the surrounding tiles groaned and dropped to form a stone staircase. Eris descended conjuring a light into the palm of her hand. She reached a corridor where doorways spouted off in numerous directions, creating a labyrinth. She clicked her fingers. A door appeared in a doorway to her left and swung open as if to greet her. Eris smiled to herself and walked into a huge indoor garden.The room was hexagonal in shape, each segment holding a raised flower bed, brimming with exotic and bazaar plants, all as deadly as they were beautiful. The room was illuminated by a miniature white star suspended in a circular dome that feed out into space. Loki watched her; shielded by layers upon layers of enchantments he was invisible to her. He watched her treat the plants as if they were her children. He was seeing another side to the carefree goddess, a side were she was compassionate and tender, a side she'd hidden from him o refused to share. Despite himself, he found himself becoming jealous of some plants as he watched her make her way to the centre of her garden. Unlike the other flowerbeds, this one contained a single apple tree with a single golden apple. Eris reached up and plucked it, causing the tree to quiver. Eris hushed and stroked a limb of tree trying to comfort it. She took the apple and placed it into a plain looking box, replaced the lid which fused the rest the box, leaving no join and effectively making the box a bland cube. Loki moved closer, curious as to what she was going.Eris felt something shift in the air around her. Something that shouldn't be there. She froze, grabbing the dagger from her hip. Loki's breathe caught in his throat. She couldn't know he was here, could she? He panicked teleporting into the living room and threw himself into an armchair and pulled down his sleeves down assuming that would hid his guilt. She couldn't have known it was him. He heard her footsteps up the stone steps. \"So, it is a vault after all.\" He quipped \"You knew that, I wouldn't insult you to pretend otherwise.\" She was on edge. \"What are you doing back so early?\" \"You want rid of me?\" He watched her stride over to the kitchen. \"Just weren't expecting you back so soon.\" \"If you want me to, I'll leave.\" He stood up. \"Don't be ridiculous, you're here I might as well put up with you.\" \"I feel honoured.\" \"Ha! You should be.\" He looked down at the sealed vault under the mosaic. Instead of wondering how he could get back in there without her, he began to feel guilty about spying on her. The feeling settled in his stomach like a rock. \"Are you hungry?\" She called from the kitchen. \"Hmm,\" He replied, he wasn't listening. So she picked up a bread roll and threw it at him, hitting him square in the head. \"What?\" He turned to her astonished. \"I asked you if you were hungry.\" She tried to supress a grin but that look on his face was pure gold. \"So, you threw some bread at me.\" \"Because you weren't listening.\" She was acting like child, or at least taking her frustration out on him. \"Really?\" \"You're listening now aren't you?\" He was not going to dignify that with an answer. \"Well are you?\" \"Am I what? Afraid you're going to toss more bread at me?\" \"Hungry, Loki, are you hungry?\" She was holding a bread roll like it was a weapon. \"No I'm fine.\" He felt nervous. \"Eris, are you alright?\" \"Why wouldn't I be? Are you alright? You never ask that.\" She turned her attention to aggressively making a sandwich. \"Eris...\" \"What?\" She looked up at him. \"Damn it.\" She'd cut her finger open again on the bread knife. \"Let me look at it.\" Loki took her hand in his and inspected her finger. \"Your blood is gold.\" \"It's still just blood, Loki.\" \"Anyway, I think you'll live.\" He placed her finger to his lips and kissed it. \"Thank you doctor.\" She replied sarcastically, making no move to move away from him. \"Eris,\" he took the hand he was holding. \"You know I would never hurt you.\" Her hand went ridged in his. \"Are you trying to make me feel guilty about throwing a roll at you?\" She replied flippantly. \"If it is, you are really over doing it.\" She tried to pull away. He wouldn't let her. \"You are acting like a lunatic because I saw the entrance to your vault. Am I right?\" He waited for no reply, he knew it was about what she sensed in her garden. \"So I am here telling you, I would do nothing to hurt you, do you understand?\" She didn't anything, just stared at him angrily. \"I will be back later.\" He declared before disappearing, leaving Eris stood there in the kitchen confused and angry, crushing some leaves she'd brought up from her garden in the hand he hadn't been holding. Was that a declaration of love or clever manipulation? Eris got her answer a few days later If you haven't guessed Loki is up to something and it all kicks of next chapter! Avengers and all. Something or someone is in the house and they're not friendly. (See the end of the chapter for notes.) Eris woke up with a start. It was still the middle of night; Loki was still fast asleep next to her but something had spooked her. Feeling uneasy she grabbed a dagger out of the dressing table and tucked it under her pillow, her hand still on hilt. She rolled over and closed her eyes, but she didn't fall asleep. She must have like that for a least an hour. Her body began to relax, if anything to relive the cramp in her joints. Suddenly she was wretched up her hair. Every strand screamed as she was pulled from the bed. She swung wildly with her dagger, hitting nothing but air. Whatever had hold of her threw her into the bedside table like a doll. Her vision narrowed into two white points. A painful throbbing came from her forehead. She groped for her dagger, her vision clouded with blood. A boot collided with her back, she howled in pain as her face it the stone flooring. She closed her eyes and thought of somewhere safe as another boot went to come down on her leg. The boot never made contact as the bedroom and her attackers melted away. - When Eris finally opened her eyes, she still half expected the boot to crush her but it never came. Instead she found herself lying on the bathroom floor of another house she owned. She breathed a sigh of relief. Slowly she dragged her aching body up, using the towel rail to pull herself up, her legs like jelly and her back protesting. She pulled open the cabinet on the wall and grabbed a vial of purple liquid. Something she was thankful for bringing from Olympus. Tearing the top off, she downed its content and stumbled into the shower. For an age she stood there, letting the hot water wash over her, washing away the blood whilst the potion worked it's magic, repairing her damaged body. She closed her eyes and replayed it again and again in her head. But one image stuck in her head. As she was kicked to the floor she noticed the bed next to her was empty. Where had Loki gone? He was an Asgardian, a race trained practically from birth how to fight. She recalled what he said to her a few days ago. That he promised he would do nothing to hurt her. She felt sick. He may not have been the one trying to beat her to death but he certainly had something to do with the attack. How else would you explain how they got past her barriers and alarms? She remembered the feeling of unease when she was in her vault that day as well and threw up. She finally climbed out of the shower, no longer feeling broken. She looked at herself in the bathroom mirror as she wrapped a towel around herself. Dark patches of bruising still bloomed along her hairline and the middle of her back. But other than that she appeared fine. She dried herself and then put on a black pair of jeans and a black vest top and sat back on the large unmade bed. She knew she had to go back there, to see if Loki had managed to get into the vault and get what he was after. If he saw her open it, he would know the only way to get in was to by using her blood and her dagger alone. Then she remembered dropping the dagger as she felt the cut on the forehead. She almost laughed. He had been smart but if he had taken one of her apples it would have been the stupidest thing he'd ever done. Not just for what she was going to do to him when she got him. - Eris went back to her home but not physically in case her attackers were still her. Her body was still on that unmade bed but she had projected her mind into her Greek villa. Thankfully it was empty but that feeling of thankfulness had vanished when she walked into the living room. The mosaic that was the entrance to her vault was destroyed. Both the rubble from the floor had the stone steps lay strewn around the room.\" Maybe my blood wasn't enough after all.\" She thought bitterly as she entered her now useless vault. She didn't need to summon the door to her garden; it hung limply from its doorway on a single hinge. She didn't know if to feel angry or scared. She apprehensively walked through the doorway. The site made her want to weep. The flowerbeds were destroyed. Although she let the plants grow where ever and how ever they pleased, they were now ripped from the soil, flowers trampled bushed torn in half and trees broken at the stump. Loki was going to pay for this. By the Three Fates he was going to suffer. Eris walked over to where she stored the apples, in boxes on the far wall of the garden. Only one was missing. He was probably too busy murdering her plants to notice the others were full as well. But now she needed to protect what was left. She closed her eyes and started chanting. She was mentally moving the vault, it never really existed under the villa anyway, the entrance acted as a gateway. That done she let her mind float upward till it was hovering over the Greek villa. She looked down on it, perched on the cliff face. She began chanting again, this time the words were more violent. She stopped then clenched her fist; the cliff supporting the building crumbled causing a landslide which took the building with it. She didn't say to watch the carnage, she returned to her body and tried to remember where she physically was. Hopefully not too far from where she needed to go next. Is Loki bad? most probably, I haven't really decided. The Three Fates were more powerful that the Gods, they controlled lives and events and were completely inflatable. Thats why Eris is swearing to them. Preview of next chapter...Tony Stark emerged from his workshop for the first time in a while. He didn't know how long exactly and he didn't fancy asking JARVIS for any specifics. He wandered into the kitchen and paused. Sat at the breakfast bar as an attractive olive skinned woman with a mass of dark hair. In the aftermath of the break in and the theft of her golden apples, Eris turns to the only people who could really help her, the Avengers. Although she is a bit pressed for time and her methods are a bit unorthodox. (See the end of the chapter for notes.) Tony Stark emerged from his workshop for the first time in a while. He didn't know how long exactly and he didn't fancy asking JARVIS for any specifics. He wandered into the kitchen and paused. Sat at the breakfast bar as an attractive olive skinned woman with a mass of dark hair. \"We weren't supposed to going on a date or something?\" \"No, nothing like that, I think we just need to have a chat.\" She got down from the breakfast bar and walked towards him. Tony felt the hairs on the back of his neck rise up. \"Ok, if you could just contact Pepper or email me or something, so we can arrange to have this little chat that would be great. Like do it some other time maybe?\" She seemed unphased by this; he didn't really expect her to be. Through the sleep deprivation and the caffeine something occurred to him. \"How did you get in here?\" \"Ask your friend.\" She had stopped two feet away from Tony. \"JARVIS, how did,\" he looked at her for her to give her name, of course she said nothing. \"uh, how did this woman get in here?\" ~What woman, sir?~ He had a sinking feeling. \"JARVIS, how many people are in this room right now?\" ~My scanners are picking up no one but yourself.~ He looked back to her. \"What do you want? I should warn you, I don't behave when I get kidnapped.\" \"Like I said a chat.\" She reached forward and put her hand the arc reactor in Tony's chest, he couldn't move. \"But not just with you, I need you to call your friends.\" - \"Do you know what the hell Stark wants?\" Clint asked as he met Steve in the corridor. \"I don't know.\" Steve sighed. \"If it's for another photo shoot I'm gonna shot him.\" Natasha stated. \"Hi guys,\" Bruce wandered out of the elevator. \"Anyone know why Tony called an emergency meeting?\" \"None of us do.\" Steve replied as he opened the door to the conference room. He froze. Tony was sat at the head of the table, a woman stood behind him, her left hand resting on his shoulder in her right glowed the arc reactor. Eris looked at the rest of Avengers in the doorway. The blonde hunk, most likely Captain America, was the blocking the doorway, acting like a human shield for the others. Both the redhead and the shorter blond had handguns trained on her and someone else was hidden behind them. \"Hello.\" \"Who are you?\" the hunk asked. \"Eris,\" her name didn't ring any bells, that didn't surprise her. The hunk's eyes were fixed on Tony. \"He's fine, if that's what you're wondering, well as long as I stay in contact with him. So I wouldn't shoot if I were you.\" \"What do you want?\" \"I asked Stark to send out a message to you all, so I can talk to you about a common threat we both share.\" \"And Stark?\" asked the redhead, she still had her gun trained on her. \"Just a precaution, I'll put it back in when we're finished.\" She said gesturing to the arc reactor in her hand. \"Come on sit down.\" Apprehensively they took seats as far away from her and Tony as possible. \"Come on then, we're waiting.\" Clint muttered. \"Loki,\" she took pleasure in seeing Clint pale. \"If you knew it or not, Loki escaped from Asgard and has been living in one Earth for a while now.\" \"And you know this how?\" She ignored him and continued, \"He is planning something, something big and dangerous\" \"Planning what exactly?\" asked the Captain. \"Not exactly a tea party.\" \"How do you know this and how can we trust you?\" Stupid questions were flying left, right and centre, she thought to herself. Didn't they realize she was offering them their enemy's head on a platter? \"I know this because I've been living with him till last night...\" \"Oh great! An angry ex-girlfriend.\" Clint declared. \"I have your team mate's heart in my hand so I'd shut up if I were you! As I was saying, till last night where he stole something from me. Something that if I don't get back is going to have disastrous consequences for your planet.\" \"And you've come to us because you want it back.\" Natasha said, resting her gun on the table. \"What does he have of yours exactly?\" \"One of my golden apples.\" \"An apple, no disrespect but what damage can an apple do?\" asked Steve. \"I really have to explain who I am,\" she sighed The door swung open. \"My apologies friends, for my tardiness.\" Thor strode in \"I...\" He stared at the woman behind Tony. \"Lady Eris,\" Thor placed his hand across his chest and bowed slightly. \"I was not expecting to see you here.\" \"Prince Thor,\" she mimicked his gesture using the hand holding the arc reactor. \"Trust me; I am here out of necessity.\" \"You two know each other?\" Steve asked \"Eris is a member of the Olympian Royal family, on diplomatic visits to her realm I had the pleasure of making her acquaintance.\" \"You said Olympian, right?\" asked Bruce. \"Yes, I did.\" \"And you're the Norse God of Thunder.\" \"Yes, what are you trying to say?\" \"In Greek mythology the Gods lived on Olympus and I remember some myth about apples or something. So wouldn't that make her a Greek Goddess right?\" \"Of what?\" Clint asked. \"Chaos. The Goddess of Chaos and Strife. Well, that's what kind used to call me. In reality; I am a powerful magic user from another world, and when I am in the room I refer not to be referred to as \"her.\"\" Bruce closed his eyes and leant back on his chair. \"The golden apple which Loki took is of course magic and highly dangerous.\" \"How?\" \"They drive people mad with the need to possess them; they have torn nations and realms apart. Luckily they are ineffective when they're in a containment cube, like the one Loki stole, but once removed, they are activate and this one I grew will become very volatile. Much like a bomb.\" \"How much damage can this do?\" \"Like Nagasaki and Hiroshima combined.\" Steve froze; he remembered hearing how America ended the war in the Pacific. \"So what do you propose we do?\" asked the redhead. \"We work together, we get back my apple, you save the world, I get to have my fun with Loki.\" \"Lady Eris, I cannot allow you to kill him, he is still my brother whatever he's done.\" \"He stole from me Thor; I do not take that likely. But don't worry, I won't kill him. I'll just make him wish I would. You can have whatever is left.\" Thor stayed silent. \" I can work with that, but before we discuss this any further can you release Tony?\" Steve asked, looking at the pale and sweaty Tony. \"Since you asked nicely, I'll give the tin man back his heart.\" Eris placed the arc reactor back into Tony's chest. He groaned and slumped against the table. \"Thanks Cap,\" he murmured. \"No problem,\" Steve answered. \"Do you have any idea were Loki could have gone?\" \"I have a few, but nothing concrete and I know he has help, that's why I'm here.\" \"He has an army we have the Hulk.\" Tony muttered. \"What?\" she looked down at him. \"Nothing.\" \"If you could give those locations to Romanoff and Barton so they could contact shield, that would be great.\" \"No problem, but I have a contact of my own I need to see as well.\" \"Eris?\" it was Bruce. \"How did you remove Tony's arc reactor without killing him?\" She shrugged. \"Magic is the manipulation of energy, simple as that. The energy that powers this\" she gestured to the arc reactor \"is flowing through me and into Stark, I'm just acting as a transducer, making it flow through me to him at a much lower rate.\" \"Right,\" Bruce looked thoughtful, \"Would that mean the apple would give off an energy signal that we could track, it being made from magic or energy?\" \"I never thought of it like that. If you could track the energy signature of my magic it would seem possible.\" \"So it's settled, we're gonna help the crazy bitch who ripped out my arc reactor get back her magic apple and defeat Loki, sounds like fun.\" Steve ignored Tony, \"Clint will contact SHIELD and inform them on the possible situation. If Loki is a threat we are going to need all the information we can get.\" \"As long as I'm going after that bastard I'm happy.\" Clint muttered. \"Tony, get some rest.\" he said looking at bags hanging from Tony's brown eyes. \"Natasha, me and you are going to talk some more with Eris.\" Natasha nodded and Steve turned to Thor, \"Thor can you sit in on it.\" \"Of course, I will be glad to act as a mediator.\" \"Lucky me.\" Eris muttered. \"Lady Eris, would you care to accompany me?\" Thor stood up and offered Eris his arm; she walked over and took it. \"I'll be there in minute,\" Steve called to them. He grabbed Tony's arm as he passed. \"Can I have a word?\" \"Sure cap,\" Tony looked down at Steve's hand on his arm. Steve immediately dropped it. \"I don't trust her.\" \"Really\" he replied sarcastically \"What's not trustworthy about breaking in and literally ripping my heart out, then asking us for help?\" Steve smiled. \"Yeah, well she made some references that make me think she's been on Earth awhile.\" \"You mean the whole nuclear bomb comment or the bit where she called me a tin man? Maybe she watches old movies and the history channel.\" \"Can you run her face through some computer or something?\" \"Some computer? Yeah sure.\" Steve watched him leave; Tony must have been on knees not to argue with him. But he had other things to worry about like a potential bomb wiping out half the planet and a temperamental goddess alien to deal with. - Natasha led Thor and Eris to the kitchen and took a seat at the breakfast bar, Thor and Eris did the same. Natasha looked at her and noticed the dark patches on her face and bare shoulders; they looked similar to bruising, as well as the rings under her eyes and the sight tremors in hand when she took the cup of coffee Natasha offered her. She had been involved in something violent. Natasha thought of which approach to take with her. \"How are you?\" she asked. Eris looked at her in surprise, \"I've been better.\" \"That's to be expected.\" Eris looked at her, expecting her to say more. She didn't. Thor also stayed uncharacteristically quiet, probably because he was sat next to the woman who threatened to torture his brother to the point of death. Taking a sip of her own coffee she looked at Eris again, \"Did he do that to you?\" Eris looked down at the light brown liquid in her mug, \"I'm not sure, I never saw who did it.\" \"How do you know he was involved?\" \"It happened when we were in bed, one moment he's next to me, next moment I'm being attacked.\" \"My brother is many things but I doubt he would assault you.\" \"I doubt chivalry is one of Loki's few virtues.\" Natasha muttered. Steve arrived and took a seat around the island breakfast bar. \"Can you tell me how Loki came by this golden apple?\" The earnest look on his face and those sincere blue eyes made her want to slap him. \"He broke into my vault and stole it.\" \"My Lady, the Captain is just trying to find out what lead you here to seek our help.\" \"Then the Captain should have phrased the question a bit better.\" She replied. Natasha smiled slightly at her remark; she had to hand it to Eris for knowing how to throw an interrogator off. \"Please tell us what happened?\" \"Ok,\" Eris then proceeded to tell them as slightly edited version of the events being sketchy over locations. \"If my brother really is planning to destroy the Earth what could he possibly gain?\" \"He doesn't know it's a bomb, why would he? He never stopped to ask.\" \"So he's planning world domination again, by using the apple as what?\" \"It drives people mad with desire, people would give up their first born just to look at it. He'll try using it to control the leaders of nations and the people themselves. That's my guess anyway.\" \"Why?\" \"He has a God complex,\" answered Natasha. \"Wow, that's ironic.\" Steve said. They all chuckled. \"Why haven't you tried using these apples yourself?\" \"I did once, on Olympus. Things got out of hand.\" Steve and Natasha looked at her to carry on but it was Thor who picked up the ball. \"Eris threw the apple onto the high table of a wedding, the highest ranking members of royalty were sat there and the apple worked it's charm, so to speak, and they started arguing over it, and it escalated into a bloody civil war. Which ended with little change to the order of Olympian rule.\" \"So your coup failed?\" \"It wasn't a coup as such, I was young and angry and I wanted to watch them tear each other apart.\" Eris shrugged. \"According to reports that came to Asgard, the Lady Eris was angry she wasn't invited to the wedding.\" \"You caused a war because you weren't invited to a wedding?\" \"Yes, I did. But it was more the cherry on the cake.\" Steve just stared at her in disbelief; this woman caused death and destruction because of a social slight. \"If you love destruction and carnage so much, you not let Loki take the apple and destroy the planet?\" Natasha asked. \"He lied to me and stole from me and mostly because I'm a little older and wiser now, and I don't see the point in destroying a place I actually live in.\" \"Why not go back to Olympus?\" \"I maybe from there, but it's not my home.\" Thor looked at Eris and thought that's what his brother must feel about Asgard. ~ Captain Rogers, Agent Romanov, Tony requests your presence in Lab 3 immediately ~ \"Alright, JARVIS tell him we're on our way, Thor can you keep Eris company?\" \"A beautiful lady? Shouldn't be much trouble.\" Thor replied grinning. Eris smiled a little at his comment Natasha noted. \"Don't let Jane find out then.\" - When they entered the lab Tony jumped out at them like an excited puppy. Bruce remained seat at a desk. \"You guys need to see this!\" he exclaimed almost bursting with excitement. He'd probably just drank more coffee then actually rested as Steve hoped he would. \"This the thing you ran on her?\" \"The thing? Seriously? I know you were frozen for like ever but...\" \"Tony, come out with it.\" Natasha barked. \"Ok,\" he turned his back to them and summoned up a holographic screen. \"As you asked Cap, I ran her face through a software recognition programme which searched through everything and I mean everything and this is what I found.\" He brought a series of photographs in a timeline spanning over a hundred years. \"Is this for real?\" \"Yep, look at this one.\" Tony enlarged the photo at the beginning of the timeline, \"Here she is with the Russian Royal Court before the revolution happened, she's the one next to the monk guy with the awesome beard.\" \"Rasputin.\" Bruce clarified. \"Yeah, that guy. But it gets better,\" He pulled up another from around the same time, but this time she was stood next to a tall balding man. \" Here she is with Lenin.\" \"Do you think she had a hand in causing the Russian Revolution?\" Steve asked. \"No idea, we couldn't find any supporting information or documents.\" \"So, we've just found out she's an ageless goddess who has been on Earth a while then.\" \"Ah, but it gets even better. She was part of project Manhattan under the alias of Emma Lowe.\" \"She helped create the atomic bomb.\" \"So did you father, Stark.\" Replied Natasha. \"Yeah well, yeah,\" Tony gave up trying to justify his father's work. \"but look at these.\" Tony brought up a range of photos ranging from the 60s onward. Bruce stood up to take over, \"Here she is with JFK, we checked the date and this was nowhere near the time of assassination, in fact we found evidence that she helped fund his election campaign under the name of Amelia Von Luchenberg, a Swiss heiress apparently. Turns out she was a socialite in America. But these are the ones we should be concerned about, Tony can you bring the up?\" Tony brought up a series of photos which appeared to be surveillance shots, varying in age as they seemed to span a number of decades. The photos were of Eris or whatever she was calling herself then, having lunch with a man; the only thing that changed was the fashion and the age of the man. \"Who is than man she's with?\" Steve asked. \"The mutant terrorist, Magneto a.k.a Erik Lehnsherr, SHEILD have no pinpoint on his location.\" Natasha recalled. \"Is this proof enough not to trust that crazy bitch?\" Tony asked. \"Wait as second,\" Bruce said taking off his glasses. \"I've reading up on the Greek mythology thing.\" \"And?\" \"Well, they seem to give patronage to heroes, like a sponsoring them. I think this is what Eris was doing with Kennedy and possibly Lenin.\" \"Explain the Russian Court photo?\" \"They were also known for acting as judges, maybe that's why she supported Lenin?\" \"This all seems like speculation to me.\" Replied Steve, Bruce just shrugged. \"But if Bruce is right, she could be helping Magneto.\" Natasha stood there with her arms folded, \"She mentioned that she had a contact she wanted to talk to.\" \"You think she meant Magneto?\" Steve looked to Natasha for a reply, he got a shrug. \"What's then plan then?\" \"But if she's right about Loki and she willing to help capture him-\" \"The enemy of my enemy is my friend.\" Natasha said. \"Something like that.\" Steve left and made and headed back up to the kitchen. Tony turned to Bruce. \"We gonna build this tracker thing or what?\" - Steve walked out of the elevator to the sound of thunderous laughter. \"And it's head exploded and there was this gore on everything, I stank for weeks, not a single maiden would even look at me!\" Sounded like Thor was telling an old battle story. He walked in to see him and Eris leaning against the counter in a fit if laughter. Clint was back and was making coffee. Steve nodded to him. \"Don't ask me what their talking about.\" Clint gestured to the aliens. Steve walked up to Clint. \"What did SHIELD have to say?\" \"Some footage was picked up with supposedly Loki's face recently, mainly towards Eastern Europe. Nothing concrete though. But as soon as I turned up with her story, SHEILD went mental. Should have seen the vein popping out of Fury's head, is was like.\" Clint made a pulsing gesture with is hand to his forehead. \"What did he have to say?\" \"Work with her, but don't trust her. Pretty much what we were going to do anyway.\" \"At least we have evidence he's on Earth, any possible allies he would have?\" \"A list as long as my arm, What about this contact of hers?\" \"That's what I'm going to find out.\" He turned to face her and Thor. \"Eris,\" She stared at him for a second, \"Yes.\" \"This contact you mentioned, is he Magneto?\" She looked at him in bemusement, \"What Erik? No he's probably busy at the moment, best not to bug him right now.\" \"What is that supposed to mean?\" \"Nothing.\" \"If we help you give us Magneto?\" \"I'm giving you Loki and helping you save the world, you'll get nothing else.\" Her voice had an edge to it. \"He is a terrorist.\" Clint exclaimed. \"One man's terrorist is another's freedom fighter, more so when your government is trying to exterminate his people.\" Steve was silent, what she said was true but he couldn't let her see that. \"So this contact?\" Clint said, breaking the silence. \"Are we going to meet 'em anytime soon?\" \"You're coming with me then?\" \"Me?\" \"Yes, you'll have to change into something smarter,\" she looked down at what she was wearing, \"So will I, met you back here in ten minutes?\" \"Sure.\" \"Hang on here.\" Steve argued \"Don't worry, I'll look after him.\" With that she disappeared. Stony forever! and trust me it gets better!Nothing makes me happier than dragging the x men into things, especially the Marvellous Magneto, not necessarily a villain, not really a hero.Also I did try and hint at something to do with the Marvel Civil War Saga, they were subtle, really subtle.Keep reading for some Clint and Natasha, more angst from Steve and some from Tony. Oh and some plot, that too. Clint and Eris travel to met Eris's contact who proves to be very useful. (See the end of the chapter for notes.) Clint went back to his room and pulled a suit, correction, his only suit from the wardrobe. He heard the door open quietly and the sound of quiet footsteps. He would have only heard her if she let him. \"Creeping up on me Tash?\" \"I heard you're going with her to meet her contact.\" Clint started to get changed. It wasn't like she hadn't seen any it before. \"You jealous?\" \"No, I just,\" She shifted awkwardly from one foot to the another, \"I just don't want to have to punch you in the face again, that's all.\" \"If that's your way of telling me to stay safe, well it kinda sucks.\" \"After what Loki make you do, made you my enemy. I don't want that to happen again.\" \"It won't.\" He shortened the gap between them, \"If it does I'll always have you to drag me back.\" She smiled and started tying his tie for him. It could have almost been a scene from Mad Men, the two of them the perfect couple. Well, if you ignored the fact she was a deadly assassin who could easily kill him with that tie. She placed her hands against his chest and leant in. \"Just be careful,\" and with that she left. Clint sighed and shrugged on his suit jacket. She was so, well he didn't know what really. - Clint made his way to the kitchen, Steve was scolding, even Thor didn't try talking to him and the \"Lady\" Eris was waiting for him, dressed as a wealthy business woman, her mop of hair kind of tided. \"Where the hell are we going?\" \"Come and find out.\" She held out her hand to him. He glanced at Steve, he continued to glare at the floor, \"Just come back to us, Barton.\" \"Sir, yes, sir.\" He saluted Captain America. \"Seriously, what do you think I'm going to do to him?\" Clint took her hand. \"Take a deep breath and hold it.\" She told him - Clint's stomach lurked as the floor disappeared then quickly reappeared. He looked around him, he was in the courtyard of some high market office buildings in Britain he guessed from the way that logo spelled colour with a \"u\". \"You handled that better than I thought you would.\" He looked to see Eris regarding him with a quizzical expression. \"Hand me your hand again.\" She ordered. \"Why?\" \"Only a binding spell, to protect my contact.\" He just stared at her. Eris rolled her eyes impatiently. \"Really, it's to prevent you from revealing his name, and this location, it wouldn't hurt or turn you into a zombie or my sex slave. I don't think the redhead would like that.\" \"You know she'll hunt you down and find a way to kill you, painfully?\" \"That's why you're going to be fine.\" Clint begrudgingly gave her his hand again and she muttered an enchantment. Clint felt an invisible rope tighten around his arm up towards his throat, then suddenly release. \"There we go, any urge to eat brains?\" It was Clint's turn to roll his eyes. \"Come on.\" He followed her into the nearest building. She walked past the guard, Clint noticed he was packing heat, something that was illegal in Britain, and straight up to the petite secretary behind an enormous desk. \"I have an appointment to see Mr. Rees.\" \"And can I take your name?\" the girl asked. \"Certainly, it's Cecilia Discordia.\" \"Well, Ms Discordia, Mr. Ares is still in a meeting at the moment, if you'd like to take a seat for now.\" \"Thank you.\" Eris replied, Clint followed her to a faux leather sofa, feeling a bit like a lap dog. \"Who are we seeing exactly?\" \"The CEO.\" \"You're contact is the head of a global security firm?\" \"Yes.\" \"Ha, not bad.\" The two sat there in silence for a bit. Clint watched her tap her fingers on her knee repeatedly, a nervous twitch. Finally, a male PA led them up to an enormous office and abandoned them there, promising Mr. Ares, whoever the hell he was, would be there shortly. The place was open planned, although Clint noticed the glass walls were bullet proof and fixed with automatic steel stutters. The room itself was dominated by an uncomfortable, fancy leather sofa and an elaborate oak desk with a huge circular, Grecian shield behind it. The shield was decorated with images of war and the huge faces of two boys and two women, equally spaced around the shield. Eris noticed he was looking and leant towards him. \"The woman's face on the left is mine.\" He looked at her and then the shield; he couldn't see a resemblance at all. \"The woman on the right is my sister, and the two boys are my nephews.\" She continued. What the hell had he got himself into? A mountain of a man emerged into view. \"Eris!\" he called. \"Ares!\" she called as the man mountain pulled her off her feet and into a bear hug. The man, Aries was huge, a similar height to Thor but more muscular, his huge forearms threatened to burst out of his suit jacket. Clint's hand hovered over his concealed gun. \"Ares, this is Clint Barton. He's my escort for this trip.\" Aries studied Clint with a pair of intense dark brown eyes. Clint could see the family resemblance, the same skin tone, similar noses although his appeared to be broken in several places and the same hair colour, although his hair and beard we cut short. \"So you're fucking my little sister.\" It was an accusation not a question. \"Uhh..\" Clint stuttered. \"Of course not!\" Eris exclaimed, \"Ignore him, he's just trying to intimidate you.\" She told Clint. \"Clint is one of the avengers, the one with the arrows.\" She told Aries. \"Ah, you're Hawkeye!\" Aries exclaimed shaking Clint's hand. \"You are one hell of archer!\" \"Thanks.\" \"Sorry about that, A few months ago my sister told me she was dating someone, although she wouldn't say who or introduce us.\" Ares shot an accusing look at his sister. \"Were you able to get the information?\" Eris quickly changed the subject. \"Did you doubt me?\" \"Of course not, brother. I just wanted you to stop talking.\" \"Ha! I do miss you, Eris. I've got it on the desk; loaded onto the tablet.\" Eris walked over to the desk. \"So, what are you the God of then?\" Clint asked him. Ares turned to look at him. \"You know she's the Goddess of Chaos and all.\" \"I'm the God of War, running a million dollar private security company.\" He replied, \"She put a binding spell on you?\" \"Yeah, she did.\" \"Ha! She's a smart girl when she wants to be.\" Ares winked at Clint. \"Come on then, I'll give you some compensation.\" Aries grinned and walked over to the bookcase. This guy's personality was bigger than his build, Clint thought, kind of like Thor. Ares pulled out a book causing the bookcase to slide out of the way to reveal some kind of armoury. It was like something from an episode of Scooby-doo. Ares picked up a high tech bow. \"Here,\" he tossed it at Clint. \"Light, but sturdy and it can collapsible, just pressed the button in the centre.\" Clint pressed it and the bow folded in on itself till Clint was left with a short baton. \"Impressive,\" Clint murmured, pressing the button again, causing it to fold out again. He drew the bow string back and lined it up. It was one amazing bow, probably the best he'd ever held. \"This is fantastic.\" He looked back at Ares, who was wearing a pleased grin. \"Why are you giving this to me?\" Aries walked up to Clint and murmured. \"I know why Eris needs that information, and I know what danger this planet is in if you don't help her get it.\" \"You're a mercenary, war is money.\" \"Not everything is about profit, Hawkeye.\" Aries' tone became graver, \"I have a family here and if anything were to endanger them...well I don't know what I'll do. And that's why I'm trying to help you in any way I can.\" Aries' words settled like a stone in Clint's chest. If the God of War was worried then the shit was about to hit the fan. \"Ares, you still have my puppies?\" Eris called, walking over from the desk, \"Nice toy, Clint.\" She glanced at the bow. \"Just giving Hawkeye some help.\" Ares turned back to the armoury behind the bookcase. \"Getting generous in your old age.\" She quipped. \"At least I'm not getting careless.\" He retorted. Clint saw Eris's face turn to stone. \"Here, we go.\" He handed her a small clay jar. \"Hawkeye can I have a work with my sister?\" \"Sure, can I have the tablet?\" Eris wordlessly handed it to him without looking at him and waited till he was out of earshot. \"Are you going to scold me, brother?\" She asked. \"I'd prefer to slap some sense into you, what the hell do you think you were doing?\" Eris stared back at him; anything clever she had to say wouldn't work on Ares. \"Don't you dare tell me you loved him! That's a piss poor excuse! Fucking Loki! The fallen Agardian nutcase! I know you're a sucker for revolutionaries but this is fucking ridiculous!\" \"Ha! You believe me to be that stupid! You'd really think I'd trust a man like him and that I'd swoon when some man declares his undying love to me?!\" She said those words as if they left a bad taste in her mouth. \"He tore my vault apart trying to get into it! He beat me half to death before he could get near it.\" She spat at him. \"He beat you?\" Aries asked flatly, Eris regretted telling him that now. This was her problem, not his. \"I'm not sure it was him, I didn't see his face.\" \"If he so much as laid a hand on you, I will take the fucking cunt's head and use it as a fucking hood ordainment.\" \"Oh I'd bet they'd love seeing you drive around Manchester with a fucking head on your Bentley. It's MY fucking problem and you have too much at stake here.\" She glanced at Clint as he stared at the tablet. \"Besides I want deal with Loki in my own way.\" \"What will you do?\" \"Cut out the bastard's tongue.\" Ares stared at his little sister's determined expression. \"Good luck then, sister. You'll need this.\" He presented her with a long, rectangular box. She already knew what was inside. \"Thank you.\" She turned away and headed towards the lift, flanked by Clint. Clint had heard the whole exchange between the siblings as he flicked through the grainy satellite photos and pretended not to hear. It made him wonder how many aliens were living on Earth. Then he thought unless they were trying to take over the Earth or destroy it, why should he care? \"How come we didn't just teleport right into his office?\" he asked her as they exited the office buildings. \"Because I can't.\" She snapped. Clint raised an eyebrow, and Eris saw this was his way of asking for more information, she sighed. \"I made the building teleportation proof, not me or anyone else who can teleport can't get in there. Hence why we used the front door.\" She held her hand out to him and he took it. - Steve paced up and down the kitchen. He felt anxious about sending Clint with Eris, not that he didn't trust Clint to look after himself, it was just Eris was a lit fire cracker about to go off. \"Calm down Steve, there is not much you can do now.\" Thor told him. \"You didn't just send one of your men off with a mad woman.\" \"No, but my brother is yet again trying to take over Midgard. Not to mention he has possession of magic he cannot control.\" Thor stood up from his chair, \"And as I remember, Barton volunteered to escort Lady Eris.\" \"Sorry, Thor. I, I just don't trust her.\" \"No one on her home planet trusts her, so you are in good company. I assume that is why she is living here.\" \"You said she was a member of the royal family on Olympus, right?\" \"Yes it did, but when she came here, either through banishment or hiding she gave that up.\" \"So she's not ambitious, she's just helping us to get to Loki then.\" \"I will ensure she doesn't lay a hand on my brother, for all his crimes he is still my kin.\" \"That's noble of you.\" \"He is my brother, I owe him that much.\" Steve looked at the sadness in Thor's eyes, that suddenly went clear. \"Now Rogers, I retire to my quarters, if you have need of me that's where I'll be.\" Steve watched Thor walk out of the kitchen. A thought occurred to him. \"JARVIS has Tony had any sleep since the woman arrived?\" As a matter of fact, Mr. Stark has been asleep since you and Agent Romanoff left the lab. Would you like me to wake him? \"No JARVIS, that's fine.\" Steve smiled to himself. The world was under threat, a possible weapon was in the hands of a psychotic alien and he had another psychotic alien as a possible ally to deal with and still he was stood there worrying about Tony. Tony the impulsive, alcoholic, smart mouthed, narcissistic hero. Why the hell was he feeling like this? Steve pinched the bridge of his nose between his fingers. Whatever it was it was going to have to wait. - Two hours after they left, Clint and Eris rematerialized in the kitchen. The two of them clutching an assortment of random junk. Well, that's what it looked like to Bruce who was making a sandwich. \"You two back already?\" he called. \"Why? Were you missing me that much?\" Clint replied. Bruce snorted. \"Did you unearth anything useful?\" Natasha asked as she walked up to Clint. \"Look at this,\" He led her to the kitchen table and showed her the tablet. \"This image here.\" Clint zoomed in on a section of the photo and showed it to her. \"Is that who I think it is?\" \"I'm not sure, but if that's who it might be there is a whole lot more at stake.\" \"We're going to have to show to Fury.\" \"He's gonna flip.\" She shrugged. \"I'll tell him then.\" \"I'm not scared of him, I'm just saying that he might have that massive aneurism he's been heading for.\" She touched his face. \"Don't worry, I believe you.\" She took the tablet off him and sashayed away. He sighed and followed him. - Bruce looked at Eris, she was leaning against the work top clutching a small clay pot. Her face was grey and her breathing was irregular. \"Are you alright?\" He asked her moving to her side. \"No, I'm... feeling just a bit... just a bit drained.\" She looked at Bruce. \"Teleporting long distances is... draining.\" She tried to straighten herself up but ended up slumping against Bruce. He put his arm against her to try and steady her. \"Is everything alright?\" Steve asked as he walked into the kitchen. \"Just peachy.\" Eris retorted. Steve looked to Bruce for an actual explanation. \"Magic overuse apparently,\" Steve just looked at him blankly, so he went on. \"Teleportation and whatever else she's done magic wise has drained her physically.\" \"Ok.\" \"Is there anywhere I can rest, tall, red, white and blue?\" Steve ignored her, \"Right, I'll take her to one of the spare rooms.\" He told Bruce. \"Still in the room.\" She called out, her eyes shut and her head lolling against Bruce's shoulder. \"Can you walk?\" He asked her. \"I'll probably need a hand.\" She told him. Steve wordlessly put his arm around her waist as she put her arm around his waist and pulled her off Bruce. He looked at Steve gratefully. Steve nodded in rely before he half dragged the Goddess of Chaos to the lift. - In the lift, he lent Eris up against the wall as he pressed the floor number on the panel and then stood in the centre of the lift. \"You really don't like me, do you?\" she asked him. \"It's not a question of like, ma'am.\" He replied. Eris noticed he was going into the automatic solider mode. She couldn't resist pressing his button. esspically on someone who seemed so slight laced as he was. \"Is it because you are a solider and I represent chaos, a disruption to your orderly and controlled lift?\" \"My life is far from controlled, ma'am.\" \"But you try to be though, the calm in the centre of the storm right? The leader everyone can look to.\" She looked at Steve who didn't respond. \"But then the country where you take your name from is far from that, isn't. Slaverly, genocide on one that one occasion, the oppression of others. Does that say something about you?\" \"Look!\" He slammed his arm on the lift wall above her head, she didn't even flinch. \"I work for the good of this planet. To make the future a better place for everyone. To stop people like your boyfriend from destroying and taking the lives of innocents, regardless of if their American or not.\" She stared at him, watching the anger dance across his face. \"You're an idealist then. An idealistic solider.\" She seemed to chew the words around her mouth. \"Idealists are dangerous men. Believe me, I've known a few. They bring down empires, destroy regimes and led men to their deaths.\" Steve didn't move, he was trying to process what she words. She was goading him. \"You remind me of Achilles,\" She continued, she voice took on a note of sadness, \"His mother dipped him in the fires of the Styx, so he was invincible everywhere apart from his ankle which his mother held as she dipped him in the river. Just make sure no one gets to your Achilles' heel.\" \"What the hell is that suppose to mean?\" \"Nothing.\" she murmured against the lift wall. Steve exhaled, annoyed. He had no idea what her game was but he sure as hell wasn't going to play it. \"Come on.\" He helped her up and half carried her to the nearest empty bedroom and dropped her on the bed and she kicked off her heels. \"Tony and Bruce are going to want to see you in the lab at some point.\" His reply was something muffled into a pillow, so he left her to sleep. More action to come... Bromancing, shape shifting, explosions and coffee.A typical day in the Avenger Towers. (See the end of the chapter for notes.) \"Eris.\" A voice beckoned. She felt a finger trace along her jawbone. \"Eris, my love.\" It called again. Her eyelids fluttered open to see Loki led next to her; his cold blue eyes stared at her with adoration. \"How long have you been watching me?\" He grinned at her. \"Urgh! You creep!\" she smiled back; her voice was free from any venom. \"You know me so well.\" He laughed grabbing hold of her and pulling her on top of him. She giggled. \"Loki.\" She pulled herself up to reach his face. Their faces barely touching. \"I love you.\" He told her as he placed his lips on hers. Something felt wrong. Eris jerked away from him. Everything was wrong. The feel of his lips, the blue in his eyes, the fact he said he loved her. She knew Loki and this wasn't him. \"What's wrong?\" the imposter asked. Eris looked her, she was in a bed in a room that was somewhere between familiar and strange. She was in her sub conscious or someone else's. \"Let's skip the wet dreams, I prefer it when I'm the one creating the fantasy, the one with the riding crop so to speak.\" The image of Loki looked almost surprised. \"Who are you? Really, I know you're not the Loki.\" \"Was I really that bad?\" \"I'll give you bonus points for effort.\" The Loki ignored her, \"Since there's no need for theatrics.\" The bed rived and shook around her, trapping Eris and stopping her from moving. \"Tell me how to open the box.\" \"What box?\" she replied innocently. The sheets tightened around her, forcing the air out of her lungs. \"Don't.\" The fake Loki told her. \"Now tell me how I can get the box open.\" \"Why?\" The sheets tightened again. \"Tell me!\" they demanded. Eris laughed. \"All this trouble and you can't get to it!\" She continued laughing as the sheets started choking her again. \"Loki, or whoever you are, you are wasting your time! Let me go and give me back what's mine.\" \"No!\" Eris saw the image of Loki blurred for a split second. She smiled. \"Oh, what are you going to do then?\" \"Not what I'm going to do, what are you going to do. You are going to tell me exactly what I need to do.\" \"By torturing me? Remember, whoever you are, this is the dream world.\" \"Which I control!\" \"You can't control the raw sub-conscious,\" the sheets feel from around her. The Loki looked worried. \"It's pure chaos.\" She purred. She walked towards the Loki, her hands glowing. The Loki threw something on the ground and everything fell away. - Eris bolted upright in bed. Something moved in the corner of her eye. She threw a knife at it. \"You missed.\" It was Natasha. Eris looked up to see her knife wedged into the wall two inches away from Natasha's head. \"What are you doing in here?\" Natasha looked at the pile of clothes and a pair of lace up boots. \"It's hard to fight in heals.\" Eris moved on the bed. \"That's not the only reason you're here.\" She stated Natasha sat on the bed, mimicking Eris's movements. \"I wanted to see if you were ok.\" Eris raised an eyebrow. \"If you need anyone to talk to you know where I am.\" Natasha tried to sound earnest. Hopefully Eris would pick up on that and let her be her confidant. Eris found it refreshing not being interrogated for once.\"Loki is not working alone for definite.\" \"Anyone you could identify?\" \"A magic user of some sort. They invaded my sub-conscious when I was asleep, posing as Loki.\" \"How did you know it wasn't him?\" \"Believe me, I know Loki.\" Natasha smirked at that, despite the idea of physically being close to Loki made her stomach churn. \"His partner isn't a telepath or they would already have what they wanted already.\" \"What did they what?\" \"What do you think?\" She said sarcastically, grabbing a black vest top from the pile Natasha brought in. \"How to open the containment box the apple is in.\" She started getting changed. \"They didn't find out, I'm guessing.\" \"Of course they didn't,\" Eris smiled. \"the idiot thought they were in control.\" \"And you showed them they weren't.\" Eris smiled at Natasha. \"By the way, Stark wants you in the lab, ASAP.\" \"Then I'll have time for breakfast.\" This time Natasha smiled genuinely. I wasn't that she didn't like Stark but he was a dick sometimes. - \"Ah! Princess, you finally decided to join us!\" Tony exclaimed as Eris walked into the lab. \"It's frustrating when someone does that to you. Right Tony?\" Pepper asked as she walked passed him. Tony narrowed his eyes at her. \"Hi, I'm Pepper,\" She offered Eris her hand. Eris shook it. \"I've heard of you, one of the most successful CEOs Stark Industries has ever seen.\" Pepper blushed. \"Well...\" \"Don't be humble, you put up with him.\" Eris nodded in Tony's direction. \"That I do. Now I really must get going, I have this crazy schedule today.\" \"That's no problem; it was nice to meet you.\" \"Bye,\" she turned her to Tony. \"Bye Tony.\" Pepper turned on her heels and left the lab. He waited till Pepper had left, then he turned to face Eris and her holier than thou expression. \"See the princess finally decided to turn up. And stay away from Peeper.\" Tony's lip sneered as he spoke. \"I can see you haven't forgiven me for what happened earlier.\" Eris knew he hadn't, part of her didn't blame him. \"Yeah, like you're actually sorry.\" Tony wandered over to the workbench, \"By the way, is there like a thing where all you alien gods speak like you part of the British Royal family, like you know Wills and Kate?\" \"Probably because we are all members of A royal family, genius.\" Tony's lip twitched in response. She looked over at the helmet on the other desk, a deep gouge in the right eye slot. \"Is that why you wanted me down here?\" \"Okay.\" Tony rubbed the back of his neck. \"Need your energy signature to find your magic fruit.\" \"Okay, how?\" Eris looked at him, he looked exhausted, and pissed off. \"Do some magic and shit and this,\" he patted a metal box \"will measure the signature it and we'll use it to match with the energy given off by the magic banana.\" \"It's an apple.\" \"So, Princess?\" \"You know I wasn't going to kill you, with the whole taking your heart out your chest? I just needed to talk to the avengers as quickly as possible.\" \"Sure didn't feel like it, Princess.\" \"Stop calling me princess, Stark.\" She warned \"Why? It's what you are.\" Tony quipped, sounding more than a bit like a child. Eris sighed, \"It what my father calls me or he used to.\" Eris folded her arms across her chest and examined the floor. \"At least your father gave a shit.\" Tony bit back, annoyed at how hurt she looked. He'd had enough of people blaming their past for being assholes. Eris snorted. \"Gave a shit!? I knew Howard and he was actually a good man, something you don't find in this line of work.\" She let those words sink in. \"My father spent most his time fucking anything which moved and ignoring his wife, MY mother. And the rest of it simply being a fucking prick.\" Eris took a deep breathe, she had known Howard and he wasn't a bad man, especially compared to the high and mighty Zeus. \"Do you know how many half brothers and sisters I have? How humiliated my mother was every time he introduced some glorious little bastard to court?\" She took a step towards Tony, he didn't move and Eris looked into his hazel eyes. \"Now will you stop calling me princess.\" \"Daddy issues. It's practically a requirement to save the world.\" Eris's mouth quirked up slightly \"That and magic powers and luckily a ton of money.\" Tony grinned at her, still she knew she was far from forgiven. \"Yeah, that really does help.\" \"Hi guys.\" Bruce called as he walked into the lab, \"I'm not interrupting anything?\" \"I'm just about to do some magic and shit, so you're just in time.\" she said to him and Tony laughed. \"Okay.\" \"Ready?\" \"Just a sec, JARVIS turns on the radiation containers.\" \"The what?\" Eris exclaimed. \"Don't worry.\" Bruce mouthed. \"I'll man the machine then Tony if you want to get the monitor.\" \"Sure thing,\" Tony wandered over to a flat screen. \"Dummy on stand-by.\" A robot like the ones that build cars moved closer to Eris, she regarded it with a wary look. \"Eris, do your thing.\" Eris breathed deeply and summoned the energy from her surroundings, concentrating it into a single point. She closed her eyes and sculpted the energy with her mind. She opened her eyes to see a perfect scarlet lily floating mid-air. Bruce and Tony stared at her bug eyed. But then sparks started spitting out of the box, followed by a huge waft of black smoke. \"Damn!\" Bruce shouted jumping away from the work bench. \"Shit, SHIT!!\" The machine Tony called Dummy rolled up the bench and showed in it foam. \"You blew my machine up!\" Tony accused. Eris shrugged then she picked up the lily off the floor. Bruce laughed as he pinched the bridge of his nose. \"That was pretty amazing, you created an organism out of nothing!\" \"It's a party trick,\" She handed the lily to Bruce, \"If you put it into water it should live for the next few weeks or so.\" \"Thanks,\" Bruce went to hunt down an empty coffee cup to fill with water. \"Tony, I think she overloaded it, blew the sensors to hell\" \"That's what happens when you underestimate me.\" \"Will not be doing that again.\" Tony took the metal frame off the box to expose the charred remains of circuit boards and melted wires. \"Need a hand?\" \"Yeah, hand him that screwdriver.\" Bruce said, hiding a smirk, nodding to the screwdriver on the bench next to her. Eris picked it up and offered it to Tony. \"I don't like being handed things.\" Tony looked at the screwdriver as if it was a poisonous snake. \"Seriously?\" Eris raised her eyebrow at him. \"Seriously.\" \"Then catch.\" Eris threw it at him and Tony fumbled to catch it. \"Hey!\" \"What? You wouldn't take it.\" Bruce sniggered. \"Stop it, thought we were bros!\" Tony exclaimed. \"And now you're on her side!\" \"Sorry bro, you had it coming.\" This time Eris giggled. Tony huffed and tried to wipe the bench dry. After about ten minutes of tinkering with it, Tony turned to Eris who had perched herself on a nearby work bench and was fiddling with a piece of tech he had been working on. She was hot, no doubting that but fucking nuts. What did Loki see in her? A kindred crazy alien? No harm in him asking. \"What was the sex like with Loki?\" \"Pardon?\" Eris put down the circuitry and turned to him. Bruce shrank back behind the screen, where he had been trying to retrieve some data. \"You know, sex with Loki, he seems like he's be into, you know.\" \"No, I don't know.\" She replied innocently, she knew full well what he was hinting at. \"He just seemed like he'd like the freaky stuff.\" A broad grin spread across her face. \"Like you wouldn't imagine.\" \"Would I?\" Tony smirked. \"Well, you might. We're both magic users, so it wasn't just...\" she trailed off, teasing him. \"Just want?\" He asked. \"She leaned towards Tony and whispered, \"We weren't always the same gender.\" Tony looked at her confused as he watched a thin mist engulf her. Bruce stared from behind the screen and reached for his phone. In her place sat a man, lean but muscular, his jaw was angular and he was clean shaven apart from a mane of unruly black hair and a pair of dark bushy eyebrows. From under the bushy eyebrows a pair of golden eyes shone at Tony. So this was Eris as a guy, he thought. He still had a female Eris' plump lips and those eyes seemed to be searing his flesh. Tony swallowed hard. \"So are we talking guy on guy? Loki as a woman? Girl on girl?\" \"All of the above.\" Male Eris replied in a deep voice, Tony half expected to hear Eris's woman's voice. \"That sounds awesome.\" Male Eris smile before turning back into her normal form. She could see the desire in him almost double when she took her male form. Most likely because of the endless possibilities she had shown him. \"By the way this thing isn't going to work unless you re-route the power distribution.\" She held up the strange looking metal object she'd been playing with. Tony came over to her and looked at it. He had trouble getting the enough power to the boosters, that's what caused him to spend the last few days in the workshop. Could the answer really be that simple? It was. \"Yeah, I knew that, I was gonna sort it then you kinda turned up and ripped my heart out.\" \"I gave it back.\" Eris held her hand out for him to give it back to her. He purposely placed it on the other work bench. \"Stay away from my stuff.\" He told her as he turned his back to her. Stark was such a child, then again his father hadn't been much better, she thought. She sighed and stared at the tools fixed to wall, trying not to think of Loki as a woman or Loki as anything but bloody and broken. - Clint's phone beeped in his pocket. Fury glared at him from across the table. \"Are you gonna answer that?\" It wasn't a question it was a demand. Clint pulled his phone out and unlocked the screen. \"It's from Banner; he's in the lab with Stark and Eris.\" \"And?\" He always knew they were more. \"Apparently Eris can shape shift, she turned into a guy, well a guy version of herself in the lab.\" \"So she's a shape shifter.\" Natasha confirmed. \"Doesn't that make her more of an asset?\" \"When she's on our side yes but she goes against us.\" \"Will she?\" Natasha asked \"She's been living under the radar for a century maybe more, she said she only came to us because we stopped Loki before.\" \"Eris has also been stock piling weapons of mass destruction, which got into the wrong hands.\" \"I doubt we have the power or the resources to contain an entity such as Eris, plus we have no relations what so ever with her home world. Imprisoning her could bring an invading army.\" Maria Hill stated. \"Okay, its agreed we keep the Alien happy and on our side.\" Director Fury, he looked expectantly at Clint and Natasha, \"Anything else to report?\" \"According to Eris, she was visited in a dream by another magic user posing as Loki, they apparently demanded to know how to open the box than contains the apple. This means we have more time to locate it.\" \"That buys us some extra time, Clint what can you tell us about Eris's contact?\" \"They are not a threat, not by a long shot.\" Fury looked at him expectantly. \"I can't reveal anymore.\" He felt Natasha look at him puzzled. \"This is the intel I got from them.\" He pushed the tablet towards Maria and Fury and watched as they scanned through the images. \"Look at this one.\" Natasha took the tablet at enhanced the photo Clint had showed her. \"Is that who I think it is?\" Fury asked, his one eye bulging. \"Without further enhancement we can't be sure.\" Maria told him. \"But if it is him.\" \"If that is Victor von Doom, we need to shut him and Loki down as quickly as possible.\" Fury looked around the table at his agents. \"Hill, I want all the intel on Doom's last known whereabouts and cross reference them with what we know of Loki and what is on this tablet.\" He handed the tablet to her and she nodded in response. \"I want you two to keep eyes on the Alien and prepare that others for what we are up against.\" Clint and Natasha nodded in unison and rose to leave the table. In the corridor Natasha grabbed Clint's arm. \"Hey!\" he called out. \"Why are you protecting her contact?\" she asked, good old Natasha, never beating around the bush. \"She asked me to.\" \"So it's not just because they gave you a new toy.\" She was referring to his new bow. \"It's because I have to, you and I both know SHIELD aren't as white as white.\" He knew he couldn't physically tell Natasha the truth, even if he wanted to. Her features hardened for a moment. \"That was nice of you.\" \"Nice had nothing to do with it.\" Natasha arched her eyebrow at this. \"I was going the right thing for once.\" He sighed. Natasha took his hand in hers for a second, her soft fingers rubbed the callouses on his. He looked at her and he knew she'd drop it and decide to trust him. He just hoped that trust wasn't misplaced. \"How's the whole BBF routue going with Eris?\" \"She doesn't trust me, but she is confiding in me.\" \"So I'm not going to find you two doing each other's nails and talking about boys.\" Natasha looked up at him and raised both her eyebrows, silently saying \"Seriously.\" - The machine gave a trumpet beeping sound. \"We have it!\" Tony shouted, high fiving Bruce. \"At last.\" Eris sighed, handing another lily to Bruce, this time it was blue. There was nearly a whole bouquet sticking out of a discarded coffee cup. \"Not exactly,\" Bruce told her, \" We need to virtually scan the globe looking for a similar signature.\" \"Have you tried cross referencing them with SHIELD's information and I've given them.\" \"Already on it.\" Tony said, Eris looked at him. \"I have SHIELD's data already uploaded.\" He explained. \"Hacked is a better word for it.\" Bruce corrected. \"Yeah, but that sounds bad.\" \"And you don't want to do anything bad, do you?\" \"I'm a superhero, people look up to me.\" \"The poor misguided fools.\" Chimed Eris. \"Hey, you can't talk!\" Tony pointed an accusing finger at her, \"You were worshiped!\" \"What can I say, who doesn't want a cow sacrificed in their honour?\" \"Vegetarians.\" Tony answered. \"Don't forget the vegans.\" Bruce pointed out. \"Do you two have an answer for everything?\" Eris asked. \"No, we just find it.\" \"That's science baby!\" hollered Tony. Eris laughed. After a few moments of silence she asked, \"What now?\" \"We wait.\" Bruce replied. \"It will tell us when we find anything.\" \"Yeah, it makes the shit scary sound. Till then I'm gonna reroute the power distribution.\" Tony held up the gadget Eris was playing with earlier. \"Okay, in that case I think I'll get myself a cup of coffee.\" Eris headed towards the lab doors. \"Hold up, I'll come with you.\" Bruce picked up the flowers in their makeshift vase. \"I wanna put these somewhere they won't get wreaked.\" Eris smiled as she held the door open for him. \"Should I ask what was going on when I can in?\" \"No.\" she replied flatly. \"Kay.\" He looked like a kicked puppy and Eris felt guilty. He did seem to be trying to help her in the conference room. \"We were just talking.\" \"About the whole...?\" Bruce made a gesture to his chest. \"Sort of.\" \"I was meaning to ask you, Are all they stories true? You know the myths and legends?\" Eris laughed, almost relieved. \"Some are more accurate than others, but there is a bit of truth in all of them.\" \"Got any examples?\" \"Oh where's the fun in that?\" \"That's cruel.\" Bruce joked. \"Well, I wasn't known for my mercy.\" she chuckled> - \"Lady Eris!\" Eris turned to see Thor walking towards her, still wearing his Asgardian clothes. \"Prince Thor, how are you?\" \"I need to have a word with you.\" \"Okay.\" \"In private.\" He led Eris out onto the balcony. Eris already knew what this was about. \"What is it, Thor?\" \"My brother, Eris.\" Thor didn't look at her, instead he gazed out onto the New York skyline. \"He had done some terrible things but I cannot allow you to kill him.\" \"I didn't say I was going to kill him.\" \"You might as well have said so, I will not allow you to torture my brother, he will face Asgardian justice for his crimes.\" \"Didn't you try that last time and he somehow got away?\" Eris saw Thor's jaw clench. \"It will not happen again, he will be punished.\" \"But as a member of the royal family he will not be executed for his crimes.\" \"No, he will not, but.\" Thor sighed, \"Eris my brother may not be fully in control of his situation, like you said you're not sure he's the one who attacked you.\" \"You really are grasping at straws here.\" \"What else am I to do? I let him fall.\" Eris placed her hand on Thor's shoulder to comfort him. \"He fell by his own hand.\" \"Thank you Eris, although it makes no difference to how I feel.\" Thor turned to look at her. \"How do you know about Loki's fall? My brother rarely took anyone into his confidence.\" Eris shrugged. \"He must care about you.\" Eris felt a cold hand grab hold of her heart as Thor uttered those words. \"How can you say that when my home was broken into and I was beaten half to death, by his command most likely.\" \"You don't know that for sure.\" \"Yes, but he was defiantly involved.\" \"It seems that way.\" Thor paused then smiled at Eris, \"Maybe you would have been my little sister if events had been different.\" \"I already have a big brother and already have enough siblings to be worrying about.\" She turned to look at Thor, he was grinning. She felt like an idiot. \"You were suggesting me and Loki getting married weren't you?\" \"Yes.\" \"Thor, are you trying to suggest I shouldn't kill Loki, I should marry him instead?\" \"I was..\" he made a defeated face. \"Yes, I was.\" \"You are not as silver tongued as you brother, that is for sure.\" She looked up at Thor, \"I promise I will not kill your brother.\" \"Not to insult you but your word is not binding.\" Eris was waiting for this. \"Then you're either going to have to trust me or try and stop.\" \"By the All Father I will, Eris.\" \"At last! You've stopped calling me 'Lady'. Now if you don't mind, I believe my coffee is getting cold.\" With that she turned and left. - \"Sulking are we?\" Loki didn't need to turn his head to know who it was. \"Thinking,\" he corrected. \"You might need to try it, as I have helped you steal one of the most powerful weapons there is, but you have failed to actually remove it from its box, making it completely useless. Also we have an angry goddess out of blood. My blood to be precise.\" \"Really Loki, you have a penance for being over dramatic.\" \"Funny, I thought I was stating the current situation.\" \"You are right about your girlfriend, Loki.\" Doom took pride in seeing Loki's jaw clench, \"She is powerful, I entered her subconscious as you and she knew it was me, funny that.\" Loki choose not to stoop to his level. \"Did you learn how to open the box?\" \"No.\" \"Well done, I do believe Eris is the only one who can open it, and your men let her escape.\" \"The plan wasn't to take her as you know.\" \"But we need her here now, and she wants her toy back.\" \"You plan to lure her here. Let's do it.\" This has been slightly re written as most of what I wrote annoyed me.Eris and Loki, a love that will transcend everything? Probably not, let's be realistic.Tony and Steve? will the ship sail?find out next chapter... Clint finds a noted hidden in the bow, sent from Eris's contact. (See the end of the chapter for notes.) Clint drew back the bowstring and fired. The arrow sailed into the bull eye and split the shaft of the arrow already imbedded in the target. The bow worked like a dream, although Clint knew most of it was down to his skills. Clint placed the bow of the bench to get some more arrows when the bow started clicking. \"What the hell?!.\" Clint watched in horror as the bow seemed to come apart. The screws slowly unscrewing themselves from the bow's frame. Clint felt like he was trapped in a horror movie. \"Don't tell me you've broken it already?\" Natasha called as she walked towards him, taking off a pair of cancelling headphones. The screws had unscrewed themselves and the frame began to fall apart. Shit! It's a fucking bomb. Clint thought. \"GET DOWN!\" he shouted tackling Natasha to the floor, covering her body with his. He waited for the heat, flying shrapnel and loud noise anything. But nothing came. He gave it a few more seconds. Still nothing. \"Get off me.\" Natasha barked. Clint got up gently and offered Natasha his hand. She ignored it and stood up. \"What was that?\" \"The bow, it went weird,\" Natasha looked unimpressed. He sighed. \"The screws started unscrewing on their own and when the frame started to fall apart, I thought it was a bomb.\" Natasha looked over his shoulder at the bench. He was right, the bow was now in pieces but it wasn't a bomb. She walked over and looked at the inside of the frame. It was a lightweight bow so obviously it was hollow but this one had a wedge of paper rolled up and wedged inside it. \"Jesus Christ.\" Clint's face fell when he saw the bow, completely broken. Then he saw the paper in Natasha's hand. \"What's that?\" Natasha unravelled the paper to show him what was on it. The message read: \"Secure line call ************\" \"Inventive way for someone to give you their number.\" Natasha said looking at Clint for any clarification. Clint looked puzzled. \"It's Eris's contact, they gave me the bow, and they're trying to contact me.\" \"You can actually say their name, Clint.\" Clint said nothing but that look on his face told her he was hiding something. \"You wanna call?\" he asked attempting to change the topic slightly. \"If they could have more information on what we're up against the yes we should.\" \"I'll call the others then, they're probably gonna need to hear this.\" \"Yes.\" Clint took that as his que to contact the rest of the team. Natasha cocked her head to the side, a habit she picked up when addressing the AI butler. \"JARVIS, can you give me a location on Eris?\" ~Yes Agent Romanoff, she appears to be in the kitchen drinking her fifth cup of coffee.~ \"Thanks JARVIS, can you tell me if anyone is with her currently?\" ~No one at the moment, her mood seems to be keeping everyone at bay. Anything else I can help you with?~ \"No thanks JARVIS.\" She found it unnerving when JARVIS made jokes, the sarcasm fitted the English accent but coming from a robot it just sounded strange. Clint put down his phone and turned to Natasha. \"Five minutes, where hid from guests.\" \"The hidden conference room?\"\"Yep, although it does sound cooler when you call it the secret room.\" \"Not it doesn't.\" she corrected him. \"It does, come on.\" - \"You're telling me you found this phone number in your bow this 'contact' gave you?\" Tony asked sarcastically. \"Yes, they probably have more information from us.\" Natasha asked. \"Or they wanted Legolas as a booty call.\" \"Would that have to work the other way around?\" Tony sent Bruce a look. \"I mean wouldn't they need Clint's number to call him for a booty call?\" \"Let's just ring the number.\" Steve interjected. Tony dialed the number and put the phone on speaker. The ringer tone seemed to go on forever as the avengers stood and sat awkwardly in the badly lit secret conference room. Then someone picked up. \"You got my message, Hawkeye.\" Boomed a deep masculine voice. It was a statement not a question. \"Yeah, but did you really have to destroy the bow in the process?\" \"Ha, sorry about that, it was a means to an end, I am right in assuming you are not alone?\" \"No, he is not, I am Captain America and you are talking with the Avengers.\" Steve spoke up. \"Captain America, it is an honour, and the same to the rest of the Avengers.\" The voice boomed. Tony turned to Bruce and mouthed \"I know that voice.\" Bruce looked back at him and handed Tony the tablet for him to trace the call. \"We have been lead to believe you have information regarding the golden apple and the whereabouts of terrorist Loki.\" Steve continued. \"Yes I do, this information is regarding the apple, and there are some things I am sure Eris neglected to tell you. She means no malice but she is selfish, here main concern here is revenge on Loki and reclaiming what is hers, which is why she enlisted your help. The millions of lives at stake and Earth is not one of her priorities.\" \"We've noticed.\" Steve clenched his jaw, remembering the conversation he had with her in the lift. \"What else can you tell us.\" \"I'm sure you know the Apple is a weapon, which once activated becomes a bomb incapable of massive destruction, I doubt that whoever has it knows of its true power. And by now I am assuming the plan is to get the apple before active. But I am offering you a plan B, one that might me better in the long run than Plan A.\" \"Don't leave us in suspense.\" Clint muttered. The man on the phone sighed, \"The apple can be destroyed if Eris absorbs its power. This will stop the apple from being of any use.\" \"That seems possible, Eris manipulates energy, I theory she can absorb the energy of the apple, making it more stable.\" Bruce clarified. \"So we can't just destroy the apple?\" \"It will do that by exploding.\" The voice on the phone growled. \"Energy can be destroyed or created, it just changes form. So if Eris absorbs the energy, it's less likely to change from chemical to more violent forms of energy. I think that's what he's trying to tell us anyway.\" Bruce looked at Steve's still confused face; he got the gist of what Bruce was trying to tell him anyway. \"Correct, Dr Banner.\" The voice boomed. \"The problem is that Eris herself has to choose to absorb the apple, she most likely won't, considering the consquences.\" \"Why aren't you trying to convince her to do this?\" Natasha asked. \"Like I told you, she is selfish. And the consequences for absorbing the power of the golden apple aren't pleasant.\" \"I don't mean to sound rude but can you tell us what will happen?\" Steve demanded. \"She'll most likely die.\" The voice stated simply, although a note of sadness coloured his statement. \"The power would be too much for her to contain and it would kill her body, maybe causing a much smaller and less harmful explosion of only a few feet.\" \"Can she actually die?\" Bruce asked. \"Yes.\" No other information was offered. Steve was silent for a moment so Natasha took over. \"How do we get her to absorb the apple if she doesn't want to?\" \"I gave her a small clay pot when she and Hawkeye came to visit me, Don't ask the poor man about it. Eris made sure he can't talk about it.\" Everyone turned to look at Clint who pretended they weren't. \"She thinks the pot contains hell hounds, it doesn't. It contains a substance which will enforce Eris to absorb it. It will not control her mind but once the apple touches her skin the energy transfer, as Dr Banner put it, will begin.\" \"This apple is mean to drive people insane to possess it.\" Natasha stated, recalling what Eris told them when she first arrived. \"Only if contact is made with it.\" The voice replied. \"That is all I can tell you for now.\" The voice became amused. \"Mr. Stark, did you manage to find me?\" Tony looked up from the tablet in mild shock. \"Still working on it.\" He replied. In fact he had run into two dead ends as the signal jumped around the globe. \"One more thing.\" Steve said, his brow creased. \"Why are you doing this to help us?\" There was a few seconds pause on the other end of the line. \"This is war. The life of one person does not and will not out weight the lives of millions of others, especially when that one person has the ability to save those lives.\" Steve thought of the friends he'd lost in combat, most of all Bucky. \"Thanks for your help.\" \"Just stop it.\" The voice told him before discontenting. Steve lent against the table and sighed. \"You alright there, Cap?\" Tony asked, any concern from Tony was rare. \"Yeah, I'm fine.\" Steve ran his hand through is hair. \"Did you find out where he was calling from?\" \"Nope,\" Tony looked pissed off at that. \"The bastard bounced the call off hundreds of servers. But I do know that voice from somewhere.\" Steve made an effort to look like he knew what Tony was talking about. \"He's most likely family to her.\" Natasha stated. \"The way he spoke about her hinted at unconditional love, the type family members show for one another.\" \"Any ideas on who that might be, Bruce.\" Bruce suddenly found himself as the Avengers' official Greek Mythology expert. \"I.. I'm not sure really, according to myths she had a pretty huge family.\" \"Okay, no worries, but how are we going to get the pot of powder off her?\" Steve asked. \"She's not going to hand it over nicely.\" Natasha took a small clay pot out of her pocket and showed it to her team mates. \"Took it while she was asleep.\" \"Nice.\" Clint called. She smiled back. \"Did that guy say something about hell hounds being in that pot?\" Tony asked. \"Yes, the magic of Olympus is strange and unusual, I would guest it contains the hell hounds in powder form, which Eris would summon when needed. Apparently they can grow to the size of a Midgardian white bear.\" \"Powdered? Like a cup-a-soup?\" Clint asked \"I am not aware what that is.\" \"Nether mind.\" \"Right. Tony have the scanners picked up on anything?\" Steve asked. \"Nothing major as of yet.\" He leaned back in the chair and stared at Steve with these dark brown eyes. \"I'll tell you if I do.\" \"Okay thanks, let's go and act like normal. Tell Eris nothing.\" Steve told them as they filed out the room. He'd long given up on telling them they were dismissed. The jokes weren't worth it. thanks for reading! For anyone who doesn't know what a cup-a-soup is, I'm not sure if their just a British thing. But it's a sachet of dried/powdered soup that you add hot water to and drink from a mug. The Apple is located in Doctor Doom's compound. The battle plans are drawn and the assault begins. In battle the Avengers referred to by their code names. (See the end of the chapter for more notes.) Natasha watched as Eris laid an impressive collection of knives out on the table. Contrary to what Natasha was expecting the knives were new and plain, simple and practical. The way Eris handled them gave the impression she knew how to use them. She clearly appeared to be ambidextrous as well. Natasha almost felt sorry for Loki, almost. Natasha had bigger problems to deal with. Eris had already noticed the clay pot was missing but hadn't made a big deal out of it, claiming that whoever found it would have one big surprise before declaring she could go after Loki without it. Natasha touched the pocket were she had stowed the pot she'd taken when Eris was asleep. \"Right, from what we can tell from the satellite imagery is that Doctor Doom's compound is well guarded by a mix of sentinel robots and a few human guards on the out posts. This would make the place practically impregnable.\" Bruce told them. \"Practically?\" Clint asked, \"I like those odds.\" Steve rolled his eyes and walked over to the touch screen covered in grainy surveillance photos. \"Thanks Bruce,\" he told Bruce as he took a seat. \"Storming this place is not an option, it's too heavy guarded, so we are going in quietly.\" \"Hoping they leave a window open for us to climb through.\" Tony interrupted. Steve ignored him. \"I thinking of a two pronged attack at night. Black Widow and Hawkeye are the best at covert operations, I'm assuming from what we've seen of Eris she can do the same, so they're going in on ground level. I'll need Hawkeye on higher ground,\" Steve gestured to a slope with some tree cover near the compound. \"You will provide cover for the both Eris and Black Widow, and then join them as they after the apple.\" Clint nodded to show he understood. \"Iron man, will go for an aerial assault with the Hulk. Cause as much damage as you possibly can to the upper structure.\" \"You mean cause a distraction?\" Bruce asked. \"Yes, weaken Doctor Doom's position as much as possible then try make your way to our location.\" \"Not a bad idea, Loki is terrified of the Hulk.\" Eris said. \"That's if Loki is actually there.\" Tony told her. \"I know he is.\" She muttered darkly. Tony turned away from her evil glare, he did not envy Loki right now. \"I'll be going in with Eris, Hawkeye and Black Widow.\" He looked around the room. \"Thor I want you with Iron Man and the Hulk.\" \"No offence, but I would prefer to be with the other group.\" \"You mean the one with me on it? Are you trying to say you don't trust me?\" Eris's expression was filled with mock hurt as she flipped a clip blade into her hand before shoving it into a pocket. \"Besides Thor, you should be able to take out the compound's power generators.\" \"It's Doom where talking about, he'd have enough backup generators to last a century.\" Clint stated. \"True but before the backup kicks in it should cause panic enough for us to get further into the compound. That's actually not a bad idea, Eris.\" \"Thanks.\" \"I'll be going in with Eris and the Black Widow.\" Steve nodded to Thor, as a way of saying he'd keep Eris in check. A chorus of 'yes's swept across the room. \"Meet by the jet in ten.\" Tony called. -The jet ride had been deafening silent apart from AC/DC blaring from the speakers which no one bothered to tell Tony to turn down. But Eris would have swapped that for the creeping through the undergrowth from where the jet had dropped them off. It beat wincing every time someone stepped on a twig; unsurprisingly it was her and Captain America. Hawkeye gestured towards a tree, telling them he'd found his vantage point. Captain America nodded as Black Widow lead them through hedges and Hawkeye silently scrabbled up the tree. Black Widow gestured for Eris and Captain America to lie down. Captain America and the Black Widow produced a pair of binoculars. A chain link fence surrounded concert walls with guard towers at regular intervals. The chain link fence created a dead man's land between the outside and the inside of the compound. Captain America sighed. The fence could be climbed but they had nothing to cover the barbed wire at the top. Eris noticed the look on Captain America's face. She lent closer to him and whispered. \"It's a short distance, I can teleport us past the fence, I can see where we'd be going.\" \"Wait till I give you the signal.\" He whispered back. What kind of signal? Eris thought as she placed a hand on both Captain America and the Black Widow. Suddenly moment could be seen in the guard towers, spreading from the right to the left. Through the binoculars Captain America could see the guards dropping like flies with arrows in their foreheads. Hawkeye was doing his part, now where were the others? Seconds later Hawkeye crawled up next to them. \"Place your hand on my shoulder.\" Eris hissed. \"I'm teleporting us past the gate.\" He didn't respond but Eris felt a hand on her shoulder. \"Captain, look up.\" Natasha directed his gaze to the sky. Thick, angry storm clouds were forming above the compound. The dark massing clouds looked like dirty rages in a sink against the light of moon. Suddenly white forks of lightening spat out from between the clouds. It was Thor. Captain America breathed a sigh of relief. \"Get ready.\" He warned. Eris tightened her grip on Captain America and Black Widow. Hawkeye did the same to her. They waited for what seemed like forever watching the storm clouds grow and the air fill with static. Then it came. A huge bolt of lightning shot down from the centre of the storm, striking something beyond the compound's high walls. The light briefly showed up the outline of Thor heading towards the compound. Eris felt the lightning discharge in the Earth. She looked to the Captain. He nodded. She closed her eyes and visualised the compound gates and focused. She felt the ground beneath her slip away only to be replaced with ground under her feet. \"Christ.\" Captain America muttered. He looked around him, as Eris promised they were inside the fence. He looked at the ten foot wall in blocking their way in. \"I'm gonna give you guys a leg up.\" Captain America braced himself, cupping his hands together to them to place their feet. Black Widow when first, the Hawkeye. Eris looked at him. \"I'll teleport back for you.\" He nodded and watched as she ran towards him, feeling her foot in hands he pushed her upwards. Moments later he felt a small hand grasp his and he found himself on the other side of the wall. \"Thanks for the hand.\" She told her. - \"JARVIS I need you to take control of the jet, take it somewhere safe but not to far.\" ~In case of a quick escape, sir?~ \"Yep.\" Tony hit the lever to open the jet's loading ramp. \"Ready, Bruce?\" \"As I'll ever be.\" Bruce replied, removing his shirt. He closed his eyes and thought of General Ross. Nothing Zen or deep. Just General Ross and the years he spent on the run because of him. Then Bruce felt the rage explode in him. He opened his eyes, ran towards the open door and let out a roar. Tony looked out the open door. There was no way he could follow an entrance like that, then again he wasn't a giant green rage monster. Tony shrugged and put on his helmet and the blue visual display came alive. He wasn't the hulk, he was iron man. - Back on the ground, hell was breaking loose. Looked like the other team were living up to their half of the mission. Hawkeye thought as he fired yet another arrow into some human guard. He walked over to body to pull it out again and put it back in his quiver. He fingered his electro arrows he was saving for the sentinel guards. He was not looking forward to facing those metal bastards.Hawkeye and Captain America went to scoop around the corner. He gestured for Clint to go on. Clint turned the corner to come face to face with a humanoid drone. He let the arrow loose but it was a normal arrow and bounced off the robot's metal plating. Quickly as he could he grabbed an electro arrow his quiver and fired before the robot even registered him. As the arrow hit its metal skin, the thing twitched and rived, spitting blue sparks before hitting the deck. He looked around for another one. Nothing. \"Coast is clear.\" He called. \"We're now facing the tin can fuckers.\" \"Don't let Iron man hear you calling them that.\" Captain America told him coming up on Hawkeye's left. \"What's he gonna do?\" he replied. \"Come on!\" Eris hissed. \"The Apple is being stored underground, I can feel it!\" She was already half way down the corridor, the Black Widow just behind her. Hawkeye and Captain America shared a look before moving to catch up with them. - Iron Man hovered above the compound and aimed yet another missile into the reinforced concrete structure. He noticed the saw the Hulk was doing something similar with its bare hands. That should be enough of distraction. He thought. \"Captain,\" he called into his com, \"Where you guys heading? Thor, Hulk and me have virtually levelled this place.\" \"Heading down, there seems to be a labyrinth of tunnels down here, the above ground levels must be holding nothing important\" \"You're telling me that now!\" \"Come on, we didn't have full layout for this place, regroup with Hulk and Thor and head downwards\" \"Kay.\" He muttered in annoyance before turning off the com. - \"She's brought the Avengers with her. Still feeling confident?\" \"Why won't I? Moving the apple so the they could trace the energy signature worked.\" Doom turned his masked face to look at Loki as he paced the room. \"And once I have the power of the apple in my hands the Avengers will be nothing. Merely bugs.\" \"You're hands? We are working together; if it wasn't for me you wouldn't have the apple at all. So I suggest you start treating as an equal.\" He snarled. \"Remember what you owe me Loki, that's why you're here. Also it's your girlfriend is the only one who can open that.\" Loki sighed in frustration. \"Well, she is here. I just go and ask her nicely, shall I?\" Doom didn't rely. Loki glared at that ridiculous mask and teleported out of the room. - Eris was still taking the lead, making stupid moves without really thinking. She was motivated by anger and likely to herself killed. Black Widow sighed, she was sure Eris was going to get herself killed before they could neutralise the apple. The four of them headed towards a set of steal door. Eris placed her hand on the control pad. There was a sound of pressure being released and the doors slid open revealing a large circular room. In the centre stood Loki clad in his full battle gear, minus his horned helmet. The Avengers took cover in behind the door frame. \"Well, well, well. Eris darling, it seems you've managed to get the Avengers to help you, did you tell them we fucked on every surface in the Avenger Tower?\" Captain America made a mental note to scrub everything in the tower with bleach. Eris moved from her cover to stand in the middle of the door, purposely drawing Loki's attention to her and away from the others. \"A lady doesn't kiss and tell.\" She told him. \"And you seem to have misplaced you helmet.\" Hawkeye drew back his bow, he moved slowly to get a better shot. Black Widow was doing the same on the other side. Loki smiled at her. \"Would you believe me if I told you it was because you told me you didn't like it?\" \"No.\" \"There's simply no pleasing you.\" Hawkeye let the arrow fly. Loki's eyes darted towards it. He teleported out the way. Natasha fired him. Loki teleported again. \"You, simple beings don't learn.\" He yelled mockingly. \"I am really going to enjoy crushing you.\" Eris rolled her eyes. \"All talk and no trousers.\" She stepped forward through the doorway and placed her hand on the inner control panel. She turned to face them, her eyes burning. \"Find another route, get my apple and save the world. He is mine!\" The doors slammed shut, sealing Eris and Loki off from the Avengers. They stared at the sealed door. \"Right, you heard her, find the apple and get it way from here.\" Captain America commanded. \"Was that selfless?\" Hawkeye asked Black Widow. \"I'm not sure.\" She replied. - \"It seems you have me alone, Lady Eris.\" Loki held his arms out to gesture to the room and grinned at her. \"Yes I do.\" She took a step forward and returned his grin. \"I have you all to myself.\" The battle continues next chapter... The assault on Doom's compound continues (See the end of the chapter for notes.) They stood staring at each other, saying nothing. Each one daring the other make the first move. \"Eris, I don't really know what to say really know what to say, you have me lost for words.\" Eris's blood boiled. He had had her beaten half to death, destroyed her vault and now he stood there trying to flirt with her. \"I doubt you were expecting to find me alive.\" Her words caused something that looked like pain briefly crossed Loki's face. \"Remember when I promised I would never do anything to hurt you?\" Eris made no attempt to acknowledge Loki's words but she could clearly recall when Loki made that promise, in her home in Greece, her back pressed up against the kitchen worktop. Loki regarded her stony expression and carried on. \"I kept that promise.\" Eris walked slowly towards Loki, her eyes locked on his. She was inches from him now. \"I remember that day.\" She leaned towards in as if to kiss him. \"But I also remember you're a liar.\" She grabbed a knife and plunged it into his gut. But instead of blood, the groan of pain, Loki laughed, he knife passed threw him like air. Then he disappeared. \"Really? That was a bit cliqued. I was expecting so much more.\" His voice called from behind her. She smiled bitterly to herself and turned throwing a knife in the direction of the voice. She heard a satisfying \"Ooof\" sound then turned to see Loki pull the blade out of his right shoulder. His amour had stopped it doing any serious damage, but he was hit and distracted. Eris ran at him, throwing a creasant kick into Loki's face, quickly following it with a reverse spin kick to the side of his head. Loki stumbled back against the wall, he placed his and on the ear she'd kicked. It was ringing and throbbing. If he was lucky she hadn't perforated his ear drum. Eris grabbed her one of her larger knifes out its holster and raised her arm. Loki pushed off the wall, grabbing her raised arm and forcing it behind her back. He twisted arm back further. She a yelp of pain and the knife clattered to the floor. He pushed her up against the wall, using his weight to block any escape. She could hear her practically spitting with rage. \"Never fight angry, your anger makes you weak.\" He whispered in her ear. His cold breathe tickled her neck. She wouldn't be able to teleport without bringing him with her. She let out a deep breath as his weight forced her face further against the concrete wall. She needed to buy some time to think of something. \"So you recommend fighting bitter?\" She didn't wait for a reply. \"Still upset about being your big brother's shadow?\" Loki's response was to twister her arm further.She gasped in pain. \"I am nobody's shadow\" he hissed in her ear. \"And I am my own person!\" Eris let short laugh, her breathe made the wall she was pressed against damp. \"You're your own person.\" She repeated. \" That really explains Doctor Doom. You do know I thought we were doing alright, me and you that is.\" She concentrated on drawing the energy in the room towards her. \"So what I really need to know is why? Since you're defiantly your own person you can at least answer me that.\" \"Why? I had a debt that needed replying, one I couldn't ignore. Doom helped me escape the Chitauri once I escaped Asgard.\" \"So you're simply returning a favour.\" \"It is more complicated than that.\" \"And I was a means to an end? Did you hunt me down on the internet?\" Eris asked, she wasn't surprised although that didn't stop her from feeling hurt. Loki paused for a moment, searching for some explanation. Eris felt his grip on her arm loosen slightly. Finally he murmured, \"No, it was like that.\" Something inside Eris snapped and she sent the energy ball in to Loki's chest. Loki flew backwards and slid across the floor. Eris turned to face him and rotated her arm to get the feeling back in it. \"Don't you dare say that!\" She snarled. \"Where the fuck where you when I had a boot in my back?\" Loki groaned as he pulled himself to his feet. \"I wasn't there, that was Doom. I expected you to at least be aware of that.\" He barked indignantly. \"Why weren't you there?\" she demanded, throwing another knife at him. This one entered Loki's thigh and he fell back to his knees. Loki grunted in pain and threw his head back. Calmly he pulled the bloody knife out of his leg. \"Are you trying to torture me?\" \"Trust me, you don't know the meaning of the word.\" She spat at him. Loki looked at her sceptically. \"Answer me Loki.\" She voice grew calm. Somehow that worried Loki more. \"Where were you when I was being beat to death?\" \"I couldn't watched it.\" Loki spat the words out as if they were poisonous. \"This coming from the man who has mascaraed hundreds of people and attempted genocide.\" Loki stared at the floor to his right, saying nothing. He couldn't explain why and he didn't much feel like it right now. Then something dawned on Eris, Loki wasn't attacking her, every time she attacked he acted defensively. He wasn't letting her beat him, but he wasn't trying to hurt her. She wasn't sure what to do. \"It's Doom who wants the Apple?\" Loki's gaze levelled with hers. She took that as a yes. \"Does he know what it is and what it can do?\" \"He knows it's a source of great power one which he wants to harness to help in rule the world.\" Loki told her ambiguously. Loki saw something besides anger spark in her eyes. \"That's means he knows it powerful but he doesn't know what I really does. I guessing poor old Doctor Doom can't even get it out of its box.\" \"You guessed correctly.\" He smiled at her. Eris threw her head back and laughed manically. \"Then he'll never have it, he'll be just like Tantalus.\" Her laughter echoed around the circular room. \"I'm in a good mind to leave it with him.\" \"You really do not know what Doom is like.\" Loki told her, his jaw set to help him cope with the pain in his thigh. She looked at Loki, she almost felt guilty. Being in Doom's debt made I'm practically his pawn. Eris walked towards Loki. \"Get up.\" She told him offering him her arm for support. He looked at it for second and thought about refusing it but he took it and pulled himself up. His hand was still on Eris's arm. He looked down at it and trailed it up the length of her forearm. Her skin was soft and warm. He was surprised she hadn't jerked away. He looked at her face, her eyes were on his hand and her expression was free from anger. He let his hand trail up to cup the back of her neck, gently brushing strands of hair out of the way. He lent in to kiss her and Eris reached to meet his lips. He was pleasantly surprised when she kissed back. More so when she opened her mouth to deepen the kiss. He placed his other arm on the small of her back, pulling her in closer. Through the haze of Loki's lips on hers, the memory of what he did scuttled into her mind. The feeling she felt as she led beaten and broken on the bathroom floor. She remembered the oath she wore. She clamped her teeth down on his trapping his tongue in her mouth. The metallic taste of blood filled her mouth as she bit is tongue.He opened his eyes to look at her in surprise. Her eyes gleamed wickedly. She hadn't forgiven him and this was how she was going to punish him, By biting out his tongue. Loki's eyes hardened; there was no way he was going to let this happen. He tightened his grip on her and teleported to where Doom was. - Iron Man fired at blast after blast at the oncoming robots. Where hell were they all coming from? He thought. Suddenly a shield moved past the right of his vision, taking out two oncoming robots. \"Nice for you to join us, Cap.\" Iron Man called out as took out another robot. His scanners located Thor crushing robots with his hammer, Hulk slamming two of them together and Hawkeye and Black Widow taking out more robots on his left. No Eris. \"You're missing one.\" \"We were confronted by Loki; Eris deal with him.\" Captain America paused as he punched a humanoid robot in the face. \"Sealed her and Loki off from the rest of us and told us to get the Apple.\" \"Right, any idea where we have gotta go?\" \"Haven't you been able to be track the energy signature?\" Black Widow called. \"Not yet, JARVIS is trying to locate it now.\" ~Sir, uploading the route to the apple's energy signature.~ A map appeared in the corner of the Iron Man's screen, a red dot located where the apple's energy was strongest. \"Got it,\" He called out. \"This way.\" He gestured. The team followed Iron Man down the right hand corridor, still taking out the remaining sentinel robots. They eventually came to a sealed steel door. \"Can you open it?\" Captain America asked Iron Man. \"Come on, we have enough fire power between us to blow it into next week.\" \"Hey Captain, me and Widow will take an alternative route.\" Hawkeye nodded at the large air conditioning vent. \"Good idea.\" Captain America said. \"Good, but could you get the covers off for us, Hulk?\" The Hulk strode forward and crushed the air vent covers as if they were made of cardboard not steel. \"Thanks buddy.\" Hawkeye called, before following Black Widow into the vent. \"Now let's get this door open. They know where here so there's no need to be quiet.\" - Loki felt the ground return to under his feet and Eris's grip on his tongue loosen in shock. Quickly he threw her off him and she fell back against the concrete wall. Eris's vision swam for a second as her head collided with the wall then she looked up at Loki, his blood dripping down her chin. Eris turned her attention from Loki to the room. Yet again it was another circular room, much larger than the one she met Loki in. This one was also tiered with steps tapering down from another set of steel doors. On a table in the centre sat a dull grey box, the apple's containment box. \"It looks like you were able to shut Loki up.\" A voice chuckled. Eris searched for the owner. He was sat on a throne like chair like a king, Eris nearly rolled her eyes his delusions of grandeur and obvious megalomania. The man was wearing what appeared to be a metal suit of armour, a mask of similar design over his face and a dark green hood to finish the look. So this was Doctor Doom. Eris made no move to respond to him. The man got up off his throne and walked towards her. \"Eris, I assume.\" Eris nodded. \"I am Doctor Doom, if you didn't know already.\" She gave him her best unimpressed look. \"I see you have my apple which you stole.\" \"Ha, the word I was going to use is acquired.\" He responded arrogantly. Eris was going to enjoy what was going to happen next. \"Acquired? You tore half vault apart.\" She replied coldly. \"It wasn't easy, I lost countless men and machines in that place.\" \"Good, I will take it back and leave you to play king of the castle with your little squire Loki.\" Eris made a move for the box and as she expected Doom placed his arm out to stop her. But she didn't expect him to clasp a metal gauntlet around it. \"Not so fast, the apple is mine now.\" Eris raised her voice in annoyance, \"What in the pits of Tartarus is this?\" \"I need you to open the box for me, and this little thing,\" he taped the gauntlet and a red light came on. \"Is going to make you.\" Doom watched bemused as Eris tried to tear it off with her bare hands. \"That won't work; it's programmed so only I can remove it. And this is what it does.\" Doom clicked a button his own gauntlet. The pain caused Eris to convulse. This pain wasn't from electrocution. She could handle that. No, this pain burned threw her bones and it feel as of her flesh was burning. \"It hurts doesn't it?\" He knelt down to where she twitched on the floor. In Eris's blurring vision she saw him tap his gauntlet again. The pain stopped. Eris felt herself shaking. Doom lent a bit closer. \"Are you going to open it?\" Eris spat in his face. \"No.\" \"I said open it, you worthless little girl.\" There was an edge to Doom's voice now as he activated the gauntlet on Eris's wrist again. The pain went on for what felt like an eternity. She felt something wet running down her face. Loki looked over at the macabre scene and he winced in horror. Eris's gold blood was dripping from her nose and her eyes and it was Doom standing over her, he could see his face behind the mask but he could tell he was enjoying it. He felt sick to his stomach. Worse of all he couldn't say anything, conjure anything because the stupid bitch had bitten his tongue, not right off but enough so he couldn't speak. Loki grabbed the box the apple was in and threw it at Doom. It hit him in the back and Doom spun around to face him. \"Why are trying to do?\" He demanded. Loki gestured to his mouth. \"Oh, that's right you can't talk.\" Doom glared at him and Loki glimpsed at Eris, still twisting in pain. \"Spit it out then.\" Loki pointed to Eris, mimed death then pointed to the box and mimed 'no'. Doom stared at him then deactivated the gauntlet. \"You'd make a good mime, and you're right she's no use dead.\" Doom when to pick up the box from where it had landed and placed it back on the table. \"I thought I was a worthless little girl.\" She choked. Loki bent down next to her and looked at her, his grey eyes pleading with her to do it. \"I'm not afraid to die, especially if it's to spite someone.\" She whispered, her head then slumped against shoulder. He pressed his head on hers and tried to get a message through to her, hopefully she was unconscious enough for it to work. Eris heard a voice as everything started to go black. =He doesn't know the true power of the apple= Eris's eyes fluttered open only to be greeted with Doom's face. \"Now open the box.\" Doom told her, his finger hovering over the button on his gauntlet. \"Since you asked so nicely.\" Eris told him, she could hear noise outside the room which Doom seemed unaware of. Hopefully that was the Calvary.With the help of Loki, Eris made it to the table and placed both her hands on the box. She began chanting under her breathe. The sound so low Doom couldn't hear it. \"It was not that simple.\" He said in disbelief. \"No it wasn't.\" she told him. \"Here's your prize.\" She handed the glowing golden apple, thanking the fates that she was immune to her apple's power.Doom practically snatched it from her and held it in front of his face. Eris could see his eyes widen in awe behind the mask. The whites of his eyes began to turn gold. The apple was working its hypnotic charm on him. - Black Widow looked through the vent cover into the room. Loki was leant against a table, obviously in pain, most likely from an injury to the mouth judging from the blood drippimg down his chin. Eris was stood me with a similar blood stain around her mouth; a gold liquid seemed to be running down from her nose and eyes, most likely from some form of haemorrhaging. Black Widow assumed the blood on Eris was Loki's and the gold liquid was most likely her own alien blood. Both she and Loki looked like death warmed up. But it was Doctor Doom who attracted her attention. He back was to her, but his face was lit up by a bright golden light which had to be the Apple. \"Captain, I've got eyes on Eris, Loki and Doom. Eris and Loki are injured, posing little threat. Doom has the apple.\" \"I hear you, Black Widow, we'll join you in a sec, and you and Hawkeye know the plan.\" Black Widow shifted around and kicked the vent cover off the wall. It can off with one kick and Black Widow pushed herself through, pistol drawn. She heard Hawkeye land next to her. Doom turned in surprise and Black Widow fired the entire clip at Doom. The bullets bounced off the armour. \"You can't stop me now Avengers!\" Doom declared although his eyes never left the apple. Hawkeye aimed for the centre of Loki's forehead and fired. Eris saw him and raised her hand, casting an energy shield causing the arrow to disintegrate on impact. \"Leave Loki, get the apple!\" She shouted. \"It won't be stable for long!\" The steel doors suddenly gave a deafening groan as the metal peeled like an orange skin under the Hulk's hands. The remaining Avengers flooded the room. \"The power of the Apple will destroy you all!\" Doom proclaimed, holding the apple aloft as it shone. Nothing happened. Doom look confused. Captain America sighed in relief. \"Avengers, take Doom out!\" he yelled. Hawkeye drew back his bow and sent two arrows at Doom. The arrows hit their target. The eye holes in Doom's mask. He fell back screaming. Thor threw Mjolnir, hitting Doom square in the chest. Doom flew backwards, crashing into his throne. \"Give me the apple back!\" He screamed. He reached up and pulled the arrows out of his eyes. His cries echoed around the room. \"I need it.\" The Avengers stared at Doom's ruined eyes. The blood running down his mask. He raised hand and placed it on the gauntlet on his opposite arm. He felt for the right button and pressed it. This time it was Eris who screamed. She grabbed at her hair and pulled at in desperately as she sank to the floor. \"What the actual fuck?\" Iron Man exclaimed. \"It's that thing on her wrist; we need to get it off.\" Captain America yelled. Thor held her arm out as she convulsed. \"There appears to be no lock.\" He declared as Black Widow tried to cradle her head. Loki slowly back stepped away, trying to get away from the Avengers whilst they were preoccupied. He took another step back and he hit something hard but warm. He closed his eyes and waited for the Hulk to strike. No impact came. The Hulk just roughly pushed him aside and stepped forward. Loki didn't know if he should be insulted or not. He watched the Hulk walk up to the fitting Eris and tear the gauntlet off like it was paper, leaving her skin a dark brown colour on her skin. Eris lurched forward gasping for air. \"The apple!\" \"Get the apple!\" Captain America ordered. \"Don't! Don't touch it.\" She croaked. \"Give it here.\" Doom called weakly. The loss of his eyes was starting to take its toll. \"You'll never have it, you pathetic mortal!\" Eris spat. \"I 'll use the shield.\" Captain America told them. He walked up to where the apple fell and thanked God it hadn't exploded yet. He used the edge of the shield to move the apple onto it. The thing was glowing brighter and brighter. \"Black Widow.\" He looked at her to silently convey the orders. She nodded and removed the clay pot unbroken from her pocket. She looked at Eris, her eyes were half shut from whatever pain the gauntlet had inflicted. If her source was right then this was defiantly going to kill her. Black Widow went smash it when a blade knocked it out of her hand and sent it clattering across the floor. She rubbed her hand to see Loki grinning at her from across the room. \"Brother this is no time for games, the fate of this world is hanging in the balance!\" Thor roared. Loki replied with a bored expression. Suddenly energy blasts fired wildly around the room. One hit Thor in the side. Another clipped Iron Man shoulder as the others dived for cover. \"Give me the Apple!\" Doom howled as he desperately waved some kind of gun around. \"Shut the fuck up!\" Iron Man replied, firing his own energy blast at Doom. The blast knocked Doom back and his head lolling to one side. \"Shit!\" Hawkeye exclaimed. The other avengers looked to where he was staring. The clay pot had been hit; it and nearly all of its content had been vaporized. \"The box, you idiots.\" Eris called as she pulled herself on to her knees. Right now the apple's glow had brighter, illuminating the most of the room. \"Put it in the box!\" Captain America looked over to the table, somehow trigger happy Doom had managed to destroy the clay pot, half the table and damage the box beyond any use. \"There is no box.\" He told her. \"What!?\" she asked in disbelief. \"Doom destroyed it.\" \"Well, that's fucking great.\" Iron Man called out as he tried to repair his damaged shoulder. Although there really wasn't much point considering how close he was standing next to a bomb. Eris took a deep breathe. \"You know what you have to do.\" Captain America told her. Eris showed no sign of hearing him \"Help me up.\" She ordered. Hawkeye offered her his hand. \"There will be an explosion, a small one most likely.\" She told them frankly, not meeting their eyes. The apple had now grown brighter, now admitting an almost blinding light. She looked Captain America in his bright blues. \"I don't have to do anything, I make my own choices.\" She told him. He held her stare as he offered the apple to her off his upturned shield. \"Avengers, move out.\" He ordered. Eris reached forward to take the apple. \"Loki, come brother.\" Thor called clenching his side as the Hulk tossed him over his shoulder. Of course Loki didn't reply. \"Loki!\" Thor called hoarsely. \"Just get out of here.\" Captain America ordered, as he watched Loki limp over to Eris. The light from the apple made her painful to stare at now. He turned to run for the door. Before he did he turned and saluted her. As he ran to join the others, he could have sworn he heard her chuckle. - Eris could feel the energy coming in waves off the apple, each one stronger than the last. This thing This thing was going to destroy half the planet if she didn't stop it. She gripped her teeth and closed her eyes. She felt a hand on her shoulder. She opened her eyes to see Loki in front of her. His eyes darted towards the apple and back to her, then he raised his eyebrows. \"Join me my all means,\" she shrugged, holding the apple at arm's length. Loki placed his hands over hers and locked his gaze with her's. \"Ready?\" she asked. \"We'll just give them a few seconds more.\" - They had just made it outside and above ground of the compound when they were propelled forward the blast and thrown the floor. A white light shone through every opening and gap in the compound, lighting up the night sky. Strangely no sound was made. \"Holy shit.\" Hawkeye gasped. Iron man opened his helmet. \"If that was little...\" \"Tony can you see if it's a radioactive blast?\" Black Widow asked. \"Sure.\" Iron Man closed his helmet again. \"No, nothing more than usual in Eastern Europe.\" \"Loki could still be alive, Eris also.\" Thor said desperately as he clutched his side. \"Could anyone survive that thing?\" Captain America asked. \"You really want to bet against two gods?\" Hawkeye asked. Greek mythology references- Tantalus - as punishment for killing his own son and giving it to the gods of Olympus to eat, he was condemned to be stuck in the pool of water were if he he went to drink the water, the water would always recede away from him, so he'd never drink. Also a fruit tree grew above is head, the fruit always out of his reach. So he could always see what he wanted but never have it. Tartarus- actual Greek hell, this is where people were punished for the for crimes in really horrible and unusual ways. Now that's out of the way,The series of kicks Eris throws at Loki are totally possible if thrown from one leg then the other, trust me I did martial arts for years and this move was one of my best showing off pieces. And I stole the title from one of favourite Florence and the machine songs (seven devils)Hope you enjoyed it, all my love for getting this far. In the aftermath of blast, Eris wakes up in a hospital bed and with an uncertain future. (See the end of the chapter for notes.) A black Bentley rolled up outside the Avenger Tower. A chauffer in a suit and driving gloves got out and opened the back passenger door. A tall, thick set man emerged dressed in an expensive well-tailored suit, only his beard suggested at his true orgin. \"Ah! Tony!\" He greeted Tony. \"Hey!\" Tony exclaimed as he was pulled into a crushing hug by the larger man. \"What do it call you know? Ares?\" \"Ares is fine since you know the truth now.\" Ares replied grimly. \"Yeah, if you're worried about that I've kinda make sure SHIELD won't be knowing about this meeting.\" \"Thank you, Tony.\" \"No problem, it's the least I could do for an old friend.\" Tony led him through the doors and to the lift. \"Hey, do you remember Switzerland?\" \"Some of it, yeah. Didn't you get off with some biologist or something?\" \"Probably.\" Tony shrugged remembering Maya, \"I've never asked this, but what the hell was a mercenary doing at a science convention?\" Ares laughed. \"Babysitting my little sister.\" \"You mean Eris was...\" \"Yeah, dragged me alone because she hadn't seen me in ages.\" He said with an edge of sadness. Tony thought about how many times he could have been near an alien god and not know it. His head began to hurt. \"Tell me why you stopped making weapons, you always gave me mate's rates?\" Tony sighed \"I saw first-hand what my weapon were doing and I couldn't let that happen anymore.\" \"So you saw war and became a weapon against it.\" He glanced at Tony. \"I'm impressed. Although I still think should make more weapons.\" \"What? For your mercenaries to play with? I don't think so.\" \"I prefer to call them private security providers.\" Ares corrected, smirking at Tony. \"Anyway, we shouldn't be talking business on a personal visit. \"Well dealing with Eris can sometimes feel like a job.\" \"Really?\" \"No, she hadn't done anything like this in decades but still.\" \"Yeah, still a pain in the ass.\" The lift doors opened and they were greeted by Steve. \"Hello Ares, I am Captain Rogers.\" He said offering the mountain of a man his hand. \"I expected a salute, Captain,\" he joked. \"Pleasure to meet you. If you're ever looking for contact work.\" \"Thanks. I, I'll bear that in mind. Eris is this way, in the hospital wing.\" Steve lead the way to the hospital wing. \"Good job on making Cap all flustered there.\" Tony whispered. \"I think you do that to him anyway.\" Ares replied, relishing the look of confusion dance across Tony's face. Sometimes he understood why his sister liked goading people so much. Steve stopped at a set of glass doors. \"She's in here; I'll get Doctor Banner to take you to her.\" \"Okay.\" Ares waited patiently for whoever Doctor Banner was to arrive. \"You should come to London again, I think Soho has finally recovered from your last visit.\" He told Tony. \"I doubt that, do you remember that thing?\" Tony raised his eyebrows suggestively. \"Yes, Yes. How could I forget? You were...\" Ares chuckled; it was too ridiculous to put into words. \"Listen come to London, bring the pretty captain along. He could do with letting his hair down.\" \"If you say so but the drinks are on you.\" \"You're a billionaire trying to get people to buy you drinks?\" \"That's how I stay rich.\" Tony shrugged. A small man with salt and pepper hair greeted Ares. \"Hi, I'm Dr Banner. You're here to see Eris.\" The seriousness of the reason he was here settled in again. \"Yes. I am.\" Dr. Banner shot him a sympathetic smile that reminded Ares of why he hated medical doctors. \"Follow me.\" Seemed he would he spend the day following people. He thought. \"See ya.\" Tony called. \"Yeah, bye mate.\" He called back. \"You know Tony?\" Dr. Banner asked. Ares hated small talk. \"How is my sister?\" He asked plainly. \"No longer critical, she stabled pretty quickly to be honest. But she's still hasn't regained consciousness yet.\" Ares chewed over his words for a moment. \"How did you find her after the blast?\" \"Unconscious, the apple had disappeared. I think her and Loki survived because the energy was split between two bodies instead of one.\" Ares stopped in disbelief. \"Loki?\" \"Yes,\" Dr Banner when bug eyed for a moment as he realized he'd put his foot in it. \"Uh, he helped her contain the blast. He's in a more secure room at the moment.\" He didn't fancy seeing two gods of war fighting it out. Ares swallowed his questions and followed the doctor. This Loki could wait, his sister couldn't. Dr Banner led him to a cubicle and drew back the curtain. He'd witnessed the horrors of war first hand and been drenched in the blood of his enemies more times that he remember but still the sight of his little sister lying in a hospital bed made him feel queasy. Eris was lead there in a hospital gown with a blanket pulled up to her middle. Wires emerged from her left arm and feed into buzzing machines. Her hair was unnaturally tidy, a detail which made Ares disbelieve it was actually Eris. Her face looked the worse. He could see her gold blood dried in her eyelashes and webs of gold were visible across her abnormally pale skin, where her blood vessels had burst. \"Did you have to use the powder?\" He asked the Banner. \"No, actually the pot and the powder were destroyed.\" \"So she did it by herself.\" Ares said in awe. \"Yep.\" Dr Banner replied. \"She should be awake soon, I'm not sure when...\" \"I'll stay.\" \"Okay, but if you need anything in the meantime, ask JARVIS.\" Dr Banner said with a slight grin. \"The talking robot is here?\" \"This is still Tony's place.\" Dr Banner called before he turned to leave. Ares took the plastic chair next to his sister's bed and waited. - Eris woke up in darkness. For a moment she thought she was died and she felt calm and serine. She led there not moving for what seemed like forever. Then she heard the gentle hum and buzz of machinery. The smell of disinfectant crawled up her nostrils. She sighed. So she wasn't dead. Eris forced her eyes open and they attacked by blinding white light. She clamped them shut and let out a moan. \"I see you've finally decided to join the living.\" Her brother's voice greeted her. He sounded tired. Eris gingerly opened her eyes to see her brother sat next to her in a plastic chair that was too small for his giant frame. His suit jacket was slung over the chair and his shirt sleeves were rolled up to his elbows. His face looked weary and gaunt. How long had he been here? She wondered.Eris made some unintelligible noise. \"How are you feeling?\" He asked. \"Like shit.\" \"Yeah, you took a beating there.\" \"Uh-huh, and don't I know it.\" She groaned. Ares laughed. \"Hey! You shouldn't be laughing at my pain.\" She pouted. \"Maybe if it wasn't self-inflicted.\" He countered. She paused for a moment and shifted around in her bed. \"Ares, where am I?\" He raised an eyebrow. \"You're in the medical wing of the Avenger Tower.\" \"What are you doing here?\" \"Waiting for you to come back to the land of the living.\" \"Ares, you know what I mean. They'll know your identity.\" \"They owe me, and I know Tony. He's an old friend.\" Eris saw the smirk on her brother's face and rolled her eyes. \"I'm not even going to ask.\" Eris groaned pulling her blanket over head. Ares chuckled. They sat in silence for a few minutes. Eris felt every part of her body ache, even though she was glad just to be alive. \"So, Loki of Asgard? The fallen prince?\" Ares asked. \"Is he going to be my new hood ornament?\" \"If he's still alive, if he is he doesn't have a tongue.\" Eris told him. No hint of humour in her voice which surprised Ares. \"Oh, he's still alive.\" He told her, Eris looked at him puzzled. \"He's in a secure medical facility, maximum security, of course. Not that I think that will stop him if he wanted to leave.\" Eris wasn't sure if she felt happy at the news of Loki's mortality or not. \"Well, you don't need to worry about decapitating him. Just try getting past Thor and 'Asgardian Justice' \" She waved her hand flippantly. \"Justice yes. If it's in Asgard or Jotenheim is another matter.\" Ares said causally. Eris didn't respond, hoping her brother would assume it was her weakened state to blame. \"I have talked to Thor.\" He said to break the awkward silence. \"And?\" She muttered. \"Will you let me finish?\" he asked irritated. \"Depends if you're going to say something interesting.\" \"Your pleasant personality returned.\" He muttered. \"As I was saying, I was talking to Thor.\" Eris forced herself deeper into the pillow and waited for the lecture on little siblings. \"He has been in contact with his home world and Olympus has found out what has happened.\" \"What? The actual world?\" she asked sarcastically. \"Let me finish.\" Ares shot her a look. Still she knew what he was going to say next. \"Mother and Father were not best pleased with what happened.\" \"What else is new?\" \"Eris!\" he exclaimed. \"They want you to return home, to Olympus.\" \"They can want all they like.\" she snarled. The back of her throat ached. \"They are threatening to send the Furies if you don't go of your own free will.\" He continued grimly. \"They can't!\" she exclaimed, protectively drawing her knees up to her chest and ignoring her protesting limbs. \"They have to find me first!\" \"Eris, you're hysterical!\" Eris ripped the tubes and wires off her arm and she closed her eyes and thought of where she wanted to go. She felt the energy vibrate around her. Suddenly a searing pain ripped through her body and she screamed. \"Eris!\" Ares shouted. \"Banner!\" \"Why are you calling a scientist?\" she barked. \"I worked as a medic for a few years.\" Bruce told her as he drew back the curtain. \"Now what happened?\" \"I tried to teleport.\" She told him. \"Before that she became hysterical.\" Ares told him. Eris glared at him. Bruce looked at Eris. \"I think what you did stunted your powers.\" He told her flatly. He looked up at her and smiled. \"I don't think Tony has finished his anti-magic project yet.\" Eris could see he was attempting to cheer him up. \"I wish him luck with that.\" \"Look, Eris I don't think you should be using magic till you've rested and probably healed.\" He sighed. \"To be honest, I'm not sure about the effects on your physiology.\" \"Thanks.\" She replied dryly. \"Just get some rest and stop shouting.\" He told her as he left. \"Bye.\" \"Bye.\" She muttered. \"We need to talk about this.\" Ares told her when Bruce was out of earshot. \"When Thor returns. If you calm down you may not have to go home.\" \"How are the boys?\" She asked starring at anything but him. \"They're fine. They're pain in the arse but they're my boys.\" Ares shifted in the tiny chair. \"Eris, wait till Thor returns before you decide to go AWOL.\" \"You heard Bruce, I need to rest.\" She told him, studying at the pattern on the blanket. \"I'm just the messenger. I will not drag you back to Olympus.\" Ares stood up and took his jacket of the chair. \"Take care, Eris.\" With that he left the room. She knew he wouldn't be far anyway. Mostly likely he would staying in the nearest high class hotel. Eris rolled onto her side and closed her eyes and let sleep claim her. - Days later, Eris wandered around the empty Avenger Tower, her bare feet padding against the cold flooring. Fortunately, they had giving her a tracksuit to wear in place of the embarrassing hospital gown. The thing is Bruce had informed the others she couldn't teleport so they didn't give her any shoes. As if that would stop her from getting out of here if she wanted to. And they left her on her own because they thought she was too weak. The Avengers weren't here, they were out doing something somewhere. Eris continued wondering listlessly around, she still felt tired to the bone from absorbing the power of the apple and she was annoyed with herself for the way she acted with Ares. She had acted like a child, throwing a hissy fit at the mention of Olympus. She could chalk it up to just waking up but still she felt disgusted with herself for letting her brother see her like that. If it was anyone else she wouldn't have cared but this was Ares, the brother who had stood by her through thick and thin. Eris wandered up another part of the Avenger Tower; this part was below ground, well below ground. She wondered how Stark had managed to build it without hitting the subways. Although Eris still hadn't regained her ability to teleport, her ability to manipulate electronic locks had returned almost immediately, although it still hurt to use it.Eris found a heavily locked door at the end of the corridor. They must be hiding something big behind it. She smiled to herself. She thought as she eyed the complex locking system. She placed her hand over it and winced. There was a clicking sound as the door swung open and Eris stepped through. She walked into a room which appeared to be a stark cell apart from the hospital bed in the middle centre. Unlike hers a few floors up there was no machinery around it and this bed was occupied. His skin blended in with the crisp white bedding. His black hair created a dark halo contrasting with his pale features.Eris exhaled. He looked like death. She crept towards to the bed. They had his hands in some form of handcuff, either to stop his superhuman strength or Stark had finally made his 'anti-magic' machine. She looked at the dark circles under his eyes. She reached out a hand to brush a stray hair away from his forehead. His skin was ice cold, Loki had always been cold both physically and metaphorically but this was different somehow. Quickly she placed two fingers on his neck. Her fingers were greeted by a faint heartbeat. She sighed. He wasn't dead. That should have been obvious, why would the avengers keep a corpse in the basement? Absorbing the power of the apple must have drained him more that it had her. He didn't have to do it. She told the rising feeling of guilt. Remember you nearly bit his tongue off. Remembering what happened to Loki's tongue and partly out of morbid curiosity; Eris lent forward and gently opened Loki's mouth. Placing her thumb on his lower lip she looked into his mouth. She nearly laughed when she saw it. His tongue was fine, completely healed. She should have expected it, with the power of the apple he had grown his tongue back. Eris let go of his lip and lent back to study him. Thoughts and feeling spun through her, none of which she wanted to focus on. Then his eyes twitched. Eris jumped back with a start, and then she leaned forward again. His brow creased as he pinched his eyes together. Then he let out a groan and his eyes fluttered open. He looked at her with his piercing blue eyes. It felt like they were physically burning her. \"Eris,\" he croaked. \"I'm glad you're the one to do it.\" He shifted in the sheets. \"I'd rather it be someone I care about than some faceless executioner.\" A sick feeling of realization settled in her stomach. \"Fuck you.\" She told him. She turned on her heels and left from the room.-\"Next time Hydra attacks something, or anything I think we should be better prepared.\" Tony stated as JARVIS removed his bullet ridded suit. \"I second that.\" Clint muttered, nursing a swollen jaw. \"That means we need to train more as team, and you're going to have to Hulk proof the training room again.\" Steve groaned pulling his suit down to his waist and inspected his right shoulder. \"Seriously?\" Tony exclaimed. \"What?\" Steve turned to face Tony. Tony's eyes were fixed on his chest. \"With the whole...\" Tony gestured to Steve's chest, \"thing.\" Steve rolled his eyes. \"I've hurt my arm, Tony.\" Tony made his signature bitch face expression at Steve. \"I'm gonna leave you two alone before anything gets more intense.\" Clint called. \"Later guys.\" \"I'm going to go check on my patent.\" Bruce said. \"Oh yeah, how is chaos and whatever else she's the goddess of, doing?\" Tony asked. ~Not to interrupt sir, but Lady Eris is no longer in the infirmary~ \"Where is she?\" Tony asked. ~ Still in the building but her exact location is unknown to me, although the holding cell has been accessed~ \"Shit!\" Tony swore. \"Loki?\" ~Still there and still alive, sir~ \"Thank fuck. At least this saves explaining to Thor when he gets back.\" \"Wouldn't you have to explain to Ares where his little sister's ran off to?\" Steve asked, a hint of jealously in his voice as he almost spat Are's name. \"I don't know what the hell your problem is with Ares and if you weren't listening, JARVIS just said she hadn't left the building.\" \"How does he know if he can't locate her now?\" \"When she broke in here Jarvis couldn't pick her up on his scanners, something to do with her manipulation of energy.\" Bruce told them. \"It seems she's regaining her powers.\" \"Great!\" Tony exclaimed throwing his hands in the air. ~She hasn't left the building as no exterior doors or windows have been opened ~ \"She's still too weak to teleport, it takes a lot of energy, remember the time she teleported Clint, it almost wiped her.\" \"Fucking great! And where the fuck has Legolas gone?\" \"Can you just stop swearing for a second?\" Steve asked sharply. \"We're going to have to look for her, before she does something stupid.\" \"Time to play hunt the unstable goddess!\" Tony muttered. \"I'll take the labs and the conference rooms and if she's touched the suits I'll kill her.\" \"I'm sure Ares will love that.\" Steve barked sarcastically. \"Seriously, what is your problem?\" \"Guys!\" Bruce shouted. He took a moment to calm his breathing. \"Eris is incredibly weak right now. Physically weak and possibly mentally unstable right now. We need to find her before she hurts herself or anyone else or your precious suits, Tony.\" \"Okay.\" Tony replied sheepishly. He was slightly freaked out by Bruce's outburst. \"Your right,\" Steve told him. \"I'll take the upper levels, Bruce do you want to take the infirmary and the lower levels.\" \"Yeah.\" \"Then let's go.\" - Steve's mind kept going over his reaction to Tony mentioning Ares as he searched though the dining room. Ares was a good man, larger than life certainly, but that didn't make him less of a good guy. Steve tried to convince himself it was because Ares was a mercenary, but Steve knew it wasn't that. He heard a muffled clicking sound. It sounded like it was coming from the broom cupboard. He crept up to the door like he was stalking a deer. He gently turned the door handle and threw the door back. \"Captain Amazing!\" He'd found Eris. She was sat on the floor of the tiny cupboard amongst the vacuum and the mops, nursing a bottle of vodka. There were deep bags under her eyes and her hair looked like a bird's nest. That and the fact she was wearing a white tracksuit and was bare foot made her look like a mental health patient. Steve recalled the Bruce's comment on her mental health. \"To the shit that comes with living!\" she toasted bitterly as she held the bottle up and took a swig. Steve sighed. \"Are you alright?\" he asked her. Eris raised her eyebrows. \"I'm sat in a cupboard getting drunk. What do you think?\" Steve sighed again. \"We've been looking for you.\" \"The Avengers, Asgard, Olympus. Everyone seems to want a piece of me.\" She told him. \"Just let me stay here a bit longer before dragging me off.\" Steve stood there and sighed. \"I know we don't get on but do you want to join me?\" She asked sheepishly. \"I can't get drunk, super solider serum.\" He told her. Eris nodded. \"Don't worry, I'm an alien with an incredibly high alcohol tolerance. Come on,\" she patted the space next to her. \"I won't do that thing I do. I want someone to talk to.\"Eris looked so vulnerable. Steve sighed and sat down next to her. \"Do you want some?\" She offered him the bottle. \"No thanks.\" \"Go on, if you can't get drunk, then what can happen?\" \"Okay.\" Steve took the bottle and took a swig. \"Argh, is it meant to burn your throat?\" Eris laughed. \"Yes. Have you never tired vodka before?\" \"Nope, was it that obvious?\" \"Kinda.\" She held the bottle up and studied it. \"Reminds me of the time I spent in Russia.\" \"The revolution?\" He thought of the photos they found of her in turn of the century Russia. \"Yes, one of the very few successful ones. Where the royal family weren't perched back up on the throne before tea. Luckily they had the foresight to have them up against the wall and shot.\" Eris took another drag. \"There was a photo of you at the Russian court.\" \"Yes, I was there. It was a joke.\" \"What do you mean?\" he asked. \" The Tsar would only surround himself by people who would tell him good news. And the fact they were so inbred meant they were half-wits or inflicted with diseases which lead to nutcase con artist, Rasputin to gain control at court and do whatever he wanted. He was a pervert.\" Eris paused to take another mouthful of vodka. \"They were too blinded by their own trivial problems to sort out their country. The few had everything whilst the poor dug around for their scraps.\" He was amazed at her passion, more so her anger for the royal family since he knew was actually part of one herself. \"So you toppled the regime?\" \"Don't give me that much credit, the right word in the right ear helped but it was really Lenin. He was a fantastic man.\" Eris sighed wistfully. \"Such a driven and powerful man, if he saw Stalin's Russia, he would have wept. He would have wept if he saw Russia today.\" \"Did you and Lenin...you know?\" Eris raised an eyebrow at Steve's prudishness. \"Yes, when he was in exile in Siberia. It may sound sad but I may have cried when he married his wife.\" \"It doesn't sound sad at all.\" Steve shifted awkwardly on the hard floor. \"You're not hiding here because of Loki, are you? We found out his cell had been accessed.\" Eris showed no surprise that they knew about her visiting Loki. \"The bastard's tongue grew back, did you know that?\" \"Yeah, after you tried to bit it out.\" Steve said flatly. \"Are you trying to make me feel guilty?\" Steve sighed. Talking to her like this was pointless. \"Ask me about something else, besides Loki.\" She told him. Steve didn't know why he was asking her this but he did anyway. \"Your brother and Tony how well do they know each other?\" Eris looked at him in amusement. \"They met at some science convention I dragged him to years ago. They're friends, I'm not sure what else. I don't really take an interest in my brother's love life.\" Steve's heart sank as he heard this. Eris saw the hurt in his face, from her ambiguous answer. \"Don't worry about my brother stealing Stark, it's a bit of fun for him. They haven't seen each other in years.\" \"Till now.\" \"Yeah. This is why who ever had a thing for him should get in there right now.\" She nudged Steve in the ribs suggestively. He laughed. \"You really are drunk.\" \"Well, this is my second bottle.\" She declared, tossing the now empty bottle in the corner to join it's brother. \"So, Loki? Is he the reason you're here?\" \"He wishes,\" she muttered. \"I don't know what to think about him anymore.\" \"You don't think he's completely evil.\" \"He helped me absorb the energy of the apple, it's probably the only reason I survived it. But he was the one who put in that situation in the first place, and there are all the things he says, it just...\" \"What things?\" Steve felt that he could be using this for intel gathering but he felt more strongly that she needed someone to confide in. \"He told me he would never do anything to hurt me days before the apple was stolen. And just now, I found him in that hospital cell and he woke up and told me he was glad it would be me who would kill him.\" Eris voice when up in pitch as she finished her sentence. Steve put his arm around him to comfort her. The angry, spiteful goddess who had ripped the arc reactor out of Tony's chest was nearly a completely different person. \"If Loki trying to screw with my head wasn't bad enough, I am going to be dragged back to Olympus for this.\" \"Let me guess, inter realm politics?\" \"Give the man a medal.\" She told him as she mimed pinning a medal to Steve's chest. \"Daddy is going to drag me out in front of the court to humiliate me, yell at me, let the others teach me a lesson again. Then and only then will I revive a punishment worthy of my crime.\" \"What crime?\" \"He'll think of something, running away from court, the whole Civil War thing will be dragged up again. Something I did eons as an angry child is being used against me. Sometimes I wish they would just tie me to a stake and burn me, get it over and done with.\" \"Will they do that?\" Steve asked. \"No, as royalty I can't be executed. It's the same nearly everywhere. As you'll always have Loki to worry about thanks to that.\" She sighed. \"Olympus is well known for unusual punishments, rolling rocks up hills, turned into some hidieous monster or even married off.\" She laughed slightly hysterically at the last one. \"Marriage?\" \"Not the way you think about marriage, it's a way of keeping said person, normally a woman out of the way and under control. Compared with the others its not that bad\" \"Oh.\" \"Yeah, oh.\" \"How do you know this will happen?\" He asked tightening his arm around her. \"Ares told me when I work up that my presence was being demanded in Olympus. That bastard threatened to send the Furies to fetch me.\" She whimpered into Steve's shoulder. \"I can't run from them.\" \"It'll be fine.\" He told her. \"Don't lie to me.\" She murmured into the fabric of this suit. \"I'm not.\" He told her. - \"She was drinking vodka?\" Ares asked, taking a sip of his whiskey and soda. They were in some high class bar, with Tony. Somehow Bruce was conveniently busy and Clint and Natasha were off on a mission. Not that he was not enjoying himself. Ares was good company. \"Yeah.\" Steve replied, \"She was a bit drunk.\" \"Don't tell me she made a pass at you.\" Tony interjected. \"No, thank God no.\" He caught a glimpse of the dark expression on Ares face. \"Not that your sister isn't an attractive woman. She's just not...\" \"She's just not what?\" Ares asked darkly. Steve felt himself turn redder and redder. \"She's, she's just not my type.\" Steve looked at Ares and saw a grin crack his serious face. Then Ares and Tony burst out laughing. Steve felt like an idiot. \"You should have seen you face.\" Tony told him. \"Thanks.\" \"No, I'm only messing with you, Rogers.\" He declared. \"I'm betting Eris was harping on about the Russian Revolution and that guy. She does it every time. For the so-called Goddess of Chaos, she is predictable some times.\" \"Pretty much, apart from the fact she was on about being forced to go back to Olympus. She was...scared.\" \"It's starting to sound like you care about this bitch, cap.\" Tony told him. He turned to Ares. \"No offence.\" \" None taken, I'm related to her.\" Ares took another sip of his drink and looked seriously at Steve. \"They want her home, where they can keep an eye on her. And as our father has warned me, he will send the Furies to fetch her.\" \"So what is her crime then?\" Tony asked, taking off his sunglasses. \"Besides being a pain, nothing.\" Ares stated bitterly. \"And there is nothing I can do to stop my sister from being thrown in some hellhole somewhere on Olympus.\" \"She muttered something about being married off.\" Steve prompted. Ares' face hardened, \"I doubt our father would do that, there isn't a soul on Olympus who could keep her in line. Plus last time he did it, backfired.\" The table fell into awkward silence and Ares drifted off into a world of his own thoughts. The silence made Tony's skin itch. \"We can sit here and mop or we could have some fun!\" He declared, grabbing both Ares' and Steve's shoulder. \"I agree and lets leave any talk of my sister out of tonight!\" Ares replied, grabbing Tony's shoulder in return, \"Couldn't have asked for anything better.\" \"Okay then! Let's do it\" Steve declared. -The clouds above Stark tower began to darken and swirl into a vortex. It sight of it made Tony shudder, it looked too much like wormhole he fell out of, for his liking. He turned away from the window and walked towards one of his screens. \"JARVIS, open the roof door for Thor. I don't want him breaking it again.\" ~Certainly, sir. Shall I alert the others?~ \"Why? What are they doing?\" Tony asked as he redrew the blue print for the hundredth time. The signature lightning bolt and thunder sound signified Thor's return. ~ Clint, Eris, Natasha and Steve are in the training room.~ \"Training?\" ~I believe so, sir.~ \"Thanks, JARVIS.\" Somehow the idea of Eris training with the rest of team didn't sit right with him. He didn't trust her. Besides that her brother was one of his friends, it still didn't change the fact she had used him as a hostage by ripping his arc reactor out of his chest. She'd left him powerless. He wasn't going to let the cow do it again. Tony lent back to admire the new blueprint. After studying the changing conditions in the Avenger Tower every time Eris teleported in or out, this should stop her. Well, if he could get it work. Moments later he heard the pound of heavy footsteps. He didn't need to look up to see who it was. \"Hi Thor. How's Asgard?\" Tony called to him. \"Greeting Stark. Where is the Lady Eris? I need to talk to her.\" Tony took one look at the tense look on Thor's face and decided against any remark. \"In the gym with the guys.\" Tony flatly. Thor took no notice of Tony's tone and thanked him before striding out the room, most likely to the training room. ~Should I tell the others of Thor's arrival, sir~ \"Nah.\" - Eris's back slammed against the training mat again with a thud. Natasha's silhouette blocked out the light. \"You're getting better.\" She observed. Eris gritted her teeth and took the hand Natasha offered her. Instead of pulling herself up, she pulled hard on it, pulling Natasha forward and throwing her elbow into her jaw. Using her momentum and Eris's arm under her jaw, Eris pushed her backwards, tripping her up over her out stretched leg. Natasha hit the mat. \"How was that?\" She asked. \"Hmm better.\" Natasha laughed as they both led, sprawled on the mat. \"Hey ladies,\" they looked up to see Clint walking up to them. \"As much as I love watching girls fight, can I have my sparring partner back?\" \"Yeah, sure.\" Eris got up, taking that as her que to have a drink. She walked over to the bench and picked up her drink bottle and took a gulp, before wiping the sweat off her face with a towel. This was actually fun, she thought to herself. \"Are you alright?\" Steve asked after he practically drained his water bottle. \"I'm fine, it's someone stole my sparring partner.\" She told him and she watched Clint and Natasha go at each other like pit vipers. She turned to Steve. \"You fancy fighting a Goddess?\" \"Uh, I'm more of a boxer.\" \"Don't worry,\" she told him. \"Tell me, are you any good with a short stick?\" she asked, tossing him a two foot length of rattan cane. \"I guess we're gonna fine out.\" He said following her to the mat. Eris stood opposite him, her feet shoulder length apart. She placed the cane diagonally across her chest and bowed. Steve copied her. \"Ready?\" She asked. Before he could get the words out she attacked, bringing the stick in an arch to hit his shoulder. He blocked, using his strength to push her away, he opened up her left side. Steve went to attack her exposed ribs, Eris quickly rolled out of the way, and she slammed her stick into the back of knee as came out the roll. Luckily for her, this forced him to drop to one knee. This gave her the opening she needed. She jumped onto Steve's back. Steve sensed what she was going to do and grabbed her off his back then threw her onto the mat in front of him. Eris landed with a thump and her short stick bounced out of her grasp. She opened her eyes to see Steve holding his stick at her throat like it was a sword. \"I forget you have super human strength.\" She told him as he pulled her up. \"Don't you, being an alien like Thor?\" \"We're a different species from them, so we don't get super cool, super strength.\" She sighed, picking up her stick. \"Speaking of Thor.\" As he spoke, Thor threw the doors to the training rooms open. He looked somewhere between stressed and annoyed. \"Fancy a round?\" Eris offered, twirling the stick like a majorette. \"I need to speak with you.\" Thor pointed his hammer at her as if to stress the urgency in her voice. Eris's heart sank. \"Now or can I at least shower?\" \"By all means, Lady Eris. You can bathe but meet me in the conference room as soon as you are able.\" The look on his face made Eris think twice about arguing with him. \"Can we tag along?\" Clint asked. \"If this is about Loki I want to know.\" \"Yes.\" Thor replied. \"There is nothing to talk about which I cannot share with my team mates.\" \"Sweet.\" Clint called, secretly hoping that they were about to hear that Loki was finally leaving this place. - As she planned, Eris was the last into the conference room and it looked like the Avengers were all here to hear what Thor had to say. Eris told herself they weren't gossip mongers they just needed to know about threats to their planet as she took her seat. Thor looked at her. \"As you know, Loki is to face trail in Asgard for his crimes both committed here and on Earth. The theft of the Golden Apple of Chaos will be added to his list of crimes.\" \"Why?\" Eris asked. \"He's royal blood or at least meant to be, he will not be executed for his crimes.\" The angry expression on Clint's face betrayed the fact he hadn't contemplated this being Loki's get out of jail free card. \"Lady Eris, it is not for you to criticize the judgement of the All Father, he has kept peace in between our realms for decades.\" Eris rolled her eyes. \"Yes, after more decades of bloody war, with just about everyone.\" Thor ignored her, there was some truth in what she was saying but to acknowledge her was to let her undermined him. Then there would be no way she would listen to what he needed to say. \"You will come to Asgard to testify at Loki's trail.\" He told her. \"What if I don't want to? Maybe I just don't fancy it.\" Bruce sat there wondering how far Eris could push Thor until he snapped. By the look of disbelief on his face, he didn't think it would take long. \"Eris, you knew my brother and you are a direct victim of his crime, you will speak at his trail.\" Eris cringed at the word 'victim'. \"I don't need to do anything.\" She told him as she leant back in her chair. \"If you must know, I am also wanted in Olympus so we might a scheduling problem.\" \"We have spoken to your people and they agree you can stay in Asgard for the duration of the trail.\" Tony smirked at the look of 'Oh, fuck' on Eris's face. Eris thought to herself, that if she was in Asgard for the trail, she wouldn't have to return to Olympus. Although it could mean delaying the inevitable, before the Asgardians boxed her up and send her to Olympus. \"How do expect me to get to Asgard? After the rainbow bridge shattered and all. I doubt there's a airport.\" \"We have a way. Rest assure.\" \"After the trail what will happen to me?\" Thor looked confused. She had caught him off guard. \"I wanted to speak to you to offer a chance for you to speak up for my brother's crimes against you. I thought you would have been glad to have your voice heard. Afterwards you will return to your people as have already guessed.\" \"Seeing Loki humiliated and reduced to sludge however appealing is nothing compared to my own survival and my freedom. If I return to Olympus both those things will be taken from me.\" She leaned across the table to Thor. \"You came here today and you ordered me to go to Asgard, you gave me no choice in the matter and you expect me to obey you? I am not a busty serving wench, Thor!\" The other Avengers sat there in silence, watching the argument between the two Gods unfold. \"Olympus stated you were to return there after the trail.\" Thor stated. \"So, therefore I have no opinion in how I lead my life. I am to spend my time being passed around like a library book.\" Tony immediately thought of several other, much better and dirtier metaphors she could have used. \"This is complicated politics...\" He began. Eris laughed in disbelief. \"Yet I am still a person, with a mind and independent thought! I wonder how that factors into your politics.\" She stood up waiting for Thor or any of the others to say something. They stayed silent. She turned and left the room in frustration. \"I hate to be the one to tell you this but you really could have handled that better.\" Clint told him. \"You think I do not know that?\" Thor barked back. \"Seriously, I don't like her but I was about to give her a standing ovation just now.\" Thor sighed. \"I will not make up excuses but I am under a very large amount of pressure.\" Natasha raised her eyebrow. That was an excuse if she ever heard one. \"Still, pushing her into a corner like that was cruel, you did know she hated her home world, if I didn't know better I would say she was scared?\" Steve asked. The defeated look on Thor's face told him that he didn't. - Eris walked out that room and wanted to scream. How dare they? That was the only thought that echoed through her head. She wanted to run away, leave everything and just run. She couldn't. This was the safest place to be till her full powers returned besides. Still she needed to get away from them but then again she felt so helpless and alone. This time the broom cupboard would be their first port of call. She closed her eyes and thought of somewhere the Avengers would never go, even in their own home. Eris opened her eyes to find herself inside Loki's cell. - I fancy writing the night out with Steve, Tony and Ares, maybe I'll do it some time. I haven't finished what final idea on what the furies will be. In Greek mythology they were born of the blood of Uranus, and their soul job was tormenting people who had killed family. They were meant to have snakes for hair and copper wings. And...Sisyphus- guy who is forced to roll a rock up a hill only to have it fall back down againMedusa- turned from a beautiful woman into a gorgon, with snakes for hair and the ability to turn men into stone.Aphrodite- not really a punishment but was married off for being so damn hot Also I wanted to explain what she was doing in Russia during the revolution. Eris tries to control her own fate. chapter title from yet another song, What's a girl to do (See the end of the chapter for notes.) Fury was having a typically stressful day. There were the HYDRA attacks that were becoming more and more aggressive and frequent, the Madripoor mission that went south and the intel Clint and Natasha gathered was less than positive. As if that wasn't bad the Council was on his back about the alien technology that Doom had got his hands on and the possibility of unitizing it for the good of the planet, which roughly translated as weaponry and the cherry on the cake was defiantly the return of Loki.Right now he was just looking forward to a few minutes peace.He pushed his office door open and leant against his desk was the woman he recognized as the alien Eris. She was wearing a black skirt and white shirt, she appeared to be unarmed but that meant nothing. \"What the hell are you doing in office?\" he demanded. Unthawed, she walked up to him and offered him her hand. \"Director Fury, pleasure to meet you, as you probably already know I'm Eris.\" Fury looked at the hand she offered for him to shake, and then he looked up at her face. \"Ms. Eris, I've heard a lot about you. Now tell me what the hell you are doing in my office.\" Eris dropped her hand, apparently unaffected by Fury's social insult. \"I have a proposal to put forward to you. If you'd just here me out we can find it is mutually beneficial.\" Fury contemplated for a moment. The fact she could help him with at least one of his problems helped sway his judgement. \"Okay, take a seat.\" Eris moved into the hard plastic seat opposite the desk to Fury's comfortable leather one. This cheap intimidation tactic was almost cute. Fury took his seat. \"So, you broke into my office in a high security compound to offer me something. So offer?\" \"First, breaking in would imply I had to break something to get in.\" Eris gestured to the room around her. \"Nothing is broken.\" Fury didn't react; in fact his only movement was to blink at her with his one eye. Eris nearly frowned at his lack of reaction but carried on anyway. \"I want asylum.\" \"Asylum?\" Fury repeated. \"Yes, Asylum here on Earth. I am here because I fear prosecution in my own world and wish to live a peaceful life here, on Earth.\" \"Why?\" \"I like the weather.\" She told him. Fury decided he wasn't going to get a sight answer out of her. \"What can you offer me in exchange for this Asylum?\" Eris decided to play maybe her weakest card but her safest first. \"I can offer you Loki's operations on Earth, during the time frame in which your people didn't know he was here. I'm guessing that something Thor neglected to tell you. But I can offer you every business partner, every venture he went into and every single name he went under.\" \"How do I know this will be real, not just something you just made up to gain your asylum?\" \"You will be able to verify his dealings after I tell you about them.\" She told him bluntly. \"Anything else?\" Fury asked, his face betraying nothing. \"I'm gonna need some more meat take to the Council.\" Eris paused for a second. Then smiled. \"I will become an asset for SHIELD and I will work with this organisation within reason.\" Fury closed his eye and leaned back on his chair. \"Thank you Eris, we'll get back to you.\" He told her. \"Do you want my number?\" she purred. \"Trust me, we'll find you if we want you.\" It wasn't a yes or a no. It was a maybe and a maybe mean there was a chance. And just for effect Eris made a point of teleporting out of the chair in Fury's office. - Loki was well enough to travel, or well enough to stand but weak enough not to pose a threat. This meant he was going to be transported back to Asgard as soon as possible. Thor looked across the kitchen to where Eris was standing. She would be a key in his trail; hopefully she could sway the All Father into showing mercy. Truth be told, Thor wasn't sure what Odin would do to Loki. Thor walked over to where Eris stood. \"Lady Eris,\" he called. She ignored him. \"I need to apologize for the way I spoke to you, I had no right to speak to you like that.\" \"Apology accepted.\" She told him. Still she didn't turn around to face him. \"I know you do not wish to go back to Olympus, I understand that you weren't treated well there.\" Eris turned to face him. \"How do you know about my time in Olympus?\" Thor glanced down at the floor. \"I spoke with your brother, he told me nothing specific. He didn't need to.\" He looked back to Eris's face. Eris saw the pitying look in his eyes. She wanted to slap him. \"At the end of Loki's trail we will not send you off to Olympus if you do not wish it.\" Eris felt as if a weight had been lifted off her chest. \"How very generous of you.\" \"You are not a prisoner, have committed no crime against Asgard and therefore we cannot stop you of you wanted to leave.\" \"Thank you.\" Eris smiled at Thor. \"But you've spoken to my brother so you should know Olympus is sending an escort team of Furies to ensure neither of us escapes.\" A grin spread across Thor's face. \"A flock of squawking furies shouldn't be any trouble.\" She turned back to worktop and picked up her coffee cup. Somehow his arrogance wasn't very comforting. \"You really want me to speak at your brother's trail?\" It was more of a statement than a question. \"My brother is troubled, and he has done many things, but he is still my brother. If someone could speak in his favour it might help him.\" \"You want that person to be me? After what he did?\" \"Yes,\" Thor sighed. \"Banner told me he saved you.\" Eris looked at him sceptically. \"He needs help not an execution.\" Eris looked at Thor, he reminded her of Ares. The big brother who always looked after her, regardless of what she did or who with. Thor was trying to do exactly that for Loki.\"Okay, I will go to Asgard. I will speak at his trail, but I will not sing his praises. I will tell them what happened.\" She wasn't sure if she was telling Thor the truth. \"That is all I wanted.\" Thor grinned. - Eris perched herself on the desk of Fury's secretary's desk. He looked up at her. She opened her mouth and a snake slithered out from between her teeth. The young man's eyes bulged. \"Can I help you, mam?\" He sounded calm, not scared. Eris reached to pull the snake out of her mouth and watched it curl around her fingers. Eris saw his hand reach under his desk. It was either a panic button or a gun he was reaching for. No wonder he was secretary, he wouldn't know subtly if it slapped him in the face, she thought. \"Now, let's get your hands out from under the desk, and leave you little weapon alone.\" She purred, leaning forward to place her hand on his arm. He looked up at her. His eyes were like saucers and she could practically smell the sweat, he was terrified and Eris loved it. \"What do you want?\" he spluttered. Eris smiled, exposing two rows of perfect white teeth. \"Leave the boy alone!\" Eris turned to see Fury march toward his office. She jumped off the desk and straightened her skirt. The snake had seemingly vanished into thin air.\"I was only seeing how well trained your staff were.\" She told him innocently. Fury glared at her with his one eye. \"I have already told the team Jamie called to stand down, I suggest if you don't want them to be recalled then you follow me.\"Fury didn't wait for an answer, and turned to walk into his office. Eris went to follow, before winking at Jamie. - Fury stood behind his desk but didn't sit down, nor did he motion for Eris to sit down. Knowing the man's temperament for quite literally an angry Cyclops, Eris couldn't tell which way this was going. Fury didn't say anything. He just stared at her. \"Are you going to say anything?\" \"That little stunt of yours, is it a little game you crazed gods like to play with my agents?\" He demanded, \"Maybe it's because you people believe you're better than us humans. Or that real law, don't apply to people like you.\" Seems a bit like pot calling the kettle black, Eris thought. She didn't say it, she knew not to angry an already angry bear. \"You called me here, Fury.\" she asked. He blinked in surprise, he was expect some sarcastic comment not a question. \"Yes, I did. It's about your demand for Asylum.\" \"Yes.\" Fury inhaled. \"The Council have decided to deny you Asylum on this planet, a decision I wholly support.\" He looked at Eris for any signs of her reaction. Her face was unreadable. \"There will be an escort team from your home world to escort you to Asgard for the Loki's trail.\" Fury's hand hovered over his gun, the other on the alarm button. But she didn't move. She just stood there. After what seemed like hours she looked up from the desk to Fury, she looked perfectly calm, like the sea before a storm. \"Then all I can do is thank you for your help.\" She told him, before disappearing. Fury relaxed his grip on his gun and pressed the intercom. \"Jamie, get me Captain Rogers on the phone, we have a potential time bomb on our hands.\" - Loki felt something heavy land on his bed. He didn't bother to open his eyes. He could guess who it was. \"Get your hammer off my bed and get out.\" He barked \"I've never heard it called that before.\" Loki smiled to himself. She was back. \"Eris, what do I owe this pleasure?\" She was sat on the side of his bed in some smart skirt and jacket, not the most exciting thing he'd seen her wear. \"I've come to finish what I started.\" She leaned back and placed one leg over the other. \"I'm going to cut out the rest of your tongue.\" Loki propped himself up with on his elbows. \"Really?\" he asked casually. \"No, not really.\" She said flippantly. \"Your tongue was one of my favourite things about you.\" Loki smiled. \"Was?\" She looked away, to hide her expression. \"Answer me this, do you wish to go back to Asgard?\" Loki's expression hardened. \"What do you think?\" \"I was thinking that maybe you would relish the attention from mummy and daddy. It's a chance to get more attention from your ham fisted brother.\" \"I am not some spoiled child.\" Eris made a disbelieving look. \"You think I want to go on trial? Let me remind you I escaped Asgard and I can do it again.\" \"Maybe you won't have to.\" Loki cocked his head and smiled. \"What are you planning?\" Eris smiled at him and leaned forward. \"Something you'll enjoy, very much.\" Sorry for the lack of other avengers here, but I wanted some interaction between her and Fury, before the furies turn up. Btw action next chapter, so please keep reading So time to return to Asgard for poor old Loki and Eris has come. More so for Eris as her Furie escort team are to arrive to ensure she behaves and goes to where she should.But of course, there's always a way to get out of these situations. (See the end of the chapter for notes.) They stood in the empty field. They stood strategically in a 'v' Bruce and Steve stood at the front, followed by Thor and Tony, then Clint and Natasha and finally Eris and Loki stood at the centre. Loki muzzled and chained up like a vicious dog, Eris looked over at him and smirked she kind of liked him all tied up. If she didn't know better she would have said, Clint and Natasha were had been placed so close to keep her and Loki in line. \"Don't get me wrong, I love standing in a field, being exposed and all,\" Clint called out. \"But we'v been here for ages.\" \"Let's all go home then, I'll make dinner.\" Eris called back. Clint smirked. \"Bet you'd love that.\" \"Defiantly.\" She sighed. Clint turned his attention back to the empty field. \"They should be here soon, prepare yourself.\" Thor called. \"Aren't they meant be on our side?\" Bruce asked. Eris gave a short laugh. \"Be prepared for anything.\" Steve called. Just as he spoke a swirling column of light descended from the sky. Eris closed her eyes, she only hoped Loki had done the same. The swirling column of light decent into the field, getting brighter and brighter, the closer it got the brighter it pulsed. Then it hit the field, sending out a bright pulse of light.Natasha's vision went blank for a second, when it came back she could have sworn, Eris had grabbed Loki's face. But her attention was drawn to where the column of light had struck the field. Stood there in dull leather amour and golden chain mail stood three figures of immense stature. Each had a pair of gigantic copper wings that glinted in the sun. The largest of the three stepped forward, unlike the other two, her helmet bore an eagle half emerged from the crown of the wearer's head. \"We are here for the Princess Eris.\" Her voice rang out across the field. Steve stood forward to meet her. \"Hello, welcome to Earth.\" The mountain of a woman looked at him the way an owl looks at a mouse. \"I am Captain America, we were lead to believe you and your detail were acting as an escort party for Eris whilst she was in Asgard.\" \"Plans have changed.\" She stated. \"The Mighty Zeus has requested his daughter is returned to him immediately to receive her punishment.\" \"I am Thor, Prince of Asgard. I demand to know what crime she has committed.\" Thor declared, the deep tenor of his voice dwarfed that of the Furie. \"She ran from Olympus.\" \"Seriously?\" Hawkeye muttered. The Furie turned to face him. \"Yes, Mighty Zeus wants her to return as soon as possible.\" \"No offence but your dad seems like a jerk.\" Hawkeye whispered to Eris. Her lip quirked up into a brief smile. Thor strode forward, his hammer in hand. \"We had an agreement! Eris was to come to Asgard and speak at the trial of my brother, THEN she would return to Olympus!\" The Furie looked at him impassively. \"The Agreement is off, we will take the Princess and do what we deem fit with her.\" Eris felt terror crept up her back as the Furie spoke, death would seem like a blessing after what they would do. Silence descended on the field. Then Bruce stepped forward. The rest of the Avengers held their breath. \"You talk about her as she's an object, but I don't know if you could understand this, but she has free will.\" The Furie looked at him curiously. \"What are you trying to tell us, mortal?\" \"I am saying you can't just drag her around like she's a doll.\" \"Why not, moral?\" \"Because that would make me very angry, and you won't like me when I'm angry.\" The Furie gave a snort, \"If you won't give her up we will take her,\" She looked at Bruce. \"Just like a doll.\" The smug look on the Furie's face was it. Bruce was no longer in control; the other guy was. The Hulk leaped towards the Furie, closing the distance between them, he then grabbed her and threw the leader across the field like a football. The Hulk let out snarl.In response the remaining Furies took to the air, supported by their metal wings. \"You will pay for that!\" they screeched in unison. They brought their wings forward. \"Duck!\" Eris screamed as a hail of sharp metal feathers flew towards them. She was able to cast a force field around herself, Loki, Clint and Natasha in time. Steve covered him and Thor in time and the projectiles simply bounced off Tony's suit and the Hulk's skin. The Furies hissed in annoyance revealing their forked tongues and swooped down. \"Jesus Christ! Normally I like chicks!\" Tony yelled as he missed one. Natasha's brow knitted together. \"Will he ever stop that?\" she asked Clint as she fired at the other, the Furie's metal wings defected the bullets with ease. \"Doubt it.\" Clint fired an arrow at the lead one who had returned to join the fight. The arrow released an electrifying net onto the Furie and she dropped like a stone. Eris stumbled back from the chaos of the fight. She tripped and fell into something hard, like a chest plate. \"Where are trying to run to, princess?\" the Furie hissed as she clamped her arms around Eris's struggling body and pulled her up into the air. \"I have her!\" she declared. \"Your fight is over!\" Everyone turned to look at the Furie clutching Eris. Eris stopped struggling. \"What if I told you I'm not really a princess?\" She smiled at the confusion on everyone's face. Then reached back for the blade kept at the back and drove it into the gap in the Furie's armor. The Furie screamed and released her hold on Eris. Eris landed gracefully on her feet. But not how Eris would normally move, the Natasha who had spent hours in the training rooms fighting Eris knew something was off. \"Captain,\" Natasha hissed. \"That's not Eris.\" Steve guestured that he had heard her with a quick movement of his fingers. \"Iron man can you locate Loki?\" Steve called out. \"There!\" Steve looked in the direction where Tony's armored finger was pointing. Loki had his legs wrapped around the waist of the last remaining Furie, whist she tried to slash at him with her razor sharp wings. Loki reared back and drove a dagger into the Furie's exposed throat. The Furie gagged and spluttered as she fell. Loki pushed himself off the falling Furie and back flipped into a standing position. He was fighting less like a snake and more like a cat, more like Eris. Natasha thought. Steve nodded to Hawkeye. Eris teleported over to where Loki stood, Loki turned to smile at her, placing his hand around her waist. \"Ready love?\" He asked. \"Come on, let's go some where hot.\" she replied Then the arrows hit them and hundreds of bolts raced through their bodies and they dropped to the floor. \"Nice shot, Legolas.\" Tony told him. \"Yer think?\" Natasha is a genius because she is a master spy and can read body language like adverts on public transport.Bruce being all noble because he hated being hunted and trapped by the colonel so deeply hates anyone trying to do the same to anyone else.Oh and everything else will be explained next chapter... The Avengers figure out what to with Loki and Eris after they tried to escape. (See the end of the chapter for notes.) \"They swapped bodies?\" Steve asked. \"Or maybe just appearances.\" Bruce offered. \"That would make sense considering they seemed to swap fighting styles.\" Natasha clarified. \"I saw her hold his face as the Furies arrived. I believe she cast a spell.\" \"She did?\" Thor asked. \"Yeah, there was no way Loki could have done anything with those cuffs on.\" Tony said. \"But what I don't understand is how Loki got out of them.\" \"Because we only designed them for him.\" Bruce said. \"Oh.\" \"Yeah.\" \"The thing is what are we gonna do now?\" Clint asked. \"I can't keep shocking them forever.\" \"We'll get them to swap back, if they haven't done so already.\" Steve told them. Tony looked at slight smirk on Steve's face. \"What you gonna do?\" Steve turned to Tony and smiled. - Eris's eyes fluttered open as she awoke, he body ached. She tilted her head down and found her palms that were cuffed together in her lap, her skin was pale and she was wearing a lot of green leather. For a second she was confused. Then it hit her, she wasn't in her own body, she was in Loki's. She laughed to herself, it sounded deeper and richer than her own. \"I see you've finally awoken.\" A familiar female voice asked. Eris turned to see herself looking straight at her. \"This is beyond strange.\" She remarked, looking at herself, it was more than unnerving watching herself move. \"Though I have to say I look good.\" Eris's body smiled back at her. \"Indeed, I was just wondering why we never tried this before, for more recreational purposes.\" Eris smirked. \"It would have certainly been fun.\" She looked at herself and suggestively licked Loki's lips. Loki laughed in Eris's voice. \"I have been told I am a narcissist on more than one occasion.\" \"Really? I never would have guessed, Loki.\" Eris smiled and turned to face the wall of, what she guessed was a van. \"They have us in the back of a van.\" She told him, with obvious disgust in her voice. \"Yes, you really would have thought they would have somewhere nicer to but supposed super villains such as ourselves.\" Loki replied. \"You forget, I'm not villain.\" \"Let me guess, you're just misunderstood?\" She let out a snort. \" Something like that.\" There was long pause. \"Eris, I..\" Loki began as the van door sliding open and sunlight flooded in. \"Yep their awake now,\" Clint's voice called out. \"Not sure which one's which yet.\" \"Great.\" Another voice called out. \"Thor, come with me.\" Steve and Thor clambered into the back of the van. Suddenly the van seemed so much smaller, Loki thought. \"Eris, Loki.\" Steve addressed them. \"I'm guessing you've swapped bodies to fight the Furies then run away together.\" They both stayed silent and stared at him blankly. \"Okay,\" Steve sighed in annoyance. \"Brother,\" Thor began; he was looking directly at Eris in Loki's body. Something both her and Loki found amusing. \"We are going back to Asgard, this petty attempt to escape failed again. Come back to Asgard with your dignity attached.\" Eris looked at him with Loki's eyes and she wondered what Loki really saw. \"I didn't realize that being dragged through the royal court in chains was dignified.\" Thor eyes grew wide for a second, till he realised. \"Lady Eris, you are still in my brother's body.\" Eris smiled. \"Maybe.\" \"Or maybe we're back in our own bodies or you're just too stupid to have figured it out.\" Loki said. \"Ok, if that's how you want to play this. The communist revolution in Russia, either of you remember that?\" Steve looked between the two poker faces. \"I swear the entire royal family was butchered and some nutcase took over, What was his name? Ah lemon? Lenny? Lenin?\" Steve saw mouth twitch on Loki's body. It wasn't a lot but he had an idea on which one was which. \"Well, maybe it was the booze; I hear homemade vodka does things.\" I t was confirmed by Loki's jaw tightening. \"He looked to Eris. \"Eris?\" She bit Loki's lip in annoyance, more so because she had told these things to Steve in confidence. \"Now, are you satisfied with the fact it's me in this body or do you want to poke around some more. I'm only saying this, because I might do poke back, quite hard.\" He looked at Eris in Loki's body, distrust seemed to be burning from the eyes. He felt a twinge of guilt, maybe he had picked up one too many things from Natasha. \"So are you going to uncuff me. Or do we just hang around in this tiny van till the Rise of the Titians?\" \"What do you mean?\" \"I would have thought that was obvious, even to someone like you, the star spangled prat.\" Loki told him from Eris's body. Eris sighed in Loki's voice, \"Physical contact and access to my power is needed. You've made that a bit hard for me. If you just uncuff me, maybe I'll be able to swap us back.\" She gestured to the handcuffs around Loki's slender wrists. \"Can you tell Tony and Bruce that I find these things absolutely amazing?\" Steve raised an eyebrow. \"Come on.\" Loki and Eris were pushed out the van and out into the field. \"Do you know which ones which yet?\" Clint called. \"Come on, that's a hell of a challenge.\" Tony called out. \"They both magical psychopaths.\" \"If only I had a window to throw you out of again.\" Loki purred in Eris's warm voice. \"This one's the douche who an army but we still kicked his ass.\" Tony declared pointing at Eris's body. \"So, how are we going to get them back to normal?\" Bruce asked as he pulled a sweatshirt on over his head. \"You're going to have to take these off.\" Eris gestured to the handcuffs which blocked the use of her magic. \"How do we know we can trust you?\" Clint asked, to him it felt like a stupid question but it still needed asking. He had a few problems dealing with the fact Eris was now in Loki's body, the man Clint would love to kill. \"Think about it, she her escape plan just failed, we still have her and Loki. She can't stay here, the Security Council put her on the high alert list, most of SHIELD would be after her and she's mot in her own body. I think she knows what her best option is now.\" Natasha told them. \"Yes, and it seems like Asgard.\" Eris cast a glance at Thor, who looked impassively back at her. \"How do we do this? When she changes back, she is going to be Loki, without the handcuffs on.\" \"Oh, damn. There goes the back-up plan.\" Loki muttered sarcastically. \"Take them both to Asgard as they are,\" Clint told him. \" I doubt Loki is the only one with magic there.\" \"I'm not sure about this type of magic; it's not of my realms.\" Thor informed them. \"Then what do we do then?\" Bruce asked. \"They will both go to Asgard and they both will be punished accordingly.\" \"Acording to who?\" Bruce asked. \"The All Father.\" \"Eris is not of your world, do you even have the authority to punish her there?\" Steve asked. Whilst the Avengers carried on arguing, Eris turned to Loki. \"Have you ever heard of a Hail Mary Pass? Its a football term.\" \"I haven't, but I understand what you mean.\" \"Oh! For the love of everyone you people have worshiped!\" Eris shook Loki's hands and the cuffs fell off. She grabbed her own face between her hands and muttered the spell, which Eris altered to emit a blinding light. \"Now,\" he muttered. Eris, now back in her own body, threw herself on the floor as Loki let out blast of energy, throwing the avengers to the floor. \"You'd have thought it would have been harder.\" He remarked. Loki didn't see it but she did. \"Loki! Get down!\" She was too late; Thor's hammer hit Loki full on in the chest, the force sending Loki flying backwards, with the hammer still on his chest. \"Get the shackles back on Loki!\" Thor shouted. He was past being annoyed; he had had more than enough. He strode up behind Eris, and pulled her up by her arm. She yelped in pain. He jammed her back against him and moved his hand to her jaw, using his strength to stop her talking. \"If you so much as breathe anything that sounds like a spell and Olympus will look like Valhalla.\" He pushed her away and stumbled to keep her footing. She turned to look at him, her golden eyes burning with hatred. He ignored her and made his way to Loki. \"Don't worry, Thor. He's been cuffed.\" Natasha told him, as she moved away from him. \"Hawkeye has eyes on Eris.\" \"Thank you,\" he told her. Thor leaned down to pull his hammer of Loki. \"The infinite uses you have for your toy.\" Loki observed, as he wheezed from the weight of hammer. \"No more games Loki, no more blotched attempts to run. You will go to Asgard to face justice.\" \"Oh, I simply can't wait.\" Thor pulled Loki up off the ground and dragged him to the middle of the field. - \"So, why not teleport?\" Clint asked, his bow drawn, the arrow pointing at Eris's right eye socket. \"I wish I could.\" She replied weakly. \"You exerted too much energy breaking the cuffs. Right?\" Bruce asked. Eris smiled weakly. \"Yes, you've got it.\" Clint admired her simply for still standing. \"Bruce, can I just thank you for attacking the Furies, actually all of you.\" She told them. Bruce blushed. \"Don't worry about it, no one should be dragged away against their will and caged up. Trust me I know what it feels like.\" \"Think nothing of it,\" Natasha said, \"The Furies became a threat to us and the Earth so we did what we had to do.\" Eris smiled at her. \"You should leave with Thor now; I doubt it's going to be safe here for you anymore.\" \"Nowhere is.\" She took a step forward and stumbled, breaking the handcuffs had taken more of her strength than she'd first thought. \"Need a hand, ma'am?\" Steve asked, shifting his shield to his other arm. \"Making sure I don't escape?\" She reluctantly took his arm and lent against it. \"Yes ma'am.\" He replied smirking. \"I just want to say sorry about the...\" \"The incident in the van?\" she offered, \"Don't worry, I have dealt with worse. I just didn't expect it from you that's all.\" He smiled at her and the walked over to Thor and Loki is comfortable silence. Thor looked at her coldly whilst in comparison Loki grinned at her. \"Guess this is goodbye.\" Steve told her. \"If you ever need someone to cry on, you know where I am.\" \"Thanks, can you say goodbye to Tony for me, he's seems to have gone left.\" \"Will do.\" Thor turned to Steve and nodded. \"Thank you, Rogers. I will take them to Asgard and I will leave your realm in peace.\" Thor told him. \"But the Bifrost has been repaired so my absence will not be long. Give my farewell to the others.\" \"I'll do that to.\" Steve gave a brief salute before turning to leave. Thor waited till Steve and the others were at a safe distance. He looked coolly between Eris and Loki before raising the hammer above his head and summoned the lightening to signal for the Bifrost to be open. Then it did and it was beautiful. The colours of the rainbow bridge shot past, the bans of light passing through their skin, making it tingle. Eris marveled at the extensive mass of darkness sprawling out beyond the bridge. Then they arrived, spat out from the Bifrost into a gilded metal room. Then everything in Eris's vision went black. Nearly the end, glad you made it this far.I reckon Steve would have picked up some interrogation tips from Natasha and I think he'd use them if he thought it was necessary after all he is a soldier. I made the Avengers forgive Eris or at least not be overly mad at her for helping Loki, after hanging out with her and probably becoming friends I guess they could see why she wanted to go where she wanted to go no matter what and at the end she really has no choice that to do what she has to. (See the end of the chapter for notes.) Heimdall stood on his platform before the gate of the Bifrost, waiting for them to arrive. They were close. He gestured to the waiting guards to signal their immediate arrive. Thor was returning with Loki in chains yet again and this time he was bringing another, not an Asgardian but an Olympian. He wondered how her presence on Asgard would be received by the All Father and whether Loki would remain imprisoned here for longer this time. Short and sweet.Thanks for reading. I'm planning on writing a second part to this, more Loki and Eris, more smut, more everything.Hey maybe I'll look into other story lines here. Maybe.",

      "She felt it pulse through her, through its circuit boards till she found what she was looking for.",
      "There was a brief clicking noise coming from around the building.",
      "To Loki, the clicking seemed a bit of an anti-climax, considering what she had just done was momentous.",

      "She looked like a feast, his cock harden further against his trousers.",
      "He quickly yanked down her knickers and she undid his belt forcing his trousers down as well, and then he pulled her in closer, trailing his mouth down from her neck to her breasts, her skin burned where he lips touched.",

      "That done she let her mind float upward till it was hovering over the Greek villa.",
      "She looked down on it, perched on the cliff face.",
      "She began chanting again, this time the words were more violent.",
      "She stopped then clenched her fist; the cliff supporting the building crumbled causing a landslide which took the building with it.",

      "\"No problem, but I have a contact of my own I need to see as well.\"",
      "\"Eris?\" it was Bruce.",
      "\"How did you remove Tony's arc reactor without killing him?\"",
      "She shrugged.",
      "\"Magic is the manipulation of energy, simple as that.",
      "The energy that powers this\" she gestured to the arc reactor \"is flowing through me and into Stark, I'm just acting as a transducer, making it flow through me to him at a much lower rate.\"",
      "\"Right,\" Bruce looked thoughtful, \"Would that mean the apple would give off an energy signal that we could track, it being made from magic or energy?\"",
      "\"I never thought of it like that.",
      "If you could track the energy signature of my magic it would seem possible.\"",
      "\"So it's settled, we're gonna help the crazy bitch who ripped out my arc reactor get back her magic apple and defeat Loki, sounds like fun.\"",

      "\"I don't trust her.\"",
      "\"Really\" he replied sarcastically \"What's not trustworthy about breaking in and literally ripping my heart out, then asking us for help?\" Steve smiled.",
      "\"Yeah, well she made some references that make me think she's been on Earth awhile.\"",
      "\"You mean the whole nuclear bomb comment or the bit where she called me a tin man?",
      "Maybe she watches old movies and the history channel.\"",
      "\"Can you run her face through some computer or something?\"",
      "\"Some computer?",
      "Yeah sure.\"",
      "Steve watched him leave; Tony must have been on knees not to argue with him.",
      "But he had other things to worry about like a potential bomb wiping out half the planet and a temperamental goddess alien to deal with.",
      "- Natasha led Thor and Eris to the kitchen and took a seat at the breakfast bar, Thor and Eris did the same.",
      "Natasha looked at her and noticed the dark patches on her face and bare shoulders; they looked similar to bruising, as well as the rings under her eyes and the sight tremors in hand when she took the cup of coffee Natasha offered her.",
      "She had been involved in something violent.",
      "Natasha thought of which approach to take with her.",
      "\"How are you?\" she asked.",

      "\"That's to be expected.\"",
      "Eris looked at her, expecting her to say more.",
      "She didn't.",
      "Thor also stayed uncharacteristically quiet, probably because he was sat next to the woman who threatened to torture his brother to the point of death.",
      "Taking a sip of her own coffee she looked at Eris again, \"Did he do that to you?\"",
      "Eris looked down at the light brown liquid in her mug, \"I'm not sure, I never saw who did it.\"",

      "\"Ok,\" Eris then proceeded to tell them as slightly edited version of the events being sketchy over locations.",

      "\"He doesn't know it's a bomb, why would he?",
      "He never stopped to ask.\"",
      "\"So he's planning world domination again, by using the apple as what?\"",
      "\"It drives people mad with desire, people would give up their first born just to look at it.",

      "\"Wow, that's ironic.\"",

      "Which ended with little change to the order of Olympian rule.\"",
      "\"So your coup failed?\"",
      "\"It wasn't a coup as such, I was young and angry and I wanted to watch them tear each other apart.\"",

      "\"You caused a war because you weren't invited to a wedding?\"",
      "\"Yes, I did.",

      "\"If you love destruction and carnage so much, you not let Loki take the apple and destroy the planet?\" Natasha asked.",
      "\"He lied to me and stole from me and mostly because I'm a little older and wiser now, and I don't see the point in destroying a place I actually live in.\"",
      "\"Why not go back to Olympus?\"",
      "\"I maybe from there, but it's not my home.\"",

      "\"That was pretty amazing, you created an organism out of nothing!\"",
      "\"It's a party trick,\" She handed the lily to Bruce, \"If you put it into water it should live for the next few weeks or so.\"",
      "\"Thanks,\" Bruce went to hunt down an empty coffee cup to fill with water.",

      "\"Yeah, hand him that screwdriver.\"",

      "\"Seriously.\"",
      "\"Then catch.\"",
      "Eris threw it at him and Tony fumbled to catch it.",

      "From under the bushy eyebrows a pair of golden eyes shone at Tony.",
      "So this was Eris as a guy, he thought.",
      "He still had a female Eris' plump lips and those eyes seemed to be searing his flesh.",

      "\"Ha, sorry about that, it was a means to an end, I am right in assuming you are not alone?\"",
      "\"No, he is not, I am Captain America and you are talking with the Avengers.\"",

      "\"We have been lead to believe you have information regarding the golden apple and the whereabouts of terrorist Loki.\"",
      "Steve continued.",
      "\"Yes I do, this information is regarding the apple, and there are some things I am sure Eris neglected to tell you.",
      "She means no malice but she is selfish, here main concern here is revenge on Loki and reclaiming what is hers, which is why she enlisted your help.",
      "The millions of lives at stake and Earth is not one of her priorities.\"",
      "\"We've noticed.\"",
      "Steve clenched his jaw, remembering the conversation he had with her in the lift.",
      "\"What else can you tell us.\"",
      "\"I'm sure you know the Apple is a weapon, which once activated becomes a bomb incapable of massive destruction, I doubt that whoever has it knows of its true power.",
      "And by now I am assuming the plan is to get the apple before active.",
      "But I am offering you a plan B, one that might me better in the long run than Plan A.\" \"Don't leave us in suspense.\"",
      "Clint muttered.",
      "The man on the phone sighed, \"The apple can be destroyed if Eris absorbs its power.",
      "This will stop the apple from being of any use.\"",
      "\"That seems possible, Eris manipulates energy, I theory she can absorb the energy of the apple, making it more stable.\"",
      "Bruce clarified.",
      "\"So we can't just destroy the apple?\"",
      "\"It will do that by exploding.\"",
      "The voice on the phone growled.",
      "\"Energy can be destroyed or created, it just changes form.",
      "So if Eris absorbs the energy, it's less likely to change from chemical to more violent forms of energy.",
      "I think that's what he's trying to tell us anyway.\"",
      "Bruce looked at Steve's still confused face; he got the gist of what Bruce was trying to tell him anyway.",
      "\"Correct, Dr Banner.\"",
      "The voice boomed.",
      "\"The problem is that Eris herself has to choose to absorb the apple, she most likely won't, considering the consquences.\"",
      "\"Why aren't you trying to convince her to do this?\" Natasha asked.",
      "\"Like I told you, she is selfish.",
      "And the consequences for absorbing the power of the golden apple aren't pleasant.\"",
      "\"I don't mean to sound rude but can you tell us what will happen?\" Steve demanded.",
      "\"She'll most likely die.\"",
      "The voice stated simply, although a note of sadness coloured his statement.",
      "\"The power would be too much for her to contain and it would kill her body, maybe causing a much smaller and less harmful explosion of only a few feet.\"",
      "\"Can she actually die?\" Bruce asked.",
      "\"Yes.\"",
      "No other information was offered.",
      "Steve was silent for a moment so Natasha took over.",
      "\"How do we get her to absorb the apple if she doesn't want to?\"",
      "\"I gave her a small clay pot when she and Hawkeye came to visit me, Don't ask the poor man about it.",
      "Eris made sure he can't talk about it.\"",
      "Everyone turned to look at Clint who pretended they weren't.",
      "\"She thinks the pot contains hell hounds, it doesn't.",
      "It contains a substance which will enforce Eris to absorb it.",
      "It will not control her mind but once the apple touches her skin the energy transfer, as Dr Banner put it, will begin.\"",
      "\"This apple is mean to drive people insane to possess it.\"",
      "Natasha stated, recalling what Eris told them when she first arrived.",
      "\"Only if contact is made with it.\"",
      "The voice replied.",
      "\"That is all I can tell you for now.\"",
      "The voice became amused.",
      "\"Mr. Stark, did you manage to find me?\" Tony looked up from the tablet in mild shock.",
      "\"Still working on it.\"",
      "He replied.",
      "In fact he had run into two dead ends as the signal jumped around the globe.",
      "\"One more thing.\"",
      "Steve said, his brow creased.",
      "\"Why are you doing this to help us?\"",
      "There was a few seconds pause on the other end of the line.",
      "\"This is war.",
      "The life of one person does not and will not out weight the lives of millions of others, especially when that one person has the ability to save those lives.\"",
      "Steve thought of the friends he'd lost in combat, most of all Bucky.",
      "\"Thanks for your help.\"",
      "\"Just stop it.\"",
      "The voice told him before discontenting.",
      "Steve lent against the table and sighed.",
      "\"You alright there, Cap?\" Tony asked, any concern from Tony was rare.",
      "\"Yeah, I'm fine.\"",
      "Steve ran his hand through is hair.",
      "\"Did you find out where he was calling from?\"",
      "\"Nope,\" Tony looked pissed off at that.",
      "\"The bastard bounced the call off hundreds of servers.",
      "But I do know that voice from somewhere.\"",
      "Steve made an effort to look like he knew what Tony was talking about.",
      "\"He's most likely family to her.\"",
      "Natasha stated.",
      "\"The way he spoke about her hinted at unconditional love, the type family members show for one another.\"",
      "\"Any ideas on who that might be, Bruce.\"",
      "Bruce suddenly found himself as the Avengers' official Greek Mythology expert.",
      "\"I.. I'm not sure really, according to myths she had a pretty huge family.\"",
      "\"Okay, no worries, but how are we going to get the pot of powder off her?\" Steve asked.",
      "\"She's not going to hand it over nicely.\"",
      "Natasha took a small clay pot out of her pocket and showed it to her team mates.",
      "\"Took it while she was asleep.\"",
      "\"Nice.\"",
      "Clint called.",
      "She smiled back.",
      "\"Did that guy say something about hell hounds being in that pot?\" Tony asked.",
      "\"Yes, the magic of Olympus is strange and unusual, I would guest it contains the hell hounds in powder form, which Eris would summon when needed.",
      "Apparently they can grow to the size of a Midgardian white bear.\"",
      "\"Powdered?",
      "Like a cup-a-soup?\" Clint asked \"I am not aware what that is.\"",
      "\"Nether mind.\"",
      "\"Right.",
      "Tony have the scanners picked up on anything?\" Steve asked.",
      "\"Nothing major as of yet.\"",
      "He leaned back in the chair and stared at Steve with these dark brown eyes.",
      "\"I'll tell you if I do.\"",
      "\"Okay thanks, let's go and act like normal.",
      "Tell Eris nothing.\"",
      "Steve told them as they filed out the room.",
      "He'd long given up on telling them they were dismissed.",
      "The jokes weren't worth it.",
      "thanks for reading!",
      "For anyone who doesn't know what a cup-a-soup is, I'm not sure if their just a British thing.",
      "But it's a sachet of dried/powdered soup that you add hot water to and drink from a mug.",
      "The Apple is located in Doctor Doom's compound.",
      "The battle plans are drawn and the assault begins.",
      "In battle the Avengers referred to by their code names.",
      "(See the end of the chapter for more notes.)",
      "Natasha watched as Eris laid an impressive collection of knives out on the table.",
      "Contrary to what Natasha was expecting the knives were new and plain, simple and practical.",
      "The way Eris handled them gave the impression she knew how to use them.",
      "She clearly appeared to be ambidextrous as well.",
      "Natasha almost felt sorry for Loki, almost.",
      "Natasha had bigger problems to deal with.",
      "Eris had already noticed the clay pot was missing but hadn't made a big deal out of it, claiming that whoever found it would have one big surprise before declaring she could go after Loki without it.",
      "Natasha touched the pocket were she had stowed the pot she'd taken when Eris was asleep.",
      "\"Right, from what we can tell from the satellite imagery is that Doctor Doom's compound is well guarded by a mix of sentinel robots and a few human guards on the out posts.",
      "This would make the place practically impregnable.\"",
      "Bruce told them.",
      "\"Practically?\" Clint asked, \"I like those odds.\"",
      "Steve rolled his eyes and walked over to the touch screen covered in grainy surveillance photos.",
      "\"Thanks Bruce,\" he told Bruce as he took a seat.",
      "\"Storming this place is not an option, it's too heavy guarded, so we are going in quietly.\"",
      "\"Hoping they leave a window open for us to climb through.\"",
      "Tony interrupted.",
      "Steve ignored him.",
      "\"I thinking of a two pronged attack at night.",
      "Black Widow and Hawkeye are the best at covert operations, I'm assuming from what we've seen of Eris she can do the same, so they're going in on ground level.",
      "I'll need Hawkeye on higher ground,\" Steve gestured to a slope with some tree cover near the compound.",
      "\"You will provide cover for the both Eris and Black Widow, and then join them as they after the apple.\"",
      "Clint nodded to show he understood.",
      "\"Iron man, will go for an aerial assault with the Hulk.",
      "Cause as much damage as you possibly can to the upper structure.\"",
      "\"You mean cause a distraction?\" Bruce asked.",
      "\"Yes, weaken Doctor Doom's position as much as possible then try make your way to our location.\"",
      "\"Not a bad idea, Loki is terrified of the Hulk.\"",
      "Eris said.",
      "\"That's if Loki is actually there.\"",
      "Tony told her.",
      "\"I know he is.\"",
      "She muttered darkly.",
      "Tony turned away from her evil glare, he did not envy Loki right now.",
      "\"I'll be going in with Eris, Hawkeye and Black Widow.\"",
      "He looked around the room.",
      "\"Thor I want you with Iron Man and the Hulk.\"",
      "\"No offence, but I would prefer to be with the other group.\"",
      "\"You mean the one with me on it?",
      "Are you trying to say you don't trust me?\" Eris's expression was filled with mock hurt as she flipped a clip blade into her hand before shoving it into a pocket.",
      "\"Besides Thor, you should be able to take out the compound's power generators.\"",
      "\"It's Doom where talking about, he'd have enough backup generators to last a century.\"",
      "Clint stated.",
      "\"True but before the backup kicks in it should cause panic enough for us to get further into the compound.",
      "That's actually not a bad idea, Eris.\"",
      "\"Thanks.\"",
      "\"I'll be going in with Eris and the Black Widow.\"",
      "Steve nodded to Thor, as a way of saying he'd keep Eris in check.",
      "A chorus of 'yes's swept across the room.",
      "\"Meet by the jet in ten.\"",
      "Tony called.",
      "-The jet ride had been deafening silent apart from AC/DC blaring from the speakers which no one bothered to tell Tony to turn down.",
      "But Eris would have swapped that for the creeping through the undergrowth from where the jet had dropped them off.",
      "It beat wincing every time someone stepped on a twig; unsurprisingly it was her and Captain America.",
      "Hawkeye gestured towards a tree, telling them he'd found his vantage point.",
      "Captain America nodded as Black Widow lead them through hedges and Hawkeye silently scrabbled up the tree.",
      "Black Widow gestured for Eris and Captain America to lie down.",
      "Captain America and the Black Widow produced a pair of binoculars.",
      "A chain link fence surrounded concert walls with guard towers at regular intervals.",
      "The chain link fence created a dead man's land between the outside and the inside of the compound.",
      "Captain America sighed.",
      "The fence could be climbed but they had nothing to cover the barbed wire at the top.",
      "Eris noticed the look on Captain America's face.",
      "She lent closer to him and whispered.",
      "\"It's a short distance, I can teleport us past the fence, I can see where we'd be going.\"",
      "\"Wait till I give you the signal.\"",
      "He whispered back.",
      "What kind of signal?",
      "Eris thought as she placed a hand on both Captain America and the Black Widow.",
      "Suddenly moment could be seen in the guard towers, spreading from the right to the left.",
      "Through the binoculars Captain America could see the guards dropping like flies with arrows in their foreheads.",
      "Hawkeye was doing his part, now where were the others?",
      "Seconds later Hawkeye crawled up next to them.",
      "\"Place your hand on my shoulder.\"",
      "Eris hissed.",

      "\"Captain, look up.\"",
      "Natasha directed his gaze to the sky.",
      "Thick, angry storm clouds were forming above the compound.",
      "The dark massing clouds looked like dirty rages in a sink against the light of moon.",
      "Suddenly white forks of lightening spat out from between the clouds.",
      "It was Thor.",
      "Captain America breathed a sigh of relief.",
      "\"Get ready.\"",
      "He warned.",
      "Eris tightened her grip on Captain America and Black Widow.",
      "Hawkeye did the same to her.",
      "They waited for what seemed like forever watching the storm clouds grow and the air fill with static.",
      "Then it came.",
      "A huge bolt of lightning shot down from the centre of the storm, striking something beyond the compound's high walls.",
      "The light briefly showed up the outline of Thor heading towards the compound.",
      "Eris felt the lightning discharge in the Earth.",
      "She looked to the Captain.",
      "He nodded.",

      "\"Thanks for the hand.\"",
      "She told her.",

      "He opened his eyes, ran towards the open door and let out a roar.",
      "Tony looked out the open door.",
      "There was no way he could follow an entrance like that, then again he wasn't a giant green rage monster.",
      "Tony shrugged and put on his helmet and the blue visual display came alive.",

      "He walked over to body to pull it out again and put it back in his quiver.",
      "He fingered his electro arrows he was saving for the sentinel guards.",

      "\"I second that.\"",
      "Clint muttered, nursing a swollen jaw.",
      "\"That means we need to train more as team, and you're going to have to Hulk proof the training room again.\"",
      "Steve groaned pulling his suit down to his waist and inspected his right shoulder.",
      "\"Seriously?\" Tony exclaimed.",
      "\"What?\" Steve turned to face Tony.",
      "Tony's eyes were fixed on his chest.",
      "\"With the whole...\" Tony gestured to Steve's chest, \"thing.\"",
      "Steve rolled his eyes.",
      "\"I've hurt my arm, Tony.\"",
      "Tony made his signature bitch face expression at Steve.",
      "\"I'm gonna leave you two alone before anything gets more intense.\"",
      "Clint called.",
      "\"Later guys.\"",
      "\"I'm going to go check on my patent.\"",
      "Bruce said.",
      "\"Oh yeah, how is chaos and whatever else she's the goddess of, doing?\" Tony asked.",
      "~Not to interrupt sir, but Lady Eris is no longer in the infirmary~ \"Where is she?\" Tony asked.",
      "~ Still in the building but her exact location is unknown to me, although the holding cell has been accessed~ \"Shit!\"",
      "Tony swore.",
      "\"Loki?\" ~Still there and still alive, sir~ \"Thank fuck.",
      "At least this saves explaining to Thor when he gets back.\"",
      "\"Wouldn't you have to explain to Ares where his little sister's ran off to?\" Steve asked, a hint of jealously in his voice as he almost spat Are's name.",
      "\"I don't know what the hell your problem is with Ares and if you weren't listening, JARVIS just said she hadn't left the building.\"",
      "\"How does he know if he can't locate her now?\"",
      "\"When she broke in here Jarvis couldn't pick her up on his scanners, something to do with her manipulation of energy.\"",
      "Bruce told them.",
      "\"It seems she's regaining her powers.\"",
      "\"Great!\"",
      "Tony exclaimed throwing his hands in the air.",
      "~She hasn't left the building as no exterior doors or windows have been opened ~ \"She's still too weak to teleport, it takes a lot of energy, remember the time she teleported Clint, it almost wiped her.\"",
      "\"Fucking great!",
      "And where the fuck has Legolas gone?\"",
      "\"Can you just stop swearing for a second?\" Steve asked sharply.",
      "\"We're going to have to look for her, before she does something stupid.\"",
      "\"Time to play hunt the unstable goddess!\"",
      "Tony muttered.",
      "\"I'll take the labs and the conference rooms and if she's touched the suits I'll kill her.\"",
      "\"I'm sure Ares will love that.\"",
      "Steve barked sarcastically.",
      "\"Seriously, what is your problem?\" \"Guys!\"",
      "Bruce shouted.",
      "He took a moment to calm his breathing.",
      "\"Eris is incredibly weak right now.",
      "Physically weak and possibly mentally unstable right now.",
      "We need to find her before she hurts herself or anyone else or your precious suits, Tony.\"",
      "\"Okay.\"",
      "Tony replied sheepishly.",
      "He was slightly freaked out by Bruce's outburst.",
      "\"Your right,\" Steve told him.",
      "\"I'll take the upper levels, Bruce do you want to take the infirmary and the lower levels.\"",
      "\"Yeah.\"",
      "\"Then let's go.\"",
      "- Steve's mind kept going over his reaction to Tony mentioning Ares as he searched though the dining room.",
      "Ares was a good man, larger than life certainly, but that didn't make him less of a good guy.",
      "Steve tried to convince himself it was because Ares was a mercenary, but Steve knew it wasn't that.",
      "He heard a muffled clicking sound.",
      "It sounded like it was coming from the broom cupboard.",
      "He crept up to the door like he was stalking a deer.",
      "He gently turned the door handle and threw the door back.",
      "\"Captain Amazing!\"",
      "He'd found Eris.",
      "She was sat on the floor of the tiny cupboard amongst the vacuum and the mops, nursing a bottle of vodka.",
      "There were deep bags under her eyes and her hair looked like a bird's nest.",
      "That and the fact she was wearing a white tracksuit and was bare foot made her look like a mental health patient.",

      "\"To the shit that comes with living!\"",
      "she toasted bitterly as she held the bottle up and took a swig.",

      "\"I know we don't get on but do you want to join me?\"",
      "She asked sheepishly.",
      "\"I can't get drunk, super solider serum.\"",
      "He told her.",
      "Eris nodded.",
      "\"Don't worry, I'm an alien with an incredibly high alcohol tolerance.",

      "\"I won't do that thing I do.",

      "\"Go on, if you can't get drunk, then what can happen?\" \"Okay.\"",
      "Steve took the bottle and took a swig.",
      "\"Argh, is it meant to burn your throat?\" Eris laughed.",
      "\"Yes.",
      "Have you never tired vodka before?\"",
      "\"Nope, was it that obvious?\" \"Kinda.\"",
      "She held the bottle up and studied it.",

      "\"Yes, one of the very few successful ones.",

      "Luckily they had the foresight to have them up against the wall and shot.\"",
      "Eris took another drag.",

      "\"Yes, I was there.",
      "It was a joke.\"",
      "\"What do you mean?\" he asked. \"",
      "The Tsar would only surround himself by people who would tell him good news.",
      "And the fact they were so inbred meant they were half-wits or inflicted with diseases which lead to nutcase con artist, Rasputin to gain control at court and do whatever he wanted.",
      "He was a pervert.\"",

      "\"So you toppled the regime?\" \"Don't give me that much credit, the right word in the right ear helped but it was really Lenin.",
      "He was a fantastic man.\"",

      "\"Well, this is my second bottle.\"",

      "\"Will they do that?\" Steve asked.",
      "\"No, as royalty I can't be executed.",

      "\"Yeah, oh.\"",

      "\"Don't worry,\" she told him.",

      "Eris rolled her eyes.",
      "\"Yes, after more decades of bloody war, with just about everyone.\"",
      "Thor ignored her, there was some truth in what she was saying but to acknowledge her was to let her undermined him.",

      "She laughed to herself, it sounded deeper and richer than her own.",
      "\"I see you've finally awoken.\"",
      "A familiar female voice asked.",
      "Eris turned to see herself looking straight at her.",
      "\"This is beyond strange.\"",
      "She remarked, looking at herself, it was more than unnerving watching herself move.",
      "\"Though I have to say I look good.\"",
      "Eris's body smiled back at her.",
      "\"Indeed, I was just wondering why we never tried this before, for more recreational purposes.\"",
      "Eris smirked.",
      "\"It would have certainly been fun.\"",
      "She looked at herself and suggestively licked Loki's lips.",
      "Loki laughed in Eris's voice.",
      "\"I have been told I am a narcissist on more than one occasion.\"",
      "\"Really?",
      "I never would have guessed, Loki.\"",
      "Eris smiled and turned to face the wall of, what she guessed was a van.",
      "\"They have us in the back of a van.\"",
      "She told him, with obvious disgust in her voice.",
      "\"Yes, you really would have thought they would have somewhere nicer to but supposed super villains such as ourselves.\"",
      "Loki replied.",
      "\"You forget, I'm not villain.\"",
      "\"Let me guess, you're just misunderstood?\"",
      "She let out a snort. \"",
      "Something like that.\"",
      "There was long pause.",
      "\"Eris, I..\"",
      "Loki began as the van door sliding open and sunlight flooded in.",
      "\"Yep their awake now,\" Clint's voice called out.",
      "\"Not sure which one's which yet.\"",
      "\"Great.\"",
      "Another voice called out.",
      "\"Thor, come with me.\"",
      "Steve and Thor clambered into the back of the van.",
      "Suddenly the van seemed so much smaller, Loki thought.",
      "\"Eris, Loki.\"",
      "Steve addressed them.",
      "\"I'm guessing you've swapped bodies to fight the Furies then run away together.\"",
      "They both stayed silent and stared at him blankly.",
      "\"Okay,\" Steve sighed in annoyance.",
      "\"Brother,\" Thor began; he was looking directly at Eris in Loki's body.",
      "Something both her and Loki found amusing.",
      "\"We are going back to Asgard, this petty attempt to escape failed again.",
      "Come back to Asgard with your dignity attached.\"",
      "Eris looked at him with Loki's eyes and she wondered what Loki really saw.",
      "\"I didn't realize that being dragged through the royal court in chains was dignified.\"",
      "Thor eyes grew wide for a second, till he realised.",
      "\"Lady Eris, you are still in my brother's body.\"",
      "Eris smiled.",
      "\"Maybe.\"",
      "\"Or maybe we're back in our own bodies or you're just too stupid to have figured it out.\"",
      "Loki said.",
      "\"Ok, if that's how you want to play this.",
      "The communist revolution in Russia, either of you remember that?\" Steve looked between the two poker faces.",
      "\"I swear the entire royal family was butchered and some nutcase took over, What was his name?",
      "Ah lemon?",
      "Lenny?",
      "Lenin?\" Steve saw mouth twitch on Loki's body.",
      "It wasn't a lot but he had an idea on which one was which.",
      "\"Well, maybe it was the booze; I hear homemade vodka does things.\"",
      "I t was confirmed by Loki's jaw tightening.",
      "\"He looked to Eris.",
      "\"Eris?\"",
      "She bit Loki's lip in annoyance, more so because she had told these things to Steve in confidence.",
      "\"Now, are you satisfied with the fact it's me in this body or do you want to poke around some more.",
      "I'm only saying this, because I might do poke back, quite hard.\"",
      "He looked at Eris in Loki's body, distrust seemed to be burning from the eyes.",
      "He felt a twinge of guilt, maybe he had picked up one too many things from Natasha.",
      "\"So are you going to uncuff me.",
      "Or do we just hang around in this tiny van till the Rise of the Titians?\"",
      "\"What do you mean?\"",
      "\"I would have thought that was obvious, even to someone like you, the star spangled prat.\"",
      "Loki told him from Eris's body.",
      "Eris sighed in Loki's voice, \"Physical contact and access to my power is needed.",
      "You've made that a bit hard for me.",
      "If you just uncuff me, maybe I'll be able to swap us back.\"",
      "She gestured to the handcuffs around Loki's slender wrists.",
      "\"Can you tell Tony and Bruce that I find these things absolutely amazing?\" Steve raised an eyebrow.",
      "\"Come on.\"",
      "Loki and Eris were pushed out the van and out into the field.",
      "\"Do you know which ones which yet?\" Clint called.",
      "\"Come on, that's a hell of a challenge.\"",
      "Tony called out.",
      "\"They both magical psychopaths.\"",
      "\"If only I had a window to throw you out of again.\"",
      "Loki purred in Eris's warm voice.",
      "\"This one's the douche who an army but we still kicked his ass.\"",
      "Tony declared pointing at Eris's body.",
      "\"So, how are we going to get them back to normal?\" Bruce asked as he pulled a sweatshirt on over his head.",
      "\"You're going to have to take these off.\"",
      "Eris gestured to the handcuffs which blocked the use of her magic.",
      "\"How do we know we can trust you?\" Clint asked, to him it felt like a stupid question but it still needed asking.",
      "He had a few problems dealing with the fact Eris was now in Loki's body, the man Clint would love to kill.",
      "\"Think about it, she her escape plan just failed, we still have her and Loki.",
      "She can't stay here, the Security Council put her on the high alert list, most of SHIELD would be after her and she's mot in her own body.",
      "I think she knows what her best option is now.\"",
      "Natasha told them.",
      "\"Yes, and it seems like Asgard.\"",
      "Eris cast a glance at Thor, who looked impassively back at her.",
      "\"How do we do this?",
      "When she changes back, she is going to be Loki, without the handcuffs on.\"",
      "\"Oh, damn.",
      "There goes the back-up plan.\"",
      "Loki muttered sarcastically.",
      "\"Take them both to Asgard as they are,\" Clint told him. \"",
      "I doubt Loki is the only one with magic there.\"",
      "\"I'm not sure about this type of magic; it's not of my realms.\"",
      "Thor informed them.",
      "\"Then what do we do then?\" Bruce asked.",
      "\"They will both go to Asgard and they both will be punished accordingly.\"",
      "\"Acording to who?\" Bruce asked.",
      "\"The All Father.\"",
      "\"Eris is not of your world, do you even have the authority to punish her there?\" Steve asked.",
      "Whilst the Avengers carried on arguing, Eris turned to Loki.",
      "\"Have you ever heard of a Hail Mary Pass?",
      "Its a football term.\"",
      "\"I haven't, but I understand what you mean.\"",
      "\"Oh!",
      "For the love of everyone you people have worshiped!\"",
      "Eris shook Loki's hands and the cuffs fell off.",
      "She grabbed her own face between her hands and muttered the spell, which Eris altered to emit a blinding light.",
      "\"Now,\" he muttered.",
      "Eris, now back in her own body, threw herself on the floor as Loki let out blast of energy, throwing the avengers to the floor.",
      "\"You'd have thought it would have been harder.\"",
      "He remarked.",
      "Loki didn't see it but she did.",
      "\"Loki!",
      "Get down!\"",
      "She was too late; Thor's hammer hit Loki full on in the chest, the force sending Loki flying backwards, with the hammer still on his chest.",
      "\"Get the shackles back on Loki!\"",
      "Thor shouted.",
      "He was past being annoyed; he had had more than enough.",
      "He strode up behind Eris, and pulled her up by her arm.",
      "She yelped in pain.",
      "He jammed her back against him and moved his hand to her jaw, using his strength to stop her talking.",
      "\"If you so much as breathe anything that sounds like a spell and Olympus will look like Valhalla.\"",
      "He pushed her away and stumbled to keep her footing.",
      "She turned to look at him, her golden eyes burning with hatred.",
      "He ignored her and made his way to Loki.",
      "\"Don't worry, Thor.",
      "He's been cuffed.\"",
      "Natasha told him, as she moved away from him.",
      "\"Hawkeye has eyes on Eris.\"",
      "\"Thank you,\" he told her.",
      "Thor leaned down to pull his hammer of Loki.",
      "\"The infinite uses you have for your toy.\"",
      "Loki observed, as he wheezed from the weight of hammer.",
      "\"No more games Loki, no more blotched attempts to run.",
      "You will go to Asgard to face justice.\"",
      "\"Oh, I simply can't wait.\"",
      "Thor pulled Loki up off the ground and dragged him to the middle of the field.",
      "- \"So, why not teleport?\" Clint asked, his bow drawn, the arrow pointing at Eris's right eye socket.",
      "\"I wish I could.\"",
      "She replied weakly.",
      "\"You exerted too much energy breaking the cuffs.",
      "Right?\" Bruce asked.",
      "Eris smiled weakly.",
      "\"Yes, you've got it.\"",
      "Clint admired her simply for still standing.",
      "\"Bruce, can I just thank you for attacking the Furies, actually all of you.\"",
      "She told them.",
      "Bruce blushed.",
      "\"Don't worry about it, no one should be dragged away against their will and caged up.",
      "Trust me I know what it feels like.\"",
      "\"Think nothing of it,\" Natasha said, \"The Furies became a threat to us and the Earth so we did what we had to do.\"",
      "Eris smiled at her.",
      "\"You should leave with Thor now; I doubt it's going to be safe here for you anymore.\"",
      "\"Nowhere is.\"",
      "She took a step forward and stumbled, breaking the handcuffs had taken more of her strength than she'd first thought.",
      "\"Need a hand, ma'am?\" Steve asked, shifting his shield to his other arm.",
      "\"Making sure I don't escape?\"",
      "She reluctantly took his arm and lent against it.",
      "\"Yes ma'am.\"",
      "He replied smirking.",
      "\"I just want to say sorry about the...\" \"The incident in the van?\" she offered, \"Don't worry, I have dealt with worse.",
      "I just didn't expect it from you that's all.\"",
      "He smiled at her and the walked over to Thor and Loki is comfortable silence.",
      "Thor looked at her coldly whilst in comparison Loki grinned at her.",
      "\"Guess this is goodbye.\"",
      "Steve told her.",
      "\"If you ever need someone to cry on, you know where I am.\"",
      "\"Thanks, can you say goodbye to Tony for me, he's seems to have gone left.\"",
      "\"Will do.\"",
      "Thor turned to Steve and nodded.",
      "\"Thank you, Rogers.",
      "I will take them to Asgard and I will leave your realm in peace.\"",
      "Thor told him.",
      "\"But the Bifrost has been repaired so my absence will not be long.",
      "Give my farewell to the others.\"",
      "\"I'll do that to.\"",
      "Steve gave a brief salute before turning to leave.",
      "Thor waited till Steve and the others were at a safe distance.",
      "He looked coolly between Eris and Loki before raising the hammer above his head and summoned the lightening to signal for the Bifrost to be open.",
      "Then it did and it was beautiful.",
      "The colours of the rainbow bridge shot past, the bans of light passing through their skin, making it tingle.",
      "Eris marveled at the extensive mass of darkness sprawling out beyond the bridge.",
      "Then they arrived, spat out from the Bifrost into a gilded metal room.",
      "Then everything in Eris's vision went black.",
      "Nearly the end, glad you made it this far.I reckon Steve would have picked up some interrogation tips from Natasha and I think he'd use them if he thought it was necessary after all he is a soldier.",
      "I made the Avengers forgive Eris or at least not be overly mad at her for helping Loki, after hanging out with her and probably becoming friends I guess they could see why she wanted to go where she wanted to go no matter what and at the end she really has no choice that to do what she has to.",
      "(See the end of the chapter for notes.)",
      "Heimdall stood on his platform before the gate of the Bifrost, waiting for them to arrive.",
      "They were close.",
      "He gestured to the waiting guards to signal their immediate arrive.",
      "Thor was returning with Loki in chains yet again and this time he was bringing another, not an Asgardian but an Olympian.",
      "He wondered how her presence on Asgard would be received by the All Father and whether Loki would remain imprisoned here for longer this time.",
      "Short and sweet.Thanks for reading.",
      "I'm planning on writing a second part to this, more Loki and Eris, more smut, more everything.",
      "Hey maybe I'll look into other story lines here.",
      "Maybe."

    "text": "\"You're beautiful,\" he whispers, holding her face in his hands. \"You are,\" He kisses the corner of her lips. She smiles softly. \"You're so beautiful,\" he repeats again, his eyes half-closed. Her eyelids flutter shut and she presses her forehead to his, their noses touching. \"Do you like me?\" he asks, quietly still. Her breath catches in her throat. She nods. \"You really like me?\" he asks. She nods again. \"Then will you do something for me?\" She nods for the third time. She wants to make him happy, whatever it takes. He reaches back and picks up a glass of water. It's cloudy. \"I want you to try this for me,\" he whispers. She holds the glass with both hands and brings it to her lips. The taste is strong and bitter. She wants to cough it out, but he's tipping the glass into her mouth, getting her to drink it. When she's finished, he puts the glass back down and stares at her intensely. \"Good, right?\" he asks. She doesn't respond; it felt as if the mixture were hacking her brain, clouding her vision, making her head spin. He kissed her cheek, nuzzling into the side of her face. \"Did you like it?\" \"Yeah,\" she breathes, blinking rapidly. The drink is still churning in her stomach, and she feels light-headed and strangely submissive. He touches the inside of her leg with one hand and she almost stops breathing. \"I need you to do something else for me\" he says. His breath is hot against her face, and he leans down, far enough that the dark ends of his hair brush feather-light against her face, caught in her lashes. He kisses her again and she feels delirious. \"Will you?\" he asks. She nods, intoxicated by his scent--or was it the drink? Her thoughts were muddled. Spots flashed before her eyes. \"I have a friend,\" he whispers against her lips. \"In the next room. I need you to be nice to him, okay?\" She nods. He gets up, letting her hand fall from his grasp, and walks over to the door. When he opens it, a burly man walks in. She sees something being passed from the man's hand to his. And then he leaves. She is left alone with the man. He's not at all attractive, especially not compared to him. The man sits down next to her on the bed. She is still confused from the drink. Her skin feels extra sensitive, but she doesn't jump when the man touches the inside of her thigh, moving closer to her. Instead, she is paralyzed. \"I'm Randall,\" and thats the last thing he says. This happened four more times. Sometimes, he would sneak her a pill. Other times, he'd give her his cigarette to try. And each time, another man came into the room, handed him the money, and shut the door. She wanted to be wanted and he was very beautiful, kissed with his eyes closed, and only felt good while moving. You could drown in those eyes, she said, so it's summer, so it's suicide, so we're helpless in sleep and struggling at the bottom of the pool. She wanted to be wanted, but only by him, and she never got him alone. There was always another man. So he kissed her sweet, told her she was beautiful and that he liked her a lot, and then he would slip her a pill or a drink and open the door. She knew how it went--she says I want to be with you tonight and he holds her head underwater. She says I want you inside me and he splits her open with a knife. \"I want to go home,\" she tells him one day, laying her head on his shoulder. His back is turned, but she can see his jaw tighten. He turns on her. \"What?\" he says, holding her face in his hands. \"You can't go, baby. I need you here,\" The intensity with which he stared at her bordered on obscene. She knew he could see the dark ringlets bordering her eyes, the sobs wracking her insides. \"I need...I want to go--I...\" She burrows her head in his shoulder and breaks down. He was her tormentor and her solace. She didn't care that he would undoubtedly hurt her at any moment, right now; she just needed somebody to hold her... To tell her these exact words: Its going to be okay. It wasn't of course, she knew that. But she didn't care. She needed the lie. \"You can't leave,\" he says, holding her chin up so she can look into his eyes. \"What happened? You don't love me anymore?\" Damn if she didn't love him anymore. She loved him so much it hurt to breathe. So she let him hold her captive, go through man after man, pill after pill, like clockwork. Then one day, a man comes to the door. He won't let the man in. And when the man protests, he pulls out a gun and threatens to shoot. Then he locks the door and kneels in front of her. \"I'm done with this,\" he says softly. The way he fingers his pistol makes her nervous--did 'done' mean he was going to kill her? Was she useless to him now? But he sets the pistol aside and touches one of her hands with his own. She trembles. He cups her cheek with one hand. She has just enough time to take in a breath, to blink, to part her lips before he takes them with his own. Time freezes. Her heart ceases to beat. Her eyes flutter shut. The cool slip of the small metal loop of his necklace presseds into her skin as he kisses her. Urgent. Gentle. So slow. Sweet, soft demolition. He tasted of cloves and coffee. And of something else. A farawat essence, familiar and yet somehow foreign, too. Something sere and arid. A little like some. A little like decay Ash. He was so beautiful, she kept thinking. Just the thought of him drew her knuckles white. She didn't need a god. She had him and his beautiful mouth, his hands holding onto her, the nails leaving unfelt wounds, his hot breath on her neck. \"I'm so sorry,\" he says, and she tilts her head upwards and marvels at his voice and how, for the first time, she was seeing it falter. \"I'm so, so sorry,\" She's in a car with a beautiful boy, and he won't tell her that her loves her, but he loves her. And she feels like she's done something terrible, like robbed a liquor store, or swallowed pills, or shoveled herself a grave in the dirt, and she's tired. She's in a car with a beautiful boy and she's trying not tell to him that she loves him, and she's trying to choke down the feeling and she's trembling, but he reaches over and touches her, like a prayer for which no words exist, and she feels her heart taking root in her body, like she's discovered something she didn't even have a name for. Then one day he brings her to his house and gives her a drink and opens the door. And the next day he gives her another drink and opens the door, and when she asks to feel his hands on her, she feels another man's hands there instead. Eventually, he stops opening the door. And when he puts his pistol aside, she picks it up and points it to his head, but she can't shoot and she doesn't even want to shoot, she just wants him. This time, she's the one giving him a pill. And when he's drugged, he touches her and she lets him because when he touches her, he makes things feel better that she wasn't aware felt so bad. Afterward, when the drug wears off, he comes to his senses and his eyes are red and he looks at her confused but he tells he'll do anything for her and that's when she finds out that he's always loved her. One day he stops opening the door. The next day, he stops giving her pills. The drinks stop, the lies stop, and now she gropes for him on the backstairs or in parked cars like she used to as the road around them grows glossy with ice and his breath softens the view through the glass, already laced with frost. He kisses her scars away and she makes new ones for him. If he loved her, then it was not in a way she understood.",

      "You could drown in those eyes, she said, so it's summer, so it's suicide, so we're helpless in sleep and struggling at the bottom of the pool.",
      "She wanted to be wanted, but only by him, and she never got him alone.",
      "There was always another man.",
      "So he kissed her sweet, told her she was beautiful and that he liked her a lot, and then he would slip her a pill or a drink and open the door.",
      "She knew how it went--she says I want to be with you tonight and he holds her head underwater.",
      "She says I want you inside me and he splits her open with a knife.",
      "\"I want to go home,\" she tells him one day, laying her head on his shoulder.",
      "His back is turned, but she can see his jaw tighten.",
      "He turns on her.",
      "\"What?\" he says, holding her face in his hands.",
      "\"You can't go, baby.",
      "I need you here,\" The intensity with which he stared at her bordered on obscene.",
      "She knew he could see the dark ringlets bordering her eyes, the sobs wracking her insides.",
      "\"I need...I want to go--I...\" She burrows her head in his shoulder and breaks down.",
      "He was her tormentor and her solace.",
      "She didn't care that he would undoubtedly hurt her at any moment, right now; she just needed somebody to hold her...",
      "To tell her these exact words: Its going to be okay.",
      "It wasn't of course, she knew that.",
      "But she didn't care.",
      "She needed the lie.",
      "\"You can't leave,\" he says, holding her chin up so she can look into his eyes.",
      "\"What happened?",
      "You don't love me anymore?\" Damn if she didn't love him anymore.",
      "She loved him so much it hurt to breathe.",
      "So she let him hold her captive, go through man after man, pill after pill, like clockwork.",
      "Then one day, a man comes to the door.",
      "He won't let the man in.",
      "And when the man protests, he pulls out a gun and threatens to shoot.",
      "Then he locks the door and kneels in front of her.",
      "\"I'm done with this,\" he says softly.",
      "The way he fingers his pistol makes her nervous--did 'done' mean he was going to kill her?",
      "Was she useless to him now?",
      "But he sets the pistol aside and touches one of her hands with his own.",
      "She trembles.",
      "He cups her cheek with one hand.",
      "She has just enough time to take in a breath, to blink, to part her lips before he takes them with his own.",
      "Time freezes.",
      "Her heart ceases to beat.",
      "Her eyes flutter shut.",
      "The cool slip of the small metal loop of his necklace presseds into her skin as he kisses her. Urgent.",
      "Gentle.",
      "So slow.",
      "Sweet, soft demolition.",
      "He tasted of cloves and coffee.",
      "And of something else.",
      "A farawat essence, familiar and yet somehow foreign, too.",
      "Something sere and arid.",
      "A little like some.",
      "A little like decay Ash.",
      "He was so beautiful, she kept thinking.",
      "Just the thought of him drew her knuckles white.",
      "She didn't need a god.",
      "She had him and his beautiful mouth, his hands holding onto her, the nails leaving unfelt wounds, his hot breath on her neck.",
      "\"I'm so sorry,\" he says, and she tilts her head upwards and marvels at his voice and how, for the first time, she was seeing it falter.",
      "\"I'm so, so sorry,\" She's in a car with a beautiful boy, and he won't tell her that her loves her, but he loves her.",
      "And she feels like she's done something terrible, like robbed a liquor store, or swallowed pills, or shoveled herself a grave in the dirt, and she's tired.",
      "She's in a car with a beautiful boy and she's trying not tell to him that she loves him, and she's trying to choke down the feeling and she's trembling, but he reaches over and touches her, like a prayer for which no words exist, and she feels her heart taking root in her body, like she's discovered something she didn't even have a name for.",
      "Then one day he brings her to his house and gives her a drink and opens the door.",
      "And the next day he gives her another drink and opens the door, and when she asks to feel his hands on her, she feels another man's hands there instead.",
      "Eventually, he stops opening the door.",
      "And when he puts his pistol aside, she picks it up and points it to his head, but she can't shoot and she doesn't even want to shoot, she just wants him.",
      "This time, she's the one giving him a pill.",
      "And when he's drugged, he touches her and she lets him because when he touches her, he makes things feel better that she wasn't aware felt so bad.",
      "Afterward, when the drug wears off, he comes to his senses and his eyes are red and he looks at her confused but he tells he'll do anything for her and that's when she finds out that he's always loved her.",
      "One day he stops opening the door.",
      "The next day, he stops giving her pills.",
      "The drinks stop, the lies stop, and now she gropes for him on the backstairs or in parked cars like she used to as the road around them grows glossy with ice and his breath softens the view through the glass, already laced with frost.",
      "He kisses her scars away and she makes new ones for him.",
      "If he loved her, then it was not in a way she understood."

    "text": ". 1. When Athena finds them, getting hot and heavy in the girls' bathroom, she isn't surprised. Mostly she's disappointed. This isn't the first time. \"I thought you were done with him,\" Athena says to her sister once they're home. She's leaning on the doorframe, arms crossed over her chest, watching as Aphrodite puts on her makeup at the vanity (idly, Athena thinks that the name is fitting, and even more so that her sister owns one. Aphrodite spends a lot of time sitting at her vanity). \"Ares?\" Aphrodite says, putting on lip gloss. She smacks her lips together. \"I'm just having fun Athena, don't worry it's nothing serious.\" Athena scoffs. That's not what she's worried about. \"Of course it isn't serious,\" Athena says sort of meanly, \"You aren't the type for serious relationships. Unfortunately.\" Aphrodite whips around to face her and narrows her green eyes. \"What is that supposed to mean,\" she says hotly and suddenly Athena is angry. \"It means,\" she says slowly, \"that too often, you forget.\" Aphrodite scowls and turns back to her mirror. \"Get out.\" Athena complies.. 2. She corners him in the halls after third period is over. For once, he isn't swarmed by his other asshole football friends. \"Stay away from her,\" she tells him. Ares just gives her this confused look before recognition slowly settles in. \"You're Aphrodite's older sister right?\" he asks. \"Stay away from her,\" Athena repeats and this time Ares smirks. \"Aw,\" he says mockingly, \"Are you jealous?\" He looks at her lustfully and traces patterns on her bare shoulder with his fingertips. Her skin sizzles. \"I'm sure Aphrodite wouldn't mind very much if you and I had fun of our own.\" Athena slaps his hand away and he has the nerve to keep smirking at her. \"You disgust me,\" she sneers, \"Don't go near her again. She's already in a relationship. She has a boyfriend.\" Ares snorts. \"That scrawny little geek?\" he says and then pauses, \"You didn't tell him did you?\" His eyes are narrowed at her in suspicion. Athena has never hated a person so much. \"I didn't have to,\" is all she says and then, \"Just leave my sister alone.\" Ares glares at her. \"This isn't any of your fucking business,\" he says and then shoves past her just as the late bell rings.. 3. \"What do you even see in him?\" Athena asks and walks over to sit on Aphrodite's bed. It's after school and while Aphrodite is trying to figure out the difference between a natural and artificial transmutation, Athena is still trying to figure out this thing that Aphrodite has going on with Ares (that asshole). And really, the only reason she's involved is because Hephaestus is pretty much her best friend and this thing is going to end in heartbreak, maybe for all of them but mostly for him. \"He's mean and short-tempered and crude--\" \"He's passionate,\" Aphrodite says, looking up from her Chemistry textbook with this light in her eyes. Athena glances at her curiously and sees the dreamy smile on her sister's face. She realizes that Aphrodite had lied before. You're a horrible person, she wants to say but she doesn't. She doesn't feel like fighting this time. Instead she gets up from Aphrodite's bed, the springs creaking as she does so, and leaves. Athena knows when to pick her battles.. 4. Athena sits next to Hephaestus in art class. They've been working on sculptures for the past three weeks. Hephaestus creates something beautiful out of scrapped metal, aluminum foil and old pieces of jewelry. It's a sculpture of a woman (parts of a woman anyway, so far it is just the head and torso). She wrinkles her nose at her own clay owl and it's misshapen head. Art has never been a strong point of hers. \"That's lovely,\" she comments and Hephaestus smiles. \"Thanks,\" he says, \"It's supposed to be Aphrodite. Do you think she'll like it?\" Her stomach drops and yes, after looking at it more closely she can see that the sculpture has the same jade color for her sister's eyes, the same slender neck and sloped nose. Athena stares back at Hephaestus' hopeful eyes and shy smile and thinks that Aphrodite doesn't deserve it. Any of it. \"I hope so,\" she says because she doesn't want to lie.. 5. Athena glares at the back of Ares head in World History because maybe if she tries hard enough, she actually will burn holes into his head. It doesn't work (obviously, and she tries not to feel too disappointed) and so instead she opts for subtly flicking things at his head (childish? yes--Artemis raises an eyebrow at her but otherwise says nothing--but Athena really does not give a fuck right now) like little balls of paper. And then her pink eraser when she gets tired of ripping off pieces of paper from her notebook. He turns around suddenly and yells at her to fucking knock it off. The class goes silent very quickly and no one speaks for a long time, practically choking on the tension between the two of them. It takes the teacher, a few seconds even, to get any words out. Predictably, it's to tell the both of them that they have detention. Athena's eyes widen. She's never had detention before and this is going to ruin her perfect record and it's all his fault. She resists the urge to kick him as she walks by his desk when the bell rings.. 6. Athena drags Hephaestus to a wild party at Eris' house. He didn't even want to go. She didn't even want to go and the only reason she's here is because Artemis made her come and the only reason Artemis is here is because Apollo is and it's basically Artemis' job to be her brother's caretaker or whatever because he would probably end up getting hit by a car whilst running naked through the streets with a lampshade on his head (Apollo would like to point out that, for the record, this has only happened once thanks). The party is absolutely chaotic, with basically everyone in the entire school being there dancing and laughing and making out and getting into fights. There is also an endless supply of alcohol (courtesy of Dionysus). Athena gets absolutely shitfaced, having never really had alcohol before and somehow ends up in Eris' bedroom. She can't remember how she'd even found Eris' room. So anyway, Hephaestus finds her there minutes later, sprawled on Eris' bed and crying over how she'll never be accepted into any exceptional college because of Ares and that stupid detention and God, he is such a horrible person. Hephaestus almost looks amused. \"You're being overly dramatic,\" he says and sits beside her. \"No, no I am not,\" Athena says seriously in response, sitting up, and then for a minute she just stares at him and thinks about how awful Ares is and how terrible Aphrodite is and how selfish and horrible their children would be and Athena thinks about how Hephaestus is such a wonderful person and such a nice friend and he may not be the most handsome but he's got the most lovely hazel eyes Athena has ever seen and he doesn't deserve all this shit, he deserves so much better and wow she really feels like crying but instead she leans over and kisses him. She is sort of surprised at how good he is at this and wonders if he's ever kissed Aphrodite like this. It doesn't last very long though. After about four seconds Hephaestus puts his hands on her shoulders and pulls her away from him and looks at her with shock. \"What are you doing? You know that I'm--\" \"She's cheating on you,\" she blurts out suddenly and Hephaestus is very still. Athena looks down. \"I know.\" His voice is barely above a whisper. Her heart twists and her stomach lurches. She hates everything. \"I'm sorry,\" she says quietly. And then she leans over and throws up on his shoes.. 7. Aphrodite comes home late one night, sneaking into the house after their parents have already gone to bed. Athena only knows this because she'd been in the kitchen drinking a glass of water when Aphrodite walked in. Aphrodite walks past Athena and stops, puts a finger to her smirking lips and winks at her sister before walking up the stairs to her bedroom. Athena inhales sharply. She was wearing his jersey.. 8. It starts off like this: \"You told him.\" \"What?\" \"About me and Aphrodite. About where we were.\" \"No, I didn't.\" \"Then how'd he know where'd we be? How'd he find out about us?\" \"Because he isn't a fucking idiot! Everyone knows! You aren't even trying to hide it anymore, I don't think you ever have!\" \"Why do you even care? What are you--Are you jealous?\" \"What? No. You are repulsive.\" \"You're jealous.\" \"Shut up.\" \"This is priceless. I can't believe this--\" \"If you don't shut up I will make you.\" \"Go ahead and try.\" It ends with: Athena and Ares in a janitor's closet, his lips against hers and her legs around his waist as he pushes her against the wall. They grind their hips together and her hands are in his messy red hair. It burns when he kisses her and Athena wonders if this is the passion her sister talked about.. 9. \"And that is why I am a horrible person,\" Athena says and then buries her face into Artemis' pillow. She's sleeping over at her house this time. She can't be at home right now, around Aphrodite. She feels ashamed. She turns her head to peek at her friend. Artemis looks thoughtful, twirling curly brown hair with her index finger. \"It's kind of interesting,\" she says, \"You've managed to turn their little love triangle into a more complex love--well not, square, I guess, it's kind of more of a distorted...doodle...thingy.\" \"Love doodle thingy. Articulate,\" Athena deadpans and Artemis rolls her eyes, \"Also, way to make me feel better, Artie. Thanks.\" \"You're welcome,\" Artemis replies. \"This is all very messy,\" Athena continues and runs a hand through her short dark hair, \"I hate messy.\" \"You want my advice?\" Artemis says. \"Well I didn't come here for the free food,\" Athena says dryly (it's only half a joke because seriously, Apollo makes the most amazing food whenever Athena's over). Artemis ignores her. \"Take a step back from this,\" Artemis says, \"Just distance yourself from the entire situation. You had good intentions when this started, I know you did, but you care too much. You have to stop.\" Athena sighs and hides her face in the pillow again. She wishes it were that easy.",

    "text": ". In the beginning she doesn't eat anything he gives her for a week. Mostly, it's to spite him, because she's angry at him, because he tricked her and she doesn't want to be tricked again (fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me, Persephone thinks and sneers at a bowl of fruit he presents to her). Mostly, she wants him to know that she hates him for what he did. Mostly, it's because the thought of eating anything from this place makes her want to throw up... Sometimes Persephone wanders. She can't stand being around him for too long. Whenever she looks at him all she can see is the one who stole her from the spring and the flowers and her mother, and then she thinks of her mother and then-- And then Persephone has to leave before she starts crying because the last thing she wants to happen is for him to see her cry (she does not want to look weak in front of him, for some reason). Often times Persephone will walk by the pit of souls and peer into it. The ghostly, miserable faces of the dead spirits stare back at her and it's funny because before she probably would have been frightened but now Persephone just thinks that they aren't that much different from her... He doesn't even talk to her and that's probably one of the things that frustrates her the most. Isn't the reason he kidnapped her because he (supposedly) loves her? Because he wants to be with her? It doesn't make any sense then, that he hardly even looks at or talks to her. What kind of marriage is this, she wants to ask, How do you expect this to work? She holds her tongue though because it's not like she's making much of an effort in this relationship either... They are sitting and waiting for the next arrival of souls when Hades looks over at her and very quietly says, \"I'm sorry.\" Persephone's breath catches somewhere in her throat and she looks down at her feet instead of his face and doesn't say anything (it almost sounded like he'd meant it). Her throne is cold like his hand on hers and Persephone wonders if this is what winter feels like... Once upon a time there is a boy named Orpheus who falls in love with a girl named Eurydice and when Eurydice dies (far too early), Orpheus can't let her go right away. He travels all the way down to the underworld to take her back home. The king of the underworld agrees to it on one condition and the queen of the underworld secretly roots for him with a feeling like hope blossoming in her chest when he gets all the way to the top of the entrance out. It would have been a great love story, the queen thinks back bitterly, if it hadn't ended in such a tragedy. (because when orpheus fails, her hope dies too. so close, persephone whispers as eurydice vanishes and orpheus cries, but so far)... \"If you left,\" he says one day, \"I'd look for you too. I'd search every corner of the Earth and the darkest parts of the underworld for you.\" Persephone stares at him with wide eyes. Her \"Why?\" comes out as a breathy exhale. Hades just gives her this sort of funny look. \"Because I love you,\" he says as if it's the most obvious thing in the world. As if it were that simple. She looks away. Her mouth feels dry... There is a day where Persephone can't hold back anymore. It happens sort of randomly, when they're sitting on their cold thrones and waiting for more souls again. Hades is silent and staring straight ahead and Persephone is suddenly so aware of just how dark and cold and quiet it is here and if this is what winter is like then she hates it. She hates it a lot. Persephone's heart pounds something horrible in her chest and she can't breathe and then she's crying because she hates it here and she hates winter (because she is a child of sun and warm weather and daisy chains and flower crowns and not--not this) and she still hates him. \"I didn't ask for this,\" she cries when he looks at her, eyebrows creased together in a concerned frown, \"I never wanted to be a queen.\" He sighs and says, \"I know,\" in that (much too) gentle voice of his. Persephone balls her hands into fists and tries to keep her voice from shaking. \"No. You don't understand. You don't know anything,\" she says and oh gods she hates how he makes her feel this way, everything is all his fault. He's looking at her with his sad, dark eyes and his mouth is curved into a frown and her heart does this weird twisting thing and she swears she can't stand him especially when he says, \"I didn't mean to make you so unhappy,\" because that just makes her want to cry a little more. He puts a hand on her shoulder and it feels like ice on her skin and harsh winds and frostbite and Persephone really does hate winter. She cries some more and doesn't care if she looks weak to him. \"Sometimes I can't remember what the sun feels like,\" she whispers in between sobs and Hades doesn't know what to do... \"We could hide. Find an island for ourselves,\" her mother says when Persephone's allowed back on Earth for a little while, \"No one would have to know.\" And Persephone thinks about that for a moment. She really wants to say yes and stay where the flowers are and the sunlight and the warmth but then she thinks about how they'd get caught because they would get caught. (--if you left i'd look for you too--) Someone would know. Someone would tell. (--i'd search every corner of the earth--) And this isn't something Zeus would just let go either. A deal between gods is a serious matter and Zeus would probably have her mother punished in some horrible way because that's what he's like and it doesn't really matter if Demeter's his sister or not. And then Persephone thinks of a lonely god with sad eyes on his cold throne in the silent darkness of the underworld. (--and the darkest parts of the underworld for you--) Persephone brings her mother into a tight embrace. She smells like earth and grass and flowers. She feels like warm sunlight on her skin. \"I'm sorry,\" Persephone says into her mother's hair, \"but I can't do that to you.\" And really she's thinking, and I can't do that to him. (--because i love you--)",

    "text": "\"Do you think I'm ready?\" It's a strange question for Perseus to be asking--Hermes and Athena have done all they could to prepare him for his quest--but he asks it nonetheless. Hermes laughs and rolls onto his side so he can look at him. \"Yes, I think you are.\" He grins at Perseus, who lets out a heavy sigh. \"Are you afraid?\" \"Should I not be?\" \"No, no. It's good that you're afraid. It means you're smart. Just don't let it get in the way.\" Hermes sits up now. \"But you're nervous.\" Perseus nods. \"Yes.\" \"Oh, Perseus,\" Hermes says, \"I have faith in you--else I would not lend you my sandals. I foresee a bright future for you.\" He snorts and sits up beside Hermes. \"I thought Apollo saw the future,\" he says, and there's a tiny bit of a smile tugging at the corners of his mouth. Whatever Hermes is doing, it's working--the longer they talk like this, the less and less nervous Perseus feels. \"Apollo sees what he likes to.\" He leans in closer, touches Perseus's cheek. \"I just like what I see.\" When Perseus's cheeks flush, he smiles. \"Well, hero?\" \"I think you're right, then,\" he says softly, and he doesn't want to make the first move--only truly foolish humans ever do when dealing with gods--but he bites his bottom lip in anticipation. The truth is, Hermes has seen the future and Perseus is one of the lucky ones. He laughs and shakes his head before leaning in to kiss the boy (because, even now, that's what he ultimately is and if Hermes has qualms with Athena's pick, he's not going to say anything). Perseus responds enthusiastically, and he's not the best kisser Hermes has ever had, but he'll take it. He wraps his hand over Perseus's hip and Perseus moves closer, presses against Hermes evenly, and he smiles into the kiss. Hermes presses him back down and holds him so his leg comes up naturally and they can rut against each other. He stops for a moment to look at Perseus. \"You're a brave boy,\" he says, and Perseus laughs in response. \"Sometimes, maybe.\" \"No sometimes about it. Is this what you want?\" Perseus smiles at him and kisses him. \"Yes--I didn't think I was being too obtuse about it but if you were confused--\" \"Not confused! I need the reassurance before I deflower you, the night before your quest begins.\" \"You're very kind to me,\" Perseus says. He rocks his hips up. \"But--will you accompany me, while I travel?\" \"I am the friend of all travelers,\" Hermes responds. He kisses Perseus. \"Of course I will accompany you.\" Perseus glows at that, pulls Hermes down closer so he can whisper in his ear. \"Then by all means, fuck me.\"",

    "text": "Patroclus tried once again in vain to smooth down his black hair. Why didn't I brush it this morning? Why did I think that Achilles would like the 'unkempt' look? Patroclus glared at his own reflection in the bathroom mirror. Normally, he'd be in AP Chemistry but he was already ahead of the class so the teacher let him go to the library. To say that Patroclus knew Achilles' schedule by heart would imply that Patroclus was stalking him and that wasn't the case. Patroclus had just casually familiarized himself with Achilles' schedule and would bump into him-on accident of course. Achilles was usually flanked by his friends and a few admirers who looked at him like a god. Patroclus was one of the few people who had managed to go out with Achilles and it had been a few fun dates. They'd seen a movie, gone to dinner, went to a carnival. He had even gotten to kiss Achilles' plump pink lips. Patroclus was sure that what he was about to do would secure his place next to Achilles. He took one last look at himself in the mirror, figured that his hair was good enough and went to his locker and got the bouquet of red roses that he purchased that morning out and made his way to Achilles' locker. The blonde was standing there looking at himself in the mirror, the running joke with anyone who dated Achilles was that he was married to his mirror. Patroclus had seen his girl/guy of the month stand and huff impatiently as Achilles brushed his blonde bangs to the side or check out his smile. Patroclus would just read and wait patiently, occasionally he'd catch Achilles looking at him from the mirror and with a blushing face he'd look down. He took a deep breath and hid the flowers behind his back. \"Hey.\" Achilles looked away from the mirror, a rare occurance, and smiled at Patroclus. \"Hey, what's behind your back?\" \"Later. First, I want to ask you something.\" Patroclus said. Achilles shut his locker and leaned against it, a soft smile on his face. Normally, people would've froze and began stuttering but Patroclus continued, \"So, I've been having a good time with our dates and all that.\" \"Me too. You're fun to be around.\" Despite himself, his cheeks flushed red. \"Thank you. Anyway, prom is coming up and you know I was wondering if you'd want to go...together as a couple.\" The smile vanished, \"I'm going to have to say no.\" It all crashed down around Patroclus, his grip on the roses lossened and then tightened, his palms began to sweat and his began to shake. His cheeks flushed red again and his throat tightened. His bit his lower lip and looked down at the ground. \"It's nothing against you, it's just I have someone in mind already.\" \"You do?\" The words were soft. \"Yeah. Patroclus, I'm so sorry. I didn't know. Were those flowers for me?\" \"What? No.\" Patroclus managed a laugh. \"Um, no. These were for a project. Yeah! A project about roses and how they're stupid and have become a overused symbol for love. Yeah, it was just a joke.\" He laughed again. \"Um, yeah. I'm going to go, um, I have to get a book for class and I think it's almost time to go.\" He turned around and ran down the hall. He threw the roses into the nearest garbage can and slumped down against the wall. He was about to cry but he fought back the tears. He isn't worth it. Why did I expect something different from him? I'm so stupid! He sniffed and stood up. Achilles' words echoing in his head. He finished the day in the library and when the bell rang he made his way to the bike rack. As he undid the lock, he saw Achilles make his way to his car and his heart shattered. He loved Achilles, with a passion that burned deep within him. But, like all tragedies, his was one-sided. The ride home took longer because he decided to stop in a small cafe and order a plate of fries and chocolate milkshake. When he got home, he noticed a rose on the top step of his porch. He opened his front door and another rose sat in the foyer. \"Hello?\" He was met by silence. He picked up the rose and noticed another rose on the step leading into the living room. He stepped through the entryway and stopped dead in his tracks. Achilles was standing in his living room holding a poster board that read 'Sorry for being a dick. Prom?' \"What is this?\" \"I was planning on asking you this afternoon, I didn't think you'd ask me and so I panicked.\" Achilles said. Patroclus' heart rose in his chest, \"You wanted to go to prom with me this whole time?\" \"Yeah, why wouldn't I want to go with my boyfriend?\" Boyfriend! Did he-am I- \"I'm your boyfriend?\" \"Do you want to be?\" Patroclus dropped his bag and ran to Achilles who dropped the sign and pulled Patroclus to him. Their lips crushed against each other, Patroclus didn't care that his breath smelt like fries, he was kissing his boyfriend, they were going to go to prom together and that's all that mattered.",

    "text": "She feels Apollo's call like she feels the warp of the river when she stands in up to her waist. She feels it pull at her girlish clothes and she can no more disobey Apollo than she can fight the river's current. She thinks of the Styx as she follows the sound of his voice. She thinks one day she will die and will learn what lies beyond. Helenus is at her side, but he does not hear what she hears. He follows because he has been bidden by their father to protect her and he grips his scythe with expert pressure. He will kill anyone who comes between them, this she knows without doubt, because he has been by her side and at her back since their days in the womb. \"Cassandra.\" His voice is hushed in the temple and she wants to tell him that Apollo doesn't care if they're quiet or not, but she doesn't. Apollo has ordered them both here; Helenus thinks they are here for some hidden knowledge. Cassandra suspects a trap. In the end, they are both right. \"Cassandra.\" His voice is louder now, more urgent. \"Cassandra, do you feel that?\" She does. She feels as though her blood is angling towards the far end of the room, as if her ears are hearing more than they have before, as if the hair on her arms is standing stark on end. Her palms itch and she looks down. Sweat, glistening on her hands. She wipes them on her dress. \"I do.\" The temple is airy and open but still Cassandra is clammy. At the far end is an altar and, as they approach, they see a shadowy figure form behind it. \"Apollo.\" She says. \"Why are we here?\" Helenus asks. Shadowy Apollo raises his shadowy arms as if welcoming them. They fall to their knees. It is partly piety, and partly because they have minimal control over their actions. Helenus drops his scythe as they fall, and Cassandra takes his hand. \"Children, try not to fear me.\" His mouth does not move when he speaks. Cassandra feels it would be foolish not to fear him; she knows the nature of the gods. She watches him and, even when half-cloaked, he is glorious. \"You are here to learn a great thing. I have a gift to bestow upon you.\" There are snakes on the ground; she sees them now, flittering toward her in lithe motions. They remind her of fish, skimming beneath the river surface. One curls about her ankle, another moves forward to lick at the sweaty palm of her hand. She does not shoo them away. She could not, even if she wanted to. Even her breath is still, her eyes on Apollo as though he has bewitched her. Perhaps he has. Helenus ignores them. \"My Lord, we are grateful for your gift.\" Apollo says nothing, and Cassandra remembers Hector telling her that the gods are most silent right before they strike. She holds herself straighter. She is ready. Apollo flicks each of his fingers, one by one, and as he does so the snakes twist closer to Cassandra and her brother, wrapping themselves around their stomachs, undulating up their arms. Cassandra feels a tail slip down the neck of her dress. She closes her eyes, but still she sees them. The hissing mouths are so close to her ears that she feels rather than hears them approach her ear drums, tongues moving around the inner circle of both her ears. She feels them kiss at her eyes, screwed shut even as she tells herself Apollo would never harm her, not glorious Apollo, not her god. \"Are they poisonous?\" Helenus manages to speak, snakes wound about his neck. Her eyes are still closed and so she only hears Apollo move, hears him approach them on the floor, feels his cold and dusty hands touch her ears, her eyes, her forehead. \"Not poisonous,\" his echo voice appears inside her head. \"But enchanted.\" Her breath catches. She has never heard like this before. She has a sudden desire to hear more of Apollo. She feels him inside her head, nestling himself between her memories, and thinks that this must be a great gift indeed. \"When these snakes retreat they will have given you their secret, and mine; the gift of prophecy. You will see all, and know all, and it will serve you well.\" Cassandra does not know what to say to this and so she, wisely, says nothing. Helenus, at her back and by her side in everything, knows which words are right. \"My Lord, we thank you, and we beseech you: what price do you ask for this gift?\" \"I ask no price of you, dear Prince.\" Cassandra hears the snake at her ear, feels its tail flick against her lips, tastes the salty scales coated with sand, and thinks Apollo is not telling the full truth. Helenus must suspect too, because he pauses and she hears his breathing roughen. \"And what price do you ask of my sister?\" The tail flicks across her lips again. It is dry and the snake hisses as she lets out her breath. Cassandra knows. Cassandra has long since known the wants of men, mortal and immortal alike. Her mother tells her they all run toward the same desires, and her mother is wise. Cassandra thinks of the woman who lives to the West, desired by all who know her. Cassandra knows what price Apollo asks. She knows as surely as she feels him at her side, shadowy hands caressing her hair. She knows. She cannot allow him this. He is her god and she loves him as strongly as she knows how to love, but she cannot give what he is asking, not here, not like this. She also knows she cannot refuse. To refuse one god is to refuse them all, and to refuse all gods is to align oneself with the mutinous Titans. Cassandra thinks of Semele, of Pandora, of Andromeda. There is no refusing the gods. There is only outwitting them. She levels her breathing with Helenus's. He is her brother, whose life thread began in unison with hers. He is at her back and by her side in all things; he will not disappoint her now. She feels the exact moment his anger becomes too much. He huffs, and she thinks he will never be as good a warrior as Hector, because his emotions are too near to the surface. \"You cannot ask that of my sister and ask nothing of me. It is not right.\" \"Right?\" Says Apollo, still in their heads. Cassandra hums in time to his voice. His voice is deeper than she has ever heard a man speak, it buzzes through her like thunder. She thinks it may not be too hard to love him, after all. Helenus shivers. \"Who are you to say what is right and what is not? I have given you the greatest gift. Your sister ought to show me thanks.\" \"My Lord, she is young. We did not ask this gift of you. You gave it willingly.\" Cassandra and Helenus both know that the gods give nothing without expecting something in return. Apollo circles Cassandra; she feels the warmth of his body wax and wane around her. Her eyes are still shut tight against the snake's tongues. \"Look at me.\" She cannot disobey him. When she opens her eyes, the snakes are entirely gone and, more worryingly, so is Helenus. When she opens her eyes, Apollo is before her. His eyes are green, like hers. When she opens her eyes, she sees a thousand things at once. Her memories, that he so freely walked among, are mixed with countless things that have not yet come to pass. She clutches her head as it begins to pound. \"This is your gift, my lord?\" \"This is your gift. And now-\" \"I cannot.\" Her father would call her crazy, to refuse a god even as she looks into his eyes. His eyes are beautiful. It does not change her mind, though. \"I will not.\" \"You will not?\" She thinks he is mocking her. She shakes her head. If he shall kill her, so be it. Outside, Helenus waits for her. His dark hair has fallen into his eyes and she thinks he must be as tired as she. They are a long way from home. \"What happened?\" She doesn't answer him. She cannot. She isn't entirely sure what happened. \"Cassandra, what happened?\" She cannot. \"Look at me!\" She looks. He knows. He knows because, like she, he can see everything that has happened and everything that will happened. As they look at each other she thinks of Troy burning to pith from Greek fire. \"Helenus, do you see -?\" \"Yes.\" She sees her city burning even as her eyes are on the road ahead of her. She sees her mother weeping beside her dying children. She sees black ships and a monster of a man. She sees Paris, returned from the hills, come to doom them all. Helenus sees it too. \"We must not speak of this vision.\" \"No?\" \"No. It will drive them mad with worry in Troy.\" \"Perhaps they should worry. They are going to die.\" She sees Polyxena fall to her death in tribute for a Greek soldier. She sees Hector slain, Andromache enslaved; she sees their son, who has not yet been born, tossed to death from the high wall. She sees Aeneas flee from the wreckage and she sees a city she knows will be called 'Rome'. \"All the more reason not to worry them.\"",

    "text": "\"Are you happy here?\" Zeus asks this while Ganymede is filling his cup, and Ganymede looks up at him with a wrinkle crossing his brow. \"Have I done anything to make you think I am not?\" he asks. \"No,\" Zeus responds. He touches Ganymede's arm. \"I think my cup is full. Why don't you set the pitcher aside and sit with me?\" Ganymede licks his lips and nods. He takes enough time for any other gods in the room to clear out, and when he returns to Zeus's side, they're alone. \"Zeus,\" he says softly, \"what brings this about?\" \"Sometimes I wonder--it must have been difficult, adjusting?\" \"As, I'm sure, it's difficult for a bride to adjust to life with her husband's family.\" Ganymede presses closer to Zeus, touches his cheek. \"I'm not unhappy, Zeus. With you I am the happiest I think I ever have been and ever will be.\" Zeus smiles, now, leans down and kisses Ganymede. \"Does that satisfy you?\" Ganymede asks. Zeus laughs loudly. \"As if I am ever entirely satisfied,\" he answers, and he pulls Ganymede onto his lap. Ganymede smiles cloyingly at him, reaches his hands up to run his fingers through the hair at Zeus's temples. \"Surely you don't mean to take me here where anybody could see?\" Zeus grins at him and pushes the hem of his tunic up so that he can press kisses against Ganymede's bare chest. Ganymede's breath hitches and he lets his head fall back, baring his neck to Zeus so the god can suck bright marks into the skin. \"Someone's going to suspect you like the attention,\" Zeus says, hands reaching around to grab Ganymede's ass. \"Someone might be right. I don't care.\" He kisses Zeus, rocks into his lap and sighs into his mouth. Zeus eases him onto his back and he spreads his legs naturally, letting them fall close to his chest so Zeus can move into the empty space. Zeus doesn't take his time, pushes in easily and thrusts hard enough that Ganymede lets out a loud noise as if the air has been pushed from his chest. Ganymede smiles all the while, though. \"Ah,\" he says, breathless, \"how--how could you think I was unhappy here?\"",

    "text": "O Muses, sing of sweet Love's song composed for handsome Phoebus, shining, radiant one who caught Cupid's attention. Even before Apollon's ascent to high Olympus, that grand abode of all the heavenly ones, the ordeals of love have been a bane and favour to men and gods. Winged Eros wielded his wondrous bow against that powerful sorceress who dwelt in distant Colchis to aid glory-destined Jason. But Love proved to be Semele's fiery undoing when the desire he lit beneath her mortal breast was stoked by white-armed Hera. Then in another instance he bid Zeus pursue heifer-faced Io whom our Cyllenian king freed from the hundredfold gaze of the giant Argos. How pleasant it seemed then when Hermes of fleet foot assisted in the work of Love. But you beautiful Muses who reside near the clear blue waters of the springs of holy Helicon know that it was Maia's glorious son who spurred the beginning of this tale. Glorious was the grand palace that sat atop Olympus. Homer said that neither rain nor snow dared to fall upon its marble floors and that the strongest winds touched not its halls. So Apollon rested his silver bow upon its gilded rack and looked over the balustrade wrought of smooth stone and looked over all of Greece. \"Wherefore do you gaze upon the expanse of the wide Earth, Apollon?\" asked Eros, wings carrying him beside his radiant companion. Phoebus smiled upon his companion and stroked his fair cheek. \"The games of my oracular city begin soon and its citizens have begun their traditions. Eternal gratitude they hold for me for I defeated monstrous Python, offspring of age-old Gaia and plague upon the peoples of Krisa.\" \"I see the act before me!\" exclaimed Eros as he happened upon the theatre where an unbearded youth in his prime slew the false Python in reverent re-enactment. Apollon was pleased by the performance. \"Watch as he goes before my sacred tree and fashions from its hardy foliage a crown.\" As the two gods looked on, Hermes, bearing his winged sandals, flew behind them. \"Is that to be the prize presented to the victors?\" asked that sneaky son of Maia. \"Surely a city as prosperous as yours would have a better prize.\" \"I thought so, too,\" agreed winged Eros. But the far-shooter only smiled at his fellow gods before returning his gaze upon his beloved city. \"The victors need not nor want not prizes of gold or silver. For to receive the crown of laurels dear to my heart is to receive my blessings and the renown of the world,\" he exclaimed with deserved pride. \"Will you be giving your favour to the athletes of the gymnasium?\" Eros asked Hermes, observing the young men massaging oil onto to their skin. The great messenger of Zeus thought for a moment. \"I shall not. These men have built and sculpted their bodies into strong and lithe forms. Should they win my half-brother's competitions, it shall be because of their skill and not our intervention.\" \"Well said, Hermes,\" Apollon said. \"Glory is theirs to be earned. Let them prove it so that we and the wide world may deem them worthy of praise.\" Hermes joined the two in gazing upon ancient Delphi. \"What a joyous time to be mortal, to be able to compete in such fun games and earn glory.\" \"Does the urge to enter the stadium and compete seize you?\" asked Apollon to his godly brother. Hermes nodded. \"Very much so. But, alas, it would be unfair. What chance have these mere mortals against the god who presides over all athletics?\" As Cupid watched two youths spar lightly against each other, an idea struck him. \"Why not compete against me? I am no mortal.\" He flitted about the two of them, excited by the idea of further impressing bright-eyed Phoebus. Such handsome youths they were, Eros and Hermes, that all of Olympus would have come to watch them wrestle. Both Apollon and Hermes laughed lightly. \"Such a jester you are, young god,\" Hermes said. \"It would still be unfair. I am much stronger than you without your bow and maddening arrows. And your flaming torch has no place in the stadium.\" \"You have no beard upon your chin either, Hermes,\" Eros said, crossing his arms and turning from Hermes. \"You are not much older than I and our bodies are both lithe and strong.\" \"Come now,\" Apollon said, stroking Love's soft, white plumes and holding his hand. \"What Hermes says is true. Though I have learned to respect your true and powerful aim, you have no experience in the games of the stadium.\" \"Unless he and cup-bearing Ganymedes whom Zeus picked from the Earth have been racing chariots all this time,\" Hermes joked. \"Joke not, Hermes, lest you wish an unwelcome desire cloud your mind,\" Apollon warned as he led Eros back towards his half-brother to speak to them both. \"Though I have a solution if you would hear it.\" Cupid smiled at his companion. \"Let us hear it.\" Hermes nodded in agreement. \"The Pythian Games are renowned through all of Greece for the athletic games but my city also hosts musical competitions. Compose for me a song, one each, and I shall gather judges and descend upon the theatre of Delphi. There you two shall compete and a verdict will be reached.\" \"What say you, son of golden Aphrodite?\" Hermes asked, picking up his wand and fastening his sandals. \"I shall compose a grander song than you and all the world shall hear,\" Eros answered. So the two gods bid each other farewell as Hermes flew off to attend to Zeus before composing his song. Cupid remained beside Apollon, thinking of what to sing about. \"Tell me, Apollon,\" Eros said, \"What should I sing about that I may please your ears?\" \"I cannot tell you that, Love,\" Apollon said, pushing away a stray curl as Eros' head fell downcast. \"It would be unfair to Hermes, don't you think?\" When the winged god sighed sadly, Apollo picked up his companion and sat him upon his lap. \"Whatever you write will please me.\" Very much did Love's pearly teeth shine at that declaration. \"True it must be then for you cannot lie!\" He embraced Apollon with all his strength before leaping from the grand palace atop Olympus and flying down towards the Earth. His feathered wings took him across the lands of Greece. He watched all manner of man, woman, and child travelling with their families and friends towards the sacred hills of Delphi. Whether they be from the fearsome city of Sparta who defended Thermopylae or the city of Athens whose citizens fled to holy Salamis to escape the advancing Persians. Citizens from rich Corinth and Hera's favoured Argos did he see, as well. And some from even distant palatial Knossos and the Hellespont where he is worshipped. But his wings eventually took him to the holy mount of Helicon near the city that received his blessings most of all. There he spotted the Muses, all nine, playing sweet music and dancing with their graceful feet barely touching the grass of the Earth. He landed near them and they greeted him with smiles and welcoming waves. \"What brings the fair son of laughter-loving Aphrodite to our sacred mount?\" asked Erato, extending her hand so that she may invite Cupid to their fold. \"Have you come to dance with us?\" \"Oh, look at how the god's cheek turns the colour of roses,\" Thalia said, sitting down next to the blushing young god. \"Be not shy, gentle Cupid. We shall teach you how to dance if you do not know how.\" \"Being surrounded by such talented goddesses makes me bashful,\" Eros confessed as the Muses sat with him to their center. A merry laugh bloomed from them and the air was filled with a pleasant sound. \"Do not be bashful,\" Clio said, \"We delight in the presence of an audience.\" \"Hush your gentle cooing and let the boy speak his mind,\" Melpomene said. Cupid nodded and addressed them. \"O grand Muses, you are the goddesses who inspire all mortals in their works. With your help, Homer has recounted the history of years before him even though he was blind. With Lord Apollon you grace the halls of Olympus with your delightful music and all the gods cannot help but rejoice and be merry. I ask for your assistance in a task: I must compete with Hermes for the approval of lyre-bearing Apollon.\" \"Wherefore must you compete? He already adores you,\" said Polyhymnia. \"You should hear the songs he composes about you and for you! How strongly you have seized his heart.\" Urania nodded and addressed the winged god with a smile. \"He would rearrange entire constellations in the heavens to build you a starry temple so that all men may know Love.\" \"I did not know this,\" Eros said, gleeful at the thought of Apollo thinking about him when they are apart during their godly errands. \"We would be happy to assist Apollon's beloved. What may we help you with?\" asked Calliope. \"I would greatly appreciate it if you, all nine, would help me compose a song for Pythian Apollo as an entry for the contest in his games. I hope to convey my adoration for him as he has done.\" Enterpe spoke up with delight, \"What a joyous occasion these games are that even the immortal ones seek Apollon's prize.\" \"Let the mortals who bear witness to our greatness never forget that Eros who bears the mad fires of desire has been so taken by our beloved Delian god,\" Terpsichore declared. \"Not even Hermes who invented and gifted to Apollo the first lyre stands a chance.\" As Eros was about to rejoice, he suddenly despaired. \"I did not know that Hermes was talented at the realm of music, as well. I had thought the chances were even since we would not compete in the gymnasium.\" \"Of course not,\" Thalia said, placing her soft hand on Cupid's knee in a gesture of comfort. \"The odds are in your favour because you have come to us.\" \"Come,\" Calliope said, pulling the winged god to his feet and leading him with them to the clearing where moments ago they were dancing. \"Let us begin Love's Song.\" And so it was that the Muses of Helicon brought to Cupid their many implements and instruments. From Clio's unfurled scroll she read of the heroic exploits of the Lycian god who defended veiled Leto's honor when boastful Niobe challenged her twin godly offspring. Erato with her lyre whose strings produce honeyed sounds set the tune for Euterpe and Polyhymnia who sang a hymn to Delian Apollon and recounted the tale of his birth where all the goddesses of heaven attended to Leto. Vengeful Hera took Eileithyia captive but swift-footed Iris delivered her to the rocky isle of Delos where shining Phoebus was born. From her soft chiton, Melpomene fashioned a costume in the shape of princely Hyacinthus and acted out his death at the hands of jealous Zephyrus who threw to his fair head a deadly discus. Then Thalia and Terpsichore took to the center dancing with their dainty feet, showing Cupid the fate of fast-running Daphne whom he stabbed with a leaden arrow. A frown dared to grow on his comely face until Urania handed to him a globe of the heavenly sphere and pointed to stars above and told him that the heavens support his noble endeavor. Finally, Calliope beckoned Eros to her and handed to him a stylus and her stone tablet. She guided his young hands into holding the implements properly and, before long, words started to flow from his hand. So it came to pass that Eros sang of the romantic exploits of the gods in heaven. The fruitful union of Gaia and Ouranus first and foremost, that fateful pair who produced the towering Titans. Then of the mother of gods, Rhea of the lion-flanked throne, and her husband, scythe-bearing Cronus. From that noble couple came the first of the Olympians. And finally Cupid's notes turned as he plucked new strings of his lyre while he sang of Leto and thundering Zeus. Through their divine union the world received the arrow-shooting, twin Letoides: Artemis born first, then finally handsome Phoebus whom all of Greece revere. And finally, Eros stirred the patriotic hearts of the Delphians with the story of Apollon's heroic exploits against Python and the foundations of the games he himself was competing in. The crowd at the theatre of Delphi rejoiced at the sight of the gods who descended onto their hilly city to judge the contest and were delighted at the start, middle, and conclusion of Cupid's song. Were they the judges, they would've declared a winner right then. But Apollon held the central seat at the judges' booth and to his right was ivy-crowned Dionysus to be judge with him. To the left was Hestia of ever-burning and peerless fire. Eros left the stage and sat near his mother, the lovely Cyprian queen, who embraced her son. With her came his brothers comely Himeros and Anteros who protects friendships and they likewise gave him their sincere adulations as if he had already won. But then Hermes took to the stage and presented his wand and the audience was enraptured. He began to sing and all were surprised at the handsome voice of Maia's son. They were treated to tales of distant lands that no Greek had yet seen. To countries beyond India where the men live in golden cities hidden by jungles. To distant isles beyond the frontier in Gaul where cave-dwellers were. To the distant north, perhaps those Hyperboreans, where men travel their cold seas in ships of alien shape. Further still, to a land in the east called Seres where the people have learned to make cloth from worms. Then he produced a lyre, as well, and sang that though his travels took him far along the wide world, he always returned to Hellas where everyone yearned to go. To Athens to learn in their academies of rhetoric. To Olympia to pay tribute to the King of Gods rendered in chryselephantine form. To Rhodes to marvel at their grand statue of hard won bronze. To Lesbos to hear Sappho recite her lovely poems. And also to Delphi to hear the will of grand Zeus through his son the prophet who gave the world the gift of oracles. Such a command over language did Hermes possess that the crowd was won over, as well. Hermes thanked the crowd for listening to his tale and addressed the judges, \"You have heard what I and fair Love have had to say. But it is clear from the citizens who has won the contest.\" And two of the judges had their decisions already made. Dionysus gave his vote to Eros whose use of rhyme impressed him. Hestia voted for Hermes to be victor as she considered his lyrework superior and more pleasing to the ears. And finally Apollon stood to declare the winner. \"Fortune smiles upon this fair city, chosen today to be stage to our godly competition. The gods have decided the victor of our contest.\" Apollon held the crown of laurels before him. \"To Hermes, son of Maia and our chief Zeus who bears the aegis. You are the victor of this contest.\" The crowd cheered as the luck-bringer was crowned by their luminous prince. Upon seeing the crown of laurels being placed upon Hermes' head, winged Love fled from his seat distraught. Hermes waved to the crowd, his godly smile as radiant as the sun, but happened upon the other winged gods departing. He turned to Phoebus and said, \"Make haste and chase after your beloved. Youth elevates the agony of loss. He may be thinking you favour me over him and you should tell him it is not so.\" Apollon nodded to his half-brother and clasped his strong shoulder. \"You have earned your prize and my thanks.\" So did Apollon leave Delphi and its exciting crowd behind to search for Cupid. But his way was blocked by Anteros' golden club. \"Wherefore do you race after the one you have deemed the loser? Are you not satisfied with his sorrow that you must pursue him from the low earth to the high heavens?\" asked Eros' brother, created for him as playmate and companion. \"You misunderstand the verdict and I have no time to explain it to you,\" Apollon said in turn. \"Tell me where my fair Love has gone.\" \"He is with Desire in the marble-wrought temple at Thespiae.\" So to the temple he went, as fast as his two feet could take him. Before long, he saw the city that worshipped Eros foremost amongst all the blessed gods and the temple where his most ancient image dwelt. And there did he see Himeros comforting his weeping brother. The sight made Apollon's heart ache with pain. \"At last, I have found you,\" Apollon said, relief washing over him. \"It is best you leave us be,\" Himeros said, turning an angry glare at their visitor. \"He does not wish to see you.\" Eros wiped the tears from his rosy cheeks and shook his head. \"No, brother. I pray you leave us be. Lord Apollon and I have much to speak of.\" Reluctantly did Desire leave his brother behind. But he obeyed him nonetheless and the two gods were left alone at the temple. \"You left so quickly I had no chance to congratulate you,\" began Phoebus. \"Am I to be congratulated? The one you deemed not the winner?\" Eros asked, leaning his head on his arm as he rested against the steps leading to the adyton. \"You said whatever I sang would please you. Did you lie?\" Apollon approached the younger good and knelt beside him. \"You know I cannot lie. And I did not. I enjoyed very much the song you composed for me.\" \"Then why was Hermes the victor?\" Eros asked, trying to walk away from Apollon's handsome face. But the Delphic god held on to Cupid's hand and stopped him. \"I enjoyed your song but Hermes' was simply a superior songwrite. If I had given to you the crown of laurels, it would have been a misjudgment.\" \"Do you love him more than I?\" \"Of course, I do not,\" Apollon answered imploringly. \"No one has so claimed my heart as you have.\" He pulled the young god with him as he stood up. \"I hope you did not see this as a verdict of my affections.\" \"It felt that way,\" was Cupid's answer. \"So foolish were you then,\" said radiant Phoebus as he stroked his thumb against Eros' smooth cheek. Eros signed. \"The passions easily take me. I had thought since you had not approved that you have deemed me no longer worthy of you.\" \"I am still awed that you have deemed me worthy of you,\" the older god pointed out. \"I suppose I do not need those leaves of bay to know that you love me most amongst all the gods.\" Apollon pressed a kiss against Love's pink lips. \"No, you do not.\"",

      "\"You should hear the songs he composes about you and for you!",
      "How strongly you have seized his heart.\"",
      "Urania nodded and addressed the winged god with a smile.",
      "\"He would rearrange entire constellations in the heavens to build you a starry temple so that all men may know Love.\"",
      "\"I did not know this,\" Eros said, gleeful at the thought of Apollo thinking about him when they are apart during their godly errands.",
      "\"We would be happy to assist Apollon's beloved.",
      "What may we help you with?\" asked Calliope.",
      "\"I would greatly appreciate it if you, all nine, would help me compose a song for Pythian Apollo as an entry for the contest in his games.",
      "I hope to convey my adoration for him as he has done.\"",
      "Enterpe spoke up with delight, \"What a joyous occasion these games are that even the immortal ones seek Apollon's prize.\"",
      "\"Let the mortals who bear witness to our greatness never forget that Eros who bears the mad fires of desire has been so taken by our beloved Delian god,\" Terpsichore declared.",
      "\"Not even Hermes who invented and gifted to Apollo the first lyre stands a chance.\"",
      "As Eros was about to rejoice, he suddenly despaired.",
      "\"I did not know that Hermes was talented at the realm of music, as well.",
      "I had thought the chances were even since we would not compete in the gymnasium.\"",
      "\"Of course not,\" Thalia said, placing her soft hand on Cupid's knee in a gesture of comfort.",
      "\"The odds are in your favour because you have come to us.\"",
      "\"Come,\" Calliope said, pulling the winged god to his feet and leading him with them to the clearing where moments ago they were dancing.",
      "\"Let us begin Love's Song.\"",
      "And so it was that the Muses of Helicon brought to Cupid their many implements and instruments.",
      "From Clio's unfurled scroll she read of the heroic exploits of the Lycian god who defended veiled Leto's honor when boastful Niobe challenged her twin godly offspring.",
      "Erato with her lyre whose strings produce honeyed sounds set the tune for Euterpe and Polyhymnia who sang a hymn to Delian Apollon and recounted the tale of his birth where all the goddesses of heaven attended to Leto.",
      "Vengeful Hera took Eileithyia captive but swift-footed Iris delivered her to the rocky isle of Delos where shining Phoebus was born.",
      "From her soft chiton, Melpomene fashioned a costume in the shape of princely Hyacinthus and acted out his death at the hands of jealous Zephyrus who threw to his fair head a deadly discus.",
      "Then Thalia and Terpsichore took to the center dancing with their dainty feet, showing Cupid the fate of fast-running Daphne whom he stabbed with a leaden arrow.",
      "A frown dared to grow on his comely face until Urania handed to him a globe of the heavenly sphere and pointed to stars above and told him that the heavens support his noble endeavor.",
      "Finally, Calliope beckoned Eros to her and handed to him a stylus and her stone tablet.",
      "She guided his young hands into holding the implements properly and, before long, words started to flow from his hand.",
      "So it came to pass that Eros sang of the romantic exploits of the gods in heaven.",
      "The fruitful union of Gaia and Ouranus first and foremost, that fateful pair who produced the towering Titans.",
      "Then of the mother of gods, Rhea of the lion-flanked throne, and her husband, scythe-bearing Cronus.",
      "From that noble couple came the first of the Olympians.",
      "And finally Cupid's notes turned as he plucked new strings of his lyre while he sang of Leto and thundering Zeus.",
      "Through their divine union the world received the arrow-shooting, twin Letoides: Artemis born first, then finally handsome Phoebus whom all of Greece revere.",
      "And finally, Eros stirred the patriotic hearts of the Delphians with the story of Apollon's heroic exploits against Python and the foundations of the games he himself was competing in.",
      "The crowd at the theatre of Delphi rejoiced at the sight of the gods who descended onto their hilly city to judge the contest and were delighted at the start, middle, and conclusion of Cupid's song.",
      "Were they the judges, they would've declared a winner right then.",
      "But Apollon held the central seat at the judges' booth and to his right was ivy-crowned Dionysus to be judge with him.",
      "To the left was Hestia of ever-burning and peerless fire.",
      "Eros left the stage and sat near his mother, the lovely Cyprian queen, who embraced her son.",
      "With her came his brothers comely Himeros and Anteros who protects friendships and they likewise gave him their sincere adulations as if he had already won.",
      "But then Hermes took to the stage and presented his wand and the audience was enraptured.",
      "He began to sing and all were surprised at the handsome voice of Maia's son.",
      "They were treated to tales of distant lands that no Greek had yet seen.",
      "To countries beyond India where the men live in golden cities hidden by jungles.",
      "To distant isles beyond the frontier in Gaul where cave-dwellers were.",
      "To the distant north, perhaps those Hyperboreans, where men travel their cold seas in ships of alien shape.",
      "Further still, to a land in the east called Seres where the people have learned to make cloth from worms.",
      "Then he produced a lyre, as well, and sang that though his travels took him far along the wide world, he always returned to Hellas where everyone yearned to go.",
      "To Athens to learn in their academies of rhetoric.",
      "To Olympia to pay tribute to the King of Gods rendered in chryselephantine form.",
      "To Rhodes to marvel at their grand statue of hard won bronze.",
      "To Lesbos to hear Sappho recite her lovely poems.",
      "And also to Delphi to hear the will of grand Zeus through his son the prophet who gave the world the gift of oracles.",
      "Such a command over language did Hermes possess that the crowd was won over, as well.",
      "Hermes thanked the crowd for listening to his tale and addressed the judges, \"You have heard what I and fair Love have had to say.",
      "But it is clear from the citizens who has won the contest.\"",
      "And two of the judges had their decisions already made.",
      "Dionysus gave his vote to Eros whose use of rhyme impressed him.",
      "Hestia voted for Hermes to be victor as she considered his lyrework superior and more pleasing to the ears.",
      "And finally Apollon stood to declare the winner.",
      "\"Fortune smiles upon this fair city, chosen today to be stage to our godly competition.",
      "The gods have decided the victor of our contest.\"",
      "Apollon held the crown of laurels before him.",
      "\"To Hermes, son of Maia and our chief Zeus who bears the aegis.",
      "You are the victor of this contest.\"",
      "The crowd cheered as the luck-bringer was crowned by their luminous prince.",
      "Upon seeing the crown of laurels being placed upon Hermes' head, winged Love fled from his seat distraught.",
      "Hermes waved to the crowd, his godly smile as radiant as the sun, but happened upon the other winged gods departing.",
      "He turned to Phoebus and said, \"Make haste and chase after your beloved.",
      "Youth elevates the agony of loss.",
      "He may be thinking you favour me over him and you should tell him it is not so.\"",
      "Apollon nodded to his half-brother and clasped his strong shoulder.",
      "\"You have earned your prize and my thanks.\"",
      "So did Apollon leave Delphi and its exciting crowd behind to search for Cupid.",
      "But his way was blocked by Anteros' golden club.",
      "\"Wherefore do you race after the one you have deemed the loser?",
      "Are you not satisfied with his sorrow that you must pursue him from the low earth to the high heavens?\" asked Eros' brother, created for him as playmate and companion.",
      "\"You misunderstand the verdict and I have no time to explain it to you,\" Apollon said in turn.",
      "\"Tell me where my fair Love has gone.\"",
      "\"He is with Desire in the marble-wrought temple at Thespiae.\"",
      "So to the temple he went, as fast as his two feet could take him.",
      "Before long, he saw the city that worshipped Eros foremost amongst all the blessed gods and the temple where his most ancient image dwelt.",
      "And there did he see Himeros comforting his weeping brother.",
      "The sight made Apollon's heart ache with pain.",
      "\"At last, I have found you,\" Apollon said, relief washing over him.",
      "\"It is best you leave us be,\" Himeros said, turning an angry glare at their visitor.",
      "\"He does not wish to see you.\"",
      "Eros wiped the tears from his rosy cheeks and shook his head.",
      "\"No, brother.",
      "I pray you leave us be.",
      "Lord Apollon and I have much to speak of.\"",
      "Reluctantly did Desire leave his brother behind.",
      "But he obeyed him nonetheless and the two gods were left alone at the temple.",
      "\"You left so quickly I had no chance to congratulate you,\" began Phoebus.",
      "\"Am I to be congratulated?",
      "The one you deemed not the winner?\" Eros asked, leaning his head on his arm as he rested against the steps leading to the adyton.",
      "\"You said whatever I sang would please you.",
      "Did you lie?\" Apollon approached the younger good and knelt beside him.",
      "\"You know I cannot lie.",
      "And I did not.",
      "I enjoyed very much the song you composed for me.\"",
      "\"Then why was Hermes the victor?\" Eros asked, trying to walk away from Apollon's handsome face.",
      "But the Delphic god held on to Cupid's hand and stopped him.",
      "\"I enjoyed your song but Hermes' was simply a superior songwrite.",
      "If I had given to you the crown of laurels, it would have been a misjudgment.\"",
      "\"Do you love him more than I?\"",
      "\"Of course, I do not,\" Apollon answered imploringly.",
      "\"No one has so claimed my heart as you have.\"",
      "He pulled the young god with him as he stood up.",
      "\"I hope you did not see this as a verdict of my affections.\"",
      "\"It felt that way,\" was Cupid's answer.",
      "\"So foolish were you then,\" said radiant Phoebus as he stroked his thumb against Eros' smooth cheek.",
      "Eros signed.",
      "\"The passions easily take me.",
      "I had thought since you had not approved that you have deemed me no longer worthy of you.\"",
      "\"I am still awed that you have deemed me worthy of you,\" the older god pointed out.",
      "\"I suppose I do not need those leaves of bay to know that you love me most amongst all the gods.\"",
      "Apollon pressed a kiss against Love's pink lips.",
      "\"No, you do not.\""

    "text": "Persephone feels it on the stagnant breeze, the tides of war lapping at the banks of the Styx. She does not know whether or not the vicious Titans will be unleashed or the sweet mortals will battle. She can feel the change and it stills her heart, freezing the pumping organ until it arrests violently. She hears loyal mortals cheer her name, begging for her to return to the land of the living. Persephone sees her husband lurking behind walls, hovering in doorways. He is a dragon, born to guard her in his land of lavish jewels. Yet she searches and the only jewel she sees is her reflection. \"Persephone, come to bed, my love,\" Hades calls, shrouded in shadows, padding silently through his halls. The wife clenches her jaw, her teeth grinding and muscles flexing. Her palms are clammy, sweaty with anxiety and cold like ice. There are times when Persephone wants to suffocate her husband with the incantations Eris had been teaching her in private during her stay in Olympus. She wants to spell ivy and thorns around his slumbering body until they choke him. She wants to see the spittle flicking from his mouth until he cries for her forgiveness. She finds it strange that although they have been together for eons, Persephone wants to own him in the most degrading way. Clearing her throat, she replies, \"Coming, my husband.\" Persephone walks into their chambers. Her feet scuff the floor softly. Hades sits up in the bed, hands making a steeple in his lap. \"What troubles you, Persephone?\" Her flaw is that he reads her well and that they've had this conversation before. He knows every move she makes as if it's a language made especially for him. And it irks her. It drives her to burn her gardens until they are blackened and charred, until all that is left is ash. Her husband, the king of the Underworld, the warden of Tartarus, bristles when she does not answer. \"What troubles you, Persephone?\" he asks again, voice starting to strain. \"I am tired,\" she says, calling an incantation into her hands. She feels the magic, strong and hot in the palm of her hand. She wonders where Eris learned this fire-bringing magic. -- Kore, some call her. Maiden, they whisper when they think she cannot hear. She scoffs under her breath. She is a maiden no longer. The complex situation that baffles Persephone incessantly is that although she wants to crush her husband under her feet, she also needs to love him. And love him she does. She adores her king, the one who has allowed her six months of freedom and six months of work. Persephone is not quite sure whether the Underworld is freedom or Olympus. -- \"I wish to take visitors,\" she says to Hades. She rushes into his private council chambers as he attends a meeting with his closest advisers. Hades looks up from a few scrolls, brows furrowed and only a hint of annoyance in his eyes. His gaze softens as he looks at his wife. \"Persephone?\" \"I wish to receive visitors,\" she changes her tone. \"Anyone I wish,\" she continues, lips pursed. Hades smirks, darkly. It is moments like these that she realizes that her husband is not as dull as he seems. His eyes, although dead and murky, are vibrant with the vats of souls he keeps, hidden deep beneath the citadel. His lips are red and seem to drip of mortal blood. He is so very much alive. \"And who is this visitor? A lover, perhaps?\" Hades is brimming with cruelty. She will not back down. She's cared for him as he blubbered on their marriage bed sick with self-revulsion. She's seen him when all he does is feed on ichor, too weak to eat fruits and ambrosia. The males of the species are always the weakest. -- Persephone burns two gardens when he denies her. She twists and turns in her sleep, gasping aloud when her husband caresses her forehead as if she were just a petulant child and not his wife. Her anger flares and she feels the pull of magic between her fingers. -- As she grows lonelier, Persephone hears the Titans rattling their bonds, barking rabidly through their imprisonment. Her fingers itch to release them, or goad them on at the least. \"You should not venture so far from the citadel, my queen,\" says an unfamiliar, deep voice. Persephone stills, clenching her fists. \"I believe I know what is best for me.\" \"She is not a goddess, Persephone. Not fully, at least,\" says the voice again. Her eyes narrow swiftly. She turns and is greeted by the dark gaze of Thanatos. Persephone swallows before speaking. \"Who are you talking about?\" \"Eris,\" he speaks plainly. \"The one you want as a visitor.\" Persephone's lips part in confusion. \"How did you know?\" Thanatos smiles, and it's a crooked smile and she can see his thick, jagged teeth. She wants to ask him more, but her organs twist in her gut and her mouth stills. -- Persephone's temper flares like the hot flames that encircle her wrists as she reduces flowers and fruit to cinders. She feeds her own cruelty with the knowledge that one day she will slit her husband's throat.",

    "text": "\"Anubis?\" Kronos asked as he and his fellow elder gods arrived at the door to the bar. \"What are you doing here?\" Not bothering to remind the old guy that his name was actually Apnu, Anubis looked at the group and said, \"My father, the Sun God Ra has been subsumed. He is now a part of that accursed trinity.\" Osiris-Isis-Horus. \"I wish to know if I may join your number, and join you in cursing the heretical children.\" \"Leave the humans alone,\" Odin said, \"and I have no quarrel with you joining.\" \"I do not bother with humans anymore. Nor does Ammitt, who is already inside.\" \"The Eater of Souls got here before we did?\" Coatlique asked. \"A female wolf entered this establishment as I and Ammitt were walking up to here,\" Anubis said. \"She is a friend,\" Kronos said. Odin nodded. \"Let us all enter, then.\" And they did so. The bartender looked over at them, watching them come up to the bar for conversing and cursing. Being a god (and thus minor, despite having created a planet for the Neandertals), he had no problem giving free drinks to the younger generation comprised of Odin and the others, provided they said everything loud enough for him to hear. Svarog was already sidled up to the bar, sound asleep. Ammitt was curled up around his feet, snoring loud enough for the both of them. I dimly remember sleep, Odin mused as the bartender handed them each two bottles of beer. \"I'm surprised your son let you out on a school night, Coatlique,\" Kronos said. A foul look crossed her Moon Goddess face. \"He relented, provided - and I quote, 'i don't care what consensual shit you get up to with them, provided you stay a thousand solar systems away from feathers and anything else.'\" \"Feathers?\" Anubis asked. \"You missed it,\" Odin said, remembering the incident. \"We were all out one evening, and Coatlique here fell asleep.\" Coatlique said, \"These men here could have drawn on my face, balanced beers atop my skull, used my knucklebones for gambling -\" \"We considered it,\" pointed out the she-wolf. \"- but did they do any of that? Nooo, nothing so demure. They rolled me over and placed a feather on my belly.\" \"None of that was a metaphor,\" Odin said. \"In my defense,\" Kronos said, \"it was an ordinary feather. None of us had imbued it with ourselves or with anything else.\" They looked over at where YHWH was drinking alone again at a booth and muttering at them \"Like I would bother.\" Said Kronos to draw everyone's attention back to within the group, \"Anyway, it happened, end of story.\" \"Oh yes, it happens,\" Coatlique said, \"our son slaughtered our relatives -\" \"It happens,\" Odin and Kronos both said before taking swigs of their beers. \"Pagans,\" muttered the she-wolf, meaning mostly - but not entirely - the original meaning of the word: 'those who live in the countryside.' \"What was that saying of pots and kettles?\" Odin mused. \"Like Kvasir's honey mead of poetry, it is on the tip of my tongue.\" The she-wolf growled. \"Back off, Maggotborne. My boy may be a murderer, and his heirs worse still, but at least I know my fault.\" \"Singular?\" Kronos asked mildly. \"Lack of social skills,\" she replied. \"Then again, at least given how they were brought up alone, my boys could have ended up as bad as Odin's nephew. Not til after Nero did mine fall so far.\" Odin's mind translated that as The son of my oath-brother. \"Which one? Jormungandr or Ullr?\" the latter of whom keeps overthrowing me. \"I thought Fenrir, but you make my point.\" Anubis frowned. \"Mine father Ra told me that at these gatherings, any may be attacked - any but other members of the gathering.\" And yet... Kronos explained: \"We take turns being the lone exception at the start of each get-together.\" \"When is the next get-together?\" \"Tomorrow, schedules permitting,\" Coatlique said. \"Every night?\" asked the psychopomp of the dead, who led the deceased to the hall of judgement. \"You do this every night?\" All those times I thought my father was on his ship waiting for the right time to rise above the horizon... \"Not all of us,\" said the she-wolf. \"We don't ALL attend at one time.\" \"There are more of us,\" Odin said, \"and I do not mean we come under other names.\"",

    "text": "Apollo washes Hyacinth's thighs with a tenderness he usually has trouble expressing--but then, this is Hyacinth, and Apollo is almost certain he'd do anything for him. Besides, his thighs are sore and Apollo feels (sheepishly) that he himself is to blame for that, so the longer he lingers the more he hopes it soothes tired muscles and inflamed skin. Hyacinth hums into the touch, wears a still satiated smile on his face, and Apollo finds he must stop from time to time just to kiss him. The truth is, though, that Apollo has this feeling about the future curling in his stomach, and he's not really sure what it is yet, but his gut instinct is telling him that it's nothing good. He pauses again and stares into Hyacinth's face, but nothing comes for him and he's frustrated by the lack of clarity in reading the future he's facing. \"That's the fourth time you've spaced off like that,\" Hyacinth remarks, his voice a gentle tether pulling Apollo's thoughts back to the present. \"Is something the matter?\" He hesitates, but continues in a softer voice, \"I haven't done anything wrong, have I?\" Apollo smiles and shakes his head, reaching up with one hand to stroke the side of the prince's face. \"No, I don't think you could do anything wrong,\" he says, and Hyacinth's brow furrows. \"You shouldn't think me so infallible. I'm human, after all,\" he says, and Apollo nods, face falling. \"You are human, and your fragility frightens me.\" There's something else he wants to say, but he pauses, tries to think of the best way to ask before deciding that plainly might be easiest. \"Hyacinth, if I--if I asked you to join me on Mount Olympus, would you?\" He doesn't answer right away, instead looks away and Apollo thinks of how, if Hyacinth were anyone else, that behavior wouldn't be one he tolerated. As it stands, it's Hyacinth. Apollo would move the stars for him. \"I would have to leave my family,\" he says finally, and it's a statement more of a question. Apollo nods his head. \"You would have me,\" he responds softly, putting a gentle hand on the back of Hyacinth's neck, and Hyacinth nods, uncertain. \"I would have Apollo, who I have here with me now,\" he says, and he shakes his head, as if suddenly remembering who he is. \"I'm--I'm sorry, that was rude and I--I don't mean to sound ungrateful--\" \"Relax, Hyacinth. I understand.\" More than that, he has the patience to hear the apology and, more importantly, accept it--though he wishes Hyacinth didn't feel the need to apologize at all for talking freely. \"It's just--it's a big decision,\" Hyacinth says, face troubled, and Apollo feels terrible about it and moves to kiss him like that might help ease the worried lines of his face. \"Can I--do I have time to think about it?\" He thinks to the worrisome feeling for the future he's received and Apollo wishes he could say no, wishes he could give Hyacinth immortality whether he likes it or not, but he can't. \"I'm not my father,\" he says, finally. \"I won't pressure you into anything.\" The relief on Hyacinth's face is enough of a comfort to Apollo for now. Hyacinth sighs and leans against Apollo. \"I love you,\" he says, \"I do, but it's--I need to think about it, and not because I'd be unsatisfied with you but because I'm afraid how my family might do without me.\" Apollo chuckles and kisses the side of Hyacinth's head. \"Don't worry about it,\" he says. \"Just know that I will love you regardless of the decision, and to just...tell me when you know for sure what you want.\" Hyacinth presses closer against Apollo's side and closes his eyes. \"I'll be sure to decide before I grow old and you change your mind, if that's what you're worried about.\" \"I am not so shallow!\" Apollo protests, and Hyacinth laughs lightly, falling asleep. As his heartbeat slows, Apollo can't help the feeling of dread that keeps growing closer and closer.",

    "text": "Ganymede can...almost relate to the situation, when he hears the news. It's the first time he thinks he's ever seen Apollo so inconsolable and, furthermore, probably the first time Apollo's ever blamed himself so entirely for anything. Ganymede hears the story secondhand from Hermes, but gets the gist of it before he even finishes and wonders, idly, if it might have happened to him if Zeus weren't...well, if Zeus weren't Zeus. Nobody tries quarreling with Apollo and he doesn't start any fights, either, too busy tearing himself up over everything that's happened. At first he does fight with Zeus, though, comes barreling into the main receiving room demanding a way to bring Hyacinth back, to make him immortal, and Ganymede is there for that, keeps himself hidden behind Zeus while Apollo shouts himself hoarse, resorts to pleading and begging with his father for something to be done about it. \"Don't pretend,\" Apollo says, desperate, \"that you wouldn't tear apart the very universe to get Ganymede back!\" \"And don't you pretend,\" Zeus thunders, \"that you and I are remotely the same.\" Ganymede expects Apollo to shout back, expects the argument to escalate as every single one before it has, but instead all that he hears is the soft sound of Apollo weeping in front of all of the other gods. Zeus moves and embraces Apollo, who cries openly into his father's shoulder and cannot stop. \"Orpheus--\" \"Failed, and do you think for a second you'd be able to resist looking at this boy you loved so much? You are my son.\" Zeus pauses, lets out a heavy sigh. \"This is nothing that can be done for him.\" Apollo pulls back and wears a look of grief-stricken madness over his face. \"Then let me give up my immortality so I can die and be with him!\" \"No.\" Zeus frowns, voice solid and cold. \"You cannot expect me to willingly give up my child and you cannot abandon those who pray to you. Even in times like these, you have duties to keep. I'll not allow it.\" With that, Apollo storms away, more angry with the circumstance than with Zeus himself. Zeus lets out another deep sigh and turns around. \"Come with me, Ganymede. I am tired and don't want to be here when he returns from his visit with my brother.\" Ganymede nods and follows him, ignoring the pointed look Hera shoots him. When they reach Zeus's chambers, Ganymede finds himself on his back with his thighs raised and held close together tightly. While Zeus fucks him, he tries to stay in the moment--tries to concentrate on the act and think about the sensations--but his mind drifts and he wonders, again, what it might have been like if he had died before Zeus reached Mount Olympus with him. They lay together, Zeus starting to fall asleep, when he decides to ask the god, \"Was he right when he said you'd tear the universe apart for me?\" Zeus sighs and opens his eyes to look at Ganymede. \"Don't act so surprised,\" he says, wrapping an enormous arm around his shoulders and tugging him closer against his chest. \"I'm more fond of you than anybody will ever be able to fathom. I think he underestimates me--I'd do much more than tear apart the universe.\" Ganymede inhales quickly, breath getting caught in his chest. The immensity of the statement is not lost on him, and he wonders if maybe he should let it sit with that, but he needs to press on or else his mind will not quiet itself. \"Hermes--Hermes said Apollo offered Hyacinth immortality and was waiting for a response.\" He hears Zeus groan as he shifts and adjusts so that Ganymede is more enveloped by his arms and he wonders if maybe the discussion of death is making him uncomfortable. \"I didn't ask because I didn't want to take any chances,\" Zeus says. \"Even if you hated me for it, you would still be alive and I think that might be one of the few things I've ever thought I couldn't be without.\" \"You don't need to seduce me, Zeus. I'm already in your bed,\" Ganymede says teasingly, pressing closer again. Zeus chuckles and it's powerful even if it comes from someone who is still falling asleep. Ganymede falls silent for awhile before finally asking, \"And there's nothing you can do?\" Zeus swallows hard and looks at Ganymede with sad eyes. \"It's not often that I say this,\" he says, \"but it's completely out of my control. Please, go to sleep.\" And it's clear that they're both thinking the same 'what-if' scenario at this point, and Ganymede complies, curls in as close to Zeus as he can and Zeus holds him even closer.",

Anyway, it's not just bad press - you're essentially Death...\" Hades raised an admonishing finger, \"No, Lord of the Underworld. Totally different. I mean I'm not saying Tartarus is a picnic, but you have to admit there have been misunderstandings. Look at you, cast as the eternal villain, god of chaos and storms.

      "It was never particularly busy at this time of day, but none of the few lost souls already scattered about the room gave the two men at the bar a second glance.",

    "text": "Eros pulls at Dionysus's hand in plain view of everybody and even Ganymede gives them something of a reproving look when they excuse themselves from the banquet table and make their way to a secluded hall, where Dionysus presses Eros against one of the enormous columns and kisses against his neck. The thing about the way Dionysus kisses is that it's always intoxicating, always makes Eros keen out and rock his hips up for some kind of friction through their clothes, and the thing about that is that it makes Dionysus want to make Eros cry out even louder. He kneels before Eros, who stares down at him with narrowed eyes. \"What do you think you're doing?\" he asks, knowing exactly what Dionysus plans on doing. \"Isn't this supposed to be the other way around?\" \"Are you going to argue with it?\" Dionysus asks, hands on Eros's thighs, pushing up the hem of his thin chiton. Eros takes a second to think before shaking his head. \"I've seen worse,\" he says, and tangles his hands in Dionysus's hair to press his face in closer. The hairs of Dionysus's beard tickle and scratch Eros's inner thighs, and he's loud about the entire thing. He comes--too soon, in his own opinion--and Dionysus drinks it up and he's left with weak knees leaning against the column for support. \"Was it entirely disagreeable?\" Dionysus asks, standing over Eros and bumping their foreheads together. \"I suppose not,\" Eros says, and he lurches up to kiss Dionysus, bites his bottom lip and draws blood and Dionysus would wince if it wasn't something he enjoyed. \"But, I think you got too many dirty looks leaving with me. Go back in there. I'll wait for you to finish with the banquet--what's revelry without the god of wine? And I'll--I'm sure you can imagine, can't you?\" \"Sometimes I wonder if you're really half as innocent as you act.\" \"I do have a brother,\" Eros says, and he jots off away from Dionysus leaving him with the thought of two of him tangled in bed sheets together and he's not so sure he disagrees with the image at all as he heads back to face the criticism of the other gods.",

    "text": "\"Sing, O Muses, of the immortal feud That hath left countless death, And brought a proud city to her knees, Killed by the hands of her own kin.\" At last, the seemingly unending carnage was finished. Troy was rejoicing, having brought inside her walls the wooden horse left behind by the Akhaians. It will serve as a suitable gift for Tritogeneia, merciful goddess that she is. Yes, the whole of Troy was rejoicing. Except for that solitary figure, set apart not only physically, wearing her chiton as if one in mourning. The noble woman who scorned and was scorned in turn. Cassandra, Princess of Troy. \"My lady, why don't you join them? I am sure they would welcome you,\" Adrasteia said as she approached. \"Dear Troy, you wouldn't understand. Letting that accursed gift enter our walls means your death. Our death,\" Cassandra sighed. \"Cassandra,\" Troy laughs, \"you worry too much. Your visions will surely fail this time.\" Cassandra shook her head. She knew of the curse, no one will believe her. The celebrations continue at the polis' center, while Cassandra cries from within her chambers. She has failed once again. \"Beware the Greeks bearing gifts,\" Laocoon once warned. No one heeded him. It was now time to pay the price. It happened in the middle of the night, while the warriors were asleep. Treachery was something Adrasteia never expected of her sister. The first hour of assault was the worst. Troy's warriors were still under Lyaeus' influence. Although they have fought valiantly, it seems that even Dionysos favoured the enemy. Many were left dead. Only two leaders survived the initial outburst. Antenor, the traitor, protected by Menelaus and Odysseus, who hanged a panther's hide outside Antenor's door. Aeneas, son of Aphrodite, alongside his family was taken out of Troy by his mother. Unfortunately, his wife Creusa was separated from him by the ensuing chaos and was killed. Out of all the immortals, only Makhanitis helped a Trojan that night. \"Blood ran in torrents, drenched was all the earth, As Trojans and their alien helpers died. Here were men lying quelled by bitter death All up and down the city in their blood.\" Adrasteia was there when the impious Ajax violated her dearest Cassandra in the goddess' temple. She swore on Hektor's grave that his sister's rape will not be left unavenged. And in truth, Ajax will be drowned at sea while trying to return to his home. Helen of Sparta (no, never of Troy) was doomed to die at the hands of her former husband Menelaus, but upon seeing her beauty, he dropped his sword, and led her back to the black-sailed Akhaian warships. Adrasteia laughs bitterly at the sight. She hopes she could have revenge on Helen some day, for destroying their lives. Within her own temple, Adrasteia bides her time, watching her land continue to burn. She knows that it is only a matter of time until her sister comes to settle it once and for all. She turns her head when she hears a shuffling of armour. Her sister stands at the entrance, a spear in one hand. \"Amynta,\" she says. \"Adrasteia, I suppose you know why I am here?\" \"You have come to finish it,\" Troy answers. \"It was not my choice. Berenike sent me to do it for her.\" Amynta averts her eyes. Her spear-hand shakes. Adrasteia coughs. Blood comes out of her mouth. She knows that her king has died. \"Promise me you'll let no harm come to my Astyanax.\" \"I'm sorry... adelpha.\" \"Don't be.\" Adrasteia smiles, and Amynta envies her sister. By the time it is over, the grieving Eos has already opened her courts. Troy has fallen.",

    "text": "She's young and innocent, sitting there across from him on the subway train. Naive, childish, curious, her mother warns her every morning to take the safe route, to be a good girl, to be cautious. Kore could hear her mother's sharp worry in her ears as she smiles at the older man across the subway car from her. He's in a business suit, an expensive watch, expensive shoes, expensive glasses. He pretends the newspaper before him is a barrier between their eyes, but she knows he can see her. Her father has made it a goal to sleep with every woman he sees. Kore has the subtle body language of attraction memorized in her young mind. She knows she's beautiful. The boys crowd around her lockers, the teachers give her second looks, her mother's business colleagues watch her walk down the corridors of her mother's firm. Kore is young and innocent, but she is not stupid. He's smart, cunning, she can just tell by his eyes. They're dark behind his thin frames, like his hair, like his suit. The only splash of color on him is the gold watch on his wrist. Not even her father has such an expensive ornament. He shouldn't be on this train. He shouldn't even be in this town. He's richer then anyone she's ever met and she can gather all this from his watch. Behind that paper thin barrier, he's broad chested, firm in body and mind, hands clean but well calloused. He's not afraid of hard work, just not in the position to need it. She can feel his eyes on her, spying past the slim frame of his business glasses. She juts out her chest, crosses her legs, displays them for him, her school uniform working with her for once. One stop, and a few people get off. Two get on and she recrosses her legs slowly. It's a show. She can feel him watching. Second stop and three get off, he flips to the last page of his paper before folding it up to a thin rectangle of bad news and even worse gossip that he sets next to his brief case. The third stop comes and Kore smiles at him when their gazes finally meet. He smiles back before turning and contemplating his destination. She contemplates his handsomeness in the ugly fluorescent light of the subway car. It's unfair how attractive he looks across from her. Kore's friends won't believe her when she tells them tomorrow at lunch, about how she flirted with a older man, about how he flirted back. How she left her backpack on the subway car in absent thought, floating on that smile she had shared with her handsome stranger. She wonders how cross her mother will be, already feeling the impending doom crater her shoulders. Her school is expensive, her father is a dead beat, and her mother is strict, rigid, totally against Kore even going to a co-ed school let alone being on the same planet as a male. She doesn't hear the approaching car, or see it stop, but she notices when the door opens and her handsome stranger steps out. He's holding her backpack, he's got that smile on his lips, he's looking at her like she's perfect and endearing. She goes weak in the knees, she gets all a-flustered. It's embarrassing. It's dangerous. Most of all, it's amazing. \"You left this.\" He greets her and she manages not to fall to her knees. His voice is calm and strong, like it never raises in anger or succumbs to depression. Her parents could never claim such a tone. She goes nearer and he smells like soft earth and metal. It's odd, alluring, draws her closer till she is standing before him, smoothing down her skirt. \"Ah, yes, thank you.\" She reaches for the backpack, but he doesn't offer it to her. She lowers her hand. \"I'm Ades Pluoton.\" He introduces himself, and she's all giddy now. She has a name! Her handsome stranger is no longer nameless. \"Kore. Kore Opis.\" She extends her hand, polite and soft. As much as she'd like to be seductive like her Aunt, she has no skill for it. He doesn't seem to mind much. He finally offers her backpack and leans back on his sleek car. There's no driver, no guard. His tie is gone, his watch, too. There's a transition from business to man, and she likes him like this, all slow and burning. He reminds her of the coals in her grandmother's hearth, at the winter home. She's warmed by his presence as much as she is cooled. He reaches out with a hand and touches her hot cheek, that smooth smile on his face. He looks chipped from marble, unblemished and free of stain. It's a harsh difference from her suntanned skin. There are blemishes galore on her body. Scars from play, healed pimples from early puberty days, a burn at the back of neck from her hair straightener. She feels small and a child in front him but then he tips her head, meets her gaze. His pupils are wide, his body is shifted towards her and his obvious attraction is stirring her body from her toes up. \"It was nice to meet you.\" He murmurs. She shivers, the low tone tugging at her gut in unfamiliar, odd ways. She'd like to figure out what that leads to. It makes her feel restless. He steps back, pulls out of their space they shared, taking his cool warmth with him. She begins to panic. \"Will I see you again?\" She asks as he goes round to the front of his car. He pauses, looking back at her. He looks surprised and pleased. He also has guilt and hesitance swimming in his stance. \"When will I see you again?\" She changes it to a command. His brow raises, his body turning to face her, to face this situation. At least he's not running away. \"You're not 18.\" He states. It's her turn to raise a brow. \"No, I'm not. But I'm not illegal.\" She decides on and he looks amused at her answer. \"They never are.\" He sighs. She stiffens at that, frowning at him. She is young and innocent, but she is not stupid. \"Would you like I.D.? D.N.A.?\" She offers, snappishly, offended. He tilts his head and comes back in to their little circle of time. \"How would your father feel about this? Your mother?\" He demands back. She's thrown out their circle this time, surprised, taken off guard by such an accusatory prod. \"If my father even notices, gods be praised. And my mother thinks locking me up in my room with barred windows is a sane idea.\" She answers, not liking this. This wasn't supposed to happen. He's supposed to be lulled under her charm and she his. They're supposed to be star-struck lovers. At least until she's no longer young and innocent. She's sick of being naive. She's sick of being young. She's sick of being at the will of her mother, at the will of her father, at the will of people who have never taken the effort to truly know her. She wanted this man to break her, to ruin her, to teach her. She wanted this man to worship her, to want her, to know her. He should want to know her. She wants someone to want to. \"If you didn't want this, you wouldn't have chased after me. You would have sent my bag in the mail, by person, something. No. You came after me. You smiled at me. You introduced yourself and smiled at me. How would your father and mother feel about that?\" She scowls at him. He looks shocked at such a statement, at her knowledge of him so soon in to their acquaintanceship. She watches his face morph back in to that smile, the one that gives her butterflies in her stomach and warmth in her limbs. \"You're right. Both of us fools, I'm afraid.\" He agrees with her, a playful tone to his voice, a quiet laugh in his eyes. It's pleasant on him, sweet and rare, she can tell. \"I'm naive. You have no excuse.\" She says but she's smiling back, a grin pulling at her lips and it's their space again, all warmth and sweet earth smell. He hums, a rumble in his chest that pleases her greatly. He leans forward and she lets her eyes flutter close. Oh, gods, he's going to kiss her. He's going to kiss her. And he does, it's just on her cheek. She tries to be disappointed, but it's gentle and slightly moist. His body is solid and steady before her, like stone and she fancies him truly made of marble. \"When will I see you again?\" She asks softly, a wish in the quiet between their bodies. \"I'll find you.\" He promises and she feels it down to her toes. He gives her one last smile, before getting in to his car and driving off. She memorizes it, imagines it as a dark chariot he's going to use to whisk her away from her troubling mother and absent father. She gives its retreating frame one last smile before turning back home. Well, at least for now.",

    "text": "The marriage of King Pirithous to the Lady Hippodamia was all Merlin had heard about since Hades knew when and he couldn't wait for it to be over. The king's men had scoured the villages all throughout Thessaly to find only the most beautiful of youths to serve at the feast. Merlin had never considered himself particularly beautiful, in fact he'd never really considered it, the goats didn't care what he looked like... Alright there had been that incident with Apollo a few months back, which had left him feeling pretty fucking desirable, but after that he'd gone back to the pool several times and never glimpsed the god again, so he had fallen back into his old routine of lonely nights out in the hills, only spending the odd night back in the village in his mother's hut, and very little time amongst his peers. So when he had lined up with the other boys, hair untrimmed and the grime of a week in the wild on his skin he had not expected to be singled out for this particular honour. He had of course protested, but the men had given his mother enough coin to pay someone to take on hs work and still have plenty left over to stock up for the winter. And the implication had been that if he refused they'd take the money back, and take him anyway. So here he was, skin scrubbed so clean it shone and wearing a chiton so short his mother would have fainted if she saw it, with vines artfully woven into his curly hair, kohl lining his eyes and red berry juice staining his lips. They had been waiting under the pines for an hour while the ceremony was conducted so at least they were in the shade, but insects buzzed irritatingly around them, attracted to the perfume perhaps and he wanted to just get on with it. He sighed and scratched at a spot where the vines were tickling his scalp, only to have his hand smacked away by the matron who was in charge of marshalling them for the day. \"Stop that, boy,\" she hissed, \"You know how long it took to get that right. Stand up straight and hold the jug like I showed you, you're going to spill it everywhere. Again.\" She tutted and moved on to fuss over a boy whose tunic kept slipping off his shoulder, he wouldn't be surprised if she decided to pin it straight to his flesh, the bloodstains would be unfortunate but at least he would look tidy. Trumpets sounded and the guests began to spill down the hillside from the temple, eager to avail themselves of the famed Thessalian hospitality. Breaking into a canter, the centaurs were the first to make it to the heavily laden tables, snatching up drinking vessels and shouting for wine. Merlin and the other youths scurried amongst them filling their bowls and dashing back to refill their jugs, the rest of the guests arrived and the newly married couple took their place on the dais. With the king he could see a man who must be Theseus, the king's closest friend and a hero whose fame had reached even Ealdor, they had their own cupbearers so Merlin had no excuse to get a closer look at them but he took the opportunity of a lull to study the other guests. The centaurs were certainly impressive creatures, their human torsos were heavily muscled and most of them were much hairier than the men Merlin was used to seeing, their thick beards merging into chest hair and then trailing down their stomachs to join with the glossy coats of their horse bodies. They were the loudest of the guests and the rudest, their stamping hooves and flicking tails made Merlin nervous and he clutched his wine-jug tightly. He circled a long table and caught the eye of a young Lapith with dark hair and a close cropped beard who gestured him over with a half smile. There was something about the man's eyes that Merlin liked so he gave him a big grin as he filled his cup. They were kind eyes, though sad, he thought. \"My lord.\" He said, with a small bow when he had finished pouring, and the young man returned his bow with a twinkle in his eye. Merlin had to keep moving but he decided to make sure he came back to this table often. Further down the table he got a bit of a shock though. Haughty blue eyes met his and long fingers gestured towards a bowl on the table. He hesitated for only a moment but it was long enough to hear a voice he knew well, arrogance and entitlement dripping from every syllable. \"Are you deficient boy? Pour the wine and stop gaping like a fish.\" Those eyes practically looked through him, did he not recognise him? Merlin scowled and filled Apollo's cup, muttering under his breath, he considered upending the jug over the god's stupid golden head, but he restrained himself admirably. Sitting next to Apollo, naturally, was the Lady Artemis, she was regarding Merlin with a smirk as he filled her cup and he knew she recognised him. Clearly Apollo just thought it beneath him to remember all the goatherds he shagged, Merlin marched away to refill his jug before he did something regrettable. Over the course of the afternoon and evening Merlin found himself constantly drawn back to the young man with the sad eyes, even though he was seated near the Prat, but definitely not because he was seated near the Prat, Merlin wasn't that lame. He found out that his name was Caeneus, that he was a warrior but had left his home and spent his time wandering the land looking for people he could assist, he didn't say this in a bragging way though and Merlin's heart warmed even more towards him. As evening drew on and a multitude of lamps were lit, Merlin and the other boys became increasingly reluctant to approach some of the guests, the centaurs were raucously drunk and had taken to grabbing at any boy or woman who came near them, Hylas had had his tunic ripped nearly off and Antiokus was sporting a large purple bruise that a brute called Eurytion had sucked into his neck. Merlin was fuming from the latest assault when next he came back to Caeneus. \"I am truly sorry that you must endure such treatment,\" Caeneus said, his voice dropped, \"Were they not the guests and kinfolk of our king...\" Merlin slammed the jug down. \"They dress us up as whores, is it any wonder we are treated as such?\" Caeneus took his wrist, his hand was cool and he soothed his thumb over Merlin's racing pulse. \"I would not treat you as a whore, if you would consent to spend the night with me.\" His dark eyes were large and open and Merlin felt his belly tighten as he gazed into them, the thumb still stroked his wrist and Merlin reached out to take his other hand. \"I would like that.\" He murmured, and bent down to touch Caeneus's lips with his own. Cruel laughter erupted just behind Merlin, he let go and spun around to see the centaur he had heard called Latreus leering at him. \"You're wasting your time there, jackdaw,\" he guffawed, his cronies joining in behind him, \"That one's not even a real man, probably hasn't even got a cock, I'll show you a real cock...\" His great forehooves crashed onto the table on either side of Merlin's body, scattering crockery and Merlin had just one horrific moment to see Latreus's enormous phallus slip from its sheath before he was spun by the hair and shoved forwards over the table. He sobbed as the slimy tip of the monstrous thing slid between his legs and the centaur tugged at his skimpy undergarments. He was vaguely aware of shouting and the sound of swords being drawn and then his back was drenched in hot liquid. Blood. It poured over his shoulders onto the table and he turned to see Caeneus topple Latreus to the ground, blood still spurting from his open throat. \"Behind you!\" Shouted Merlin, and Caeneus wheeled around in time to parry a blow from one of the other centaurs, he was a blur, hacking and stabbing at three centaurs now who surrounded him, towering over him. When Merlin looked around for help he saw fighting had broken out all over. A woman screamed and Merlin saw a centaur descending from the royal dais with the queen slung over his shoulder. \"Oh well done Merlin, really, remind me to invite you to my next party.\" Came an amused voice to his side. Merlin whirled on Apollo, really not in the mood for any of his shit. \"Help him,\" he shouted, his voice painfully shrill. He fumbled for the hilt of Apollo's sword. \"Or if you're not going to, I will.\" \"Oh for...\" Apollo batted his hand away and drew the sword himself. \"Just get down will you?\" He shoved Merlin under the table and joined the fray, fighting back to back with Caeneus. From his hiding place Merlin saw one of his companions, Antiokus he thought, being dragged into the trees, and, whispering a magic word, he held his hand out towards a branch and dropped it directly onto the centaur's back. It didn't kill him, but it gave the boy the chance to sprint into the woods and find cover. Merlin cracked a wine-jug over the head of another centaur which gave a Lapith warrior the opening he needed to strike a killing blow. He searched for Caeneus in the melee and found him, he had become separated from Apollo but was fighting in unison with another Lapith man. Merlin choked on a cry when he saw Caeneus run through with a sword, he stumbled and clutched his side and Merlin was ready to run to him, but miraculously he straightened, let out a bellow and continued the battle. Merlin was shocked, he had thought the young hero human but clearly there was more to him than that, while Merlin watched he took several wounds which should have been mortal and they barely slowed him down, the centaurs roared with frustration and began hurling boulders and tree branches at him, Merlin tried to deflect them where he could but while he was distracted a red-bearded centaur snatched him up from under the table and galloped for the woods. Merlin struggled and kicked but he was held fast. The centaur looked down at him and laughed, his bloodshot eyes watery with drink. His laughter cut short as a slender arrow slid through one eye and thudded in the back of his skull, a stream of red tears gushing from the socket. Merlin fell under his stumbling hooves as he tumbled forwards, his momentum carrying him over in a way that must have broken his neck if the arrow had not already done its work. Merlin sat up, blinking, and saw a chariot hurtling towards him out of the darkness. One of its two occupants held a bow and was firing a steady volley of arrows over Merlin's head, the other held the reins of two pale horses, steering them towards where Merlin sat and bending down to scoop him up as they passed, the hooves barely missing Merlin's head. He would be happy if he never saw another horse's hoof again. \"Stay down this time.\" Apollo shouted as he wheeled the chariot back around and Artemis nocked another arrow. As they made another pass, Artemis felling three more centaurs, Merlin saw that the spot where Caeneus had been fighting was now a small mound of boulders and tree trunks, he could hear the warrior's cries of anguish and realised with horror that his friend was crushed under that mass, undying, but broken. Without thought he held out his hand and sent a bolt of pure energy towards the mound. \"Release,\" he shouted, unable to form a coherent spell, but throwing everything he had at it \"RELEASE.\" A small spark of gold darted up from the pile and sped towards him where he rattled on the footbed of the chariot. It was a small golden bird, its curved wings and sharp beak marking it as a falcon, though like none Merlin had ever seen. It kept pace with the carriage for a minute and then shot directly upwards into the dark sky, and if Merlin thought he heard a whispered \"Thank you\" over the rattle of the wheels, well he kept that to himself. As the fighting died down, the drunken centaurs completely overcome, Apollo steered the chariot away from the carnage and through the forest. He stopped by a river bank and Merlin crawled from the vehicle and down to the water. His whole body was shaking as the tension burned out of his limbs. He gulped down water and then threw it back up, the fast flow catching his bile and whisking it away. The skin on his back and neck felt tight where the centaur's thick blood was drying and he peeled off his tunic and crawled into the cold water. He scrubbed himself viciously, tearing the vines out of his matted hair. When he emerged in just his smallclothes, tears coursing down his cheeks, Apollo caught him and held him to his warm chest, Merlin was still trembling and his heart raced. \"Hush,\" he whispered, \"It's alright, you're alright.\" \"It's not alright,\" Merlin choked out, \"It's not.\" He thumped his fist against the perfect chest in front of him, and then again for good measure. His legs gave out and Apollo sunk to the floor with him, clasping him tight until his sobs diminished and he pulled away, scrubbing his face. \"I should have saved him,\" said Merlin miserably, \"Found another way to get him out, not turned him into a stupid bird, I don't know if I could change him back even if I found him...\" Apollo shrugged and leaned back on his hands. \"Caeneus is on his path, you couldn't have changed that, some mortals can make their own destiny, others have their story written out for them.\" \"Who was he?\" Artemis came and sat with them and it was she who replied. \"Caeneus was born Caenis, daughter of Elatus, as she grew to womanhood she became famed for her indomitable spirit, her bravery and kindness. She caught the attention of our uncle, Poseidon, and was attacked and raped by him, afterwards he granted her wish to become a man, a warrior, so that she could defend herself and others in the future.\" \"That's why Latreus mocked her, his, manhood...\" Apollo added. \"He chose to become a man,\" said Merlin fervently, after a moment of thought, \"That makes him as much, maybe more of a man than us who happened to be born that way...\" Artemis smiled, \"The boy has wisdom. If Caenis had come to me though, I would have taught her to protect herself without having to give up her womanhood.\" \"And what use do you make of your precious womanhood, sister?\" Asked Apollo with a smirk. She laughed and stood, slinging her quiver over her shoulder. \"I refuse to get sucked into another of your witless attempts to get between my legs. Womanhood is not determined by the amount of time spent on one's back.\" She kissed Apollo fondly on the head. \"I'll leave you boys to it then. Don't be gentle with him Merlin.\" And with that she strode into the forest. Merlin stared into the swiftly flowing water, thinking of sad brown eyes and the sense of loneliness he'd felt in Caeneus, they could have been good friends, he knew it, but maybe their paths would cross again someday. The great heroes had their destiny written in the stars, and Merlin was just a simple goatherd, he wasn't meant to mix with these sorts of people. \"Sooo,\" said Apollo grinning sideways at him, \"Do you want to fuck?\" Merlin glanced up to the lightening sky and shook his head. \"Not really in the mood.\" He said. \"But could you... Could you take me home?\" \"Of course... And then maybe we can\"- Merlin cut him off with a laugh, \"Yeah, maybe.\" \"Good enough for me,\" said Apollo as he grabbed Merlin by the waist and tugged him towards the golden chariot. Merlin stood behind him, arms tight around his chest, his body was warm in the cool morning air and Merlin snuggled into it resting his chin on one broad shoulder as the horses reared and began their ascent to the heavens.",

      "And then maybe we can\"- Merlin cut him off with a laugh, \"Yeah, maybe.\"",
      "\"Good enough for me,\" said Apollo as he grabbed Merlin by the waist and tugged him towards the golden chariot.",
      "Merlin stood behind him, arms tight around his chest, his body was warm in the cool morning air and Merlin snuggled into it resting his chin on one broad shoulder as the horses reared and began their ascent to the heavens."

    "text": "On Persephone's first return to Hades - the second winter - Demeter plagued the Underworld with just that: a freezing, relentless winter. (A fact which centuries later, and much to Demeter's amusement, inspired Dante's vision of a cold Hell.) She'd never liked Hades, and had been working on the idea for a while; been mulling it over even before the lowly bastard had the gall to take her Kore from her, but afterwards she had truly found herself set on giving him this particular gem of a predicament. However, the unique aspects of the Underworld - a key one being that it didn't really have weather - served as roadblocks, and all in all her brilliantly devious plan proved unfortunately difficult. But Demeter feared not. For she knew something about herself that many forgot, and often at their own peril; she was not just the goddess of Agriculture, as wonderful and truly under appreciated as that was. Oh no, she was so, so much more than that. If one were to look at her throne, which sits gloriously upon Olympus, closely enough to see the finer details and engravings etched upon it with sacred ink millennia ago, they would see, in very fine print, waaaaay under all the other common titles, the following: Demeter Thesmophoros: goddess of determinedness, and fucking shit up in far classier ways than some other female Olympians she could mention. So, with some hard work, elbow grease, and a lot of bargaining with Circe over the secrets to darker and somewhat questionable magic, Demeter had made her way by the end of Persephone's first six month return to Olympus. And while it was truly glorious and probably the greatest prank ever played by anyone ever, as many on Olympus agreed, Demeter felt that too many overlooked the stunning poetic justice of it all. But still, she would be lying if she said she didn't enjoy her customary response every time some god asked her about her achievement: a nonchalant shrug of the shoulders, a vague gesture with her hand (which was usually holding a glass of wine), and a simple, \"I made Hell freeze over.\" Meanwhile, Hades was excessively displeased. The Underworld had dissolved into chaos, and as if his workday wasn't already packed enough with absurd trials and tests to his sanity, he now had to delegate a dozen more duties so as to keep some semblance of order until the larger issue was somehow resolved. Having to distribute blankets to those in the Fields of Asphodel as well as the newcomers who were still waiting at the gates was not just inconvenient, it was quite possibly massively inappropriate! Who knew how many of the waiting dead were sociopathic murderers and rapists that would be sent to the Fields of Punishment? Hades certainly wasn't distributing blankets and earmuffs to those already suffering their punishments; in fact, that was proving to be the only upside to his domain freezing over: new and unique additions to the trials of those who led less than exemplary lives before their deaths. Tantalus was still suffering his truly clever punishment of being within hand's reach of food and water and yet never being able to enjoy it, but with the addition of being stuck in the middle of a now-frozen pool of water. And Hades couldn't wait to see how Sisyphus fared his repeated attempts at pushing that ridiculous boulder up that ridiculous hill, now with the added effects of the hill being slick with ice. It was all rather hilarious, actually. Hades amusement was short-lived, however. Just the thought of Charon and even more hoards of the waiting dead being stranded on the far end of the now-frozen river Styx was enough to send him back into a dark cloud of frustration. Hades had received a message from Charon almost immediately after this...Ice Age hit his domain, asking how he should ferry the newly dead across the river under the current circumstances, and Hades was this close to telling him to just ice skate them all across, for all he cared. It had taken Hades about 0.1 seconds to realize what had happened and who had made it happen after the frozen tundra had hit, and as much as it pained him he couldn't say he was surprised. He'd never really liked Demeter much, but that was mainly because she'd always seemed to absolutely loathe him, even before the business with Persephone. He'd have been a fool to have not expected further retribution from Demeter, but to be perfectly honest, he hadn't expected it quite so soon, and he certainly hadn't expected this. How did she even pull this off? Yes, her transformation of the mortals' land from plentiful crops to barren wastelands during her daughter's, er, disappearance had been extreme and unexpected, but at least it had made sense. How she had managed to spread her powers to his domain was beyond him, and it not only made him angry, it made him uncomfortable. He'd ruled his land for a very long time with little to no incident - better than his brothers could say - and such a breach in the very fabric of its being was startling to say the least. As Hades walked back to the castle his boots crunched in the snow that was now underfoot; he shook his head, muttering under his breath to himself. He would probably have to bring this whole affair to Olympus, but he didn't want to be too rash. He knew Persephone loved her mother and he didn't wish for his wife to feel that she was the cause of further animosity between himself and Demeter. Things had been somewhat...rocky between himself and his new wife since her return, but overall he thought things had been going well. And however unsure he felt about Persephone's feelings or how to approach her much of the time, he knew that the last thing he wanted was to overreact to what was truly a ridiculous, run-of-the-mill Olympian situation, and cause trouble of any sort with Persephone in the process. And so, pulling his fur-lined cloak tighter around himself - it really was absurdly cold - he passed back under the gates to his palace, intent on finding Thanatos and hashing out what the next plan of action was. When he came to the throne room, he found Persephone, Hecate, and Thanatos sitting on the steps that lead up to his and his wife's thrones; they were all wrapped in fur-lined cloaks and sitting closer than he thought they all normally would, apparently for heat. Thanatos and Hecate were engaged in what looked like their usual correspondence: Hecate firing off her words assuredly and Thanatos looking rather flustered in response. Persephone was looking back and forth between the two of them amusedly - Hades' heart clenched at this. He had been hugely glad and relieved when it had become quickly apparent that she got along with Thanatos and Hecate, even to the point of genuine friendship, it would appear. \"There he is,\" Hecate said, a little louder as he approached. \"We were just talking about you.\" Hades made a deliberate attempt to not show how unsettled he was by that prospect. \"Oh?\" \"Yes, yes,\" Hecate said, in that smooth, self-assured voice of hers. \"And how very predictable this whole ordeal is of you.\" Hades started. \"Excuse me?\" \"Our lord, always stirring up trouble - completely unpredictable and wild.\" Hecate shook her head, as if massively disappointed in him. \"How long must the madness go on? When will you be satisfied?\" \"I believe Hecate is employing sarcasm, my lord,\" Thanatos cut in. \"Yes, I'm aware of that now,\" Hades said, rolling his eyes. Glancing towards Persephone, he saw that she still looked amused, a slight twinkle in her eyes, a flush on her cheeks. She had a pair of earmuffs on over her long blond hair, and she was hugging her legs to herself - she looked lovely, actually. He realized he was staring when her eyes flickered to his. Hades broke his gaze, cleared his throat, and looked to Thanatos and Hecate. \"So - any ideas as how to handle our current predicament?\" Hecate waved a hand and her notepad appeared before her. \"I'm already on it.\" She held up her notes for the group to see, displaying what looked like a series of complicated mathematical equations. \"There's dark magic in this spectacular - if I say so myself - curse. Lady Demeter probably consulted Circe or Medea. Honestly, I'm a little offended she didn't come to me.\" Ignoring the borderline-treasonous remarks made by Hecate, Hades took the notes from her, analyzing them closer. \"Isn't this algebra?\" he inquired after a few moment, looking at her dubiously. Hecate took the papers back, holding them protectively. \"Algebra and dark magic are very closely linked.\" She nodded. \"The mortals don't know this yet, but they will.\" She gave a dark laugh. \"Oh, they will.\" \"How long will it take you to complete the counter-curse, then?\" Hades asked. \"Not long. In the meantime we'll all just have to bundle up and cuddle up, I suppose.\" She threw a wink at Thanatos, who would have blushed, Hades was sure, if he didn't have a title such as God of Death to live up to. Instead he just shifted somewhat uncomfortably. An uncomfortable silence followed. A few moment passed, and Hades was ready to depart and see to Charon or something, but Persephone spoke, catching him off-guard. \"Did you see Sisyphus?\" she said, looking at each of their faces in turn, smiling shyly. \"He keeps slipping...\" she trailed off, as though uncertain that her amusement was founded. However, Thanatos, Hecate, and Hades were already smiling. \"Oh, yes,\" Hecate laughed. \"I'm tempted to leave the Underworld in this state just for that continual amusement.\" Hades gave her a look. \"I don't think it'll be necessary to go that far,\" he said. \"But we may have to alter the exact terms of his punishment after this all blows over...\" Hecate shrugged and Thanatos raised his eyebrows in agreement, Persephone laughing softly. \"Well, I need to go see to Charon's current dilemma,\" Hades said, nodding to the group. He wasn't sure how much of a medium between casual and formal he should strike, or even how to do so. \"Attempt to go about your days as...normally as possible.\" As he was about to turn, Persephone stood, pulling her cloak more tightly around herself. \"I'll go with you.\" He looked at her, surprised, and she added, \"If you don't mind.\" \"Of course not,\" he said. After a moment's hesitation he held out his arm to her, and she descended from the step she'd been sitting on, taking it and walking out of the throne room with him, leaving Hecate and Thanatos on the steps. \"Look at those crazy kids go,\" Hecate said once they were gone. \"I'd dare to say they may even -\" she leaned in closer to Thanatos, bringing her lips to his ear \"- like each other.\" Thanatos leaned back, meeting her eyes as steadily as he could in such close proximity. \"You are massively inappropriate.\" \"You wouldn't know what to do with me if I weren't.\" \"I'll dare to imagine.\" \"Well,\" Hecate said, shrugging, \"I suppose we'll never know.\" \"I suppose not.\" \"Or at least, not until hell freezes over.\" She met his eyes quickly, and he immediately groaned, seeing exactly where she was going with this. \"Or apparently not! Ha-ha-ha!\" \"You've been waiting to use that all day, haven't you?\" Thanatos sighed. \"Thanny, please - I've been waiting to use that my entire life.\"",
    "sentences": [
      "On Persephone's first return to Hades - the second winter - Demeter plagued the Underworld with just that: a freezing, relentless winter.",
      "(A fact which centuries later, and much to Demeter's amusement, inspired Dante's vision of a cold Hell.)",
      "She'd never liked Hades, and had been working on the idea for a while; been mulling it over even before the lowly bastard had the gall to take her Kore from her, but afterwards she had truly found herself set on giving him this particular gem of a predicament.",
      "However, the unique aspects of the Underworld - a key one being that it didn't really have weather - served as roadblocks, and all in all her brilliantly devious plan proved unfortunately difficult.",
      "But Demeter feared not.",
      "For she knew something about herself that many forgot, and often at their own peril; she was not just the goddess of Agriculture, as wonderful and truly under appreciated as that was.",
      "Oh no, she was so, so much more than that.",
      "If one were to look at her throne, which sits gloriously upon Olympus, closely enough to see the finer details and engravings etched upon it with sacred ink millennia ago, they would see, in very fine print, waaaaay under all the other common titles, the following: Demeter Thesmophoros: goddess of determinedness, and fucking shit up in far classier ways than some other female Olympians she could mention.",
      "So, with some hard work, elbow grease, and a lot of bargaining with Circe over the secrets to darker and somewhat questionable magic, Demeter had made her way by the end of Persephone's first six month return to Olympus.",
      "And while it was truly glorious and probably the greatest prank ever played by anyone ever, as many on Olympus agreed, Demeter felt that too many overlooked the stunning poetic justice of it all.",
      "But still, she would be lying if she said she didn't enjoy her customary response every time some god asked her about her achievement: a nonchalant shrug of the shoulders, a vague gesture with her hand (which was usually holding a glass of wine), and a simple, \"I made Hell freeze over.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Hades was excessively displeased.",
      "The Underworld had dissolved into chaos, and as if his workday wasn't already packed enough with absurd trials and tests to his sanity, he now had to delegate a dozen more duties so as to keep some semblance of order until the larger issue was somehow resolved.",
      "Having to distribute blankets to those in the Fields of Asphodel as well as the newcomers who were still waiting at the gates was not just inconvenient, it was quite possibly massively inappropriate!",
      "Who knew how many of the waiting dead were sociopathic murderers and rapists that would be sent to the Fields of Punishment?",
      "Hades certainly wasn't distributing blankets and earmuffs to those already suffering their punishments; in fact, that was proving to be the only upside to his domain freezing over: new and unique additions to the trials of those who led less than exemplary lives before their deaths.",
      "Tantalus was still suffering his truly clever punishment of being within hand's reach of food and water and yet never being able to enjoy it, but with the addition of being stuck in the middle of a now-frozen pool of water.",
      "And Hades couldn't wait to see how Sisyphus fared his repeated attempts at pushing that ridiculous boulder up that ridiculous hill, now with the added effects of the hill being slick with ice.",
      "It was all rather hilarious, actually.",
      "Hades amusement was short-lived, however.",
      "Just the thought of Charon and even more hoards of the waiting dead being stranded on the far end of the now-frozen river Styx was enough to send him back into a dark cloud of frustration.",
      "Hades had received a message from Charon almost immediately after this...Ice Age hit his domain, asking how he should ferry the newly dead across the river under the current circumstances, and Hades was this close to telling him to just ice skate them all across, for all he cared.",
      "It had taken Hades about 0.1 seconds to realize what had happened and who had made it happen after the frozen tundra had hit, and as much as it pained him he couldn't say he was surprised.",
      "He'd never really liked Demeter much, but that was mainly because she'd always seemed to absolutely loathe him, even before the business with Persephone.",
      "He'd have been a fool to have not expected further retribution from Demeter, but to be perfectly honest, he hadn't expected it quite so soon, and he certainly hadn't expected this.",
      "How did she even pull this off?",
      "Yes, her transformation of the mortals' land from plentiful crops to barren wastelands during her daughter's, er, disappearance had been extreme and unexpected, but at least it had made sense.",
      "How she had managed to spread her powers to his domain was beyond him, and it not only made him angry, it made him uncomfortable.",
      "He'd ruled his land for a very long time with little to no incident - better than his brothers could say - and such a breach in the very fabric of its being was startling to say the least.",
      "As Hades walked back to the castle his boots crunched in the snow that was now underfoot; he shook his head, muttering under his breath to himself.",
      "He would probably have to bring this whole affair to Olympus, but he didn't want to be too rash.",
      "He knew Persephone loved her mother and he didn't wish for his wife to feel that she was the cause of further animosity between himself and Demeter.",
      "Things had been somewhat...rocky between himself and his new wife since her return, but overall he thought things had been going well.",
      "And however unsure he felt about Persephone's feelings or how to approach her much of the time, he knew that the last thing he wanted was to overreact to what was truly a ridiculous, run-of-the-mill Olympian situation, and cause trouble of any sort with Persephone in the process.",
      "And so, pulling his fur-lined cloak tighter around himself - it really was absurdly cold - he passed back under the gates to his palace, intent on finding Thanatos and hashing out what the next plan of action was.",
      "When he came to the throne room, he found Persephone, Hecate, and Thanatos sitting on the steps that lead up to his and his wife's thrones; they were all wrapped in fur-lined cloaks and sitting closer than he thought they all normally would, apparently for heat.",
      "Thanatos and Hecate were engaged in what looked like their usual correspondence: Hecate firing off her words assuredly and Thanatos looking rather flustered in response.",
      "Persephone was looking back and forth between the two of them amusedly - Hades' heart clenched at this.",
      "He had been hugely glad and relieved when it had become quickly apparent that she got along with Thanatos and Hecate, even to the point of genuine friendship, it would appear.",
      "\"There he is,\" Hecate said, a little louder as he approached.",
      "\"We were just talking about you.\"",
      "Hades made a deliberate attempt to not show how unsettled he was by that prospect.",
      "\"Oh?\"",
      "\"Yes, yes,\" Hecate said, in that smooth, self-assured voice of hers.",
      "\"And how very predictable this whole ordeal is of you.\"",
      "Hades started.",
      "\"Excuse me?\"",
      "\"Our lord, always stirring up trouble - completely unpredictable and wild.\"",
      "Hecate shook her head, as if massively disappointed in him.",
      "\"How long must the madness go on?",
      "When will you be satisfied?\"",
      "\"I believe Hecate is employing sarcasm, my lord,\" Thanatos cut in.",
      "\"Yes, I'm aware of that now,\" Hades said, rolling his eyes.",
      "Glancing towards Persephone, he saw that she still looked amused, a slight twinkle in her eyes, a flush on her cheeks.",
      "She had a pair of earmuffs on over her long blond hair, and she was hugging her legs to herself - she looked lovely, actually.",
      "He realized he was staring when her eyes flickered to his.",
      "Hades broke his gaze, cleared his throat, and looked to Thanatos and Hecate.",
      "\"So - any ideas as how to handle our current predicament?\" Hecate waved a hand and her notepad appeared before her.",
      "\"I'm already on it.\"",
      "She held up her notes for the group to see, displaying what looked like a series of complicated mathematical equations.",
      "\"There's dark magic in this spectacular - if I say so myself - curse.",
      "Lady Demeter probably consulted Circe or Medea.",
      "Honestly, I'm a little offended she didn't come to me.\"",
      "Ignoring the borderline-treasonous remarks made by Hecate, Hades took the notes from her, analyzing them closer.",
      "\"Isn't this algebra?\" he inquired after a few moment, looking at her dubiously.",
      "Hecate took the papers back, holding them protectively.",
      "\"Algebra and dark magic are very closely linked.\"",
      "She nodded.",
      "\"The mortals don't know this yet, but they will.\"",
      "She gave a dark laugh.",
      "\"Oh, they will.\"",
      "\"How long will it take you to complete the counter-curse, then?\" Hades asked.",
      "\"Not long.",
      "In the meantime we'll all just have to bundle up and cuddle up, I suppose.\"",
      "She threw a wink at Thanatos, who would have blushed, Hades was sure, if he didn't have a title such as God of Death to live up to.",
      "Instead he just shifted somewhat uncomfortably.",
      "An uncomfortable silence followed.",
      "A few moment passed, and Hades was ready to depart and see to Charon or something, but Persephone spoke, catching him off-guard.",
      "\"Did you see Sisyphus?\" she said, looking at each of their faces in turn, smiling shyly.",
      "\"He keeps slipping...\" she trailed off, as though uncertain that her amusement was founded.",
      "However, Thanatos, Hecate, and Hades were already smiling.",

      "\"Or apparently not!",
      "Ha-ha-ha!\"",
      "\"You've been waiting to use that all day, haven't you?\" Thanatos sighed.",
      "\"Thanny, please - I've been waiting to use that my entire life.\""

    "text": "Aphrodite, goddess of love, wasn't feeling very loving right now. In fact, she badly wanted to hit someone. In order of preference, her lover, her husband, and all the other gods for making her feel so..... humiliated! Okay, so it was maybe just the teensiest little bit her fault. Okay, mostly her fault. But that didn't mean someone wasn't going to pay! She'd never wanted to marry Hephaestos. Honestly, god of metalwork? Boring! And he was as plain as a dog, and had a permanent limp from when his mother Hera had thrown him out of Olympus. But she'd gone along with it because Zeus asked (as in commanded) her to. That didn't mean a girl couldn't have a little fun on the side. Her husband was often away doing metally stuff for some king or other, so she had plenty of time to fill. And she filled it - and herself - with her brother Ares. Their affair had been going for years, and surely even someone as dumb as her husband should have noticed by now. But apparently no. He'd even presented her with a brand-new four-poster bed, with super-fine transparent curtains, promising her he'd 'help break it in' (ugh!) when he came back from making something metally for King Something-or-other. So naturally, she'd invited Ares over to make sure the bed got 'broken in' sooner rather than later. Except it turned out her husband wasn't as dumb as he looked. After she and her brother had gotten it together, they found those wonderfully fine curtains were in fact god-proof unbreakable chains. They were trapped. But the good news was that Hephaestos came back from his trip and said he'd release them both. The bad news was that, before so doing, he invited every damn god and goddess in Olympus along for a look! And to cap it all, once they were released, Ares fled somewhere and refused to answer her calls, leaving her alone to face the laughing deities. He was so going to pay for that. And since he'd recently been boasting about how one of his favourite acolytes had had a son who would be as great a warrior as his father, Aphrodite knew exactly how to hit him where it hurt! Dinios came from a long line of warriors, all of whom had served Sparta well over the past two centuries. His father had died during the last war with the city's eternal enemy, Athens, and the six-year-old Dinios and his two-year-old brother Samos had gone to live with his father's old war buddy, Rovertos. He'd fully expected to be sent off to camp the following year like all Spartan children, but a chance trip to the sculptor had uncovered a hidden talent for stonework, such that when the city elders saw what the boy could do, they had made the almost unprecedented step of waiving his military service and apprenticing him instead to Viktor, the chief stonemason. By the time he reached eighteen, Dinios was producing work that graced many of the city's main buildings, as well as being in demand from all the top families for their homes. He'd even been able to use his popularity to persuade the city to change his brother's military service from front-line to tactical, Samos having displayed a talent to make the best use of the city's small but ferocious armed forces. His novel idea to actually combine the army and navy in a joint operation had been responsible for seeing off the most recent Athenian attack. It was the day after Dinios' eighteenth birthday, and he was definitely feeling the worse for wear - how in Hades did someone as short as Gabriel put away all that alcohol and still remain upright? - when the woman entered his workshop. This in itself was unusual; women rarely made their own purchases in the city, and those few that came to see him used the small office out the front. This one walked straight into the workshop itself, her sandals scuffling against the dusty floor. She had the air of someone important, and someone who knew she was someone important. \"You are the one they call Dinios?\" Her voice had a strange, almost musical quality to it. A faint warning-bell rang at the back of Dinios' mind. Normally he'd come on to anyone as beautiful as this in under a minute, but some inner instinct warned him to hold off. \"I am, my lady\", he said, wiping the dust off his hands. \"What can I do for you?\" She looked at him thoughtfully. \"I would like to make you an offer.\" \"Go on.\" \"I have acquired a large block of marble, more than enough for a full sized human statue. I want you to make something beautiful.\" He looked at her, waiting for her to elaborate, but it seemed that was it. \"Just 'something beautiful'\", he echoed. \"Yes\", she said, producing a leather bag. \"I know you do not use money as such here, but this bag contains one hundred gold pieces. I will pay you at least fifty, and up to the full hundred if I like the finished product.\" Dinios blanched. Even if he only got the fifty, it was more than five times the going rate for a full-sized statue. And with Sammy dreaming of doing a year or two travelling round the Greek centres of learning, he needed all the money he could get. \"And all you want is 'something beautiful'?\" he said. \"Not a lot to go on.\" She smiled. \"I'm sure someone as talented as your good self can produce something that would make even a god happy. There is no time pressure. You can leave a message at the Temple of Aphordite when you are finished. The stone will be delivered tomorrow.\" \"I haven't said I'll accept yet\", Dinios said, a little annoyed at her presumption. \"Oh, I think you will!\" she laughed. \"The chance to make something totally of your own choice? Just make sure it's human, or mostly human, and I'm sure I'll love whatever you choose to create. Goodbye, Dean.\" She was gone before he had a chance to ask her how she knew the name only his brother ever used. Dinios sighed, and went back to finish off a small statue of Kerberos. Aphrodite made one more call before returning to Olympus. It was lucky that Morpheus, the god of dreams, owed her a favour. He was lying naked on the grass when he heard the distinct cound of wings beating. He wanted to look up, but something made him stay where he was. The - creature, whatever it was, had landed a few feet away from him, and drew slowly nearer, until it came fully into his view. It looked human, except for the two great black wings protruding from its back, which arched over Dinios so completely that they almost blotted out the sun. Yet it wasn't the wings which most drew his attention, but the impossibly blue cerulean eyes that were boring into him, as if they were looking right into his soul. \"Angel\", Dinios whispered, as he turned over and tried to get some sleep. When he came down into his workshop early the next morning, he found the promised stone had already arrived. It was the purest white marble, but with different-coloured blue veins running through it almost like human ones. It was indeed a thing of beauty - and after the dream Dinios had had the night before, he now knew exactly what he was going to make with it. If he could get it to work, the finished product would be beautiful indeed. He set to work, and spent all day on his new project. When he felt himself falling asleep, he realized he hadn't actually eaten, he'd been so obsessed with what he was creating. He draped a blue cloth over the statue, and went off to find some food. That night, the 'angel' appeared in his dreams again. After two weeks, a recognizable shape was beginning to emerge from the rectangular block. It was a human figure, just under six-foot tall (slightly shorter than Dinios and a lot shorter than his brother, both of whom were well above average height). But what made it different was the slender yet strong wings that protruded from its back, poised as if the creature had been just about to spread them before being turned to stone. It was perhaps fortunate that Dinios had such a good reputation, and everyone knew he only ever worked on one major project at a time, so those who requested his services over the next few weeks were prepared to wait. His brother nagged him about forgetting to eat whilst he worked, but always made sure there was food in the workshop for when the sculptor was on the point of collapsing from sheer exhaustion. It wasn't that he was hurrying to finish the statue; he just wanted to make it perfect. The weeks rolled by, and the bare statue was finished. Normally Dinios would have just painted some clothes on it and have done, but although he did paint the wings black, he painted the rest of the skin a natural pale cream, and placed a leather cross-shoulder strap on its chest, holding up a short battle-skirt that (barely) hid the statue's modesty (he'd been quite generous down there). Quite why Dinios was worried about the modesty of a lump of stone, he had no idea, but when he put it on, he blushed almost as much as when he'd sculpted the statue's private parts. It was only a lump of stone, he told himself. But as he looked into those impossibly blue eyes, beneath those long lashes - both painted on by his own hand - he felt this was so much more. He'd created something wonderful, and he didn't want to part with it. He had even come up with a name for the thing - Castiel - from an old legend about a daemon who helped people in love. But the stone belonged to the woman, and there was no way he could afford something as expensive as it must have been. He knew in his heart that he was just playing for time now, and that time was fast running out. But it was Aphrodite's festival at the end of this week, and he felt if he could just delay the inevitable, he might appeal to the goddess, and, well, she might do... something? That hope sustained him up to the day of the festival, when the woman walked back into the shop just after he had opened up. \"Hullo, Dinios!\" she smiled brightly. \"I see you've finished.\" \"I want to buy him off you!\" he blurted out. \"I know I don't have the money just now, but I'll get it. Or I'll do anything else you want. Just... don't take him.\" \"Him?\" she said inquiringly. \"Please!\" She sighed, then much to Dinios' surprise, grinned. \"My brother's going to hate me for doing this, you know!\" \"Your brother?\" Dinios asked, confused. \"Ares.\" She smiled at him, watching as he slowly realized. She knew he'd got there when he fell to his knees. \"Aphrodite!\" \"Sorry, Dinios. I sort of changed your life a bit by giving you some of my husband's skills when you were young, so I could get back at my useless brother. You could have been a great army leader, though you'd have died a few years down the line defending your city. My way was much better, don't you think?\" \"And... Castiel?\" She smirked. \"Why don't you go and ask him?\" He looked confusedly at her, as she pointed him into the back room where he had been working on the statue, then slowly walked through the door and went up to it. It was still covered in its blue cloth, and he gently removed it, before turning to stow it away in a cupboard. There was a sudden gasp from behind him. He turned round so fast that he nearly fell over. The statue was still there - except now the creamy marble was flushing with the colour of real skin, the dark hair was ruffling slightly in the breeze from the open window, and the eyes - those brilliant blue eyes were staring straight at him. \"Dinios?\" he said in a surprisingly deep voice. \"Castiel?\" The former statue spread his wings as far as he could in the cramped room, before folding them gently behind his back. Then he stepped silently across to his creator, and slowly kissed him. His lips were soft and fresh; Dinios could feel the life-force pumping through him as the giant black wings folded around his back to create a cocoon he never wanted to leave. \"You're alive!\" he said, stupidly. \"I love you, Dinios. You created me, and you poured your love into the stone that made me.\" \"I love you too, Cas.\" Castiel pulled his wings back, and to Dinios' shock, they vanished. \"What happened?\" he asked, alarmed. The other man laughed, a deep, throaty laugh that sounded wonderful to the sculptor. \"I can sheathe my wings when needed. Now, I think we both have something very important to do, don't you?\" What was left of Dinios's mind scrambled into action, but failed to supply an answer. \"What?\" he squeaked. \"We have to tell Sam that you're about to be married!\" Dinios pulled him in for another kiss. \"Later!\" he growled. \"Much later!\" They did eventually tell Samos. Though Dinios may have regretted leaving Castiel so much stone in... certain areas. He was sure his legs were even more bowed than before.",

      "It was only a lump of stone, he told himself.",
      "But as he looked into those impossibly blue eyes, beneath those long lashes - both painted on by his own hand - he felt this was so much more.",
      "He'd created something wonderful, and he didn't want to part with it.",
      "He had even come up with a name for the thing - Castiel - from an old legend about a daemon who helped people in love.",
      "But the stone belonged to the woman, and there was no way he could afford something as expensive as it must have been.",
      "He knew in his heart that he was just playing for time now, and that time was fast running out.",
      "But it was Aphrodite's festival at the end of this week, and he felt if he could just delay the inevitable, he might appeal to the goddess, and, well, she might do... something?",
      "That hope sustained him up to the day of the festival, when the woman walked back into the shop just after he had opened up.",
      "\"Hullo, Dinios!\"",
      "she smiled brightly.",
      "\"I see you've finished.\"",
      "\"I want to buy him off you!\"",
      "he blurted out.",
      "\"I know I don't have the money just now, but I'll get it.",
      "Or I'll do anything else you want.",
      "Just... don't take him.\"",
      "\"Him?\" she said inquiringly.",
      "\"Please!\"",
      "She sighed, then much to Dinios' surprise, grinned.",
      "\"My brother's going to hate me for doing this, you know!\"",
      "\"Your brother?\" Dinios asked, confused.",
      "\"Ares.\"",
      "She smiled at him, watching as he slowly realized.",
      "She knew he'd got there when he fell to his knees.",
      "\"Aphrodite!\"",
      "\"Sorry, Dinios.",
      "I sort of changed your life a bit by giving you some of my husband's skills when you were young, so I could get back at my useless brother.",
      "You could have been a great army leader, though you'd have died a few years down the line defending your city.",
      "My way was much better, don't you think?\" \"And... Castiel?\"",
      "She smirked.",
      "\"Why don't you go and ask him?\"",
      "He looked confusedly at her, as she pointed him into the back room where he had been working on the statue, then slowly walked through the door and went up to it.",
      "It was still covered in its blue cloth, and he gently removed it, before turning to stow it away in a cupboard.",
      "There was a sudden gasp from behind him.",
      "He turned round so fast that he nearly fell over.",
      "The statue was still there - except now the creamy marble was flushing with the colour of real skin, the dark hair was ruffling slightly in the breeze from the open window, and the eyes - those brilliant blue eyes were staring straight at him.",
      "\"Dinios?\" he said in a surprisingly deep voice.",
      "\"Castiel?\"",
      "The former statue spread his wings as far as he could in the cramped room, before folding them gently behind his back.",
      "Then he stepped silently across to his creator, and slowly kissed him.",
      "His lips were soft and fresh; Dinios could feel the life-force pumping through him as the giant black wings folded around his back to create a cocoon he never wanted to leave.",
      "\"You're alive!\"",
      "he said, stupidly.",
      "\"I love you, Dinios.",
      "You created me, and you poured your love into the stone that made me.\"",
      "\"I love you too, Cas.\"",
      "Castiel pulled his wings back, and to Dinios' shock, they vanished.",
      "\"What happened?\" he asked, alarmed.",
      "The other man laughed, a deep, throaty laugh that sounded wonderful to the sculptor.",
      "\"I can sheathe my wings when needed.",
      "Now, I think we both have something very important to do, don't you?\"",
      "What was left of Dinios's mind scrambled into action, but failed to supply an answer.",
      "\"What?\" he squeaked.",
      "\"We have to tell Sam that you're about to be married!\"",
      "Dinios pulled him in for another kiss.",
      "\"Later!\"",
      "he growled.",
      "\"Much later!\"",
      "They did eventually tell Samos.",
      "Though Dinios may have regretted leaving Castiel so much stone in... certain areas.",
      "He was sure his legs were even more bowed than before."

    "text": "Despite popular belief, Persephone and Hades have a very happy marriage. They would quite possibly have the best Olympian marriage if it weren't for Psyche and Eros, those adorable idiots. And yeah, Dionysus and Ariadne are cute, but she wasn't always a goddess, so they're disqualified. And Persephone thinks it's safe to say that she and Hades beat Hercules and Hebe, and they definitely beat Aphrodite and Hephaestus. And, like, does she even need to mention Zeus and Hera? No contest. As such, they really don't fight a lot. Playful banter, totally, and quips abound. Sarcasm is basically the official language of the Underworld. But actual fighting? Surprisingly rare. So Persephone's not really sure how this disagreement turned argument turned full-out yelling match right in the middle of the throne room happened, but she's about five seconds away from blaming the fact that she has to go back to Olympus in a couple of days, because shit, this is the time they're supposed to be spending having lots of sex. And she's kind of running out of argumentative tactics. Like, what are they fighting about? All she knows is that she's mad and weirdly turned on and no he did not just say it's inappropriate to adorn the judgement room with flowers, oh fuck no. She's really grasping for insults now. \"Your cape's stupid!\" crosses her mind but it seems both childish and weirdly personal, so she cans it. Maybe something about black marble being tacky... \"Excuse me, my lord?\" Both Persephone and Hades whip their heads in the direction of the voice. It's Thanatos, standing in the entrance of the throne room with a quivering mortal man, holding one of those weird wooden instruments Apollo likes so much. A leroy? Lyon? Whatever. \"Yes?\" Hades grinds out, fists clenched. \"This man has made his way into the Underworld.\" \"That tends to happen, yes.\" \"And he's not dead.\" \"What.\" \"Quite.\" Thanatos gives a slight nod. \"Apparently his wife died and he has come to retrieve her.\" Persephone's ready to sit this guy down and have a Birds and the Bees: Death Edition talk with him, but that is kind of sweet, she has to admit. Why bring your leroy with you, though? Seems burdensome. \"How?\" Hades snaps. \"Apparently, he has the ability to play his instrument so beautifully that the gates to the Underworld opened for him.\" Thanatos, always the debbie downer, seems doubtful. Hades is opening his mouth to say something but Persephone cuts him off. \"How'd she die?\" The man looks extremely nervous, but answers, \"A satyr started chasing her and she got bitten by a snake.\" Persephone nods knowingly. \"That'll happen.\" Hades gives her a look and she sticks her tongue out at him. \"Anyway, you can take your wife.\" Hades splutters beside her. \"No, he may definitively not take his wife.\" \"Oh, really? Sounds fairly hypocritical considering you just took yours,\" she snaps in return, impressed by her own quick thinking. Hades splutters some more. \"One may not simply bring a loved one back from the dead.\" \"Dionysus did, with his mother!\" \"Well.\" Hades shifts uncomfortably. \"He's a god.\" \"Oh, so we're prejudiced now, are we?\" She crosses her arms, tsking disapprovingly. \"Persephone, this is ridiculous, and you know it!\" He throws up his hands, exasperated. \"And now I'm ridic--\" And then the oddest thing happens. The most beautiful noise Persephone has ever heard begins echoing off the walls of the throne room, filling her ears overwhelmingly. She's pretty sure she's swaying on the spot and are her eyes filling with tears? The man stops playing his instrument, and Persephone wipes at her eyes with the back of her hand. The last time she felt this emotional was when Apollo told her about his idea for a story about five kids in detention who are all really different but bond emotionally as the day goes on and realize they're not so different, and then proceeded to tell her that it wouldn't happen for another couple thousand years. \"That was - most untoward,\" Hades says from beside her, voice choked up. \"So untoward,\" Persephone agrees, still wiping tears from her eyes. \"Just--\" Hades gives a general wave of his hand, clearing his throat...masculinely. \"Take your wife and go.\" The man nods once, determined to take the offer before the god of the Underworld comes down from his emotional high, and turns on his heel, following Thanatos out the door. \"Just make sure you don't look behind you when you're ascending!\" Hades calls after them, loudly. A few beats pass, Persephone and Hades standing beside each other uncomfortably. She's feeling a lot fonder towards Hades ever since a minute ago when that mortal played that instrument like he was born to do it, and she knows she's going to be really depressed all summer if she leaves the Underworld still in a fight with her husband. So, she decides to be the bigger person, and break the proverbial ice. \"He's totally gonna look back.\"",

    "text": "He finds the child on his daily walk through the nearest tract of Amazonia. The child is as pale as he is, which means he must not be a native of the jungle, and Ben stares down at him indecisively for a moment. This has been a quiet life, since leaving MacLeod in his dreary Pacific northwest town, and does he want to deal with the drama of finding a white child in the wilds of the Amazon? The child babbles something at him, eyes as green as the jewels Ben wore lifetimes ago, and Ben stoops to gently pick him up. Life was getting boring anyway, and no one within a thousand kilometers questions anything he does. He is either a ghost or a god, and either way, he is left alone.. Ben names the child Adam because it amuses him. Adam grows slowly, far slower than any other child Ben has ever raised, which only confirms what he's suspected since he found the boy. The first time Adam changes his shape, it's into an anaconda, and he doesn't turn back for three days. Ben treats him exactly the same and Adam laughs once he's a boy again. The second time, he becomes a toucan; the third, an ocelot. Ben never reacts except to congratulate him. Adam calms down when he realizes that no matter his shape, he is Ben's son.. Adam is 23 and looks around 10, and he asks Ben, \"You don't age right, either?\" because Ben looks exactly the same as when he found the boy in the jungle. \"I will never age,\" Ben tells him. \"And I don't know how old you'll be when you stop.\". Mentally, Adam is far older than his body. Ben gives him a millennia-old library and the entire internet, and sometimes, can barely stay ahead of the boy. They spend weeks at a time lost in the jungle, stalked by predators few humans have ever seen in person, and Adam builds up his shapes. Adam is 45 and looks barely 18 when he asks, \"What am I?\" Ben isn't entirely honest when he says, \"I don't know,\" and when Adam opens his mouth to demand another answer, Ben adds, \"But you are my son.\" A jaguar screeches to the east, so they continue walking, spending the rest of the day in silence.. When Adam is 50, he asks to travel, so Ben packs everything up and they head northeast. Ben bypasses North America entirely for Europe, where they continue east all the way to the Pacific. They spend a decade wandering, and look like brothers instead of father and son. Adam stops aging around the mortal age of 25; when Ben asks, Adam shrugs and says it's what he decided.. \"How old are you?\" Adam asks when he is 100 and aliens from outer space have plunged Ben's world into warfare. They are back at the Amazon (home, Ben thinks, like the Fertile Crescent once was, like the plains of windy Troy, like the great isle that sank beneath the waves so long ago), watching humanity struggle. Their jungle is protected, and all the mortals who flee there, though not many do. \"Very,\" Ben replies, strengthening his protection spell. Adam's eyes flash that brilliant green as he adds his own power to it.. Thanos, like all would-be conquerors, is defeated. But Ben's world must rebuild or the next would-be conqueror might get lucky. \"What do you think?\" Ben glances at Adam, who has a sloth in his arms and one of the native children at his side. The entire jungle holds its breath, the old magicks waiting for Ben's word, the very floor of the jungle trembling. \"This is our world, is it not?\" Adam asks rhetorically. \"You, the ancient; I, the foundling. This world is our home.\" \"Yes,\" Ben murmurs. Adam adds, \"We protect what is ours.\" He smiles at Ben, handing the sloth to the child. \"You taught me that, Da.\". When he steps out of the jungle, Ben ties the sigil to his own quickening. So long as he has his head, the Amazon will still be safe. Adam is a boa twined around his upper body and Ben quickly transports them to the heart of the rebuilding effort, in the ever-resilient city of New York. The aesir have offered their aid, and Ben remembers well the last time he met one of their kind, in Oslo, during Hardrada's rule. Their leader now is tall, blond, and blue-eyed, and he carries a hammer Ben knows well. Captain America, still as youthful as ever, and the Hulk represent humanity, and SHIELD, though weakened, commands what forces are left to Earth. Ben appears in the midst of a quarrel, Adam looped around his shoulders, and waits to be noticed. He is not impressed when it takes an hour.. When Thor Odinson, Captain America, and Smith, current director of SHIELD, ask for his name, he says, \"Lifthrasir Nanashi.\" Thor booms, \"Well met!\" Lifthrasir smiles at him and knows that Odin Borrson would've questioned him further, especially with that name - but, then, Odin knows prophecy and once met a sailor who blinded the son of the sea. But Thor's attention is elsewhere, and Lifthrasir is too useful to turn away, and when Adam shifts back, his eyes flash as he hisses, \"Thor,\" low and cold and vicious. He turns quickly to face Lifthrasir and shifts into his female shape, and tells Lifthrasir, \"My name is Pan.\" Lifthrasir nods. \"C'mon,\" he says. \"Our assignment is this way.\" Pan follows with a single glance thrown over her shoulder at Thor and avoids the godling for the rest of their time in New York.. MacLeod is helping to rebuild the Pacific coast. Most of the immortals in the western hemisphere have flocked to his banner, because what is the point of winning the prize in a ghost world? Lifthrasir leaves him to it, traveling with Pan to Rome, at the behest of SHIELD.. Pan is 120 and looks barely 25, dark hair piled on her head and skin tanned by the sun, eyes poison-bright, when Thor stares at her for almost an hour before stuttering out, \"Lo-Loki?\" Lifthrasir stands beside her, everything in him waiting for her play, and Pan straightens to her full height (still a head and a half shorter than Odin's son), and she says, \"Loki died when he fell from a bridge.\" \"Please,\" Thor says, \"Loki, I do not understand - we have thought you dead for -\" Pan interrupts, voice strong, to say, \"Loki, child of no one, is dead, son of Odin.\" She smiles, suddenly, brilliantly, adding, \"I am Pan, I am Adam, and I am the child of legend.\" Lifthrasir laughs, loud and long, and pulls Pan close for a hug. \"You are, as ever, delightful,\" he murmurs into her hair. When he catches Thor's bewildered expression, he laughs again.. \"You remember now?\" Lifthrasir asks while Odin strides toward them, his retinue falling further and further behind. \"I remembered when Thor set foot on this world again,\" Pan answers. \"What do you want, child?\" Lifthrasir glances down at her; she is still so young, still that boy he found in the wilderness. \"You are the ancient,\" Pan says, \"and I am the foundling. And this world is ours.\" \"Exactly so,\" Lifthrasir murmurs, stepping forward to meet the All-Father, his child beside him.",

    "text": "Poseidon leaned heavily on his trident as he let Zeus's words wash over him, choosing instead to concentrate on the horrendous mess the mortals had made of things, far below, but not far enough that he couldn't hear the screaming and the frantic prayers, which Zeus had now decided would not be answered. By what authority, he wanted to ask. Had Zeus forgotten that they were brothers? So Poseidon had chosen the guise of a young man, rather than his usual appearance as a venerable old man - that didn't make him any less powerful, any less what he was. So he had a favourite among the mortals - Zeus had Theseus, and he had this confused young mortal who had chosen the wrong path. Maybe he could nudge Lysander back towards the right one (yes, towards your bed, Zeus would say spitefully). This Theseus and Hyperion business was Zeus's problem, he decided. He, Poseidon, had been too long away from his real home - the sea. Its people were his business, and if he led one troubled soldier away from certain death on a whim, well, he was a god. He asked for no-one's permission. The sound of the waves hitting the shore and the smell of the sea woke Lysander from a fitful half-sleep, and he held his breath, cursing himself for having let down his guard, even for a few minutes. But no-one was in the small tent with him. No-one had taken advantage of his inattention, and slowly, his heart-rate returned to normal, and his fists unclenched. Now he was annoyed that something had disturbed the only rest he was likely to have for a while, and he wondered what it had been. Not the sea, of course. King Hyperion's camp was too far inland for that. He must have been dreaming. It had seemed so real, though. He could almost taste the salt spray on his lips, feel the cool water on his face... no matter. He must have been woken by some noise in the camp. One of the many noises - a scream, the sounds of sobbing, pleading for mercy. It was always so loud in the camp. Lysander scoffed at himself for that thought, as he turned the mask over and over in his hands. All are equal in Hyperion's army, he thought, and his mental voice sounded derisive. Yes, his previous camp had been loud too. He let himself wallow in the nostalgia for a few seconds, yearning after the groups of men drinking and exchanging tall tales of conquest, the camp followers washing their clothes and singing, and even some children, always getting underfoot. A far cry from the noise here - barked orders, screams of agony from the bulls (always the fucking bulls, bull-head masks, metal bulls with fire underneath and the wailing always coming from the nostrils, along with the steam and the... smell) sobbing and wailing from anyone unfortunate enough to be left alive by the monstrous King. Yes, monstrous. He'd finally said it, even if it was in the privacy of his own head. In the other camp, he didn't have to hide away in a corner in case some of the other warriors (the ones who still had balls, he added resentfully) would use the weaklings for sport. That's what he was, now, a weakling, a eunuch. Lysander's resentment boiled over. He was in constant pain from his crushed testicles, and a more recent addition was a persistent ache in his lower back from... other things that had been done to him the one time he was naive enough to let his guard down. Lysander poked at the eye holes of the mask. Why had he come here? He was finding it hard to remember anything of his life before. What had led him to this place, this state? What had been so bad about his life that he'd thrown it away, and for this? In trying to retrace his steps he always got stuck at the mallet. Hyperion had taken one look at him, had judged him as useless, and had laughed when that creature had carved up his face. And the hammer. That had been his reward. For treason, for murder. It was what he deserved. What had he thought, that they were going to put him out of his misery? Hadn't he been prepared to snivel and beg for his life? He remembered now. He'd been afraid to die! That was it. The thought struck him as hilarious, now. If he'd died then, fighting this army of horrors, he'd probably have been worthy of the Elysian Fields. Now, the state he was in, not even Hades would want him. He was so tired. He felt filthy, like the dirt was ingrained under his skin, and caked in it, at the same time. He couldn't even sleep here. Hidden as he was he could hear sobs and protestations from the men and boys being dragged out and shared amongst the creatures, which was what Hyperion called the worst of his warriors, the ones who wore the bull-head mask. No-one dared touch the women who'd been captured - those belonged to Hyperion alone. Not the pregnant ones, those had been tortured and slaughtered by the King, personally. And the children... Lysander shuddered. He didn't want to think about the children. As Lysander sat, lost in his thoughts, the night passed, and soon the army started mustering towards the wall, towards the last defence. He got up and joined them, for where could he go, marked as he was? Still, as they started their march towards the gate, he found himself walking slower and slower, until the whole army had almost passed him by. He was possessed by an almost irresistible desire to turn back, to walk away. He'd never wanted this. He'd just been so afraid of death that he hadn't considered that some things might be worse. He could go and throw himself on Theseus's sword, of course. That would have been the honourable thing to do. But when had he ever been honourable? And he felt so dirty. How could he die like this, less than a man, covered with the filth of Hyperion's very presence? As he stumbled along, dragging his feet, he became conscious of eyes on him. Not the common foot-soldiers like himself, their very masks prevented peripheral vision. And maybe that had been one of the reasons they all wore them, he thought bitterly. No looking around for those in Hyperion's army, always stare straight ahead, focussed on whatever Hyperion wanted. He couldn't even look to the side to see who had seen his reluctance, but he could guess - one of the Minotaurs, who were tasked with maintaining discipline as well as torture, rape and slaughter. As if in a dream, he felt the swing of the hammer as it whistled towards his head and managed to turn a stumble into a headlong fall, and lay on the ground as the rest of the army passed by. People stepped onto his hands and his legs, but he didn't move. He was sure that the Minotaur even kicked him a few times, but his performance must have been convincing, as eventually he was left alone. Without moving his head, he could see though one of the eyeholes as he lay on the ground. Hundreds of feet disappeared into a huge dust cloud which seemed to have swallowed the world. When he heard the explosion signalling Hyperion's use of the weapon of the gods, Lysander got up, and, after one last look towards the army, which by now was charging towards the wall, started a slow but steady plod in the other direction. He did not look back again, even when he heard a distant rumble and the ground started shaking so strongly he nearly lost his footing. Through some magic or optical illusion as he had heard was common in the desert, it seemed to him he could see the sea in the distance. He would reach it. And at least, maybe he would be clean when he died. Lysander walked for days. How many exactly, he was never sure afterwards. Sometimes he slept during the night, at others, he slept during the day, so he quickly lost track of time. He used the cloth of his mask to gather up dew, and sucked off the scant moisture it offered. The sweat ran down his face and stung his barely healed wounds during the day, while his whole body shivered so hard during the cold desert nights that his legs started cramping, yet he never stopped his slow steady pace. Often he had terrible dreams, that the Minotaurs had found him, that Hyperion stood at his head as he woke. But they were just dreams. Each day, or night, he woke and he was alone, something he was thankful for. He never came across any houses or villages or farms, something which he was also glad for, though at times he felt as though he was the only man left alive in the world. He was always hungry, and occasionally he found insects and grubs to eat which looked terrible and tasted worse, but which at least gave him the strength to keep walking. One day, just as the niggling thought came to him that his increasingly weak body could not take much more of this, he realised that he'd been hearing a strange sound for a while now. No, it wasn't a strange sound. It was one he'd known, but had forgotten, the sound of waves hitting the shore and retreating. The air smelled different, of freshness and salt, rather than pure condensed heat. He tried to look up, but his eyes had long ago swelled up in reaction to the punishing desert sun and the dust raised by his sandals as he plodded along, so he saw nothing until he stumbled down a rocky incline and splashed into a shallow inlet. As dehydrated as he was, he managed to squeeze out a few tears of joy, which cleared his eyes even as they stung unbearably on his scarred face. He was in a little cove, not enough sand to be called a beach, but pebbles and rocks, and a floor which seemed to slope off gradually, but which he knew would drop off in a few metres. He laughed in joy and threw away the horrid rag, all which remained of the mask which Hyperion had put over his face after turning him into a monster. Lysander splashed the cold sea water over his limbs, and waded in deeper. It was his imagination, he knew, but he could feel it scouring off the dirt and the horrors, all the things he'd done and all the things that had been done to him. As the cool, sparkling waters closed over his head, he laughed again, swallowing gratefully. He could die now. He was clean again. Lysander had never expected to wake up again, alive. But alive he was, and when he opened his eyes he saw that he was on some rocks. He started retching helplessly, as all the sea water he'd swallowed came out of him. Then he sensed rather than saw that he wasn't alone. He just had time to look up and see that three old fishermen had surrounded him, when something hard hit his head, and blackness washed over him once more. (See the end of the chapter for notes.) When Lysander woke up a second time, he could tell he was indoors without opening his eyes. He knew he must be in some primitive shack - he could feel a hard stone floor under him. He lay on his side, and fought the urge to look around him. Where was he, and why had he been brought to this place? The small house was full of people - he could hear the voices of old men arguing, and occasionally he heard a female voice. Strange to hear a woman involved in such things. It slowly dawned on Lysander that they were arguing about him. \"He's a cursed soldier from Hyperion's army, look at his face! It is said Hyperion's bulls scar men this way and then give them masks to wear - we have to kill him, or he'll lead the rest of the army here, and this time no-one will survive the slaughter!\" This sounded like an elderly man who'd seen too much sorrow. Lysander couldn't help but agree with him - and he'd wanted to die. He still did. Didn't he? But another voice interrupted his thoughts - a woman, this time. \"He's a young man, strong despite his current state, and we need him. You won't allow the younger women to fish and you can't do this on your own anymore.\" \"I have heard that Hyperion's army was defeated-\" a different voice, yet another old man. \"Our young men will return and take up their nets-\" But he wasn't allowed to finish. \"No.\" Another man, this time. Lysander thought he sounded older, too, but he couldn't be sure. How had they all escaped Hyperion's army? His cheeks burned as he remembered his own village, where no-one had been left after he'd led the tyrant's men there. \"Those who weren't killed outright by the monstrous King died in his battle. I hear that the gods themselves joined the lists and struck him down, as well as any who fought by his side. At least,\" and here Lysander imagined the man shrugged, for his next words were more rueful and down to earth, \"that's what Kephalos, the pot seller, told me yesterday.\" The discussion dissolved into a hubbub of yelled arguments between those who thought Kephalos the pot seller was an old windbag pickled in wine, and those who scoffed at the thought of the gods taking a direct interest in the suffering of mortals. No-one scoffed at the gods, though, Lysander noticed. There was a lot of reverence here, and not a little fear too. Lysander guessed that, living on the bounty of the sea as they did, they couldn't afford to alienate any gods who might be listening. Lysander himself didn't know what he felt about the gods - he'd always joined in the rituals, and made sacrifices without really thinking about it. He remembered being very young and hearing stories about the gods disguising themselves as mortals to walk among them, but he was fairly sure he'd never seen a god. Sure, he'd heard the mountain come down behind him, but he'd never actually seen how it happened. Who's to say it wasn't a conveniently timed... event. Of some kind. A comet, maybe. They'd said Theseus had been directly helped by the gods, though. This rumour had circulated at camp despite the amount of people Hyperion had killed to try and quash it. A high-pitched voice interrupted his thoughts. A woman, then. Young, by the sound of it. Things must be dire in this village if they allowed young women into their councils. \"We can't let him stay here, he will ravage us... I've heard stories...\" She sounded terrified. The older woman answered, reassuringly. \"My dear, he is incapable. The barbaric King Hyperion made sure that very few men besides himself would father children on the women of Greece.\" Lysander shuddered. He was still wearing his ragged old chiton, [1] but they must have... what? Examined him? He sensed that the men in the room were shuffling around uncomfortably at such talk, and wished he could too. \"He will stay with me.\" This was a new voice, another old man, of which the village seemed to have an inexhaustible supply. \"I will teach him to fish and we will not starve, or have to eat all our goats to survive.\" \"He will refuse - why else would he have joined that damned army if not to escape honest labour?\" \"Why not ask him? He's been awake for a while now.\" Lysander flushed, sensing that everyone in the room was staring at him now. He opened his eyes, cringing slightly at the attention. Now that he could look around him, he saw that he was in a small room which seemed to be bursting with people. He recognized the three old fishermen who had found him on the beach where he woke up - they looked very much like one would expect elderly fishermen to look: white, thinning hair, faces nut-brown, eyes surrounded by a mass of wrinkles from squinting into the sun all day. The older woman he had heard speak drew herself up, regally, and nodded to him. Her long brown hair was shot with streaks of grey and pulled back into a knot, while her chiton and himation,2 worn and faded, were nevertheless clean. He didn't know why he was staring at her, except maybe she reminded him of his mother. He deliberately didn't try to look at the younger woman he'd heard speak - the last thing he needed was for these men, who seemed to hate him on principle, to think he had any designs on their younger women. This can't have been a poor village, before Hyperion came, he thought. Now, well. Some of them considered his arrival to be a sign of hope. Things must truly be desperate, then. Lysander tried to get up, only for one of the old men to plant his staff in his chest, forcing him back down. \"How can we trust him? How do we know he's not just scouting for his master?\" The last word was said with a sneer. Lysander opened his mouth to speak but all that came out was a croak - he dimly recalled retching what seemed like half the ocean and his throat was on fire. The older woman walked over to him, and held a cup to his mouth. Just water. They wouldn't be wasting any wine on him. \"Slowly, now, or you'll be sick again.\" The old man was impatient. \"Well? Why did you come here? Speak, eunuch!\" Lysander flushed again, this time in anger, though he held on to it, with difficulty. He could hardly deny it. He was a eunuch. That was what he was, now. \"I walked away from the final battle.\" Lysander spoke carefully and with some difficulty - his voice sounded hoarse and unfamiliar to his own ears. He ignored the various mutterings of coward, and see? I told you-. \"I never intended to come here. I wanted to find the sea. I-\" Lysander trailed off, not wanting to admit he'd actually thought of suicide. Not that they would have disapproved - might have even given him a hand. \"Maybe he wanted to make sacrifice to the god,\" the young woman said timidly, before blushing at the sudden attention, and drawing her veil across her face. Lysander didn't need to ask which god she meant. This was a fishing village, after all. \"And the god rejected him, threw him back! It's a sign!\" This was the old man with the staff, who was using it now to prod Lysander and slap him a few times on the thigh. The man who'd said Lysander could stay with him shook his head. \"No, it's a gift. The god hears our prayers and gives us someone to help us in our work.\" Lysander could see various people drawing deep breaths to speak, probably to protest that a half-starved eunuch wasn't much of a gift, and then stopping abruptly, no doubt realising the danger of loudly questioning the god's answer to their prayers. \"My name is Hipparchus,\" the old man said, helping Lysander up. \"What is yours?\" Lysander opened his mouth, and closed it again. He was seized with a sudden hatred for himself, combined with pity for a village so poor that it saw his arrival as a blessing from the gods. \"Aischrion,\" he answered. Hipparchus looked puzzled, while the other old man, the one with the staff, barked out a laugh. \"The name suits,\" he said, and seemed to want to add more, but the older woman stopped him with a look. She looked at Lysander with pity in her eyes, and for a moment he hated her for that. \"I hardly think your mother gave you the name 'Ugly', not with that lovely golden hair,\" she said, gently. Lysander shrugged, not trusting himself to answer. The meeting was breaking up, but the curmudgeonly old man still found time to mutter, on his way out, that the golden hair was probably the reason Poseidon spared Lysander's life, and now they were stuck with a eunuch just because the god wanted some mortal eromenos to warm his bed. The young woman covered her mouth in delighted horror, and the other men just shook their heads. Evidently they were used to such salty talk. \"Come,\" said Hipparchus. \"You need a bath, and a change of clothing.\" He sniffed, meaningfully, and Lysander cringed. He couldn't smell himself anymore, which was probably just as well. He wondered if taking a bath here meant dunking himself in the stream he could hear in the distance, but, following Hipparchus out of the small house they'd been in, he realised they were going to the centre of the village. He looked around, curiously. It was late afternoon, light enough to see a rather small village, with a handful of small houses set back from a rocky coastline. He could just see a small inlet with a few fishing boats moored. In one of the natural depressions he found what he'd been looking for: a statue of Poseidon with his trident, made of marble, he was surprised to see. But then, it wasn't a huge statue - it was bigger than a tall man, but not much bigger. The houses too were economically built - made of stone or brick, not big, but sufficient, and all of them neatly made and clean. No, this hadn't been a rich town before Hyperion came, but it must have been happy. Now, all the young men were gone, he could see. There were some children playing - in a village this small they wouldn't have been cooped up in the women's quarters, if they even had such a thing here. Lysander was glad a few children had escaped Hyperion's hands. While he was lost in his thoughts, they had arrived at the village's small bath-house - he managed to stop himself from being surprised that a village so small even had such a thing. Still, he almost embarrassed himself when he saw Hipparchus light the fire under the stones. It was on the tip of his tongue to ask where the slave was, but he bit back his words. Was that all it took, a few hours among civilised people, and he forgot where he'd spent the last weeks, living in his own filth among murderers and torturers, having become one of them? Hipparchus had got the fire going and grabbed a ladle for the olive oil - he gestured towards Lysander with it. \"Do you want me to-\" \"No! I mean, thank you, I'll do myself.\" Lysander was about to pull the chiton over his head before the usual oiling that went before a steam bath, but then he hesitated. Though why was he hesitating? Hipparchus already knew everything about him, and so he pulled the tunic off with a sudden burst of defiance, only to see that the old man had already turned his back. Lysander wasn't sure if Hipparchus was trying to spare his feelings or not. Either way, he was grateful. And angry, and hurt, and humiliated, which is why the next words which burst out of him were: \"I betrayed my village, you know. I killed my fellow soldiers and led Hyperion's army there.\" Hipparchus looked up, mildly. The rocks had heated up and he had started pouring water over them, after which he threw sage and rosemary on the brazier, and soon they were enveloped in clouds of sweet-smelling steam, the scent of which brought a sudden rush of nostalgia to Lysander. Through the steam he couldn't tell what Hipparchus was thinking, but his next words were mild in tone, though the story they told was horrific. \"My son did the same. Or tried to.\" Hipparchus's face tightened in pained recollection. \"We argued that day. He was angry at everything, at me, at the gods, at life, even. He said he would join that monster's army, to become his soldier, and we'd all see.\" He smiled, sadly. \"I never saw him again. Hypatia, the older woman you met today, had heard stories of what Hyperion's army was doing to the people they encountered, and she managed to convince many of us to hide in the sea caves on the coast. All the old people, many of the young women and children, none of the young men. When we returned, we saw...\" The old man closed his eyes, rubbing them. Lysander could imagine what they had seen, but he let Hipparchus continue. \"So many bodies - pregnant women, slaughtered like cattle. Young men, butchered in the street. Though not all of them - the women who were not with child were taken, as well as the some of the men. My son,\" he paused there, \"my son did not die that day. He joined Hyperion's army, so he must have been rewarded for his betrayal... or not.\" Hipparchus looked at Lysander with sudden comprehension. \"Was this your reward? Your face, and... your manhood?\" Hipparchus gestured towards Lysander's groin and Lysander wanted to cover himself. \"Did my son get the same treatment?\" \"I don't know. Hyperion was insane, I...\" he wanted to reassure the old man, but didn't know how. Knowing Hyperion, he'd done the same thing to Hipparchus's son, but how could he speak of such horrors to the only person who'd shown him any sympathy? \"No matter.\" Hipparchus shook his head and gestured at Lysander to stop him from speaking. \"It is done. My son is dead, but the village need not die too. We managed to save all the children, and some young women, so maybe young men will come here, in time.\" He lay back, soaking in the steam, and Lysander could see that he wasn't as old as he had thought, just prematurely aged through a hard life. \"Will you stay here, and work with us?\" Lysander wanted to say he hadn't known he had a choice, but that would sound churlish. They were going to clothe him and feed him - apparently death wasn't an option if even the sea threw him back, and what else was there for him? He nodded, and Hipparchus must have seen it through the steam, as he clapped him on the shoulder, and urged him up, handing him a strigil.3 \"Come, we'd best get going - you need to eat, and sleep. Tomorrow, you learn how to fish. Though, of course, I need to know the name of the man who will be living in my house.\" Lysander flushed and looked down, pretending to pay special attention to scraping the back of his leg. He muttered, \"Lysander,\" not willing to continue with the self-hatred that had driven him earlier. \"Good name. Come, come...\" Hipparchus rushed him into his filthy chiton, assuring him he'd have clean clothes soon, and chivvied him out of the bath-house - not a moment too soon, because a few of the men from the earlier meeting were casually dropping by, pretending not to be curious about him. Hipparchus's house was average-sized, with two small areas, one obviously for eating and the other with two low pallets for sleeping - Lysander wondered if he'd left his son's bed ready for him, in case he came back. There was food ready - bread, goats' cheese, olives and wine, which Hipparchus diluted carefully. Lysander ate only a little, and in small bites - he knew what would happen if he wolfed everything down. \"Now, take that filthy thing off, perhaps the women can get it clean again-\" \"Burn it- if you have something else for me to wear,\" Lysander spat out, dragging the hated thing over his head and shoulders and balling it up in his hands. Hipparchus nodded at him, seeming to understand the sudden rage which drove Lysander, who flushed again, embarrassed at his spontaneous words. These weren't exactly rich people. But Hipparchus simply opened a chest in the corner and drew out a chiton, which, while not new, was at least clean. \"This belonged to my son. It was his second-best...\" Hipparchus was looking at it as he spoke, and drawing his fingers through the folds. He looked up at Lysander, seeming to recollect where he was, and showed it to him. \"You can wear it in the morning. But now, I think you should get some sleep.\" Lysander's eyes were already drooping closed. He managed to hold one thought in his head, how strange it was that he was in comparatively good shape after his trek through the desert and his near drowning, but even that disappeared as he let himself fall asleep. 1chiton: a tunic made up of a rectangle of woolen or linen fabric, fastened at the shoulders by pins, sewing, or buttons. A man's chiton was usually knee-length, while a woman's usually reached the ankles. 2himation: a cloak. 3strigil: a small, curved, metal tool used in ancient Greece to scrape dirt and sweat from the body. First perfumed oil was applied to the skin, and then it would be scraped off, along with the dirt. Lysander dreams of flying through the water, of ringing in his ears, of a comely young man with a sharp grin, dark hair and flashing eyes, guiding him towards the surface. The salt stings his eyes but he looks around in awe as shoals of fish support his weakened limbs, as a dolphin nips at his tattered chiton and pulls him up. More ominous shapes move past him silently, with inexorable purpose, and the last thing he sees before his eyes close is the flat black of a shark's eye as it too, it seems, is tasked with dragging him away from his self-administered punishment. He will remember nothing of this dream except the sensation of burning in his lungs, and the pain of drowning. Even though he managed to get up early enough to watch the village men go fishing, Lysander was still in no physical shape to get on a boat. So one of the old men stayed behind to show him the rudiments of knotting a net, and repairing the cone-shaped cages which the fishermen used as traps underwater. He became so engrossed in his work that the hours passed quickly until the men came back with the best catch they'd had in months. Lysander ignored the sideways glances he got as the men trooped back to the houses, and the women squabbled over the catch. As only one or two still had living husbands, dividing it up was not the straightforward matter it had been in the past, and Hypatia frequently had to intervene between them. Hipparchus came with his share, a large, rather fierce-looking lobster. Lysander left it up to him to subdue and prepare for the pot. \"You don't sell your fish?\" Lysander had spent so many years in the army, he was no longer sure of things worked in small villages, but he was fairly certain he'd heard of fish markets and suchlike. Hipparchus shrugged. \"We have had so much loss here, that our catch has not been worth selling. We are salting and preserving fish for the winter, when it becomes more difficult to make a good catch. A couple of catches like today's, and perhaps we will not starve this year. We have some fields on the hills, but very little grows so close to the sea.\" Lysander noticed that Hipparchus looked at him out of the corner of his eye when he mentioned that day's exceptional catch, but he refused to catch his eye. What did he, Lysander, know about gods and their whims? He had worshipped back at his home, more to fit in than anything else. And soldiers had their own rituals of appeasement, which he'd joined. Still, he'd never had a sign of otherworldly involvement in his affairs, and he doubted he ever would. What he'd seen in those weeks with Hyperion had disabused him of the notion of any benevolent deity watching over humans. He'd had no doubt all those slaughtered women had prayed to Artemis, to Athena, and for what? But he wasn't prepared to put his thoughts in words. And yet he knew, despite himself, that something strange was going on. He found himself unable to forget that last morning, in Hyperion's camp, being woken by the impossible - the smell and sound of the sea. He should have drowned, but here he was. And now, his arrival had heralded this bounty. Was he being courted? Or was this another cruel joke being played on him? Would he be greeted with snide laughter, and more torture, before finally being allowed to die? He realised that he was frozen in place, holding a pot which he had been asked to fill with water at the stream, and flushed. He glared at Hipparchus, and at the lobster, and stomped off. He wasn't going to consider this anymore. Damn gods and their games. It wasn't worth wasting any more thought on. The next morning Lysander went on a fishing boat for the very first time. And after that, it seemed that five years passed in the blink of an eye. After, he tried hard to remember whether one particular day stood out more than the others, but it never did. He learned how to fish, and spent his days, spring and summer more than winter, on the fishing boat with Hipparchus, using the nets or the cages, and soon it became second nature for him (as killing used to be, the treacherous part of his brain informed him, the part that hadn't forgotten his actions or forgiven them). After that first day, any boat Lysander was on got the best catch, mountains of glittering sea bream and bass, lobsters and crayfish almost fighting for the privilege of entering his cages. Once a swordfish had beached itself on the deck of his boat, and the village had even managed to do some barter for once, with enough corn and oil to last for months. No-one had made any more snide remarks about Poseidon and his predilections after that, but the sacrifices to the god were made with more conviction than ever. Soon he was almost indistinguishable from the other fishermen in the village - the few things which set him apart were his scars, and the fact that he was the only youthful man who never took off his chiton. A few months after his arrival the young women started showing rounded bellies, and the story circulated that they had already been pregnant when their men had been taken or killed, just not showing yet. Lysander had turned a sceptical eye on Hipparchus, who just pointed out that without babies, the village would die out. So what if the babies were born late? They would have their fathers' names. Lysander noticed that the old men walked straighter and talked louder, but he shrugged. Why shouldn't they be proud that they were keeping their village alive? Where were those who made the rules about legitimacy and so on, where were they now. He immediately, with some discomfort, flashed back to himself at ten, insulting Theseus for being a bastard. He couldn't take it back, but at least he could make up for it by turning a blind eye, when any other man would not have. Besides, what right did he have to judge? He was only alive through their goodwill, and he wasn't going to do any repopulating any time soon. Lysander wondered when he'd stopped looking at the hills which led down to the village, waiting for soldiers coming to make him pay for his betrayal. It never happened, which made him think it never would. In fact, the attack came from the sea. If he'd kept count, Lysander would have realised that day was five years to the day he'd arrived in the small fishing village. But he didn't and when the huge wave swept him off the boat he'd been loading nets and baskets onto, it came as much of a shock to him as it was to the people watching. Time slowed down to a crawl. He realised he could understand what one of the men was shouting as he toppled into the sea. \"It's a hand! Look, a great hand, made of water! Look, do you see?\" Then all he heard was a ringing in his ears, and he knew no more. For the second time in his life, Lysander woke up expecting to be dead. And for the second time in his life, he was alive. But this time, he wasn't on a sunny beach. He was in some sort of cave, which seemed to be underwater. Half of it was covered in water, like a shallow lagoon, but it was not sand which covered the bottom... he could hardly believe his eyes, and had to touch the smooth surface before he accepted that the floor was covered in mother-of pearl. The ceiling was even stranger - it glowed, but not like phosphorescent algae or moss, but like a warm fire. Squinting at it, he realised it was amber - a king's ransom of amber, and it covered the cave. The water was warm, and everything was smooth and beautiful, and it didn't smell damp or stifling, but salty. He looked around him and realised that there was a man sitting in the corner, watching him closely. At first he thought it was an old man, sitting on a chair, holding his staff. \"Who are you?\" Lysander's voice was low and hoarse, and his throat burned terribly from the salt water he'd swallowed. The man got up suddenly, and he no longer seemed old but was young and beautiful (and very naked, his mind-voice gulped), and his staff slammed down into the rock which flowed and hardened around it, and it was no longer a staff, but a trident. \"Take a wild guess,\" Poseidon replied, for of course it was the god himself. Lysander closed his eyes tightly and opened them, certain he was dreaming. Nothing had changed. He was still in this strange but beautiful cave, being watched by the god of the sea in his guise of a handsome young man, pale, with short dark hair and flashing bright eyes. The god smiled at him; a half-smile, and Lysander wondered whether this was it, this was when his punishment would come. The thoughts thronged in his head - what form would it take, and why had the god waited so long, and why had he prepared Lysander for divine retribution by... showering him with riches... and waiting for him to, at least partly, recover from his experiences. That didn't quite add up. When he looked up again, Poseidon was shaking his head and smiling, more openly this time. \"I don't want to punish you, Lysander. Not unless that gives you pleasure,\" he continued, and his smile grew a little more wicked than before. Poseidon knelt down next to him, grasped his shoulders, and before he knew it Lysander was being kissed by a god. He opened his mouth, reflexively, and Poseidon's tongue delved in his mouth, opening him up, and the pleasure was almost blinding. Lysander responded, losing himself in the kiss and the various caresses Poseidon gave him. As Poseidon's fingers passed over his ruined groin and his scarred face, Lysander tried to shy back, ashamed of his deformities. \"Shh,\" Poseidon whispered, gentling him. He grinned, looking sly. \"Look what I can do!\" He caressed Lysander all over, using sea water and sand to rub him gently, and wherever his fingers rested, Lysander could feel himself being healed. Finally Poseidon stroked his face, leaving cool fire in his fingers' wake, so that Lysander knew that the horrible scars were gone. He could feel his cock stirring, something he hadn't felt in over five years, and blushed at the thought of being so exposed to the god. Poseidon just laughed, and kissed him again, pulling him out of the shallow water towards a bed Lysander hadn't seen before. The sheets were warm, soft and smooth, and rubbed tantalizingly against his newly healed skin as Poseidon drove deep into his mouth with his tongue, and used his fingers to open up his ass. He flinched at this - he couldn't help it. Memories rushed back, of the monstrous men rutting in him as he screamed and begged, all those years ago. Poseidon's eyes filled with sadness, and he kissed Lysander's eyes, and mouth, and stopped his caresses. Lysander rushed to apologize - he hadn't meant to offend, it was just- \"I understand - I can see it, all of it, and it was dreadful. Will you allow me to heal you there, too?\" Lysander was afraid, but he nodded, and when Poseidon breached him, it was nothing but pleasure. Poseidon fucked him for hours, it seemed, bringing him to orgasm over and over as he lay there, helplessly stretched around the god's cock, until Poseidon spent in him, and stayed in him, his cock filling and stretching Lysander until he thought he would die of pleasure. He'd never thought he'd be able to bear a man's touch again, but he did more than bear it. He yelled in ecstasy at every stroke, at every thrust, he rode and was ridden, he pleasured the god with his ass, his hands and his mouth, for hours, or days, Lysander never really could tell. Poseidon realized Lysander needed food and drink, and so they paused, and the god would feed Lysander things sweet and savoury, wine and water, but could never keep his hands off Lysander for long before he flipped him over and entered him, a bit rougher now. Lysander had lost his fear though. He was drowning in pleasure, and the thought suddenly came to him that he would not be sad if he died like this. \"Oh, no. You're not getting away from me that fast.\" Poseidon spoke between thrusts, his balls slapping against Lysander's ass, and he quickly reached around to grab Lysander's cock, hard as it always was in that cave. Lysander laughed, between gasps, and moans, and came again. And again. (See the end of the chapter for notes.) \"I don't understand - why me? Why spare my life, when so many died?\" Lysander wants to stop himself from being so sharp with the powerful immortal who could crush him like an ant. He's not so sure that this dream accurately conveys what really happened in the cave. Perhaps it conveys what he was thinking, even as he lost himself in the bliss of the god's embrace, or the thoughts which would come to him afterwards, as he asked himself the same question. Nevertheless, in the dream Poseidon says nothing, just smiles enigmatically, and continues caressing Lysander, who gasps at every touch, knowing that this feeling, at least, mirrored reality. Lysander hears a sound behind him. Was that a... hiss? He turns, only to see three women bearing down on him, limbs entwined with snakes, and as the first woman's whip strikes him across the face, he wakes up. Lysander woke up with a gasp. He touched his face, gingerly, but there was no lash-mark. It had been a dream, one which he still occasionally had, even though some years had passed since Lysander met the great god Poseidon in an underwater cave. He had been awoken by Hipparchus tapping his shoulder, and as he looked out of the doorway he saw that it was a couple of hours before sunrise. Hipparchus was preparing some barley bread and a skin of diluted wine to take on the boat, and Lysander got up, glad that the dream had been interrupted before the goddesses took him apart. In his waking hours Lysander remembered the specifics of his hours, or even days in the cave, but in dreams his fears took over and added nightmarish elements - the presence of the Erinyes being just one of several. Being awake always dissipated his fears, and he remembered instead the wonderful reality, in which he, Lysander, traitor and murderer, was loved and revered by a god. He remembered the passion with which Poseidon kissed him, the heights of ecstasy brought about by his touch, and the heat of their love-making, the memories of which still excited him. At some point they had also talked. Lysander had mentioned that he'd been afraid of Poseidon's divine punishment, at which the god laughed, and proceeded to kiss him until his ears rang. Poseidon had tried to reassure him that no immortal beings were hunting him, even when Lysander revealed the chilling fear which had preoccupied him for a while, which he hadn't even wanted to admit to himself. \"In my old village, we often spoke of... the Kindly Ones...\" Lysander's voice had cracked at that point - he knew that he had done things which ensured their attention many times over. Their curse would follow him for the rest of his life, and nothing he did or said would appease them. Poseidon had shushed him, stroking his hair like he was a child, and he remembered wanting to hide in his arms, forever, if need be. \"Don't worry about them - they have so much retribution to seek, they will be glutted before they even think about you. Besides, you are atoning for your sins, here. Aren't you?\" Lysander thought about it. He supposed that the arrogance and pride of his previous life had been taken from him (in ways he didn't want to remember), and living a humble life might be regarded as a form of atonement. But would it be seen as such by three angry and vengeful goddesses? Not vengeful, he corrected himself hurriedly. They brought justice, that's what he'd meant. You never knew who might be listening. \"Besides, no-one may harm you.\" Poseidon looked quite stern at this point. \"Do you know why?\" Lysander wasn't sure, not completely, but he decided to make a leap of faith. \"I belong to you. I am yours.\" Poseidon's brilliant smile lit up the dim cave, and the rest of his words were spoken into Lysander's mouth. And so Lysander accepted these feelings, which had been alien to him in the past: of belonging, of being wanted, being treasured, being loved. This strange bliss sustained Lysander through the dream-like voyage back through the sea to the fishing village, through the amazed and shocked reactions to his transformation, and was with him even now, as he prepared for the daily work that had become an intrinsic part of his life. It hadn't changed much, even after he had come back to the village superficially a new man. No-one except for Hipparchus knew that his facial wounds weren't the only ones that had been healed. He had been known for his modesty and shame, so he felt no impulse to change that now. Unlike in his dreams, in which his idyll with Poseidon was cut short by his intrusive fears, the reality had been interrupted in a different way. He was still saddened when he remembered Poseidon telling him that he did not think they could meet again, in the near future. \"Lord Zeus is being... difficult. We can no longer interact with mortals as we once did.\" Lysander smiled as he recalled deciding to take what he could in the time they had left, and pulling Poseidon's head down to his for a last kiss, which turned into many kisses, and more besides. He smiled again, sitting on the boat, mending his nets. Maybe one day he would see Poseidon again - until then, his memories would sustain him. In the years that had passed, young men had started appearing in the village, after travelling market-traders had spread the word that there was a living to be made in a small village with many widows. The only drawback was that Lysander did not exactly fit in this picture, having no wife or family to call his own. Once his scars were gone, the young men only saw another rival, and at times it was hard for Lysander to persuade them that he had no interest in any woman, or man for that matter. Often it took two or three visits from the village elders to persuade the incomers that whatever mystery lay in Lysander's past (which was never talked about, no matter how insistent the incomers became) or present, the fact remained that the village had never been so prosperous in human memory. And that forcing Lysander to leave would be a very bad idea, for everyone. Most of the young men had no objections to this situation. Soon, children of their own were born, strengthening their ties to the strange little village which had survived while so many others had been destroyed by the madness of King Hyperion. These men saw Lysander's kindness to Hipparchus, a frail old man who he treated like a father, they saw how he worked harder than anyone else, how he was courteous to everyone, and seemed in some way thankful; for what, in particular, it was never made clear. His only strangeness was his devotion to the old statue of the god in the inlet, which he visited every day, with sacrifices and prayers. And that was not so strange, in a fishing village. And so the incomers looked to their own families, deciding that one strange man in an entire village was not so terrible, after all. One man, however, would not be persuaded. Kopris felt that he had somehow been cheated of what he had been promised; by whom, he could not say. To him, his wife was not the most attractive in the village; her young son disliked him on sight, and worst of all, after a year, she had never quickened with his own child. To the others, Lysander among them, he just seemed as sullen as he had been since he first came to their village. He did not confide in his wife, as he was used to the company of men. He could not confide in the other men, his age mates, who were content with their lot. He could not talk to the village elders who, he had been made to understand, had suffered greatly in the past, and who would not be interested in his discontent. And so the feelings of frustration and resentment grew inside him until the day came once more when their fish was to be taken to market by mule-cart. The town was a few days from the village, but the fish would keep, having been dried or salted down. Kopris offered to make the journey, the first time he had done so, and even though she did not show it, his wife dared to hope that he was finally getting used to life in their village. A week later, Lysander saw a young boy setting out for the hills, following the village goats, who knew the way to their favourite grazing ground, and were eager to get there. The boy could barely keep up with them, and as he hurried up the rocky path, he had a wave and a smile for Lysander, who waved back. As Lysander walked towards the quay, he saw the boy's mother standing in her doorway, looking anxiously after her son as he went in the direction she'd hoped her husband would be coming from. Lysander nodded at her and she seemed to need to make some form of conversation. \"His step-father should be back today.\" She sounded worried. In fact, her husband was a few days overdue, and Lysander hoped that the other women had not filled her ears with gossip. The old men had been doing enough of that, with more than one remarking, in Lysander's earshot, that maybe Kopris had simply sold the fish instead of bartering and had walked away with their one mule and cart. He tried to smile in a reassuring manner, conscious of the fact that there were probably more eyes on him than he could see, whose owners would be all too happy to tell her husband, when he came back, that \"handsome Lysander\" had been smiling and chatting with his wife. Even though he felt ungrateful when he had such thoughts, he sometimes wished Poseidon had left him his facial scarring. No-one besides Hipparchus really understood why he hadn't tried for a wife after his return from the cave, and perhaps Lysander didn't really understand it himself. Poseidon hadn't forbidden him a wife, or even a lover, but Lysander didn't want anyone else. Those hours in the cave had filled him with such contentment and joy that he only had to think back on them to feel happy again. And when the loneliness became too much, he tended to the statue and looked out to sea, hoping against hope to see a merry face looking back at him. He swam sometimes, when they weren't fishing, enjoying the feelings of buoyancy and freedom, and if he sometimes thought he heard a voice saying, \"Wait for me\", he wasn't telling anyone. Lysander marshalled his thoughts. \"I'm sure he will be.\" He smiled again. \"His delay is probably a result of his mastery of haggling, to get the most goods for our fish!\" Ianthe smiled back at him, happier now. \"I sent Eryx with the goats - maybe he will meet his st- his father on the way!\" She sounded so hopeful that Lysander just nodded and went on his way. He was careful to avoid showing his real thoughts - that if the boy Eryx met his step-father on the way home there would be no happy conversation, but only dark thoughts and sullen sniping. The elders were not happy with Kopris, but felt they could not interfere as nothing overt had occurred. Lysander wished he could take it on himself to tell the man to count his blessings, to adapt or leave, but who was he to take such an action? He had not been born in the village, and this simple fact would make him an incomer, a virtual stranger, for a very long time. They would not go fishing that day - there were high clouds in the distance and being unsure of the weather, devoted the day to repairing their nets. Long afterwards, Lysander would believe that the god had been watching over him even then. For at about midday, hours before the boy should have returned from the pastureland, a strange commotion drew the fishermen to the other end of the village, where they witnessed a bizarre scene. Lysander watched in horror as Eryx, carrying the lead goat in his arms, slipped and slid down the rocky path, with all the other goats bleating worriedly and following. He was out of breath, and struggled to speak, but one word was terrifyingly clear. \"Soldiers!\" Lysander felt a sudden jerk under his feet, as if the world had moved sideways and then righted itself again. He tried to speak, but his mouth felt dry, and he was afraid that if he opened his mouth again only a croak would come out. He looked around him, willing someone to take over, to take charge, but all eyes were on him, some accusatory, others pleading. Ianthe pushed her way through the crowd, and once again Lysander felt horrified, this time at the thought of common soldiers, and what they would do to women who walked unveiled in the street, fearless. \"Did you not meet your father on the way?\" The boy answered her with a defiant look. \"He is not my father!\" He relented at her pleading look and continued. \"He is with them, the soldiers, I mean. He is driving the cart, and he talks and laughs with them. I think-\" Here Eryx hesitated. He exchanged looks with Lysander, who gave him a little nod. The time for kind lies had passed. Kopris had betrayed them all, and if they were to survive the day, they would have to show a united front. Kopris was one of them no longer. The boy cleared his throat. \"I think he brought them here. He pointed towards the wider path. I only arrived before them because I took the goat path. They are just behind that ridge.\" Everyone turned to look in that direction, as if they hadn't seen the ridge every day of their lives. Lysander realised that he had to do something, or else they would all stand there, frozen like puppets, occasionally jerking from side to side, unable to act, until the soldiers rode down into the village. He noticed that Hypatia had hurried up to them, drawn by the commotion, and she must have heard the boy's words. \"Hypatia, Ianthe, gather the women and children, and take them to-\" He wasn't even sure what he was going to say next. Was there even time to get to the caves? \"We won't get to the caves in time,\" Hypatia interrupted. \"But will they be out of sight? I can try to keep their attention here, for a while. It's me they want, anyway.\" Lysander tried to keep any hint of self-pity out of his voice. These people did not deserve the wrath that was headed his way. He, on the other hand, did. \"They can't have you!\" Lysander sighed. Hipparchus had been ill, that winter, and had not fully recovered. He spent most of his days lying in the shade, looking out to sea, waiting for Lysander to return. He'd hoped Hipparchus had been sleeping so deeply that he hadn't noticed the commotion, but that was not to be. He noticed that Hypatia had taken the opportunity to run off, dragging a protesting Ianthe along, followed by Eryx, who was still carrying the lead goat. He hoped she'd know to take the hill-paths, behind the statue of the god. Even if the women and children didn't reach the caves by the time the soldiers arrived, they'd be out of sight. Hipparchus was leaning heavily on the staff he'd started to use recently. All the other elders avoided his angry looks - they were clearly not prepared to sacrifice themselves for someone who was, essentially, a stranger to them. It would take more than the odd decade for Lysander to be part of the village, something he knew very well. The other young men milled around uncertainly. Separated from their wives and children, they were clearly unsure of what, if anything, they should contribute. Lysander had kept his eyes on the one who clearly felt he should lead, and who seemed to be working himself up to suggest that Lysander should be offered up to the soldiers. Seeing as that was Lysander's own intention, he just wanted to say it himself, as Hipparchus was clearly going to attack anyone who even hinted at this solution. As he'd been having coughing fits since his illness, something which had been worrying Lysander more than he cared to admit, he was afraid that any outburst would set Hipparchus off again. \"Hipparchus, you must let me speak with them.\" Lysander took the old man by the shoulders and shook him, gently. Hipparchus had tears in his eyes, but blinked fiercely, unwilling to let them fall. \"They will kill you!\" \"Am I not worth the village? Had I not come here, you wouldn't be in danger.\" \"Had you not come here, we would have starved to death that winter!\" Hipparchus still sounded angry, but he'd started to look resigned, too. Lysander knew he wasn't stupid or senile, and there was no other way this could go. He only hoped the soldiers would take him and leave the village untouched. He wasn't sure whether Kopris knew about the caves, though. It was as good a time as any to pray, and he wished he was closer to the sea, as he prayed desperately that Ianthe hadn't been so trusting as to tell her husband about the village's most important secret. Lysander himself did not trust in the good nature of soldiers. He should know, he'd been one once. As though his very thoughts had called them into being, the first soldiers crested over the ridge. They were mostly infantry, with a mounted Regiment commander. One of the hoplites was walking the commander's spare horses, and the others were marching along Kopris's cart, chatting with him, happy of the slow pace. Lysander could not recognize the commander under his helmet, but he had no doubt he would. Why else would he bring fifty soldiers to a poor fishing village? This was someone whose brother, whose father he had wronged, and it was time to pay for his crimes. Hipparchus tried one last time. \"Hide, Lysander - they have no reason to attack us!\" \"They will have reason - you have given me refuge all these years. Best you tell them you knew nothing.\" Lysander sighed, struck by a sudden thought - he should have died during the battle. These people did not deserve such a punishment. He thought again of Poseidon, and wished he had a way of asking the god to protect his people, but there was no time. The soldiers had arrived. Lysander took a few steps forward, trying to separate himself from the rest of the villagers. He noticed, from the corner of his eyes, that some of the men had brought rakes and scythes, hammers, chisels and other implements. He sighed, inwardly - the soldiers would mow them down within seconds. It must not come to this, he decided, and walked, trying to seem calm, towards the soldiers. The regiment commander stopped in front of Lysander and dismounted, taking off his helmet. Lysander did not recognize the man, but it had been almost a decade. He swallowed, nervously. \"I am Lysander,\" he said. \"You betrayed your village. You brought soldiers there. You joined Hyperion's army.\" \"Yes.\" Lysander could hear protesting begin behind him. The elders had changed their minds, it seemed, and were listing the things he had done for the village, the way he had helped them with no expectation of reward except food and a place to sleep. The hoplites started moving towards them and Lysander grew desperate. \"No! I am here, take me - they have done nothing, I deserve your wrath, but not them.\" The commander gave him a contemptuous look, strode forward and delivered a backhand that sent Lysander to his knees on the stony ground. He grabbed Lysander by the hair and pulled his head back, studying his face. \"Where are Hyperion's marks? You are as I remember, only older. How is it that you are unblemished, while all the others that we killed had been turned into horrors?\" \"Sorcery! Evil magics!\" Lysander wished, not for the first time, that they had turned Kopris away when he'd first come to their village. The commander pushed him face down into the ground. Lysander's lip was bleeding, and as he lay there, staring at the sand which was soaking up his blood, it seemed to him that the last years had been a fever dream, and he was there again, at Hyperion's last battle, waiting for the Minotaurs to finish him off. When he tried to get up, a foot landed on his neck and kept him in place. \"You promised me! You promised I could have the pick of any woman.\" Would that son of a dog not be quiet, Lysander thought. It seemed the commander shared his opinion, if not enough to spare the villagers. \"Enough, cur! You will get your reward soon enough.\" Lysander could hear scuffling close by, and a few slaps as the hoplites kept the villagers in check, but at least no-one had drawn swords. Yet, his treacherous mind supplied. Who knew what they would do to give Kopris his 'reward'? And yet, he could feel something strange happening under him, pinned to the ground as he was. Had there been... a rumble? Movement? \"You two, tie his hands and put him in the cart.\" Lysander stumbled as he was pulled upright and held firmly in between two hulking foot-soldiers. Kopris's protests were loud and immediate, and through the sand in his eyes he could see the contempt in the commander's face. \"Did you think you were going to stay here with her, whatever mangy bitch you chose? Go and pick your woman, fool.\" \"No!\" Lysander knew he was just adding to the beating he was going to get very soon, but he couldn't stop himself. \"They have done nothing wrong, spare them!\" The commander made a sign for the hoplites to hold him steady, and punched Lysander in the stomach. As he doubled over in pain, one of the men pulled his head up by the hair, and the commander elbowed him in the face. As he coughed and retched, more droplets of blood hit the sand. \"No one will be harmed, and whatever woman he chooses will soon become accustomed to her lot. Is it not a small price to pay for remaining unscathed after harbouring such a monster, one woman?\" Lysander could see the commander's smirk through the blurring in his eyes, even as he realised that he was the monster being referred to. It had been a long time since he thought of himself as a monster. The commander moved closer and murmured into Lysander's ear. \"We still have those bulls your King used to discipline men in. Your last hours, maybe even days, will be spent in one of them. A fitting punishment, don't you think?\" Lysander looked past him, trying not to show the panic and horror caused by the commander's word, and found that he could see Kopris striding confidently into the village, sure, by his gait, that he would soon be dragging his reward out by the hair, if necessary. Except Kopris stumbled. Which didn't seem strange to Lysander - the small stones on the path were tricky enough, even for the sure-footed. But then the other villagers started to move, as well as the cart, and Lysander, and the soldiers holding him back. The earth was shaking, and as if terrified by that fact, the commander's three horses lost their minds. The most magnificent one, a big grey, pulled free of the soldier holding the reins and reared up, lashing out madly with its hooves, landing a couple of blows that would surely have killed the soldier if not for his helmet. \"It is the god! You will all be punished for what you have done!\" Lysander was glad to hear that Hipparchus had not been in any way intimidated by the soldiers, even though a soldier immediately turned around and punched him to the ground. Lysander felt a sudden wave of rage crash over him, and he struggled like a madman. \"Leave him alone! He could be your grandfather!\" The ground had stopped rumbling, but the horses were still stamping, and the big grey kept everyone a fair distance away. Which was why everyone, except Lysander and the commander, missed the enormous figure striding out of the sea, wielding a trident many feet high, and bringing with him a wall of water which crashed over houses and men alike, but somehow only swept the soldiers off their feet, leaving the villagers unharmed. The soldier who had hit Hipparchus landed badly on one arm, and even Lysander winced as he heard the crack. But all noise was drowned out when Poseidon spoke. \"WHO DARES? WHO DARES?\" The voice was so loud Lysander could feel it reverberate in his bones. The only soldiers still on their feet covered their ears and sank to the ground, in fear as well as pain. Kopris became mad with terror, and tried to run to his cart, but a wave lifted him bodily to a height of twenty feet and dashed him to the ground, where he lay still. The commander stood his ground, Lysander gave him that. His grip on Lysander's arm tightened, and if he shook a little, Lysander understood that being faced with such power for the first time was a chastening experience. The huge head turned to him, and one enormous eye closed and opened again. Lysander had to stop himself from smiling back, but thankfully no-one else seemed to have noticed the furious sea-god winking at him. \"Lord, we did not know he was under your protection-\" the commander began. His voice was as steady as could be expected, under the circumstances, but Poseidon was not mollified. \"RELEASE HIM!\" The words were so loud Lysander imagined they were written across the sky in huge granite blocks. The soldiers still on each side of him immediately let him go, even though their commander had given no such order. \"This village is under my protection! None shall harm whoever resides here! None shall harm what is MINE!\" The last word forced them to their knees again. \"But lord, he is a traitor, and a murderer!\" Lysander was starting to admire this commander, in spite of his intense desire to end his life. He wondered, sadly, which of the commander's relatives he'd betrayed. The huge figure turned to them and said no more, but the commander seemed to hear something, as he winced, as if the sounds in his head were too loud to be borne. He looked at his men meaningfully, and they all started moving towards him, leaving the villagers where they stood, or lay. The horses had calmed down, and the commander quietly instructed some men to take their reins, except for the big grey, which he would ride. About to swing himself into the saddle, the commander hesitated, as his hand gripped the horse's mane, and tightened convulsively. He looked up into Poseidon's face. The god inclined his head graciously, and Lysander didn't know what it meant, only that the commander understood and nodded. He swung himself into the saddle, patting the horse's neck. It suddenly dawned on Lysander that the commander had been asking whether a sacrifice was necessary - it obviously was not, and Lysander was glad of that. He wanted no living creature to die for his sake. The soldiers left the village at a quick trot, and soon the only people in sight were the villagers, and Lysander. And of course Poseidon, legs like enormous tree-trunks, sea-weed entwined around his limbs, eyes staring into the distant horizon. Lysander looked up and that huge bearded face smiled down at him, an enormous hand reaching down, a thumb passing over his face and healing his cut lip, his grazed scalp. A moan from the group of elders distracted him from Poseidon's hypnotic gaze, and he realized that they were clustered around the fallen figure of Hipparchus, who lay where he had fallen when the soldier punched him. Lysander raced to his side, and one of the other old men turned to him. \"I think a rib might be broken. Bastard didn't have to hit him that hard.\" Before Lysander could do anything, the gasps from the crowd alerted him to Poseidon's approach. Well, not really an approach, he told himself. Poseidon only had to turn and reach down, and his hand passed gently over the old man's chest, healing as it went. As Lysander watched, the old man took one deep breath, and then another, with more confidence - he nodded at Lysander, who, for the first time that day, gave in to his emotions and crushed Hipparchus to his chest. \"Come, come,\" Hipparchus said, patting him on the shoulder awkwardly. \"We are alive and well, no harm done.\" But his eyes shone too, and his hands shook. Lysander helped him to his feet, and the villagers started moving away from him, muttering something about seeing to the nets, even though no-one had been fishing, that day. One of them glanced at Lysander and then looked upwards, as if to remind him of something he'd forgotten. Or someone. Oh, yes. Poseidon was still standing there, like a huge statue. Only his head moved, as he looked over the ridge where the soldiers could probably still be seen, from his vantage point. Poseidon looked down at him, and his eyes became kind again. \"Follow me. We need to converse.\" Poseidon's voice did not boom so loud anymore - it was more like a rumble of distant thunder. His steps were huge as he strode towards his statue in the inlet, but he seemed to diminish with every step, until, waiting for Lysander in the small cove, was the merry youth who had greeted him in the cave. Lysander had passed the villagers who were gathered in groups discussing what had happened, except for the young husbands who'd gone to the caves to tell the women the danger was over. They'd had to draw lots to decide who to leave behind to bury Kopris. It was not fair to leave such an onerous duty to his wife, who had been as much fooled and cast aside as the rest of them. The elders were the only ones to greet Lysander and meet his eyes - he guessed it was because the younger men were eager to forget all that had occurred, and would simply remember that a lucky earthquake and high tide had saved them from destruction. They would sacrifice to Poseidon in thanks, but would prefer to forget about sixty-foot gods striding out of the sea. As he hurried towards the inlet, he had to run a gauntlet of backslapping and praise. One of the old men had had a couple of amphorae of wine hidden away, and a cup was pressed into his hand as he hurried along. He was glad of it - he hadn't liked the look in Poseidon's eyes as he stared after the soldiers and their commander, and maybe an offering of wine would placate him for a while. And also an offering of his body, though Lysander's honesty won out here - he'd missed the god, and after almost dying he wanted so badly to feel Poseidon's arms around him. As he splashed into the inlet, he was immediately enveloped in Poseidon's embrace, the cup was taken from his nerveless fingers and put into a concave depression, and he was summarily stripped and kissed breathless. \"They would have killed you, they would have taken you from me...\" Lysander's ears rang from lack of breath, but he heard what Poseidon said between frantic kisses. He stroked the lustrous curls and kissed the god back. \"But you saved me - you saved everyone-\" \"They dared touch you, touch this village,\" Poseidon interrupted, enraged again. His moods were as mercurial as the weather out at sea, Lysander thought. \"I will curse them!\" \"My love,\" Lysander answered, feeling very daring. \"Please spare them.\" He knew he could not say 'no' to the sea-god, but perhaps a request would do. \"Why do you plead for them? \" There was genuine puzzlement on Poseidon's features, and Lysander struggled to come up with a way to explain himself to such a powerful being. They are simple mortals, he wanted to say, they see injustice and think revenge will make them feel better. Yes, they wanted to kill me horribly, but these were the lessons Hyperion taught them - that mortals needed to make their own justice, and not rely on the gods anymore. That mortals could be as capricious and thoughtless as the gods, and cause as much pain. Though Lysander knew he could not utter the last thought. He did love Poseidon, after all. \"I am safe, in your arms.\" He punctuated his words with kisses, knowing that Poseidon would not resist him. \"The village is safe. They will not return. And we will be more careful about who we admit in the future.\" Lysander was determined to accomplish this by involving himself with the elders, in the days to come. They would not have to go through this again, with different soldiers, and another commander that he'd wronged in his past. \"I was almost too late,\" Poseidon insisted. Lysander smiled, fondly. \"You would have been able to find me anywhere.\" \"Well, yes,\" he admitted. \"But rage fills me when I think of their hands on you.\" \"How did you know, anyway?\" Lysander was still puzzled about this. Poseidon looked shaken, as much as an immortal being could. \"Your blood hit the stones - the very bones of the earth called out to me, telling me to save my love.\" Poseidon declaimed happily, and Lysander smiled at his joy. So dramatic, his divine lover. \"There is something you wish to ask me; I can see it in your eyes.\" Lysander played for time by grasping the cup of wine and offering it to Poseidon. The god smiled at him wickedly, and poured the wine over his chest, where he proceeded to lick it off, paying special attention to Lysander's nipples, which were soon as erect as other parts of his body. Between gasps of pleasure and deep kisses it was difficult to keep his question in mind, and soon Lysander was simply lost in ecstasy. At one point, he protested that surely the women and children would be able to see them as they came back from the caves. \"I will envelop us in a glamour,\" Poseidon said grandly, \"and hide us from their sight.\" The deep kisses continued, and soon Poseidon was caressing him in more intimate ways. \"Will you really hide us?\" \"No. They need to learn who you belong to.\" The god smirked, and turned Lysander onto his stomach. He sighed, pillowing his head on his folded arms, and let himself be lost in pleasure. Hours later, they were lying side by side on the warm rocks, which were still heated from the afternoon sun. The promised storm had not arrived, and the air was comfortable enough to dry them off. Lysander ached pleasantly from their exertions, and had almost forgotten the unpleasant events earlier that day. Poseidon was dropping soft kisses on his neck, nipping gently at his lips from time to time, when he pulled back and stared into Lysander's eyes. \"Ask your question.\" Lysander knew what he meant. \"What did you say to the commander, when he called me a traitor and a murderer?\" \"How do you know I said anything?\" \"He did not seem the kind of man to leave without an answer, even if he was being told to do so by a god.\" Poseidon stroked Lysander's hair as he replied, perhaps to take the sharp edge off his words. \"I showed him your suffering. I showed what Hyperion did to you. I told him what would be your punishment here.\" \"Which is?\" Poseidon wouldn't meet his eyes at first, but then looked deep into them as he continued. \"You live here, far away from the citadels of power, in a small forgotten village, as a poor fisherman, who once was a soldier. There will be no great feats here, or quests, just daily hard labour until the day you die.\" Here Poseidon paused, and seemed to consider his words as he went on. \"There will be no wife for you, no children, no sons. Your line ends with you. But... I did not tell him that you are my beloved, and that I will always be by your side.\" Lysander grinned so wide his face was aching. \"My love,\" he gasped, and could not stop himself from grabbing the god's face and kissing him deeply. Poseidon laughed in between kisses, praising what he called Lysander's new found confidence. \"Where is that shy boy I seduced in an underwater cavern?\" He laughed merrily, and pulled Lysander on top of him. Lysander smiled and kissed his way down Poseidon's chest, and then up again to his lips. \"Will you truly be by my side till the day I die?\" Lysander wondered at his own daring, asking such a thing of an immortal being. Poseidon nibbled at his ear and whispered. \"And beyond, love. I will not let you go. Resign yourself to being mine, forever.\" And so Lysander did. And one day, perhaps, after many years had passed, Lysander went to sleep for the last time, and woke up in a field of flowers with the sea shining in the distance, and a familiar figure waiting for him on the distant shore. The Erinyes, which means The Kindly Ones, was what ancient Greeks called The Furies - the three goddesses of vengeance and retribution, punishing murderers in various ways. I belong to the school of thought which believes that they were called 'Kindly' as a form of self-defence - to call them by their true name would risk bringing their wrath down on you. Poseidon, as well as being the god of the sea, was also the god of earthquakes. One of the animals associated with him was the horse.",
    "sentences": [
      "Poseidon leaned heavily on his trident as he let Zeus's words wash over him, choosing instead to concentrate on the horrendous mess the mortals had made of things, far below, but not far enough that he couldn't hear the screaming and the frantic prayers, which Zeus had now decided would not be answered.",
      "By what authority, he wanted to ask.",
      "Had Zeus forgotten that they were brothers?",
      "So Poseidon had chosen the guise of a young man, rather than his usual appearance as a venerable old man - that didn't make him any less powerful, any less what he was.",
      "So he had a favourite among the mortals - Zeus had Theseus, and he had this confused young mortal who had chosen the wrong path.",
      "Maybe he could nudge Lysander back towards the right one (yes, towards your bed, Zeus would say spitefully).",
      "This Theseus and Hyperion business was Zeus's problem, he decided.",
      "He, Poseidon, had been too long away from his real home - the sea.",
      "Its people were his business, and if he led one troubled soldier away from certain death on a whim, well, he was a god.",
      "He asked for no-one's permission.",
      "The sound of the waves hitting the shore and the smell of the sea woke Lysander from a fitful half-sleep, and he held his breath, cursing himself for having let down his guard, even for a few minutes.",
      "But no-one was in the small tent with him.",
      "No",
      "-one had taken advantage of his inattention, and slowly, his heart-rate returned to normal, and his fists unclenched.",
      "Now he was annoyed that something had disturbed the only rest he was likely to have for a while, and he wondered what it had been.",
      "Not the sea, of course.",
      "King Hyperion's camp was too far inland for that.",
      "He must have been dreaming.",
      "It had seemed so real, though.",
      "He could almost taste the salt spray on his lips, feel the cool water on his face... no matter.",
      "He must have been woken by some noise in the camp.",
      "One of the many noises - a scream, the sounds of sobbing, pleading for mercy.",
      "It was always so loud in the camp.",
      "Lysander scoffed at himself for that thought, as he turned the mask over and over in his hands.",
      "All are equal in Hyperion's army, he thought, and his mental voice sounded derisive.",
      "Yes, his previous camp had been loud too.",
      "He let himself wallow in the nostalgia for a few seconds, yearning after the groups of men drinking and exchanging tall tales of conquest, the camp followers washing their clothes and singing, and even some children, always getting underfoot.",
      "A far cry from the noise here - barked orders, screams of agony from the bulls (always the fucking bulls, bull-head masks, metal bulls with fire underneath and the wailing always coming from the nostrils, along with the steam and the... smell) sobbing and wailing from anyone unfortunate enough to be left alive by the monstrous King.",
      "Yes, monstrous.",
      "He'd finally said it, even if it was in the privacy of his own head.",
      "In the other camp, he didn't have to hide away in a corner in case some of the other warriors (the ones who still had balls, he added resentfully) would use the weaklings for sport.",
      "That's what he was, now, a weakling, a eunuch.",
      "Lysander's resentment boiled over.",
      "He was in constant pain from his crushed testicles, and a more recent addition was a persistent ache in his lower back from... other things that had been done to him the one time he was naive enough to let his guard down.",
      "Lysander poked at the eye holes of the mask.",
      "Why had he come here?",
      "He was finding it hard to remember anything of his life before.",
      "What had led him to this place, this state?",
      "What had been so bad about his life that he'd thrown it away, and for this?",
      "In trying to retrace his steps he always got stuck at the mallet.",
      "Hyperion had taken one look at him, had judged him as useless, and had laughed when that creature had carved up his face.",
      "And the hammer.",
      "That had been his reward.",
      "For treason, for murder.",
      "It was what he deserved.",
      "What had he thought, that they were going to put him out of his misery?",
      "Hadn't he been prepared to snivel and beg for his life?",
      "He remembered now.",
      "He'd been afraid to die!",
      "That was it.",
      "The thought struck him as hilarious, now.",
      "If he'd died then, fighting this army of horrors, he'd probably have been worthy of the Elysian Fields.",
      "Now, the state he was in, not even Hades would want him.",
      "He was so tired.",
      "He felt filthy, like the dirt was ingrained under his skin, and caked in it, at the same time.",
      "He couldn't even sleep here.",
      "Hidden as he was he could hear sobs and protestations from the men and boys being dragged out and shared amongst the creatures, which was what Hyperion called the worst of his warriors, the ones who wore the bull-head mask.",
      "No",
      "-one dared touch the women who'd been captured - those belonged to Hyperion alone.",
      "Not the pregnant ones, those had been tortured and slaughtered by the King, personally.",
      "And the children...",
      "Lysander shuddered.",
      "He didn't want to think about the children.",
      "As Lysander sat, lost in his thoughts, the night passed, and soon the army started mustering towards the wall, towards the last defence.",
      "He got up and joined them, for where could he go, marked as he was?",
      "Still, as they started their march towards the gate, he found himself walking slower and slower, until the whole army had almost passed him by.",
      "He was possessed by an almost irresistible desire to turn back, to walk away.",
      "He'd never wanted this.",
      "He'd just been so afraid of death that he hadn't considered that some things might be worse.",
      "He could go and throw himself on Theseus's sword, of course.",
      "That would have been the honourable thing to do.",
      "But when had he ever been honourable?",
      "And he felt so dirty.",
      "How could he die like this, less than a man, covered with the filth of Hyperion's very presence?",
      "As he stumbled along, dragging his feet, he became conscious of eyes on him.",
      "Not the common foot-soldiers like himself, their very masks prevented peripheral vision.",
      "And maybe that had been one of the reasons they all wore them, he thought bitterly.",
      "No looking around for those in Hyperion's army, always stare straight ahead, focussed on whatever Hyperion wanted.",
      "He couldn't even look to the side to see who had seen his reluctance, but he could guess - one of the Minotaurs, who were tasked with maintaining discipline as well as torture, rape and slaughter.",
      "As if in a dream, he felt the swing of the hammer as it whistled towards his head and managed to turn a stumble into a headlong fall, and lay on the ground as the rest of the army passed by.",
      "People stepped onto his hands and his legs, but he didn't move.",
      "He was sure that the Minotaur even kicked him a few times, but his performance must have been convincing, as eventually he was left alone.",
      "Without moving his head, he could see though one of the eyeholes as he lay on the ground.",
      "Hundreds of feet disappeared into a huge dust cloud which seemed to have swallowed the world.",
      "When he heard the explosion signalling Hyperion's use of the weapon of the gods, Lysander got up, and, after one last look towards the army, which by now was charging towards the wall, started a slow but steady plod in the other direction.",
      "He did not look back again, even when he heard a distant rumble and the ground started shaking so strongly he nearly lost his footing.",
      "Through some magic or optical illusion as he had heard was common in the desert, it seemed to him he could see the sea in the distance.",
      "He would reach it.",
      "And at least, maybe he would be clean when he died.",
      "Lysander walked for days.",
      "How many exactly, he was never sure afterwards.",
      "Sometimes he slept during the night, at others, he slept during the day, so he quickly lost track of time.",
      "He used the cloth of his mask to gather up dew, and sucked off the scant moisture it offered.",
      "The sweat ran down his face and stung his barely healed wounds during the day, while his whole body shivered so hard during the cold desert nights that his legs started cramping, yet he never stopped his slow steady pace.",
      "Often he had terrible dreams, that the Minotaurs had found him, that Hyperion stood at his head as he woke.",
      "But they were just dreams.",
      "Each day, or night, he woke and he was alone, something he was thankful for.",
      "He never came across any houses or villages or farms, something which he was also glad for, though at times he felt as though he was the only man left alive in the world.",
      "He was always hungry, and occasionally he found insects and grubs to eat which looked terrible and tasted worse, but which at least gave him the strength to keep walking.",
      "One day, just as the niggling thought came to him that his increasingly weak body could not take much more of this, he realised that he'd been hearing a strange sound for a while now.",
      "No, it wasn't a strange sound.",
      "It was one he'd known, but had forgotten, the sound of waves hitting the shore and retreating.",
      "The air smelled different, of freshness and salt, rather than pure condensed heat.",
      "He tried to look up, but his eyes had long ago swelled up in reaction to the punishing desert sun and the dust raised by his sandals as he plodded along, so he saw nothing until he stumbled down a rocky incline and splashed into a shallow inlet.",
      "As dehydrated as he was, he managed to squeeze out a few tears of joy, which cleared his eyes even as they stung unbearably on his scarred face.",
      "He was in a little cove, not enough sand to be called a beach, but pebbles and rocks, and a floor which seemed to slope off gradually, but which he knew would drop off in a few metres.",
      "He laughed in joy and threw away the horrid rag, all which remained of the mask which Hyperion had put over his face after turning him into a monster.",
      "Lysander splashed the cold sea water over his limbs, and waded in deeper.",
      "It was his imagination, he knew, but he could feel it scouring off the dirt and the horrors, all the things he'd done and all the things that had been done to him.",
      "As the cool, sparkling waters closed over his head, he laughed again, swallowing gratefully.",
      "He could die now.",
      "He was clean again.",
      "Lysander had never expected to wake up again, alive.",
      "But alive he was, and when he opened his eyes he saw that he was on some rocks.",
      "He started retching helplessly, as all the sea water he'd swallowed came out of him.",
      "Then he sensed rather than saw that he wasn't alone.",
      "He just had time to look up and see that three old fishermen had surrounded him, when something hard hit his head, and blackness washed over him once more.",
      "(See the end of the chapter for notes.)",
      "When Lysander woke up a second time, he could tell he was indoors without opening his eyes.",
      "He knew he must be in some primitive shack - he could feel a hard stone floor under him.",
      "He lay on his side, and fought the urge to look around him.",
      "Where was he, and why had he been brought to this place?",
      "The small house was full of people - he could hear the voices of old men arguing, and occasionally he heard a female voice.",
      "Strange to hear a woman involved in such things.",
      "It slowly dawned on Lysander that they were arguing about him.",
      "\"He's a cursed soldier from Hyperion's army, look at his face!",
      "It is said Hyperion's bulls scar men this way and then give them masks to wear - we have to kill him, or he'll lead the rest of the army here, and this time no-one will survive the slaughter!\"",
      "This sounded like an elderly man who'd seen too much sorrow.",
      "Lysander couldn't help but agree with him - and he'd wanted to die.",
      "He still did.",
      "Didn't he?",
      "But another voice interrupted his thoughts - a woman, this time.",
      "\"He's a young man, strong despite his current state, and we need him.",
      "You won't allow the younger women to fish and you can't do this on your own anymore.\"",
      "\"I have heard that Hyperion's army was defeated-\" a different voice, yet another old man.",
      "\"Our young men will return and take up their nets-\" But he wasn't allowed to finish.",
      "\"No.\"",
      "Another man, this time.",
      "Lysander thought he sounded older, too, but he couldn't be sure.",
      "How had they all escaped Hyperion's army?",
      "His cheeks burned as he remembered his own village, where no-one had been left after he'd led the tyrant's men there.",
      "\"Those who weren't killed outright by the monstrous King died in his battle.",
      "I hear that the gods themselves joined the lists and struck him down, as well as any who fought by his side.",
      "At least,\" and here Lysander imagined the man shrugged, for his next words were more rueful and down to earth, \"that's what Kephalos, the pot seller, told me yesterday.\"",
      "The discussion dissolved into a hubbub of yelled arguments between those who thought Kephalos the pot seller was an old windbag pickled in wine, and those who scoffed at the thought of the gods taking a direct interest in the suffering of mortals.",
      "No",
      "-one scoffed at the gods, though, Lysander noticed.",
      "There was a lot of reverence here, and not a little fear too.",
      "Lysander guessed that, living on the bounty of the sea as they did, they couldn't afford to alienate any gods who might be listening.",
      "Lysander himself didn't know what he felt about the gods - he'd always joined in the rituals, and made sacrifices without really thinking about it.",
      "He remembered being very young and hearing stories about the gods disguising themselves as mortals to walk among them, but he was fairly sure he'd never seen a god.",
      "Sure, he'd heard the mountain come down behind him, but he'd never actually seen how it happened.",
      "Who's to say it wasn't a conveniently timed... event.",
      "Of some kind.",
      "A comet, maybe.",
      "They'd said Theseus had been directly helped by the gods, though.",
      "This rumour had circulated at camp despite the amount of people Hyperion had killed to try and quash it.",
      "A high-pitched voice interrupted his thoughts.",
      "A woman, then.",
      "Young, by the sound of it.",
      "Things must be dire in this village if they allowed young women into their councils.",
      "\"We can't let him stay here, he will ravage us... I've heard stories...\" She sounded terrified.",
      "The older woman answered, reassuringly.",
      "\"My dear, he is incapable.",
      "The barbaric King Hyperion made sure that very few men besides himself would father children on the women of Greece.\"",
      "Lysander shuddered.",
      "He was still wearing his ragged old chiton,",
      "[1] but they must have... what?",
      "Examined him?",
      "He sensed that the men in the room were shuffling around uncomfortably at such talk, and wished he could too.",
      "\"He will stay with me.\"",
      "This was a new voice, another old man, of which the village seemed to have an inexhaustible supply.",
      "\"I will teach him to fish and we will not starve, or have to eat all our goats to survive.\"",
      "\"He will refuse - why else would he have joined that damned army if not to escape honest labour?\"",
      "\"Why not ask him?",
      "He's been awake for a while now.\"",
      "Lysander flushed, sensing that everyone in the room was staring at him now.",
      "He opened his eyes, cringing slightly at the attention.",
      "Now that he could look around him, he saw that he was in a small room which seemed to be bursting with people.",
      "He recognized the three old fishermen who had found him on the beach where he woke up - they looked very much like one would expect elderly fishermen to look: white, thinning hair, faces nut-brown, eyes surrounded by a mass of wrinkles from squinting into the sun all day.",
      "The older woman he had heard speak drew herself up, regally, and nodded to him.",
      "Her long brown hair was shot with streaks of grey and pulled back into a knot, while her chiton and himation,2 worn and faded, were nevertheless clean.",
      "He didn't know why he was staring at her, except maybe she reminded him of his mother.",
      "He deliberately didn't try to look at the younger woman he'd heard speak - the last thing he needed was for these men, who seemed to hate him on principle, to think he had any designs on their younger women.",
      "This can't have been a poor village, before Hyperion came, he thought.",
      "Now, well.",
      "Some of them considered his arrival to be a sign of hope.",
      "Things must truly be desperate, then.",
      "Lysander tried to get up, only for one of the old men to plant his staff in his chest, forcing him back down.",
      "\"How can we trust him?",
      "How do we know he's not just scouting for his master?\"",
      "The last word was said with a sneer.",
      "Lysander opened his mouth to speak but all that came out was a croak - he dimly recalled retching what seemed like half the ocean and his throat was on fire.",
      "The older woman walked over to him, and held a cup to his mouth.",
      "Just water.",
      "They wouldn't be wasting any wine on him.",
      "\"Slowly, now, or you'll be sick again.\"",
      "The old man was impatient.",
      "\"Well?",
      "Why did you come here?",
      "Speak, eunuch!\"",
      "Lysander flushed again, this time in anger, though he held on to it, with difficulty.",
      "He could hardly deny it.",
      "He was a eunuch.",
      "That was what he was, now.",
      "\"I walked away from the final battle.\"",
      "Lysander spoke carefully and with some difficulty - his voice sounded hoarse and unfamiliar to his own ears.",
      "He ignored the various mutterings of coward, and see?",
      "I told you-.",
      "\"I never intended to come here.",
      "I wanted to find the sea.",
      "I-\" Lysander trailed off, not wanting to admit he'd actually thought of suicide.",
      "Not that they would have disapproved - might have even given him a hand.",
      "\"Maybe he wanted to make sacrifice to the god,\" the young woman said timidly, before blushing at the sudden attention, and drawing her veil across her face.",
      "Lysander didn't need to ask which god she meant.",
      "This was a fishing village, after all.",
      "\"And the god rejected him, threw him back!",
      "It's a sign!\"",
      "This was the old man with the staff, who was using it now to prod Lysander and slap him a few times on the thigh.",
      "The man who'd said Lysander could stay with him shook his head.",
      "\"No, it's a gift.",
      "The god hears our prayers and gives us someone to help us in our work.\"",
      "Lysander could see various people drawing deep breaths to speak, probably to protest that a half-starved eunuch wasn't much of a gift, and then stopping abruptly, no doubt realising the danger of loudly questioning the god's answer to their prayers.",
      "\"My name is Hipparchus,\" the old man said, helping Lysander up.",
      "\"What is yours?\"",
      "Lysander opened his mouth, and closed it again.",
      "He was seized with a sudden hatred for himself, combined with pity for a village so poor that it saw his arrival as a blessing from the gods.",
      "\"Aischrion,\" he answered.",
      "Hipparchus looked puzzled, while the other old man, the one with the staff, barked out a laugh.",
      "\"The name suits,\" he said, and seemed to want to add more, but the older woman stopped him with a look.",
      "She looked at Lysander with pity in her eyes, and for a moment he hated her for that.",
      "\"I hardly think your mother gave you the name 'Ugly', not with that lovely golden hair,\" she said, gently.",
      "Lysander shrugged, not trusting himself to answer.",
      "The meeting was breaking up, but the curmudgeonly old man still found time to mutter, on his way out, that the golden hair was probably the reason Poseidon spared Lysander's life, and now they were stuck with a eunuch just because the god wanted some mortal eromenos to warm his bed.",
      "The young woman covered her mouth in delighted horror, and the other men just shook their heads.",
      "Evidently they were used to such salty talk.",
      "\"Come,\" said Hipparchus.",
      "\"You need a bath, and a change of clothing.\"",
      "He sniffed, meaningfully, and Lysander cringed.",
      "He couldn't smell himself anymore, which was probably just as well.",
      "He wondered if taking a bath here meant dunking himself in the stream he could hear in the distance, but, following Hipparchus out of the small house they'd been in, he realised they were going to the centre of the village.",
      "He looked around, curiously.",
      "It was late afternoon, light enough to see a rather small village, with a handful of small houses set back from a rocky coastline.",
      "He could just see a small inlet with a few fishing boats moored.",
      "In one of the natural depressions he found what he'd been looking for: a statue of Poseidon with his trident, made of marble, he was surprised to see.",
      "But then, it wasn't a huge statue - it was bigger than a tall man, but not much bigger.",
      "The houses too were economically built - made of stone or brick, not big, but sufficient, and all of them neatly made and clean.",
      "No, this hadn't been a rich town before Hyperion came, but it must have been happy.",
      "Now, all the young men were gone, he could see.",
      "There were some children playing - in a village this small they wouldn't have been cooped up in the women's quarters, if they even had such a thing here.",
      "Lysander was glad a few children had escaped Hyperion's hands.",
      "While he was lost in his thoughts, they had arrived at the village's small bath-house - he managed to stop himself from being surprised that a village so small even had such a thing.",
      "Still, he almost embarrassed himself when he saw Hipparchus light the fire under the stones.",
      "It was on the tip of his tongue to ask where the slave was, but he bit back his words.",
      "Was that all it took, a few hours among civilised people, and he forgot where he'd spent the last weeks, living in his own filth among murderers and torturers, having become one of them?",
      "Hipparchus had got the fire going and grabbed a ladle for the olive oil - he gestured towards Lysander with it.",
      "\"Do you want me to-\" \"No! I mean, thank you, I'll do myself.\"",
      "Lysander was about to pull the chiton over his head before the usual oiling that went before a steam bath, but then he hesitated.",
      "Though why was he hesitating?",
      "Hipparchus already knew everything about him, and so he pulled the tunic off with a sudden burst of defiance, only to see that the old man had already turned his back.",
      "Lysander wasn't sure if Hipparchus was trying to spare his feelings or not.",
      "Either way, he was grateful.",
      "And angry, and hurt, and humiliated, which is why the next words which burst out of him were: \"I betrayed my village, you know.",
      "I killed my fellow soldiers and led Hyperion's army there.\"",
      "Hipparchus looked up, mildly.",
      "The rocks had heated up and he had started pouring water over them, after which he threw sage and rosemary on the brazier, and soon they were enveloped in clouds of sweet-smelling steam, the scent of which brought a sudden rush of nostalgia to Lysander.",
      "Through the steam he couldn't tell what Hipparchus was thinking, but his next words were mild in tone, though the story they told was horrific.",
      "\"My son did the same.",
      "Or tried to.\"",
      "Hipparchus's face tightened in pained recollection.",
      "\"We argued that day.",
      "He was angry at everything, at me, at the gods, at life, even.",
      "He said he would join that monster's army, to become his soldier, and we'd all see.\"",
      "He smiled, sadly.",
      "\"I never saw him again.",
      "Hypatia, the older woman you met today, had heard stories of what Hyperion's army was doing to the people they encountered, and she managed to convince many of us to hide in the sea caves on the coast.",
      "All the old people, many of the young women and children, none of the young men.",
      "When we returned, we saw...\" The old man closed his eyes, rubbing them.",
      "Lysander could imagine what they had seen, but he let Hipparchus continue.",
      "\"So many bodies - pregnant women, slaughtered like cattle.",
      "Young men, butchered in the street.",
      "Though not all of them - the women who were not with child were taken, as well as the some of the men.",
      "My son,\" he paused there, \"my son did not die that day.",
      "He joined Hyperion's army, so he must have been rewarded for his betrayal... or not.\"",
      "Hipparchus looked at Lysander with sudden comprehension.",
      "\"Was this your reward?",
      "Your face, and... your manhood?\" Hipparchus gestured towards Lysander's groin and Lysander wanted to cover himself.",
      "\"Did my son get the same treatment?\"",
      "\"I don't know.",
      "Hyperion was insane, I...\" he wanted to reassure the old man, but didn't know how.",
      "Knowing Hyperion, he'd done the same thing to Hipparchus's son, but how could he speak of such horrors to the only person who'd shown him any sympathy?",
      "\"No matter.\"",
      "Hipparchus shook his head and gestured at Lysander to stop him from speaking.",
      "\"It is done.",
      "My son is dead, but the village need not die too.",
      "We managed to save all the children, and some young women, so maybe young men will come here, in time.\"",
      "He lay back, soaking in the steam, and Lysander could see that he wasn't as old as he had thought, just prematurely aged through a hard life.",
      "\"Will you stay here, and work with us?\"",
      "Lysander wanted to say he hadn't known he had a choice, but that would sound churlish.",
      "They were going to clothe him and feed him - apparently death wasn't an option if even the sea threw him back, and what else was there for him?",
      "He nodded, and Hipparchus must have seen it through the steam, as he clapped him on the shoulder, and urged him up, handing him a strigil.3 \"Come, we'd best get going - you need to eat, and sleep.",
      "Tomorrow, you learn how to fish.",
      "Though, of course, I need to know the name of the man who will be living in my house.\"",
      "Lysander flushed and looked down, pretending to pay special attention to scraping the back of his leg.",
      "He muttered, \"Lysander,\" not willing to continue with the self-hatred that had driven him earlier.",
      "\"Good name.",
      "Come, come...\" Hipparchus rushed him into his filthy chiton, assuring him he'd have clean clothes soon, and chivvied him out of the bath-house - not a moment too soon, because a few of the men from the earlier meeting were casually dropping by, pretending not to be curious about him.",
      "Hipparchus's house was average-sized, with two small areas, one obviously for eating and the other with two low pallets for sleeping - Lysander wondered if he'd left his son's bed ready for him, in case he came back.",
      "There was food ready - bread, goats' cheese, olives and wine, which Hipparchus diluted carefully.",
      "Lysander ate only a little, and in small bites - he knew what would happen if he wolfed everything down.",
      "\"Now, take that filthy thing off, perhaps the women can get it clean again-\" \"Burn it- if you have something else for me to wear,\" Lysander spat out, dragging the hated thing over his head and shoulders and balling it up in his hands.",
      "Hipparchus nodded at him, seeming to understand the sudden rage which drove Lysander, who flushed again, embarrassed at his spontaneous words.",
      "These weren't exactly rich people.",
      "But Hipparchus simply opened a chest in the corner and drew out a chiton, which, while not new, was at least clean.",
      "\"This belonged to my son.",
      "It was his second-best...\" Hipparchus was looking at it as he spoke, and drawing his fingers through the folds.",
      "He looked up at Lysander, seeming to recollect where he was, and showed it to him.",
      "\"You can wear it in the morning.",
      "But now, I think you should get some sleep.\"",
      "Lysander's eyes were already drooping closed.",
      "He managed to hold one thought in his head, how strange it was that he was in comparatively good shape after his trek through the desert and his near drowning, but even that disappeared as he let himself fall asleep.",
      "1chiton: a tunic made up of a rectangle of woolen or linen fabric, fastened at the shoulders by pins, sewing, or buttons.",
      "A man's chiton was usually knee-length, while a woman's usually reached the ankles.",
      "2himation: a cloak.",
      "3strigil: a small, curved, metal tool used in ancient Greece to scrape dirt and sweat from the body.",
      "First perfumed oil was applied to the skin, and then it would be scraped off, along with the dirt.",
      "Lysander dreams of flying through the water, of ringing in his ears, of a comely young man with a sharp grin, dark hair and flashing eyes, guiding him towards the surface.",
      "The salt stings his eyes but he looks around in awe as shoals of fish support his weakened limbs, as a dolphin nips at his tattered chiton and pulls him up.",
      "More ominous shapes move past him silently, with inexorable purpose, and the last thing he sees before his eyes close is the flat black of a shark's eye as it too, it seems, is tasked with dragging him away from his self-administered punishment.",
      "He will remember nothing of this dream except the sensation of burning in his lungs, and the pain of drowning.",
      "Even though he managed to get up early enough to watch the village men go fishing, Lysander was still in no physical shape to get on a boat.",
      "So one of the old men stayed behind to show him the rudiments of knotting a net, and repairing the cone-shaped cages which the fishermen used as traps underwater.",
      "He became so engrossed in his work that the hours passed quickly until the men came back with the best catch they'd had in months.",
      "Lysander ignored the sideways glances he got as the men trooped back to the houses, and the women squabbled over the catch.",
      "As only one or two still had living husbands, dividing it up was not the straightforward matter it had been in the past, and Hypatia frequently had to intervene between them.",
      "Hipparchus came with his share, a large, rather fierce-looking lobster.",
      "Lysander left it up to him to subdue and prepare for the pot.",
      "\"You don't sell your fish?\"",
      "Lysander had spent so many years in the army, he was no longer sure of things worked in small villages, but he was fairly certain he'd heard of fish markets and suchlike.",
      "Hipparchus shrugged.",
      "\"We have had so much loss here, that our catch has not been worth selling.",
      "We are salting and preserving fish for the winter, when it becomes more difficult to make a good catch.",
      "A couple of catches like today's, and perhaps we will not starve this year.",
      "We have some fields on the hills, but very little grows so close to the sea.\"",
      "Lysander noticed that Hipparchus looked at him out of the corner of his eye when he mentioned that day's exceptional catch, but he refused to catch his eye.",
      "What did he, Lysander, know about gods and their whims?",
      "He had worshipped back at his home, more to fit in than anything else.",
      "And soldiers had their own rituals of appeasement, which he'd joined.",
      "Still, he'd never had a sign of otherworldly involvement in his affairs, and he doubted he ever would.",
      "What he'd seen in those weeks with Hyperion had disabused him of the notion of any benevolent deity watching over humans.",
      "He'd had no doubt all those slaughtered women had prayed to Artemis, to Athena, and for what?",
      "But he wasn't prepared to put his thoughts in words.",
      "And yet he knew, despite himself, that something strange was going on.",
      "He found himself unable to forget that last morning, in Hyperion's camp, being woken by the impossible - the smell and sound of the sea.",
      "He should have drowned, but here he was.",
      "And now, his arrival had heralded this bounty.",
      "Was he being courted?",
      "Or was this another cruel joke being played on him?",
      "Would he be greeted with snide laughter, and more torture, before finally being allowed to die?",
      "He realised that he was frozen in place, holding a pot which he had been asked to fill with water at the stream, and flushed.",
      "He glared at Hipparchus, and at the lobster, and stomped off.",
      "He wasn't going to consider this anymore.",
      "Damn gods and their games.",
      "It wasn't worth wasting any more thought on.",
      "The next morning Lysander went on a fishing boat for the very first time.",
      "And after that, it seemed that five years passed in the blink of an eye.",
      "After, he tried hard to remember whether one particular day stood out more than the others, but it never did.",
      "He learned how to fish, and spent his days, spring and summer more than winter, on the fishing boat with Hipparchus, using the nets or the cages, and soon it became second nature for him (as killing used to be, the treacherous part of his brain informed him, the part that hadn't forgotten his actions or forgiven them).",
      "After that first day, any boat Lysander was on got the best catch, mountains of glittering sea bream and bass, lobsters and crayfish almost fighting for the privilege of entering his cages.",
      "Once a swordfish had beached itself on the deck of his boat, and the village had even managed to do some barter for once, with enough corn and oil to last for months.",
      "No",
      "-one had made any more snide remarks about Poseidon and his predilections after that, but the sacrifices to the god were made with more conviction than ever.",
      "Soon he was almost indistinguishable from the other fishermen in the village - the few things which set him apart were his scars, and the fact that he was the only youthful man who never took off his chiton.",
      "A few months after his arrival the young women started showing rounded bellies, and the story circulated that they had already been pregnant when their men had been taken or killed, just not showing yet.",
      "Lysander had turned a sceptical eye on Hipparchus, who just pointed out that without babies, the village would die out.",
      "So what if the babies were born late?",
      "They would have their fathers' names.",
      "Lysander noticed that the old men walked straighter and talked louder, but he shrugged.",
      "Why shouldn't they be proud that they were keeping their village alive?",
      "Where were those who made the rules about legitimacy and so on, where were they now.",
      "He immediately, with some discomfort, flashed back to himself at ten, insulting Theseus for being a bastard.",
      "He couldn't take it back, but at least he could make up for it by turning a blind eye, when any other man would not have.",
      "Besides, what right did he have to judge?",
      "He was only alive through their goodwill, and he wasn't going to do any repopulating any time soon.",
      "Lysander wondered when he'd stopped looking at the hills which led down to the village, waiting for soldiers coming to make him pay for his betrayal.",
      "It never happened, which made him think it never would.",
      "In fact, the attack came from the sea.",
      "If he'd kept count, Lysander would have realised that day was five years to the day he'd arrived in the small fishing village.",
      "But he didn't and when the huge wave swept him off the boat he'd been loading nets and baskets onto, it came as much of a shock to him as it was to the people watching.",
      "Time slowed down to a crawl.",
      "He realised he could understand what one of the men was shouting as he toppled into the sea.",
      "\"It's a hand!",
      "Look, a great hand, made of water!",
      "Look, do you see?\"",
      "Then all he heard was a ringing in his ears, and he knew no more.",
      "For the second time in his life, Lysander woke up expecting to be dead.",
      "And for the second time in his life, he was alive.",
      "But this time, he wasn't on a sunny beach.",
      "He was in some sort of cave, which seemed to be underwater.",
      "Half of it was covered in water, like a shallow lagoon, but it was not sand which covered the bottom... he could hardly believe his eyes, and had to touch the smooth surface before he accepted that the floor was covered in mother-of pearl.",
      "The ceiling was even stranger - it glowed, but not like phosphorescent algae or moss, but like a warm fire.",
      "Squinting at it, he realised it was amber - a king's ransom of amber, and it covered the cave.",
      "The water was warm, and everything was smooth and beautiful, and it didn't smell damp or stifling, but salty.",
      "He looked around him and realised that there was a man sitting in the corner, watching him closely.",
      "At first he thought it was an old man, sitting on a chair, holding his staff.",
      "\"Who are you?\" Lysander's voice was low and hoarse, and his throat burned terribly from the salt water he'd swallowed.",
      "The man got up suddenly, and he no longer seemed old but was young and beautiful (and very naked, his mind-voice gulped), and his staff slammed down into the rock which flowed and hardened around it, and it was no longer a staff, but a trident.",
      "\"Take a wild guess,\" Poseidon replied, for of course it was the god himself.",
      "Lysander closed his eyes tightly and opened them, certain he was dreaming.",
      "Nothing had changed.",
      "He was still in this strange but beautiful cave, being watched by the god of the sea in his guise of a handsome young man, pale, with short dark hair and flashing bright eyes.",
      "The god smiled at him; a half-smile, and Lysander wondered whether this was it, this was when his punishment would come.",
      "The thoughts thronged in his head - what form would it take, and why had the god waited so long, and why had he prepared Lysander for divine retribution by... showering him with riches... and waiting for him to, at least partly, recover from his experiences.",
      "That didn't quite add up.",
      "When he looked up again, Poseidon was shaking his head and smiling, more openly this time.",
      "\"I don't want to punish you, Lysander.",
      "Not unless that gives you pleasure,\" he continued, and his smile grew a little more wicked than before.",
      "Poseidon knelt down next to him, grasped his shoulders, and before he knew it Lysander was being kissed by a god.",
      "He opened his mouth, reflexively, and Poseidon's tongue delved in his mouth, opening him up, and the pleasure was almost blinding.",
      "Lysander responded, losing himself in the kiss and the various caresses Poseidon gave him.",
      "As Poseidon's fingers passed over his ruined groin and his scarred face, Lysander tried to shy back, ashamed of his deformities.",
      "\"Shh,\" Poseidon whispered, gentling him.",
      "He grinned, looking sly.",
      "\"Look what I can do!\"",
      "He caressed Lysander all over, using sea water and sand to rub him gently, and wherever his fingers rested, Lysander could feel himself being healed.",
      "Finally Poseidon stroked his face, leaving cool fire in his fingers' wake, so that Lysander knew that the horrible scars were gone.",
      "He could feel his cock stirring, something he hadn't felt in over five years, and blushed at the thought of being so exposed to the god.",
      "Poseidon just laughed, and kissed him again, pulling him out of the shallow water towards a bed Lysander hadn't seen before.",
      "The sheets were warm, soft and smooth, and rubbed tantalizingly against his newly healed skin as Poseidon drove deep into his mouth with his tongue, and used his fingers to open up his ass.",
      "He flinched at this - he couldn't help it.",
      "Memories rushed back, of the monstrous men rutting in him as he screamed and begged, all those years ago.",
      "Poseidon's eyes filled with sadness, and he kissed Lysander's eyes, and mouth, and stopped his caresses.",
      "Lysander rushed to apologize - he hadn't meant to offend, it was just- \"I understand - I can see it, all of it, and it was dreadful.",
      "Will you allow me to heal you there, too?\"",
      "Lysander was afraid, but he nodded, and when Poseidon breached him, it was nothing but pleasure.",
      "Poseidon fucked him for hours, it seemed, bringing him to orgasm over and over as he lay there, helplessly stretched around the god's cock, until Poseidon spent in him, and stayed in him, his cock filling and stretching Lysander until he thought he would die of pleasure.",
      "He'd never thought he'd be able to bear a man's touch again, but he did more than bear it.",
      "He yelled in ecstasy at every stroke, at every thrust, he rode and was ridden, he pleasured the god with his ass, his hands and his mouth, for hours, or days, Lysander never really could tell.",
      "Poseidon realized Lysander needed food and drink, and so they paused, and the god would feed Lysander things sweet and savoury, wine and water, but could never keep his hands off Lysander for long before he flipped him over and entered him, a bit rougher now.",
      "Lysander had lost his fear though.",
      "He was drowning in pleasure, and the thought suddenly came to him that he would not be sad if he died like this.",
      "\"Oh, no. You're not getting away from me that fast.\"",
      "Poseidon spoke between thrusts, his balls slapping against Lysander's ass, and he quickly reached around to grab Lysander's cock, hard as it always was in that cave.",
      "Lysander laughed, between gasps, and moans, and came again.",
      "And again.",
      "(See the end of the chapter for notes.)",
      "\"I don't understand - why me?",
      "Why spare my life, when so many died?\"",
      "Lysander wants to stop himself from being so sharp with the powerful immortal who could crush him like an ant.",
      "He's not so sure that this dream accurately conveys what really happened in the cave.",
      "Perhaps it conveys what he was thinking, even as he lost himself in the bliss of the god's embrace, or the thoughts which would come to him afterwards, as he asked himself the same question.",
      "Nevertheless, in the dream Poseidon says nothing, just smiles enigmatically, and continues caressing Lysander, who gasps at every touch, knowing that this feeling, at least, mirrored reality.",
      "Lysander hears a sound behind him.",
      "Was that a... hiss?",
      "He turns, only to see three women bearing down on him, limbs entwined with snakes, and as the first woman's whip strikes him across the face, he wakes up.",
      "Lysander woke up with a gasp.",
      "He touched his face, gingerly, but there was no lash-mark.",
      "It had been a dream, one which he still occasionally had, even though some years had passed since Lysander met the great god Poseidon in an underwater cave.",
      "He had been awoken by Hipparchus tapping his shoulder, and as he looked out of the doorway he saw that it was a couple of hours before sunrise.",
      "Hipparchus was preparing some barley bread and a skin of diluted wine to take on the boat, and Lysander got up, glad that the dream had been interrupted before the goddesses took him apart.",
      "In his waking hours Lysander remembered the specifics of his hours, or even days in the cave, but in dreams his fears took over and added nightmarish elements - the presence of the Erinyes being just one of several.",
      "Being awake always dissipated his fears, and he remembered instead the wonderful reality, in which he, Lysander, traitor and murderer, was loved and revered by a god.",
      "He remembered the passion with which Poseidon kissed him, the heights of ecstasy brought about by his touch, and the heat of their love-making, the memories of which still excited him.",
      "At some point they had also talked.",
      "Lysander had mentioned that he'd been afraid of Poseidon's divine punishment, at which the god laughed, and proceeded to kiss him until his ears rang.",
      "Poseidon had tried to reassure him that no immortal beings were hunting him, even when Lysander revealed the chilling fear which had preoccupied him for a while, which he hadn't even wanted to admit to himself.",
      "\"In my old village, we often spoke of... the Kindly Ones...\" Lysander's voice had cracked at that point - he knew that he had done things which ensured their attention many times over.",
      "Their curse would follow him for the rest of his life, and nothing he did or said would appease them.",
      "Poseidon had shushed him, stroking his hair like he was a child, and he remembered wanting to hide in his arms, forever, if need be.",
      "\"Don't worry about them - they have so much retribution to seek, they will be glutted before they even think about you.",
      "Besides, you are atoning for your sins, here.",
      "Aren't you?\"",
      "Lysander thought about it.",
      "He supposed that the arrogance and pride of his previous life had been taken from him (in ways he didn't want to remember), and living a humble life might be regarded as a form of atonement.",
      "But would it be seen as such by three angry and vengeful goddesses?",
      "Not vengeful, he corrected himself hurriedly.",
      "They brought justice, that's what he'd meant.",
      "You never knew who might be listening.",
      "\"Besides, no-one may harm you.\"",
      "Poseidon looked quite stern at this point.",
      "\"Do you know why?\" Lysander wasn't sure, not completely, but he decided to make a leap of faith.",
      "\"I belong to you.",
      "I am yours.\"",
      "Poseidon's brilliant smile lit up the dim cave, and the rest of his words were spoken into Lysander's mouth.",
      "And so Lysander accepted these feelings, which had been alien to him in the past: of belonging, of being wanted, being treasured, being loved.",
      "This strange bliss sustained Lysander through the dream-like voyage back through the sea to the fishing village, through the amazed and shocked reactions to his transformation, and was with him even now, as he prepared for the daily work that had become an intrinsic part of his life.",
      "It hadn't changed much, even after he had come back to the village superficially a new man.",
      "No",
      "-one except for Hipparchus knew that his facial wounds weren't the only ones that had been healed.",
      "He had been known for his modesty and shame, so he felt no impulse to change that now.",
      "Unlike in his dreams, in which his idyll with Poseidon was cut short by his intrusive fears, the reality had been interrupted in a different way.",
      "He was still saddened when he remembered Poseidon telling him that he did not think they could meet again, in the near future.",
      "\"Lord Zeus is being... difficult.",
      "We can no longer interact with mortals as we once did.\"",
      "Lysander smiled as he recalled deciding to take what he could in the time they had left, and pulling Poseidon's head down to his for a last kiss, which turned into many kisses, and more besides.",
      "He smiled again, sitting on the boat, mending his nets.",
      "Maybe one day he would see Poseidon again - until then, his memories would sustain him.",
      "In the years that had passed, young men had started appearing in the village, after travelling market-traders had spread the word that there was a living to be made in a small village with many widows.",
      "The only drawback was that Lysander did not exactly fit in this picture, having no wife or family to call his own.",
      "Once his scars were gone, the young men only saw another rival, and at times it was hard for Lysander to persuade them that he had no interest in any woman, or man for that matter.",
      "Often it took two or three visits from the village elders to persuade the incomers that whatever mystery lay in Lysander's past (which was never talked about, no matter how insistent the incomers became) or present, the fact remained that the village had never been so prosperous in human memory.",
      "And that forcing Lysander to leave would be a very bad idea, for everyone.",
      "Most of the young men had no objections to this situation.",
      "Soon, children of their own were born, strengthening their ties to the strange little village which had survived while so many others had been destroyed by the madness of King Hyperion.",
      "These men saw Lysander's kindness to Hipparchus, a frail old man who he treated like a father, they saw how he worked harder than anyone else, how he was courteous to everyone, and seemed in some way thankful; for what, in particular, it was never made clear.",
      "His only strangeness was his devotion to the old statue of the god in the inlet, which he visited every day, with sacrifices and prayers.",
      "And that was not so strange, in a fishing village.",
      "And so the incomers looked to their own families, deciding that one strange man in an entire village was not so terrible, after all.",
      "One man, however, would not be persuaded.",
      "Kopris felt that he had somehow been cheated of what he had been promised; by whom, he could not say.",
      "To him, his wife was not the most attractive in the village; her young son disliked him on sight, and worst of all, after a year, she had never quickened with his own child.",
      "To the others, Lysander among them, he just seemed as sullen as he had been since he first came to their village.",
      "He did not confide in his wife, as he was used to the company of men.",
      "He could not confide in the other men, his age mates, who were content with their lot.",
      "He could not talk to the village elders who, he had been made to understand, had suffered greatly in the past, and who would not be interested in his discontent.",
      "And so the feelings of frustration and resentment grew inside him until the day came once more when their fish was to be taken to market by mule-cart.",
      "The town was a few days from the village, but the fish would keep, having been dried or salted down.",
      "Kopris offered to make the journey, the first time he had done so, and even though she did not show it, his wife dared to hope that he was finally getting used to life in their village.",
      "A week later, Lysander saw a young boy setting out for the hills, following the village goats, who knew the way to their favourite grazing ground, and were eager to get there.",
      "The boy could barely keep up with them, and as he hurried up the rocky path, he had a wave and a smile for Lysander, who waved back.",
      "As Lysander walked towards the quay, he saw the boy's mother standing in her doorway, looking anxiously after her son as he went in the direction she'd hoped her husband would be coming from.",
      "Lysander nodded at her and she seemed to need to make some form of conversation.",
      "\"His step-father should be back today.\"",
      "She sounded worried.",
      "In fact, her husband was a few days overdue, and Lysander hoped that the other women had not filled her ears with gossip.",
      "The old men had been doing enough of that, with more than one remarking, in Lysander's earshot, that maybe Kopris had simply sold the fish instead of bartering and had walked away with their one mule and cart.",
      "He tried to smile in a reassuring manner, conscious of the fact that there were probably more eyes on him than he could see, whose owners would be all too happy to tell her husband, when he came back, that \"handsome Lysander\" had been smiling and chatting with his wife.",
      "Even though he felt ungrateful when he had such thoughts, he sometimes wished Poseidon had left him his facial scarring.",
      "No",
      "-one besides Hipparchus really understood why he hadn't tried for a wife after his return from the cave, and perhaps Lysander didn't really understand it himself.",
      "Poseidon hadn't forbidden him a wife, or even a lover, but Lysander didn't want anyone else.",
      "Those hours in the cave had filled him with such contentment and joy that he only had to think back on them to feel happy again.",
      "And when the loneliness became too much, he tended to the statue and looked out to sea, hoping against hope to see a merry face looking back at him.",
      "He swam sometimes, when they weren't fishing, enjoying the feelings of buoyancy and freedom, and if he sometimes thought he heard a voice saying, \"Wait for me\", he wasn't telling anyone.",
      "Lysander marshalled his thoughts.",
      "\"I'm sure he will be.\"",
      "He smiled again.",
      "\"His delay is probably a result of his mastery of haggling, to get the most goods for our fish!\"",
      "Ianthe smiled back at him, happier now.",
      "\"I sent Eryx with the goats - maybe he will meet his st- his father on the way!\"",
      "She sounded so hopeful that Lysander just nodded and went on his way.",
      "He was careful to avoid showing his real thoughts - that if the boy Eryx met his step-father on the way home there would be no happy conversation, but only dark thoughts and sullen sniping.",
      "The elders were not happy with Kopris, but felt they could not interfere as nothing overt had occurred.",
      "Lysander wished he could take it on himself to tell the man to count his blessings, to adapt or leave, but who was he to take such an action?",
      "He had not been born in the village, and this simple fact would make him an incomer, a virtual stranger, for a very long time.",
      "They would not go fishing that day - there were high clouds in the distance and being unsure of the weather, devoted the day to repairing their nets.",
      "Long afterwards, Lysander would believe that the god had been watching over him even then.",
      "For at about midday, hours before the boy should have returned from the pastureland, a strange commotion drew the fishermen to the other end of the village, where they witnessed a bizarre scene.",
      "Lysander watched in horror as Eryx, carrying the lead goat in his arms, slipped and slid down the rocky path, with all the other goats bleating worriedly and following.",
      "He was out of breath, and struggled to speak, but one word was terrifyingly clear.",
      "\"Soldiers!\"",
      "Lysander felt a sudden jerk under his feet, as if the world had moved sideways and then righted itself again.",
      "He tried to speak, but his mouth felt dry, and he was afraid that if he opened his mouth again only a croak would come out.",
      "He looked around him, willing someone to take over, to take charge, but all eyes were on him, some accusatory, others pleading.",
      "Ianthe pushed her way through the crowd, and once again Lysander felt horrified, this time at the thought of common soldiers, and what they would do to women who walked unveiled in the street, fearless.",
      "\"Did you not meet your father on the way?\"",
      "The boy answered her with a defiant look.",
      "\"He is not my father!\"",
      "He relented at her pleading look and continued.",
      "\"He is with them, the soldiers, I mean.",
      "He is driving the cart, and he talks and laughs with them.",
      "I think-\" Here Eryx hesitated.",
      "He exchanged looks with Lysander, who gave him a little nod.",
      "The time for kind lies had passed.",
      "Kopris had betrayed them all, and if they were to survive the day, they would have to show a united front.",
      "Kopris was one of them no longer.",
      "The boy cleared his throat.",
      "\"I think he brought them here.",
      "He pointed towards the wider path.",
      "I only arrived before them because I took the goat path.",
      "They are just behind that ridge.\"",
      "Everyone turned to look in that direction, as if they hadn't seen the ridge every day of their lives.",
      "Lysander realised that he had to do something, or else they would all stand there, frozen like puppets, occasionally jerking from side to side, unable to act, until the soldiers rode down into the village.",
      "He noticed that Hypatia had hurried up to them, drawn by the commotion, and she must have heard the boy's words.",
      "\"Hypatia, Ianthe, gather the women and children, and take them to-\" He wasn't even sure what he was going to say next.",
      "Was there even time to get to the caves?",
      "\"We won't get to the caves in time,\" Hypatia interrupted.",
      "\"But will they be out of sight?",
      "I can try to keep their attention here, for a while.",
      "It's me they want, anyway.\"",
      "Lysander tried to keep any hint of self-pity out of his voice.",
      "These people did not deserve the wrath that was headed his way.",
      "He, on the other hand, did.",
      "\"They can't have you!\"",
      "Lysander sighed.",
      "Hipparchus had been ill, that winter, and had not fully recovered.",
      "He spent most of his days lying in the shade, looking out to sea, waiting for Lysander to return.",
      "He'd hoped Hipparchus had been sleeping so deeply that he hadn't noticed the commotion, but that was not to be.",
      "He noticed that Hypatia had taken the opportunity to run off, dragging a protesting Ianthe along, followed by Eryx, who was still carrying the lead goat.",
      "He hoped she'd know to take the hill-paths, behind the statue of the god.",
      "Even if the women and children didn't reach the caves by the time the soldiers arrived, they'd be out of sight.",
      "Hipparchus was leaning heavily on the staff he'd started to use recently.",
      "All the other elders avoided his angry looks - they were clearly not prepared to sacrifice themselves for someone who was, essentially, a stranger to them.",
      "It would take more than the odd decade for Lysander to be part of the village, something he knew very well.",
      "The other young men milled around uncertainly.",
      "Separated from their wives and children, they were clearly unsure of what, if anything, they should contribute.",
      "Lysander had kept his eyes on the one who clearly felt he should lead, and who seemed to be working himself up to suggest that Lysander should be offered up to the soldiers.",
      "Seeing as that was Lysander's own intention, he just wanted to say it himself, as Hipparchus was clearly going to attack anyone who even hinted at this solution.",
      "As he'd been having coughing fits since his illness, something which had been worrying Lysander more than he cared to admit, he was afraid that any outburst would set Hipparchus off again.",
      "\"Hipparchus, you must let me speak with them.\"",
      "Lysander took the old man by the shoulders and shook him, gently.",
      "Hipparchus had tears in his eyes, but blinked fiercely, unwilling to let them fall.",
      "\"They will kill you!\"",
      "\"Am I not worth the village?",
      "Had I not come here, you wouldn't be in danger.\"",
      "\"Had you not come here, we would have starved to death that winter!\"",
      "Hipparchus still sounded angry, but he'd started to look resigned, too.",
      "Lysander knew he wasn't stupid or senile, and there was no other way this could go.",
      "He only hoped the soldiers would take him and leave the village untouched.",
      "He wasn't sure whether Kopris knew about the caves, though.",
      "It was as good a time as any to pray, and he wished he was closer to the sea, as he prayed desperately that Ianthe hadn't been so trusting as to tell her husband about the village's most important secret.",
      "Lysander himself did not trust in the good nature of soldiers.",
      "He should know, he'd been one once.",
      "As though his very thoughts had called them into being, the first soldiers crested over the ridge.",
      "They were mostly infantry, with a mounted Regiment commander.",
      "One of the hoplites was walking the commander's spare horses, and the others were marching along Kopris's cart, chatting with him, happy of the slow pace.",
      "Lysander could not recognize the commander under his helmet, but he had no doubt he would.",
      "Why else would he bring fifty soldiers to a poor fishing village?",
      "This was someone whose brother, whose father he had wronged, and it was time to pay for his crimes.",
      "Hipparchus tried one last time.",
      "\"Hide, Lysander - they have no reason to attack us!\"",
      "\"They will have reason - you have given me refuge all these years.",
      "Best you tell them you knew nothing.\"",
      "Lysander sighed, struck by a sudden thought - he should have died during the battle.",
      "These people did not deserve such a punishment.",
      "He thought again of Poseidon, and wished he had a way of asking the god to protect his people, but there was no time.",
      "The soldiers had arrived.",
      "Lysander took a few steps forward, trying to separate himself from the rest of the villagers.",
      "He noticed, from the corner of his eyes, that some of the men had brought rakes and scythes, hammers, chisels and other implements.",
      "He sighed, inwardly - the soldiers would mow them down within seconds.",
      "It must not come to this, he decided, and walked, trying to seem calm, towards the soldiers.",
      "The regiment commander stopped in front of Lysander and dismounted, taking off his helmet.",
      "Lysander did not recognize the man, but it had been almost a decade.",
      "He swallowed, nervously.",
      "\"I am Lysander,\" he said.",
      "\"You betrayed your village.",
      "You brought soldiers there.",
      "You joined Hyperion's army.\"",
      "\"Yes.\"",
      "Lysander could hear protesting begin behind him.",
      "The elders had changed their minds, it seemed, and were listing the things he had done for the village, the way he had helped them with no expectation of reward except food and a place to sleep.",
      "The hoplites started moving towards them and Lysander grew desperate.",
      "\"No! I am here, take me - they have done nothing, I deserve your wrath, but not them.\"",
      "The commander gave him a contemptuous look, strode forward and delivered a backhand that sent Lysander to his knees on the stony ground.",
      "He grabbed Lysander by the hair and pulled his head back, studying his face.",
      "\"Where are Hyperion's marks?",
      "You are as I remember, only older.",
      "How is it that you are unblemished, while all the others that we killed had been turned into horrors?\" \"Sorcery!",
      "Evil magics!\"",
      "Lysander wished, not for the first time, that they had turned Kopris away when he'd first come to their village.",
      "The commander pushed him face down into the ground.",
      "Lysander's lip was bleeding, and as he lay there, staring at the sand which was soaking up his blood, it seemed to him that the last years had been a fever dream, and he was there again, at Hyperion's last battle, waiting for the Minotaurs to finish him off.",
      "When he tried to get up, a foot landed on his neck and kept him in place.",
      "\"You promised me!",
      "You promised I could have the pick of any woman.\"",
      "Would that son of a dog not be quiet, Lysander thought.",
      "It seemed the commander shared his opinion, if not enough to spare the villagers.",
      "\"Enough, cur!",
      "You will get your reward soon enough.\"",
      "Lysander could hear scuffling close by, and a few slaps as the hoplites kept the villagers in check, but at least no-one had drawn swords.",
      "Yet, his treacherous mind supplied.",
      "Who knew what they would do to give Kopris his 'reward'?",
      "And yet, he could feel something strange happening under him, pinned to the ground as he was.",
      "Had there been... a rumble?",
      "Movement?",
      "\"You two, tie his hands and put him in the cart.\"",
      "Lysander stumbled as he was pulled upright and held firmly in between two hulking foot-soldiers.",
      "Kopris's protests were loud and immediate, and through the sand in his eyes he could see the contempt in the commander's face.",
      "\"Did you think you were going to stay here with her, whatever mangy bitch you chose?",
      "Go and pick your woman, fool.\"",
      "\"No!\"",
      "Lysander knew he was just adding to the beating he was going to get very soon, but he couldn't stop himself.",
      "\"They have done nothing wrong, spare them!\"",
      "The commander made a sign for the hoplites to hold him steady, and punched Lysander in the stomach.",
      "As he doubled over in pain, one of the men pulled his head up by the hair, and the commander elbowed him in the face.",
      "As he coughed and retched, more droplets of blood hit the sand.",
      "\"No one will be harmed, and whatever woman he chooses will soon become accustomed to her lot.",
      "Is it not a small price to pay for remaining unscathed after harbouring such a monster, one woman?\" Lysander could see the commander's smirk through the blurring in his eyes, even as he realised that he was the monster being referred to.",
      "It had been a long time since he thought of himself as a monster.",
      "The commander moved closer and murmured into Lysander's ear.",
      "\"We still have those bulls your King used to discipline men in.",
      "Your last hours, maybe even days, will be spent in one of them.",
      "A fitting punishment, don't you think?\"",
      "Lysander looked past him, trying not to show the panic and horror caused by the commander's word, and found that he could see Kopris striding confidently into the village, sure, by his gait, that he would soon be dragging his reward out by the hair, if necessary.",
      "Except Kopris stumbled.",
      "Which didn't seem strange to Lysander - the small stones on the path were tricky enough, even for the sure-footed.",
      "But then the other villagers started to move, as well as the cart, and Lysander, and the soldiers holding him back.",
      "The earth was shaking, and as if terrified by that fact, the commander's three horses lost their minds.",
      "The most magnificent one, a big grey, pulled free of the soldier holding the reins and reared up, lashing out madly with its hooves, landing a couple of blows that would surely have killed the soldier if not for his helmet.",
      "\"It is the god!",
      "You will all be punished for what you have done!\"",
      "Lysander was glad to hear that Hipparchus had not been in any way intimidated by the soldiers, even though a soldier immediately turned around and punched him to the ground.",
      "Lysander felt a sudden wave of rage crash over him, and he struggled like a madman.",
      "\"Leave him alone!",
      "He could be your grandfather!\"",
      "The ground had stopped rumbling, but the horses were still stamping, and the big grey kept everyone a fair distance away.",
      "Which was why everyone, except Lysander and the commander, missed the enormous figure striding out of the sea, wielding a trident many feet high, and bringing with him a wall of water which crashed over houses and men alike, but somehow only swept the soldiers off their feet, leaving the villagers unharmed.",
      "The soldier who had hit Hipparchus landed badly on one arm, and even Lysander winced as he heard the crack.",
      "But all noise was drowned out when Poseidon spoke.",
      "\"WHO DARES?",
      "WHO DARES?\"",
      "The voice was so loud Lysander could feel it reverberate in his bones.",
      "The only soldiers still on their feet covered their ears and sank to the ground, in fear as well as pain.",
      "Kopris became mad with terror, and tried to run to his cart, but a wave lifted him bodily to a height of twenty feet and dashed him to the ground, where he lay still.",
      "The commander stood his ground, Lysander gave him that.",
      "His grip on Lysander's arm tightened, and if he shook a little, Lysander understood that being faced with such power for the first time was a chastening experience.",
      "The huge head turned to him, and one enormous eye closed and opened again.",
      "Lysander had to stop himself from smiling back, but thankfully no-one else seemed to have noticed the furious sea-god winking at him.",
      "\"Lord, we did not know he was under your protection-\" the commander began.",
      "His voice was as steady as could be expected, under the circumstances, but Poseidon was not mollified.",
      "\"RELEASE HIM!\"",
      "The words were so loud Lysander imagined they were written across the sky in huge granite blocks.",
      "The soldiers still on each side of him immediately let him go, even though their commander had given no such order.",
      "\"This village is under my protection!",
      "None shall harm whoever resides here!",
      "None shall harm what is MINE!\"",
      "The last word forced them to their knees again.",
      "\"But lord, he is a traitor, and a murderer!\"",
      "Lysander was starting to admire this commander, in spite of his intense desire to end his life.",
      "He wondered, sadly, which of the commander's relatives he'd betrayed.",
      "The huge figure turned to them and said no more, but the commander seemed to hear something, as he winced, as if the sounds in his head were too loud to be borne.",
      "He looked at his men meaningfully, and they all started moving towards him, leaving the villagers where they stood, or lay.",
      "The horses had calmed down, and the commander quietly instructed some men to take their reins, except for the big grey, which he would ride.",
      "About to swing himself into the saddle, the commander hesitated, as his hand gripped the horse's mane, and tightened convulsively.",
      "He looked up into Poseidon's face.",
      "The god inclined his head graciously, and Lysander didn't know what it meant, only that the commander understood and nodded.",
      "He swung himself into the saddle, patting the horse's neck.",
      "It suddenly dawned on Lysander that the commander had been asking whether a sacrifice was necessary - it obviously was not, and Lysander was glad of that.",
      "He wanted no living creature to die for his sake.",
      "The soldiers left the village at a quick trot, and soon the only people in sight were the villagers, and Lysander.",
      "And of course Poseidon, legs like enormous tree-trunks, sea-weed entwined around his limbs, eyes staring into the distant horizon.",
      "Lysander looked up and that huge bearded face smiled down at him, an enormous hand reaching down, a thumb passing over his face and healing his cut lip, his grazed scalp.",
      "A moan from the group of elders distracted him from Poseidon's hypnotic gaze, and he realized that they were clustered around the fallen figure of Hipparchus, who lay where he had fallen when the soldier punched him.",
      "Lysander raced to his side, and one of the other old men turned to him.",
      "\"I think a rib might be broken.",
      "Bastard didn't have to hit him that hard.\"",
      "Before Lysander could do anything, the gasps from the crowd alerted him to Poseidon's approach.",
      "Well, not really an approach, he told himself.",
      "Poseidon only had to turn and reach down, and his hand passed gently over the old man's chest, healing as it went.",
      "As Lysander watched, the old man took one deep breath, and then another, with more confidence - he nodded at Lysander, who, for the first time that day, gave in to his emotions and crushed Hipparchus to his chest.",
      "\"Come, come,\" Hipparchus said, patting him on the shoulder awkwardly.",
      "\"We are alive and well, no harm done.\"",
      "But his eyes shone too, and his hands shook.",
      "Lysander helped him to his feet, and the villagers started moving away from him, muttering something about seeing to the nets, even though no-one had been fishing, that day.",
      "One of them glanced at Lysander and then looked upwards, as if to remind him of something he'd forgotten.",
      "Or someone.",
      "Oh, yes.",
      "Poseidon was still standing there, like a huge statue.",
      "Only his head moved, as he looked over the ridge where the soldiers could probably still be seen, from his vantage point.",
      "Poseidon looked down at him, and his eyes became kind again.",
      "\"Follow me.",
      "We need to converse.\"",
      "Poseidon's voice did not boom so loud anymore - it was more like a rumble of distant thunder.",
      "His steps were huge as he strode towards his statue in the inlet, but he seemed to diminish with every step, until, waiting for Lysander in the small cove, was the merry youth who had greeted him in the cave.",
      "Lysander had passed the villagers who were gathered in groups discussing what had happened, except for the young husbands who'd gone to the caves to tell the women the danger was over.",
      "They'd had to draw lots to decide who to leave behind to bury Kopris.",
      "It was not fair to leave such an onerous duty to his wife, who had been as much fooled and cast aside as the rest of them.",
      "The elders were the only ones to greet Lysander and meet his eyes - he guessed it was because the younger men were eager to forget all that had occurred, and would simply remember that a lucky earthquake and high tide had saved them from destruction.",
      "They would sacrifice to Poseidon in thanks, but would prefer to forget about sixty-foot gods striding out of the sea.",
      "As he hurried towards the inlet, he had to run a gauntlet of backslapping and praise.",
      "One of the old men had had a couple of amphorae of wine hidden away, and a cup was pressed into his hand as he hurried along.",
      "He was glad of it - he hadn't liked the look in Poseidon's eyes as he stared after the soldiers and their commander, and maybe an offering of wine would placate him for a while.",
      "And also an offering of his body, though Lysander's honesty won out here - he'd missed the god, and after almost dying he wanted so badly to feel Poseidon's arms around him.",
      "As he splashed into the inlet, he was immediately enveloped in Poseidon's embrace, the cup was taken from his nerveless fingers and put into a concave depression, and he was summarily stripped and kissed breathless.",
      "\"They would have killed you, they would have taken you from me...\" Lysander's ears rang from lack of breath, but he heard what Poseidon said between frantic kisses.",
      "He stroked the lustrous curls and kissed the god back.",
      "\"But you saved me - you saved everyone-\" \"They dared touch you, touch this village,\" Poseidon interrupted, enraged again.",
      "His moods were as mercurial as the weather out at sea, Lysander thought.",
      "\"I will curse them!\"",
      "\"My love,\" Lysander answered, feeling very daring.",
      "\"Please spare them.\"",
      "He knew he could not say 'no' to the sea-god, but perhaps a request would do.",
      "\"Why do you plead for them? \"",
      "There was genuine puzzlement on Poseidon's features, and Lysander struggled to come up with a way to explain himself to such a powerful being.",
      "They are simple mortals, he wanted to say, they see injustice and think revenge will make them feel better.",
      "Yes, they wanted to kill me horribly, but these were the lessons Hyperion taught them - that mortals needed to make their own justice, and not rely on the gods anymore.",
      "That mortals could be as capricious and thoughtless as the gods, and cause as much pain.",
      "Though Lysander knew he could not utter the last thought.",
      "He did love Poseidon, after all.",
      "\"I am safe, in your arms.\"",
      "He punctuated his words with kisses, knowing that Poseidon would not resist him.",
      "\"The village is safe.",
      "They will not return.",
      "And we will be more careful about who we admit in the future.\"",
      "Lysander was determined to accomplish this by involving himself with the elders, in the days to come.",
      "They would not have to go through this again, with different soldiers, and another commander that he'd wronged in his past.",
      "\"I was almost too late,\" Poseidon insisted.",
      "Lysander smiled, fondly.",
      "\"You would have been able to find me anywhere.\"",
      "\"Well, yes,\" he admitted.",
      "\"But rage fills me when I think of their hands on you.\"",
      "\"How did you know, anyway?\"",
      "Lysander was still puzzled about this.",
      "Poseidon looked shaken, as much as an immortal being could.",
      "\"Your blood hit the stones - the very bones of the earth called out to me, telling me to save my love.\"",
      "Poseidon declaimed happily, and Lysander smiled at his joy.",
      "So dramatic, his divine lover.",
      "\"There is something you wish to ask me; I can see it in your eyes.\"",
      "Lysander played for time by grasping the cup of wine and offering it to Poseidon.",
      "The god smiled at him wickedly, and poured the wine over his chest, where he proceeded to lick it off, paying special attention to Lysander's nipples, which were soon as erect as other parts of his body.",
      "Between gasps of pleasure and deep kisses it was difficult to keep his question in mind, and soon Lysander was simply lost in ecstasy.",
      "At one point, he protested that surely the women and children would be able to see them as they came back from the caves.",
      "\"I will envelop us in a glamour,\" Poseidon said grandly, \"and hide us from their sight.\"",
      "The deep kisses continued, and soon Poseidon was caressing him in more intimate ways.",
      "\"Will you really hide us?\" \"No.",
      "They need to learn who you belong to.\"",
      "The god smirked, and turned Lysander onto his stomach.",
      "He sighed, pillowing his head on his folded arms, and let himself be lost in pleasure.",
      "Hours later, they were lying side by side on the warm rocks, which were still heated from the afternoon sun.",
      "The promised storm had not arrived, and the air was comfortable enough to dry them off.",
      "Lysander ached pleasantly from their exertions, and had almost forgotten the unpleasant events earlier that day.",
      "Poseidon was dropping soft kisses on his neck, nipping gently at his lips from time to time, when he pulled back and stared into Lysander's eyes.",
      "\"Ask your question.\"",
      "Lysander knew what he meant.",
      "\"What did you say to the commander, when he called me a traitor and a murderer?\"",
      "\"How do you know I said anything?\"",
      "\"He did not seem the kind of man to leave without an answer, even if he was being told to do so by a god.\"",
      "Poseidon stroked Lysander's hair as he replied, perhaps to take the sharp edge off his words.",
      "\"I showed him your suffering.",
      "I showed what Hyperion did to you.",
      "I told him what would be your punishment here.\"",
      "\"Which is?\" Poseidon wouldn't meet his eyes at first, but then looked deep into them as he continued.",
      "\"You live here, far away from the citadels of power, in a small forgotten village, as a poor fisherman, who once was a soldier.",
      "There will be no great feats here, or quests, just daily hard labour until the day you die.\"",
      "Here Poseidon paused, and seemed to consider his words as he went on.",
      "\"There will be no wife for you, no children, no sons.",
      "Your line ends with you.",
      "But...",
      "I did not tell him that you are my beloved, and that I will always be by your side.\"",
      "Lysander grinned so wide his face was aching.",
      "\"My love,\" he gasped, and could not stop himself from grabbing the god's face and kissing him deeply.",
      "Poseidon laughed in between kisses, praising what he called Lysander's new found confidence.",
      "\"Where is that shy boy I seduced in an underwater cavern?\"",
      "He laughed merrily, and pulled Lysander on top of him.",
      "Lysander smiled and kissed his way down Poseidon's chest, and then up again to his lips.",
      "\"Will you truly be by my side till the day I die?\"",
      "Lysander wondered at his own daring, asking such a thing of an immortal being.",
      "Poseidon nibbled at his ear and whispered.",
      "\"And beyond, love.",
      "I will not let you go.",
      "Resign yourself to being mine, forever.\"",
      "And so Lysander did.",
      "And one day, perhaps, after many years had passed, Lysander went to sleep for the last time, and woke up in a field of flowers with the sea shining in the distance, and a familiar figure waiting for him on the distant shore.",
      "The Erinyes, which means The Kindly Ones, was what ancient Greeks called The Furies - the three goddesses of vengeance and retribution, punishing murderers in various ways.",
      "I belong to the school of thought which believes that they were called 'Kindly' as a form of self-defence - to call them by their true name would risk bringing their wrath down on you.",
      "Poseidon, as well as being the god of the sea, was also the god of earthquakes.",
      "One of the animals associated with him was the horse."

    "text": "(See the end of the chapter for notes.) Once upon a time, a rich man named Tywin lived in a great house by the sea. He called his house a castle and likened himself to a lion, but all that did was make him so widely disliked that no one, rich or poor, in that duchy or the next, would allow Tywin to court their daughters. The lion's heart, never soft to begin with, hardened against his fellow men and their womenfolk. One day, while hunting in the forest, Tywin's hounds found a hidden pool. He saw a beautiful woman bathing in it. She had hair tawny as a lion's mane and eyes the green of spring leaves. Her name was Joanna, and she was unashamed before his scrutiny, completely free in her naked skin. She had no money or lands, but she was mercifully free of meddlesome male relatives. So Tywin asked for her hand in marriage, and she accepted. Her one condition was that Tywin must not enter her chamber on one day of the week. Amused by a woman's fancies and eager to wed her, Tywin accepted. For seven years they were happy. Joanna bore Tywin two children. Twins, a boy and a girl. They had their mother's wild beauty, their father's proud temper, and were much loved and coddled. But a doubt kept gnawing on Tywin's heart. He did not meet or care for many people outside of his family, and so did not understand that contentment in marriage and still feeling love for his wife after seven years were not gifts to be put aside lightly. He kept wondering what his wife did on the one day every week she spent shut up in her chamber. One day he could bear the gnawing feeling in his chest no more. He found his wife's door unlocked and, not pausing to consider what this meant, he marched right through it. Joanna was bathing, as she had been when Tywin first saw her in the forest. Unlike that auspicious day, he now saw that she had, not the long, white legs of a woman, but the coiling, scaly tail of a snake. \"I trusted you,\" Joanna said sadly. \"You broke my trust. Now I must leave.\" \"Yes, leave,\" Tywin replied, \"or I shall chop you into pieces and feed you to the dogs. Devil. Whore. Liar.\" Salt water and sweet mingling on her skin and scales, Joanna wept, but she did not plead. \"You will miss me.\" Tywin did not understand that she was not the one who should be pleading. \"I have already forgotten you.\" Joanna vanished from the great house that day. Tywin made of his heart a stone that nothing could ever gnaw on again, and forbade the servants to speak her name to his children. But servants loved to gossip. The cook described Joanna's green, scaly, serpent's tail in lurid detail, but the children's old nurse thought that story too unsavory, and so told the twins that their mother had had, not the tail of a snake, but that of a fish. The boy, Jaime, did not care either way. The only animals he was interested in had four legs and could be ridden or chased with hunting horn and spear. All Jaime understood was that his mother was gone, and that his father's hard heart was to blame. The girl, Cersei, cared very much. She thought her nurse a foolish old woman. Lions disdained even to eat fish, let alone mate with them. Cersei agreed with her brother that their mother's disappearance was their father's fault. She decided that, if she could not be a lion, she would rather be a snake than a fish. Right, that's scene-setting out of the way. No Tyrion in this AU, sorry! But never fear, gentle reader, the twins take center stage in the next chapter, and Brienne follows soon after.;-) This chapter is based on the medieval French-German legend of Melusine. (See the end of the chapter for notes.) As they grew to maturity under their father's cold roof, the twins learned to become everything to each other. Since their father thought other children unfit companions for them, they were left to mold and shape themselves so as to fit each other perfectly. Once coddled and spoiled, after Tywin broke Joanna's trust they were neglected, had to tend each other like saplings in a dark forest. One birth, one life, one great loss should have made them one person. Or so they thought, lonely children caught on the cusp between innocence and corruption. But the hole left by their mother's vanishing remained, both tying them together and keeping them apart. They grew and discovered how their bodies fit and filled each other, making them briefly whole, but the voids they both carried in their hearts could not so easily overlap and be extinguished. Tywin thought that two proud young lions grew in his house, but Jaime and Cersei were more akin to two lame beggars who lean on each other, and so can imitate how one healthy person walks. To anyone who did not look too closely, they seemed golden. Their gilt was of different shades. Jaime took from his mother her love of the sun and the forest, where one could run and then doze off in a warm place, like a great lizard, fascinating yet self-evident. Cersei inherited her mother's fondness for bodies of water and her ease with secrets. She may not have had a hidden serpent's tail, but she was not content. The sea called to her. \"Don't go,\" Jaime pleaded. \"I cannot be without you.\" Even more than most young men in love, he was convinced this was so. Cersei smiled with rare contentment as they stood by the ship which would carry her away. She had told her father nothing. \"I will come back,\" she promised. \"In seven years, I will come back and take you away with me. I will have a golden ship with silk sails and seventeen sailors to man it. We will be free at last.\" Although he called her his mirror image, his other self, Jaime could not find the words to sway her. He had always known his sister would slip away, flow through his fingers, slither away between his legs, but as long as she had called herself his, his lover, his twin, his own, he had not cared. She sailed away, and he remained behind, to wait for her. The seven years were hard on him. He learned true aloneness, but he also discovered that being without Cersei was not as impossible as he had believed. He went hunting and drinking in village taverns, and took no woman to his bed. As the end of the seventh year approached, days went by when he only thought of his golden twin while walking by the sea, watching for ships etched against the setting sun. When seven years elapsed and she did not return, a part of him was wounded, but not surprised. Another six years passed. Jaime dwelt alone in his father's house, which he never took to calling a castle, even after Tywin's death. He told himself he was staying true to Cersei, but in truth he had learned to do without. He was an old lion before his time, brooding in his great house and walking by the sea for lack of something better to do. It was on the beach one evening that he found an unexpected treasure. So I decided to combine elements of \"The Daemon Lover\" ballad (its several variations) with some variations on the twins' canonical relationship. Because why not?:-) Next chapter, Brienne! (See the end of the chapter for notes.) In was an evening when the sky turned orange, the sea purple and green, and fishermen came back with tales of finned beauties captured in their nets. Jaime did not find a mermaid on the beach. He found a woman taller and broader than any he had ever seen, and uglier, too. She was staring at the sea as though she suspected it of plotting a particularly high tide to carry her away. Yet on hearing him approach, she turned on him eyes which seemed to have drunk up all of the blue from the ocean. He had been thinking of Cersei when he happened upon this giantess. The contrast between the gilded beauty of his memories and the solid ugliness of the woman before his eyes drew a laugh out of him, sending a flush of scarlet across the large woman's face. She gave him a look that should by rights have turned him to stone, then walked hurriedly away, deaf to his jests and barbs. Servants' gossip informed him that the woman from the beach was named Brienne, and was a blacksmith newly arrived in the duchy. She had never lived so close to the sea before, but by all accounts she made excellent kettles and armor. Jaime went to her smithy, telling himself it was something to do while he waited for his golden lover to return. Brienne refused to speak to him until he ordered a full suit of armor. Then she only spoke of styles and prices. He did not need armor. He simply wanted to see what the giantess would do. Within two weeks, the armor was ready. It bore a gilded lion on the breastplate, and was quite the best work in at least three duchies. Jaime next ordered a sword, certain that Brienne would not know how to make one. Soon he had it in hand, the pommel shaped like a lion's head with snarling jaws. \"I shall go and slay a monster for you, shall I?\" he teased the silent blacksmith. \"Maybe that will make you smile.\" He went in search of monsters, but all he found was a big brown bear which nearly took his arm off when he lured it out of its cave. He brought back its head for Brienne, but she looked at him as though her armor had robbed him of his wits. \"What would I do with that?\" she asked, aghast. \"I thought flowers and silk dresses would make poor wooing presents for you,\" Jaime spat out, surprising them both into silence. \"It is a poor love which requires such proof,\" Brienne said eventually. Then added, blushing warmly in her leather apron, much more warmly than the heat inside the smithy warranted: \"Perhaps you would like to sit and help me work the bellows.\" So he did, and soon discovered that while no amount of watching improved her looks, she did have the most endearingly toothy smile, when she chose to show it, and her eyes always spoke of clear skies and calm seas. The hole in his heart felt smaller when she was around. He felt almost whole for far longer than he ever had in his sister's arms. He had to ask for Brienne's hand in marriage three - or maybe two - times. The first time was with the aid of the bear's head. She insisted that was no true proposal, but Jaime teased that she was holding out for a dragon's head. The second time, he was in his cups and told her in great detail how she differed from his sister, so Brienne left him in his servants' care and walked away, red with anger and embarrassment. The third time, his head was still pounding with wine but his mind and eyes were clear when he kissed her in the smithy, and she blushed an unprecedented shade of pink. Astonished and perhaps wondering if he would ever muster the courage to kiss her again if she said no that time, she accepted. She demanded that he allow her one day a week to herself, to spend as she chose, and ask for no accounts thereof. A chill of foreboding passed through Jaime, but he told himself he was not his father. He wanted very much to be wedded and bedding the tall blacksmith, so he consented. Some months after their wedding, two times seven years elapsed since Cersei went to sea. Yup, I made Brienne a landlubber. So, not that many aquatic elements in this chapter (except the confirmation that there are indeed no mermaids in this story), but I hope J/B make up for it.:-P (See the end of the chapter for notes.) Jaime guessed his wife's secret soon after they were married. Had he been a jealous man, he would have assumed that Brienne slipped away to meet a lover, came back to him sweaty and flushed from this phantom's arms. But when he came to the smithy once during her day away from him, and found that she had taken the old sword that stood propped in a corner by the door and occasionally served as an emergency hatstand, he delighted in Brienne's honesty and artlessness. So it was with no malice or worm gnawing at his heart that he fetched the lion-pommel sword she had made for him, and followed her when another week elapsed. He found Brienne in a clearing in the forest, by a pool of still, clear water, practicing her en gardes and ripostes with only a willow sapling as her sadly lacking opponent. \"I knew you were lying,\" he said cheerfully as he walked out of the trees, swinging his sword. \"You told me at our wedding you cannot dance, yet here you are.\" He offered her a bow and a swordsman's salute. \"May I have this dance, if the willow will allow me the pleasure of partnering you?\" He smiled and waited, and waited and smiled. Brienne's blue eyes grew dark, black clouds boiling in the sky before a summer storm. \"You promised,\" she said in a voice like stone breaking. \"I trusted you.\" Jaime's smile faltered. This was something to share, something precious. He was not his father. \"Brienne,\" he said, reached out to touch her. \"Sweetheart.\" She turned away. \"Please leave. Leave me alone,\" she said, her broad back to him, an echo of herself. Jaime wavered, hoping she would turn back and look at him, but all he saw was his own reflection in the still water of the pool. A beautiful, foolish man who could not tell the difference between the essential and the frivolous. He walked away from the clearing, out of the forest, his sword forgotten, dropped somewhere in the brush. He walked down to the beach and along the water's edge, until he saw a ship which shone like gold. It had silk sails and was manned by seventeen sailors. Cersei stood on the sand, her hair spun gold, her eyes and mouth and dimples just as Jaime remembered. \"Well met, brother,\" she greeted him, as though no time at all had flowed between them. \"You said seven years,\" Jaime said, his heart heavy as a rock, hollow as a bone. \"It has been twice as long.\" She frowned, she smiled. \"What does it matter? I needed more time, and now I am come for you. I could have had a king's son for my husband, but I forsook him and came back for you. As I promised I would.\" \"If you forsook a king's son, that is nothing to do with me. You are seven years, fourteen years too late, Cersei. I am married now. She is a good woman. She loves me. I love her.\" His heart would barely let him speak as he remembered Brienne's back, immovable as a mountain. She would never forgive him. He was worse than his father. Cersei laughed like waves crashing, like seagulls crying. \"Jaime.\" She said his name as she had used to do, the way a serpent hisses that you should come closer and she will whisper a secret in your ear. \"What matters this woman? We can be free. Come and kiss me, and then let us away.\" He came to her, telling himself he would kiss her and leave her, show her she had no more power over him. But the memory of Brienne's back, of her fists squeezed by her sides, of her voice telling him to leave, shadowed his footsteps across the sand. Cersei's lips were as soft and warm as they had always been. \"Where would we go?\" Jaime asked, feeling drunk, knowing he was not. She smiled. He was hers, as he had always been. \"Not to the bright hill of heaven,\" she said, \"for they would not want us there. And not to the dark hill of hell, for we would not want to go there. I will show you where lilies bloom on the bottom of the sea.\" The Daemon Lover returns! Also, the Greek myth of Narcissus and Echo. (See the end of the chapter for notes.) Brienne missed him. She had been glad when Jaime did not return home the night after he had come to her in the forest, as though breaking a solemn promise were nothing. The cornerstone of their marriage, a jest for a summer's day. But when one, then two, then three days and nights elapsed, she grew uneasy. Jaime's sword was found in the forest, but no news of brigands setting upon a golden-haired traveler were heard, no bodies washed up on the beach. As the days strung themselves together like prayer beads, Brienne's anger and sense of betrayal turned to worry, then to a different kind of anger. She missed Jaime's hands and his mouth, his sudden bouts of passion and unexpected ability to soothe her when her soul turned dark. She was furious with him for not allowing her to keep this one thing to herself. She never doubted his skill with a sword or that he would have sparred with her gladly. She had wanted to keep a part of herself separate, to remind herself of who she had been before she knew him, but he had not allowed it. Brienne reflected that Jaime's mother made a very grave mistake all those years ago. She should not have slunk away like a kicked cur in the face of Tywin's faithlessness. No, Brienne thought angrily, Joanna should have set Tywin's hounds on him for violating her, let them tear him apart like a stag. Should have turned him into a stag the moment he spied her naked in the forest, stayed safe in her watery sanctuary, and saved herself from heartbreak. Saved Brienne from heartbreak. Prevented Jaime from ever being born. Brienne missed him. Raged against him for vanishing without a trace, as though he were the one who had been wronged, as though he had woken up next to an ogre when he thought he had married a princess. Missed him. When her thoughts threatened to drive her mad like mice in the wainscoting, scratching and scrabbling through the night, Brienne went to consult the woman they called The Frog. This elderly, malodorous person dwelt in an isolated cottage, telling fortunes and selling love remedies. Potions to secure love, potions to destroy its fruits. Brienne needed neither, but solid advice. The Frog laughed to hear Brienne's request. \"You do not need my advice, daughter, only to hear yourself think. Tell me your story.\" Brienne did. Even the part Jaime had not known, about the life growing under her heart, heavy with her sorrow and hope. The Frog stirred something sweet-smelling in her witch's pot. Something to lend courage to a frightened heart, something to lighten the burden of worry. \"I can tell you where he is,\" she said. \"But the road there will not be easy for you. Is it worth it, to find a foolish man who broke your trust and abandoned you to run off with his golden twin?\" Brienne winced. \"And if he did come back to you,\" The Frog continued, \"what then?\" Brienne thought this over. \"I will never know, unless I find him. Once I have found him, then I will decide what to do.\" The Frog chuckled, a sound like twigs snapping and snails' shells popping. \"You already have, daughter. Choices are made on a breath, in the beat between two strikes of your heart.\" She told Brienne how she would find Jaime, and what to bring, and what to do if he did come back with her. Sending Brienne on her way, The Frog shook her head, not unkindly, at the precious folly of women in love. Maggy the Frog, Plot Propeller Extraordinaire, strikes again! The Greek myth of Actaeon and Artemis informed Brienne's thoughts on Jaime's parents' marriage. More water is coming next chapter.:-) (See the end of the chapter for notes.) Lilies did indeed bloom on the bottom of the sea, but this meant little to Jaime, who needed air to survive. Wrapped in his sister's arms, drunk on her skin and mouth, Jaime refused to think himself her captive. Although the cave deep under the sea where they lay had no discernible way in or out. Although he could no longer tell if time passed at all. Although he had made foolish, irrevocable choices that day on the beach, in the forest clearing, following his wife as she set out from home. He had once thought he needed Cersei to live. He was learning, all over again, lessons which had come to him over nearly fourteen years, slow and numbing as leprosy. Despite Cersei's skin, her legs, the saltiness and muskiness of her, he could not help thinking of Brienne. Could not help comparing her to Cersei, and finding that no duality he came up with quite fit either woman. Light and darkness. Beauty and ugliness. Life and dream. Gold and blue. One of them bright yet cruel and as cold as a fish, the other warm yet ungainly, stolid, quotidian. He lay with Cersei in the highest tower of his father's house, listening to the sea boom and surge far below. A voice he recognized as Brienne's spoke to him: \"Jaime, get up and come away. The water is rising, it is in the kitchens, the sea is flooding the cellars and the great hall. Get up now or you die.\" He did not care to save himself so much. He kept embracing Cersei. Brienne's voice spoke again: \"Jaime, the water is in your father's study, it is washing away the cobwebs in your mother's locked chamber, it is climbing the stairs. Get up now or the servants, the villagers, the entire duchy dies.\" Cersei was kissing him, and he did not respond. What cared he if the world entire drowned? Brienne spoke into his ear, her voice calm, warm as touch: \"Jaime, the sea is lapping under the door, it is seeping to this bed, it is soaking the covers. Get up now or we die.\" He awoke to find himself in an underwater cave without an entrance, Cersei asleep beside him, heavy as gold bars. He was certain he could not breathe. \"Brienne,\" he whispered, an invocation, an apology, a true telling. \"Brienne, I can survive here without you. But I cannot live without you. Come and find me, love.\" Jaime's dream owes everything to \"The Drowned City,\" a faux-Victorian poem written by A. S. Byatt for her novel Possession, and based on the Breton legend of the submerged City of Ys. That, and GRRM's love of making Jaime's dreams ridiculously Freudian.:-P (See the end of the chapter for notes.) In stories told on a winter's night, it was customary for the woman abandoned and maligned by her lover to face three challenges in order to regain his love, suffering various indignities along the way. Brienne was not an easy woman to humiliate or deter, and she was not seeking Jaime's love. She already had that, she knew, despite his betrayal, his vanishing. She had to find him so that he could find his way back to her, if he so chose. The first challenge waited for her on the beach. A pile of lentils as high as her waist, all mixed up with sand and pebbles. She had until sundown to separate the lentils from the rest. No helpful colony of ants appeared to help the distressed maiden. Brienne was no maiden, and she had ten healthy fingers and a mule's will. She was done well before sundown, the pile of lentils now only as high as her knee, the sand and pebbles already reverting to the beach to which they belonged. Her reward was that a path opened up for her from the beach to the foot of a distant headland, where she faced her second challenge: to find the scales of a very rare nocturnal fish which changed color like an opal in the moonlight. In the short time she had spent living by the sea, Brienne had not learned to swim. There was no moon out that night, and the rocks of the headland were slippery and sharp. She had with her the three objects The Frog had advised her to bring - the bear skull, boiled clean of meat, the armor she had made for Jaime, and the lion-pommel sword - but could not make a fishing line from them. She despaired of finding, let alone catching the elusive fish, when she remembered the great storm which had battered the shore not two nights earlier. Brienne started a small fire well away from the water, then crawled on one hand and her knees along the rocks, holding up a torch in her other hand. It was profoundly undignified and hard on her palms and knees, but it was necessary, and the night was dark and empty of prying eyes. By the light of the torch, she spotted the iridescent glimmer of scales from fish which the storm had dashed upon the rocks, and gathered a handful. As the sun rose, the path to her third challenge opened. It took her to the top of the headland, where the wind howled and the waves gnashed like hungry teeth, gnawing at the rock. There, Brienne found a plain drinking cup. She had until midnight to decant the whole sea using that cup. Why would the path bring her to the top of the headland if the challenge required her to stay close to the water, she wondered, staring dazedly at the empty cup, smaller than her hand. Brienne looked over the edge of the headland and saw the underwater cave, deep down beneath the crystal-clear sea at dawn. She knew this was a true choice to test her, but also a trick. She accepted the challenge. Laying aside the cup, she put on Jaime's armor and strapped on his sword. Then, gripping the bear skull under her arm, she jumped off the headland. Weighed down as she was, Brienne sank like a stone. Down and down she went, past fish and other creatures that swim where no human could be, past the trailing tendrils of blooming lilies, until her feet met solid rock, and she found she need not hold her breath any longer. She was in the cave, salt water dripping from her hair, her hands, her armor. It pooled on the floor around her, dripped off the point of Jaime's sword, drained from the bottom of the bear skull. Brienne was not crying. Her eyes and mind were clear when she saw Jaime, smiling at her as though she were the sun peeking over the horizon, and his sister, a look like thunder on her beautiful face. Brienne performs variations on the three tests Psyche had to go through in order to win back Cupid in the Greek myth. Of course, Psyche was your typical distressed damsel who couldn't tie her shoes without a benevolent deus ex machina coming along to help her... (See the end of the chapter for notes.) Brienne did not speak. There were so many things she wanted to say to Jaime. So many things he needed to hear, deserved to hear. I love you, come back to me. You are a selfish bastard, and you do not deserve me. You are my husband, my lover, I am carrying your child, you should choose me. I do not trust you like I did before, but I will try to forgive you. You ran back to her, but you smiled when you saw me. I love you. I love you. I love you. Come back to me. She stood there, in a pool of sea water, dressed in his armor, with the bear skull under her arm, like a character in a mummery. A bumbling knight. A deluded woman. Looking at Jaime, her face immobile as the headland from which she had jumped to get to him. She would not make the choice easy for him. Could not. She would not use guilt or love or the wiles his sister had used to sway him. The choice would be his and his alone. \"Jaime,\" Cersei spoke. \"Tell this beast to swim back to the surface, if she can. You are mine, and I am yours. It has always been so.\" She sounded so confident, secure in her underwater cave, her domain. Still Brienne did not speak or smile or frown, but only looked at Jaime. He took her in, all of her, her face, her eyes, her blacksmith's hands, the armor she had made, the bear skull. The water dripping down her collar, pooling around her feet. \"You were supposed to remain true to me,\" Cersei said, agitation creeping into her voice, into her soft hands. \"But I forgive you. You chose me. Tell her to leave.\" Jaime never took his eyes off Brienne. \"It can be a real burden, belonging to someone, especially when they become little more than a shade on your memory,\" he said. \"And it can be a real burden, living with someone who is so good, who has the power to forgive you.\" Brienne winced, hunched her shoulders, squeezed the bear skull desperately with both hands. If she let it go, she was certain she could no longer breathe, the sea would rush in and claim her. She could not look as Jaime turned to his sister, could not stand to see her smile. \"I did choose, Cersei,\" he said. \"And then I chose again.\" Brienne looked up. Jaime was looking at her, the warmth of summer days and winter nights in his eyes. \"Now I choose a third time. If you will have me.\" He smiled at his wife. \"Brienne.\" Her name like honey on his tongue. \"You can't swim,\" he added. \"No.\" The word was little more than a breath on Brienne's lips. He came to her then, took the hand that was not holding the bear skull, squeezed her chilled fingers, scraped raw on rocks and lentils. After a moment, she squeezed back. \"You will come back to me, Jaime,\" Cersei mocked. \"I will call to you, and you will not be able to resist. Maybe I will give you seven whole years, since you resented those extra seven I took for myself so much. Then I will call you, skin to skin, and you will sail away with me again.\" Brienne looked over her shoulder at the beautiful woman, and saw how alone she was, and how unused to it. Cersei knew how to get her way only through beauty, power, magic. The knowledge of her aloneness had not even reached her yet. When it did, it would likely drown her. Brienne's words of anger turned to pity in her mouth. \"Your mother would be ashamed of you,\" she said. Cersei flinched and hissed, but Jaime and Brienne were already gone. In addition to Melusine and, oh, every story involving the Power of Threes ever, this chapter draws obliquely on the Celtic legend of selkies. One more chapter to go! (See the end of the chapter for notes.) They emerged on the beach, squelched up the sand in their waterlogged clothes and rusting armor. Brienne trudged along, two paces ahead of Jaime, keeping her head down, not looking back. Fearful that if she checked whether he was following, she would find him sinking back beneath the waves, into his sister's arms. \"That armor is ruined, you know,\" Jaime said with forced cheer. \"What ever possessed you to jump into the sea while wearing it?\" Brienne whirled on him, and he fell back a step, his customary grin wavering when he saw her face. He drew breath to speak, but she forestalled him with a raised hand. \"I do not want your words,\" she said quietly. \"If you want to explain yourself, if you want to apologize, you will have to actually do.\" She put down the bear skull and the sword, and started to strip off the armor. Jaime's eyes went wide with surprise, then glittered with lust, then narrowed in confusion, as she took it off, piece by piece, not meeting his eyes. When the armor was piled between them, Brienne stepped back, and gestured as The Frog had taught her. The armor grew into a wild and nearly impassable mountain between them. It took Jaime the better part of a week to make his way over it, nearly falling down ravines, avoiding rockslides and hungry beasts. When finally he came down the mountain, several days' worth of stubble on his chin and his clothes in tatters, Brienne was waiting for him with the bear skull upended in her hands, full of water. She poured the water onto the ground, where it transformed into a very large, very cold lake. By the time Jaime reached the other shore, he was wet through, shivering and blue-lipped, and cursing his wife's stubbornness as well as his own. Brienne had his sword at the ready, as though about to drive it, point-first, into the earth. Jaime rushed forward before she could do so, grabbed the blade with his bare hand. Brienne gasped, tried to pull the sword back, then tried to drop it. Jaime winced and muttered in pain in response to her every move, but did not let go. They struggled, a graceless dance, a battle performed by traveling players. Finally the sword lay, inert and only itself, on the blood-spattered grass, and Jaime's hand was wrapped in the torn hem of Brienne's shirt. She had her arm around his shoulders and her fingers in his hair, called him unflattering names in a voice high with panic and relief. \"Brienne,\" he interrupted, teeth chattering. \"Remember that it is a poor love which requires so much proof.\" Brienne bit her lip to stop the stream of words pouring out of her, shook her head, her nose brushing his ear. \"That is not enough,\" she whispered. Jaime sighed. \"I know. But it's something to begin with.\" They went back to Jaime's house and set about preparing it for the birth of their child: aired out rooms not used in decades, shut up others filled with bad memories. Jaime often hinted that, once the child was born, sparring would be the best way to get Brienne's strength back, and more enjoyable than banging on her anvil. Not quite as enjoyable as other kinds of banging, of course, but still. She refused to either smile or scowl at this, would give him nothing stronger than a maybe. Brienne would not keep Jaime tethered to their front door like a goat, in case his sister ever did decide to call to him. She might never trust him completely again, she knew, and labored under that knowledge as she did under her advancing pregnancy. Yet every day Jaime chose her, again and again. And so every day, as the child grew and his hand healed, as metal sang, as sun and moon played tug of war with the tides, Brienne slowly learned to trust him again. Because in a story based on threes, with three times three chapters, there must be three final challenges with a twist. Also, bits of the myth of Orpheus and of The Odyssey.",

      "A beautiful, foolish man who could not tell the difference between the essential and the frivolous.",
      "He walked away from the clearing, out of the forest, his sword forgotten, dropped somewhere in the brush.",
      "He walked down to the beach and along the water's edge, until he saw a ship which shone like gold.",
      "It had silk sails and was manned by seventeen sailors.",
      "Cersei stood on the sand, her hair spun gold, her eyes and mouth and dimples just as Jaime remembered.",
      "\"Well met, brother,\" she greeted him, as though no time at all had flowed between them.",
      "\"You said seven years,\" Jaime said, his heart heavy as a rock, hollow as a bone.",
      "\"It has been twice as long.\"",
      "She frowned, she smiled.",

      "I needed more time, and now I am come for you.",

      "He was worse than his father.",
      "Cersei laughed like waves crashing, like seagulls crying.",
      "\"Jaime.\"",
      "She said his name as she had used to do, the way a serpent hisses that you should come closer and she will whisper a secret in your ear.",
      "\"What matters this woman?",
      "We can be free.",
      "Come and kiss me, and then let us away.\"",
      "He came to her, telling himself he would kiss her and leave her, show her she had no more power over him.",
      "But the memory of Brienne's back, of her fists squeezed by her sides, of her voice telling him to leave, shadowed his footsteps across the sand.",
      "Cersei's lips were as soft and warm as they had always been.",
      "\"Where would we go?\" Jaime asked, feeling drunk, knowing he was not.",
      "She smiled.",
      "He was hers, as he had always been.",

      "But when one, then two, then three days and nights elapsed, she grew uneasy.",
      "Jaime's sword was found in the forest, but no news of brigands setting upon a golden-haired traveler were heard, no bodies washed up on the beach.",
      "As the days strung themselves together like prayer beads, Brienne's anger and sense of betrayal turned to worry, then to a different kind of anger.",
      "She missed Jaime's hands and his mouth, his sudden bouts of passion and unexpected ability to soothe her when her soul turned dark.",
      "She was furious with him for not allowing her to keep this one thing to herself.",
      "She never doubted his skill with a sword or that he would have sparred with her gladly.",
      "She had wanted to keep a part of herself separate, to remind herself of who she had been before she knew him, but he had not allowed it.",
      "Brienne reflected that Jaime's mother made a very grave mistake all those years ago.",
      "She should not have slunk away like a kicked cur in the face of Tywin's faithlessness.",
      "No, Brienne thought angrily, Joanna should have set Tywin's hounds on him for violating her, let them tear him apart like a stag.",
      "Should have turned him into a stag the moment he spied her naked in the forest, stayed safe in her watery sanctuary, and saved herself from heartbreak.",
      "Saved Brienne from heartbreak.",
      "Prevented Jaime from ever being born.",
      "Brienne missed him.",
      "Raged against him for vanishing without a trace, as though he were the one who had been wronged, as though he had woken up next to an ogre when he thought he had married a princess.",
      "Missed him.",
      "When her thoughts threatened to drive her mad like mice in the wainscoting, scratching and scrabbling through the night, Brienne went to consult the woman they called The Frog.",
      "This elderly, malodorous person dwelt in an isolated cottage, telling fortunes and selling love remedies.",
      "Potions to secure love, potions to destroy its fruits.",

      "\"You do not need my advice, daughter, only to hear yourself think.",
      "Tell me your story.\"",
      "Brienne did.",
      "Even the part Jaime had not known, about the life growing under her heart, heavy with her sorrow and hope.",
      "The Frog stirred something sweet-smelling in her witch's pot.",
      "Something to lend courage to a frightened heart, something to lighten the burden of worry.",
      "\"I can tell you where he is,\" she said.",
      "\"But the road there will not be easy for you.",
      "Is it worth it, to find a foolish man who broke your trust and abandoned you to run off with his golden twin?\" Brienne winced.",
      "\"And if he did come back to you,\" The Frog continued, \"what then?\" Brienne thought this over.",
      "\"I will never know, unless I find him.",
      "Once I have found him, then I will decide what to do.\"",

      "Choices are made on a breath, in the beat between two strikes of your heart.\"",
      "She told Brienne how she would find Jaime, and what to bring, and what to do if he did come back with her.",

      "Lilies did indeed bloom on the bottom of the sea, but this meant little to Jaime, who needed air to survive.",
      "Wrapped in his sister's arms, drunk on her skin and mouth, Jaime refused to think himself her captive.",
      "Although the cave deep under the sea where they lay had no discernible way in or out.",
      "Although he could no longer tell if time passed at all.",
      "Although he had made foolish, irrevocable choices that day on the beach, in the forest clearing, following his wife as she set out from home.",
      "He had once thought he needed Cersei to live.",
      "He was learning, all over again, lessons which had come to him over nearly fourteen years, slow and numbing as leprosy.",
      "Despite Cersei's skin, her legs, the saltiness and muskiness of her, he could not help thinking of Brienne.",
      "Could not help comparing her to Cersei, and finding that no duality he came up with quite fit either woman.",

      "A voice he recognized as Brienne's spoke to him: \"Jaime, get up and come away.",
      "The water is rising, it is in the kitchens, the sea is flooding the cellars and the great hall.",
      "Get up now or you die.\"",
      "He did not care to save himself so much.",
      "He kept embracing Cersei.",
      "Brienne's voice spoke again: \"Jaime, the water is in your father's study, it is washing away the cobwebs in your mother's locked chamber, it is climbing the stairs.",
      "Get up now or the servants, the villagers, the entire duchy dies.\"",
      "Cersei was kissing him, and he did not respond.",
      "What cared he if the world entire drowned?",
      "Brienne spoke into his ear, her voice calm, warm as touch: \"Jaime, the sea is lapping under the door, it is seeping to this bed, it is soaking the covers.",
      "Get up now or we die.\"",
      "He awoke to find himself in an underwater cave without an entrance, Cersei asleep beside him, heavy as gold bars.",
      "He was certain he could not breathe.",
      "\"Brienne,\" he whispered, an invocation, an apology, a true telling.",
      "\"Brienne, I can survive here without you.",
      "But I cannot live without you.",
      "Come and find me, love.\"",
      "Jaime's dream owes everything to \"The Drowned City,\" a faux-Victorian poem written by A. S. Byatt for her novel Possession, and based on the Breton legend of the submerged City of Ys.",
      "That, and GRRM's love of making Jaime's dreams ridiculously Freudian.:-P (See the end of the chapter for notes.)",
      "In stories told on a winter's night, it was customary for the woman abandoned and maligned by her lover to face three challenges in order to regain his love, suffering various indignities along the way.",
      "Brienne was not an easy woman to humiliate or deter, and she was not seeking Jaime's love.",
      "She already had that, she knew, despite his betrayal, his vanishing.",
      "She had to find him so that he could find his way back to her, if he so chose.",
      "The first challenge waited for her on the beach.",
      "A pile of lentils as high as her waist, all mixed up with sand and pebbles.",
      "She had until sundown to separate the lentils from the rest.",
      "No helpful colony of ants appeared to help the distressed maiden.",
      "Brienne was no maiden, and she had ten healthy fingers and a mule's will.",
      "She was done well before sundown, the pile of lentils now only as high as her knee, the sand and pebbles already reverting to the beach to which they belonged.",
      "Her reward was that a path opened up for her from the beach to the foot of a distant headland, where she faced her second challenge: to find the scales of a very rare nocturnal fish which changed color like an opal in the moonlight.",
      "In the short time she had spent living by the sea, Brienne had not learned to swim.",
      "There was no moon out that night, and the rocks of the headland were slippery and sharp.",
      "She had with her the three objects The Frog had advised her to bring - the bear skull, boiled clean of meat, the armor she had made for Jaime, and the lion-pommel sword - but could not make a fishing line from them.",
      "She despaired of finding, let alone catching the elusive fish, when she remembered the great storm which had battered the shore not two nights earlier.",
      "Brienne started a small fire well away from the water, then crawled on one hand and her knees along the rocks, holding up a torch in her other hand.",
      "It was profoundly undignified and hard on her palms and knees, but it was necessary, and the night was dark and empty of prying eyes.",
      "By the light of the torch, she spotted the iridescent glimmer of scales from fish which the storm had dashed upon the rocks, and gathered a handful.",
      "As the sun rose, the path to her third challenge opened.",
      "It took her to the top of the headland, where the wind howled and the waves gnashed like hungry teeth, gnawing at the rock.",
      "There, Brienne found a plain drinking cup.",
      "She had until midnight to decant the whole sea using that cup.",
      "Why would the path bring her to the top of the headland if the challenge required her to stay close to the water, she wondered, staring dazedly at the empty cup, smaller than her hand.",
      "Brienne looked over the edge of the headland and saw the underwater cave, deep down beneath the crystal-clear sea at dawn.",
      "She knew this was a true choice to test her, but also a trick.",
      "She accepted the challenge.",
      "Laying aside the cup, she put on Jaime's armor and strapped on his sword.",
      "Then, gripping the bear skull under her arm, she jumped off the headland.",
      "Weighed down as she was, Brienne sank like a stone.",
      "Down and down she went, past fish and other creatures that swim where no human could be, past the trailing tendrils of blooming lilies, until her feet met solid rock, and she found she need not hold her breath any longer.",
      "She was in the cave, salt water dripping from her hair, her hands, her armor.",
      "It pooled on the floor around her, dripped off the point of Jaime's sword, drained from the bottom of the bear skull.",
      "Brienne was not crying.",
      "Her eyes and mind were clear when she saw Jaime, smiling at her as though she were the sun peeking over the horizon, and his sister, a look like thunder on her beautiful face.",
      "Brienne performs variations on the three tests Psyche had to go through in order to win back Cupid in the Greek myth.",
      "Of course, Psyche was your typical distressed damsel who couldn't tie her shoes without a benevolent deus ex machina coming along to help her... (See the end of the chapter for notes.)",
      "Brienne did not speak.",
      "There were so many things she wanted to say to Jaime.",
      "So many things he needed to hear, deserved to hear.",
      "I love you, come back to me.",
      "You are a selfish bastard, and you do not deserve me.",
      "You are my husband, my lover, I am carrying your child, you should choose me.",
      "I do not trust you like I did before, but I will try to forgive you.",
      "You ran back to her, but you smiled when you saw me.",
      "I love you.",
      "I love you.",
      "I love you.",
      "Come back to me.",
      "She stood there, in a pool of sea water, dressed in his armor, with the bear skull under her arm, like a character in a mummery.",
      "A bumbling knight.",
      "A deluded woman.",
      "Looking at Jaime, her face immobile as the headland from which she had jumped to get to him.",
      "She would not make the choice easy for him.",
      "Could not.",
      "She would not use guilt or love or the wiles his sister had used to sway him.",
      "The choice would be his and his alone.",
      "\"Jaime,\" Cersei spoke.",
      "\"Tell this beast to swim back to the surface, if she can.",
      "You are mine, and I am yours.",
      "It has always been so.\"",
      "She sounded so confident, secure in her underwater cave, her domain.",
      "Still Brienne did not speak or smile or frown, but only looked at Jaime.",
      "He took her in, all of her, her face, her eyes, her blacksmith's hands, the armor she had made, the bear skull.",
      "The water dripping down her collar, pooling around her feet.",
      "\"You were supposed to remain true to me,\" Cersei said, agitation creeping into her voice, into her soft hands.",
      "\"But I forgive you.",
      "You chose me.",
      "Tell her to leave.\"",
      "Jaime never took his eyes off Brienne.",
      "\"It can be a real burden, belonging to someone, especially when they become little more than a shade on your memory,\" he said.",
      "\"And it can be a real burden, living with someone who is so good, who has the power to forgive you.\"",
      "Brienne winced, hunched her shoulders, squeezed the bear skull desperately with both hands.",
      "If she let it go, she was certain she could no longer breathe, the sea would rush in and claim her.",
      "She could not look as Jaime turned to his sister, could not stand to see her smile.",
      "\"I did choose, Cersei,\" he said.",
      "\"And then I chose again.\"",
      "Brienne looked up.",
      "Jaime was looking at her, the warmth of summer days and winter nights in his eyes.",
      "\"Now I choose a third time.",
      "If you will have me.\"",
      "He smiled at his wife.",
      "\"Brienne.\"",
      "Her name like honey on his tongue.",
      "\"You can't swim,\" he added.",
      "\"No.\"",
      "The word was little more than a breath on Brienne's lips.",
      "He came to her then, took the hand that was not holding the bear skull, squeezed her chilled fingers, scraped raw on rocks and lentils.",
      "After a moment, she squeezed back.",
      "\"You will come back to me, Jaime,\" Cersei mocked.",
      "\"I will call to you, and you will not be able to resist.",
      "Maybe I will give you seven whole years, since you resented those extra seven I took for myself so much.",
      "Then I will call you, skin to skin, and you will sail away with me again.\"",
      "Brienne looked over her shoulder at the beautiful woman, and saw how alone she was, and how unused to it.",
      "Cersei knew how to get her way only through beauty, power, magic.",
      "The knowledge of her aloneness had not even reached her yet.",
      "When it did, it would likely drown her.",
      "Brienne's words of anger turned to pity in her mouth.",
      "\"Your mother would be ashamed of you,\" she said.",
      "Cersei flinched and hissed, but Jaime and Brienne were already gone.",
      "In addition to Melusine and, oh, every story involving the Power of Threes ever, this chapter draws obliquely on the Celtic legend of selkies.",
      "One more chapter to go!",
      "(See the end of the chapter for notes.)",
      "They emerged on the beach, squelched up the sand in their waterlogged clothes and rusting armor.",
      "Brienne trudged along, two paces ahead of Jaime, keeping her head down, not looking back.",
      "Fearful that if she checked whether he was following, she would find him sinking back beneath the waves, into his sister's arms.",
      "\"That armor is ruined, you know,\" Jaime said with forced cheer.",
      "\"What ever possessed you to jump into the sea while wearing it?\" Brienne whirled on him, and he fell back a step, his customary grin wavering when he saw her face.",
      "He drew breath to speak, but she forestalled him with a raised hand.",
      "\"I do not want your words,\" she said quietly.",
      "\"If you want to explain yourself, if you want to apologize, you will have to actually do.\"",
      "She put down the bear skull and the sword, and started to strip off the armor.",
      "Jaime's eyes went wide with surprise, then glittered with lust, then narrowed in confusion, as she took it off, piece by piece, not meeting his eyes.",
      "When the armor was piled between them, Brienne stepped back, and gestured as The Frog had taught her.",
      "The armor grew into a wild and nearly impassable mountain between them.",
      "It took Jaime the better part of a week to make his way over it, nearly falling down ravines, avoiding rockslides and hungry beasts.",
      "When finally he came down the mountain, several days' worth of stubble on his chin and his clothes in tatters, Brienne was waiting for him with the bear skull upended in her hands, full of water.",
      "She poured the water onto the ground, where it transformed into a very large, very cold lake.",
      "By the time Jaime reached the other shore, he was wet through, shivering and blue-lipped, and cursing his wife's stubbornness as well as his own.",
      "Brienne had his sword at the ready, as though about to drive it, point-first, into the earth.",
      "Jaime rushed forward before she could do so, grabbed the blade with his bare hand.",
      "Brienne gasped, tried to pull the sword back, then tried to drop it.",
      "Jaime winced and muttered in pain in response to her every move, but did not let go.",
      "They struggled, a graceless dance, a battle performed by traveling players.",
      "Finally the sword lay, inert and only itself, on the blood-spattered grass, and Jaime's hand was wrapped in the torn hem of Brienne's shirt.",
      "She had her arm around his shoulders and her fingers in his hair, called him unflattering names in a voice high with panic and relief.",
      "\"Brienne,\" he interrupted, teeth chattering.",
      "\"Remember that it is a poor love which requires so much proof.\"",
      "Brienne bit her lip to stop the stream of words pouring out of her, shook her head, her nose brushing his ear.",
      "\"That is not enough,\" she whispered.",
      "Jaime sighed.",
      "\"I know.",
      "But it's something to begin with.\"",
      "They went back to Jaime's house and set about preparing it for the birth of their child: aired out rooms not used in decades, shut up others filled with bad memories.",
      "Jaime often hinted that, once the child was born, sparring would be the best way to get Brienne's strength back, and more enjoyable than banging on her anvil.",
      "Not quite as enjoyable as other kinds of banging, of course, but still.",
      "She refused to either smile or scowl at this, would give him nothing stronger than a maybe.",
      "Brienne would not keep Jaime tethered to their front door like a goat, in case his sister ever did decide to call to him.",
      "She might never trust him completely again, she knew, and labored under that knowledge as she did under her advancing pregnancy.",
      "Yet every day Jaime chose her, again and again.",
      "And so every day, as the child grew and his hand healed, as metal sang, as sun and moon played tug of war with the tides, Brienne slowly learned to trust him again.",
      "Because in a story based on threes, with three times three chapters, there must be three final challenges with a twist.",
      "Also, bits of the myth of Orpheus and of The Odyssey."

    "text": "\"This idea is dangerous and stupid! Patroclus, you haven't set foot on the field in the past two years. How could you think that you'd be able to slip back in with ease?\" Achilles' fists were clenched tightly, anger surged through him. Patroclus sat on their cot, his face was calm and determined. \"Achilles, they won't know it's me. They will simple believe it's you and they will turn away and we can advance.\" Patroclus reasoned. Achilles stared at the man, \"What if it fails? What if something happens to you? The gods aren't exactly looking at us in favor.\" That sunk in and the tent was quiet, \"A prayer couldn't hurt.\" Patroclus said a quiet prayer to Ares, asking for strength and guidance. Achilles put his hands on Patroclus' shoulders, \"I want you safe.\" His green eyes bore in Patroclus' brown eyes. He could see the gold flakes within the green. \"I'll ride out and then turn back around. Then the Greeks will take Troy, we'll win this war and then we'll find our home and live there.\" \"But the prophecy-\" \"Things can change. They said that you will kill Hector but you have no reason to. Prophecies can become void.\" Patroclus said. He pressed a kiss to the blonde's lips. \"We'll find our home.\" He repeated. When they were children, Achilles had dreamed of having a home on a moutainside over looking a sea. \"We'd have servants, and feasts that would rival those in my father's house. My weapons and spoils of war would hang over our fireplace.\" When he got older, he had pulled Patroclus to his chest and whispered, \"I'd make love to you in every room, we'd swim naked in the clear blue sea and watch the stars make their dance across the sky.\" They smiled at this, Achilles held Patroclus to him, and kissed him. The kiss was deep, and when their lips distanced, both shivered from a sudden cold feeling. Achilles dressed Patroclus in his armor. He studied the man who was shaking slightly. Achilles pressed another kiss to his lips. \"Come back to me, Patroclus. Come back.\" Their hands didn't separate until the chariot drove away. Patroclus took a breath and stared ahead. Ajax stood next to him, Achilles' spears rested on the floor of the chariot. \"This is foolish, Patroclus.\" Ajax grumbled. \"It must work, Ajax.\" He said. The chariot rode through the battle and suddenly the crowd parted, \"It's him!\" A Trojan soldier shouted. \"Retreat! It's Achilles!\" Another shouted. The Trojan army began running back towards the forest, triumph rushed through Patroclus and got the better of him. He grabbed one of Achilles' spears and flung it and it soared through the air and impaled a soldier who collapsed in a puddle of blood. Ajax warned him to stop but the thrill of battle rushed through Patroclus, he grabbed another spear and flung it into the crowd where it went through the side of a soldier. The Trojans continued their retreat and then they stopped where they stood. A tall man emerged from the crowd. Hector. Patroclus thought, horror washing over him. \"Achilles! Fight me! Stand before me and face your death!\" His voice echoed across the field. \"Don't do it.\" Ajax warned. \"Give me the sword. If Hector dies now then Achilles won't have to fight him and then he and I will both survive this war.\" Triumph was replaced his anger and determination. \"Don't! Patroclus this is not some servant from Troy, this is Hector. He had destroyed most of our army. He will tear through you.\" Ajax warned. \"Let me fight him. Go back to Achilles.\" \"Coward! Face me!\" Hector roared. Patroclus grabbed Ajax's sword and stepped out of the chariot. Hector pulled out his sword and they met halfway in the field. Hector swung his sword and Patroclus blocked his move. Hector was stronger than him, the sword threatened to leave his hands. Patroclus swung and the blade slice Hector's arm, blood leaked from the wound. Hector swung again and the move was blocked. Patroclus raised the sword but was swiftly knocked to the ground. The wind was knocked out of him, he reached for his sword but Hector's foot held him arm down. \"The brave Achilles, a coward and a fool.\" He raised his sword. A tear fell from Patroclus' eye, Goodbye Achilles. He shut his eyes and the face of his love appeared. The feeling of warmth of his chest warmed Patroclus as the sword was thrust into the chest. He coughed and tasted blood, the sword was thrust in again and blood filled Patroclus' mouth. He laid still, and there was a loud eruption of cheers. He felt strong hands grab him and he was stripped of his armor. The cheers stopped, \"So. The coward Achilles sent his servant to fight his battle. Shame. Well, at least I got the practice.\" Hector laughed. Ajax scooped Patroclus into his arms, \"Stay with me, Patroclus. Stay with me.\" His voice was far away. The chariot sped away from the Trojans and back to camp. Achilles paced the tent, he listened for the wheels of the chariot. He had heard distant cheers a while back and a smile spread across his face. \"He did it. Patroclus did it!\" He exclaimed. The sound of chariot wheels outside the tent prompted Achilles to open the flap and step outside. He stopped dead when he saw that only Ajax was in the chariot. His blood ran cold, his breath stopped in his chest. \"Patroclus.\" He said. Odysseus ran to them, \"What the hell happened?\" \"Hector.\" Ajax whispered. Odysseus looked into the chariot and his shook his head. \"Let's get him out.\" Gently, Odysseus and Ajax lifted Patroclus from the chariot and laid him on the grass. Blood soaked the front of his tunic. Achilles fell to his knees, \"This joke is cruel. Stop it!\" Achilles shouted. \"What did you do, sacrifice a cow and put his blood on Patroclus?\" He looked the them. Ajax shook his head, \"Ajax. Enough. Patroclus, the joke is over.\" Very weakly, Patroclus touched Achilles' arm. \"Achilles.\" His voice was a whisper. \"Hector has killed me.\" Achilles shook his head, \"No. You aren't dead. Patroclus, you aren't. Hector remained behind Troy's walls. I need you to stay up and come back to me. Please. Patroclus, stay with me!\" Achilles cried. Patroclus' brown eyes bored into Achilles, \"I love you. I always have.\" \"You're going to be alright-\" \"Please!\" Patroclus cried. \"One last kiss before I go.\" Achilles choked out a sob, \"Our home.\" \"My home was with you.\" Patroclus said with a small smile. \"A kiss, my lord.\" Achilles pressed his lips to Patroclus, the smile growing on his face. His face then relaxed and he breathed a shuddered breath and his eyes were glass. Achilles' mouth formed the shape of Patroclus' name but the sound the came out was a howl like a wounded animal. Tears fell from his eyes and strong hands tore at his hair. He pounded the ground. He screamed at the sky, he screamed Patroclus' name. He cradled the body to him and cried the name again. He refused to let them take the body away. For three weeks, he mourned over Patroclus' body. His sorrow was replaced with rage. He grabbed his sword, and without his armor he called for Hector. Their chase through the forest of Troy ended with Achilles thrusting his sword through Hector's chest. The night, Patroclus' shade appeared to Achilles. Achilles extended his arms and tried to hold him to him but the shade vanished after advising Achilles to, \"bury us together.\" Achilles was killed in battle, a poison arrow shot through his heel by Paris. He fell to a ground and died with a smile on his face. The sun shined bright, making the water almost see-through. Patroclus looked over his balcony at the beach, dolphins lept out of the water and disappeared under the surface. The smell of sea salt filled his nostrils, he smiled sadly. He missed Achilles, the pain the loss created in him was unquenchable. Suddenly he heard the gentle melody of the lyre. A distant voice signing made Patroclus look up. A young man was sitting on the beach, playing the lyre and singing along. Achilles! Patroclus' heart lept in his chest, tears fell from his face as he ran out of the home and down the narrow stone steps. He ran towards the blonde boy, \"Achilles!\" He looked up and dropped the lyre, he stood and ran towards Patroclus. They stopped in front of each other. \"Is this another shade? Have I only fallen into madness?\" Patroclus touched Achilles' face, \"It is me. Your love, I have returned to you.\" Patroclus said. Achilles touched Patroclus' hand, his green eyes were wet. \"So you have.\" They kissed, their hands roamed their bodies, feelings each other. They wanted proof that they were alive and well. \"I love you, Achilles.\" \"I love you too. I always will.\" Achilles sniffed. \"I have the home. Our home.\" Achilles looked up at the home on the mountain. He smiled, \"Our home.\" They took each other's hands, and Patroclus led him to their home. And there they stayed, together again.",

    "text": "It was a normal morning by all accounts. It was not, one of those mornings where Patroclus had risen early to satisfy him in the woods. Achilles knew what he did up the hill, on his own. Part of him wondered if Chiron knew too. If he did, he did not say anything. If Achilles leans closer on the pallet he can see the sleep clumped in Patroclus' eyelashes. It should not, by any means, be an attractive sight. There was nothing attractive about Patroclus. His body was too slight, yet shoulders too broad, his lips turned up in a strange way when he smiled, his eyes were a dull brown, there was no magnificence to his lank, dark locks. Yet Achilles watched him sleep. A few years ago Patroclus had kissed him, it had been a strange and confusing moment in his life, Achilles remembers, it is the only time in his life he had ever fled. He doesn't ever want to flee anyone again. Least of all his friend Patroclus. Was he more than a friend? Achilles knew, he knew that he held him in the highest regard, even his Mother could see this, without being able to see him up here, she knew. Patroclus was not just a childhood companion, he was not just the comrade he stole figs with. Patroclus was the first boy to see him fight. He was the first true friend he had ever had. And despite the awkwardness he was his first kiss. Achilles could not lie, it stirred him to lay in bed next to Patroclus and think about his thin lips pressing against his own soft, plump mouth. He rolls over on his side fully, appreciating the rare moment, getting to watch Patroclus doze. So often the boy was roused before him, for many reasons. And Achilles liked his sleep, Chiron was slack enough to sometimes let the half-God bathe in the light of the sun on the pallet before the day began. But now it was he who was awake, and it was at least an hour until the sun would rise up in the mountains. Chiron was sleeping out of sight, and as softly as he would dare, he runs his fingers through Patroclus' hair, stroking his jaw, jolting back when the boy stirs. Theres a smile on his face, almost as if Patroclus knew he was there. He could feel his desire rising at wandering thoughts of him. He did nothing about it. It wasn't because he found it shameful, he simply knew that relief brought by his own hand would not be as sweet as those big hands he had dreamt of. They were by no means as broad as others he had seen, his fingers were almost a little stubby, but against Achilles' beautiful, small hands, Patroclus' looked huge. He had dreamt of those hands around him, those hands that sated desire on those early mornings. Achilles wanted those hands to touch his own body. He couldn't say when he fully realised the desire he had for the boy. Was it now, was it this waking moment? He could not call Patroclus ugly in this light, would not dare to in any other for that matter. He knew he might be percieved as nothing special, certainly so when standing next to the great Prince Achilles. But he was beautiful. So much like this, in a content slumber. He would kiss the sleep from his eyes if he dared, but he did not. Not even a hero could be brave in everything, not even an immortal. He had touched that body as a friend, nimble fingers had run over those broad shoulders, had playfully shoved in wrestling matches. He had seen depth in those brown eyes like he had seen in no others. He wishes he didn't pull away from that kiss back then. It's forgotten now he's sure. He is brave now. He leans forwards barely brushing their lips together, but it's a kiss in his eyes, it's the first he will give to Patroclus, and the boy wont even know of it when he wakes. When Achilles lays himself back down on the pallet, he is sweating and aroused from the simple touch. One day he will have to go and fight the greatest war Greece has ever seen. He will do it for the glory, for his Mother and Father, for the pride, for the status. But he will do it for Patroclus too. He will make Patroclus proud, make him shine. He will be a man worthy of the boys love. One day. Soon.",

      "He was the first true friend he had ever had.",
      "And despite the awkwardness he was his first kiss.",
      "Achilles could not lie, it stirred him to lay in bed next to Patroclus and think about his thin lips pressing against his own soft, plump mouth.",
      "He rolls over on his side fully, appreciating the rare moment, getting to watch Patroclus doze.",
      "So often the boy was roused before him, for many reasons.",
      "And Achilles liked his sleep, Chiron was slack enough to sometimes let the half-God bathe in the light of the sun on the pallet before the day began.",
      "But now it was he who was awake, and it was at least an hour until the sun would rise up in the mountains.",
      "Chiron was sleeping out of sight, and as softly as he would dare, he runs his fingers through Patroclus' hair, stroking his jaw, jolting back when the boy stirs.",
      "Theres a smile on his face, almost as if Patroclus knew he was there.",
      "He could feel his desire rising at wandering thoughts of him.",
      "He did nothing about it.",
      "It wasn't because he found it shameful, he simply knew that relief brought by his own hand would not be as sweet as those big hands he had dreamt of.",
      "They were by no means as broad as others he had seen, his fingers were almost a little stubby, but against Achilles' beautiful, small hands, Patroclus' looked huge.",
      "He had dreamt of those hands around him, those hands that sated desire on those early mornings.",
      "Achilles wanted those hands to touch his own body.",
      "He couldn't say when he fully realised the desire he had for the boy.",
      "Was it now, was it this waking moment?",
      "He could not call Patroclus ugly in this light, would not dare to in any other for that matter.",
      "He knew he might be percieved as nothing special, certainly so when standing next to the great Prince Achilles.",
      "But he was beautiful.",
      "So much like this, in a content slumber.",
      "He would kiss the sleep from his eyes if he dared, but he did not.",
      "Not even a hero could be brave in everything, not even an immortal.",
      "He had touched that body as a friend, nimble fingers had run over those broad shoulders, had playfully shoved in wrestling matches.",
      "He had seen depth in those brown eyes like he had seen in no others.",
      "He wishes he didn't pull away from that kiss back then.",
      "It's forgotten now he's sure.",
      "He is brave now.",
      "He leans forwards barely brushing their lips together, but it's a kiss in his eyes, it's the first he will give to Patroclus, and the boy wont even know of it when he wakes.",
      "When Achilles lays himself back down on the pallet, he is sweating and aroused from the simple touch.",
      "One day he will have to go and fight the greatest war Greece has ever seen.",
      "He will do it for the glory, for his Mother and Father, for the pride, for the status.",
      "But he will do it for Patroclus too.",
      "He will make Patroclus proud, make him shine.",
      "He will be a man worthy of the boys love.",
      "One day.",
      "Soon."

    "text": "She's floating. Peacefully on her back, her eyes closed, her arms stretched out, with no worry in the world. Floating on the massive ocean with nothing but waves and fish around her (no land anywhere in sight.) She's save here, she's loved; she is not scared, not anymore, not ever. The sun shines, it always does, and the seagulls scream but she no longer cares. All she cares about is the feeling of the ocean around her and the sounds it makes, she cares not for her past or the world she came from, she cares just for this. And yet maybe she is not. Maybe she's the one who's drowning, maybe the ocean is all around her, and maybe she has no escape anymore. Maybe she only thinks she's floating, maybe her eyes are closed and this is the only way she will no longer fear what comes next. Because maybe, just maybe, this is the end. Or perhaps that is another girl perhaps that is someone else, lost in the same place. Before her or after her (it does not matter.) Maybe she swims, maybe she paddles, desperately to make it to the land she can no longer see and could probably never find again. Maybe she tries to make it to the place where she can finally breathe again, maybe she just wishes she were floating in safety. But perhaps none of it is real, perhaps it is all a dream really, perhaps she is lying on an island and she's save. Perhaps she is only drowning in the ocean of her own tears. (It matters little though, at least she thinks it doesn't, whether she's the girl who drowns or floats or swims in the massive ocean, or drowns in her own tears, with no land in sight and no one to save her, her tale would always end there.) Maybe they're the same girl, floating, drowning, swimming and living. Maybe they're different girls, all in the same ocean, reacting differently to the moment that would be their end. Or maybe, just maybe, none of it is real. *~* The waves of the ocean crashed around her, slowing her down, pushing her under, trying to make sure she does not make it to the light in the distance. (She knows she will not, the current is too strong, but she still tries, oh god, she still tries.) The light is too far to reach anyway and she knew that but the desperation and the desire not to die made her swim, further than she normally would have been able to. Perhaps if everything had been different, if she did not hold her young child in her arms, if she did not jump, if her husband had not been driven made by Hera, perhaps then her life would have been different and the world would have actually turned right. Perhaps if she had accepted it all, if she had been alone, she would have been able to close her eyes and just float and allow the current to carry her away to wherever it wanted. But nothing will change the events of the night, nothing will make it all different and so she swims, babe in arms, to escape the madness of the man she loved the most. And the light shone in the distance, urging her on, telling her that safety was there. But she knew it was over before it even began. Once, long, long ago - when she was but a child herself - she'd stood on the beach and watched as the waves hit the sand. She lived in the before then, before the fear, before the anger, before the Gods and even, regretfully, before the happiness. She thought then - or perhaps she did not, perhaps those thoughts did not come until later - how beautiful and peaceful it all seemed and how amazing it would be to be able to a part of something that seemed so endless even if it was only for a moment. She could just go in and swim, swim until her limbs could no longer handle it and then she would float and the currents would carry her away as she listened to the sounds around. But she'd been afraid, and still now, so afraid that were she to go in it would be the end and so she'd stood at the water's edge and watched as the waves hit the sand. The reality is this: there is nothing peaceful about the ocean, it is vast and endless and harsh and unforgiving. Her little boy, just a small child, had done nothing wrong, nor had she, and yet still it would claim them, victims of the water. But for now she swims, to the light in the distance, to safety and hope, to the beginning and the end. (With the horrible past behind her but no real future ahead.) She'd stopped when she'd realized that her little boy was already down, that his life had already come to an end and she'd closed her eyes then and expected the whole world to stop. (It did not, it kept turning, and it always kept turning no matter what happened to the people in it.) The sea gulls screamed above her, the light in the distance grew weaker and weaker - though that might have been her imagination - and the waves crashed around her and carried her away but she, she no longer cared. They'd sunk, down under and she'd closed her eyes and she'd tried to imagine what it would feel like if they were somewhere else. The ocean Gods surrounded her suddenly, those that came before her - and she wonders, briefly, how many others there had been in these vast waters, how many others had cried and begged and drowned and how many of them had actually been saved? (She thinks not many and the ocean is filled with the tears of the death and the ones that are living.) \"It will be alright,\" they whisper in her mind and in her child's \"you are save here and welcome among us, let it all go, it will all be alright.\" She'd been tired, she'd been done, and she'd been broken. She'd closed her eyes and allowed the Gods to carry her away. They'd surrounded them in the beginning, explaining everything to them and they had renamed them too (Leucothea her name would be from now on and this is how the people would know her, Ino would be a lost princess from a land far away who'd drowned in the ocean when her husband went mad. Or maybe they wouldn't even know that, maybe all they would know was her name and where she came from and perhaps, someday, even that would be forgotten.) Her name could not be Ino anymore, for Ino had drowned in the waves, she had not made it to the light in the distance. She had been a princess, once, a beautiful princess who had loved a man with all her heart and given him two beautiful boys and she had been so happy, and so at peace. Leucothea was someone else, no longer that innocent little girl. You'll aide sailors, they told her, sailors in distress and you'll make sure they're safe. And so she did. *~* The night the world fell apart it was freezing. It was odd to for she never thinks it had actually been that cold before - and perhaps, just maybe, it really hadn't been, perhaps she'd imagined the cold just like she had imagined so many other things. Perhaps it had been a warning, from a God on their side, or perhaps Hera had wanted to scare her. And she should have known it was coming, she should have known because one does not simply anger the Gods - and if one does one must always expect that something would happen to the live they had built. An hour before the night felt he'd turned to her with a strange look in his eyes and perhaps if she had not been that naive, that loving, the stupid she would have realized that something would go wrong and she would have called for the guards. (The guards that never came during the night, the guards that never remembered they were meant to protect.) (She'd once believed, long ago, that their love could withstand anything and perhaps it could for she still loved him but forgiveness was not something she would ever grand him.) Now she knows what she saw in his eyes: madness and rage. Not his own but powerful indeed. And she had allowed to leave then, hadn't moved to stop him because she had believed, naively, that that was the best. She thinks sometimes that it would all have been different if she had stopped, perhaps they would all still live in their castle happy with the life they had been given or perhaps she too would now be dead. The night fell then, the cold, cold night and she'd lain in bed and waited, in vain, for him to return. He had not and as the sky grew darker and she grew more afraid she'd realized that she could not wait for something to happen. She'd made her way, silently, across the halls, thinking, idly, that if she checked on her children surely she would feel better. In the distance she'd heard a scream, so filled with rage it had stopped her heard and she had known it was Athamas but she had not known who was at the receiving end of his newfound rage. She felt sorry for whomever it was for surely they would be in shock, her husband was, after all, known for his calm nature and his patience beyond all others. She found him, knife in hand, in her oldest son's room. Her son, her beautiful little boy - who was not so little anymore - lay dead at his father's feet, the rage still burning in his eyes. Ino had known then that this was their punishment; this was what the Goddess Hera visited on them for daring to take in Dionysus and caring for him. They had taken care of a child they should not have and in turn they'd lose their own. The scream that left her lips was just as loud, just as harsh and just as inhuman as the murderous scream from her husband had been before. She would have buckled, fallen to the ground and screamed and held her boy until her husband - her beloved husband who would wake later and realize what he had done - murdered her as well, she would have but she'd remembered then, her younger boy, her hope, in a bed not that far away. And so she'd run, her hair in the wind, her heart beating loudly, tears running down her cheeks and behind her, her husband in a murderous rage. She'd found her boy, eyes wide open in fear, in his crib and she'd run again with her bade in her arms. The ocean had been vast under her and she could see nothing in sight and she'd known then if she jumped she would die and if she stayed she would too (but her husband had done nothing wrong and perhaps he would wake soon and save them, perhaps someone else would, she did not believe it, not really, but she'd hoped.)She'd run again past the trees and leapt of a cliff into the vast ocean below. She remembers thinking; at least she thinks she does, that it seemed wrong somehow, that she who had loved the ocean so much and had once considered it save would now die in its waters. And that her son, her oldest, who'd loved the ocean just like her, would die alone in his room and her youngest would drown in the ocean of which he was so afraid. But there was no changing it, and no changing her mind, for in that moment she believed - in the moment she'd leapt to the ocean below - that drowning would be far better than dying by a husband's (or a father's) hand. And perhaps she had hoped, in the back of her mind, that someone would see them, that someone would save them that they would not have a watery grave. There was no changing that either. And it would have all been so much easier - to her, to the world, to her husband, to her family, to his - if she had never loved them at all. If she never truly loved him. But she had loved him, of course, and he had loved her - and it seemed so strange to think of the past, so strange for when she first met him she had disliked him intensely but she was a princess and she could not say no to marrying him. It matters little what she felt then of course, it never would matter at all. They had been happy then and now they were not. (And she loved him as he loved her and she hated him as he hated himself.) *~* Sometimes she sees him. Standing on the cliff, staring at the vast ocean his wife and child had leapt in. Sometimes she wishes she could touch him, reach across the vast ocean now separating them and hold him and comfort him. Other times she wishes she could use her powers to drag him into the ocean he so fears and make him pay for what he did to her, for what he took. The madness, the rage, that had so consumed him that night - that had caused him to slaughter his own beloved heir and watch, in satisfaction, as his wife and youngest jumped to their deaths - had long since fade, leaving in its wake grief and guilt. He stands on the cliff and stares at the ocean and he waits. Perhaps he's hoping she'll return, perhaps he hopes - against better knowing - that they live, that they're somewhere out there in the world and that they can still claim the world they'd wanted to build. His guards, his friends, his people, urge him to return to his castle, to go back to being who he was before, to being the king of Thebes and helping his people live their lives. But his grieve is to great, his guilt to vast, and all he does - day in, day out - is stand on the cliff and watch the waves hit the rock beneath him. And she would see him - but her son would, could not - but he could not see her and they would forever be parted by the ocean that had saved her and her son. The love they had once shared, the beautiful all-consuming love that had been so promising had faded and left them with screams and anger and guilt. They would never be one again, they would never hold each other and love each and be more. She would forever roam the seas, helping those that needed her and he would stand on the cliff's edge until he no longer could and then, one day, he would leap like she did before but the Gods would not save him. He would drown and she would hold him but he would not know for he could not and then he would be gone, gone forever and she would grieve and she would rejoice (for he was her love, her one and only, her only one and he was her son's slayer too and her would-be slayer and that it was not him but Hera who led his hands changed nothing of what happened.) Sometimes she wonders if perhaps he did not jump, perhaps he went back home and married another girl and had more children. And she would have hated that, more than she hated his end, for if he had stolen her happiness he could have none of his own. But of course he drowned so that never mattered at all. *~* She drowns, babe in arms, in the massive ocean. But she rises too. *~* Longer ago, or maybe not that long ago, maybe at the same time or maybe after, she does not know. She does not care. The meadow is filled with the most beautiful flowers and she sits in the middle and stares at the sky above - sometimes she runs with the nymphs and plays, sometimes she sings, sometimes she lies down and closes her eyes. Kore they call her, the maiden, for it is who she was then and it is who she had intended to be forever (or for a very long time indeed.) She had run behind the nymphs, her laughter filling the air and she had thought of her mother, far up on Olympus, awaiting her return but she still had a few hours. She would remember this, always, as the last moment of her innocence and her childhood and we she thought of it, later, she tried to forget what came after. There had no warning, none at all. (Or perhaps there had been and she had been too young, to naive, to fully understand them and so she had not told her mother who would have understood.) He came suddenly, with no warning, from somewhere behind her - and far, far down below - and he'd grabbed and she, she had screamed. Or perhaps she had not, perhaps she had been too shocked for sound to leave her lips and instead she had kicked, and struggled and watched as the nymphs ran behind her to save her but it was not enough, it would never be enough. She had not known until later that it was Hades who was dragging her to his domain, Hades who had seen her in this same meadow weeks ago and had fallen in love, Hades who had decided that he wanted her. And he had known, then, that her mother would never say yes and that she would not either and so he had taken right in his hands and he had kidnapped her and taken her to the world down below. And the nymphs had screamed, and the nymphs had cried but they had not saved her. Once they'd arrived in his world and domain he had released her and offered her the world, everything she wanted it would all be hers, she would be the queen of the Underworld if she were just to consent to marry him. It was dark and cold, no light from the world above, no flowers, no nymphs, nothing that would make her happy. Persephone had no desire to live in the dark, she preferred the sun far above and the meadows and her mother and all it had to offer. And Hades had said that it was alright that he would wait until she realized that the world he offered was far better than the world up above (but it was not, and yet it was, for him but not for her.) Her mother would come, she was sure, but then she'd realized that she could not, for how would her mother know where to look? There was a flower in her hand, which had not fallen in the struggle, and she watched silently as it died in the dark. She feared she would to, she feared that everything was dead in Hades's domain. *~* The world of above withered and died as she waited in the world down below. But she did not know this. She did not know of the despair of her mother on learning that her beloved child was gone, taken by a man none had recognized. And how she searched night and day, aided by Aramis, but no matter where they looked they could not find her. Torches guided the way but nothing could bring them to where the child had been taken. The world withered, the world died, the grain died and the people starved, the flowers withered and faded away. The people begged, the people screamed, they went to the temples and begged the Goddess why but Demeter, who had cared for the humans by giving them food, did not care for them anymore. She cared solely for the search of her child. Until the day, the night, the morning, she does not remember - and Persephone down in the Underworld does not actually know - Zeus give in, having had enough of the screaming of man and told his sister, in hushed voice, that Hades had taken her to the world down below. And Demeter, always so kind, always so busy with everything she had to do and nothing else, screamed in anger and in disgust. She told her brother, the most powerful of Gods, that it was his job to ensure that Hades, their brother, returned her daughter at once. And so the message came to the Underworld to allow the child to come back to where she belonged. The answer came swiftly and said \"she cannot for she has consumed the food of the Underworld.\" And Demeter wept, Demeter begged and Zeus called forth a council to listen to the tale and bring judgment upon the Goddess who had eaten in the domain of Hades. And she had stood at one side of the room, wanting to reach over, to run to where she was and hold her and love her and never let go but Zeus's word was law and so she waited until there was nothing more. *~* He had been kind to her, at times. He had offered her everything there was to offer, he had shown her the whole Underworld and though she'd thought, idly, that if he had been any other man (with another domain up in the world where she could see and feel the sunlight) that she would perhaps have considered marrying him, if her mother would consent. But she was made for the world of above, not the one below, and so nothing he showed her, nothing he had could sway her from the path she had set for herself. Let me go home, she'd begged day and night - though she could not truly tell when it was day and when it was night - and he'd answered, every time, you are home now. She'd sat beside the remains of the flower she'd had with her and waited. The screaming of the death and the lost and the barking of the Cerberus was almost too much for her. But she waited, patiently, for the mother she knew would come. Then, finally, the message came, from Zeus himself telling his brother to let the girl come home to where she belonged. And she'd rejoiced, imagining the world already and he had seemed resigned to losing her (though he had never truly had her) and as a last gift he offered her a handful of pomegranate seeds, just so she would have eaten something of his domain. And she had not understood, she had not known. All she had known is that he had been kind to her, at times, and he had shown her the wonders of his domain. And she'd imagined that if there was light and flowers, she might have considered marrying him. And now she was leaving, to the world above, and he'd looked resigned but sad too (a trick, of course, to make her eat) and so, to make him somewhat happy, she had eaten tree seeds, because she truly did not wish to eat at all. He had smiled then and send the messenger back. She had eaten, she could not leave. He'd taken her to Zeus, to stand before the council so that they could decree her faith, and her mother had cried (from so far away because she could no longer reach her.) The nymphs, even farther away, whimpered and Zeus had stood and asked questions and she hadn't lied (though she wishes she had.) In the end, when it was it done, it was decreed that since she had only eaten tree seeds she need only spend three months in the world below - with her new husband the king of the Underworld - and the rest she could spend basking in the sun at her mother's side. And Hades, Hades had smiled because he had what he wanted and he'd told her later that she too should smile because she too had what she wanted and they should rejoice for the fact that it had all worked out (though he wished she'd never have to leave him.) He gave her a garden, to do as she pleased. He gave her all she wanted except of course for what she wanted the most. He could not give her the sunlight, for it was not a part of his domain and since his domain was that of darkness and the death sunlight was the one thing she could not have. Most of the flowers she loved, most of the plants she loved, could not bloom in the Underworld and so she was left with whatever flowers could - the ones Hades himself had brought here. She wishes desperately her mother would come down but she does not - angry as she is at Hades and saddened by her daughter being trapped in his domain. *~* And the world withered, and the world died, as Demeter mourned her daughter's absence. And the people suffered. But then she would rise, from the world down below, back to the world from which she had come and the world would grow once again. The grain would be better, the flowers would bloom and the world would know how happy Demeter was to have her daughter back. And so it would stay, basking in it's glory, until the too soon day where Persephone, though she did not wish to -at least at first, eventually she grew to like the world down below enough to not be sad every time she went down though her mother always was - went down, back to the Underworld. And then the world would wither again, and it would die. And the people, the people would grow accustomed to this until one day they could no longer recall it had ever been different. (But Persephone could and so could Demeter, and they would never forget a time when they had always been together.) *~* She would fall in the winter into her husband's arms and rise in the spring into her mother's love. Forever she'd be a part of both worlds and yet in the end she would belong in neither. (And the nymphs played in the meadow forever and always and Persephone; Persephone forgot what it was like to be so innocent.) *~* The boat made its way across the water, leaving behind it her hometown of Knossos. Ariadne stood there and looked ahead or at the ocean's below but never, not once, did she look back. For fear that if she did she would she her father standing angrily on the shore, screaming for her to return (if he'd noticed she was gone at all) but also for fear of not seeing him standing there, of finally being shown that the man that was supposed to love her the most did not care at all. (And also for fear of seeing ships that would follow them and make this boat sink and leave her lost, with her new love, at the bottom of the sea.) So she looked ahead at the time to come, at the world she was building with Theseus at the live she was about to start - sometimes she looked at the ocean below and wondered what it would mean to never be alone. Theseus stood behind her, his arms around, pointing the world around them and telling her all the things he would give (the whole world, he'd promised her the whole world.) They did not talk about what came before - never, ever, ever - they only talked about what supposedly laid ahead. (She had sacrificed everything for him - her world, her family, her future, her land - and she had given him all her love and in return she expected nothing less.) They knew her betrayal was great and that she could not return. And they knew she had done because she loved him. (He's supposed to be the hero of the tale; he's supposed to be her hero not a selfish bastard.) He'd grabbed her hand on the shore and he'd whispered in her ear that it would all be alright, that she need not stay - for the punishment would be far too great - and that they could go anywhere they wanted and he'd promised, he'd promised her the world. And she had believed, she had smiled and believed and allowed him to take her on ship and sail away - and she had imagined it all, the future she would have the lands she would see and the love they would share forevermore. (Oh, how naive.) She stood all day and watched everything (for in her young life she had not seen much at all - and sometimes Theseus behind her or beside her and she believed all he said. They'd sailed, desperate he was to reach his homeland and reunite with his father, until one moment they'd seen a light that had led them to an island. Ariadne had never seen anything of the world, all of it was new and Theseus said: \"I'll show it to you.\" Sometimes, not often but sometimes, she thinks that that had always been his idea, that he'd always known that island would come and that he had known, from the moment he took her, that that is where he would leave her. And though she had learned later that he was selfish and cared not for her and that his intend had always to leave her behind she had never truly known if he had decided, from the beginning, where it was that he would leave her. Perhaps it was just convenience. He's shown her things on the island she had never seen and things she already had. He'd laid her on the ground and they'd slept, as the waves hit the rocks and she'd dreamed that she was floating, peacefully and happy in the massive ocean. (And she had thought, then, how lucky am I to have found a man so deserving of love, such a grand hero, and such a surprise to be deserving of his love.) She had slept through the sunrise and the waking of the birds, she had slept through the talking of the man and the leaving of the ship and then, suddenly, she had woken alone. She had given him all and he had waited, laid down on the ground beside her and waited until her dreams took over and then he had slipped away (like he had always intended to.) Disappeared into the darkness, onto the ship that would sail him home and he did not look back, not even once. (She wonders, at times, if he ever felt guilty, if he ever thought about poor Ariadne whom he had left on that island and if he ever wondered if she had turned out alright.) Far away, into the horizon, where she could barely still see it, was the boat disappearing from view. (She had screamed but they had not heard and she wonders if they would have turned if they had; probably not.) There was silence all around her, or maybe, actually, there wasn't. The waves crashed against the rocks and the birds sang in the sky, the sea gulls screamed and far, far away she could hear voices (maybe.) She had fallen on her knees, too weak to stand - this she knows though she does not remember - and she had screamed. (Before she'd curled in a ball and no longer moved, before she stayed there on the ground and never went away.) Maybe she had not screamed, maybe she just thinks she had. Maybe the world around her had ceased to exist when her love sailed away. Maybe she had died, alone on that island. Maybe she had lived, with heartache and pain (and broken heart that threatened to tear her apart.) Maybe, just maybe, this was all a dream and he had not left her at all, maybe she'd wake in a moment and he would be by her side, whispering reassurances into her ear and the world would turn right again. Maybe none of it had happened, maybe she would wake in her room in Knossos and the dream would be nothing but a warning, a tale of what could be if she saved the boy in the maze (and maybe in that world she would let him die, maybe she would save him still.) Maybe her father had send people after her, maybe they would come here and tear her apart or return her home and allow her father to tear her apart. (Perhaps they'd feel sorry for her, but she does not truly believe this, perhaps they would say that her broken heart was punishment enough.) Maybe she could jump into the ocean below and just sink. *~* She had cried, she had curled up and screamed, she had been lost in the ocean of her tears. (And she had drowned in her despair, in her pain, in her tears, she had drowned but she had still been there.) This was not how the tale was meant to go, this was not how she imagined it would go, the girl would fall for the hero and the hero would be kind and chivalrous and they would be happy. The hero - kind and good - was not meant to leave his love, if she was that at all, on an island with no way out, in the middle of the night with a broken heart. (A hero was not meant to be selfish, a hero was meant to think of others - but then she had only known the tales that were told.) She needed him, she loved him but he did not need her nor did he love her in any way and so, instead of speaking, instead of telling, he had lied and then he had sailed away back to the world he came from. (She should not have saved him, she should have chosen someone else or perhaps, the smarter plan would have been not to save anyone at all.) She should have gotten up - after that first day passed and turned back into night - should have gotten up and moved. Should have gone to the world of the living and tried, but she had been scared and alone and broken and hurt so she had not; she had stayed there and listened to the waves and waited for the end to come (for it would come.) That night she dreamed of the ocean but she no longer felt safe, she dreamed she was sinking into the vast ocean and far away from her, where she could still see him, was Theseus and she had called to him, somehow, and he had turned and just watched her sink and then he'd gone away. (She wonders how people will tell the tale, if they tell it at all, and she imagines that no matter how many times it changes one thing will remain the same: he will be the hero of the tale even if he is not.) This is what he did, the truth in her dream and her reality, he had promised her everything and he had let her behind to drown in the sorrow that he'd created himself. (And then, perhaps, he had laughed.) She had woken in tears, with sorrow in her heart but she had not been alone. A God sat beside her, Dionysus his name was (he'd said) and he'd tried her tears and promised her the world, promised her everything. He'd told her she should not cry for the likes of a hero that could not appreciate the beautiful women she was. And then he'd carried her away and given her the world. (And she'd laughed and been happy.) *~* Aeria had learned the tales - of Gods and heroes and the ordinary people whose lives they messed with - at her grandmother's feet. Her grandmother was a fountain of knowledge about the Gods and her storytelling abilities were wonderful. She hadn't been the only sitting there, her friends would come as well but her siblings never cared enough to hear all the tales again. (Sometimes, after her grandmother was done talking, she'd ask her if those stories really happened and her grandmother would look at her and say: of course they did, my dear child, of course they did. But Aeria wasn't sure, didn't know, if she'd ever actually believed that.) Her grandmother had loved the tale of the contest between Poseidon and Athena to be the patron saint of the town they knew as Athens. Her best friend Livia loved the tale of Troje the most (and of Helen who had started it all.) Aeria loved the tale of Aphrodite's birth, of her rise from the sea foam as her father was castrated by his son. (She had begged, over and over again when she was younger for her grandmother to tell that story and her grandmother had, time and again, dutifully told it to her.) That however was long ago, back when they were children and those tales matter, back when she believed they were real (and perhaps a part of her still does.) Now she is older, now they are older, now they are grown and she understands more, now she knows that the Gods don't always do good things and heroes aren't always heroes. (She still goes to Aphrodite's temple just in case they are listening.) Her grandmother had died long ago, her tales lost in the wind and no matter how hard she tried Aeria had never really been able to tell them the way her beloved grandmother had. The tales of the ocean were the ones told the most. (But they all end in tears, Aeria thinks now, or perhaps they do not, perhaps she only remembers those that do.) A times she, they'd wondered - she and Livia - as they stood at the water's edge and looked over the massive ocean if the Gods looked down upon them and were deciding, perhaps in that moment, if they were important to them or not. Livia had always wanted to believe that someday they would be that they would sail away and have their own adventures but Aeria had always rather suspected that to the Gods they never mattered at all, that they were nothing but another worshiper. (She'd joined Livia in imagining their adventures but she'd never believed they'd go on one.) She's not special, not to them, not to the world, not to anyone. (Not to anyone but her grandmother that is.) Her mother too told her tales but those were not well-known, just stories of people she had once cared about that were no longer there at all. (And the world at large would not hear those tales, nor would they care they but she had learned them and she'd carried them in her heart and for a while at least it seemed they mattered.) Her mother told the tale of Syria, one of her friends, who had fallen in love with a man who lived on an island far away. She had worn white on her wedding and she had been the most beautiful girl in all the land and then she had kissed her best friend goodbye and she had sailed away to her husband's home. They had lived, her mother tells her, near a lighthouse that belonged to his family - and Aeria had at times imagined what that light would look like, how many lost sailors it would save and how many it would destroy. They had been happy, they had been at peace. Until one day she'd left to see her mother, who'd begged for a visit, and she had promised him she would return as fast as she could. But that night, they say, Poseidon had been angry - why nobody knows and Aeria wonders at times if Poseidon had ever understood what his anger did or if he cared about it at all - and her ship had not been able to withstand the storm he created. (But then no ship on the sea that night, near where she was, had been able to withstand it and Aeria hears this tale of the one girl who died and wonders how many others lost their lives that night.) Her ship had gone down in the waves and she had drowned (her eyes closed her mother said, though she cannot know this, her eyes closed imagining a better time.) She had never been found. And her husband, her love had stood on the shore and watched the ship sail away and then he had gone back to his life and waited for her to return. The storm had grown and it had scared him and he had stood there watching the seas hoping to see her ship return and hoping she had decided to wait until it had passed or not return at all (for then, at least, she would have lived.) He had been lost to them all once he learned the truth, her mother told her, and he'd drowned in his grief. He has spent the next year sitting on the island, staring at the world around him and imagined seeing her everywhere. He had gone crazy, the people whispered, and they felt sorry for him but none, ever, tried to help. They had too much to do, too much to take care of in their own lives to care about a man who had lost it all. (And Aeria never asks if her mother had cared for him, if she had tried to reach the man her friend had loved so much or if she too, like all others, had deemed her problems more important - and perhaps they even were.) One night, her mother whispers, he could no longer stand it and so he'd leapt head first into the ocean and he had drowned. Aeria likes to imagine he had gone to the underworld and he had found her there and they were, somehow, happy. And she had wondered what the difference was between Syria and those that had come before. Why had, she wonders, Ino been saved and not her mother's friend? Surely she was just as kind and her death just as undeserving, just as random. Perhaps there was really no reason why some were saved, perhaps it was just the moment it happened, and perhaps it was all just a simple coincidence. She'd asked nothing though about that and she'd just imagined what it would be like to love someone so much you were unable to live without them. (And she had wondered, then too, if she would someday have a love like that. If somebody would one day look at her and declare her the one, the everything, the only one that would ever matter.) *~* Livia sailed away with her brother one day. Her brother was going to Athens and they needed to go by boat, over the ocean, and Livia - who had been dreaming of the day she could see the world - had decided to go with him. She had asked Aeria to come too but she had been too afraid, to determine to stay with her mother to even think about sailing away. And so Livia had promised her thousands of tales and that someday, when she came back, they would sail away together and see the world. (And they'd meet Gods, Livia would say, and Heroes but they would live their own lives just like they wanted to. Aeria liked the idea, the plan, but she's not sure she believed in it.) She had stood on the shore and watched the ship disappear into the horizon. (And she had wished, desperately, that she had been strong enough, brave enough to go with her.) She had stayed in her home, as Livia sailed across the seas; she had stayed as sickness swept across their tiny island and took her mother far away (and left her in charge of her younger siblings and in that moment she was glad that she had not gone for if she had they would have died.) Every day, whenever she had time - sometimes at night when her house became too small - she stood on the shore where she had stood before and waited for a ship to appear in the horizon but none ever did. (Ships appeared on that horizon but never, not once, did they bring her best friend.) And so she waited, as her old house fell apart around her, she waited or the best friend's return. As night turned into day, and days into weeks, and then into months and then a year. (And then another, and then three, and in the end she waited five whole years.) Her siblings grew and learned to take care of themselves - Alicia married a young man that lived not that far away, Aeria likes him he's kind and treats her with respect, Lucinda married another man, a little older, and though at times he treats her well there are times that Aeria would like to kill him for hurting her (slowly, preferably.) Man came for her too sometimes, one in particular - broad shouldered, tanned and smiling all the time - but she turned them away, waiting as she was for the return of her friend and the start of the live they had imagined (perhaps, she thought, perhaps if she told him he would tell her he was coming, perhaps he would say that he could sail away with her. But she suspected that she and Livia were the only ones who really wanted to go.) She waited, live went on, the house fell apart and night turned into day. And then, five years after she'd waved goodbye, she'd finally relented and given up. Livia was not coming back, she'd realized, Livia had found something out there in the world (and she refused to even consider the possibility that Livia could not come back, that somewhere out there she had joined others in their watery graves) and it made her happy, so happy she never returned. She had thought then, at the shore staring over the ocean, that she would go to his house and tell him that yes she would like to get married, and he would fix their old house and they would live their lives together (and she would name her first daughter, whenever she came, after her best friend who'd left one day.)And so they did, and they grew old and Aeria would tell her children the stories her grandmother told - though she could never tell them well - and she would tell the tales her mother shared. And she would speak of her best friend who'd sailed away and never returned and had found her happiness and her adventure somewhere out there. (She imagined Livia on a boat or in a beautiful house, a man she loved by her side and children playing all around her. And she imagined that Livia sometimes thought about her and imagined her happy.) She still went to the shore every day and stared at the horizon for a while. You never know after all. *~* Livia sailed across the seas and saw the world. She saw things she could not describe and things she would never have believed existed if she had not seen them herself. She did not, however, find adventure in the way she had imagined, there were no heroes and no Gods, no impossible quests. (Perhaps, she thinks, it was just the men who were supposed to go on the quests.) She did however find adventure in another way, by meeting new people and seeing new lands, by sailing the seas and never knowing what would come next. And then, one day - after five years, five very long years in which she missed Aeria desperately at times and wished she had just come with her - her brother said: \"It's time to go home.\" There was still so much that Livia wanted to see, still so much she wanted to know. But she'd thought then, on that ship near the docks - two days from her home town - that's okay, we'll sail home and I'll convince Aeria to come with me. (Surely now she would do, surely now she was grown and she no longer needed to care for her siblings, surely now she would not fear.) And so they'd gone, back to where they came from and someone, she never remembers who, said they should sail to the left but her brother had said no - both ways would lead to home but the way the sailor said they should go would take a day or two more not that Livia really cared - and so they'd sailed the way her brother wanted to. There's a tale about a girl, Aeria's mother used to tell them, a young girl, with long beautiful hair that moved in the wind and beautiful piercing eyes - though nobody had looked in those in years. She had fallen in love with the prince of her dreams and they had married in a ceremony in the hills but then a war had broken out between her father's kingdom and his and he'd had to choose which way to go. And so he had sailed, to the land in the east, to talk with his father and calm him at least. She would speak to hers and they would relent and if they did not he would return and they would run away and they would build a new home in another world where they would be save. She talked to her father but he only grew angrier until one day he build a tower on the cliffs and locked her in, the door closed behind her and he'd said if her prince returned, if he did not side with his father, he would allow him to live with her in her tower on the cliffs. And so she had waited, staring out of the window at the ocean, but her love had never came. He had died in the attack her father had led, died even after he'd convinced his father peace was the way and her father never told her that he would never come. Instead he sends whispers of the betrayal of love, of her husband who had chosen the other side and left her to rot. She had died in that tower, alone and in pain but somehow she lingers, they say. Her song can still be heard, haunting the seas and any sailors that pass wish to give her peace. (They all drown in their haste for none think it through; none remember that she had died long ago.) She had not believed the story, though Aeria had, and truthfully shad forgotten that that story supposedly took place near their home. Now she believes, now that it's too late, as the song fills the air and shatters her heart. Her brother and his crew go towards the tower - that still stands though it looks worn and old and she swears it will fall apart at any minute - to save a girl no longer there and she pleads, and she talks, but they ignore everything she says (she thinks perhaps this is the revenge of the princess, who had believed she had been abandoned and now killed all those that passed.) Livia closed her eyes as the ship went down and imagined she was somewhere else. She imagined she was with Aeria and they were sailing the seas and seeing it's wonders, she imagined they'd stopped in a beautiful town and lived there for years, she imagined they travelled by land as well and seen all there was to offer. She even imagined, as the current carried her towards the tower, that she had never left at all, that she had waited until Aeria was ready to leave. She imagined that she wasn't drowning but floating and that another ship would come and save her, she imagined it would take her home and she would see her best friend and she would tell her how much she loved her and how much she missed her and they would sail away to their future together. But of course none of that happened. Of course she drowned as the haunting song filled the air. *~* Livia's floating. And yet maybe she's not. Maybe she's drowning like so many before her, maybe the floating is in her imagination. Maybe she swims, desperately towards the shore, like Ino before her (but Ino rises out of the ocean and becomes more.) Maybe she's like Aeria, save on an island, sad and waiting but, at least, safe. (Like Ariadne on another island, sad and broken but not drowning. But no God would come for Aeria, no God would make her his.) Maybe none of it is real, maybe it's all a story. *~* Persephone falls and rises and the people feel her mother's despair, Ino saves the sailors as they drown in her domains. Ariadne sails the worlds with her God by her side and their lives are forever told in the tales of the land. But Aeria stays on her island and stares over the sea waiting for her a friend's return that could never be. But nobody would tell their story (of Livia & Aeria.) Nobody would care to know.",

      "The ocean Gods surrounded her suddenly, those that came before her - and she wonders, briefly, how many others there had been in these vast waters, how many others had cried and begged and drowned and how many of them had actually been saved?",

      "She'd closed her eyes and allowed the Gods to carry her away.",
      "They'd surrounded them in the beginning, explaining everything to them and they had renamed them too (Leucothea her name would be from now on and this is how the people would know her, Ino would be a lost princess from a land far away who'd drowned in the ocean when her husband went mad.",
      "Or maybe they wouldn't even know that, maybe all they would know was her name and where she came from and perhaps, someday, even that would be forgotten.)",

      "Perhaps it had been a warning, from a God on their side, or perhaps Hera had wanted to scare her.",

      "The night fell then, the cold, cold night and she'd lain in bed and waited, in vain, for him to return.",
      "He had not and as the sky grew darker and she grew more afraid she'd realized that she could not wait for something to happen.",
      "She'd made her way, silently, across the halls, thinking, idly, that if she checked on her children surely she would feel better.",
      "In the distance she'd heard a scream, so filled with rage it had stopped her heard and she had known it was Athamas but she had not known who was at the receiving end of his newfound rage.",
      "She felt sorry for whomever it was for surely they would be in shock, her husband was, after all, known for his calm nature and his patience beyond all others.",

      "Her son, her beautiful little boy - who was not so little anymore - lay dead at his father's feet, the rage still burning in his eyes.",
      "Ino had known then that this was their punishment; this was what the Goddess Hera visited on them for daring to take in Dionysus and caring for him.",
      "They had taken care of a child they should not have and in turn they'd lose their own.",
      "The scream that left her lips was just as loud, just as harsh and just as inhuman as the murderous scream from her husband had been before.",
      "She would have buckled, fallen to the ground and screamed and held her boy until her husband - her beloved husband who would wake later and realize what he had done - murdered her as well, she would have but she'd remembered then, her younger boy, her hope, in a bed not that far away.",
      "And so she'd run, her hair in the wind, her heart beating loudly, tears running down her cheeks and behind her, her husband in a murderous rage.",
      "She'd found her boy, eyes wide open in fear, in his crib and she'd run again with her bade in her arms.",
      "The ocean had been vast under her and she could see nothing in sight and she'd known then if she jumped she would die and if she stayed she would too (but her husband had done nothing wrong and perhaps he would wake soon and save them, perhaps someone else would, she did not believe it, not really, but she'd hoped.)She'd run again past the trees and leapt of a cliff into the vast ocean below.",
      "She remembers thinking; at least she thinks she does, that it seemed wrong somehow, that she who had loved the ocean so much and had once considered it save would now die in its waters.",
      "And that her son, her oldest, who'd loved the ocean just like her, would die alone in his room and her youngest would drown in the ocean of which he was so afraid.",
      "But there was no changing it, and no changing her mind, for in that moment she believed - in the moment she'd leapt to the ocean below - that drowning would be far better than dying by a husband's (or a father's) hand.",
      "And perhaps she had hoped, in the back of her mind, that someone would see them, that someone would save them that they would not have a watery grave.",
      "There was no changing that either.",
      "And it would have all been so much easier - to her, to the world, to her husband, to her family, to his - if she had never loved them at all.",
      "If she never truly loved him.",
      "But she had loved him, of course, and he had loved her - and it seemed so strange to think of the past, so strange for when she first met him she had disliked him intensely but she was a princess and she could not say no to marrying him.",
      "It matters little what she felt then of course, it never would matter at all.",
      "They had been happy then and now they were not.",

      "*~* Sometimes she sees him.",
      "Standing on the cliff, staring at the vast ocean his wife and child had leapt in.",
      "Sometimes she wishes she could touch him, reach across the vast ocean now separating them and hold him and comfort him.",
      "Other times she wishes she could use her powers to drag him into the ocean he so fears and make him pay for what he did to her, for what he took.",
      "The madness, the rage, that had so consumed him that night - that had caused him to slaughter his own beloved heir and watch, in satisfaction, as his wife and youngest jumped to their deaths - had long since fade, leaving in its wake grief and guilt.",
      "He stands on the cliff and stares at the ocean and he waits.",
      "Perhaps he's hoping she'll return, perhaps he hopes - against better knowing - that they live, that they're somewhere out there in the world and that they can still claim the world they'd wanted to build.",
      "His guards, his friends, his people, urge him to return to his castle, to go back to being who he was before, to being the king of Thebes and helping his people live their lives.",
      "But his grieve is to great, his guilt to vast, and all he does - day in, day out - is stand on the cliff and watch the waves hit the rock beneath him.",
      "And she would see him - but her son would, could not - but he could not see her and they would forever be parted by the ocean that had saved her and her son.",
      "The love they had once shared, the beautiful all-consuming love that had been so promising had faded and left them with screams and anger and guilt.",
      "They would never be one again, they would never hold each other and love each and be more.",
      "She would forever roam the seas, helping those that needed her and he would stand on the cliff's edge until he no longer could and then, one day, he would leap like she did before but the Gods would not save him.",
      "He would drown and she would hold him but he would not know for he could not and then he would be gone, gone forever and she would grieve and she would rejoice (for he was her love, her one and only, her only one and he was her son's slayer too and her would-be slayer and that it was not him but Hera who led his hands changed nothing of what happened.)",
      "Sometimes she wonders if perhaps he did not jump, perhaps he went back home and married another girl and had more children.",
      "And she would have hated that, more than she hated his end, for if he had stolen her happiness he could have none of his own.",
      "But of course he drowned so that never mattered at all.",
      "*~* She drowns, babe in arms, in the massive ocean.",
      "But she rises too.",
      "*~* Longer ago, or maybe not that long ago, maybe at the same time or maybe after, she does not know.",
      "She does not care.",
      "The meadow is filled with the most beautiful flowers and she sits in the middle and stares at the sky above - sometimes she runs with the nymphs and plays, sometimes she sings, sometimes she lies down and closes her eyes.",
      "Kore they call her, the maiden, for it is who she was then and it is who she had intended to be forever (or for a very long time indeed.)",
      "She had run behind the nymphs, her laughter filling the air and she had thought of her mother, far up on Olympus, awaiting her return but she still had a few hours.",
      "She would remember this, always, as the last moment of her innocence and her childhood and we she thought of it, later, she tried to forget what came after.",
      "There had no warning, none at all.",
      "(Or perhaps there had been and she had been too young, to naive, to fully understand them and so she had not told her mother who would have understood.)",
      "He came suddenly, with no warning, from somewhere behind her - and far, far down below - and he'd grabbed and she, she had screamed.",
      "Or perhaps she had not, perhaps she had been too shocked for sound to leave her lips and instead she had kicked, and struggled and watched as the nymphs ran behind her to save her but it was not enough, it would never be enough.",
      "She had not known until later that it was Hades who was dragging her to his domain, Hades who had seen her in this same meadow weeks ago and had fallen in love, Hades who had decided that he wanted her.",
      "And he had known, then, that her mother would never say yes and that she would not either and so he had taken right in his hands and he had kidnapped her and taken her to the world down below.",
      "And the nymphs had screamed, and the nymphs had cried but they had not saved her.",
      "Once they'd arrived in his world and domain he had released her and offered her the world, everything she wanted it would all be hers, she would be the queen of the Underworld if she were just to consent to marry him.",
      "It was dark and cold, no light from the world above, no flowers, no nymphs, nothing that would make her happy.",
      "Persephone had no desire to live in the dark, she preferred the sun far above and the meadows and her mother and all it had to offer.",
      "And Hades had said that it was alright that he would wait until she realized that the world he offered was far better than the world up above (but it was not, and yet it was, for him but not for her.)",
      "Her mother would come, she was sure, but then she'd realized that she could not, for how would her mother know where to look?",
      "There was a flower in her hand, which had not fallen in the struggle, and she watched silently as it died in the dark.",
      "She feared she would to, she feared that everything was dead in Hades's domain.",
      "*~* The world of above withered and died as she waited in the world down below.",
      "But she did not know this.",
      "She did not know of the despair of her mother on learning that her beloved child was gone, taken by a man none had recognized.",
      "And how she searched night and day, aided by Aramis, but no matter where they looked they could not find her.",
      "Torches guided the way but nothing could bring them to where the child had been taken.",
      "The world withered, the world died, the grain died and the people starved, the flowers withered and faded away.",
      "The people begged, the people screamed, they went to the temples and begged the Goddess why but Demeter, who had cared for the humans by giving them food, did not care for them anymore.",
      "She cared solely for the search of her child.",
      "Until the day, the night, the morning, she does not remember - and Persephone down in the Underworld does not actually know - Zeus give in, having had enough of the screaming of man and told his sister, in hushed voice, that Hades had taken her to the world down below.",
      "And Demeter, always so kind, always so busy with everything she had to do and nothing else, screamed in anger and in disgust.",
      "She told her brother, the most powerful of Gods, that it was his job to ensure that Hades, their brother, returned her daughter at once.",
      "And so the message came to the Underworld to allow the child to come back to where she belonged.",
      "The answer came swiftly and said \"she cannot for she has consumed the food of the Underworld.\"",
      "And Demeter wept, Demeter begged and Zeus called forth a council to listen to the tale and bring judgment upon the Goddess who had eaten in the domain of Hades.",
      "And she had stood at one side of the room, wanting to reach over, to run to where she was and hold her and love her and never let go but Zeus's word was law and so she waited until there was nothing more.",
      "*~* He had been kind to her, at times.",
      "He had offered her everything there was to offer, he had shown her the whole Underworld and though she'd thought, idly, that if he had been any other man (with another domain up in the world where she could see and feel the sunlight) that she would perhaps have considered marrying him, if her mother would consent.",
      "But she was made for the world of above, not the one below, and so nothing he showed her, nothing he had could sway her from the path she had set for herself.",
      "Let me go home, she'd begged day and night - though she could not truly tell when it was day and when it was night - and he'd answered, every time, you are home now.",
      "She'd sat beside the remains of the flower she'd had with her and waited.",
      "The screaming of the death and the lost and the barking of the Cerberus was almost too much for her.",
      "But she waited, patiently, for the mother she knew would come.",
      "Then, finally, the message came, from Zeus himself telling his brother to let the girl come home to where she belonged.",
      "And she'd rejoiced, imagining the world already and he had seemed resigned to losing her (though he had never truly had her) and as a last gift he offered her a handful of pomegranate seeds, just so she would have eaten something of his domain.",
      "And she had not understood, she had not known.",
      "All she had known is that he had been kind to her, at times, and he had shown her the wonders of his domain.",
      "And she'd imagined that if there was light and flowers, she might have considered marrying him.",
      "And now she was leaving, to the world above, and he'd looked resigned but sad too (a trick, of course, to make her eat) and so, to make him somewhat happy, she had eaten tree seeds, because she truly did not wish to eat at all.",
      "He had smiled then and send the messenger back.",
      "She had eaten, she could not leave.",
      "He'd taken her to Zeus, to stand before the council so that they could decree her faith, and her mother had cried (from so far away because she could no longer reach her.)",
      "The nymphs, even farther away, whimpered and Zeus had stood and asked questions and she hadn't lied (though she wishes she had.)",
      "In the end, when it was it done, it was decreed that since she had only eaten tree seeds she need only spend three months in the world below - with her new husband the king of the Underworld - and the rest she could spend basking in the sun at her mother's side.",
      "And Hades, Hades had smiled because he had what he wanted and he'd told her later that she too should smile because she too had what she wanted and they should rejoice for the fact that it had all worked out (though he wished she'd never have to leave him.)",
      "He gave her a garden, to do as she pleased.",
      "He gave her all she wanted except of course for what she wanted the most.",
      "He could not give her the sunlight, for it was not a part of his domain and since his domain was that of darkness and the death sunlight was the one thing she could not have.",
      "Most of the flowers she loved, most of the plants she loved, could not bloom in the Underworld and so she was left with whatever flowers could - the ones Hades himself had brought here.",
      "She wishes desperately her mother would come down but she does not - angry as she is at Hades and saddened by her daughter being trapped in his domain.",
      "*~* And the world withered, and the world died, as Demeter mourned her daughter's absence.",
      "And the people suffered.",
      "But then she would rise, from the world down below, back to the world from which she had come and the world would grow once again.",
      "The grain would be better, the flowers would bloom and the world would know how happy Demeter was to have her daughter back.",
      "And so it would stay, basking in it's glory, until the too soon day where Persephone, though she did not wish to -at least at first, eventually she grew to like the world down below enough to not be sad every time she went down though her mother always was - went down, back to the Underworld.",
      "And then the world would wither again, and it would die.",
      "And the people, the people would grow accustomed to this until one day they could no longer recall it had ever been different.",
      "(But Persephone could and so could Demeter, and they would never forget a time when they had always been together.)",
      "*~* She would fall in the winter into her husband's arms and rise in the spring into her mother's love.",
      "Forever she'd be a part of both worlds and yet in the end she would belong in neither.",
      "(And the nymphs played in the meadow forever and always and Persephone; Persephone forgot what it was like to be so innocent.)",
      "*~* The boat made its way across the water, leaving behind it her hometown of Knossos.",
      "Ariadne stood there and looked ahead or at the ocean's below but never, not once, did she look back.",
      "For fear that if she did she would she her father standing angrily on the shore, screaming for her to return (if he'd noticed she was gone at all) but also for fear of not seeing him standing there, of finally being shown that the man that was supposed to love her the most did not care at all.",
      "(And also for fear of seeing ships that would follow them and make this boat sink and leave her lost, with her new love, at the bottom of the sea.)",
      "So she looked ahead at the time to come, at the world she was building with Theseus at the live she was about to start - sometimes she looked at the ocean below and wondered what it would mean to never be alone.",
      "Theseus stood behind her, his arms around, pointing the world around them and telling her all the things he would give (the whole world, he'd promised her the whole world.)",
      "They did not talk about what came before - never, ever, ever - they only talked about what supposedly laid ahead.",
      "(She had sacrificed everything for him - her world, her family, her future, her land - and she had given him all her love and in return she expected nothing less.)",
      "They knew her betrayal was great and that she could not return.",
      "And they knew she had done because she loved him.",
      "(He's supposed to be the hero of the tale; he's supposed to be her hero not a selfish bastard.)",
      "He'd grabbed her hand on the shore and he'd whispered in her ear that it would all be alright, that she need not stay - for the punishment would be far too great - and that they could go anywhere they wanted and he'd promised, he'd promised her the world.",
      "And she had believed, she had smiled and believed and allowed him to take her on ship and sail away - and she had imagined it all, the future she would have the lands she would see and the love they would share forevermore.",
      "(Oh, how naive.)",
      "She stood all day and watched everything (for in her young life she had not seen much at all - and sometimes Theseus behind her or beside her and she believed all he said.",
      "They'd sailed, desperate he was to reach his homeland and reunite with his father, until one moment they'd seen a light that had led them to an island.",
      "Ariadne had never seen anything of the world, all of it was new and Theseus said: \"I'll show it to you.\"",
      "Sometimes, not often but sometimes, she thinks that that had always been his idea, that he'd always known that island would come and that he had known, from the moment he took her, that that is where he would leave her.",
      "And though she had learned later that he was selfish and cared not for her and that his intend had always to leave her behind she had never truly known if he had decided, from the beginning, where it was that he would leave her.",
      "Perhaps it was just convenience.",
      "He's shown her things on the island she had never seen and things she already had.",
      "He'd laid her on the ground and they'd slept, as the waves hit the rocks and she'd dreamed that she was floating, peacefully and happy in the massive ocean.",
      "(And she had thought, then, how lucky am I to have found a man so deserving of love, such a grand hero, and such a surprise to be deserving of his love.)",
      "She had slept through the sunrise and the waking of the birds, she had slept through the talking of the man and the leaving of the ship and then, suddenly, she had woken alone.",
      "She had given him all and he had waited, laid down on the ground beside her and waited until her dreams took over and then he had slipped away (like he had always intended to.)",
      "Disappeared into the darkness, onto the ship that would sail him home and he did not look back, not even once.",
      "(She wonders, at times, if he ever felt guilty, if he ever thought about poor Ariadne whom he had left on that island and if he ever wondered if she had turned out alright.)",
      "Far away, into the horizon, where she could barely still see it, was the boat disappearing from view.",
      "(She had screamed but they had not heard and she wonders if they would have turned if they had; probably not.)",
      "There was silence all around her, or maybe, actually, there wasn't.",
      "The waves crashed against the rocks and the birds sang in the sky, the sea gulls screamed and far, far away she could hear voices (maybe.)",
      "She had fallen on her knees, too weak to stand - this she knows though she does not remember - and she had screamed.",
      "(Before she'd curled in a ball and no longer moved, before she stayed there on the ground and never went away.)",
      "Maybe she had not screamed, maybe she just thinks she had.",
      "Maybe the world around her had ceased to exist when her love sailed away.",
      "Maybe she had died, alone on that island.",
      "Maybe she had lived, with heartache and pain (and broken heart that threatened to tear her apart.)",
      "Maybe, just maybe, this was all a dream and he had not left her at all, maybe she'd wake in a moment and he would be by her side, whispering reassurances into her ear and the world would turn right again.",
      "Maybe none of it had happened, maybe she would wake in her room in Knossos and the dream would be nothing but a warning, a tale of what could be if she saved the boy in the maze (and maybe in that world she would let him die, maybe she would save him still.)",
      "Maybe her father had send people after her, maybe they would come here and tear her apart or return her home and allow her father to tear her apart.",
      "(Perhaps they'd feel sorry for her, but she does not truly believe this, perhaps they would say that her broken heart was punishment enough.)",
      "Maybe she could jump into the ocean below and just sink.",
      "*~* She had cried, she had curled up and screamed, she had been lost in the ocean of her tears.",
      "(And she had drowned in her despair, in her pain, in her tears, she had drowned but she had still been there.)",
      "This was not how the tale was meant to go, this was not how she imagined it would go, the girl would fall for the hero and the hero would be kind and chivalrous and they would be happy.",
      "The hero - kind and good - was not meant to leave his love, if she was that at all, on an island with no way out, in the middle of the night with a broken heart.",
      "(A hero was not meant to be selfish, a hero was meant to think of others - but then she had only known the tales that were told.)",
      "She needed him, she loved him but he did not need her nor did he love her in any way and so, instead of speaking, instead of telling, he had lied and then he had sailed away back to the world he came from.",
      "(She should not have saved him, she should have chosen someone else or perhaps, the smarter plan would have been not to save anyone at all.)",
      "She should have gotten up - after that first day passed and turned back into night - should have gotten up and moved.",
      "Should have gone to the world of the living and tried, but she had been scared and alone and broken and hurt so she had not; she had stayed there and listened to the waves and waited for the end to come (for it would come.)",
      "That night she dreamed of the ocean but she no longer felt safe, she dreamed she was sinking into the vast ocean and far away from her, where she could still see him, was Theseus and she had called to him, somehow, and he had turned and just watched her sink and then he'd gone away.",
      "(She wonders how people will tell the tale, if they tell it at all, and she imagines that no matter how many times it changes one thing will remain the same: he will be the hero of the tale even if he is not.)",
      "This is what he did, the truth in her dream and her reality, he had promised her everything and he had let her behind to drown in the sorrow that he'd created himself.",
      "(And then, perhaps, he had laughed.)",
      "She had woken in tears, with sorrow in her heart but she had not been alone.",
      "A God sat beside her, Dionysus his name was (he'd said) and he'd tried her tears and promised her the world, promised her everything.",
      "He'd told her she should not cry for the likes of a hero that could not appreciate the beautiful women she was.",
      "And then he'd carried her away and given her the world.",
      "(And she'd laughed and been happy.)",
      "*~* Aeria had learned the tales - of Gods and heroes and the ordinary people whose lives they messed with - at her grandmother's feet.",
      "Her grandmother was a fountain of knowledge about the Gods and her storytelling abilities were wonderful.",
      "She hadn't been the only sitting there, her friends would come as well but her siblings never cared enough to hear all the tales again.",
      "(Sometimes, after her grandmother was done talking, she'd ask her if those stories really happened and her grandmother would look at her and say: of course they did, my dear child, of course they did.",
      "But Aeria wasn't sure, didn't know, if she'd ever actually believed that.)",
      "Her grandmother had loved the tale of the contest between Poseidon and Athena to be the patron saint of the town they knew as Athens.",
      "Her best friend Livia loved the tale of Troje the most (and of Helen who had started it all.)",
      "Aeria loved the tale of Aphrodite's birth, of her rise from the sea foam as her father was castrated by his son.",
      "(She had begged, over and over again when she was younger for her grandmother to tell that story and her grandmother had, time and again, dutifully told it to her.)",
      "That however was long ago, back when they were children and those tales matter, back when she believed they were real (and perhaps a part of her still does.)",
      "Now she is older, now they are older, now they are grown and she understands more, now she knows that the Gods don't always do good things and heroes aren't always heroes.",
      "(She still goes to Aphrodite's temple just in case they are listening.)",
      "Her grandmother had died long ago, her tales lost in the wind and no matter how hard she tried Aeria had never really been able to tell them the way her beloved grandmother had.",
      "The tales of the ocean were the ones told the most.",
      "(But they all end in tears, Aeria thinks now, or perhaps they do not, perhaps she only remembers those that do.)",
      "A times she, they'd wondered - she and Livia - as they stood at the water's edge and looked over the massive ocean if the Gods looked down upon them and were deciding, perhaps in that moment, if they were important to them or not.",
      "Livia had always wanted to believe that someday they would be that they would sail away and have their own adventures but Aeria had always rather suspected that to the Gods they never mattered at all, that they were nothing but another worshiper.",
      "(She'd joined Livia in imagining their adventures but she'd never believed they'd go on one.)",
      "She's not special, not to them, not to the world, not to anyone.",
      "(Not to anyone but her grandmother that is.)",
      "Her mother too told her tales but those were not well-known, just stories of people she had once cared about that were no longer there at all.",
      "(And the world at large would not hear those tales, nor would they care they but she had learned them and she'd carried them in her heart and for a while at least it seemed they mattered.)",
      "Her mother told the tale of Syria, one of her friends, who had fallen in love with a man who lived on an island far away.",
      "She had worn white on her wedding and she had been the most beautiful girl in all the land and then she had kissed her best friend goodbye and she had sailed away to her husband's home.",
      "They had lived, her mother tells her, near a lighthouse that belonged to his family - and Aeria had at times imagined what that light would look like, how many lost sailors it would save and how many it would destroy.",
      "They had been happy, they had been at peace.",
      "Until one day she'd left to see her mother, who'd begged for a visit, and she had promised him she would return as fast as she could.",
      "But that night, they say, Poseidon had been angry - why nobody knows and Aeria wonders at times if Poseidon had ever understood what his anger did or if he cared about it at all - and her ship had not been able to withstand the storm he created.",
      "(But then no ship on the sea that night, near where she was, had been able to withstand it and Aeria hears this tale of the one girl who died and wonders how many others lost their lives that night.)",
      "Her ship had gone down in the waves and she had drowned (her eyes closed her mother said, though she cannot know this, her eyes closed imagining a better time.)",
      "She had never been found.",
      "And her husband, her love had stood on the shore and watched the ship sail away and then he had gone back to his life and waited for her to return.",
      "The storm had grown and it had scared him and he had stood there watching the seas hoping to see her ship return and hoping she had decided to wait until it had passed or not return at all (for then, at least, she would have lived.)",
      "He had been lost to them all once he learned the truth, her mother told her, and he'd drowned in his grief.",
      "He has spent the next year sitting on the island, staring at the world around him and imagined seeing her everywhere.",
      "He had gone crazy, the people whispered, and they felt sorry for him but none, ever, tried to help.",
      "They had too much to do, too much to take care of in their own lives to care about a man who had lost it all.",
      "(And Aeria never asks if her mother had cared for him, if she had tried to reach the man her friend had loved so much or if she too, like all others, had deemed her problems more important - and perhaps they even were.)",
      "One night, her mother whispers, he could no longer stand it and so he'd leapt head first into the ocean and he had drowned.",
      "Aeria likes to imagine he had gone to the underworld and he had found her there and they were, somehow, happy.",
      "And she had wondered what the difference was between Syria and those that had come before.",
      "Why had, she wonders, Ino been saved and not her mother's friend?",
      "Surely she was just as kind and her death just as undeserving, just as random.",
      "Perhaps there was really no reason why some were saved, perhaps it was just the moment it happened, and perhaps it was all just a simple coincidence.",
      "She'd asked nothing though about that and she'd just imagined what it would be like to love someone so much you were unable to live without them.",
      "(And she had wondered, then too, if she would someday have a love like that.",
      "If somebody would one day look at her and declare her the one, the everything, the only one that would ever matter.)",
      "*~* Livia sailed away with her brother one day.",
      "Her brother was going to Athens and they needed to go by boat, over the ocean, and Livia - who had been dreaming of the day she could see the world - had decided to go with him.",
      "She had asked Aeria to come too but she had been too afraid, to determine to stay with her mother to even think about sailing away.",
      "And so Livia had promised her thousands of tales and that someday, when she came back, they would sail away together and see the world.",
      "(And they'd meet Gods, Livia would say, and Heroes but they would live their own lives just like they wanted to.",
      "Aeria liked the idea, the plan, but she's not sure she believed in it.)",
      "She had stood on the shore and watched the ship disappear into the horizon.",
      "(And she had wished, desperately, that she had been strong enough, brave enough to go with her.)",
      "She had stayed in her home, as Livia sailed across the seas; she had stayed as sickness swept across their tiny island and took her mother far away (and left her in charge of her younger siblings and in that moment she was glad that she had not gone for if she had they would have died.)",
      "Every day, whenever she had time - sometimes at night when her house became too small - she stood on the shore where she had stood before and waited for a ship to appear in the horizon but none ever did.",
      "(Ships appeared on that horizon but never, not once, did they bring her best friend.)",
      "And so she waited, as her old house fell apart around her, she waited or the best friend's return.",
      "As night turned into day, and days into weeks, and then into months and then a year.",
      "(And then another, and then three, and in the end she waited five whole years.)",
      "Her siblings grew and learned to take care of themselves - Alicia married a young man that lived not that far away, Aeria likes him he's kind and treats her with respect, Lucinda married another man, a little older, and though at times he treats her well there are times that Aeria would like to kill him for hurting her (slowly, preferably.)",
      "Man came for her too sometimes, one in particular - broad shouldered, tanned and smiling all the time - but she turned them away, waiting as she was for the return of her friend and the start of the live they had imagined (perhaps, she thought, perhaps if she told him he would tell her he was coming, perhaps he would say that he could sail away with her.",
      "But she suspected that she and Livia were the only ones who really wanted to go.)",
      "She waited, live went on, the house fell apart and night turned into day.",
      "And then, five years after she'd waved goodbye, she'd finally relented and given up.",
      "Livia was not coming back, she'd realized, Livia had found something out there in the world (and she refused to even consider the possibility that Livia could not come back, that somewhere out there she had joined others in their watery graves) and it made her happy, so happy she never returned.",
      "She had thought then, at the shore staring over the ocean, that she would go to his house and tell him that yes she would like to get married, and he would fix their old house and they would live their lives together (and she would name her first daughter, whenever she came, after her best friend who'd left one day.)And so they did, and they grew old and Aeria would tell her children the stories her grandmother told - though she could never tell them well - and she would tell the tales her mother shared.",
      "And she would speak of her best friend who'd sailed away and never returned and had found her happiness and her adventure somewhere out there.",
      "(She imagined Livia on a boat or in a beautiful house, a man she loved by her side and children playing all around her.",
      "And she imagined that Livia sometimes thought about her and imagined her happy.)",
      "She still went to the shore every day and stared at the horizon for a while.",
      "You never know after all.",
      "*~* Livia sailed across the seas and saw the world.",
      "She saw things she could not describe and things she would never have believed existed if she had not seen them herself.",
      "She did not, however, find adventure in the way she had imagined, there were no heroes and no Gods, no impossible quests.",
      "(Perhaps, she thinks, it was just the men who were supposed to go on the quests.)",
      "She did however find adventure in another way, by meeting new people and seeing new lands, by sailing the seas and never knowing what would come next.",
      "And then, one day - after five years, five very long years in which she missed Aeria desperately at times and wished she had just come with her - her brother said: \"It's time to go home.\"",
      "There was still so much that Livia wanted to see, still so much she wanted to know.",
      "But she'd thought then, on that ship near the docks - two days from her home town - that's okay, we'll sail home and I'll convince Aeria to come with me.",
      "(Surely now she would do, surely now she was grown and she no longer needed to care for her siblings, surely now she would not fear.)",
      "And so they'd gone, back to where they came from and someone, she never remembers who, said they should sail to the left but her brother had said no - both ways would lead to home but the way the sailor said they should go would take a day or two more not that Livia really cared - and so they'd sailed the way her brother wanted to.",
      "There's a tale about a girl, Aeria's mother used to tell them, a young girl, with long beautiful hair that moved in the wind and beautiful piercing eyes - though nobody had looked in those in years.",
      "She had fallen in love with the prince of her dreams and they had married in a ceremony in the hills but then a war had broken out between her father's kingdom and his and he'd had to choose which way to go.",
      "And so he had sailed, to the land in the east, to talk with his father and calm him at least.",
      "She would speak to hers and they would relent and if they did not he would return and they would run away and they would build a new home in another world where they would be save.",
      "She talked to her father but he only grew angrier until one day he build a tower on the cliffs and locked her in, the door closed behind her and he'd said if her prince returned, if he did not side with his father, he would allow him to live with her in her tower on the cliffs.",
      "And so she had waited, staring out of the window at the ocean, but her love had never came.",
      "He had died in the attack her father had led, died even after he'd convinced his father peace was the way and her father never told her that he would never come.",
      "Instead he sends whispers of the betrayal of love, of her husband who had chosen the other side and left her to rot.",
      "She had died in that tower, alone and in pain but somehow she lingers, they say.",
      "Her song can still be heard, haunting the seas and any sailors that pass wish to give her peace.",
      "(They all drown in their haste for none think it through; none remember that she had died long ago.)",
      "She had not believed the story, though Aeria had, and truthfully shad forgotten that that story supposedly took place near their home.",
      "Now she believes, now that it's too late, as the song fills the air and shatters her heart.",
      "Her brother and his crew go towards the tower - that still stands though it looks worn and old and she swears it will fall apart at any minute - to save a girl no longer there and she pleads, and she talks, but they ignore everything she says (she thinks perhaps this is the revenge of the princess, who had believed she had been abandoned and now killed all those that passed.)",
      "Livia closed her eyes as the ship went down and imagined she was somewhere else.",
      "She imagined she was with Aeria and they were sailing the seas and seeing it's wonders, she imagined they'd stopped in a beautiful town and lived there for years, she imagined they travelled by land as well and seen all there was to offer.",
      "She even imagined, as the current carried her towards the tower, that she had never left at all, that she had waited until Aeria was ready to leave.",
      "She imagined that she wasn't drowning but floating and that another ship would come and save her, she imagined it would take her home and she would see her best friend and she would tell her how much she loved her and how much she missed her and they would sail away to their future together.",
      "But of course none of that happened.",
      "Of course she drowned as the haunting song filled the air.",
      "*~* Livia's floating.",
      "And yet maybe she's not.",
      "Maybe she's drowning like so many before her, maybe the floating is in her imagination.",
      "Maybe she swims, desperately towards the shore, like Ino before her (but Ino rises out of the ocean and becomes more.)",
      "Maybe she's like Aeria, save on an island, sad and waiting but, at least, safe.",
      "(Like Ariadne on another island, sad and broken but not drowning.",
      "But no God would come for Aeria, no God would make her his.)",
      "Maybe none of it is real, maybe it's all a story.",
      "*~* Persephone falls and rises and the people feel her mother's despair, Ino saves the sailors as they drown in her domains.",
      "Ariadne sails the worlds with her God by her side and their lives are forever told in the tales of the land.",
      "But Aeria stays on her island and stares over the sea waiting for her a friend's return that could never be.",
      "But nobody would tell their story (of Livia & Aeria.)",
      "Nobody would care to know."

He caught her gasps and sighs, taking them into himself all the while he languidly drew them out over and over. He drew her closer, helpless against the force that tugged him to her. He rolled high above and rocked her gradually till she eased into a blissful slumber with the sounds of his heart echoing in her ears. Then he was a ferocious storm, crashing against her, dragging her down, pushing her under. Wave after wave, turn after turn, shattering against her with the wilderness in his cries and earth-shaking roars. That was till he was subdued and she opened her arms from him to slide into her embrace as he kissed her skin and mouth so she could taste his apology. But it was only when he was still and so silent that she felt fear tremor in her bones. She could not gaze underneath the dark eyes, those dangerous depths that she fell into time and time again. She could only ever glimpse what lay beneath, glinting and enticing but never quiet near enough for her to clearly see. He was cold to her touch and withdrawn, not a ripple of feeling passed through and she broke into waves of tears as he turned and drifted out and away from her shore.",

She paused to give him a slow smile over her shoulder before picking the petals off one by one, scattering them on the ground. Since the sun never shone in his palace inside the great cave, the large fire and many candles around provided light and it was enough not to truly affect him and to let him see her. She, or more likely a servant, had placed poppies on top of her rich chestnut hair like a crown and through the loose and light dress he could make out the shape of her long legs and hips. He shifted in his throne and called out her name softly. She stopped swaying, turning to face him cocking her head to the right. She was incredibly beautiful with such delicate skin and storm-blue eyes. He remembered when she just showed up at the edge of his domain moving slowly through the poppies in front of the entrance which were there as a warning. What better place for a goddess like her than in the realm of Sleep? His brother, Thanatos, wanted him to get rid of her as soon as she arrived but something about her made him let her stay. She provided good company, when she could be bothered to do so. And he enjoyed looking at her and distract him from the darkness. \"Come here,\" he said, in voice so hypnotic that made her sway again but she didn't obey. \"Come and get me,\" she whispered back half-turning way again. He had expected a response like that since it was always he would have to make the first move. Her slothful nature often meant that he spent a lot of time almost serving her, something that Thanatos remarked scornfully on. But it rarely bothered him because she always repaid him well. He hid a smirk thinking of past repayments and strode towards her. She lowered her eyes in a way that would have been meekly had she not smiled as she did. He picked her up effortlessly and she wrapped her arms around his shoulders leaning into him as he carried her, deciding against going back to his throne and instead laid her down in the centre of his large bed. He picked off the poppies in her hair discarding them on the floor and in a simple motion stripped her of her dress. Completely naked her skin was strikingly pale against the black sheets and he pulled off his own clothes since he knew she wouldn't do it. She stretched her arms above her, a soft sigh escaping her lips and she slid one leg up the bed casting him a heated look. He skimmed her skin with one hand watching her eyes close and a dreamy smile settle on her lips. She revelled in the attention he placed on her and he enjoyed watching her do so. He leaned down and kissed her and although she was sloth personified, there was nothing idle in the way she kissed him back. His hand came up to the nape of her neck and his tongue explored the hot cavern of her mouth whilst her fingers trailed over his back and chest. She rolled her hips against his as a clear indication of what she wanted and he smiled against her mouth. Underneath him her body flushed and heated and his mouth, eager to explore, descended upon the soft uncovered flesh. She made small moans as he licked, sucked and gently bit her nipples and cupped her breasts. One hand clutched his head and the other clenched the sheets as her body rocked. He could smell her arousal and pressed his erection teasingly against her thigh. He slid between her legs, reaching out to slowly stroke her finding her hot, wet and wanting. She groaned feeling his fingers rub over sex and with a circular motion move over her clit. She jerked as his mouth covered her and it was both tongue and fingers and licked and stroked her. She was like opium turning him into an addict for her taste. Her breathing was heavy and by the way she bucked her hips he could tell she was close and so pulled away. She moaned in protest and then in delight as he pushed his cock inch by slow delicious inch into her. He stretched and filled as she welcomed him deeply moving her hips to feel him fully inside. She sighed in bliss opening her eyes to gaze up at him, pink lips parted and waiting for him to ravish her again and again. He didn't disappoint, devouring her mouth and thrusting into her in a way that made her writhe, nails digging into his back and shoulders, her legs wrapped around his hips. Their bodies moved together in a perfect rhythm that drew out pleasure for as long as possible, reaching but not quite climaxing until he ultimately decided. Watching her was the most erotic vision he had ever seen. Eyes closed, lips parted in panting breath and moans, her whole body rubbing sensually against him he couldn't think but for the intense pleasure that was building. Breaking tempo he bucked into her almost furiously and she cried out coming as he did seconds after with a yell that echoed off the walls. They rode out the waves and once she could drag in a desperate breath into her lungs she became listless, arms gently encircling him slumped above her. He shifted his body to lay by her side and rested his head against her shoulder feeling her fingers gently caress his hair. Her heart still thundered in her chest and against her skin his breathing was still heavy as they lay there quietly bathing in the aftermath. It was often their way, it would be incredibly rare for her to move and they could pass hours away just lying there with one another. He gave a sudden small chuckle and she cocked her head puzzled as he moved so that he could see her. \"What is it?\" \"I just thought, my brother thinks me a fool to indulge you all the time but clearly he doesn't know how much you indulge me,\" he grinned. \"Clearly he doesn't, but who better to indulge Sloth than Sleep?\" she smiled sultry at him. He drew her close, placing a kiss on her head. \"Indeed.\" She curled against him and felt the comforting wave of sleep slowly draw her in. \"And, Aergia, he will never know?\" \"No Hypnos,\" she mumbled succumbing to him. \"He won't.\" Hypnos smiled again as he drew them both into the dark realm of dreams that he would wake them from when he felt that insatiable hunger for her rise again.",

    "text": "It killed him. Killed him that he'd never seen her perfect smile, her bright eyes, her iridescent skin until this moment. It killed him that she led a life devoted to him, yet he'd been deprived of her sight, her sounds, her touch until today. It killed him that she had been his all the while, but he'd never known it. It killed him that she was his, but he could never be hers. She resisted, the first time. Fear was something he'd never known; only anger and disappointment. He soothed her with careful touches and whispered words. She gave him a kiss, and he went reeling. Considered what it would be like to bring her to the heavens. But she belonged here, and he didn't. Try as he might, he would never be able to give up his world for her. \"I was afraid you would hurt me,\" she told him. They lay on the cold marble floor of her temple for him, bare. He felt inexplicably alone -- as if he was imagining her voice, and if he turned his head to look at her, the space beside him would be empty. But she rested her palm against his cheek, turning him to look at her. \"Sansa,\" he said, watching her bite her lip. \"Never.\" But the words didn't feel right coming off his lips, like they were of a language he would never know. A language only she could understand. It took him a moment to realize what it was. A lie. Closing his eyes, trying to ignore the heat of her hand in his, she sighed. \"Never.\" He loved her gasps and moans, her porcelain skin, the flutter of her lashes when he kissed a pulse point. He loved how vulnerable she was, how everything she did was delayed by hesitation. He loved how she would give into him, how she would let her walls fall as soon as she met his eye. But no matter how much he wanted to, he could never love her. \"I've a present for you,\" he said, waltzing into the temple. He watched her shiver at his voice and grinned. She stood, silently asking. He put a hand on her waist and his lips on hers. She shrieked. Eyes still shut, he felt her crumple to the floor in front of him. Silence. Then a sob. His eyes snapped open, but stayed focusing in front of him instead of lowering to Sansa on the floor. \"Theon,\" she said, but it wasn't like the other times she'd said it -- more of a plea, less of a prayer. \"Is it --\" Not letting her finish, he sat beside her. \"You're like me now, Sansa.\" She looked up at him with a confused smile, and he tapped her temple. \"Everything.\" \"Everything?\" she repeated, perplexed. \"Everything, he agreed. \"Everything is inside your head.\" She was happy of his gift, he could tell, but something had changed. He could not longer read her through her eyes. She kept them to the ground. She still gave him that breathy moan when he marked her as his, but she no longer sighed his name. He took her for the first and last time in the corner by the altar, and though she moaned and sighed and came, the tears that started when he gently broke her open didn't stop until it was done, though he could tell the pain had stopped long before. The next time he entered his temple, she spat in his face. He grabbed her wrists so hard they began to bruise, pushed her against the wall. \"What made you think that was a good idea?\" he asked her. She took a shaky breath. \"My family, dead. My brother gone, mangled by Achilles. My city burnt and sacked, destroyed. And you -- with the Greeks!\" She choked on her tears and he tightened his grip, fury growing inside of him, boiling, threatening to overflow. \"I wish you'd never come here. I was a fool to be your priestess, and even more a fool to be your lover. Leave this city!\" \"Sansa,\" he growled. Oh, how he wanted to kill her, strangle her; and how easy it would be, too -- if not for her perfect blue eyes, her rosy lips, her ivory skin. \"Don't think I won't. But be careful -- there will come a time when you're thankful for my gift, only to have it cursed. When it will help you save the lives of your family, none will believe you.\" He let go of her, let her gasp and fall to the floor. \"You're welcome.\" He left without a glance back. He watched her. Oh, yes, of course he watched the important stuff as well. He understood how invested he was in the Trojan War -- as if Asha would ever shut up about it. This was big. This was significant. He understood. And he played his part -- a part he was supposed to ignore, but none of the other gods did, and none seemed to care anymore. He gave advice, he protected innocents, even guided an arrow or two. But still he watched her. The war was on the forefront of his mind, but somehow the part with her in it, the memories seeping in around the edges, seemed more important. He watched her bathe with her maidens, he watched her care for her nephew and cousins. He watched her slip her sandals on in the mornings, and he watched her place them carefully beside her while she slept at night. Sometimes, when she went to sleep while a battle was still raging outside the walls of her city, she slept with her sandals on. He watched her give the occasional sidelong glance to the brother who had ruined everything, and when she said his name in conversation she seemed to be resisting the urge to spit. Paris, she would growl. It made Theon smile a bit. Once, he watched her wistfully stare at the noonday sky. He wondered what she thought when she thought of him; which memories returned to her mind when his name graced the lips of others. \"Sansa,\" scolded the queen, hurrying past her daughter. \"Look away from the sun, child. You'll go blind. Come. We have the wounded to tend to.\" Sansa nodded, following her mother, unable to stop blinking the sunspots out of her eyes. Foolishly, Theon wished the pattern of his flaming legacy would stay inscribed into her vision forever. After a moment, he shuddered. He realized it already was. Tears streamed down, soaking her robes, She sat in a room of stony-faced royalty. She was horrified less by the passing of her brother, but by her family, sitting in solemnity, in silence. \"Hector -- I told you,\" she was muttering, cradling her knees to her chin, scratching her nails so hard down her legs that the fabric of her chiton ripped and blood began to stain it red. \"I told you all! So many, many times!\" They either didn't hear, or didn't care, or it was Theon's fault. She'd tried to warn them, and for that, Theon was proud. \"It's not a gift,\" she cried, running around in a panic through the celebrating crowds of her family and her people. \"It's a treacherous trap, crafted by Odysseus himself. Beware the horse! Expel it from our city! Danger broods inside -- this is the end!\" With a wave of finality, she realized it really was the end. Lucky for her, she had seen it coming. Go, Theon screamed from leagues and leagues away -- she could never hear him, but the words needed to escape him. Run while you can! Leave the city, save yourself! Instead, she waited for the attack. \"Sansa.\" It was the last time she would ever see him, he knew. She knew it as well, he presumed. Even without her sight, she would know. The scene held the foreboding edge of finality, suspended in the air like a bird, almost waiting for the lion to pounce on its prey. She sat, hostage, tied up, in the tent of Agamemnon. It was too warm for nighttime -- the burning of her city forced the temperature higher. \"This is it.\" Her voice shook, but she held her chin high, the moonlight coloring her skin like steel. \"It's -- It's over. She'll kill me. I've seen it.\" \"Clytemnestra,\" Theon growled, the word like a gash across his pretty face. \"I'll slaughter her.\" \"No,\" Sansa said at once, staring at him. \"No, you won't.\" He didn't know how to respond, but after a moment, she beat him to it. \"I sail for Argos when the sun rises.\" \"Then it never will,\" he argued, though he knew it was in vain. Though the sun was his to control, he wouldn't leave it to burn out. \"Liar,\" she accused, though the word didn't sound so horrible when released for his lips. \"I only wish --\" \"Elysium,\" he promised, \"the Isle of the Blest. Anything you want, it is yours. I swear on the River Styx.\" \"I wish for you to never see me again. Do not bear witness to my death.\" He couldn't look at her. It killed him, tore him apart. He wanted to curl up and die. Instead, he forced his mouth open, and managed to croak a single word out. \"Granted.\" Theon vanished before he realized that he could never set eyes on her face again. He hadn't glanced at her a last time. Even now, her features began to muddle in his mind, obscuring her face until he could barely recall it -- a wisp of auburn hair, eyes shining wit his spirit inside. This was what happened, then. This was how the story of a hero ended. Theon didn't comprehend why it was such a surprise -- he just had never imagined it so cold.",

      "So many, many times!\"",
      "They either didn't hear, or didn't care, or it was Theon's fault.",
      "She'd tried to warn them, and for that, Theon was proud.",
      "\"It's not a gift,\" she cried, running around in a panic through the celebrating crowds of her family and her people.",
      "\"It's a treacherous trap, crafted by Odysseus himself.",
      "Beware the horse!",
      "Expel it from our city!",
      "Danger broods inside -- this is the end!\"",
      "With a wave of finality, she realized it really was the end.",
      "Lucky for her, she had seen it coming.",
      "Go, Theon screamed from leagues and leagues away -- she could never hear him, but the words needed to escape him.",
      "Run while you can!",
      "Leave the city, save yourself!",
      "Instead, she waited for the attack.",
      "\"Sansa.\"",
      "It was the last time she would ever see him, he knew.",
      "She knew it as well, he presumed.",
      "Even without her sight, she would know.",
      "The scene held the foreboding edge of finality, suspended in the air like a bird, almost waiting for the lion to pounce on its prey.",
      "She sat, hostage, tied up, in the tent of Agamemnon.",
      "It was too warm for nighttime -- the burning of her city forced the temperature higher.",
      "\"This is it.\"",
      "Her voice shook, but she held her chin high, the moonlight coloring her skin like steel.",
      "\"It's -- It's over.",
      "She'll kill me.",
      "I've seen it.\"",
      "\"Clytemnestra,\" Theon growled, the word like a gash across his pretty face.",
      "\"I'll slaughter her.\"",
      "\"No,\" Sansa said at once, staring at him.",
      "\"No, you won't.\"",
      "He didn't know how to respond, but after a moment, she beat him to it.",
      "\"I sail for Argos when the sun rises.\"",
      "\"Then it never will,\" he argued, though he knew it was in vain.",
      "Though the sun was his to control, he wouldn't leave it to burn out.",
      "\"Liar,\" she accused, though the word didn't sound so horrible when released for his lips.",

      "I swear on the River Styx.\"",

      "Do not bear witness to my death.\"",
      "He couldn't look at her.",
      "It killed him, tore him apart.",
      "He wanted to curl up and die.",
      "Instead, he forced his mouth open, and managed to croak a single word out.",
      "\"Granted.\"",
      "Theon vanished before he realized that he could never set eyes on her face again.",
      "He hadn't glanced at her a last time.",
      "Even now, her features began to muddle in his mind, obscuring her face until he could barely recall it -- a wisp of auburn hair, eyes shining wit his spirit inside.",
      "This was what happened, then.",
      "This was how the story of a hero ended.",
      "Theon didn't comprehend why it was such a surprise -- he just had never imagined it so cold."

    "text": "The fair-ground was deserted. The faint, buttery odor of popcorn and hot-dog frying lingered over it, turned sour by souring straw and the other remains of the fair. In the empty stables, the breeze that carried these scents lifted only a single strand of hay, and nothing stirred inside the shed where the pigs had been kept, except for a fly that bumbled into a web woven at the height of a man's eye and buzzed indignantly for a few minutes, to no effect. But the weaver of that web had gone before the fly. A crescent moon that had been pressed into the high blue September sky like the indent of a fingernail began to shine down on the dust and beaten grass. First one star, then another, appeared. Zuben-el-genubi rose, and near it -- where exactly is hard to say -- two eyes blinked, and a tenebrous owl swooped down from the heavens to perch on a post and scrutinize the spider's web -- first with one eye, then the other. \"You came from a humble town,\" observed the owl, reading the word in the web, \"of a humble father, and humble trade, and yet it is only now that you have learned humility.\" The dead spider was silent. \"Stubborn yet!\" said the owl. Twisting her head, the owl plucked a feather from her wing, and laid the feather along the rafter nearest the spider. \"Even if you sleep,\" she said, \"you'll keep no secrets from me.\" The spider stirred. \"Say who you are,\" said Noctua. \"Charlotte,\" said the spider, with some dignity. \"Charlotte Araneus Cavatica, though you needn't use it all at once.\" \"No indeed,\" said Noctua (who, for herself, was known as Machanitis, Gigantoleteira, Pronoea, Oxyderces, and Ergane; and at other times Agoraea, Sthenias, Apaturia, and Soteira). \"I shall name you as I knew you, Arachne. What a tapestry you have made even of your name!\" \"I don't know anything about that,\" said Charlotte, \"and if we're acquainted, I'm afraid I don't recall it.\" The fly in the web had stopped struggling. Lifting off her perch, the owl seized it with her beak -- and there was not even a crunch, because it had not been eaten by a mortal creature. It was merely gone. Charlotte said nothing, nor could she move, but she was deeply uncomfortable. It was clear that the owl meant to intimidate her. \"Don't be frightened,\" said Noctua sweetly. \"For you are not a spider, and I am not an owl. Would you like to see the truth of things?\" She did not wait for an answer, but reached out towards the spider's body, flexing her claw as if it were a hand. As that claw drew near, Charlotte felt more frightened -- and what sense did it make, for her to be afraid of anything, now that she was dead? -- because she began to remember a hand whose gift was dread. The claw came to rest above the spider's eyes, and it was indeed a hand, resting on a forehead. The maiden of Lydia gazed upon the bright-eyed goddess of Athens, and bowed her head, and was amazed. \"This is my command,\" said Athena: \"Remember me.\" So Charlotte recited the tales of Athena that had been placed in her memory: Athena's birth from Zeus, and her part in the creation of Pandora; Athena at Cyprus, and in Ionia; Athena's olive tree and her flute; Athena and Perseus; Athena and Erichthonios. Arachne, as she once was, might have commented sharply on the cruelty of the goddess' wrath against Medusa, or the kindness that Athena had shown to the Koronides and the Pandareides, that had not been shown to her. Charlotte had absorbed Arachne's pride. But Arachne had now earned Charlotte's circumspection; Charlotte felt wary of a goddess who had chosen to enlighten a spider. Athena said nothing as Charlotte spoke, until Charlotte described the Palladium at Troy. \"Do you know where the Palladium is now?\" said the goddess. Charlotte searched her new-old memories, but they did not help her. \"I don't know the Palladium,\" she said doubtfully. \"But I know of palladium -- it is a silver metal element.\" This was, she felt, a sophisticated grasp of things for a farm spider. \"They fashion that into jewelry,\" said Athena. \"But it does not adorn me. What you describe was named for a rock among asteroids,\" said the goddess, \"and that was filed for me with a number, as a clerk might record a donation to the Temple. Yet the name that passes from the rock to the metal is hollow, with none of my glory. Though the statue that fell from heaven has returned there, it is diminished. Olympus is forgotten.\" Charlotte waited in silence for the goddess' conclusion, and tried to make an art of waiting. Even the sky waited: since Noctua had swept down from the sky, the stars had not changed position. Charlotte was fixed in twilight. \"You are impatient, girl of Lydia,\" Athena said. \"You were wont to busy your hands with all manner of things, and therein lay your boast. What is your art now?\" Charlotte said, delicately, \"Why does a victor over Titans remember her victory over a girl of Lydia? What is it that you want?\" The last promise Athena had made Arachne was that she would hang forever, and Athena had earned her epithet of vengeance returning. \"You are right,\" said Athena of the glittering eyes. \"You are not important. But it is from me, little spider, that you gain your craft -- and as an artisan, I work with what falls to my hands. That is you.\" She cast a light from her hands onto the web that read HUMBLE, and the web shone, just as it had when it had been newly made, and morning dew turned its interstices into stars. \"Once you used your skill to spite the immortal gods,\" said Athena. \"But what is this? Now you have died defying another's mortality.\" \"I will place you among the stars,\" Athena decreed, \"and you shall write our histories in them: as once Zeus my father placed his heroes there, you shall enshrine us again. I guide men in their astronomical arts. Yearly they look farther into the skies. You shall weave for them shapes to discover there. You shall go beyond Draco and beyond Cygnus in your weaving.\" There was something strange about this. Charlotte wondered if she ought to feel honoured; she wondered if she ought to feel redeemed. But it is generally true that someone asks for a second chance when they have been disappointed in their first. Arachne had died of shame. Charlotte had lived a full life as a spider, with many friends, bravery and pragmatism, and occasional grandiloquence. So the part of her that was Arachne did not feel grateful for Athena for her new, promoted existence: instead she felt grateful to Charlotte for hers. Once-mighty Athena needed a weaver, but the weaver did not need Athena. Clear-sighted Athena looked into her heart anyway, and divined her thoughts. \"You have always erred in determining the gods' gifts,\" said the goddess of workers. \"In your long-ago life, you denied me as the source of your skill, even though you delighted in challenging me. In this life, your talent was a mystery to you, but you accepted it. Take from me, not life -- there is no growth or change for a mortal in the heavens, but only slow disfigurement, as of stone under water. My gift to you is a task to put your skill to use. \"The stars fade,\" said the goddess. \"You, a mortal, cannot bestow immortality. Pigs may not be butchered or betrayed, but they still die, though they may be remembered. Spiders die. You and I have the same design -- to stretch out the span of things. We are workers, and we will discard dross, but we hate to cut the threads of gold; these we will return to the weave. I have selected you to perform a task you are already shaped to.\" And so with persuasive words the goddess of wise counsel inspired her handmaiden. There are flies in the stars, but Charlotte did not put them there, and does not bother herself with catching them. There are no sounds of the barnyard -- no cacophony of geese, or songs of 'Peabody' or 'Phoebe'. There are no aromas of buttermilk or rotten eggs. But there are frogs among goddesses, and gods among sheep; Erichthonios is there, and Medea, and Chrysaor, and Thalassa, but there is also a nebula shaped like the Zuckermans' barn, and one like a ferris wheel. There are spider-children in the shadows, and there is more than one transcendent pig.",

      "But the weaver of that web had gone before the fly.",

      "Zuben-el-genubi rose, and near it -- where exactly is hard to say -- two eyes blinked, and a tenebrous owl swooped down from the heavens to perch on a post and scrutinize the spider's web -- first with one eye, then the other.",
      "\"You came from a humble town,\" observed the owl, reading the word in the web, \"of a humble father, and humble trade, and yet it is only now that you have learned humility.\"",
      "The dead spider was silent.",

      "It was clear that the owl meant to intimidate her.",

      "She did not wait for an answer, but reached out towards the spider's body, flexing her claw as if it were a hand.",
      "As that claw drew near, Charlotte felt more frightened -- and what sense did it make, for her to be afraid of anything, now that she was dead?",
      "-- because she began to remember a hand whose gift was dread.",
      "The claw came to rest above the spider's eyes, and it was indeed a hand, resting on a forehead.",
      "The maiden of Lydia gazed upon the bright-eyed goddess of Athens, and bowed her head, and was amazed.",
      "\"This is my command,\" said Athena: \"Remember me.\"",
      "So Charlotte recited the tales of Athena that had been placed in her memory: Athena's birth from Zeus, and her part in the creation of Pandora; Athena at Cyprus, and in Ionia; Athena's olive tree and her flute; Athena and Perseus; Athena and Erichthonios.",
      "Arachne, as she once was, might have commented sharply on the cruelty of the goddess' wrath against Medusa, or the kindness that Athena had shown to the Koronides and the Pandareides, that had not been shown to her.",
      "Charlotte had absorbed Arachne's pride.",
      "But Arachne had now earned Charlotte's circumspection; Charlotte felt wary of a goddess who had chosen to enlighten a spider.",
      "Athena said nothing as Charlotte spoke, until Charlotte described the Palladium at Troy.",
      "\"Do you know where the Palladium is now?\" said the goddess.",
      "Charlotte searched her new-old memories, but they did not help her.",
      "\"I don't know the Palladium,\" she said doubtfully.",
      "\"But I know of palladium -- it is a silver metal element.\"",
      "This was, she felt, a sophisticated grasp of things for a farm spider.",
      "\"They fashion that into jewelry,\" said Athena.",
      "\"But it does not adorn me.",

Did you think that I did not grieve that he took her from me, that I don't lament the day Lady Hera transformed her?

    "text": "When I was only a girl, my half-brother Aisakos, prophet of Troy before me (Father will tell you he drowned in despair when his river-born love died, and you must nod and agree, but know, but no, he dives still covered in feathers instead), took me to sit with him on the highest walls of Troy one morning and said: \"Little Cassandra. You share my burden, don't you, sister? To speak the words of Apollo the Foreseer for all of Troy to hear?\" I stared at him in confusion. Back then the only predictions I ever made were about what our nurse would serve us for dinner every night, and inevitably it would be goat when I swore it would be sweet suckling pig, stringy boar when I promised pheasant. It made the others very unhappy; Deiphobus, in particular, who'd always let his hopes rise high only to have them dashed down to the ground, and one terrible night swore he'd never believe me about anything again. But even then I trusted my brother's word; everyone knew Aisakos was always right, always believed him, because Aisakos was loved by the gods and he spoke their truth. He squeezed both my hands tightly. \"Cassandra, my dear one, you must hear me, and remember: It's no fault of yours if you can't make a difference. The future's not yours to change. Never take that guilt upon yourself, as well: You can't alter what is to come.\" Except he was wrong. I proved that the morning I stood proud on the hill where Hektor and Andromache plighted their troth only last night, and I clutched my love's hands, and I became a princess of Troy no longer. I proved that when on my wedding day, my father promised me one favor, and I asked--demanded, really--that a small insignificant cowherd be barred from the competition he would hold later that day, and Father--oathsworn--had to agree. I proved Aisakos wrong the day I kept a firebrand from burning Troy to the ground: my burden is so much greater than anything he might have imagined. The night I met Apollo, he asked me: What do you wish, pretty maid? I didn't ask for prophecy, as the stories would have it. Why should I? Already I was making predictions with startling ease, since the night Helenus and I spent in the temple to hone our skills. I said to him: I wish to truly make a difference, to change the fates of gods and men. I received it. More fool me. What is my love like? Well might you ask. The blood of gods runs through his veins, but that means nothing in this day and age, when half the populace of Troy claim descent from the gods; why, they say even my brother Troilus is Apollo's son in truth! To my love, it means nothing. He's not so tall, and built light and nimble, body suited more to a scout's work than those of the warriors who stand over Troy. His tongue is clumsy, and his passions overwhelm him. Destiny wraps around him like a shroud. (Is it Othroyneus, whose suit my father favors? It could be. It is not.) But I kept that back, I saved him from the fate, I did, when I swore my vows to him! We ruled together over his father's lands, and bought peace and prosperity with our reign, and flocks of children besides. I like children; but more do I like the smells of clean water and baby's skin, when I'd bathe my baby sons and daughters; and mud and grass and sweat, when my husband came to embrace me at night. (Is it Coroebus of Phyrgia, who stands at noble Mygdon's side? It could be. It is not.) We were happy. I have to remember that. But once again it's Helen who's the cause of Troy's downfall. She always is, in the end. It was what she was born to, I think--that when the great swan waylaid Leda, it was only to that end. It certainly makes more sense than being the most beautiful woman in the world. Who is to say who the most beautiful at any time can be? Could not it as easily be Cassandra of Troy stolen away by Agamemnon and his Achaeans, and Aeneas in pursuit to recover her? (For he would, wouldn't he, if only for friendship's sake? I thought as much.) And what's more, what's enough to satisfy me for a night in a serving girl so often becomes pure and precious beauty in one of royal blood in men's eyes. I said as much to my father-in-law once. He was offended. He had been trying to pay me a compliment, I think, calling me the most beautiful of Priam's daughters. My husband offered excuses, and that at least he excels at. He can smooth over arguments with his voice, when his impetuousness does not overcome him, and for that he will become a leader of men. He half-convinced me to believe him when he said that I didn't mean most of what I said, that it was my heart and not my words that men should observe, that his father himself had loved a woman he did not fully understand Oh, how can anyone ever doubt that I loved him? So. It was Helen who was responsible--Helen, and the shipping monopolies Troy clutches. They would have said that it was all because she wanted a new bronze mirror to satisfy her vanity, and couldn't get one. Actually it was because Sparta had experienced a terrible famine for the third year in a row, and while Menelaus was content storing up the palace granaries, the Spartans were Helen's people, and she would not let them starve A more beautiful commander than Agammemnon, and a more merciless one, too. Then the war lasted much less than ten years; Priam my father, since the welfare of his son and the honor of his family was not at stake, was much more amenable to compromise, and Hektor my brother lived long enough to take the throne and secure it for his Astaynax after him. But Helen was adamant on providing for her people, and ensuring that such a plight would never come upon them again. She left us with nothing, as she brought Achaea all the power and allies it could ever need. The city grew poor as it lost its wealth, as merchants took their wares to more powerful ports, and eventually it collapsed into itself. Poverty, and shame, ended the rule of the house of Priam, and the last son of our house was followed by jeers from his subjects as he walked among them. They abandoned the city at last, after it was populated by beggars and the desperate; and years later, grew another one above it and called it Wilusa, but that collapsed as well; and the next; and the next, until everyone forgot that the splendor of Troy had ever existed, and that the house of Priam had ruled it well. Everyone lived, you see. Everyone was forgotten. And this, too, I remember: Golden Aphrodite coming to me when I was an old woman, wrinkled and gray, lying in the arms of my love. In our hearts then there was not even enough pride to mourn for Troy, and what it had been; it had struggled and choked like a poor soldier left to die on the battlefield, and there had been nothing to do but watch it and wish someone would have given it a mercy-blow years before. Aphrodite said: \"The time has come, daughter, to make use of my brother Apollo's gift. That is why I give you a choice, a chance to--as you said--make a difference.\" I said, \"I don't understand.\" So she explained: \"All this that you have lived and loved and felt was no more than a mere possibility as to how things could be, if you would have them so.\" \"No!\" I said, utterly horrified. \"How can you say that? I have ruled as Queen for years--I have born children--I have loved your s--\" She merely looked at me, harsh and remote as a hawk's yellow stare, and I knew she did not lie. \"Now before you, Cassandra of the keen eyes, lies the choice of Thetis's son--for glory and destruction, or endurance and oblivion. But he chose his own fate, dear daughter, and you decide for Troy.\" I understood at last, and wailed, for what was to come. \"How can you be so cruel?\" I begged her. \"How can you not understand?\" And she smiled sadly at me--do you know how lovely even a sad smile from Aphrodite's lips can be? How foolish, my friend. You of all people must. -and said that she understood far more than I could ever think she did. So I closed my eyes, and I made my choice, and can you guess, my friend, what it was? My husband's choice would have been much like one you might make--exactly the one you might make, in fact, were you given a circumstance like that. Survival at all costs is key, come what may, he said; far nobler to forget Troy and linger than cling to it and be lost, as well. Why must you look surprised? You will survive, my friend; you will go on, and you will remember us. That much gives me strength for what else must come. My choice, however--my choice was.... I woke up in my own bed, young and strong and alone. The next day my brother Paris put his name forward in our grand tournament, all to recover his precious bull. I didn't say a word. I lived a life where I had everything I ever wanted, and I gave it up so my city would live instead--if not in this one, in another, the world of the bards, the world where all our human strivings are worth something after all. Cruel of the gods to ask it of me; cruel of the gods to give me sight to see that future at all. That was his true revenge, after all. So that is why mad Cassandra, blessed by prophecy through brother's blood and serpent's tongue and god's gift, raves: because this was all my doing from the start. How good of you to listen to me for so long, my friend Aeneas--No, don't look like that, I am well. My sadness was short-lived, as it always is. It's only the sun that causes me to prattle on so. (It has always been the Sun, since I was a girl too foolish to realize what I was refusing.) By all means, go back inside. Hektor and Andromache are waiting, and they might take offense if you do not join them. I would prefer the cool air outside for a while longer. Yes, yes; I'm quite well. Please, go ahead, and don't worry. Before you go, though, know this: how glad I am that you are with me! How glad I am that you, at least, don't remember.",

      "(For he would, wouldn't he, if only for friendship's sake?",
      "I thought as much.)",
      "And what's more, what's enough to satisfy me for a night in a serving girl so often becomes pure and precious beauty in one of royal blood in men's eyes.",
      "I said as much to my father-in-law once.",
      "He was offended.",
      "He had been trying to pay me a compliment, I think, calling me the most beautiful of Priam's daughters.",
      "My husband offered excuses, and that at least he excels at.",
      "He can smooth over arguments with his voice, when his impetuousness does not overcome him, and for that he will become a leader of men.",
      "He half-convinced me to believe him when he said that I didn't mean most of what I said, that it was my heart and not my words that men should observe, that his father himself had loved a woman he did not fully understand Oh, how can anyone ever doubt that I loved him?",
      "So.",
      "It was Helen who was responsible--Helen, and the shipping monopolies Troy clutches.",
      "They would have said that it was all because she wanted a new bronze mirror to satisfy her vanity, and couldn't get one.",
      "Actually it was because Sparta had experienced a terrible famine for the third year in a row, and while Menelaus was content storing up the palace granaries, the Spartans were Helen's people, and she would not let them starve A more beautiful commander than Agammemnon, and a more merciless one, too.",
      "Then the war lasted much less than ten years; Priam my father, since the welfare of his son and the honor of his family was not at stake, was much more amenable to compromise, and Hektor my brother lived long enough to take the throne and secure it for his Astaynax after him.",
      "But Helen was adamant on providing for her people, and ensuring that such a plight would never come upon them again.",
      "She left us with nothing, as she brought Achaea all the power and allies it could ever need.",
      "The city grew poor as it lost its wealth, as merchants took their wares to more powerful ports, and eventually it collapsed into itself.",
      "Poverty, and shame, ended the rule of the house of Priam, and the last son of our house was followed by jeers from his subjects as he walked among them.",
      "They abandoned the city at last, after it was populated by beggars and the desperate; and years later, grew another one above it and called it Wilusa, but that collapsed as well; and the next; and the next, until everyone forgot that the splendor of Troy had ever existed, and that the house of Priam had ruled it well.",
      "Everyone lived, you see.",
      "Everyone was forgotten.",
      "And this, too, I remember: Golden Aphrodite coming to me when I was an old woman, wrinkled and gray, lying in the arms of my love.",
      "In our hearts then there was not even enough pride to mourn for Troy, and what it had been; it had struggled and choked like a poor soldier left to die on the battlefield, and there had been nothing to do but watch it and wish someone would have given it a mercy-blow years before.",
      "Aphrodite said: \"The time has come, daughter, to make use of my brother Apollo's gift.",
      "That is why I give you a choice, a chance to--as you said--make a difference.\"",
      "I said, \"I don't understand.\"",
      "So she explained: \"All this that you have lived and loved and felt was no more than a mere possibility as to how things could be, if you would have them so.\"",
      "\"No!\"",
      "I said, utterly horrified.",
      "\"How can you say that?",
      "I have ruled as Queen for years--I have born children--I have loved your s--\" She merely looked at me, harsh and remote as a hawk's yellow stare, and I knew she did not lie.",
      "\"Now before you, Cassandra of the keen eyes, lies the choice of Thetis's son--for glory and destruction, or endurance and oblivion.",
      "But he chose his own fate, dear daughter, and you decide for Troy.\"",
      "I understood at last, and wailed, for what was to come.",
      "\"How can you be so cruel?\"",
      "I begged her.",
      "\"How can you not understand?\"",
      "And she smiled sadly at me--do you know how lovely even a sad smile from Aphrodite's lips can be?",
      "How foolish, my friend.",
      "You of all people must.",
      "-and said that she understood far more than I could ever think she did.",
      "So I closed my eyes, and I made my choice, and can you guess, my friend, what it was?",
      "My husband's choice would have been much like one you might make--exactly the one you might make, in fact, were you given a circumstance like that.",
      "Survival at all costs is key, come what may, he said; far nobler to forget Troy and linger than cling to it and be lost, as well.",
      "Why must you look surprised?",
      "You will survive, my friend; you will go on, and you will remember us.",
      "That much gives me strength for what else must come.",
      "My choice, however--my choice was....",
      "I woke up in my own bed, young and strong and alone.",
      "The next day my brother Paris put his name forward in our grand tournament, all to recover his precious bull.",
      "I didn't say a word.",
      "I lived a life where I had everything I ever wanted, and I gave it up so my city would live instead--if not in this one, in another, the world of the bards, the world where all our human strivings are worth something after all.",
      "Cruel of the gods to ask it of me; cruel of the gods to give me sight to see that future at all.",
      "That was his true revenge, after all.",
      "So that is why mad Cassandra, blessed by prophecy through brother's blood and serpent's tongue and god's gift, raves: because this was all my doing from the start.",
      "How good of you to listen to me for so long, my friend Aeneas--No, don't look like that, I am well.",
      "My sadness was short-lived, as it always is.",
      "It's only the sun that causes me to prattle on so.",
      "(It has always been the Sun, since I was a girl too foolish to realize what I was refusing.)",
      "By all means, go back inside.",
      "Hektor and Andromache are waiting, and they might take offense if you do not join them.",
      "I would prefer the cool air outside for a while longer.",
      "Yes, yes; I'm quite well.",
      "Please, go ahead, and don't worry.",
      "Before you go, though, know this: how glad I am that you are with me!",
      "How glad I am that you, at least, don't remember."

    "text": "\"I'm done! I'm officially done for the year.\" I wasn't sure what I was doing here in the gardens, but I needed to be here. I found Stiles, looking miserable after another day of piling up more paper work of matching up singles. It was the busiest day for the cupids. Valentine's Day. I walked on forwards adjusting my scarf. Ever since I found this piece of clothing, I have never failed to go without a day of wearing one. \"Stiles!\" I hurried my pace and almost stumbled when I stepped in front of my brother, more of a half sibling. He turned to gaze at me with a sigh tumbling from his lips. \"What do you want, Isaac?\" I fidgeted with the file in my hands, biting down onto my bottom lip, eyes widening slightly when a nervous tone took over. \"Are you really done? Mother's going to be angry with you.\" I could tell Stiles was contemplating this. Aphrodite was my mother too, but my father was a cupid. I was allowed to serve her since she had a soft spot for Stiles and I got along with my brother. I might even be the closest to him, besides Scott. Scott... My face became flustered and I could tell from the radiating heat coming from the back of my neck. Thankfully the blush had not spread to my cheeks where Stiles would be able to see it. \"I'm not going back. I'm done for the year. You and Scott will have to encourage the rest to finish up. I did my fair share.\" It took less than a few seconds but Stiles was spreading his beautiful wings. Cupids are a type of angel and Stiles' feathers ruffled through the wind it was starting to pick up as he neared a cloud. My words were lost onto my tongue. \"I'm going down to walk among the mortals for a while.\" My face twisted into a horrified look and I may be overreacting when a stutter took hold of my tone. \"Y-you c-can't!\" \"I can. You should take a break too. Go make out with Scott.\" \"W-What?\" An innocent look featured onto my face at the mention of Stiles' comment, and the blush was now displaying bright red onto my cheeks. \"I know about your crush on him. You're lucky he's related to me and not you. Otherwise it would be incest.\" I was lost for words once more. Crush? I wasn't going to deny that fact. I did take a fancy towards Scott, and I thought 'I' was the only one who knew about that. Scott was only Stiles' brother. They both shared the same father. The only reason Scott became a cupid, without wings (Aphrodite still hated that Scott's father had an affair, as if she didn't do it at times.) My mother was in love with Ares, who was their father. She could deny it, it was still the truth. I shook my head from these thoughts and focused on Stiles who had turned around quickly to push me into a solid figure. I wasn't sure who I crashed into. I was facing Stiles who had jumped backwards onto the cloud, falling thousands of feet into the air and turning to fly his way down onto the land of the mortals. \"Hey Scott, Isaac wants to make out with you!\" \"Isaac?\" That voice. I ignored Stiles' comment, seeing the only one in the gardens wasn't just me anymore. I turned to look down towards Scott, seeing his soft eyes and a crinkle of a smile forming onto his lips. \"Sc-Scott.\" A confused gaze crossed Scott's features and that's when I heard another voice, and an echo of heels coming past both of us. \"Fuck sakes, just fuck already.\" I felt my shoulders being tightened onto a secure hold where Scott was placing both his hands on each side. He must have caught me before I fell onto the ground. I looked down onto my shoes, suddenly becoming shy. I quickly stepped back from Scott and gulped. Why were people always assuming Scott and I needed to be matched up? I may want that, but what Stiles and many other haven't registered. Scott didn't return my feelings. I always see him making eyes towards Athena's daughter, Allison. \"Lydia. Stop scaring Isaac.\" Lydia laughed deviously and winked towards Isaac who had looked up to meet her gaze. A teasing tone took form, matching the glint of wickedness surpassing her eyes. I knew she was up to something and knowing her, it mostly was going to involve Stiles. She ignored Scott's words and kept on walking away, disappearing into the air. How easy would it be if I was also a witch like Lydia? I could disappear away this very moment. It wasn't long before silence filled the air and I was daring to gaze towards Scott who was staring back at me with an unreadable expression. Normally I would always see a carefree smile settle onto Scott's lips. I would know, having to sneak many glances towards Scott's lips many times in the past. I felt the happiest when I was with Scott. I finally looked down towards the file in my hands, not realizing I had been clutching it tightly. \"I...I should get going.\" Scott didn't say a single word and I made my way past him, trying to conceal the blush on my skin by adjusting my scarf. \"Is that silk?\" I nodded, facing Scott once more. \"It looks good on you. That scarf.\" I blinked, trying hard not to blush again. It was becoming difficult when I sneaked a glance towards his lips and saw Scott lick them attentively. It was distracting. The 'thank you' was at the tip of his tongue but I never got to say it. \"Is it true? What Stiles said?\" I took a step back but Scott only got closer to me. \"I...He was only kidding!\" I didn't mean to shout embarrassingly but if I couldn't have Scott. I rather not lose his friendship over my one-sided pining. I almost missed Scott's smirk when he tugged onto my scarf and pulled me down to eye level. \"That's a shame. I was looking forward to it.\" I wasn't sure if I heard Scott correctly but my lips tingled with anticipation. Soon enough they were pressured by another set of lips which belonged to Scott. I wasn't sure what to do, and I must have taken long to respond. Scott pulled away and looked disappointed. I wanted to kiss him; I was only caught by surprise. \"I thought..? I'm sorry, Isaac. I shouldn't have kissed you.\" \"No.\" I retraced my word and knew it sounded rejecting. I shook my head to cover it up. \"I mean, you shouldn't be sorry. I was just shocked. I...like you.\" Scott's whole expression brightened and he wrapped his arms around my waist, pulling me closer to him. I was starting to doubt my crush may not be one sided after all. It made me smile shyly. \"Scott?\" \"I wasn't sure if to believe Stiles when he told me you had a crush on me, but I had to go for it. I want you, Isaac. Please. May I kiss you again?\" Scott's eyes darted towards my lips, and I squeaked. Scott wanted me? I should be mad at Stiles for spilling my secret. Strangely enough I wasn't. All I did was nod and watch until Scott's lips were on mine once more. I kissed him back with a certainty of what I wanted. \"Scott, I always wanted you.\" My knees were giving me out and I was sinking slowly towards the grass below me. I pulled Scott to land on top of me as my head settled onto the ground and Scott started to press kisses along my jaw. \"Let me have you.\" It wasn't a question and that brought me to tremble slightly from the excitement. I nodded, completely seduced by Scott. It didn't take much from him. I fell from one simple gaze. That was all it took, and the whisper taking my tone was proof. \"Please.\" The smirk was back on Scott's lips and he was pulling my shirt up and over my head. He tucked the scarf inside and left it clinging around my neck. I soon felt the delicate press of more kisses onto my chest and Scott got properly in-between my legs, parting them further. My hand was landing onto Scott's hair, gripping it. \"Sc-Scott.\" Scott chuckled and wrapped his mouth around a nipple of mine, darting his tongue out to lick at it a couple times. It brought a tingle of pleasure to cloud my mind and arch my back slightly. He furthered his actions, tugging at my nipple before pressing a kiss to it and tugging my pants down with all underwear. It left my cock exposed to the air. I was already half hard when Scott scooted down lower, gripping my outer thighs to pull me closer to his face where he parted his lips and took my cock into his mouth. I closed my eyes and felt the warmth start to work its way onto the pit of my stomach. It was a sensation to which I had never felt before now. Scott was curling his tongue, using it to play pleasure onto my body. I was trying to hold my whimper back, but it was too late. It had already slipped out. Scott furthered his actions by pulling off my cock and licking down towards my balls, where he used one hand to fondle them. \"Sc-Scott!\" Scott only smiled at my small outburst and slid his hands to place them under my thighs and to my ass where he cupped one cheek into one each of his hands. He gripped them and lifted me up slightly, all I heard was Scott's voice clear through my ears. \"You're beautiful, Isaac.\" His words were filled with simple honesty and I was blushing slightly, unable to hold back the gasp when I felt warmth where my hole was located, a wet intruder had entered; which I didn't mind. Scott had plunged his tongue inside me, (that wonderful tongue that did wonders) and my body was shaking slightly at the feeling of his tongue wetting my walls while he stretched my insides. I was at the verge of choking with a sob, it felt too good. Scott pulled out and nuzzled his nose against my balls. \"Don't hold back on me. Let it all out.\" I had always loved Scott's honest eyes, and I was captured by his stare for what felt like the millionth time. I realized at that moment, I was more than in love with Scott. I would do anything for him. Anything. I let out a loud whimper and reached to grip onto Scott's hair as he crawled back on top of me, bringing his cock to drag along mine. He let his hips roll down onto mine where our cocks were playfully touching against each other. \"I want to be inside of you, Isaac.\" I was startled and brought out into reality, having been too lost into the moment. I didn't even notice that Scott had started to lick along my ear and speaking in a husky tone. I felt my heart hammering in my chest; if I didn't know better I would think it would burst out of my chest in the next few seconds. I gulped, the tip of Scott's cock was rubbing onto my hole and making my legs wrap around Scott's waist by instinct. \"Yes, I...I want you.\" I was losing control and I barley registered what I was even saying at the moment. I felt the urge to latch myself onto Scott and never let go. Scott had moved his lips down to my neck where he was pressing kisses while moving my scarf down, a laugh being heard from him. I finally opened my eyes to see he was starting to press into me, inch by inch. It hurt at first and my face must have shown it since Scott was brushing his hand onto my hair while I kept my arms around him. I gripped onto his back tightly. \"It's ok, I have you. It won't hurt for long.\" I trusted Scott and soon the pain was subsiding after Scott had gone as far inside of me as his length allowed. \"Tell me when to move.\" Scott was now caressing along my face, and I was lost for my breath. He made me feel at the most highest places with the most amazing feelings. I ran my hand along his spine, lingering my finger along the path of the spine. Scott's body shivered delightfully against my own and this amazed me. \"Move.\" I was surprised I didn't stutter this time around and Scott was moving his hips slowly, thrusting back and forth before I felt the pace was too slow. The pleasure was settling and overpowering any pain. I was groaning, settling my lips onto Scott's and being brave enough to bring him into a kiss. Scott was making little noises of pleasure and I knew I was doing something right. We moved in sync, Scott grabbed onto the grass on each side of my head while I gripped onto him, arms around his neck. He nuzzled his cheek against my scarf and started to whisper, tugging at it with his teeth. \"You provoke me, have been for a while. That scarf. It does things to me when you are wearing it.\" He dove under the scarf and licked along my hidden skin. \"Silk. Silk.\" I heard his chuckle, and it warmed my insides, not to mention I was becoming a withering mess underneath Scott. I cried out loudly, having been hit in the right spot. \"Do that again!\" \"This?\" Scott positioned his cock, angling to hit onto the same spot it had been massaging into a few seconds ago. \"Ye-Yes!\" I threw my head back and Scott thrust with determination, bringing me to feel an orgasm want to possess me. Scott grabbed onto my cock and stroked it gently before he gazed at me with a cloud of lust in his eyes. \"I'm close.\" That simple statement brought me to laugh, letting it fill the air. I was happy. I was happy to have Scott to myself. I urged out of my shell of shyness and started to nip at Scott's ear, whispering as seductively that I could. \"Release inside of me.\" Scott's eyes widened, pressing a kiss to my cheek, and I could feel my own release well on its way. It didn't take long before Scott was moving at a quicker pace, hitting effortlessly inside me until I was crying out his name in choked sobs of satisfaction. \"Scott. Scott. Scott!\" It took a few more seconds before I felt the burst of Scott's release after his cock throbbed filling me to the fullest. I came after him, our voices overlapping at the same time our panting synced. \"Isaac!\" \"Sc-Scott!\" Scott collapsed on top of me and rolled to his side, pulling his softening cock out. I darted my eyes to see the mess we had made around us. Scott had his eyes set on the cum I let loose and landed his lips onto my shoulder. He licked it off before whispering while he kissed my shoulder. \"I'm happy.\" I scooted closer to Scott, our naked bodies providing heat for one another. I could only nod, finding my voice in my afterglow. \"You took the words from my lips.\" We must have been there far longer since the sun was starting to come out once more onto the sky. I kissed Scott on the lips and sat up, a whisper taking hold of my voice. \"We should probably change locations, Stiles is due back in a while.\" \"I wouldn't count on that.\" My eyes widened when I heard Lydia's voice, and Scott jumped to cover me up with his shirt. \"He had the night of his life, and he won't be back for a while. Now dress you two. Wouldn't want the others to see you have been having some...\" Lydia smirked and walked past Scott and I. \"...fun. Nice scarf, Isaac.\" She was gone before I knew it and I let the breath I didn't even know I was holding, out. Scott and I met eyes, we both broke out into a smile, laughing freely. He held his hand out to me once he stood and I lifted myself onto my feet. Our hands were still intertwined when he tugged me away, leaving our cloths for evidence. Frankly, I didn't care. \"Let's hurry. I don't want the others to see what is now mine.\" Scott reached to grab my ass and squeeze it before he tugged me off to who knows where. My guess would be his home? I didn't mind, and only if we were doing it together. I was fine with it. I held onto Scott's hand more tightly and allowed him to take the lead. I tugged on my scarf, ignoring the fact that I was naked at the moment and only wearing a scarf. It was my lucky scarf; the silkiness was what caught my eye when I first saw it, and now thanks to it I got Scott. I let myself silently thank my scarf before I laughed, liking the morning air and how it shone onto Scott's body. It made him look like a god; it may just be me but I was entranced. Thank you, Stiles. Thank you. I'm happy.",

      "\"Sc-Scott.\"",
      "A confused gaze crossed Scott's features and that's when I heard another voice, and an echo of heels coming past both of us.",
      "\"Fuck sakes, just fuck already.\"",
      "I felt my shoulders being tightened onto a secure hold where Scott was placing both his hands on each side.",
      "He must have caught me before I fell onto the ground.",
      "I looked down onto my shoes, suddenly becoming shy.",
      "I quickly stepped back from Scott and gulped.",
      "Why were people always assuming Scott and I needed to be matched up?",
      "I may want that, but what Stiles and many other haven't registered.",
      "Scott didn't return my feelings.",
      "I always see him making eyes towards Athena's daughter, Allison.",
      "\"Lydia.",
      "Stop scaring Isaac.\"",
      "Lydia laughed deviously and winked towards Isaac who had looked up to meet her gaze.",
      "A teasing tone took form, matching the glint of wickedness surpassing her eyes.",
      "I knew she was up to something and knowing her, it mostly was going to involve Stiles.",
      "She ignored Scott's words and kept on walking away, disappearing into the air.",
      "How easy would it be if I was also a witch like Lydia?",
      "I could disappear away this very moment.",
      "It wasn't long before silence filled the air and I was daring to gaze towards Scott who was staring back at me with an unreadable expression.",
      "Normally I would always see a carefree smile settle onto Scott's lips.",
      "I would know, having to sneak many glances towards Scott's lips many times in the past.",
      "I felt the happiest when I was with Scott.",
      "I finally looked down towards the file in my hands, not realizing I had been clutching it tightly.",
      "\"I...I should get going.\"",
      "Scott didn't say a single word and I made my way past him, trying to conceal the blush on my skin by adjusting my scarf.",
      "\"Is that silk?\" I nodded, facing Scott once more.",
      "\"It looks good on you.",
      "That scarf.\"",
      "I blinked, trying hard not to blush again.",
      "It was becoming difficult when I sneaked a glance towards his lips and saw Scott lick them attentively.",
      "It was distracting.",
      "The 'thank you' was at the tip of his tongue but I never got to say it.",
      "\"Is it true?",
      "What Stiles said?\" I took a step back but Scott only got closer to me.",
      "\"I...He was only kidding!\"",
      "I didn't mean to shout embarrassingly but if I couldn't have Scott.",
      "I rather not lose his friendship over my one-sided pining.",
      "I almost missed Scott's smirk when he tugged onto my scarf and pulled me down to eye level.",
      "\"That's a shame.",
      "I was looking forward to it.\"",
      "I wasn't sure if I heard Scott correctly but my lips tingled with anticipation.",
      "Soon enough they were pressured by another set of lips which belonged to Scott.",
      "I wasn't sure what to do, and I must have taken long to respond.",
      "Scott pulled away and looked disappointed.",
      "I wanted to kiss him; I was only caught by surprise.",
      "\"I thought..?",
      "I'm sorry, Isaac.",
      "I shouldn't have kissed you.\"",
      "\"No.\"",
      "I retraced my word and knew it sounded rejecting.",
      "I shook my head to cover it up.",
      "\"I mean, you shouldn't be sorry.",
      "I was just shocked.",
      "I...like you.\"",
      "Scott's whole expression brightened and he wrapped his arms around my waist, pulling me closer to him.",
      "I was starting to doubt my crush may not be one sided after all.",
      "It made me smile shyly.",
      "\"Scott?\"",
      "\"I wasn't sure if to believe Stiles when he told me you had a crush on me, but I had to go for it.",
      "I want you, Isaac.",
      "Please.",
      "May I kiss you again?\" Scott's eyes darted towards my lips, and I squeaked.",
      "Scott wanted me?",
      "I should be mad at Stiles for spilling my secret.",
      "Strangely enough I wasn't.",
      "All I did was nod and watch until Scott's lips were on mine once more.",
      "I kissed him back with a certainty of what I wanted.",
      "\"Scott, I always wanted you.\"",
      "My knees were giving me out and I was sinking slowly towards the grass below me.",
      "I pulled Scott to land on top of me as my head settled onto the ground and Scott started to press kisses along my jaw.",
      "\"Let me have you.\"",
      "It wasn't a question and that brought me to tremble slightly from the excitement.",
      "I nodded, completely seduced by Scott.",
      "It didn't take much from him.",
      "I fell from one simple gaze.",
      "That was all it took, and the whisper taking my tone was proof.",
      "\"Please.\"",
      "The smirk was back on Scott's lips and he was pulling my shirt up and over my head.",
      "He tucked the scarf inside and left it clinging around my neck.",
      "I soon felt the delicate press of more kisses onto my chest and Scott got properly in-between my legs, parting them further.",
      "My hand was landing onto Scott's hair, gripping it.",
      "\"Sc-Scott.\"",
      "Scott chuckled and wrapped his mouth around a nipple of mine, darting his tongue out to lick at it a couple times.",
      "It brought a tingle of pleasure to cloud my mind and arch my back slightly.",
      "He furthered his actions, tugging at my nipple before pressing a kiss to it and tugging my pants down with all underwear.",
      "It left my cock exposed to the air.",
      "I was already half hard when Scott scooted down lower, gripping my outer thighs to pull me closer to his face where he parted his lips and took my cock into his mouth.",
      "I closed my eyes and felt the warmth start to work its way onto the pit of my stomach.",
      "It was a sensation to which I had never felt before now.",
      "Scott was curling his tongue, using it to play pleasure onto my body.",
      "I was trying to hold my whimper back, but it was too late.",
      "It had already slipped out.",
      "Scott furthered his actions by pulling off my cock and licking down towards my balls, where he used one hand to fondle them.",
      "\"Sc-Scott!\"",
      "Scott only smiled at my small outburst and slid his hands to place them under my thighs and to my ass where he cupped one cheek into one each of his hands.",
      "He gripped them and lifted me up slightly, all I heard was Scott's voice clear through my ears.",
      "\"You're beautiful, Isaac.\"",
      "His words were filled with simple honesty and I was blushing slightly, unable to hold back the gasp when I felt warmth where my hole was located, a wet intruder had entered; which I didn't mind.",
      "Scott had plunged his tongue inside me, (that wonderful tongue that did wonders) and my body was shaking slightly at the feeling of his tongue wetting my walls while he stretched my insides.",
      "I was at the verge of choking with a sob, it felt too good.",
      "Scott pulled out and nuzzled his nose against my balls.",
      "\"Don't hold back on me.",
      "Let it all out.\"",
      "I had always loved Scott's honest eyes, and I was captured by his stare for what felt like the millionth time.",
      "I realized at that moment, I was more than in love with Scott.",
      "I would do anything for him.",
      "Anything.",
      "I let out a loud whimper and reached to grip onto Scott's hair as he crawled back on top of me, bringing his cock to drag along mine.",
      "He let his hips roll down onto mine where our cocks were playfully touching against each other.",
      "\"I want to be inside of you, Isaac.\"",
      "I was startled and brought out into reality, having been too lost into the moment.",
      "I didn't even notice that Scott had started to lick along my ear and speaking in a husky tone.",
      "I felt my heart hammering in my chest; if I didn't know better I would think it would burst out of my chest in the next few seconds.",
      "I gulped, the tip of Scott's cock was rubbing onto my hole and making my legs wrap around Scott's waist by instinct.",
      "\"Yes, I...I want you.\"",
      "I was losing control and I barley registered what I was even saying at the moment.",
      "I felt the urge to latch myself onto Scott and never let go.",
      "Scott had moved his lips down to my neck where he was pressing kisses while moving my scarf down, a laugh being heard from him.",
      "I finally opened my eyes to see he was starting to press into me, inch by inch.",
      "It hurt at first and my face must have shown it since Scott was brushing his hand onto my hair while I kept my arms around him.",
      "I gripped onto his back tightly.",
      "\"It's ok, I have you.",
      "It won't hurt for long.\"",
      "I trusted Scott and soon the pain was subsiding after Scott had gone as far inside of me as his length allowed.",
      "\"Tell me when to move.\"",
      "Scott was now caressing along my face, and I was lost for my breath.",
      "He made me feel at the most highest places with the most amazing feelings.",
      "I ran my hand along his spine, lingering my finger along the path of the spine.",
      "Scott's body shivered delightfully against my own and this amazed me.",
      "\"Move.\"",
      "I was surprised I didn't stutter this time around and Scott was moving his hips slowly, thrusting back and forth before I felt the pace was too slow.",
      "The pleasure was settling and overpowering any pain.",
      "I was groaning, settling my lips onto Scott's and being brave enough to bring him into a kiss.",
      "Scott was making little noises of pleasure and I knew I was doing something right.",
      "We moved in sync, Scott grabbed onto the grass on each side of my head while I gripped onto him, arms around his neck.",
      "He nuzzled his cheek against my scarf and started to whisper, tugging at it with his teeth.",
      "\"You provoke me, have been for a while.",
      "That scarf.",
      "It does things to me when you are wearing it.\"",
      "He dove under the scarf and licked along my hidden skin.",
      "\"Silk.",
      "Silk.\"",
      "I heard his chuckle, and it warmed my insides, not to mention I was becoming a withering mess underneath Scott.",
      "I cried out loudly, having been hit in the right spot.",
      "\"Do that again!\"",
      "\"This?\" Scott positioned his cock, angling to hit onto the same spot it had been massaging into a few seconds ago.",
      "\"Ye-Yes!\"",
      "I threw my head back and Scott thrust with determination, bringing me to feel an orgasm want to possess me.",
      "Scott grabbed onto my cock and stroked it gently before he gazed at me with a cloud of lust in his eyes.",
      "\"I'm close.\"",
      "That simple statement brought me to laugh, letting it fill the air.",
      "I was happy.",
      "I was happy to have Scott to myself.",
      "I urged out of my shell of shyness and started to nip at Scott's ear, whispering as seductively that I could.",
      "\"Release inside of me.\"",
      "Scott's eyes widened, pressing a kiss to my cheek, and I could feel my own release well on its way.",
      "It didn't take long before Scott was moving at a quicker pace, hitting effortlessly inside me until I was crying out his name in choked sobs of satisfaction.",
      "\"Scott.",
      "Scott.",
      "Scott!\"",
      "It took a few more seconds before I felt the burst of Scott's release after his cock throbbed filling me to the fullest.",
      "I came after him, our voices overlapping at the same time our panting synced.",
      "\"Isaac!\"",
      "\"Sc-Scott!\"",
      "Scott collapsed on top of me and rolled to his side, pulling his softening cock out.",
      "I darted my eyes to see the mess we had made around us.",
      "Scott had his eyes set on the cum I let loose and landed his lips onto my shoulder.",
      "He licked it off before whispering while he kissed my shoulder.",
      "\"I'm happy.\"",
      "I scooted closer to Scott, our naked bodies providing heat for one another.",
      "I could only nod, finding my voice in my afterglow.",
      "\"You took the words from my lips.\"",
      "We must have been there far longer since the sun was starting to come out once more onto the sky.",
      "I kissed Scott on the lips and sat up, a whisper taking hold of my voice.",
      "\"We should probably change locations, Stiles is due back in a while.\"",
      "\"I wouldn't count on that.\"",
      "My eyes widened when I heard Lydia's voice, and Scott jumped to cover me up with his shirt.",
      "\"He had the night of his life, and he won't be back for a while.",
      "Now dress you two.",
      "Wouldn't want the others to see you have been having some...\" Lydia smirked and walked past Scott and I. \"...fun.",
      "Nice scarf, Isaac.\"",
      "She was gone before I knew it and I let the breath I didn't even know I was holding, out.",
      "Scott and I met eyes, we both broke out into a smile, laughing freely.",
      "He held his hand out to me once he stood and I lifted myself onto my feet.",
      "Our hands were still intertwined when he tugged me away, leaving our cloths for evidence.",
      "Frankly, I didn't care.",
      "\"Let's hurry.",
      "I don't want the others to see what is now mine.\"",
      "Scott reached to grab my ass and squeeze it before he tugged me off to who knows where.",
      "My guess would be his home?",
      "I didn't mind, and only if we were doing it together.",
      "I was fine with it.",
      "I held onto Scott's hand more tightly and allowed him to take the lead.",
      "I tugged on my scarf, ignoring the fact that I was naked at the moment and only wearing a scarf.",
      "It was my lucky scarf; the silkiness was what caught my eye when I first saw it, and now thanks to it I got Scott.",
      "I let myself silently thank my scarf before I laughed, liking the morning air and how it shone onto Scott's body.",
      "It made him look like a god; it may just be me but I was entranced.",
      "Thank you, Stiles.",
      "Thank you.",
      "I'm happy."

    "text": "Hera's wedding gift is an admonition to the bride to be a good wife; to support her husband in all he did, to listen and obey to all he said, to never doubt or defy him. Psyche, who received a lecture along similar lines from her mother the night before her family left her on a mountaintop, nods reverentially. Apollo's wedding gift is a foretelling: that the child of Eros and Psyche shall be a healthy girl, unharmed from her mother's hardships and sharing in her immortality, and to that his sister adds her promise that she will oversee Psyche's labor herself. Psyche presses a hand over her slight curve of her stomach, and laughs with relief. Persephone's wedding gift is a small box, crafted from ebony dark as night and carved round with poppies; the same box, incidentally, that was very nearly the doom of the bride not hours before. She smiles and places it into Psyche's shaking hands and murmurs: \"I thought this might still be of use to you.\" Psyche manages a thank-you and places the box alongside the string of flawless pearls that Poseidon offered, the baskets of fresh sweet fruits Demeter presented, the very golden cup from which Psyche choked down her first fiery mouthful of divine nectar, and if anyone notices that she doesn't touch it again, even the gods choose not to pass comment. Later, in the relative tranquility once their guests have gone, Eros explains: \"Sleep is a precious thing for us, you know. But Hypnos lives on the border of Hades, and he owes Persephone his fealty. She meant it kindly.\" Psyche frowns. \"But there are stories of even the great gods at slumber: Father Zeus, Apollo, your parents themselves. I know I've heard them.\" It occurs to her, quite suddenly, that these are no longer just the shadowy figures of bedtime tales; instead, they are her in-laws and her equals and her only companions in eternity. The thought makes her chest tighten with panic. Eros, nevertheless, doesn't seem to have noticed her distress. \"I didn't say impossible, only--rare. Time flows differently for us. We'll go centuries without a wink of sleep, as much as we crave it; and slumber every other night for others. Some human ages go by in the blink of an eye, and others drag on past all endurance.\" Psyche considers this. \"My nurse did say the wedding night of Zeus Thunderer and Lady Hera lasted three hundred years,\" she offers. \"Perhaps it's something like that?\" Eros laughs, but in the way of the gods, his mind is already starting to leave the conversation behind, as easily as his mother had dropped her grudge against Psyche what must be--hours? days?--some time before. The gods' attention rarely lingers on any given subject, she's coming to find, for all they live so long. \"Perhaps it is. But--\" His smile turns wicked \"--on the subject of wedding nights....\" Psyche obligingly bends forward to meet him in a kiss, but somewhere in her mind, she remembers the despair that had led her to open the box in the first place, the cold reason that had argued that any death that came from opening the forbidden box could not be worse than Aphrodite's next task. She sets the box in the darkest corner she can find and swears she'll not so much as think of it again. When Psyche was mortal still, and only the youngest of her father's three beautiful daughters, she had had a tutor who'd complained to her mother the Queen: the only flaw in your children, Majesty, is that Pella must have her limbs occupied at all times, Philrya her tongue, and little Psyche her mind! So it was not surprising that after a while, after her daughter has grown old enough to walk and talk and amuse herself, she begins to ask her husband how his enchantments work, and what charms make his love-darts fly; and once those are answered, when she can accompany him when he goes about his work. Eros is patient, and has an answer for every question she can imagine; that is one of the things that made her fall in love with him even in the dark, even without his arrows. But this thing only he denies her--the chance to come with him. Oh, he manages it skillfully enough--distracting her with kisses and caresses, showing her the latest trick Hedone has mastered, taking off with his majestic snowy wings before she notices he's left, never actually refusing her outright (just as he never had refused her anything before, except the chance to see him) but making his wishes clear nonetheless. She is no longer effectively trapped in the mansion behind the mountains. She has made her way home from it once before, and now she has immortality and a god's strength and speed to help her on her way. But her days stretch ahead with nothing to do, and, just as Eros promised, sleep remains elusive. She had never before noticed how easily a doze, or a nap, made the hours fly by before she was bereft of them, and now all that's left to her, with all the world and all of time before her, is to roam the halls of her home listlessly. After a while, she can bear it no longer. \"Take me with you,\" she begs, and winces. It is an echo of her wails the night he left her behind, weeping, in the courtyard of their house: a heartbroken human princesses, leagues away, or so they had both thought, from any who might help or even know her. She thinks she might have forgiven him it after all this time. She wonders if he's forgiven himself, or even felt the need to. She wonders if it matters. \"Very well,\" he says at last, face impassive. \"Bring your box.\" With a twinge of misgiving Psyche puts Hedone in the care of a neighboring wood-nymph and retrieves Persephone's box from where she'd hidden it and tucks it under her arm as they take flight together. They fly what seems a very long time, over mountain and meadow and the wine-dark sea, until they hover over an island, the largest of its fellows in the ocean. \"Naxos,\" Eros says shortly in response to her questioning look, and Psyche catches her breath. Naxos, where Father Zeus himself had been raised! Never in a thousand years could she have thought that she might see such a sight. But nevertheless, it's quite respectable; she's in the company of her husband, after all. Eros swoops lower without warning, but Psyche won't be left behind. Doggedly she follows him (follows, follows, always follows--and why does the thought seem so bitter now?) until they drift, invisible now, above the spot on the beach where a tall young man and a sharp-faced girl sit side by side. Psyche recognizes the girl as a princess at once: it's something about the bearing, the precision of her gestures, the certainty that every word she speaks should be heard and obeyed. It's no one she knew, however, nor even a daughter or granddaughter. More time must have passed on earth than she calculated: everyone she might have cared to see once more is long passed down to Hades, where Psyche can never join them. The young man down below leans forward to steal a kiss from his royal companion, and Psyche focuses on watching them with a sense of relief. He is certainly nothing so grand; or, if he is, doesn't show any signs of having been raised to it. But regardless he's taken with his young lover, and Psyche's heart softens, watching them. For years, waiting lonely in her parents' empty palace, she had dreamed of just such a charming romance for herself; even the fact that love, when it--or he--had finally found her, had come with far more trials and travails than she'd ever imagined, can't dull her vicarious satisfaction at the sight. Beside her, Eros murmurs: \"Theseus of Athens. With him, Princess Ariadne of Crete.\" He jerks his chin towards the box Psyche still holds. \"Open it,\" he mouths, and Psyche does, fumbling the latch out of terror that the sleep barely contained inside will envelope her once more. Despite her worry, it doesn't--not her, at least. From this perspective, it's surprising, and a little unnerving, how quickly the youngsters below fall asleep. And their pallor, too--no wonder Eros thought her dead! For an instant she's confused; is this what they've come for, to cast two innocents into the damned sleep for no offense? Surely that's the responsibility of some other immortal. Her husband's work is to bring light, love, and joy. But then Eros pulls out one of his arrows, and understanding comes sharp and sudden. It's not one of the gold-tipped ones, but instead tripped a dull-gray lead point. With awful care he takes aim at the breast of the slumbering Theseus. When the arrow finds its mark, Psyche shudders as though it were her body pierced. With terrible efficiency, Eros kneels by the young man and wipes the sleep from his face. Theseus wakes within moments, blinks, and turns to look at his companion; his face, so ardent minutes before, now twists with disgust, and he gathers himself up and disappears up the beach. He's out of sight before Psyche realizes it. She kneels beside the princess in turn, scooping the sleep from her eyes and into the box. If Psyche hurries, perhaps it won't be too late; perhaps he won't have gone far at all. Ariadne stirs, and turns, and her brow furrows with confusion before her face pales once more with horror. She doesn't run after her lost lover. She's too proud for that, prouder than Psyche had been in the same situation. Instead she sits exactly where she has always been, head raised high, from all indications expecting him to return to her, shamefaced and stammering. Psyche waits with her, unseen, until dawn, when it's clear she's been abandoned. Only then does the princess Ariadne sink her head into her hands and begin to weep. Psyche considers, briefly, shedding her invisibility and trying to offer words of comfort, but what would she say? What explaination could she provide, when her world is in such turmoil? Never, not even when she was at her most heart-sore, had she thought her husband's work could be so terrible, and she remembers, uneasily, that Apollo's oracle called him a monster, once. By the time she looks away, Eros is long gone. \"It is the will of the gods,\" her husband tells her when she confronts him. \"Love is helpless before it. Theseus must return to Athens alone; his father Poseidon demands it.\" \"So,\" Psyche snaps, \"you'd leave her, friendless and alone, once Theseus has had what he wants from her.\" \"She has no place in his destiny.\" \"What else is she to do with herself? She has left all else behind, put her trust in him, and now she is lost.\" Eros stares back coldly. \"The loves of gods have survived the ends of love-affairs for centuries. I expect she'll manage just as they have.\" And that silences her, the reminder of how very differently her own story had gone. Why hadn't she realized it? Why hadn't she remembered the tales of Io, of Clytie, of Europa? It was only luck, after all that had kept her from sharing their fates. In the distance, Hedone--overseer of pleasure and acutely sensitive to any grief or anger around her--begins to wail. Psyche presses her lips together and reminds herself fiercely: She shouldn't complain. She has no right to complain. She should be grateful. She isn't; instead, the thought of her close escape simply makes her angrier. She turns away. Still. When she thinks back to the expression on her husband's face, he seems almost...ashamed. She can't help but keep thinking of the Princess of Crete, stranded on Naxos, however. When she returns to the island, Ariadne has made her way to the sanctuary, but waits there, heavy-eyed and hopeless, with no dream or direction to drive her onwards. That might have been her, if she hadn't opened Persephone's box of slumber, she thinks, and slumber from that same box was the root of Ariadne's current despair, by Eros' hand with Psyche's collusion. This is her doing, and her responsibility. It's that more than anything that decides her, and instantly, Psyche sets out East to find Dionysus in his sanctuary. More easily than she would have ever thought possible, Psyche smiles and dimples and gently guides him into realizing that he would truly like to visit his father's birthplace and pay his respects. By the time she's left, he's already collecting his followers and organizing their raucous progress to Naxos. It's one of the better choices she can find. Dionysus always travels in groups, to prove more varied company for the lost princess, and there's little better than wine to dull heartbreak. Far more important, though, is the fact that Dionysus himself was born of a mortal woman who came to sorrow through love; unlike the other Olympians, he might well understand something of human sorrow. Ariadne will have need of that. That's not enough, though, and that night she prepares a grand banquet for her husband, has the servants play the songs she knows he loves best, and takes him to bed. Afterwards, she caresses his curly locks with one hand, and reaches for the ebony box with another; before he realizes what's happened, she spreads a bit of sleep over his eyelids and leans back to study the results. It is strange: it seems Persephone's sleep overcomes even the immortals. This, she can only conclude, is what Eros meant all that time ago when he explained to her that true sleep eluded the gods. After all this time of knowing, of sleeping beside him, of living as his holy wife, she's never seen him sleeping so deeply before. Not even the night she raised up her lamp to look upon his face for the first time. The thought of him lying there on that terrible night, half-asleep, knowing that she would be unable to resist her curiosity and doing nothing to stop it, fills her with sudden rage, and without the slightest shred of guilt, she reaches for his abandoned bow and quiver and takes flight after bidding Hedone to watch over her slumbering father. The rest is easy enough; Psyche might never have drawn a bow before, but she has a strong arm and enough observation of Eros to ensure two golden arrows strike Ariadne and Dionysus directly before the god's parade would come upon the lost princess. The rest, Psyche concludes, is up to Ariadne's own fate; with any luck, she'll keep the god's favor long enough to find a new desire for life, and go on to make her own way in the world. And a god will have the power to help her off the island and establish her as no mortal man might; anyway, she suspects Ariadne might have soured on mortal men, anyway. It's not much--and far more pragmatic than the mortal Psyche could have imagined herself becoming--but it's all she can offer. Ariadne will simply have to be content with that. Her husband is waiting for her when she returns, Hedone peeking out from behind him somewhat guiltily. Enchanted sleep, it seems, only lasts so long in the divine, and he only raises an eyebrow at her as she silently offers him his bow and arrows. \"Did it go well?\" is all he asks, as though he expected that she would take his weapons and go, as though he were proud of her, rather than angry or ashamed. She can't seem to make sense of it: she defied him, tricked and disobeyed him, did everything a loyal mortal wife should not so much as dream of. Then it strikes her she's not quite mortal any more. Psyche stares at her husband, considering. If he'd wanted a humble obedient wife, he should have kept her mortal. Instead he gave her immortality, the chance to wage her power against his and see who came out the stronger. In fact, if the smile now threatening to cross his handsome face is any indication, he rather longs for it--all well and good, but more importantly, she does, too. Eros can wreak whatever havoc he chooses in the lives of gods and men, and she, Psyche will follow behind (a choice now, rather than from a lack of anything better to do) and do what she can to give the victims a fair chance, by any means necessary. For the first time, she thinks of eternity and does not shudder. \"Yes,\" she tells him: a declaration of war, of renewed love. \"It did.\" It's not until Dionysus makes his mortal bride immortal that Psyche is able to seek her out. Either one or the other is not at Olympus, due either to the season or to Psyche's self-appointed tasks; but on that day Persephone comes again to stand by her mother's throne on Olympus, and Psyche seizes her chance to speak to her. Persephone's color is better now, and her hair loose as befits her mother's springtime daughter, but something about the way she holds herself makes it all too clear that this was the woman who made herself Queen of the Dead rather than hapless victim of an abduction. Psyche is no longer surprised about the nature of her wedding gift; in fact she suspects that Persephone might have guessed more accurately at how she'd feel as a new bride, uncertain of her place, than any other had. \"Thank you,\" she says fervently, taking Persephone's hands in her own; despite all the time that has passed, doesn't need to explain why or for what; \"it did--it does come of use to me. More than I might have guessed.\" And Persephone laughs, Queen again for an instant rather than maiden. \"Spare me and my lord any inconvenient arrows, wife of Eros, and consider your debt repaid.\" \"I promise,\" says Psyche, with the confidence of one who speaks for herself and not just her husband, and squeezes Persephone's hands as carelessly as she would those of her sisters. But even as she steps away, Ariadne's pale, frightened face catches her eye. Psyche herself must have looked much the same, years before. She's come prepared, though; holding her gift for the new bride, Psyche approaches and says: \"I thought this might be of use to you.\" Ariadne smiles.",

      "It's that more than anything that decides her, and instantly, Psyche sets out East to find Dionysus in his sanctuary.",
      "More easily than she would have ever thought possible, Psyche smiles and dimples and gently guides him into realizing that he would truly like to visit his father's birthplace and pay his respects.",
      "By the time she's left, he's already collecting his followers and organizing their raucous progress to Naxos.",
      "It's one of the better choices she can find.",
      "Dionysus always travels in groups, to prove more varied company for the lost princess, and there's little better than wine to dull heartbreak.",
      "Far more important, though, is the fact that Dionysus himself was born of a mortal woman who came to sorrow through love; unlike the other Olympians, he might well understand something of human sorrow.",
      "Ariadne will have need of that.",
      "That's not enough, though, and that night she prepares a grand banquet for her husband, has the servants play the songs she knows he loves best, and takes him to bed.",
      "Afterwards, she caresses his curly locks with one hand, and reaches for the ebony box with another; before he realizes what's happened, she spreads a bit of sleep over his eyelids and leans back to study the results.",
      "It is strange: it seems Persephone's sleep overcomes even the immortals.",
      "This, she can only conclude, is what Eros meant all that time ago when he explained to her that true sleep eluded the gods.",
      "After all this time of knowing, of sleeping beside him, of living as his holy wife, she's never seen him sleeping so deeply before.",
      "Not even the night she raised up her lamp to look upon his face for the first time.",
      "The thought of him lying there on that terrible night, half-asleep, knowing that she would be unable to resist her curiosity and doing nothing to stop it, fills her with sudden rage, and without the slightest shred of guilt, she reaches for his abandoned bow and quiver and takes flight after bidding Hedone to watch over her slumbering father.",
      "The rest is easy enough; Psyche might never have drawn a bow before, but she has a strong arm and enough observation of Eros to ensure two golden arrows strike Ariadne and Dionysus directly before the god's parade would come upon the lost princess.",
      "The rest, Psyche concludes, is up to Ariadne's own fate; with any luck, she'll keep the god's favor long enough to find a new desire for life, and go on to make her own way in the world.",
      "And a god will have the power to help her off the island and establish her as no mortal man might; anyway, she suspects Ariadne might have soured on mortal men, anyway.",
      "It's not much--and far more pragmatic than the mortal Psyche could have imagined herself becoming--but it's all she can offer.",
      "Ariadne will simply have to be content with that.",
      "Her husband is waiting for her when she returns, Hedone peeking out from behind him somewhat guiltily.",
      "Enchanted sleep, it seems, only lasts so long in the divine, and he only raises an eyebrow at her as she silently offers him his bow and arrows.",
      "\"Did it go well?\" is all he asks, as though he expected that she would take his weapons and go, as though he were proud of her, rather than angry or ashamed.",
      "She can't seem to make sense of it: she defied him, tricked and disobeyed him, did everything a loyal mortal wife should not so much as dream of.",
      "Then it strikes her she's not quite mortal any more.",
      "Psyche stares at her husband, considering.",
      "If he'd wanted a humble obedient wife, he should have kept her mortal.",
      "Instead he gave her immortality, the chance to wage her power against his and see who came out the stronger.",
      "In fact, if the smile now threatening to cross his handsome face is any indication, he rather longs for it--all well and good, but more importantly, she does, too.",
      "Eros can wreak whatever havoc he chooses in the lives of gods and men, and she, Psyche will follow behind (a choice now, rather than from a lack of anything better to do) and do what she can to give the victims a fair chance, by any means necessary.",
      "For the first time, she thinks of eternity and does not shudder.",
      "\"Yes,\" she tells him: a declaration of war, of renewed love.",
      "\"It did.\"",
      "It's not until Dionysus makes his mortal bride immortal that Psyche is able to seek her out.",
      "Either one or the other is not at Olympus, due either to the season or to Psyche's self-appointed tasks; but on that day Persephone comes again to stand by her mother's throne on Olympus, and Psyche seizes her chance to speak to her.",
      "Persephone's color is better now, and her hair loose as befits her mother's springtime daughter, but something about the way she holds herself makes it all too clear that this was the woman who made herself Queen of the Dead rather than hapless victim of an abduction.",
      "Psyche is no longer surprised about the nature of her wedding gift; in fact she suspects that Persephone might have guessed more accurately at how she'd feel as a new bride, uncertain of her place, than any other had.",
      "\"Thank you,\" she says fervently, taking Persephone's hands in her own; despite all the time that has passed, doesn't need to explain why or for what; \"it did--it does come of use to me.",
      "More than I might have guessed.\"",
      "And Persephone laughs, Queen again for an instant rather than maiden.",
      "\"Spare me and my lord any inconvenient arrows, wife of Eros, and consider your debt repaid.\"",
      "\"I promise,\" says Psyche, with the confidence of one who speaks for herself and not just her husband, and squeezes Persephone's hands as carelessly as she would those of her sisters.",
      "But even as she steps away, Ariadne's pale, frightened face catches her eye.",
      "Psyche herself must have looked much the same, years before.",
      "She's come prepared, though; holding her gift for the new bride, Psyche approaches and says: \"I thought this might be of use to you.\"",
      "Ariadne smiles."

    "text": "Aphrodite had her eyes on Artemis for a long period of time. There was the fact that Artemis was good looking, but more importantly she took a vow of chastity, which was ridiculous. Poor girl who never knew about pleasure and desire, and Aphrodite thought it was her responsibility to enlighten her to them. She threw a flirty glance at Artemis. Artemis overlooked her. She tried to brush by her body suggestively. Artemis got away very time. She tried that voice. Artemis had no response to her. It was really frustrating. At the end it was quite anti-climatic. \"Hey, do you want to make out with me?\" Aphrodite asked when she caught a moment that Artemis was alone, finally getting fed up with the situation. It was ridiculous how hard she had to try for teaching this boring girl about sex. That she could get the benefit to taste Artemis' body was just a side benefit. All right, major benefit. Artemis was silent for awhile. Then she said, \"Yes.\" Aphrodite winked, for once not sure about her hearing. But then it was too good to miss. \"My place?\" \"Show me the way.\" When they got to Aphrodite's perfect bedroom, Aphrodite quickly got to the business as she was still unsure whether Artemis would change hr mind. She put her lips on Artemis's eyelids, then slowly moving downward to her nose, her face. Artemis's skin was clearly much kissed by the sunshine and the west wind, not unlike Ares, and this comparison just made Aphrodite feel more excited. Would Artemis be as much a warrior as Ares on the bed? She moved to the lips and it was smoother than she expected. She caressed her lips with her tongue until Artemis made an impatient sound. Then their tongues tangled together. It was vigorous as if Artemis had seen it as a hunt that she needed to secure hr prey, and she was clearly a good hunter. However, while Aphrodite enjoyed being devoured in Artemis' kiss, she had a war to win, and her hands sneaked down to hold and felt Artemis' taut breasts. She played with it, lightly rubbing over the nipple, and tortured the another. Artemis' moan clearly showed that she was doing it right, and Aphrodite smiled internally, mouth moving down to lick and teased the left nipple with her teeth. and stayed so long that Artemis pulled her hair, clearly annoyed at her negligence of the other. Aphrodite pulled her moth off Artemis, appreciating the wet swollen red nipple, and moved on. It was just not done to pander to the bed mate's every need. Otherwise they might get to be weird and thought they were in total control. The contrast just looked so impressive, any way. Ignoring Artemis' sharp glance, Aphrodite moved down Artemis' body, feeling the strength underneath the skin, and bit the inside of the thighs lightly. After she felt Artemis' shivering, she moved to the place that was her final destination. She used her tongue and used every of her technique and felt proud and satisfied when Artemis climaxed under her ministration. The days after that Aphrodite didn't get to meet Artemis very often - the wild forests and lakes were not good for Aphrodite's sensitive skin. But when she met her Artemis looked so normal, so distant that Aphrodite wondered if she remembered the secret kiss and ouch during the night they shared? Did she touched herself the same way she learnt from Aphrodite? Aphrodite wanted to smile because she was probably the first person to know the supposedly chaste goddess this way, but as she still was interested in Artemis, propriety was probably the rule of the game here. Anyway, Aphrodite was a busy goddess. A few days later there was still nothing from Artemis. Not a coy smile. Not a flirty glance. Not an indiscreet message. Nothing. It was just mean, Aphrodite thought. Maybe she should do something to remedy this situation. She couldn't let people say that Aphrodite was only good for one night. So imagine her surprise when she found Artemis kissing her against the wall forcefully. Aphrodite was quick in the affairs of love and desire though, so she decided to enjoy it without asking questions. She wasn't sure when she'd got naked. Artemis's firm hands surveyed her body, finding her sensitive spots and when she stopped, Aphrodite pouted and tries to put her hands on Artemis' skin to get some actions, but Artemis stopped her, ordering in a stern voice not unlike her father, \"Hands down.\" Aphrodite raised an eyebrow and said, \"Really?\" Apparently Artemis had an unseen interesting side. Artemis glared at her. \"You should learn to listen to an order.\" Aphrodite laughed. Obedience? For a goddess of love? But then Artemis stopped her action and Aphrodite was pragmatic about sex, so she said said, \"All right\". Artemis continued and she was really good at getting Aphrodite all hot and bothered. Aphrodite felt Artemis' fully clothed body against her and felt a tinge of excitement feeling the texture of the fabric on her naked skin. Artemis looked all serious and concentrated, which made Aphrodite raise a corner of her mouth. But soon she was pulled into hot desire and forgot her clever remarks when Artemis did that thing with her tongue. After that, Aphrodite leaned onto the wall and said, \"You surly are eager today.\" \"Why not?\" \"Considering that you seemed to overlook me these days...\" \"You didn't ask either.\" \"So...\" Aphrodite said, \"Do you want it to be a regular arrangement?\" \"Sure.\" \"I would have never thought hearing this from you.\" \"I'm my father's daughter too. I don't turn away from pleasure.\" \"Good. Next time do give me a prior note. Busy, you know.\" \"All right. See you next time.\" Artemis left without giving Aphrodite any time to suggest taking a bath together. Well, her loss, Aphrodite thought. Nevertheless she was satisfied as more sex with a good partner was always good. She couldn't wait for the next time with Artemis.",

    "text": "\"No,\" Jon had told him a thousand times. But after so many times, he realized that he didn't care what Connington said. She would be his. He stole her quickly, he stole her hastily. He stole her with the only indulgence of greed he would ever experience. He had no idea she would fit his home more than he did. It was too cold and dark for him, too drastic, too lonely. She loved it. He'd taken her under her father's watchful gaze, her mother's careful eye. She swam with the others -- the beautiful red-haired beauty and her auburn brother, the small boys with their toes still on the sand, the stern, long-faced one who'd thrown her in. Just one tug on her ankle and she's mine, he'd told himself. Just one tug and he had her -- but that didn't mean she was his. Everyone knew of Arya Stark, with the claws of a wolf but a cunning all her own, more likely to growl or snarl than to dance or sing. He'd heard the tales of her beauty and had gone for a look, never expecting the overwhelming urge to bring her home that he couldn't combat. He took her to a world of spirits, of solemnity, of never looking back. \"I'm sorry,\" he kept saying, the words escaping through his lips, a free fall of lies. She could see it in him, she could detect his desperation, his longing, his determination. She tried not to speak to him. It nearly killed her. \"Can Gods die?\" she asked him once, after he'd blown out the candle in their room, both of them on their separate sides of the bed in the pure pitch black. \"Yes,\" he answered after a while. \"I suppose so.\" She scooted closer to him in the dark. Her mother missed her terribly, she knew. Robb would have no one to laugh at, Sansa would have no one to pick on, Bran would have no one to unwind with, Rickon would have no one to run around with. But father and Jon -- they understood. She felt them down here, felt them in the hollow stone and dark halls and the past captured in the present. Perhaps that was it. Her Tully ancestors were lost in the smog of the next world, but she could hear her Stark ancestors howling to her from below, pleased she'd come to join them, excited that one day she'd be a park of their pack. She didn't miss her mother, or Robb, or -- yes she did, she missed them everyday. But however much she'd loved them, it was a small price to pay to call this beautiful abyss home. \"Who are you?\" she asked him once, lounging in the bed he'd once slept in alone, head hanging off the side and hair cascading to the granite that separated them from souls he cared not to think about. She let her arms hang down, her fingertips grazing the floor, her chiton bunched by her shoulders. Eventually, her grey eyes drifted up to his violet ones, which were scrutinizing her intently. \"I -- I don't know.\" Still upside down, she raised her eyebrows. \"You what?\" He bit his lip. Anxious. \"I don't know.\" \"You don't know who you are?\" she questioned. Her skin turned pink, the blood rushing to her face dangling inches from the granite floor. He shook his head. She snorted. \"Swell.\" One bite, they said, one nibble and you're done for. He watched her rip off the juiciest chunk with her teeth. He could almost hear her family's collective sigh from somewhere in the lands above them. She gave him a haunting, maniacal grin, teeth bloodied from the juice dribbling down her chin. \"I adore pomegranates,\" she told him before heading off for a half a year, back to whence she'd came -- the family he'd stolen her from. He shuddered, but replayed the memory that night under his lonely sheets. While she was gone, he missed her. He missed the crack of her neck in the morning, the drone of her snores while she slept, her hungry eyes following him across hell. It was emptier than it had been ever before, echoes lining the walls where her footsteps might have sounded, the whispers of the dead floating up to him when her deep breaths weren't there for him to listen to. She killed him, but he needed her back -- now more than ever. He needed her face sneaking up on him while he studied his reflection, her flippant comments about those below them, her hidden curiosity about him. After two moons, Jon Connington sent a whore to his rooms. It had been a terror to get her down here unnoticed, and she had demanded an atrocious price from him, which he had begrudgingly agreed to. But she would accept the gold afterwards. When he asked why, the whore told him she'd been sent away within minutes. When Jon returned to his rooms, there was a message awaiting him. I suggest you not try that again, Connington, lest you wish to be castrated. But if you do, wouldn't you think it more clever to send a Northern girl? It killed him to watch the flowers bloom up above, vibrant and lively and reaching up to the heavens where he might have been, once upon a time. Ready for their life to begin. But when he saw the flowers die, he sunk back into his -- their -- bed with a grin. She was coming back to him, and he could hardly wait. \"Aegon!\" It was her fierce bark echoing down the corridors, and not a dream this time. How titillating, to hear his own name roll so freely out of her perfect mouth; it sent him reeling. He stood in the shadows when she neared him, and in secret he could watch her journey down the aisle in a rush. In a rush to see him. She would deny it to her death, he was sure, but he grinned all the same. In a fortifying act of courage, he embraced her from the back without a word. She jumped and let out a yelp, and he allowed himself a small laugh before she elbowed him away. But she grinned wildly. \"It seems your days above have treated you kindly,\" he said, taking in her glowing skin, her red mouth, her flaring hips. She grew nearer and nearer. \"It seems your days without me have made you bolder,\" she said liltingly, with a haughty smile upon her face. \"I hope you didn't have too much fun while I missed you up above.\" \"It was torture,\" he told her honestly. She drew closer, and his heart jumped into his throat. \"For us both,\" she agreed, but Aegon couldn't wrap his head around the fact that she had missed him as well. \"Arya...\" he mumbled, not able to look away from her feral grey eyes. \"You're going to be the death of me.\" With a catlike grin, she crashed into him, knocking him back into the underground stone, kissing him hard and full. His mind jumped around -- wondering if she could hear his heartbeat, feel his stick sweat -- before he replied in equal intensity, flipping her back against the wall. Her moan went straight to his cock and he shivered as she pushed him into the bedroom he'd been alone in for so long. \"Yes,\" she said, though he couldn't remember what he'd said before she kissed him. \"I suppose so.\"",

      "But however much she'd loved them, it was a small price to pay to call this beautiful abyss home.",

      "He shuddered, but replayed the memory that night under his lonely sheets.",
      "While she was gone, he missed her.",
      "He missed the crack of her neck in the morning, the drone of her snores while she slept, her hungry eyes following him across hell.",
      "It was emptier than it had been ever before, echoes lining the walls where her footsteps might have sounded, the whispers of the dead floating up to him when her deep breaths weren't there for him to listen to.",
      "She killed him, but he needed her back -- now more than ever.",
      "He needed her face sneaking up on him while he studied his reflection, her flippant comments about those below them, her hidden curiosity about him.",

      "Ready for their life to begin.",
      "But when he saw the flowers die, he sunk back into his -- their -- bed with a grin.",
      "She was coming back to him, and he could hardly wait.",

I have practically all of the Dover clip art books based on the 20s and one of the cover images is the image that I would end up choosing for Eurydice. There were lots of haughty looking women for Cora Persephone, but I knew the right one was a particular pearl advert because the lady is half shadowed, half in bright light and the symbolism was just too perfect. Dried pomegranate purple; a deep pomegranate red; and gilt old gold are the major color scheme, complete with Eurydice dancing on fallen leaves and the title underlined in a fancy purple rose fabric pattern.

(Yes, I did spend a lot of time thinking this through. *blushes*) The font is FangSong because it looked cool and I liked the name.

But I thought that some indication that's the myth we were tackling was appropriate so he got a piano. *yawns* Anyway, this was a lot of fun doing something totally different for me: not at all my usual art style for podfics and I had to try to convey what the podfic was and still make it look Roaring Twenties. I hope I succeeded ^u^ The bonus collage This collage was super freaking hard! OMGS SO HARD. I knew that I wanted more of the story to come through, and I really wanted the end of the fic especially to come through, especially because it ripped me to shreds and I liked it. So we get Orpheus being the focus and leaving, diminished without his love, who stayed in the dark with the other denizens of the Underworld who are grasping at him and Cora who anchors her there (reflected in the ring that is the same color as the background that Eurydice dances in). Cora half in the light and Orpheus who is in the light but still a shade walking away from the piano down below. *wipes eyes* In any case, the podfic is beautiful and so expressive and touching.

    "text": "Jeeves and Wooster had become immorti-thingummy some decades before. At first it was a lot of fun and games, but the wheeze had become rather depressing as the friends and relations began to drop off. Finally, the last but one of the old Drones had shuffled off the mortal coil and gone through the glass darkly. We had snuck into the nursing villa to visit Bingo and he had known us immediately. Hadn't recognized his own children or granchildren, but he knew me instantly. Wooster had wept brokenly against the Jeevesian chest after each night, but we hadn't the heart to stay away in his last days. It had been even worse than watching Aunt Dahlia go, the final days of the last of the dearest chums. We'd recounted all our tales of love and adventure, which was topping, but we knew it was only a matter of time before the wailing and gnashing would commence. Finally, it did. We oozed in one evening and the rooms were empty of Bingos and filled instead with mourners. One of the duaghters, who rather took after her mother looked at Wooster narrowly and asked if my father was still living. Thankfully, Jeeves kept the wits about him and got me out of there before I crumbled like a loaf confronted by a fish. We hovered about at the back of the mourners during the burial. The heart was bruised purple and blue and green. If Jeeves had not been there, I have no idea what would have become of Wooster. About a month after Bingo went the way of all Drones, we lounged about our lair on Mount Olympus, eating some ambrosia that Anatole had made without too many of those bally marshmallows and tossing cards into one of Hermes's flying shoes while Mackintosh snoozed by the Jeevesian feet. \"Dashed distressing, what?\" I said feelingly as a six of diamonds bounced off one of the thunderbolts Marduk had left behind on his last visit. Jeeves was still trying to get the scorch marks out of the setee. We could have gotten a new one, but the feelings of nostalgia had rather crashed in on us. \"Mr. Little's passing was a most poignant event indeed,\" said Jeeves, wiping away a tear from the damask cheek. He stood then, and whiffled over. I curled up in his lap and tossed a few more mournful cards while Macintosh snorted and pedaled his feet. Finally, I had a sort of a thought about something pleasant from the old days, something that would not jar the heart. \"Remember the time you turned into a centaur?\" Jeeves's breath caught and his eyes went very dark and soulful, like a lovestruck but ruggedly handsome cow. He began to glow pink about the edges, which was a funny little trick that Zeus had played on us when we first became immortal. We gave off a roseate hue whenever we were feeling, ah, affection and caring. \"Yes,\" he said, humming an eerie tune that set all the bodily hairs on end and set the body to attention. Wooster glowed rosily as well. \"Remember the unicorns?\" I said, struggling not to tear off the Jeevesian toga and then turn into a shower of gold and have my way with him right there. We had been rather off our snuggling schedule what with Bingo's decline, and I wanted the first reunion to be rather more spectacular, the type of union that made us glow the deepest, ruddiest color, the one that showed that the most delightful tumble had nearly melted out the bones of the both of us. Jeeves bobbed the lemon. \"They will not come to us now,\" he said gently, his hue pinkening further. He kissed the golden hair. \"But we never even tried, afterwards, to see them, to say goodbye.\" Somehow that seemed terribly sad and awful. \"They only come to virgins,\" said Jeeves, still in that gentle voice, the one that made me want to kiss him all over. \"And we are no longer...\" he looked almost shy, the sweet man. Woosters are not apt to lightly throw in the towel and admit defeat, even in the face of silliness. \"We'll bring them some daffodils,\" I said firmly, shifting to adjust the part of the toga that had begun to tent. \"At least they will know that we remember them, that we are grateful for their friendhip.\" The e.s met the Jeevesian orbs, which twinkled like the sky full of stars behind that aurora bora-whatsit. \"You know, like in that wandering cloud splendid grass doo-dad that you like so much.\" Wooster was folded up in the Jeevesian arms and kissed soundly on both cheeks. \"If you wish it, certainly,\" said Jeeves, nuzzling the ear most deliciously. A shiver ran through the willowy frame. I adjusted the toga and explained about the spectacular tumble and he beamed at me and agreed. \"Yes, darling, of course, we can wait until our feelings grow more acute.\" So, Jeeves and Wooster left Macintosh with Anatole for a few weeks and set off to find the unicorns with a suitcase full of daffodils. First, we sallied back to the old metrop for a visit, now certain that no one would recognize us. I found a truly fruity little rolling bag bedezined with a sort of youngish feline called Hello! Jeeves had chuckled at me and kissed me, right in the stall at Camden Market. It was such a lark to be able to be open with him in that way, and I held the firm, capable hand like a lovestruck schoolboy. I took him to the Ritz and all the nicest places, just as I had wanted when we were young. Nothing was the same, of course, but we had a delightful wheeze all the same. Then we sallied forth to an old haunt, the place where we had first, well, whatnot. In those days, I had played with the unicorns while Jeeves was a centaur, learning the c. tricks and games. neother of us understood our own feelings terribly well, even though we knew we wanted to stay together. How silly we had been, and how young. We sat out in a field for a very long time, weaving garlands of flowers. Eventually, the centaur Bane came and told us what Jeeves had already said. They would not come to us now that we had known each other as lovers. We left the suitcase full of daffodils and as we strayed from the clearing, we saw the unicorns come out and take up the garlands we had made. They nodded to us and bowed, and we bowed back. Perhaps it was enough. That evening, we sat around a fire with the centaurs and burned mallowsweet and herbs and looked into the flames. We had grown used to this, having been made members of the herd back in the old days, and we saw portents there of the future. And then I understood that we could look in on the descendants from time to time, even if they came to number as the stars. Jeeves held Wooster against him and we sang soulful songs, the same s. s.s that the centaurs had taught us before the first time Wooster turned into a sparkling shower and made, er, thingummy, with Jeeves. It reminded the young W. that there were still friends about the place. After a longish while, Jeeves levered up and took my hand and we found the selfsame glade, and nestled together, pashing, until dawn. It was scrumptious. Jeeves is truly the most delicious flavor in all the universe. We woke at sunset the next day,nestled closely together, and I looked deep into the Jeevesian e. \"I love you, Reggie... I'd like to, erm, thingamajig, in our old flat. What do you say?\" Jeeves beamed and tousled the golden hair. \"I say that you are the most specific dream rabbit.\" And we glowed together, then, just the right shade of rosy red. Late that night, we nestled together, breathless, naked and sticky. Jeeves brushed the golden hair out of the face and kissed the forehead. \"I love you, Bertram. No matter what happens, remember this, my own darling.\" I looked up at him, then, glowing with love and affection, \"I know, Reggie. You know I love you, too, I hope?\" His smile deepened. \"I know you love me, too,\" he said.",

The dead. And he couldn't even rule them in the same sense that Zeus and Posidon controlled their domains. He wasn't allowed to take them before their time was up in really ironic ways unless they had somehow pissed off Zeus, in which case he was willing to look the other way. And once they were dead he had to make sure that they had a place to stay that wasn't too crowded and find something for the bad ones to do, and keep the good ones from wandering into the area reserved for the bad ones and accidentally ending up with punishments they didn't deserve and... He wasn't even allowed to create an undead zombie army with these souls he supposedly ruled and wreak havoc across the earth! Basically, ruling the dead sucked, and he hadn't even gotten a queen! He was lonely, and bored, and sick of doing his job. Gods shouldn't have to work! He should at least get to have a few nymphs, but no, they were immortal and never died. And none of them were particularly interested in relocating to hell permanently, even to become a queen. So Hades brooded, and angsted, and counted the decades. And sometimes, he plotted. oooOooo The Seven of Swords Thoughtless, impulsive behavior, secret plans or hidden wits, the possibility of failure if intellect fails There were only so many times that she could romp through the same field, picking the same cornflowers that would re-grow overnight to braid into each other's hair, laughing and singing the same songs. The Nymphs didn't think so, but then they didn't have a brain between them, and Persephone, being a demi-goddess, was far more intelligent. And right now, she was bored. She looked at her cousin Athena, a fierce warrior and strategist who already had a devoted group of followers. Or her cousin Hephaestus, who build wonderful creations in his forge! All her mother would let her do was frolic in the same field, day after month, year after decade. Honestly, she was sick of it. oooOooo The Nine of Wands An unassailable position of order and discipline, a secure position that might falter, courage and stability, cautious and defensive, inner strength Hades was cautious, however, of upsetting Zeus' order too much. As the god of the dead, it wasn't like his life could get that much worse, but there was always Prometheus there, in the back of his mind, showing that there was a worse alternative. Still, Hades had a plan, and with discipline, and courage, and a little bit of luck, it might just work. Her flaw was her routine, and her mother's complacency. The daughter was as lovely as any nymph, and a demi-goddess in her own right, as was his due as one of the highest gods. She appeared innocent, but he was the judge of souls, and he could seen beneath her fake smiles. Her mother would be busy this week, with harvest festivals across the world, and would be even less attentive than usual. If he was cautious and stuck to his plan, he would soon have himself a queen. oooOooo The Eight of Swords Damned if you do, damned if you don't, to live in fear or to move and risk being cut to pieces On the other hand, she knew the stories about her Uncle Zeus. She had a fairly good idea of what Hades intended to do with her. She was looking for a more grown up life, but she wasn't sure that she wanted to be that grown up just yet. Part of her wanted to look around, to explore this new land. But part of her thought she should be finding an escape route, back to the surface - it happened somewhat frequently in the stories her Uncle Zeus told. Another part of her wanted to stay in this one suite of rooms that Hades had dumped her in, where she would presumably be safe from the dead souls that filled his land and wait for her mother to find her. And yet another part of her wanted to be hidden from her mother's gaze forever, to escape from that cloying, mindless world. In short, she wasn't sure if she was glad to be here or not, if she wanted her mother to rescue her or not. The only thing she did know was that this world was new and different than the one she was used to, and she wanted to see more. oooOooo The Empress The mother goddess, one who both provides and withholds, one of fertility, comfort, power, nature, overprotectiveness, and possessiveness It didn't matter that Zeus had dozens of conquests younger than her, human and goddess alike. It didn't matter that Persephone's cousins were making choices like that of their own. Persephone was her daughter, and only she had the right to make choices for the girl! For centuries, Demeter had accommodated her brother and had nurtured Prometheus' little pets. But that ended now. Zeus might be the weather god, but she could call forth the storms and make barren the earth just as easily as he could. And as long as he refused to get her daughter back, as long as Hades refused to give her back, the precious mortals would suffer. And then they would all see how her precious brothers felt. Without the simpering mortals giving them worship and sacrifices, how long would the vain Zeus last? With hundreds dying from her winter, filling up Hades' realm, how long would he defy her? They had taken her daughter and betrayed her, and they would both pay for it dearly. oooOooo oooOooo oooOooo The moral of Demeter's story is everything in moderation. oooOooo The real moral of this tale is that Zeus is kind of a jerk.",

    "text": "\"Everything is more beautiful because we're doomed.\" -- Achilles Patroclus and Achilles. Achilles and Patroclus. Their names are synonymous with conquest, with death. Their victories are legendary, their feats lauded. Side by side always, they've fought countless battles, strewn a path of terror and awe from Macedon to Sparta. Great Kings have bowed before them. The gods themselves have trembled. They are unstoppable, unbeatable. Together, they are synergy, they are poetry etched in blood. Until Troy. Until Hector. *** When Achilles had announced they were off to war (he hadn't asked; Patroclus hadn't expected it), the war to end all wars, Patroclus had thought nothing of it. Just another battle, just another victory. Until he'd heard the rumors, whispered with the same sort of reverence used only for Achilles. Hector, tamer of horses, the greatest general the Trojans had ever known... Hector, the one man who could best the mighty Achilles in battle... Hector, commander of the best army in the land... There is a wild light in Achilles' eyes these days, an eerie calm that envelops him like a shroud. Every day, he's up before dawn, pushing the men past endurance with training exercises that last well after dusk. Every night, he pores over maps of Troy, analyzes letters from generals who have fought against Hector or served him in the past. For the first time in his life, Patroclus feels unease. In sleep, he can hear the Syren's call. Always, it is the same. Only death awaits you on this path. Leave him, before he betrays you. His dream always ends with an image of ebony and gold, forever twined, forever out of his reach. *** The once white beaches of Troy are stained copper and rust. The blood of men, of dying dreams. Patroclus feels the murmurs before he hears them. His sword and armor still glisten red, even though his battle is over. Bodies lay scattered around him, a mute testament to his might and superior skill. All is as it should be. Then he hears the chants. Hector...Hector... Patroclus stands on the low rise, watching the fight below with a sinking heart. Hector is a god on the battlefield, as if guided by the hand of Ares himself. His sword gleams, flashing silver in the sun as he slashes his way through the crowd of Mycenaean soldiers. They are no match for him. Strong, sun-bronzed thighs flex gracefully with each pirouette, a muscled sword arm swinging in perfect time. A dance that Patroclus knows too well. He doesn't need to turn to know Achilles is watching beside him. Watching and calculating. Waiting. *** The war should have lasted weeks. In the second month, everyone had boasted of being home in time for the Feast of Dionysus. By the second year, the men had stopped speaking of home altogether. Home had become the tents, the ships, the battlefield, the sand. Home had become Troy. Patroclus eats fish and drinks brackish water and dreams of the silk sheets on his and Achilles' bed in Thessaly. He dreams of emerald grass and fresh mead and how Achilles used to smile for him. Achilles prowls the beaches alone. He does not sleep. *** \"You long for the day you'll finally face him, don't you?\" Patroclus asks, when he can no longer bear the distance between them. \"I long for his flesh beneath my sword, that is all,\" Achilles answers, but his voice sounds stilted. Wrong. \"What is it about him that captures you so?\" Desperation colors Patroclus' tone, and he curses himself for his weakness. \"I...\" Hesitation, from a man who knew not the meaning of the word. \"I wish...I wish I knew.\" What of us? Patroclus longs to ask. What of us if you have him? But he keeps silent. In truth, he already knows Achilles' answer. *** He cannot be beaten... and the whispers spread like wildfire. The walls are impenetrable...and no one can deny their truth. Hector is breaking our armies like a prized stallion...and Patroclus wants to rage at the gods for abandoning him. All Hector can talk of is facing Achilles...and a shiver runs down Patroclus' spine. He finds Achilles sharpening his sword. His hands are steady, but the look in his eyes betrays them both. \"I dreamed of the River Styx again last night,\" Achilles finally says. He doesn't look up. \"And?\" Patroclus asks, quietly. Every breath seems too loud in the space between them. \"They say...\" Achilles' voice drops, \"they say welcome, brother.\" \"And Hector?\" Achilles shakes his head and says nothing at all. *** Patroclus barely waits for Achilles to roll away from him before speaking. Their bodies are still slick with passion, the soft skins beneath them tangled with sweat. \"It's not me you see anymore when we do this.\" The words sound as if they are coming from far away. Achilles' rage is quick, ice-cold and all-encompassing in its power. He rolls back, using his weight to pin Patroclus in place. His fist closes on Patroclus' throat, and squeezes. \"It is always you,\" Achilles hisses. Patroclus looks up at him, calm and removed. He doesn't even feel Achilles' hand on him. His heart is already numb. \"Then why is his name the one in your eyes?\" *** The feast is one of truce, a gesture between Priam and Agamemnon for negotiations. In truth, they realize their armies need the rest. In secret, they are afraid of losing. And winning. The gods weave spells of protection and assurance. The men lay down their arms and bathe in the river, anointing themselves with scented oils and the promise of a few nights of peace. Achilles barks out orders and haunts the great hall, checking and double-checking every detail. Patroclus sits alone on the beach, sand sifting through his fingers, and ignores the Syren's call in his head. Only death awaits you here... He's been dying for years. He's used to it. *** \"For the gods,\" Priam and Agamemnon declare at the head table. \"For the gods,\" the men shout, and tilt their cups. The ground is stained with wine and offering. Patroclus jealously guards his goblet and watches. Watches Hector, dark-haired and gracious, laughing at Odysseus' jest. Watches as Achilles stares, not moving, not speaking, a predator to the core. Watches as Hector finally lifts his head and meets Achilles' unflinching gaze for the first time with his own. Lightning strikes. The ground trembles. No one save Patroclus notices. Ten minutes later, both Hector and Achilles make their excuses. Patroclus refills his goblet and follows. *** Hector and Achilles. Achilles and Hector. Mortal enemies, famed warriors, brutal strategists. None of the accolades mean anything here on the edge of the beach with only the moon to light the way. Patroclus stands in the shadows, alone, and watches the death of war. Breastplates and tunics fall. Bare skin is worshipped and revered. Lips touch, slide over willing flesh. Promises are whispered, carried in the ocean breeze. They are poetry etched in moonlight. Patroclus' goblet falls from numb fingers as the Syren laughs, the sound echoing until there is nothing else. ***",

    "text": "\"Across the fields of mourning Lights in the distance\" -- U2 The burning glare of the afternoon sun gave way to the more muted rays of twilight as each side dragged corpse after corpse off the field. Hector looked around, an odd sense of grief winding through him. He wondered what this bloodied, mud-bogged expanse of land had looked like before the armies had set foot in this once peaceful vale, wondered if it had been a place of beauty and gathering. Now it would forever ring with the echoes of screams and the scent of burning flesh. Smoke from the burning pyres lit the purplish sky, enveloped everything in shades of grey. Hector's eyes burned from the acrid scent of charred flesh, charred wood. It helped to hide his tears. He sank onto the ground in front of a small fire, meant to keep the chill of the evening at bay as everyone worked under the flag of truce. He laid his sword in easy reach, and eased the clasps of his shield from his chest. Sweat mingled with blood along the muscled planes of his chest. So much blood spilled in this campaign, so much blood to keep the enemies of his allies at bay. As his gaze traversed the landscape, he caught sight of a golden-haired warrior, one of the enemy soldiers, striding towards him. Hector remembered seeing him in battle earlier -- the soldier had fought as though Ares himself had been guiding his hand. In the gleaming rays of the dying sun, the other man seemed golden as Apollo himself, and moved with an arrogance that could only be from Zeus. The Gods definitely favored this one, Hector thought. The other man dropped next to him, held out a flagon of wine. Hector took it gratefully, and they passed it back and forth in comfortable silence for a while. \"Good fight today,\" his companion finally stated. Hector glanced out across the fields again, the sky still streaked with smoke. In his mind, he heard the bright laughter of men who would never again embrace a lover, never hold a flagon up to the Gods in celebration. \"Any day when good men die is not a good day,\" he replied, throwing another log onto their small fire. \"Your comrades will be remembered. What more could any mortal ask?\" Hector thought of the fields of his homeland with sudden, fierce longing. \"To grow old and love his family,\" he replied, thinking of his new wife, who would be waiting for him when he got back to Troy. His companion clapped him on the back, mirth shining out of knowing blue eyes. \"An idealist in the middle of a litter of burning corpses. How noble.\" \"My beliefs need no apology,\" Hector replied tersely. \"No, of course not.\" The other man held his hands out in supplication. \"My apologies to you, brother.\" \"Accepted.\" Hector passed the flagon back with a smile to show all was forgiven. \"Share another drink with me?\" \"You realize I am your enemy?\" Hector shook his head. He was weary of fighting. \"Tonight, my brother, I am all the enemy I need.\" \"I can see that,\" the other man replied thoughtfully, and took a long draught from the flagon. \"Our quarrel will still be here in the morning,\" Hector continued, and accepted the wine with a nod of thanks. \"Tonight we honor the dead with drink and stories. It's the custom of our country.\" \"In mine as well.\" Piercing eyes regarded Hector for a moment. \"Your shield is very distinctive. You're Trojan, aren't you?\" Hector nodded. \"Are the horses there as fast as everyone says?\" Hector found himself relaxing at the mildness of the question. \"Faster,\" he laughed. \"It's like bottling the wind to ride one. Provided you can stay on its back long enough.\" A flash of even, white teeth. \"Untamable, are they?\" \"Some have the gift, others don't,\" Hector shrugged. \"It's the same with everything, I expect.\" Another glance at his companion, noting the strange, black armor, the lack of crest upon a battered shield. \"What about you, brother? From what far land do you hail?\" \"Thessaly.\" \"I've heard stories of the beaches there.\" His companion smiled again, a smile of memory and love. It made him look even more ethereal, of the Gods. \"The stories could never do it justice.\" \"And this is where you learned to fight?\" Hector asked, stirring the ashes with a long, wooden stick. Sparks flew up, lit the sky in brilliant pinpoints of light. \"I saw you in battle today. You moved like a lion on the prowl. I've never seen anyone fight like that.\" \"Now you have,\" the other man nodded, no hint of pride in his voice. Just a calm acceptance of his superiority. \"Modest as well,\" Hector chuckled. His companion did not return such sentiments. \"Modesty is for maidens, not warriors,\" he stated. \"You have every reason to be proud of your own prowess. I, too, noticed you in battle.\" And, finally, he smiled slightly. \"You would be a worthy opponent.\" Heat skittered up Hector's spine. \"I've no wish to cross swords with you on the field.\" \"Honest of you.\" They continued to watch the pyres. \"Is it true that the walls of Troy cannot be breached?\" \"Many have tried.\" Hector thought about the golden walls of his home, its towering columns, their majestic rise from the ground. It was, to him, the most beautiful sight in all of the world. Soon, he'd see it again. \"None have been successful. And none shall be as long as I draw breath.\" \"Rest easy, my brother.\" A strong arm clasped Hector's bicep, and he stared down at the callused fingers. He could still see the rust stains of blood under his companion's nails. \"I'm not here to seduce you out of the secrets to conquering your lands.\" Hector continued to look at the hand on his arm, felt the warmth and tactile strength clear through to his bones. \"Then why are you here?\" The answer was clearly, simply spoken. \"I only sit with the best.\" Hector could only nod; in truth, he had no words in the face of such naked, open honesty. He continued to watch the hand on him -- battle-scarred and rough, made for wielding a sword, made for killing and war and destruction. He curled his own hand around it, watched as they slid easily together, coiled around each other with an almost audible click. \"It's a beautiful night,\" his companion said, glancing up at the first stars twinkling through the haze of smoke. \"Yes, it is.\" Hector risked rubbing a thumb across the other man's wrist, felt the jump in a rapid pulse. \"We are still enemies,\" he reminded them both. \"Only out there.\" Hector felt the tugging on his wrist, allowed it to be brought up to soft lips, sharp nip of teeth. Felt the answering tug low in his stomach. \"Here we are simply two men.\" Hector's breath caught at the need in a low voice. \"Nothing is ever that simple,\" he whispered. Blue eyes softened in understanding. Their hands flexed comfortably together once again. \"In this moment it is. And this moment is all there is.\" \"Do you seduce everyone thus?\" Hector murmured, leaning imperceptibly closer. \"With promises of the pleasures without consequence?\" Full lips parted, showing a flash of pink tongue. \"Is it working?\" \"It's an alluring thought.\" Closer, and closer still. Hector felt as if his body were no longer his to control, as if the Gods had taken over, left him without free will. It was strangely liberating. \"If you will not match me on the field, I would have you match me here, with the stars as our witness.\" Hector's vision narrowed to the lips inching ever closer to his, promising oblivion and rest from endless battle. Promising a truce, just for tonight. Sinking into the nectar of this stranger's lips was easier than Hector would have believed possible. ***",

    "text": "It wasn't the idea of dying that troubled Achilles. What need had he to fear Death, a soldier's oldest, most cherished friend? Death was a terror for mere mortals, not for warriors who stood toe to toe with the gods and beat them at their own game. Warriors were meant to be invincible, impervious, immortal even after their lifeblood ran out onto the battlefield and their bodies turned to dust. No, dying did not worry Achilles, even though he humored his mother's whims and had allowed her to coat his body with the water of the River Styx as a shield. Thetis may have been a goddess, but she was still a mother with a mother's worries, and Achilles was son enough to want to ease her mind. No, it wasn't death. It was the idea of being forgotten that kept Achilles up at night, pacing in front of the fire instead of joining Patroclus under the warm furs of their shared bed. Just the thought that one day his name would not be remembered, was an anathema, made his body shiver and his blood freeze. He was meant to be deified; his song was meant to be sung by bards and minstrels; his name whispered in hushed reverence, and tales of his battles and prowess shared for generations to come. To have his name fade away into obscurity would be a fate worse than death. But it wasn't until he laid eyes on Hector on a dusty, white beach just outside the famed walls of Troy that Achilles understood his true destiny. That it wasn't only his name that would be sung and remembered and immortalized, but that of a worthy opponent as well. In that moment, he understood that the true worth of a warrior was the quality of his enemy, and in Hector, he'd found such a man, this legendary tamer of horses and a famed leader whose skills were said to match Achilles' own. After setting his gaze upon Hector, Achilles worried no more at being forgotten - for he and the Trojan prince were destined for great and terrible deeds that would be sung until the end of time itself. ***",

They tell you it isn't possible, that you're not the only one who's been in a copilot's headspace while they died. And you're doing much better, they say, than most of those others. You're back in the jaeger, although you insist on piloting it alone. They tell you it'll kill you. You know it will, don't care, even. You feel Patroclus lingering in the corners of your mind, but you can only manage to hold on to him in your sleep and in the drift. You simply won't accept another pilot pushing him out, not until you can help him. He's in pain, he's bewildered, lost even. Odysseus, more a jaeger technician than a pilot these days, once remarked in his pointedly un-pointed way that maybe, on some metaphysical level, copilots only die in pairs, that the first to die is still alive in the mind of the other, that in surviving a catastrophe one pilot can keep his fallen partner from true death. Smoothly he added that the thought was merely the product of a philosopher's dream, but the message stuck you like a splinter. You know, you know you're the reason Patroclus is so damn scared, you're alive so he can't be dead and now he's stuck and it's agonizing. They tell you that piloting alone will kill you, say it's not worth chasing Patroclus' ghost through the drift if the only thing you'll find is your own ruin. They're idiots. You can always see Patroclus in your dreams. There's nothing to chase. He needs to be freed.",

    "text": "Sitting in the meadow was the only actual pleasure I had. It didn't provide much, anyway. Not anymore. Mother only let me out for a few hours every day because of all the men vying for my attention. They were all simple-minded and not worth my time. I had no interest in it, the sport of love. Just a few days ago, Apollo had come to see me. He had provided a drop of sunlight but didn't let me touch it because it would hurt me. I had no interest in touching the thing because it was so bright. \"Will you have the honor of being my wife?\" he asked me after a while of pointless chatter between us both. I had taken one step back and closed my eyes. \"You say I will have the honor. Why is that? Why can't we both have the honor? Tell me, Apollo, what color are my eyes?\" I asked him. I heard shifting and grass being crushed under feet. \"Emerald. They are emeralds and just as valuable,\" he said and I felt his fingertips brush my cheek, near my eyes. I opened my eyes and gently brushed his hand away. \"Crafty with words, aren't you? Leave my presence and return when you can love someone else as much as you love yourself,\" I said and walked away, dismissing him. Two days after, Hermes decided to pay me a visit he said was \"long overdue\". He spoke of flying and how he could take me places I hadn't been. How I could meet more of the other gods and goddesses. Once he was done rambling, he had asked me to marry him. I had tuned in and out of his rant but came back just in time to hear that. I had climbed up a tree we had been near and hung upside-down. I covered my face with my hands. \"What color are my eyes?\" I asked, feeling the blood rush to my head. \"The color of ivy. And conceals just as much,\" he said touched the back of my hand to pull it away from my face. \"I refuse, Hermes. You speak far too much about things you know nothing about. I do not wish to see the other gods and goddesses, nor do I wish to leave this place. You assume that what interests you must interest others. As well as you seem to only care about yourself, being that's what you mostly spoke about. Leave me,\" I said and dismissed him. Yesterday, I heard word from my half-sisters that the men were calling me an \"ungrateful shrew\". I paid no mind to it. I knew I wasn't. I simply did not wish to be with a man who could see no farther than his own reflection. Currently, I was making a crown of flowers I had picked. My time outside was almost up and I hadn't finished the crown because I had just started. Perhaps I could extend it another ten minutes to finish it. I felt the ground shake under me and I got to my feet, dropping my flowers. The meadow split and Hades in his chariot emerged. \"Persephone. Come with me,\" he said and reached out a hand. His black hair fell in his face and covered one of his black eyes. He stared at me intensely, so much so that I felt heat flood to my cheeks. \"Why should I?\" I asked, crossing my arms. \"Please. Will you come with me?\" He asked me. He tried very hard to show that he didn't care if I got in voluntarily or not, but something seeped out. Perhaps it could be called fear of rejection. He didn't want me to say no. \"Why should I consent to go with you?\" I retorted, staring at him. \"Please, Persephone. I would not do anything you do not wish I do. Will you give me a chance?\" he responded. He did not give off the same air that Hermes or Apollo did. He gave off a vibe of \"why would anyone want me?\". It was refreshing. I covered my eyes with my hands and asked, \"what color are my eyes?\" \"Green. No, wait. Dark green. Like grass... or maybe I said that wrong... look, just get in,\" he said with more power in his voice once he realized he let a little bit of his insecurities through. I dropped my hands from my face and placed one in his. \"Take me,\" I said to him. \"No! Persephone! Don't!\" I heard my mother shriek from behind me. I turned around to see her running towards us. I quickly got in the chariot and looked at Hades. \"Let's go,\" I commanded and he stared at me as if he never expected me to command him. \"I'm sorry, Mother! Goodbye!\" Hades pulled the reins so we turned around and went back into the Underworld, my mothers screams being cut off as soon as the ground closed overhead. I did not interact much with Hades after that. We had meals together and said goodnight, but that was all. I spent most of my time in my room. Hades sometimes left me things to read outside my door but I wouldn't see him. That only lasted about a month, though. Eventually, I couldn't take the isolation. I walked to the throne room where I knew he would be. He was gazing off into the distance, his hand on the side of his face. \"Hello,\" I said to him. His head snapped to me, his attention on my face. \"Hello, Persephone. Is there anything you want?\" he asked and stood up from his throne. \"Yes, actually. I wish to speak to you,\" I responded and met him halfway. He paled a little but looked into my green eyes and nodded. \"What is it you wish to speak about?\" he asked softly. \"Why me?\" I responded and looked up at him. \"Death is meaningless without life. Just as life is meaningless without death. You are life, light, warmth. A woman brings warmth and beauty to the most barren and desolate places. I am death. Only here to give meaning to life - to you. I wanted you here to know what it felt like to... be with a woman. But I see that you fear this place, you fear me. Do you wish to go?\" he spoke softly, as if speaking in any other way would hurt me. I looked into his black eyes. Yes, they were black, but they held a warmth. Not life, but kindness. \"I do not wish to leave. This is a new place I had never seen before. I usually do not like new places, but this one seems fine. Actually, I would like to spend more time with you. Isolation does not please me,\" I said and tried for a smile. \"I agree, by the way.\" \"Agree?\" he seemed shocked that I would say anything but \"I wish to leave, let me go.\" I wonder if he just got used to people thinking he was bad, just because of his position as God of the Underworld. \"Life is meaningless without death,\" I said and looked into his face. I hoped he would get the message: that I was meaningless without him. Hope and happiness filled his expression and made it wonderful to gaze upon his face. Any other woman would look upon his face and recoil. Black hair, black eyes, pale skin, and a scar running from his hairline down his nose, over his lips and down to his chin. But I did not fear him. I could not fear him. No, he was not a perfect man. He seemed introverted and he feared rejection, but perfect was boring. That was why I had rejected Apollo and Hermes. Perfection was not what I wanted. I wanted this man, Hades. Months passed, but I did not notice it. We spent our time reading and learning and playing. But mostly speaking. We spoke a lot and that made me happy. He spoke and I listened and vice versa. We were both interested in what the other had to say. Even when we weren't, we just listened anyway. We would play hide-and-seek and guessing games. He also taught me how to fight. He was gentle, though. Always so gentle, as if anything other than gentleness and softness would make me fear him. Yesterday, I was informed that I was away a year. Time passed so quickly here, I noticed. It didn't feel like I had been gone more than four months. I had been sitting with Hades in the throne room, resting in the circle of his arms after we had raced. I was faster than him, but he had gotten much better. Then, we had sat in front of his seat, his arms around me and his chin sitting atop my head. \"Persephone?\" he murmured, his voice deep. The sound of his voice always relaxed me. \"Yes?\" \"May I tell you something?\" \"Anything.\" He pulled away from me just slightly and sat in front of me. He tilted my face so I looked at his own. A coy smile was playing at the corners of his lips. \"I love you. My heart is yours to do with as you wish. I feel like you've known this for a while now, but have been waiting for me to say it. So, I've said it. I love you,\" he said and inhaled deeply, the smile winning over and lighting up his face. I let out a little giggle and covered my mouth. \"Oh, dear. I'm sorry. I'm just... very happy. I love you too,\" I said behind my hand. He reached up slowly and removed my hand from covering my mouth. He stared into my eyes, then slowly down the bridge of my nose, then down to my lips. He bit his own then his gaze locked with mine again. \"Persephone? May I...\" he whispered, not seeming to be able to get anything else out. I leaned forward and closed the distance between our lips. He tasted of sweet wine and pomegranates. His lips were soft and inciting. An arm slowly wrapped itself around my back and his hand found my own. He laced our fingers together as he kissed me. His kiss was the only thing not gentle about him. It was filled with passion and hunger, as if he could not get enough. Neither could I. We didn't get enough until he carried me to his room and we consummated our love. I was no longer a virgin goddess. As we lay on the bed, he had held me close to his body as if someone were going to take me away from him. We both fell asleep and when we had woken up, he had been caressing my arms and face, as if he didn't believe it had actually happened. That I was actually his and his alone - because I wasn't. \"Your mother wishes for you to return,\" he had said into my hair. My mother... I hadn't thought of her in ages. Nor about my half-sisters. \"I do not wish to return. I wish to stay with you... and be your queen,\" I said to him, my hand sliding from his chest to the side of his face. I looked up at him pleadingly. \"You must. I know how you hate being told what to do, but please do this. For me,\" he said and smoothed my red hair. It had gone from a warmer copper to a bright fire-red in the time I've been here. My skin color was white cream and the freckles over the bridge of my nose and my cheekbones stood out more. My eyes were now a bright, lucid green. I had gone from having girlish beauty to being an exotically beautiful woman. I no longer belonged in the world above us. I belonged here, in the Underworld, as Queen. \"What is my mother doing, Hades?\" I had asked him. \"It's winter, up above. But it's a never-ending winter. For a year now. Too many things - people - are dying... you mother wants you to return. And unless you do, the winter will never end. Please, you must go,\" he whispered into my hair but his arms tightened around me. He stroked my back and my arms and kissed me lovingly. He did not want me to go either. \"I must, mustn't I?\" I sighed against his lips. Tears filled my eyes. What if she were to keep me above and I would never see him again? Never be where I belonged again? \"Yes... do not think that I want you to leave, my love. That is not the case. Do not cry,\" he said and kissed the place where a tear had fallen. I placed both hands on his face and kissed him, pulling him close to me. I pushed him away after a few minutes and sat up. \"Hades, I will return.\" I looked at him and he looked up at me from his position on the bed. He ran a hand down my hair and caught a strand at the end. \"How?\" he asked, looking into my face. He looked determined, his jaw set. \"Give me a pomegranate,\" I said to him and ran a hand up and down his bare chest. \"No, Persephone! You'll forever be tied to the Underworld! If you don't come back, you'll die. A part of your soul will be stuck here,\" he said, sitting up. He grabbed my hands tightly, fear in his eyes. \"I'll return. I'll always return for you,\" I said and kissed him. Tears slid down his face. \"You can die. I can never see you again. You'll be lost to me,\" he whispered against my lips. \"Only if I don't return. And I will return. I promise you,\" I said and kissed him hard. He had nodded and he made love to me again, then we both fell asleep. He did not let go of me the whole night. Now, I was in our room. I had my different robes - all various shades of black, grey, purple, and navy - packed away and I had my crown. It was silver made to look like intertwined vines with sapphire and amethyst stones set like flowers. It had been made months ago, but he gave it to me today as a parting gift and to officially state that I was his queen and the Goddess of the Underworld. I walked out and stood next to the Acheron with Hades to wait for Charon to arrive. He had his arms around me from behind, as always, his hands on my stomach. His chin rested on my shoulder. \"I will wait for your return,\" he whispered. He dropped one arm and reached behind him for half a pomegranate. \"How long should I be away?\" I asked him and lay a hand over his, resting on my stomach. \"Eat three. Winter you will be with me only and autumn you will be with us both. Spring and summer, you will be with your mother,\" he said softly as I laced our fingers together. \"Only three?\" I protested, turning to face him. I looked up into his face, trying to sway him otherwise. Sorrow was evident on my face and he took my face in his hands, setting the half on a table he conjured up out of shadow. He pressed his marred lips to mine and sighed into my mouth. \"Yes, only three. Do you wish for more things to die unnecessarily? No, you do not. I know you do not,\" he said and looked into my eyes. I looked at the scar that ran down his face. He had never told me how he got it. \"How did you get your scar, my love,\" I asked softly. I knew Charon was behind me but I wished to be with Hades just a little longer. \"Fighting off my father before he devoured me,\" he whispered and looked away. \"It's hideous, I know.\" \"No. It's not to me. It's part of who you are. Just as your hair and your eyes are. I love every part of you,\" I said softly and he smiled. \"Persephone... it's time to go,\" Hecate said from behind me. I hadn't known she was the one sent to bring me back. Hades took the half of the fruit and took out three seeds. He placed them on his tongue but did not swallow. \"Take them from me... Goddess of the Underworld,\" he said, his words held a subtle lisp because of what was on his tongue. I kissed him hard, his tongue exploring my mouth as mine did his. He left the seeds on my tongue as he pulled away. I looked at him somberly. \"I love you,\" I said and swallowed the seeds and got on the boat. Hecate placed an arm around my shoulders as Charon led us out. \"You look different, little one. Whether it be the air around you or your looks or perhaps your new position as Goddess of the Underworld, I will not know. Which do you think it is? Considering your mother wanted you returned as you were taken. Consequently, that is not the case being that you seem to be an entirely different person, outside and within,\" she said and gave me a fond smile. I did not return it. \"I am different and I am the same. But I am not who she wishes I was anymore. I don't think I can be the daughter she wants ever again,\" I said to her, feeling drained. \"That is obvious, young goddess. But she wishes to see you,\" she said and dropped her arm. \"Get one thing straight,\" I said to her, looking at her face. \"Say it.\" \"I am no young goddess. At least not mentally anymore. And I do not belong in the world of the living.\" \"You see, that last bit I am sure is wrong. Because you belong to both worlds,\" Hecate said as we got to the end of the river. We both got off and I paid the ferryman. He did not take my money, though. \"I take no wages from the Goddess of the Underworld,\" he said to me and turned the boat around and rowed away. Hecate and I walked out into the daylight. Everything was white and dead and everything seemed barren. \"Mother?\" I called out and looked beside me. Hecate was gone. \"Mother!\" I saw a figure emerge, hair the color of wheat framing a beautiful face. One that was clearly grieving. \"Mother!\" I called out and ran to her, my hair coming lose from the knot I had put it in. It fell down my back in waves and curls as I ran to her. The cold burned my lungs and made it painful to breath, but still I ran. My mother took me into her arms and buried her face into my neck, sobbing my name. Slowly, the air warmed up and the white snow melted. \"Oh, that horrible man has finally let you go!\" she sobbed into my neck. I pushed her away so I could breath. \"He's not horrible. I never would've come back had he not asked me to,\" I said, looking at her. Her eyes searched my face, perhaps for any remains of her daughter? \"He took you from me!\" \"Because my father told him he could! And I went willingly!\" \"What has happened to you?\" she whispered and brushed her fingertips over my cheek. \"I grew up. Something you were trying to stop. I became who I was meant to become, the Goddess of the Underworld.\" \"You mean he... took you?\" she looked pale and swayed as if she were about to faint. \"Yes. Because I allowed him. He's gentle, Mother. And kind. He loves me, just as I love him. And he's selfless. That was proven when he chose the lives of the people you were killing with the cold over keeping me for himself. But I made the choice to go back.\" I said, trying not to show how annoyed I was by the fact that she was speaking about my husband this way. \"Go back...?\" she asked, seeming to be confused. \"Three months, I will spend days here and nights with him. Then three months after, I will be only his. You may keep me for the six months prior to that,\" I said calmly and she looked about ready to have a conniption. \"You're going back!? To him?\" she shrieked. I flinched. \"He's my husband, so it's only right. The deal was made already, so accept the fact that you get me at all,\" I snapped and she straightened, accepting what has been done. \"Fine. You may keep him as your husband,\" she said, resigned. \"I would even if you said I couldn't,\" I said, setting my jaw. She led me inside to eat and I realized I missed the Underworld already. It was my home. But this was my mother and the deal had been made. I had to keep my end up. And I would. I had promised Hades and I was a woman of worth. We kept our promises to the people we loved.",

      "\"What is my mother doing, Hades?\" I had asked him.",
      "\"It's winter, up above.",
      "But it's a never-ending winter.",
      "For a year now.",
      "Too many things - people - are dying... you mother wants you to return.",
      "And unless you do, the winter will never end.",
      "Please, you must go,\" he whispered into my hair but his arms tightened around me.",
      "He stroked my back and my arms and kissed me lovingly.",
      "He did not want me to go either.",
      "\"I must, mustn't I?\" I sighed against his lips.",
      "Tears filled my eyes.",
      "What if she were to keep me above and I would never see him again?",
      "Never be where I belonged again?",
      "\"Yes... do not think that I want you to leave, my love.",
      "That is not the case.",
      "Do not cry,\" he said and kissed the place where a tear had fallen.",
      "I placed both hands on his face and kissed him, pulling him close to me.",
      "I pushed him away after a few minutes and sat up.",
      "\"Hades, I will return.\"",
      "I looked at him and he looked up at me from his position on the bed.",
      "He ran a hand down my hair and caught a strand at the end.",
      "\"How?\" he asked, looking into my face.",
      "He looked determined, his jaw set.",
      "\"Give me a pomegranate,\" I said to him and ran a hand up and down his bare chest.",
      "\"No, Persephone!",
      "You'll forever be tied to the Underworld!",
      "If you don't come back, you'll die.",
      "A part of your soul will be stuck here,\" he said, sitting up.",
      "He grabbed my hands tightly, fear in his eyes.",
      "\"I'll return.",
      "I'll always return for you,\" I said and kissed him.",
      "Tears slid down his face.",
      "\"You can die.",
      "I can never see you again.",
      "You'll be lost to me,\" he whispered against my lips.",
      "\"Only if I don't return.",
      "And I will return.",
      "I promise you,\" I said and kissed him hard.",
      "He had nodded and he made love to me again, then we both fell asleep.",
      "He did not let go of me the whole night.",
      "Now, I was in our room.",
      "I had my different robes - all various shades of black, grey, purple, and navy - packed away and I had my crown.",
      "It was silver made to look like intertwined vines with sapphire and amethyst stones set like flowers.",
      "It had been made months ago, but he gave it to me today as a parting gift and to officially state that I was his queen and the Goddess of the Underworld.",
      "I walked out and stood next to the Acheron with Hades to wait for Charon to arrive.",
      "He had his arms around me from behind, as always, his hands on my stomach.",
      "His chin rested on my shoulder.",
      "\"I will wait for your return,\" he whispered.",
      "He dropped one arm and reached behind him for half a pomegranate.",
      "\"How long should I be away?\" I asked him and lay a hand over his, resting on my stomach.",
      "\"Eat three.",
      "Winter you will be with me only and autumn you will be with us both.",
      "Spring and summer, you will be with your mother,\" he said softly as I laced our fingers together.",
      "\"Only three?\" I protested, turning to face him.",
      "I looked up into his face, trying to sway him otherwise.",
      "Sorrow was evident on my face and he took my face in his hands, setting the half on a table he conjured up out of shadow.",
      "He pressed his marred lips to mine and sighed into my mouth.",
      "\"Yes, only three.",
      "Do you wish for more things to die unnecessarily?",
      "No, you do not.",
      "I know you do not,\" he said and looked into my eyes.",
      "I looked at the scar that ran down his face.",
      "He had never told me how he got it.",
      "\"How did you get your scar, my love,\" I asked softly.",
      "I knew Charon was behind me but I wished to be with Hades just a little longer.",
      "\"Fighting off my father before he devoured me,\" he whispered and looked away.",
      "\"It's hideous, I know.\"",
      "\"No.",
      "It's not to me.",
      "It's part of who you are.",
      "Just as your hair and your eyes are.",
      "I love every part of you,\" I said softly and he smiled.",
      "\"Persephone... it's time to go,\" Hecate said from behind me.",
      "I hadn't known she was the one sent to bring me back.",
      "Hades took the half of the fruit and took out three seeds.",
      "He placed them on his tongue but did not swallow.",
      "\"Take them from me...",
      "Goddess of the Underworld,\" he said, his words held a subtle lisp because of what was on his tongue.",
      "I kissed him hard, his tongue exploring my mouth as mine did his.",
      "He left the seeds on my tongue as he pulled away.",
      "I looked at him somberly.",
      "\"I love you,\" I said and swallowed the seeds and got on the boat.",
      "Hecate placed an arm around my shoulders as Charon led us out.",
      "\"You look different, little one.",
      "Whether it be the air around you or your looks or perhaps your new position as Goddess of the Underworld, I will not know.",
      "Which do you think it is?",
      "Considering your mother wanted you returned as you were taken.",
      "Consequently, that is not the case being that you seem to be an entirely different person, outside and within,\" she said and gave me a fond smile.",
      "I did not return it.",
      "\"I am different and I am the same.",
      "But I am not who she wishes I was anymore.",
      "I don't think I can be the daughter she wants ever again,\" I said to her, feeling drained.",
      "\"That is obvious, young goddess.",
      "But she wishes to see you,\" she said and dropped her arm.",
      "\"Get one thing straight,\" I said to her, looking at her face.",
      "\"Say it.\"",
      "\"I am no young goddess.",
      "At least not mentally anymore.",
      "And I do not belong in the world of the living.\"",
      "\"You see, that last bit I am sure is wrong.",
      "Because you belong to both worlds,\" Hecate said as we got to the end of the river.",
      "We both got off and I paid the ferryman.",
      "He did not take my money, though.",
      "\"I take no wages from the Goddess of the Underworld,\" he said to me and turned the boat around and rowed away.",
      "Hecate and I walked out into the daylight.",
      "Everything was white and dead and everything seemed barren.",
      "\"Mother?\" I called out and looked beside me.",
      "Hecate was gone.",
      "\"Mother!\"",
      "I saw a figure emerge, hair the color of wheat framing a beautiful face.",
      "One that was clearly grieving.",
      "\"Mother!\"",
      "I called out and ran to her, my hair coming lose from the knot I had put it in.",
      "It fell down my back in waves and curls as I ran to her.",
      "The cold burned my lungs and made it painful to breath, but still I ran.",
      "My mother took me into her arms and buried her face into my neck, sobbing my name.",
      "Slowly, the air warmed up and the white snow melted.",
      "\"Oh, that horrible man has finally let you go!\"",
      "she sobbed into my neck.",
      "I pushed her away so I could breath.",
      "\"He's not horrible.",
      "I never would've come back had he not asked me to,\" I said, looking at her.",
      "Her eyes searched my face, perhaps for any remains of her daughter?",
      "\"He took you from me!\"",
      "\"Because my father told him he could!",
      "And I went willingly!\"",
      "\"What has happened to you?\" she whispered and brushed her fingertips over my cheek.",
      "\"I grew up.",
      "Something you were trying to stop.",
      "I became who I was meant to become, the Goddess of the Underworld.\"",
      "\"You mean he... took you?\" she looked pale and swayed as if she were about to faint.",
      "\"Yes.",
      "Because I allowed him.",
      "He's gentle, Mother.",
      "And kind.",
      "He loves me, just as I love him.",
      "And he's selfless.",
      "That was proven when he chose the lives of the people you were killing with the cold over keeping me for himself.",
      "But I made the choice to go back.\"",
      "I said, trying not to show how annoyed I was by the fact that she was speaking about my husband this way.",
      "\"Go back...?\" she asked, seeming to be confused.",
      "\"Three months, I will spend days here and nights with him.",
      "Then three months after, I will be only his.",
      "You may keep me for the six months prior to that,\" I said calmly and she looked about ready to have a conniption.",
      "\"You're going back!?",
      "To him?\" she shrieked.",
      "I flinched.",
      "\"He's my husband, so it's only right.",
      "The deal was made already, so accept the fact that you get me at all,\" I snapped and she straightened, accepting what has been done.",
      "\"Fine.",
      "You may keep him as your husband,\" she said, resigned.",
      "\"I would even if you said I couldn't,\" I said, setting my jaw.",
      "She led me inside to eat and I realized I missed the Underworld already.",
      "It was my home.",
      "But this was my mother and the deal had been made.",
      "I had to keep my end up.",
      "And I would.",
      "I had promised Hades and I was a woman of worth.",
      "We kept our promises to the people we loved."

    "text": "The god was not unkind to me, when he did lay me down, his jokes at my expense were like a brother's jokes, before he raped me when I laid there, all trembling, not in awe I did not bleed, his jests were bad enough, my ears and cheeks blood-hot, on fire from shame. Repeated in my ears: hold still, you'll learn you'll be a woman soon, you'll like this stuff, His salty breath against my lips. Some god. He smelled like fish. What would you like, my sweet? A golden mantle? (hold still, child) A crown? A dolphin chariot? A fine black pearl? Fine dresses? (thumbing mine against my side, he'd shucked it up to paw my bound-up breasts) I did not want to try his patience then, in case he left me full of aching holes and nothing else to show I'd known a god so I asked him to make me then a man inviolate to spear and biting blade no arrow-point to split my hairy skin and if I loved a man, to not lie down and let him poke me full of holes again. 'I want to be a hero, gracious god, with iron thighs and bloody iron cheeks, no longer fit to be penetrated; (and death to him who tries, poor wretch, poor wretch!) Make me here and now a tall-grown man.' I did not care just then about my parts, but only that I would not be laid down. He rumbled laughing, bristling on my throat I wished that he could die mid-laugh. Some god. His briny cock hung limp against my leg. You clever little chit, you've got it planned but boys are made for love, and so are you. (It wasn't love he said. Forgive me all this.) I meant all that I'd asked. I meant a man. A man could live, and more, a man could fight. and to Lord Neptune's credit, the old fool I never did get up a girl again. He changed my nature when he laid me down. The boy was always mine. I made no theft. I even tried to please the child with gifts, ones sensitive boys like, a brace of doves, I made such gifts and played him on the lyre such tender songs as only lovers play. He hid. He fled from me. He ran. Off flew the doves, the lyre slipped unstrung, and I gave chase. I am a man. I hunt. Achilles, hunter, killer, mad for love. His throaty cries did something to my blood-- his golden back, the muscles of his thighs his coltish footfalls, crying father's aid all drove wrath backward, down into my groin and left me scalded, throbbing with desire Dark alchemy, desire's grimmest joke -- all sorts of men get hard after a kill, how many during? But I digress. He tried to face me, staggered at the altar, (he'd hoped for sanctuary in this place but god, I trust, was with me on this one) He looked so fair, so wrathful and so young The little hero. My boy hated me. I knew it -- blindly, terror in his eyes, the sweat that streaked his youthful jetty brow A cornered hare. A snared-up bird. A doe. But when he spoke he spoke just like a lion-- \"Don't touch me. Not in here, you can't. You can't.\" \"I will,\" I said, \"young lion, yes, I will. God or no god. It's down to you or me.\" He spat at me, and threw his arms around the figure of the altar, worked in gold. I would have slit his throat right then and there, or crushed him with embraces in my arms. I seized him by the hair and tore him down. I think he cried throughout. And when I'd done, I wrung his neck, with hands that burned to touch him only, to hold him when he shivered. The little hero. Him I had admired, and him I could not hold, I held to kill. When life had left, I wanted all the more.",

    "text": "Hades is not a normal goddess. She has heard it said countless times. It is considered odd that she is far more content within the eerie, cavernous regions of the Underworld than the glittering, golden halls of Olympus. She makes no attempt to wield her charms upon either gods or mortals and scoffs at those who try to court her. Her siblings bemoan it since, while it is perfectly alright for the goddesses of the second generation, like Artemis and Anthea, to choose to remain untouched. the same could not be said of Hades, for she was one of the originals. It is her duty to produce more of their kind. Just look at Zeus! (Although he is admittedly a rather poor role model.) But Hades cares not until she glimpses a boy laughing as he breaks free from the nymphs that are supposed to be watching after him. He is more handsome than any of the flowers that surround him, but that is not why she gasps and has to turn away from the sight of him. It is the feelings that the sight of him brings, ones that threaten to overwhelm her completely. She knows then that this dainty son of Demeter is the one she desires--needs--to have. The ever poised Hera could be counted on to cite the proper customs to be observed in such a situation since the realm of marriage is her own. She would tell Hades to have Persephone initiate the courtship since, after all, he is a god, even if he is only a minor one. But Hades is a full fledged goddess, a possessor of mighty power, and what she wants she takes--just like her siblings before her. And that is how Persephone finds himself in the Underworld, dragged off through a fissure in the Earth as he bends to pick the beautiful flower that Hades let grow for him. Their courtship is a slow one, but Hades wouldn't have it any other way. Persephone needs time to grow, as it were, to stretch out his roots in this new, unknown place and find his holding in it. The only love he has ever known is that of his mother's and that is the kind that wraps around tight, forming chains out of the overwhelming fear that the person might one day leave. But Hades shows him a different sort, allows him to soar freely--graceful as a songbird--around her kingdom. And it is when he finally returns to her, a tentative smile on his lips, that she knows he understands at last. She comes to him that night, scorning clothes since they would only interfere with her intentions. She can tell he is as virgin as she by the way he turns an attractive shade of red, averting his eyes from her bare form. He can hardly tear his eyes away only a few minutes later, however, when she comes astride him and takes what she wants inside of herself. There is a flash of pain, of course, but it is so quick that it hardly matters. Persephone frets over her after, trying--absurdly--to apologize. He keeps at it until she rolls her eyes and grinds down against him to prove just how fine she is, laughing fondly when his head thumps back against the pillow. She rides him like that as his hands scramble for purchase on her hips. Her release comes to her like one of Zeus's flashes of lightning, forcing her to cry out. She takes pleasure in feeling the results of Persephone's own orgasm spilling into her, marking her in a way that no one but him will ever be allowed. They remain like that for quite some time, but Persephone recovers his energy eventually. And then he is rolling her over, kissing his way down her body until he is licking inside of her. It is not until he slides his fingers inside of her, tongue placing almost kitten like laps upon her clit, that she comes apart for a second time. He presses an idle kiss to her thigh as she lays there panting. \"You stole me,\" he says. Hades glances down at him, a single brow arched. \"Do you truly mind?\" she asks. She can feel the curve of his smile against her skin. \"No,\" is the answer. And even after Demeter steals him back, if only for a handful of months each year, there is no way to change what has now become fact--Hades is the queen of Persephone and he is her king.",

    "text": "\"And here, close to the springs, lie washing-pools where the wives of Troy and all their lovely daughters would wash their glistening robes in the old days, the days of peace before the sons of Achaea came.\" -Book 22 of the Iliad, translated by Robert Fagles She stands knee-deep in the shallows, the rippling water pulling at her skirts. The lake is much like the one beyond the walls of her city, but much larger, so huge that she cannot see the opposite edge. No matter how she strains her keen eyes--falcon's eyes, one of her brothers had always told her, half-jealously, as his own eyes were too weak to see the center of a target a hundred paces away--all she can see is grey mist, shrouding the corners of the world from her view. Although she has not yet visited the ocean, and only overheard merchant's stories, she supposes that this must be something like it. The wind from across the water is cold on her cheeks, but the waves themselves are soft and warm. She sees the woman coming from far away, striding gracefully through the water. No one could naturally move that fast through waist-high lakewater, but the woman comes as rapidly as if she were gliding. She looks unnatural as well, beautiful as summer, with glossy hair black as jet, clear blue eyes and creamy skin. The wet cloth of her gown clings tight to her shapely body. The girl catches her breath, stumbling clumsily backward, away from this goddess, for surely she must be. The woman lays a smooth hand on her forearm, steadying her in a surprisingly strong grip. \"Don't run, child. I won't hurt you.\" \"Who are you?\" the girl says, her voice barely a whisper. \"Don't you know?\" says the goddess--Aphrodite--as if there was never a question, which there probably wasn't. \"Lady Aphrodite--\" She bows her head, suppliant. Aphrodite places both of her palms on the girl's face, and lifts her head, gazing into her eyes. Something small and bold stirs inside the girl, cutting through fearful awe, and she does not look away. The goddess draws them closer, kissing the girl on her forehead. As her eyesight fades, she hears Aphrodite's voice murmuring into her ear. \"I have a gift for you. May it bring you strength.\" In later years, she will know why the goddess had not wished her luck. When Andromache struggles back into the waking world, the dream is still heavy in her mind. She opens her eyes, still awestruck, and now very confused. Sitting bolt upright in bed, she stares around the room, afterimages of smoky mist and smooth blue-green water searing against the shadowy corners. Outside, the summer sky is spread broad and black and twinkling with stars, the first streaks of fiery daylight appearing in the east. Across the room, there's a golden light cast against the wall, a distorted ring shape. Although the room is warm and stuffy, Andromache feels a quick, sharp chill deep in her bones. She slides out of bed, padding across the room on quiet bare feet. The source of light rests on a cedar chest. It's a metal circlet, meant to hold her hair and veil in place. When she holds it in her hands, the heft of the thing tells her it is, in fact, gold. The band is embossed with a rippling pattern, like ocean waves must be, and three white pearls are set at each side. The cold, shivery feeling returns when she confirms that she's never seen the piece in her life. I have a gift for you. She steals over to the servant girl slumbering in a cot at her bed's foot. Leaning over, Andromache takes the girl's shoulder and shakes her gently. \"Galene, wake up. Wake up!\" Galene struggles to a seated position, pushing herself up on her elbows. She rubs at her eyes, clouded with sleep. \"Go back to bed, Lady Andromache. It's too early. You shouldn't need to dress for hours. See, the sun's not yet risen.\" \"Galene, did anyone come in here last night? Did my mother mention having any jewelry sent? I woke up and found this laid out.\" Andromache holds out the circlet, keeping details of her strange dream to herself. Galene's eyes widen, wondering. \"Oh, my lady, it's beautiful.\" Her hand reaches tentatively out, and she glances shyly up at Andromache through her lashes. \"Yes, you may touch it.\" Galene caresses the wave pattern, brushing one of the pearls with her thumb. \"I didn't hear or see anyone come in. And, look, the door's still barred. How would this have got in here?\" The younger girl begins to look afraid. \"What if nymphs or spirits climbed the palace walls, my lady?\" No nymphs, but a goddess. \"I'm sure it's merely a wedding gift, Galene. Nothing to worry about. I'll ask my mother whether I should wear it for the ceremony.\" The steadiness of Andromache's voice surprises her. Galene nods, looking calmer. \"You should try to sleep again, my lady. You'll need to be well-rested for tonight.\" Andromache assumes Galene is referring to the wedding feast, which will go past midnight, as opposed to the eventual consummation of her marriage. The other girl is quite young, barely thirteen, and her expression at the moment is completely innocent. Besides, she's too timid and conscious of her place to make a comment like that anyway. However, Andromache is old enough, and nervous enough, to see another meaning in her words. She tries to focus on the feast itself, which will surely be magnificent, with all the summer flowers decorating her father's hall, the boars, cows, ducks, and lambs she's seen roasting whole in a line of spits in the palace kitchens, and the music and dancing she loves so much. However, the thought of going to her new husband's bed for the first time is still frightening, even though she knows Hector is a good man who will treat her well. Although the Trojan delegation has been at Thebes for nearly two weeks, she's never been alone with Hector, always accompanied by councilors or ladies in waiting, and he's never seen her unveiled. Hector is handsome enough, tall and wiry with even features and long dark hair. But she's wise enough to know physical beauty is no reflection of the soul. One of her father's council, though considered handsome, looks at her and the other court women like they're pieces of meat. His cold dead-fish eyes make her legs shake beneath her skirts and she feels sorry for his poor wife. Hector, however, also has kind eyes and smiles easily, which speaks far better of him than how he looks. The last time she had seen him she was a girl of eleven, four years earlier, when they were officially betrothed. He was already a young man, though narrower across the shoulders than he is now. She was shy and apprehensive at first, but he had talked to her like one of her brothers. He had learned somehow that she was said to be a talented singer, and had managed to coax her into singing for him. When she had met him for the second time weeks before, he had asked her if she still sang. It gratified her that he had remembered her as she used to be, but she, shyer now that she was older and understood more, had not yet sung for him. Andromache looks very different at fifteen than she had at eleven. The last time Hector had seen her, she'd been a short, delicate little girl. The summer she had turned twelve she had shot up like a weed, and spent a long time tall and flat and feeling stretched. Over the last year and a half, however, she's begun to look like a woman, her hips and chest curving outwards, her body preparing to bear children. She's still rather slender, though, unlike Galene, whose figure is already more rounded than Andromache's will ever be. She is thankful for her height, because Hector is a tall man and her head barely reaches his shoulder as it is. Anxious, and perhaps a little excited--she has been visited by the goddess of love and beauty, after all, which is surely a good sign--she cannot fall asleep, even when Galene's soft even breathing reaches her ears. She sits with her back against the bed frame, still and silent and watchful, as the dark sky bleeds into day. Andromache is roused from her stupor by the sharp clatter of fists knocking against her door. \"Open up, little sister!\" She stands up, her back aching in protest, and hurries to the door, as Galene begins to rouse herself. Lifting the wooden bar closing her room off from the corridor, she swings the heavy door inward. Hilarion, the youngest of her seven older brothers, is standing outside, grinning enthusiastically. \"I thought you'd be awake. I thought I could get you to yourself before Mother and all the ladies came clucking in like hens to dress you.\" In spite of her somber mood, she can't help but smile. Hilarion's name, which means \"cheerful\", was well chosen. Of all her teasing, loving, protective, sometimes smothering brothers, he is the closest to her heart. While her eldest brothers are already married, with babies of their own, Hilarion is only three years older than she. He is also the brother who has acted as her spy these last two weeks, carrying her stories of Hector, as he acts with the men and boys of her father's court, showing off their hunting and fighting skills. It is not prowess with a sword or boar-spear that interests Andromache, however. Does Hector joke with the other men? Does he talk only of the hunt and of war, or do other topics occupy his interest? She holds Hilarion's information close to her heart, secretively, each detail helping her form a rough idea of who exactly she will wed today. Hector can hold his own among all seven princes of Thebes, she knows, a talent she herself somewhat envies. He doesn't talk for the sake of hearing his own voice, but he's not quiet either. He can quiet a spooked horse with calm hands and voice, and spoke well of Thebes's beauty, and of Troy's. Troy's great citadel and mighty walls may be as lovely as Hector says, but her plains, between the ocean and Mount Ida, are not yet Andromache's home. She knows she will leave a part of her behind in the courtyards of King Eetion's palace, and in her city's rugged hill country. But the thought of travel spurs a secret excitement in her as well. She has never left Thebes, and part of her wants to see the surrounding lands, and finally glimpse the ocean. Troy is a greater and richer city than her ally, Andromache's homeland. Perhaps she could someday return to Thebes. But being parted from her parents and brothers will be more painful than anything else. Only Galene and a few other servant women will accompany her to Troy. Thinking of good-byes, she runs to Hilarion and embraces him suddenly, pressing her face into his chest in sudden tears. Hilarion, in unusual seriousness, pats her head gently, and only a little self-consciously. \"Andromache- it's not forever. I'll come visit you when Father can spare me, I promise. Hector's sisters will welcome you, and soon you'll have a baby to take care of. You won't be alone.\" She wipes her eyes, angry at herself for crying. \"I know. But it's hard to leave.\" \"You're brave for a little henchick, sister. You'll be fine.\" Her laugh is shaky but true. \"Fetch some breakfast for my sister, would you?\" Galene doesn't realize she's being addressed at first, then jumps to attention with a little squawk of fright. Andromache has noticed the shy glances she sends Hilarion when he visits them, and has guessed that Galene finds her brother handsome, and knows nothing could ever come of it. Hilarion is not the sort of prince to play around with servant girls. After Galene hurriedly throws a wrapper over her tunic and scurries off for the kitchens, Andromache and her brother sit on the side of her bed. \"If it's any consolation to you, he's plenty nervous too.\" \"Hector? Really?\" \"I got up early to see you, and saw him getting up to go to the stables.\" \"He went riding? What if he's late for the ceremony?\" Andromache's mind rapidly constructs a nightmare scenario where she stands alone before the altar in Thebes's great temple, dressed and ready and abandoned. \"No, you silly little girl. He just went in there to be with his horses. I imagine it calms him.\" \"Don't call me silly!\" Andromache smacks his arm gently. Hilarion smirks. \"I can't really call you a little girl anymore, I suppose. You'll be a married lady by noon.\" She takes a deep breath, allowing the air to settle into her lungs and rest awhile before she releases it. Leaning her head onto her brother's shoulder, Andromache nods in agreement, her face thoughtful. \"She flung to the winds her glittering headdress, the cap and the coronet, braided band and veil, all the regalia golden Aphrodite gave her once, the day that Hector, helmet aflash in sunlight, led her home to Troy from her father's house.\" -Book 22 of the Iliad, translated by Robert Fagles. Before long, Galene returns from the kitchens, laden with oatcakes, goat's-milk cheese, and sliced apples. She hovers nervously by the door, watching for the coming of the queen and her ladies. Andromache eats with as much haste as she can without spilling anything, sitting cross-legged on the bed. Her brother picks stealthily at the cheese when he thinks she's not looking. When the sounds of rustling skirts and quiet chatter come whispering up the women's quarters' corridors, Hilarion, with more than a little of a startled rooster's fluttering, retreats quickly. He pauses briefly on the way out to kiss his sister. Unseen outside the door, she hears the murmur of voices as he greets their mother. Queen Sostrate sweeps into the room, tall and graceful, followed by a small gaggle of attendants. Andromache leaps up, bowing her head respectfully. The queen crosses the floor swiftly to embrace her daughter. Enfolded in her mother's arms, the tension in Andromache's shoulders starts to release. Around them, the other women busy themselves unpacking trunks. One of them, accompanied by Galene, hurries into an adjoining chamber to begin drawing a bath. As they prepare to dress Andromache as a bride, the queen reassures her daughter in hushed tones. \"It's not wrong to be frightened before a marriage, child. Never suppose you're the only one.\" Andromache starts. \"How did you know I was scared?\" Her mother laughs softly. \"Because I know you, my daughter, and I know young brides. I remember, when you were just a little thing, you asked me once if the setting sun would light the hills on fire. You've always been an anxious one. And I remember how nervous I was the day I married your father.\" She pauses, her voice gently teasing. \"Besides, your brother told me.\" Andromache smiles ruefully. She should have guessed Hilarion wouldn't have kept silent. \"You're lucky to have a summer wedding. Mine was in midwinter, and unusually cold. I thought I'd freeze in the litter between my father's gates and the great temple, though I was wrapped in blankets. I would have been shivering with worry even if I wasn't already with the cold, though.\" Andromache has heard stories of her parents' wedding before, but never this part. It is difficult to imagine her dignified mother, now with delicate wrinkles clustered in the corners of her eyes and grey hairs woven in with her dark braids, as a bashful bride no older than herself. Difficult, but not impossible. \"Look at me, child.\" Her mother's eyes are warm. Surprisingly, they are also damp, though she smiles. \"It's no evil to fear change. However, you must remember that showing fear is not always wise. No sane man is unafraid when he rides to battle, but very few will admit it. We women can play the same tricks as warriors. Hold your head high and smile if you can, and you'll be all right.\" Andromache will be Hector's queen as well as his wife, and queens, like her mother, do not cry easily. She swallows hard. \"I will. I promise.\" But she is far from a queen yet, and so she clings tightly to her mother and speaks softly, letting herself be a girl for just a bit longer. \"I'll miss you, Mama.\" The name she called her mother as a little child slips out, past the thickness of unshed tears in her throat. \"We'll miss you too, my daughter. All of us. But--\" \"We need to say our farewells bravely. I know.\" They hold each other for a long moment more, as if gathering the feeling of the other into their memories. Then, slowly, they let go. Andromache knows no future bards will sing of her beauty, and she is too practical to mourn this for long. Neither her face nor her form is exceptional, although she is by no means ugly, or even plain. Beauty is just not a thing one would associate with her. Today, she is almost disturbed when shown her reflection in her mirror's polished bronze surface, for she is so splendid she barely recognizes herself. The features of her face are mostly unchanged, although her wide-set, alert dark eyes are edged in black paint. But the brilliance of her clothes and jewels lends a different light to her. She looks older, and almost magnificent. Her one vanity would have to be her hair, which is indeed beautiful, thick and a rich deep brown. Although it will be covered by her veil, as usual, the women have dressed it in a far more elaborate version of her usual plaited knot. Twisted into position at the nape of her neck, it is still glossy and blackened from the bathwater. The pins holding her braids in place are set with garnets, as are her heavy earrings. If, as they say in far-off Greece, milky rock crystal is water frozen so hard it cannot melt, then surely these deep-red gems were once droplets of blood. The pieces are new, gifts from the Trojan treasuries. The golden bands encircling her bare upper arms, however, are of Theban work, once her mother's. Molded dragon's heads snarl at their ends, biting gently into her skin. It is her dress, however, that is truly glorious. With her mother and her brothers' wives, she has labored over it for weeks now. Cut of fine light wool, purplish-red in color, the flounces of its skirt embroidered richly with vine leaves and summer flowers, it is the finest dress she has ever owned. Tiny discs of gold are sewn into the edges of the fabric, shimmering when the candlelight catches at them. The finery leaves her feeling both liberated and self-conscious. All at once she is weighed down and brilliant, shining. It's an experience that makes her somewhat light-headed. The queen herself veils her daughter, letting the light sheet of pale purple linen float onto Andromache's braids. Tucking the ends of the cloth into place, she slides the goddess's gift over it. The cold gold of the circlet presses against Andromache's forehead, smoothing lines of anxiety from her brow. Queen Sostrate bends down, her lips brushing Andromache's cheek. \"Blessings go with you, my daughter.\" Her voice is whisper-soft, meant only for one girl's ears. A summer wedding might be preferable to a winter one, but the sun beats down on the city, and only a few breezes swirl in the thick air, even on Thebes's highest hill. Sweat runs in little rivulets beneath her bodice, pooling at the small of her back and in the cleft between her breasts, and those heavy tiered skirts stick to her legs. All the city's nobles, as well as the Trojan delegation, have packed themselves into the temple of Zeus, which does not improve the temperature. Before the god-statue, the high priest raises his hands to the heavens and cries out for Father Zeus's blessing. He is a big man, round-bellied, and sports a thick graying beard. He must be much hotter than she, but that does not stunt the enthusiasm of his preaching. Andromache is far too nervous to listen to his words as well as she should. She finds herself staring around the temple, looking everywhere except the man who will be her husband. From Hector she averts her eyes. The Trojan nobles are ranked in the place of honor at the temple's front, filling one side of the space, the side nearer to where Hector stands. Her father, mother, and brothers stand at the other side. Most of the Trojans are older men, but one is no older than Hilarion, with curly black hair and the merest scraps of a beard. His head is tilted upwards, towards the roof. She follows his gaze to the elaborate carvings in the temple's wooden beams. Above them, goats trot across the ceiling, and eagles perch haughtily in the corners of the room. Behind the richly dressed aristocracy, common people mass in the temple square, some clustering in the great doorway. A gaggle of young boys have climbed into the windows, and squat up there, looking down on the proceedings with wide eyes. Andromache envies them their places, where what little wind there is can cool them. The room is full of whispers. Whenever so many people gather, silence is impossible. Someone's foot beats a fretful rhythm against the flagstones. Glancing around, she notices that it is Hector. She finally raises her eyes to him. He is as still as the god-statue itself other than that thumping foot. Beneath his gleaming bronze helm, his brow is furrowed and his lips set in a grim line. His fists are clenched at his sides. Andromache realizes that he is nervous, as her brother claimed. Somehow, this knowledge calms her roiling stomach slightly. Soon, however, a new worry rears up to frighten her. What if she doesn't please him? What if he thinks her plain or dull or too shy, and that is why he looks so harsh? She steps to the side, slightly closer to him, and, slightly breathless at her own daring, knocks her hand against his. Hector flinches, surprised, then looks over at her, raising his eyebrows. Andromache gives him a quick, bashful smile. She can feel her cheeks flaming. Thanks the gods, he smiles back. In front of them, the priest lowers his arms, a broad smile spreading across his plump face, and calls for the congregation to process outside. The words have been said, and the massive stone altar waits beyond the doors. Once that ritual is complete they will be man and wife. Hector takes her hand in his, and they follow the high priest. His grip is firm, if slippery with sweat. His hands are large, long-fingered, and rough with a soldier's calluses. Andromache's weighty wine-colored skirts scrape against the stone floor. The gold discs sewn into her hemline chime and glitter. King Eetion and Queen Sostrate follow them. Until she is Hector's queen, her wedding day will be the only time Andromache is first behind the priest. Temple servants shunt the throng aside, to make room for the nobles crowding outside. At the edge of her vision, she sees one of the little boys in the window scrabbling down from his perch and darting into the mob. The sun blazes directly overhead, like the eye of some great blue beast. The very color of the cloudless sky is blinding. It is noon, and heat shimmers in the heavy air. Andromache walks almost as if asleep. The dream she dreamed the night before was more real to her than this. Her head is spinning; whether from heat or hunger or fear she does not know. She holds tight to Hector's hand and puts one sandaled foot in front of the other. The altar is a broad swath of white stone, carved from some Theban hillside. Lesser priests lead a black bull through the square, draped with garlands of flowers. The crowd reaches out its many hands, touching at the animal's smooth sides. Perhaps touching the marriage sacrifice will bring them luck as well. Andromache and Hector take their places on other side of the priest. An acolyte passes alongside them, pressing a tool on each of them. Andromache holds an earthenware flagon, heavy with water. Hector's hands clasp a bronze knife, the blade curved and cruel. The black bull halts before the altar, well-trained and docile. All the ritual's participants know their roles just as well. As Andromache steps forward, the priest calls out. \"O Immortals, bless this beast, make him pure and obedient to your will.\" Andromache upends the jug, and water sloshes out onto the bull's head, running down between his ears and along his heavy jowls. The animal tilts his head downward with the force of the water, nodding his consent to the sacrifice. \"O Immortals, let his death be swift and smooth.\" Another acolyte strikes him on the head with a wooden mallet, quick as a viper. The beast falls to his knees, stunned. Hector moves into position, bends to one knee, and cuts his throat with the knife. Red blood sprays out, splattering the white cloth of her husband's tunic. It spills over his strong hands and pools on the altar's pale stone. \"O Immortals, let his life's blood feed this union, bringing to it luck and fertility.\" The bull slumps forward in death. Hector stands back, blood dripping from his fingers. Andromache slants the head of her flagon, and the last of the water runs down over him. He wrings his hands beneath the stream, letting the stains wash away. On the altar, spilled water mingles with spilled blood. Sunlight glances off the dark pink surface of the resulting puddle. The high priest slides another knife from his belt of gilded leather. He bends down to slash the dead bull's belly open, pulling a tangle of viscera from the slit. Andromache is no stranger to seeing meat butchered, but the sight of the bull's organs certainly brings her no pleasure. However, when the priest and his jumble of acolytes pronounce that they have seen the signs, and know them to be good, she smiles. Andromache may be joined in marriage to a man all but a stranger, but the gods have sent them lucky omens. And so she smiles.",

      "However, the thought of going to her new husband's bed for the first time is still frightening, even though she knows Hector is a good man who will treat her well.",
      "Although the Trojan delegation has been at Thebes for nearly two weeks, she's never been alone with Hector, always accompanied by councilors or ladies in waiting, and he's never seen her unveiled.",

      "It is not prowess with a sword or boar-spear that interests Andromache, however.",
      "Does Hector joke with the other men?",
      "Does he talk only of the hunt and of war, or do other topics occupy his interest?",
      "She holds Hilarion's information close to her heart, secretively, each detail helping her form a rough idea of who exactly she will wed today.",
      "Hector can hold his own among all seven princes of Thebes, she knows, a talent she herself somewhat envies.",

      "But the thought of travel spurs a secret excitement in her as well.",
      "She has never left Thebes, and part of her wants to see the surrounding lands, and finally glimpse the ocean.",
      "Troy is a greater and richer city than her ally, Andromache's homeland.",
      "Perhaps she could someday return to Thebes.",
      "But being parted from her parents and brothers will be more painful than anything else.",
      "Only Galene and a few other servant women will accompany her to Troy.",
      "Thinking of good-byes, she runs to Hilarion and embraces him suddenly, pressing her face into his chest in sudden tears.",
      "Hilarion, in unusual seriousness, pats her head gently, and only a little self-consciously.",
      "\"Andromache- it's not forever.",
      "I'll come visit you when Father can spare me, I promise.",

      "Hilarion is not the sort of prince to play around with servant girls.",
      "After Galene hurriedly throws a wrapper over her tunic and scurries off for the kitchens, Andromache and her brother sit on the side of her bed.",
      "\"If it's any consolation to you, he's plenty nervous too.\"",
      "\"Hector?",

      "\"I got up early to see you, and saw him getting up to go to the stables.\"",
      "\"He went riding?",

      "The cold gold of the circlet presses against Andromache's forehead, smoothing lines of anxiety from her brow.",
      "Queen Sostrate bends down, her lips brushing Andromache's cheek.",
      "\"Blessings go with you, my daughter.\"",
      "Her voice is whisper-soft, meant only for one girl's ears.",
      "A summer wedding might be preferable to a winter one, but the sun beats down on the city, and only a few breezes swirl in the thick air, even on Thebes's highest hill.",
      "Sweat runs in little rivulets beneath her bodice, pooling at the small of her back and in the cleft between her breasts, and those heavy tiered skirts stick to her legs.",
      "All the city's nobles, as well as the Trojan delegation, have packed themselves into the temple of Zeus, which does not improve the temperature.",
      "Before the god-statue, the high priest raises his hands to the heavens and cries out for Father Zeus's blessing.",
      "He is a big man, round-bellied, and sports a thick graying beard.",
      "He must be much hotter than she, but that does not stunt the enthusiasm of his preaching.",
      "Andromache is far too nervous to listen to his words as well as she should.",
      "She finds herself staring around the temple, looking everywhere except the man who will be her husband.",
      "From Hector she averts her eyes.",
      "The Trojan nobles are ranked in the place of honor at the temple's front, filling one side of the space, the side nearer to where Hector stands.",
      "Her father, mother, and brothers stand at the other side.",
      "Most of the Trojans are older men, but one is no older than Hilarion, with curly black hair and the merest scraps of a beard.",
      "His head is tilted upwards, towards the roof.",
      "She follows his gaze to the elaborate carvings in the temple's wooden beams.",
      "Above them, goats trot across the ceiling, and eagles perch haughtily in the corners of the room.",
      "Behind the richly dressed aristocracy, common people mass in the temple square, some clustering in the great doorway.",
      "A gaggle of young boys have climbed into the windows, and squat up there, looking down on the proceedings with wide eyes.",
      "Andromache envies them their places, where what little wind there is can cool them.",
      "The room is full of whispers.",
      "Whenever so many people gather, silence is impossible.",
      "Someone's foot beats a fretful rhythm against the flagstones.",
      "Glancing around, she notices that it is Hector.",
      "She finally raises her eyes to him.",
      "He is as still as the god-statue itself other than that thumping foot.",
      "Beneath his gleaming bronze helm, his brow is furrowed and his lips set in a grim line.",
      "His fists are clenched at his sides.",
      "Andromache realizes that he is nervous, as her brother claimed.",
      "Somehow, this knowledge calms her roiling stomach slightly.",
      "Soon, however, a new worry rears up to frighten her.",
      "What if she doesn't please him?",
      "What if he thinks her plain or dull or too shy, and that is why he looks so harsh?",
      "She steps to the side, slightly closer to him, and, slightly breathless at her own daring, knocks her hand against his.",
      "Hector flinches, surprised, then looks over at her, raising his eyebrows.",
      "Andromache gives him a quick, bashful smile.",
      "She can feel her cheeks flaming.",
      "Thanks the gods, he smiles back.",
      "In front of them, the priest lowers his arms, a broad smile spreading across his plump face, and calls for the congregation to process outside.",
      "The words have been said, and the massive stone altar waits beyond the doors.",
      "Once that ritual is complete they will be man and wife.",
      "Hector takes her hand in his, and they follow the high priest.",
      "His grip is firm, if slippery with sweat.",
      "His hands are large, long-fingered, and rough with a soldier's calluses.",
      "Andromache's weighty wine-colored skirts scrape against the stone floor.",
      "The gold discs sewn into her hemline chime and glitter.",
      "King Eetion and Queen Sostrate follow them.",
      "Until she is Hector's queen, her wedding day will be the only time Andromache is first behind the priest.",
      "Temple servants shunt the throng aside, to make room for the nobles crowding outside.",
      "At the edge of her vision, she sees one of the little boys in the window scrabbling down from his perch and darting into the mob.",
      "The sun blazes directly overhead, like the eye of some great blue beast.",
      "The very color of the cloudless sky is blinding.",
      "It is noon, and heat shimmers in the heavy air.",
      "Andromache walks almost as if asleep.",
      "The dream she dreamed the night before was more real to her than this.",
      "Her head is spinning; whether from heat or hunger or fear she does not know.",
      "She holds tight to Hector's hand and puts one sandaled foot in front of the other.",
      "The altar is a broad swath of white stone, carved from some Theban hillside.",
      "Lesser priests lead a black bull through the square, draped with garlands of flowers.",
      "The crowd reaches out its many hands, touching at the animal's smooth sides.",
      "Perhaps touching the marriage sacrifice will bring them luck as well.",
      "Andromache and Hector take their places on other side of the priest.",
      "An acolyte passes alongside them, pressing a tool on each of them.",
      "Andromache holds an earthenware flagon, heavy with water.",
      "Hector's hands clasp a bronze knife, the blade curved and cruel.",
      "The black bull halts before the altar, well-trained and docile.",
      "All the ritual's participants know their roles just as well.",
      "As Andromache steps forward, the priest calls out.",
      "\"O Immortals, bless this beast, make him pure and obedient to your will.\"",
      "Andromache upends the jug, and water sloshes out onto the bull's head, running down between his ears and along his heavy jowls.",
      "The animal tilts his head downward with the force of the water, nodding his consent to the sacrifice.",
      "\"O Immortals, let his death be swift and smooth.\"",
      "Another acolyte strikes him on the head with a wooden mallet, quick as a viper.",
      "The beast falls to his knees, stunned.",
      "Hector moves into position, bends to one knee, and cuts his throat with the knife.",
      "Red blood sprays out, splattering the white cloth of her husband's tunic.",
      "It spills over his strong hands and pools on the altar's pale stone.",
      "\"O Immortals, let his life's blood feed this union, bringing to it luck and fertility.\"",
      "The bull slumps forward in death.",
      "Hector stands back, blood dripping from his fingers.",
      "Andromache slants the head of her flagon, and the last of the water runs down over him.",
      "He wrings his hands beneath the stream, letting the stains wash away.",
      "On the altar, spilled water mingles with spilled blood.",
      "Sunlight glances off the dark pink surface of the resulting puddle.",
      "The high priest slides another knife from his belt of gilded leather.",
      "He bends down to slash the dead bull's belly open, pulling a tangle of viscera from the slit.",
      "Andromache is no stranger to seeing meat butchered, but the sight of the bull's organs certainly brings her no pleasure.",
      "However, when the priest and his jumble of acolytes pronounce that they have seen the signs, and know them to be good, she smiles.",
      "Andromache may be joined in marriage to a man all but a stranger, but the gods have sent them lucky omens.",
      "And so she smiles."

He does not voice their names save for Apollo, though he will later draw them down; as he knows the others will not see the reasons as long as the vision stays blinding. He would worry about Prouvaire's insight into dreams and imaginings but the poet looks for love too deeply to see despair at first glance. He knows that in their minds he would be cast as Dionysus and he has no quarrel with this for he sometimes thinks it would be nice. He worships the drink, yes, but he will never worship himself so the comparison, he feels, is void. Dionysus is quick and easy and will not pour all of himself into one being as Grantaire does. If they were to mention it he would laugh and make allusions to an aspect of character he does fit but he would not agree and they would soon forget. In his mind he casts himself as Hephaestus. He considers that if he were to say as much they might still consider the comparisons aesthetic but he will not risk it. True, he is the blacksmith in looks; the one brute among the blessed but despite his artist's eye this is not were his casting comes from. Hephaestus is a creator, a maker, an artist. Though Apollo holds that position in full Grantaire thinks that Hephaestus is one of the Olympians inspired most by the others. And as Enjolras mostly shapes his art into speeches these days the position is, perhaps, open. When he creates Dionysus is by his side pointing to the flaws and making it clear he will never create the level of passion Apollo has even by breathing. That his muse will never lie still on canvas and that his brush will never create anything of such worth. His most common bond to Hephaestus is one of love. They are both bound to one much more beautiful than they could ever be, one who will always deem them unworthy no matter how hard they try. It is easiest (though not easy) to hide their feelings and work on scorning their beacon and try to destroy their bond and focus. Hephaestus made a good try of it; but he had millennia and destroying men, even Gods, must be easier than ridding an idea of a home.",

    "text": "It is better after. Everything is so much better. He knows that there might be a day on the horizon that will bring a jarring onslaught of regrets, impossible wishes, and hopes that cannot be. But everything is still new, and something stops Achilles from thinking about that day too hard. Elysium is an entirely new world. They say that it is paradise - the fields as incorruptible as the people they hold. There is no rain, no tremors of the earth, no violent gales to wreck them or snow to freeze them - just long summer days to bask in, with the West Wind sending in its welcome breeze of cool air. And yet, no day feels quite the same; it is never repetitive or tedious to get from dawn to dusk, but an easy glide through every hour. It is innately perfect, but the people inhabiting it are far from it. There is still so much to talk about and work through: things that have stayed with them from the world above Hades. But they have the rest of eternity to learn from their mistakes, acknowledge their wrongs and their hubris - to change and be better. But right now, these days are on the horizon. Right now, this is the time to find each other again. Achilles cannot fathom that he is here and Patroclus is here, and they have forever. He's not sure what he once expected--certainly never a long life--but this is more blissful than imaginable. Of course he stills feel a crippling clench in his chest when he thinks about why they have this--how they came to be here--but a knowing touch of Patroclus' fingers to his cheek has the torment slipping gently away. They're in the fields, as they often are when the air starts to cool and the sun dips lower in the sky. Long grass envelops them, standing tall and swaying with the wind, keeping them inside their own secret world. Elysium is a shared realm, watched over by Cronos and Rhadamanthus, but they easily find complete isolation whenever desired. Times such as now, when Achilles has Patroclus lying down in the fields, back flattening the grass below him, chin tipped up to the last rays of the golden sun. \"I love this,\" he says, and Patroclus will smile until dimples press into his cheeks. \"I love you.\" He says it often, but never tires of the reaction it draws from Patroclus: the softening of his eyes, still streaked with a hint of disbelief, the deep intake of breath. Patroclus slides his fingers through Achilles' hair, combing through curls as he draws him closer, their foreheads coming to rest against one another. The fields are where they take their time, Achilles trying to touch every inch of Patroclus' skin to hear all the different sounds he'll make. They've never had it like this - others were always just a shadow away: the palace at Phthia, Chiron on the mountain, and men after men in the Achaean camp at Ilium. But now each action can be slow, every glide of lips languid and every press of skin unhurried. \"Say it again,\" Patroclus whispers, and Achilles complies easily, saying it over and over into Patroclus' flesh, until hot breath sears the words into it. He parts Patroclus' thighs further, slotting their bodies flush together, skin touching at every point as their chitons lay abandoned some feet away. His fingers trace every contour, moving up the insides of Patroclus' thighs and dipping into the lines of his Apollo's belt, before he braces his hands just below his ribs. Patroclus holds in a sound that isn't quite a mewl, anticipation thrumming through him as Achilles begins rolling his hips, eyes locked carefully on Patroclus. There's sweat gathering low on their abdomens, pooling behind collarbones, and damping the hair around both of their necks. Patroclus curls his hands around Achilles' arms and reaches up to capture him in a kiss, slow and lazy and sweeter than any ambrosia in the gods' bowls, more delicious and satisfying than the nectar in their cups. Achilles maps out every stretch of Patroclus' bronzed skin, covers all he can reach in soft presses of his lips and open-mouthed kisses, tiny prayers of worship crossing every muscle and bone. In life, Patroclus was a perfection made to fit Achilles and balance him, but in the afterlife, he is sublime. Achilles is a demigod but Patroclus is a star shining just as bright, keeping his path lit and always guiding him. He would the most brilliant star of them all, Achilles thinks, if only the Olympians had been granted a taste of him--if Zeus had felt Patroclus' breath on his neck or if Apollo had watched him stretch like a cat upon waking up. Achilles hastily shifts back to kiss Patroclus' mouth, biting at his bottom lip as Patroclus arches up in a moan and opens up under Achilles' mouth, letting those throaty, breathless sounds be swallowed whole. The prayers keep coming--odes to Patroclus and his body--as Achilles licks at the roof of his mouth and grinds his hips harder into him, drawing out groans like honey dripping from his fingers. Achilles fights a full-body shiver as Patroclus pushes up against him, cocks sliding perfectly as Patroclus scrapes his nails over the nape of his neck, fists a hand in his tangle of hair and tightens his thighs around him. He's panting something in a rush, and Achilles feels the words falling against the corner of his mouth but he isn't listening because he's so close it's almost painful, and then Patroclus is choking on his own voice as he spills between them, slicking their cocks up as he rides it out. Achilles buries his face in the crook of Patroclus' neck as calloused fingers wrap around him, barely aware of his teeth sinking into Patroclus' shoulder as he comes with a shudder. Patroclus is boneless beneath him, eyes shut and a lazy smile gracing his features as he winds his arms around Achilles' back. Achilles shifts a little sideways so that he isn't entirely crushing Patroclus, but is only half-draped over him as their breath steadies. \"I'll never tire of this,\" Achilles mumbles into Patroclus' chest, pressing a kiss to his collarbone. Patroclus' eyes open sluggishly, and his smile widens when he clocks the blissed out, complete look of contentment that Achilles is sporting. \"And I'll never tire of you,\" he replies easily, and Achilles knows that no lyre makes a sound more beautiful than Patroclus' voice like this. This is his Elysium: flushed cheeks and lips bitten to redness, like wine splashed over golden skin, blue eyes flecked with olive-green and earthy browns, and dark hair spread over trampled grass. The sun will go down and it will rise again tomorrow, bringing more and more of this heaven; but this is forever, and gone are the days where a new sun means time running out.",

    "text": "Does Lucan's Civil War have a place for heroism and the heroic? In epic, the concept of heroism and heroes has been passed down the tradition for centuries. It has been transformed from Greek heritage with Homer, which then becomes Roman heritage with Virgil, Ovid and eventually Lucan. The changes in the nature of heroism and heroic figures have been substantial. Homeric epic is based around an idea of a 'shame culture', in which heroes were men who did great deeds of valour, by killing other great heroes, the greater the better, in battle and duel, as is shown in the 'Iliad'. This meant that, if a hero did a great deed, then, according to the 'heroic code', the hero would win 'time' or respect from other heroes, and this was how heroes were judged; on results, rather than on lineage. By Roman times, however, heroic nature had changed with Virgil's 'Aeneid', and the figure of Aeneas as a more dutiful, or 'pius' figure, as he embodies all the values of a Roman, especially that of 'pietas', which is absent in many Homeric heroes. Also, there was less emphasis on the idea of a hero being judged because of deeds on the battlefield as, while this idea still existed, it was overshadowed by ideas of destiny and lineage. While Homer's heroes such as Achilles and Hector were judged on exploits in war, Virgil's chief hero, Aeneas, is judged on his descendants. This meant that a Roman hero would, theoretically, have a greater sense of duty towards his people and his country than a Homeric hero, although, by Lucan's time, there were signs that this idea was changing once again. By the time that Lucan was writing, a new concept of what constitutes a Roman hero had become popular in epic. This was the idea of heroes as symbols, an idea that had been referred to in Virgil's 'Aeneid', with Aeneas, who is known as 'the dutiful Aeneas'[1], as a symbol for piety. In Lucan's 'Civil War', the heroes are people who 'suggest in their different ways...the vast confusion and ineffable terror of the poem's materia'[2], as the protagonists are all presented in contrasting styles, leading to questions over what, according to Lucan, constitutes heroism, as these ideas are sometimes very different to what constitutes heroism, according to Virgil. The 'Civil War' has been cited as, having 'no hero, or too many'[3], which is reminiscent of the 'Iliad', especially with the idea that Lucan does not necessarily present his heroes in a good light, leading to the question of whether his interpretation of heroism is closer to Homeric or Roman heroism. In turn, there is also a question of whether the backdrop of the poem is in itself heroic. It is a war, but it is a civil war, where 'a mighty people [are] attacking its own guts with victorious sword-hand...kin facing kin'[4], so the Romans are essentially fighting themselves, until everything that has been built will collapse 'under too much weight, Rome's inability to bear herself'[5] which takes some of the glory out of the war. Similarly, the statement that 'every deity will yield to you, to your decision nature will leave which god you wish to be'[6] does the same, because it implies that the only reason this war is happening is because the gods agree to it happening and not because the men are brave. Lucan is condemning the idea of civil war by showing it in such a macabre light and also by showing characters in an unfavourable light. There is the question of why Lucan shows his characters in such an unflattering manner, aside from criticising civil war. At this point, one should remember that Lucan was one of a number of post-Augustan writers who 'tended to see their Rome and its history as terrifying and incomprehensible'[7], showing that, according to these writers, war is not the heroic environment that earlier epic writers had portrayed it as. One of the characters portrayed by Lucan in such an unflattering light is Caesar. Before exploring Lucan's take on him, however, it is interesting to view how he is presented by Virgil, when Anchises says at once, 'What carnage when the father-in-law swoops from...the Alps...and his son-in-law leads against him the embattled armies of the East'[8], and moments later, 'You who are sprung from Mount Olympus, you must be the first to show clemency'[9], showing, in the space of a few lines, Caesar's fighting expertise, and his ability to show mercy, or clementia. Lucan's Caesar is portrayed very differently as soon as he is introduced. The first thing mentioned is how Caesar 'had not only a general's name and reputation, but never-resting energy... [he] never shrank from defiling his sword'[10], leading to a viewpoint that he revels in bloodshed, for the sake of his reputation, which is a very Homeric concept that portrays him in a similar light to Achilles, who, stating his intention to fight Hector, says 'But now, may I win heroic glory!'[11]. Lucan has portrayed Caesar in similar fashion, as, like Achilles, he is confident of victory, which is somewhat unusual, as he 'considers himself Aeneas' successor'[12], and yet he displays characteristics unlike Aeneas and unlike those of a Roman hero. Later, Caesar is visited by ghosts of the Pompeians he has killed, seeing 'the ghost of a murdered citizen [standing] there...he sees faces of old men, he the forms of younger men...in this breast is his father - all these shades are Caesar'[13], however, he is not afraid, reinforcing the idea that he 'rejoices in mutilated corpses, loathe to have his masterpiece ruined by funerals'[14], giving an impression that this bloodlust and this slaughter that he participates in is his crowning moment, or his 'aristeia'. However, this is tainted, because civil war is less heroic than other wars as Caesar is effectively fighting people who should be allies, not enemies. There is now a question of who is Rome's true enemy, as they are all Romans, which also emphasises Lucan's condemnation of civil war. Within this, there is also an idea that 'the man who will be guilty is the man who made [Caesar] Rome's enemy'[15], which further defiles Caesar's 'aristeia', because, in participating in this war, he is as guilty of being Rome's enemy as his adversaries are. Interestingly, Caesar is the only character to invoke the gods, calling on the 'Phrygian house-gods of Iulus' clan'[16], showing his awareness of his status as a descendant of Aeneas. Ironically, when he does so, he asks them to 'favour his cause, which is, in effect, the subjugation of Rome to himself'[17], giving his 'heroic' deeds a revolting twist, because, even though he does not mention Aeneas' name, he is playing a part in destroying that which Aeneas helped to build the foundations for. Once again, there is the question of how heroic his actions are, because he is effectively destroying his own city. One of the problems Lucan faced in his presentation of Caesar is that of his clementia, or mercy, which is a distinctive Roman trait, but, in the epic, is almost entirely obliterated, except for an episode detailing events in Spain, where he 'makes no effort to maintain the picture of ferocity and impatience'[18] so far created in the impression of Caesar, although he tries to diminish his humanity. Caesar had also written an account in which he recalls his exploits in Spain. In his version of events, he had initiated the surrender of the Pompeians, promising to spare their lives, so that 'everyone recognised that Caesar was reaping the benefits of his original clemency'[19]. Lucan's version of how the surrender came about is rather different. He uses a desire for 'the sacred love of the world'[20] as the reason for it, and that Caesar was affected by this love, thereby omitting any mention of his clemency. This device not only diminishes his Roman attributes, but also serves to make him out to be less of a hero because of it, as Caesar has lost the opportunity to do something great in showing mercy. What is interesting about Lucan's portrayal of Caesar is that, after initially showing him as such a ferocious warrior, he then goes on to describe him as someone bringing peace as his troops 'abandon weapons to the victor and safe...with breast disarmed'[21], showing how, in such a time of war, 'only Caesar seems to be able to make men free'[22] and bring peace. Once again, the issue of clementia is raised, as the troops disarm themselves, thereby showing mercy that is unusually absent in their 'heroic' leader. There is a message from Lucan in this move of the troops forgoing their weapons, that civil war is unheroic, because everyone is fighting their own people and that, not only should it not occur, but it is an unfavourable way to remember a great warrior. As is traditional with epic, a principal hero always has a character whose characteristics oppose his own, and this is true with Caesar, whose balancing character is Cato. Cato is first mentioned in Book One, where Lucan reveals that 'each has on his side a great authority: the conquering cause the gods and the conquered Cato'[23], showing how Cato is matched against the gods as someone who the soldiers and commanders desire protection from. Despite this distinguished introduction, he is not properly introduced until Book Two, and then is 'to all intents and purposes abandoned by Lucan until Book Nine'[24]. The opening of Book Two is important to the presentation of Cato as it is made clear that 'the universe gave open signs of war'[25], showing that, not only Caesar and Pompey, but also the entire universe, is responsible for the civil war that Cato is about to become embroiled in. This becomes even more important when it is placed alongside Cato's own words to Brutus, who has come to him for help, when he tells him 'civil war is the greatest crime...to make guilty even me will be the god's reproach'[26]. Cato is aware of his guilty part in the war, but, unlike Caesar before him, he 'is not attempting to shrug off his guilt completely'[27], only saying that the reason he is guilty is because the gods have set the course for the events that will follow. When Brutus comes to see Cato, he reveals that, 'for Brutus, Cato will be the only leader'[28]. Such an appeal 'distinguishes Cato not only from the crowd, but from Brutus, setting him apart from even the most courageous men'[29], making Cato an emblematic figure. It also serves to enhance the Roman idea of heroism, as he is portrayed in a much more Virgilian light than Caesar had been portrayed. The comparison of Cato with Caesar comes to the fore in Book Nine, where Cato finds himself in Africa at the point of his 'aristeia', firstly when he 'resolved to head for Libyan Juba's kingdom bordering the Moors,'[30], but he fails to complete the crossing, because 'Nature blocked their journey by interposing the Syrtes'[31]. There is a similar incident in Book Five, when Caesar attempts to cross the Adriatic, 'and endures the perils of a great storm'[32] in his own failure to complete the crossing. Their reactions, however, are different, as, while the events of Caesar are drawn-out with his speech of accepting death by the sea as he believes he has done enough great deeds to win fame, Cato's failed crossing is much less exaggerated, as he 'voices no cry for a death beneath the billowing sands'[33] and, as he will soon encounter greater dangers, he is arguably more heroic than Caesar as he does not beg for death. He also appears more heroic as a leader, as he 'draws his men up to his own level'[34], thereby making him out to be a more than competent leader as he will only lead after consultation with his soldiers and troops, whereas Caesar will make his men fear him, as well as reducing them to subordinates and making them inferior especially as he tells them 'There is no need of prayers...how great will Caesar be? - in your hands it lies'[35]. The reason for this difference in treatment is because of the cause that the two leaders are fighting for; while Caesar fights to win glory for himself, in a manner that is very reminiscent of Homeric culture, Cato is fighting for the freedom of Rome, showing the piety that is associated with a Roman hero. The two characters also differ in their treatment of their troops when they disobey orders. While, on the one hand, Cato tells them that they are men who have 'decided on one source of safety - following [his] camp...prepare your minds for...the highest toils'[36], showing that he prioritises their freedom and the freedom of Rome and its citizens above all things, Caesar views the term 'citizen' as an insult, and thereby 'spurns his rebellious troops as unworthy of him, \"cowardly citizens\" who do not deserve to be called soldiers, much less his soldiers'[37], showing how he desires only glory, seemingly uncaring about how many enemies he makes of friends in order to gain this renown. It is therefore true to an extent that the concept of heroism and the heroic does have a place in Lucan's epic, although it is not necessarily always the heroism that is traditionally associated with a Roman hero, but instead there is a dominant showing of the more Homeric traits of heroism.

      "In Lucan's 'Civil War', the heroes are people who 'suggest in their different ways...the vast confusion and ineffable terror of the poem's materia'[2], as the protagonists are all presented in contrasting styles, leading to questions over what, according to Lucan, constitutes heroism, as these ideas are sometimes very different to what constitutes heroism, according to Virgil.",
      "The 'Civil War' has been cited as, having 'no hero, or too many'[3], which is reminiscent of the 'Iliad', especially with the idea that Lucan does not necessarily present his heroes in a good light, leading to the question of whether his interpretation of heroism is closer to Homeric or Roman heroism.",
      "In turn, there is also a question of whether the backdrop of the poem is in itself heroic.",
      "It is a war, but it is a civil war, where 'a mighty people [",
      "are] attacking its own guts with victorious sword-hand...kin facing kin'[4], so the Romans are essentially fighting themselves, until everything that has been built will collapse 'under too much weight, Rome's inability to bear herself'[5] which takes some of the glory out of the war.",
      "Similarly, the statement that 'every deity will yield to you, to your decision nature will leave which god you wish to be'[6] does the same, because it implies that the only reason this war is happening is because the gods agree to it happening and not because the men are brave.",
      "Lucan is condemning the idea of civil war by showing it in such a macabre light and also by showing characters in an unfavourable light.",
      "There is the question of why Lucan shows his characters in such an unflattering manner, aside from criticising civil war.",
      "At this point, one should remember that Lucan was one of a number of post-Augustan writers who 'tended to see their Rome and its history as terrifying and incomprehensible'[7], showing that, according to these writers, war is not the heroic environment that earlier epic writers had portrayed it as.",
      "One of the characters portrayed by Lucan in such an unflattering light is Caesar.",
      "Before exploring Lucan's take on him, however, it is interesting to view how he is presented by Virgil, when Anchises says at once, 'What carnage when the father-in-law swoops from...the Alps...and his son-in-law leads against him the embattled armies of the East'[8], and moments later, 'You who are sprung from Mount Olympus, you must be the first to show clemency'[9], showing, in the space of a few lines, Caesar's fighting expertise, and his ability to show mercy, or clementia.",
      "Lucan's Caesar is portrayed very differently as soon as he is introduced.",
      "The first thing mentioned is how Caesar 'had not only a general's name and reputation, but never-resting energy...",
      "[",
      "he] never shrank from defiling his sword'[10], leading to a viewpoint that he revels in bloodshed, for the sake of his reputation, which is a very Homeric concept that portrays him in a similar light to Achilles, who, stating his intention to fight Hector, says 'But now, may I win heroic glory!'[11].",
      "Lucan has portrayed Caesar in similar fashion, as, like Achilles, he is confident of victory, which is somewhat unusual, as he 'considers himself Aeneas' successor'[12], and yet he displays characteristics unlike Aeneas and unlike those of a Roman hero.",
      "Later, Caesar is visited by ghosts of the Pompeians he has killed, seeing 'the ghost of a murdered citizen [",
      "standing] there...he sees faces of old men, he the forms of younger men...in this breast is his father - all these shades are Caesar'[13], however, he is not afraid, reinforcing the idea that he 'rejoices in mutilated corpses, loathe to have his masterpiece ruined by funerals'[14], giving an impression that this bloodlust and this slaughter that he participates in is his crowning moment, or his 'aristeia'.",
      "However, this is tainted, because civil war is less heroic than other wars as Caesar is effectively fighting people who should be allies, not enemies.",
      "There is now a question of who is Rome's true enemy, as they are all Romans, which also emphasises Lucan's condemnation of civil war.",
      "Within this, there is also an idea that 'the man who will be guilty is the man who made [",
      "Caesar] Rome's enemy'[15], which further defiles Caesar's 'aristeia', because, in participating in this war, he is as guilty of being Rome's enemy as his adversaries are.",
      "Interestingly, Caesar is the only character to invoke the gods, calling on the 'Phrygian house-gods of Iulus' clan'[16], showing his awareness of his status as a descendant of Aeneas.",
      "Ironically, when he does so, he asks them to 'favour his cause, which is, in effect, the subjugation of Rome to himself'[17], giving his 'heroic' deeds a revolting twist, because, even though he does not mention Aeneas' name, he is playing a part in destroying that which Aeneas helped to build the foundations for.",
      "Once again, there is the question of how heroic his actions are, because he is effectively destroying his own city.",
      "One of the problems Lucan faced in his presentation of Caesar is that of his clementia, or mercy, which is a distinctive Roman trait, but, in the epic, is almost entirely obliterated, except for an episode detailing events in Spain, where he 'makes no effort to maintain the picture of ferocity and impatience'[18] so far created in the impression of Caesar, although he tries to diminish his humanity.",
      "Caesar had also written an account in which he recalls his exploits in Spain.",
      "In his version of events, he had initiated the surrender of the Pompeians, promising to spare their lives, so that 'everyone recognised that Caesar was reaping the benefits of his original clemency'[19].",
      "Lucan's version of how the surrender came about is rather different.",
      "He uses a desire for 'the sacred love of the world'[20] as the reason for it, and that Caesar was affected by this love, thereby omitting any mention of his clemency.",
      "This device not only diminishes his Roman attributes, but also serves to make him out to be less of a hero because of it, as Caesar has lost the opportunity to do something great in showing mercy.",
      "What is interesting about Lucan's portrayal of Caesar is that, after initially showing him as such a ferocious warrior, he then goes on to describe him as someone bringing peace as his troops 'abandon weapons to the victor and safe...with breast disarmed'[21], showing how, in such a time of war, 'only Caesar seems to be able to make men free'[22] and bring peace.",
      "Once again, the issue of clementia is raised, as the troops disarm themselves, thereby showing mercy that is unusually absent in their 'heroic' leader.",
      "There is a message from Lucan in this move of the troops forgoing their weapons, that civil war is unheroic, because everyone is fighting their own people and that, not only should it not occur, but it is an unfavourable way to remember a great warrior.",
      "As is traditional with epic, a principal hero always has a character whose characteristics oppose his own, and this is true with Caesar, whose balancing character is Cato.",
      "Cato is first mentioned in Book One, where Lucan reveals that 'each has on his side a great authority: the conquering cause the gods and the conquered Cato'[23], showing how Cato is matched against the gods as someone who the soldiers and commanders desire protection from.",
      "Despite this distinguished introduction, he is not properly introduced until Book Two, and then is 'to all intents and purposes abandoned by Lucan until Book Nine'[24].",
      "The opening of Book Two is important to the presentation of Cato as it is made clear that 'the universe gave open signs of war'[25], showing that, not only Caesar and Pompey, but also the entire universe, is responsible for the civil war that Cato is about to become embroiled in.",
      "This becomes even more important when it is placed alongside Cato's own words to Brutus, who has come to him for help, when he tells him 'civil war is the greatest crime...to make guilty even me will be the god's reproach'[26].",
      "Cato is aware of his guilty part in the war, but, unlike Caesar before him, he 'is not attempting to shrug off his guilt completely'[27], only saying that the reason he is guilty is because the gods have set the course for the events that will follow.",
      "When Brutus comes to see Cato, he reveals that, 'for Brutus, Cato will be the only leader'[28].",
      "Such an appeal 'distinguishes Cato not only from the crowd, but from Brutus, setting him apart from even the most courageous men'[29], making Cato an emblematic figure.",
      "It also serves to enhance the Roman idea of heroism, as he is portrayed in a much more Virgilian light than Caesar had been portrayed.",
      "The comparison of Cato with Caesar comes to the fore in Book Nine, where Cato finds himself in Africa at the point of his 'aristeia', firstly when he 'resolved to head for Libyan Juba's kingdom bordering the Moors,'[30], but he fails to complete the crossing, because 'Nature blocked their journey by interposing the Syrtes'[31].",
      "There is a similar incident in Book Five, when Caesar attempts to cross the Adriatic, 'and endures the perils of a great storm'[32] in his own failure to complete the crossing.",
      "Their reactions, however, are different, as, while the events of Caesar are drawn-out with his speech of accepting death by the sea as he believes he has done enough great deeds to win fame, Cato's failed crossing is much less exaggerated, as he 'voices no cry for a death beneath the billowing sands'[33] and, as he will soon encounter greater dangers, he is arguably more heroic than Caesar as he does not beg for death.",
      "He also appears more heroic as a leader, as he 'draws his men up to his own level'[34], thereby making him out to be a more than competent leader as he will only lead after consultation with his soldiers and troops, whereas Caesar will make his men fear him, as well as reducing them to subordinates and making them inferior especially as he tells them 'There is no need of prayers...how great will Caesar be?",
      "- in your hands it lies'[35].",
      "The reason for this difference in treatment is because of the cause that the two leaders are fighting for; while Caesar fights to win glory for himself, in a manner that is very reminiscent of Homeric culture, Cato is fighting for the freedom of Rome, showing the piety that is associated with a Roman hero.",
      "The two characters also differ in their treatment of their troops when they disobey orders.",
      "While, on the one hand, Cato tells them that they are men who have 'decided on one source of safety - following [",
      "his] camp...prepare your minds for...the highest toils'[36], showing that he prioritises their freedom and the freedom of Rome and its citizens above all things, Caesar views the term 'citizen' as an insult, and thereby 'spurns his rebellious troops as unworthy of him, \"cowardly citizens\" who do not deserve to be called soldiers, much less his soldiers'[37], showing how he desires only glory, seemingly uncaring about how many enemies he makes of friends in order to gain this renown.",
      "It is therefore true to an extent that the concept of heroism and the heroic does have a place in Lucan's epic, although it is not necessarily always the heroism that is traditionally associated with a Roman hero, but instead there is a dominant showing of the more Homeric traits of heroism.",

    "text": "Discuss the figure of fatherhood in two plays. Critical Analysis Creon: So, men our age, we're to be lectured, are we? - schooled by a boy his age? Haemon: Only in what is right. But if I seem young, look less in my years and more to what I do. Creon: Do? Is admiring rebels an achievement? Haemon: I'd never suggest that you admire treason. Creon: Oh? - isn't that just the sickness that's attacked her? Haemon: The whole city of Thebes denies it, to a man. Creon: And is Thebes about to tell me how to rule? Haemon: Now, you see? Who's talking like a child? Creon: Am I to rule this land for others - or myself? Haemon: It's no city at all, owned by one man alone. Creon: What? The city is the king's - that's the law! Haemon: What a splendid king you'd make of a desert island - you and you alone. Creon: This boy, I do believe, is fighting on her side, the woman's side. Haemon: If you are a woman, yes - my concern is all for you. Creon: Why, you degenerate - bandying accusations, threatening me with justice, your own father! Haemon: I see my father offending justice - wrong. Creon: Wrong? To protect my royal rights? Haemon: Protect your rights? When you trample down the honour of the gods? Creon: You, you soul of corruption, rotten through - woman's accomplice! Haemon: That may be, but you will never find me accomplice to a criminal. Creon: That's what she is, and every word you say is a blatant appeal for her - Haemon: And you, and me, and the gods beneath the earth. Creon: You will never marry her, not while she's alive. Haemon: Then she will die...but her death will kill another. Creon: What, brazen threats? You go too far! Haemon: What threat? Combating your empty, mindless judgments with a word? Creon: You'll suffer for your sermons, you and your empty wisdom! Haemon: If you weren't my father, I'd say you were insane. Creon: Don't flatter me with Father - you woman's slave! Haemon: You really expect to fling abuse at me and not receive the same? Creon: Is that so! Now, by heaven, I promise you, you'll pay - taunting, insulting me! Bring her out, that hateful - she'll die now, here, in front of his eyes, beside her groom! Haemon: No, no, she will never die beside me - don't delude yourself. And you will never see me, never set eyes on my face again. Rage your heart out, rage with friends who can stand the sight of you. (Sophocles: Antigone, lines 813-859) This episode in Sophocles' 'Antigone', between Creon, King of Thebes, and his last surviving son, Haemon, gives a strong indication of one of the great causes of tragedy in the ancient world. This is the idea of a lack of understanding between a father and a son, because of clashes in opinion or thought, and through a stubbornness of nature, which is what not only brings about this lack of relationship and understanding, but also a large proportion of the tragedy that springs from it. In this case, the tragedy set in motion is a double tragedy, that of Haemon, who will die an unhappy death, hating his father and, ultimately, that of Creon, who will lose everything and everyone he has cared about. On the surface, this passage is about a conflict of ideas about Antigone, who Creon believes is a traitor to the State as he describes the treason that is the act of her burying her brother as 'the sickness that's attacked her'[1], but who Haemon believes has acted nobly and rightly. However, reading underneath the words allows the reader and the audience to explore the deeper theme of how costly a lack of understanding between father and son can be, which is also a theme illustrated similarly in Euripides' 'Hippolytus', with the idea of the relationship between Theseus and Hippolytus, which is shown by the fact that Theseus unquestioningly believes Phaedra's accusation against Hippolytus, showing that he has never been entirely trusting of his son, and only realises his mistake at the end of the play when it is too late. This is not to say that Creon is distrustful towards Haemon in the same way that Theseus is towards Hippolytus, but instead that he is so consumed by the desire to appear as a good king that he finds himself putting the affairs of the State above everything else, including his family, which is why he 'fails both as a father and a civic leader'.[2] Creon is an unusual figure in Greek tragedy, because he appears to simply be the 'typical tragic hero who collaborates in his own downfall'[3], however it is clear that his character is not as simple as this. He is a man under an immense amount of pressure because he wants to be a good king and he knows that everything he does on his first day in office will dictate what the people think of him and it is this which makes him ignore other viewpoints and brings about the clash with his son in something familiar in Greek tragedy, as 'two strong wills inevitably clash - the son eager and impassioned, the father hardened by duty'[4] as is shown by his words to Haemon 'the city is the king's - that's the law!'[5], a view sharply contrasted by Haemon, who is very much on Antigone's side, as he fights for justice and for what he believes is right, despite the fact that he 'declares that no marriage means more to him than his father'[6], earlier in the play, with the words 'No marriage could ever mean more to me than you'[7]. This is not to suggest that Haemon is a hypocritical figure, but instead it shows Creon's inability to accept what he believes is an action against his own rules, or his own inflexibility. It can be argued that Haemon is equally as inflexible as Creon in this passage, because he too refuses to back down on his beliefs that Antigone has done nothing wrong, and it is this which destroys any possibility of a father and son relationship between them. While it is true to say that Haemon is clearly on Antigone's side, he does not always make this entirely obvious at the start, as he does not simply argue her case insultingly to Creon, but instead he tries to use rational and tactful rhetoric to make him be flexible rather than firing personal insults on his father's judgement, even if he believes it to be wrong. This shows an element of flexibility on Haemon's part which is missing in his father, as he is capable of calm negotiation when he knows that hot-headed impetuosity will achieve nothing, but it also goes a long way to illustrating the emotional conflict with his father, as Creon is unable to see the situation from his son's perspective. With his words 'Why, you degenerate - bandying accusations, threatening me with justice, your own father!'[8], Creon is showing that he feels Haemon is not only being disloyal to him as a king, but also as a son, once again showing the inflexibility which makes a functional relationship with Haemon almost impossible, and which ultimately brings about the tragedy of the play. This having been said, Haemon has faults too, which are exploited in his later words to Creon, as he tells him 'Then [Antigone] will die...but her death will kill another'[9] and, even more powerfully, with his last words to him 'And you will never see me, never set eyes on my face...Rage your heart out, rage with friends who can stand the sight of you'[10], which shows that, for all his earlier tact and rational speech earlier on in the scene, Haemon can be impulsive and insulting as he rages at Creon before leaving, his final words to his father later ringing true. What is really interesting about the characters of Creon and Haemon in this passage, apart from the evidence that a functional relationship as father and son is impossible between them, is that, despite the fact that Creon has the authority over Thebes as king, it is actually Haemon who comes off better and has a greater sense of authority here, as he has the ability to be rational in the face of adversity which Creon appears to lack, meaning that Haemon comes across in a more mature light, giving an idea that, if he were a ruler and a father, he would be able to balance the two roles much better than Creon himself does. ~*~ A figure of fatherhood is a crucial element in Greek drama, but especially in tragedy, as he can be used to illustrate the principles of tragedy according to Aristotle, which are that tragedy is 'an imitation of an action that is admirable, complete and possesses magnitude'[11] in some cases by contradicting them. I will be focusing on will be Euripides' 'Hippolytus', where I will be exploring the character of Theseus as a father figure towards Hippolytus, and Aeschylus' 'Agamemnon', where I will be exploring the characters of Agamemnon and of Thyestes, the father of Aegisthus, to show how a father figure can also have a strong influence by being absent and also to show the conflict between fatherhood and kingship, which is especially shown by Agamemnon. The major father figure in 'Hippolytus' is the character of Theseus, whose son is Hippolytus. The audience first learns this from Aphrodite's speech, as she describes Hippolytus with these words: 'Hippolytus, son of Theseus by the Amazon, pupil of holy Pittheus'[12] Throughout the play, Euripides makes it very clear that Theseus is the dominant figure of fatherhood. It is, however, Theseus' attitude towards fatherhood and towards Hippolytus, as well as his relationship with his son, which goes a long way towards the tragedy at the end of the play. Hippolytus is an interesting figure in the play for several reasons, one of which is the contrast between himself and Theseus. Hippolytus is very much an 'ephebic' figure, or a young man who has not quite reached adulthood. It is clear that he passes his time with appropriate pursuits for such young men. The first time he appears in the play, he has just been hunting and he has also made a garland for the statue of Artemis, a goddess of hunting. This is extremely important because, like many of Hippolytus' traits, it shows how he is 'detached from human relations and unchanging'[13], not only in that he is showing no signs of moving out of the hunting phase into any other phase - in other words showing his unwillingness to mature - but also in showing one of his other major character traits. Hippolytus is chaste, in the same way that the goddess Artemis was chaste, and he intends to prolong his chastity, because he shuns marriage. Hippolytus' chastity is one of the factors which brings about his tragedy, because he is punished by Aphrodite, 'not simply because his way of life has no place for sex, but because he rejects it and rejects the worship of the goddess'[14]. It also shows a huge contrast with the figure of his father, Theseus, who 'was known for a polygamous love life'[15], even though, after Phaedra's death, he honours her memory when he says: 'There is no woman in the world who shall come to this house and sleep by my side.'[16] It can be argued that this idea of Theseus renouncing his desire for women is a device used by Euripides to make him appear to have more in common with his chaste son Hippolytus. However, I believe that this is not the case, since, as the play progresses, it becomes increasingly clear that Theseus and Hippolytus have few or no common features and Euripides is using this device to show that, despite Theseus renouncing his polygamy in the face of his wife's death does nothing to give him similarity with Hippolytus, who refuses marriage and sex completely. Another facet to Theseus' character which shows him to be completely at odds with Hippolytus is his attitude towards the 'polis', or the city. It has been argued that Theseus and Hippolytus are so at odds here because they both take their roles to the extreme. The audience can see, in the 'agon'[17] speeches after Theseus finds Phaedra's note after her death, how 'Hippolytus is practically an anti-Theseus and between them lies the world of the polis [as] Theseus exceeds the status of a citizen [whereas] Hippolytus never quite attains it'[18], as Hippolytus actually says that he is: '...no man to speak with vapid, precious skill before a mob, although among my equals and in a narrow circle I am held not unaccomplished in the eloquent art.'[19] In admitting that he does not make speeches, Hippolytus once again shows himself as an outsider who does not take part in democracy. He also presents a strong contrast to his father, as Theseus is a public figure in the polis, as he speaks as if he is speaking to a public assembly, especially with the words: 'Look at this man! He was my son and he dishonours my wife's bed! By the dead's testimony he's clearly proved the vilest, foulest wretch... show me your face; show it to me, your father.'[20] Theseus' story in the 'Hippolytus' is a tragedy within a tragedy, as it shows the fall of a great figure in just one day. However, the tragedy stems from 'Theseus being what Theseus was and a relationship (or rather a complete lack of relationship) between Theseus and Hippolytus'[21], which is because the two characters are so different. There are differences of opinion amongst critics about why Theseus immediately believes Phaedra. Some critics have argued that 'by having Theseus instantly believe Phaedra, Euripides suggests that he has never entirely trusted his odd son'[22], whereas others argue that 'Hippolytus [is] a man belonging to a world apart'[23] from the 'polis' and from what constitutes the average Greek male, which is what Theseus represents, whereas Theseus is the opposite to his son and so has never understood him. Personally, I am inclined to believe that the tragedy of Theseus, and also the tragedy of Hippolytus, stems from both these factors. It is Theseus' inability to understand his son which leads to an inability to trust him the way a father should be expected to trust his son and this is what leads to their downfall. The lack of relationship between the two is emphasised by Theseus' description of his confrontation with Sinis, a bandit he claims to have killed, and the idea of the rocks being ravaged by the sea[24], which 'suggests the whole realm of cruelty and bitter experience... [is] in contrast to the innocence of [Theseus'] woods-and mountain-loving son'[25], which again emphasises their contrasting backgrounds and the lack of a relationship between them. The final scene of the play, when Hippolytus returns, bruised and battered, is an exceptionally poignant scene, as it shows the relationship between the father and the son as it should be. There are two strong Aristotelian concepts in this final scene between the two. The first is the idea of 'recognition', which comes when Theseus realises his 'hamartia' in cursing Hippolytus with the curse of Poseidon and also shows the tragedy of how 'the prayers that become reality are the deadly ones'[26], although he realises his mistake when it is too late, which can also be seen as a sign that he is also realising the true role a father should have towards his son when it is too late. The second is the concept of a 'peripeteia', or a reversal, which means that when something happens that should have one effect, it has the opposite effect. In this case, Theseus was supposed to feel justice that his curse had worked, when in fact, when he realises the extremity of what has happened, he feels guilt and pain. For his part, Hippolytus is able to absolve Theseus of blame before his death, as he tells his father: 'No, for I free you from all guilt in this.'[27] Like Theseus, Hippolytus has also had a recognition, as he 'rediscovers Theseus as a father'[28], in the same way that Theseus can now recognise Hippolytus as his son. Their character difference which made their relationship so disastrous will still be there, but they have now finally learned to accept the other for who he is, even though it is too late. One of the most intruiging aspects of the opening play of Aeschylus' 'Oresteia' trilogy is the aspect concerning a figure of fatherhood. This is because, even without such a figure performing an active role in the play, the theme of fatherhood is extremely important and it comes across in several moments of the play in different ways. What is most interesting about this is the idea that a father figure is someone so powerful and influential that he does not have to be onstage constantly to draw the attention of the audience and, in some ways, dominate the action of the play. Indeed, the only male figure who could be regarded as being close to a father figure who is actually physically seen in the play is Agamemnon, yet even he does not appear until late into the action, yet he manages to dominate much of the action on the stage. In the 'Agamemnon', one of the greatest conflicts for a father who, like Agamemnon, is also a king and a warrior comes to the forefront of the play. This conflict is a conflict where the two different roles are set against each other and the character has different loyalties to the 'polis'[29] and to the 'oikos'[30] and is shown most poignantly by the choice that Agamemnon has to make before the Greek fleet can set sail for Troy where he must sacrifice his daughter Iphigenia to placate the goddess Artemis so that the troops can set sail for Troy. The Chorus, when discussing this, initially show Agamemnon's unwillingness to commit such an act with these words: '[Agamemnon's] fate is angry if I disobey these, but angry if I slaughter this child, the beauty of my house, with maiden blood shed staining these father's hands beside the altar. What of these things goes now without disaster?'[31] Agamemnon's instinct as a father with love for his daughter is being clearly illustrated by the Chorus as they tell that he does not want to sacrifice his daughter, but that he also feels that he has to set sail for Troy to preserve his reputation, effectively putting him in a situation where he cannot win, because he has great love for his daughter, but he knows that if he does not sacrifice her, he will not be able to sail for Troy, and he will also be committing the sin of 'hubris'[32] if he goes against the will of Artemis. It is ironic, therefore, that, when he returns from Troy, he commits a similar hubris when he walks on the tapestries laid out for him by Clytemnestra. This, arguably, negates many of his fatherly instincts, because the hubris he sought not to commit when he sacrificed Iphigenia has been committed anyway. Agamemnon's fatherly feelings are, however, set aside and he does sacrifice his daughter, in a way that the Chorus call 'reckless in fresh cruelty'[33], which shows him not as a figure of fatherhood, but instead as a king and a warrior who is doing all that must be done in order to go to war: '[Iphigenia's] supplications and her cries of father were nothing, nor the child's lamentation to kings passioned for battle.'[34] Through the Chorus' words, the audience and the reader now see how Agamemnon's paternal instincts have been repressed by his own and the other king's passion for war. This shows him no longer as a figure of fatherhood, but instead as a kingly figure who partakes in battles and wars and again shows how the role of fatherhood and of a king come into conflict with each other. Some critics have argued that Agamemnon's situation was such that he could not be to blame for his actions. In 'Problem and Spectacle - Studies in the 'Oresteia', William Whallon states a theory that 'Agamemnon is compliant, hesitant, vacillating before the altar'[35] and that he and Iphigenia were mere pawns in the game of destiny, thus absolving Agamemnon of blame for his actions, as if he went against the will of the gods, he would be guilty of hubris. However, other critics have argued to the contrary, arguing that 'there is no intimation that Agamemnon was compelled by any god or spell to choose as he did'[36], a concept stated by N.G.L. Hammond, and quoted by Whallon, which implies that Agamemnon acted of his own free will. My opinion is that Agamemnon did not want to murder his daughter, but he also did not want to commit hubris, thereby angering the gods, so he put his paternal instincts aside and took on the mantle of a king and a warrior. In some ways, the rejection of his paternal feelings is his 'hamartia'[37], which brings about his downfall. Another aspect of fatherhood that comes across in this play is the idea of a father as someone who should be avenged if they are killed unlawfully or if they were wronged when alive. Aeschylus brings this aspect across through the character of Aegisthus, the cousin of Agamemnon. Like Agamemnon, Aegisthus does not make his appearance until the late action of the play, but when he does appear, he immediately gives off an aura of a son wanting vengeance for his now dead father. This idea is especially shown with his words: 'For Atreus [Agamemnon's] father, King of Argolis - I tell you the clear story - drove my father forth, Thyestes, his own brother, who had challenged him in his king's right - forth from his city and home.'[38] From the start, even when telling the legend of how his father was driven out of his home, Aegisthus already comes across as a son wanting to avenge the wrong done his father. Once again, a figure of fatherhood is very dominant and influential because of his absence and the effect it has on the characters and their actions. Now that Agamemnon is dead, Aegisthus believes that justice has been done and that he can: '.....die in honour again, if die I must, having seen him caught in the cords of his just punishment.'[39] Once again, Aegisthus is presented as the son wanting revenge on his father and he uses another figure of fatherhood, Agamemnon, to exact his revenge. This gives an idea of justice and of one figure of fatherhood dying for another. The interesting thing about this is that it is not Aegisthus who commits the murder, but instead it is Clytemnestra, meaning that 'the agent of punishment is an adulterous wife, but one whose daughter has been cruelly sacrificed'[40], which adds to the idea of justice, and also presents Clytemnestra as an arguable figure of fatherhood, as she comes across in a very masculine and strong manner, which one could associate with a father figure. Therefore, the father figure is an interesting element in Greek drama as he shows, even in absence, what a powerful effect he can have on the action, as is shown in the 'Agamemnon' as well as relationships, or lack thereof, with his child, and how the absence of such a relationship can lead to a tragic outcome, as is shown by the character of Theseus in the 'Hippolytus'.

      "Rage your heart out, rage with friends who can stand the sight of you.",
      "(Sophocles: Antigone, lines 813-859)",
      "This episode in Sophocles' 'Antigone', between Creon, King of Thebes, and his last surviving son, Haemon, gives a strong indication of one of the great causes of tragedy in the ancient world.",
      "This is the idea of a lack of understanding between a father and a son, because of clashes in opinion or thought, and through a stubbornness of nature, which is what not only brings about this lack of relationship and understanding, but also a large proportion of the tragedy that springs from it.",
      "In this case, the tragedy set in motion is a double tragedy, that of Haemon, who will die an unhappy death, hating his father and, ultimately, that of Creon, who will lose everything and everyone he has cared about.",
      "On the surface, this passage is about a conflict of ideas about Antigone, who Creon believes is a traitor to the State as he describes the treason that is the act of her burying her brother as 'the sickness that's attacked her'[1], but who Haemon believes has acted nobly and rightly.",
      "However, reading underneath the words allows the reader and the audience to explore the deeper theme of how costly a lack of understanding between father and son can be, which is also a theme illustrated similarly in Euripides' 'Hippolytus', with the idea of the relationship between Theseus and Hippolytus, which is shown by the fact that Theseus unquestioningly believes Phaedra's accusation against Hippolytus, showing that he has never been entirely trusting of his son, and only realises his mistake at the end of the play when it is too late.",
      "This is not to say that Creon is distrustful towards Haemon in the same way that Theseus is towards Hippolytus, but instead that he is so consumed by the desire to appear as a good king that he finds himself putting the affairs of the State above everything else, including his family, which is why he 'fails both as a father and a civic leader'.[2] Creon is an unusual figure in Greek tragedy, because he appears to simply be the 'typical tragic hero who collaborates in his own downfall'[3], however it is clear that his character is not as simple as this.",
      "He is a man under an immense amount of pressure because he wants to be a good king and he knows that everything he does on his first day in office will dictate what the people think of him and it is this which makes him ignore other viewpoints and brings about the clash with his son in something familiar in Greek tragedy, as 'two strong wills inevitably clash - the son eager and impassioned, the father hardened by duty'[4] as is shown by his words to Haemon 'the city is the king's - that's the law!'[5], a view sharply contrasted by Haemon, who is very much on Antigone's side, as he fights for justice and for what he believes is right, despite the fact that he 'declares that no marriage means more to him than his father'[6], earlier in the play, with the words 'No marriage could ever mean more to me than you'[7].",
      "This is not to suggest that Haemon is a hypocritical figure, but instead it shows Creon's inability to accept what he believes is an action against his own rules, or his own inflexibility.",
      "It can be argued that Haemon is equally as inflexible as Creon in this passage, because he too refuses to back down on his beliefs that Antigone has done nothing wrong, and it is this which destroys any possibility of a father and son relationship between them.",
      "While it is true to say that Haemon is clearly on Antigone's side, he does not always make this entirely obvious at the start, as he does not simply argue her case insultingly to Creon, but instead he tries to use rational and tactful rhetoric to make him be flexible rather than firing personal insults on his father's judgement, even if he believes it to be wrong.",
      "This shows an element of flexibility on Haemon's part which is missing in his father, as he is capable of calm negotiation when he knows that hot-headed impetuosity will achieve nothing, but it also goes a long way to illustrating the emotional conflict with his father, as Creon is unable to see the situation from his son's perspective.",
      "With his words 'Why, you degenerate - bandying accusations, threatening me with justice, your own father!'[8], Creon is showing that he feels Haemon is not only being disloyal to him as a king, but also as a son, once again showing the inflexibility which makes a functional relationship with Haemon almost impossible, and which ultimately brings about the tragedy of the play.",
      "This having been said, Haemon has faults too, which are exploited in his later words to Creon, as he tells him 'Then [",
      "Antigone] will die...but her death will kill another'[9] and, even more powerfully, with his last words to him 'And you will never see me, never set eyes on my face...Rage your heart out, rage with friends who can stand the sight of you'[10], which shows that, for all his earlier tact and rational speech earlier on in the scene, Haemon can be impulsive and insulting as he rages at Creon before leaving, his final words to his father later ringing true.",
      "What is really interesting about the characters of Creon and Haemon in this passage, apart from the evidence that a functional relationship as father and son is impossible between them, is that, despite the fact that Creon has the authority over Thebes as king, it is actually Haemon who comes off better and has a greater sense of authority here, as he has the ability to be rational in the face of adversity which Creon appears to lack, meaning that Haemon comes across in a more mature light, giving an idea that, if he were a ruler and a father, he would be able to balance the two roles much better than Creon himself does.",
      "~*~ A figure of fatherhood is a crucial element in Greek drama, but especially in tragedy, as he can be used to illustrate the principles of tragedy according to Aristotle, which are that tragedy is 'an imitation of an action that is admirable, complete and possesses magnitude'[11] in some cases by contradicting them.",
      "I will be focusing on will be Euripides' 'Hippolytus', where I will be exploring the character of Theseus as a father figure towards Hippolytus, and Aeschylus' 'Agamemnon', where I will be exploring the characters of Agamemnon and of Thyestes, the father of Aegisthus, to show how a father figure can also have a strong influence by being absent and also to show the conflict between fatherhood and kingship, which is especially shown by Agamemnon.",
      "The major father figure in 'Hippolytus' is the character of Theseus, whose son is Hippolytus.",
      "The audience first learns this from Aphrodite's speech, as she describes Hippolytus with these words: 'Hippolytus, son of Theseus by the Amazon, pupil of holy Pittheus'[12] Throughout the play, Euripides makes it very clear that Theseus is the dominant figure of fatherhood.",
      "It is, however, Theseus' attitude towards fatherhood and towards Hippolytus, as well as his relationship with his son, which goes a long way towards the tragedy at the end of the play.",
      "Hippolytus is an interesting figure in the play for several reasons, one of which is the contrast between himself and Theseus.",
      "Hippolytus is very much an 'ephebic' figure, or a young man who has not quite reached adulthood.",
      "It is clear that he passes his time with appropriate pursuits for such young men.",
      "The first time he appears in the play, he has just been hunting and he has also made a garland for the statue of Artemis, a goddess of hunting.",
      "This is extremely important because, like many of Hippolytus' traits, it shows how he is 'detached from human relations and unchanging'[13], not only in that he is showing no signs of moving out of the hunting phase into any other phase - in other words showing his unwillingness to mature - but also in showing one of his other major character traits.",
      "Hippolytus is chaste, in the same way that the goddess Artemis was chaste, and he intends to prolong his chastity, because he shuns marriage.",
      "Hippolytus' chastity is one of the factors which brings about his tragedy, because he is punished by Aphrodite, 'not simply because his way of life has no place for sex, but because he rejects it and rejects the worship of the goddess'[14].",
      "It also shows a huge contrast with the figure of his father, Theseus, who 'was known for a polygamous love life'[15], even though, after Phaedra's death, he honours her memory when he says: 'There is no woman in the world who shall come to this house and sleep by my side.'[16",
      "] It can be argued that this idea of Theseus renouncing his desire for women is a device used by Euripides to make him appear to have more in common with his chaste son Hippolytus.",
      "However, I believe that this is not the case, since, as the play progresses, it becomes increasingly clear that Theseus and Hippolytus have few or no common features and Euripides is using this device to show that, despite Theseus renouncing his polygamy in the face of his wife's death does nothing to give him similarity with Hippolytus, who refuses marriage and sex completely.",
      "Another facet to Theseus' character which shows him to be completely at odds with Hippolytus is his attitude towards the 'polis', or the city.",
      "It has been argued that Theseus and Hippolytus are so at odds here because they both take their roles to the extreme.",
      "The audience can see, in the 'agon'[17] speeches after Theseus finds Phaedra's note after her death, how 'Hippolytus is practically an anti-Theseus and between them lies the world of the polis [",
      "as] Theseus exceeds the status of a citizen [",
      "whereas] Hippolytus never quite attains it'[18], as Hippolytus actually says that he is: '...no man to speak with vapid, precious skill before a mob, although among my equals and in a narrow circle I am held not unaccomplished in the eloquent art.'[19",
      "] In admitting that he does not make speeches, Hippolytus once again shows himself as an outsider who does not take part in democracy.",
      "He also presents a strong contrast to his father, as Theseus is a public figure in the polis, as he speaks as if he is speaking to a public assembly, especially with the words: 'Look at this man!",
      "He was my son and he dishonours my wife's bed!",
      "By the dead's testimony he's clearly proved the vilest, foulest wretch... show me your face; show it to me, your father.'[20",
      "] Theseus' story in the 'Hippolytus' is a tragedy within a tragedy, as it shows the fall of a great figure in just one day.",
      "However, the tragedy stems from 'Theseus being what Theseus was and a relationship (or rather a complete lack of relationship) between Theseus and Hippolytus'[21], which is because the two characters are so different.",
      "There are differences of opinion amongst critics about why Theseus immediately believes Phaedra.",
      "Some critics have argued that 'by having Theseus instantly believe Phaedra, Euripides suggests that he has never entirely trusted his odd son'[22], whereas others argue that 'Hippolytus [",
      "is] a man belonging to a world apart'[23] from the 'polis' and from what constitutes the average Greek male, which is what Theseus represents, whereas Theseus is the opposite to his son and so has never understood him.",
      "Personally, I am inclined to believe that the tragedy of Theseus, and also the tragedy of Hippolytus, stems from both these factors.",
      "It is Theseus' inability to understand his son which leads to an inability to trust him the way a father should be expected to trust his son and this is what leads to their downfall.",
      "The lack of relationship between the two is emphasised by Theseus' description of his confrontation with Sinis, a bandit he claims to have killed, and the idea of the rocks being ravaged by the sea[24], which 'suggests the whole realm of cruelty and bitter experience...",
      "[",
      "is] in contrast to the innocence of [",
      "Theseus'] woods-and mountain-loving son'[25], which again emphasises their contrasting backgrounds and the lack of a relationship between them.",
      "The final scene of the play, when Hippolytus returns, bruised and battered, is an exceptionally poignant scene, as it shows the relationship between the father and the son as it should be.",
      "There are two strong Aristotelian concepts in this final scene between the two.",
      "The first is the idea of 'recognition', which comes when Theseus realises his 'hamartia' in cursing Hippolytus with the curse of Poseidon and also shows the tragedy of how 'the prayers that become reality are the deadly ones'[26], although he realises his mistake when it is too late, which can also be seen as a sign that he is also realising the true role a father should have towards his son when it is too late.",
      "The second is the concept of a 'peripeteia', or a reversal, which means that when something happens that should have one effect, it has the opposite effect.",
      "In this case, Theseus was supposed to feel justice that his curse had worked, when in fact, when he realises the extremity of what has happened, he feels guilt and pain.",
      "For his part, Hippolytus is able to absolve Theseus of blame before his death, as he tells his father: 'No, for I free you from all guilt in this.'[27",
      "] Like Theseus, Hippolytus has also had a recognition, as he 'rediscovers Theseus as a father'[28], in the same way that Theseus can now recognise Hippolytus as his son.",
      "Their character difference which made their relationship so disastrous will still be there, but they have now finally learned to accept the other for who he is, even though it is too late.",
      "One of the most intruiging aspects of the opening play of Aeschylus' 'Oresteia' trilogy is the aspect concerning a figure of fatherhood.",
      "This is because, even without such a figure performing an active role in the play, the theme of fatherhood is extremely important and it comes across in several moments of the play in different ways.",
      "What is most interesting about this is the idea that a father figure is someone so powerful and influential that he does not have to be onstage constantly to draw the attention of the audience and, in some ways, dominate the action of the play.",
      "Indeed, the only male figure who could be regarded as being close to a father figure who is actually physically seen in the play is Agamemnon, yet even he does not appear until late into the action, yet he manages to dominate much of the action on the stage.",
      "In the 'Agamemnon', one of the greatest conflicts for a father who, like Agamemnon, is also a king and a warrior comes to the forefront of the play.",
      "This conflict is a conflict where the two different roles are set against each other and the character has different loyalties to the 'polis'[29] and to the 'oikos'[30] and is shown most poignantly by the choice that Agamemnon has to make before the Greek fleet can set sail for Troy where he must sacrifice his daughter Iphigenia to placate the goddess Artemis so that the troops can set sail for Troy.",
      "The Chorus, when discussing this, initially show Agamemnon's unwillingness to commit such an act with these words: '[",
      "Agamemnon's] fate is angry if I disobey these, but angry if I slaughter this child, the beauty of my house, with maiden blood shed staining these father's hands beside the altar.",
      "What of these things goes now without disaster?'[31] Agamemnon's instinct as a father with love for his daughter is being clearly illustrated by the Chorus as they tell that he does not want to sacrifice his daughter, but that he also feels that he has to set sail for Troy to preserve his reputation, effectively putting him in a situation where he cannot win, because he has great love for his daughter, but he knows that if he does not sacrifice her, he will not be able to sail for Troy, and he will also be committing the sin of 'hubris'[32] if he goes against the will of Artemis.",
      "It is ironic, therefore, that, when he returns from Troy, he commits a similar hubris when he walks on the tapestries laid out for him by Clytemnestra.",
      "This, arguably, negates many of his fatherly instincts, because the hubris he sought not to commit when he sacrificed Iphigenia has been committed anyway.",
      "Agamemnon's fatherly feelings are, however, set aside and he does sacrifice his daughter, in a way that the Chorus call 'reckless in fresh cruelty'[33], which shows him not as a figure of fatherhood, but instead as a king and a warrior who is doing all that must be done in order to go to war: '[",
      "Iphigenia's] supplications and her cries of father were nothing, nor the child's lamentation to kings passioned for battle.'[34",
      "] Through the Chorus' words, the audience and the reader now see how Agamemnon's paternal instincts have been repressed by his own and the other king's passion for war.",
      "This shows him no longer as a figure of fatherhood, but instead as a kingly figure who partakes in battles and wars and again shows how the role of fatherhood and of a king come into conflict with each other.",
      "Some critics have argued that Agamemnon's situation was such that he could not be to blame for his actions.",
      "In 'Problem and Spectacle - Studies in the 'Oresteia', William Whallon states a theory that 'Agamemnon is compliant, hesitant, vacillating before the altar'[35] and that he and Iphigenia were mere pawns in the game of destiny, thus absolving Agamemnon of blame for his actions, as if he went against the will of the gods, he would be guilty of hubris.",
      "However, other critics have argued to the contrary, arguing that 'there is no intimation that Agamemnon was compelled by any god or spell to choose as he did'[36], a concept stated by N.G.L. Hammond, and quoted by Whallon, which implies that Agamemnon acted of his own free will.",
      "My opinion is that Agamemnon did not want to murder his daughter, but he also did not want to commit hubris, thereby angering the gods, so he put his paternal instincts aside and took on the mantle of a king and a warrior.",
      "In some ways, the rejection of his paternal feelings is his 'hamartia'[37], which brings about his downfall.",
      "Another aspect of fatherhood that comes across in this play is the idea of a father as someone who should be avenged if they are killed unlawfully or if they were wronged when alive.",
      "Aeschylus brings this aspect across through the character of Aegisthus, the cousin of Agamemnon.",
      "Like Agamemnon, Aegisthus does not make his appearance until the late action of the play, but when he does appear, he immediately gives off an aura of a son wanting vengeance for his now dead father.",
      "This idea is especially shown with his words: 'For Atreus [",
      "Agamemnon's] father, King of Argolis - I tell you the clear story - drove my father forth, Thyestes, his own brother, who had challenged him in his king's right - forth from his city and home.'[38",
      "] From the start, even when telling the legend of how his father was driven out of his home, Aegisthus already comes across as a son wanting to avenge the wrong done his father.",
      "Once again, a figure of fatherhood is very dominant and influential because of his absence and the effect it has on the characters and their actions.",
      "Now that Agamemnon is dead, Aegisthus believes that justice has been done and that he can: '.....die in honour again, if die I must, having seen him caught in the cords of his just punishment.'[39",
      "] Once again, Aegisthus is presented as the son wanting revenge on his father and he uses another figure of fatherhood, Agamemnon, to exact his revenge.",
      "This gives an idea of justice and of one figure of fatherhood dying for another.",
      "The interesting thing about this is that it is not Aegisthus who commits the murder, but instead it is Clytemnestra, meaning that 'the agent of punishment is an adulterous wife, but one whose daughter has been cruelly sacrificed'[40], which adds to the idea of justice, and also presents Clytemnestra as an arguable figure of fatherhood, as she comes across in a very masculine and strong manner, which one could associate with a father figure.",
      "Therefore, the father figure is an interesting element in Greek drama as he shows, even in absence, what a powerful effect he can have on the action, as is shown in the 'Agamemnon' as well as relationships, or lack thereof, with his child, and how the absence of such a relationship can lead to a tragic outcome, as is shown by the character of Theseus in the 'Hippolytus'.",

    "text": "Steve tilts his head up towards he sky, eyes closed against the burning light of the sun. Light and warmth wrap around him, filling him up. This is his prayer and absolution to Helios and to Hera. With it done, he turns back inside where it's still cool and dim. Bucky is stretched on the bed, still tangled in the sheets. His harbinger of death, always carrying inside him the cold of the underworld. He smiles when Steve touches his shoulder, turning his head to look up at him. \"Are you needed today?\" He asks, grazing his fingers over Bucky's shoulder, following scars and burns etched into his skin, marking the line between old and new. There is no obvious sign that his left arm is different, that it was torn from his body, except for the scar tissue. The physical sign of his contract with Persephone, her magic under his skin. \"No,\" Bucky murmurs. \"Today I'm nothing but yours.\" Steve smiles and and leans down to kiss his shoulder, covering Persephone's mark with his own. The flesh is dead and Bucky can't feel more then pressure, but he sighs softly. \"I'll prove it's worthwhile.\" Bucky twists around onto his back, running his fingers through Steve's hair. \"You don't have to prove anything to me.\" \"Yes I do, every day.\" He presses his lips to Bucky's clavicle, tracing the bone under his skin. \"You saved my life-\" \"Hera did that. I just-\" He gasps when Steve scrapes his teeth over his neck. \"Yea, you just.\" Steve moves back up to catch Bucky's lips and his hands move over Bucky's body with practiced ease. There are soft sighs and moans between their lips, quickly swallowed up again by another kiss. The sun creeps further into the room as Steve presses slowly into Bucky, his moans growing louder at the heat around him. This is the only time Bucky's skin burns as hot as Steve's. It builds up slow, the day is theirs and Steve wants to take advantage of that. Slow and deep, as close as possible. Bucky's nails dig into Steve's skin. It hurts, a burning ache but Steve would never have him stop. It still feels like it ends too soon. Steve makes no move to get off of Bucky, enjoying the lingering warmth. Not caring that they're sticky, that he must be a heavy weight on Bucky. He kisses Bucky's jaw, trailing up to the spot behind his ear. \"My Eros,\" he whispers, barely more then a puff of air against his skin in case anyone is listening in. Bucky laughs softly and turns to nuzzle Steve's temple. \"Yours. Though that might be the wrong comparison.\" \"I disagree.\" Steve gets up slowly, not wanting to stop touching. Bucky is rumpled, lips red and skin flushed. He smirks up at Steve and reaches up to trail his fingers down Steve's stomach. \"Shower?\" His fingers come away from Steve's skin sticky with sweat and come. Steve smiles and takes Bucky by the wrist to pull him along. Under the water they touch each other, slowly jerk each other off. Bucky laughs against Steve's skin when Steve's fingers find a ticklish spot and for a moment they're children, laughing and grabbing at each other to get the upper hand. When they finally finish up in the shower, they can hear someone in the kitchen. They share a look and immediately go for their guns. But the person in their kitchen isn't someone they can shoot. Bucky makes a choked noise but Steve doesn't recognize her as quickly. \"Persephone?\" Bucky sounds horrified and confused. He lowers his gun but doesn't set it aside. Persephone smiles, small and enigmatic. They blink and they're no longer in their kitchen. This place Steve knows without needing to be told. The throne room of Hades is one of a kind. Persephone makes her way up to her seat, the black himation trailing after her. Their own towels are gone and instead they wear simple white chitons. \"I can change your clothes to something more modern if that's more comfortable.\" \"No, my lady,\" Bucky says quickly. \"We typically wear less around each other.\" Bucky glances at Steve, brushing his fingers over the back of his hand. She laughs, a sound that spreads warmth and cold throughout Steve at the same time. \"Of course.\" Her hands are white against the obsidian seat, making them seem like they glow. \"Of course.\" She taps her nails against the stone and looks at them as if she is only now contemplating why they're there. \"I have a dilemma, that needs your specific skills, my dear James.\" \"You know that's why I'm alive.\" Steve flinches, it's a sharp reminder that for awhile Bucky wasn't alive. But Persephone just smiles. \"Her name is Alice. And the reason I have brought your lover along-\" Suddenly they're both looking at Steve and he has to resist taking a step back. \"Is because I need to make sure you stay sane after this one. There was an accident and it's crazy how a little thing can change things. She was supposed to be in one place but took a step to the left and disrupted fate.\" Bucky looks hard at her and then at Steve. \"Sane?\" He repeats. \"Alice is eight.\" Her smile turns sympathetic but it's hard to determine if it's real. \"I have never asked for a child before, but even the smallest things can destroy the ravelings of the world. Sometimes especially the smallest things.\" She moves away from her throne and to Bucky. Steve barely notices her anymore, focused only on Bucky. \"If you cannot, I prefer my agents to be open with me. I will send you on to Lethe and this will not stand between us. But I know you can be gentle, my dear James. I did not choose blindly from my subjects.\" \"How do you gently kill a little girl?\" Steve asks, knowing he should keep his mouth shut. This is Bucky's choice, but the question slips out anyway. \"Drugs,\" Bucky answers, sounding numb and quiet. Already trying to disengage and Steve understands now why he's here as well. \"You- something quick and painless. She falls asleep and when she wakes up again she's here.\" \"Not here, child,\" Persephone says softly, cupping Bucky's cheek. \"She will go to Elysium. A child does not deserve the cold.\" Bucky looks at Steve, the words not even formed on his lips. Steve nods. He's there for Bucky, however Bucky needs. Persephone kisses Bucky's forehead and then they are back in their kitchen, towels once again around their waists. Bucky sinks slowly into one of the chairs. Steve moves immediately to be at his side, but before he can reach Bucky, everything slows. The air feels thick around him and his limbs don't move. \"Steven, hear me, ensure the child dies, it is more crucial then even young Persephone knows,\" Hera's voice echoes in his head. Steve almost stumbles when time speeds up again, but Bucky doesn't seem to notice. He sinks down in front of Bucky, trying not to think about Hera's words, knowing he'll never receive an explanation. \"I'm here,\" he murmurs, taking Bucky's hands in his, not sure if he's saying the words for himself or Bucky. \"You're so warm,\" Bucky sighs, lifting their hands to press his lips to Steve's knuckles. \"I love you, you know.\" \"Yea, noticed that.\" He leans in to kiss Bucky softly. \"I love you too.\" - He asked Bucky once if he ate while in Hades. Bucky laughed and said he tried, but he was only a ghost. Food turned to ash in his mouth. But Steve saw the evasion in his eyes. The half-truth woven somewhere into his words. It took him two weeks to give Steve the truth. \"Yes, I ate. I thought-\" he cut himself off with an annoyed growl and kicked at a convenient garbage can. \"I thought you were dead. Or would be soon enough, so I'd have you and this way I wouldn't be stuck in that pit. Everything is so empty there, I had to get out through any means necessary and when she offered me this arrangement.\" He shrugged and looked at Steve defiantly, waiting for judgment. Instead Steve kissed him because this time he can see the truth there. The one last piece that Bucky had skipped over, because eating the food would also mean he had to come back. \"We would still have had time together.\" He smiled against Bucky's lips even when Bucky scowls at being so easily figured out. \"She amended the agreement. Two months every year, to be served as her pet assassin. A day here, a day there. Not really comparable to traveling back and forth with the seasons.\" Steve couldn't stop smiling. \"You still tried.\" Bucky slowly relented and smiled back. \"Yea well, anything for you.\" - Bucky's preparations for a job are simple. He sends his prayers to Persephone, Steve can always smell the incense, something sharp which he thinks he should be able to recognize but never can. Preparing his weapons follows, in this case nothing more then a syringe. Steve leaves him alone for the entire ritual, knowing it's what Bucky needs. It doesn't make that moment when he finally steps out, shoulders set and eyes cold, any easier. He hates the way Bucky shuts himself down, drawing from something cold and hard that lingers from his time in Hades. He shies away from Steve's touch as if it burns. But he knows there is no other choice. If Bucky doesn't become the Winter Soldier, shrouding himself in ice, he'll go mad. The blood on his hands will choke him and Steve doesn't know if he'll be able to save him then, not even with all the warmth inside him. Steve follows when he leaves, burying his hands in his pockets so he doesn't accidentally reach out and disturb the calm in Bucky's mind. This is pain that Bucky has to bear on his own because if Bucky disobeys, if he backs out of this promise to do Persephone's bidding, Steve will lose him to the Fields. The gods will punish them both by separating them forever. So Steve follows and waits because it's all he can do. The little girl is in the hospital. There had been a car accident and she had leaned one way instead of the other. The doctors call it a miracle. They don't understand it was all an accident, that little element of human will that can throw off the balance of everything. Sometimes the world adjusts to recover and adapt. Sometimes it tangles up the Fates' strings and other steps have to be taken. Steve stays by the nurses station, flipping through a magazine. Everyone is too busy to stop to ask him why he's there, if they notice him. One of the ambrosia's lingering effects allows him to fade into the background. Not invisible, just not worth noticing. It's like stepping into another world, something beneath solid reality. He can see the demons which haunt the hospital's halls, feeding off of everything from despair to death to the return of hope. They acknowledge him with a nod but nothing else. He doesn't interest them, he carries too much life for them. Bucky they avoid entirely. It takes him two minutes, from entering the girl's room to when he steps out again. His eyes stay fixed on his feet until they're out of the hospital and back in the car. Bucky drives them to an empty lot and barely manages to stumble out before he retches. Steve waits, knowing it's not time yet. There is one more step in the ritual. Bucky throws his head back and screams. Steve can hear the words easily even with the car windows closed. \"It's done!\" Bucky's voice cracks as he yells, letting out something deep and dark. The ice he gathered to protect himself finally starting to melt and shatter. Only then does Steve get out and make his way over to Bucky. He pulls on the warmth from the sun, wraps himself in it so when he touches Bucky he can melt away the ice completely. Bucky flinches at the first touch as if Steve's touch physically burns him, but a second later he's melting into Steve, clinging to him. His hands worm their way under Steve's shirt, to press against skin and absorb as much warmth as possible. \"She was so small,\" Bucky whispers. \"She was so small and- and she fucking-\" He cuts himself off so Steve holds him tighter. He wishes he could fly, carry Bucky up as far as possible, away from this. Away from the constant thought of Hades under their feet. \"She smiled at me Steve, as if she knew.\" He presses his face against Steve's neck. \"It's ok.\" There's the feeling of thickness again around him and he looks up, past Bucky to see Hera there on the other side of the lot. She nods in approval and disappears. Steve closes his eyes and buries his nose in Bucky's hair. \"It's ok,\" he whispers. He doesn't know how long they stand there until Bucky finally moves, straightening a little to press his lips to Steve's cheek. \"Home,\" he murmurs. Steve smiles and agrees. \"I'm sorry, our day off got ruined,\" he says, taking the passenger seat this time and letting Steve drive. \"It's ok.\" He finds Bucky's hand and entwines their fingers, wanting to keep the touch constant. Needing to share his warmth. \"Let's go on vacation.\" Bucky rests his head against the window and twists to look at Steve, never letting go of his hand. \"Where should we go?\" Steve isn't sure if Bucky is just indulging him or just being serious, but Steve takes the time to truly consider the question. \"Let's go to Europe. Spain? We've never been to Spain.\" \"I have,\" Bucky bites his lower lip. \"It was for-\" \"You don't have to tell me,\" Steve says quickly. There are countless errands Bucky has run for Persephone that he has never heard about, and he won't make Bucky talk abut something he's not comfortable with. Just like there are things Hera has asked of Steve that he doesn't tell Bucky. Every single secret doesn't need to be aired, they trust each other. Bucky nods, accepting that and falls silent. Neither say anything for a short while. Steve wants to ask what's going through Bucky's head but knows he has to be patient. \"What about the coast of Spain?\" Bucky finally speaks up. \"I was in Madrid. So the coast, that would be ok. I haven't been there.\" Steve smiles, feeling lighter then he has since Persephone showed up in their kitchen. \"Then we're going to the coast of Spain.\" \"Just like that?\" \"Just like that.\" - Steve stays awake after Bucky falls asleep curled against him. He was once one of Bucky's targets, meant to die on that plane in the Arctic. Except Bucky couldn't pull the trigger once he saw it was Steve. He had once been a knot in the threads until Hera had taken him out of it entirely. He stares at his hand and wonders what color he bleeds, if it's still red or the golden ichor of the gods. He can't remember the last time he bled. Bucky's skin is warm where they touch, where they've been pressed together but when Steve touches his fingers to Bucky's back where his skin is still cool. A less obvious mark left over by Persephone, but still a lingering sign of who owns Bucky. Steve wishes he could wrap him up and hold him until his skin stayed warm. He wishes he can wrap Bucky up in the sun's warmth like he does to himself. He wishes a lot of things to make Bucky's life better and easier. \"Y're thinking,\" Bucky mumbles. \"Sorry, I thought you were asleep.\" Bucky hums softly and throws his arm over Steve's side. \"Tell me.\" Steve looks again at his hand, curling it up and slowly opening it. \"I wish- I know the goddesses are the only reason we're here and together. But I wish...\" He doesn't even know where to start. \"This is who we are now,\" Bucky murmurs. His hands move over Steve's skin, over hips and muscles and around to his cock. The cool touch of his hand sends a jolt through Steve. He lifts his head to kiss Steve and it's like a cool glass of water against Steve's heated skin. Bucky shifts his grip as the kiss deepens so he has his hand around both of them, stroking them together. With each roll of their hips, they rub together and heat soon replaces everything else. Steve gasps for air against Bucky's lips, feeling each breath getting stolen away only to be returned a second later, over and over until he's sure Bucky is in every pore and crevice. He's not sure if there is any way to separate them anymore. Them against everything. He comes hard and Bucky follows a moment later. \"I would do everything again to be with you,\" Bucky whispers. \"I would go to war against the gods for you.\" He rolls onto his back and tugs Steve over to rest his head on Bucky's shoulder. \"Don't say that.\" \"Too late.\" Bucky's arm is wrapped loosely around his shoulder. \"I hope they all hear me, I hope they know what I'd do for you.\" He doesn't ask if Steve would do the same. It probably doesn't even occur to him to ask so Steve cups his cheek and tilts his head down to look at him. \"I would do the same. I'd tear it apart to keep you.\" Bucky's eyes get wide and he kisses Steve hard despite the odd angle. - They leave for Spain the next afternoon. Persephone watches them go from far below in Hades and Hera keeps an eye on them from above on Olympus. Steve and Bucky tell themselves they're taking a break, away from gods and goddesses and obligations, but they both know there is no real break. If they're lucky, Hera and Persephone will allow them the break, but they are so rarely that lucky. This time they're given five days before it's Hera's turn, appearing in Bucky's chair on the beach when he gets up to get them drinks. She wears sunglasses and a swimsuit, somehow looking perfectly natural sitting there. As if she had always been. \"I'm not leaving Spain, not yet,\" Steve says immediately. He knows it's wrong to tell her 'no' but he needs this break. Hera arches an eyebrow at his tone but doesn't comment on it yet. \"You'll be back soon. My errand is simple.\" Steve bites his tongue. \"I need you to make a delivery. Unfortunately, the person I need the delivery made to is warded against my peaking in otherwise I would do it myself.\" \"Why not Iris?\" \"She is still a goddess. However, you walk the line.\" She takes a pendant from around her neck and hands it over to Steve. \"It will be but a moment and you can come back to your vacation.\" Steve locks eyes with Bucky as he comes back across the sand. He hopes it's enough to express his regret before Hera whisks him away. He's not sure where they end up but they're in front of an office building. \"Take it to Pepper Potts,\" Hera directs. \"No one else.\" Steve feels sick but there's nothing to do but walk inside. He can feel the wards as he steps into the building, they make his skin crawl but otherwise he slips below their notice. There are only a handful of gods who can make wards powerful enough to keep Hera out but Steve doesn't have to think hard about who might have made these. This is Stark Industries after all. Tony Stark is an agent of Hephaestus. Just like his father before him, back when Steve directed his prayers to Demeter and Athena for life and strength. He wonders what they think of him now, if they ever notice him. He slips past the secretary and security, barely earning a second glance. Pepper Potts' office is trickier. The wards are strengthened here and there is no sneaking in. So Steve clears his throat at her assistant's door as he lets himself in. Luckily the door to Pepper's office is open and he can speak directly to her. \"Ms. Potts.\" \"What? Who-\" She's immediately on his feet, storming towards him. \"Hera sent me to deliver this to you.\" He holds out the pendant, immediately realizing he has no idea what it does or means. \"The wards prevent her from doing so directly.\" \"You're Steve Rogers?\" She asks carefully, touching the pendant with her finger tips. \"Yes ma'am.\" \"Thank you. It is a gift from Hecate, I should have guessed it would not be sent through normal channels.\" Her fingers close around the pendant and he gratefully lets go. \"Tony mentioned you. I know you spoke with him once.\" \"Once was enough ma'am.\" Tony is another he met because of Hera's errands, but that was to sabotage a mechanical suit he was building with Hephaestus's help. The conversation had been more threats snarled at each other. Steve was grateful not to have much to do with him, working with the father before Steve even had to be loyal to Hera had been taxing enough. She laughs in understanding. \"Working for the Lady is a tricky business. I know, no choice, but good luck, be careful Mr. Rogers.\" He smiles and leans in to kiss her on the cheek. \"Be careful as well, Ms. Potts.\" \"Let me escort you out, it will be easier then leaving the way you came.\" She takes his arm instead of waiting and leads him back towards the entrance. They talk about nothing while they walk. He almost regrets walking out through the door when they reach it. He steps from the door and directly back onto the beach in Spain. Bucky's sitting on his chair, fidgeting with his drink, shoulders tight with tension and Steve makes his way back to him as fast as possible. \"I'm so sorry,\" he murmurs, kissing the scarring on Bucky's shoulder, up to his neck. \"I'm so sorry, I didn't want to.\" Bucky touches his fingers to Steve's lips, cutting him off. \"I know.\" He sighs and nudges Steve so he's leaning back on one of the chairs and Bucky arranges himself on top of him, Steve's arms around his waist. \"This is our life. But we're alive and together. It's enough, right?\" \"It's enough,\" Steve says. \"What did she have you do? Anything exciting?\" \"Nah, just delivered some jewelry.\" He runs his fingers through Bucky's hair. \"Don't worry about it. I'm here. I'm safe.\" Bucky's hands find one of his and grip tightly. They sit like that until the sun goes down. - \"You know what you are?\" Hera said the first time they met. It was on a rooftop in Manhattan, the world at his feet but he was unable to step into it. He shouldn't be alive, Bucky had had his gun pressed to Steve's temple and had instead fled. SHIELD never knew, though they clearly knew of Bucky. They called him the Winter Soldier, a reference to Persephone's control. \"I'm a dead man,\" Steve answered her. \"No, no, well you will be if you don't accept my offer because then nothing can protect you. Bucky Barnes is not the only way to die in this world.\" She leaned in and he could feel the net close around him. \"You are Ares and Athena, if those two could ever get around all the obstacles between them and tolerate each other long enough to create a child. You are the strength and fury of battle tempered with tactics.\" There was suddenly a cup in her hand and she held it out for him. \"Drink this, your thread will be safe, out of the web and you can be with your beloved.\" it was tempting to be distracted by the thought of being with Bucky again without fear of the gods. Without fear of death. \"What's the catch?\" She nodded, possibly impressed he thought to ask the question but he grew up on stories of heroes and learned from their mistakes. \"You will become a demi-god. And you will be mine. I can take away what I give. For the rest of a mortal lifetime you will reside here and carry out tasks for me. At the end of that lifetime, your debt will be paid.\" Steve considered it only a brief moment before he took the cup.",

      "He lifts his head to kiss Steve and it's like a cool glass of water against Steve's heated skin.",
      "Bucky shifts his grip as the kiss deepens so he has his hand around both of them, stroking them together.",
      "With each roll of their hips, they rub together and heat soon replaces everything else.",
      "Steve gasps for air against Bucky's lips, feeling each breath getting stolen away only to be returned a second later, over and over until he's sure Bucky is in every pore and crevice.",
      "He's not sure if there is any way to separate them anymore.",
      "Them against everything.",
      "He comes hard and Bucky follows a moment later.",
      "\"I would do everything again to be with you,\" Bucky whispers.",
      "\"I would go to war against the gods for you.\"",
      "He rolls onto his back and tugs Steve over to rest his head on Bucky's shoulder.",
      "\"Don't say that.\"",
      "\"Too late.\"",
      "Bucky's arm is wrapped loosely around his shoulder.",
      "\"I hope they all hear me, I hope they know what I'd do for you.\"",
      "He doesn't ask if Steve would do the same.",
      "It probably doesn't even occur to him to ask so Steve cups his cheek and tilts his head down to look at him.",
      "\"I would do the same.",
      "I'd tear it apart to keep you.\"",
      "Bucky's eyes get wide and he kisses Steve hard despite the odd angle.",
      "- They leave for Spain the next afternoon.",
      "Persephone watches them go from far below in Hades and Hera keeps an eye on them from above on Olympus.",
      "Steve and Bucky tell themselves they're taking a break, away from gods and goddesses and obligations, but they both know there is no real break.",
      "If they're lucky, Hera and Persephone will allow them the break, but they are so rarely that lucky.",
      "This time they're given five days before it's Hera's turn, appearing in Bucky's chair on the beach when he gets up to get them drinks.",
      "She wears sunglasses and a swimsuit, somehow looking perfectly natural sitting there.",
      "As if she had always been.",
      "\"I'm not leaving Spain, not yet,\" Steve says immediately.",
      "He knows it's wrong to tell her 'no' but he needs this break.",
      "Hera arches an eyebrow at his tone but doesn't comment on it yet.",
      "\"You'll be back soon.",
      "My errand is simple.\"",
      "Steve bites his tongue.",
      "\"I need you to make a delivery.",
      "Unfortunately, the person I need the delivery made to is warded against my peaking in otherwise I would do it myself.\"",
      "\"Why not Iris?\"",
      "\"She is still a goddess.",
      "However, you walk the line.\"",
      "She takes a pendant from around her neck and hands it over to Steve.",
      "\"It will be but a moment and you can come back to your vacation.\"",
      "Steve locks eyes with Bucky as he comes back across the sand.",
      "He hopes it's enough to express his regret before Hera whisks him away.",
      "He's not sure where they end up but they're in front of an office building.",
      "\"Take it to Pepper Potts,\" Hera directs.",
      "\"No one else.\"",
      "Steve feels sick but there's nothing to do but walk inside.",
      "He can feel the wards as he steps into the building, they make his skin crawl but otherwise he slips below their notice.",
      "There are only a handful of gods who can make wards powerful enough to keep Hera out but Steve doesn't have to think hard about who might have made these.",
      "This is Stark Industries after all.",
      "Tony Stark is an agent of Hephaestus.",
      "Just like his father before him, back when Steve directed his prayers to Demeter and Athena for life and strength.",
      "He wonders what they think of him now, if they ever notice him.",
      "He slips past the secretary and security, barely earning a second glance.",
      "Pepper Potts' office is trickier.",
      "The wards are strengthened here and there is no sneaking in.",
      "So Steve clears his throat at her assistant's door as he lets himself in.",
      "Luckily the door to Pepper's office is open and he can speak directly to her.",
      "\"Ms. Potts.\"",
      "\"What?",
      "Who-\" She's immediately on his feet, storming towards him.",
      "\"Hera sent me to deliver this to you.\"",
      "He holds out the pendant, immediately realizing he has no idea what it does or means.",
      "\"The wards prevent her from doing so directly.\"",
      "\"You're Steve Rogers?\"",
      "She asks carefully, touching the pendant with her finger tips.",
      "\"Yes ma'am.\"",
      "\"Thank you.",
      "It is a gift from Hecate, I should have guessed it would not be sent through normal channels.\"",
      "Her fingers close around the pendant and he gratefully lets go.",
      "\"Tony mentioned you.",
      "I know you spoke with him once.\"",
      "\"Once was enough ma'am.\"",
      "Tony is another he met because of Hera's errands, but that was to sabotage a mechanical suit he was building with Hephaestus's help.",
      "The conversation had been more threats snarled at each other.",
      "Steve was grateful not to have much to do with him, working with the father before Steve even had to be loyal to Hera had been taxing enough.",
      "She laughs in understanding.",
      "\"Working for the Lady is a tricky business.",
      "I know, no choice, but good luck, be careful Mr. Rogers.\"",
      "He smiles and leans in to kiss her on the cheek.",
      "\"Be careful as well, Ms. Potts.\"",
      "\"Let me escort you out, it will be easier then leaving the way you came.\"",
      "She takes his arm instead of waiting and leads him back towards the entrance.",
      "They talk about nothing while they walk.",
      "He almost regrets walking out through the door when they reach it.",
      "He steps from the door and directly back onto the beach in Spain.",
      "Bucky's sitting on his chair, fidgeting with his drink, shoulders tight with tension and Steve makes his way back to him as fast as possible.",
      "\"I'm so sorry,\" he murmurs, kissing the scarring on Bucky's shoulder, up to his neck.",
      "\"I'm so sorry, I didn't want to.\"",
      "Bucky touches his fingers to Steve's lips, cutting him off.",
      "\"I know.\"",
      "He sighs and nudges Steve so he's leaning back on one of the chairs and Bucky arranges himself on top of him, Steve's arms around his waist.",
      "\"This is our life.",
      "But we're alive and together.",
      "It's enough, right?\"",
      "\"It's enough,\" Steve says.",
      "\"What did she have you do?",
      "Anything exciting?\"",
      "\"Nah, just delivered some jewelry.\"",
      "He runs his fingers through Bucky's hair.",
      "\"Don't worry about it.",
      "I'm here.",
      "I'm safe.\"",
      "Bucky's hands find one of his and grip tightly.",
      "They sit like that until the sun goes down.",
      "- \"You know what you are?\"",
      "Hera said the first time they met.",
      "It was on a rooftop in Manhattan, the world at his feet but he was unable to step into it.",
      "He shouldn't be alive, Bucky had had his gun pressed to Steve's temple and had instead fled.",
      "SHIELD never knew, though they clearly knew of Bucky.",
      "They called him the Winter Soldier, a reference to Persephone's control.",
      "\"I'm a dead man,\" Steve answered her.",
      "\"No, no, well you will be if you don't accept my offer because then nothing can protect you.",
      "Bucky Barnes is not the only way to die in this world.\"",
      "She leaned in and he could feel the net close around him.",
      "\"You are Ares and Athena, if those two could ever get around all the obstacles between them and tolerate each other long enough to create a child.",
      "You are the strength and fury of battle tempered with tactics.\"",
      "There was suddenly a cup in her hand and she held it out for him.",
      "\"Drink this, your thread will be safe, out of the web and you can be with your beloved.\"",
      "it was tempting to be distracted by the thought of being with Bucky again without fear of the gods.",
      "Without fear of death.",
      "\"What's the catch?\"",
      "She nodded, possibly impressed he thought to ask the question but he grew up on stories of heroes and learned from their mistakes.",
      "\"You will become a demi-god.",
      "And you will be mine.",
      "I can take away what I give.",
      "For the rest of a mortal lifetime you will reside here and carry out tasks for me.",
      "At the end of that lifetime, your debt will be paid.\"",
      "Steve considered it only a brief moment before he took the cup."

    "text": "They're lying on a blanket in the cemetery, just beyond the giant vault belonging to Mayor Mills' family. April has just begun and the unpredictable Maine weather had not been kind to them this year, drudging up more snow and hail in the past few weeks than Kieran could remember any year before. It seemed that things had been changing a lot lately, though no-one could seem to say why. Even though the air was particularly balmy that Tuesday, they had straggled around a bit to find a clear spot in the grass. Most of the cemetery was still covered in wet, molding leaves or melting patches of snow. Coupled with the spooky quality created by the crumbing graves and general aura of isolation, the place did not leave much to be desired. It was the type of place Lucy would have normally avoided at all costs. However, most nights her roommate, Peyton, didn't come waltzing in with Charlie, her ex-boyfriend, to watch the Walking Dead after their kickboxing class. And it definitely had never before resulted in the pair finding her horizontal on the couch with the town's number one undesirable. It had been just about all she could do not to die of embarrassment. Needless to say, getting out of their shoebox-sized apartment had been necessary. \"That one,\" She pointed to a row of stars. She vaguely remembered it from a childhood tour to Storybrooke's observatory as Virgo, but the game they'd started had become much more fun. She would pick out a seemingly random cluster of stars and Kieran would pull a story from thin air to support her newfound constellation. So far he'd incorrectly told a number of Greek and Roman myths that she'd learned in school, dubbing Achilles name in place of Icarus' in a story flying too close to the sun, melting wings, and falling to the sea. Instead of drowning, he was also saved by a beautiful mermaid who fell in love with him. Lucy had snorted with laughter at the story, much to Kieran's supposed discontent. However, she'd caught him observing her and smiling when he'd thought her gaze was turned back to the sky. She'd catalogued this away, as she did with all the unexpectedly kind moments she experienced with him, attributing it to her eyes playing tricks on her. She knew she was simply grasping at straws, seeing what she wanted to see. He chuckled low in his throat, \"Demeter, the goddess of the harvest.\" \"That one actually sounds half right,\" She giggled, wrapping the cover blanket more tightly around her. She had a thick coat on beneath it but she still shivered, trying to keep herself warm as the temperature dipped lower by the hour. \"That's because it is,\" He grinned, propping himself up on his elbow to face her. His other hand trailed down the side of her face. He rested it on her neck, fooling a bit with a lock of her hair. She smacked his hand away, scoffing in annoyance at him. He withdrew it, resting it on the blanket between them. She tried her best to act satisfied to see it go, feigning her indifference with a haughty mask. \"Do tell, oh jester.\" She can tell by the way he breathes in deeply and his eyes darken in that dangerous way that he has accepted her challenge. She can feel her heart racing excitedly as she waits for the story. \"Demeter was the mother of the goddess Persephone. Her daughter was said to be the most beautiful creature on God's earth, with glowing blonde hair and sparkling blue eyes. It is said that the girl, the epitome of all that was light and good, inspired love in all those who laid eyes upon her. And the devil himself was no different; he came upon the girl sitting in a meadow full of flowers and decided she was the most radiant of them all. And so Hades kidnapped the girl, pulling her back down to hell with him.\" His eyes rested on her as he licked his lips in that half-evil, half-maddening way of his, his tongue catching at the corner of his mouth. She passed off the shiver that fell down her spine as one of cold rather than excitement. \"To make her Queen of the Underworld,\" she murmured, her mitten-clad hands bringing the covers up to her neck. He nodded simply, pulling her to him gently. Her shuddering stopped as she collided with the sudden warmth. \"But a ray of light doesn't belong to the darkness,\" She bit her lip and stared up at him expectantly. \"It needs the sun to grow, to nurture. And so Demeter's crops died without this beautiful beacon of light to guide them, growing cold and dead as they lost the one thing they truly needed.\" He didn't say the word but she could hear it echoing in the silence, love. Without the love of her daughter, Demeter crumbled into a black-hearted wretch rather than a goddess, taking her vengeance out on the harvest people needed to live. He was silent for a moment, studying her. She turned her head down, trying to slow her pulse down so he wouldn't feel her blood rushing underneath his fingertips and to hide the blush creeping up on her cheeks. Usually when they laid together, it wasn't like this. He might put his gaze upon her lips, but it would only be for a moment or two before capturing them with his own. It was lust that had driven them together mostly, tinged with a need to find someone who was so fundamentally unlike Charlie that there was no way for her heart to confuse them. And yet, she could feel her heartbeat drumming against her ribs, threatening to break through them if she didn't find a way to catch her breath. It was the kind of emotion that her picture-perfect boyfriend of days past had never managed to stir in her, that no-one had besides him. It might be exhilarating if it hadn't been so frightening. \"What about Hades though?\" She asked abruptly, looking him straight in the eyes. He chuckled for a moment, before moving his hand deeper into her hair, fisting it and letting his fingers run down through the ends. \"What about him, sweetheart?\" He said in a whisper, his breathe tickling her lips. She flickered her eyes down for a moment sadly, before meeting his blue eyes. They were her favorite thing about Kieran but she seldom let herself look into them, what she saw there... There was a sadness, a darkness to their light color that was riddled with sharp edges and anger. \"He loved her too,\" She stated, leaning forward slowly and pressing a light kiss between his beautiful, painful eyes on the bridge of his nose. He pulled away from her, rolling onto his back again and staring straight up at the stars in question. She felt colder than before, in that moment, a kind of chill that ran less through her body and stuck in her throat. She pretended that it wasn't a bother and concentrated on his stony silence instead. He laid there, not speaking, for so long she thought he'd forgotten her presence completely. She was about to reach out and touch his arm when his words surprised her. \"He knew he could not keep her.\" His words were quiet, almost scratchy. \"Persephone was not the same from the moment she stepped into the underworld. She may have been immortal but she had spent so much time around her mother, around life, that she went through a change without it. She was still beautiful, but her light hair turned dark, almost black, because the sun was not there to kiss it with strands of gold. Her eyes were still the same beautiful blue but the fires of hell turned them fierce. Every time a new boat passed by her throne on the River Styx and she saw the people crying for their lives, her eyes became more cold and rabid, like a wolf in a cage. Hades wanted more anything to keep her, to make her his queen, but he could not, so he set her free.\" He rested his hand on the middle of his chest and laid back, closing his eyes tightly. Lucy could see his jaw clench as he fought with himself, trying to keep himself level-headed. She frowned, and before she could stop herself, she was unclasping his hands and tucking his arm around her, her face burrowed into his neck. She refused to look up at him, but she could feel his eyes on her. \"It took her a while, didn't it?\" She smiled as she wrapped her arm around him, making herself a bit more comfortable. \"To come back to him, I mean. She waited nine months, three-quarters of a year it took her to realize that sunlight and fresh air and pure unadulterated joy are all wonderful things, but perhaps they are not enough to base an existence on. It's not always an easy thing to realize that the love you know...a mother's love, that is, is not the only love. It is not always the strongest one, the first one. Hades had loved her with a fire and a passion no other man had been able to, and it was hard to fathom. I think she realized it was because he had really loved all of her, even the painful parts, not just her mask of beauty and grace.\" She could feel his smile as he nuzzled against her hair. \"I think they were wrong, the people who wrote down the myths. He didn't give her the pomegranate, she made it herself. She was the daughter of the harvest and she grew a way back to her love, and she shaped it like a heart. Four chambers full of seeds as red as blood, one for every quarter of the year. And three can be eaten without consequence, but when she laid her mouth upon the fourth, she was returned to him.\" She turned her head up, tracing her fingertips along his jaw. \"There is love in the darkness as well, after all.\" \"Maybe you're right, princess,\" Her heart seemed to skip at that word. He had called her lots of things before (love, sweetheart, darling, strumpet) but she had never heard that word fall from his lips before and yet, it felt so achingly familiar to her, even the inflection he said it with. Like she had heard it in another li- \"Perhaps we should make some love in the darkness as well,\" And with that, his lips were on her neck and any words spoken from them forgotten. Instead, as he dropped them lower and carefully unbuttoned her pea coat, new sounds of pleasure began falling from her mouth instead. Yes, his little nicknames would have to wait until later.",

      "\"But a ray of light doesn't belong to the darkness,\" She bit her lip and stared up at him expectantly.",
      "\"It needs the sun to grow, to nurture.",
      "And so Demeter's crops died without this beautiful beacon of light to guide them, growing cold and dead as they lost the one thing they truly needed.\"",
      "He didn't say the word but she could hear it echoing in the silence, love.",
      "Without the love of her daughter, Demeter crumbled into a black-hearted wretch rather than a goddess, taking her vengeance out on the harvest people needed to live.",
      "He was silent for a moment, studying her.",
      "She turned her head down, trying to slow her pulse down so he wouldn't feel her blood rushing underneath his fingertips and to hide the blush creeping up on her cheeks.",
      "Usually when they laid together, it wasn't like this.",
      "He might put his gaze upon her lips, but it would only be for a moment or two before capturing them with his own.",
      "It was lust that had driven them together mostly, tinged with a need to find someone who was so fundamentally unlike Charlie that there was no way for her heart to confuse them.",
      "And yet, she could feel her heartbeat drumming against her ribs, threatening to break through them if she didn't find a way to catch her breath.",
      "It was the kind of emotion that her picture-perfect boyfriend of days past had never managed to stir in her, that no-one had besides him.",
      "It might be exhilarating if it hadn't been so frightening.",
      "\"What about Hades though?\"",
      "She asked abruptly, looking him straight in the eyes.",
      "He chuckled for a moment, before moving his hand deeper into her hair, fisting it and letting his fingers run down through the ends.",
      "\"What about him, sweetheart?\"",
      "He said in a whisper, his breathe tickling her lips.",
      "She flickered her eyes down for a moment sadly, before meeting his blue eyes.",
      "They were her favorite thing about Kieran but she seldom let herself look into them, what she saw there...",
      "There was a sadness, a darkness to their light color that was riddled with sharp edges and anger.",
      "\"He loved her too,\" She stated, leaning forward slowly and pressing a light kiss between his beautiful, painful eyes on the bridge of his nose.",
      "He pulled away from her, rolling onto his back again and staring straight up at the stars in question.",
      "She felt colder than before, in that moment, a kind of chill that ran less through her body and stuck in her throat.",
      "She pretended that it wasn't a bother and concentrated on his stony silence instead.",
      "He laid there, not speaking, for so long she thought he'd forgotten her presence completely.",
      "She was about to reach out and touch his arm when his words surprised her.",
      "\"He knew he could not keep her.\"",
      "His words were quiet, almost scratchy.",
      "\"Persephone was not the same from the moment she stepped into the underworld.",
      "She may have been immortal but she had spent so much time around her mother, around life, that she went through a change without it.",
      "She was still beautiful, but her light hair turned dark, almost black, because the sun was not there to kiss it with strands of gold.",
      "Her eyes were still the same beautiful blue but the fires of hell turned them fierce.",
      "Every time a new boat passed by her throne on the River Styx and she saw the people crying for their lives, her eyes became more cold and rabid, like a wolf in a cage.",
      "Hades wanted more anything to keep her, to make her his queen, but he could not, so he set her free.\"",
      "He rested his hand on the middle of his chest and laid back, closing his eyes tightly.",
      "Lucy could see his jaw clench as he fought with himself, trying to keep himself level-headed.",
      "She frowned, and before she could stop herself, she was unclasping his hands and tucking his arm around her, her face burrowed into his neck.",
      "She refused to look up at him, but she could feel his eyes on her.",
      "\"It took her a while, didn't it?\"",
      "She smiled as she wrapped her arm around him, making herself a bit more comfortable.",
      "\"To come back to him, I mean.",
      "She waited nine months, three-quarters of a year it took her to realize that sunlight and fresh air and pure unadulterated joy are all wonderful things, but perhaps they are not enough to base an existence on.",
      "It's not always an easy thing to realize that the love you know...a mother's love, that is, is not the only love.",
      "It is not always the strongest one, the first one.",
      "Hades had loved her with a fire and a passion no other man had been able to, and it was hard to fathom.",
      "I think she realized it was because he had really loved all of her, even the painful parts, not just her mask of beauty and grace.\"",
      "She could feel his smile as he nuzzled against her hair.",
      "\"I think they were wrong, the people who wrote down the myths.",
      "He didn't give her the pomegranate, she made it herself.",
      "She was the daughter of the harvest and she grew a way back to her love, and she shaped it like a heart.",
      "Four chambers full of seeds as red as blood, one for every quarter of the year.",
      "And three can be eaten without consequence, but when she laid her mouth upon the fourth, she was returned to him.\"",
      "She turned her head up, tracing her fingertips along his jaw.",
      "\"There is love in the darkness as well, after all.\"",
      "\"Maybe you're right, princess,\" Her heart seemed to skip at that word.",
      "He had called her lots of things before (love, sweetheart, darling, strumpet) but she had never heard that word fall from his lips before and yet, it felt so achingly familiar to her, even the inflection he said it with.",
      "Like she had heard it in another li-",
      "\"Perhaps we should make some love in the darkness as well,\" And with that, his lips were on her neck and any words spoken from them forgotten.",
      "Instead, as he dropped them lower and carefully unbuttoned her pea coat, new sounds of pleasure began falling from her mouth instead.",
      "Yes, his little nicknames would have to wait until later."

    "text": "Persephone grew tired of her chambers after three days. At least, she thought three days had passed, but she couldn't be sure. Her chambers were cold, dark marble, and they only served as a painful reminder of everything she had lost. Hades had given her strict rules about which places she could and could not go, and had then disappeared to manage another Spartan war, so she had been on her own the entire time. Keeping his rules in mind, she cautiously peeked out of her door. When no one appeared to scold her, she continued walking. As long as she stayed within the dark villa, and out of the basement, Hades had said, she had free reign. The few glimpses of the outer world that she saw between the columns were enough to convince Persephone to obey. She wandered for quite a while: her feet never tired and the sky never changed, as it did on the surface, so she couldn't say how long. Once she was back - though that seemed an eternity from now - she would ask her uncle Hephaestus to make her a time keeping device. Without days and seasons to track, she had no idea when her six months would be over, and she didn't entirely trust Hades to keep his word. Of course, her mother could easily count the seasons, and she would be down here in an instant if the dark god reneged. Eventually, Persephone found her way back to the gardens at the center of the villa. She was wary at first - walking through the colonnades around the square - but eventually the living plants drew her in. She simply wouldn't eat anything, and that would be that. As she stepped off the marble porch, her feet hit dirt, and Persephone was filled with a sense of belonging. They might be far from the sun and sky that she was used to, but these were plants, and therefore a part of her mother's domain. Being among them was, even if only slightly, like being home again. The plants were different than those she was used to, mostly dark or silvery, with very little of the glorious colors that she loved, but they were living, growing florae. After much time spent gently plucking dead leaves, Persephone began to realize something. This garden was dying. Though she didn't know these types of plants specifically, she had been around growing things her entire life. These plants were wilting, browning around the edges, and some were drying out. She took a quick walk through the rest of the garden, and saw that the problem was widespread. There wasn't a corner of the garden that was untouched by blight and decay. The state of the garden emboldened her enough that Persephone actually approached Hades' throne room. A moment after she arrived, he appeared on his throne. \"Yes?\" Persephone gathered her courage. \"I wanted to ask. Is there a gardener?\" Hades considered her for a long moment; long enough that Persephone began to fidget. Finally he said, \"I employ no servants. If you need something, you have the power to summon it. Simply press this and ask.\" A small black stone appeared floating in the air before her. Tentatively, Persephone reached out and collected it. It felt warm in her hand and she tucked it into her pocket. \"Anything else?\" Hades asked dryly. \"No, thank you.\" Persephone started to back out of the room, but before she could, Hades vanished. Accepting his dismissal, Persephone fled back to her garden. Once there, she pulled the stone out of her pocket. \"A watering can,\" she said softly. Immediately, a medium sized watering can - black of course - appeared at her feet. Persephone picked it up and began to water the nearest plants; to her pleased surprise, the can never emptied. Once the entire garden was damp and glistening, she tucked the can into a corner and asked her stone for a rake. All afternoon, or evening, or day, or whatever it was, she worked, tending the garden. When she was tired, she lay down on the grass, and when she rose, she resumed her work. Eventually, the garden began to respond to her work. Plants that had shriveled or withered were now robust with new foliage. Blooms that she had never seen before sprang to life, and gleamed with dew. The entire garden had blossomed into life, silver-green and brimming with life. It was lush, and growing, and it was hers. One day (if it was that) Persephone was gently pruning a tree when she felt someone staring at her. Turning, she saw Hades standing on the porch beyond the garden. Nervously, she approached him. \"Yes?\" \"The six months have passed,\" he said neutrally. \"You return to the surface this afternoon.\" \"What?\" Had six months really passed? It was impossible to tell the changing days, months, and seasons down here, but Persephone still couldn't believe that so much time had gone by. And she had spent the entire time in her garden. Her garden. With a pang, Persephone realized that she had enjoyed her time here, in her garden. She might even miss it, while she was gone. And, the thought occurred to her, when she was gone, the garden would wither again from neglect! She didn't want that to happen! Hades was staring at her oddly again, but Persephone didn't care. Her hand stole to her neck, where she had braided a necklace of vines from her garden. At the end of it rested the summoning stone that Hades had given her. Squeezing it, she whispered, \"I wish for a caretaker for my garden, until I return.\" Hades raised one eyebrow at her, but a moment later a non-descript human soul appeared beside her. \"Take care of it,\" she instructed it. The specter nodded, and ambled off into the trees. After another long moment of staring at her, Hades held out his arm. \"Ready?\" Persephone nodded and accepted his arm, realizing that it was the first time she had touched him since her abduction. He wasn't as cold as she remembered. As they slipped up to the surface, Persephone realized that, as happy as she was to see the sun again, she would miss her underworld garden. And she would have something to look forward to upon her return in six months.",

      "After much time spent gently plucking dead leaves, Persephone began to realize something.",
      "This garden was dying.",
      "Though she didn't know these types of plants specifically, she had been around growing things her entire life.",
      "These plants were wilting, browning around the edges, and some were drying out.",
      "She took a quick walk through the rest of the garden, and saw that the problem was widespread.",
      "There wasn't a corner of the garden that was untouched by blight and decay.",
      "The state of the garden emboldened her enough that Persephone actually approached Hades' throne room.",
      "A moment after she arrived, he appeared on his throne.",
      "\"Yes?\" Persephone gathered her courage.",
      "\"I wanted to ask.",
      "Is there a gardener?\" Hades considered her for a long moment; long enough that Persephone began to fidget.",
      "Finally he said, \"I employ no servants.",
      "If you need something, you have the power to summon it.",
      "Simply press this and ask.\"",
      "A small black stone appeared floating in the air before her.",
      "Tentatively, Persephone reached out and collected it.",
      "It felt warm in her hand and she tucked it into her pocket.",
      "\"Anything else?\" Hades asked dryly.",
      "\"No, thank you.\"",
      "Persephone started to back out of the room, but before she could, Hades vanished.",
      "Accepting his dismissal, Persephone fled back to her garden.",
      "Once there, she pulled the stone out of her pocket.",
      "\"A watering can,\" she said softly.",
      "Immediately, a medium sized watering can - black of course - appeared at her feet.",
      "Persephone picked it up and began to water the nearest plants; to her pleased surprise, the can never emptied.",
      "Once the entire garden was damp and glistening, she tucked the can into a corner and asked her stone for a rake.",
      "All afternoon, or evening, or day, or whatever it was, she worked, tending the garden.",
      "When she was tired, she lay down on the grass, and when she rose, she resumed her work.",
      "Eventually, the garden began to respond to her work.",
      "Plants that had shriveled or withered were now robust with new foliage.",
      "Blooms that she had never seen before sprang to life, and gleamed with dew.",
      "The entire garden had blossomed into life, silver-green and brimming with life.",
      "It was lush, and growing, and it was hers.",
      "One day (if it was that) Persephone was gently pruning a tree when she felt someone staring at her.",
      "Turning, she saw Hades standing on the porch beyond the garden.",
      "Nervously, she approached him.",
      "\"Yes?\"",
      "\"The six months have passed,\" he said neutrally.",
      "\"You return to the surface this afternoon.\"",
      "\"What?\" Had six months really passed?",
      "It was impossible to tell the changing days, months, and seasons down here, but Persephone still couldn't believe that so much time had gone by.",
      "And she had spent the entire time in her garden.",
      "Her garden.",
      "With a pang, Persephone realized that she had enjoyed her time here, in her garden.",
      "She might even miss it, while she was gone.",
      "And, the thought occurred to her, when she was gone, the garden would wither again from neglect!",
      "She didn't want that to happen!",
      "Hades was staring at her oddly again, but Persephone didn't care.",
      "Her hand stole to her neck, where she had braided a necklace of vines from her garden.",
      "At the end of it rested the summoning stone that Hades had given her.",
      "Squeezing it, she whispered, \"I wish for a caretaker for my garden, until I return.\"",
      "Hades raised one eyebrow at her, but a moment later a non-descript human soul appeared beside her.",
      "\"Take care of it,\" she instructed it.",
      "The specter nodded, and ambled off into the trees.",
      "After another long moment of staring at her, Hades held out his arm.",
      "\"Ready?\" Persephone nodded and accepted his arm, realizing that it was the first time she had touched him since her abduction.",
      "He wasn't as cold as she remembered.",
      "As they slipped up to the surface, Persephone realized that, as happy as she was to see the sun again, she would miss her underworld garden.",
      "And she would have something to look forward to upon her return in six months."

    "text": "The best myths begin, as the best stories do, with a character, a hero, who wants something. The best myths throw trials in the face of that hero, he defeats them all but generally, as the tragedians are wont, he loses something he loved. Daedalus lost a son but gained his freedom, that's what matters here. Fate repeats her stories because people rarely listen, martyrs suffer on a different cultural cross each time but constantly they seek better things, greater things. They do not learn and yet the elders mutter, pass wisdoms, say \"take a lesson from Icarus\", \"learn from the mistakes of the gods\"; and fate repeats and repeats. This is a story about fate, no more and no less. - The first time and there is a voice in his head that weaves words louder than the calls of his father, tells him 'you are blessed Icarus,' and that 'the gods themselves favour you! fly to the sun, Icarus, and you will be a god among them.' Icarus asks himself: what is the sun to a mortal who can fly? The answer greets him from the waves. The answer is 'still hot enough to burn the wings of you who dared to fly'. The moral is listen to your parents, the moral is do not cave to ambition, the moral is caution. It doesn't stick. - fate can see the futures, pasts and presents on a multi-screened television, if Frankenstein's the Modern Prometheus she will create the modern Icarus, drenched in water, the sum of his foolishness, but burning bright nonetheless - The Greeks keep Icarus in the minds of the people and fate gives the soul a rest, holds it back from the vault of whatever heaven it might find, lets it sleep. When pharaohs call themselves the stars and a god emerges in whispers that speak of a power to snuff out the sun, of human prophets bringing down the most ancient of regimes (man cannot fly, man cannot fly, man cannot) she releases the soul. Nineteen and he kills a man, takes the whip and reverses its power, the slave prays to the new god for forgiveness - the new god replies in the slave's own voice, says 'you do my work and free yourself, do my work still and free your brothers.' Now, now, fate says to herself, you didn't think Moses was the first, did you? The history books are for the winners, Moses triumphed afterall, it is written in Icarus' blood that he can never, never, win. The slave raises his voice above the crowd, says: 'we are all equal why do you enslave us? can we not stand in the sun?' and a voice, a voice with a knife at the slave's throat says 'no, child, you will get burnt.' The second Icarus dies in the sands of Egypt, a new god on his lips and eyes glazed, he faces the sun, he could not reach it. - Slavery, it seems, puts the notion of hope in hearts like nothing other. (later fate will laugh, 'what we do in life, echoes in eternity' and she watches her work again, spots differences) When he opens his eyes he's a slave again, just as he was yesterday, tells himself to stop believing in the dreams that tell him he can fly. He is a man without a name, with a mind too focused on the universe to give himself one. God created the universe, the new religion says, and god has no name but god, so he may have no name too, just the number they paint on his skin and the broken armour they throw and call his. He hears the lions roar, the screams of men on crosses being torn at, the jeers and shouts of the crowd. When he lies on the floor, blood filling his throat, his mouth and he's drowning and it hurts and he prays, he can remember. He remembers the soldier, a man with dark hair and dark eyes, who told him to die with grace, that it was not worth it to repeat his claims that martyrdom brings him closer to god, tells him to fight the lions, to fight his fellow men and maybe he'll live. But the light glinted in the gold laurel crown and pride flooded deep in his veins, he had stood in the center of that great building, the sun in his eyes, sand at his feet, and held the broken sword up high. He hadn't the chance to speak, the words bubble uselessly around the arrow that pierces his neck. The dark haired soldier looks at him, crossbow at his side, and there's pity in those black eyes. Sand burns his skin, blazed from the sun, blood drowns him like water. the lesson goes unlearned again and the sea, the sea does not weep for Icarus - In Byzantium, fate allows her icarus to preach destruction, to enjoy perfecting and shaping Greek Fire, liquid fire, ugron pur, to allow the Byzantines a defence against their enemies, against the heathens marching on them. In Byzantium her Icarus burns himself to death. - She names him Leonardo, makes him a bastard and a genius, makes him proud and stubborn. Intellect that soars above without the aid of wax and feather wings; she gives him an obsession with flight. His heart hangs heavy with the burden of his mind, the fact that war, always the handmaiden of progress, is to be his key to a greater living, a greater audience, stains the back of his eyes with blood that he can't get out. He is a motherless son, he is weighed down by his own blood. As he designs canons, mechanical war-machines, metal birds with wings attainable for humanity soar over his head. As he fights religion with logic, dark shadows crawl ever closer. fate will not love this bastard boy The sea is at his heels in Florence, he follows it to Rome, it follows him back and forth. He searches for knowledge, led by a Turk, a Mithraic Mystery, is an initiate. The sea is a man, too, with the dark hair and eyes of the soldier in Rome and what happens next is not fate's doing - her creation gains the will to deviate. Fate stills her hand and waits. They touch first in a lopsided anger, his displeasure ripples under a black, black gaze. They touch second in a burning, fiery, destructive clash of wills and morals and teeth. They touch next in anger turned on its head, a war where the victory is pyrrhic, the loss is control. With hands roaming, and skin bitten, bruised, and worshipped, they remember. A part of her, the part that is kind to children who fall and scrape their knees, the part that shows them that their fate is to not repeat, decides that it must be harder for the sea to remember its lives than for her icarus. She sees the sea, the man, his name Riario, she sees him falter, sees him trace the arc of invisible ghost arrows through the sky to Leonardo's neck, sees him watch and feel the other drowning in him, sees him pull the knife back from the edge. Her Icarus blinks back tears, blinks back betrayal from his own eyes, looks at the sea like a man dying of thirst and nods, says, \"this is the way it is meant to be,\" and the sea, Riario, shakes his head, \"no.\" The sea cries out for Icarus, Riario curses Leonardo, and is this not the same thing? fate lets them play out their deviation, lets icarus live and the sea die, stabbed, apart, and thinks that maybe this is justice, her old friend, that as they loved they lost - They keep remembering and so fate installs a backup plan, a catch, that when they love and remember, even then, they still will play their roles. They keep the names, Leo and Riario, the latter a name passed down to every incarnation of the sea, fate doesn't pretend to understand the universe's ways of fighting back at her, she won't allow that she's playing games above her role. - At the arret de Merindol his voice is the loudest and he speaks of such things, such great mysteries, such change, portents of the future, of longer lives, of flying men. They call him the lion of progress from within their safe walls, and the sea listens, watches this boy grow in the presence of a stifling faith. The Catholics send Riario first, the needles to pierce the skin of Merindol, the poison to flow through their veins. He writes letters, coded, whenever he can, ration levels, plans of defence, and one day the lion finds him. With a sword at his throat the sea begs and does not remember, with a sword at his throat the sea calculates a way to tip the balance, to have the sword himself. Leonardo of Icaria, a title he keeps to himself, stays his blade and pulls the man, his downfall, up, says, \"is this your God's will? to lie and steal and murder innocents in sanctuary?\" Riario stands tall, looks into his eyes and says, \"is it yours?\" he grabs the blade \"is your voice, so loud, the voice of God?\" breaks skin \"does your heresy know no bounds even within your religion of rebels?\" It's a baptism of blood and Merindol falls. Icarus lies dead again, surrounded by ambition and failed ideas. this is the last time they live lives apart from who they are - fate skips centuries, allows her tortured souls a rest and throws them back to a world that lives on a phrase for a faction: vive la revolution, vs the old ways are the best They meet in England, because it is safe for both of them, because what they are is not known and while Leo weaves his words around enlightenment, Riario smirks in corners devoid of light, and smokes, makes shapes of guns and swords. They fuck because they're foreigners in London and because the tides are turning, they fuck because they live in a changing world and because they can. (They remember and wish they hadn't) \"Who are you this time, then,\" he whispers, \"to bring me down?\" Riario shows his royalist colours, bares his teeth, saying nothing. They leave each other and cross the sea at different points, raise their voices for their separate causes on days apart. In the storming of the Bastille the boy Icarus dies, shot through the neck, drowns again and he should have seen this but the example cannot learn from itself. Riario shakes himself, tells himself that this was duty, that this was fate. Fate doesn't smile this day. - At the Battle of Charleroi the French sit and stand and fight and die together. For freedom, for the people, for the world and Icarus, and Leonardo, makes no discoveries, has only the pride of military man happy in his skill. His weapons are nothing against theirs and oh, okay then, in this time they never meet. Faceless men behind and infront of a gun. Fate hangs her head, they fight for the wrong reasons. - Avoiding wars they find depression in America, fate stands on the sidelines and pushes. She breathes the words that Leonardo speaks. It's a family on family thing and Leo wants it over (the icarus here is that, he wants peace, and that's above human comprehension here), she sees the Romeo and Juliet before it happens. She lets them have a month, because they deserve it, because they need it, before they remember. On the bridge their voice mingle in the wind, disguises crumble but no one sees it, his hands white knuckled gripping bars of safety; he is on the wrong side. \"Who says you'll kill me, man?\" shouts Leo, \"precedents and rules are made to be broken, challenged, don't do this.\" Fate thinks that she often underestimates people, she knows it when the lug wrench clatters on the floor, and the blood starts dripping. When Riario curls up next to the body, when sobs tear through him and he apologises over and over and over, and he tries to breathe life back into dead lungs, to take his actions back, fate does not cry. She does not mourn. (but she does) - They are spies in World War II, or at least her icarus is, an Englishman in France (fate will smile on Tarantino, but she will not forget the truth). His game is seduction outright, this time, he weaves his way into people's hearts, their beds and it doesn't matter what gender they are - it's what they know that matters - and when he sees the dark eyes, dark hair, rich voice and victorious smirk he hopes that this guy's important. The ruthless streak is new. The memories do not flood in, they are gradual, it starts with flecks of light over an ocean, the feel of air whistling through feathers. A drop that feels like a wound, drowning, floating, dying, and he feels it again and again. Capt. Riario sees images of death, his eyes run red with blood, and sand and tears and the world drowns Icarus over and over and he's always there and it hurts. They guide each other through emotional and muscle memory, memories that are so very theirs, a shared history of death and life and sunlight; Leo looks at a blank space on the wall and whispers in English, \"last time you tried to kill yourself,\" takes Riario's hand and holds it, \"we've never really addressed it before.\" And Riario says, \"I -\" \"Don't say it, we both know it's true, but we also know what has to happen, please don't break my heart before you stop it.\" \"I love you,\" Riario doesn't say because Leo is right. (You broke my heart millennia ago, they both do not say. Their stony silence, their resignation, burns at the heart of this.) When the shot comes Leo smiles and looks to the heavens, looks fate in the eye and breathes his last. & He sits on the front step of someone else's house and drinks, because that's what people do when they're alone at parties, when drinking lost it's social meaning when the sun went down. He drinks and drinks and if people on their way out stop and laugh at him he says nothing, stares into middle distance. Were he younger, more full of idle days and easy pleasures, he would draw them, the lovers leaving early bound for homes or for motel rooms; he has no paper with him, no desire to make or even break things. A numbness born of broken dreams seeps through him and he sighs as the hand takes the cup away and sets it down with a small laugh and a, \"no doubt you've heard it all before,\" and Leo turns, asks, \"what?\" \"That you'll kill yourself with drink one day, or that you're wasting your life,\" the other man laughs, continues, \"alcoholism is a leading cause of death or illness you know.\" \"Life,\" says Leo, \"is a leading cause of death or illness,\" and he throws up to the side dimly aware of the hand soothing on the back of his neck and the nothings murmured into the night. \"Are you okay?\" is the question when he's done, a couple of dry heaves and coughs and fuck if he isn't killing himself, he says, \"no,\" and adds, \"most days I don't feel alive.\" The other man frowns, \"Maybe you just need something to live for,\" smiles, says, \"I'm Riario, by the way.\" Leo replies with his name, coughs, says, \"don't you have something better to be doing with your life than sitting on doorsteps with alcoholic losers?\" \"You aren't a loser,\" says Riario, \"and no, not really, I'm a med student.\" Leo groans, not all from the pounding in his head and the pain in his chest, mutters, \"I quit med school,\" after that he can't remember much. He wakes up in a hospital room and it's salt in the wounds, he says nothing to the friends who look at him like they don't know who he is but smile anyway. He sees himself in every harried doctor walking by his window, in very tired looking nurse that tries to talk to him. \"You aren't dying,\" says the voice from what he thinks is last night, and Riario smiles at him from the chair. \"But at this point it quite honestly is stop drinking or die,\" and Leo doesn't say 'you are all I ever wanted to be', opts for a nod and a shrug. The warm fingers that wrap around his surprise him, as do the words that Riario says: \"find a new dream, Leonardo, nothing is worth this.\" He falls asleep to spite him. At home, the box flat paid for out of uni savings, he takes to painting again. Drags dark lines over canvases and screams when nothing looks the way it should. He cannot drink, he spent his last on paints and paper, threw the existing bottles out, he shouts again. There's a shadow in every painting that tells him to find a new dream and fuck you he's trying, can't you see that? This is what drove him to drink in the first place, he's flying so close to perfection that when his fingers graze the sides he falls down hard. He picks himself up from the floor and takes a pencil, carves a face into blank white and starts to paint dark eyes and dark hair and a light in the background like the sun, because this man taunts him. The unattainable heart of what could easily be, he fails - but starts again. Leo brings someone new home every night and they're never who he wants, that figure skirting his memory and his paintings. The people, men or women, share dark hair and brown eyes, he can't get those eyes right, though. It's never the same. When he finds Riario again, at a party with (of all things) a bottle of coke in his hand and Leo hasn't had a proper drink in weeks, he's proud, he takes him home. \"I know you,\" Leo says, and Riario laughs, says, \"of course you do,\" and kisses him softly, deeply and the stars Leo sees are memories of how it felt to fly, to be on top of the world, to know things other didn't, the pain is locked and bolted deep within. He breaks the kiss, rests his head on Riario's shoulder, \"this time was different,\" he says, \"I think i knew from the beginning.\" \"This time it won't end the same way,\" and it's a promise, a prayer and a hymn all in one and Leo laughs, says, \"no, it won't.\" somewhere fate closes a book, puts down a pen, stops thinking about them. They die together, at the last, and it's good because it's them and it's completely unrelated to any death they've had before. That's the happiest ending we can have, really, isn't it? fin",

    "text": "Athena has a ship. Athena has a ship, no crew, a broken navigational system, and a metric tonne of survivor guilt, but the main point is the ship. It is small, as ships go, a central bridge with several cabins and a mostly-non-functional kitchen. If she had a crew she knows it would be pretty cramped, but it is perfectly sufficient for one displaced Pantheon deity. Especially considering the fact that she's mostly non-corporeal these days. The Arcadia is actually her pride and joy, not that she'll admit it. She's never been one for material possessions, but slumbering for a millennia and waking in an entirely new world can change a goddess. The world into which she emerged is too changed to be recognizable; ships in the sky, scars on the planet, poison in the seas. Humans have burst through the galaxy like insects and no one knows her name, never mind worships her. She had called to Zeus immediately upon waking. He did not answer. She took a walk through his old domain, her feet back-treading through Olympus as if she had never left, but it was entirely deserted. She called for Apollo, for Artemis, but they were beyond hearing. She searched for Hephaestus, for Hades even, but they too had disappeared. They had all passed beyond her reach, dispersed throughout humanity's new empire, lost to the dredges of space. Athena was unsure why she alone remained with Earth. She nursed her loneliness for a while in Olympus, her eyes on Athens as though an Olympic hero would come strolling forwards and demand a quest for eternal glory. No one came. Athena was alone. Her Godly powers no longer worked, her mind was closed and empty, for what good is a Goddess of Wisdom if there is no one to believe in her? She got The Arcadia after three months in which she came to learn that, first: the Earth was entirely forsaken of any of the Old Religions, and second: space was where the action was. If Zeus and the others were anywhere, it would be out there. The ship cost her an armful of gold and riches that she gathered up from Olympus. She sits at the bridge sometimes and lets her hands wander, pressing lightly over buttons. She likes the cheerful way in which they light up green and yellow under her divine touch. She likes the responsive bleeping of the comms system, the way the polytonal chimes echo around her empty ship. She likes the solitude, mostly. She had the updated computer system installed on the New Alexandria space-station, just fifteen clicks north-west of the dog-star. She paid a young man in Olympic riches to barter with the electronics and fix the system up so that The Arcadia's artificial intelligence has a voice. She named him Orpheus, for old time's sake. \"My lady,\" says Orpheus now, his dual-sound voice clicking on over the communicator. \"Yes?\" \"We're coming up on the planet Argos, do you wish to dock?\" She takes this with a grain of salt if the ship's bungled nav system is anything to go by. She lowers the shields and takes a look outside and, sure enough, she can see the blueish brown surface of Argos roiling in smoke below her. It sits in a rare pocket of balanced atmosphere, perfect for humanity and also not too far from any of the major spaceports. The planet is surrounded by dark clouds that promise a breathable atmosphere and, later on, rain. \"Yes, Orpheus, we'll dock here.\" \"Very well.\" She likes that about him: he doesn't question her. He is happy to stick to the plan, even if the plan is half-hatched and doesn't really involve much beyond docking at the best-looking planet in the dim hope of finding a half decent crew. She is thankful for Orpheus's loyalty. \"I'm thankful for your loyalty, Orpheus,\" she tells him, because she really doesn't say it enough. There is silence for a few moments, until the polytonal comm system clicks on again. \"Thank you m'lady but, with all due respect, I'm planning on abandoning you for the first powerful cargo ship I see.\" It's hard enough to tell when he is joking, but she catches his voice go up a few semitones with humor. She taps the large, sleek speaker above her navigation seat that functions as his primary interface. \"Good luck with that.\" He falls silent as he concentrates his power on preparing the ship for docking. Athena opts to leave the shields up so that she can watch the planet grow closer, and is so lost in the awe of this simple thing that she almost misses her docking request when it comes through on the comms. \"Arcadia this is Argos Central Command, do you read?\" \"Yes!\" She brings her hand down a little too hard on the outgoing comms button, and swears she hears Orpheus sigh in disapproval. \"This is The Arcadia, reading you loud and clear.\" \"Arcadia, what is your business here?\" The voice on the other end sounds cheerful enough, but Athena knows how overworked they are at Central Commands on the big planets. She does not envy him his job. Argos is a black hole for tourists and business-folk alike. \"I'm in the market for a few crew-members, and I figured Argos was a great place to start.\" She doesn't tell him how Argos is actually the eighth planet she's trawled for volunteers in as many weeks. \"Requesting permission to dock?\" \"You're right about that ma'am. Good luck on your journey. Docking request granted.\" \"Thank you.\" She turns to her visual interface screen and watches as a message rolls up from the bottom, in tiny green lettering: Stardate: 13063345, location Argos Central Command, Poseidon Galaxy, PERMISSION GRANTED. Duration of stay: 24 hours MAXIMUM. Penalty fees will apply if you exceed this duration. Use of weapons and teleportation devices is prohibited on Argos. Have a nice day. When she is on-planet, Athena often assumes the guise of her preferred human form, a woman of tall stature and regal aura, red curly hair, divine eyes, beautiful clothes in a similar style to the ones she wore on Olympus. She is respectful of the fact that humanity has come a long way since those days, and is aware of the fact that many people will think her weird or backwards, but this does not bother her. The majority of lifeforms on Argos are human, but she is not too concerned. She doesn't have to worry about them recognizing her, at any rate. Stepping out of Central Command, she is greeted by a dusty marketplace that smells strongly of spilt wine and old food. The place is mostly deserted in favor of the rainclouds that lurk above, and she feels the wind pick up and whip her hair into her face. The whole thing kind of reminds her of Mycenae before humanity really got started on industry and agriculture, and it is with a heavy sense of nostalgia in her stomach that Athena walks through the market. The ground crunches beneath her feet and she wants to slip her sandals off and take a walk barefoot, but she knows that kind of behavior isn't befitting of a goddess, never mind a visitor to a strange planet. Her clothes are still bedraggled from the requisite body search at Central Command, and she doesn't really have the opportunity to fix them what with the buffeting winds, and so it is in this half-undone state that she finds herself face to face, quite literally, with her first Argos native. \"Hey,\" says the girl, knocking directly into Athena's front, \"Watch yourself.\" Athena remembers a time when no human would speak to her like that. Or, in Odysseus' case, they would at least ask permission first. She laughs fondly and reaches out to steady the girl. She is young, perhaps too young to be out alone this close to Central Command, and has dark hair down to her waist. She is beautiful, in the kind of old fashioned sense that Athena hasn't seen since the Old Days. She wears a simple white dress and is shockingly barefoot. She has the damndest expression on her face; anger and annoyance and a deep-set sadness in her blue eyes. She flinches at Athena's touch, pushing backwards. \"Hey, if you're going to rob me-\" And she looks up to glare into Athena's eyes, and it is this that stops her. She falls silent. Her mouth drops open. Athena starts to ask if she is ok, but then the girl drops to her knees. \"My goddess, forgive me.\" She says this with her head bowed. It is a sight that Athena hasn't seen in so long that her first thought is concern for the girl, and not recognition of a supplicant. Oh. \"You... know who I am?\" \"Of course, my lady. You are wise and magnificent, and I worried that you were long-since gone from this world like your kin, yet here you are. I saw the signs and I refused to believe.\" The girl presses her chin into her chest, admonishing herself. Athena thinks she is crying, and wishes the girl would meet her eyes. \"I forgive you. Look at me now.\" The girl obeys. Her tears are unwiped and she looks angry. She balls her hands into fists by her side. \"I am sorry my goddess. I ought to have believed you would come, but I ignored the signs.\" Above them the clouds crack, and Athena knows it will not be too long before the rain starts. \"How could you have known I would come? I have been gone for many years; I am surprised you recognize me.\" The girl frowns. \"How could I not? You are my goddess. I have always known you. Years are nothing compared to that. Inside my head I see a thousand different pictures, I hear a thousand different stories, but there is always you weaving them together. You are Athena, and my mind makes sense now.\" Athena is not quite sure what to make of this. All this time she has been searching for some remnant of the Old Days and now that she has found it she isn't sure whether to be grateful or confused. \"You have always known me? But, you can't be more than a maiden. A teenager, maybe?\" \"Yes. I'll be fifteen come Midwinter. But that's not important - I see you inside my head, I hear you, and so I've known you all my life. I recognized you, didn't I?\" Athena gets a weird feeling in her stomach, like maybe her reminiscing for the Old Days wasn't entirely in vain after all. \"What is your name, child?\" \"Cassandra.\" Athena starts thinking maybe the Old Days aren't lost after all.",

      "Athena has a ship.",
      "Athena has a ship, no crew, a broken navigational system, and a metric tonne of survivor guilt, but the main point is the ship.",
      "It is small, as ships go, a central bridge with several cabins and a mostly-non-functional kitchen.",
      "If she had a crew she knows it would be pretty cramped, but it is perfectly sufficient for one displaced Pantheon deity.",
      "Especially considering the fact that she's mostly non-corporeal these days.",
      "The Arcadia is actually her pride and joy, not that she'll admit it.",
      "She's never been one for material possessions, but slumbering for a millennia and waking in an entirely new world can change a goddess.",

      "Athena was alone.",
      "Her Godly powers no longer worked, her mind was closed and empty, for what good is a Goddess of Wisdom if there is no one to believe in her?",

      "The planet is surrounded by dark clouds that promise a breathable atmosphere and, later on, rain.",

      "\"Very well.\"",
      "She likes that about him: he doesn't question her.",
      "He is happy to stick to the plan, even if the plan is half-hatched and doesn't really involve much beyond docking at the best-looking planet in the dim hope of finding a half decent crew.",

      "She taps the large, sleek speaker above her navigation seat that functions as his primary interface.",
      "\"Good luck with that.\"",
      "He falls silent as he concentrates his power on preparing the ship for docking.",

      "\"Yes!\"",
      "She brings her hand down a little too hard on the outgoing comms button, and swears she hears Orpheus sigh in disapproval.",

      "\"Arcadia, what is your business here?\"",
      "The voice on the other end sounds cheerful enough, but Athena knows how overworked they are at Central Commands on the big planets.",
      "She does not envy him his job.",
      "Argos is a black hole for tourists and business-folk alike.",

      "She is respectful of the fact that humanity has come a long way since those days, and is aware of the fact that many people will think her weird or backwards, but this does not bother her.",
      "The majority of lifeforms on Argos are human, but she is not too concerned.",
      "She doesn't have to worry about them recognizing her, at any rate.",
      "Stepping out of Central Command, she is greeted by a dusty marketplace that smells strongly of spilt wine and old food.",
      "The place is mostly deserted in favor of the rainclouds that lurk above, and she feels the wind pick up and whip her hair into her face.",
      "The whole thing kind of reminds her of Mycenae before humanity really got started on industry and agriculture, and it is with a heavy sense of nostalgia in her stomach that Athena walks through the market.",
      "The ground crunches beneath her feet and she wants to slip her sandals off and take a walk barefoot, but she knows that kind of behavior isn't befitting of a goddess, never mind a visitor to a strange planet.",
      "Her clothes are still bedraggled from the requisite body search at Central Command, and she doesn't really have the opportunity to fix them what with the buffeting winds, and so it is in this half-undone state that she finds herself face to face, quite literally, with her first Argos native.",
      "\"Hey,\" says the girl, knocking directly into Athena's front, \"Watch yourself.\"",

    "text": "\"Conditions are certainly favourable,\" Gaius said, hesitant now the the day was finally here. Merlin was near bouncing with excitement, despite the long climb pulling the small handcart which held the crate containing Gauis's latest invention. His face was flushed and a sheen of sweat covered his skin but his eyes were eager and he was not going to allow the old man to back out now. \"Come on,\" he whined, tugging his sleeve until Gaius gave in and followed him back to the cart. He untied the bindings and opened the crate, admiring the way the iridescent feathers shone in the bright sunlight. Until now he had only seen them in the dim light of the workshop and his breath caught in his throat at the sight. Gently he removed the two pairs of shining wings and lay them carefully on the ground. First he helped Gaius into his set, tightening the leather straps and testing cables and levers. Then, hands trembling with anticipation, he fitted himself into his own set of wings. Wings. He was going to fly, soar and swoop like the bird his mother had called him after. His heart pounded, pumping adrenaline through his veins, making him dizzy. Gaius still seemed worried, his eyebrow arched critically as he examined Merlin's fittings. \"Flex,\" he instructed, humming to himself when Merlin stretched his arms and flexed his wings. It was all perfect but he still fussed and tutted over the straps and pulleys as he made Merlin stretch and bend, twisting this way and that, going through the movements they had practised. Eventually Merlin batted his hands away, laughing. \"It's fine Gaius, don't be such a fusspot.\" \"We don't have to do this now, my boy,\" he said gravely, \"Perhaps a few small adjustments...\" Merlin danced out of his reach, still laughing, and because he couldn't stand any more waiting and talking when he could be flying, he ran straight to the cliff's edge and jumped. For a few moments he just fell before remembering his lessons and opening his wings. His descent slowed and then reversed and at last he was flying, lifting his body with the beat of his strong arms. He let out a whoop of joy, delighting in the feel of the fresh sea air on his sweat-damp skin. When he saw that Gaius had followed his leap he flapped towards him laughing and shouting in glee. Together they wheeled and soared revelling in the feeling of freedom and accomplishment. But Gaius was not a young man and soon tired, allowing himself to drift lower and lower, finally settling down on the beach at the foot of the cliff. Merlin though couldn't bear to give up that feeling yet and flew further out to sea, climbing higher amongst the squawking gulls, turning circles in the air. So high he climbed that the shore became a distant line and his invisible mentor's warnings faded from his thoughts. All he could think of was the sensations of leaving the world behind, entering this magical realm where he was one with the air. Around him puffs of white cloud drifted, scurrying from the powerful beat of his wings when he came close, breaking apart as he passed them. Looking up he could see the golden chariot of the sun, bearing the god of light on his daily journey across the sky, his four great horses snorting and straining. Merlin flew towards the warmth, the sweat evaporating from his skin as fast as he shed it. Now that he could see the occupant of the flaming chariot he struggled harder to draw nearer, though his shoulders burned with the effort and his skin tingled in the heat. Seated in the chariot was the most beautiful man Merlin had ever seen, he seemed to be entirely made from palest gold except for his eyes of deep blue and his red lips, pursed in an arrogant pout. He frowned at Merlin, one perfect lip curling in distaste, as he struggled towards the chariot, everything was pain now, not just his straining muscles and singed skin, but every breath burnt his lungs, his eyes stung, every nerve in his body screamed, all he knew was that he had to get to this man, the source of the fire inside him. Until suddenly he was falling again, he worked his arms but the wings were slipping, flailing ineffectually and gradually breaking apart. The waxy resin which had bound the feathers to the device had melted and they were now useless. He fell, too much in shock to even think about what was happening, the golden chariot receded, it's stallions still galloping through the air, he saw the beautiful man peer over the side at him and all he could feel was the loss of that heat, all he could think was that it was so, so cold. Even when he hit the icy water and was plunged into darkness he couldn't straighten his thoughts enough to try and save himself. He sank, feeling the weight of the water on his ears, on his chest, squeezing the breath out of him, but just before he passed out he thought he saw a light coming towards him, thought he felt warm hands grasp him, and maybe even warm lips breathing life back into his.... When Merlin came to he was laid out on the cliff top from which he had started his adventure. Sitting scowling beside him was the golden man from the chariot. \"Well that was bloody stupid,\" he snarled, \"What the hell were you playing at?\" Merlin sighed happily and curled into the heat, laying his head on the man's lap. It was nice to be back on solid ground he thought, nuzzling into the hand that threaded through his hair, and nice to be warm again.",

    "text": "The first thing Helen of Sparta says to him, emerging apparently out of nowhere in the gardens of King Tyndaerus, is: \"You're in love with my cousin, aren't you?\" Odysseus does not do anything as undignified as jumping in surprise. He is a full-grown man, and a king (or at least he will be, once Father decides to retire to his vineyards), and a raider of cities. He does perhaps...startle a little, though. Consequently the second thing Helen of Sparta says to him is: \"Zeus Thunderer, how you shout!\" Odysseus turns to study her. He knows objectively that she is said to be the most beautiful woman in the world, even if she doesn't make him catch his breath and trip over his tongue the way Penelope does. At the moment, any Greek king would give anything to be in this garden with her, and all Odysseus can think of is that his mother gave birth to a girl-child, five years after he was born. If the child had lived, she would be as old today as Helen is now. \"Shouldn't you be in bed?\" he asks, intending to be kind. He knows, quite well, that her father has a great a fondness for her as any other man; Tyndareus has spoiled her greatly. Helen frowns. \"Shouldn't you be loitering somewhere other than under my cousin's window after dark?\" Odysseus is suddenly very glad the night hides his expression, but not for nothing is he known for his lies. \"It's also quite near your father's chambers,\" he reminds her. \"I was hoping to have a word with him.\" \"That's very good.\" Helen bobs her head enthusiastically. \"I almost believed you.\" She laughs. \"Please don't misunderstand. I really don't mind. In fact I couldn't be happier.\" \"I am honored by your generosity, Princess Helen,\" Odysseus says, not without irony. \"Not like that!\" Helen breaks off, and tries again. \"Penelope is far too wise and prudent to tell you this, but of course she favors your suit--\" \"She does?\" \"Yes! I just said so, didn't I? The problem, though, is my uncle Ikarios. He does not.\" Odysseus, just having returned from yet another failed negotiation from Ikarios of Sparta, is all too aware of this fact. \"Your uncle favors no one and nothing,\" he says bitterly. \"Except my father,\" Helen points out. \"He'll listen to my father.\" Which is not at all a difficult assumption to make, given that Ikarios depends on his older brother's generosity to feed and house himself and his family, but of course Tyndareus doesn't seem overly fond him of either. The Princess of Sparta only grins wider when he explains this. \"If only you could do something for my father in exchange, rid him of his greatest worry--which, at the moment, is my marriage--\" Odysseus can see where this is going. \"--and in return, finagle a way for you to pick the suitor you favor.\" Helen's face grows serious. \"I wouldn't make the decision carelessly, and certainly it would be no one who would make Father unhappy-- but I only need to know that in the end, I had a choice. That's all I want.\" There was a time when Odysseus would have thought a woman wanting a choice was ridiculous, but that time was before he had fallen in love himself. Now the thought of Penelope marrying him against her will, or worse, marrying another with equal reluctance, is repugnant. He would do much to spare the Princess of Sparta such a fate. \"I don't think that would be impossible,\" he tells her, and Helen beams in response. The next time Helen of Troy catches him roaming around after dark, it's equally inopportune. He's dressed in a tunic so grimy he wouldn't have let his dog touch it back home in Ithaka, which serves him well as everyday wear on the battlefield (a sensible choice; Penelope would never forgive him bleeding all over his best clothes). He finds it serves him equally well as a disguise to blend into the increasing numbers of beggars on the streets of Troy, and that is not surprising. There's little to choose between when it comes to beggar and soldier, except the beggar has distinctly better odds of survival. He's about to give his mission up as hopeless and find Diomedes again when a woman's voice behind him says: \"You always were the most interesting of my kinsmen, you know.\" Odysseus, hardened commander of the Achaean forces, does not do anything as callow as jumping in surprise. He stills for an instant, and his fingers move towards the sword concealed at his hip. Behind him, the woman lets out a bark of laughter. Of course, he reminds himself; death would frighten her no longer. He turns to smile at the woman before him, lovely despite the years that weigh so terribly upon her. \"Helen, Princess of Troy,\" he breathes, and reconsiders. \"Or perhaps not 'Princess' any longer. My sincere condolences over the death of Prince Paris.\" Her face is composed and utterly unlike the girl-child he remembers meeting in Tyndareus's gardens so long ago. \"Princess once more,\" Helen tells him. \"My honored father Priam has married me to his son Deiphobus not one week past.\" Odysseus considers this for a moment. \"Clever of him. Little sense going to war for a woman not bound to the house of Troy, even if she is the most beautiful in all the world.\" Helen only shakes her head at the irony clear in his last phrase. \"You too, Odysseus? You at least I would have surely thought above such foolishness.\" He supposes he deserves that. But nevertheless: years have passed, and despite its perfection, all he wants to see in Helen's face is echoes of Penelope's. The color of her eyes has grown confused and inexact in his memory, the curve of her cheekbones and the sharpness of her smile equally obscured. He wants to go home. \"I'm here for the Palladium,\" he says. No reason to mince words, not with Helen. \"Yes, of course you are. Was it Helenus who told you? Clever boy, to trade such a simple thing for his freedom; every man and woman and child in the city learns that Troy will not fall until the Palladium leaves with their first breath, you know.\" \"So I've discovered. And still no one seems to want to share where such a marvel can be found.\" Helen tilts her head to one side, assessing. \"You won't leave until you have it with you, will you?\" \"No,\" he lies. \"Very well, then,\" Helen says. \"I'll tell you.\" Odysseus raises his eyebrows. \"You betray your new home so quickly?\" \"Troy puts its faith in the Palladium. I put mine in the city's real treasure: its people. It's a gamble I'm willing to take to prove myself right.\" She comes closer then and lowers her veil slightly, enough to whisper the secret into his ear. Odysseus repeats every word of her directions to himself until he's sure he knows it by memory, and then, with a mumbled phrase of gratitude, begins to shuffle away. It's almost daybreak; they'll be waiting for him and Diomedes back at the camp. \"Odysseus,\" she says as he goes, once again; but this time, she speaks in a voice so terribly like Penelope's it makes his heart ache, all the more because he's afraid he might have forgotten the sound of his own name on his wife's lips without even having realized it. Despite himself, he turns and looks back. \"She was my cousin,\" Helen says simply, as though it were an apology, and perhaps it is. \"You men have your bards to warn any challengers of your strength and your weapons,\" she goes on. \"I could hardly go into battle without observing the formalities. It wouldn't be right. I would bring no glory to my name.\" There was a time when, dragged from his wife's arms and his son's cradle, he might have directed unjust anger at her, but he has grown all too familiar with desperation these last ten years, and loneliness besides. \"I don't think that would be possible,\" he tells her, and Helen smiles sadly at him. For the first and last time, he can see how a thousand ships could sail for love of her.",

      "He is a full-grown man, and a king (or at least he will be, once Father decides to retire to his vineyards), and a raider of cities.",
      "He does perhaps...startle a little, though.",
      "Consequently the second thing Helen of Sparta says to him is: \"Zeus Thunderer, how you shout!\"",
      "Odysseus turns to study her.",
      "He knows objectively that she is said to be the most beautiful woman in the world, even if she doesn't make him catch his breath and trip over his tongue the way Penelope does.",
      "At the moment, any Greek king would give anything to be in this garden with her, and all Odysseus can think of is that his mother gave birth to a girl-child, five years after he was born.",
      "If the child had lived, she would be as old today as Helen is now.",
      "\"Shouldn't you be in bed?\" he asks, intending to be kind.",
      "He knows, quite well, that her father has a great a fondness for her as any other man; Tyndareus has spoiled her greatly.",
      "Helen frowns.",
      "\"Shouldn't you be loitering somewhere other than under my cousin's window after dark?\" Odysseus is suddenly very glad the night hides his expression, but not for nothing is he known for his lies.",
      "\"It's also quite near your father's chambers,\" he reminds her.",
      "\"I was hoping to have a word with him.\"",
      "\"That's very good.\"",
      "Helen bobs her head enthusiastically.",
      "\"I almost believed you.\"",
      "She laughs.",
      "\"Please don't misunderstand.",
      "I really don't mind.",
      "In fact I couldn't be happier.\"",
      "\"I am honored by your generosity, Princess Helen,\" Odysseus says, not without irony.",
      "\"Not like that!\"",
      "Helen breaks off, and tries again.",
      "\"Penelope is far too wise and prudent to tell you this, but of course she favors your suit--\" \"She does?\"",
      "\"Yes!",
      "I just said so, didn't I?",
      "The problem, though, is my uncle Ikarios.",
      "He does not.\"",
      "Odysseus, just having returned from yet another failed negotiation from Ikarios of Sparta, is all too aware of this fact.",
      "\"Your uncle favors no one and nothing,\" he says bitterly.",
      "\"Except my father,\" Helen points out.",
      "\"He'll listen to my father.\"",
      "Which is not at all a difficult assumption to make, given that Ikarios depends on his older brother's generosity to feed and house himself and his family, but of course Tyndareus doesn't seem overly fond him of either.",
      "The Princess of Sparta only grins wider when he explains this.",
      "\"If only you could do something for my father in exchange, rid him of his greatest worry--which, at the moment, is my marriage--\" Odysseus can see where this is going.",
      "\"--and in return, finagle a way for you to pick the suitor you favor.\"",
      "Helen's face grows serious.",
      "\"I wouldn't make the decision carelessly, and certainly it would be no one who would make Father unhappy-- but I only need to know that in the end, I had a choice.",
      "That's all I want.\"",
      "There was a time when Odysseus would have thought a woman wanting a choice was ridiculous, but that time was before he had fallen in love himself.",
      "Now the thought of Penelope marrying him against her will, or worse, marrying another with equal reluctance, is repugnant.",
      "He would do much to spare the Princess of Sparta such a fate.",
      "\"I don't think that would be impossible,\" he tells her, and Helen beams in response.",
      "The next time Helen of Troy catches him roaming around after dark, it's equally inopportune.",
      "He's dressed in a tunic so grimy he wouldn't have let his dog touch it back home in Ithaka, which serves him well as everyday wear on the battlefield (a sensible choice; Penelope would never forgive him bleeding all over his best clothes).",
      "He finds it serves him equally well as a disguise to blend into the increasing numbers of beggars on the streets of Troy, and that is not surprising.",
      "There's little to choose between when it comes to beggar and soldier, except the beggar has distinctly better odds of survival.",
      "He's about to give his mission up as hopeless and find Diomedes again when a woman's voice behind him says: \"You always were the most interesting of my kinsmen, you know.\"",
      "Odysseus, hardened commander of the Achaean forces, does not do anything as callow as jumping in surprise.",
      "He stills for an instant, and his fingers move towards the sword concealed at his hip.",
      "Behind him, the woman lets out a bark of laughter.",
      "Of course, he reminds himself; death would frighten her no longer.",
      "He turns to smile at the woman before him, lovely despite the years that weigh so terribly upon her.",
      "\"Helen, Princess of Troy,\" he breathes, and reconsiders.",
      "\"Or perhaps not 'Princess' any longer.",
      "My sincere condolences over the death of Prince Paris.\"",
      "Her face is composed and utterly unlike the girl-child he remembers meeting in Tyndareus's gardens so long ago.",
      "\"Princess once more,\" Helen tells him.",
      "\"My honored father Priam has married me to his son Deiphobus not one week past.\"",
      "Odysseus considers this for a moment.",
      "\"Clever of him.",
      "Little sense going to war for a woman not bound to the house of Troy, even if she is the most beautiful in all the world.\"",
      "Helen only shakes her head at the irony clear in his last phrase.",
      "\"You too, Odysseus?",
      "You at least I would have surely thought above such foolishness.\"",
      "He supposes he deserves that.",
      "But nevertheless: years have passed, and despite its perfection, all he wants to see in Helen's face is echoes of Penelope's.",
      "The color of her eyes has grown confused and inexact in his memory, the curve of her cheekbones and the sharpness of her smile equally obscured.",
      "He wants to go home.",
      "\"I'm here for the Palladium,\" he says.",
      "No reason to mince words, not with Helen.",
      "\"Yes, of course you are.",
      "Was it Helenus who told you?",
      "Clever boy, to trade such a simple thing for his freedom; every man and woman and child in the city learns that Troy will not fall until the Palladium leaves with their first breath, you know.\"",
      "\"So I've discovered.",
      "And still no one seems to want to share where such a marvel can be found.\"",
      "Helen tilts her head to one side, assessing.",
      "\"You won't leave until you have it with you, will you?\"",
      "\"No,\" he lies.",
      "\"Very well, then,\" Helen says.",
      "\"I'll tell you.\"",
      "Odysseus raises his eyebrows.",
      "\"You betray your new home so quickly?\"",
      "\"Troy puts its faith in the Palladium.",
      "I put mine in the city's real treasure: its people.",
      "It's a gamble I'm willing to take to prove myself right.\"",
      "She comes closer then and lowers her veil slightly, enough to whisper the secret into his ear.",
      "Odysseus repeats every word of her directions to himself until he's sure he knows it by memory, and then, with a mumbled phrase of gratitude, begins to shuffle away.",
      "It's almost daybreak; they'll be waiting for him and Diomedes back at the camp.",
      "\"Odysseus,\" she says as he goes, once again; but this time, she speaks in a voice so terribly like Penelope's it makes his heart ache, all the more because he's afraid he might have forgotten the sound of his own name on his wife's lips without even having realized it.",
      "Despite himself, he turns and looks back.",
      "\"She was my cousin,\" Helen says simply, as though it were an apology, and perhaps it is.",
      "\"You men have your bards to warn any challengers of your strength and your weapons,\" she goes on.",
      "\"I could hardly go into battle without observing the formalities.",
      "It wouldn't be right.",
      "I would bring no glory to my name.\"",
      "There was a time when, dragged from his wife's arms and his son's cradle, he might have directed unjust anger at her, but he has grown all too familiar with desperation these last ten years, and loneliness besides.",
      "\"I don't think that would be possible,\" he tells her, and Helen smiles sadly at him.",
      "For the first and last time, he can see how a thousand ships could sail for love of her."

    "text": "\"You summoned us?\" Dean looked up from the scroll and over to the door. He'd heard them enter, he'd also heard the rustle of fabric as they'd taken their dresses off. Elisa was plump, both around the middle as well as her chest with green eyes the color of summer grass. Sephera was lithe with barely any chest but a fairly nice ass. Both were brunette, darkened by their time in the Lower Realms with no sun. They'd do for tonight. \"I did. And I see you have already made yourself comfortable.\" Elisa moved forward with a sway to her hips and a coy little smile. \"We thought you would prefer us this way, my Lord.\" \"To match how comfortable you looked, of course.\" Sephera followed Elisa's movements and the two circled around either side of the large bed. Chuckling, Dean put the scroll down and leaned back among the many pillows. His eyes flickered between the two as they crawled onto the bed. \"What if this wasn't want I had called you here for?\" Elisa shook her head as she tugged the blankets down slowly. \"It's late.\" \"There's only one reason you'd call for us together, my Lord.\" Sephera settled on her knees next to him with her hands in her lap. One hand reached out to tease fingertips along Sephera's breast, toying with the nipple, though his eyes stayed on Elisa as she uncovered him, already hard and curved towards his belly. \"How smart you two are. And you two do love playing together.\" He liked how Sephera arched into his touch, playing the good servant as she waited for permission to touch him back. Elisa was bolder, straddling and lowering herself down on him with a moan. \"Love to play with you... my Lord.\" The move was quick, one minute she was sliding down above him and the next Elisa was flat on her back as he thrusted into her to the hilt. \"You take liberties before I give permission,\" he growled darkly as his hand settled around Elisa's throat. \"I thought... you would like...that, my Lord...\" Elisa panted, body arched to take him as her legs settled around his waist. Sephera sat, head turned to watch but unmoving without permission. \"She is a bold little thing, my Lord.\" Hand tightening around Elisa's throat, his own green eyes darkened as he shifted slightly to start a fast, hard pace. \"That she is.\" He ignored the pain that laced the pleasure of Elisa's cries as he pounded into her. \"And she should be punished for it. Should she not, Sephera?\" One of Elisa's hands wrapped around Dean's hand as the other tangled in the sheets as she could, unable to do anything but try to keep pace with him as she cried out with every downstroke into her. \"M...My Lord...?\" \"Yes, my Lord.\" Sephera moved a little to see better. \"She should be punished.\" The only sounds after that affirmation were the cries from Elisa and the slap of flesh as Dean pushed harder and faster. He wasn't going to tell either woman what he planned, though it was clear enough when Elisa's body started to quiver around him and her sounds told him she was close. He slipped out of her in one smooth motion and slapped his palm against her pussy, making her cry out with a jerk. \"Please,\" Elisa begged as her hips rocked in a desperate plea for attention. Dean moved to kiss Sephera deeply, smiling as she moaned and melted under him. \"You're going to watch Sephera here get the release you so desperately want. And if you're good, maybe I'll bring you too.\" Laying back when Dean's firm hand guided her next to Elisa, Sephera spread her legs for him as she moaned in anticipation. \"Take what you need, my Lord.\" \"Oh, I plan to.\" Settling between Sephera's legs he entered her in one swift thrust, her soaked pussy taking him easily as both moaned. He took Sephera softer, though his thrusts were faster. The slap of flesh was louder, Sephera's cries all pleasure as she bucked against his body. Elisa's hand dipped down to tease herself with a moan, head turned to watch Dean and Sephera together. There's only a small pause in his movements as Dean leaned over to catch both of Elisa's wrists and then he got them pinned above her head as he continues to thrust into Sephera. \"That is not... being a good girl.\" Shifting a little, Sephera moaned and pushed her hips faster. \"Please....\" Dean pushed faster, harder with a low sound as he leaned on the hands he had pinned. \"Cum. Now.\" The dark tone left no argument, no room to say no as he shifted his hips slightly to hit that spot inside her over and over. Hands gripping Dean's shoulders, Sephera screamed as her body complied and tightened around Dean as her eyes closed tight and her back bowed sharply. Elisa whimpered as her hips rocked, thighs rubbing together. \"M..my Lord please?\" A low sound left Dean's throat as he continued to fuck into Sephera through her orgasm a little before he slowed and let her down, still hard as he slipped out of her. \"You'll have me. As I choose.\" Sephera panted, body still quaking as her head lulled and she watched Elisa. \"so... good...\" Flipped unceremoniously, Elisa gave a gasp when her ass was tugged up. \"I... am yours...\" \"Of course you are.\" Dean's claim said more than a little that they weren't' even close to equal. They were property. To be used and taken as he needed and wanted. There's no warning as he pressed against her ass and in a couple smooth motions filled her completely. His groan nearly covered Elisa's cry of mixed pleasure and pain. \"Get those nimble fingers into her, Sephera.\" Moving slowly, body still quivering a little, she smiled at him. \"Yes, my Lord.\" Sephera slipped her hand under Elisa and pushed two fingers into her, matching Dean's pace as her thumb flicked over Elisa's clit. The keens of pleasure grew as she bucked faster against both invasions, body tightening around Dean as her head fell forward. \"Oh!\" Dean's hand reached to grip Elisa's hair tightly and pull her head back. His thrusts picked up speed, pounding into her body as he finally grew close. \"That's it...\" He could feel Sephera's fingers against him through that thin piece of skin and it only had him push faster and harder, knowing Elisa would be bruised when he was done. She didn't have much air past the sounds she was making, though between the two of them it wasn't long before Elisa bucked and tightened around Dean as she came violently. \"Gods!\" All of those muscles gripping him tightly drew him as well and he gave a couple more thrusts, prolonging her orgasm some, before he came too. Once he'd filled her ass, he let her head go and pulled out of her so he could slump back against the pillows. \"Now clean me up,\" he growled with barely there breath. Sephera was on his cock without much encouragement, though Elisa took a second as she tried to catch her breath. Both women licked and cleaned his cock before settling back, eyes bright and eager for a second round. \"Leave.\" Dean shifted to grab the scroll he had been looking at when they entered. He expected them both to follow his instruction, and Sephera did. Elisa frowned. \"My Lord...\" She didn't get farther than that as he lashed out, hand catching her around the throat with a dangerous sound. \"I said leave. You are a servant, nothing more.\" Reaching, Sephera pulled Elisa to her feet gently and lead her away. Elisa looked like she wanted to say more, but Dean was glad that she held her tongue. He wanted peace now that he'd had what he needed, not argument. Sighing, his eyes settled back on the scroll to continue work.",

    "text": "Molly turns to glare at Irene, when she arrives at the scene. Irene lifts one arched and perfect brow, lips pursed in a moue. \"Don't look at me like that, darling,\" she says in her light purr. \"This is so very much not my fault.\" Molly still glares, her eyebrows knotted fierce and scowling. \"Well, it's certainly not mine,\" she huffs. \"I mean, just look -\" she waves her hand sharply, and a pigeon falls dead at her feet in a puff of grey feathers. Molly immediately looks sick. \"Oh, not now-\" Irene laughs low, and Molly's face falls as though she were about to cry. \"Sorry dears,\" the elderly woman chirps as she comes around the corner. She pauses by the dead bird, bends and puffs a breath at it; the feathers stir. The bird, confused, staggers to its feet. \"Shoo,\" Mrs. Hudson says firmly, and the bird, startled, takes off. It flies crookedly away. Molly looks shame-faced. Irene's lips twitch. \"Mrs. Hudson,\" they say in unison, deferring to the older woman with familiar relief. She steps up beside them, and the three look down at the pavement. There's a long-ish pause. \"Well, what a mess,\" Mrs. Hudson says eventually. Molly nods miserably. \"We'll have to fix it, of course. Can't go leaving this sort of loose end lying about.\" Irene sniffs and pulls a cigarette case out of her minuscule pocketbook. She tapps out a fag, setting the end between her crimson lips. Mrs. Hudson flutters a hand at the resulting smoke and wrinkles her nose. \"Do smoke downwind until it's your turn, dear, we're likely to be here for a while. and you know how I feel about that sort of thing.\" Irene saunters off to lean in a sinuous curve against the grimy hospital wall, making the whole scene noir simply by her presence. Molly eyes her for a moment before turning back to the pavement. Mrs. Hudson gives the younger woman an encouraging nod; she responds with a tremulous smile. Molly fishes a pair of purple latex gloves from her own cavernous bag. It's covered in kittens wearing sweaters playing with yarn. Irene, behind Molly's back, rolls her eyes; without turning, Molly's spine stiffens and her lips thin. Mrs. Hudson sends a narrow look at Irene, who pouts for a moment before yawning with obvious disdain and turning her head to look at the sky. She manages to imbue even that act with a mix of boredom, sarcasm, and sensual lethargy. Molly, freed from critical observation, manages to get the gloves on correctly. Her face scrunches with focus as she kneels on the pavement, reaches out to begin picking up the pieces. She scoops blood gently, her touch sucking it back from where it has seeped into the filthy concrete; her fierce focus pulls it free of the dirt and stains. She presses on broken bone until it settles back to what it remembers it once was. There, a rib in a punctured lung; there, a kneecap in bits under the skin. Her fingers squish the flesh and spin the blood out into thin lines. They dance in the grey air, sparkling ruby lace of veins and arteries as they march back into their old empty heart-halls. Her fingers trace the folds of brain, now disarranged upon the pavement. It wrinkles promisingly under her touch. Although it takes time, the sun does not move. the city is not a city; it is silent. The air is still. One pigeon stumbles about on the roof, cooing in a forlorn panic; it has never been alone before, in all its life. The other pigeons are perfect little statues. They don't reply. At last, it's done; Molly sighs and pets the silky black hair one last time. Unbends her back and creaks to her feet, knees sore from kneeling so long; Mrs. Hudson offering a supporting arm and smile. Molly accepts both, returning the smile with a tired one of her own. It vanishes when Irene flicks her cigarette away (litterbug, Molly's eyes note, so careless of the chaos she leaves in her wake). Her upper lip curls a bit as she steps back and Irene brushes past her to take her place beside the now-whole body. Irene blatantly ignores her. Molly lets Mrs. Hudson draw her back, and they watch. Irene's part is shorter than Molly's, time-wise if there were time to watch. She eyes the body on the ground down the length of her nose, walking a low circle around him with her hands behind her back and her spine straight. Then she bends her knees, lets one hand drop to the pavement for support her as she leans over his chest, lets the other trail over his heart. Down to his stomach. His clothes are all on, buttoned up; there was more physical intimacy in what Molly did, her hands inside him sometimes while she touched all the secret places of the human body, set them to rights. But this, somehow, is less decent, even in public, with the unmoving sun glaring through the clouds overhead. Molly, flushing, looks away. Irene leans over, her eyelids fluttering closed as she whispers into his ear, so close. So soft. Still, you can read those crimson lips. She always says the same thing. \"I've got your measure.\" She stands with ease and strides away smirking. Mrs. Hudson nods and steps forward. Her steps are delicate and purposeful, frail with age but as certain as a dancer's. She looks down at the body with her lips pursed for a long moment. Then she draws her brows together, like a nanny beginning a scold, and says in a firm clear voice: \"Sherlock Holmes, what is the meaning of this? Get up this very instant.\" His eyes open in blind shock. He gasps in a wheezing, desperate breath, and rolls to his side, blindly scrabbling at the pavement and his chest. The world, so frozen, bursts into a sudden riot of motion and noise. Mrs. Hudson steps back, a satisfied smile on her face. Things spring into motion around him, plans he'd laid which nearly fell appart. Blood - not his - from a packet, people rushing forwards. He has the sense to lie still after a moment. It'll all be for nothing if he moves, after all. But his eyes flicker wildly around the scene, searching as long as he dares. Molly flinches slightly behind Mrs. Hudson's form as his gaze sweeps over them. \"I think he saw us,\" she worries. \"Nonsense,\" Mrs. Hudson says practically. \"We're invisible right now, dearie.\" To prove it, she waggles her fingers at Sherlock's form and calls out a chipper \"Yoo-hoo!\" Sherlock physically twitches, even as John shoves his way forwards. Irene gives Mrs. Hudson a disbelieving look. Mrs. Hudson winces, just a little. \"Well. Mostly invisible, to most people, most of the time, when we want to be,\" she corrects. John starts calling out for his friend, his voice rough and broken. Molly makes a pained face. Irene widens her eyes in revulsion, and looks at her watch hurriedly. \"Oh, look at the time, must be off. Call me when we get back to something interesting.\" She strides away rapidly, turning a corner that isn't there and vanishing from sight. Mrs. Hudson sighs, and pats Molly on the arm. \"There, dear, it'll be fine.\" Molly shakes her head. \"She's always so cruel.\" Mrs. Hudson blinks. She replies in a gently chiding tone. \"It's her nature, love. And she can be kind when it suits her.\" Molly, resigned, picks up her purse and tucks her purple gloves into a side pocket absently. She nods to Mrs. Hudson. \"Time for me to be off, too,\" she says regretfully. \"Job to do.\" Mrs. Hudson nods, pats the younger woman's hand once again, and watches her retreat into the hospital. Off to her morgue to receive the living, this time, instead of the dead. With a tut, she heads home herself. She's a lovely new pattern to cut out just waiting on the dining room table. It's full of all sorts of things; heartache, and anger, and lost loves re-united. Delicate thing, those; she's more of an expert on endings, herself. But she does like the ones with fiddly bits.",

    "text": "Mama always told me to stay away from Hayden. She said there was something wrong with him, and that that motorcycle of his was just too damn loud. I can just about hear her now, \"Persephone, don't you go near that boy. He looks like death itself.\" That's the problem. In a town as small as Olympus, you can't help but be interested in things that are different. You get curious. Maybe more than you should. I see him sometimes, driving off somewhere on the back of that bike. Mama's flower patch is right where I can watch the road, and I can see where Mama's warnings come from. He's a dark spot, the kind your eyes are drawn to when you know you shouldn't be looking. Darkness seems to pool around Hayden like a stain. Whenever I see him, he's standing up a little too straight. It looks like he's got an iron rod for a spine, all unyielding. When he speaks in class, the lilt in his voice makes you think he's seen things nobody ever wants to see, things that make his eyes blacken. He's got a point of view. His morals are set in stone, and nobody's gonna move him from his decisions. The earth seems to shake beneath my feet when I'm near him. I pick my flowers and listen to my Mama, but I can't lie and say I don't watch him more than I should. It's just that once you've lived a few days in Olympus, you've lived all the days you'll ever have here. Something forbidden, something you're not supposed to touch, it turns into a temptation. That temptation turns into a need. That need turns into an ache that gnaws at your heart. That gnawing turns me from my contented life of sun-kissed afternoons, and makes me do something I never thought I'd do in all the days in Olympus. Until I do. I see Hayden's bike unattended and can't help but take a closer look. I find myself sitting on it, waiting for him to return. \"Take me with you.\" I say, when he walks up with a questioning look in his eye. He quirks an eyebrow, as if asking why. \"Because I want to live something different, and you're as different as they come in this town. I want to see something besides flowers and gardens and farms. Your voice says you know things you shouldn't, and I only know things I should. I feel almost coddled by the very air we breath, as if there's no escape from the cycle of days that I live. I've chosen you as my way out.\" He stares long and hard at me with stormy river eyes, thinking, appraising. After a lifetime of deliberation he shrugs off his jacket and hands it to me. \"In case you get cold.\" I put the jacket on and let him set his helmet on my head. I hold still while he adjusts the straps, and feel as if I've become invisible to Olympus. I've broken out of the repetition of the town; it's as if it can no longer find me and bring me back. When we begin to ride away, my arms are wrapped tightly around him. The wind whips around me, and I feel as if I've never breathed before this moment. Like my lungs have only been half open. Hayden is strong and immovable beneath my arms. He smells tart like pomegranates. I still remember Mama's warnings, as I sit on the back of the motorcycle owned by the boy who \"looks like death itself\", but I can't bring myself to care.",

    "text": "Icarus He had been young and foolish. After years trapped his desire for freedom had been too great. He was given wings. And he flew. Flew high and fast. The escape was heady. He reached the heavens. Hot wax dripped down his back as the wings disconnected. Then he fell. Harder and faster and freer than flight. He was unable to appreciate it as he stared into the mass of water that would soon be his grave. He closed his eyes as he sped through the sky. He hit the water and felt it close over his body as he drowned. The boy did not even struggle. The sea was too vast to fight. There was nowhere to swim to. His world went black. Calypso She sat at the edge of her island and prison, sighing as she fished in another. She was surprised that she bothered. By now she generally left them to die. Perhaps it was that this one intrigued her. She had seen him fall from the sky, wings slipping from his back. His eyes wide for a few moments, finally closing as he was a foot from the waves. She dragged the body into her mansion, and laid him on the extra bed. A bed which had been used by innumerable other heroes before. Her island seemed like a beacon for heroes lost in ocean. She stared at him, pale skin, and blue eyes. Frail and underfed. She had a few moments to analyze the strange young man before he woke, coughing water out of his lungs. Icarus His eyes opened; he found himself on an island. A tall girl with long black hair stared at him intently. \"Hello, she greeted, \"My name is Calypso. Who are you, hero?\" \"I am called Icarus, but I am no hero. I was kept prison with my father, Daedalus. He was trapped by King Minos for saving Theseus from the Labyrinth. The King stuck us in the impenetrable Labyrinth my father himself had made. But my father was blessed by Athena to build the Labyrinth and she blessed him again so that we could escape it. He created wings so that we could reach freedom. He warned me not to fly so high but I disregarded him and flew too close to the sun. Apollo melted the wax which attached the wings to my back and I fell to the sea. Thank you for saving me. If I could trouble you to lend me boat to return to mainland, I would be in your debt.\" Calypso She gazed into his hopeful face. Wondering how to tell him that he may have merely reached a new trap, \"I have no boat,\" she confessed, \"This island is my prison upon which I am given temptation. Mortal men, until you always heroes, have come and gone during their quests. They are eventually saved from my island by their companions. You will be stuck here until your father comes to save you.\" She wished that they were as tempted by her as she was by them. The heroes brought her companionship but they never stayed. None of them needed her like she needed them. This one would want to leave even more, having just escaped his own confinement. The not-hero, Icarus, had even less reason to stay with her. She doubted immortality would appeal to him if he was still imprisoned. Not after he had been in Thanatos' easy embrace. Icarus Calypso looked at him with heartbreak in her eyes. She expected him to vanish, just as others had. \"Why are you caged?\" \"For my fathers' sins,\" she sneered, \"He was a Titan and the Olympians punish me.\" Then he understood. She, like him, had been trapped by her father's enemies. Unlike him she had no companion. No steady comforter like his father had been, instead she suffered as heroes passed like flighty hummingbirds. \"You don't think I will stay?\" Her eyes dropped, and he thought he saw the sheen of hidden tears, \"The heroes always go.\" \"Then it's a good thing I'm not a hero,\" he smiled as her eyes met his hopefully. Calypso Her breath stuttered in shock at his words. He would stay? With her? In a prison? \"You won't be freed from here by death,\" she warned, \"this island is out of time. You will be immortal.\" \"I don't mind an eternity with you. This cage is beautiful and we have each other for company. We can enjoy it together,\" his words were spoken with happy sincerity and they lightened her heart. An eternity, never alone again.",

    "text": "It goes like this: Stiles is his father's son, the messenger of the Gods with his quick tongue, honeyed and sharp, bringing invitations and refusals and gossip and letters of love and hate to all the corners of Olympus and the world. He flies with the wind, the wings on his heels speeding him away, laughter and shouting and tears fading into silence behind him. He brings the Gods' messages to their heroes, to Danny and Boyd and the rest, brings their stories back to his father's court and spins grand tales of their adventures accompanied by sweeping gestures and exaggerated motions. He brings the usual declarations of war and battle from Chris and his servants, recites his father's challenging responses back to the God of the Sea with a wicked smirk and doesn't quite manage to school his expression to innocence. He breathes in air and breathes out words, sarcasm and humour and pithy wit falling from his lips like rain from the clouds and never quite stops talking, even when his mouth is no longer moving, but never quite says anything, either. He knows everything before it happens, lovers' secret trysts and enemies' secret plans and a thousand mundane details about a thousand other people, their words pouring from him in a flood. In quiet moments, Stiles sits in high places by himself, above the clouds where the sound of the world is but a faint rumble, and wonders what it would be like to have messages of his own to send. - - - - - There has been a battle and the ground has been made black and dead by blood and fire and the trampling of hundreds of feet. Melissa strides across wide fields, eyes bright and angry, seeds falling like dust from her fingers and she tries to repair the damage that has been done. She pays Lydia no mind. Lydia prefers it that way. Melissa took Lydia from her home when she was but a baby, her parents vanished or dead somewhere and little baby Lydia left all alone to cry, forgotten in the yard. Melissa heard her cries and came, taking her for her own, as her own daughter, and as such Lydia has lived ever since, blessed as any other of her kind, considered half a Goddess even though Melissa never gave birth to her herself. For that, if little else, Lydia calls her Mother, and does as she asks. Lydia crouches low, inspecting a thin, trailing vine still clinging stubbornly to the fence post it had grown against. The vine is brittle, it's stalk gone hollow and thin without water, and it's leaves are crumpled and dry and dead. Lydia traces it carefully, gently, with one finger, shivering at the way the leaves rustle and whisper in the breeze. Up ahead, Melissa clenches her fists and throws dirty looks at the sky, knowing better than to call on the messenger of the Gods to bring a strongly-worded message to his father, but clearly wanting to do so anyway. Lydia turns her eyes back to the vine, the small, brown skeleton of a plant, and wonders that her mother does not find it beautiful in the least. - - - - - The God is ignoring everyone and everyone ignores him in return, so Stiles takes advantage of the moment to trace his eyes across broad shoulders and down to the God's trim waist, lets his gaze slide down the length of his strong thighs. When his eyes bounce back up again, the God's hands catch his attention, strong, thick fingers and knuckles worn red by labour (and possibly by something more). Then the God twitches, just a slight movement, a shift of his muscles, but it's enough to make Stiles look back up to his face. The God is looking at him aside, a red flash in his eyes like fresh blood, and Stiles feels his breath catch in his throat, awareness and recognition bursting at the back of his mind. Derek, the God of War, looks back at him, the hard line of his face unchanging, but the red is gone now and Stiles can't look away. He thinks Derek's eyes might be green. - - - - - It makes her eyes hurt, everything sharp and over-bright. She takes her shelter under the shade of a tree, old and creaking and dead in the centre, and wonders how her mother can stand it all the time, the quiet, insistent cacophony of growing things, clamouring for water and for light and for air, each a little more particular than the last, each a little more demanding. Melissa's back is bent, hands stained brown with dirt, her knuckles cracked and dry. Lydia's hands are pale and soft, her fingers slender. They are not hands that long to dig in the dirt and soil, or tangle in the curls of flowers and vines, or trail through the long, whispering stalks of wheat and grain. Lydia's hands are made for marble and stone, for smooth, polished metal and the cool rush of water. There is a hollow in the base of the tree she rests against, a small burrow, perhaps, or a place where the roots have lifted the ground. Or perhaps, Lydia thinks, a portal beneath the earth, full of soft black dirt and water running in endless channels, and soft white flowers like the moon. Lydia sits in the shadow of the tree and hums as a thought begins to form in the back of her mind. - - - - - Kate talks about flowers and wine, beauty and sumptuousness and gluttony, talks about the red haze of desire making the all the world a sea of pleasure. It sounds hollow and insincere to Stiles, too full of smoke and dust like the potions and powders Morrell uses. He can't imagine ever trying to speak to someone like that. Everything about Kate feels heavy to him, the sinuous curves of her as she stands slowly, gracefully, from her pillowed couch. The walls of her rooms are draped in rich, heavy fabrics, the curtains on the windows sheer and whispery when the breezes blow through them. Kate's tunic is the same, draping low from her shoulders and trailing behind her, sliding between her legs as she walks. She lays a hand on Stiles' shoulder, her light grip too warm. He can feel the heat of her fingers through his tunic like a brand. To other men, perhaps, Kate's touch feels like desire and warmth and the hot rush of pleasure. To Stiles, it just feels like fire, burning and dangerous. Kate leans in close to whisper in his ear, and Stiles feels himself shudder at her breath across his cheek. \"I have my sights on a new lover,\" Kate tells him, smiling wickedly. Stiles hates this about her most of all, the way she speaks like they're friends, like he delivers her messages not out of duty, but because he wants to, because he wants to know. \"I wish you to go to him and tell him of my desire to see him. I have even had something made for him, for us,\" Kate adds, coming to stand behind Stiles so she can turn him, her fingers like five points of fire along his jaw, guiding his gaze to a far corner of her chambers. There, lit only by candles, stands a large bed, the posts of it made with black metal, stark against the slick, red fabric of the bed clothes. It could be beautiful, maybe, but Stiles' eyes are caught by the length of chain wrapped around the posts, already set into loops to be bound around a man's wrists. \"What do you think?\" Kate whispers in Stiles' ear. \"It's perfect, isn't it?\" Stiles swallows, hard, and says nothing. Kate doesn't seem to care. She tightens her grip on his arms, her nails digging marks into his skin. He breath is hot against his cheek. \"I mean to hold him with fire and iron and blood,\" Kate tells him, her voice gone dark and silky. \"After all, how else to take the God of War?\" - - - - - \"To spare the messenger the trip,\" she says, \"and to let them know how serious you are, mother.\" And to allow Lydia a moment alone to speak to Stiles, who would otherwise be called to her mother's side, and whom Lydia has a proposition for. She's in luck; Stiles is perched precariously at the top of the gates that guard Olympus. He looks down at her curiously, but doesn't move until she waves the scroll her mother gave her. \"Come down,\" she tells him, ignoring the way she can't quite make it a request and not an order. Stiles doesn't seem to mind; he slips from his perch, feet landing lightly on the grass in front of her. He smiles, sunny and bright. \"What can I do for you?\" Lydia waves the scroll in her hand again. \"My mother has a message for your father,\" she tells him. \"These stupid battles are destroying her crops.\" Stiles rolls his eyes. \"I'm so glad I never have to be involved other than delivering threats and promises. I swear, they keep coming up with new complaints against each other just so they can keep fighting.\" Lydia arches a brow, resisting the urge to roll her own eyes. \"Sometimes I honestly don't know how anything gets done around here.\" Stiles laughs, head thrown back; it sounds a bit like bells, or like glass. Lydia stares at him. \"I like you,\" he tells her, once he's stopped and is smiling down at her, wide. He extends a hand to her. \"Come with me to deliver this? I'll tell you ridiculous stories about everyone we pass.\" - - - - - Not that he does it all the time, not that he can't keep his mouth shut, because he's never been one for useless babble. But he's always had a way with words, a certain twist of humor, a fleeting touch of sarcasm, a subtle hint of double meanings. It's been his gift since he was born, since long before his father granted him his role on Olympus, since long before he took to his winged heels. Words have always been his domain and his delight. He just hadn't realised how lonely it was to be only the messenger, delivering only other people's words and never his own, or how wonderful it was to be able to tell his own stories and know that someone else was interested in hearing them. Because Lydia is interested, laughs at the stories he tells her about the people around them, the tidbits about their lives. She asks questions, makes comments, goads him into telling her more (not that he needs to encouragement, really). Lydia is fire wrapped in petal-softness, pink lips and copper hair; she is beautiful. Stiles watches her, watches the way she smiles, sharp and lovely, the way she laughs at something he says, head thrown back, exposing the long marble line of her throat. Lydia is all white skin and shining hair on the outside and cold steel and stone underneath. There is a darkness to her when she laughs at his sarcasm, a thin thread of cruelty that burrows into him and twists, not unpleasantly, in his gut. Her eyes, when she looks at him, are dark and dancing, like she's laughing at him in secret behind her grin. Stiles looks at her, smiles back, and feels a shiver spiral down his spine. (When his heart skips, though, it's only because her green eyes remind him of someone else. He's not entirely certainly what to make of that, really.) - - - - - They've long since delivered Melissa's message and now they're sitting in a small side courtyard, watching people come and go from Olympus's main halls. Lydia trails her fingers through the grass, gently, while Stiles lies on his back beside her, tracing images in the clouds above them. He is bouncy, all expressive gestures and talking with his hands, his face contorting wildly as he speaks. But there's a restlessness in him, Lydia thinks, that's not born of boredom or clumsiness. She can see plainly the lithe muscle in his arms, the wide span of his hands, his long fingers. There is a sharpness in his eyes, in the set of his jaw, a hint of mischief in the flash of his teeth when he smiles. He reminds her of a knife, quick and sharp, with wings on his feet that can outrun anyone, and the curve of his grin like cut glass, shining and too-bright. There is wickedness in him, too; she can hear it when he speaks, his comments just shy of cutting, just this side of cruel. His words are layered, everything he says laced with double-meanings and innuendos, making her laugh aloud when passerby seem not to notice his pointed jabs in their direction. He laughs, full and bright in the sun, making his eyes glow like amber. Were her ambitions smaller, Lydia thinks, she might even love him. They are of a kind, so alike in so many ways, and so well-matched. They could do great things, she thinks, could plot and plan and scheme, subtle and misleading, could do anything they wished with no one to stop them. But Lydia has plans, and for all that Stiles is nearly perfect, he is not what she has dreamed of. He is a master of words, the whisper in the dark, the messenger whose word cannot be doubted, but he cannot give her what she wants. Lydia dreams of a throne, dreams of a crown, dreams of being queen. And she will settle for nothing less than that. \"What do you know about the Underworld?\" she asks Stiles, finally, turning to look down at him. Stiles stares, blinking. \"Why do you want to know about the Underworld?\" he asks, a note of incredulity in his voice. Lydia shrugs, casual, and lets herself smile just a little, sharp and wicked the way she's practised in her small mirror at night. \"Because,\" she tells him simply, \"I have plans for it.\" - - - - - Lydia means to marry Peter, means to force him to make her Queen of the Underworld, a Goddess in her own right. Lydia has plans, grand and sweeping and impossible, and she won't tell Stiles all the details, but what she does tell him is more than enough to convince him that she can do it. There's no nervousness or apprehension in her voice, and the way she smirks and hints at greater things tells Stiles that she has a map in her head, a checklist of all the things she needs to do to make her dreams come true. \"I am my mother's daughter,\" she tells him. \"But that is not all that I am, or want, or will be.\" \"Then what will you be?\" Stiles asks, leaning close, conspiratory. \"I am not going to live my life in the fields. I am not going to spend all my time covered in dirt and sweat, tending to plants. I am not going to be Queen of the Earth,\" Lydia tells him, smiling dark and wicked, \"but I will be Queen under it.\" Stiles is silent for a long moment, thinking, ideas whirling through his head almost faster than he can keep up with them. But finally he grins wide, feels it pull sharp at the corners of his mouth, and says, \"Well then, your majesty. Where do we begin?\" - - - - - He's beautiful, of course, all chiselled lines and smooth skin, bright blue eyes and full lips, hip cocked as he leans against the wall and surveys her. His tunic is half-undone, hanging from his hips, and she can still see the agitation in him, the tension in his muscles from whatever had caused him to come storming in like a thundercloud. He prowls over when she invites him, sitting too close, smirking like he thinks he's got the upper hand here; it's sort of adorable, really, especially the look on his face as he realises he's at a loss. \"I want you to shoot someone with one of those arrows of yours,\" she tells him plainly, when he asks. He suggests she go to Kate; she laughs in his face. \"What do I get out of it?\" he asks, finally. Lydia smirks, lets her body go languid and relaxed as she stands. \"You get me.\" She watches the way his eyes go wide and hungry as she opens her robe, lets it drop to the floor. She stands in the middle of the room, naked and unabashed, and watches the God of Love struggle not to touch her. She saunters closer. When she touches him, just a hand to his arm, she already knows that she'll get her arrow. By the time she sinks to her knees before him, she knows he will do anything she commands. - - - - - It's a cage. A fucking cage, black iron bars on three sides and a barred door on the fourth, chain looped around the bars at the top. Stiles stares, horrified, for the long moment it takes before he can school his expression back to neutral. \"Looks comfy,\" he quips, and then he's twisting away, steps a little too quick, anything to get away from Kate. He still feels her eyes following him long after the door has closed behind him. The image of the cage sticks in his mind with every step he takes. He sees it still when he finally reaches Derek's rooms, handing off Kate's note. Their fingers brush, minutely, and Stiles can't help the way he looks up, gaze caught on Derek's features. His mouth is open before he even realises he means to speak. \"Why do you go to her?\" Derek looks up from Kate's note with a bland expression, one eyebrow raised. Even across the room, Stiles can smell the perfume Kate has soaked the parchment in before writing her note to Derek. It hangs heavy in the still air like a cloud; Stiles want to choke. \"Why not?\" Derek says after a moment, like it's an answer, like it's any kind of reason at all, like it's honestly that simple. And hell, Stiles thinks, maybe for him it is. Maybe he doesn't truly care for her. Maybe he doesn't even really lust after her, despite her efforts. Maybe he only goes because he has nothing better to do. Maybe it means nothing to him, just a body wrapped around his and trying not to kill him, for once. Except that Stiles isn't sure, sometimes, that Kate isn't trying to kill Derek, somehow. Except that Kate is not one to let a man come to her only because he has nothing else to do. Except that Stiles has never seen anyone, man or woman, who can resist her pull, the sight and sound and smell of her too much for them to bear to be parted from. And yet Derek seems unaffected. And if he is unaffected by her, then perhaps there is hope that he could be affected by someone else. \"Well,\" Stiles says, bold smile stretching across his face as he turns to go, \"I suppose if you have nothing better to do.\" And then he turns away, still smiling. He feels Derek's gaze hot on his back as he walks away. - - - - - And if Morrell fails to understand that Lydia is giving her only the most basic details, well. That's hardly Lydia's problem. Let the witch believe that she knows what Lydia wants, what she's going to do. Let her believe that she knows anything. Lydia promises Morrell the seed of the God of Death, and smiles when the witch's eyes light up. Who knows what the woman plans of doing with the stuff, but that's hardly Lydia's concern. She just needed something big enough to convince Morrell to enchant the rope to bind the God of Death. \"Each vial of the stuff, after the first, will cost a favour.\" Okay, and maybe Lydia wants a few other things, as well, maybe has some vague ideas brewing in the back of her mind, half-formed plans for her little messenger-bird. After all, Stiles had been so helpful already, offering to help carry anything Lydia needed, information or goods, anything, from Above to Below. It would be awfully remiss of her not to give him something in return. Lydia haggles with Morrell a moment more, but she already knows the witch will cave. Lydia leaves with a length of enchanted rope, a promise of more favors to come, and a building excitement for what will happen next. - - - - - Stiles gapes, eyes wide. \"You're not interested.\" He's standing in Derek's chambers, just inside the door, with his arm still outstretched, Kate's letter trapped in his fingers, frozen with surprise. Derek himself sits across the room on a low chair idly cleaning his sword. He doesn't look up. \"You're not interested in Kate, the Goddess of lust and passion. The Goddess you've been having an affair with for ages now. And just like that, you're going to refuse her.\" Derek glances up, a small smirk lingering at the corner of his mouth when his eyes catch Stiles'. In the low light his green eyes dance like jewels, and Stiles feels his heart stutter wildly in his chest. Derek looks away again, back to his sword, and Stiles feels like he can breathe again. He doesn't know what to say, so he just stands there for a long moment, watching Derek as Derek ignores him. It's something Stiles never even thought to wish for. Just like that, Derek has waved Kate off, dismissed her like she wasn't everything all men are supposed to want. Stiles' mind whirls, implications and wild imaginings chasing themselves across his mind. Because if Derek doesn't want Kate, then what does he want? He doesn't realize he's grinning until his cheeks start to hurt. \"Well then,\" he says, finally, airy and light. \"I guess I'd better go tell her not to waste her time anymore.\" Derek looks up at that, eyes dark and expression unreadable. \"Yeah. Do that.\" Stiles grins again, snaps off a lazy salute, just for the way Derek's brows draw down as he frowns. He turns on his heel and heads for the door. \"Remember,\" he says, pausing with his hand on the latch, \"My father will need you for battle tomorrow.\" Stiles smiles and looks back. \"Shall I come for you when it's time?\" The innuendo slips off his tongue without a second thought. Derek stares at him, brows furrowed as his mouth drops open slightly; his eyes look nearly black, and almost hungry. \"You do that,\" he mutters, and Stiles shivers at the sound of his voice, all gravel and smoke. \"Yes, I think I will,\" Stiles tells him, musingly. And then he's gone, throwing a smirk over his shoulder as he turns, slipping out the door and down the corridor before Derek can say another word. - - - - - Finally, she hears him whistling up the path, something bouncy and light, and underneath the whisper of the feathers at his heels. He all but throws himself onto the ground beside her, smiling widely up at her. \"Hello Lydia, my dear, how are you this lovely day?\" Lydia arches one eyebrow, staring down at him. \"What on earth is going on with you today?\" \"Well,\" Stiles says, picking idly at a strand of grass. \"I may have very, incredibly subtly propositioned the God of War.\" Lydia feels both of her eyebrows shoot up. She stares incredulously. \"I thought you said he was with Kate.\" \"Mmm,\" Stiles hums, smiling. \"He was. Apparently he's not interested anymore.\" \"And you think he might be interested in you?\" Stiles grins up at her, eyes shining, mischief written into every inch of him. \"I think I could persuade him.\" \"Well,\" Lydia says, tilting her face into the sunlight, thinking. \"Then I guess we'd better get started.\" Stiles props himself up on one elbow. \"What do you mean?\" Lydia smiles down at him, \"I mean, Stiles, that I'm going to help you win your God. After all, you're helping me with my capture of Death. Of course I'm going to help you conquer War.\" Stiles levers himself up onto one knee, kneeling beside her as he grasps her hand, bestowing a light kiss across her knuckles. \"And this, Lydia my dear, is why I love you so.\" Lydia laughs, rolling her eyes. \"Tonight then,\" she says, firmly. \"I'll show you everything you need to know.\" \"I promise to be an excellent student,\" Stiles vows, grinning up at her with dark eyes. Lydia eyes the long lines of his fingers, the muscle of his forearms, the perfect bow of his mouth, and smirks down at him. \"Oh, I have no doubt of that.\" - - - - - There is a battle, the Sheriff mustering his men against Chris's, each side doing their level best to flay the other into pieces. The air shudders with the clash of metal and bone, corpses pile up like hills, and the ground runs red and soggy with blood. Stiles perches in the branches of a tree in the distance and watches, eyes trained on one figure in particular. His eyes trace the bunch and flex of muscle, the glisten of sweat on skin, the red burnish of blood across broad knuckles. After, when the battle has finished and the players have disbanded, the losers to tend to their wounds and the victors to celebrate, Stiles makes his way back to Olympus, a shadow flitting through the streets until he reaches his destination. The window is no obstacle and Stiles slips through in silence and stands, leaning against a pillar, and watches. Derek hasn't noticed him, preoccupied with unbuckling his armor and stripping off his filthy clothes. Stiles stares with bated breath as every new inch of the God's skin is revealed. Finally, the God stands in nothing but his loincloth, the dim light casting golden shadows across the broad expanse of his back. There is a bowl on a side table next to a cloth so Derek can can clean himself; he reaches for them, the motion pulling the muscles of his back into sharper relief. Stiles sucks in a quiet breath and opens his mouth. \"Let me help you with that.\" Derek tenses but doesn't turn. He stands still, letting his arm fall back to his side as Stiles comes closer, stepping nearly silent on the stone floor. When he's close enough, he exhales, his breath washing over the back of Derek's neck, goosebumps rising in it's wake. Stiles grins; it's beautiful. He reaches for the cloth, dipping in in the water. He doesn't bother wringing it out, just brings it to Derek's skin, arm wrapped around his chest to swipe at his collarbone. Derek's breath hitches, slightly, enough. Make him wait, Lydia says in his mind. Make him shake a bit before you go on, make it so that he doesn't feel anything but what you give him. Stiles leans closer, hiding his grin at the nape of Derek's neck. He trails the cloth across Derek's skin again, feather-light, delighting in the tiny shivers under the God's skin. Stiles leans in, lips barely grazing Derek's ear. \"I told you I would come,\" Stiles whispers. \"And so will you.\" He's used to victory, he's used to winning. He's used to fighting and coming out on top, Lydia whispers. Derek shudders and turns his head slightly, just enough to catch Stiles' gaze. His eyes are blown black, cheeks flushed. He looks hungry, looks debauched already, and Stiles has barely even begun. Derek doesn't say anything, just turn his head away again and tilts it back, resting against Stiles shoulder. Make it so he gives in. \"Don't touch,\" Stiles whispers. \"Don't turn. Let me do what I want, and I promise you, you will get what you want.\" Derek makes a noise, a low rumble in his throat, and nods, just barely, just enough. Derek is nearly twice his size, could kill him in an instant, could rip him to shreds with his bare hands. But here he is, trembling at under Stiles' fingers, letting him do this. Stiles can feel the rushing in his veins at the sight of Derek like this, still and silent just because Stiles told him to be. Make him surrender to you, and you will have him. \"Let me,\" Stiles says softly, and grins when Derek sighs, tilting his head back, the lines of his body going loose and boneless. \"I've got you.\" - - - - - The portal to the Underworld is hidden at the base of an old tree, gnarled and withered, it's bark gone grey with age. Slipping in is easy, like twisting herself into a mouse's burrow. The earth gives easily beneath her fingers and she descends, dark and rich and black. The wide hole gives way to something like a staircase, rough steps hewn from the earth and winding downwards. Lydia climbs downward for a long time, heedless of the darkness. When light begins to creep towards her, it is pale and greenish, a ghostly sort of light, the light of dark and secret places. When she reaches the bottom of the staircase, Lydia stops for a moment, gazing with wide eyes at the land she's reached. Dark fields stretch out before her, black dirt broken by swaths of pale flowers, glowing white and pearly in the dim light. She can hear the steady rush of the wide rivers, the glint of the waters where the Acheron meets the Cocytus. There is a small dock on the bank, crude but sturdy. A long boat rests there, bobbing gently on the waters, painted black, with a skull for a figurehead. A figure stands beside it on the dock,tall and thin, his aged, weathered face hidden behind the hood of his dark robes. Lydia approaches him, a small smile on her face. \"Stiles has already paid my way,\" she says firmly, staring up at the boatman. The boatman stands for a long moment without moving; then, finally, he turns to her, bowing slightly. \"Your passage is paid,\" he says. His voice is barely more than a whisper, more an echo, drifting like the mist across the fields. \"I will take you to the other side.\" The passage from one side to the other seems to take an eternity, and yet Lydia is still surprised when she sees the far shore come into view at last. The dock on this side is made of stone, and torches burn with white flame on either side. There is a wide stone staircase leading down into the darkness on the other side. Lydia stares at it for a long moment, then straightens her shoulders, shakes out her hair, and begins her climb. The palace, when she reaches it, is barred by gates at every turn. At the first, Lydia pauses, looking around, but there are no gatekeepers, no one to call to to open the way. Lydia pauses a moment, then smiles. She reaches out, placing a hand against the cold black metal. \"I wish to see the God of Death,\" she says, softly. \"Let me pass.\" There is silence for long moments, and then the gate swings silently open on it's own. Lydia smiles again and steps through without looking back. The rest of the gates open for her without a word. She finally meets with another person as she nears the center of the palace, a dark-robed servant who guides her through endless dark stone corridors without a word, until finally they reach an enormous black door. The servant bows, backing away into the shadows. Lydia takes a deep breath, steadying, and pushes the doors open. The hall before her is beautiful, in it's dark, elegant way. There are tapestries against the walls, embroidered scenes of lost souls and souls at rest. The stone pillars are intricately carved, figures like bones or flowers or stalks of reeds along the rivers. And at the far end, seated in a throne of blackest iron, is the God of Death himself. \"Well,\" Peter says, voice soft and light. \"What have we here?\" \"I've come to talk to you about some things,\" Lydia says, slowly approaching the throne. \"There are some things I want, and some things that I could do for you.\" She resists the urge to smirk as she sees the God's gaze sharpen, interest flaring in his dark eyes. \"I thought perhaps we could help each other.\" She smiles at him, all innocence; Stiles had been more than happy to teach her that one. Peter regards her for a long moment before he smiles, charming and dark. \"Of course, my dear,\" he says, standing. \"Perhaps you'd like to dine with me? I do find talking is better done on a full stomach. And it's such a long way to come to get here,\" Peter adds, looking thoughtful. \"I imagine you must be hungry.\" \"Of course,\" Lydia says, doing her best to sound earnest and grateful. Peter shows her to a long table laid with every food she can imagine, and probably some she can't. \"Take anything you like from this table,\" he tells her, sly smile playing on his lips like he thinks she doesn't recognise it for the trap it is. Death never offers anything freely; Death always takes without warning. Good thing she's thought of that. Death cannot take what she's already freely offered. But she can still take from him. She picks up a pomegranate, sliced in half, red fruit against white, juice bleeding dark into her hands, and thinks of Stiles telling her about red blood against pale skin, the way it made his blood sing in his veins, his Godly heart beating faster at the sight of it. Six seeds should be enough, she thinks, and bites. She catches Peter's eyes on her, calculating and victorious. Well, she thinks, Time enough to correct him later. For now, though... For now, Lydia is exactly where she wants to be. \"Tell me, Peter,\" she says, leaning forward. \"Do you play chess?\" The God licks his lips, leaning forward as well. \"Oh my dear,\" he says softly. \"I would love to play with you.\" And, Checkmate, Lydia thinks, and smiles, dark and bright. \"Then let's begin.\"",

      "He is bouncy, all expressive gestures and talking with his hands, his face contorting wildly as he speaks.",
      "But there's a restlessness in him, Lydia thinks, that's not born of boredom or clumsiness.",
      "She can see plainly the lithe muscle in his arms, the wide span of his hands, his long fingers.",
      "There is a sharpness in his eyes, in the set of his jaw, a hint of mischief in the flash of his teeth when he smiles.",
      "He reminds her of a knife, quick and sharp, with wings on his feet that can outrun anyone, and the curve of his grin like cut glass, shining and too-bright.",
      "There is wickedness in him, too; she can hear it when he speaks, his comments just shy of cutting, just this side of cruel.",
      "His words are layered, everything he says laced with double-meanings and innuendos, making her laugh aloud when passerby seem not to notice his pointed jabs in their direction.",
      "He laughs, full and bright in the sun, making his eyes glow like amber.",
      "Were her ambitions smaller, Lydia thinks, she might even love him.",
      "They are of a kind, so alike in so many ways, and so well-matched.",
      "They could do great things, she thinks, could plot and plan and scheme, subtle and misleading, could do anything they wished with no one to stop them.",
      "But Lydia has plans, and for all that Stiles is nearly perfect, he is not what she has dreamed of.",
      "He is a master of words, the whisper in the dark, the messenger whose word cannot be doubted, but he cannot give her what she wants.",
      "Lydia dreams of a throne, dreams of a crown, dreams of being queen.",
      "And she will settle for nothing less than that.",
      "\"What do you know about the Underworld?\" she asks Stiles, finally, turning to look down at him.",
      "Stiles stares, blinking.",
      "\"Why do you want to know about the Underworld?\" he asks, a note of incredulity in his voice.",
      "Lydia shrugs, casual, and lets herself smile just a little, sharp and wicked the way she's practised in her small mirror at night.",
      "\"Because,\" she tells him simply, \"I have plans for it.\"",
      "- - - - - Lydia means to marry Peter, means to force him to make her Queen of the Underworld, a Goddess in her own right.",
      "Lydia has plans, grand and sweeping and impossible, and she won't tell Stiles all the details, but what she does tell him is more than enough to convince him that she can do it.",
      "There's no nervousness or apprehension in her voice, and the way she smirks and hints at greater things tells Stiles that she has a map in her head, a checklist of all the things she needs to do to make her dreams come true.",
      "\"I am my mother's daughter,\" she tells him.",
      "\"But that is not all that I am, or want, or will be.\"",
      "\"Then what will you be?\" Stiles asks, leaning close, conspiratory.",
      "\"I am not going to live my life in the fields.",
      "I am not going to spend all my time covered in dirt and sweat, tending to plants.",
      "I am not going to be Queen of the Earth,\" Lydia tells him, smiling dark and wicked, \"but I will be Queen under it.\"",
      "Stiles is silent for a long moment, thinking, ideas whirling through his head almost faster than he can keep up with them.",
      "But finally he grins wide, feels it pull sharp at the corners of his mouth, and says, \"Well then, your majesty.",
      "Where do we begin?\" - - - - - He's beautiful, of course, all chiselled lines and smooth skin, bright blue eyes and full lips, hip cocked as he leans against the wall and surveys her.",
      "His tunic is half-undone, hanging from his hips, and she can still see the agitation in him, the tension in his muscles from whatever had caused him to come storming in like a thundercloud.",
      "He prowls over when she invites him, sitting too close, smirking like he thinks he's got the upper hand here; it's sort of adorable, really, especially the look on his face as he realises he's at a loss.",
      "\"I want you to shoot someone with one of those arrows of yours,\" she tells him plainly, when he asks.",
      "He suggests she go to Kate; she laughs in his face.",
      "\"What do I get out of it?\" he asks, finally.",
      "Lydia smirks, lets her body go languid and relaxed as she stands.",
      "\"You get me.\"",
      "She watches the way his eyes go wide and hungry as she opens her robe, lets it drop to the floor.",
      "She stands in the middle of the room, naked and unabashed, and watches the God of Love struggle not to touch her.",
      "She saunters closer.",
      "When she touches him, just a hand to his arm, she already knows that she'll get her arrow.",
      "By the time she sinks to her knees before him, she knows he will do anything she commands.",
      "- - - - - It's a cage.",
      "A fucking cage, black iron bars on three sides and a barred door on the fourth, chain looped around the bars at the top.",
      "Stiles stares, horrified, for the long moment it takes before he can school his expression back to neutral.",
      "\"Looks comfy,\" he quips, and then he's twisting away, steps a little too quick, anything to get away from Kate.",
      "He still feels her eyes following him long after the door has closed behind him.",
      "The image of the cage sticks in his mind with every step he takes.",
      "He sees it still when he finally reaches Derek's rooms, handing off Kate's note.",
      "Their fingers brush, minutely, and Stiles can't help the way he looks up, gaze caught on Derek's features.",
      "His mouth is open before he even realises he means to speak.",
      "\"Why do you go to her?\" Derek looks up from Kate's note with a bland expression, one eyebrow raised.",
      "Even across the room, Stiles can smell the perfume Kate has soaked the parchment in before writing her note to Derek.",
      "It hangs heavy in the still air like a cloud; Stiles want to choke.",
      "\"Why not?\" Derek says after a moment, like it's an answer, like it's any kind of reason at all, like it's honestly that simple.",
      "And hell, Stiles thinks, maybe for him it is.",
      "Maybe he doesn't truly care for her.",
      "Maybe he doesn't even really lust after her, despite her efforts.",
      "Maybe he only goes because he has nothing better to do.",
      "Maybe it means nothing to him, just a body wrapped around his and trying not to kill him, for once.",
      "Except that Stiles isn't sure, sometimes, that Kate isn't trying to kill Derek, somehow.",
      "Except that Kate is not one to let a man come to her only because he has nothing else to do.",
      "Except that Stiles has never seen anyone, man or woman, who can resist her pull, the sight and sound and smell of her too much for them to bear to be parted from.",
      "And yet Derek seems unaffected.",
      "And if he is unaffected by her, then perhaps there is hope that he could be affected by someone else.",
      "\"Well,\" Stiles says, bold smile stretching across his face as he turns to go, \"I suppose if you have nothing better to do.\"",
      "And then he turns away, still smiling.",
      "He feels Derek's gaze hot on his back as he walks away.",
      "- - - - - And if Morrell fails to understand that Lydia is giving her only the most basic details, well.",
      "That's hardly Lydia's problem.",
      "Let the witch believe that she knows what Lydia wants, what she's going to do.",
      "Let her believe that she knows anything.",
      "Lydia promises Morrell the seed of the God of Death, and smiles when the witch's eyes light up.",
      "Who knows what the woman plans of doing with the stuff, but that's hardly Lydia's concern.",
      "She just needed something big enough to convince Morrell to enchant the rope to bind the God of Death.",
      "\"Each vial of the stuff, after the first, will cost a favour.\"",
      "Okay, and maybe Lydia wants a few other things, as well, maybe has some vague ideas brewing in the back of her mind, half-formed plans for her little messenger-bird.",
      "After all, Stiles had been so helpful already, offering to help carry anything Lydia needed, information or goods, anything, from Above to Below.",
      "It would be awfully remiss of her not to give him something in return.",
      "Lydia haggles with Morrell a moment more, but she already knows the witch will cave.",
      "Lydia leaves with a length of enchanted rope, a promise of more favors to come, and a building excitement for what will happen next.",
      "- - - - - Stiles gapes, eyes wide.",
      "\"You're not interested.\"",
      "He's standing in Derek's chambers, just inside the door, with his arm still outstretched, Kate's letter trapped in his fingers, frozen with surprise.",
      "Derek himself sits across the room on a low chair idly cleaning his sword.",
      "He doesn't look up.",
      "\"You're not interested in Kate, the Goddess of lust and passion.",
      "The Goddess you've been having an affair with for ages now.",
      "And just like that, you're going to refuse her.\"",
      "Derek glances up, a small smirk lingering at the corner of his mouth when his eyes catch Stiles'.",
      "In the low light his green eyes dance like jewels, and Stiles feels his heart stutter wildly in his chest.",
      "Derek looks away again, back to his sword, and Stiles feels like he can breathe again.",
      "He doesn't know what to say, so he just stands there for a long moment, watching Derek as Derek ignores him.",
      "It's something Stiles never even thought to wish for.",
      "Just like that, Derek has waved Kate off, dismissed her like she wasn't everything all men are supposed to want.",
      "Stiles' mind whirls, implications and wild imaginings chasing themselves across his mind.",
      "Because if Derek doesn't want Kate, then what does he want?",
      "He doesn't realize he's grinning until his cheeks start to hurt.",
      "\"Well then,\" he says, finally, airy and light.",
      "\"I guess I'd better go tell her not to waste her time anymore.\"",
      "Derek looks up at that, eyes dark and expression unreadable.",
      "\"Yeah.",
      "Do that.\"",
      "Stiles grins again, snaps off a lazy salute, just for the way Derek's brows draw down as he frowns.",
      "He turns on his heel and heads for the door.",
      "\"Remember,\" he says, pausing with his hand on the latch, \"My father will need you for battle tomorrow.\"",
      "Stiles smiles and looks back.",
      "\"Shall I come for you when it's time?\"",
      "The innuendo slips off his tongue without a second thought.",
      "Derek stares at him, brows furrowed as his mouth drops open slightly; his eyes look nearly black, and almost hungry.",
      "\"You do that,\" he mutters, and Stiles shivers at the sound of his voice, all gravel and smoke.",
      "\"Yes, I think I will,\" Stiles tells him, musingly.",
      "And then he's gone, throwing a smirk over his shoulder as he turns, slipping out the door and down the corridor before Derek can say another word.",
      "- - - - - Finally, she hears him whistling up the path, something bouncy and light, and underneath the whisper of the feathers at his heels.",
      "He all but throws himself onto the ground beside her, smiling widely up at her.",
      "\"Hello Lydia, my dear, how are you this lovely day?\"",
      "Lydia arches one eyebrow, staring down at him.",
      "\"What on earth is going on with you today?\"",
      "\"Well,\" Stiles says, picking idly at a strand of grass.",
      "\"I may have very, incredibly subtly propositioned the God of War.\"",
      "Lydia feels both of her eyebrows shoot up.",
      "She stares incredulously.",
      "\"I thought you said he was with Kate.\"",
      "\"Mmm,\" Stiles hums, smiling.",
      "\"He was.",
      "Apparently he's not interested anymore.\"",
      "\"And you think he might be interested in you?\" Stiles grins up at her, eyes shining, mischief written into every inch of him.",
      "\"I think I could persuade him.\"",
      "\"Well,\" Lydia says, tilting her face into the sunlight, thinking.",
      "\"Then I guess we'd better get started.\"",
      "Stiles props himself up on one elbow.",
      "\"What do you mean?\" Lydia smiles down at him, \"I mean, Stiles, that I'm going to help you win your God.",
      "After all, you're helping me with my capture of Death.",
      "Of course I'm going to help you conquer War.\"",
      "Stiles levers himself up onto one knee, kneeling beside her as he grasps her hand, bestowing a light kiss across her knuckles.",
      "\"And this, Lydia my dear, is why I love you so.\"",
      "Lydia laughs, rolling her eyes.",
      "\"Tonight then,\" she says, firmly.",
      "\"I'll show you everything you need to know.\"",
      "\"I promise to be an excellent student,\" Stiles vows, grinning up at her with dark eyes.",
      "Lydia eyes the long lines of his fingers, the muscle of his forearms, the perfect bow of his mouth, and smirks down at him.",
      "\"Oh, I have no doubt of that.\"",
      "- - - - - There is a battle, the Sheriff mustering his men against Chris's, each side doing their level best to flay the other into pieces.",
      "The air shudders with the clash of metal and bone, corpses pile up like hills, and the ground runs red and soggy with blood.",
      "Stiles perches in the branches of a tree in the distance and watches, eyes trained on one figure in particular.",
      "His eyes trace the bunch and flex of muscle, the glisten of sweat on skin, the red burnish of blood across broad knuckles.",
      "After, when the battle has finished and the players have disbanded, the losers to tend to their wounds and the victors to celebrate, Stiles makes his way back to Olympus, a shadow flitting through the streets until he reaches his destination.",
      "The window is no obstacle and Stiles slips through in silence and stands, leaning against a pillar, and watches.",
      "Derek hasn't noticed him, preoccupied with unbuckling his armor and stripping off his filthy clothes.",
      "Stiles stares with bated breath as every new inch of the God's skin is revealed.",
      "Finally, the God stands in nothing but his loincloth, the dim light casting golden shadows across the broad expanse of his back.",
      "There is a bowl on a side table next to a cloth so Derek can can clean himself; he reaches for them, the motion pulling the muscles of his back into sharper relief.",
      "Stiles sucks in a quiet breath and opens his mouth.",
      "\"Let me help you with that.\"",
      "Derek tenses but doesn't turn.",
      "He stands still, letting his arm fall back to his side as Stiles comes closer, stepping nearly silent on the stone floor.",
      "When he's close enough, he exhales, his breath washing over the back of Derek's neck, goosebumps rising in it's wake.",
      "Stiles grins; it's beautiful.",
      "He reaches for the cloth, dipping in in the water.",
      "He doesn't bother wringing it out, just brings it to Derek's skin, arm wrapped around his chest to swipe at his collarbone.",
      "Derek's breath hitches, slightly, enough.",
      "Make him wait, Lydia says in his mind.",
      "Make him shake a bit before you go on, make it so that he doesn't feel anything but what you give him.",
      "Stiles leans closer, hiding his grin at the nape of Derek's neck.",
      "He trails the cloth across Derek's skin again, feather-light, delighting in the tiny shivers under the God's skin.",
      "Stiles leans in, lips barely grazing Derek's ear.",
      "\"I told you I would come,\" Stiles whispers.",
      "\"And so will you.\"",
      "He's used to victory, he's used to winning.",
      "He's used to fighting and coming out on top, Lydia whispers.",
      "Derek shudders and turns his head slightly, just enough to catch Stiles' gaze.",
      "His eyes are blown black, cheeks flushed.",
      "He looks hungry, looks debauched already, and Stiles has barely even begun.",
      "Derek doesn't say anything, just turn his head away again and tilts it back, resting against Stiles shoulder.",
      "Make it so he gives in.",
      "\"Don't touch,\" Stiles whispers.",
      "\"Don't turn.",
      "Let me do what I want, and I promise you, you will get what you want.\"",
      "Derek makes a noise, a low rumble in his throat, and nods, just barely, just enough.",
      "Derek is nearly twice his size, could kill him in an instant, could rip him to shreds with his bare hands.",
      "But here he is, trembling at under Stiles' fingers, letting him do this.",
      "Stiles can feel the rushing in his veins at the sight of Derek like this, still and silent just because Stiles told him to be.",
      "Make him surrender to you, and you will have him.",
      "\"Let me,\" Stiles says softly, and grins when Derek sighs, tilting his head back, the lines of his body going loose and boneless.",
      "\"I've got you.\"",
      "- - - - - The portal to the Underworld is hidden at the base of an old tree, gnarled and withered, it's bark gone grey with age.",
      "Slipping in is easy, like twisting herself into a mouse's burrow.",
      "The earth gives easily beneath her fingers and she descends, dark and rich and black.",
      "The wide hole gives way to something like a staircase, rough steps hewn from the earth and winding downwards.",
      "Lydia climbs downward for a long time, heedless of the darkness.",
      "When light begins to creep towards her, it is pale and greenish, a ghostly sort of light, the light of dark and secret places.",
      "When she reaches the bottom of the staircase, Lydia stops for a moment, gazing with wide eyes at the land she's reached.",
      "Dark fields stretch out before her, black dirt broken by swaths of pale flowers, glowing white and pearly in the dim light.",
      "She can hear the steady rush of the wide rivers, the glint of the waters where the Acheron meets the Cocytus.",
      "There is a small dock on the bank, crude but sturdy.",
      "A long boat rests there, bobbing gently on the waters, painted black, with a skull for a figurehead.",
      "A figure stands beside it on the dock,tall and thin, his aged, weathered face hidden behind the hood of his dark robes.",
      "Lydia approaches him, a small smile on her face.",
      "\"Stiles has already paid my way,\" she says firmly, staring up at the boatman.",
      "The boatman stands for a long moment without moving; then, finally, he turns to her, bowing slightly.",
      "\"Your passage is paid,\" he says.",
      "His voice is barely more than a whisper, more an echo, drifting like the mist across the fields.",
      "\"I will take you to the other side.\"",
      "The passage from one side to the other seems to take an eternity, and yet Lydia is still surprised when she sees the far shore come into view at last.",
      "The dock on this side is made of stone, and torches burn with white flame on either side.",
      "There is a wide stone staircase leading down into the darkness on the other side.",
      "Lydia stares at it for a long moment, then straightens her shoulders, shakes out her hair, and begins her climb.",
      "The palace, when she reaches it, is barred by gates at every turn.",
      "At the first, Lydia pauses, looking around, but there are no gatekeepers, no one to call to to open the way.",
      "Lydia pauses a moment, then smiles.",
      "She reaches out, placing a hand against the cold black metal.",
      "\"I wish to see the God of Death,\" she says, softly.",
      "\"Let me pass.\"",
      "There is silence for long moments, and then the gate swings silently open on it's own.",
      "Lydia smiles again and steps through without looking back.",
      "The rest of the gates open for her without a word.",
      "She finally meets with another person as she nears the center of the palace, a dark-robed servant who guides her through endless dark stone corridors without a word, until finally they reach an enormous black door.",
      "The servant bows, backing away into the shadows.",
      "Lydia takes a deep breath, steadying, and pushes the doors open.",
      "The hall before her is beautiful, in it's dark, elegant way.",
      "There are tapestries against the walls, embroidered scenes of lost souls and souls at rest.",
      "The stone pillars are intricately carved, figures like bones or flowers or stalks of reeds along the rivers.",
      "And at the far end, seated in a throne of blackest iron, is the God of Death himself.",
      "\"Well,\" Peter says, voice soft and light.",
      "\"What have we here?\"",
      "\"I've come to talk to you about some things,\" Lydia says, slowly approaching the throne.",
      "\"There are some things I want, and some things that I could do for you.\"",
      "She resists the urge to smirk as she sees the God's gaze sharpen, interest flaring in his dark eyes.",
      "\"I thought perhaps we could help each other.\"",
      "She smiles at him, all innocence; Stiles had been more than happy to teach her that one.",
      "Peter regards her for a long moment before he smiles, charming and dark.",
      "\"Of course, my dear,\" he says, standing.",
      "\"Perhaps you'd like to dine with me?",
      "I do find talking is better done on a full stomach.",
      "And it's such a long way to come to get here,\" Peter adds, looking thoughtful.",
      "\"I imagine you must be hungry.\"",
      "\"Of course,\" Lydia says, doing her best to sound earnest and grateful.",
      "Peter shows her to a long table laid with every food she can imagine, and probably some she can't.",
      "\"Take anything you like from this table,\" he tells her, sly smile playing on his lips like he thinks she doesn't recognise it for the trap it is.",
      "Death never offers anything freely; Death always takes without warning.",
      "Good thing she's thought of that.",
      "Death cannot take what she's already freely offered.",
      "But she can still take from him.",
      "She picks up a pomegranate, sliced in half, red fruit against white, juice bleeding dark into her hands, and thinks of Stiles telling her about red blood against pale skin, the way it made his blood sing in his veins, his Godly heart beating faster at the sight of it.",
      "Six seeds should be enough, she thinks, and bites.",
      "She catches Peter's eyes on her, calculating and victorious.",
      "Well, she thinks, Time enough to correct him later.",
      "For now, though...",
      "For now, Lydia is exactly where she wants to be.",
      "\"Tell me, Peter,\" she says, leaning forward.",
      "\"Do you play chess?\"",
      "The God licks his lips, leaning forward as well.",
      "\"Oh my dear,\" he says softly.",
      "\"I would love to play with you.\"",
      "And, Checkmate, Lydia thinks, and smiles, dark and bright.",
      "\"Then let's begin.\""

    "text": "When Achilles wakes from dreams, it is with the sense that something has been lost - an indescribable, spirit deep hollow feeling. Dreams are golden, and living is grey. He is inattentive at school, polite eternally to his teachers, and excellent at sport. The javelin almost flies from his hands, the sword in fencing an extension of himself. Music comes naturally, also, but he cannot perform for others. It feels dissonant, another absence he cannot explain. He prefers older instruments, wood over metal, and cannot play piano for love nor money. At first is frustrates his teachers, then it charms them, that someone who excels in all things cannot place a key change or play a scale. He sleeps to live, and lives for sleep. ------ Patroclus' dreams are bloodsoaked, for the most part, a dream of gold so rare as to be blessed relief, a beautiful boy living in his head and on the pages he paints, bloodsoaked and painful. He cannot sleep, some nights, and stares instead at the window, stars familiar and yet incorrect, too many and not enough. He stays at home frequently, his father incapable of approval and Patroclus incapable of caring, schooling seeming so wrong, a fading memory of a half dream keeping him in place - the boy weaving a beautiful tune day after day, so gorgeous it burns into your bones, where he is marked permanently. Philtatos, he thinks, some days, and does not understand. The first time he fights another, over a simple game, he pushes him over and runs, runs home, vomits and shakes at a sudden feeling of repetition, destiny playing itself over in his head, and he realises these dreams are not a fiction. ------ The day the two lives converge is dull, clouds covering the sun and rain on the horizon. Patroclus has changed schools, again, another incident forcing him to run, and he feels drawn to the music room, the tune drifting from a window so very familiar. There is a boy playing the lyre, an anachronism so ridiculous Patroclus nearly laughs, and his hair is covering his face in golden waves. Patroclus feels himself freeze in the doorway. There is a smile barely visible on Achilles' face, and he looks up. Statuesque, they stare at each other. Recognition flares like the sun emerging from the clouds. It is bright, now. Achilles tilts his head, moves forward, catlike, to rest in front of Patroclus. He is still the shorter of the two. \"I should've known you'd appear only for my music, Patroclus. You always did have great affection for it.\" Patroclus cannot breathe. He wants badly to clutch his arms around Achilles, but if he indulges he is not certain he will be able to let go. They have been apart for a long time. \"Silence, dear Patroclus?\" Achilles has recovered himself, smiles slyly. \"You never seemed this submissive in the past - have the years changed you?\" Achilles finds himself against Patroclus' chest, and closes his eyes. ------ They are lying together in the park, hands grazing each other, before long. Lessons seem unthinkable in the face of this, and besides, they are neither of them fond of their teachers. In the face of Chiron, all teaching seems inferior. \"I could see it,\" says Patroclus, suddenly. \"What happened. After I died.\" Achilles grips his hand tightly. \"I am sorry.\" \"Don't be.\" He rolls closer, brushes his nose against Achilles' cheek. \"I would've been the same, if you had died in my place.\" \"Then it is well that it did not happen. I would not like you to be remembered for battle.\" \"As if I am remembered at all.\" He had studied Homer, once, a teacher with a sharp tongue and a taste for jokes at his expense. Today, the man had said, we will study the death of Patroclus. The dead silence in the room had been deafening, and Patroclus had nearly thrown his book at the man's face. His hand was stayed, somehow, and the verse was - an ignition, of sorts, a feeling of belonging in himself. Achilles was contained within that book, not quite him but close, and it was good. \"Do not belittle yourself.\" Achilles' voice is stern, commanding, a tone Patroclus remembers from a thousand speeches to the Akhaians. \"Medicine is perhaps not so memorable as a penetrable heel,\" He makes a face, this myth clearly distasteful. \"But it is worthier by far.\" There is nothing to do then but laugh, and kiss Achilles until they have made up for a thousand years of distance.",
    "sentences": [
      "When Achilles wakes from dreams, it is with the sense that something has been lost - an indescribable, spirit deep hollow feeling.",
      "Dreams are golden, and living is grey.",
      "He is inattentive at school, polite eternally to his teachers, and excellent at sport.",
      "The javelin almost flies from his hands, the sword in fencing an extension of himself.",
      "Music comes naturally, also, but he cannot perform for others.",
      "It feels dissonant, another absence he cannot explain.",
      "He prefers older instruments, wood over metal, and cannot play piano for love nor money.",
      "At first is frustrates his teachers, then it charms them, that someone who excels in all things cannot place a key change or play a scale.",
      "He sleeps to live, and lives for sleep.",
      "------ Patroclus' dreams are bloodsoaked, for the most part, a dream of gold so rare as to be blessed relief, a beautiful boy living in his head and on the pages he paints, bloodsoaked and painful.",
      "He cannot sleep, some nights, and stares instead at the window, stars familiar and yet incorrect, too many and not enough.",
      "He stays at home frequently, his father incapable of approval and Patroclus incapable of caring, schooling seeming so wrong, a fading memory of a half dream keeping him in place - the boy weaving a beautiful tune day after day, so gorgeous it burns into your bones, where he is marked permanently.",
      "Philtatos, he thinks, some days, and does not understand.",
      "The first time he fights another, over a simple game, he pushes him over and runs, runs home, vomits and shakes at a sudden feeling of repetition, destiny playing itself over in his head, and he realises these dreams are not a fiction.",
      "------",
      "The day the two lives converge is dull, clouds covering the sun and rain on the horizon.",
      "Patroclus has changed schools, again, another incident forcing him to run, and he feels drawn to the music room, the tune drifting from a window so very familiar.",
      "There is a boy playing the lyre, an anachronism so ridiculous Patroclus nearly laughs, and his hair is covering his face in golden waves.",
      "Patroclus feels himself freeze in the doorway.",
      "There is a smile barely visible on Achilles' face, and he looks up.",
      "Statuesque, they stare at each other.",
      "Recognition flares like the sun emerging from the clouds.",
      "It is bright, now.",

    "text": "The goats browsed in the scrub around the lake, secure and content, knowing that the old dog who lay panting under a nearby olive tree was keeping a lazy eye on them. There was little danger though, the powerful heat made even thieves lazy and any wolves would be sheltering in their dens or dozing in the shade themselves. The boy was less attentive, he lay sprawled on a smooth, red rock, drying his ruddy skin in the afternoon sun. The long climb up from the village and then down into the gully had been tough, but worth it when he stripped off his dirty tunic and dived into the fresh, cool water, scrubbing the grime and sweat from his body, his shaggy black hair felt lighter by half without all the dust it had accumulated over the last few scorching days. He was happy, his goats were safe, he had bread and a sharp, smelly cheese for his afternoon meal and all the olives he could eat, and he had the company of his dog, his best friend in the world... Gwaine sounded a low growl, stark against the cicadas' hum and Merlin could hear him stalk closer to his ear, defensive. He opened his eyes, shielding them against the glare and saw a lone man standing at the foot of his rock. The man was golden, from the fluffy strands of his hair down to his sandaled toes, his flawless skin glowing in the sun. He wore a chiton of bright white (hanging loose off one shoulder) with a long leaf-shaped blade in the belt, on his back he carried a bow and a quiver was strapped to his muscular thigh. His eyes were narrowed at Merlin, but he made no offensive move. Feeling far to mellow to worry anyway, Merlin greeted him jovially. \"If you too came to swim don't let me stop you friend,\" he said, \"The water is glorious...\" There was a pause, then: \"I'm not your friend, and I don't need your permission to bathe here, boy.\" Merlin raised an eyebrow, the stranger was glaring at him intently and Merlin became awkwardly aware of his nakedness, he refused to show his discomfort though and schooled his features. \"My mistake,\" he drawled, loading his voice with as much casual unconcern as he could, \"carry on then.\" He waved his hand imperiously and closed his eyes again trying not to feel naked and vulnerable, not easy with his tackle on display and his knife and slingshot well out of reach. Gwaine was standing stiff by his head, still rumbling deep in his throat but waiting to see what Merlin would command. The golden man huffed loudly, \"You can't speak to me like that,\" there was the hint of a childish whine to his rich voice, \"don't you know who I am?\" \"The twat who's blocking my sun?\" Merlin offered boldly, still determined not to give in to this arsehole who seemed to think he owned the place. \"Nooo,\" he said petulantly, Merlin's mother would have given him a smack for behaving so, \"I am Apollo Artaius, Master of the Forest, son of the divine Zeus and greatest hunter in the land...\" He lifted his chin striking a commanding pose. Merlin had to chuckle, \"And I am Eros, god of love,\" he said stroking his hand down his torso in a way that surprised himself. At this the golden man who claimed to be Apollo snorted. \"I know Eros and he's an annoying little shit.\" \"Maybe I'm in disguise\" There was a pause while 'Apollo' swept his gaze over Merlin's prone form, it was intimate and rather unnerving. \"No, I know what you are,\" his voice had dropped, low and seductive, \"you're the nymph of this pool, come up from the depths to tempt men to their doom.\" Merlin couldn't help but laugh, \"And helpless gods I suppose? And by the way: nymphs are girls.\" \"I'm sure they'd make an exception for you, you'd be the prettiest of them all,\" there was a smirk to his voice, Merlin had had enough, he rolled his eyes and started getting up. \"Does that line ever work?\" He grumbled. \"It's not a line, it was supposed to be a compliment you ungrateful peasant.\" Apollo drew his gleaming bronze sword and levelled it at Merlin's throat. Dropping into a crouch, Merlin held out his right hand and his eyes flashed gold, the short flint knife that had lain by his pack flew into his grasp. It looked pathetically inadequate so Merlin was surprised when Apollo took a step backwards. \"Huh...\" He said, frowning and pursing his pink lips. \"Huh.\" He said again. \"Oh brilliant,\" he went on, \"you're one of my bastard cousins aren't you? Or a brother perhaps?\" \"No,\" Merlin stood up and looked away, \"I'm just a peasant.\" \"And your parents?\" \"Mum's just a peasant too.\" \"And your father?\" Merlin shrugged, \"He was from the north, he came here from Hyperborea, but before that who knows?\" he got a misty, far off look as he went on \"He was a shaman among his people, he wore the skins of beasts and spoke with the great lizards...\" his voice hardened, \"Or that's what he told my mum, he told her a lot of things, but he moved on without even knowing he'd left her with a belly full of me...\" Merlin waved his small knife in anger. \"Sounds about right,\" said Apollo, sheathing his blade and stepping closer, he rested a hand on the arm holding Merlin's knife, he didn't try to take it, just soothed the arm like the flank of a restless horse. This close he really was quite dazzling, Merlin could feel heat coming off his body above that of the already hot air, his knees felt weak. \"So you're not related to me,\" Apollo murmured, lips practically on his ear now, \"a fact which, I have to say, speaks greatly in your favour...\" his nose ghosted across Merlin's cheekbone, the hand on his arm still stroked up and down gently but the other had snaked around Merlin's bare hip and the fingers were massaging his arse cheek. Merlin found himself swaying into the embrace, he dropped his knife in favour of burying his hand in the soft golden hair and breathed deeply, the scent of bay leaves and citrus overwhelmed his senses and when Apollo joined their lips Merlin kissed him back eagerly. \"Let's start again,\" Apollo purred into his mouth, \"I won't try to compliment you except to say that you are beautiful, and I would very much like to fuck you.\" Merlin groaned, \"Oh okay... Yes please.\" Apollo laughed and lowered him down to the ground, leaving Merlin's arms only to quickly strip off his weapons and tunic. Crawling back between Merlin's legs he whispered a word and the bare sandstone rock burst into a bed of thick, springy moss, softer than Merlin's thin straw mattress at home, it felt luxurious and Merlin arched his back as he felt soft lips closing around one nipple and then trailing down to tease his belly button. When that warm mouth enveloped the head of his cock the pleasure that sparked through his body was so great that he barely registered one oily finger slipping inside his hole, let alone wondered where the oil had come from. With two fingers he started to feel the stretch but it wasn't unpleasant, Apollo was surprisingly gentle and all the time kept licking at Merlin's cock, sometimes dipping to the balls, sometimes suckling on the head, but never for long enough. Merlin whined and bucked, there were three fingers stretching him now, slipping deeper and sending jolts through him before pulling back and working the ring of muscle open, it was torture, his hips writhed trying to simultaneously push against both the fingers and the hot mouth. \"Come on, I'm ready,\" he pleaded, his voice sounded hoarse and desperate but he didn't care, and it had the desired effect. Apollo gave one final swirl of his fingers and he was lifting Merlin's legs, bending him nearly in half and sliding in deep. Merlin cried out in relief, he was well stretched and his body opened easily to the intrusion, it felt amazing, and right, like he hadn't realised he'd been so empty until he was filled. His fingers clawed at Apollo's back and buttocks, urging him on, and he whimpered when Apollo brought their tongues together again, fucking his mouth at the same pace with which he fucked his arse. It was bliss, Merlin felt that there was nothing in the world except the thrust and the pressure and the moans and grunts that could have come from either or both of them. He was flying, reaching for his orgasm but at the same time not wanting this feeling to ever end, but when Apollo bit down on his throat, growling his name, Merlin felt the pressure inside him burst, he let out a cry and spilled all over his chest as he felt Apollo slow and grind his release into him. His body went slack, his blood buzzing in his veins, he knew there was a ridiculous grin on his face and when Apollo lifted himself onto his elbows he saw a matching expression there. \"Well.\" The cold voice cut through the haze of their pleasure. \"That was quite the performance. Tell me boy, do you know what happens to mortals who defile my sanctuaries?\" Apollo groaned, drawing himself out of the bewildered Merlin and rolling onto his back with an arm draped over his eyes. \"Cursed harpy, can you not give me one moment to myself?\" \"Oh but my dear brother, it is terribly bad manners to invite someone on a hunt and then to abandon them at the crucial moment... No matter how delicious the morsel you have scented.\" Merlin could hear the sneer in her voice but was too scared to sit up and look on her. Brother? That would make the lady Artemis, a formidable goddess and not one he would wish to anger. Further. Apollo sat up. \"Oh and he was a treat... Give him some time to recover and maybe he'll give you a go...\" Apollo turned to him conversationally, \"She won't allow me between her dead-fish thighs, but I keep telling her a tumble would do her the world of good.\" Merlin stared at him, unsure what he could possibly say to that. \"Look sweet sister, you've terrified the poor boy, what a shame you do have this effect on men, no wonder you're untouched, as if any could keep it up under your... withering gaze...\" he smirked, and Merlin hoped that if he just lay very still they might both forget about him and go off to bicker somewhere else. It was not to be. \"This is my sanctuary,\" the goddess purred, \"and it has been desecrated, I demand recompense.\" Apollo shrugged, \"Just sacrifice one of the goats and she'll be on her way.\" At this Merlin jumped up, \"No, not my goats, please my lady, my mother would kill me...\" He rounded on Apollo, finger jabbing \"and don't you dare suggest my dog!\" He turned back to Artemis, \"Please my lady, I am sorry if I have wronged you, what else can I do to make amends?\" Now that he saw her he was in awe, she looked very different to her brother, dark haired and pale of skin, more like to Merlin's colouring, though where most of his skin was burnt red, hers was as white as his arse, as if the sun never touched her. She was dressed demurely in a long sleeved tunic and leggings, in shades of green and brown, her large eyes were green also and her black hair was pulled up under a hood. She was beautiful in a way that contrasted completely with her brother. \"'The Lady of Wild Things'\" he whispered, he had heard his uncle and some of the other elders use her old name, it suited her. Artemis laughed, \"He has courage, and more courtesy than some,\" she spat this aside to her brother, \"Come here child,\" she beckoned. Merlin stepped slowly towards her, as he got close it became clear that he was a fair bit taller than she, and it felt very wrong, so he dropped to his knees before her. She petted his head and bent down to lay a chaste kiss on his lips. \"There's a good boy,\" she cooed, \"I have decided what you can do for me,\" her devious smile was starting to worry Merlin, \"I don't believe all this was really your fault, how were you to know that this place was sacred?\" He nodded his head, wide eyed, willing her to understand he meant no offense. \"My dear brother on the other hand...\" she leant forward til he could feel her warm breath on his ear. \"He needs to be taken down a notch or two.\" Merlin glanced over to where Apollo sat cross legged and playing with his toe, trying to appear uninterested but clearly straining to hear what was being said. \"You are going to fuck him for me, you are going to bend him over like the dog that his is and fuck him until he falls apart...\" Apollo had obviously caught enough of that to get the idea as he rose to his knees crying \"Steady on...\" \"...This I will reckon a fitting offering and I will consider your debt repaid.\" She finished primly, a smirk dancing on the corner of her lips. Merlin gaped, he looked from her to Apollo and back again. \"What? But... What?\" was all he could manage. \"And why would I let this mortal child \"bend me over and fuck me like a dog?\"\" Apollo asked, incredulous. Merlin thought this was an excellent question. The lady smirked and left her place in front of Merlin, heading towards her brother, he strained round to look and saw her kissing him, open mouthed and wanton, he grunted and wrapped his arms around her waist, but she pulled away. \"Because, dear brother, if you please me in this you may get a look at what's between my \"dead-fish thighs.\"\" She laughed and skipped out of his reach, wagging her finger. \"You're lying,\" he said, frowning. \"There's only one way to find out.\" She beckoned to Merlin to stand and come over, he was already half hard from the images that had been planted in his head and he walked awkwardly. Artemis eyed him approvingly, Apollo with more suspicion. \"Promise me.\" He said to her. \"I promise nothing.\" She replied. He paused, before turning to Merlin. \"Come on then,\" he grumbled, \"This had better be good, I don't think I've ever let a mortal fuck me before.\" Merlin had never fucked anyone before. His only comfort was that having come so recently and so well he was unlikely to embarrass himself by spurting as soon as his dick touched Apollo's arse. Apollo's round, golden, juicy looking arse, that was wiggling at him impatiently. Apollo was on all fours in front of him, grouching at him to get on with it because he didn't have all day. But that wasn't what the Lady wanted, she wanted a show, she wanted to see her brother taken apart and Merlin knew that shoving his inexperienced dick in and out a few times wasn't going to cut it. There was something he'd heard about, that his friend in the village had whispered of, and they had made faces and pretended to throw up at the thought, but here, staring at Apollo's bum, spreading his cheeks gently and seeing the dark pucker within, it didn't seem so gross at all. Merlin bowed his head and licked at the wrinkled entrance, it tasted earthy and animal, but not bad, and the surprised gasp that reached his ears had him dipping back in flicking his tongue up and down before sucking his saliva to the fore and slathering it over the entrance. He made his tongue into a point and nudged carefully at the hole, bringing more spit down to ease it in. He felt the muscle twitching against the intrusion but pushed further, feeling the give around his tongue. He smoothed his palms over the rough hairs of Apollo's solid thighs and back to his buttocks, his skin was so warm, but nothing to the heat bathing Merlin's face. His thrust his tongue harder and deeper, and he could feel the tight muscle relaxing around it, but it was beginning to ache from the effort, he slipped two fingers in but continued to mouth at the hole while he rested his sore tongue, adding a third finger and flexing the three into a triangle. Apollo whimpered, whimpered, and pushed back, not satisfied with the substitution, so Merlin sighed, the huff of breath earning him another wriggle, wet his tongue and slid it back in alongside two fingers. Apollo was resting his head on his folded arms now moaning and thrusting back against Merlin's mouth, before long even this wasn't enough for him though. \"Fuck me...\" he growled, so low Merlin wasn't sure he had heard. \"Just fuck me,\" this time it was louder, a command. Merlin squeaked, abandoning his position and wiping his arm across his sloppy mouth. He fumbled getting his cock in hand and whispered a word which left it glistening with oil, he had discovered this spell around the time he discovered wanking. He lined it up to the now gaping hole and pushed the head in, then grasping Apollo's hips he slammed himself home, ripping a grunt of pleasure from the god beneath him. He set up a brutal pace, grabbing Apollo's thighs and spreading them wider, driving in to that perfect arse with obscene squelches. He slid his hand round in front of them and grasped Apollo's dripping cock, he just hoped he could make him come before he himself did. His hand was slick with oil as it glided over the smooth skin of Apollo's cock, timing his pulls to the rhythm of his hips. He could feel his control slipping, he wasn't going to last much longer, though if the noises Apollo was making were anything to go by he wasn't far off either. It was all or nothing, Merlin had to finish him and soon. Reaching forward he grabbed a handful of that golden hair, yanking him upright and flush against his chest, with his hips still pumping and his right hand still slipping on his cock Merlin hissed into Apollo's ear: \"How does it feel to be fucked by a mortal child? You've been such a good dog for me, whined so prettily for my cock, shall I make you howl doggie? Howl for me, come on, HOWL...\" Apollo would later argue that the noise he made was certainly not a howl, but may admit to some kind of warlike bellow he might have emitted as he came, spraying his seed over the thick moss as Merlin milked the last drops out of him, filling him up with his own. Apollo flopped forward onto his hands with Merlin draped over his back, panting. Merlin sat back slowly, popping out of Apollo's still clenching hole and watching in wonder as a pearl of his own seed was squeezed out. He looked up, eyes finding the Lady, who now perched on the stump under the olive tree, fondling Gwaine's head, which rested on her lap as he gazed adoringly up at her. Traitor. \"Please accept my tribute, my lady,\" he said, his voice wobbling though he tried to keep it steady, \"I hope it is to your liking...\" They both looked down at Apollo who had flopped over and lay staring at the sky with a stupid grin on his face. She smiled, \"You have done well, boy. You are forgiven and may come here to bathe, or fuck, or whatever you wish, from now on.\" With a last scratch behind Gwaine's ear she turned to leave, Merlin was momentarily worried that he would go with her, but he trotted back to Merlin with a look as if to say \"No hard feelings, right?\" Merlin scowled at him before reaching out to scratch behind his ear as well. \"Hey...\" Apollo had stirred, \"What about our deal?\" She looked at him blankly. \"The boy is free to go, and may take all his goats back to his dear mother.\" \"What about our deal?\" he gritted out. \"Oh my darling,\" she exclaimed, \"You didn't actually think I was going to fuck you did you?\" Merlin could still hear her tinkling laughter long after she had disappeared into the forest. He was kind of glad he was an only child. He looked nervously at Apollo, was he going to be angry? And was he going to take it out on Merlin? He was smiling though, and broke into a chuckle as he grabbed Merlin by the neck and dragged him down to his chest. \"Vicious bitch,\" he murmured, \"One day I'll have her... Still got you though, haven't I?\" He scruffed Merlin's hair in a most undignified way, but he found he didn't really mind and he wrapped an arm around the broad chest and settled his head on Apollo's shoulder. They lay dozing like that in the soft afternoon light, while the goats muttered and chomped and the cicadas sang to each other. \"Sooo,\" Apollo said casually after a while, \"She said you can come and fuck here whenever you like?\" He seemed to want some kind of response so Merlin grunted agreement. \"I wonder how long it will take before we can make her regret her generosity?\" Merlin felt a terrible sinking in his stomach, of all the places he could have gone for a dip he just had to come here didn't he? _____________________________________",

      "Merlin gaped, he looked from her to Apollo and back again.",
      "\"What?",
      "But... What?\" was all he could manage.",
      "\"And why would I let this mortal child \"bend me over and fuck me like a dog?\"\" Apollo asked, incredulous.",
      "Merlin thought this was an excellent question.",
      "The lady smirked and left her place in front of Merlin, heading towards her brother, he strained round to look and saw her kissing him, open mouthed and wanton, he grunted and wrapped his arms around her waist, but she pulled away.",
      "\"Because, dear brother, if you please me in this you may get a look at what's between my \"dead-fish thighs.\"\" She laughed and skipped out of his reach, wagging her finger.",
      "\"You're lying,\" he said, frowning.",
      "\"There's only one way to find out.\"",
      "She beckoned to Merlin to stand and come over, he was already half hard from the images that had been planted in his head and he walked awkwardly.",
      "Artemis eyed him approvingly, Apollo with more suspicion.",
      "\"Promise me.\"",
      "He said to her.",
      "\"I promise nothing.\"",
      "She replied.",
      "He paused, before turning to Merlin.",
      "\"Come on then,\" he grumbled, \"This had better be good, I don't think I've ever let a mortal fuck me before.\"",
      "Merlin had never fucked anyone before.",
      "His only comfort was that having come so recently and so well he was unlikely to embarrass himself by spurting as soon as his dick touched Apollo's arse.",
      "Apollo's round, golden, juicy looking arse, that was wiggling at him impatiently.",
      "Apollo was on all fours in front of him, grouching at him to get on with it because he didn't have all day.",
      "But that wasn't what the Lady wanted, she wanted a show, she wanted to see her brother taken apart and Merlin knew that shoving his inexperienced dick in and out a few times wasn't going to cut it.",
      "There was something he'd heard about, that his friend in the village had whispered of, and they had made faces and pretended to throw up at the thought, but here, staring at Apollo's bum, spreading his cheeks gently and seeing the dark pucker within, it didn't seem so gross at all.",
      "Merlin bowed his head and licked at the wrinkled entrance, it tasted earthy and animal, but not bad, and the surprised gasp that reached his ears had him dipping back in flicking his tongue up and down before sucking his saliva to the fore and slathering it over the entrance.",
      "He made his tongue into a point and nudged carefully at the hole, bringing more spit down to ease it in.",
      "He felt the muscle twitching against the intrusion but pushed further, feeling the give around his tongue.",
      "He smoothed his palms over the rough hairs of Apollo's solid thighs and back to his buttocks, his skin was so warm, but nothing to the heat bathing Merlin's face.",
      "His thrust his tongue harder and deeper, and he could feel the tight muscle relaxing around it, but it was beginning to ache from the effort, he slipped two fingers in but continued to mouth at the hole while he rested his sore tongue, adding a third finger and flexing the three into a triangle.",
      "Apollo whimpered, whimpered, and pushed back, not satisfied with the substitution, so Merlin sighed, the huff of breath earning him another wriggle, wet his tongue and slid it back in alongside two fingers.",
      "Apollo was resting his head on his folded arms now moaning and thrusting back against Merlin's mouth, before long even this wasn't enough for him though.",
      "\"Fuck me...\" he growled, so low Merlin wasn't sure he had heard.",
      "\"Just fuck me,\" this time it was louder, a command.",
      "Merlin squeaked, abandoning his position and wiping his arm across his sloppy mouth.",
      "He fumbled getting his cock in hand and whispered a word which left it glistening with oil, he had discovered this spell around the time he discovered wanking.",
      "He lined it up to the now gaping hole and pushed the head in, then grasping Apollo's hips he slammed himself home, ripping a grunt of pleasure from the god beneath him.",
      "He set up a brutal pace, grabbing Apollo's thighs and spreading them wider, driving in to that perfect arse with obscene squelches.",
      "He slid his hand round in front of them and grasped Apollo's dripping cock, he just hoped he could make him come before he himself did.",
      "His hand was slick with oil as it glided over the smooth skin of Apollo's cock, timing his pulls to the rhythm of his hips.",
      "He could feel his control slipping, he wasn't going to last much longer, though if the noises Apollo was making were anything to go by he wasn't far off either.",
      "It was all or nothing, Merlin had to finish him and soon.",
      "Reaching forward he grabbed a handful of that golden hair, yanking him upright and flush against his chest, with his hips still pumping and his right hand still slipping on his cock Merlin hissed into Apollo's ear: \"How does it feel to be fucked by a mortal child?",
      "You've been such a good dog for me, whined so prettily for my cock, shall I make you howl doggie?",
      "Howl for me, come on, HOWL...\" Apollo would later argue that the noise he made was certainly not a howl, but may admit to some kind of warlike bellow he might have emitted as he came, spraying his seed over the thick moss as Merlin milked the last drops out of him, filling him up with his own.",
      "Apollo flopped forward onto his hands with Merlin draped over his back, panting.",
      "Merlin sat back slowly, popping out of Apollo's still clenching hole and watching in wonder as a pearl of his own seed was squeezed out.",
      "He looked up, eyes finding the Lady, who now perched on the stump under the olive tree, fondling Gwaine's head, which rested on her lap as he gazed adoringly up at her.",
      "Traitor.",
      "\"Please accept my tribute, my lady,\" he said, his voice wobbling though he tried to keep it steady, \"I hope it is to your liking...\" They both looked down at Apollo who had flopped over and lay staring at the sky with a stupid grin on his face.",
      "She smiled, \"You have done well, boy.",
      "You are forgiven and may come here to bathe, or fuck, or whatever you wish, from now on.\"",
      "With a last scratch behind Gwaine's ear she turned to leave, Merlin was momentarily worried that he would go with her, but he trotted back to Merlin with a look as if to say \"No hard feelings, right?\"",
      "Merlin scowled at him before reaching out to scratch behind his ear as well.",
      "\"Hey...\" Apollo had stirred, \"What about our deal?\"",
      "She looked at him blankly.",
      "\"The boy is free to go, and may take all his goats back to his dear mother.\"",
      "\"What about our deal?\" he gritted out.",
      "\"Oh my darling,\" she exclaimed, \"You didn't actually think I was going to fuck you did you?\" Merlin could still hear her tinkling laughter long after she had disappeared into the forest.",
      "He was kind of glad he was an only child.",
      "He looked nervously at Apollo, was he going to be angry?",
      "And was he going to take it out on Merlin?",
      "He was smiling though, and broke into a chuckle as he grabbed Merlin by the neck and dragged him down to his chest.",
      "\"Vicious bitch,\" he murmured, \"One day I'll have her... Still got you though, haven't I?\"",
      "He scruffed Merlin's hair in a most undignified way, but he found he didn't really mind and he wrapped an arm around the broad chest and settled his head on Apollo's shoulder.",
      "They lay dozing like that in the soft afternoon light, while the goats muttered and chomped and the cicadas sang to each other.",
      "\"Sooo,\" Apollo said casually after a while, \"She said you can come and fuck here whenever you like?\"",
      "He seemed to want some kind of response so Merlin grunted agreement.",
      "\"I wonder how long it will take before we can make her regret her generosity?\" Merlin felt a terrible sinking in his stomach, of all the places he could have gone for a dip he just had to come here didn't he? _____________________________________"

    "text": "She knew how to speak all the languages of love, to metamorphose her body into a living tongue that spoke only to desire. His language was war, muscles ripped to shreds with exertion, every moment made on the edge of fear, blood dripping from kisses like saliva. This was the violence that crawled under his skin, burned in his spirit. She knew this. So when he came to her, hands stained with blood, eyes raging, and told her that he had rolled heads across the final battlefield and strewn organs through its muds, had laid low the final people, she knew what he asked for. She would give him what he needed. She was, after all, Love. So she found him a new war. She lurked in shops of magical sundries and traveled to ancient stone places that blood magic through their cracks. She charm-annoyed Hades into loaning her books of underworld magics; she upturned the earth itself in search of a new frontier, a new battlefield. And finally, in the eye sockets of a creaking, ancient sorceress's remains, she found a way. So she called him. As always, he came. She lifted the dagger to her palm and sliced a thin line of dripping red, looked him in the eyes, and said, \"Take my hand,\" and there was a passion in her voice that spoke with magics darker than either of them had ever touched before. Their blood mingled and the world turned black. It folded in on them, devoured them, twisted them in burning cold hands and broke each and every one of their bones to splinters. Together their bodies screamed, shattered piece by piece--until the pressure eased and their eyes opened in a new world. \"What the hell did you do?\" Ares turned on her, eyes stricken, hands grasping futilely at her shoulders. Aphrodite smiled, and cast her hands towards the mudfields around them. \"Only what you asked, my love.\" And--because she was love and she loved war, she had, indeed, given him what his body had asked, for around them men died by the dozens, taken to pieces by weapons that thundered like Zeus's storms. Ares took what he wanted. They fell like ants before him, hundreds splayed in a single blow. He tore limb from limb and struck man from horse and toppled generals with one hand. Blood beaded on his brow like sweat, and death veiled his eyes. Aphrodite never left him, pristine and brutal at death's right hand. The men who died at his hand remembered only hell and war, and believed that the ground itself had risen against them, bloody, with an angel shining by his side, ready to lead them away. And soon, it was done. Men lay between death, uniforms unable to protect them from the horrors of divinity. Fallen horses kicked limply, tongues lolling, eyes bulging. Two gods stood on a human battlefield. The mud squelched sickly beneath their feet, running red with the blood of thousands not meant to die. Together the gods rewrote human history, that day; together, they were terrifying, Ares looked at her, his face a red-streaked mask of death, and he smiled. Aphrodite, red only with the blood that seeped from the black-magic wound on her palm, smiled back. And then his body was a living hurricane of violence, a storm bred to tear weapons from hands and splatter blood across the ground; so her body became that ground, the enemies that snarled and fought and lived, and gave him exactly what he desired--her teeth on his tongue, her nails in his back. She made him scream until his groans could not be distinguished from the weak keens of the dying. When they finished, her knuckles ached with bruises and her handprints pained his wrists with all the pretty colors. Ares wiped his own blood from his mouth--the first of his that had been shed that day--threw back his head, and there, as they lay together in the muck of the dead, threw back his head and laughed. Aphrodite kissed him once more and grinned, teeth gleaming sharp and white. And around them lay the rotting children of love and war.",

    "text": "\"You came to a party as the God of Death?\" I smiled up at him but he didn't smile back. His eyes were blue, almost black set above a full mouth and a stark contrast to pale skin. Damn he was hot. I was scrambling for conversation, something anything to talk about. All of my friend's flirting tips went out the windows as he waited for me to talk. My embarrassment faded when I saw him choke. I guess the dress was working. My friends had talked me into it, throwing encouragement at me as they wrestled me into it. They promised me I'd get guys. I guess they were right. I followed his eyes down and blushed; the low-cut white dress clung to my curves in a way that left nothing to the imagination. The plunging bodice was intricately beaded to draw attention to what Megan insisted was my best asset. Just as he opened his mouth a battering ram hit me from behind sending me reeling forward against Hades. \"Nice costume! Are you my guardian angel?\" The drunk teen was completely plastered; there were stains down his shirt that were definatly vomit. His t-shirt said \"Hey Idiot\" his eyes were bloodshot, a typical college drunk. But my companion was not normal. He didn't threaten the guy but I looked at his face his face. Hades, that couldn't be his name, he was cold I felt his body chill and his eyes...they were. The nameless guy just turned and collapsed. I gasped, reaching for him as he fell. \"Others will help him.\" His deep voice resonated in my chest; close as we were I felt his breath. I tried to untangle myself but he wouldn't let go. He pulled me thru the crowd, away from the man. As he led me away I glanced back. I saw the drunk stand, supported on the shoulder of a tall skinny guy dressed in some kind of Greek tunic. Suddenly I crashed into a wall. \"Oh sorry, I...\" His eyes silenced me. He'd found a gap in the crowd and now he held me close, the song felt eternal. He skillfully spun me around and drew me to him, sensually guiding my body with his. His body heat flamed, I felt warm and alive. His hands burned my skin, they shifted from my shoulder's and traced a line to my hips. I closed my eyes. As the music changed I came down from cloud nine and reality hit. That clock said 1 o'clock and I was screwed. I'd missed my call and my parents were probably calling the cops already. I looked up at him and those deep eyes focused on my face. \"You have to leave?\" I stubbornly closed my eyes again, \"No\" the song wasn't over yet. When the song ended I opened my eyes and the smoky, crowed room of before was gone. As he released me I backed away and caught the glimpse of his smirk as I spun taking in the room around me. Tapestries covered one wall in reds and blues as my feet sank into a plush carpet. Flames danced across my vision as I looked for an escape. My clothes were different as well. A skirt fell in tissue-like layers around me; the tightly fitted bodice laced up the front and was a red so deep that it blended into the black skirt below. My feet were bare. When I completed my spin a few seconds later he had advanced towards me. When I retreated he continued to walk towards me matching my movements step by step. \"You are calmer than I expected.\" His voice was still compelling but he actually had, was that a smile on his face? I was frozen, until he moved. I staggered back. I choked out words, \"I'm working up to a panic attack as we speak.\" He kept advancing. I kept retreating. I could feel my heartbeat in my chest. A quiet \"thump\" and I realized I'd hit a wall. \"You're not even screaming\" Okay he was definitely amused. \"Something tell's me...it's pointless.\" The stutter was accompanied by his moan as he fit his body to mine. \"You smell so good.\" He seized my hands sliding them up the wall behind me and holding them there. His hand encircled both of mine, I couldn't move an inch. I choked, \"Umm it's\" My breathed hitched again as he moved his nose down my neck tracing a line of flames across my skin. \"Mmm, spearmint?\" He readjusted and suddenly his face was inches from mine. His blue eyes were blazing with an unfamiliar gleam. \"Wh-\", He kissed me and I lost all train of thought. It was his lips on mine and nothing else. A moan escaped me as his lips moved against mine. \"Are you enjoying yourself?\" My outraged gasp was cut off as he trailed kisses down my neck, sliding his hand up my bare back to twist in my hair, pulling my head back. The brief moment it took him to speak brought me back to reality but, God he was good! He released my hands to wrap his arm around my waist pulling me in even closer his lips drifting back up my neck to nibble at my jaw. Then a few words from gym class floated through my mind, \"When in doubt S-I-N-G\", stomach, instep, nose, and groin. That combo took 4 seconds but damn was it effective. I heard him gasp as I pulled away. He fell back a few steps and I ran. I made it to the door before the rattling of the latch brought him to his senses. \"Stamato\" The word wasn't English but somehow I understood. \"Stop!\" I couldn't move. With one phrase I was ice. I could feel my heartbeat, feel the sudden chill on my skin but whatever connected my brain to my body was disconnected. \"What was that?\" His hand clenched around my throat and I struggled to breathe. His face was angry. I gasped for air. None entered my lungs. \"Huh! YOU WILL NEVER DEFY ME!\" He slammed me against the door and I choked. \"I can't, breath...stop please.\" My voice was only a whisper but I felt his grip loosen. I could see the words piling up behind his eyes, like a train slowing on the tracks. Slowly he lowered me to the ground and I inhaled sharply when he released me. I leaned against the door for support as he stalked away. He stopped at a curtain pushing it aside and disappearing from view, almost. While I caught my breath I studied my new surroundings. It was a long room, at the end the wind was fluttering the curtains that hung before a large balcony; I could see his silhouette thru the semi-transparent curtains. Embedded in a wall of bookcases was a marble fireplace with logs blazing giving off steady warmth. I could glimpse a bed through a door opposite the flames. Two large chairs stood before the fire. As I watched him my thoughts kept returning to the bed, the very large bed. It was built for two. Then I was on my knees, my breath was speeding up and my vision started to narrow, one bed. \"I guess that panic attack is a little closer to the surface then I thought.\" Suddenly he was in the room again. I scrambled back against the door. I held out my hands, \"Stop, please don't...\" He paused already halfway across the room. \"I am sorry. I lost my temper, that little maneuver of yours caught me off guard\" My breathing started to slow as the minutes ticked by. He had paused by the fire and in the bright light I studied him. My kidnapper wasn't old and bald as most of them were depicted. He was taller than my dad about 6ft 5'. He was wearing all black; if I had to guess and age...maybe 25? Older than he'd looked in that darkened room. His hair was a deep black and slid over his eyes when he titled his head. \"Would you like a drink?\" My spine straightened and I felt myself stand. \"You just tried to kill me and now you're offering me a drink! What was that? How, we were at that party and then, HOW DID I GET HERE?\" I cringed as I realize shouting at him wasn't a good plan. He was perfectly calm though and walked to a small table, pouring drinks even as I was stammering out questions. \"Good points. Let's see, I'm offering you a drink because I feel like I owe you one. Two,\" he started to walk towards me again and I jumped back. \"Two,\" he repeated, \", I don't want you dead. You're no match for me.\" I feel a chill run thru my body, remembering that brief moment when he had frozen me. \"And as for your third question, well I'll explain that after you've had a drink.\" With that he put a glass of something brown into my hands. Recovering from that brief moment of contact I waited for my heart to slow again, watching as he sat in a large armchair sitting in front of the fire. \"Please sit.\" I hesitated. Something in his gaze softened a touch as he watched me. \"I really am in control of myself.\" His voice was always seductive but he'd worked something soothing into his deep voice. \"Why am I here?\" I kept my voice calm but inwardly I was terrified. \"How did I get here?\" He shrugged, \"It's a perk of the job, walking everywhere takes a lot of time out of my day. And as the why, your parents have explained to you by now\", he stated. My forehead creased, \"Explained what exactly?\" There was a long moment of silence, it stretched unbroken for what felt like an age. \"They didn't tell you? You don't know?\" My voice came out like ice, \"Tell me what?\" He took a drink before he answered, looked at the level in the glass and drained the rest. \"When I told you my name you were so...calm. You didn't even flinch, I thought you were prepared.\" I flashed back to earlier when he had said, \"You are calmer than I expected\". God Damm it he'd been relieved not amused. \"Prepared?\" I was only capable of words in short spurts. If I said any more I might actually scream. \"For your life here....\" he coughed, was he nervous? \", as my wife\", \"SMASH\" As the shards of my glass danced across the floor I gaped at him. Setting his own glass down he stood and crushing the glass below his booted feet knocked my knees from under me. I was falling before I jerked to a stop. He held me cradled in his arms, easily walking to the fire. His face was inches from mine. \"Put me down\" He kept his eyes locked to mine releasing my legs. As I slide down his body he trailed his thumb across my cheek. \"I'm sorry. I thought you knew.\" I pulled back, \"You're sorry?\" Quickly stepping back to avoid my punch he nodded. \"Are you CRAZY? MY PARENTS, they wouldn't agree to, whatever this is.\" He sighed, \"Sit down please,\" when I remained there frozen in place, \"now!\" I sat. I was on one end of a loveseat, as I settled so did the layers of my dress as they shifted around me. My bare skin was warmed by the fire but I felt cold when he sat next to me. Who was he? He took my hands and cradled them in his holding me tight as I resisted. \"My name is Hades; I am the Lord of the Underworld.\" I interrupted my words spilling out in relief. \"But your already married so there is no reason for me to be here. You can send me home\" He kept his on mine gauging my reaction to each word before he continued. \"This is hard to explain but when people no longer believe in them gods..., well they cease to exist. Humans have never given up their belief in death so I continued to endure long after they perished. I watched my brothers and sisters die followed by their children.\" I let my confusion show so he clarified, \"The gods of Mount Olympus are not just legends Sara\" I pulled my hands out of his but he grabbed me before I could run. His fingers were burning into my skin. \"Don't be afraid, please don't be afraid. They passed long ago. There are only a few of us left.\" He guided me back down to the sofa and leaned towards me, \"Do you believe in destiny, fate? The Fates control all things Sara, they endured. Do you understand?\" \"I...I think so.\" I couldn't drag my eyes away from his face. \"Sara, eons ago they choose a bride for me, Persephone. But humans lost faith in her; they turned to science and logic. They did not believe in her and her...she left\" He looked away and I drug in a ragged breath, finally able to breathe again. \"I'm sorry, I really am.\" After I spoke we sat in silence, only moving when the clock rang out. One, twice, three times it chimed before silence resumed. \"She was my companion for many years. But the Fates remained even as the others faded and well they decided to meddle.\" His voice tightened and I could feel the tension as his hands tightened on my arms. I would find bruises there later. \"You don't like them do you?\" He smiled a grim, almost painful glance down at me. As he answered his eyes darkened, \"The Fates control all things and they have always been...tolerant towards me.\" His pupils were a flat black, the temperature dropped even further. \"After all I was the only Olympian who allowed them to dwell in my realm. The Fates felt my life was empty. They ordered Cupid to shoot an arrow.\" Cupid, wait a..., \"Cupid is the god of...of love?\" Though it sounded like a question I was already piecing together the answer. \"Yes, they requested and he complied.\" I couldn't meet his eyes, I felt my cheeks burn. I felt like every bone in my body was a live wire. \"What does that mean, exactly?\" His hands slid up my arms, ghosting across my shoulders before he tilted my chin back up to his. I shivered. \"It means...I belong to you.\" His eyes were burning into mine, \"I am yours, and I love you. I realize that's hard for you to accept...but according to, Greek custom I am you're...\" he stopped when he realized I wasn't breathing. \"Sara, Sara? Please answer me!\" I could see him shouting but the sound was a few seconds behind. I saw his lips move again and then my ears unsealed. \"I need....a minute\", I pulled away again and this time he released me. I stood and walked towards the balcony. As I wove between the furniture I felt his eyes on me. \"Sara...I won't hurt you I swear it.\" His voice was softer now, pained. I turned slowly as his words registered. He still sat on the couch. He didn't look like the god of death in that moment. He looked like a man and that scared me. \"I have read about the Greek gods. They weren't known for keeping their word.\" He stood, his long limbs unfolding slowly. As he stretched to his full height he radiated power. I felt it in the air between us. I felt cold again. I started trembling. When he noticed that he froze. \"Don't be afraid, not of me.\" Suddenly he closed the distance between us in a few quick movements. I was in his arms again. My arms were folded between and I was grateful for that little bit of space. Was he trying to comfort me? His arms were wrapped so tight around me I felt like he was trying to keep me from vanishing. I couldn't help it, I pushed away. Instantly I knew that was a mistake. He stiffened for a long moment before he relaxed. \"I keep my word Sara. I won't harm you. I swear it.\" He had leaned back so he could see my face and was peering into my eyes. The seconds passed but I didn't know what to say. He groaned and pulled me to him again. I felt the warmth of his skin, his heartbeat. He rested his chin on top of my head. I felt so small compared to him. \"Sara please say something.\" His voice was muffled now; his lips were pressed into my hair. My stomach growled. At that he lost it. He burst out laughing and I jumped back when he released me, startled. Hades continued to chuckle as he looked at me. \"Come on, let's have some breakfast.\" His hand dwarfed mine as he seized it, leading me to a small table. I looked at the clock; it was 9 in the morning. I think I stopped breathing again. \"Sara?\" his deep voice was worried again and I quickly sat down before he could grab me again. \"I'm fine, but, I've been here 8 hours?!\" Hades looked awkward as he sat opposite me. \"That is part of the magic of this place. Time moves differently here.\" My eyes met his and I lost my train of thought. They were so blue. Mentally slapping myself I focused. \"What do you mean? Am...am I? Am I dead? My parents... \"Do my parents, did they know...\" I stared into the flames; I could see my parent's faces in my mind. My dad's serious eyes and my mother's smile so unlike mine, hers was fleeting and so all the more treasured. Did they sentence me to this? Could they have known? Hades cleared his throat and I studied him again. The god of the Dead was my fiance? \"Your parents were informed of your fate before you were born. The Fates thought, since you would be raised in the modern world that you...they told your parents to raise you in the old ways.\" He reached for my hand. I flinched but he seized my hand in his again with a lightning fast movement. My body shut down, every instinct telling me to run, to run until I got away. Instead I pulled in a slow breath, looking pointedly at our hands. He didn't get the hint or he choose to ignore it. His fingers twisted in with mine, knotting us together. I stared at our hands, refusing to meet his eyes. \"Sara please. Don't shut me out. \"",

      "My embarrassment faded when I saw him choke.",
      "I guess the dress was working.",
      "My friends had talked me into it, throwing encouragement at me as they wrestled me into it.",
      "They promised me I'd get guys.",
      "I guess they were right.",
      "I followed his eyes down and blushed; the low-cut white dress clung to my curves in a way that left nothing to the imagination.",
      "The plunging bodice was intricately beaded to draw attention to what Megan insisted was my best asset.",
      "Just as he opened his mouth a battering ram hit me from behind sending me reeling forward against Hades.",
      "\"Nice costume!",
      "Are you my guardian angel?\"",
      "The drunk teen was completely plastered; there were stains down his shirt that were definatly vomit.",
      "His t-shirt said \"Hey Idiot\" his eyes were bloodshot, a typical college drunk.",
      "But my companion was not normal.",
      "He didn't threaten the guy but I looked at his face his face.",
      "Hades, that couldn't be his name, he was cold I felt his body chill and his eyes...they were.",
      "The nameless guy just turned and collapsed.",
      "I gasped, reaching for him as he fell.",
      "\"Others will help him.\"",
      "His deep voice resonated in my chest; close as we were I felt his breath.",
      "I tried to untangle myself but he wouldn't let go.",
      "He pulled me thru the crowd, away from the man.",
      "As he led me away I glanced back.",
      "I saw the drunk stand, supported on the shoulder of a tall skinny guy dressed in some kind of Greek tunic.",
      "Suddenly I crashed into a wall.",
      "\"Oh sorry, I...\" His eyes silenced me.",
      "He'd found a gap in the crowd and now he held me close, the song felt eternal.",
      "He skillfully spun me around and drew me to him, sensually guiding my body with his.",
      "His body heat flamed, I felt warm and alive.",
      "His hands burned my skin, they shifted from my shoulder's and traced a line to my hips.",
      "I closed my eyes.",
      "As the music changed I came down from cloud nine and reality hit.",
      "That clock said 1 o'clock and I was screwed.",
      "I'd missed my call and my parents were probably calling the cops already.",
      "I looked up at him and those deep eyes focused on my face.",
      "\"You have to leave?\" I stubbornly closed my eyes again, \"No\" the song wasn't over yet.",
      "When the song ended I opened my eyes and the smoky, crowed room of before was gone.",
      "As he released me I backed away and caught the glimpse of his smirk as I spun taking in the room around me.",
      "Tapestries covered one wall in reds and blues as my feet sank into a plush carpet.",
      "Flames danced across my vision as I looked for an escape.",
      "My clothes were different as well.",
      "A skirt fell in tissue-like layers around me; the tightly fitted bodice laced up the front and was a red so deep that it blended into the black skirt below.",
      "My feet were bare.",
      "When I completed my spin a few seconds later he had advanced towards me.",
      "When I retreated he continued to walk towards me matching my movements step by step.",
      "\"You are calmer than I expected.\"",
      "His voice was still compelling but he actually had, was that a smile on his face?",
      "I was frozen, until he moved.",
      "I staggered back.",
      "I choked out words, \"I'm working up to a panic attack as we speak.\"",
      "He kept advancing.",
      "I kept retreating.",
      "I could feel my heartbeat in my chest.",
      "A quiet \"thump\" and I realized I'd hit a wall.",
      "\"You're not even screaming\" Okay he was definitely amused.",
      "\"Something tell's me...it's pointless.\"",
      "The stutter was accompanied by his moan as he fit his body to mine.",
      "\"You smell so good.\"",
      "He seized my hands sliding them up the wall behind me and holding them there.",
      "His hand encircled both of mine, I couldn't move an inch.",
      "I choked, \"Umm it's\" My breathed hitched again as he moved his nose down my neck tracing a line of flames across my skin.",
      "\"Mmm, spearmint?\"",
      "He readjusted and suddenly his face was inches from mine.",
      "His blue eyes were blazing with an unfamiliar gleam.",
      "\"Wh-\", He kissed me and I lost all train of thought.",
      "It was his lips on mine and nothing else.",
      "A moan escaped me as his lips moved against mine.",
      "\"Are you enjoying yourself?\"",
      "My outraged gasp was cut off as he trailed kisses down my neck, sliding his hand up my bare back to twist in my hair, pulling my head back.",
      "The brief moment it took him to speak brought me back to reality but, God he was good!",
      "He released my hands to wrap his arm around my waist pulling me in even closer his lips drifting back up my neck to nibble at my jaw.",
      "Then a few words from gym class floated through my mind, \"When in doubt S-I-N-G\", stomach, instep, nose, and groin.",
      "That combo took 4 seconds but damn was it effective.",
      "I heard him gasp as I pulled away.",
      "He fell back a few steps and I ran.",
      "I made it to the door before the rattling of the latch brought him to his senses.",
      "\"Stamato\" The word wasn't English but somehow I understood.",
      "\"Stop!\"",
      "I couldn't move.",
      "With one phrase I was ice.",
      "I could feel my heartbeat, feel the sudden chill on my skin but whatever connected my brain to my body was disconnected.",
      "\"What was that?\"",
      "His hand clenched around my throat and I struggled to breathe.",
      "His face was angry.",
      "I gasped for air.",
      "None entered my lungs.",
      "\"Huh!",
      "YOU WILL NEVER DEFY ME!\"",
      "He slammed me against the door and I choked.",
      "\"I can't, breath...stop please.\"",
      "My voice was only a whisper but I felt his grip loosen.",
      "I could see the words piling up behind his eyes, like a train slowing on the tracks.",
      "Slowly he lowered me to the ground and I inhaled sharply when he released me.",
      "I leaned against the door for support as he stalked away.",
      "He stopped at a curtain pushing it aside and disappearing from view, almost.",
      "While I caught my breath I studied my new surroundings.",
      "It was a long room, at the end the wind was fluttering the curtains that hung before a large balcony; I could see his silhouette thru the semi-transparent curtains.",
      "Embedded in a wall of bookcases was a marble fireplace with logs blazing giving off steady warmth.",
      "I could glimpse a bed through a door opposite the flames.",
      "Two large chairs stood before the fire.",
      "As I watched him my thoughts kept returning to the bed, the very large bed.",
      "It was built for two.",
      "Then I was on my knees, my breath was speeding up and my vision started to narrow, one bed.",
      "\"I guess that panic attack is a little closer to the surface then I thought.\"",
      "Suddenly he was in the room again.",
      "I scrambled back against the door.",
      "I held out my hands, \"Stop, please don't...\" He paused already halfway across the room.",
      "\"I am sorry.",
      "I lost my temper, that little maneuver of yours caught me off guard\" My breathing started to slow as the minutes ticked by.",
      "He had paused by the fire and in the bright light I studied him.",
      "My kidnapper wasn't old and bald as most of them were depicted.",
      "He was taller than my dad about 6ft 5'.",
      "He was wearing all black; if I had to guess and age...maybe 25?",
      "Older than he'd looked in that darkened room.",
      "His hair was a deep black and slid over his eyes when he titled his head.",
      "\"Would you like a drink?\"",
      "My spine straightened and I felt myself stand.",
      "\"You just tried to kill me and now you're offering me a drink!",
      "What was that?",
      "How, we were at that party and then, HOW DID I GET HERE?\" I cringed as I realize shouting at him wasn't a good plan.",
      "He was perfectly calm though and walked to a small table, pouring drinks even as I was stammering out questions.",
      "\"Good points.",
      "Let's see, I'm offering you a drink because I feel like I owe you one.",
      "Two,\" he started to walk towards me again and I jumped back.",
      "\"Two,\" he repeated, \", I don't want you dead.",
      "You're no match for me.\"",
      "I feel a chill run thru my body, remembering that brief moment when he had frozen me.",
      "\"And as for your third question, well I'll explain that after you've had a drink.\"",
      "With that he put a glass of something brown into my hands.",
      "Recovering from that brief moment of contact I waited for my heart to slow again, watching as he sat in a large armchair sitting in front of the fire.",
      "\"Please sit.\"",
      "I hesitated.",
      "Something in his gaze softened a touch as he watched me.",
      "\"I really am in control of myself.\"",
      "His voice was always seductive but he'd worked something soothing into his deep voice.",
      "\"Why am I here?\"",
      "I kept my voice calm but inwardly I was terrified.",
      "\"How did I get here?\"",
      "He shrugged, \"It's a perk of the job, walking everywhere takes a lot of time out of my day.",
      "And as the why, your parents have explained to you by now\", he stated.",
      "My forehead creased, \"Explained what exactly?\"",
      "There was a long moment of silence, it stretched unbroken for what felt like an age.",
      "\"They didn't tell you?",
      "You don't know?\"",
      "My voice came out like ice, \"Tell me what?\"",
      "He took a drink before he answered, looked at the level in the glass and drained the rest.",
      "\"When I told you my name you were so...calm.",
      "You didn't even flinch, I thought you were prepared.\"",
      "I flashed back to earlier when he had said, \"You are calmer than I expected\".",
      "God Damm it he'd been relieved not amused.",
      "\"Prepared?\"",
      "I was only capable of words in short spurts.",
      "If I said any more I might actually scream.",
      "\"For your life here....\" he coughed, was he nervous?",
      "\", as my wife\", \"SMASH\"",
      "As the shards of my glass danced across the floor I gaped at him.",
      "Setting his own glass down he stood and crushing the glass below his booted feet knocked my knees from under me.",
      "I was falling before I jerked to a stop.",
      "He held me cradled in his arms, easily walking to the fire.",
      "His face was inches from mine.",
      "\"Put me down\" He kept his eyes locked to mine releasing my legs.",
      "As I slide down his body he trailed his thumb across my cheek.",
      "\"I'm sorry.",
      "I thought you knew.\"",
      "I pulled back, \"You're sorry?\"",
      "Quickly stepping back to avoid my punch he nodded.",
      "\"Are you CRAZY?",
      "MY PARENTS, they wouldn't agree to, whatever this is.\"",
      "He sighed, \"Sit down please,\" when I remained there frozen in place, \"now!\"",
      "I sat.",
      "I was on one end of a loveseat, as I settled so did the layers of my dress as they shifted around me.",
      "My bare skin was warmed by the fire but I felt cold when he sat next to me.",
      "Who was he?",
      "He took my hands and cradled them in his holding me tight as I resisted.",
      "\"My name is Hades; I am the Lord of the Underworld.\"",
      "I interrupted my words spilling out in relief.",
      "\"But your already married so there is no reason for me to be here.",
      "You can send me home\" He kept his on mine gauging my reaction to each word before he continued.",
      "\"This is hard to explain but when people no longer believe in them gods..., well they cease to exist.",
      "Humans have never given up their belief in death so I continued to endure long after they perished.",
      "I watched my brothers and sisters die followed by their children.\"",
      "I let my confusion show so he clarified, \"The gods of Mount Olympus are not just legends Sara\" I pulled my hands out of his but he grabbed me before I could run.",
      "His fingers were burning into my skin.",
      "\"Don't be afraid, please don't be afraid.",
      "They passed long ago.",
      "There are only a few of us left.\"",
      "He guided me back down to the sofa and leaned towards me, \"Do you believe in destiny, fate?",
      "The Fates control all things Sara, they endured.",
      "Do you understand?\"",
      "\"I...I think so.\"",
      "I couldn't drag my eyes away from his face.",
      "\"Sara, eons ago they choose a bride for me, Persephone.",
      "But humans lost faith in her; they turned to science and logic.",
      "They did not believe in her and her...she left\" He looked away and I drug in a ragged breath, finally able to breathe again.",
      "\"I'm sorry, I really am.\"",
      "After I spoke we sat in silence, only moving when the clock rang out.",
      "One, twice, three times it chimed before silence resumed.",
      "\"She was my companion for many years.",
      "But the Fates remained even as the others faded and well they decided to meddle.\"",
      "His voice tightened and I could feel the tension as his hands tightened on my arms.",
      "I would find bruises there later.",
      "\"You don't like them do you?\"",
      "He smiled a grim, almost painful glance down at me.",
      "As he answered his eyes darkened, \"The Fates control all things and they have always been...tolerant towards me.\"",
      "His pupils were a flat black, the temperature dropped even further.",
      "\"After all I was the only Olympian who allowed them to dwell in my realm.",
      "The Fates felt my life was empty.",
      "They ordered Cupid to shoot an arrow.\"",
      "Cupid, wait a..., \"Cupid is the god of...of love?\"",
      "Though it sounded like a question I was already piecing together the answer.",
      "\"Yes, they requested and he complied.\"",
      "I couldn't meet his eyes, I felt my cheeks burn.",
      "I felt like every bone in my body was a live wire.",
      "\"What does that mean, exactly?\"",
      "His hands slid up my arms, ghosting across my shoulders before he tilted my chin back up to his.",
      "I shivered.",
      "\"It means...I belong to you.\"",
      "His eyes were burning into mine, \"I am yours, and I love you.",
      "I realize that's hard for you to accept...but according to, Greek custom I am you're...\" he stopped when he realized I wasn't breathing.",
      "\"Sara, Sara?",
      "Please answer me!\"",
      "I could see him shouting but the sound was a few seconds behind.",
      "I saw his lips move again and then my ears unsealed.",
      "\"I need....a minute\", I pulled away again and this time he released me.",
      "I stood and walked towards the balcony.",
      "As I wove between the furniture I felt his eyes on me.",
      "\"Sara...I won't hurt you I swear it.\"",
      "His voice was softer now, pained.",
      "I turned slowly as his words registered.",
      "He still sat on the couch.",
      "He didn't look like the god of death in that moment.",
      "He looked like a man and that scared me.",
      "\"I have read about the Greek gods.",
      "They weren't known for keeping their word.\"",
      "He stood, his long limbs unfolding slowly.",
      "As he stretched to his full height he radiated power.",
      "I felt it in the air between us.",
      "I felt cold again.",
      "I started trembling.",
      "When he noticed that he froze.",
      "\"Don't be afraid, not of me.\"",
      "Suddenly he closed the distance between us in a few quick movements.",
      "I was in his arms again.",
      "My arms were folded between and I was grateful for that little bit of space.",
      "Was he trying to comfort me?",
      "His arms were wrapped so tight around me I felt like he was trying to keep me from vanishing.",
      "I couldn't help it, I pushed away.",
      "Instantly I knew that was a mistake.",
      "He stiffened for a long moment before he relaxed.",
      "\"I keep my word Sara.",
      "I won't harm you.",
      "I swear it.\"",
      "He had leaned back so he could see my face and was peering into my eyes.",
      "The seconds passed but I didn't know what to say.",
      "He groaned and pulled me to him again.",
      "I felt the warmth of his skin, his heartbeat.",
      "He rested his chin on top of my head.",
      "I felt so small compared to him.",
      "\"Sara please say something.\"",
      "His voice was muffled now; his lips were pressed into my hair.",
      "My stomach growled.",
      "At that he lost it.",
      "He burst out laughing and I jumped back when he released me, startled.",
      "Hades continued to chuckle as he looked at me.",
      "\"Come on, let's have some breakfast.\"",
      "His hand dwarfed mine as he seized it, leading me to a small table.",
      "I looked at the clock; it was 9 in the morning.",
      "I think I stopped breathing again.",
      "\"Sara?\" his deep voice was worried again and I quickly sat down before he could grab me again.",
      "\"I'm fine, but, I've been here 8 hours?!\"",
      "Hades looked awkward as he sat opposite me.",
      "\"That is part of the magic of this place.",
      "Time moves differently here.\"",
      "My eyes met his and I lost my train of thought.",
      "They were so blue.",
      "Mentally slapping myself I focused.",
      "\"What do you mean?",
      "Am...am I?",
      "Am I dead?",
      "My parents...",
      "\"Do my parents, did they know...\" I stared into the flames; I could see my parent's faces in my mind.",
      "My dad's serious eyes and my mother's smile so unlike mine, hers was fleeting and so all the more treasured.",
      "Did they sentence me to this?",
      "Could they have known?",
      "Hades cleared his throat and I studied him again.",
      "The god of the Dead was my fiance?",
      "\"Your parents were informed of your fate before you were born.",
      "The Fates thought, since you would be raised in the modern world that you...they told your parents to raise you in the old ways.\"",
      "He reached for my hand.",
      "I flinched but he seized my hand in his again with a lightning fast movement.",
      "My body shut down, every instinct telling me to run, to run until I got away.",
      "Instead I pulled in a slow breath, looking pointedly at our hands.",
      "He didn't get the hint or he choose to ignore it.",
      "His fingers twisted in with mine, knotting us together.",
      "I stared at our hands, refusing to meet his eyes.",
      "\"Sara please.",

    "text": "Persephone loathes the springtime. When she returns to Olympus, her gut clenches and her nerves fray with every step she takes. Her mother's heart aches for her, but she can no longer stop the overwhelming disgust that permeates her mind. The thought of destroying every being on the mountain fills her with rage. The ichor that swims through her veins tightens around her throat and seizes her chest until she lurches forward and vomits on Aphrodite's sandals. \"What troubles you, my child?\" Demeter asks, after placing Persephone in her lush bed, flowers surrounding her like a halo. The fragrance causes her to gag, but she swallows back the bile. She shakes her head. Persephone wants to bury herself in the dirt and return to the land of the dead. All she can think about is the smell that wafts from her husband; that sickly smell of sweet rot and charred souls. That night she rubs herself raw, fingers dancing wickedly across her swollen bundle of nerves. She teases herself until her back arches, her muscles spasming on her husband's phantom cock, and chokes back a series of moans that will surely wake the dead. The next morning, no one meets her gaze as she slowly eats her fresh figs and drinks her ambrosia on lavish pillows. No one disturbs her when she paints her cheeks with rouge or stains her lips with the juices of a pomegranate. Nobody mentions the way she deliberately coils yellow asphodel on her head like a diadem of death. Her fixation causes a hunger in the depths of her belly and nothing will quench her thirst. -- Artemis is the first to approach her, hesitantly and patiently. With an arrow tightly in her grasp, she asks, \"What ails you, sister-cousin?\" Persephone raises an elegant eyebrow with a toothy, wide smile. \"Nothing, of course.\" Artemis nods. She clears her throat, signaling her departure but is held back by something. -- Athena is the second to approach her, smirking and grinning. With a spear loosely in her grasp, she says, \"Tell me.\" Persephone, once more, lifts an eyebrow lazily. She lets out a long sigh, before addressing Athena. \"I have nothing to hide.\" She continues to weave asphodel in her long locks. -- Months pass, and her sister-cousins' questions become more of an irritant than she thought they would. But Persephone uses this to her advantage. With glowing eyes, she touches herself at night. Slipping two fingers in her leaking slit, Persephone brings herself to orgasm until her limbs shudder violently and her glowing eyes are bright with pleasure. She can hear others whispering from behind walls and doors, from between the glittering columns of Olympus' citadel, she can hear it all. -- \"What has he done to you?\" Zeus, her father, asks brusquely. With a lightning bolt strapped to his back, he moves closer. \"What has he done to you?\" Persephone smiles at Zeus. \"Whoever are you speaking of?\" she asks coyly. Her hands braid intricate knots in her hair, weaving flowers and yellow topaz in between the strands. \"My brother, your kidnapper?\" Once again, Zeus is blunt, anger pulsing from his hands like electricity. Persephone's smile only grows bigger. \"Hades is a fair god, a beautiful god. He has treated me wonderfully.\" She looks at a plait in her hands, tying the end with a darkened vine. \"Better than any of you treat each other.\" Her eyes flicker up to Zeus and that's when he can see that strange glint in her eyes. A dark cloud layered over her spirit. He's seen it before, in the eyes of his youngest brother. -- \"I've heard the great Hades has corrupted the beautiful, springtime princess,\" a smooth contralto voice drawls. Persephone does not look up, only gives one of her eerie smiles. \"And who is spreading this clandestine secret?\" The woman chuckles, low and saccharine. \"Zeus, and others,\" she comments. Moving closer, she sits down on the bed next to Persephone's relaxed body. Eris leans over, crawling and caging Persephone's body beneath her. \"Zeus has entrusted me with the task of watching you.\" \"And will you go back to our father and tell him all the things you find out,\" Persephone grins. Eris whispers, teeth gleaming in the candlelight, \"Everything has a price, sister dearest.\"",

    "text": "The Executioner's Tale It was raining. No. Scratch that. Raining would imply that there was some hope of an end in sight. Maybe if it had let up after the first day, sure, but alas, it had not. It was absolutely pouring and it had been for the last three days. Great sheets of water were coming down so hard, that when caught by the force of the howling wind, the droplets actually became something more like monstrous projectiles. The skies were a dreary gray, and it had been the kind of week where everyone had managed to come up with one excuse or another to stay indoors. Although, it wasn't as if the village was any kind of tourist attraction, even on the best of days. Hell, market day was probably the only time the townspeople bothered to do much of anything, and that was only on the off chance that the King actually found it in himself to care from one week to the next. The highlight of activity for these parts over the last couple of months had been centered on the burgeoning efforts of a few 'concerned' citizens to try and improve the kingdom's political situation. Somehow, possibly by fate's good fortune, tales of these activists' more 'daring' activities had begun to make the rounds throughout the surrounding villages, inspiring more townsfolk to take up the cause--in ever increasing number. The King was, naturally, livid. The very idea that anyone under his governance would have the gall to rise up against him was not simply abhorrent but downright treacherous. He ruled his land with an iron fist, as any show of weakness on his part would be inviting the neighboring kingdoms in the northern territories to attempt to usurp his power and his throne. As such, it just so happened that, recently, the King had seen fortune shine in his favor. A young brigand from that self-same northern territory had been apprehended trying to sneak his way into the castle, and as a result, was summarily tossed into the stocks and sentenced to hang at sunset. It was with this in mind that the village executioner trudged into the town's only pub, his waterlogged boots squeaking and squishing as he went. He made his way over to the bar and plopped himself onto a stool without ceremony. His appearance was haggard, which belied his already exhausted countenance and sour disposition. Aside from the fact that the weather was horribly bleak, the man was not known to have had a moment's peace in months. The King, after all, did so love to make examples of those that defied him, much to the executioner's beleaguered chagrin. And yet, he was exactly where Gods wanted him: vulnerable to manipulation and easily swayed with the promise of copious amounts of 'liquid encouragement'. Aphrodite had been working towards gaining the man's affection for quite some time, though her intentions towards him were anything but amorous. She had her sights set on the imprisoned thief set to meet the noose in a few hours. Unfortunately, it seemed as though her idiot husband couldn't get enough of making her life miserable by continuously making it his mission to sabotage her every effort. The man actually had the gall to claim he was doing so all in the name of 'love and war'. Apparently, he had a reputation to uphold, or some such nonsense as the oh-so-villainous Ares, God of War, and if he let these two obviously hot-headed kingdoms join together in peace, then he'd look bad. Because, Zeus forbid, the mortals wind up not killing each other for once. The pompous blowhard. And so, here they were, in the guise of random townsfolk and seated on either side of the clueless human, each trying to influence him towards their ultimate, very different goals. Aphrodite knew exactly why the brigand had stolen into the castle, and it wasn't to create political unrest, even though that's what the King thought, and ultimately what Ares needed everyone to believe in order to fan the flames even higher. The boy had come to the castle that night in secret to see the King's daughter; the very lovely, very betrothed Princess, who was set to wed the son of the King of the southern territories. It was to be an amicable arrangement to unite the two kingdoms, but Aphrodite wasn't having any of it. The Princess was a loyal acolyte and she knew through the woman's prayers that she did not love this southern Prince, for her heart belonged to the man from the north. The Goddess of Love was never one to back down easily, especially to the likes of her egotistical husband, so she was not about to give up any time soon. Her plan was to convince the executioner to take pity on the poor boy and help him to escape, but Ares was doing everything in his power to convince the man otherwise. As a matter of fact, he'd plied the mortal with so much alcohol, the poor sod could barely stand. Well, she reasoned, if that was how it was going to be, then she was just going to have to take the bull by the horns, so to speak. That evening, precisely at sundown, the execution went off without incident. The terrified young man was quietly led to the gallows where he was hung by the neck and left on display in the plaza as a lesson against any further disloyalty. The Princess, though, was oddly absent from the entire affair. Late that evening, once the village was silent and at rest, Ares was making his way from the pub in nothing less than a drunken stupor, when out of the corner of his eye, he noticed a horse with two riders sprinting off in the distance. He wasn't so far gone that he couldn't make out who it was; the princess' clothing was, after all, hard to miss. Jaw going slack in a state of abject shock and utter confusion, Ares turned towards the gallows only to find--nothing. The thief's body was gone. There could only be one explanation: he was never there to begin with. Aphrodite had freed him and taken his place. More than likely, the two lovers would wed in secret and then use that as an impetus to broker an accord between their kingdoms. Of all the insufferable... Suddenly, before he even had to opportunity to gather his wits about himself, the winds picked up slightly and tickled at his neck, a soft, silken voice whispering at his ear, \"nice try, dear husband, but all is fair in love and war....\"",

    "text": "Hades and Persephone: Demeter Seeks Her Daughter Time has become meaningless for me. Hours and days are less a blur and more an afterthought. I cannot remember when last I sipped the sweetest nectar or dined on the finest ambrosia, not that these Olympian rarities ever did bring me much joy, regardless of my station. My daughter and I, we have always taken our nourishment, of mind and body, from the plentiful Earth, this very mortal realm that has always reaped the benefits of my bounty. But, alas, I feel as though I am devoid of any remaining good will and benevolence that my notable lineage might have endowed me. Nine days and nights have passed since my gentle, radiant Persephone was taken, seized most heinously against her will by Hades, lord of the Underworld and keeper of Tartarus' wretched souls, under the eye of her father, the almighty Zeus, himself. King of Gods and ruler of men. Even now, as I soar high above the world, casting my sight to the farthest reaches and the darkest corners, still she is lost to me. What bittersweet irony that I, Demeter, mother of the golden sword and goddess of the grain, who would bring such splendid harvest, and whose followers would supplicate themselves for the merest semblance of a gentle breeze, should be unable to work my will over this land that, that I had hoped, even the slightest way, would show me favor. In truth, the burden of fault for this horrid design is mine alone to carry. Long had I known of Zeus' wish to betroth my daughter to a suitor of some divine standing amongst our lot, yet I steadfastly refused such a notion with utmost vehemence. Surely He found this continued reluctance to be increasingly aggravating, but I would sooner consign myself to the depths of hell itself than sacrifice my only daughter to a fate worse than death. Zeus would see fit to auction her as though she were the basest animal, without independent mind or thought and trap her in an unwilling, loveless marriage. Even as a goddess in our circle, she would be reduced to nothing more than a slave. Still he came for her, Hades, the nightmarish fiend. Perhaps he would make her his queen, but no matter, for upon bestowing her with such a title, he would take in trade her immortal soul. I have searched relentlessly the mortal realm and torn apart the gilded halls of Mount Olympus, to no avail. Neither God nor mortal would speak, and before long, a resounding pain did grip my heart as I prepared to visit upon them all the force of my grief. But on the tenth day, Hekate of the Moon did come to me with sadness in her heart and bade me take audience with Helios, because under his watchful eye, truth of the matter was quite assured. And so, with utmost reverence and humility did I go to him, he who would hold the sun in his hands; he whom I had known as a babe in his father's arms and now as a God, seeking a balm to my suffering. I had hoped that lingering fondness would serve to move him towards the knowledge I sought, a merciful kindness on my heart. Fortune was cruel this day, however, as my suspicions were confirmed. Zeus had promised my daughter to Hades, her hand in marriage, as if she were a prized head of cattle. He seized her by brute force from our divine meadow and with his chariot, took her into his realm of darkness. He spoke of this lightly, and with little care, as though I should be grateful that my only child be joined to a lord of such high and fearsome quality. He believed me to have no reason to complain, as though I would ever accept a horror to befall my daughter. Perhaps it is not that we are goddesses, but that we are women, the lesser in their minds, that we have no choice but to allow their boot heels ion our backs, driving us to our knees before their supposed superiority? Queen Hera would die before allowing such an indignity upon herself, which explains quite obviously why her union with Zeus is filled with such venomous discord. It is unfortunate for them that they underestimate my wrath. Broken heart. Shattered soul. My grief will devastate this land with a resounding wail as icy tears rain down to crack the flesh of the earth and the winds batter them into submission. The cold will seep into their bones and chill them to their deaths as I watch the land become dry and brittle and they weep the tears of my pain.",

    "text": "It was interesting, seeing him in action; it was a never-ending series of victories against man - mortal and immortal alike. While being something she'd found tiresome in the past, watching him in his area of expertise had quickly become one of her favorite past times. Athena found herself watching match after match, growing more and more amused. While he had far more skill and brute force, Athena could easily pick out every weak spot only someone as trained in battle strategy as she, could have picked up on. She could have had him on his back in a matter of seconds if she wanted. \"You should really stop gawking, father might actually catch you one of these days.\" Athena could already feel the ache in her temples. \"There is nothing to catch... What do you want, Aphrodite?\" The dark haired Goddess of Love and Beauty smirked, slinking up to her sister's side and peered over the balcony, \"I wonder what father would think, his most precious daughter and the hated son. The scandal.\" Athena's head spun towards Aphrodite, eyes widening just a fraction as she breathed, \"Aphrodite.\" \"Relax, sister,\" Aphrodite sighed, throwing an arm around Athena's shoulders, \"I will not breathe a word of your little escapade to father.\" Athena eyed her warily, \"What is it you want, Aphrodite?\" \"I wish for you to accompany me tonight.\" Aphrodite smirked, dark eyes filled with mischief, \"Dionysus is... infiltrating the celebration of your adored mortal tonight. He plans on throwing an interesting little tournament of sorts for a few of us Gods after the event.\" \"Diomedes' coronation ceremony is not Dionysus' playground.\" Athena spat, growing quickly irritated with her sister. \"Why would you want me there?\" \"Well, that information is for later.\" Aphrodite answered, \"But you would be happy to know that your lovely Ares shall be attending.\" Athena's head tilted back towards the palaestra where Ares had defeated another one of his many opponents. \"I highly doubt he would attend of his own volition.\" \"Of course not.\" Aphrodite scoffed, \"But it is Dionysus we are speaking of.\" Athena grimaced, but nodded; the two Gods were damn near inseparable --- though not without much protest from Ares. Dionysus always did all he could to ensure that Ares would accompany him wherever it was that he went. It was something Athena had always found to be rather amusing; who would ever think the God of War to be such good friends with the God of Wine? \"I still don't find a single reason for me to be there.\" Athena sighed. \"Oh? Even the presence of your precious Ares is not enough to sway you?\" Aphrodite teased, pulling her arm back and leaning against the balcony once more. \"Ares is not my precious anything, Aphrodite.\" Athena sighed, \"That... That was a one time thing. It shall not be happening again.\" \"You fool yourself.\" Aphrodite laughed, crossing her arms over her chest, \"But you cannot fool me. I know you, Athena, and even more so, I know Love.\" The word left Athena itching to get as far away from the topic as possible; this was something she could not afford to get into with Aphrodite. Partially because it was an argument she would lose and she hated losing, but mostly because Love was Aphrodite's forte, and Athena was more terrified of hearing the truth in regards to this than she was of anything else. \"Just stop talking, I will go.\" Athena quipped, not giving her sister the chance to continue. \"Lovely!\" Aphrodite chimed, pushing herself away from the balcony with a smirk on her bright red lips, \"You would do well to stop by my chambers before night falls. I simply refuse to let you dress yourself tonight.\" With that, she was gone, leaving Athena wondering what it was, exactly, that she had just gotten herself into.. Her gaze had been burning holes into his skin; Ares had done well in keeping his gaze from straying towards her, but he could feel it. The intensity of it and how he wished he could pull his attention from the match at hand to catch her off guard. He had no doubts that she thought she was being subtle in her observations. That she thought he had not the faintest of clues just how often she watched him. As if he could remain ignorant to the things her gaze alone did to him. Blasted woman. He supposed he ought to damn Dionysus and Aphrodite instead. Their schemes had been the start of it all. He was finding it easier to understand why the two of them were ever involved. Aphrodite might have been the more prominently devious of the two, but his friend was just as devious, he just happened to be far more subtle in all that he did. \"Ares!\" He paused, his sharp gaze flying towards one of the many seats in the palaestra where Dionysus sat, lazy grin on his lips. \"I think you've given our friend there a well enough beating. You don't want to kill him now, and face Athena's wrath, do you?\" Blinking, Ares turned his attention to his opponent. He had Hermes on his knees, the sharp edge of his blade digging into the skin of his neck. In a swift movement, Ares released the man and took a step back, trying to remember when the messenger of the Gods had entered the palaestra. \"Apologies, Hermes.\" \"Just remind me never to interrupt when you're in the middle of battle.\" he answered, reaching up to wipe some blood from the corner of his lips. \"I simply wanted to inform you and Dionysus that Athena will in fact be attending tonight's celebrations, but aside from the two of you wanting her there for whatever reasons--\" Hermes gave both Ares and Dionysus pointed looks before continuing, \"--Aphrodite seemed rather intent on her attendance. She managed to convince Athena to attend and sent me away without allowing me speak to her.\" Ares' brows furrowed and he led Hermes over to Dionysus, making sure they were not overheard by anyone else. \"Have you any idea what Aphrodite might be up to?\" Hermes shook his head, \"I do not. But it's doubtful that it will be anything good. She has hidden it well, but she is incredibly bitter about Zeus' announcement to unite her with Hephaestus.\" Ares let out an irritated sigh, \"I would imagine so, but I have no wish to become another pawn in one of her many schemes. I need to speak with Athena without any interruptions tonight.\" \"She will avoid you, Ares, you know it.\" Dionysus finally spoke up. \"She has been doing it rather well for many moons now.\" Ares glared at his friend, who simply grinned back at him, knowing very well that it had been his scheming that had brought about all this insanity in the first place. \"She will not be able to avoid me during the tournament. She will be my opponent.\" Dionysus rose a dark brow, \"Will she now?\" \"You will make it so, Dionysus. You owe me that much.\" Ares spat, \"If anything, you owe me more for all that has occurred because of you and your meddling.\" Ares knew Dionysus wouldn't argue; the matches were to be picked at random, but with Dionysus hosting the event, there was no doubt that the God of Wine could easily make things go the way he wanted them to. With a heavy sigh, Dionysus nodded, \"Fair point. You shall have your match with Athena. Just do not go throwing the blame on me when she puts you on your ass.\" Ares scoffed, \"Not likely.\" He did not think she could best him in battle; she was strategic, observant, intelligent, but she did not possess the strength to do so on her own. It was one of the many reasons he was at the front line of a battle and she lingered in the background, giving orders instead of following them. He would enjoy putting her in her place tonight.. Athena had refused to leave her bed chamber after Aphrodite's departure; her mind was spinning. Things between herself and the God of War were rocky enough as it was, the last thing she needed was her sister meddling in things that were none of her business. Sighing softly, Athena ran a lithe hand through her hair, wondering how she had let things turn into such a mess. They had been enemies; granted, they had never actually met, but they had been on opposite sides more than enough to warrant the title. He craved battle. Reveled in it. Needed it. Without it, he would have surely gone mad. She would have been completely fine never coming face to face with such a brute, but the Fates had other plans. Athena had allowed herself to be swayed by Aphrodite --- something Athena really ought to quit allowing her to do --- and had been dragged down to the mortal plane to indulge in some frivolities. The true purpose of that visit currently escaped her, but by the end of it, she was damning Dionysus and whatever it was he slipped into the spirits all while trying to make a silent escape from the God of War's bed. She avoided him for many moons after that, very aware that Aphrodite was doing all she could to make Athena miserable after finding out what had happened. 'What would father say? Precious little Athena not so Virgin after all.' She loved her sister, she really did, but from the moment she'd met the God of War, Aphrodite seemed far more spiteful towards Athena than usual, and it was disturbing. What had she done to deserve such treatment? She didn't know. \"Have you been standing there since I left?\" Athena willed herself to remain calm, gaze glued to the now empty palaestra as she answered Aphrodite's question, \"Does it matter?\" \"Not really, no.\" her sister chimed, coming up beside her, \"It is simply dreadfully depressing. Either way, I told you to come by my chambers before nightfall. We're going to be late.\" \"We would have been just fine if you didn't insist on dressing me.\" Athena countered, finally relenting and turning to face her sister, \"Shall we go then? I would prefer to speak to Diomedes at least once before you drag me into the insanity that will no doubt ensue.\" \"Such little faith in me.\" Aphrodite brought a hand to her chest, feigning a look of hurt. \"We are Gods, Aphrodite. Throw enough of us together and chaos becomes inevitable. It has nothing to do with lack of faith in you.\" Athena answered with a roll of her eyes. Aphrodite linked her arm with Athena's, leading the way, \"Well, that is why we have you then. To balance out the chaos.\" \"Comforting.\" Athena answered dryly. \"You cannot complain when you refuse to join us more often than not.\" Aphrodite countered as they reached her bed chamber. Once they were past the red silk curtains, Aphrodite ushered Athena towards her bed and quickly went to looking through her things. \"Yes, just like you cannot blame me for being who I am.\" Athena sighed, \"It would be like me telling you to abstain from your more carnal pleasures, or to stop trifling in matters of Love. We are who we are, Aphrodite, there is no changing that.\" \"Spare me the lecture.\" Aphrodite called, popping back up with a gorgeous, powder blue silk gown that looked a little too small for Athena's tastes. \"You will enjoy yourself tonight. You have done it before, you can do it again.\" \"Need I remind you that the first time it happened, it ended in the deflowering of a Virgin Goddess and the second time ended in her bedding her enemy?\" Athena scowled, pushing herself to her feet and reaching for the silky gown in Aphrodite's hands. \"Remind me to thank Dionysus for both occurrences.\" Aphrodite answered with a grin. \"Now go on, put it on.\" Athena scowled, shedding her armor and clothing, and slipping into the soft, silk gown. \"Why am I being forced to wear a gown when there's going to be a tournament?\" \"You complain far too much for a Goddess, has anyone ever told you that?\" Aphrodite asked, carefully circling her sister and coming to a halt in front of her when she seemed satisfied enough, \"You are going to see your precious mortal. It's going to be a celebration for his coronation, you must look your best.\" \"I would not complain half as much if I was not so sure you were up to something.\" Athena grumbled, crossing her arms over her chest, feeling strangely nude in such a thin piece of clothing; the gown was long, it fell well past her feet and bunched up on the marble floor, a slit making its way up to her thigh on the left side. It was a little snug, if only because she was not the slightest bit used to wearing things Aphrodite liked to wear, but otherwise fit well enough. The straps resting on her shoulders were a little loose, but she was positive they were supposed to be falling off her shoulder and resting on her arms instead, but she did not touch. She knew Aphrodite would fix her up right, even if she wasn't the slightest bit comfortable. \"There is that lack of faith again.\" Aphrodite quipped, a wicked grin on her lips as she delved back into her things, returning with a gold sash that she quickly tied around Athena's waist. Once she was done with that, just as Athena suspected she would, Aphrodite flicked the straps off of Athena's shoulders and took a step back, looking at her in concentration. \"It is not lack of faith.\" Athena mumbled, \"Simply well circulated knowledge that you only ever insist on my showing up somewhere if you are planning something. Usually something that you could taunt me with for eons to come.\" \"Well circulated?\" Aphrodite scoffed, turning towards her things once more, \"Topics conversed between yourself and Hermes hardly count as well circulated.\" Athena's cheeks flushed, \"The matter still stands: you are up to something, and I refuse to be subjected to ridicule because of another one of your rebellious schemes.\" For a long while, Aphrodite said nothing; she was too busy draping Athena in gold. Gold wristlets, armbands, necklaces. It was a bit gaudy in Athena's opinion, but to go against Aphrodite when it came to things like this was pointless. \"I think that's it.\" Aphrodite grinned, stepping back and taking her sister in from head to toe. \"You'll have the men fawning all over you.\" \"I don't want men fawning all over me.\" Athena sighed, \"We receive enough of that as Gods.\" \"Oh lighten up.\" Aphrodite snapped, \"We have yet to leave and you're already tainting the mood.\" \"Well hurry up and get yourself dressed then.\" Athena countered, \"So I can worsen the mood there.\" \"You're just hilarious.\" Aphrodite droned, walking back towards her gowns and jewelry, leaving Athena wishing she could just back out of this now. When Aphrodite stepped back out, she was dressed exactly like Athena, the only difference being she was dressed in a deep red, instead of a powdery blue. \"Now we match.\" \"We haven't done anything like this in ages.\" Athena mumbled, marveling at the sight of her sister standing before her. They were so different, physically and personality-wise, but they'd often found themselves dressing similarly because it made them feel closer. But that was a long time ago. \"Well, I was feeling nostalgic.\" Aphrodite answered, linking their arms together and walking them out of her chambers, \"Off we go.\" Athena gave her sister a smile and nodded, but there was a horrible feeling in the pit of her stomach as they made their way out of Olympus.. \"You're pouting.\" Dionysus grinned, running his finger over the rim of the goblet in his friend's hand to quickly refill it before leaning back into his seat. Ares turned to glare at the God of Wine, \"I am not pouting.\" \"Athena has yet to remove herself from Diomedes' side since arriving.\" Dionysus pointed out, bringing their attention back to the Goddess of Wisdom and the new King of Argos. \"You're pouting. Or internally seething. Or both.\" \"Do well to keep your opinions to yourself, my friend, or I might have to put my sword in you.\" Ares gritted out before tossing back the wine that Dionysus had conjured into his glass. \"So aggressive.\" His head jerked up, the sight of Aphrodite's smirk irritating him that much more, \"What do you want?\" \"Oh, is that anyway to treat the woman who got her sister into bed with you?\" Aphrodite purred, dropping herself onto his lap and throwing an arm around his shoulders. Ares' brows shot up, but he made no movement, \"No, but it is the way to treat a woman meddling with my affairs in general. I haven't the slightest clue what your business with Athena is, but I refuse to be another piece in this game of yours.\" \"But this whole place is like a giant chess board and you'd make such a lovely King to my Queen.\" Aphrodite purred, tilting his head so he was forced to look over at Athena again, \"Doesn't she just look lovely tonight?\" And she did look lovely. Ares knew they'd only just come face to face not too long ago, but he'd yet to see her dressed in such attire and he highly doubted she did so willingly. It was that reason alone that had him admiring her beauty in spite of himself. \"Ares.\" It was Dionysus' voice that pulled him out of his reverie, pulling an irritated growl out of him as well. \"You would do well to remove yourself, Aphrodite.\" Aphrodite sighed and pushed herself off of him, \"You're no fun. It's no wonder Athena is all over that mortal instead. I hope she puts you on your ass tonight.\" Ares jerked his gaze towards Dionysus as Aphrodite walked away, \"You told her I was going up against Athena?\" Dionysus shook his head, \"I did not breathe a word of it.\" \"You boys really shouldn't underestimate me!\" Aphrodite called back before she disappeared from view, a smirk on those red lips of hers. \"There is no doubt she is up to something now.\" Dionysus drawled lazily, bringing his goblet up to his lips and draining it. \"And Athena is at the center of it all.\" It should not have bothered him so much, the idea of a squabble between siblings. The idea of Athena facing certain ridicule tonight should have pleased him, if anything. But the thought of Aphrodite unleashing her vengeance on her sister made him incredibly uneasy and the itch to warn Athena was growing. \"Ares...\" \"Don't.\" he hissed, halting the God of Wine before he could say anymore. \"I will get her to speak to me before the night is done. I will not hear more of it from you, or anyone.\" \"Hmm.\" was all that left Dionysus' lips as he took another sip of his wine, letting Ares battle with his thoughts.. \"You seem distracted tonight.\" The laughter that had bubbled from Athena's lips died in an instant and her gaze flickered from Diomedes to Ares for the briefest of moments, then to her sister, who was working her charms on some poor, unsuspecting mortal. \"I have a few things running through my head tonight, yes.\" she admitted with a small nod, \"But this night is about you, my friend.\" Diomedes chuckled, reaching out as if to cup her cheek but stopping himself at the last minute; it was frustrating, really, his need to remember formalities. He was a mortal, she was a Goddess, but above all that, he was her friend and it saddened her to think that he put her status above their friendship. \"Well I am here if you need someone to speak to. You know that.\" He told her, and while it was not the extremely comforting gesture he would have made when he was a younger, Athena accepted it with a smile. \"Athena, it is time.\" The Goddess of Wisdom turned to face Dionysus, who was wearing a lazy grin on his lips. Sighing, Athena turned back to Diomedes and gave him an apologetic smile, \"It seems I must take my leave, but do enjoy yourself and don't worry so much. You are going to be a wonderful king, I know it.\" Diomedes chuckled once more and nodded, \"I make no promises. Until next time, Athena.\" Athena nodded, \"Until next time.\" with that, she turned her back on the young king and proceeded to glare at the God of Wine. \"What? You agreed to accompany Aphrodite. She just happens to be a little busy with one of her many...pets.\" Dionysus murmured dryly, taking a sip of wine. Athena folded her arms over her chest, a thin brow rising, \"Is that jealousy I hear?\" Dionysus scoffed, \"Your sister is not worth that much. And I got the better sister in the end.\" There was a smirk on his lips, brows wiggling suggestively as he looked over at her and she felt her cheeks flush. \"Never speak of that again. Is that not what we promised?\" \"Oh, but it's so much fun watching you squirm.\" He sighed. Athena scowled, giving the God of Wine a shove that he returned with a smirk on his lips as they came to a stop. \"You seem to be enjoying yourselves.\" Athena tensed, the voice that filled her ears belonging to the one person she'd intended on avoiding the entire night. Shooting Dionysus the darkest look she could muster, she turned her attention to the God of War. \"Is that a problem?\" \"Not in the slightest.\" he answered coolly, giving a small shrug before tossing her one of the blades he had been carrying, \"But you and I are up first, and I'd imagine you might want to prepare beforehand.\" Athena's eyes widened the slightest bit, still she managed to catch the blade by its hilt with practiced ease. \"First? We're going up against each other? I did not agree to this.\" Her attention had turned to Dionysus, a sudden rage threatening to take place of her usually cool and collected demeanor. The God of Wine did his best to seem nonchalant and merely shrugged, \"The results were drawn up randomly, dear Athena. It was Aphrodite's idea.\" Suddenly everything clicked; Aphrodite wanting her to show up, the kindness her sister had shown her, the teasing about her night with Ares - Aphrodite didn't simply want to laugh at her misery, she wanted everyone else to laugh along with her. \"Not frightened, are you?\" Ares asked, a cocky smirk on his lips. Athena's eyes narrowed and she took a single step toward the God of War, \"I'll have you on your back before the night is done.\" Ares' brows rose, and only then did it occur to Athena just how horrible her choice of words had been, \"Oh, I'm sure you will.\" For that moment, rational thought and level-headedness left her. \"You know that is not how I meant it.\" She snapped. Ares shrugged, \"I only know what has left your lips; you do enjoy your secrets.\" Ares did well to seem particularly stoic about the statement, but she sensed the faintest amount of hurt radiating off of him and knew he was thinking about that night. \"There are no secrets!\" Athena hissed, taking another step towards him and jabbing him in the chest with her index finger, \"I was drunk. It was poor judgment on my part to listen to Aphrodite when half the time she's doing nothing but coming up with convoluted plans to make me miserable. Very poor judgment, but it is over and done with. Nothing can change what happened, but I can damn well choose to ignore it, so you best forget it ever happened.\" His eyes --- damn those eyes again --- narrowed, darkening as his hand came up, fingers closing around her wrist before he jerked her forward. She stumbled, chest colliding with his but before she could protest, he was already speaking, \"Gods we may be, Athena --- equal in more ways than one, you and I ---but do not think for one second that I will not put you in your place for trying to tell me what to do.\" \"Don't make me laugh.\" she muttered darkly, seeming unfazed by the sudden lack of space between them, \"You're more a monster than a God.\" Rage flashed in those eyes of his, but just as quickly, she was being pulled back and Dionysus' voice was filling her ears. \"Now, now, children, play nice.\" he purred, an arm wrapped loosely around her waist as he led her away, \"The tournament has yet to start and you know our rules. No bloodshed before a tournament.\" Athena scoffed, \"This is you talking about a brute who lives off the death and bloodshed of innocents. He cannot resist.\" \"Coming from the Goddess of Wisdom.\" Ares snapped, \"Where is that level-headed, clear minded brilliance of yours now, Athena?\" \"Enough!\" Dionysus shouted, startling the two of them; it was rare to see the usually laid-back God lose his patience with anyone. \"Dionysus--\" \"Don't.\" Dionysus sighed, reaching up to massage his temples, \"I swear the two of you will be the death of me.\" Athena, feeling the guilt sink in, offered him a faint smile and breathed, \"Don't be ridiculous, Dionysus, you're a God, you cannot die.\" Dionysus snorted, but Athena caught sight of the smile that threatened to slip onto his lips, \"You two are coming particular close to making death a possibility.\" \"Ah, but you know that if given the choice,\" Ares added, a smirk on his lips as he trained his attention on his friend, and not the irritating Goddess but a few feet away from him, \"You would not bear to be without us.\" \"You assume too much.\" Dionysus quipped, sending each of them pointed looks, \"Can you at least be civil with one another for the night? Athena--\" \"Yes?\" She questioned immediately, stepping towards him despite the need to keep herself as far away from Ares as possible at the moment. \"Do not let Aphrodite get the best of you tonight.\" Dionysus grinned, \"It would be disappointing not to get the chance to watch her explode in all her anger when things do not happen as she wishes them to.\" Athena rolled her eyes, but a small laugh left her lips before her gaze landed on Ares, stormy eyes locking with those ocean blue eyes that had been seared into her mind. \"I'll be civil, if he is.\" The corner of his lips twitched and Athena couldn't figure out if it was the threat of a smirk or a snarl that was the reason behind it, \"I shall, on one condition.\" Athena pursed her lips, entirely aware of Dionysus tensing beside her; there was only one thing Ares wanted from her---the truth. \"What condition would that be?\" \"A conversation, tonight, with the guarantee of your complete honesty.\" \"Ares--\" \"You wanted our civility, Dionysus, I'm simply stating my conditions for it. She can agree or disagree and we shall work from there.\" Ares continued, never breaking the eye contact. After a few more moments of hesitation, Athena gave a curt nod. \"Fine. But nowhere my sister can send any of her little minions to keep an eye on us.\" Ares grimaced, \"That would be preferred.\" \"Well, you two could have your conversation in my humble abode.\" Dionysus interjected. The two of them turned to Dionysus with a brow raised. \"Oh?\" Athena questioned. \"I have a place on the mortal plane --- a place no one knows about. It's well hidden, and a place Aphrodite knows nothing about.\" Dionysus shrugged, \"Even I needed some time away from that big... personality of hers back then.\" The other two Gods snorted, folding their arms over their chests in a synchronized fashion --- something they seemed entirely oblivious to, but Dionysus took careful note of it with a quirked brow of his own and a sly little grin. \"Good, good.\" he chirped, \"Now that that's settled, I do believe the two of you have a tournament to start off.\" Dionysus threw an arm around each of them, conjuring them glasses of wine that they took without debate as he led them in the direction of city's palaestra; it still irritated Athena that Dionysus had decided to throw the Gods together in Argos, considering the last thing Diomedes needed at the moment was absolute chaos caused by the Gods, but she would have to speak to Dionysus about that later. She had a battle to prepare for.. His blood was rushing in his ears, not from rage, but from excitement; his body knew he was anxiously awaiting a battle. And not just any battle, a battle with Athena. His equal in more ways than one. His rival. Stepping into the arena of the palaestra was invigorating; the cheers of his fellow Gods filling his ears, the lot of them no doubt having placed their bets on him. They weren't stupid enough to bet against him, he'd wager. When Athena stepped out, however, it seemed there was a ripple in the small crowd. There was hesitance and uncertainty laced with anticipation, and it irritated him; they knew, they all knew that if anyone could take him down it would be her. \"Well, then,\" Dionysus' voice echoed among them, \"Let us begin, shall we?\" Ares snorted as the cheers and screams erupted once more; leave it to a crowd of Gods and to encourage absolute chaos on the mortal plane. If Zeus were around they'd be running with their tails between their legs, all of them. \"All's fair. Don't kill each other, you two.\" There were snickers among the crowd, and Ares spotted Aphrodite smirking cheekily on the opposite side of the palaestra. He really wished he could permanently wipe the damn thing off of her face. \"Begin.\" They immediately took a defensive stance; Athena had been, without a doubt, expecting him to attack first, so his defensive stance took her by surprise --- he could see it written all over her face, even hidden underneath her helmet. He refused to make the first move, however. Until she would, he decided to observe her carefully --- she'd left the blade he'd handed her earlier for two smaller ones of her own. She favored those, he knew, and while they worked well with her, using them left her without the option of a shield. They left her without defenses. He knew she was quick, whenever she did join a battle, but he'd never actually seen her in battle in person and he was curious. Was she really well enough to risk leaving herself as open as she was? By now they were circling each other, both seemingly against making the first move and he was growing impatient. He needed to move, but him going in first was exactly what she wanted, and --- no doubt --- what Aphrodite was expecting. The last thing he wanted was to please her. \"Scared, Ares?\" Athena called out, surprising him --- and her sister, from the look he spotted on her face in the stands. He had to fight the urge to smirk up at her and instead scoffed. \"Hardly.\" \"You're playing it safe. It's terribly unlike you.\" she called out, relaxing her stance. She was baiting him; how cheap a trick. Unfortunately it was working. He was itching to charge towards her and knock her off her damn feet. \"And what would you know about what I'm like, darling?\" he called out through gritted teeth. \"Enough to know that your recklessness led to me sending an entire fleet of yours to the bottom of the ocean.\" That was a low blow. He was running toward her before he even realized what he was doing; his fingers were wrapped tightly around the hilt of his blade, held up as he ran towards her, ready to strike, but as he'd known she would be, she was quick. She used one blade to stop his incoming strike, holding his from landing a clean blow to her pretty little head while she worked the other one past his shield to get a good, clean cut to his left side. He glared at her for a moment, hating the stupid smirk that made its way onto her lips; she'd drawn first blood. As stupid and insignificant as the wound was, she knew well enough about him to know that he always drew first blood. From then on it was no mercy; blow after blow they went at it. He drew blood soon after, though her wound was significantly worse than the one she gave him, deeper, bigger but he'd made sure to mark her in the exact same place she'd marked him; they all knew then, he was making a statement. He would be mimicking any wounds she inflicted on him to prove that no matter what damage she got in, he would work the battle in his favor. Time seemed to fly by the longer their battle ran; both of them bleeding and bruised, breathing heavily on their respective sides of the arena as they stared each other down. The battle was slowly coming to a close and even they weren't entirely sure which one of them would come out of this the victor. \"I said I'd have you on your back by the end of the night.\" She called out, angling herself in a nearly frontal stance, her body turned only slightly sideways as she looked at him, \"So, let's finish this.\" He was too distracted to even comment on the choice of words she'd so blindly uttered earlier in the night; he needed to end this, once and for all. He needed to put this damn woman in her place. Tossing his shield to the side, he charged again. She was, of course, ready for him, blocking his blow with one blade. Instead of using the other to land a blow of her own, she made a full turn, coming up behind him and kicked the backs of his knees, forcing him onto them as she knocked his blade out of his hand. Once that was done, she had both of hers pressed against the base of his neck. \"Not quite on your back, but I'll take what I can get.\" she breathed. \"Oh, I'm sure you'd have much preferred having me on my back.\" he responded cheekily, reaching up to run his fingers along her arm. He could feel the goose flesh forming on her skin, feel her trembling even as she pressed the blades deeper into his skin, somehow managing to keep from piercing it as she did so. \"You never stop, do you?\" she hissed. He truly enjoyed getting her worked up; logic flew right on out the window when he did so. It was why he was able to reach up and wrap his fingers around both of her wrists and pull her forward as he ducked down. She landed on her back with a heavy thud and a gasp, but he didn't hesitate. He straddled her hips, fingers still wrapped around her wrists as he slammed them onto the ground hard enough to make it hurt and force her to let go of the blades in her hands out of reflex. He smirked down at her as the end flag was raised, signaling him the victor. \"What was that about having me on my back?\" She simply glared up at him in response; not really all that surprising, considering it was her. Still, he held her in place for a few moments more, trying to keep his mind from straying towards the only other time he had her lithe form underneath him. Shaking his head, he finally released her and pushed himself to his feet. He quickly dusted himself off and held a hand out to her, offering to help her up but she simply ignored it and lifted herself up. \"Did you honestly expect any different, Athena?\" He questioned, hooded gaze trained on her, \"Wise and Intelligent you may be, you are still young---\" \"Spare me.\" She interjected, tone clipped, \"I hear enough about still being too young in regards to certain things from Zeus, I do not need --- or want --- it from you as well. You won, congratulations.\" \"Athena--\" \"Well that was a bummer.\" He didn't know how she'd gotten their so quickly, but Aphrodite was there, resting a hand on his shoulder as she looked at Athena, a sympathetic look on her face. \"I had such hopes that you'd put our dear Ares in his place, sister.\" Aphrodite sighed. Athena seemed even more livid than before. \"I'm sure you did.\" \"Oh, well. Perhaps another time.\" She quipped, turning her attention then to Ares, all seductive looks and sly smirks. \"I do believe congratulations are in order.\" He really should have expected it. Aphrodite's hand slid to the back of his neck and pulled him in. Their lips met and, instinctively, his hands came to rest on her hips; it was something he was familiar with, but he pulled back almost immediately, eyes searching for Athena, but all he saw were the blonde curls bouncing about from underneath the rim of her helmet as she stormed out of the palaestra. \"Tsk, tsk. So dramatic, she is.\" Aphrodite chirped, pushing herself away, a smirk on her red lips, \"It was only a silly tournament.\" \"What game are you playing at?\" Ares hissed, wrapping his fingers around her arm and yanking her towards him. Her own eyes darkened, and she muttered, \"You're hurting me. I'd hardly imagine you would want to be interrogating me when you have other opponents to face, Ares.\" The nerve of this woman. Tightening his grip on her the slightest bit more, he shoved her back and made his way in the direction Athena had gone. Dionysus was at his side in an instant, \"Leaving now would mean being followed, Ares. Aphrodite would know where to find you. Let her go. I will make sure she shows up when she needs to.\" Ares stopped just short of exiting, hands curling into fists to keep himself from lashing out. \"Fine. I shall stay.\" Dionysus gave him a wry grin and clapped him on the shoulder, \"Don't kill anyone; you turn monstrous whenever you're taking your anger out on your opponents. They don't deserve the anger you need to be directing at Aphrodite.\" \"Yes, well, unfortunately I can't kill her either.\" Ares hissed, \"There's no winning with you.\" Dionysus snorted, \"There's no winning with you. Remember, you 'can't help it'?\" Ares rolled his eyes and gave the God of Wine a light shrug, \"Go on, get out of here. I... won't kill anyone.\" Dionysus' brows rose. \"Alright, alright, however, I make no promises that I will not cause serious injury.\" \"Of course you don't.\". Athena was furious; more with herself than anyone else. She had told herself time and again, throughout the entire night, that she would not let Aphrodite get the better of her. She was not going to let her sister see just how easy it was to get at her. But she let it happen anyway. And all because of that damn Ares. \"Athena.\" She was tempted to stop and snap at Dionysus, but she knew that if she stopped moving for a single moment, her resolve would weaken and she would give in to whatever it was he wanted. \"Go away, Dionysus.\" She murmured, walking a little faster than she previously had been. \"Damn it, Athena now is not the time to throw logic away. Do you not see this is exactly what Aphrodite wants?\" He called out, quickly catching up and falling into step with her. \"I don't care, I'm done with it. Done with her and done with him.\" \"No, you're not.\" Dionysus sighed, wrapping his fingers around her wrist and pulling her to a stop. \"Athena, you will never be done with him. Just as he will never be done with you. I know him and I know you.\" She wanted nothing more than to run away. To avoid having this conversation with Dionysus or anyone because it would lead to nothing but trouble. But she knew he was right; she would never truly be done with him. A part of her would always long for some part of him. The snark, the rivalry, the similarity, familiarity. As often as they were at each others' throats, they were probably the only people who understood each other completely without words. \"You gave word to meet with him tonight. I think you should keep your word.\" She turned to face Dionysus, keeping her expression carefully guarded before relenting with a small sigh. \"Lead the way.\" The God of Wine simply grinned and slipped his hand into hers, \"I'm starting to regret not keeping you for myself.\" Athena snorted and let him lead the way. \"Idiot.\" Dionysus' grin widened, \"But I'm your idiot.\". Time had gone by unbearably slow for Ares, but he'd defeated each and every one of his opponents with a fierceness not a single one of them had ever seen. He wanted to be done with them all. It was far past nightfall by the time things were over and done with and he wasted no time in making his way to the inconspicuous little cottage Dionysus kept. He was probably the only person besides Dionysus himself that knew of its existence, so it wasn't very difficult to get there. When he arrived, his friend was just making his way out, the glamour he'd worn in front of the mortals slipping back on effortlessly. \"I almost thought you wouldn't show.\" Dionysus called out, a teasing grin on his lips. \"I called for this, did you really think I'd let the opportunity slip right through my fingers?\" Ares huffed, crossing his arms over his chest and coming to a stop right in front of the God of Wine. \"Just...\" Dionysus paused, pursing his lips before clapping Ares on the shoulder, \"Don't kill each other, please.\" Ares snorted and nodded, taking it as a dismissal and making his way inside. The place was downplayed, simple; such a completely different look from the lavish home they all shared on Olympus. It was really quite brilliant to believe Dionysus had realized that Aphrodite would never assume Dionysus of all people could lower himself to a place such as this just to get away from her prying eyes. \"You're rather silent.\" Her voice rang in his ears and automatically he tensed; it was a habitual reaction. Something he'd become so accustomed to doing it was almost impossible for him to not do it. \"As I recall,\" She continued, coming into his line of vision from the right, lacking her armor and helm; once again left in that lovely gown that had made it impossible for him to tear his eyes away from her. \"This entire arrangement was your idea. Or am I wasting my time in being here?\" He knew what she was doing; playing her cards well. Keeping her walls up and being every bit the cold, logical Goddess of Wisdom that she was --- it was such an easy, familiar guise for her to slip into. Ignoring the emotions, the tugging at her heartstrings --- it was second nature to her to fall into them. He didn't want logic, or reason, though. He wanted the truth. \"What happened that night?\" He breathed, watching her carefully; being who she was, it wasn't all that difficult for her to lie her way through any situation and make it seem like the absolute truth, so he needed to make sure he caught the slightest of ticks, the smallest flicker of emotion in her eyes, across her face. He could not risk missing them. A heavy sigh left her lips then, but he wasn't sure if she was getting ready to speak the truth, or lie straight to his face despite her having given him her word earlier. \"I... I wasn't even supposed to be there that night; I had not planned on it. I wanted to stay home.\" She breathed, running a hand through the now unruly golden curls that fell past her shoulders. \"But Aphrodite wanted me to help her get one of her toys off her case; someone who'd gotten a little too attached and refused to leave her be. I was to be a distraction while she met up with someone else.\" That explained her presence there, the mix up when he'd first seen her and he could not, for the life of him, figure out who she was. From there, it was easy to figure out that she'd been affected by Dionysus' spirits at some point. More likely than not, before she'd stepped up to the battles that were happening just outside; he doubted Athena, as she normally was, would have been as brash as she'd been then. \"And I haven't the slightest clue what Dionysus handed me, but I drank it in one go and before I knew it, I was in a heated argument with you.\" She finally turned to face him, jade eyes shining silver in the moonlight that shone through the curtains. \"You were so damn infuriating, and in the state that I was in, logic and reason escaped me.\" He had to fight the urge to smirk at her statement; memories of how infuriated she became flashing across his mind. It had been rather amusing. Well, at least in the moment where he'd managed to outwit her. The rest of the time she was just as infuriating. \"I fled as quickly as I could once you were distracted; I was supposed to be there for my sister, not dealing with some brute too proud to admit when he'd been outwitted.\" He opened his mouth to spew some insult her way but she glowered at him and continued before he had the chance. \"The mask --- bless that stupid thing --- had kept you from realizing who I was. As far as you knew, I was just some stupid girl, too bold for her own good. And then--\" \"And then I found a mask of my own.\" He interrupted, tilting his head to the side as he continued to watch her. \"And we ended up--\" \"Details aren't needed.\" She quickly interrupted, and he swore he saw the faintest of flushes on her cheeks. \"We were both there at this point. When I awoke, you were still asleep and my curiosity got the best of me; who could this masked stranger --- so easy to converse with, so understanding of my rants and opinions compared to every drunken idiot in that place --- be?\" She paused, turned her gaze to her hands and cleared her throat, \"I should have expected it, but I didn't. And the minute the mask was off, I ran.\" \"And I awoke just as you exited my chambers.\" He murmured. Athena said nothing then and he continued, \"Only I found Aphrodite instead.\" \"Lovely little tricks she has, right?\" Athena responded bitterly. \"All perfect gifts for manipulation. I'm starting to believe that's the only thing she's capable of anymore.\" \"So that's that.\" He muttered, dark brows furrowing. \"It was just another of Aphrodite's games.\" \"It wasn't...\" Athena shook her head, \"Not initially. Until she found out what had occurred between the two of us. It was as if then the gears in her head started working and she wanted nothing more than to make me admit that I had enjoyed myself for once because of her--\" Ares head jerked up and he stared at her with wide eyes, \"Did you?\" Athena paused, her own brows furrowing, \"Did I what?\" \"Enjoy yourself. That night?\" Her cheeks flushed, \"I...I--\" \"You gave word you would be completely honest.\" He reminded her, hating the hope that seeped into his words. \"It was not the worst night of my life.\" She told him, crossing her arms over her chest and he grinned. \"Better than your night with Dionysus?\" Her eyes narrowed into slits then and she stomped towards him, jabbing him in the chest with his index finger. \"Never speak of that. I know he's told you the rules in regards to that night.\" \"The deflowering of the Virgin Goddess, Athena.\" He murmured with an over dramatic sigh. \"Must have been an interesting night.\" \"Ares, I am warning you.\" She hissed, ready to jab him in the chest again when his fingers wrapped around her wrist. He turned dark eyes on her, his quick temper bubbling underneath the surface, making him tighten his hold on her wrist just the slightest. \"Do we need to replay tonight's battle, Athena?\" She looked ready to kill for a brief moment, and a part of him loved it; she was simply a marvel sometimes in moments like these. The urge for battle burning just underneath the surface. It was one of those moments where they were sharing the same thoughts, the same longing for battle and urge to just... hit something. Or someone. But of course those moment never lasted long. Logic and reason always came back for her with a vengeance.. \"Let me go, Ares.\" She gritted out, willing herself to relax in his hold; to avoid letting the irrational part of her take over and lash out at him. \"Why did you run?\" Athena blinked, thrown off for a moment before realizing he was referring to that night. \"I was mortified.\" She told him honestly. \"I'd spent the night making a complete fool of myself, drunk off my ass and I wake up in the bed of my supposed rival. I was in no place to think clearly so I ran. To find some sort of middle ground. A place to think, and come down from all the insanity that had ensued.\" And of course she left out the part where she realized that she'd enjoyed herself completely. Where she couldn't bring herself to regret what it was that it had happened between them and that it had most definitely been far better than her night with Dionysus. He didn't need all that information to hold over her. \"There's something you're not telling me.\" He breathed, leaning forward and making her breath catch in her throat; why the hell had she allowed herself to get so damn close to him? \"I haven't a clue what you're talking about. You asked and I answered.\" She responded, refusing to look him in the eyes. \"As cold and distant as always.\" He murmured, \"Why don't you try answering me with some emotion, my dear, then maybe I'll believe you.\" \"I...\" She trailed off, finding herself distracted by just how close his face had come to hers, \"Ares, you're being ridiculous. You asked me for my honesty and that's exactly what I'm giving you.\" She was simply choosing to leave some of the truth out. \"I'm not letting you out of here until you tell me the whole truth.\" Her patience was wearing thin, and she knew he would follow through with his words, so with a stomp of her foot, she hissed, \"I was terrified because I liked it. I liked you. Your company, the way you felt against me that night. Because for the first time in a long time, I had someone who understood me, who I could speak to and it turned out to be you! The God of War. My rival. My enemy. I hadn't even met you and I was raised loathing you. You were nothing more than a monster in my eyes and I didn't even know who you were. Then I met you, and you simply confirmed all everyone had ever uttered about you. Until you slipped on that stupid mask. Until you tricked me.\" Her breath caught in her throat then and she felt her eyes burning but willed herself not to give in to the angry tears. \"You tricked me and when I took off that mask you weren't a monster anymore. Everything about you was not the way it should have been in my head and I was so confused, and so damn terrified so I ran. It was easier for me to forget that it had ever happened than to accept that I had been wrong about you. But then Aphrodite got her hands on you and it hurt. It actually hurt and I couldn't just forget. So I tried to hate you that much more. And it was working so damn well for me.\" \"Athena.\" \"No! You don't get to speak. You wanted me to talk, so now you listen.\" She gritted, twisting her wrist free from his grasp. Miraculously, he let her. \"I hate you. I need to hate you. It's the only thing that makes sense. The only thing that makes things seem like they're normal. Like they're okay. Because you are the God of War and I'm not supposed to love you!\" His blue eyes widened and Athena's heart dropped to her stomach; \"N-No. That isn't-- I didn't mean--\" \"Shut up, Athena.\" He growled, slipping a hand to the back of her neck and pressing his lips against hers so violently, she was positive she'd bruise regardless of their godly gifts. Logic had her fighting at first; her hands slammed against his chest repeatedly and she bit down hard on his lip in an attempt to get him to stop, but it only seemed to spur him on and soon enough, he was slamming her into one of the walls. The action was so sudden, it pulled a pained gasp from her lips and made her wonder if they'd have the whole building in ruins by the time the sun rose. \"Ares--\" He groaned against her lips, but pulled back, allowing her to breathe and she was grateful; she could think, even if just for a moment. \"This can--\" \"Don't you dare finish that sentence, Athena, don't.\" he breathed, nuzzling into her neck. \"You want it to happen, I know you do. Put the logic aside and throw reason out the window for once and let this happen.\" \"I refuse to be a conquest of yours.\" She murmured quietly, refusing to look at him even as he tensed against her. \"Is that honestly all you think this is? All I see you as? Another conquest?\" He spat. \"It's hard not to think in such a way; when have you ever heard anyone say you've bedded anyone out of love? Lust, desire, maybe. But you can't blame me for being wary. You did spend a majority of time with my sister recently, remember?\" the words tasted bitter leaving her lips, and she knew jealousy was coming off of her in waves, but she was way past the point of hiding that. \"I want you to listen to me carefully, Athena.\" He breathed out, \"I loath your sister with a passion--\" \"And that didn't stop you from bedding her. That says a great deal about my decision, don't you think?\" \"Damn it, Athena, let me speak.\" he growled out, slamming a hand down on the wall she was currently pressed up against. \"Aphrodite meant nothing. I knew how she was, how she is; attachment with her would have been the stupidest thing ever. The only reason I spent my nights with her was because she was as close to you as I could get. She's more a monster than you ever saw me to be and you know it. So, if I can't have you for all of eternity because you refuse to believe it's possible for the two of us, then let me have you if only for tonight.\" That hurt her heart far more than she'd expected it to. But he was right. He knew her well enough to understand that she saw them as the rest of Olympus would. Rivals. Enemies. At odds with one another for the entirety of their existence. Never lovers. Slowly, almost shyly, Athena brought her hands up to cup his face in them; gently, as if he were made of glass. Meeting his eyes, she only gave the smallest of nods before leaning forward and pressing her lips against his. It was so soft and sweet and so unlike him that it just about broke her heart, thinking that this would be the one and only time they'd ever be able to do this. The only time she'd ever allow them to do this. Suddenly, the kiss grew violent; teeth grazing against his and tongues battling for dominance as she pulled him as close as he would come. She needed him as close as he could get and even closer if possible, but the armor that was still firmly attached to his body was in the way. A soft, irritated growl left her lips and he chuckled. Quickly, though, he got rid of his breast plate, letting it fall to the stone floor with a loud clang and returned to kissing her, his upper body now bare and pressing right up against her. His skin was hot against her, even through the thin material of the gown she adorned. Quickly growing frustrated with it as she'd done with his armor, Athena pushed Ares back and started removing all the armbands and necklaces, letting them fall to the floor before she worked on the sash at her waist and pushed the gown off of her shoulders. It hit the floor soundlessly and just like that, she was standing completely vulnerable in front of him. The look on his face was one she knew she wouldn't be forgetting any time soon, eyes darkened with lust and half-lidded as he took her in completely. He reached for her, wanting to touch her, she imagined, but he stopped himself and continued to admire her for a few moments more, simply taking her in. It was terrifying, like being under scrutiny; Athena had never felt beautiful. She was not beautiful, not like Aphrodite was, but the way he looked at her made her feel like the most beautiful creature in all of existence. \"Ares.\" She breathed, so quietly it sounded more like a whimper. As if on command, he discarded the last of his clothing and walked to her, lifting her without hesitation and carrying her to the bed in the other room. He hovered above her as their lips met once again and Athena slid her hands up his back, pulling him closer and moaning softly as he rolled his hips against hers. She brought her legs up around his waist at that moment, locking her ankles together at the small of his back and moving her lips against his in the most desperate kiss she'd ever experienced. Athena never thought it was possible to want someone so much. So intensely. His hands worked their way down her sides, palming and caressing just as his cock pushed past her opening, pulling a soft whimper from her lips. Her fingers dug into his back as he eased himself into her and Athena forced herself to bite back a moan despite the fact that no one was around to hear them. \"Athena,\" he breathed once he was fully inside her, his forehead resting against the crook of her neck. \"Beautiful, beautiful Athena.\" Her name left his lips like a prayer, and she wanted the moment to last forever. But she kissed him again, lips moving against his in a hungry kiss and suddenly he was moving fast and hard; thrust after thrust sending spasms throughout her entire body and making her scream. She didn't think anything could have been as amazing as that night had been, but this was better; because it was them, together. Open and vulnerable and --- even if just for the night --- completely free. All too soon, the coil of heat in her lower abdomen that had been pulling itself taught snapped and her vision was laced white as she came, nails dragging down his back, breaking skin and his name leaving her lips in a loud moan. Exhaustion was quick to wrap itself around her, but she fought to stay conscious, kissing and sucking and licking areas on his neck and chest until his thrusts stuttered to a stop and he shot his seed inside of her, groaning and collapsing on top of her. A soft grunt left her lips at his weight and he quickly shifted to the side, murmuring a soft apology before wrapping his arms around her and pulling her to him. In the distance, Apollo was preparing to rise with the sun itself and Athena knew she'd have to flee once more, but for the moment, she'd allow herself to savor the moment. Savor the side only she would ever get to see when it came to the God of War. fin.",

      "\"I would not complain half as much if I was not so sure you were up to something.\"",

      "It was a little snug, if only because she was not the slightest bit used to wearing things Aphrodite liked to wear, but otherwise fit well enough.",
      "The straps resting on her shoulders were a little loose, but she was positive they were supposed to be falling off her shoulder and resting on her arms instead, but she did not touch.",

      "\"Well circulated?\"",
      "Aphrodite scoffed, turning towards her things once more, \"Topics conversed between yourself and Hermes hardly count as well circulated.\"",
      "Athena's cheeks flushed, \"The matter still stands: you are up to something, and I refuse to be subjected to ridicule because of another one of your rebellious schemes.\"",
      "For a long while, Aphrodite said nothing; she was too busy draping Athena in gold.",
      "Gold wristlets, armbands, necklaces.",
      "It was a bit gaudy in Athena's opinion, but to go against Aphrodite when it came to things like this was pointless.",
      "\"I think that's it.\"",

      "\"You'll have the men fawning all over you.\"",
      "\"I don't want men fawning all over me.\"",

      "\"Well hurry up and get yourself dressed then.\"",

      "\"You're just hilarious.\"",
      "Aphrodite droned, walking back towards her gowns and jewelry, leaving Athena wishing she could just back out of this now.",
      "When Aphrodite stepped back out, she was dressed exactly like Athena, the only difference being she was dressed in a deep red, instead of a powdery blue.",
      "\"Now we match.\"",
      "\"We haven't done anything like this in ages.\"",
      "Athena mumbled, marveling at the sight of her sister standing before her.",
      "They were so different, physically and personality-wise, but they'd often found themselves dressing similarly because it made them feel closer.",
      "But that was a long time ago.",
      "\"Well, I was feeling nostalgic.\"",
      "Aphrodite answered, linking their arms together and walking them out of her chambers, \"Off we go.\"",
      "Athena gave her sister a smile and nodded, but there was a horrible feeling in the pit of her stomach as they made their way out of Olympus.. \"You're pouting.\"",
      "Dionysus grinned, running his finger over the rim of the goblet in his friend's hand to quickly refill it before leaning back into his seat.",
      "Ares turned to glare at the God of Wine, \"I am not pouting.\"",
      "\"Athena has yet to remove herself from Diomedes' side since arriving.\"",

      "Or both.\"",
      "\"Do well to keep your opinions to yourself, my friend, or I might have to put my sword in you.\"",
      "Ares gritted out before tossing back the wine that Dionysus had conjured into his glass.",
      "\"So aggressive.\"",
      "His head jerked up, the sight of Aphrodite's smirk irritating him that much more, \"What do you want?\"",
      "\"Oh, is that anyway to treat the woman who got her sister into bed with you?\"",

      "\"But this whole place is like a giant chess board and you'd make such a lovely King to my Queen.\"",
      "Aphrodite purred, tilting his head so he was forced to look over at Athena again, \"Doesn't she just look lovely tonight?\"",
      "And she did look lovely.",
      "Ares knew they'd only just come face to face not too long ago, but he'd yet to see her dressed in such attire and he highly doubted she did so willingly.",
      "It was that reason alone that had him admiring her beauty in spite of himself.",
      "\"Ares.\"",
      "It was Dionysus' voice that pulled him out of his reverie, pulling an irritated growl out of him as well.",
      "\"You would do well to remove yourself, Aphrodite.\"",
      "Aphrodite sighed and pushed herself off of him, \"You're no fun.",
      "It's no wonder Athena is all over that mortal instead.",
      "I hope she puts you on your ass tonight.\"",
      "Ares jerked his gaze towards Dionysus as Aphrodite walked away, \"You told her I was going up against Athena?\" Dionysus shook his head, \"I did not breathe a word of it.\"",
      "\"You boys really shouldn't underestimate me!\"",
      "Aphrodite called back before she disappeared from view, a smirk on those red lips of hers.",
      "\"There is no doubt she is up to something now.\"",
      "Dionysus drawled lazily, bringing his goblet up to his lips and draining it.",
      "\"And Athena is at the center of it all.\"",
      "It should not have bothered him so much, the idea of a squabble between siblings.",
      "The idea of Athena facing certain ridicule tonight should have pleased him, if anything.",
      "But the thought of Aphrodite unleashing her vengeance on her sister made him incredibly uneasy and the itch to warn Athena was growing.",
      "\"Ares...\" \"Don't.\"",
      "he hissed, halting the God of Wine before he could say anymore.",
      "\"I will get her to speak to me before the night is done.",
      "I will not hear more of it from you, or anyone.\"",
      "\"Hmm.\"",
      "was all that left Dionysus' lips as he took another sip of his wine, letting Ares battle with his thoughts..",
      "\"You seem distracted tonight.\"",
      "The laughter that had bubbled from Athena's lips died in an instant and her gaze flickered from Diomedes to Ares for the briefest of moments, then to her sister, who was working her charms on some poor, unsuspecting mortal.",
      "\"I have a few things running through my head tonight, yes.\"",
      "she admitted with a small nod, \"But this night is about you, my friend.\"",
      "Diomedes chuckled, reaching out as if to cup her cheek but stopping himself at the last minute; it was frustrating, really, his need to remember formalities.",
      "He was a mortal, she was a Goddess, but above all that, he was her friend and it saddened her to think that he put her status above their friendship.",
      "\"Well I am here if you need someone to speak to.",
      "You know that.\"",
      "He told her, and while it was not the extremely comforting gesture he would have made when he was a younger, Athena accepted it with a smile.",
      "\"Athena, it is time.\"",
      "The Goddess of Wisdom turned to face Dionysus, who was wearing a lazy grin on his lips.",
      "Sighing, Athena turned back to Diomedes and gave him an apologetic smile, \"It seems I must take my leave, but do enjoy yourself and don't worry so much.",
      "You are going to be a wonderful king, I know it.\"",
      "Diomedes chuckled once more and nodded, \"I make no promises.",
      "Until next time, Athena.\"",
      "Athena nodded, \"Until next time.\"",
      "with that, she turned her back on the young king and proceeded to glare at the God of Wine.",
      "\"What?",
      "You agreed to accompany Aphrodite.",
      "She just happens to be a little busy with one of her many...pets.\"",
      "Dionysus murmured dryly, taking a sip of wine.",
      "Athena folded her arms over her chest, a thin brow rising, \"Is that jealousy I hear?\" Dionysus scoffed, \"Your sister is not worth that much.",
      "And I got the better sister in the end.\"",
      "There was a smirk on his lips, brows wiggling suggestively as he looked over at her and she felt her cheeks flush.",
      "\"Never speak of that again.",
      "Is that not what we promised?\"",
      "\"Oh, but it's so much fun watching you squirm.\"",
      "He sighed.",
      "Athena scowled, giving the God of Wine a shove that he returned with a smirk on his lips as they came to a stop.",
      "\"You seem to be enjoying yourselves.\"",
      "Athena tensed, the voice that filled her ears belonging to the one person she'd intended on avoiding the entire night.",
      "Shooting Dionysus the darkest look she could muster, she turned her attention to the God of War.",
      "\"Is that a problem?\"",
      "\"Not in the slightest.\"",
      "he answered coolly, giving a small shrug before tossing her one of the blades he had been carrying, \"But you and I are up first, and I'd imagine you might want to prepare beforehand.\"",
      "Athena's eyes widened the slightest bit, still she managed to catch the blade by its hilt with practiced ease.",
      "\"First?",
      "We're going up against each other?",
      "I did not agree to this.\"",
      "Her attention had turned to Dionysus, a sudden rage threatening to take place of her usually cool and collected demeanor.",
      "The God of Wine did his best to seem nonchalant and merely shrugged, \"The results were drawn up randomly, dear Athena.",
      "It was Aphrodite's idea.\"",
      "Suddenly everything clicked; Aphrodite wanting her to show up, the kindness her sister had shown her, the teasing about her night with Ares - Aphrodite didn't simply want to laugh at her misery, she wanted everyone else to laugh along with her.",
      "\"Not frightened, are you?\" Ares asked, a cocky smirk on his lips.",
      "Athena's eyes narrowed and she took a single step toward the God of War, \"I'll have you on your back before the night is done.\"",
      "Ares' brows rose, and only then did it occur to Athena just how horrible her choice of words had been, \"Oh, I'm sure you will.\"",
      "For that moment, rational thought and level-headedness left her.",
      "\"You know that is not how I meant it.\"",
      "She snapped.",
      "Ares shrugged, \"I only know what has left your lips; you do enjoy your secrets.\"",
      "Ares did well to seem particularly stoic about the statement, but she sensed the faintest amount of hurt radiating off of him and knew he was thinking about that night.",
      "\"There are no secrets!\"",
      "Athena hissed, taking another step towards him and jabbing him in the chest with her index finger, \"I was drunk.",
      "It was poor judgment on my part to listen to Aphrodite when half the time she's doing nothing but coming up with convoluted plans to make me miserable.",
      "Very poor judgment, but it is over and done with.",
      "Nothing can change what happened, but I can damn well choose to ignore it, so you best forget it ever happened.\"",
      "His eyes --- damn those eyes again --- narrowed, darkening as his hand came up, fingers closing around her wrist before he jerked her forward.",
      "She stumbled, chest colliding with his but before she could protest, he was already speaking, \"Gods we may be, Athena --- equal in more ways than one, you and I ---but do not think for one second that I will not put you in your place for trying to tell me what to do.\"",
      "\"Don't make me laugh.\"",
      "she muttered darkly, seeming unfazed by the sudden lack of space between them, \"You're more a monster than a God.\"",
      "Rage flashed in those eyes of his, but just as quickly, she was being pulled back and Dionysus' voice was filling her ears.",
      "\"Now, now, children, play nice.\"",
      "he purred, an arm wrapped loosely around her waist as he led her away, \"The tournament has yet to start and you know our rules.",
      "No bloodshed before a tournament.\"",
      "Athena scoffed, \"This is you talking about a brute who lives off the death and bloodshed of innocents.",
      "He cannot resist.\"",
      "\"Coming from the Goddess of Wisdom.\"",
      "Ares snapped, \"Where is that level-headed, clear minded brilliance of yours now, Athena?\" \"Enough!\"",
      "Dionysus shouted, startling the two of them; it was rare to see the usually laid-back God lose his patience with anyone.",
      "\"Dionysus--\" \"Don't.\"",
      "Dionysus sighed, reaching up to massage his temples, \"I swear the two of you will be the death of me.\"",
      "Athena, feeling the guilt sink in, offered him a faint smile and breathed, \"Don't be ridiculous, Dionysus, you're a God, you cannot die.\"",
      "Dionysus snorted, but Athena caught sight of the smile that threatened to slip onto his lips, \"You two are coming particular close to making death a possibility.\"",
      "\"Ah, but you know that if given the choice,\" Ares added, a smirk on his lips as he trained his attention on his friend, and not the irritating Goddess but a few feet away from him, \"You would not bear to be without us.\"",
      "\"You assume too much.\"",
      "Dionysus quipped, sending each of them pointed looks, \"Can you at least be civil with one another for the night? Athena--\" \"Yes?\"",
      "She questioned immediately, stepping towards him despite the need to keep herself as far away from Ares as possible at the moment.",
      "\"Do not let Aphrodite get the best of you tonight.\"",
      "Dionysus grinned, \"It would be disappointing not to get the chance to watch her explode in all her anger when things do not happen as she wishes them to.\"",
      "Athena rolled her eyes, but a small laugh left her lips before her gaze landed on Ares, stormy eyes locking with those ocean blue eyes that had been seared into her mind.",
      "\"I'll be civil, if he is.\"",
      "The corner of his lips twitched and Athena couldn't figure out if it was the threat of a smirk or a snarl that was the reason behind it, \"I shall, on one condition.\"",
      "Athena pursed her lips, entirely aware of Dionysus tensing beside her; there was only one thing Ares wanted from her---the truth.",
      "\"What condition would that be?\"",
      "\"A conversation, tonight, with the guarantee of your complete honesty.\"",
      "\"Ares--\" \"You wanted our civility, Dionysus, I'm simply stating my conditions for it.",
      "She can agree or disagree and we shall work from there.\"",
      "Ares continued, never breaking the eye contact.",
      "After a few more moments of hesitation, Athena gave a curt nod.",
      "\"Fine.",
      "But nowhere my sister can send any of her little minions to keep an eye on us.\"",
      "Ares grimaced, \"That would be preferred.\"",
      "\"Well, you two could have your conversation in my humble abode.\"",
      "Dionysus interjected.",
      "The two of them turned to Dionysus with a brow raised.",
      "\"Oh?\" Athena questioned.",
      "\"I have a place on the mortal plane --- a place no one knows about.",
      "It's well hidden, and a place Aphrodite knows nothing about.\"",
      "Dionysus shrugged, \"Even I needed some time away from that big... personality of hers back then.\"",
      "The other two Gods snorted, folding their arms over their chests in a synchronized fashion --- something they seemed entirely oblivious to, but Dionysus took careful note of it with a quirked brow of his own and a sly little grin.",
      "\"Good, good.\"",
      "he chirped, \"Now that that's settled, I do believe the two of you have a tournament to start off.\"",
      "Dionysus threw an arm around each of them, conjuring them glasses of wine that they took without debate as he led them in the direction of city's palaestra; it still irritated Athena that Dionysus had decided to throw the Gods together in Argos, considering the last thing Diomedes needed at the moment was absolute chaos caused by the Gods, but she would have to speak to Dionysus about that later.",
      "She had a battle to prepare for..",
      "His blood was rushing in his ears, not from rage, but from excitement; his body knew he was anxiously awaiting a battle.",
      "And not just any battle, a battle with Athena.",
      "His equal in more ways than one.",
      "His rival.",
      "Stepping into the arena of the palaestra was invigorating; the cheers of his fellow Gods filling his ears, the lot of them no doubt having placed their bets on him.",
      "They weren't stupid enough to bet against him, he'd wager.",
      "When Athena stepped out, however, it seemed there was a ripple in the small crowd.",
      "There was hesitance and uncertainty laced with anticipation, and it irritated him; they knew, they all knew that if anyone could take him down it would be her.",
      "\"Well, then,\" Dionysus' voice echoed among them, \"Let us begin, shall we?\" Ares snorted as the cheers and screams erupted once more; leave it to a crowd of Gods and to encourage absolute chaos on the mortal plane.",
      "If Zeus were around they'd be running with their tails between their legs, all of them.",
      "\"All's fair.",
      "Don't kill each other, you two.\"",
      "There were snickers among the crowd, and Ares spotted Aphrodite smirking cheekily on the opposite side of the palaestra.",
      "He really wished he could permanently wipe the damn thing off of her face.",
      "\"Begin.\"",
      "They immediately took a defensive stance; Athena had been, without a doubt, expecting him to attack first, so his defensive stance took her by surprise --- he could see it written all over her face, even hidden underneath her helmet.",
      "He refused to make the first move, however.",
      "Until she would, he decided to observe her carefully --- she'd left the blade he'd handed her earlier for two smaller ones of her own.",
      "She favored those, he knew, and while they worked well with her, using them left her without the option of a shield.",
      "They left her without defenses.",
      "He knew she was quick, whenever she did join a battle, but he'd never actually seen her in battle in person and he was curious.",
      "Was she really well enough to risk leaving herself as open as she was?",
      "By now they were circling each other, both seemingly against making the first move and he was growing impatient.",
      "He needed to move, but him going in first was exactly what she wanted, and --- no doubt --- what Aphrodite was expecting.",
      "The last thing he wanted was to please her.",
      "\"Scared, Ares?\"",
      "Athena called out, surprising him --- and her sister, from the look he spotted on her face in the stands.",
      "He had to fight the urge to smirk up at her and instead scoffed.",
      "\"Hardly.\"",
      "\"You're playing it safe.",
      "It's terribly unlike you.\"",
      "she called out, relaxing her stance.",
      "She was baiting him; how cheap a trick.",
      "Unfortunately it was working.",
      "He was itching to charge towards her and knock her off her damn feet.",
      "\"And what would you know about what I'm like, darling?\" he called out through gritted teeth.",
      "\"Enough to know that your recklessness led to me sending an entire fleet of yours to the bottom of the ocean.\"",
      "That was a low blow.",
      "He was running toward her before he even realized what he was doing; his fingers were wrapped tightly around the hilt of his blade, held up as he ran towards her, ready to strike, but as he'd known she would be, she was quick.",
      "She used one blade to stop his incoming strike, holding his from landing a clean blow to her pretty little head while she worked the other one past his shield to get a good, clean cut to his left side.",
      "He glared at her for a moment, hating the stupid smirk that made its way onto her lips; she'd drawn first blood.",
      "As stupid and insignificant as the wound was, she knew well enough about him to know that he always drew first blood.",
      "From then on it was no mercy; blow after blow they went at it.",
      "He drew blood soon after, though her wound was significantly worse than the one she gave him, deeper, bigger but he'd made sure to mark her in the exact same place she'd marked him; they all knew then, he was making a statement.",
      "He would be mimicking any wounds she inflicted on him to prove that no matter what damage she got in, he would work the battle in his favor.",
      "Time seemed to fly by the longer their battle ran; both of them bleeding and bruised, breathing heavily on their respective sides of the arena as they stared each other down.",
      "The battle was slowly coming to a close and even they weren't entirely sure which one of them would come out of this the victor.",
      "\"I said I'd have you on your back by the end of the night.\"",
      "She called out, angling herself in a nearly frontal stance, her body turned only slightly sideways as she looked at him, \"So, let's finish this.\"",
      "He was too distracted to even comment on the choice of words she'd so blindly uttered earlier in the night; he needed to end this, once and for all.",
      "He needed to put this damn woman in her place.",
      "Tossing his shield to the side, he charged again.",
      "She was, of course, ready for him, blocking his blow with one blade.",
      "Instead of using the other to land a blow of her own, she made a full turn, coming up behind him and kicked the backs of his knees, forcing him onto them as she knocked his blade out of his hand.",
      "Once that was done, she had both of hers pressed against the base of his neck.",
      "\"Not quite on your back, but I'll take what I can get.\"",
      "she breathed.",
      "\"Oh, I'm sure you'd have much preferred having me on my back.\"",
      "he responded cheekily, reaching up to run his fingers along her arm.",
      "He could feel the goose flesh forming on her skin, feel her trembling even as she pressed the blades deeper into his skin, somehow managing to keep from piercing it as she did so.",
      "\"You never stop, do you?\" she hissed.",
      "He truly enjoyed getting her worked up; logic flew right on out the window when he did so.",
      "It was why he was able to reach up and wrap his fingers around both of her wrists and pull her forward as he ducked down.",
      "She landed on her back with a heavy thud and a gasp, but he didn't hesitate.",
      "He straddled her hips, fingers still wrapped around her wrists as he slammed them onto the ground hard enough to make it hurt and force her to let go of the blades in her hands out of reflex.",
      "He smirked down at her as the end flag was raised, signaling him the victor.",
      "\"What was that about having me on my back?\"",
      "She simply glared up at him in response; not really all that surprising, considering it was her.",
      "Still, he held her in place for a few moments more, trying to keep his mind from straying towards the only other time he had her lithe form underneath him.",
      "Shaking his head, he finally released her and pushed himself to his feet.",
      "He quickly dusted himself off and held a hand out to her, offering to help her up but she simply ignored it and lifted herself up.",
      "\"Did you honestly expect any different, Athena?\"",
      "He questioned, hooded gaze trained on her, \"Wise and Intelligent you may be, you are still young---\" \"Spare me.\"",
      "She interjected, tone clipped, \"I hear enough about still being too young in regards to certain things from Zeus, I do not need --- or want --- it from you as well.",
      "You won, congratulations.\"",
      "\"Athena--\" \"Well that was a bummer.\"",
      "He didn't know how she'd gotten their so quickly, but Aphrodite was there, resting a hand on his shoulder as she looked at Athena, a sympathetic look on her face.",
      "\"I had such hopes that you'd put our dear Ares in his place, sister.\"",
      "Aphrodite sighed.",
      "Athena seemed even more livid than before.",
      "\"I'm sure you did.\"",
      "\"Oh, well.",
      "Perhaps another time.\"",
      "She quipped, turning her attention then to Ares, all seductive looks and sly smirks.",
      "\"I do believe congratulations are in order.\"",
      "He really should have expected it.",
      "Aphrodite's hand slid to the back of his neck and pulled him in.",
      "Their lips met and, instinctively, his hands came to rest on her hips; it was something he was familiar with, but he pulled back almost immediately, eyes searching for Athena, but all he saw were the blonde curls bouncing about from underneath the rim of her helmet as she stormed out of the palaestra.",
      "\"Tsk, tsk.",
      "So dramatic, she is.\"",
      "Aphrodite chirped, pushing herself away, a smirk on her red lips, \"It was only a silly tournament.\"",
      "\"What game are you playing at?\" Ares hissed, wrapping his fingers around her arm and yanking her towards him.",
      "Her own eyes darkened, and she muttered, \"You're hurting me.",
      "I'd hardly imagine you would want to be interrogating me when you have other opponents to face, Ares.\"",
      "The nerve of this woman.",
      "Tightening his grip on her the slightest bit more, he shoved her back and made his way in the direction Athena had gone.",
      "Dionysus was at his side in an instant, \"Leaving now would mean being followed, Ares.",
      "Aphrodite would know where to find you.",
      "Let her go.",
      "I will make sure she shows up when she needs to.\"",
      "Ares stopped just short of exiting, hands curling into fists to keep himself from lashing out.",
      "\"Fine.",
      "I shall stay.\"",
      "Dionysus gave him a wry grin and clapped him on the shoulder, \"Don't kill anyone; you turn monstrous whenever you're taking your anger out on your opponents.",
      "They don't deserve the anger you need to be directing at Aphrodite.\"",
      "\"Yes, well, unfortunately I can't kill her either.\"",
      "Ares hissed, \"There's no winning with you.\"",
      "Dionysus snorted, \"There's no winning with you.",
      "Remember, you 'can't help it'?\" Ares rolled his eyes and gave the God of Wine a light shrug, \"Go on, get out of here.",
      "I... won't kill anyone.\"",
      "Dionysus' brows rose.",
      "\"Alright, alright, however, I make no promises that I will not cause serious injury.\"",
      "\"Of course you don't.\".",
      "Athena was furious; more with herself than anyone else.",
      "She had told herself time and again, throughout the entire night, that she would not let Aphrodite get the better of her.",
      "She was not going to let her sister see just how easy it was to get at her.",
      "But she let it happen anyway.",
      "And all because of that damn Ares.",
      "\"Athena.\"",
      "She was tempted to stop and snap at Dionysus, but she knew that if she stopped moving for a single moment, her resolve would weaken and she would give in to whatever it was he wanted.",
      "\"Go away, Dionysus.\"",
      "She murmured, walking a little faster than she previously had been.",
      "\"Damn it, Athena now is not the time to throw logic away.",
      "Do you not see this is exactly what Aphrodite wants?\"",
      "He called out, quickly catching up and falling into step with her.",
      "\"I don't care, I'm done with it.",
      "Done with her and done with him.\"",
      "\"No, you're not.\"",
      "Dionysus sighed, wrapping his fingers around her wrist and pulling her to a stop.",
      "\"Athena, you will never be done with him.",
      "Just as he will never be done with you.",
      "I know him and I know you.\"",
      "She wanted nothing more than to run away.",
      "To avoid having this conversation with Dionysus or anyone because it would lead to nothing but trouble.",
      "But she knew he was right; she would never truly be done with him.",
      "A part of her would always long for some part of him.",
      "The snark, the rivalry, the similarity, familiarity.",
      "As often as they were at each others' throats, they were probably the only people who understood each other completely without words.",
      "\"You gave word to meet with him tonight.",
      "I think you should keep your word.\"",
      "She turned to face Dionysus, keeping her expression carefully guarded before relenting with a small sigh.",
      "\"Lead the way.\"",
      "The God of Wine simply grinned and slipped his hand into hers, \"I'm starting to regret not keeping you for myself.\"",
      "Athena snorted and let him lead the way.",
      "\"Idiot.\"",
      "Dionysus' grin widened, \"But I'm your idiot.\".",
      "Time had gone by unbearably slow for Ares, but he'd defeated each and every one of his opponents with a fierceness not a single one of them had ever seen.",
      "He wanted to be done with them all.",
      "It was far past nightfall by the time things were over and done with and he wasted no time in making his way to the inconspicuous little cottage Dionysus kept.",
      "He was probably the only person besides Dionysus himself that knew of its existence, so it wasn't very difficult to get there.",
      "When he arrived, his friend was just making his way out, the glamour he'd worn in front of the mortals slipping back on effortlessly.",
      "\"I almost thought you wouldn't show.\"",
      "Dionysus called out, a teasing grin on his lips.",
      "\"I called for this, did you really think I'd let the opportunity slip right through my fingers?\" Ares huffed, crossing his arms over his chest and coming to a stop right in front of the God of Wine.",
      "\"Just...\" Dionysus paused, pursing his lips before clapping Ares on the shoulder, \"Don't kill each other, please.\"",
      "Ares snorted and nodded, taking it as a dismissal and making his way inside.",
      "The place was downplayed, simple; such a completely different look from the lavish home they all shared on Olympus.",
      "It was really quite brilliant to believe Dionysus had realized that Aphrodite would never assume Dionysus of all people could lower himself to a place such as this just to get away from her prying eyes.",
      "\"You're rather silent.\"",
      "Her voice rang in his ears and automatically he tensed; it was a habitual reaction.",
      "Something he'd become so accustomed to doing it was almost impossible for him to not do it.",
      "\"As I recall,\" She continued, coming into his line of vision from the right, lacking her armor and helm; once again left in that lovely gown that had made it impossible for him to tear his eyes away from her.",
      "\"This entire arrangement was your idea.",
      "Or am I wasting my time in being here?\"",
      "He knew what she was doing; playing her cards well.",
      "Keeping her walls up and being every bit the cold, logical Goddess of Wisdom that she was --- it was such an easy, familiar guise for her to slip into.",
      "Ignoring the emotions, the tugging at her heartstrings --- it was second nature to her to fall into them.",
      "He didn't want logic, or reason, though.",
      "He wanted the truth.",
      "\"What happened that night?\"",
      "He breathed, watching her carefully; being who she was, it wasn't all that difficult for her to lie her way through any situation and make it seem like the absolute truth, so he needed to make sure he caught the slightest of ticks, the smallest flicker of emotion in her eyes, across her face.",
      "He could not risk missing them.",
      "A heavy sigh left her lips then, but he wasn't sure if she was getting ready to speak the truth, or lie straight to his face despite her having given him her word earlier.",
      "\"I... I wasn't even supposed to be there that night; I had not planned on it.",
      "I wanted to stay home.\"",
      "She breathed, running a hand through the now unruly golden curls that fell past her shoulders.",
      "\"But Aphrodite wanted me to help her get one of her toys off her case; someone who'd gotten a little too attached and refused to leave her be.",
      "I was to be a distraction while she met up with someone else.\"",
      "That explained her presence there, the mix up when he'd first seen her and he could not, for the life of him, figure out who she was.",
      "From there, it was easy to figure out that she'd been affected by Dionysus' spirits at some point.",
      "More likely than not, before she'd stepped up to the battles that were happening just outside; he doubted Athena, as she normally was, would have been as brash as she'd been then.",
      "\"And I haven't the slightest clue what Dionysus handed me, but I drank it in one go and before I knew it, I was in a heated argument with you.\"",
      "She finally turned to face him, jade eyes shining silver in the moonlight that shone through the curtains.",
      "\"You were so damn infuriating, and in the state that I was in, logic and reason escaped me.\"",
      "He had to fight the urge to smirk at her statement; memories of how infuriated she became flashing across his mind.",
      "It had been rather amusing.",
      "Well, at least in the moment where he'd managed to outwit her.",
      "The rest of the time she was just as infuriating.",
      "\"I fled as quickly as I could once you were distracted; I was supposed to be there for my sister, not dealing with some brute too proud to admit when he'd been outwitted.\"",
      "He opened his mouth to spew some insult her way but she glowered at him and continued before he had the chance.",
      "\"The mask --- bless that stupid thing --- had kept you from realizing who I was.",
      "As far as you knew, I was just some stupid girl, too bold for her own good.",
      "And then--\" \"And then I found a mask of my own.\"",
      "He interrupted, tilting his head to the side as he continued to watch her.",
      "\"And we ended up--\" \"Details aren't needed.\"",
      "She quickly interrupted, and he swore he saw the faintest of flushes on her cheeks.",
      "\"We were both there at this point.",
      "When I awoke, you were still asleep and my curiosity got the best of me; who could this masked stranger --- so easy to converse with, so understanding of my rants and opinions compared to every drunken idiot in that place --- be?\"",
      "She paused, turned her gaze to her hands and cleared her throat, \"I should have expected it, but I didn't.",
      "And the minute the mask was off, I ran.\"",
      "\"And I awoke just as you exited my chambers.\"",
      "He murmured.",
      "Athena said nothing then and he continued, \"Only I found Aphrodite instead.\"",
      "\"Lovely little tricks she has, right?\" Athena responded bitterly.",
      "\"All perfect gifts for manipulation.",
      "I'm starting to believe that's the only thing she's capable of anymore.\"",
      "\"So that's that.\"",
      "He muttered, dark brows furrowing.",
      "\"It was just another of Aphrodite's games.\"",
      "\"It wasn't...\" Athena shook her head, \"Not initially.",
      "Until she found out what had occurred between the two of us.",
      "It was as if then the gears in her head started working and she wanted nothing more than to make me admit that I had enjoyed myself for once because of her--\" Ares head jerked up and he stared at her with wide eyes, \"Did you?\" Athena paused, her own brows furrowing, \"Did I what?\" \"Enjoy yourself.",
      "That night?\" Her cheeks flushed, \"I...I--\" \"You gave word you would be completely honest.\"",
      "He reminded her, hating the hope that seeped into his words.",
      "\"It was not the worst night of my life.\"",
      "She told him, crossing her arms over her chest and he grinned.",
      "\"Better than your night with Dionysus?\" Her eyes narrowed into slits then and she stomped towards him, jabbing him in the chest with his index finger.",
      "\"Never speak of that.",
      "I know he's told you the rules in regards to that night.\"",
      "\"The deflowering of the Virgin Goddess, Athena.\"",
      "He murmured with an over dramatic sigh.",
      "\"Must have been an interesting night.\"",
      "\"Ares, I am warning you.\"",
      "She hissed, ready to jab him in the chest again when his fingers wrapped around her wrist.",
      "He turned dark eyes on her, his quick temper bubbling underneath the surface, making him tighten his hold on her wrist just the slightest.",
      "\"Do we need to replay tonight's battle, Athena?\"",
      "She looked ready to kill for a brief moment, and a part of him loved it; she was simply a marvel sometimes in moments like these.",
      "The urge for battle burning just underneath the surface.",
      "It was one of those moments where they were sharing the same thoughts, the same longing for battle and urge to just... hit something.",
      "Or someone.",
      "But of course those moment never lasted long.",
      "Logic and reason always came back for her with a vengeance..",
      "\"Let me go, Ares.\"",
      "She gritted out, willing herself to relax in his hold; to avoid letting the irrational part of her take over and lash out at him.",
      "\"Why did you run?\" Athena blinked, thrown off for a moment before realizing he was referring to that night.",
      "\"I was mortified.\"",
      "She told him honestly.",
      "\"I'd spent the night making a complete fool of myself, drunk off my ass and I wake up in the bed of my supposed rival.",
      "I was in no place to think clearly so I ran.",
      "To find some sort of middle ground.",
      "A place to think, and come down from all the insanity that had ensued.\"",
      "And of course she left out the part where she realized that she'd enjoyed herself completely.",
      "Where she couldn't bring herself to regret what it was that it had happened between them and that it had most definitely been far better than her night with Dionysus.",
      "He didn't need all that information to hold over her.",
      "\"There's something you're not telling me.\"",
      "He breathed, leaning forward and making her breath catch in her throat; why the hell had she allowed herself to get so damn close to him?",
      "\"I haven't a clue what you're talking about.",
      "You asked and I answered.\"",
      "She responded, refusing to look him in the eyes.",
      "\"As cold and distant as always.\"",
      "He murmured, \"Why don't you try answering me with some emotion, my dear, then maybe I'll believe you.\"",
      "\"I...\" She trailed off, finding herself distracted by just how close his face had come to hers, \"Ares, you're being ridiculous.",
      "You asked me for my honesty and that's exactly what I'm giving you.\"",
      "She was simply choosing to leave some of the truth out.",
      "\"I'm not letting you out of here until you tell me the whole truth.\"",
      "Her patience was wearing thin, and she knew he would follow through with his words, so with a stomp of her foot, she hissed, \"I was terrified because I liked it.",
      "I liked you.",
      "Your company, the way you felt against me that night.",
      "Because for the first time in a long time, I had someone who understood me, who I could speak to and it turned out to be you!",
      "The God of War.",
      "My rival.",
      "My enemy.",
      "I hadn't even met you and I was raised loathing you.",
      "You were nothing more than a monster in my eyes and I didn't even know who you were.",
      "Then I met you, and you simply confirmed all everyone had ever uttered about you.",
      "Until you slipped on that stupid mask.",
      "Until you tricked me.\"",
      "Her breath caught in her throat then and she felt her eyes burning but willed herself not to give in to the angry tears.",
      "\"You tricked me and when I took off that mask you weren't a monster anymore.",
      "Everything about you was not the way it should have been in my head and I was so confused, and so damn terrified so I ran.",
      "It was easier for me to forget that it had ever happened than to accept that I had been wrong about you.",
      "But then Aphrodite got her hands on you and it hurt.",
      "It actually hurt and I couldn't just forget.",
      "So I tried to hate you that much more.",
      "And it was working so damn well for me.\"",
      "\"Athena.\"",
      "\"No! You don't get to speak.",
      "You wanted me to talk, so now you listen.\"",
      "She gritted, twisting her wrist free from his grasp.",
      "Miraculously, he let her.",
      "\"I hate you.",
      "I need to hate you.",
      "It's the only thing that makes sense.",
      "The only thing that makes things seem like they're normal.",
      "Like they're okay.",
      "Because you are the God of War and I'm not supposed to love you!\"",
      "His blue eyes widened and Athena's heart dropped to her stomach; \"N-No.",
      "That isn't-- I didn't mean--\" \"Shut up, Athena.\"",
      "He growled, slipping a hand to the back of her neck and pressing his lips against hers so violently, she was positive she'd bruise regardless of their godly gifts.",
      "Logic had her fighting at first; her hands slammed against his chest repeatedly and she bit down hard on his lip in an attempt to get him to stop, but it only seemed to spur him on and soon enough, he was slamming her into one of the walls.",
      "The action was so sudden, it pulled a pained gasp from her lips and made her wonder if they'd have the whole building in ruins by the time the sun rose.",
      "\"Ares--\" He groaned against her lips, but pulled back, allowing her to breathe and she was grateful; she could think, even if just for a moment.",
      "\"This can--\" \"Don't you dare finish that sentence, Athena, don't.\"",
      "he breathed, nuzzling into her neck.",
      "\"You want it to happen, I know you do.",
      "Put the logic aside and throw reason out the window for once and let this happen.\"",
      "\"I refuse to be a conquest of yours.\"",
      "She murmured quietly, refusing to look at him even as he tensed against her.",
      "\"Is that honestly all you think this is?",
      "All I see you as?",
      "Another conquest?\"",
      "He spat.",
      "\"It's hard not to think in such a way; when have you ever heard anyone say you've bedded anyone out of love?",
      "Lust, desire, maybe.",
      "But you can't blame me for being wary.",
      "You did spend a majority of time with my sister recently, remember?\" the words tasted bitter leaving her lips, and she knew jealousy was coming off of her in waves, but she was way past the point of hiding that.",
      "\"I want you to listen to me carefully, Athena.\"",
      "He breathed out, \"I loath your sister with a passion--\" \"And that didn't stop you from bedding her.",
      "That says a great deal about my decision, don't you think?\"",
      "\"Damn it, Athena, let me speak.\"",
      "he growled out, slamming a hand down on the wall she was currently pressed up against.",
      "\"Aphrodite meant nothing.",
      "I knew how she was, how she is; attachment with her would have been the stupidest thing ever.",
      "The only reason I spent my nights with her was because she was as close to you as I could get.",
      "She's more a monster than you ever saw me to be and you know it.",
      "So, if I can't have you for all of eternity because you refuse to believe it's possible for the two of us, then let me have you if only for tonight.\"",
      "That hurt her heart far more than she'd expected it to.",
      "But he was right.",
      "He knew her well enough to understand that she saw them as the rest of Olympus would.",
      "Rivals.",
      "Enemies.",
      "At odds with one another for the entirety of their existence.",
      "Never lovers.",
      "Slowly, almost shyly, Athena brought her hands up to cup his face in them; gently, as if he were made of glass.",
      "Meeting his eyes, she only gave the smallest of nods before leaning forward and pressing her lips against his.",
      "It was so soft and sweet and so unlike him that it just about broke her heart, thinking that this would be the one and only time they'd ever be able to do this.",
      "The only time she'd ever allow them to do this.",
      "Suddenly, the kiss grew violent; teeth grazing against his and tongues battling for dominance as she pulled him as close as he would come.",
      "She needed him as close as he could get and even closer if possible, but the armor that was still firmly attached to his body was in the way.",
      "A soft, irritated growl left her lips and he chuckled.",
      "Quickly, though, he got rid of his breast plate, letting it fall to the stone floor with a loud clang and returned to kissing her, his upper body now bare and pressing right up against her.",
      "His skin was hot against her, even through the thin material of the gown she adorned.",
      "Quickly growing frustrated with it as she'd done with his armor, Athena pushed Ares back and started removing all the armbands and necklaces, letting them fall to the floor before she worked on the sash at her waist and pushed the gown off of her shoulders.",
      "It hit the floor soundlessly and just like that, she was standing completely vulnerable in front of him.",
      "The look on his face was one she knew she wouldn't be forgetting any time soon, eyes darkened with lust and half-lidded as he took her in completely.",
      "He reached for her, wanting to touch her, she imagined, but he stopped himself and continued to admire her for a few moments more, simply taking her in.",
      "It was terrifying, like being under scrutiny; Athena had never felt beautiful.",
      "She was not beautiful, not like Aphrodite was, but the way he looked at her made her feel like the most beautiful creature in all of existence.",
      "\"Ares.\"",
      "She breathed, so quietly it sounded more like a whimper.",
      "As if on command, he discarded the last of his clothing and walked to her, lifting her without hesitation and carrying her to the bed in the other room.",
      "He hovered above her as their lips met once again and Athena slid her hands up his back, pulling him closer and moaning softly as he rolled his hips against hers.",
      "She brought her legs up around his waist at that moment, locking her ankles together at the small of his back and moving her lips against his in the most desperate kiss she'd ever experienced.",
      "Athena never thought it was possible to want someone so much.",
      "So intensely.",
      "His hands worked their way down her sides, palming and caressing just as his cock pushed past her opening, pulling a soft whimper from her lips.",
      "Her fingers dug into his back as he eased himself into her and Athena forced herself to bite back a moan despite the fact that no one was around to hear them.",
      "\"Athena,\" he breathed once he was fully inside her, his forehead resting against the crook of her neck.",
      "\"Beautiful, beautiful Athena.\"",
      "Her name left his lips like a prayer, and she wanted the moment to last forever.",
      "But she kissed him again, lips moving against his in a hungry kiss and suddenly he was moving fast and hard; thrust after thrust sending spasms throughout her entire body and making her scream.",
      "She didn't think anything could have been as amazing as that night had been, but this was better; because it was them, together.",
      "Open and vulnerable and --- even if just for the night --- completely free.",
      "All too soon, the coil of heat in her lower abdomen that had been pulling itself taught snapped and her vision was laced white as she came, nails dragging down his back, breaking skin and his name leaving her lips in a loud moan.",
      "Exhaustion was quick to wrap itself around her, but she fought to stay conscious, kissing and sucking and licking areas on his neck and chest until his thrusts stuttered to a stop and he shot his seed inside of her, groaning and collapsing on top of her.",
      "A soft grunt left her lips at his weight and he quickly shifted to the side, murmuring a soft apology before wrapping his arms around her and pulling her to him.",
      "In the distance, Apollo was preparing to rise with the sun itself and Athena knew she'd have to flee once more, but for the moment, she'd allow herself to savor the moment.",
      "Savor the side only she would ever get to see when it came to the God of War. fin."

    "text": "The shadows darted in and out in front of her. Wherever she turned, they were there. Omnipresent. Like dangerous predators stalking her, ready to strike. Her bare feet lightly touched the ground as she ran through the palace. The beautiful marble walls were splattered with blood. White on red. Red on white. White on red. The fiery red locks she possessed had long since tumbled out of their barrette and flew along behind her. The crimson rays of sunset drifted down from the oculus in the domed roof and dappled her pale neck, reminiscent of something else altogether. Every door she reached was locked. Her frail hands grasped the knobs with a wild, feral desperation, clawing like a frightnened animal. Tugging until energy drained out of her, like colour bleeding out of her; she was as ghostly as an apparition of war, an angel of death. The blood red ringlets cascaded down her back, akin to a waterfall of the very liquid that flowed through the veins. And each room, the monster was there, what is to come over what it is now. Andromache's delicate wrists shackled together as she cradled the broken body of her son. (The crown princess was tenderly rocking her newborn son, who wailed like any other newborn child.) Hektor's eyes closed for eternity, grand garments of battle sullied by the dust he was dragged through. (Her heroic brother strode purposefully forwards, kissing his wife goodbye and readying himself for the trials of the day.) King Priam, kneeling in the filthy muck, pleading sadly for his son's corpse, to bury his pride and joy. (Her father stood and the castle's walls, smiling at their momentary victory, proud as ever.) Queen Hecuba chained to the walls, her fine robes dirtied by the filth on the wooden deck, face bent in sorrow and arms straining to reach out and comfort her daughters. (Her mother was seated primly in the banquet hall, haughtily greeting the guests.) Polyxana laid dead upon Achilles' grave, blood pouring from her throat. (Her sassy little sister was dancing through the crowds, delighting everyone.) Screaming till her throat was raw did her no good. There was no one to hear her, none to sympathise with her, to understand. They were so painfully blind. Couldn't they see it? There was no use locking her in this tower, like an exotic pet. Her job was out there. They only had to listen. (The city was used to hearing her shrieks echoing through the still tranquility of night, her little palms banging on the unforgiving stone walls until the thin skin bled profusely, and still she would not stop.) She tried to escape again and again, but it never worked. She could not run from herseld. It was ever around her, next to her, beside her, in her, taking over her mind. It gripped her throat tightly to prevent her from making any sounds, extended its tendrils over her mind. It was her. She understood that. In this godforsaken tower, it sealed away old pretty, charming Cassandra, clever blessed Prophetess, and left behind only her, and it. Its bloody maw was gaping, and it waited, and waited, and waited, for the perfect moment, before it rushed forward and swallowed her, picking her apart from the seams until she was not human anymore.",

    "text": "Tony pulled the belts tight. He could see his fathers receding figure in the distance. Do not fly too close to the sun, his last words to him a warning. Tony took a breath, and then another. Then he jumped. He spread his arms, and closed his eyes, he wanted to scream but he couldn't even catch his breath. Suddenly the wings caught the up draft and he was flying, no, he was soaring. He screamed, finally. It was the most incredible feeling. He caught another up draft from the ocean, and then another. He let out another yell. He had never felt more alive. He could hear his fathers voice in the back of his mind, but the words were not so clear any more. All that mattered was the ascent, higher and higher. He was more than human. He could fly! Something jerked, just above his right shoulder and his movement stuttered. He adjusted his shoulders but it only made it worse. He was descending. He reached over with his left arm, trying to tighten the belt again and he tumbled in the air.

    "text": "\"The Fates but only spin the coarser clue; The finest of the wool is left for you.\" JOHN DRYDEN, Palamon and Arcite. Pandora's arms hurt from shooing eagles away from Prometheus all day. She had a rake but she wished she had something a little more effective at hand. She tugged at Prometheus's chains while he dozed at night, but she knew as well as he that Olympian punishments aren't to be undone by human hands alone. He rolled his head toward her. The waves slapped noisily against the low rocks and he opened his eyes. \"Leave it be.\" She didn't answer him. His wounds were already healed enough to only cause him discomfort, but what relief was that when more pain would come tomorrow? The birds were already gathering and she knew dawn would come all too soon. \"I will free you, if it is the last thing I do.\" He laughed, even as the birds cawed at the sound. \"Silly girl. Your crazy ideas will be the death of us all.\" Pandora ignored him. He knew of the jars she kept behind locked doors, for she had told him often of their beautiful design, the way they hummed beneath her fingers if she stroked them as she passed. He knew of the jars, yes, but he did not know what she planned. She knew he spoke the truth. She could not free him; the chains were as much a part of him as his bones now. Some things were beyond her mortal means, but not all things. Let them see what human hands alone could do. Callisto glinted from her seat high above the Earth. Ageless and endless, she thought of Zeus and Hera often, of how they managed to spurn her even now, aeons into the cosmos. She remembered the burn of trickery as Zeus's plan took shape around her, even as she felt the tug of his offspring growing within her. The aching in her soul as she came to the realisation that she could not fight back, not against this. She remembered the chapped skin of her bear paws, the huff and the spit as she padded through the forest. Most of all she remembered the indignation. It was the reason the Earth turned and she turned with it, hoping against hope to glimpse Arcas on the other side. Semele liked the feel of asphodel between her toes. It was a small reminder of the flora of the world above, and though it was a poor imitation she could shut her eyes and pretend. It was close enough. She was the only mortal, in either world, to know the touch of a true god. Her life had been a fair price to pay for that, she wagered, for what was life in comparison to swaying the hand of the greatest god of all? She had asked to witness Zeus's true form, and he had obliged. She thought of the son she had lost. Dionysus would return her to the land of the living, of that she was certain. After all, he would inherit her determination, her skilful ideas, her gall. Even Zeus could not deny that. The touch of an immortal ached like an infection, raw beneath her skin; it burned like the amniotic pull that she felt whenever she heard news of Dionysus up above. It hurt like pride, like love, like victory. A fair price to pay, indeed. Ariadne slept with the rope twined around her wrist. It was an old habit, hard to break even when she was far, far away from the labyrinth. Dionysus might call her silly, but he had stranger habits and this rope had saved her life many times over. Even in the Underworld, she had hated to be lost. Daedalus had given it to her when she was but a child. He handed it to her as though it were a secret, one that she was too young to fully understand. She asked him what had become of her brother, and what would become of Icarus. She asked him because he seemed to have the answers to all secrets, and no one else would answer her questions. \"Take this,\" he said in reply, \"You will need it.\" \"It's just a rope,\" she had said, confused, but Daedalus shook his head. \"It is never just a rope, Ariadne. This is your way out. The gods have carved a path for us all - even you, child - but that does not mean we have to stick to it. You will never lose your way if you mark your journey with this rope.\" She was unsure, but she took it anyway because it was pretty and because she trusted Daedalus. She didn't know what he meant until many years later. As an adult and an immortal, she knew the importance of having a way out. Euridice's path was laid before her, one foot after the other, as she followed her husband into the light of the living land. He would not look at her. It would drive her mad before too long. \"Orpheus, why?\" She asked, not for the first time. She had been warned not to ask questions, but it only lit her curiosity on fire. It was her nature. \"This is the only way,\" was his reply. She could only see the back of his head, and it worried her. He tugged on her hand, urging her on. She stopped walking. \"And what is that supposed to mean?\" \"It is the will of the gods. Hades and his Queen decreed it so, and look - we are almost there. Come quickly, and this will be over.\" He was right, they were almost there, and Euridice could see daylight, feel the welcome breeze against her skin. The Underworld was dire; she did not know how Persephone could stand it, could not understand why the woman would choose to return there time after time. She thought of her husband, who had had many adventures the likes of which she could not imagine. He had charmed Sirens once, and had travelled the depths of the Underworld simply in search of her. He was a hero, of that she was sure. Euridice let go of his hand. She did not want to follow his footsteps any longer. Cassandra stumbled in Apollo's temple, snakes around her ankles. They licked at her ears, whispered impossible things. Things that had not yet come to pass. She called for Apollo as the snakes moved to her eyes, and she saw fire and dust, purple riches and scarlet blood, and she saw things she did not have names for: monsters in the sky, explosions, godless men and women in cities of metal. She called for Apollo. He did not listen. Years later, she sat with Polyxena on the turrets, watching the sun dip low in the reddened sky. She held up her thumb and traced Apollo's descent with one eye closed and she felt, as surely as she felt her sister beside her, that this would be Troy's last sunset. Polyxena stopped toying with the beads on her dress, and cocked her head at her sister. \"What is wrong?\" Cassandra remembered the time she saw Polyxena's death. It is little balm to know that her sister will die a hero. Cassandra pointed with her thumb. She was never sure of the right words. \"Beware of Greeks bearing gifts.\" Polyxena, who had heard this phrase since before she could remember, shook her head sadly. \"Silly girl.\" Helen had no time for hesitation. As a child she had danced a pretty dance, and Theseus had stolen her away. She had been rescued by her brothers then, her cosmic and dauntless brothers. Afterwards, she vowed to be no one's captive trophy, no one's weakling to be rescued. She grew up strong, and beautiful. She had no time for hesitation. After Paris shot down the greatest mortal warrior, aided by Apollo himself, Helen turned away from him and found her husband in the madness. He welcomed her back to his bed, eagerly, for why else had he come to this forsaken city if not to reclaim her? Long after he fell asleep, Helen smiled beside him, her face against his warm shoulder. Let the men have their battles, she thought, let the gods move them like pieces in a game. Leave the true choices to the women, she thought, for we have no time for hesitation. Iphigenia's dress was more than a little burned, but the ground on which she sat was blissfully cool. She had yet to take a look around, her eyes were still jammed shut from the panic of the sacrifice, but she heard waves, smelt tangy salt in the air. An island maybe, or perhaps she truly had died and was only hearing the Styx. She felt rough hands in her hair, on her temples, tracing the curves of her ears. If this was death, she had better open her eyes. Death was a woman, older than Iphigenia and perhaps as old as her mother. She had hair that seemed mostly to be made of woven forestry, she had a dress of old leather and meshed fabric, and her eyes were brown like a fox's tail. Iphigenia gasped. Death was beautiful. The woman laughed, and tapped her forehead gently. \"I am not Death, child. But you are young, and I must appear strange to you. I do not believe you have ever seen me like this.\" \"I am not dead?\" \"No. You are safe. And you know me, child, as I know you.\" Iphigenia frowned, but the woman stroking her hair twitched a little and Iphigenia saw the bow sling across her shoulders, the glinting of arrowheads inlaid into her necklace. Iphigenia cried, and lowered her head. \"Artemis! My Queen! You saved me; I called to you and you came!\" Artemis took her hand, and it was the grip of ages, the grip of protector and of the victorious. She pulled the young girl to her feet. \"My lady - are we going somewhere?\" It is late when Athena arises. The mountain is still cloaked in sleep and she is not surprised that she is the first to stir, for what good is a Pantheon without Wisdom? She does not wake the others, not yet, and instead she turns her eyes to the sky, above and below. The stars are different. The world below is changed, she knows that, and there are many more unbelievers than she can count. Their skies are greyer and their planet is warmer and their wars are waged in a different type of ship. She wonders if she will recognise her people, after all this time. She can pick out the Aegean if she looks hard enough. She can see Rome, risen and fallen since she last looked that way, and Egypt torn down the middle. She sees Persia and China, little lights shining like pins against the black night. To the west she sees a new land that she does not yet have a name for. She has missed much, it seems. She has slumbered for many thousands of years, and there is work to be done.",

      "She knew he spoke the truth.",
      "She could not free him; the chains were as much a part of him as his bones now.",
      "Some things were beyond her mortal means, but not all things.",
      "Let them see what human hands alone could do.",
      "Callisto glinted from her seat high above the Earth.",
      "Ageless and endless, she thought of Zeus and Hera often, of how they managed to spurn her even now, aeons into the cosmos.",
      "She remembered the burn of trickery as Zeus's plan took shape around her, even as she felt the tug of his offspring growing within her.",
      "The aching in her soul as she came to the realisation that she could not fight back, not against this.",
      "She remembered the chapped skin of her bear paws, the huff and the spit as she padded through the forest.",
      "Most of all she remembered the indignation.",
      "It was the reason the Earth turned and she turned with it, hoping against hope to glimpse Arcas on the other side.",
      "Semele liked the feel of asphodel between her toes.",
      "It was a small reminder of the flora of the world above, and though it was a poor imitation she could shut her eyes and pretend.",
      "It was close enough.",
      "She was the only mortal, in either world, to know the touch of a true god.",
      "Her life had been a fair price to pay for that, she wagered, for what was life in comparison to swaying the hand of the greatest god of all?",
      "She had asked to witness Zeus's true form, and he had obliged.",
      "She thought of the son she had lost.",
      "Dionysus would return her to the land of the living, of that she was certain.",
      "After all, he would inherit her determination, her skilful ideas, her gall.",
      "Even Zeus could not deny that.",
      "The touch of an immortal ached like an infection, raw beneath her skin; it burned like the amniotic pull that she felt whenever she heard news of Dionysus up above.",
      "It hurt like pride, like love, like victory.",
      "A fair price to pay, indeed.",
      "Ariadne slept with the rope twined around her wrist.",
      "It was an old habit, hard to break even when she was far, far away from the labyrinth.",
      "Dionysus might call her silly, but he had stranger habits and this rope had saved her life many times over.",
      "Even in the Underworld, she had hated to be lost.",
      "Daedalus had given it to her when she was but a child.",
      "He handed it to her as though it were a secret, one that she was too young to fully understand.",
      "She asked him what had become of her brother, and what would become of Icarus.",
      "She asked him because he seemed to have the answers to all secrets, and no one else would answer her questions.",
      "\"Take this,\" he said in reply, \"You will need it.\"",
      "\"It's just a rope,\" she had said, confused, but Daedalus shook his head.",
      "\"It is never just a rope, Ariadne.",
      "This is your way out.",
      "The gods have carved a path for us all - even you, child - but that does not mean we have to stick to it.",
      "You will never lose your way if you mark your journey with this rope.\"",
      "She was unsure, but she took it anyway because it was pretty and because she trusted Daedalus.",
      "She didn't know what he meant until many years later.",
      "As an adult and an immortal, she knew the importance of having a way out.",
      "Euridice's path was laid before her, one foot after the other, as she followed her husband into the light of the living land.",
      "He would not look at her.",
      "It would drive her mad before too long.",
      "\"Orpheus, why?\"",
      "She asked, not for the first time.",
      "She had been warned not to ask questions, but it only lit her curiosity on fire.",
      "It was her nature.",
      "\"This is the only way,\" was his reply.",
      "She could only see the back of his head, and it worried her.",
      "He tugged on her hand, urging her on.",
      "She stopped walking.",
      "\"And what is that supposed to mean?\"",
      "\"It is the will of the gods.",
      "Hades and his Queen decreed it so, and look - we are almost there.",
      "Come quickly, and this will be over.\"",
      "He was right, they were almost there, and Euridice could see daylight, feel the welcome breeze against her skin.",
      "The Underworld was dire; she did not know how Persephone could stand it, could not understand why the woman would choose to return there time after time.",
      "She thought of her husband, who had had many adventures the likes of which she could not imagine.",
      "He had charmed Sirens once, and had travelled the depths of the Underworld simply in search of her.",
      "He was a hero, of that she was sure.",
      "Euridice let go of his hand.",
      "She did not want to follow his footsteps any longer.",
      "Cassandra stumbled in Apollo's temple, snakes around her ankles.",
      "They licked at her ears, whispered impossible things.",
      "Things that had not yet come to pass.",
      "She called for Apollo as the snakes moved to her eyes, and she saw fire and dust, purple riches and scarlet blood, and she saw things she did not have names for: monsters in the sky, explosions, godless men and women in cities of metal.",
      "She called for Apollo.",
      "He did not listen.",
      "Years later, she sat with Polyxena on the turrets, watching the sun dip low in the reddened sky.",
      "She held up her thumb and traced Apollo's descent with one eye closed and she felt, as surely as she felt her sister beside her, that this would be Troy's last sunset.",
      "Polyxena stopped toying with the beads on her dress, and cocked her head at her sister.",
      "\"What is wrong?\" Cassandra remembered the time she saw Polyxena's death.",
      "It is little balm to know that her sister will die a hero.",
      "Cassandra pointed with her thumb.",
      "She was never sure of the right words.",
      "\"Beware of Greeks bearing gifts.\"",
      "Polyxena, who had heard this phrase since before she could remember, shook her head sadly.",
      "\"Silly girl.\"",
      "Helen had no time for hesitation.",
      "As a child she had danced a pretty dance, and Theseus had stolen her away.",
      "She had been rescued by her brothers then, her cosmic and dauntless brothers.",
      "Afterwards, she vowed to be no one's captive trophy, no one's weakling to be rescued.",
      "She grew up strong, and beautiful.",
      "She had no time for hesitation.",
      "After Paris shot down the greatest mortal warrior, aided by Apollo himself, Helen turned away from him and found her husband in the madness.",
      "He welcomed her back to his bed, eagerly, for why else had he come to this forsaken city if not to reclaim her?",
      "Long after he fell asleep, Helen smiled beside him, her face against his warm shoulder.",
      "Let the men have their battles, she thought, let the gods move them like pieces in a game.",
      "Leave the true choices to the women, she thought, for we have no time for hesitation.",
      "Iphigenia's dress was more than a little burned, but the ground on which she sat was blissfully cool.",
      "She had yet to take a look around, her eyes were still jammed shut from the panic of the sacrifice, but she heard waves, smelt tangy salt in the air.",
      "An island maybe, or perhaps she truly had died and was only hearing the Styx.",
      "She felt rough hands in her hair, on her temples, tracing the curves of her ears.",
      "If this was death, she had better open her eyes.",
      "Death was a woman, older than Iphigenia and perhaps as old as her mother.",
      "She had hair that seemed mostly to be made of woven forestry, she had a dress of old leather and meshed fabric, and her eyes were brown like a fox's tail.",
      "Iphigenia gasped.",
      "Death was beautiful.",
      "The woman laughed, and tapped her forehead gently.",
      "\"I am not Death, child.",
      "But you are young, and I must appear strange to you.",
      "I do not believe you have ever seen me like this.\"",
      "\"I am not dead?\" \"No.",
      "You are safe.",
      "And you know me, child, as I know you.\"",
      "Iphigenia frowned, but the woman stroking her hair twitched a little and Iphigenia saw the bow sling across her shoulders, the glinting of arrowheads inlaid into her necklace.",
      "Iphigenia cried, and lowered her head.",
      "\"Artemis!",
      "My Queen!",
      "You saved me; I called to you and you came!\"",
      "Artemis took her hand, and it was the grip of ages, the grip of protector and of the victorious.",
      "She pulled the young girl to her feet.",
      "\"My lady - are we going somewhere?\"",
      "It is late when Athena arises.",
      "The mountain is still cloaked in sleep and she is not surprised that she is the first to stir, for what good is a Pantheon without Wisdom?",
      "She does not wake the others, not yet, and instead she turns her eyes to the sky, above and below.",
      "The stars are different.",
      "The world below is changed, she knows that, and there are many more unbelievers than she can count.",
      "Their skies are greyer and their planet is warmer and their wars are waged in a different type of ship.",
      "She wonders if she will recognise her people, after all this time.",
      "She can pick out the Aegean if she looks hard enough.",
      "She can see Rome, risen and fallen since she last looked that way, and Egypt torn down the middle.",
      "She sees Persia and China, little lights shining like pins against the black night.",
      "To the west she sees a new land that she does not yet have a name for.",
      "She has missed much, it seems.",
      "She has slumbered for many thousands of years, and there is work to be done."

And yet - and yet - exactly I foresee all that shall come to pass; no sharp surprise of pain shall overtake me; what's determined bear, as I can, I must, knowing the might of strong necessity is unconquerable. -Aeschylus, Prometheus Bound Twelve thousand, three hundred and eighty-two. He shifts his wrists beneath the chains, moves them slowly, gently, in motions practiced and perfected, testing strength here and friction there, each sun-heated link caressing his skin like a burning coal. No weaknesses found, he stills, sighs, begins again with his legs instead, motions all measured out in scant hairs; the one who bound him did his job well. Three thousand, two hundred and seventy-one. The sun slants across him, forcing him to squint against the glare. He sighs again, but continues the endless testing of his bonds. When the eagle rips out his liver, he groans once and that is all. It will return; no use in making more of a fuss. Nine hundred and twenty. Snow. He shivers beneath it, briefly glad for a change from the fire-like heat. The chains bite at him like ice as he pulls against them. Three hundred and forty-nine. It would be so very easy to lie there motionless, chained to the mountain, liver ever raw and bleeding, face turned toward heaven, and to despair. So very easy to simply stop. He could tell himself that it is wisest, even: to guard his strength. To save his dignity. To retreat inside himself, into a prison from which he could never be freed. Zeus would like that, he thinks. But instead he shifts his weight against the rock at his back, the chains at his front, the weariness at his heart, and does not give in. Someday the chains will come off, and when that happens he will stand again, secure in the knowledge that he did not give in or give up. And then-- Then, perhaps, he will rest. One.",

    "text": "John woke up with his head full of confusing thoughts. By noon, most of them had been replaced with a new one: nothing had changed, really. Sherlock was a Greek god, yes. That was still insane. But Sherlock had never been exactly conventional, so in a sense this was just Sherlock being abnormal in yet another way. John could adjust to that. Honestly. Gods being real and alive, that's crazy. Sherlock being one of them, that's almost expected. But waking up in Sherlock's bed, now that was unexpected. That did change some things. Or, rather, it should have changed things. In reality, John woke up alone, just like any other morning, went to the bathroom, did what he did any other day, and made breakfast for two while Sherlock worked on an experiment involving old shoe soles, acetic acid and a rubber ball. It honestly felt as if nothing had changed. At least it did until the doorbell rang, and Sherlock left his experiment to open the door. When he came back upstairs, it was with Molly in tow. She looked rather self-conscious, but then again, she usually did when Sherlock was nearby. \"I asked Molly to come,\" Sherlock said rather formally while taking her coat - which was kind of weird, John thought. Since when was Sherlock this gallant? \"As she is one of the few people who know about this.\" \"You knew?\" John blurted out, looking at Molly as if seeing her for the very first time. \"Since when?\" \"Knew what?\" Molly answered bewildered. \"About - about Sherlock being a bloody god!\" \"Oh, that,\" she said, just as if he were talking about something ordinary and boring like the sad, rainy weather, or a traffic jam, or maybe the corpse of an old, wrinkly woman dying of natural causes. \"I guess I realized the first time I met him.\" John was concentrating very hard not to be gaping. \"But how?\" \"Hardly a difficult deduction to make,\" murmured Sherlock. \"Not helping,\" John said, glaring at him. \"Molly?\" Molly shrugged. \"Well, he does look like a Greek god, doesn't he? You know, with the hair, and the cheekbones, and everything.\" Sherlock appeared to be sniggering. \"So you just looked at him, and thought wow, he looks like Ares?\" John asked, wondering if Molly was either the Oracle of Delphi, a genius or insane. Or maybe he needed to consider the possibility that he was even more insane that he already knew he was. He had moved in with Sherlock voluntarily, after all. Which was hardly a sane decision, even without knowing about the Greek god-thing. \"Oh, no, his looks merely told me that he was a Greek god. I thought he might be Apollo at first - no offence, Sherlock.\" \"None taken,\" Sherlock answered, glancing at his violin. \"But it became obvious pretty soon that his interests didn't fit Apollo. The god of light, music and poetry would probably not spend quite that much time in a morgue. Death and violence are more Ares's style, you know?\" \"Yes,\" John said slowly. \"I can see that. And is this - him being a Greek god and all - is that why you - er - why you like him so much?\" \"Oh, no. Or - maybe.\" Molly blushed. \"It certainly doesn't hurt, though, does it?\" Given how Sherlock had quite successfully seduced him less than an hour after he first found out, John couldn't honestly find it in himself to argue her point, even though something inside him really, really wanted to. \"I suppose not.\" \"And Ares does have that bad boy-thing going for him that Apollo is sadly lacking.\" John chose not to comment on that. \"But it's not like I'm worshipping him or anything. I don't really think he would like that. Would you, Sherlock?\" \"Not at all,\" Sherlock said, obviously amused by the conversation, and Molly beamed at him. \"To be frank with you, I merely like to have something pretty to look at. Not much of that in the morgue. I've found that dead people are mostly ugly. Especially when they're smashed up and bloody. Or partially decomposed. Not exactly pretty, if you know what I mean.\" John knew exactly what she meant, but didn't really want to dwell too much upon what that might say about him. \"So obviously, I like having Sherlock around in the morgue,\" Molly concluded. \"He is - well - he's eye candy. Way sexier than most of the bodies I'm working with.\" She leaned conspiratorially towards John, and whispered just loud enough that John was sure Sherlock could hear every single syllable. \"And isn't it kind of funny that Ares has such a lovely arse?\"",

    "text": "h.h.holmes \"Shhhhhhhhht\" Followed By a Scream. The line moved. I breathed fire back on to the brander. Red hot, onto the shoulder of the next poor soul. \"SSShhhhhhht\" This one didn't scream. The souls behind him looked impressed. I left it on longer than needed. Again the line moved. Again the thought that human reproduce like rabbits hit my mind. Then they die. Then they come to me to be branded as the devils property. Next soul in line was a trembler. \"Relax. It hurts, but if i mess up then i have to do it again.\"The soul looked up at me; i was fighting a smile. i loved my job. i just hated being trapped here.This boy just could not stop shaking; so i sent him to the end of the line to relax.I heated up the brander with my breath again. \"NEXT.\" I yelledUp came another soul. As it got closer I could make out the girls body and clothes. Short skirt; low cut shirt and her high heels matched that shirt. The color Red. The only thing that wasn't hot was the gunshot wound in her forehead along with the bruises on her wrists in the shape of hands. Big hands. \"When I was alive I was close to being rich, how does someone get rich down here?\" she said \"You don't everything goes to the devil.\" I said.\"Is that right.\" she said.\"SHHHHHHHHHHHT\" I branded her. I felt sorry to cause further damage to her body.\"Will these ever go away?\" she said pointing at her wrists\"When you forgive him.\" I said \"and if you can you can go to heaven.\"\"Whys the devil so rich anyways?\" said an old man. He looked like a miner. He was dusty and his head looked kind of funny; too long and not wide enough.He turned his head to look at the lady. 'who I still had a hold of.' When he turned I saw that his head had been smashed and cracked open.Letting go of the girl's arm, I said. \"He feeds us and does his best to get us out of here.\" \"If he gave us money we wouldn't learn to be kind... We would just fight over it...And, what would you need money for anyways you're dead.\"The line moved. I grabbed the souls arm.\"What about you;\" he said \"Don't you get money for branding us?\"I blow fire on the brand again.\"No, but he gives me presents.\"\"Presents?\" he said\"Yeah like just yesterday he gave me a bird egg.\"\"Really?\" he said \"Why would he give you something that would die?\"\"We'll put it back in a year or two... Its just a pet.\"\"What about a dog? Could we have dogs?\"\"If we work hard enough... Maybe I'll try talking him into getting me one.\"I fixed it to be hotter than usual and then put it on\"SSSSSHHHhhhhhhht\"the soul trembling walk awayAbout twenty souls later the boy came back to the front.\"Sorry about being a bother\" he said.\"That's alright, hey why don't you stay here with me for the rest of my shift?\"\"Can I brand someone?\"\"Would you want to?\"\"Not sure\"I made the brand hot again and handed it to him.He held it like a weapon. \"You can't hold it like that. Its not a sword its a brander like for cows.\"\"NEXT\" I yelledThe boy moved it so it looked like he was holding a stamp.\"That's better\"A soul came up. It was a man in his twenties.\"Ok now just press it on his shoulder.\"\"SSSSHHHHhhhht\"After branding him, I gave the boy my card and he told me he should be going. That he had to go look for his Aunt Koria. A mind-numbing amount of souls later my shift was over. I'm pretty sure I worked for a whole day.Walking the streets of hell is life threatening. Funny life threatening. when I was alive I was a serial killer; by the name of Herman Mudgett. i was born may 16, 1861 and died may 7, 1896. When i can down here i changed my names to h. h. holmes. Lava in the ditches. Every thing from stage coaches to cars, driving as fast as they can. At lest you can't get mugged. No one has money here but the devil and he was it locked up save and sound. Somewhere. I wonder what year it is now. guess I should have asked that boy. I did give him my card so maybe he will find me so I can help him get a job.I take the last left turn and i can see my house down the road. Someone is sitting on my steps and that weird feeling comes back. When I get to my house I find out that it is that boy the one from my shift.\"Guess this is my chance..\" i paused \"Hey what year is it?\"\"2010\" He saidI blinded two hundred years?\"Anyways I wanted to talk to you about getting a job?\"\"Right basically you just have to say it out loud so the devil can hear it.\"\"what?\"\"just pulling your chain.\" I said \"we can have cellphones down here too. So I can just call the devil and you'll start tomorrow.\"I said\"cool\"a call to Satan and I would be seeing this boy everyday for the rest of my existence.great.\"all set\" I said\"thanks.\"his only been here a day what if he doesn't have a place to stay.\"got a home?\"\"nope\"\"I'd offer you to stay but well I killed over 50 people who lived in my house.\" i smiled as I remembered the fun i had.I had killed over 50 people, I have killed about 15 to get the money to start my hotel of death. Then got lost in all the blood and guts. Truthfully I don't know how many i killed i think somewhere between 150 to 200.Then the house was finished it had pipes going to every room so I could poison anyone, anywhere. Along with a basement where I could play doctor. \"Really? that's... something.\" he said slowly. \"I guess I don't care its not like you can kill me now?\"He had said it like a question; making me laugh.I turned walked up the steps and opened the door for him.I turned to the right and went in to the kitchen.\"Want some thing to drank?\"\"Can you make tea?\" I put the water on the stove and went back to the living room.He is looking at my one and only picture of my hotel of death.\"What's your name?\" I asked and of course he jumps because I'm right behind him.\"James\"\"That there's the hotel I build.\"\"Oh\"\"how'd ya die?\"\"pills\"\"Didn't really escape did ya?\" He didn't answer. he had turned around to look at me.

    "text": "Her limbs were weak as she had set off down the road, turned her mind resolutely away from the charred corpse that was her father, now no more than withered flesh, consumed by flames as though he'd been long dead by the time the lightning was buried through his heart. He had not been her father in too long, not in this new world that they'd set foot in where he'd grown pettish and aggrieved by every small thing that failed to bend itself to his command as so few things now did. She grieved for him of course, but for what he had been, not what he had become in this land of electricity, blue slushies and godless people who brushed against her in the street and did not flinch, who did not know what she had been. In the days that come there is only the past to sustain her. She remembered still, chasing down a deer on foot, fleeter than any woodland animal, her bow on her back, face smeared green and dappled like the trees around her, her maidens at her heels, yapping as though they pursued her, and the delicate pool of the spilling life blood, gift given and taken, one that she appreciated. She remembered jointing it neatly, dividing it amongst the rest as they chattered and slept and made merry, while she took the hero's portion (another merry game on her part at first at least) and roasted it upon the fire, folded it in damp dew-spattered leaves and leaving the rest behind conveyed it to Prometheus. It was not yet high morning, he was awake and conscious, whole once more- if he ate now, it would be hours before once again the vulture pecked enough to expose it once more, and when he saw her coming, from many leagues away (for his eyes saw far) he laughed as though the warmth of the morning and the sight of her were enough to extinguish the gnawing pain that devoured his vitals from day to day. He ate it from her fingers, did not touch her in the least as though he all of his fellow beings who wore the face of man and the body of gods, understood the discourtesy he would be offering her if he did so. At other times perhaps he would perhaps fear death, but when death was faced every day, there are others who in his place would have grown bold and sought to caress her with words and smiles and puling pleas to beg for her help. He had done none of those things however, had treated her as he would any other of the mild diversions with which he was sometimes blessed- the sea nymphs that occasionally swam close and near and looked up with eyes of wonder, even Ocean himself she had seen approach, and he always bade her go before the vultures returned. \"I have seen death,\" she told him that first time in blank surprise, that he should be so unwitting of what she was. \"That I do not doubt,\" he had replied, \"but you are a hunter, and they are carrion-birds, it is not fitting that you should see them work at their prey,\" and that at least she understood, did not wish to see the inevitable crumbling and dissolution of his flesh, no clean kill, given too early to the eaters of the dead. She turned and he held his tongue until she was gone, and yet still his agony echoed through the woods. The next day she did not venture close, betook herself and her maidens to the deepest part of the woods, where the boar might be found, and sporting games be indulged in without the fear of impudent eyes attempting to see what should be hidden. There was a lake there, still and silent, where golden flowers cluster by the side and the wind whispers echoes of long past sorrow, and it is livened only for so long as the shouts and merriment remain loud. When Artemis scooped the water from the surface, as though the image is conveyed to her by some nymph, she saw Prometheus in his agony, hears once more the echo of his pain and let the water slip through her fingers as though she was disturbed. She had no reason to be so. Prometheus has been put to the torture Zeus has allotted him, the punishment of daring to raise mankind above their allotted station, and she had felt a new rush of sudden ire at what he has done, at how humanity had spread across the earth. Yet still she found herself back beside him, the sea wind whipping at her braided hair as they spoke of many things. Day after day they met in such a fashion for the time before he was once again consumed, until she charged him with his wickedness in so causing the humans to multiply in such a fashion, and he threw back his head and laughed, bringing the colour to her cheeks, reminding her once more how old he was, how uncommonly old though he looked hale and hearty enough after a fashion. \"Before your time,\" he said, \"you cannot expect to know better. Your father would have you believe he set the stars in the sky, created the earth and all that is in it, sculpted man from clay and breathed life into it, but this is not the truth. He is the ruler of these things and no good ruler lets his people starve and freeze. I would not abide it and for that I am punished.\" \"Yet you brought their arrogance to fruition,\" she reminded him and kept her eyes firmly fixed to the sea as the wings of some foul bird brush her face for she lingers too long already, \"your warmth and light has seen them spread across the land. Trees die in their wake and in their blind heedlessness they pay too little respect to us, the Gods.\" Silence falls for long moments before he replied. \"If they were not so numerous, if they were not so well provisioned, then you would soon learn to regret it. The respect you disdain as too little is more than once could have been scraped by Zeus itself. It is their prayers, their implorations that fire you, power you. Without them you are lost,\" and he fell silent at that. Artemis did not speak for a long time for the truth that he spoke had flooded her veins. She knew her worshippers, this beyond doubt, they were like a fine threaded web across the land, as though Athene's Arachne had spun them together with her at the centre. She could feel their whispered prayers, their imploring of her help and her pardon. Atalanta sent up quick thanks at the end of each race, the hunter gutting the boar at present was marking its flesh for her, the priests in the temples were wafting worship her way with smoke and chant, and it strengthened her obscurely- the blood pumped through her veins as they fill her with their fear and their worship. She had never thought it was required, never thought there was cause and effect between them, had assumed if she had assumed at all that it was the other way round- they worship her because of her strength, not that their worship gives her strength. The truth was chilling but it was long before she entirely understood. Now as she travelled her long weary way, journeyed away from the severing of those last ties to her kin, she understood all too well what it meant to her to be so denied the worship she needed. Her flesh was weak compared to the hard bodied magnificence she had once been the possessor of. The bow Odysseus had used his great strength to bend and string had been a child's toy in her hand, she had crushed all those who would have stood against her. That she is stronger than those around her still, she counted as no great boon, for what are they still but mortals? To be stronger than them, would be like being proud of being cleverer than a dog, she could not do it. The years stretched out before her, long and weary and slow with no hope of end except at her own hand for the secret of her own demise had been kept safe and close to her chest, and she did not think these mortals would know how she was constituted. She had grown to hate their food- the flesh of grazed cattle, killed where they stood, not taken in the hunt and she ceased to eat, ceased to walk amongst humans once more, betook herself to the mountains, to the forests where still wild things lurked and there was a space for her to seize and claim, a life that reminded her of something she had once known. She gave up on the thought of seeking out the few remnants of her kind scattered in all directions- the world had changed too much, when humans could in such a fashion dispose of her father in such a way, and she did not wish to see what has become of them, how they too have failed and fallen. But all things change. It began with a twinge on her consciousness, the soft quiet tug of a worshipper's prayer and her eyes flew open in surprise. They are not unknown even now, she had heard prayers addressed to her by teenagers who adopted her cult for some reason, by even the occasional believer who hewed true to the old ways, but there have never been genuine queries. Always they had rung with the consciousness that their requests were most likely being thrown into an echo chamber, heard by nothing and nowhere. Such half-hearted attempts did not deserve even the weak response that she could offer, and she ignored them. The request that made itself known on this occasion was nothing like those prayers however. It was hesitant still, but there was conviction behind it that something was listening, and when she traced it back along the source, she was struck dumb for long moments at the sight of the young woman who had closed her eyes for these few seconds and made an appeal for good hunting. In her hands was a ready loaded shotgun, on her back a leather jacket and she differed in all respects from the handmaidens who had run beside Artemis, in everything save her burning intent. If this had been the past, Artemis would have weighed her request, would have weighed the sacrifices that had been given in her honour before she deigned to influence fate in her favour. As it was she turned away for long seconds, would have ignored that first call had it not been for the sudden memory that blossomed within her. She could remember how the sea salt had dashed against her face as she stood by Prometheus's side and witnessed what punishment he had undertaken for the sake of humans, she had seen him broken after he was finally freed by Hercules, had left him lying in the woods, covered by the trees, soothed by the soft winds that he had lost for so long before ever she approached him again, gave him the peace he had lacked for so long. She remembered him faltering and falling once again for the sake of humanity, how he had looked at her at the last as though he had known her and believed. Then she gathered her small store of reserves and brushed feathery distant fingers over the gun, murmured a blessing and bid the young woman luck with her prey. Everything seemed a little brighter all of a sudden all was easier to bear. Somewhere, out there someone believed, and that small spark of a flame that one she would have disdained, once she would have crushed without a thought was all too precious for being so fragile and so alone. It warmed a part of her that had been too long cold. Nor was it the last. Still there were not many, but gradually others echoed across the wide expanse of her thoughts, asked her for help, for guidance, for luck in the chase, and moved as she had never been before by their plight she acceded to their requests, bent her hands and her skill to their cause. She ran light-footed alongside those who hunted prey stranger than that she had ever seen before, wilder by far and stronger too, unseen and yet a force and more than once she tended a wound that would otherwise have turned to poison. They were all women so far, and she read from their thoughts their disinclination to pray to what they knew and yet distrusted, and yet still a need for someone to listen. They knew she was there, the Winchesters must have spread the word a time or two, and that belief resonates once more. She turned those memories of sacrifice and blood and pain over in her mind again and again, seeking to understand in full what Prometheus had seen in this undignified and low race but though she can not yet fully understand she moves slowly towards it, towards an ideal he had died for. That in itself was love she supposed though not a love that the Winchesters would understand. Artemis had walked the earth long enough since her power faded, since belief fled away, that she spoke many languages, worked in many ways, and yet still there were concepts which baffled and bewildered her as much as any philosopher, which she did not think she would ever understand. When she spoke, she could not know what others heard. Couldn't be sure that that which means so much to her, has any meaning to those around her. Not anymore. When Sam Winchester told her that she loved, she had agreed unknowingly, for she did love. As she had loved dashing through the long grass, skimming through lush meadows in the search of the elusive prey, as she loved her brother still, shining and golden, half of her in himself, as she loved the way the sunlight hit the hair of her beloved maidens as though Apollo too had lent himself to the worship of beauty, so she had loved Prometheus. She had been of a mind to be insulted by their oversight, by their lack of knowledge, that they would believe she would so surrender herself to any man in any way, that vows of chastity held for centuries would crumble under so little provocation, that she who had blinded men for taking liberties, had had them torn apart by their dearest kin for daring to take her name in vain- daring to speak jestingly of what they wished from her would chastise Prometheus for taking another love. She had resented him in that first long weary hatred of humankind and of her weakening, for what he had done, for daring to leave them once more, to forge himself a new life, for going back to the arms of the mortals who he had always loved first and best, and hope had blinded her to the truth. Artemis is not formed as humans are, but she understands enough now that they have but one word for something which comes in so many forms- like a jewel with a thousand faces. They could not understand that what she had meant was different from what they had implied and it was all over and past now. She held on tight anyway to what he had been, wrapped the assurance around herself that Prometheus had died for what he had always believed in, humans in their multitudes of forms. She has buried many before, buried kith and kin that had not endured as she had, had not fought hard enough or long enough, had faltered as she thought her kind never could. Now she is alone but not lonely, and before her a world stretches out. Prometheus had first kindled fire for the earth and then sacrificed himself for those around him, and while she did not as yet share his sanguine expectations regarding humans still she could honour his memory by letting the spark he had lit in her endure. The tender souls that stretched out into the dark in search of her would not seek in vain. The remnants of the old world fell away from her, and her bow leapt to her hand as she stepped forward into the unknown.",

      "She remembered still, chasing down a deer on foot, fleeter than any woodland animal, her bow on her back, face smeared green and dappled like the trees around her, her maidens at her heels, yapping as though they pursued her, and the delicate pool of the spilling life blood, gift given and taken, one that she appreciated.",
      "She remembered jointing it neatly, dividing it amongst the rest as they chattered and slept and made merry, while she took the hero's portion (another merry game on her part at first at least) and roasted it upon the fire, folded it in damp dew-spattered leaves and leaving the rest behind conveyed it to Prometheus.",
      "It was not yet high morning, he was awake and conscious, whole once more- if he ate now, it would be hours before once again the vulture pecked enough to expose it once more, and when he saw her coming, from many leagues away (for his eyes saw far) he laughed as though the warmth of the morning and the sight of her were enough to extinguish the gnawing pain that devoured his vitals from day to day.",
      "He ate it from her fingers, did not touch her in the least as though he all of his fellow beings who wore the face of man and the body of gods, understood the discourtesy he would be offering her if he did so.",
      "At other times perhaps he would perhaps fear death, but when death was faced every day, there are others who in his place would have grown bold and sought to caress her with words and smiles and puling pleas to beg for her help.",
      "He had done none of those things however, had treated her as he would any other of the mild diversions with which he was sometimes blessed- the sea nymphs that occasionally swam close and near and looked up with eyes of wonder, even Ocean himself she had seen approach, and he always bade her go before the vultures returned.",
      "\"I have seen death,\" she told him that first time in blank surprise, that he should be so unwitting of what she was.",
      "\"That I do not doubt,\" he had replied, \"but you are a hunter, and they are carrion-birds, it is not fitting that you should see them work at their prey,\" and that at least she understood, did not wish to see the inevitable crumbling and dissolution of his flesh, no clean kill, given too early to the eaters of the dead.",
      "She turned and he held his tongue until she was gone, and yet still his agony echoed through the woods.",
      "The next day she did not venture close, betook herself and her maidens to the deepest part of the woods, where the boar might be found, and sporting games be indulged in without the fear of impudent eyes attempting to see what should be hidden.",
      "There was a lake there, still and silent, where golden flowers cluster by the side and the wind whispers echoes of long past sorrow, and it is livened only for so long as the shouts and merriment remain loud.",
      "When Artemis scooped the water from the surface, as though the image is conveyed to her by some nymph, she saw Prometheus in his agony, hears once more the echo of his pain and let the water slip through her fingers as though she was disturbed.",
      "She had no reason to be so.",
      "Prometheus has been put to the torture Zeus has allotted him, the punishment of daring to raise mankind above their allotted station, and she had felt a new rush of sudden ire at what he has done, at how humanity had spread across the earth.",
      "Yet still she found herself back beside him, the sea wind whipping at her braided hair as they spoke of many things.",
      "Day after day they met in such a fashion for the time before he was once again consumed, until she charged him with his wickedness in so causing the humans to multiply in such a fashion, and he threw back his head and laughed, bringing the colour to her cheeks, reminding her once more how old he was, how uncommonly old though he looked hale and hearty enough after a fashion.",
      "\"Before your time,\" he said, \"you cannot expect to know better.",
      "Your father would have you believe he set the stars in the sky, created the earth and all that is in it, sculpted man from clay and breathed life into it, but this is not the truth.",
      "He is the ruler of these things and no good ruler lets his people starve and freeze.",
      "I would not abide it and for that I am punished.\"",
      "\"Yet you brought their arrogance to fruition,\" she reminded him and kept her eyes firmly fixed to the sea as the wings of some foul bird brush her face for she lingers too long already, \"your warmth and light has seen them spread across the land.",
      "Trees die in their wake and in their blind heedlessness they pay too little respect to us, the Gods.\"",
      "Silence falls for long moments before he replied.",
      "\"If they were not so numerous, if they were not so well provisioned, then you would soon learn to regret it.",
      "The respect you disdain as too little is more than once could have been scraped by Zeus itself.",
      "It is their prayers, their implorations that fire you, power you.",
      "Without them you are lost,\" and he fell silent at that.",
      "Artemis did not speak for a long time for the truth that he spoke had flooded her veins.",
      "She knew her worshippers, this beyond doubt, they were like a fine threaded web across the land, as though Athene's Arachne had spun them together with her at the centre.",
      "She could feel their whispered prayers, their imploring of her help and her pardon.",
      "Atalanta sent up quick thanks at the end of each race, the hunter gutting the boar at present was marking its flesh for her, the priests in the temples were wafting worship her way with smoke and chant, and it strengthened her obscurely- the blood pumped through her veins as they fill her with their fear and their worship.",
      "She had never thought it was required, never thought there was cause and effect between them, had assumed if she had assumed at all that it was the other way round- they worship her because of her strength, not that their worship gives her strength.",
      "The truth was chilling but it was long before she entirely understood.",
      "Now as she travelled her long weary way, journeyed away from the severing of those last ties to her kin, she understood all too well what it meant to her to be so denied the worship she needed.",
      "Her flesh was weak compared to the hard bodied magnificence she had once been the possessor of.",
      "The bow Odysseus had used his great strength to bend and string had been a child's toy in her hand, she had crushed all those who would have stood against her.",
      "That she is stronger than those around her still, she counted as no great boon, for what are they still but mortals?",
      "To be stronger than them, would be like being proud of being cleverer than a dog, she could not do it.",
      "The years stretched out before her, long and weary and slow with no hope of end except at her own hand for the secret of her own demise had been kept safe and close to her chest, and she did not think these mortals would know how she was constituted.",
      "She had grown to hate their food- the flesh of grazed cattle, killed where they stood, not taken in the hunt and she ceased to eat, ceased to walk amongst humans once more, betook herself to the mountains, to the forests where still wild things lurked and there was a space for her to seize and claim, a life that reminded her of something she had once known.",
      "She gave up on the thought of seeking out the few remnants of her kind scattered in all directions- the world had changed too much, when humans could in such a fashion dispose of her father in such a way, and she did not wish to see what has become of them, how they too have failed and fallen.",
      "But all things change.",
      "It began with a twinge on her consciousness, the soft quiet tug of a worshipper's prayer and her eyes flew open in surprise.",
      "They are not unknown even now, she had heard prayers addressed to her by teenagers who adopted her cult for some reason, by even the occasional believer who hewed true to the old ways, but there have never been genuine queries.",
      "Always they had rung with the consciousness that their requests were most likely being thrown into an echo chamber, heard by nothing and nowhere.",
      "Such half-hearted attempts did not deserve even the weak response that she could offer, and she ignored them.",
      "The request that made itself known on this occasion was nothing like those prayers however.",
      "It was hesitant still, but there was conviction behind it that something was listening, and when she traced it back along the source, she was struck dumb for long moments at the sight of the young woman who had closed her eyes for these few seconds and made an appeal for good hunting.",
      "In her hands was a ready loaded shotgun, on her back a leather jacket and she differed in all respects from the handmaidens who had run beside Artemis, in everything save her burning intent.",
      "If this had been the past, Artemis would have weighed her request, would have weighed the sacrifices that had been given in her honour before she deigned to influence fate in her favour.",
      "As it was she turned away for long seconds, would have ignored that first call had it not been for the sudden memory that blossomed within her.",
      "She could remember how the sea salt had dashed against her face as she stood by Prometheus's side and witnessed what punishment he had undertaken for the sake of humans, she had seen him broken after he was finally freed by Hercules, had left him lying in the woods, covered by the trees, soothed by the soft winds that he had lost for so long before ever she approached him again, gave him the peace he had lacked for so long.",
      "She remembered him faltering and falling once again for the sake of humanity, how he had looked at her at the last as though he had known her and believed.",
      "Then she gathered her small store of reserves and brushed feathery distant fingers over the gun, murmured a blessing and bid the young woman luck with her prey.",
      "Everything seemed a little brighter all of a sudden all was easier to bear.",
      "Somewhere, out there someone believed, and that small spark of a flame that one she would have disdained, once she would have crushed without a thought was all too precious for being so fragile and so alone.",
      "It warmed a part of her that had been too long cold.",
      "Nor was it the last.",
      "Still there were not many, but gradually others echoed across the wide expanse of her thoughts, asked her for help, for guidance, for luck in the chase, and moved as she had never been before by their plight she acceded to their requests, bent her hands and her skill to their cause.",
      "She ran light-footed alongside those who hunted prey stranger than that she had ever seen before, wilder by far and stronger too, unseen and yet a force and more than once she tended a wound that would otherwise have turned to poison.",
      "They were all women so far, and she read from their thoughts their disinclination to pray to what they knew and yet distrusted, and yet still a need for someone to listen.",
      "They knew she was there, the Winchesters must have spread the word a time or two, and that belief resonates once more.",
      "She turned those memories of sacrifice and blood and pain over in her mind again and again, seeking to understand in full what Prometheus had seen in this undignified and low race but though she can not yet fully understand she moves slowly towards it, towards an ideal he had died for.",
      "That in itself was love she supposed though not a love that the Winchesters would understand.",
      "Artemis had walked the earth long enough since her power faded, since belief fled away, that she spoke many languages, worked in many ways, and yet still there were concepts which baffled and bewildered her as much as any philosopher, which she did not think she would ever understand.",
      "When she spoke, she could not know what others heard.",
      "Couldn't be sure that that which means so much to her, has any meaning to those around her.",
      "Not anymore.",
      "When Sam Winchester told her that she loved, she had agreed unknowingly, for she did love.",
      "As she had loved dashing through the long grass, skimming through lush meadows in the search of the elusive prey, as she loved her brother still, shining and golden, half of her in himself, as she loved the way the sunlight hit the hair of her beloved maidens as though Apollo too had lent himself to the worship of beauty, so she had loved Prometheus.",
      "She had been of a mind to be insulted by their oversight, by their lack of knowledge, that they would believe she would so surrender herself to any man in any way, that vows of chastity held for centuries would crumble under so little provocation, that she who had blinded men for taking liberties, had had them torn apart by their dearest kin for daring to take her name in vain- daring to speak jestingly of what they wished from her would chastise Prometheus for taking another love.",
      "She had resented him in that first long weary hatred of humankind and of her weakening, for what he had done, for daring to leave them once more, to forge himself a new life, for going back to the arms of the mortals who he had always loved first and best, and hope had blinded her to the truth.",
      "Artemis is not formed as humans are, but she understands enough now that they have but one word for something which comes in so many forms- like a jewel with a thousand faces.",
      "They could not understand that what she had meant was different from what they had implied and it was all over and past now.",
      "She held on tight anyway to what he had been, wrapped the assurance around herself that Prometheus had died for what he had always believed in, humans in their multitudes of forms.",
      "She has buried many before, buried kith and kin that had not endured as she had, had not fought hard enough or long enough, had faltered as she thought her kind never could.",
      "Now she is alone but not lonely, and before her a world stretches out.",
      "Prometheus had first kindled fire for the earth and then sacrificed himself for those around him, and while she did not as yet share his sanguine expectations regarding humans still she could honour his memory by letting the spark he had lit in her endure.",
      "The tender souls that stretched out into the dark in search of her would not seek in vain.",
      "The remnants of the old world fell away from her, and her bow leapt to her hand as she stepped forward into the unknown."
