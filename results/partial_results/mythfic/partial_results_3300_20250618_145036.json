Eris was the goddess of discord, meaning she absolutely loved chaos on would often spark feuds just for fun. Well, one day, Eris got extremely bored. She was just itching to cause someone turmoil. Being clever and sneaky, she enlisted the help of her friends. After all, why should a goddess have to do all the work herself? These friends of Eris' were lizards. Small and nimble, they were the perfect little buggers for causing chaos. In fact, at the time, these tiny lizards were Eris's sacred animal. She absolutely adored them. Eris's plan was simple: Have these nimble little lizard friends steal something from Zeus and watch as he goes into a complete rage. If chaos were to be sparked anywhere, it might as well be on Olympus. Eris, however, didn't want war, she just wanted to steal something trivial from the king of the gods to see how little it would take for him to go ballistic. With those thoughts in mind, she sent her lizard friends out to work. Meanwhile on Olympus, Zeus just received a wonderful gift from Dionysus: a basket of grapes fit for the king of the gods. Just as Zeus was about to enjoy his wonderful gift, he saw tiny lizard creatures escaping the throne room with one of his grapes! He became so angry that these pests would dare steal from him! He took away their arms and legs. Now, they would be unable to steal anything ever again. Zeus was proud of how well he felt with the issue. He promptly sat down on his throne and ate one of his grapes. Zeus's expression immediately became one of disgust. The grapes Dionysus gave to Zeus were made of wax! Through some mystical, unknown powers, Hera learned of Zeus's punishment upon the poor lizard beasts in their stupid attempt to steal from him. She nagged Zeus endlessly until he agreed to fix his mistakes. Zeus, being the loving husband and lazy jerk he is, only gave half the lizards their arms and legs back. That is why snakes have no arms and lizards still exist. Eris, however, was not angry with Zeus's punishment upon her lizard friends. In fact, she was amused. She found these new snake creatures much more terrifying and chaotic than her tiny lizards. She liked them so much, the snake became her new sacred animal and a symbol of chaos. And Dionysus got zero punishment for his grapes made of wax because Zeus is stupid and forgot about it.",

Steal me, like a thief steals jewels,I want you more than you know,We are but a couple of fools.

Many years later, I am back for you my child.The dear lady Persephone has become ill with her word.He is mine, you withering flower!Give him to me or you will have a new enemy!

Zeus has stopped this fighting.I hate her still, all the more.My dear little boy how you've grow.Was the Underworld dark and cold? I can't stand it, being away from you so long!Six months each year I must wait through the winter alone.But when you come back to me, you will see me always.I truly love you, little hunter. Together we are once again.I feel like I have just come back to life.I am joyous you still remember me!Please tell me, was that mistress Persephone cruel? Hunting together at last.I've waiting so long for our time with each other.Please, do not think me ill.But Persephone is a thief at her best. My hunter, my dear boy.Today I shall watch from afar.Go hunting all you wish without me.I am here if you need me ever. Oh! What have I done?A great mistake I have made!To leave you alone, what a fool.I cannot bare to see you die! That wild boar, sent by Ares, no doubt.I am sorry for what I have put you through.He was jealous of you, now I see.But please, you cannot leave. Now to the Underworld you go.With your mistress Persephone alone.I am sorry I could not save you.I truly did try, you know. Persephone has won, I will seek my revenge.She can see you whenever she wants.That queen shall fall so far in love.Then get rejected by the man of which she dreams.

    "text": "Dionysus was drunk. He was always drunk, inebriated by the drink he gifted the mortals; he was supposed to be, for he was the god of wine and celebrations, and if he were sober it wouldn't have been right. But right then his shoulders were slumped and his head hung low, with his eyes almost glowing madly from the depths of his shadow. The god who had never once been Hedone trembled. He must have been sent to force me back into my role, he thought as the figure stumbled into the room. He most have come to make me eat my words. He tried to stand his ground, no matter how futile it would have been. Dionysus was much stronger than he was, and would have taken what he wanted without asking. He watched him walk towards him in terror; he remained still when he surpassed him. Dionysus fell heavily on the bed and curled in a pityful ball, twitching and hiccupping silently. He twisted the covers and hid his face in the mattress. \"Cousin,\" he finally said, for ever since the god of pleasure had forsaken the name he was given he had only called him that. \"Cousin,\" he repeated, and the arm he had trapped under his body extended to offer a feeble hand, \"Make me feel.\" The god stayed motionless, only his head turned to the other. \"Cousin,\" Dionysus called again, and his voice cracked, \"Make me feel, please. I don't think I can on my own.\" \"Don't you have your wine and leaves and fumes for that?\" the god replied almost angrily. \"I don't want them. I want to feel with a person. I don't believe I'm capable on my own. Cousin, please, make me feel.\" \"If you wish so,\" and he swallowed air to give himself courage, \"If you wish so, then you should stand up and take me yourself; I will not move for you, or anybody else, and I will fight with teeth and nail to keep you from your desire.\" \"I know better than to ask you for something you'd hate.\" Dionysus replied, immovable as a dead man, his hand still extended, pleading for mercy: \"Cousin, please, please, make me feel.\" \"How do you think I can, if it's not me you're asking for?\" \"I am asking for you, because you have so many forms, so many more, so different from the one our king favors, and I need one, or two, or three, or all of them, no matter which you choose, but cousin, please, please, I beg you, make me feel, make me feel, I can't feel anything. Please, please,\" he repeated through tears, \"Please, cousin, fix me, make me feel, make me feel. I sent poor Ariadne back to the mortals because I couldn't feel a thing for my wife, please, I beg of you, make me feel.\" The god of pleasure slowly sat beside him, and with a shaking hand he began drawing gentle circles on his cousin's back. \"Your horns look lovely today.\" he whispered, for he knew Dionysus loved his horns despite being shamed for them and told to hide them. Dionysus didn't say a thing, but his sobs quieted a little, and his body stopped shaking and hiccupping so hard. The god held his numb hand and rubbed his palm with his soft fingertips. \"Why should I fix you? You seem to be just fine.\" \"You're very kind to say that.\" Dionysus replied, \" But the problem is, I'm starting to think I can't feel for a person. I don't know if I want to - though I'm sure I wanted to, when Ariadne said she should have married me for saving her - but I couldn't and it made her so terribly sad. I put the tiara I made for her in the stars and I feel so guilty, so guilty. It's my fault she was unhappy, because I fear I can't feel for her or any other person, god or mortal.\" \"You should go to my father, then.\" \"I don't want to go to my uncle. He's gentle and kind with me, bu I don't want to. I feel like it's odd to be around him, like I should feel something that never comes. I don't understand him.\" \"Then, to my sisters, perhaps.\" \"No, no, I don't want to. They remind me of what I people think I have control over. Over joy and laughter and being merry and such. But I don't, and yet they believe I do, and it is so sad, because I really am starting to be sure I can't feel. I think, I truly do think, you can help me better than anyone else.\" \"I think your mind is too hazed for a clear judgement.\" \"Isn't it always? But I'm certain in my folly. You remind me of good things, cousin. Like eating good food everyday, or looking at something you just finished to make after working on it for very long. You're good, so very good. You're helping me right now and I can't thank you nearly enough.\" \"I am just talking to you.\" \"You're listening to my ranting and rubbing my back after I cried, and then saying you don't believe me to be broken before trying to find a solution to my problems. It's very pleasant, very pleasant indeed. Oh, cousin, you're so kind.\" Dionysus moved slowly, readjusting himself; he laid his head on the god of pleasure's lap, facing the room and not his body, hand still clenched in his cousin's gentle grip. \"Wouldn't it be far more pleasant,\" the god suggested, \"If you were in your own mad environment?\" \"No, no! Please let me stay here on you legs, dear cousin. I don't need anything, just to stay here with you and speak the wine away from my head. You don't mind, I hope? I feel much better like this than I ever did.\" \"But you are a deity of madness and feasts. Isn't this far too quiet for you?\" \"No, no, it's wonderful. It's better than loud and crazy, better than all I have. I hate the leaves and fumes, I hate their smell and the visions they give me. I don't want to remember the past or know the future, I want to feel, and feel quietly, like we're doing right now. Oh, I love the quiet when I'm sober; I can hide in the woods with animals and stay put and relaxed as the hungover passes, and lay down on the grass and fall asleep by accident. But the quiet makes me awfully sad when I'm drunk, because I think of sad things.\" \"You don't need to...\" \"But how could I not? I'm such a useless god. None of the others will ever claim me as their child - oh, what fun would they make of the parents of a drunkman! Celebrations would have taken place regardless of my birth, for that's how people are; there was no need for me to exist. And what is even wine for? Quenching thirst and forgetting. There's already water and time for those. What a stupid discovery I made.\" \"What about the madness it brings? It is yours to cause and yours only, isn't it!\" \"Madness is the easiest thing to cause; mortal and gods alike drive each other mad at the drop of a hat. And what's more, I honestly believe can't even feel. I truly am useless. All I've ever done is get drunk and cut people to pieces. If I had never been born, nobody would have felt the need for me.\" \"And just like that, you forget your Maenads? You devoted followers, who listen to your every word? Think of them! They would long for you terribly, to give them a getaway from the world trapping them!\" \"My Maenads, my Maenads...\" Dionysus sighed, his fingers curling childishly around his confidant's knees, \"Oh cousin, I am so guilty about my Maenads.\" \"How so?\" \"They are very sweet and very kind to serve a useless god like me. They hold rites for me and care for me and leave presents for me, even though I can't do anything for them. I can't even make their vines and grapes grow richer so they can have more wine, because it is Demeter who has power over them, like she has power over all crops and plants. What can I do if I don't get tributes on my altars? Nothing; I have no terrible catastrophes to plague people into respecting me. I would just get drunk as I always do. Oh, how I wish I could get them to worship someone more useful that me. Oh, cousin, cousin dearest, I wish they would worship you.\" The god widened his eyes in surprise: \"Why would you say that and forsake your followers? Besides, there's much better gods out there than me...\" \"There aren't, cousin, there really aren't! Oh, cousin, dear cousin, sweet cousin, you are so gentle with me. I wish my Maenads worshipped you; you would be kind to them and their rites would be as sweet as you are to me right now. And they would feel pleasure every day of their lives, doing the most mundane things, from talking to working to sleeping to eating... They would never be sad or angry or dissatisfied, but only happy and at peace. And maybe their lust would be sweeter and made by caresses and kisses, and they would show you their children with happiness in their eyes and bless you, for giving them such a gift. Oh, my dearest, sweetest, kindest cousin, you're such a useful, wonderful god. I wish everybody worshipped you in your millions of forms.\" But he god of pleasure clenched his fists gently, torturing the messy hair of the Olympian laying on his lap. \"They're all rotten.\" he murmured, \"None of them is good, none of them fits me. So long as I'll be a god, I fear I will never feel like my real self.\" \"I'm so sorry, sweet cousin, I truly am. I wish I could help you, but my wine would just make you as miserable as me, I fear.\" \"My dilemma is mine only, and not yours.\" assured the god, \"Do not fret.\" Dionysus hummed softly. \"Becoming mortal... Is that what you wish for?\" \"I believe so.\" \"It sounds like a lovely idea.\" \"Thank you. If only I could find a name for myself, then I'd be free.\" \"It should start with B. I think it's a letter that suits you.\" \"You're quite right. It's a good start for a fine name.\" \"Will you tell it to me, once you find it?\" \"Of course I will.\" \"Oh, dear cousin. I love you so greatly.\" \"So you can feel, after all.\" \"Yes, it seems I can.\" The Olympians waited and waited for Dionysus to bring Hedone back with her head bowed in shame, admitting she had been but a foolish child to go against her nature. They waited with goblets full to the brim, waited ready for a cheer and the celebration of their order being restored. But the wine they sipped while waiting tasted as bitter as vinegar, and the horns the drunken god loved so dearly fell on their table. Dionysus was the god of wine, of subversion, of the misfits, of the unwanted. They remembered that too late, when the two cousins were already gone.",

      "Oh, I love the quiet when I'm sober; I can hide in the woods with animals and stay put and relaxed as the hungover passes, and lay down on the grass and fall asleep by accident.",
      "But the quiet makes me awfully sad when I'm drunk, because I think of sad things.\"",
      "\"You don't need to...\" \"But how could I not?",
      "I'm such a useless god.",
      "None of the others will ever claim me as their child - oh, what fun would they make of the parents of a drunkman!",
      "Celebrations would have taken place regardless of my birth, for that's how people are; there was no need for me to exist.",
      "And what is even wine for?",

      "I truly am useless.",
      "All I've ever done is get drunk and cut people to pieces.",
      "If I had never been born, nobody would have felt the need for me.\"",
      "\"And just like that, you forget your Maenads?",
      "You devoted followers, who listen to your every word?",
      "Think of them!",
      "They would long for you terribly, to give them a getaway from the world trapping them!\"",
      "\"My Maenads, my Maenads...\" Dionysus sighed, his fingers curling childishly around his confidant's knees, \"Oh cousin, I am so guilty about my Maenads.\"",
      "\"How so?\"",
      "\"They are very sweet and very kind to serve a useless god like me.",
      "They hold rites for me and care for me and leave presents for me, even though I can't do anything for them.",
      "I can't even make their vines and grapes grow richer so they can have more wine, because it is Demeter who has power over them, like she has power over all crops and plants.",
      "What can I do if I don't get tributes on my altars?",
      "Nothing; I have no terrible catastrophes to plague people into respecting me.",
      "I would just get drunk as I always do.",
      "Oh, how I wish I could get them to worship someone more useful that me.",
      "Oh, cousin, cousin dearest, I wish they would worship you.\"",
      "The god widened his eyes in surprise: \"Why would you say that and forsake your followers?",
      "Besides, there's much better gods out there than me...\" \"There aren't, cousin, there really aren't!",
      "Oh, cousin, dear cousin, sweet cousin, you are so gentle with me.",
      "I wish my Maenads worshipped you; you would be kind to them and their rites would be as sweet as you are to me right now.",
      "And they would feel pleasure every day of their lives, doing the most mundane things, from talking to working to sleeping to eating...",
      "They would never be sad or angry or dissatisfied, but only happy and at peace.",
      "And maybe their lust would be sweeter and made by caresses and kisses, and they would show you their children with happiness in their eyes and bless you, for giving them such a gift.",
      "Oh, my dearest, sweetest, kindest cousin, you're such a useful, wonderful god.",
      "I wish everybody worshipped you in your millions of forms.\"",
      "But he god of pleasure clenched his fists gently, torturing the messy hair of the Olympian laying on his lap.",
      "\"They're all rotten.\"",
      "he murmured, \"None of them is good, none of them fits me.",
      "So long as I'll be a god, I fear I will never feel like my real self.\"",
      "\"I'm so sorry, sweet cousin, I truly am.",
      "I wish I could help you, but my wine would just make you as miserable as me, I fear.\"",
      "\"My dilemma is mine only, and not yours.\"",
      "assured the god, \"Do not fret.\"",
      "Dionysus hummed softly.",
      "\"Becoming mortal...",

      "\"Of course I will.\"",
      "\"Oh, dear cousin.",
      "I love you so greatly.\"",
      "\"So you can feel, after all.\"",
      "\"Yes, it seems I can.\"",
      "The Olympians waited and waited for Dionysus to bring Hedone back with her head bowed in shame, admitting she had been but a foolish child to go against her nature.",
      "They waited with goblets full to the brim, waited ready for a cheer and the celebration of their order being restored.",
      "But the wine they sipped while waiting tasted as bitter as vinegar, and the horns the drunken god loved so dearly fell on their table.",
      "Dionysus was the god of wine, of subversion, of the misfits, of the unwanted.",
      "They remembered that too late, when the two cousins were already gone."

    "text": "Artemis and Apollo are twins, perhaps the only immortal full-blooded siblings in Greek mythology. As they have similarities, they also are polar opposites to each other. Artemis is a goddess of the moon, so of course the moon would shine right through her. She had blue, pupiless eyes (common for any god, due to their divinity), flourescent blue hair, light blue skin, and wears the simplest of dresses that does not even come across her knees. She wears her hair in braids, has a posture of a stern, cold, woman. She will always be the more intimidating of them both. She is the goddess of the moon, the hunt, archery, virginity, maidens, childbirth and nature. And then there is Apollo. Apollo, as bright as the sun, with golden eyes and hair and skin, his smile contagious and his future bright. After Leto had given birth to him, after those agonizingly slow days, Apollo decides that he was not worthy to be in Olympus, unless he makes achievements of his own. Artemis went to Olympus, and came back with her Hunters and being pledged as a maiden for all eternity. He loves his sister, and wishes for her to be happy. He loves her mother, and wishes for her to be happy as well. Hera, the Queen, being the petty woman she is, decides to send a giant after Leto to assault her. He was disgusted, and takes the giant's life with his golden arrow, which he shoots to his heart. He considers himself worthy, and thinks that he must go to Olympus to reunite with her sister. Except, Hera decides to send Python after Leto, and rampage around his grandmother Phoebe's cave. Oh, yes. The rotting smell of carnage, the Python's breath, it made Apollo enraged that such a disgusting thing would dare set foot in his family's sacred floors. With just one arrow, he kills the fiend. He did not need to drag out the fight. He decides to name this cave Pythia, and establish an Oracle of Delphi. Apollo had met Helios when he met Phoebe and decides to introduce him to her children. Helios was the same as Apollo; golden hair, eyes and skin, except he has a sun emblem behind him. He is a titan god of the sun. But Helios does not have Apollo's bright smile. The first time the god sees him, he had pursed lips and a frown on his face. Apollo is anything but the sun. He stays at the palace of Helios, watching his cousin ride the sun chariot with all its glory. Apollo wishes to ride that sun chariot daily, disappearing once Selene rides over the world. But as he stays in Helios' palace, he can shift the radiation of the sun chariot. Once the day was over, Helios had walked up to Apollo and told him how much his light manipulation was useful. Apollo was in love with songs. He loves the way the mortals play it, and enjoys learning it himself with the many instruments given to him. He keeps reminding himself to go to Olympus, to go to his sister and reunite with her, but it cannot hurt staying in the mortal world for just a little while, can in not? He listens into the scholars and philosophers, learning of the truth of the universe, the knowledge it brings him, their beautiful songs, their poetry. One day, as he was tweaking his bow, in his shock, he sees what the world is: the majority of possibilities in one look, how much light the sun can luminate in the vast thickness of the forest, and everything in between. Then he gets up from the rock he was sitting on, and starts to muse and recite poetry, as if he was practicing poetry at such a young age. The river's running waters, rustling of trees, the chirping of birds, they all sound like music to him, as he twangs his bow, humming a sweet song. Athena, the goddess of warfare and strategy, to name a few, had asked him to help her judge a mortal that had been plagued by the Furies after he had killed his mother. He was nervous, in fact; gods never get nervous. But he is intimidated by Athena, after all, she is a goddess of war, strategy, and architecture. Athena assigned him to defend the mortal boy, Orestes, from the Furies along with the Athenian Judicial System. He had to support and help this boy at all costs, even if it means going with the standardized mysogonist views on women in Ancient Greece. After Orestes had told his story, Apollo deems his story as the truth. When the Furies try to riot, his voice is enough to ensure peace and order in the court. It is true that he is in love with himself. With the many mortal men and women ogling at his feet, he feels truly proud of his looks; he can charm people all the way through. This does not need anymore context. He has listened to the many sayings of philosophers and scholars, but there was something missing. And once a philosopher-the first mathemathician finally made their breakthrough of using numbers and calculating them, Apollo claps happily as he gains another domain, as he gains more knowledge, as he gains more understanding at the world around him. Apollo is in love with the cities of Ancient Greece, the way they build their pillars out of nothing, their homes, every thing. And of course, the majestic temples Apollo loves to venture in, looking at them in wonder. He wonders if these masterpieces can be preserved through time, through every challenge it will face. That day forward, he starts to look to tribes and homeless people, whispering into their ears that day can finally be happy if they build a city. Of course, they have to sacrifice to him first. And he smirks as two more are added to his domain. Apollo dislikes venturing into Olympian meetings. As much as he likes bickering with Artemis, or playing mischievous pranks with Hermes, he dislikes others fighting with each other. His being is entirely reason, harmony, and moderation. He tries to appease the atmosphere with his godly powers, but the Olympians' energies are too strong for his taste, as he wallows in his peaceful mind. Apollo becomes fascinated with medicine from the doctors. He sees all herbs and mixtures, and every thing as they try to cure a patient from death. They can handle simple diseases, like a fever or cold, but not malaria or anything like that. They could not save someone from internal bleeding, or an infected part of his body. Apollo tries and tries to give the doctor abilities to heal more mangled victims, but he himself does not wish to venture far from his place as a healing god. After all, he was the one who created those diseases and sicknesses in the first place. At times when he is bitter with humanity, he creates a disease and let it spread around the world. He lets it destroy human being's bodies, leaving them to decay on the side of the road. He lets it destroy families, lives, and he lets it work the doctors to exhaustion. He smiles deviously at his work; healing and the plagues, and he loves how it contrasts deeply. He loves men, yes. He is a protector of young men, like how his sister, Artemis, is a protector of young maidens around. As much as he loves falling in love with men, it is also his job to protect them as well. He supports them as they become a bachelor, as they pick someone with a fair match to them, Apollo watches from afar with a smile on his face. He is the god of archery, god of prophecy, god of light, god of knowledge, god of poetry, god of music, god of justice, god of truth, god of guilt, god of order, god of beauty, god of maths, god of cities, god of architecture, his entire being reason, harmony and moderation, god of healing, god of plagues, god of bachelors. Apollo is almost the god of every thing, but yet, we keep forgetting that he is the god of many things.",

    "text": "Aphrodite waits by the girl's bed, sitting at her feet. She observes her with a calm grace, not that Aphrodite has anything but grace. She stares at the girls perfect legs for a moment, then shifts, spreading her body next to the girl's own. Aphrodite lies near her loves so rarely, but then, rarely are the objects of her affection as beautiful as Helen of Troy. Even Pygmalion could not carve so beautiful a woman, Aphrodite thinks. Helen sleeps poorly, tossing this way and that on a bed that is not her own. Even in this restless state, Helen--nee of Sparta, nee of Troy-- is lovely, her tresses fanning out over a pillow like one of Aphrodite's own fans, and just as beguiling. Aphrodite brushes one of her tresses slightly; she can't do much for the girl about the dreams, but she can make her even more beautiful. And she is so very pretty to begin with. Aphrodite did not carve her so --the power of the creator's touch has never been hers; no, if anything, she holds the other edge of the knife. Love destroys more than it creates. And certainly, considering Helen's finest two paramours are at the whim of other gods for love's wrath --Theseus still stuck in Hades' iron chair for perpetuity, all for want of an ill-chosen friend's bride; Menelaus, no doubt getting his own war poison poured in his ear by that sore loser Hera, goddess of marriage--well. Nothing follows in Aphrodite's wake like tragedy. Love begets so many monsters that sometimes Aphrodite wonders if she is not one herself. And yet, despite knowing all that, she waits for the girl to wake, hoping to comfort her in some way. She's sent the boy Paris away, to tell his family of their new bride. Will Aphrodite's tribute be curse or be blessing? Perhaps a bit of both. What funny things mortals are, she thinks, spending so much of their brief lives sleeping. Helen's mouth falls open slightly, a little snore issuing forth--a charming little reminder of her earthly nature. She is not perfect, and therein lies the intoxication; she is a mortal woman, in every way. But she is the finest of mortal women, Aphrodite thinks. She will be a legend; Aphrodite will see to it, personally. Aphrodite brushes her finger against those soft, dewy lips. Unlike so many of her kind, she has rarely known the taste of mortals, and even less known the taste of a woman. But if she was to sample any woman, why not this woman, the most beautiful of any women in this world? What is Helen, if not a priestess to love? What is Aphrodite, if not a goddess meant to be worshipped? She's sure Hera is telling the husband scorned that Aphrodite is jealous, wants the girl far away from Ares' eye. But she's wrong. Aphrodite doesn't want to bury the girl in Troy; she wants to exalt her, until all that is mortal burns away and only the glory of this beauty is left. She wants to taste her, wants to make worship upon this mortal and have it returned; wants to burn the world in beauty and love. Aphrodite strokes the girl's soft arm and dares to dream of touching more. The girl issues a soft groan in her sleep, not invulnerable to Aphrodite's charms even unconscious. She's waking, and Aphrodite's time is drawing short; she knows if she stays, she won't leave, and the girl has her part to play in this tragedy. Aphrodite bends down and presses a kiss to the girl's cheek. \"I give you my gift, beloved,\" she murmurs; her hand strokes the girl's cheek in adoration and beautiful eyes turn toward her, fear and surprise all too evident in that face. \"Are - are you...have you come to k-kill me, m-my lady?\" Helen whispers, even as her breath grows deeper, her pupils' dilate. She cannot fight Aphrodite's charms; no mortal can, and few Gods, even. \"I have always tried to keep with the god's commands, I...please. Spare my life. I have children, I...Please.\" Aphrodite is, in truth, a bit disappointed; someone so beautiful should not beg so readily, but doubtless, Ares, that jealous cur, has been spreading stories of her wrath, and given her Spartan legacy, this girl has no doubt heard them all. A pity that, but they'll overcome it, if not today --already Paris climbs the steps, all too eager for his first taste of his prize-bride. How Aphrodite wishes she could savor it instead! But love, Aphrodite knows, is a fickle prize, and the boy may well find it snatched from his fingers when Aphrodite wants the girl back. She is immortal after all; she can afford to be patient. \"Oh, my darling. I'm not here to kill you.\" Aphrodite stands, brushes the girl's beautiful, flowing hair one last time before she vanishes back to Olympus. Even as her body vanishes, she blows one kiss to the girl, gives Helen something to dwell upon until she returns. \"Helen, I'm going to make you live forever,\" she says, and though the girl breaks into tears at the words, Aphrodite knows she'll come around. After all, no one can resist Aphrodite, in the end.",

      "Aphrodite did not carve her so --the power of the creator's touch has never been hers; no, if anything, she holds the other edge of the knife.",
      "Love destroys more than it creates.",
      "And certainly, considering Helen's finest two paramours are at the whim of other gods for love's wrath --Theseus still stuck in Hades' iron chair for perpetuity, all for want of an ill-chosen friend's bride; Menelaus, no doubt getting his own war poison poured in his ear by that sore loser Hera, goddess of marriage--well.",
      "Nothing follows in Aphrodite's wake like tragedy.",
      "Love begets so many monsters that sometimes Aphrodite wonders if she is not one herself.",
      "And yet, despite knowing all that, she waits for the girl to wake, hoping to comfort her in some way.",
      "She's sent the boy Paris away, to tell his family of their new bride.",
      "Will Aphrodite's tribute be curse or be blessing?",
      "Perhaps a bit of both.",
      "What funny things mortals are, she thinks, spending so much of their brief lives sleeping.",
      "Helen's mouth falls open slightly, a little snore issuing forth--a charming little reminder of her earthly nature.",
      "She is not perfect, and therein lies the intoxication; she is a mortal woman, in every way.",
      "But she is the finest of mortal women, Aphrodite thinks.",
      "She will be a legend; Aphrodite will see to it, personally.",
      "Aphrodite brushes her finger against those soft, dewy lips.",
      "Unlike so many of her kind, she has rarely known the taste of mortals, and even less known the taste of a woman.",
      "But if she was to sample any woman, why not this woman, the most beautiful of any women in this world?",
      "What is Helen, if not a priestess to love?",
      "What is Aphrodite, if not a goddess meant to be worshipped?",
      "She's sure Hera is telling the husband scorned that Aphrodite is jealous, wants the girl far away from Ares' eye.",
      "But she's wrong.",
      "Aphrodite doesn't want to bury the girl in Troy; she wants to exalt her, until all that is mortal burns away and only the glory of this beauty is left.",
      "She wants to taste her, wants to make worship upon this mortal and have it returned; wants to burn the world in beauty and love.",
      "Aphrodite strokes the girl's soft arm and dares to dream of touching more.",
      "The girl issues a soft groan in her sleep, not invulnerable to Aphrodite's charms even unconscious.",
      "She's waking, and Aphrodite's time is drawing short; she knows if she stays, she won't leave, and the girl has her part to play in this tragedy.",
      "Aphrodite bends down and presses a kiss to the girl's cheek.",
      "\"I give you my gift, beloved,\" she murmurs; her hand strokes the girl's cheek in adoration and beautiful eyes turn toward her, fear and surprise all too evident in that face.",
      "\"Are - are you...have you come to k-kill me, m-my lady?\" Helen whispers, even as her breath grows deeper, her pupils' dilate.",
      "She cannot fight Aphrodite's charms; no mortal can, and few Gods, even.",
      "\"I have always tried to keep with the god's commands, I...please.",
      "Spare my life.",
      "I have children, I...Please.\"",
      "Aphrodite is, in truth, a bit disappointed; someone so beautiful should not beg so readily, but doubtless, Ares, that jealous cur, has been spreading stories of her wrath, and given her Spartan legacy, this girl has no doubt heard them all.",
      "A pity that, but they'll overcome it, if not today --already Paris climbs the steps, all too eager for his first taste of his prize-bride.",
      "How Aphrodite wishes she could savor it instead!",
      "But love, Aphrodite knows, is a fickle prize, and the boy may well find it snatched from his fingers when Aphrodite wants the girl back.",
      "She is immortal after all; she can afford to be patient.",
      "\"Oh, my darling.",
      "I'm not here to kill you.\"",
      "Aphrodite stands, brushes the girl's beautiful, flowing hair one last time before she vanishes back to Olympus.",
      "Even as her body vanishes, she blows one kiss to the girl, gives Helen something to dwell upon until she returns.",
      "\"Helen, I'm going to make you live forever,\" she says, and though the girl breaks into tears at the words, Aphrodite knows she'll come around.",
      "After all, no one can resist Aphrodite, in the end."

    "text": "Aphrodite loved few things more than voyeurism. It was a high pleasure, to watch a first love begin between their kind; seeing an immortal woman turn her first blush, or a man smile awkwardly as he first gazed upon his beloved. And few at Zeus' party were lovelier to watch than Demeter's daughter, still so damningly unattached despite all of Aphrodite's wishes - but perhaps not much longer, judging by how she awkwardly handled her wine glass, eyes nervous with an energy only Aphrodite could spot. She grinned and took up a position by the banquet table to better watch the girl. She was a lovely thing, wasn't she? Not as fair as Aphrodite of course - no one was - but her eyes were warm as earth and her skin dark as aniseed; high cheekbones, soft curves. Little Persephone had blossomed into a woman of well met and pleasing contradictions; born, somehow, with the warmth of her mother and the cunning strength of her father both inherent in that young face. She was a joy to watch. Particularly when she was so lovelorn. Aphrodite watched, nibbling seductively on grapes, as Persephone kept glancing toward the door with subtle hunger pains evident on her face. Why, the child was almost love-starved, at least in this sort of manner. What entertainment she was! It was hard to imagine her so-eagerly awaited lover would be unimpressed by the little goddess. She'd dressed finely in white and green muslin; now, all by herself, Persephone's fingers fiddled with her fibula to show a bit more of her skin - Aphrodite beamed. Demeter wouldn't approve, perhaps, but Aphrodite noticed the girl's tracts of land were, heh, well, quite fertile. She was a daring thing if she didn't think her mother would notice that. Speaking of the mother...Aphrodite's eyes scanned the room until she found Demeter, surprisingly far from her daughter. She was talking with Athena, and Athena, to her credit, seemed surprisingly animated. Perhaps too animated. Hmm. Wasn't Persephone clever--she'd even managed to shake lovely Demeter, Aphrodite noted, and wondered what boon Athena had received to occupy Demeter so long on talk of olives. Persephone's fingers continued to fiddle, now with her wine glass in her hand -- but she did not imbibe for liquid courage. Aphrodite's eyes sparkled. Had the girl chosen it to offer to a paramour? Or perhaps a first move toward a crush she hoped would be more? She scanned the crowd: most of the eligible males had already arrived. Hermes, she suspected, was Persephone's type--clever tongued--but he was merrily occupied flirting with Hebe. Hm. If not him, then Apollo? But no, Apollo, too, was here and well occupied, sitting between no less than seven muses, all of them fawning upon him. Hmm. Athena and Artemis were both already present, so not a female of her generation either. Hestia didn't go for that sort of thing and Hera...no one was brave enough to mess with Hera. Surely not Zeus, who was sitting on the high table far from her, and Ares and Hephaestus...well, the girl wasn't stupid enough to pick a fight with lady love herself, of course. Her smile widened. There were only a couple Gods who had not arrived for the latest soiree; Poseidon, who would show up conspicuously late and slightly drunk, and Hades, who...probably wouldn't show up at all. Well! Either promised a delicious show. It wasn't every day a daughter of Olympus decided to tangle with a king of a realm. Hips swinging, she walked over to Demeter's daughter, deciding she wanted a front row seat to this circus. \"Are you waiting for someone?\" She murmured, touching the girl with gentle grace. Persephone all but jumped in the air, the wine glass clattering from her hands and spilling onto the flawless marble floor. Aphrodite bit back the urge to laugh as the girl stared at her, furious. Someone was nervous, my my. \"Aphrodite!\" She hissed. \"You snuck up on me!\" \"Apologies,\" she said, gently wiping the girl's wine-soaked cheek with her diaphanous sleeve. Pity, she was wearing mostly white. \"I was just curious to see who has occupied your mind so.\" \"It's none of your business,\" she hissed; so defensive. Aphrodite tilted her head to the side and smiled. Ah. What an adorable child--so embarrassed over such a little thing. It was normal, she supposed--the girl was going for a god-king eight times her age. Scandalous, that...but a welcome challenge, too. Oh, she wondered, which would be better? Poseidon and Demeter hadn't talked in centuries after their little pony show, so the idea of Poseidon bedding down the daughter after having had the mother was juicy. Although if it were the horse-lord, Aphrodite would have to console the girl that he would never leave Amphitrite, and that seemed a bit boring. She never liked nursing the broken hearts. On the other hand, there was also Hades, so dour and cold; Aphrodite had found him seemingly invulnerable to her powers, much to her annoyance, and would certainly relish the chance to put him in his place with a spark of love. Plus, if anyone needed a pretty young thing to sit in his lap, it was him, though she was sure he'd find something to complain about in the process. \"There is no shame in preferring an older gentleman,\" she said, leaning forward and whispering in gleeful conspiracy. \"Why, they're a capital idea for your first. They know what they're doing and they are...quite thankful to help you, generally.\" Well, that was true enough of Poseidon. She was quite certain Hades hadn't gotten laid in centuries but if the girl was going in that direction, well...she was already lost to the idea of seduction, given the man had a soul as poetic as a rock. Persephone's eyes sparked in indignant alarm as she crossed her arms. \"Who says I am seeking only my first? Or even seeking a man, for that matter?\" \"Nothing wrong with craving a woman but let us be honest...If you wanted an older woman, you'd be making a pass at me, not staring love-sick at a door. And as for this being your first...\" Aphrodite snorted; she wouldn't tell the girl how obvious she was. \"Your mother has grown into a prude almost as sanctimonious as Hera. She won't let you out of her sight long enough to let you hmm, shall we say, pollinate? I don't think she'd let you out nearly long enough for you to have a good and proper fuck for your blossoming--and anything less than that may as well not count, darling.\" \"My mother cares greatly about me...\" Persephone said, biting her lips, and though her skin was too dark to see a blush to it, Aphrodite was certain she was embarrassed. Aphrodite was thankful she had no mother to lecture her own behavior. It seemed dreadfully boring. Persephone bit her lip and shrugged her shoulders in a desperate grimace. \"Please, let me be.\" \"Oh come now, this is my domain, little one!\" She grabbed Persephone's shoulder and pulled her into an embrace. \"How could I resist helping you find a man? And what man could resist you with love herself on your arm?\" Of course, most men would not even so much as look at her with Aphrodite on her arm, but at this point, Aphrodite was an expert at getting just about everyone to accept what she wanted. She was very persuasive. There was a clatter of horses in the courtyard and Persephone all but shivered. Aphrodite raised a brow - was this her beloved? Oh she was more and more entertained by the second. The horses didn't narrow it down; both of the other two kings preferred chariots for their locomotion between realms. She pressed a kiss to Persephone's ear, which made the girl twitch in a way that made Aphrodite almost pity her. \"Relax,\" she whispered; Persephone's hand gripped hers hard in response. Poor thing. Persephone looked as if she wished to be swallowed up by the earth itself. Which, when Aphrodite saw who walked in, seemed like a good sign, really. Hades stalked into the room. For the first time in...well, a good millennium or two, Aphrodite thought. As he had been the last time Aphrodite had seen him, he looked...aggrieved. No doubt some emergency or another somewhere, or at least what Hades considered one to be. She would never understand how someone who inherited no less than a third of the cosmos could be so sour. Sure, it was the worst part, but still, a third was a third! He started to move toward the dais where Zeus sat drinking. Hades was a sprightly thing for as big as he was, moving quite quickly; no doubt to avoid socializing. \"Is that him?\" She whispered; Persephone nodded, open terror and awe fighting for dominance on her face. My, how beautiful she was in that first glance of love. So it was not Poseidon who had captured the girl's interest. Hm. Well...Aphrodite squinted at Hades, still stomping toward Zeus like a bat out of hell (not entirely a bad analogy, Aphrodite thought), and then back at the girl. Well, they were opposites in many ways, but - hm. Both earth gods, she supposed that would be a plus, and might help Demeter like her daughter's beau better should things get serious; both a bit grave and, hm, both about as social as hermit crabs. Persephone was beautiful and wise enough to be a queen of a realm and he well...he was smart, and, perhaps, potentially handsome in his own way, if he ever learned to smile. Hmmm. Aphrodite smiled. Oh yes, her services were desperately needed. And she was ever so happy to help. Keeping her hand on Demeter's daughter, she dragged her forward. \"Hades! A moment please!\" Aphrodite shouted, waving her hands. \"What are you doing?!\" Aphrodite looked toward the little goddess and bit back a laugh at the girl's expression; doe-eyed as a deer running across one of Artemis' fields. Persephone wasn't exactly dragging her feet, though. \"Have you met him?\" She said in a soft, sing-song whisper. \"If not, I think it's time you're introduced, don't you?\" She couldn't imagine the girl had dared to run down to the Underworld gates, and Hades spent only as much time on the mortal world as reaping a wandering mortal soul would require. She wasn't even sure, honestly, where the girl had picked up this crush--but that would be a question to be asked later, while gossiping. \"I don't think he wants to...I'm sure he's very busy,\" the girl stuttered, and Aphrodite just hit her arm. \"Shush and smile pretty. He's waiting for us, and he wouldn't stop if he were that busy.\" And he had, in fact, stopped, though he looked absolutely annoyed to do so. She stuck out her hand with a ravishing smile and was pleased to see the girl imitate her after a moment, though her smile was less ravishing and more queasy. Still, it was a start. He shook Aphrodite's hand with his usual perfunctory nod and she smiled. \"Hades.\" \"Aphrodite,\" he said, and then to her amazement, he bent down and smiled at Persephone as he shook her hand. \"Ah, and...my thanks again for your aid, daughter of Demeter.\" \"Her name is Persephone, you know,\" Aphrodite supplied, and then widened her eyes with put-on surprise. So there was a story. \"Have you...met?\" \"Only once.\" Persephone's voice was a tiny mouse thing, so quiet she was certain the girl was trying to disappear into the floor. Not allowed, not when Aphrodite had her entertainment afoot! She nudged the girl a bit closer to Hades. \"Is...is your arm okay, sir?\" \"It's much better, thanks to you.\" He looked down at their hands, and Aphrodite cackled internally as she watched him slowly register they were still holding hands. Oh, how difficult it was to keep from laughing out loud! And to think she had thought this would be hard. \"I'm...I'm glad,\" the girl mumbled. She was a shy little thing, and the look on her face was at best apprehensive as she traced his big palm. Neither of the two said anything, but neither did Hades pull his hand away, and for a moment, she thought, perhaps--perhaps her job was done. But then he frowned, and dropped her little hand. \"I must be going, I - I have to go.\" She rolled her eyes the second as his back was turned; typical Hades, always focused on his job even when he'd almost landed a girl who was, frankly, way above his ability to seduce. (Not, of course, that that was a particularly hard thing to be; she was certain there were coral in the seas that Hades could not convince to spore, so brisk could he be.) Honestly, what could be so bad down there with a bunch of stiffs that he needed to give a beautiful woman such curt responses? She watched him as he grabbed Zeus's hand and the two talked; Zeus raised an eyebrow and they left for a more private antechamber. Disappointing that; Aphrodite had been meaning to practice how to read lips. Oh, well, gossip for another time. Persephone groaned and put her hands in her hands. \"Oh, furies fetch me, I am certain he hates me.\" \"Mmm, I would not say that.\" She said; any further talk was cut short, as she heard the heavy slap of feet upon marble beating toward them; she glanced out of the side of her eye and winced. Demeter was coming towards them, concern on her face. \"Demeter,\" she said, curtsying though it was hardly necessary. Persephone quickly adjusted her top back to a more conservative position while Demeter eyed Aphrodite. Aphrodite smiled; Demeter nodded stiffly toward her before grabbing Persephone's hand. \"Aphrodite.\" She said, before turning to her daughter. \"Daughter, where have you been? Athena and I have been looking for you, she is in desperate need of some help with her olive orchard. I promised her we would help.\" \"Alright, mother.\" Persephone looked utterly miserable; the girl was not very good at hiding her emotions. She'd have to work on that if she was planning on having a tryst with her death god without her mother finding out. \"It was...nice to talk to you, Aphrodite. I appreciate...\" Demeter's eyebrow rose, and the girl winced, realizing she'd said too much. Heavens above, at this point, Aphrodite would put them together just to get the girl out of her mother's shawl a bit. Hades might be no great lover, but at this point, she was beginning to doubt Persephone was gonna get the chance to find any other lover at all, not if she was going to be this shy with her mother about her wishes! \"It's nothing. I think it is kind of you to ask which flowers are preferred by the mortals for their courting,\" Aphrodite lied smoothly. Aphrodite had learned well how to lie many, many years ago, and clearly confronting Persephone about her desires would not end well for either of their causes today. \"I think they will think you growing more of them near their cities but a kindness.\" Persephone's mouth blossomed into a grin, as did Demeter's, her relief at the subject of their conversation all too obvious. And then the little thing was gone, and Athena - well, Aphrodite hoped she really liked olives, because Demeter's determined face suggested she was most definitively getting an entire grove full of them and in short order. She watched the girl until she disappeared with her mother and Athena (who already looked just a bit weary of olives, Aphrodite thought) in tow. Then she rubbed her fingers, and waited for Hades, so she could get to work. \"Hades!\" She waved as he stepped down from the dais; he looked up at her with an almost pinched expression, and she sighed. Honestly, with a face like that, it was not a wonder he had stayed single so long. \"Aphrodite,\" he said, wary now; he continued walking past her without stopping beyond his nod. Without the girl, he wanted less to do with her. Too bad. She fell into step with him. \"To what do I owe a second visit today?\" \"Demeter's girl...she is quite lovely, isn't she?\" She fluttered her eyelashes with a charm that had brought Aries to his knees. Unfortunately, Hades was, once again, stony enough it did not melt his iron heart. But he did stop, and she took satisfaction in that. \"What is your game?\" He hissed softly; his face was wary, almost but not quite angry. \"No games, just...concern.\" Not accurate, but believable enough with a distraction. She stuck her lip out in a way that would send Hephaestus to make her a dozen jeweled desires; Hades didn't even bother to blink. \"She is always with her mother, and well--it seems rare she goes out on her own, and she is so stunning a beauty.\" \"I wouldn't know.\" He started to move again, his mouth already opening to say excuse me and Aphrodite's mind whirled; she needed him to stay, at least long enough for her to execute her plan. \"How do you know her, anyway?\" She grabbed his hand, and felt him twitch; what a frigid man, she thought, tsking. Well, it wasn't as if the girl would know better. Hopefully, he'd warm up to her a bit. \"It's hard to believe Demeter would let any man near her.\" \"I'm Demeter's brother,\" he ground out between clenched teeth, yanking his hand back. \"Yes. And so is Zeus. And Poseidon, as well.\" His mouth tipped from straight, studious line to a frown, and she knew he understood her point well enough she need not press it. \"You understand why she is so...protective. Hence my surprise she would let her meet you at all, brother-of-Demeter.\" He stiffened, pride offended. Ah, in this men were all the same...though Aphrodite much preferred their other form of stiffening to this. \"I do not like your implication, Aphrodite,\" he said; his voice was cold and hard as iron, and it was clear from the hard glint of his eyes he had been offended by her thought. \"Then you need but tell me the truth so I will not worry, surely? And then I can leave you alone, which surely would be your preference.\" He sighed. \"Then I will tell it to you plainly: the girl was raising flowers near Pylos with some nymphs for some ceremony or other; my illustrious sister Hera had started her usual madness with Heracles again, and when Heracles saw Demeter's daughter in the fields...There is a resemblance, there. He took her for Hera. She was frightened and prayed for aid...\" He shrugged. \"I took an arrow to save her from being punished for a sin that was not hers.\" \"And she healed your wound in return, I am guessing.\" Her eyes sparkled; what a charmingly cute meeting. Oh yes. The fates were practically conspiring with her on this one. Why, no wonder the girl had fallen for her big, strong uncle, so quick to dashingly rush to her defense. And Hades! What thoughts must have flown through his mind, she thought, sitting patiently while the sweet little flower goddess rubbed healing poultices on his enormous arm. It was quite a delightful image. \"I did not know you had such a quick ear for the prayers of the pretty ones, Hades.\" \"Pylos is my city, and I will answer all those who pray there,\" he said, a little too quickly. Aphrodite smiled. Oh yes; he was a cagey one, but already she could tell he would fall victim to her plans just the same. \"Please do not mention it to Demeter,\" he said, his voice dropping as if the woman was sneaking up on them. \"The girl wandered far afield trying to bring happiness to the mortals, and I promised her I would not tell her mother, lest her leash on her only daughter tighten. If you suspect me having committed anything untoward for asking this of you, ask Persephone and she will confirm the story. It is the truth.\" \"I will not say a word to Demeter.\" She fell a couple steps behind Hades, acting as if her questioning was now satisfied, though in truth she had barely begun with her part in this passion play. \"I am satisfied as to your motives.\" \"Good. I will take my leave of you then, love-goddess.\" There was a relief in his voice there, and Aphrodite wanted to roll her eyes. Honestly, she wasn't sure which of them was a worse liar. Hades wore his face far too plainly. \"Ah, one last thing.\" Hades audibly sighed at this; he would regret that, she thought, when he heard what she had to say. \"It is not from me, mind. From the girl.\" \"Persephone?\" New tones in his voice now as he turned back to face her; hope, curiosity. \"She said she regrets your meeting was so short,\" Aphrodite said, playing with her shawl to show she was bored though, in fact, she was quite amused. Scheming was always the most delicious part of the courtship dance. \"She said she would like to meet you again, privately. Not so far as Pylos but --\"Aphrodite thought quickly, trying to remember where the girl lived; all the earth goddesses kept their temples in the mortal realm. \"There is a flower field in Enna, and she should like desperately to see you there in the early morning hours, when she can tell her mother she is bringing dew to the flower-tips.\" She would certainly be bringing dew to something, if not quite what her mother perhaps wished her to. \"I - oh.\" He was silent a long minute, then, in typical Hades' fashion, his eyes narrowed. \"Why would she give me this message through you? If this is a joke to you, Aphrodite, I will put you in chains and hang you deep in Tartarus, surrounded by the wailing of Titans.\" Typical Hades; she rolled her eyes. \"She had no time to tell another. Her mother saw the three of us talking and came to take her away after you left; she whispered it in hopes I could perhaps catch you. That is all. I quite like the girl; I'm not going to do any mischief.\" Aphrodite mixed her truth with lies into a surely pleasing poultice and Hades' suspicion appropriately dimmed; his wide throat bobbed in a tell-tale swallow, and Aphrodite grinned. Oh yes, her plan was almost complete now! \"Do you have a return message? I will sneak it to her when I can.\" \"Tell her...if she desires me to meet her there, I will be there tomorrow morning.\" He looked almost skittish, the poor thing; they were perhaps more alike than Aphrodite had thought. \"We are done then, I trust.\" He started to walk without her assent, and Aphrodite could not resist having the last laugh. \"I am sure the girl more than desires your meeting,\" she purred and was satisfied to see Hades stumble, and smiled to herself as she disappeared back into the party. \"Wake up, dear,\" Aphrodite crooned, standing over Persephone's bedside as Apollo's chariot began its rosy pink climb in the dawn light. She had not been able to find Persephone before Demeter and her daughter had left the party, but fortuitously, it was easy to find the love-sick goddess in Enna below. All she had had to do to find their dwelling was ask Hera, who had given it up with an all-too-knowing smirk. \"Wha?\" Persephone blinked in the dim first light of the day and her eyes widened in surprise as Aphrodite smiled over her bed. Smart girl; she hadn't screamed. \"What are you doing here?\" She scrambled to sit up in her bedclothes, and Aphrodite noted with approval that the little nightgown did a terrible job hiding the flower goddess' newly cut womanly figure. Oh yes, that highlighted the little one's curves nicely. \"I am doing you a favor.\" Aphrodite held up a floral crown to the girl, whose eyes widened; she knew what sort of declaration it was to wear a wreath of asphodels. It had taken her the better part of the night to make it, but these were the sacrifices Aphrodite made when it came to helping her neediest subjects. \"Your death god stalks the fields, goddess. He is looking for you.\" Persephone bit her lip as she took the crown; there was hesitancy on her face, and disbelief as well. Poor thing; was this what it was to have familial obligations? Aphrodite sighed. Honestly. If Zeus above were so skittish, they would not have even a tenth of the clan they held. Stars above, she wasn't even going to suggest perhaps Persephone owed Aphrodite anything for this favor; this was a mercy on the poor thing. \"Do not worry about your lady mother. If it is a short fling, why, what she does not know will not hurt her. And if it is something longer, well - your paramour is a realm king. She could not do better in arranging a match for you.\" \"He will think me foolish,\"whispered harshly. \"He treated me like a little girl, not a -- \" \"He does not think of you as a little girl. Trust me; I know something of these things.\" Frankly, the girl would be lucky to walk off that field without being plowed into it, Aphrodite thought; even surely someone as thick as Hades would be struck dumb by a beautiful woman wandering the moors in her evening clothes with a crown of his sacred flowers on her head. \"And he does not tolerate fools, so for him to agree to meet, he has already thought you worthy of respect in some way. You do want to talk to him for more than a few minutes, don't you? Maybe feel his arms again? He is quite strong...\" \"Yes, but oh, Aphrodite...\" The girl's legs almost shook as she stepped out of her bed. Aphrodite sighed. These two had a gift for making what should be the easiest coupling difficult -- and that was before they were even getting past kissing! Honestly. It was a good thing neither of them had drawn love as their lot, or the world would die, smothered by the combined worries of thousands of anxious virgins. \"No buts.\" Aphrodite helped her situate the crown on her head and sighed at the girl's nerves; she needed some kind of panacea to help her have confidence, it was obvious. Aphrodite rummaged through her pockets until she found an old perfume bottle; narcissus oil - that would work. \"Here, hold still a second.\" The girl did her best to not fidget, Aphrodite noted approvingly. She dabbed a bit of narcissus oil on her neck and her hands, making little arrows that pointed toward the girl's heart. \"What is this?\" She asked. \"Just a bit of lust.\" She winked dramatically and hoped the girl would take her at her word. Harmless enough as a fragrance, and if the girl didn't know it didn't have any deified aspects, well...It wouldn't hurt her. Persephone rubbed at her wrists self-consciously, and Aphrodite rejoiced. \"For luck. It won't...force either of you, mind, but it can bring a little delightful...frission... to such meetings.\" \"And mother won't -- \" \"Do you really want to think of her when he's waiting for you? Go. It's not nice to keep him waiting.\" She patted the girl on the shoulder and the girl nodded. \"Right. Right. And, Aphrodite?\" \"Hm?\" \"If this is a jape, I'll bind you with vines and bury you so deep under my garden even Hephaestus won't be able to find a way to dig down to you.\" Persephone smiled almost sweetly and Aphrodite widened her eyes in surprise. Well. They did say couples started to act alike, but generally, they at least kissed first. Hopefully, that newfound nature was just due to her nerves, or Hades wouldn't know what hit him. Though someone as dour as him could do with being bound for a while, she thought. \"Go,\" she said, and to her satisfaction, the girl did, slipping out the window. Aphrodite watched her as she slipped down into the ether of the empty streets below and skittered away. Ah, nothing like watching the virgin's first steps into a new, more sensual world. Aphrodite waited a few minutes; the earth goddesses' temple was as quiet as a tomb and she heard no sound of Demeter awakening. She wondered how long the girl would be gone; after half an hour of waiting on her bed, she smiled. The girl must surely be successful now, for Hades wouldn't have kept her so long if she'd blown it. After forty minutes, Aphrodite rose and started to walk toward the fields herself, slipping her silvery veil over her face so as not to draw much notice in the still dark light of early morning. She grinned carnally as she came upon them in the field, awkwardly kissing; the girl's crown was half-slipped off her head and her dress had been hiked up enough by Hades' thighs that she suspected it was no longer doing much to preserve her modesty, stuck somewhere between her navel and his chest. His hands were tight across the small of her back but--judging by the clumsy if earnest ardor on his lips, it was only a matter of time until those fingers moved on to a more pleasing spot. One hand started to dip lower to grab her ass as Aphrodite watched and ah--there we go. The little goddess made a pleasing whine in response that Aphrodite enjoyed, and well-- Hades clearly liked it, too, considering how his other hand abruptly reached up and tossed that nightgown off entirely. Finally. Aphrodite took a seat in a high tree, a smirk on her face as she watched the couple fall to the ground together, taking their first steps toward a strange new world. There was nothing she liked more than to watch, after all.",

      "And few at Zeus' party were lovelier to watch than Demeter's daughter, still so damningly unattached despite all of Aphrodite's wishes - but perhaps not much longer, judging by how she awkwardly handled her wine glass, eyes nervous with an energy only Aphrodite could spot.",
      "She grinned and took up a position by the banquet table to better watch the girl.",
      "She was a lovely thing, wasn't she?",
      "Not as fair as Aphrodite of course - no one was - but her eyes were warm as earth and her skin dark as aniseed; high cheekbones, soft curves.",
      "Little Persephone had blossomed into a woman of well met and pleasing contradictions; born, somehow, with the warmth of her mother and the cunning strength of her father both inherent in that young face.",
      "She was a joy to watch.",
      "Particularly when she was so lovelorn.",
      "Aphrodite watched, nibbling seductively on grapes, as Persephone kept glancing toward the door with subtle hunger pains evident on her face.",
      "Why, the child was almost love-starved, at least in this sort of manner.",
      "What entertainment she was!",
      "It was hard to imagine her so-eagerly awaited lover would be unimpressed by the little goddess.",
      "She'd dressed finely in white and green muslin; now, all by herself, Persephone's fingers fiddled with her fibula to show a bit more of her skin - Aphrodite beamed.",
      "Demeter wouldn't approve, perhaps, but Aphrodite noticed the girl's tracts of land were, heh, well, quite fertile.",
      "She was a daring thing if she didn't think her mother would notice that.",
      "Speaking of the mother...Aphrodite's eyes scanned the room until she found Demeter, surprisingly far from her daughter.",
      "She was talking with Athena, and Athena, to her credit, seemed surprisingly animated.",
      "Perhaps too animated.",
      "Hmm.",
      "Wasn't Persephone clever--she'd even managed to shake lovely Demeter, Aphrodite noted, and wondered what boon Athena had received to occupy Demeter so long on talk of olives.",
      "Persephone's fingers continued to fiddle, now with her wine glass in her hand -- but she did not imbibe for liquid courage.",
      "Aphrodite's eyes sparkled.",

      "Or perhaps a first move toward a crush she hoped would be more?",
      "She scanned the crowd: most of the eligible males had already arrived.",
      "Hermes, she suspected, was Persephone's type--clever tongued--but he was merrily occupied flirting with Hebe.",
      "Hm.",
      "If not him, then Apollo?",
      "But no, Apollo, too, was here and well occupied, sitting between no less than seven muses, all of them fawning upon him.",
      "Hmm.",
      "Athena and Artemis were both already present, so not a female of her generation either.",
      "Hestia didn't go for that sort of thing and Hera...no one was brave enough to mess with Hera.",
      "Surely not Zeus, who was sitting on the high table far from her, and Ares and Hephaestus...well, the girl wasn't stupid enough to pick a fight with lady love herself, of course.",
      "Her smile widened.",
      "There were only a couple Gods who had not arrived for the latest soiree; Poseidon, who would show up conspicuously late and slightly drunk, and Hades, who...probably wouldn't show up at all.",
      "Well!",
      "Either promised a delicious show.",
      "It wasn't every day a daughter of Olympus decided to tangle with a king of a realm.",

      "\"Aphrodite!\"",
      "She hissed.",
      "\"You snuck up on me!\"",
      "\"Apologies,\" she said, gently wiping the girl's wine-soaked cheek with her diaphanous sleeve.",
      "Pity, she was wearing mostly white.",
      "\"I was just curious to see who has occupied your mind so.\"",
      "\"It's none of your business,\" she hissed; so defensive.",
      "Aphrodite tilted her head to the side and smiled.",
      "Ah.",
      "What an adorable child--so embarrassed over such a little thing.",
      "It was normal, she supposed--the girl was going for a god-king eight times her age.",
      "Scandalous, that...but a welcome challenge, too.",
      "Oh, she wondered, which would be better?",
      "Poseidon and Demeter hadn't talked in centuries after their little pony show, so the idea of Poseidon bedding down the daughter after having had the mother was juicy.",
      "Although if it were the horse-lord, Aphrodite would have to console the girl that he would never leave Amphitrite, and that seemed a bit boring.",
      "She never liked nursing the broken hearts.",
      "On the other hand, there was also Hades, so dour and cold; Aphrodite had found him seemingly invulnerable to her powers, much to her annoyance, and would certainly relish the chance to put him in his place with a spark of love.",
      "Plus, if anyone needed a pretty young thing to sit in his lap, it was him, though she was sure he'd find something to complain about in the process.",
      "\"There is no shame in preferring an older gentleman,\" she said, leaning forward and whispering in gleeful conspiracy.",
      "\"Why, they're a capital idea for your first.",
      "They know what they're doing and they are...quite thankful to help you, generally.\"",
      "Well, that was true enough of Poseidon.",
      "She was quite certain Hades hadn't gotten laid in centuries but if the girl was going in that direction, well...she was already lost to the idea of seduction, given the man had a soul as poetic as a rock.",
      "Persephone's eyes sparked in indignant alarm as she crossed her arms.",
      "\"Who says I am seeking only my first?",
      "Or even seeking a man, for that matter?\"",
      "\"Nothing wrong with craving a woman but let us be honest...If you wanted an older woman, you'd be making a pass at me, not staring love-sick at a door.",
      "And as for this being your first...\" Aphrodite snorted; she wouldn't tell the girl how obvious she was.",
      "\"Your mother has grown into a prude almost as sanctimonious as Hera.",
      "She won't let you out of her sight long enough to let you hmm, shall we say, pollinate?",
      "I don't think she'd let you out nearly long enough for you to have a good and proper fuck for your blossoming--and anything less than that may as well not count, darling.\"",
      "\"My mother cares greatly about me...\" Persephone said, biting her lips, and though her skin was too dark to see a blush to it, Aphrodite was certain she was embarrassed.",
      "Aphrodite was thankful she had no mother to lecture her own behavior.",
      "It seemed dreadfully boring.",
      "Persephone bit her lip and shrugged her shoulders in a desperate grimace.",
      "\"Please, let me be.\"",
      "\"Oh come now, this is my domain, little one!\"",
      "She grabbed Persephone's shoulder and pulled her into an embrace.",
      "\"How could I resist helping you find a man?",
      "And what man could resist you with love herself on your arm?\" Of course, most men would not even so much as look at her with Aphrodite on her arm, but at this point, Aphrodite was an expert at getting just about everyone to accept what she wanted.",
      "She was very persuasive.",
      "There was a clatter of horses in the courtyard and Persephone all but shivered.",
      "Aphrodite raised a brow - was this her beloved?",
      "Oh she was more and more entertained by the second.",
      "The horses didn't narrow it down; both of the other two kings preferred chariots for their locomotion between realms.",
      "She pressed a kiss to Persephone's ear, which made the girl twitch in a way that made Aphrodite almost pity her.",
      "\"Relax,\" she whispered; Persephone's hand gripped hers hard in response.",
      "Poor thing.",
      "Persephone looked as if she wished to be swallowed up by the earth itself.",
      "Which, when Aphrodite saw who walked in, seemed like a good sign, really.",
      "Hades stalked into the room.",
      "For the first time in...well, a good millennium or two, Aphrodite thought.",
      "As he had been the last time Aphrodite had seen him, he looked...aggrieved.",
      "No doubt some emergency or another somewhere, or at least what Hades considered one to be.",
      "She would never understand how someone who inherited no less than a third of the cosmos could be so sour.",
      "Sure, it was the worst part, but still, a third was a third!",
      "He started to move toward the dais where Zeus sat drinking.",
      "Hades was a sprightly thing for as big as he was, moving quite quickly; no doubt to avoid socializing.",
      "\"Is that him?\"",
      "She whispered; Persephone nodded, open terror and awe fighting for dominance on her face.",
      "My, how beautiful she was in that first glance of love.",
      "So it was not Poseidon who had captured the girl's interest.",
      "Hm.",
      "Well...Aphrodite squinted at Hades, still stomping toward Zeus like a bat out of hell (not entirely a bad analogy, Aphrodite thought), and then back at the girl.",
      "Well, they were opposites in many ways, but - hm.",
      "Both earth gods, she supposed that would be a plus, and might help Demeter like her daughter's beau better should things get serious; both a bit grave and, hm, both about as social as hermit crabs.",
      "Persephone was beautiful and wise enough to be a queen of a realm and he well...he was smart, and, perhaps, potentially handsome in his own way, if he ever learned to smile.",
      "Hmmm.",
      "Aphrodite smiled.",
      "Oh yes, her services were desperately needed.",
      "And she was ever so happy to help.",
      "Keeping her hand on Demeter's daughter, she dragged her forward.",
      "\"Hades!",
      "A moment please!\"",
      "Aphrodite shouted, waving her hands.",
      "\"What are you doing?!\"",
      "Aphrodite looked toward the little goddess and bit back a laugh at the girl's expression; doe-eyed as a deer running across one of Artemis' fields.",
      "Persephone wasn't exactly dragging her feet, though.",
      "\"Have you met him?\"",
      "She said in a soft, sing-song whisper.",
      "\"If not, I think it's time you're introduced, don't you?\"",
      "She couldn't imagine the girl had dared to run down to the Underworld gates, and Hades spent only as much time on the mortal world as reaping a wandering mortal soul would require.",
      "She wasn't even sure, honestly, where the girl had picked up this crush--but that would be a question to be asked later, while gossiping.",
      "\"I don't think he wants to...I'm sure he's very busy,\" the girl stuttered, and Aphrodite just hit her arm.",
      "\"Shush and smile pretty.",
      "He's waiting for us, and he wouldn't stop if he were that busy.\"",
      "And he had, in fact, stopped, though he looked absolutely annoyed to do so.",
      "She stuck out her hand with a ravishing smile and was pleased to see the girl imitate her after a moment, though her smile was less ravishing and more queasy.",
      "Still, it was a start.",
      "He shook Aphrodite's hand with his usual perfunctory nod and she smiled.",
      "\"Hades.\"",
      "\"Aphrodite,\" he said, and then to her amazement, he bent down and smiled at Persephone as he shook her hand.",
      "\"Ah, and...my thanks again for your aid, daughter of Demeter.\"",
      "\"Her name is Persephone, you know,\" Aphrodite supplied, and then widened her eyes with put-on surprise.",
      "So there was a story.",
      "\"Have you...met?\"",
      "\"Only once.\"",
      "Persephone's voice was a tiny mouse thing, so quiet she was certain the girl was trying to disappear into the floor.",
      "Not allowed, not when Aphrodite had her entertainment afoot!",
      "She nudged the girl a bit closer to Hades.",
      "\"Is...is your arm okay, sir?\"",
      "\"It's much better, thanks to you.\"",
      "He looked down at their hands, and Aphrodite cackled internally as she watched him slowly register they were still holding hands.",
      "Oh, how difficult it was to keep from laughing out loud!",
      "And to think she had thought this would be hard.",
      "\"I'm...I'm glad,\" the girl mumbled.",
      "She was a shy little thing, and the look on her face was at best apprehensive as she traced his big palm.",
      "Neither of the two said anything, but neither did Hades pull his hand away, and for a moment, she thought, perhaps--perhaps her job was done.",
      "But then he frowned, and dropped her little hand.",
      "\"I must be going, I - I have to go.\"",
      "She rolled her eyes the second as his back was turned; typical Hades, always focused on his job even when he'd almost landed a girl who was, frankly, way above his ability to seduce.",
      "(Not, of course, that that was a particularly hard thing to be; she was certain there were coral in the seas that Hades could not convince to spore, so brisk could he be.)",
      "Honestly, what could be so bad down there with a bunch of stiffs that he needed to give a beautiful woman such curt responses?",
      "She watched him as he grabbed Zeus's hand and the two talked; Zeus raised an eyebrow and they left for a more private antechamber.",
      "Disappointing that; Aphrodite had been meaning to practice how to read lips.",
      "Oh, well, gossip for another time.",
      "Persephone groaned and put her hands in her hands.",
      "\"Oh, furies fetch me, I am certain he hates me.\"",
      "\"Mmm, I would not say that.\"",
      "She said; any further talk was cut short, as she heard the heavy slap of feet upon marble beating toward them; she glanced out of the side of her eye and winced.",
      "Demeter was coming towards them, concern on her face.",
      "\"Demeter,\" she said, curtsying though it was hardly necessary.",
      "Persephone quickly adjusted her top back to a more conservative position while Demeter eyed Aphrodite.",
      "Aphrodite smiled; Demeter nodded stiffly toward her before grabbing Persephone's hand.",
      "\"Aphrodite.\"",
      "She said, before turning to her daughter.",
      "\"Daughter, where have you been?",
      "Athena and I have been looking for you, she is in desperate need of some help with her olive orchard.",
      "I promised her we would help.\"",
      "\"Alright, mother.\"",
      "Persephone looked utterly miserable; the girl was not very good at hiding her emotions.",
      "She'd have to work on that if she was planning on having a tryst with her death god without her mother finding out.",
      "\"It was...nice to talk to you, Aphrodite.",
      "I appreciate...\" Demeter's eyebrow rose, and the girl winced, realizing she'd said too much.",
      "Heavens above, at this point, Aphrodite would put them together just to get the girl out of her mother's shawl a bit.",
      "Hades might be no great lover, but at this point, she was beginning to doubt Persephone was gonna get the chance to find any other lover at all, not if she was going to be this shy with her mother about her wishes!",
      "\"It's nothing.",
      "I think it is kind of you to ask which flowers are preferred by the mortals for their courting,\" Aphrodite lied smoothly.",
      "Aphrodite had learned well how to lie many, many years ago, and clearly confronting Persephone about her desires would not end well for either of their causes today.",
      "\"I think they will think you growing more of them near their cities but a kindness.\"",
      "Persephone's mouth blossomed into a grin, as did Demeter's, her relief at the subject of their conversation all too obvious.",
      "And then the little thing was gone, and Athena - well, Aphrodite hoped she really liked olives, because Demeter's determined face suggested she was most definitively getting an entire grove full of them and in short order.",
      "She watched the girl until she disappeared with her mother and Athena (who already looked just a bit weary of olives, Aphrodite thought) in tow.",
      "Then she rubbed her fingers, and waited for Hades, so she could get to work.",
      "\"Hades!\"",
      "She waved as he stepped down from the dais; he looked up at her with an almost pinched expression, and she sighed.",
      "Honestly, with a face like that, it was not a wonder he had stayed single so long.",
      "\"Aphrodite,\" he said, wary now; he continued walking past her without stopping beyond his nod.",
      "Without the girl, he wanted less to do with her.",
      "Too bad.",
      "She fell into step with him.",
      "\"To what do I owe a second visit today?\" \"Demeter's girl...she is quite lovely, isn't she?\"",
      "She fluttered her eyelashes with a charm that had brought Aries to his knees.",
      "Unfortunately, Hades was, once again, stony enough it did not melt his iron heart.",
      "But he did stop, and she took satisfaction in that.",
      "\"What is your game?\"",
      "He hissed softly; his face was wary, almost but not quite angry.",
      "\"No games, just...concern.\"",
      "Not accurate, but believable enough with a distraction.",
      "She stuck her lip out in a way that would send Hephaestus to make her a dozen jeweled desires; Hades didn't even bother to blink.",
      "\"She is always with her mother, and well--it seems rare she goes out on her own, and she is so stunning a beauty.\"",
      "\"I wouldn't know.\"",
      "He started to move again, his mouth already opening to say excuse me and Aphrodite's mind whirled; she needed him to stay, at least long enough for her to execute her plan.",
      "\"How do you know her, anyway?\"",
      "She grabbed his hand, and felt him twitch; what a frigid man, she thought, tsking.",
      "Well, it wasn't as if the girl would know better.",
      "Hopefully, he'd warm up to her a bit.",
      "\"It's hard to believe Demeter would let any man near her.\"",
      "\"I'm Demeter's brother,\" he ground out between clenched teeth, yanking his hand back.",
      "\"Yes.",
      "And so is Zeus.",
      "And Poseidon, as well.\"",
      "His mouth tipped from straight, studious line to a frown, and she knew he understood her point well enough she need not press it.",
      "\"You understand why she is so...protective.",
      "Hence my surprise she would let her meet you at all, brother-of-Demeter.\"",
      "He stiffened, pride offended.",
      "Ah, in this men were all the same...though Aphrodite much preferred their other form of stiffening to this.",
      "\"I do not like your implication, Aphrodite,\" he said; his voice was cold and hard as iron, and it was clear from the hard glint of his eyes he had been offended by her thought.",
      "\"Then you need but tell me the truth so I will not worry, surely?",
      "And then I can leave you alone, which surely would be your preference.\"",
      "He sighed.",
      "\"Then I will tell it to you plainly: the girl was raising flowers near Pylos with some nymphs for some ceremony or other; my illustrious sister Hera had started her usual madness with Heracles again, and when Heracles saw Demeter's daughter in the fields...There is a resemblance, there.",
      "He took her for Hera.",
      "She was frightened and prayed for aid...\" He shrugged.",
      "\"I took an arrow to save her from being punished for a sin that was not hers.\"",
      "\"And she healed your wound in return, I am guessing.\"",
      "Her eyes sparkled; what a charmingly cute meeting.",
      "Oh yes.",
      "The fates were practically conspiring with her on this one.",
      "Why, no wonder the girl had fallen for her big, strong uncle, so quick to dashingly rush to her defense.",
      "And Hades!",
      "What thoughts must have flown through his mind, she thought, sitting patiently while the sweet little flower goddess rubbed healing poultices on his enormous arm.",
      "It was quite a delightful image.",
      "\"I did not know you had such a quick ear for the prayers of the pretty ones, Hades.\"",
      "\"Pylos is my city, and I will answer all those who pray there,\" he said, a little too quickly.",
      "Aphrodite smiled.",
      "Oh yes; he was a cagey one, but already she could tell he would fall victim to her plans just the same.",
      "\"Please do not mention it to Demeter,\" he said, his voice dropping as if the woman was sneaking up on them.",
      "\"The girl wandered far afield trying to bring happiness to the mortals, and I promised her I would not tell her mother, lest her leash on her only daughter tighten.",
      "If you suspect me having committed anything untoward for asking this of you, ask Persephone and she will confirm the story.",
      "It is the truth.\"",
      "\"I will not say a word to Demeter.\"",
      "She fell a couple steps behind Hades, acting as if her questioning was now satisfied, though in truth she had barely begun with her part in this passion play.",
      "\"I am satisfied as to your motives.\"",
      "\"Good.",
      "I will take my leave of you then, love-goddess.\"",
      "There was a relief in his voice there, and Aphrodite wanted to roll her eyes.",
      "Honestly, she wasn't sure which of them was a worse liar.",
      "Hades wore his face far too plainly.",
      "\"Ah, one last thing.\"",
      "Hades audibly sighed at this; he would regret that, she thought, when he heard what she had to say.",
      "\"It is not from me, mind.",
      "From the girl.\"",
      "\"Persephone?\" New tones in his voice now as he turned back to face her; hope, curiosity.",
      "\"She said she regrets your meeting was so short,\" Aphrodite said, playing with her shawl to show she was bored though, in fact, she was quite amused.",
      "Scheming was always the most delicious part of the courtship dance.",
      "\"She said she would like to meet you again, privately.",
      "Not so far as Pylos but --\"Aphrodite thought quickly, trying to remember where the girl lived; all the earth goddesses kept their temples in the mortal realm.",
      "\"There is a flower field in Enna, and she should like desperately to see you there in the early morning hours, when she can tell her mother she is bringing dew to the flower-tips.\"",
      "She would certainly be bringing dew to something, if not quite what her mother perhaps wished her to.",
      "\"I - oh.\"",
      "He was silent a long minute, then, in typical Hades' fashion, his eyes narrowed.",
      "\"Why would she give me this message through you?",
      "If this is a joke to you, Aphrodite, I will put you in chains and hang you deep in Tartarus, surrounded by the wailing of Titans.\"",
      "Typical Hades; she rolled her eyes.",
      "\"She had no time to tell another.",
      "Her mother saw the three of us talking and came to take her away after you left; she whispered it in hopes I could perhaps catch you.",
      "That is all.",
      "I quite like the girl; I'm not going to do any mischief.\"",
      "Aphrodite mixed her truth with lies into a surely pleasing poultice and Hades' suspicion appropriately dimmed; his wide throat bobbed in a tell-tale swallow, and Aphrodite grinned.",
      "Oh yes, her plan was almost complete now!",
      "\"Do you have a return message?",
      "I will sneak it to her when I can.\"",
      "\"Tell her...if she desires me to meet her there, I will be there tomorrow morning.\"",
      "He looked almost skittish, the poor thing; they were perhaps more alike than Aphrodite had thought.",
      "\"We are done then, I trust.\"",
      "He started to walk without her assent, and Aphrodite could not resist having the last laugh.",
      "\"I am sure the girl more than desires your meeting,\" she purred and was satisfied to see Hades stumble, and smiled to herself as she disappeared back into the party.",
      "\"Wake up, dear,\" Aphrodite crooned, standing over Persephone's bedside as Apollo's chariot began its rosy pink climb in the dawn light.",
      "She had not been able to find Persephone before Demeter and her daughter had left the party, but fortuitously, it was easy to find the love-sick goddess in Enna below.",
      "All she had had to do to find their dwelling was ask Hera, who had given it up with an all-too-knowing smirk.",
      "\"Wha?\" Persephone blinked in the dim first light of the day and her eyes widened in surprise as Aphrodite smiled over her bed.",
      "Smart girl; she hadn't screamed.",
      "\"What are you doing here?\"",
      "She scrambled to sit up in her bedclothes, and Aphrodite noted with approval that the little nightgown did a terrible job hiding the flower goddess' newly cut womanly figure.",
      "Oh yes, that highlighted the little one's curves nicely.",
      "\"I am doing you a favor.\"",
      "Aphrodite held up a floral crown to the girl, whose eyes widened; she knew what sort of declaration it was to wear a wreath of asphodels.",
      "It had taken her the better part of the night to make it, but these were the sacrifices Aphrodite made when it came to helping her neediest subjects.",
      "\"Your death god stalks the fields, goddess.",
      "He is looking for you.\"",
      "Persephone bit her lip as she took the crown; there was hesitancy on her face, and disbelief as well.",
      "Poor thing; was this what it was to have familial obligations?",
      "Aphrodite sighed.",
      "Honestly.",
      "If Zeus above were so skittish, they would not have even a tenth of the clan they held.",
      "Stars above, she wasn't even going to suggest perhaps Persephone owed Aphrodite anything for this favor; this was a mercy on the poor thing.",
      "\"Do not worry about your lady mother.",
      "If it is a short fling, why, what she does not know will not hurt her.",
      "And if it is something longer, well - your paramour is a realm king.",
      "She could not do better in arranging a match for you.\"",
      "\"He will think me foolish,\"whispered harshly.",
      "\"He treated me like a little girl, not a -- \" \"He does not think of you as a little girl.",
      "Trust me; I know something of these things.\"",
      "Frankly, the girl would be lucky to walk off that field without being plowed into it, Aphrodite thought; even surely someone as thick as Hades would be struck dumb by a beautiful woman wandering the moors in her evening clothes with a crown of his sacred flowers on her head.",
      "\"And he does not tolerate fools, so for him to agree to meet, he has already thought you worthy of respect in some way.",
      "You do want to talk to him for more than a few minutes, don't you?",
      "Maybe feel his arms again?",
      "He is quite strong...\" \"Yes, but oh, Aphrodite...\" The girl's legs almost shook as she stepped out of her bed.",
      "Aphrodite sighed.",
      "These two had a gift for making what should be the easiest coupling difficult -- and that was before they were even getting past kissing!",
      "Honestly.",
      "It was a good thing neither of them had drawn love as their lot, or the world would die, smothered by the combined worries of thousands of anxious virgins.",
      "\"No buts.\"",
      "Aphrodite helped her situate the crown on her head and sighed at the girl's nerves; she needed some kind of panacea to help her have confidence, it was obvious.",
      "Aphrodite rummaged through her pockets until she found an old perfume bottle; narcissus oil - that would work.",
      "\"Here, hold still a second.\"",
      "The girl did her best to not fidget, Aphrodite noted approvingly.",
      "She dabbed a bit of narcissus oil on her neck and her hands, making little arrows that pointed toward the girl's heart.",
      "\"What is this?\"",
      "She asked.",
      "\"Just a bit of lust.\"",
      "She winked dramatically and hoped the girl would take her at her word.",
      "Harmless enough as a fragrance, and if the girl didn't know it didn't have any deified aspects, well...It wouldn't hurt her.",
      "Persephone rubbed at her wrists self-consciously, and Aphrodite rejoiced.",
      "\"For luck.",
      "It won't...force either of you, mind, but it can bring a little delightful...frission... to such meetings.\"",
      "\"And mother won't -- \" \"Do you really want to think of her when he's waiting for you?",
      "Go.",
      "It's not nice to keep him waiting.\"",
      "She patted the girl on the shoulder and the girl nodded.",
      "\"Right.",
      "Right.",
      "And, Aphrodite?\" \"Hm?\"",
      "\"If this is a jape, I'll bind you with vines and bury you so deep under my garden even Hephaestus won't be able to find a way to dig down to you.\"",
      "Persephone smiled almost sweetly and Aphrodite widened her eyes in surprise.",
      "Well.",
      "They did say couples started to act alike, but generally, they at least kissed first.",
      "Hopefully, that newfound nature was just due to her nerves, or Hades wouldn't know what hit him.",
      "Though someone as dour as him could do with being bound for a while, she thought.",
      "\"Go,\" she said, and to her satisfaction, the girl did, slipping out the window.",
      "Aphrodite watched her as she slipped down into the ether of the empty streets below and skittered away.",
      "Ah, nothing like watching the virgin's first steps into a new, more sensual world.",
      "Aphrodite waited a few minutes; the earth goddesses' temple was as quiet as a tomb and she heard no sound of Demeter awakening.",
      "She wondered how long the girl would be gone; after half an hour of waiting on her bed, she smiled.",
      "The girl must surely be successful now, for Hades wouldn't have kept her so long if she'd blown it.",
      "After forty minutes, Aphrodite rose and started to walk toward the fields herself, slipping her silvery veil over her face so as not to draw much notice in the still dark light of early morning.",
      "She grinned carnally as she came upon them in the field, awkwardly kissing; the girl's crown was half-slipped off her head and her dress had been hiked up enough by Hades' thighs that she suspected it was no longer doing much to preserve her modesty, stuck somewhere between her navel and his chest.",
      "His hands were tight across the small of her back but--judging by the clumsy if earnest ardor on his lips, it was only a matter of time until those fingers moved on to a more pleasing spot.",
      "One hand started to dip lower to grab her ass as Aphrodite watched and ah--there we go.",
      "The little goddess made a pleasing whine in response that Aphrodite enjoyed, and well-- Hades clearly liked it, too, considering how his other hand abruptly reached up and tossed that nightgown off entirely.",
      "Finally.",
      "Aphrodite took a seat in a high tree, a smirk on her face as she watched the couple fall to the ground together, taking their first steps toward a strange new world.",
      "There was nothing she liked more than to watch, after all."

    "text": "These are the things she clutches to her chest, memories burned into her from the night he left: --his eyes--Warm and quicksilver charming, crinkling with smiles that lied and looked perturbed upon the horizon, eyes she would know blindfolded, would know no matter what part of her they gazed upon. --his mouth-- His is a mouth that promises he'll be home soon even if they both suspect that's a lie. The words don't mean as much as how he says them, with a passion that tells her how desperately he wants to believe. --his hands--holding their son in them, just born; memorizing every detail with her, tracing their features in their child: his nose, her mouth, eyes as wide as hers but full of his father's quicksilver charm. A strong boy, he says, with a small quiver to his chin she doesn't comment on, her throat a miserable lump. These are the memories she carries; the memories she tries to weave into her second bridal veil. It has been many years; any hope she had of him coming home should have died long ago. Ithaca needs a king and her son is too young to lead; the mantle is too heavy for those small shoulders, so much more her own than his fathers. Her fault, her suitors whisper; she isn't deaf to their needless criticism. The boy is weak, like the mother. She thinks she would hate them all, even without shining Odysseus being an impossible phantom, an idealized ghost set upon a pedestal made of blood and steel. And so she puts it off, and so she says to her charmless suitors; I must have my veils before I can choose. And so she stalls, tells her ladies they must put into cloth what she remembers of a good marriage, a proper marriage. Every morning she makes seven stitches and every night she undoes eight; for how could she put Odysseus' hands into fabric? How could she trace that trembling dimple into cloth? She watches the sun set on the horizon, biting her lips as she wills his ship to come home, though it does not. So she pulls it down, draws out the stitches, leaves it nearly bare. Tomorrow maybe she'll capture him, tomorrow maybe he'll come home, tomorrow maybe Telemachus will stand a little straighter, grows into his father's tall, tall shadow. She still believes, knowing she shouldn't, that he will come home. She can almost taste it now; his smile as he comes home, silver-haired but no less handsome, grinning like the clever jackal he has always been, the man she has always loved. He can come home as a beggar, as an invalid, as a conquering hero--she will know him by his eyes, his mouth, his hands, and she would know him anywhere. No disguise he holds could fool her. But until then, Penelope weaves, sending the loom three paces forward and two paces back. She thinks she will know him when he gets home, but she doesn't. His eyes, his lips, his touch; they're all there but after 20 years gone, the memories loom large enough to blind her. Were his eyes so flinty, so pitiless then? Did he have such a long scar, a straight line so neatly bisecting his lower lip? Were his hands knotted with arthritic tension? 20 years changes a man. 20 years of holding precious memories tight in her palm make the mortal husband slip through her grip, the pedestals so high she can no longer see the man atop it. But it is the memories too that is their salvation, for he remembers the big, olive bed he first lied her upon, the bed they clamber to together now. And it is this she makes new memories of: --his eyes-- still quicksilver cleverness, with extra wrinkles that suggest the hard nights he has had, far from home; he looks only to her now, for she is his horizon, and he stares at her as if she is a goddess, despite her wrinkled brow and grey hair, despite all the years that have melted away in the time they have been so long parted. --his mouth-- talking in low voices of all the places he has been; the words matter less than the curve of the mouth, amused as he tells his stories to his favorite audience, the part she plays with a passion, cooing as he survives each story, closing her eyes and listening and remember that he is here, he is here, he is here. --his touch--gliding through her back, down her belly; there, a scar from when she fell off a horse during their wedding ceremony, here, a stretch mark from their baby. You have been so strong, wife, he says, and her eyes close, holding tears that ache behind her eyes. When they finish making love, they stay together, awake and sated but unwilling to part. He presses kisses to her head, and Penelope closes her eyes, knows victory after so many years of just barely getting by. The sun sets on the horizon; for the first time in years, Penelope pays no attention to it, for her sun burns in her arms, and all is right with her world. She does not weave again, but it does not matter; the future continues to spill forth anyway, even if she can never quite get his likeness in cloth.",

    "text": "Persephone watched the sundial in the Underworld gloom, as confused now as she had been when Hades had brought her here. Persephone didn't understand anything about the Underworld; not the strange light that seemed to be everywhere and nowhere, not the strange ruler who promised love but had kidnapped her without a single word, and certainly not the strange courtship gift he'd given her, the sundial that told no time. In fact, it wasn't as if there was even a sun down here that could reflect shadows. In the two weeks in which she had in the Underworld, she had never quite ascertained where the meager light of the underworld actually filtered in from. She would have to ask him when he - when he returned. He'd come every day without fail, twice a day. She'd always assumed he'd have servants and perhaps he did but--he saw to her personally. Every morning he came with breakfast; every evening with supper. She ate nothing, but he ate and watched her sometimes, talked to her. She had answered his questions, but hadn't dared to ask her own. She was a bit afraid to. She knew nothing of him before he'd snatched her up: he was a distant family member, even more so than her long-absent father. He talked softly, like her mother, but his voice was nothing the same: gravely deep and foreboding as much as momma's was calming and sweet. Talking to him felt like a betrayal; like she was giving up her momma for good. And she knew, deep down, momma wouldn't approve of him. Granted, momma hadn't approved of any man who had tried to sweet talk Persephone - Ares still no doubt bore the bruises from her sandals! - but Hades hadn't even asked momma. Just her father who...she couldn't even remember what he looked like, it had been so long since she had seen him. Uncle Hades hadn't been cruel to her beyond kidnapping her but...he had taken her to this strange shadow world. It was hard, refusing everything, or at least everything she could. She did make use of his bed, of course, and the bath he'd provided, and the clothes, but --well, what choice did she have? She tried to be polite to him, because he wasn't cruel and he seemed quite lonely, judging by how starved he looked for even the slightest glance she turned his way. Was he really the only thing alive down here? She couldn't imagine living like that. She felt a bit guilty for spurning him if that was the case--she could understand him grabbing her from the fields, almost, if he was so desperately lonely. Almost. But that was dangerous. She didn't know him that well, and what she knew was this: despite all his gentleness, despite his gifts and despite his damn wealth and riches, he had taken her without a single word to her. Men were dangerous, momma had always said, and none more so than ones bearing gifts. She had to be hard-hearted; she had to be if she ever was going to see her momma again. But it was quite difficult to be so when he smiled, as he had when he'd presented her the sundial. It was a beautiful thing, the most intricate sundial she'd ever seen: beautiful brass fashioned into a delicate circle, a pattern of flowers encircling the edges. For you, he'd said, so you can keep track of time. I know the gloom-light is...discombobulating. He had said it so charmingly, boyishly beaming, and he'd chosen the pattern well, flower after flower peaking through the bronze work; she traced one violet as she stared at the gnomon -- which looked perfectly functional but cast no shadows. She sighed. She did not understand this. She did not understand this gift, or this land or this man, or anything else that had transpired. She stared at the plate, willing any shadow to exist. It was such a nonsensical gift. One, who gave a sundial as a gift to a woman locked in a room alone? Two, who gave a sundial in a realm that didn't reflect any sun? And three, who gave a non-functioning sun-dial as a courting gift? He'd seemed so proud of it. Was it all an act to get her to relax? Or was it some sort of cruel trick to remind her that she was here entirely at his mercy? She didn't know the man and thus,his motives were difficult to guess. He'd be coming soon, she thought. It had been many hours since she'd last seen him - she wondered what he did all day. Did he have other women he saw too? She frowned. She didn't like the thought of that, but then again, his entire domain was full of the dead -- and how much work could that be? His brothers, she knew, had made no secret of the many, many women they had. How could he be different? She wished she could go outside. She kicked at the sundial and winced as she made contact and her foot welled up with pain. She brushed away the embarrassing tears as she sat back on her bed, cradling her foot. This was such a strange place, and she was at the mercy of an even stranger man. She just -- she wanted to go home. She hadn't always been happy with her mother, sure, but what child was always happy under their parent's thumb? She wished she understood why her father had told her uncle she was his wife now. She heard the door open and winced, angrily jabbing at her tears. He was here, and he'd naturally come at the very height of her weakness. \"I brought you some dinner,\" he said, and she heard him put down the tray in front of her. Her bed shifted as he sat at the tail end of it, a respectful distance away. She took a deep breath and stared straight ahead, refusing to look at him. \"I...\" he started and said nothing after it, and the statement hung in the air. She glanced at him from the side of her eye and saw an unbearable sadness on his face and how dare he, she thought. This wasn't hard on him! He wasn't the one locked up in a room far from everything he'd ever known. \"Please...won't you eat something, my dear?\" He asked, a nervous smile flickering on his face as he pushed the tray slightly towards her. My dear. She glared at him, nostrils flaring. My dear?! As if he knew anything of her, as if he could hold any claim on her. Bastard! She did not break eye contact with him as she grabbed the tray he'd brought. She caught his expression shift to a joyous smile on his face as she brought it into her lap, but that hope, much to her relish, dimmed as she tipped the tray downward, the food clattering to the floor. Both of them stared at it for a moment; she felt, instantly, a hot flash of regret. Two wrongs did not make a right, and there was every chance he'd punish her now for being such a disobedient captive. She should apologize, should say she was sorry, but...she wasn't...not really. \"I know...\" He began to say; he did not sound angry so much as strained. She glanced toward him, watching him with scorn she was trying but unable to fully hide. \"I struggled with accepting this realm myself. In time you will grow to love it, as I did.\" \"I am a nature goddess,\" she hissed, throwing every ounce of inherited regal standing in her tone. She was Zeus' daughter, and she would not let him forget it. \"I could never love such a dead place.\" He winced and held out his hand. She refused to take it. A shadow formed upon it and she startled, skirting back on her bed. Did he mean to take her by using his powers, by killing her with his own hands to enforce her being little more than his property? She curled into a tight ball. He flicked his fingers and a flower fell into his hands; he tossed it toward her gently, a mild rebuke in his eyes. She pulled it up, studied it carefully. A narcissus, much like the one she'd pulled up--well, when he had grabbed her. Nothing wrong with it, really, though she had never seen one in black before. \"You...\" She stared at it. \"You made this?\" \"You are not the only nature God stuck underground.\" His words were stiff and he wasn't looking at her anymore. \"I did not bring you here to give you grief. Whatever you think of me, know that.\" She said nothing. She unwound slightly, staring out into a room lit by nothing but gloom. She watched him; though his back was to her, she could see the tension in his arms, the way he kept flexing and unflexing them as if he couldn't decide whether to bolt for the door or turn around and shake her. He finally turned and faced her, laughing, but it sounded more ghoulish than sweet. \"Believe me, I thought this...I thought this would be easier. So much easier.\" His voice echoed with regret; for a moment, she thought she saw his eyes water, and she looked away. She refused to melt at the regret in his voice, though it tugged at her in a way she found troubling. He was so lonely. But she had known what it was to be companionless too, and even if he had been stuck down here all by himself, it didn't excuse him grabbing her. Wordlessly, he slowly turned back in her direction, though he did not meet her eyes. He knelt down on his knees and slowly picked up the food she had thrown down. He said nothing of her behavior and she didn't either, watching as he picked up the ambrosia he'd brought, along with bits of bread and cheese. The pomegranate he'd brought her was near her foot, and in a moment of unwise pity, she reached out and picked it up. Her hands brushed his as she handed it to him and they both froze. His eyes widened in clear shock and she withdrew her hands too quickly, unnerved by the sudden somersault her stomach did at the look in his eyes. \"Why did you give me the sundial?\" she blurted out, and his eyebrows rose. \"What?\" He said. He glanced toward it as if he had forgotten what it looked like. \"It's...It was a gift.\" \"What kind of a gift is a sundial that doesn't tell time?\" She hissed; she gestured toward the useless thing and tried to harden her heart against his stupid big eyes. \"Do you give that to all your favorite captive girls?!\" She knew her voice was shrill but she couldn't stop now that the questions that she had long mulled escaped her throat. \"How many of us do you have down here anyway?\" He was silent for a long moment and she blushed furiously. She'd broken her rule about how to handle her captivity and all she'd gotten from it was the look on his perplexed face. \"I think...I think we are both confused.\" he reached out a hand toward her, and she caught herself reaching halfway for him before she realized it and hastily dropped her hand back down onto the bed. To her surprise he stood, putting the little tray on her nightstand and, in one quick movement, sitting next to her on her bed. There was no respectable distance between them this time; there was no space between them now. He sighed. \"First thing first: there are no other women. I have never kept a concubine. If your father told you I did, such I fear he was only trying to make you jealous.\" \"My father has said nothing to me. I haven't seen my father since I was five years old.\" He winced at that; his hand reached out and lightly touched her shoulder. She sat up a little taller in response; why had the Titans made him so tall? It was hard for her to see into his eyes, but the look there seemed genuine, calm blue eyes staring deep into her own. \"But aside from my father's negligence, why did you take me then? If you're not in the habit of having women in your bed...\" \"I do not want you as a concubine, Persephone. I want you as my wife.\" He looked at her with softness in his eyes and she didn't look away this time, trying to figure out what my wife meant. \"I want to share my power with you, my realm...and my life. When I asked for a daughter to marry, your father made you sound far more amenable to this idea than you appear to be. I...did not anticipate this part of our coupling being such a struggle.\" He rubbed little circles in her back, and she was not sure if he was doing that consciously or not. She chuckled and stared out; his hand at her back, she grudgingly admitted, did not feel horrible. What did feel awful was the sudden realization as to why her father had offered her as little more than a sacrifice. \"You were played then, uncle. My father did not give me to you because he thought I was well suited to you, he gave me to you because I am the least of his daughters in his estimate. He may hold you in confidence as his brother, but - I fear our compatibility would have been little more than an afterthought to him...\" She could see it all too clearly: Her father loved Athena, his favorite; Artemis, Hebe, and Eileithyia were all occasionally her father's guests of honor in family dinners as well. Persephone and her mother? She couldn't remember the last time they'd been on Olympus, and only now did she realize just how odd this perhaps was. Certainly, she had never been invited to drink of her father's cup as all her sisters had boasted of doing. \"I am sorry you think your father saw you only as a burden to be cast away. I cannot guess at his motives, truthfully; of my siblings, I know your father least. But no matter the origin, your position here will be one of honor, Persephone. I will not be so bad a man for you, you know; a third of the entire universe is no poor prize.\" He sighed and stared at the sundial. \"As far as the sundial, as foolish as it appears to have been, I was hoping to impress you with my metalworking and thought something familiar to the above-world might have eased your heart. My subjects advise me such things are often found in gardens and I knew you enjoyed flowers. I apologize that it is....deficient.\" \"It is very beautiful, but...it doesn't work. There's no sun here to make a shadow.\" She looked at him as his eyes widened in realization. \"...ah.\" He groaned. \"I...did not realize that was how they worked.\" \"How can you not know?\" She scoffed. \"It's called a sundial.\" The entire conversation had made her a bit uncomfortable, and she was not quite sure how to feel about it. He seemed to have good intentions, and she could not shake the thought he was perhaps genuine in his affection for her. But still...he had taken her, without so much as a hello, and the theft of her autonomy rankled. \"I did not spend much time in the world above. Your mother had no doubt told you of our upbringing--\" \"She never said anything about you.\" Or her childhood, truthfully; Persephone knew her mother had been in a war, but her mother had always gone silent when the conversation was brought up, and they had coincidently found other places to be whenever the topic was brought up. Her own father was one of the subjects her mother simply did not speak on, any more than she did on Persephone's father's existence. \"I am ill-served by my siblings it seems.\" He sighed and ran a hand through his long curls. \"Your mother and I were both submerged into darkness by our father when we were infants. It was a...difficult time. When your father rescued us, we were thrown into the sunshine for the first time in our lives. We had lived centuries in darkness, with only one another for terrified comfort.\" \"I felt much the same when I came here,\" She said in a whisper that scratched against her throat; that hurt, the knowledge that he, too, had been held captive, and had still done the same to her. \"Except that you have given me no siblings to hold to in comfort.\" \"I am here,\" he said, and his voice all but crackled. \"I cannot--I did not think of it in such a way. Forgive me. I did not think you so...disagreeable to me. I should not like to think myself so horrid a tyrant as my father, but we all bear the marks of that war. This whole story is all my long way of saying... I was only in the mortal realm for the war and the world... The world was different, then. The Titans all but destroyed any fields to cut off our food supplies, so the world was mostly ash and fire. Hours after we banished the last of them down to Tartarus, I was here. I never saw the world you grew up in, beyond glimpses in the tales of men I judged. I never had time to look at things like sundials and gardens. I know only glimpses of the world and its customs above. A foolish gift, it was, and feebly made to boot; no wonder you think so poorly of its useless creator. I'll remove it.\" He stood right away, rolling up his sleeves, seemingly happy to have something--anything--to do. \"Don't!\" She said, surprised at her own vehemence. He sat down next to her, staring at his hands. He had tears dotting the corners of his eyes, and her heart was finally broken by pity; she knew he was much older than her, but he looked young like this, young and scared and as lost as she was. Perhaps he did not understand he had been rude. Perhaps she had only to spell it out for him, and he would understand how he had wounded her. He had apologized a bit, after all. She reached out one hand and carefully put it on top of his knee. \"It is very pretty smithing, your work,\" she admitted. \"But it is not the gift that wounds me. I don't know anything of you, uncle. If you had presented me such a pretty thing for my own garden upstairs, maybe it...maybe my feelings for you would be different.\" He sighed and put one heavy hand over her hand; for a moment, neither of them said anything. He looked at her eyes, and she studied his carefully; his face was stern, but it was not angry. He nodded, mouth moving a bit as he seemed to mull something to himself. He grabbed her hand and squeezed it lightly. \"I...apologize then. It is not how I know courtships have been done. I should have done more research on what you would prefer. But I cannot take back the time spent. Or measure it, evidently.\" He chuckled a bit, but it was more mocking than sweet. \"What customs do you know?\" Perhaps she could help him find a better path. She tried to remember marriages among the gods but she had only been a baby when Aphrodite had been married off, and none of her generation had been taken to spouse just yet. \"Our kin have few and our histories are mostly ugly. My father wedded my mother by forcibly copulating with her, as did my grandfather with my grandmother. Zeus tricked Hera into lying with him by tricking her with the guise of a bird. Poseidon and Amphrite...I do not know the sea god's customs but I doubt it was much different.\" She scrunched up her face, wondering with sinking feelings if he was telling her this as a way of announcing what he planned to do to her. Would he take her against her will? Would it hurt? She exhaled a shaky breath, trying to think of how to respond. He frowned and shook his head as if he could read her thoughts and found them foul. \"Stop looking at me like that. I won't take you. Unwillingly, at least. I am not my brothers or my father.\" Her stomach twisted, heavy at the thought of him over her. He was much bigger than her, she thought; how could they even....And what would momma say if she came home, hale and hearty, but not a virgin anymore? Why was she even thinking of this? He had said he wouldn't force her and she certainly didn't want him...but then why did she feel so dreadfully warm at the thought of his body on hers? Her skin felt warm, sweaty, and she blushed, distracted. \"What about Hephaestus and Aphrodite?\" she blurted out; she could remember Aphrodite's pretty gown if not much else. She wanted to think of something else, anything else; the thought of him on top of her was making her cheeks hot in a way she was not quite comfortable with just yet. \"Politics. Neither of them enjoys the other's company. That's not what I want for us.\" His fingers drummed against hers and she realized that she had been holding his hand the entire time. Oh lord father above, had he felt her hands slicked with sweat at the thought of him? Her face turned even redder at the thought. What would he think if he knew that she...she was thinking of that. \"The only other tradition I know is the mortal one. The humans arrange marriages between the groom and the bride's father,\" he hummed. \"The girl... is generally happy if she goes to a husband who can provide for her. Given how your mother has kept you in the mortal realm for all your days, it never occurred to me in all honesty that you would not feel the same. I can, and will, provide for you, if you accept me as your bridegroom.\" \"I'm not a mortal,\" she said; she experimentally ran her fingers over the top of his. His fingers were callused and rough; they felt far different from her mother's. But they no longer felt so strange, and she understood, now, why he had brought her here in such an abrupt fashion. \"And I do not need your money or your care.\" \"Indeed not. But...I will admit, my dear, I am desperately trying to follow a blueprint, for I have no idea what I'm doing. I've clearly made a right mess of it. Can we not...start over, you and I?\" She looked up at him warily; his eyes burned with desperate hope, and she closed her eyes, thinking. She did not entirely think she could forgive him just yet, but knowing why he had acted as he did made him...a bit more understandable. She leaned into him and his hand, hesitantly, wrapped around her back. \"Maybe.\" She leaned into his shoulder and huffed. \"You are not so bad. But I do not enjoy being locked in a room all day long. I need - I need to see the world.\" \"If I return you to your mother,\" he murmured, his hand gently thumbing her cheek. \"I'll never see you again. I know it is a selfish request but please do not ask me for that just yet.\" She pressed a hand to his shoulder, turning so that she could see his face closer. He obviously took this as a good sign, pulling her closer to him, half-way up his lap. She tried to smile at him with a confidence she did not quite feel.\" I cannot come to love your land without seeing it, uncle. You can't keep me in this room alone all my days.\" He put his hands across both her cheeks and she realized, dimly, that something had shifted; her stomach did a soft summersault as his nose brushed against hers softly, his face so close. \"I can do that, but you'll have to stay near me for a little while. At least until I have pointed out any dangers, so that you do not wind up falling headlong into Tartarus,\" he murmured. \"Would that be sufficient to convince you to give me a chance, dear one?\" \"...We can try,\" she murmured; his head tilted forward and she had only the thought that he was going to kiss her before he did. She closed her eyes with a soft whimper; it was clumsy, their heads slightly knocking together, but it sent an electric shock down her spine all the time. His lips were gentle and surprisingly soft. He shifted, pulling back, but those eyes stayed on her; when she opened them, he was already studying her, and she did not miss the desperate desire in those eyes. She was beginning to think he could love her enough for both of them, at least at first. \"Would you like to go for a walk with me?\" He asked, his voice shaking a bit. She bit her lip; momma wouldn't approve, maybe, but then, what daughter could make her mother happy all the time? She would keep an open mind, at least. There was no harm in that, right? She ran her fingers over the sundial as she stood, linking her arm with his. \"Lead the way...Hades,\" she murmured, trying out his name in her mouth; it was not so bad. His eyes grew wide as he referred to her by his name; she was pretty sure he had never smiled so widely in his life before given by the awkwardness of his expression, but somehow it was...charming. \"I like it when you call me by my name,\" he admitted, as if it wasn't obvious; she squeezed his hand as he took her from an opulent room into a wide hallway, lit with the same dim light. He kept his pace slow enough that she could easily keep up, and she leaned a little bit into him, shivering at the dip of temperature. He smiled and pulled his himation off his shoulders, winding it around her instead. \"Would you tell me about your life up there?\" He murmured, rubbing her shoulders. He was a very gentle man, she thought, and perhaps--perhaps that could be enough, for now. \"O-okay,\" she said, and wondered, if perhaps, they could make some light in this dark land after all.",

      "He wasn't the one locked up in a room far from everything he'd ever known.",
      "\"Please...won't you eat something, my dear?\"",
      "He asked, a nervous smile flickering on his face as he pushed the tray slightly towards her.",
      "My dear.",
      "She glared at him, nostrils flaring.",
      "My dear?!",
      "As if he knew anything of her, as if he could hold any claim on her. Bastard!",
      "She did not break eye contact with him as she grabbed the tray he'd brought.",
      "She caught his expression shift to a joyous smile on his face as she brought it into her lap, but that hope, much to her relish, dimmed as she tipped the tray downward, the food clattering to the floor.",
      "Both of them stared at it for a moment; she felt, instantly, a hot flash of regret.",
      "Two wrongs did not make a right, and there was every chance he'd punish her now for being such a disobedient captive.",
      "She should apologize, should say she was sorry, but...she wasn't...not really.",
      "\"I know...\" He began to say; he did not sound angry so much as strained.",
      "She glanced toward him, watching him with scorn she was trying but unable to fully hide.",
      "\"I struggled with accepting this realm myself.",
      "In time you will grow to love it, as I did.\"",
      "\"I am a nature goddess,\" she hissed, throwing every ounce of inherited regal standing in her tone.",
      "She was Zeus' daughter, and she would not let him forget it.",
      "\"I could never love such a dead place.\"",
      "He winced and held out his hand.",
      "She refused to take it.",
      "A shadow formed upon it and she startled, skirting back on her bed.",
      "Did he mean to take her by using his powers, by killing her with his own hands to enforce her being little more than his property?",
      "She curled into a tight ball.",
      "He flicked his fingers and a flower fell into his hands; he tossed it toward her gently, a mild rebuke in his eyes.",
      "She pulled it up, studied it carefully.",
      "A narcissus, much like the one she'd pulled up--well, when he had grabbed her.",
      "Nothing wrong with it, really, though she had never seen one in black before.",
      "\"You...\" She stared at it.",
      "\"You made this?\"",
      "\"You are not the only nature God stuck underground.\"",
      "His words were stiff and he wasn't looking at her anymore.",
      "\"I did not bring you here to give you grief.",
      "Whatever you think of me, know that.\"",
      "She said nothing.",
      "She unwound slightly, staring out into a room lit by nothing but gloom.",
      "She watched him; though his back was to her, she could see the tension in his arms, the way he kept flexing and unflexing them as if he couldn't decide whether to bolt for the door or turn around and shake her.",
      "He finally turned and faced her, laughing, but it sounded more ghoulish than sweet.",
      "\"Believe me, I thought this...I thought this would be easier.",
      "So much easier.\"",
      "His voice echoed with regret; for a moment, she thought she saw his eyes water, and she looked away.",
      "She refused to melt at the regret in his voice, though it tugged at her in a way she found troubling.",
      "He was so lonely.",
      "But she had known what it was to be companionless too, and even if he had been stuck down here all by himself, it didn't excuse him grabbing her.",
      "Wordlessly, he slowly turned back in her direction, though he did not meet her eyes.",
      "He knelt down on his knees and slowly picked up the food she had thrown down.",
      "He said nothing of her behavior and she didn't either, watching as he picked up the ambrosia he'd brought, along with bits of bread and cheese.",
      "The pomegranate he'd brought her was near her foot, and in a moment of unwise pity, she reached out and picked it up.",
      "Her hands brushed his as she handed it to him and they both froze.",
      "His eyes widened in clear shock and she withdrew her hands too quickly, unnerved by the sudden somersault her stomach did at the look in his eyes.",
      "\"Why did you give me the sundial?\" she blurted out, and his eyebrows rose.",
      "\"What?\"",
      "He said.",
      "He glanced toward it as if he had forgotten what it looked like.",
      "\"It's...It was a gift.\"",
      "\"What kind of a gift is a sundial that doesn't tell time?\"",
      "She hissed; she gestured toward the useless thing and tried to harden her heart against his stupid big eyes.",
      "\"Do you give that to all your favorite captive girls?!\"",
      "She knew her voice was shrill but she couldn't stop now that the questions that she had long mulled escaped her throat.",
      "\"How many of us do you have down here anyway?\"",
      "He was silent for a long moment and she blushed furiously.",
      "She'd broken her rule about how to handle her captivity and all she'd gotten from it was the look on his perplexed face.",
      "\"I think...I think we are both confused.\"",
      "he reached out a hand toward her, and she caught herself reaching halfway for him before she realized it and hastily dropped her hand back down onto the bed.",
      "To her surprise he stood, putting the little tray on her nightstand and, in one quick movement, sitting next to her on her bed.",
      "There was no respectable distance between them this time; there was no space between them now.",
      "He sighed.",
      "\"First thing first: there are no other women.",
      "I have never kept a concubine.",
      "If your father told you I did, such I fear he was only trying to make you jealous.\"",
      "\"My father has said nothing to me.",
      "I haven't seen my father since I was five years old.\"",
      "He winced at that; his hand reached out and lightly touched her shoulder.",
      "She sat up a little taller in response; why had the Titans made him so tall?",
      "It was hard for her to see into his eyes, but the look there seemed genuine, calm blue eyes staring deep into her own.",
      "\"But aside from my father's negligence, why did you take me then?",
      "If you're not in the habit of having women in your bed...\" \"I do not want you as a concubine, Persephone.",
      "I want you as my wife.\"",
      "He looked at her with softness in his eyes and she didn't look away this time, trying to figure out what my wife meant.",
      "\"I want to share my power with you, my realm...and my life.",
      "When I asked for a daughter to marry, your father made you sound far more amenable to this idea than you appear to be.",
      "I...did not anticipate this part of our coupling being such a struggle.\"",
      "He rubbed little circles in her back, and she was not sure if he was doing that consciously or not.",
      "She chuckled and stared out; his hand at her back, she grudgingly admitted, did not feel horrible.",
      "What did feel awful was the sudden realization as to why her father had offered her as little more than a sacrifice.",
      "\"You were played then, uncle.",
      "My father did not give me to you because he thought I was well suited to you, he gave me to you because I am the least of his daughters in his estimate.",
      "He may hold you in confidence as his brother, but - I fear our compatibility would have been little more than an afterthought to him...\" She could see it all too clearly: Her father loved Athena, his favorite; Artemis, Hebe, and Eileithyia were all occasionally her father's guests of honor in family dinners as well.",
      "Persephone and her mother?",
      "She couldn't remember the last time they'd been on Olympus, and only now did she realize just how odd this perhaps was.",
      "Certainly, she had never been invited to drink of her father's cup as all her sisters had boasted of doing.",
      "\"I am sorry you think your father saw you only as a burden to be cast away.",
      "I cannot guess at his motives, truthfully; of my siblings, I know your father least.",
      "But no matter the origin, your position here will be one of honor, Persephone.",
      "I will not be so bad a man for you, you know; a third of the entire universe is no poor prize.\"",
      "He sighed and stared at the sundial.",
      "\"As far as the sundial, as foolish as it appears to have been, I was hoping to impress you with my metalworking and thought something familiar to the above-world might have eased your heart.",
      "My subjects advise me such things are often found in gardens and I knew you enjoyed flowers.",
      "I apologize that it is....deficient.\"",
      "\"It is very beautiful, but...it doesn't work.",
      "There's no sun here to make a shadow.\"",
      "She looked at him as his eyes widened in realization.",
      "\"...ah.\"",
      "He groaned.",
      "\"I...did not realize that was how they worked.\"",
      "\"How can you not know?\"",
      "She scoffed.",
      "\"It's called a sundial.\"",
      "The entire conversation had made her a bit uncomfortable, and she was not quite sure how to feel about it.",
      "He seemed to have good intentions, and she could not shake the thought he was perhaps genuine in his affection for her.",
      "But still...he had taken her, without so much as a hello, and the theft of her autonomy rankled.",
      "\"I did not spend much time in the world above.",
      "Your mother had no doubt told you of our upbringing--\" \"She never said anything about you.\"",
      "Or her childhood, truthfully; Persephone knew her mother had been in a war, but her mother had always gone silent when the conversation was brought up, and they had coincidently found other places to be whenever the topic was brought up.",
      "Her own father was one of the subjects her mother simply did not speak on, any more than she did on Persephone's father's existence.",
      "\"I am ill-served by my siblings it seems.\"",
      "He sighed and ran a hand through his long curls.",
      "\"Your mother and I were both submerged into darkness by our father when we were infants.",
      "It was a...difficult time.",
      "When your father rescued us, we were thrown into the sunshine for the first time in our lives.",
      "We had lived centuries in darkness, with only one another for terrified comfort.\"",
      "\"I felt much the same when I came here,\" She said in a whisper that scratched against her throat; that hurt, the knowledge that he, too, had been held captive, and had still done the same to her.",
      "\"Except that you have given me no siblings to hold to in comfort.\"",
      "\"I am here,\" he said, and his voice all but crackled.",
      "\"I cannot--I did not think of it in such a way.",
      "Forgive me.",
      "I did not think you so...disagreeable to me.",
      "I should not like to think myself so horrid a tyrant as my father, but we all bear the marks of that war.",
      "This whole story is all my long way of saying...",
      "I was only in the mortal realm for the war and the world...",
      "The world was different, then.",
      "The Titans all but destroyed any fields to cut off our food supplies, so the world was mostly ash and fire.",
      "Hours after we banished the last of them down to Tartarus, I was here.",
      "I never saw the world you grew up in, beyond glimpses in the tales of men I judged.",
      "I never had time to look at things like sundials and gardens.",
      "I know only glimpses of the world and its customs above.",
      "A foolish gift, it was, and feebly made to boot; no wonder you think so poorly of its useless creator.",
      "I'll remove it.\"",
      "He stood right away, rolling up his sleeves, seemingly happy to have something--anything--to do.",
      "\"Don't!\"",
      "She said, surprised at her own vehemence.",
      "He sat down next to her, staring at his hands.",
      "He had tears dotting the corners of his eyes, and her heart was finally broken by pity; she knew he was much older than her, but he looked young like this, young and scared and as lost as she was.",
      "Perhaps he did not understand he had been rude.",
      "Perhaps she had only to spell it out for him, and he would understand how he had wounded her.",
      "He had apologized a bit, after all.",
      "She reached out one hand and carefully put it on top of his knee.",
      "\"It is very pretty smithing, your work,\" she admitted.",
      "\"But it is not the gift that wounds me.",
      "I don't know anything of you, uncle.",
      "If you had presented me such a pretty thing for my own garden upstairs, maybe it...maybe my feelings for you would be different.\"",
      "He sighed and put one heavy hand over her hand; for a moment, neither of them said anything.",
      "He looked at her eyes, and she studied his carefully; his face was stern, but it was not angry.",
      "He nodded, mouth moving a bit as he seemed to mull something to himself.",
      "He grabbed her hand and squeezed it lightly.",
      "\"I...apologize then.",
      "It is not how I know courtships have been done.",
      "I should have done more research on what you would prefer.",
      "But I cannot take back the time spent.",
      "Or measure it, evidently.\"",
      "He chuckled a bit, but it was more mocking than sweet.",
      "\"What customs do you know?\"",
      "Perhaps she could help him find a better path.",
      "She tried to remember marriages among the gods but she had only been a baby when Aphrodite had been married off, and none of her generation had been taken to spouse just yet.",
      "\"Our kin have few and our histories are mostly ugly.",
      "My father wedded my mother by forcibly copulating with her, as did my grandfather with my grandmother.",
      "Zeus tricked Hera into lying with him by tricking her with the guise of a bird.",
      "Poseidon and Amphrite...I do not know the sea god's customs but I doubt it was much different.\"",
      "She scrunched up her face, wondering with sinking feelings if he was telling her this as a way of announcing what he planned to do to her.",
      "Would he take her against her will?",
      "Would it hurt?",
      "She exhaled a shaky breath, trying to think of how to respond.",
      "He frowned and shook his head as if he could read her thoughts and found them foul.",
      "\"Stop looking at me like that.",
      "I won't take you.",
      "Unwillingly, at least.",
      "I am not my brothers or my father.\"",
      "Her stomach twisted, heavy at the thought of him over her.",
      "He was much bigger than her, she thought; how could they even....And what would momma say if she came home, hale and hearty, but not a virgin anymore?",
      "Why was she even thinking of this?",
      "He had said he wouldn't force her and she certainly didn't want him...but then why did she feel so dreadfully warm at the thought of his body on hers?",
      "Her skin felt warm, sweaty, and she blushed, distracted.",
      "\"What about Hephaestus and Aphrodite?\" she blurted out; she could remember Aphrodite's pretty gown if not much else.",
      "She wanted to think of something else, anything else; the thought of him on top of her was making her cheeks hot in a way she was not quite comfortable with just yet.",
      "\"Politics.",
      "Neither of them enjoys the other's company.",
      "That's not what I want for us.\"",
      "His fingers drummed against hers and she realized that she had been holding his hand the entire time.",
      "Oh lord father above, had he felt her hands slicked with sweat at the thought of him?",
      "Her face turned even redder at the thought.",
      "What would he think if he knew that she...she was thinking of that.",
      "\"The only other tradition I know is the mortal one.",
      "The humans arrange marriages between the groom and the bride's father,\" he hummed.",
      "\"The girl... is generally happy if she goes to a husband who can provide for her.",
      "Given how your mother has kept you in the mortal realm for all your days, it never occurred to me in all honesty that you would not feel the same.",
      "I can, and will, provide for you, if you accept me as your bridegroom.\"",
      "\"I'm not a mortal,\" she said; she experimentally ran her fingers over the top of his.",
      "His fingers were callused and rough; they felt far different from her mother's.",
      "But they no longer felt so strange, and she understood, now, why he had brought her here in such an abrupt fashion.",
      "\"And I do not need your money or your care.\"",
      "\"Indeed not.",
      "But...I will admit, my dear, I am desperately trying to follow a blueprint, for I have no idea what I'm doing.",
      "I've clearly made a right mess of it.",
      "Can we not...start over, you and I?\"",
      "She looked up at him warily; his eyes burned with desperate hope, and she closed her eyes, thinking.",
      "She did not entirely think she could forgive him just yet, but knowing why he had acted as he did made him...a bit more understandable.",
      "She leaned into him and his hand, hesitantly, wrapped around her back.",
      "\"Maybe.\"",
      "She leaned into his shoulder and huffed.",
      "\"You are not so bad.",
      "But I do not enjoy being locked in a room all day long.",
      "I need - I need to see the world.\"",
      "\"If I return you to your mother,\" he murmured, his hand gently thumbing her cheek.",
      "\"I'll never see you again.",
      "I know it is a selfish request but please do not ask me for that just yet.\"",
      "She pressed a hand to his shoulder, turning so that she could see his face closer.",
      "He obviously took this as a good sign, pulling her closer to him, half-way up his lap.",
      "She tried to smile at him with a confidence she did not quite feel.\"",
      "I cannot come to love your land without seeing it, uncle.",
      "You can't keep me in this room alone all my days.\"",
      "He put his hands across both her cheeks and she realized, dimly, that something had shifted; her stomach did a soft summersault as his nose brushed against hers softly, his face so close.",
      "\"I can do that, but you'll have to stay near me for a little while.",
      "At least until I have pointed out any dangers, so that you do not wind up falling headlong into Tartarus,\" he murmured.",
      "\"Would that be sufficient to convince you to give me a chance, dear one?\" \"...We can try,\" she murmured; his head tilted forward and she had only the thought that he was going to kiss her before he did.",
      "She closed her eyes with a soft whimper; it was clumsy, their heads slightly knocking together, but it sent an electric shock down her spine all the time.",
      "His lips were gentle and surprisingly soft.",
      "He shifted, pulling back, but those eyes stayed on her; when she opened them, he was already studying her, and she did not miss the desperate desire in those eyes.",
      "She was beginning to think he could love her enough for both of them, at least at first.",
      "\"Would you like to go for a walk with me?\"",
      "He asked, his voice shaking a bit.",
      "She bit her lip; momma wouldn't approve, maybe, but then, what daughter could make her mother happy all the time?",
      "She would keep an open mind, at least.",
      "There was no harm in that, right?",
      "She ran her fingers over the sundial as she stood, linking her arm with his.",
      "\"Lead the way...Hades,\" she murmured, trying out his name in her mouth; it was not so bad.",
      "His eyes grew wide as he referred to her by his name; she was pretty sure he had never smiled so widely in his life before given by the awkwardness of his expression, but somehow it was...charming.",
      "\"I like it when you call me by my name,\" he admitted, as if it wasn't obvious; she squeezed his hand as he took her from an opulent room into a wide hallway, lit with the same dim light.",
      "He kept his pace slow enough that she could easily keep up, and she leaned a little bit into him, shivering at the dip of temperature.",
      "He smiled and pulled his himation off his shoulders, winding it around her instead.",
      "\"Would you tell me about your life up there?\"",
      "He murmured, rubbing her shoulders.",
      "He was a very gentle man, she thought, and perhaps--perhaps that could be enough, for now.",
      "\"O-okay,\" she said, and wondered, if perhaps, they could make some light in this dark land after all."

    "text": "Before the Greek ships leave the shore of Troy, Teucer goes to visit Ajax's tomb one last time. He kneels to cut a lock of his hair and pours wine as a libation. It is still a bitter regret to him that, for all the times Ajax protected him, on that day Teucer didn't come in time. No enemy could defeat Ajax's strength; he lies here still undefeated by any hand but his own. He feels he should find some words that are worthy, something that does honor to Ajax and to this place. But no words come to him. Finally he says, \"You guarded this shore for so many years. Stay here and guard it still. When they see your tomb, people will say, 'This is the tomb of Ajax son of Telamon, greatest of the Greek warriors at Troy.' And your name will never fade.\" He stiffly levers himself to his feet. \"As for your son Eurysaces, I will bring him safely to our father.\" The place isn't far from here, where Teucer followed the sound of Tecmessa's cry and found Ajax lying among the reeds, the sword once given by Hector pierced through his chest. It was the one time Teucer stood over Ajax's body to protect him. Fury and fear blurred together; he defied the sons of Atreus, and would have fought the entire Greek army if need be. To protect Ajax's wife and young child, to give his brother burial: if he couldn't do that, better to perish there and let the sons of Atreus leave them both unburied together. Standing by Ajax's corpse, Agamemnon mocked Teucer--as he would not have dared while Ajax was alive--for speaking like his foreign mother. It wasn't true. Ever since he was young, he shaped his speech to imitate Ajax or their father Telamon. If he was a foreigner, a barbarian, then he couldn't follow Ajax to battle. He wouldn't give anyone reason to say that he wasn't worthy to be Ajax's brother or to stand by his side. Teucer cannot think of anything more to say. Ajax was never a man for many words, in any case. He was always a man of action. Teucer stands for a while in silence, while the reeds hiss in the wind. At last he turns and walks away. Arrived back at the camp, Teucer looks once around the hut where he has spent so many years. He has made it comfortable enough with captured trophies, but it was never home. They have all been away from home for a long time. After a moment, he takes down the shield hanging on the wall. It has been there since Ajax died, where Teucer can see it when he opens his eyes. It seemed in his heart that as long as that shield hung on his wall, the Trojans would never threaten the Greek encampment or burn their ships. Nonsense, of course. A spear is nothing without a strong arm to wield it, and even the shield of Ajax is no protection without the presence of Ajax himself. Teucer knew it was foolish to regard the shield itself as protection, but each time before going into battle he touched it like a talisman. He pressed his hand to it for a long moment before going into the darkness of the wooden horse, the trick that finally let the Greeks take Troy. Teucer can barely lift the shield, made from seven layers of bull's hide covered with bronze, though Ajax always swung it around with ease. He lacks the height, the sturdy build and broad shoulders of his brother, who was called a tower of strength and the bulwark of the Achaeans. Teucer hefts it onto his back and goes to find Tecmessa, his brother's spear-won bride. Tecmessa makes him welcome, offering him food and drink, but Teucer shakes his head. \"Is Eurysaces here?\" Tecmessa calls the boy over. He grins cheerfully at Teucer. It's hard to tell with a child so young, but he doesn't seem to have inherited any tendency to brood. Teucer swings the shield from his back and sets it down, resting the rim on the ground. \"Eurysaces, do you know what this is?\" \"A shield!\" Eurysaces says brightly. Of course the boy knows the word; growing up in an armed camp, he would have learned 'spear' and 'shield' and 'armor' almost before 'mother' and 'father'. Teucer holds the shield upright, his hands on the upper rim. \"This was your father's shield, Eurysaces. When he died, he wanted you to have it.\" Eurysaces considers this for a moment. \"I want to hold it!\" He puts his small hands on the rim of the shield, and pouts when Teucer doesn't let go. \"I want to hold it myself!\" Teucer lets go. The shield wavers in the boy's grasp, and Teucer quickly steadies it from the side before it can topple over onto him. Eurysaces can barely see over the shield; of course it's too heavy for him to hold. Will he have the strength to wield it someday, Teucer wonders? If he turns out to be on the slender side, perhaps he could be an archer like Teucer. That wouldn't be so bad. For a moment Teucer lets himself imagine seeing the boy grow up into an image of his father, guiding his hands on the sword or bow. He dismisses the image with a small shake of his head. When he returns to Salamis, Teucer will have to face his father's judgement. Teucer has committed no crime, but he--the second son, the bastard--is alive when his brother is dead. Perhaps it is better not to think too far ahead. Teucer gently lifts the shield out of the boy's hands. \"That's enough for now,\" he says. \"I'll see it stowed on one of the ships for you.\" He will do it himself. Teucer will not entrust his brother's shield to anyone else's hands. Tecmessa comes forward, resting her hands gently on her son's shoulders from behind. \"You have always treated us both well.\" She meets his eyes with her clear gaze. \"We are fortunate in your protection.\" \"I made a promise to the dead,\" Teucer says shortly. There should be no question; she doesn't owe him thanks for it. The bronze shield is a heavy weight in his hands. \"You don't have to worry,\" he adds a little awkwardly. \"When we get to Salamis, I'll tell my father how things are. I'll bring you and the boy to him and the queen Eriboea. They will welcome their own son's child.\" \"And me?\" Tecmessa murmurs, with doubt in her eyes. \"How will they receive me, a Trojan captive?\" Teucer starts to speak, then stops. He can say he will speak for her, that he will defend her. But when Telamon's fury bursts out against him, it will do no good for him to speak for anyone else. \"Telamon has always treated my mother well. He raised me as his own son, though I wasn't born from his wife. I do not think he will be harsh to you.\" Tecmessa's expression grows resigned. \"Whether he treats me well or ill,\" she says, \"this fate was in store for me from the time when I was made captive and allotted to Ajax as a prize of valor. My family is gone, and Troy has fallen. My son and I have no other refuge.\" Her hands tighten on her son's shoulders. \"No one will harm Eurysaces,\" Teucer says with more certainty. \"I will stand between him and danger until we reach Salamis, and then his grandfather will have charge of him.\" Tecmessa is silent for a moment. \"I heard some of the sailors talking earlier,\" she says carefully. \"They said that the Greek kings in the assembly have condemned Astyanax son of Hector to death.\" Teucer hasn't heard it, but he can no longer be surprised. \"A cruel deed,\" he says brusquely, \"to kill a child.\" \"You have heard nothing of this? It is said they mean to fling him from the walls of Troy.\" Teucer shakes his head. \"If that's what they've decided, I won't be able to stop it. The sons of Atreus hold no love for me.\" Tecmessa hesitates. \"I don't ask you to stop it,\" she says after a moment. \"But will you find out at least whether they mean to grant him proper burial?\" Teucer wants to retort indignantly that of course they will, but honesty holds him back. \"I will find out.\" She dips her head. \"Thank you.\" Of all the people Teucer could meet as he goes through the camp, it would have to be Odysseus. Teucer turns away, hoping not to be seen, but Odysseus calls a greeting. Teucer stops reluctantly and greets him in return. \"Hail, son of Laertes.\" \"Are you looking for someone, son of peerless Telamon? Or are you seeking news?\" \"Yes,\" Teucer says reluctantly. \"I heard that Hector's son--\" \"Cruel, but a necessity,\" Odysseus says slowly. \"His death has been carried out, as the sons of Atreus commanded.\" Teucer doesn't want to hear how Odysseus will justify the death of a child. \"And his burial--if there is anyone left at Troy to bury him?\" Odysseus nods sagely. \"I understand why you wish to ask about it. After all, the boy is your kin.\" Teucer stiffens. \"My kin? The boy belongs to the royal house of Troy. It has nothing to do with me.\" Odysseus smiles a little but doesn't dispute the point. \"The boy's body has been returned to the old queen, Hecuba. She and the Trojan women who have not yet been taken to the ships will bury him. At Andromache's request, young Pyrrhus gave them Hector's famed shield to bury him with.\" Teucer gives a jerky nod. \"Then I have nothing more to ask.\" He turns away. He cannot help picturing a child's body, cradled in Hector's bronze shield. He has seen that shield in battle often enough, flashing across the battlefield, and felt cold dread run through his veins at the sound of Hector's war-cry. But Hector will never lift that shield again. Troy's very walls will be pulled down to the ground. Perhaps he should feel victorious, but he only feels tired and a little sick. He remembers, too, another child held in the cradle of a mighty shield. \"Come, brother,\" Ajax said with his booming laugh. \"It is time for you to meet my son.\" Teucer allowed Ajax to pull him along and ducked into the tent after him. Tecmessa, Ajax's prize of war, was within; she cradled a small bundle in her arms, rocking it back and forth, while she sang a soft melody. The song was peaceful, strangely incongruous in a camp of war, but something about it warmed Teucer's heart. Ajax stepped forward toward Tecmessa. \"Give me the boy for a moment.\" Teucer thought there was a flash of apprehension in her eyes. She silently handed him the child. He was so tiny, Teucer marvelled. Seeing the infant held in Ajax's great hands, Teucer felt a sense of wonder and a growing protectiveness. He swore to himself that he would protect this child, next after Ajax, and keep any harm from coming to him. \"What name will you give him?\" Ajax laughed again. He unslung the shield from his back and placed it on the ground, then placed the baby in its hollow as in a cradle. \"Eurysaces,\" he said. \"It means 'broad shield.' And let this shield be his heritage. One day he will carry it after me.\" Teucer could not help smiling, seeing the child wave his small arms and legs in that warlike cradle. \"He's a bit small for it, don't you think?\" \"He'll grow,\" Ajax said confidently. He scooped up the baby again and handed him back to Tecmessa, who took the child in silence and held him to her chest protectively. Her head was bowed. \"Lady,\" Teucer said awkwardly. Tecmessa looked up in surprise. He continued, \"The song you were singing just now--what was it?\" \"Only a lullaby,\" Tecmessa murmured. \"In Troy, mothers and nurses often sing it to their children, from slave women to the palace of King Priam himself.\" She hesitated. \"Do you know it?\" Teucer gave a quick shrug of his shoulders. \"I thought I had heard it before,\" he said. \"But I may have been mistaken.\" Tecmessa looked at him for a moment; he thought she was weighing him somehow. \"Would you like to hold the child?\" she asked tentatively. Teucer began to demur, but Ajax pushed him forward. \"Go on,\" Ajax said. \"You won't break him.\" Before he quite knew how it happened, Teucer was looking down at the child in his arms. \"Hail, son of my brother,\" he said seriously. Eurysaces blinked at him. In spite of Ajax's words, the child seemed very fragile. Teucer handed him back to Tecmessa with a sense of relief. Teucer and Ajax left the tent together. \"She pleases me well enough,\" Ajax said carelessly. \"And now she has given me a son. I'll bring her back to Salamis with me after we sack Troy.\" Now Troy has been vanquished, and the boy still thrives, but Ajax isn't here to see it. It's hard not to blame Odysseus for that. Odysseus inclines his head gravely, as if he can guess what Teucer is thinking. \"I hold no grudge against your brother,\" he says. \"And I hope that he too has forgiven me, among the dead.\" He will not forgive you, Teucer thinks. Not even in the house of Hades. Aloud he says only, \"I desire no quarrel with you. The past is past.\" It's as gracious as he can manage. He turns away. Odysseus's tent is in the middle, almost the exact center of the line. He always did like to be in the middle of everything, whether it was properly his business or not. Teucer doesn't mind the walk back to his own camp; it gives his temper time to cool. Ajax's encampment is at one end. In the battle line too, the most dangerous place is on the end, where no one else's shield or spear protects your unguarded side. The Greek ships are stretched along the shore in a long line. Trusting in his strength, Ajax didn't hesitate to claim one end, defending one flank of the Greek encampment. (It was Achilles who claimed the other.) Ajax has always preferred to rely on himself. Teucer remembers a hot and dusty day on the plains before Troy; the two armies, Greek and Trojan, lined up facing each other. They fought for hours, with neither side able to gain the advantage. \"Stand firm now,\" a voice called from behind them. Teucer recognized the voice of Alastor, one of their companions from Salamis. \"Go forward boldly, and strike the Trojans! I think they will soon give ground.\" A hand touched his shoulder, and Teucer felt his exhaustion fade away. He felt as fresh and eager as if he'd just risen from a full night's rest, his heart filled with confidence. Teucer turned, and looked into the eyes of someone who was not Alastor. Bright grey eyes shone from beneath the helmet, their glance clear and deadly as sunlight flashing from a spear-point. On the breastplate, the image of a woman's face was fixed in a silent scream, surrounded by coils of snaky hair that shifted and twisted before his eyes. Teucer swallowed. He bowed his head respectfully, and looked at Ajax to see if he had seen it also. Ajax's eyes were still fixed on the enemy. \"Goddess, go the other Greeks,\" he said brusquely. \"The line will never falter here, where Ajax is.\" Teucer saw her eyes narrow. She turned away from them and vanished between one breath and the next. But it was true, Teucer thought loyally, fighting off unease. If anyone could hold his ground without the gods' help, surely it was Ajax. Perhaps if Ajax had taken more care to honor the gods, they wouldn't have afflicted him with the madness that darkened his spirit. But Teucer can't truly blame him. He too looked to Ajax, a nearer and more trusty protector than the gods on Mount Olympus. In his eyes, Ajax always seemed like an unconquerable tower, his shield as sure a protection as the aegis of Athena. How many times did Teucer take refuge behind that shield? How often did the two of them go into battle together, Teucer stepping out to shoot deadly arrows at the Trojans, then ducking back behind Ajax's shield? The two of them relying on each other, trusting each other. That day they stood on the wall together to defend the ships against Hector's fierce onslaught. Teucer shot again and again at Hector, but the swift shafts were turned aside by Hector's shield. (Hector's shield, that now cradles Hector's son in the cold earth.) Hector hurled a huge rock in return, that knocked Teucer to the ground and broke his bowstring. He lay there with the breath knocked out of him, his cheek against the ground; dizzy, half-unconscious, but not afraid, because Ajax's shield was over him, protecting him until his companions could reach him and carry him to safety. Teucer has reached his own camp now. He sighs and rests a hand against one of the black ships. Why should he be troubled by Odysseus's words, that he is kin to the royal house of Troy? It's not the first time he's heard something like that, and he's surely immune to the taunts by now. It stung more when he was younger, less sure of his place. There was a group of boys playing together on a beach at Salamis, rather than this beach at Troy. He doesn't remember exactly what set it off; boys, like grown warriors, can quarrel for any reason or none once their pride is injured. Somehow, they decided that Teucer couldn't join them. One of the boys pointed at Teucer. \"You're a Trojan! Herakles fought the Trojans, and that means we have to fight you.\" \"I am not!\" Teucer protested. \"You are! You don't even speak right, you talk like a barbarian.\" \"No, I don't,\" he insisted. A hard shove from one of the boys made Teucer stumble. He clenched his fists, but before he could strike, Ajax's protective shadow was over him. \"What are you doing?\" They looked at each other and then at the ground. \"We want to play Herakles at Troy,\" one of them muttered. \"Then I'll be Herakles,\" Ajax said. No one looked as if they wanted to dispute the honor with him. \"And Teucer can be Telamon.\" He slung his arm around Teucer's shoulders. \"My father was Herakles's friend back then. He helped Herakles fight the Trojans after the Trojan king lied to him, and Herakles gave him a Trojan princess as a prize for his valor.\" \"If he's Telamon, then who are the Trojans?\" Ajax shrugged. \"Whoever wants to fight me.\" \"But you're stronger than all of us,\" the boy muttered. \"It's not fair.\" \"Fine,\" Ajax said. \"The rest of you can be the Trojans, and I'll fight you with just Teucer. Get some sticks, we'll use them for spears.\" In the end, they played at rescuing the princess from the sea monster, and then Herakles's quarrel with the Trojan king Laomedon. The boy playing Laomedon tried to justify himself in his best rhetoric learned from their tutor. Teucer thought his words sounded well, considering the speech was improvised. But Ajax had never had much patience for long speeches. He turned to Teucer and grinned at him. \"Help me sack Troy!\" \"Yes!\" Teucer said at once. He gripped his \"spear\" more tightly in his hand and ran forward, at Ajax's side. Help me sack Troy... Teucer gives a choked laugh. The Greeks won the victory, but they've been here for ten years. His memories of Salamis, of his parents, have begun to fade. Will Salamis truly be home, without his brother? He looks out to sea. The sun is setting, painting the waves in red and gold. What if Telamon does exile him, he thinks defiantly. The sea touches other shores, other lands besides Salamis. And he will not go forth alone, like a beggar. His name is well-known. His companions here, the spearmen and sailors who Ajax led from Salamis--they have fought beside Teucer for years now, and since Ajax's death they have followed him. He thinks some of them would go with him, even into exile. The ships are ready; the sailors have examined them carefully and repaired any damage. They are still stout and whole, these ships that Ajax defended, that Hector failed to burn. For one more night, their keels will rest on the beach at Troy. Tomorrow they will set sail again on the vast sea.",

      "Troy's very walls will be pulled down to the ground.",
      "Perhaps he should feel victorious, but he only feels tired and a little sick.",

      "Teucer allowed Ajax to pull him along and ducked into the tent after him.",
      "Tecmessa, Ajax's prize of war, was within; she cradled a small bundle in her arms, rocking it back and forth, while she sang a soft melody.",
      "The song was peaceful, strangely incongruous in a camp of war, but something about it warmed Teucer's heart.",
      "Ajax stepped forward toward Tecmessa.",
      "\"Give me the boy for a moment.\"",
      "Teucer thought there was a flash of apprehension in her eyes.",

      "He unslung the shield from his back and placed it on the ground, then placed the baby in its hollow as in a cradle.",
      "\"Eurysaces,\" he said.",

      "\"He's a bit small for it, don't you think?\"",
      "\"He'll grow,\" Ajax said confidently.",
      "He scooped up the baby again and handed him back to Tecmessa, who took the child in silence and held him to her chest protectively.",
      "Her head was bowed.",

      "He continued, \"The song you were singing just now--what was it?\"",
      "\"Only a lullaby,\" Tecmessa murmured.",

      "She hesitated.",
      "\"Do you know it?\"",

      "\"My father was Herakles's friend back then.",
      "He helped Herakles fight the Trojans after the Trojan king lied to him, and Herakles gave him a Trojan princess as a prize for his valor.\"",
      "\"If he's Telamon, then who are the Trojans?\" Ajax shrugged.",
      "\"Whoever wants to fight me.\"",
      "\"But you're stronger than all of us,\" the boy muttered.",
      "\"It's not fair.\"",
      "\"Fine,\" Ajax said.",
      "\"The rest of you can be the Trojans, and I'll fight you with just Teucer.",
      "Get some sticks, we'll use them for spears.\"",
      "In the end, they played at rescuing the princess from the sea monster, and then Herakles's quarrel with the Trojan king Laomedon.",
      "The boy playing Laomedon tried to justify himself in his best rhetoric learned from their tutor.",
      "Teucer thought his words sounded well, considering the speech was improvised.",
      "But Ajax had never had much patience for long speeches.",

      "His memories of Salamis, of his parents, have begun to fade.",
      "Will Salamis truly be home, without his brother?",
      "He looks out to sea.",
      "The sun is setting, painting the waves in red and gold.",
      "What if Telamon does exile him, he thinks defiantly.",
      "The sea touches other shores, other lands besides Salamis.",
      "And he will not go forth alone, like a beggar.",
      "His name is well-known.",
      "His companions here, the spearmen and sailors who Ajax led from Salamis--they have fought beside Teucer for years now, and since Ajax's death they have followed him.",
      "He thinks some of them would go with him, even into exile.",
      "The ships are ready; the sailors have examined them carefully and repaired any damage.",
      "They are still stout and whole, these ships that Ajax defended, that Hector failed to burn.",
      "For one more night, their keels will rest on the beach at Troy.",
      "Tomorrow they will set sail again on the vast sea."

    "text": "He had not wanted to come to the wild one's home, but duty called. Hades entered into her domain stealthily, wary to not be caught by the summerchild. Word had come to him of her feral ways, even in the depths of his underworld. They said she was as merciless as Artemis when it came to men who encroached upon her domain, and he had no desire to have an arrow planted anywhere in his body for simply doing his duty. His sister had let the child go on too long with her juvenile war-games. Perhaps Demeter enjoyed them, but the rumor was Zeus himself had tired of her penchant for casual mischief. Whispers had reached Hades in the underground that Zeus had even tried to marry the girl off. At first, he'd tried to parade her to the other Gods of Olympus. Not Hades himself, of course. Zeus knew even an unwilling daughter of Olympus was still a powerful thing, and it was preferable to see his feral hellcat married within his circle, rather than let her go down to Hades' or Poseidon's realm. Their alliance of the three realms was savage-won but delicately-held. He had been the eldest first, and neither he nor Zeus had forgotten that. When Zeus' own sons and the sons of lesser Gods had declined, Zeus had offered his wayward daughter to the world of men, or at least men of a certain stock--royals and other high-born folks. When they declined, he had seemingly washed his hands of his wayward child and left her on the mortal plain, rather than see the girl pulled down to Hades. It was a slight, and a damnable one, but Hades could not find in himself the capacity to care. It had only saved him the time it would have taken to refuse the offer. He had not taken a god or goddess to mate in the millenniums he had held his rule and held little desire to; the best he could say for the miserable lot of his brothers, sisters, and their innumerable whelps was that they were all dull, boring fiends, all jockeying for power in a golden city he could never enter. Except for Demeter and her summer child, of course. They had carved out a place in the mortal world, though he knew not why or how they had decided to make this place their earthly home. Perhaps her father had ordered Demeter's little hellion cast out, though he doubted it; he had not known his brother to be so hard-hearted. He bent down low through thick and thorny woods, hunting for the dying presence that called to him. The presence had been insistent for a while; prayers to him were always urgent, but this one had been hammering his head like a hissing kettle for the entirety of his morning judgments. If the Fates were kind, they would not lead him to Demeter's girl, but rather the being that was in need of his services. He closed his eyes and tried to concentrate on the presence; the sooner the spirit was dealt with, the sooner he could leave and return to his quiet home. \"Is anyone there? It's so dark and cold. Why won't anyone help me?\" He winced as the spirit's thoughts hissed into his mind; the worst of the dead were the ones who couldn't tell they were. It would require explanations, and explanations took time, and the longer he remained, the more surely Demeter's child would set a target upon him, and he had no desire for the child's play. He held out his hands in front of him, using his realm-powers to phase into the shadow realm that flitted between the world above and his world below. It would help him remain unnoticed should humans dare to cross the wildling's forest, though he knew it would not fool a single god or goddess who came upon him. He passed as a shadow through the forest, gliding toward the presence until he came upon a clearing. It was quiet, which disturbed him, and had no area for hiding, which disturbed him more. It was too obviously a God's sacred grove: silent and still, as the underworld was for him. And naturally, the spirit was here in another God's glen, though he could not quite see it yet. He advanced forward. At the center of the meadow was a magnificent garden. Even he, who had no interest in the vine or the flower, had to admit it was glorious, full of plants beyond his ability to name. He doubted even the humans had names for them all, though their kind had spent a great deal of their centuries above ground attempting to catalogue them. Next to the garden, several trees sprouted varieties that under any other person's care would be impossible to raise together and yet here they were: apples and pomegranates, cacti and oranges and mulberries, all growing in the same soil. Purple vines and vividly pink flowers danced among more common earthly variants, and in the center of it all, his spirit sat, curled deeply in a thorny vine. A dryad, he thought, though he had never seen a tree nymph as wretched as this pitiful creature. Its spectral body was naked, with light silver shadow-skin glistening; it hair was wild, matted. The hair obscured its nudity, but he could see through peaks of the disheveled curtain of hair that the ribs of the thing were thin enough to see the bones. He cast a quick glance around; there was no temple in the clearing, as one would expect, but there was a campfire off to the side, or at least the ruins of one. Folded neatly in a plain, unassuming canvas tent were two large blankets, rich in Olympian wool; he also spied the remains of a campfire, but little else. The embers of the fire had long since gone cold, and there was no wood stockpiled nearby. Perhaps the little goblin and her over-doting mother had abandoned the camp; it would be just like Olympians to be wasteful and leave their belongings behind. Even if they planned to return, well...neither the goblin nor her mother were here now, and that was a gift in and of itself. Hades had learned, long ago, not to waste precious gifts when given. He snapped his fingers, transitioning fully back into the mortal world and revealing himself for what he was. \"Oh!\" The shade cried out in the wailing-song he was so used to hearing. \"Oh no! Not the unseen one! It can't be you! I am not...\" The shade of the dryad looked down at its ghostly hands, then back at him, pitiful wetness in its eyes. Shades could not cry, but he could see in its face how badly it wanted to. \"It is I.\" He opened his hand in welcome, but the shade scurried away. He sighed and bent down, squatting toward it in hopes of calming it quickly. This would not be an easy one, and he was too short on time to be kind, not that kindness was ever truly in his nature. \"And I am afraid you have, little tree.\" \"I'm a nymph,\" it hissed; not a bright one, he thought, to backtalk to a God, especially the Final God. \"And I'm perfectly alive, you see?\" It shoved a hand toward him, and his lips curled in distaste as it passed through his shoulder entirely. The sensation was odd, shadow-cold on living muscle, and he liked it not at all. The shade wailed as it passed through him, and Hades heart curdled. Enough of this nonsense. \"I'm afraid I've no more time to waste on your pitiful denials,\" he said, grabbing the shade's arm and forcibly removing it from his person. He concentrated his power into his fingertips, letting his shadow-senses gather; he would send her to his realm's shores, and deal with her nonsense there. Let her annoy Charon until he finished his rounds collecting the dead. \"But how could I have --?\" The nymph hissed, and then she was gone, pulled below. Hades sighed. He did not know how the strange nymph had managed to get killed - perhaps the savage child had burned the tree. Perhaps its wood had simply fallen to neglect; other than this garden, it wasn't as if this wild land was much maintained. Indeed, he suspected the little wildling or her mother had cast some sort of spell to keep this place from mortal eyes, for there were no noise here, not even the cawing of birds he had gotten used to when he'd come a-calling for the souls stuck in the more isolated locations of the mortal world. He started to stand, brushing dirt from his knees. It wasn't the best reaping he'd ever done but he'd finish the job of judging the poor nymph's immortal soul when he returned. He had at least avoided Demeter's goblin child, he thought. His hand brushed a bloom near the vine that had ensnared the shade and he paused for a precious second, staring at it. A multi-headed floral beast, with soft pink cream petals with silver splashes of metallic light that were beautiful, beyond the telling of anything he might have to decorate his home. He reached out before he could stop himself, let a finger touch one delicate, velvet petal. Gorgeous. He stared a precious second too long before coming back to his senses, remembering where he was. Best not to tarry. He was just about to return to his shadow-form when he heard the ever so slight sound of an arrow being notched. In the silence, it echoed. He sighed. Not so lucky after all. \"Daughter of Demeter,\" he said, holding out his hands in a gesture of peace. \"I bid you no ill.\" The only response was a quickly launched arrow; he turned to shadow and it passed through his head, as slippery as a fish through water. His mouth drew into a thin line of distaste. He was getting quite tired of having things stuck through him today. He turned slowly back to his normal form, only to blink in surprise at the vision before him. He had heard Demeter's daughter referred to as a child, and the dress she wore did indeed hold a ragged hem at the knees, as was tradition among their kind, once. It was a chiton, too; he blinked in surprise--no one had worn one of those outside of Olympus in a good several centuries. But other than that her dress, the description of her was quite inaccurate: there was nothing child-like about her. Her body was supple, obviously well into the bloom of womanhood with pleasingly wide hips and shoulders. She was certainly as capable as Artemis in wielding her bow, with her mouth just as stubbornly set for war as Athena. Her hair was wild, a dark brown-black set of dense curls that flowed over her tawny shoulders in thick waves with bits of vine forming a headband to keep her coarse tresses from interfering with her shot. She was barefoot, but her short, thick legs made him certain she could outrun him. Especially in the suit he had worn, intending to blend in with the humans while he was conducting his collection of the dead. She was, he thought, achingly beautiful, for what Thanatos had so disdainfully called a goblin. Goblinchild, indeed; whoever Thanatos had gotten the information was either woefully out of date, or he had been misinformed. Neither was a good omen for this meeting. Nor was the young one's face, full of stern fury. \"Who are you?\" She asked; her head tilted forward in obvious wary pride. \"You are clearly theoi. Are you another of my father's suitors? I had thought it bad enough he offered me as a whore to the sea God. What does he send before me now, the God of vapor? Perhaps a God of whistling wind? Tell me, little god, how far have I fallen in my father's affections, that you have come for me?\" \"I am no paltry parlor-trick god.\" His lip curled in derision; so, Zeus did favor Poseidon over him. An annoyance, that, if unsurprising. They had always shared certain...traits. But that was not important now; it was time to set the child straight, so she could send him on his way. \"You speak to the third estate child, the lord of darkness himself, the God of all mortals. I am death itself, and I've not come to your sacred grove for anything beyond my duty.\" She stared at him for a moment, head tilted. He nodded self-consciously, expecting her to give him his leave. Every God turned from him once they were aware of what he was; death always made the deathless uncomfortable. Even his siblings had not been immune from that discomfort. But the goblin woman - for she was not a child, decidedly not a child - did something quite unexpected instead. She threw her head back and laughed. \"Your duty, uncle? I will give you this, your approach is unique. The others promised words of love and dowries. You have made it clear I am as important to you as mulch. I almost appreciate your honesty, though I am still insulted.\" He felt a flash of color pinken his cheeks. Barbaric woman! To think he had little better to do than to beg her father for a lackluster bride to drag to his bed, kicking and screaming. He would do nothing of the kind. \"I assure you, I have not come to beg for your mulch, as you say. I have come for a soul for my domain that happened to be tangled in these woods, nothing more. If you will allow me passage, I'll return to my cold realm and you may continue on rebelling against your lord father with my permission, little one.\" There was certainly little love lost between them now. Foolish of Zeus to play favorites, given their positions; Hades held a larger share than Poseidon ever would. She walked toward him with fluid grace; he swallowed involuntarily as her fingers lightly touched his chin. He said nothing as she turned his head one way, then the other; the gaze in her eyes was almost objectifying, and he was unused to such scrutiny. Was this the way lesser gods greeted their betters on Olympus now? He squirmed under the touch. Her eyes seemed to miss nothing, and when she took another step closer and brushed up against him, he took a step back. \"Why, I don't know why my father is so scared of you.\" She smiled, but there was nothing joking about it; the curve of her lips was cruel, and he knew her for Zeus' daughter then and there. \"You're only an old man.\" \"I suppose I am,\" he said, shrugging. He had been used to barbs enough from his brothers and sisters during the war, when they jostled for positions and glory. He had not cared then, and he certainly did not care now as to what this wild-woman thought of him. \"No protest? Hm.\" Her eyes flashed. \"It's very odd. You have the reputation of a powerful warrior, but...You seem as courageous as a dormouse.\" \"I had enough fighting in the war.\" He wearily shoved a hand past her, putting distance between them as he started to walk away. He was tired of her; if anything, it was only disappointing that she, too, seemed so focused on meaningless squabbling. He had hoped, perhaps, that she would appreciate the mortal realm as he did; that she, too, might spurn Olympus and all its wretched excess. He felt something on his ankle and tripped; the ignominious wretch! Biting back a curse, he gathered his power into his hands. If she was going to trip him, he would simply go south through the core as a shadow and arrive home that way. His hands pulsed and he felt himself begin to slip into his realm, but then the glow faded from him and he bit back a curse as he simply fell to the earth instead of through it. His mouth slammed into the dirt and he was too stunned to move. How had that happened? He felt himself dragged backward quickly, turned upside down before he could as much as blink. He glanced up and found a vine climbing quickly up his legs. So she had Demeter's gift after all, it seemed. The one gift able to repel his own, naturally. This time he did not hold back on the cursing. \"My my,\" she said, smiling. \"Uncle, to think you'd have such a tongue on you.\" \"Unhand me!\" He shouted with the full authority of his office, but she only smiled. He tried to glare balefully at her, but a glance up reminded him exactly of how short her chiton was, and for propriety's sake alone, he was forced to look away. \"Oh do swear again, that was wonderfully fun. Did you shout such in the war? Make the Titans all run away?\" She waved her fingers and the vines climbed; a pair split, neatly placing his broad hands in cuffs before he could even jerk away. \"Niece!\" He gripped at the vine, scowling; if the girl refused to stop being ridiculous, he would simply free himself. He did not need his powers to do so; he reached up to grab the vine and attempted to pull his arms apart. The vine grew in response, monstrously quick; one punctured his wrist and he stopped. \"Ah, I wouldn't do that.\" She knelt down, her face close enough to his own he could feel the heat of her breath on his chin. \"The pricks are poisonous when full grown, uncle. You'll induce a terrible fever ripping yourself free, if you even can.\" \"On what grounds do you hold me, child?\" He hissed; he tried to twist from side to side to wiggle free but the needle-welts embedded in his wrists only dug in further. He wondered how long it would take for the poison to take effect, assuming she wasn't bluffing. \"One, you interest me.\" She shrugged her shoulders. \"That's rare enough. Two, I figure you'll be a warning to any suitors that I'm not worth attempting to buy, since father is clearly getting desperate if he is offering his own daughter as a mere concubine to you. Three, you trampled my flower, so I'm well within my rights to demand recompense.\" \"Recompense?\" He sputtered; he looked toward the flower he had brushed against earlier and saw it had been smeared into the dirt when he'd stepped back; he sighed. That was unfortunate. \"Surely we can work out financial compensation-- \" \"Nope.\" She flicked her fingers, throwing him toward the tent, and he grimaced as he landed, hard, on a verifiable pile of brambles and vines. \"You're mine--for the moment, at least, Mr. Third-Estate.\" He gasped aloud; the pain of the punctures in his skin was minuscule, but the indignity of it all burned deep. Through great difficulty, he managed to glare at her. \"Stop this,\" he snarled; she shook her head, then turned her back on him, bending to the flower he had accidentally trampled in haste. He watched her wide hips as she bent down; the skirt on that chiton was distractingly short, he thought. That thought, however, was swallowed all too quickly in his outrage as he watched her hands gently touch the flower and instantly restore it to health. His blood pounded in his ears. \"For fuck's sake!\" \"Now, now.\" She walked back over to him and knelt beside him, putting her hands gently on his shoulders; her power flowed through him, healing his cuts and he gasped as her sweet life-current worked its magic. He opened his mouth, but no words fell out; how many years had it been since he'd been touched by anyone but ghosts desperately fighting not to be sent beyond? How long since he had felt even half so potent a current of power as this? He had forgotten what the touch of his own kind felt like. His heartbeat started to pound in alarm, and he wasn't entirely sure it was because of the poison she'd spoken of. \"You should be glad I am keeping you. You might be king of the stiffs, but you're the most entertaining company I've had in a long while.\" He felt another flood of heat flush through his face but for once, the leader of the third estate was silent. He did not move, awash in the sensation of being held by her hands. She squeezed his shoulders; his heart twisted in desire for her life-touch. She was, he had to admit, not entirely a horrible goblin. Still, he craved his freedom. \"What would your mother say if she saw you holding me like this?\" He asked, trying another tack. She smiled. \"She'd think you were going to carry me off to the underworld, you brute, and I'd managed to just barely defend myself by trussing you up like a Saturnalian boar.\" \"You forget I know your mother, and she knows I'm not capable of such a thing.\" He had gotten along well enough with Demeter, the last time he'd talked to her. Which was...he tried to remember. Certainly, Demeter had never visited his home below, and he had not seen her since she had had Persephone. He tried to remember how long ago that had been. Clearly, given her adulthood, it had been a while. He had not accompanied Persephone's birthing, for which he could hardly be blamed--his powers were never welcome near a birthing bed, though he'd collected many a mother and child in such circumstances. The last time he saw Demeter must have during the war, then but--for all their infighting, they had been close enough then, the six of them. Persephone's face blushed red, fury nakedly evident in those doe-eyes, and he rejoiced for a moment despite his predicament. He had called the woman on her cheeky lies. He would only have to wait for Demeter to arrive, and she would surely stop her hellion from doing further harm to a brother she had liked. \"My mother was raped by one of her brothers and abandoned by the other,\" the girl spat. \"Frankly, I doubt my mother would be surprised to hear of you resorting to the same.\" \"I....\" Hades' mind spun, trying to process this unexpected news. Clearly, the information he was gleaning was, at best, incomplete. He thought of his sister and felt shame; he had all but abandoned his sisters to his brothers, assuming their safety would be assured. He had assumed wrong, it seemed, and the knowledge that he had been so sure in his assumption that he had never even asked Demeter if she was alright chafed at him; she had been rude to him, sure, had spurned him even, perhaps... but as the eldest, he had his duties to care for his younger siblings and he had been negligent in them. \"I am not my brothers,\" he said, voice soft, but knew his denial sounded weak. \"It is not only your brothers,\" she hissed. \"Apollo and Hermes are much the same, always pleading love but losing interest as soon as they've stuck themselves deep. And did not your own dear father punish your mother for bearing his children? Did not your grandfather shove any troubles he had into dear grandmother Gaea? It is in your kind, sir. Gods are all cruel.\" \"Not I,\" he insisted, but she shook her head and stood. She seemed quite content to keep him trussed, and he wondered how long it would be until she would untie him. \"Please, let me go home to my land. I am a king and cannot long be parted from my realm.\" \"I do not think they will miss you so much. No one misses death.\" She smiled and patted him on his head in an almost condescending manner. Before he could complain, she silenced him by tracing her fingertips down his ear to his chin. He could not help but feel the warmth of her hand and found himself damningly eager to lean into it. He frowned; he could not remember being so affected by a simple stroke of a hand, but then, when was the last time someone had touched him in anything other than fear? \"I'll be back,\" she murmured; her hand stroked down his neck and he did not miss the way her eyes glimmered with interest when she brushed against the edge of his throat. \"Where are you going?\" He asked, grimacing at the huskiness in his tone; it was entirely the wrong sort of reaction, and he couldn't figure why, exactly, he was having it for this woman. She was pleasing to the eye, sure, but it wasn't as if she had treated him as anything beyond, well, mulch. \"Well, for one, to kiss my lady mother goodnight. Three's a crowd.\" She did not wait for his response to that, cackling wildly. \"Also, to ask her for the antidote to the poison you've just injected yourself within your struggling, uncle. And I should think you would like some supper. I know I would.\" She waved as she took off, flowers trailing from her swinging hips - no he would not focus on those hips, comely though they were. She disappeared rapidly into the deep woods that led the path back to the underworld - and to Mount Olympus, too. He sighed, twitching in his seat. He could only imagine Charon's roaring laughter if the boatman could see him now. And the poor nymph! Now the dryad would be waiting even longer; perhaps it would give her time to accept her fate. He grunted, trying again to slip the bonds by slipping back to shadow, but the wildling's vines held fast. So long as he was being held by a god of who could control life, it appeared he wouldn't be able to return to the land of the dead. His powers were, quite neatly, useless. He could perhaps slip through his restraints if he managed to destroy the vine, but if he tore the vine in twain, he'd puncture himself a thousand times more than he already had. Time would tell if the wild one's claim that the vine was poisonous was a bluff. He stared up into the sunlight, wondering if Zeus was laughing his ass off at him from on high. He had thought if he was captured by an enemy, his brother would strain to help him, but now he could see all too clearly that help was not forthcoming from Olympus. He frowned, wondering how long she would be. He had little he could do but wait, it seemed. He tried to wriggle against the vines on his legs, but she had not slackened the vines' hold at all; he would surely be sore if she was gone long, but...nothing to be done, he supposed. He closed his eyes and waited. Time passed, though he was not aware of how much. It could have been hours; it could have been days--his kind needed little food, and he took no rest. All he knew was that he was miserable. Slowly, the poison's effect came into bloom; it started as little more than a sudden, scratchy heat on his skin. At first, he thought it merely the long exposure as Helios' chariot made its way across the sky, but no; even as the sun dipped into the horizon, his skin felt as if he was on fire. He groaned as sweat started to drip from his face onto his suit jacket; he couldn't even wipe it off, not being trussed like this. He watched the shadow of the sun as it set, using a tree in the distance as an impromptu sundial. He thought of yelling out, but there was little point in it; the island was still damnable silent, and all he could hear was the lap of waves distantly upon a shore. No birds, no animals. Nothing but the quiet of the glen. Nothing but his own thoughts to keep him company. He shivered, despite the heat piercing through his body, burning as if Helios' himself has set his hand--well, never mind where. Hades gasped, breath ragged, wondering what that thought came from. It wasn't as if he'd ever had any interest in that bright braggart. Or anyone else, he thought; he wished he could tug at his collar, because suddenly his clothing felt a lot more confining...oh. Wonderful. He stared into the vines tangling around his wrists, trying to guess at what the species was to have such a potent effect on a deathless one. Demeter had offered him lessons in identifying flora during their childhood, but he had always been too busy trying to keep them all alive to take her up on it. Foolish; he could not name it. He tried to wiggle his toes and didn't miss the sudden fission of heat that seemed to travel straight to his cock. Why, he was even half-turgid already, all just from the awareness of his own body. When had that last happened? He was long past such sudden stirrings at his age. He laughed, officially so far gone he was now amused by how far he'd fallen. To think if Demeter's daughter could see him now. The thought of her led to another surge in his cock and he sighed. She was a good looking thing, no denying that, especially in this frame of mind. The wide splay of her hips, the gold flecks of her eyes...he grunted. It was almost a good thing he was tied up; he doubted he could resist staring up her chiton now. Hmph. He smiled; this was ironic. She'd accused his kind of being little more than rutting beasts and now he could think of little else than fucking her. He tried to think of other things as the light dimmed once more, but the hellion kept popping into his thoughts. What would she be like, he wondered? His skin itched as feverish dreams played through his mind. He wondered if she would prefer to be on top; he would let her, right now, his status be damned. Let the wild one take her pleasure from him, he would give it willingly. Even bound like this, if she wanted it. She hadn't entwined one of her many vines over his cock after all, and those lithe, quick fingers could surely undo his pants as fast as she could notch her bow. He moaned and shook his head, tried to concentrate on the tree ahead of him, but the thoughts quickly turned to Demeter's daughter and how it might feel to have her against that tree; had she even known the touch of a man? Would she let him have her, wrap those wide legs around him as he thrust her into the trunk? She was certainly old enough to have experienced her first flowering, but then again, she'd rejected no end of suitors...which made the thought that she'd even entertain him even more ridiculous. But then, she had touched him, even after knowing what he was. And her fingertips were so light and so, so...fates above, stop it. He was the oldest of his brothers, and lusting in a way that would make Zeus ashamed. A new low point in his life, which had mostly been low points, if he was being honest. She would hold little interest in a man as old as he was. But then again, she had touched him, had even smiled at him... and what would such a smile look like on her, if she was clad only in all her naked glory? A right wicked smile it would be, he'd bet. What would those lips look like, if she used them on him? He tried to imagine kissing them swollen, but the thoughts all too quickly took a turn south, with her imaginary lips blazing a trail to the miserably hard head of his cock. The tension in him was becoming almost unbearable; he was iron hard now, erection straining at the seams, and he would take the little one's laughing if it meant that she'd let his hands go free enough to at least touch his cock. \"Uncle!\" He heard, and grimaced; stars above, was it too much to hope the accursed poison would run through his system before she got back? He folded his cuffed hands awkwardly over his erection and tried to focus on his niece's words as she bounced back over to him, and not the soft smile that rounded the wildling's lips. Fates, they were the plumpest things, those lips, so soft he could not resist leaning forward toward her, yearning for a kiss....what was he thinking? He jerked his neck back quickly, no doubt looking the fool, but he didn't care. This was ridiculous. \"Looks like you're in a bit of a rough patch,\" she said, surprisingly gently. Her voice was a little husky, and something in his stomach flipped in ridiculous hope. Her surprisingly warm hand touched his head and he winced. He no doubt felt disgusting and beyond that, her touch sent even more fire through his veins, and it was already going to a place that was already far too aflame for his liking. His hips bucked on instinct at the touch, desperate to mate her. Fates, he could do it, could have her. She was so close... \"Anti...dote?\" He asked, whimpering at his own weak voice. \"I've brought it. Though first...\" she dabbed at his skin with a soft cloth and he whimpered, quite sure if she dipped her fingers any lower than his neck that he would, in fact, be in such pain he could very well die despite being deathless. \"Let's get you cleaned up a bit. My, how you've been sweating, uncle. Is the afternoon sun so harsh in your strange clothing? I did think it odd.\" The fact that no one in the outside world had worn a chiton in centuries seemed lost on the girl, though he was too preoccupied to voice the thought as she ran the cloth over his chin, heading downwards... \"Don't.\" He shook his head vigorously. \"Please.\" \"Uncle, stop being such a child.\" She murmured, but her hand skimmed his chin as she withdrew. She seemed to enjoy touching him; that was decidedly not helping him in this ailment. She pulled something from her belt and he saw a small bottle filled with a sort of murky sap; he did not hesitate to part his lips as she brought it to his lips. \"I must say, I'm surprised to see my little vine affect you so. Is a bit of itching so much as to make you so miserable? How is it my father is so deathly afraid of you he bans us all from so much as broaching upon your door when you can't handle a harmless little scratch?\" He said nothing, only exhaling as sucked down the contents of the bottle. His pride had had enough injury for the day; he was desperate only now for the antidote before he did something they'd both regret. She tilted it back with a semi-bemused expression on her face, but he did not care; he swallowed every drop of the disgusting muddy sap. \"How long?\" He asked. \"Until the itching stops?\" She shrugged and ran her cloth over his mouth, wiping up the bits of sap that clung to the edges of his mouth. Her fingers lingered a bit longer on his lips than they should, and he moved his head slightly forwards. She seemed not to notice. \"Probably fifteen minutes, maybe twenty at most, uncle.\" \"And the rest?\" He panted; he cared not at all about a small bit of itching. That was livable. The desire to mate, however, was driving him mad. She was so beautiful, stars; those lips pursed and he thought of nothing but wanting to kiss them, to claim - \"The rest?\" She tilted her head, obviously confused. \"I'm afraid I don't understand.\" \"The....\" He tried to think of a way to speak of his ailment that wasn't sure to induce her mockery. Why did she insist on playing dumb? \"The other effects.\" \"Other?\" She stared at him a moment, lips pursed with curiosity that made him think of nothing as to what she could be doing with them. \"What other effects? Are you alright?\" Much to his alarm, she swung herself into his lap before he could explain. She held onto his face and frowned as she looked into his eyes and tried to find the discerning cause. The vines, he noticed dimly, moved out of her way, realigning themselves to restrain him without impeding her. His hands were pulled away from his paltry disguise, pulled down to the ground at his sides. He couldn't move, could do nothing to stop her as she conducted her investigation. He hissed as she leaned up against him - and her eyes widening suggested she found his - ah. The look in her eyes suggested surprise...but not disgust. \"Oh,\" she said; she wiggled against him in a way that sent every nerve throbbing and he saw stars. He tried to move his hands to push her away, but the accursed vine's binding held firm. She stared at him with wide, stunned eyes and he winced. He took back every one of his regrets he'd ever listed as the worst in his life; this had now surpassed them all. He bet Zeus had probably invited Poseidon over to his heavenly perch, and they were both watching him with eyes wet from laughing so hard at his expense. \"This poison...you see its effect, I trust,\" he murmured, and tried not to notice the spark of what looked close to intrigue in her eyes. She nodded slightly; her lips fell open slightly. Her hand grazed his chest with just the lightest of touches, and he watched with painfully transfixed attention as her tongue skimmed over the tip of her lips. \"Does it hurt?\" She asked, in a low voice that was almost husky. He raised an eyebrow, carefully looking at her: she was keeping herself pressed so tightly against him he could feel her pulse beating fast against her skin. And it was beating very, very fast indeed. \"Agony,\" he admitted; she rolled her hips again and he hissed as his skin burst into flame underneath her. For a moment, they stared at one another; he could not think of what to say to make this better, and the wilding seemed equally taken with silence. Then, quick as a lark, she took action: she grabbed his hair with an iron grip that would put his own to shame, and yanked his head forward into a painful kiss. He whimpered, unable to stop the needy noises coming out of his mouth as she claimed him. His hips thrust desperately against her damnably clothed hips as she held onto him like a vice; it hurt, stars above it hurt so much, the feel of her on his skin, bewitching and bedeviling. He wanted to hold her, but all he could do was kiss her, kiss as much of her as he could, and he feared that would not be enough to sate him. She seemed to be of the same ailment, furiously kissing him with every gasp of breath she uttered. She eased his mouth open into an open-mouthed kiss, demanding more. Her loving was viciously tender and he wanted every bit of it she would give him. Damn his inability to move or he would respond in kind! The vixen bit down on his lip, and he tilted his head as close to her as he could in response, wishing he could use his hands instead of having to simply chase her with feather-light kisses. She pushed harder against him, deepening the kiss, and he moaned. It was a grand kiss, vicious and savage and natural and godly. She was no great love-smith--she pressed hard, her lips inexperienced--but he did not care. \"You are in a big, bad way, uncle,\" she purred into his ear as her hand slithered down to his pants, grazing his heavy cock underneath the cloth with the lightest of touches. That made him groan; he tried to hold back, but his neediness only came out as a strangled curse instead. His head swam; she was receptive, he could touch her, could mate her. Her hands slid over his pants, squeezing the aching hardness within, and he kissed her as hard as he could, hips bucking against her. She withdrew only a second later, but the harsh sound of his buckle as she struggled to open it gave him a sudden moment of clarity. What was he doing? He shouldn't stay here, shouldn't do this, this was Demeter's daughter, his sister's daughter, Zeus' daughter for all that was holy. He was in an alliance so lightly held that a mere spark could set it all aflame, and the girl was a match burning upon his fingertips. \"You have such strange clothes, uncle,\" she murmured, tugging insistently on his belt. She pursed her swollen lips and looked at him, a small smirk upon that wicked face, and he knew he would be lost if she got it open. \"S-stop,\" he murmured. She did; surprise etched in her wide eyes. They were beautiful eyes, they were, and he wondered what those golden-flecked eyes would look like when he made her come with his --stop. No. Down, he commanded, though his cock happily disobeyed him. \"Shouldn't. Not right, you're...I'm...it's not right.\" Several emotions flashed across her face, too quickly for him to identify all of them but hurt was there, surprisingly, in a flash of lowered eyes and bitten lips and he--he wouldn't think of what that meant, not right now. He pressed a final kiss to the tip of her forehead, hoping it would smooth things over. She held out her hands to grab the vines holding his arms, a more innocent form of torture. He felt her start to loosen the vines that had held him, and panic seized at his heart. \"Don't.\" He looked down, frustrated. \"Please.\" \"You're very confusing, old man.\" Her voice had gone back to the clipped and icy tones of their original encounter, and somehow, despite knowing he was the cause of the change, he regretted it all the same. \"You intrude on my garden, crush my perfectly nice new flower, act like you're crazed with desire and seduce me only to tell me to back off, and now when I try to let you go--you're yelling at me not to.\" She laughed as Zeus did, mocking and cruel. \"I am sorry to have met you, uncle. I now see why my father--\" \"Persephone,\" he said; he leaned his head out toward her, but she did not come any closer, though she did not drop his hand. \"It is not...with this upon me, I... I am feverish for your touch. If you let me go, I may take more than that. I have been stung by Eros' arrow, and I do not know how well I will be able to hold myself back from the poison that courses through my veins.\" \"You are trying my patience.\" She snorted. \"That's not something you get from my little vine-weeds, uncle. I'm not that unkind. It might make you sneeze and scratch, but this,\" she cupped his cock for a second, and he winced, biting back the overwhelming urge to lean into her fingers. \"This is all you. I was willing to go along with your seduction, but I'll not accept blame for your own desires.\" \"I swear to you it is not a ploy.\" He grimaced as her hand went back to the safer ground near his arm. \"You may ask your mother and your sisters how I have treated them. Never have I so much as touched them in such a way. I am not my brothers. I am...\" He chuckled, but there was no mirth in it. \"Just an old man, long alone.\" \"You have all the great mortals of the world in your domain; I do not imagine it is hard for you to find talented courtesans to warm your bed.\"She sniffed, but he caught the waver in her voice, the way her hands clenched his arm. She was willing to be persuaded, she was vulnerable to his seduction. What was he saying? His head was swimming--he shouldn't be persuading her of anything, let alone seducing. He needed a safe topic. Preferably not focused on rutting. \"You have not seen my domain.\" He shrugged as best he could with his limbs so heavily bound. \"Not that I blame you, it is a dark and cold place. The shades of the dead are simply that--shadows. Have you ever tried to grasp a shadow? Even if I go into the shadow realm myself, they slide through me as I do through them. It is not...possible, to mate one.\" He realized, dimly, that he brought the subject back to sex without even meaning to--it seemed all but impossible to think of anything else. \"That sounds convenient. Too convenient.\" She sighed. \"Plenty of your ilk have lied when it suited you. Apollo himself told me when he last visited that he would invent a new musical instrument if only I would show him my breasts for inspiration as to its shape.\" The thought of Zeus' musical whelp artlessly flirting with Persephone made him feel irritated in a way that made him uncomfortable, and he brushed it away. \"You saw my behavior earlier. If I wished to mate you without your blessing, goddess, I'd have done it then. I told you I was no threat and asked to leave your domain, if you will recall.\" \"Do you still wish to leave?\" She asked, her voice unexpectedly soft, and he tilted his head in confusion at the sudden turn in her mood. \"I know I can be wicked, but...Is my company so horrid to you? I...I did bring supper.\" She reached into a pocket of her chiton she'd clearly stitched into the fabric, and pulled out two perfect red apples. There was a surprising amount of vulnerability in her then for she blushed as fiercely as the prize she held in her hands; he wondered, had she pulled this trick on her other suitors? Was this another trap, another way to keep him captive or torture him with strange but potent plants? His mind was too preoccupied with her touch at the moment to focus on anything but her hands, even knowing the dangers lurking within her. \"It...is not horrid.\" He wished he could squeeze her hand, but--hands bound, he could only persuade her with his words. \"Not horrid. I...\" Sure, she had held him captive, but...she had touched him with nary a hesitance over doing so; kissed him as if he was something worth kissing, and not an old man to be feared. She had been the first to dare to look at him as more than a mere inconvenience in centuries. And that mattered more, much more; in his love-addled mind, her touch had become all-encompassing. \"That...The last few minutes have been most enjoyable.\" \"Then...\" She grasped the vines holding his arms and tugged all at once; each flowered, then wintered, then split, falling to the ground as an explosion of flowers. \"What are you doing?!\" He roared; she did not turn away from her task; with a slide of her hand, the flowers returned to the earth, and he was left rubbing his wrists. She smiled shyly and leaned forward, pressed a kiss to his stunned lips, and this time his hand slid around her, his brain struggling to come back to life after being thoroughly stunned. Now he was able to grip her hips proper and bring her into a far better position to rub up against his cock and oh, stars above, the friction between them! His hands were everywhere upon her; bad idea, a part of his brain whispered, but then she bucked against him again and what wisdom he had left was gone. \"I will have you if you continue like this, vixen,\" he murmured in a low voice; damn Zeus, and damn Demeter, too. The writhing enchantress on his lap was all he could think of; consequences were something he would deal with later. His wildling groaned in response, and then drowned what was left of his mind in more kisses, a rapid fire of kisses; his lips felt sore from the aching need of her and when she rolled her hips on top of him it proved nearly his undoing; his hand clasped at the fibula on her shoulder until his knuckles turned white. Her fingers were not idle, either. He heard the click of his belt and broke his grip on her dress to help her undo it, sliding it from his waist and tossing it into the grass as if it was a snake. His fingers fumbled as he tried to push off the far-too-hot coat he'd been wearing for hours, and he snarled. Cooler, thinner fingers came to assist, and as his sister's daughter came to help him, he kissed her, the world sliding off its axis as her lips claimed him again, then again. She seemed as hungry as he was, and he did not think he could have his fill of her. Despite the considerable distraction of their kissing, she pulled the offending coat down with a quick tug; he tossed it behind him out into the open air. He needed more, needed to touch her more; needed his skin on her skin and now. Persephone was evidently of the same mind, as her fingers joined his at his buttons on his shirt; she worked from the bottom while he fumbled through the top and nothing, nothing could stop him from loudly moaning into her mouth as she pulled it off of his shoulders and her soft skin made contact with his own. Better, but still - not enough. \"Off,\" he murmured, tugging at her dress; she reached up and undid her chiton's brooch herself, and he kissed the soft, brown skin of her shoulder as she slipped it off, undraping the fabric from one arm, then the other. She slipped the entire garment off then, and he blinked in present surprise; she hadn't bothered wearing any sort of breast binding, and oh, what a lovely vision she was with only her smallclothes barely restraining her modesty. He hadn't noticed her breasts at first, his focus far too preoccupied in favor of her wide hips, but now he could kick himself for missing them. They were a fine set; rich as ichor in color, only slightly paler than the rest of her. He wanted, more than anything, to touch her; his hand dipped to lightly caress one and it was not enough. He could not resist having a taste of her. He bent his head low to capture one of her soft, brown peaks within his mouth and enjoyed very much the sudden wail he eeked out of her. He suckled like a man possessed, and felt her iron grip return to his hair, keeping him focused on her. His other hand pinched at the other breast, and when she let up her grip after a moment, he switched. Her breath sped up, and his pulse with it, and for a few moments, despite his protesting cock that pounded for release, he preoccupied himself purely on her pleasure, switching back and forth between pinching and suckling, enjoying each and every little cry the wildling ground out at his ministrations. \"Oh fates,\" she moaned in a breathy whisper; his hands gripped tight on her small-clothes; like her dress, they were an older style, but he remembered how to unknot the linen, and even with the distraction of her lovely, lovely breasts, he managed to free her from the fabric without looking, tossing it aside as she all but threw herself into getting his pants off. \"Off,\" she moaned into his mouth with a desperate zeal; he separated from her and she whimpered, and that sound made him move as if the furies themselves had commanded him; he kicked off his shoes, pulled down the pants and moved his hips upward; shimming out of them in a method that was unrefined but efficient, disposing of his underpants with it. He tossed those clothes with the rest, and by the time he'd kicked it all away and realized how ridiculous he must look, stamen wagging in the wind, she was next to him, her arm touching his own. He studied her for half a second; she was a sacred thing, sitting in the grass next to him, a soft blush on her cheeks and her hand carefully touching his. \"Stars above, you are a beautiful woman,\" he murmured and was satisfied to see her blush a soft red in response. \"How do you want to...?\" He asked, breathlessly; she blushed a fiercer shade, and before she could answer, he decided she was so lovely he couldn't help but kiss her, because kissing her tasted like nectar and it was hard for him to go even seconds without her in this frame of mind. Her hand roamed further south, exploring him slowly, trailing down his waist and when her hand closed around his cock in brief and blessed relief, it was all he could do not to mount her then and there. \"I...I don't know,\" she murmured; his head swam in options, and he mulled them over as he planted a fresh trail of kisses to her ear. It was odd she had no preference; the wilding had been nothing less than bossy up to this point, but he did not mind taking the lead. He blazed a hot trail of kisses down her neck and she did not protest when his hand gently brushed her legs apart and slowly stroked her sex for the first time. She was soft; so soft, it made him suck in a harsh breath. When his finger managed to slip from her lips to her entrance, he was pleasantly surprised; she was already quite wet. She squirmed against him, whimpering, and oh how his heart seized at the thought of mating her like this. \"Do you like to be touched like this, beautiful?\" He asked her; she bucked against him, answering with her hips instead of her mouth. He chuckled into her throat, sucking at it; he was enjoying the wildlings distress almost as much as she did. If he was clearer headed, he'd want to do this to her for hours; show her how patient death could be as he eeked more and more little mewls out of her. But today, his hot blood all but boiled in his veins; he was already straining to contain himself, but oh--he wanted to see her lose control, too. He separated from her for a second, only in as long as it took to lie down on his back on the ground. The wildling swung her legs around him; she needed no instruction there, the flawless minx. She ran her long fingernails down his chest in a move that sent him shivering. She moved to align them, already ready to take him; he shook his head, stopped her movement with the clap of his hands around her hips. \"Not yet,\" he murmured; her lips pursed, confused, but when he gently pushed her forward instead, she blushed a deep cherry-red, as if someone had stained her cheek with wine. \"Let me have a taste of you, sweetling,\" he said, his voice unable to hide his desire; more than anything, he wanted to taste her. She did not comment on his voice breaking. She parted her legs quite willingly and he smirked; she hadn't mentioned a word about being uncomfortable on top, and he suspected she would not, even if it was improper given their status--he outranked her in every way. But then, he had never seen so bossy a creature as her before and much to his surprise, he quite liked it--in this state, anyway. Her thighs landed on either side of his head and he wasted no time in moving his mouth to sample her. He kept his hands on her hips, urging her to move. He liked the feel of her comely hips in his hand; good to grip, good to hold, good to feel the flutter of life in hands so long used to holding nothing but ether. He kissed her most reverent place carefully, tongue lapping at her core with a gentleman's grace. Slow, slow, slow; go slow, he tried to tell himself, even if it was torture. He managed to start slowly, tongue gently probing her slit; she leaned into him, hips moving on instinct. Good. She tasted like copper and...mint? A sort of herbaceous flavor he struggled to place, but knew that he only wanted more of. He slowly probed her opening with his tongue, felt the sharp inhale of her breath even from between her thighs; she was a tight thing and did not allow him entrance easily. Her hips rocked back, breaking contact. She uttered a shaky breath, and his hands directed her to come back. When she moved forward again after a moment, he licked a long trail from her center to the soft nub at the tip of her sex; that made her thighs clench around his face and he moaned, overwhelmed by the sensation of her. He kept his tongue's pressure upon it as much as he could, writing old, ancient words into her that had long since lost meaning in this world and his own. She writhed above him, her hips and thighs damp with sweat. The wildling's hips were truly wild now, moving of their own volition entirely as he licked at her, endlessly hungry; her scent was more glorious nectar than anything he'd supped upon on Olympus. He should, he knew, show her mercy. He backed off for a few seconds, swiped lower, angled to slide further into her entrance, trying to stretch her open with his tongue gently at first, then harder, faster; her hand wound through his hair and tugged insistently, yanking his mouth back toward her clit. With a soft laugh, he complied. He didn't even mind the loss of control; he liked that he knew what she wanted, and he was more than willing to reward her for it. His head swam as he went for the kill, sucking at her clit as if worlds depended on it. She murmured something low that he couldn't hear, tucked between her thighs; his fingers pressed down on her hips instead, gripping her tight. Her noises grew louder, her thighs trembling; he felt it, encouraged it. He clamped his hands down hard to hold her hips down so he could take her up to the peak and over. The wail she emitted when she finally came tumbling down for him was almost painful to his ears, even sheltered by her thighs, but it was the most lovely music he'd heard. He stroked her skin reassuringly, licking each aftershock to drink her down as much as he can. She broke contact again, moving backward; before he could so much as blink, she grabbed him by his silver hair, pulled his mouth up to hers for a sloppy kiss. He was, perhaps, less gentle than he could be; his mouth chased hers hungrily, unable to break contact for more than a few seconds. \"Your face is wet,\" she murmured between kisses. He didn't bother to reply, ducked down to nip at her throat. Her hands wrung through his damp hair as he nibbled more at her lovely neck, then chased the bite with soft kisses. Oh yes, he would mark her; would mark her as his so every time she looked upon any reflective surface, she would see his bite upon her neck. She slid down him quickly, readjusting until she was straddling his lap. She was all confidence now, rubbing her folds against him, and oh, the view there was so good he moved so that he could see her better. The underworld would look particularly dull in comparison to this for...for perhaps ever, he thought, compared to the glory of his little life-goddess. She was glorious, hunched above him like an Amazon waiting for the kill. \"You play a dangerous game, sweetling,\" he murmured, but in truth, he could not protest against the view or the angle. \"Always.\" She looked at him with a heavy, daring look, no longer joking. He moved a bit to to align himself with her, and pressed the head of his cock to her entrance; had he been in a better state of mind, he would have held this for a while, teased her, savored the feel of her against him. But today, the ichor in his veins was all but rioting. He rose up to better see himself disappear slowly into her, but the wilding, ever one to take advantage, leaned over him and bit, hard, at his neck, and he lost the final dregs of his remaining control. He slammed himself down inside her, burying himself to the hilt in one quick motion. She drew in a heavy and harsh intake of breath and he stilled. She wasn't moving, and in truth, he wasn't sure if he should. He hadn't meant to take her so fast, and he was suddenly all too aware it might have been painful. When he looked up at her, she was biting her lips, clearly straining, but she did not ask him to pull out, either. \"Am I too much for you, little one?\" She shook her head and exhaled. \"No, but...fuck.\" She wriggled her hips lightly and squeezed him with inner muscles that made him all but roil underneath her; he stroked at her hips slowly as she took one deep breath, then two. She was tight; just being inside her made his mind swim. She started to rise off of him and he groaned, keeping himself still and letting her set the pace. Up, slow; down, slower still. But he was inside her, and that was a heady thing indeed. \"Good girl, keep moving, just like that,\" he purred; she squeezed him with an involuntary shiver of her muscles, and his eyes all but rolled back in his head. \"You feel so good, beautiful.\" He had thought that the poison would abate when he was awash in her tight body, would leave him after he'd finally had what had desired most. It had not. Instead, it had amplified; all he could feel was her: the slow movements of her hips, the squeeze of his cock by her tight cunt, the brush of her thighs against his. Zeus and their entire horrible family could be standing in a circle around them offering criticisms on his technique, and he doubted he would notice for one second. She put two hands on his chest; he hissed as her hands grazed against his nipple. She moved up, down; faster, settling into a rhythm now, taking her pleasure on him. He dared to thrust his hips up a bit and she grinned, a right wicked grin every bit as lovely as what he had fantasized about when he'd been only dreaming of having her. \"Still good?\" She asked, her voice surprisingly vulnerable. \"Very good,\" he murmured. She moved her hips as he matched her pace, slowly but insistently starting to rut her. She leaned forward more, her mouth coming close enough he could kiss her, but she ducked past his lips with only the slightest whisper, instead moving to the side and kissing his ear. \"I have death in me,\" she whispered into his ear, childish bragging evident in her ragged voice. \"So you do,\" he admitted, stroking her cheek. She moved forward enough to suckle at his bite and he cock surged at that; she intended to mark him. He groaned and thrust deep; the new angle was a bit more shallow and he wanted more. Needed more. He grabbed her ass and thrust deeper and deeper, furiously bottoming himself out and setting a pace that at best could be described as punishing for them both. She moaned. Her mouth fell open with a heavy-lidded gaze; he wondered if she could see how pleasurable he found her, for certainly he could tell looking at her that she was quite enjoying him. After a moment of staring into one another's eyes, she kissed him, and his control of his powers faltered; he opened his palms up to her, shadow-power pulsing within. That - that was too much for what would be surely a one night stand, and yet, he could not stop himself from doing it. To involve powers was to go beyond the mortal mechanics of the act, to offer her a god's embrace--it was a dangerous thing, a combination of their powers, and there was no telling what they could create. But the wildling--she only lived up to her name. She took one look at the shadows smoking from his palms and pressed her palms on top of it, a verifiable explosion of flowers growing out of the mist between their fingers. He gasped, hard; he shifted, forcing her into his lap so he could fuck her furiously, trying madly to mate her, breed her, have her--whatever he could take of her, he would have, and he would have himself as deep in her as he could be. \"Fuck!\" She shouted into his shoulder, the word almost slurred as she bounced on his cock, and he stared adoringly at her. On her lips, it was the most beautiful word he had ever heard in his long life. Her hands held tight to his, and he wouldn't ever even dream of letting go. This was new to him, and the change was stunning; it was as if he had been blind, and now could see. It was--it was different, different than he had ever thought it would be. He was aware, suddenly, of how every movement felt to her, how every single arc of his cock felt in her tight little body, not only from his perspective, but her own: how full she was of him, the pressure of his hips pressing to hers almost overwhelming. He felt her emotions cresting over the top of him; felt her sheer desire float by on an eddy of overwhelming emotion. His mind expanded, enveloped hers, and she did the same to him. He felt everything the wildling did, and it almost scared him; he saw his future self in her, and wondered if she saw the same, an entwining of fate's ropes as inflexible as her vines. She looked no less affected; she was making little nonsense noises into his shoulder, little phrases that he couldn't quite place the meaning of. \"I didn't know it would...\" she murmured, hands pulsing against his own; a sunflower sprouted from her tresses, withered, died, was reborn in a cavalcade of asphodel that flowed through her dense hair. \"I didn't--think--\" He squeezed her fingers as reassuringly as he could. She looked up at him, visible awe in her eyes as she whined toward her limits. He claimed her lips in a hot, bursting scorch of pain-pleasure; white heat flew through his entire, immortal body, and he whimpered, overcome. The connection deepened, images flashed through his mind: Persephone on his throne, in her garden, her tent, but always with him; in his bed, arcing against him as her hands scrambled for purchase, knotted in his blanket. He gasped, the air driven out of him as he rammed his hips hard into her, in an orgasm so strong he felt like he was he was slammed face--first into the summit of the highest mountain he'd ever attempted to climb and could only scramble for purchase falling down it. Instinct took him the rest of the way -- he should have cut connection with their powers, but he didn't, couldn't; instead, he trembled underneath her like a fish out of water, complete with mouth open in surprise, and the wildling simply clamped down on his hands and rode out his orgasm with him, letting him come within her. Visions passed, too quickly for him to see anything but her --and flowers blossomed about him, each in different jewel-tones, each growing more vivid as he pulsed deep within her. She should have slid off of him, he thought; really, he should have pulled out before this point, but he couldn't and he didn't, and he was still too feverish to even think of the potential implications of that. She continued to ride him to nurse the aftershocks, teasing him with soft kisses as her hips moved on him; she was shaking, too; close, he thought. He broke the connection of his power to hers; she whimpered but oh, it was too much, too much. He sat up and caught her with one arm, keeping her hips close as she ground against him; the other snaked between them, pressing down on her clit as best he could. \"Ki-kiss me?\" She asked, stuttering, and he complied, could not even think of not doing so. She gasped as he crashed down on her mouth, and his softening cock flared back to life again as he felt her channel pulse around him. Even in this, he couldn't sate his thirst for her. She gasped quietly against him several times, hips still flaring in desire as she came, and he kissed each and every space on her that he could reach until she slowed, finally, and laid her head upon his shoulder. \"It seems there's still some life in you yet, old man,\" she said; oh, how his heart melted for this wildling. It was not entirely the poison in his veins anchoring them together, he thought. He kissed her again, rumbling pleasing, nonsense noises in his chest. He nuzzled encouragement as she continued to ride him in slow, simple moves; he was well aware of how much he wanted her again already. \"I hadn't done that before,\" she said slowly, placing her hand on his now-closed palm and letting just the slightest frisson of life flow forth into his ancient veins. \"Nor I,\" he admitted; he'd refrained, before, from indulging that instinct; it was an unpredictable thing, and required giving up more control than he'd been comfortable with. Not to mention, of course, that taking a full dose of death's gifts would -- well, anything lesser than this wilding would have quickly become part of his reaping, and that would be more than awkward. He'd seen what happened to Semele, when Zeus had tried the God's embrace with a woman of lesser stock; he'd had to reassemble her soul in the underworld, fragment by fragment. The more powerful the gift, the more dangerous, and he was no less powerful than Zeus. \"Thank you, lovely,\" he said, because only now did he vaguely realize how much damage he could have done, just out of a selfish desire for--what? Instinctual bonding? He chided himself, but yet: he was hard, hard as iron, cock still desperate to move, wanting more still; no, needing her still. She shifted back a bit with a frown and he shook his head. Don't go, he tried to say, knowing all too well how selfish it was. \"Are you...\" She frowned. \"Did you come? I thought I felt you--\" \"Oh yes,\" he hummed, nodding his head. \"Oh yes.\" A part of him wondered if she was disappointed by his wanting more, if she'd starve him now after having been so generous. \"But I am...\" The words faded; he did not know how to describe it. She made him feel alive, in ways he had not felt for - a long time. It was a fever, but it was more than a fever, and telling her the whole of how he felt was too vulnerable, even as intimate as they were. Instead, he pivoted to humor. \"I have life on my lap, it seems.\" \"Hm, so you do.\" She smiled a little smile, a copper blush to her dark cheeks, and disengaged from him; the loss was staggering enough he whined a bit as she slid off of him, leaving him wet and, still, painfully hard. She looked at him for a long second as he stood, eyes skimming down his body. His breath caught in his throat slightly at the look in her eyes, dark and warm and curious. One of her fingers gently touched his shoulder before moving a trail down his skin, dipping into the soft grey of his chest hair. He did not move, unsure of the foundations they were now on; she tilted her head, studying him, her eyebrows rising in a silent question as she traced the long scar that divided his chest neatly, then dipped down to his hips. \"My father.\" He hoped she wouldn't ask for details and to his surprise, she didn't. She held out a hand and he grabbed it, though the touch of her closed hand was maddening when he knew what that hand contained. She brushed some of the dirt off his back with her free hand, smiling. \"You've got a lot of scars,\" she murmured, squeezing his hand. \"I like them. They...tell a story. I see why you are hailed as so fearsome.\" \"Oh, I shall take that as a compliment, then,\" he said, feeling quite the confused fool. Was he really flirting with the wildling? Was he truly so deluded as to think perhaps she might allow him to mount her twice? Immortal women were fickle, he knew. His grandfather had lost his member for only 100 couplings; the wildling was as descended from Gaea as he was and seemed far shorter of temper. And yet, gods above, how he wanted her. She stepped out ahead of him, suddenly purposeful in her stride despite being as naked as the day she was born, and he watched, confused, as she walked around them, tossing branches and brambles into the long-abandoned fire pit. Was she preparing for tuning in for the night? Hadn't it barely been dark when she'd come back? He blinked, noting for the first time that it was quite dark upon the mortal plane; so long down in his underworld, it was easy for him to forget that this was quite different from the normal day for humankind. And his one wild-lived goddess, who had chosen the mortal world over Olympian gold. She turned back to him and snorted. \"You look ridiculous, you know, standing there in the wind. Get our clothes. Your night vision surely is better than mine, or is all your talk about the underworld being so dark and gloomy just that--talk?\" He tilted his head in confusion, but she'd already turned back to the fire; did she intend to dress and leave him here? Perhaps that was the way of it. He sighed. Perhaps he would have this ailment forever, aching eternally now. Still, despite the wound to his pride, he obeyed, gathering their hastily tossed things. He held out the fabric of her chiton to her, and she rummaged around in it until she produced something from one of the drapes of fabric she'd made into a pocket: a flint. After a few moments, she managed to produce Prometheus' gift to the humans and turned back to him with a soft smile. He stood with his clothes in his hands, debating what his next move was. He should - he should go. But before he could begin to say goodbye, she was gone again, crawling into the tent. He felt a fool, and his cheeks flushed a rare shade of crimson. Perhaps she thought their coupling less than impressive, or his body proof of a less than enduring case of opposites attract; perhaps she was disappointed in this filthy old man, who wanted nothing but to so obviously to fuck her again and again. Perhaps she was reconsidering what they had done. Perhaps this was her answer as to whether it would ever happen again. Figuring that was the well and true end of things, he sighed and began to redress; it would not be particularly easy, given that he was still half-turgid, but he managed to get his pants nearly all the way up before he heard the tent part again. \"Where are you going?\" The wildlings voice was reedy and hurt, and he turned back to a look of surprised anger on her face. Again. \"I thought you wished me to leave,\" he said, and truthfully, he knew he should. Despite the fire in his blood, he had his duties under the ground and he was dimly aware he was neglecting them. But then his wildling shook her head. \"No, Hades, let me be clear: I want you to come here, and I want you to fuck me,\" she said, and his deathless heart nearly stopped. Her lips slid into a smile that may as well have been a portent of his doom; his mind whirled in giddy terror. But somehow, he was already walking toward her. The poison muddling his head and his cock took him the rest of the way. He tossed his hastily discarded clothing next to hers, abandoning it by the fire, and dove through the doorway. \"You're pretty spry, you know,\" she said, smirking, and then she held out a hand, vines wrapping around it already in a wordless embrace of life; she was open, open, and willing to mate! He opened his palm, shadow-sense open, and let instinct guide him home as he coupled her. This time, he took his time entering her; much to his satisfaction, she did not complain as he slowly pressed himself inside of her. \"Better?\" He asked, voice low; she nodded and smiled, biting her lip. \"You feel very nice,\" she murmured; a shy grin graced her lips, and he had never seen anything so beautiful. \"I could get used to this, Hades.\" He chuckled; the idea seemed a good one to him. It was different this time, in the comfort of the cave, under the crackling of the fire; his pace was slower, more tender, and despite the muddling of his senses, he was well aware of how much this felt like a different kind of union than what they'd shared earlier. Still, desperately, he wanted her; whatever she gave him, it was simultaneously too much and not even close to enough. He buried himself deep on every thrust, desperate to stay with her, to couple her completely; he felt himself buried deep in her, felt her tight cunt gripping him mercilessly and felt her overwhelming sense of being filled in turn. She wrapped her legs around him, her hands, she held tight to his above her head, and he felt everything; he felt her every move, her every breath. It was getting stronger now, the connection between them, and that was in its own way terrifying; he had never been connected to anyone on such a level. Lazy vines of morning glories slowly wound around his head in a garland, and he felt his pulse shudder at the sheer sentimentality of her giving him a crown in her own lands. He did not dare to pull his hand away from hers, not at all. He concentrated, closing his eyes and using his own power to build her a circlet of jewels from his own kingdom, pyrite chains with light green and yellow peridots dancing upon her brow. She giggled in joy at his gift, and a mad, possessive love grew deep in his old, ancient bones. His lips kissed at every bit of her he could reach, but he did not, could not break away. Now that he knew she could be trusted with this sort of embrace, it felt almost profane not to expose himself to her this way. You are setting yourself up to marry this sweetling, his mind whispered, and even knowing all the ways that could be a bad idea, knowing how many she had rejected; still, his mouth said \"Yes,\" and she had cried out and he had known, then, what he would have to ask her. It would not be too bad a thing for her. Surely she would grow used to the underworld; she would have far more power at his side than as a mere goddess of flowers and fauna. He could see it, linked with her; the bound string of fate, the woman whose face was open with unbearable pleasure upon his bed. Yes, he would have her. He needed her...and it was not, entirely, his ailment that had led him to such desires. Perhaps this was a sign, this fever; perhaps it had been given to him by the fates, the old biddies finally fed up of him being so long alone. They worked in strange ways, after all. Perhaps they had been the ones to kick the dryad from its roots; or to alert her to his needs--if so, he was in some way, thankful to them. The madness in his veins let him plunge into her, again and again, insatiable; he lost track of how many times they made love that night, only knowing that he had ceased to count by the time they finally stopped. The firelight dimmed and glowed low, and still, he made love to her; her in his lap, her on her side, her underneath him, her above him. His mind swam as he claimed her, again and again; only at the end of the night, when even his immortal body began to ache before the dawn, did he finally soften enough to be sated - if only just. She rarely broke her grip on his hands, keeping them bonded the entire time, and as sunlight began to flow over his rapidly closing eyes, she kept them locked together, so that even their dreams would be shared. Marry me, he thought, and he wasn't sure if she heard him or not; a quiet titter of laughter resounded in his head, and he wasn't sure if it was her assenting, her laughing at his ridiculous proposal, or simply his own mind acknowledging the farce of it all. They'd barely known one another a day, and yet - he could think of nothing but her. He was, for the moment, too exhausted to worry about his feelings. For the first time in a long time, he felt--at peace. Slowly, he began to ebb away from the waking world, into sleep, where his dreams were - for the first time since his father's war - pleasantly dreamless and black. He awoke more sore than he had been in years; every joint he had cracked as he slowly blinked back to awareness. He grunted and squinted in unfamiliar sunlight, trying to recall why he wasn't in his own bed, waking up to the dim fire-light of the Phlegethon. There was a smoking campfire outside, and he was in a...tent? He blinked and looked to his side, suddenly aware of the body lying next to him as he shifted. A lovely head of kinky, flowing hair well bedecked with flowers and jewels lay next to him; the wildling, he remembered, and, slowly, he began to recollect his memories of the previous day, which rolled in dimly at first and quickly amplified in volume, a symphony of low moans and heavenly cries. Hades gasped in horror. He had - oh, no. He remembered being wrapped in the vines, the urgent infection that had been sent upon his blood--and the satisfaction he'd taken in her. Oh, he'd taken his fair share, hadn't he, and more than that. Demeter was going to absolutely kill him, and he deserved it; he'd taken his younger sister's daughter--her much younger daughter--as a goddess, linked up with her in ways that were quite profane. Life and death in a dance like that? Demeter would be well within her rights to turn him into kindling. They hadn't even - gods above, had she had any sort of contraception? He did not recall asking, and he certainly hadn't offered. Zeus may well use Chronos' sickle off on him should Persephone birth his bastard, he thought. It wouldn't be easy to misidentify any kin of his; any child of his would be born with the heavy cowl of the underworld on them. Zeus would ferret it out as easily as he had his own hundreds of whelps. He had little hope of getting ahead of this; he'd have to go to Olympus as soon as possible and beg -- beg -- his insufferable younger brother for the girl's hand. A hand which Zeus had, oh-so-tactfully and subtly, already denied him by virtue of not asking him if he'd wanted her in the first place. And to think only a few afternoons ago, he had thought Zeus had done him a favor. The goddess at his side slowly turned. As she did, the blanket she'd pulled up around them fell away, revealing the flush of a well--sexed woman, and his mark well nipped into her neck. He really had lost control; he sighed. Idiot. He ran his hand over his own neck, felt the tender spot where she'd nipped into him--no, it would be obvious on them both. They'd left their marks. Well, only one thing to be done. It was too late to take things back and...he wasn't entirely sure if he regretted it. She had held him all night, shadow-palm and all. Even Hestia, his closest sister, could not boast such a simple expression of love; she had always winced when they'd so much as shaken hands, even if he'd kept his power closed off from her. The others were varying shades of not-better and worse still when it came to touching him; Zeus would barely touch his palm, shaking his hand like a limp fish; Poseidon never touched his hand at all, ditto Demeter, and Hera--well, she looked insulted he'd even try. But Persephone--she had been open with him from the start, had courted him. What was it she'd said when she'd mounted him? I have death in me, his memory of her voice whispered in his ear. And she did. How she did. How he would like her to have him again, though there was nothing left of his cock for her to find novel, not anymore. The beautiful girl snored lightly, and he could not stop himself from touching her side. How warm she was, how soft, how beautiful. He wanted her still, even knowing he should be ashamed for it. She was centuries younger than him. Perhaps even millenniums younger. She may wear the old clothes but who knew how old she was; 18? 1,800? 18,000? He was far older than all of the above, had taken his first steps when the world was little more than smoke and ash. She neither leaned into his touch nor denied it, continuing to sleep soundly. He supposed she had every right to be tired, he'd put her through her paces in this tent, and outside, too. Stars above, he realized dimly; they'd put on quite a show outside as well. He'd have even less room to maneuver with cocky Zeus now, who no doubt had seen every image of him quite eagerly enjoying his daughter's gifts. He tried to lie back down next to her, holding her as close as he could, even with her hair full of poppies, petunias, peridot and pyrite tickling at his nose. He ran a hand down her side again, closing his eyes as he explored her smooth, tawny skin. She would come with him, wouldn't she? He could not imagine the wildling out of her lands, but neither could he imagine her refusing. A realm-lord's offer of marriage was far higher than Demeter could reasonably expect her wildling daughter to receive, but then, the child had already refused Poseidon's offer of companionship, and that, too, had been a realm-lord's offer. He tightened his arm across her, holding her tighter. His heart was beating faster; perhaps fast enough that she could hear it, for she stirred slightly in his arms. And if she awoke, what then? He grimaced. He was not ready to have this discussion, not yet. He wasn't even sure he could have any conversation with her here; if she awoke, and she looked at him with wide, wicked gold-flecked eyes in a naughty glance? He'd bed her again, he thought; she was already naked, and he'd take every bit of advantage to have her again and again. He would fill her as long as she was willing. Something about her took his well-honed control and flung it straight down to Tartarus; she was vexing and intoxicating and wonderful all at once. No, he couldn't do it; had to have his mind set right. He needed - he needed space. Carefully, he extracted himself from her, slowly slipping his hands from her side and moving at a snail's pace so as not to make much noise. He crawled out of the tent with blinking confusion in the low light of day; then, he meekly gathered his outfit. He put back on his pants and buttoned up his shirt; he debated adding the coat, but forsook it - if the wilding awoke while he was walking, he wanted her to know that he was still around, had not left without saying goodbye. He glanced heavenward, as if he could see Zeus. He raised a hand to the sky, but no heavenly messenger came; no warning, either. No thunderbolt came down upon him, and he took that as perhaps a sign that Zeus would be merciful enough to allow marriage. With a sigh, he walked forward, gathering his shoes and walking through the wildling's grove. As far as sacred spaces went, it was a rather nice one; now, in the quiet twilight, he could see a bit more of it as he paced restlessly. It was an island, he realized, dimly coming across the shoreline on the opposite side of where he'd arrived earlier when he had apparated up into the mortal world. He turned back toward the wildlings grove, marveling at her little space. It was alive in every quarter; vines and grasses and thick nettles and briars everywhere he passed. The trees closest to her clearing were spectacular; old stock he knew not the name of, but even he enjoyed their brilliant green leaves. It felt unnatural to admire the vivacity of life here, so long underground, but he did. He found himself pacing back to where the wildling had met him only what felt like a day before, staring down at the garden which had so enraptured his interest--and the spirit that had once been trapped there. Poor Charon; he had been gone long, now, and the boatman must truly be bored with the nymph. Hopefully, he had not dunked it into the Styx. He could see the vine the poor dryad had been contained in and next to it, the flower he had tramped the day before. The vine had curled around the flower, still well-sprung and hale from Persephone's touch the day before. It was a beautiful thing, and again he felt the curious urge to touch it--but this time he held back, observed it more carefully. There was something a bit odd to it, the quicksilver grey mixed with light pink in its petals, the odd thrum of its energy. He stared upon it again, wondering why the quicksilver grey should so bother him--and then it hit him, all at once. That was Aphrodite's bloom, awash in the quicksilver ink; the nymph's blood, it was called. A renowned--and potent--aphrodisiac. And they had both touched it. He scooted back on instinct, panic seizing in his chest. A love-plant, a love-spell, and they'd both fallen under its sway. He'd taken her without knowing, but it made it all the more despicable; of course she would have no interest in a man such as himself without it. Of course, it had been all the damnable love goddess. Aphrodite, he thought, was Uranus' revenge on them all for his castration. What better evidence of that was this feeling rioting through his chest, as if his ancient heart was cracking open, ready to be devoured? This was not love, though it had been all too easy to fool himself with perhapses and if onlys. This had been mere chance, a shared poisoning of blood--and he, the elder, who should have known better, had done little more than all too willingly bury his cock into a woman whose virtue he should have protected. He was, he realized, no better than his brothers. And the wildling--had she truly wanted it at all? Had he done little more than rape her? Would she awaken sad and sore of him? He had to--he had to talk to her, had to explain--but that didn't matter. No, he'd done her badly. No recompense could fix it. To think, he would have asked her to marry him. Foolish. Of course he could not hope for such, of course her touch had been nothing more than mere...lust. She would never hold her hand open to him like that again, let intoxicating life course through his shadow-senses as she had. She would be horrified when she remembered how much of death she had let inside her, and he would carry this shame until his dying day. He heard the soft crunch of the grass behind him, and knew his doom was at hand. The girl crept up behind him and pressed two strong arms across his chest; he did not know what to do. Did he hold her? Did he run away? He could not decide and thus did nothing, standing quite miserable. \"Mornin', uncle. Well, evening.\" She chuckled into his ear and he shifted, trying with all his might not to turn around and bury her in his arms. \"Are you hungry? I'm quite famished; we never did eat the snack I grabbed and you worked me so hard all night.\" Her hand trailed lower, loosely caressing his hip and then lower still; he stopped her hand there, before it reached its destination. \"I did not hear you leave, you were so quiet; were you thieving out of my garden for a snack? You could have asked. I would have given one to you--though now, I suppose, I have the means to demand compensation and thus to keep you even longer.\" She slipped from his side then, taking a step forward past him and near the garden. Unable to resist any longer, he grabbed her into a tight embrace, telling himself even if it was selfish, he was at least keeping her from danger. His hands caught fabric and for once he was happy she was wearing her dress. His hand settled on her belly, softly moving with her breath under his fingertips. He dared not think of what he feared. \"Don't,\" he said, and swallowed. \"What?\" He looked down upon her, sure he was not doing a good job keeping the horror from his face. She looked up with the face of the innocent, and he watched painfully as her expression went from blissful happiness to concern. \"What troubles you, uncle?\" She looked down to her belly then back at him, and shook her head, a soft smile on her lip. \"Are you worried...? Oh, never fear uncle, you'll not be made a father yet. I've taken silphium for birth control every morning for centuries. There's no risk of that, Hades.\" That was a small relief, to know he had not begotten her an unwelcome babe on top of everything else. But still, he suffered. He reached out with an unsteady hand; cupping her cheek. He had to tell her. She had every right to know. \"Persephone...niece.\" \"Hm?\" She leaned her wild cheek into the curve of his palm, and he sucked in a hot gasp of air. Stars, how could she stand him? Surely she would not, after knowing what he had done to her. \"I need to tell you something,\" he said, and she smiled and shook her head. \"Is that all that has you so dour? I heard what you thought in the morning-light, uncle; and there is no need to be nervous, I shall give you my answer while we eat; let me pluck a few things from my garden...\" She smiled brilliantly and pulled away from him, and he wondered if she was still under its veil; she had been infected later than he had been. He could not allow her to touch it again. \"No!\" He pulled her tighter to him. \"Please listen.\" \"Whatever could be such a matter? You are bleating so much like a nanny goat I should think you were my mother.\" He ignored the insult, smoothing down her hair with shaking hands. \"Look in your garden, to the flowers; the one I trampled yesterday, do you remember?\" She turned and looked; he kept his arms on her, and told himself it was for reasons less selfish than fearing it was the last time that he would be able to do so. \"It is one of Auntie Aphrodite's plants she recently gifted me,\" she said, her voice as innocent as a lark. \"Yes, I know uncle.\" \"We touched it,\" he ground out between clenched teeth. \"We were...under its spell.\" Her eyes widened; she sucked in a harsh breath, then another. \"You...touched it? On purpose?\" Now she looked troubled, and his heart sunk as he knew it would. \"No!\" He shook his head vigorously and then stopped, reconsidered. Dangerous ground here, and it would be best to be honest. \"Well, sort of. I thought it was lovely, and wished to touch it as a flower--I did not recognize the danger of it until I saw it now, and remembered just what effect such potent drug may have.\" \"Oh.\" She looked up at him, her chin almost wobbling; even someone as unused to company as himself recognized, all too keenly, that this was a sign she might cry. \"Does that mean when we...you really were...feverish? You were not playing?\" \"Yes.\" He closed his fingers around her wrist. \"I am sorry, I should not have--\" \"No, I am the fool.\" She sniffed. \"I thought-- thought you wanted-- \" \"The fault is entirely mine.\" He pulled her closer to him, surprised that she had not yet run for the hills--or her mother. \"I am an elder of the family, and as such, I should have protected you better, even from myself.\" She made a soft, sniffling cry; he stroked her hair. \"I'm...I thought you were playing you had touched it, uncle.\" She huffed into his shirt, something between a laugh and a bitter exhale. \"You warned me and yet I thought...he is seducing me, I see it; if he were under the influence, surely he could not hold back at all and he is trying so hard not to mount me, he would not touch me, prep me...It is a game he is playing.\" \"It is not your fault, my dear. I am the elder and the blame lies with me.\" His stomach threatened towards upheaval and he fought the bile hard; he was already ruining her memories of him enough. \"It... I am terribly sorry. You see, I owe you recompense that even with all my riches, I am unsure how to repay, but I will, in whatever way you or your parents deem proper.\" She looked up at him then, biting her lip. \"Uncle Hades, I need to tell you something.\" She curled her hands over his neck, though she'd had to stand on her tip-toes to do it. She leaned up and moved her lips to his ear, as if to whisper him a secret. \"...I dosed myself,\" she whispered, and he jerked away from her, no doubt looking quite the fool but scalded all the same. Her face fell at his response. \"What?\" He looked back at her in ghastliness. He wouldn't have wished that on anyone. \"Why?\" \"You looked at me with interest, and I...\" She bit her lip. \"I knew losing my virginity to you would piss my father off. And I am tired, truth be told, of being a virgin locked on an island. And you are...\" She was bright red now, and only growing redder. \"You're...well, you're quite handsome, uncle.\" \"You are the first to call me that.\" He said, then, realizing fully well and true what she had said, he ran his hand over his face. So he'd taken her virginity to boot, his lady mother above and father below. She had as much as told him; be had simply chosen not to be aware of it. \"I am...sorry. I owed you a better time of it. I did not know.\" \"It was a very good time of it, to me.\" She smiled but he saw the cracks of unsteadiness in it; she reached out a hand to him and he took it. \"I did not know you, too, had touched it. I thought...It's a silly thing, but when I saw you look at me while I notched that arrow, I thought - I thought you found me flattering, uncle. I didn't--I didn't know it was--\" \"It was not entirely the cursed plant. I do think you beautiful, sweetling.\" He patted her shoulder awkwardly. This was a new realm; he was not used to thinking of emotional things. \"But why put such a curse upon yourself, Persephone? I would not have wished such a horrid liquid fire upon the veins of my worst enemies.\" \"I wanted to...\" She turned away and scoffed. \"I have been so long cooped up, uncle! My mother leaves me here because I am no longer allowed to assist her in her duties; my father demands I remain until I finally marry off, so I am often alone. There are no mortals here anymore, and the Gods who have come have only come to beg for my body as a brief means of pleasing my father. Why do you think I have taken an aborficant like silphium so long? I've long feared one of them would try to force me, for I wanted none of them.\" He tried to imagine it. He too had lived alone for many, many years, but he had not had the threat of rape held over his head. Stars above, he knew how ruthless the family was and yet he'd abandoned her with the rest of them. \"Oh, Persephone...\" he said, and drew his arms around her. The poor woman. No wonder she had been so fierce when first they had met. She would not need to be so again; regardless of how she felt about him, he would put her under his protection. \"I had thought you had gone to see your mother for the antidote...? It despairs me to think of you so suffering all alone. I cannot believe your mother would allow this.\" \"She has no choice; she cannot resist the will of Zeus. And I suspect you will think it foolish, but...\" her voice was wobbling now, strength fading to a vulnerability that made him shudder. \"I have lived here alone for many years, with only my suitors for company. Most did not take rejection well; many told me I was ugly and that I would be lucky of their company, that no one likes an old virgin, that I was frigid; uncle, and after so many insults I took them for truth. I thought if I would borrow some of my auntie's grace, perhaps I would be...seductive enough, for a man of your stature. I was nervous and I walked in the trees to get the sap from an old tree, and then walked more until I felt the drug take effect, and even then I waited until I was nearly out of my mind with want before I returned. I wanted you to think of me as beautiful as Aphrodite and just as irresistible.\" \"That you were,\" he admittedly quietly. \"That you are. But you would be, regardless.\" He took a chance and pressed a kiss to her forehead. \"You are stunningly beautiful, the finest of all goddesses. Know this for truth, for all your days.\" \"Now you are the first to say that,\" she said, a soft blush on her cheeks. They stayed together a moment, neither sure, he thought, of where to go from here. She squeezed his hand carefully, and he traced nonsense patterns on her hand with his thumb. She found her courage first and looked up at him, brown eyes evaluating him. \"Do you...do you regret it, uncle? What we did?\" That was a potent question and he weighed his responses carefully. He might not have wished for the conditions of their first meeting but...he could not honestly say he was sorry to make her acquaintance. She was not only beautiful but crafty and compassionate, and he had not known he much he had longed to connect with someone who showed no fear of him. \"No,\" he said, plainly. \"Do you?\" She shook her head and leaned upwards on her toes, struggling to kiss him. He bent down and captured her lips for her. Even without Aphrodite's poison, it wasn't enough for him; he kissed her again, then again, and again. She tugged his head toward her and he deepened the kiss; her hands moved under his shirt and he moaned into her, breaking the kiss only when he absolutely had to. They stumbled backward until they hit one of the trees of her orchard, and he used it to trap her against him, letting her feel how he was already half-erect at her touch. \"You are quite a dangerous thing,\" he murmured. His lips went to her neck and licked and suckled wantonly at the mark he'd made on her, knowing the bite would still be tender. She stroked at his nape, her fingers just barely reaching the mark shed placed on him, and he growled possessively. \"Always.\" She smiled at him, pure and sweet and intoxicatingly alluring, the subtlest hint of danger in the glint of her teeth. A fine queen of his lands she would be, oh yes. She grinned wider, and he wondered if she could read his thoughts. \"Do you wish to know the answer to your question?\" She wiggled her hips against him and he felt adrift in a dangerously strong current in Aphrodite's ocean. How could he be so intoxicated by her, having known her so short a time? Had he lost his damn mind? Perhaps, but he felt dangerously giddy of it. He supposed time did not matter. They belonged together. It was as simple as that. A dangerous feeling pushed up through his soul, budding like a flower in the spring: happiness, of a sort. \"I do,\" he said, daring to plan ahead. He would take her down to his domain, yes, do that first; Zeus would have no choice but to grant him his marriage then. And if he did not, well...he could hole up in the ground for a while. The human souls would wait, and Zeus would not dare to enter the underworld. Hades could afford to be patient, so long as she would come and stay at his side. She giggled and turned from him then, quickly clambering up her tree with the daring impetuousness of youth. She reached for a pomegranate upon one of her many trees and smiled. She fumbled through her pocket until she found her flint knife, cutting one of the strangely shaped fruits and he caught it as the fruit tumbled into his hands. She bounded down next, and he reached for the flint knife, using it to open the fruit. A bright flash of red arils spilled forth in a bounty he could not boast in the underworld. \"As I said, uncle, we shall have a meal.\" She smiled, all dangerous, and held it out to her lips. He watched, all hunger, as she swallowed the first seed. \"Your turn, Hades.\" He liked it when she used his name and kissed her to encourage the use of it; she tasted tart from the juice and he licked at her lips as she giggled. \"This is serious,\" she murmured; he didn't care. He picked an aril out; it had been years since he had eaten anything but the food of the dead, and the juice that stained his fingers looked strange. It was obvious why she had chosen the fruit; fidelity, it meant, in the old tongue. And to eat the fruit of another god in their dwelling--well, he knew what she was offering. Even if Zeus refused to recognize their marriage, this binding would seal him to her glen, would make him as much a part of this place as she was. He ate it, and then it was her turn to kiss him; five more seeds they ate in that fashion, swapping the juices between them, the sour-sweet taste bursting on his tongue. When it was done, he handed the fruit's core back to her. \"I would have your answer, wild one.\" He already knew, of course, but he wanted to hear it out loud. Wanted to hear she had chosen him, him above all others. But the wilding knew that too, and the look in her eyes suggested more wickedness than mercy. \"It's a funny thing, uncle, the rules of a God's lair. Did you know that by supping of their sacred foods you bind yourself to them?\" His eyes darted toward her as she picked, carefully, upon the ruins of the fruit she had offered him. \"You're mine now, Mr. Third Estate.\" \"Clever minx,\" he said, pressing her into the tree. He has dreamed of this and he would have it; he pulled his arms under her knees and hoisted her up on it; she hadn't, to his surprise, bothered with her underthings; one quick movement and he would be in her again. Her eyes suggested she very much wanted that, and who was he to fight her on it? He nodded to her unspoken question, and she laughed. Her fingers slowly fiddled with his pants as he stared down at her with heavy eyes. \"You will have to do the same in my abode in six months time; I will give up six months above should you do the same below.\" He would have to convince her to allow him to go down for some time for work but well--with apologies to the dryad and the other lost souls--that was a talk they could be having later. Perhaps much later. He hissed in triumph as she managed to undo his pants, all by herself; she pushed them down and then cupped her hands around him. Oh stars, she was clever; so clever. She stroked him mercilessly, and he didn't look away as he grew between her fingers. \"We shall see,\" She hissed; his heart faltered for a moment, but the teasing smile in her eyes suggested she was only giving him a hard time. \"You did say it was rather gloomy, and you have given me six months of your time regardless. But I will visit, at least. If only to try out your bed,\" she murmured, pushing herself up enough to kiss him. \"Would you like that? Me in your bed?\" \"Our bed, Mrs. Third Estate, and yes, yes, yes, I would,\" he said, meeting her eyes as he guided himself into her. It was a bit premature to call her that without her parent's permission, perhaps, but he did not care. He adjusted his grip so he could hold her one-handedly, letting the tree do some of the lifting. With his other hand, he opened his palm, shadows roaring out of it. Her hand rose to meet it, life exploding out between their palms. As they closed them together, he darted forward to steal a kiss from her; fate rippled, and he felt the line of his fate cross with hers. He felt - everything. Everything they had ever been, everything they would be. He saw her in himself and he cried out not from the pleasure of her body but from the union of their minds. She was no less overcome, her moans as loud as his--and despite knowing they were putting on a show again, he really did not give a damn. He would need to leave soon, to deal with the dryad, and his duties, and of course, Zeus and Demeter above. But for now, he wanted only her, and all of her, as much as he could have. He let his shadows pour forth; and vines burst forth from her palms with quixotic grace, helping to support her against the tree as he took her. Demeter and Zeus would yield. He was stubborn enough to make them, and with her at his side, nothing would stop them. \"Hades,\" she murmured, wrapping her one hand around his neck. He kissed every bit of exposed skin he could in encouragement. \"You're mine, Hades, all mine.\" \"I am,\" he purred, burying himself as deep inside of her as he could, felt her pull him deeper still, wanting more. She was as insatiable as he was. He had learned long ago not to waste precious gifts when they presented themselves, and nothing was as precious as her. He felt their consciousness merge fully, felt the burgeoning love echoing between them, and for the first time--the first time in a very long time--he felt complete. Charon waited patiently, as he had been. That had been his job since time immortal; Hades--or Iapetus, before him--brought the souls, and Charon sent them down the river to the eternal fields. Circumstances, however, were trying the boatman's patience. Things had not gone the way they had for the past several thousands of years for the past few days, and Charon had no idea what to do. He had even gotten out of his boat, so unmoored was he; staring at the walls in Hades' halls, he felt no better. The nymph who had crashed upon his boat faired little better, waiting morosely upon the step of Hades' throne room. He felt more ill at ease than usual; not only was he not on his boat, but Lord Hades hadn't been back in nearly a fortnight, and the poor creature - well, he was getting awful tired of consoling her. There were only so many ways to say sorry, you're dead and he'd run out of all of them. \"Do you think he'll be soon?\" She asked. She had accepted her fate, at least; hopefully, Hades would send her to Asphodel or Tartarus or Elysium or well, frankly, anywhere, just so long as it wasn't in the Styx. Charon loved the old river goddess too much to see her further polluted with the girls' wailing. \"I'll take it up to Zeus if he isn't back within another day or two,\" he said, knowing he must and equally dreading it. He didn't like Olympus, never had once the usurpers took over. But Hades rarely spent an hour on the surface, and frankly despite his reticence, at two weeks his lack of reporting the man missing was sliding from negligent to inexcusable. \"That won't be necessary!\" Came a new voice, and he turned in surprise, eyes wide; a woman strolled in he'd not seen. Obviously Olympian - a curvy lass, with a sonorous voice and a crown of crystal flowers and thorns made of precious jewels. \"Are you Charon?\" \"Aye.\" He eyed her warily: she'd not come dressed for war--but a new God in the underworld was an atypical thing. She wasn't Hades and his duties lied with the man, not this interloper. \"Is Lord Hades with--?\" \"He's coming,\" she said, rolling her eyes. Her crown caught in the dim light as she stepped forward and his eyes widened: her crown had an ancient inscription, one that marked her as a realm-queen. Her attention turned to the little nymph, who was staring at her in as much fascination as Charon was. \"Oh my, are you a shade? I've never seen one.\" \"Are you...?\" The nymph looked as lost as he felt, but the universe righted itself slightly as Hades strolled in, a large bouquet of asphodel in his hands. At least, he thought it was the man; he looked as Hades did, but the permanent smile on his face was...not something he'd ever associated with the man, to put it mildly. \"Found some,\" he heard Hades say, and the nymph scrambled straight up, eager now for her final benediction. His boss bounded into the low light and Charon bit his cheek: it was Hades, alright, bounding into view with not only a goofy smile on his face but a flower crown on his head. He wasn't sure if Hades had hit his head upstairs something fierce, or if Charon had finally given up all sense of sanity at the thought of seeing what Zeus had done to Chronos' hallowed halls, but it was certainly a sight, either way. \"Charon! Good seeing you. Apologies for the delay.\" He nodded stiffly, watching as Hades turned toward the Olympian, wordlessly handing her six asphodel blossoms, as if that made sense. \"Eat up, wife,\" he said, tapping her shoulder. \"Wife?\" He looked up at the Olympian woman, then back at Hades, then back at the woman. He blinked. Well. That would explain the delay, he supposed. He hadn't realized the Olympians had been compelled to mate, but he could see why Hades picked this one. She radiated life and light. \"My...Queen?\" he said, trying the word on his tongue. It felt...odd. \"We'll see.\" The woman's eyes twinkled with Jovian mischief as she wove Hades' flowers carefully into her crown. \"And yes, I'm Persephone, Hades is my husband. I'm a goddess of spring. I'll be around from time to time.\" She looked around, squinting. \"Now, if you want me to be queen of this place, we're going to need to change the lighting situation in here. How did you ever find your way here without stumbling over yourself? Gods above, I was doing you mercy, trapping you up there.\" Charon raised an eyebrow. Trapping? The young ones had odd ideas of courtship, that was for sure. Had such a courtship been his lordship's choice? It was hard to imagine the little curvaceous thing could force someone as fearsome as Hades into anything. Hades looked at him and shrugged. \"It's a...well, it's a story.\" Hades said, and was it his imagination or did the underworld god look embarrassed? Probably some sort of coupling ritual. He wouldn't pry. He truly did not wish to know. \"Uhm, sir, could I...?\" The little nymph squeaked; Hades startled, visibly, and Charon again had to bite his cheek. Well, the missus would keep things from being boring, he supposed, if she could make Hades forget his duties. \"Of course!\" He grabbed his wife's arm and strode with her over to the little nymph. \"Wife, let me introduce you to the highest of my duties. This is one of our subjects, come to their final rest.\" He flexed his hand over the girl, his shadow--hand open; Charon always liked to watch Hades work, there was something calming about the shadows that poured forth. It reminded him nothing so much as his primordial home, deep within Gaea. To his surprise, Hades opened his other hand, and the little missus opened her own power and clasped it--he saw light, brilliant light, and suddenly there was a carpet of asphodels underneath their feet. He snorted, but no one noticed him, too caught in their own rituals. \"Do you see her time, darling?\" Hades voice sounded odd, echoing in the chamber. \"It was a long life.\" \"Yes.\" She stared at the nymph for a moment, and then turned, and Charon bit back a gasp at her eyes, so bright they were glowing with nascent power. \"Where should we put her wife? It was a good life, but not perfect. She hurt some, helped others.\" \"No person is perfect.\" She leaned into her husband. \"Why not give her Elysium? She died far from home, lost and confused. It was not her fault she wandered to my grove seeking shelter, and her suffering has surely equaled if not surpassed any trouble she has caused.\" She spoke like a realm-queen alright, Charon thought with a smirk. Hades broke the connection and smiled at his wife. \"Are you sure you're not the realm-queen here yet, darling? You speak with wisdom. I am in accord.\" He reached out and pressed his shadow palm over the nymph, who closed her eyes. \"Do try to enjoy Elysium, little one,\" he murmured, and then she was gone. \"You're in a good mood,\" Charon said. He took a few steps forward and placed an ancient hand on Hades' shoulder and laughed. \"Can I assume it's safe for me to resume my work now?\" He leaned in close to his lordship's ear and murmured, \"I'll uh...knock if uh...if I need ye.\" \"Ah, yes.\" Hades did not look him in the eye, already turning red at the cheeks. Newlyweds! They were all the same. \"That might be a good idea.\" \"A pleasure meeting you, my queen,\" he said, tipping his ancient cap; she did not correct his words. Good. He hoped she would stay. \"Now, husband,\" the girl purred as he left, and he could not help but smile as he left them to their work. \"Let's talk about getting some sunlight in here. Maybe some plants?\" Charon walked back through Hades' hall, happy to leave the newlyweds to their bliss. He tried to imagine what sunlight felt like on his skin; it had been eons since the war, and even then he'd spent most of it down here. Still, he wouldn't mind the little goddess too much, even if her ideas were strange. She seemed to judge well, at least, and he knew Hades well enough to know he had no doubt chosen his bride carefully. He certainly wouldn't desperately carry off the first woman who'd shot cupid's arrow at him, he was old enough to be beyond that. Someone in the throne room giggled and Charon laughed. Perhaps not too old to care about that, however! He didn't dare look, instead pulling open Hades' heavy iron doors and walking back to what he considered his only home. He grinned, already in a better mood as he took his welcome first steps into his boat. The Styx rocked around him in return. Ah, home. The boss was back, and now he was back where he should be, and everything was once again right with the underworld, even if it was a little different than it had been before. And that, he supposed, was welcome, or at least, tolerable. Anything that put the boss in a good mood, well - he supposed there was nothing wrong with that. Change in the underworld was an odd thing, but he would grow used to it. As long as he had his hands on his oars and the Styx under his feet, all would be alright.",

      "It was a chiton, too; he blinked in surprise--no one had worn one of those outside of Olympus in a good several centuries.",
      "But other than that her dress, the description of her was quite inaccurate: there was nothing child-like about her.",

      "Goblinchild, indeed; whoever Thanatos had gotten the information was either woefully out of date, or he had been misinformed.",
      "Neither was a good omen for this meeting.",
      "Nor was the young one's face, full of stern fury.",
      "\"Who are you?\"",
      "She asked; her head tilted forward in obvious wary pride.",
      "\"You are clearly theoi.",
      "Are you another of my father's suitors?",
      "I had thought it bad enough he offered me as a whore to the sea God.",
      "What does he send before me now, the God of vapor?",
      "Perhaps a God of whistling wind?",
      "Tell me, little god, how far have I fallen in my father's affections, that you have come for me?\"",
      "\"I am no paltry parlor-trick god.\"",
      "His lip curled in derision; so, Zeus did favor Poseidon over him.",
      "An annoyance, that, if unsurprising.",
      "They had always shared certain...traits.",
      "But that was not important now; it was time to set the child straight, so she could send him on his way.",
      "\"You speak to the third estate child, the lord of darkness himself, the God of all mortals.",
      "I am death itself, and I've not come to your sacred grove for anything beyond my duty.\"",
      "She stared at him for a moment, head tilted.",
      "He nodded self-consciously, expecting her to give him his leave.",
      "Every God turned from him once they were aware of what he was; death always made the deathless uncomfortable.",
      "Even his siblings had not been immune from that discomfort.",
      "But the goblin woman - for she was not a child, decidedly not a child - did something quite unexpected instead.",
      "She threw her head back and laughed.",
      "\"Your duty, uncle?",
      "I will give you this, your approach is unique.",
      "The others promised words of love and dowries.",
      "You have made it clear I am as important to you as mulch.",
      "I almost appreciate your honesty, though I am still insulted.\"",
      "He felt a flash of color pinken his cheeks.",
      "Barbaric woman!",
      "To think he had little better to do than to beg her father for a lackluster bride to drag to his bed, kicking and screaming.",
      "He would do nothing of the kind.",
      "\"I assure you, I have not come to beg for your mulch, as you say.",
      "I have come for a soul for my domain that happened to be tangled in these woods, nothing more.",
      "If you will allow me passage, I'll return to my cold realm and you may continue on rebelling against your lord father with my permission, little one.\"",
      "There was certainly little love lost between them now.",
      "Foolish of Zeus to play favorites, given their positions; Hades held a larger share than Poseidon ever would.",
      "She walked toward him with fluid grace; he swallowed involuntarily as her fingers lightly touched his chin.",
      "He said nothing as she turned his head one way, then the other; the gaze in her eyes was almost objectifying, and he was unused to such scrutiny.",
      "Was this the way lesser gods greeted their betters on Olympus now?",
      "He squirmed under the touch.",
      "Her eyes seemed to miss nothing, and when she took another step closer and brushed up against him, he took a step back.",
      "\"Why, I don't know why my father is so scared of you.\"",
      "She smiled, but there was nothing joking about it; the curve of her lips was cruel, and he knew her for Zeus' daughter then and there.",
      "\"You're only an old man.\"",
      "\"I suppose I am,\" he said, shrugging.",
      "He had been used to barbs enough from his brothers and sisters during the war, when they jostled for positions and glory.",
      "He had not cared then, and he certainly did not care now as to what this wild-woman thought of him.",
      "\"No protest?",
      "Hm.\"",
      "Her eyes flashed.",
      "\"It's very odd.",
      "You have the reputation of a powerful warrior, but...You seem as courageous as a dormouse.\"",
      "\"I had enough fighting in the war.\"",
      "He wearily shoved a hand past her, putting distance between them as he started to walk away.",
      "He was tired of her; if anything, it was only disappointing that she, too, seemed so focused on meaningless squabbling.",
      "He had hoped, perhaps, that she would appreciate the mortal realm as he did; that she, too, might spurn Olympus and all its wretched excess.",
      "He felt something on his ankle and tripped; the ignominious wretch!",
      "Biting back a curse, he gathered his power into his hands.",
      "If she was going to trip him, he would simply go south through the core as a shadow and arrive home that way.",
      "His hands pulsed and he felt himself begin to slip into his realm, but then the glow faded from him and he bit back a curse as he simply fell to the earth instead of through it.",
      "His mouth slammed into the dirt and he was too stunned to move.",
      "How had that happened?",
      "He felt himself dragged backward quickly, turned upside down before he could as much as blink.",
      "He glanced up and found a vine climbing quickly up his legs.",
      "So she had Demeter's gift after all, it seemed.",
      "The one gift able to repel his own, naturally.",
      "This time he did not hold back on the cursing.",
      "\"My my,\" she said, smiling.",
      "\"Uncle, to think you'd have such a tongue on you.\"",
      "\"Unhand me!\"",
      "He shouted with the full authority of his office, but she only smiled.",
      "He tried to glare balefully at her, but a glance up reminded him exactly of how short her chiton was, and for propriety's sake alone, he was forced to look away.",
      "\"Oh do swear again, that was wonderfully fun.",
      "Did you shout such in the war?",
      "Make the Titans all run away?\"",
      "She waved her fingers and the vines climbed; a pair split, neatly placing his broad hands in cuffs before he could even jerk away.",
      "\"Niece!\"",
      "He gripped at the vine, scowling; if the girl refused to stop being ridiculous, he would simply free himself.",
      "He did not need his powers to do so; he reached up to grab the vine and attempted to pull his arms apart.",
      "The vine grew in response, monstrously quick; one punctured his wrist and he stopped.",
      "\"Ah, I wouldn't do that.\"",
      "She knelt down, her face close enough to his own he could feel the heat of her breath on his chin.",
      "\"The pricks are poisonous when full grown, uncle.",
      "You'll induce a terrible fever ripping yourself free, if you even can.\"",
      "\"On what grounds do you hold me, child?\"",
      "He hissed; he tried to twist from side to side to wiggle free but the needle-welts embedded in his wrists only dug in further.",
      "He wondered how long it would take for the poison to take effect, assuming she wasn't bluffing.",
      "\"One, you interest me.\"",
      "She shrugged her shoulders.",
      "\"That's rare enough.",
      "Two, I figure you'll be a warning to any suitors that I'm not worth attempting to buy, since father is clearly getting desperate if he is offering his own daughter as a mere concubine to you.",
      "Three, you trampled my flower, so I'm well within my rights to demand recompense.\"",
      "\"Recompense?\"",
      "He sputtered; he looked toward the flower he had brushed against earlier and saw it had been smeared into the dirt when he'd stepped back; he sighed.",
      "That was unfortunate.",
      "\"Surely we can work out financial compensation-- \" \"Nope.\"",
      "She flicked her fingers, throwing him toward the tent, and he grimaced as he landed, hard, on a verifiable pile of brambles and vines.",
      "\"You're mine--for the moment, at least, Mr. Third-Estate.\"",
      "He gasped aloud; the pain of the punctures in his skin was minuscule, but the indignity of it all burned deep.",
      "Through great difficulty, he managed to glare at her.",
      "\"Stop this,\" he snarled; she shook her head, then turned her back on him, bending to the flower he had accidentally trampled in haste.",
      "He watched her wide hips as she bent down; the skirt on that chiton was distractingly short, he thought.",
      "That thought, however, was swallowed all too quickly in his outrage as he watched her hands gently touch the flower and instantly restore it to health.",
      "His blood pounded in his ears.",
      "\"For fuck's sake!\"",
      "\"Now, now.\"",
      "She walked back over to him and knelt beside him, putting her hands gently on his shoulders; her power flowed through him, healing his cuts and he gasped as her sweet life-current worked its magic.",
      "He opened his mouth, but no words fell out; how many years had it been since he'd been touched by anyone but ghosts desperately fighting not to be sent beyond?",
      "How long since he had felt even half so potent a current of power as this?",
      "He had forgotten what the touch of his own kind felt like.",
      "His heartbeat started to pound in alarm, and he wasn't entirely sure it was because of the poison she'd spoken of.",
      "\"You should be glad I am keeping you.",
      "You might be king of the stiffs, but you're the most entertaining company I've had in a long while.\"",
      "He felt another flood of heat flush through his face but for once, the leader of the third estate was silent.",
      "He did not move, awash in the sensation of being held by her hands.",
      "She squeezed his shoulders; his heart twisted in desire for her life-touch.",
      "She was, he had to admit, not entirely a horrible goblin.",
      "Still, he craved his freedom.",
      "\"What would your mother say if she saw you holding me like this?\"",
      "He asked, trying another tack.",
      "She smiled.",
      "\"She'd think you were going to carry me off to the underworld, you brute, and I'd managed to just barely defend myself by trussing you up like a Saturnalian boar.\"",
      "\"You forget I know your mother, and she knows I'm not capable of such a thing.\"",
      "He had gotten along well enough with Demeter, the last time he'd talked to her.",
      "Which was...he tried to remember.",
      "Certainly, Demeter had never visited his home below, and he had not seen her since she had had Persephone.",
      "He tried to remember how long ago that had been.",
      "Clearly, given her adulthood, it had been a while.",
      "He had not accompanied Persephone's birthing, for which he could hardly be blamed--his powers were never welcome near a birthing bed, though he'd collected many a mother and child in such circumstances.",
      "The last time he saw Demeter must have during the war, then but--for all their infighting, they had been close enough then, the six of them.",
      "Persephone's face blushed red, fury nakedly evident in those doe-eyes, and he rejoiced for a moment despite his predicament.",
      "He had called the woman on her cheeky lies.",
      "He would only have to wait for Demeter to arrive, and she would surely stop her hellion from doing further harm to a brother she had liked.",
      "\"My mother was raped by one of her brothers and abandoned by the other,\" the girl spat.",
      "\"Frankly, I doubt my mother would be surprised to hear of you resorting to the same.\"",
      "\"I....\" Hades' mind spun, trying to process this unexpected news.",
      "Clearly, the information he was gleaning was, at best, incomplete.",
      "He thought of his sister and felt shame; he had all but abandoned his sisters to his brothers, assuming their safety would be assured.",
      "He had assumed wrong, it seemed, and the knowledge that he had been so sure in his assumption that he had never even asked Demeter if she was alright chafed at him; she had been rude to him, sure, had spurned him even, perhaps...",
      "but as the eldest, he had his duties to care for his younger siblings and he had been negligent in them.",
      "\"I am not my brothers,\" he said, voice soft, but knew his denial sounded weak.",
      "\"It is not only your brothers,\" she hissed.",
      "\"Apollo and Hermes are much the same, always pleading love but losing interest as soon as they've stuck themselves deep.",
      "And did not your own dear father punish your mother for bearing his children?",
      "Did not your grandfather shove any troubles he had into dear grandmother Gaea?",
      "It is in your kind, sir.",
      "Gods are all cruel.\"",
      "\"Not I,\" he insisted, but she shook her head and stood.",
      "She seemed quite content to keep him trussed, and he wondered how long it would be until she would untie him.",
      "\"Please, let me go home to my land.",
      "I am a king and cannot long be parted from my realm.\"",
      "\"I do not think they will miss you so much.",
      "No one misses death.\"",
      "She smiled and patted him on his head in an almost condescending manner.",
      "Before he could complain, she silenced him by tracing her fingertips down his ear to his chin.",
      "He could not help but feel the warmth of her hand and found himself damningly eager to lean into it.",
      "He frowned; he could not remember being so affected by a simple stroke of a hand, but then, when was the last time someone had touched him in anything other than fear?",
      "\"I'll be back,\" she murmured; her hand stroked down his neck and he did not miss the way her eyes glimmered with interest when she brushed against the edge of his throat.",
      "\"Where are you going?\"",
      "He asked, grimacing at the huskiness in his tone; it was entirely the wrong sort of reaction, and he couldn't figure why, exactly, he was having it for this woman.",
      "She was pleasing to the eye, sure, but it wasn't as if she had treated him as anything beyond, well, mulch.",
      "\"Well, for one, to kiss my lady mother goodnight.",
      "Three's a crowd.\"",
      "She did not wait for his response to that, cackling wildly.",
      "\"Also, to ask her for the antidote to the poison you've just injected yourself within your struggling, uncle.",
      "And I should think you would like some supper.",
      "I know I would.\"",
      "She waved as she took off, flowers trailing from her swinging hips - no he would not focus on those hips, comely though they were.",
      "She disappeared rapidly into the deep woods that led the path back to the underworld - and to Mount Olympus, too.",
      "He sighed, twitching in his seat.",
      "He could only imagine Charon's roaring laughter if the boatman could see him now.",
      "And the poor nymph!",
      "Now the dryad would be waiting even longer; perhaps it would give her time to accept her fate.",
      "He grunted, trying again to slip the bonds by slipping back to shadow, but the wildling's vines held fast.",
      "So long as he was being held by a god of who could control life, it appeared he wouldn't be able to return to the land of the dead.",
      "His powers were, quite neatly, useless.",
      "He could perhaps slip through his restraints if he managed to destroy the vine, but if he tore the vine in twain, he'd puncture himself a thousand times more than he already had.",
      "Time would tell if the wild one's claim that the vine was poisonous was a bluff.",
      "He stared up into the sunlight, wondering if Zeus was laughing his ass off at him from on high.",
      "He had thought if he was captured by an enemy, his brother would strain to help him, but now he could see all too clearly that help was not forthcoming from Olympus.",
      "He frowned, wondering how long she would be.",
      "He had little he could do but wait, it seemed.",
      "He tried to wriggle against the vines on his legs, but she had not slackened the vines' hold at all; he would surely be sore if she was gone long, but...nothing to be done, he supposed.",
      "He closed his eyes and waited.",
      "Time passed, though he was not aware of how much.",
      "It could have been hours; it could have been days--his kind needed little food, and he took no rest.",
      "All he knew was that he was miserable.",
      "Slowly, the poison's effect came into bloom; it started as little more than a sudden, scratchy heat on his skin.",
      "At first, he thought it merely the long exposure as Helios' chariot made its way across the sky, but no; even as the sun dipped into the horizon, his skin felt as if he was on fire.",
      "He groaned as sweat started to drip from his face onto his suit jacket; he couldn't even wipe it off, not being trussed like this.",
      "He watched the shadow of the sun as it set, using a tree in the distance as an impromptu sundial.",
      "He thought of yelling out, but there was little point in it; the island was still damnable silent, and all he could hear was the lap of waves distantly upon a shore.",
      "No birds, no animals.",
      "Nothing but the quiet of the glen.",
      "Nothing but his own thoughts to keep him company.",
      "He shivered, despite the heat piercing through his body, burning as if Helios' himself has set his hand--well, never mind where.",
      "Hades gasped, breath ragged, wondering what that thought came from.",
      "It wasn't as if he'd ever had any interest in that bright braggart.",
      "Or anyone else, he thought; he wished he could tug at his collar, because suddenly his clothing felt a lot more confining...oh.",
      "Wonderful.",
      "He stared into the vines tangling around his wrists, trying to guess at what the species was to have such a potent effect on a deathless one.",
      "Demeter had offered him lessons in identifying flora during their childhood, but he had always been too busy trying to keep them all alive to take her up on it.",
      "Foolish; he could not name it.",
      "He tried to wiggle his toes and didn't miss the sudden fission of heat that seemed to travel straight to his cock.",
      "Why, he was even half-turgid already, all just from the awareness of his own body.",
      "When had that last happened?",
      "He was long past such sudden stirrings at his age.",
      "He laughed, officially so far gone he was now amused by how far he'd fallen.",
      "To think if Demeter's daughter could see him now.",
      "The thought of her led to another surge in his cock and he sighed.",
      "She was a good looking thing, no denying that, especially in this frame of mind.",
      "The wide splay of her hips, the gold flecks of her eyes...he grunted.",
      "It was almost a good thing he was tied up; he doubted he could resist staring up her chiton now.",
      "Hmph.",
      "He smiled; this was ironic.",
      "She'd accused his kind of being little more than rutting beasts and now he could think of little else than fucking her.",
      "He tried to think of other things as the light dimmed once more, but the hellion kept popping into his thoughts.",
      "What would she be like, he wondered?",
      "His skin itched as feverish dreams played through his mind.",
      "He wondered if she would prefer to be on top; he would let her, right now, his status be damned.",
      "Let the wild one take her pleasure from him, he would give it willingly.",
      "Even bound like this, if she wanted it.",
      "She hadn't entwined one of her many vines over his cock after all, and those lithe, quick fingers could surely undo his pants as fast as she could notch her bow.",
      "He moaned and shook his head, tried to concentrate on the tree ahead of him, but the thoughts quickly turned to Demeter's daughter and how it might feel to have her against that tree; had she even known the touch of a man?",
      "Would she let him have her, wrap those wide legs around him as he thrust her into the trunk?",
      "She was certainly old enough to have experienced her first flowering, but then again, she'd rejected no end of suitors...which made the thought that she'd even entertain him even more ridiculous.",
      "But then, she had touched him, even after knowing what he was.",
      "And her fingertips were so light and so, so...fates above, stop it.",
      "He was the oldest of his brothers, and lusting in a way that would make Zeus ashamed.",
      "A new low point in his life, which had mostly been low points, if he was being honest.",
      "She would hold little interest in a man as old as he was.",
      "But then again, she had touched him, had even smiled at him... and what would such a smile look like on her, if she was clad only in all her naked glory?",
      "A right wicked smile it would be, he'd bet.",
      "What would those lips look like, if she used them on him?",
      "He tried to imagine kissing them swollen, but the thoughts all too quickly took a turn south, with her imaginary lips blazing a trail to the miserably hard head of his cock.",
      "The tension in him was becoming almost unbearable; he was iron hard now, erection straining at the seams, and he would take the little one's laughing if it meant that she'd let his hands go free enough to at least touch his cock.",
      "\"Uncle!\"",
      "He heard, and grimaced; stars above, was it too much to hope the accursed poison would run through his system before she got back?",
      "He folded his cuffed hands awkwardly over his erection and tried to focus on his niece's words as she bounced back over to him, and not the soft smile that rounded the wildling's lips.",
      "Fates, they were the plumpest things, those lips, so soft he could not resist leaning forward toward her, yearning for a kiss....what was he thinking?",
      "He jerked his neck back quickly, no doubt looking the fool, but he didn't care.",
      "This was ridiculous.",
      "\"Looks like you're in a bit of a rough patch,\" she said, surprisingly gently.",
      "Her voice was a little husky, and something in his stomach flipped in ridiculous hope.",
      "Her surprisingly warm hand touched his head and he winced.",
      "He no doubt felt disgusting and beyond that, her touch sent even more fire through his veins, and it was already going to a place that was already far too aflame for his liking.",
      "His hips bucked on instinct at the touch, desperate to mate her.",
      "Fates, he could do it, could have her.",
      "She was so close...",
      "\"Anti...dote?\"",
      "He asked, whimpering at his own weak voice.",
      "\"I've brought it.",
      "Though first...\" she dabbed at his skin with a soft cloth and he whimpered, quite sure if she dipped her fingers any lower than his neck that he would, in fact, be in such pain he could very well die despite being deathless.",
      "\"Let's get you cleaned up a bit.",
      "My, how you've been sweating, uncle.",
      "Is the afternoon sun so harsh in your strange clothing?",
      "I did think it odd.\"",
      "The fact that no one in the outside world had worn a chiton in centuries seemed lost on the girl, though he was too preoccupied to voice the thought as she ran the cloth over his chin, heading downwards... \"Don't.\"",
      "He shook his head vigorously.",
      "\"Please.\"",
      "\"Uncle, stop being such a child.\"",
      "She murmured, but her hand skimmed his chin as she withdrew.",
      "She seemed to enjoy touching him; that was decidedly not helping him in this ailment.",
      "She pulled something from her belt and he saw a small bottle filled with a sort of murky sap; he did not hesitate to part his lips as she brought it to his lips.",
      "\"I must say, I'm surprised to see my little vine affect you so.",
      "Is a bit of itching so much as to make you so miserable?",
      "How is it my father is so deathly afraid of you he bans us all from so much as broaching upon your door when you can't handle a harmless little scratch?\"",
      "He said nothing, only exhaling as sucked down the contents of the bottle.",
      "His pride had had enough injury for the day; he was desperate only now for the antidote before he did something they'd both regret.",
      "She tilted it back with a semi-bemused expression on her face, but he did not care; he swallowed every drop of the disgusting muddy sap.",
      "\"How long?\"",
      "He asked.",
      "\"Until the itching stops?\"",
      "She shrugged and ran her cloth over his mouth, wiping up the bits of sap that clung to the edges of his mouth.",
      "Her fingers lingered a bit longer on his lips than they should, and he moved his head slightly forwards.",
      "She seemed not to notice.",
      "\"Probably fifteen minutes, maybe twenty at most, uncle.\"",
      "\"And the rest?\"",
      "He panted; he cared not at all about a small bit of itching.",
      "That was livable.",
      "The desire to mate, however, was driving him mad.",
      "She was so beautiful, stars; those lips pursed and he thought of nothing but wanting to kiss them, to claim - \"The rest?\"",
      "She tilted her head, obviously confused.",
      "\"I'm afraid I don't understand.\"",
      "\"The....\" He tried to think of a way to speak of his ailment that wasn't sure to induce her mockery.",
      "Why did she insist on playing dumb?",
      "\"The other effects.\"",
      "\"Other?\"",
      "She stared at him a moment, lips pursed with curiosity that made him think of nothing as to what she could be doing with them.",
      "\"What other effects?",
      "Are you alright?\"",
      "Much to his alarm, she swung herself into his lap before he could explain.",
      "She held onto his face and frowned as she looked into his eyes and tried to find the discerning cause.",
      "The vines, he noticed dimly, moved out of her way, realigning themselves to restrain him without impeding her.",
      "His hands were pulled away from his paltry disguise, pulled down to the ground at his sides.",
      "He couldn't move, could do nothing to stop her as she conducted her investigation.",
      "He hissed as she leaned up against him - and her eyes widening suggested she found his - ah.",
      "The look in her eyes suggested surprise...but not disgust.",
      "\"Oh,\" she said; she wiggled against him in a way that sent every nerve throbbing and he saw stars.",
      "He tried to move his hands to push her away, but the accursed vine's binding held firm.",
      "She stared at him with wide, stunned eyes and he winced.",
      "He took back every one of his regrets he'd ever listed as the worst in his life; this had now surpassed them all.",
      "He bet Zeus had probably invited Poseidon over to his heavenly perch, and they were both watching him with eyes wet from laughing so hard at his expense.",
      "\"This poison...you see its effect, I trust,\" he murmured, and tried not to notice the spark of what looked close to intrigue in her eyes.",
      "She nodded slightly; her lips fell open slightly.",
      "Her hand grazed his chest with just the lightest of touches, and he watched with painfully transfixed attention as her tongue skimmed over the tip of her lips.",
      "\"Does it hurt?\"",
      "She asked, in a low voice that was almost husky.",
      "He raised an eyebrow, carefully looking at her: she was keeping herself pressed so tightly against him he could feel her pulse beating fast against her skin.",
      "And it was beating very, very fast indeed.",
      "\"Agony,\" he admitted; she rolled her hips again and he hissed as his skin burst into flame underneath her.",
      "For a moment, they stared at one another; he could not think of what to say to make this better, and the wilding seemed equally taken with silence.",
      "Then, quick as a lark, she took action: she grabbed his hair with an iron grip that would put his own to shame, and yanked his head forward into a painful kiss.",
      "He whimpered, unable to stop the needy noises coming out of his mouth as she claimed him.",
      "His hips thrust desperately against her damnably clothed hips as she held onto him like a vice; it hurt, stars above it hurt so much, the feel of her on his skin, bewitching and bedeviling.",
      "He wanted to hold her, but all he could do was kiss her, kiss as much of her as he could, and he feared that would not be enough to sate him.",
      "She seemed to be of the same ailment, furiously kissing him with every gasp of breath she uttered.",
      "She eased his mouth open into an open-mouthed kiss, demanding more.",
      "Her loving was viciously tender and he wanted every bit of it she would give him.",
      "Damn his inability to move or he would respond in kind!",
      "The vixen bit down on his lip, and he tilted his head as close to her as he could in response, wishing he could use his hands instead of having to simply chase her with feather-light kisses.",
      "She pushed harder against him, deepening the kiss, and he moaned.",
      "It was a grand kiss, vicious and savage and natural and godly.",
      "She was no great love-smith--she pressed hard, her lips inexperienced--but he did not care.",
      "\"You are in a big, bad way, uncle,\" she purred into his ear as her hand slithered down to his pants, grazing his heavy cock underneath the cloth with the lightest of touches.",
      "That made him groan; he tried to hold back, but his neediness only came out as a strangled curse instead.",
      "His head swam; she was receptive, he could touch her, could mate her.",
      "Her hands slid over his pants, squeezing the aching hardness within, and he kissed her as hard as he could, hips bucking against her.",
      "She withdrew only a second later, but the harsh sound of his buckle as she struggled to open it gave him a sudden moment of clarity.",
      "What was he doing?",
      "He shouldn't stay here, shouldn't do this, this was Demeter's daughter, his sister's daughter, Zeus' daughter for all that was holy.",
      "He was in an alliance so lightly held that a mere spark could set it all aflame, and the girl was a match burning upon his fingertips.",
      "\"You have such strange clothes, uncle,\" she murmured, tugging insistently on his belt.",
      "She pursed her swollen lips and looked at him, a small smirk upon that wicked face, and he knew he would be lost if she got it open.",
      "\"S-stop,\" he murmured.",
      "She did; surprise etched in her wide eyes.",
      "They were beautiful eyes, they were, and he wondered what those golden-flecked eyes would look like when he made her come with his --stop.",
      "No",
      ". Down, he commanded, though his cock happily disobeyed him.",
      "\"Shouldn't.",
      "Not right, you're...I'm...it's not right.\"",
      "Several emotions flashed across her face, too quickly for him to identify all of them but hurt was there, surprisingly, in a flash of lowered eyes and bitten lips and he--he wouldn't think of what that meant, not right now.",
      "He pressed a final kiss to the tip of her forehead, hoping it would smooth things over.",
      "She held out her hands to grab the vines holding his arms, a more innocent form of torture.",
      "He felt her start to loosen the vines that had held him, and panic seized at his heart.",
      "\"Don't.\"",
      "He looked down, frustrated.",
      "\"Please.\"",
      "\"You're very confusing, old man.\"",
      "Her voice had gone back to the clipped and icy tones of their original encounter, and somehow, despite knowing he was the cause of the change, he regretted it all the same.",
      "\"You intrude on my garden, crush my perfectly nice new flower, act like you're crazed with desire and seduce me only to tell me to back off, and now when I try to let you go--you're yelling at me not to.\"",
      "She laughed as Zeus did, mocking and cruel.",
      "\"I am sorry to have met you, uncle.",
      "I now see why my father--\" \"Persephone,\" he said; he leaned his head out toward her, but she did not come any closer, though she did not drop his hand.",
      "\"It is not...with this upon me, I...",
      "I am feverish for your touch.",
      "If you let me go, I may take more than that.",
      "I have been stung by Eros' arrow, and I do not know how well I will be able to hold myself back from the poison that courses through my veins.\"",
      "\"You are trying my patience.\"",
      "She snorted.",
      "\"That's not something you get from my little vine-weeds, uncle.",
      "I'm not that unkind.",
      "It might make you sneeze and scratch, but this,\" she cupped his cock for a second, and he winced, biting back the overwhelming urge to lean into her fingers.",
      "\"This is all you.",
      "I was willing to go along with your seduction, but I'll not accept blame for your own desires.\"",
      "\"I swear to you it is not a ploy.\"",
      "He grimaced as her hand went back to the safer ground near his arm.",
      "\"You may ask your mother and your sisters how I have treated them.",
      "Never have I so much as touched them in such a way.",
      "I am not my brothers.",
      "I am...\" He chuckled, but there was no mirth in it.",
      "\"Just an old man, long alone.\"",
      "\"You have all the great mortals of the world in your domain; I do not imagine it is hard for you to find talented courtesans to warm your bed.\"She sniffed, but he caught the waver in her voice, the way her hands clenched his arm.",
      "She was willing to be persuaded, she was vulnerable to his seduction.",
      "What was he saying?",
      "His head was swimming--he shouldn't be persuading her of anything, let alone seducing.",
      "He needed a safe topic.",
      "Preferably not focused on rutting.",
      "\"You have not seen my domain.\"",
      "He shrugged as best he could with his limbs so heavily bound.",
      "\"Not that I blame you, it is a dark and cold place.",
      "The shades of the dead are simply that--shadows.",
      "Have you ever tried to grasp a shadow?",
      "Even if I go into the shadow realm myself, they slide through me as I do through them.",
      "It is not...possible, to mate one.\"",
      "He realized, dimly, that he brought the subject back to sex without even meaning to--it seemed all but impossible to think of anything else.",
      "\"That sounds convenient.",
      "Too convenient.\"",
      "She sighed.",
      "\"Plenty of your ilk have lied when it suited you.",
      "Apollo himself told me when he last visited that he would invent a new musical instrument if only I would show him my breasts for inspiration as to its shape.\"",
      "The thought of Zeus' musical whelp artlessly flirting with Persephone made him feel irritated in a way that made him uncomfortable, and he brushed it away.",
      "\"You saw my behavior earlier.",
      "If I wished to mate you without your blessing, goddess, I'd have done it then.",
      "I told you I was no threat and asked to leave your domain, if you will recall.\"",
      "\"Do you still wish to leave?\"",
      "She asked, her voice unexpectedly soft, and he tilted his head in confusion at the sudden turn in her mood.",
      "\"I know I can be wicked, but...Is my company so horrid to you?",
      "I...I did bring supper.\"",
      "She reached into a pocket of her chiton she'd clearly stitched into the fabric, and pulled out two perfect red apples.",
      "There was a surprising amount of vulnerability in her then for she blushed as fiercely as the prize she held in her hands; he wondered, had she pulled this trick on her other suitors?",
      "Was this another trap, another way to keep him captive or torture him with strange but potent plants?",
      "His mind was too preoccupied with her touch at the moment to focus on anything but her hands, even knowing the dangers lurking within her.",
      "\"It...is not horrid.\"",
      "He wished he could squeeze her hand, but--hands bound, he could only persuade her with his words.",
      "\"Not horrid.",
      "I...\" Sure, she had held him captive, but...she had touched him with nary a hesitance over doing so; kissed him as if he was something worth kissing, and not an old man to be feared.",
      "She had been the first to dare to look at him as more than a mere inconvenience in centuries.",
      "And that mattered more, much more; in his love-addled mind, her touch had become all-encompassing.",
      "\"That...The last few minutes have been most enjoyable.\"",
      "\"Then...\" She grasped the vines holding his arms and tugged all at once; each flowered, then wintered, then split, falling to the ground as an explosion of flowers.",
      "\"What are you doing?!\"",
      "He roared; she did not turn away from her task; with a slide of her hand, the flowers returned to the earth, and he was left rubbing his wrists.",
      "She smiled shyly and leaned forward, pressed a kiss to his stunned lips, and this time his hand slid around her, his brain struggling to come back to life after being thoroughly stunned.",
      "Now he was able to grip her hips proper and bring her into a far better position to rub up against his cock and oh, stars above, the friction between them!",
      "His hands were everywhere upon her; bad idea, a part of his brain whispered, but then she bucked against him again and what wisdom he had left was gone.",
      "\"I will have you if you continue like this, vixen,\" he murmured in a low voice; damn Zeus, and damn Demeter, too.",
      "The writhing enchantress on his lap was all he could think of; consequences were something he would deal with later.",
      "His wildling groaned in response, and then drowned what was left of his mind in more kisses, a rapid fire of kisses; his lips felt sore from the aching need of her and when she rolled her hips on top of him it proved nearly his undoing; his hand clasped at the fibula on her shoulder until his knuckles turned white.",
      "Her fingers were not idle, either.",
      "He heard the click of his belt and broke his grip on her dress to help her undo it, sliding it from his waist and tossing it into the grass as if it was a snake.",
      "His fingers fumbled as he tried to push off the far-too-hot coat he'd been wearing for hours, and he snarled.",
      "Cooler, thinner fingers came to assist, and as his sister's daughter came to help him, he kissed her, the world sliding off its axis as her lips claimed him again, then again.",
      "She seemed as hungry as he was, and he did not think he could have his fill of her.",
      "Despite the considerable distraction of their kissing, she pulled the offending coat down with a quick tug; he tossed it behind him out into the open air.",
      "He needed more, needed to touch her more; needed his skin on her skin and now.",
      "Persephone was evidently of the same mind, as her fingers joined his at his buttons on his shirt; she worked from the bottom while he fumbled through the top and nothing, nothing could stop him from loudly moaning into her mouth as she pulled it off of his shoulders and her soft skin made contact with his own.",
      "Better, but still - not enough.",
      "\"Off,\" he murmured, tugging at her dress; she reached up and undid her chiton's brooch herself, and he kissed the soft, brown skin of her shoulder as she slipped it off, undraping the fabric from one arm, then the other.",
      "She slipped the entire garment off then, and he blinked in present surprise; she hadn't bothered wearing any sort of breast binding, and oh, what a lovely vision she was with only her smallclothes barely restraining her modesty.",
      "He hadn't noticed her breasts at first, his focus far too preoccupied in favor of her wide hips, but now he could kick himself for missing them.",
      "They were a fine set; rich as ichor in color, only slightly paler than the rest of her.",
      "He wanted, more than anything, to touch her; his hand dipped to lightly caress one and it was not enough.",
      "He could not resist having a taste of her.",
      "He bent his head low to capture one of her soft, brown peaks within his mouth and enjoyed very much the sudden wail he eeked out of her.",
      "He suckled like a man possessed, and felt her iron grip return to his hair, keeping him focused on her.",
      "His other hand pinched at the other breast, and when she let up her grip after a moment, he switched.",
      "Her breath sped up, and his pulse with it, and for a few moments, despite his protesting cock that pounded for release, he preoccupied himself purely on her pleasure, switching back and forth between pinching and suckling, enjoying each and every little cry the wildling ground out at his ministrations.",
      "\"Oh fates,\" she moaned in a breathy whisper; his hands gripped tight on her small-clothes; like her dress, they were an older style, but he remembered how to unknot the linen, and even with the distraction of her lovely, lovely breasts, he managed to free her from the fabric without looking, tossing it aside as she all but threw herself into getting his pants off.",
      "\"Off,\" she moaned into his mouth with a desperate zeal; he separated from her and she whimpered, and that sound made him move as if the furies themselves had commanded him; he kicked off his shoes, pulled down the pants and moved his hips upward; shimming out of them in a method that was unrefined but efficient, disposing of his underpants with it.",
      "He tossed those clothes with the rest, and by the time he'd kicked it all away and realized how ridiculous he must look, stamen wagging in the wind, she was next to him, her arm touching his own.",
      "He studied her for half a second; she was a sacred thing, sitting in the grass next to him, a soft blush on her cheeks and her hand carefully touching his.",
      "\"Stars above, you are a beautiful woman,\" he murmured and was satisfied to see her blush a soft red in response.",
      "\"How do you want to...?\"",
      "He asked, breathlessly; she blushed a fiercer shade, and before she could answer, he decided she was so lovely he couldn't help but kiss her, because kissing her tasted like nectar and it was hard for him to go even seconds without her in this frame of mind.",
      "Her hand roamed further south, exploring him slowly, trailing down his waist and when her hand closed around his cock in brief and blessed relief, it was all he could do not to mount her then and there.",
      "\"I...I don't know,\" she murmured; his head swam in options, and he mulled them over as he planted a fresh trail of kisses to her ear.",
      "It was odd she had no preference; the wilding had been nothing less than bossy up to this point, but he did not mind taking the lead.",
      "He blazed a hot trail of kisses down her neck and she did not protest when his hand gently brushed her legs apart and slowly stroked her sex for the first time.",
      "She was soft; so soft, it made him suck in a harsh breath.",
      "When his finger managed to slip from her lips to her entrance, he was pleasantly surprised; she was already quite wet.",
      "She squirmed against him, whimpering, and oh how his heart seized at the thought of mating her like this.",
      "\"Do you like to be touched like this, beautiful?\"",
      "He asked her; she bucked against him, answering with her hips instead of her mouth.",
      "He chuckled into her throat, sucking at it; he was enjoying the wildlings distress almost as much as she did.",
      "If he was clearer headed, he'd want to do this to her for hours; show her how patient death could be as he eeked more and more little mewls out of her.",
      "But today, his hot blood all but boiled in his veins; he was already straining to contain himself, but oh--he wanted to see her lose control, too.",
      "He separated from her for a second, only in as long as it took to lie down on his back on the ground.",
      "The wildling swung her legs around him; she needed no instruction there, the flawless minx.",
      "She ran her long fingernails down his chest in a move that sent him shivering.",
      "She moved to align them, already ready to take him; he shook his head, stopped her movement with the clap of his hands around her hips.",
      "\"Not yet,\" he murmured; her lips pursed, confused, but when he gently pushed her forward instead, she blushed a deep cherry-red, as if someone had stained her cheek with wine.",
      "\"Let me have a taste of you, sweetling,\" he said, his voice unable to hide his desire; more than anything, he wanted to taste her.",
      "She did not comment on his voice breaking.",
      "She parted her legs quite willingly and he smirked; she hadn't mentioned a word about being uncomfortable on top, and he suspected she would not, even if it was improper given their status--he outranked her in every way.",
      "But then, he had never seen so bossy a creature as her before and much to his surprise, he quite liked it--in this state, anyway.",
      "Her thighs landed on either side of his head and he wasted no time in moving his mouth to sample her.",
      "He kept his hands on her hips, urging her to move.",
      "He liked the feel of her comely hips in his hand; good to grip, good to hold, good to feel the flutter of life in hands so long used to holding nothing but ether.",
      "He kissed her most reverent place carefully, tongue lapping at her core with a gentleman's grace.",
      "Slow, slow, slow; go slow, he tried to tell himself, even if it was torture.",
      "He managed to start slowly, tongue gently probing her slit; she leaned into him, hips moving on instinct.",
      "Good.",
      "She tasted like copper and...mint?",
      "A sort of herbaceous flavor he struggled to place, but knew that he only wanted more of.",
      "He slowly probed her opening with his tongue, felt the sharp inhale of her breath even from between her thighs; she was a tight thing and did not allow him entrance easily.",
      "Her hips rocked back, breaking contact.",
      "She uttered a shaky breath, and his hands directed her to come back.",
      "When she moved forward again after a moment, he licked a long trail from her center to the soft nub at the tip of her sex; that made her thighs clench around his face and he moaned, overwhelmed by the sensation of her.",
      "He kept his tongue's pressure upon it as much as he could, writing old, ancient words into her that had long since lost meaning in this world and his own.",
      "She writhed above him, her hips and thighs damp with sweat.",
      "The wildling's hips were truly wild now, moving of their own volition entirely as he licked at her, endlessly hungry; her scent was more glorious nectar than anything he'd supped upon on Olympus.",
      "He should, he knew, show her mercy.",
      "He backed off for a few seconds, swiped lower, angled to slide further into her entrance, trying to stretch her open with his tongue gently at first, then harder, faster; her hand wound through his hair and tugged insistently, yanking his mouth back toward her clit.",
      "With a soft laugh, he complied.",
      "He didn't even mind the loss of control; he liked that he knew what she wanted, and he was more than willing to reward her for it.",
      "His head swam as he went for the kill, sucking at her clit as if worlds depended on it.",
      "She murmured something low that he couldn't hear, tucked between her thighs; his fingers pressed down on her hips instead, gripping her tight.",
      "Her noises grew louder, her thighs trembling; he felt it, encouraged it.",
      "He clamped his hands down hard to hold her hips down so he could take her up to the peak and over.",
      "The wail she emitted when she finally came tumbling down for him was almost painful to his ears, even sheltered by her thighs, but it was the most lovely music he'd heard.",
      "He stroked her skin reassuringly, licking each aftershock to drink her down as much as he can.",
      "She broke contact again, moving backward; before he could so much as blink, she grabbed him by his silver hair, pulled his mouth up to hers for a sloppy kiss.",
      "He was, perhaps, less gentle than he could be; his mouth chased hers hungrily, unable to break contact for more than a few seconds.",
      "\"Your face is wet,\" she murmured between kisses.",
      "He didn't bother to reply, ducked down to nip at her throat.",
      "Her hands wrung through his damp hair as he nibbled more at her lovely neck, then chased the bite with soft kisses.",
      "Oh yes, he would mark her; would mark her as his so every time she looked upon any reflective surface, she would see his bite upon her neck.",
      "She slid down him quickly, readjusting until she was straddling his lap.",
      "She was all confidence now, rubbing her folds against him, and oh, the view there was so good he moved so that he could see her better.",
      "The underworld would look particularly dull in comparison to this for...for perhaps ever, he thought, compared to the glory of his little life-goddess.",
      "She was glorious, hunched above him like an Amazon waiting for the kill.",
      "\"You play a dangerous game, sweetling,\" he murmured, but in truth, he could not protest against the view or the angle.",
      "\"Always.\"",
      "She looked at him with a heavy, daring look, no longer joking.",
      "He moved a bit to to align himself with her, and pressed the head of his cock to her entrance; had he been in a better state of mind, he would have held this for a while, teased her, savored the feel of her against him.",
      "But today, the ichor in his veins was all but rioting.",
      "He rose up to better see himself disappear slowly into her, but the wilding, ever one to take advantage, leaned over him and bit, hard, at his neck, and he lost the final dregs of his remaining control.",
      "He slammed himself down inside her, burying himself to the hilt in one quick motion.",
      "She drew in a heavy and harsh intake of breath and he stilled.",
      "She wasn't moving, and in truth, he wasn't sure if he should.",
      "He hadn't meant to take her so fast, and he was suddenly all too aware it might have been painful.",
      "When he looked up at her, she was biting her lips, clearly straining, but she did not ask him to pull out, either.",
      "\"Am I too much for you, little one?\"",
      "She shook her head and exhaled.",
      "\"No, but...fuck.\"",
      "She wriggled her hips lightly and squeezed him with inner muscles that made him all but roil underneath her; he stroked at her hips slowly as she took one deep breath, then two.",
      "She was tight; just being inside her made his mind swim.",
      "She started to rise off of him and he groaned, keeping himself still and letting her set the pace.",
      "Up, slow; down, slower still.",
      "But he was inside her, and that was a heady thing indeed.",
      "\"Good girl, keep moving, just like that,\" he purred; she squeezed him with an involuntary shiver of her muscles, and his eyes all but rolled back in his head.",
      "\"You feel so good, beautiful.\"",
      "He had thought that the poison would abate when he was awash in her tight body, would leave him after he'd finally had what had desired most.",
      "It had not.",
      "Instead, it had amplified; all he could feel was her: the slow movements of her hips, the squeeze of his cock by her tight cunt, the brush of her thighs against his.",
      "Zeus and their entire horrible family could be standing in a circle around them offering criticisms on his technique, and he doubted he would notice for one second.",
      "She put two hands on his chest; he hissed as her hands grazed against his nipple.",
      "She moved up, down; faster, settling into a rhythm now, taking her pleasure on him.",
      "He dared to thrust his hips up a bit and she grinned, a right wicked grin every bit as lovely as what he had fantasized about when he'd been only dreaming of having her.",
      "\"Still good?\"",
      "She asked, her voice surprisingly vulnerable.",
      "\"Very good,\" he murmured.",
      "She moved her hips as he matched her pace, slowly but insistently starting to rut her.",
      "She leaned forward more, her mouth coming close enough he could kiss her, but she ducked past his lips with only the slightest whisper, instead moving to the side and kissing his ear.",
      "\"I have death in me,\" she whispered into his ear, childish bragging evident in her ragged voice.",
      "\"So you do,\" he admitted, stroking her cheek.",
      "She moved forward enough to suckle at his bite and he cock surged at that; she intended to mark him.",
      "He groaned and thrust deep; the new angle was a bit more shallow and he wanted more.",
      "Needed more.",
      "He grabbed her ass and thrust deeper and deeper, furiously bottoming himself out and setting a pace that at best could be described as punishing for them both.",
      "She moaned.",
      "Her mouth fell open with a heavy-lidded gaze; he wondered if she could see how pleasurable he found her, for certainly he could tell looking at her that she was quite enjoying him.",
      "After a moment of staring into one another's eyes, she kissed him, and his control of his powers faltered; he opened his palms up to her, shadow-power pulsing within.",
      "That - that was too much for what would be surely a one night stand, and yet, he could not stop himself from doing it.",
      "To involve powers was to go beyond the mortal mechanics of the act, to offer her a god's embrace--it was a dangerous thing, a combination of their powers, and there was no telling what they could create.",
      "But the wildling--she only lived up to her name.",
      "She took one look at the shadows smoking from his palms and pressed her palms on top of it, a verifiable explosion of flowers growing out of the mist between their fingers.",
      "He gasped, hard; he shifted, forcing her into his lap so he could fuck her furiously, trying madly to mate her, breed her, have her--whatever he could take of her, he would have, and he would have himself as deep in her as he could be.",
      "\"Fuck!\"",
      "She shouted into his shoulder, the word almost slurred as she bounced on his cock, and he stared adoringly at her.",
      "On her lips, it was the most beautiful word he had ever heard in his long life.",
      "Her hands held tight to his, and he wouldn't ever even dream of letting go.",
      "This was new to him, and the change was stunning; it was as if he had been blind, and now could see.",
      "It was--it was different, different than he had ever thought it would be.",
      "He was aware, suddenly, of how every movement felt to her, how every single arc of his cock felt in her tight little body, not only from his perspective, but her own: how full she was of him, the pressure of his hips pressing to hers almost overwhelming.",
      "He felt her emotions cresting over the top of him; felt her sheer desire float by on an eddy of overwhelming emotion.",
      "His mind expanded, enveloped hers, and she did the same to him.",
      "He felt everything the wildling did, and it almost scared him; he saw his future self in her, and wondered if she saw the same, an entwining of fate's ropes as inflexible as her vines.",
      "She looked no less affected; she was making little nonsense noises into his shoulder, little phrases that he couldn't quite place the meaning of.",
      "\"I didn't know it would...\" she murmured, hands pulsing against his own; a sunflower sprouted from her tresses, withered, died, was reborn in a cavalcade of asphodel that flowed through her dense hair.",
      "\"I didn't--think--\" He squeezed her fingers as reassuringly as he could.",
      "She looked up at him, visible awe in her eyes as she whined toward her limits.",
      "He claimed her lips in a hot, bursting scorch of pain-pleasure; white heat flew through his entire, immortal body, and he whimpered, overcome.",
      "The connection deepened, images flashed through his mind: Persephone on his throne, in her garden, her tent, but always with him; in his bed, arcing against him as her hands scrambled for purchase, knotted in his blanket.",
      "He gasped, the air driven out of him as he rammed his hips hard into her, in an orgasm so strong he felt like he was he was slammed face--first into the summit of the highest mountain he'd ever attempted to climb and could only scramble for purchase falling down it.",
      "Instinct took him the rest of the way -- he should have cut connection with their powers, but he didn't, couldn't; instead, he trembled underneath her like a fish out of water, complete with mouth open in surprise, and the wildling simply clamped down on his hands and rode out his orgasm with him, letting him come within her.",
      "Visions passed, too quickly for him to see anything but her --and flowers blossomed about him, each in different jewel-tones, each growing more vivid as he pulsed deep within her.",
      "She should have slid off of him, he thought; really, he should have pulled out before this point, but he couldn't and he didn't, and he was still too feverish to even think of the potential implications of that.",
      "She continued to ride him to nurse the aftershocks, teasing him with soft kisses as her hips moved on him; she was shaking, too; close, he thought.",
      "He broke the connection of his power to hers; she whimpered but oh, it was too much, too much.",
      "He sat up and caught her with one arm, keeping her hips close as she ground against him; the other snaked between them, pressing down on her clit as best he could.",
      "\"Ki-kiss me?\"",
      "She asked, stuttering, and he complied, could not even think of not doing so.",
      "She gasped as he crashed down on her mouth, and his softening cock flared back to life again as he felt her channel pulse around him.",
      "Even in this, he couldn't sate his thirst for her.",
      "She gasped quietly against him several times, hips still flaring in desire as she came, and he kissed each and every space on her that he could reach until she slowed, finally, and laid her head upon his shoulder.",
      "\"It seems there's still some life in you yet, old man,\" she said; oh, how his heart melted for this wildling.",
      "It was not entirely the poison in his veins anchoring them together, he thought.",
      "He kissed her again, rumbling pleasing, nonsense noises in his chest.",
      "He nuzzled encouragement as she continued to ride him in slow, simple moves; he was well aware of how much he wanted her again already.",
      "\"I hadn't done that before,\" she said slowly, placing her hand on his now-closed palm and letting just the slightest frisson of life flow forth into his ancient veins.",
      "\"Nor I,\" he admitted; he'd refrained, before, from indulging that instinct; it was an unpredictable thing, and required giving up more control than he'd been comfortable with.",
      "Not to mention, of course, that taking a full dose of death's gifts would -- well, anything lesser than this wilding would have quickly become part of his reaping, and that would be more than awkward.",
      "He'd seen what happened to Semele, when Zeus had tried the God's embrace with a woman of lesser stock; he'd had to reassemble her soul in the underworld, fragment by fragment.",
      "The more powerful the gift, the more dangerous, and he was no less powerful than Zeus.",
      "\"Thank you, lovely,\" he said, because only now did he vaguely realize how much damage he could have done, just out of a selfish desire for--what?",
      "Instinctual bonding?",
      "He chided himself, but yet: he was hard, hard as iron, cock still desperate to move, wanting more still; no, needing her still.",
      "She shifted back a bit with a frown and he shook his head.",
      "Don't go, he tried to say, knowing all too well how selfish it was.",
      "\"Are you...\" She frowned.",
      "\"Did you come?",
      "I thought I felt you--\" \"Oh yes,\" he hummed, nodding his head.",
      "\"Oh yes.\"",
      "A part of him wondered if she was disappointed by his wanting more, if she'd starve him now after having been so generous.",
      "\"But I am...\" The words faded; he did not know how to describe it.",
      "She made him feel alive, in ways he had not felt for - a long time.",
      "It was a fever, but it was more than a fever, and telling her the whole of how he felt was too vulnerable, even as intimate as they were.",
      "Instead, he pivoted to humor.",
      "\"I have life on my lap, it seems.\"",
      "\"Hm, so you do.\"",
      "She smiled a little smile, a copper blush to her dark cheeks, and disengaged from him; the loss was staggering enough he whined a bit as she slid off of him, leaving him wet and, still, painfully hard.",
      "She looked at him for a long second as he stood, eyes skimming down his body.",
      "His breath caught in his throat slightly at the look in her eyes, dark and warm and curious.",
      "One of her fingers gently touched his shoulder before moving a trail down his skin, dipping into the soft grey of his chest hair.",
      "He did not move, unsure of the foundations they were now on; she tilted her head, studying him, her eyebrows rising in a silent question as she traced the long scar that divided his chest neatly, then dipped down to his hips.",
      "\"My father.\"",
      "He hoped she wouldn't ask for details and to his surprise, she didn't.",
      "She held out a hand and he grabbed it, though the touch of her closed hand was maddening when he knew what that hand contained.",
      "She brushed some of the dirt off his back with her free hand, smiling.",
      "\"You've got a lot of scars,\" she murmured, squeezing his hand.",
      "\"I like them.",
      "They...tell a story.",
      "I see why you are hailed as so fearsome.\"",
      "\"Oh, I shall take that as a compliment, then,\" he said, feeling quite the confused fool.",
      "Was he really flirting with the wildling?",
      "Was he truly so deluded as to think perhaps she might allow him to mount her twice?",
      "Immortal women were fickle, he knew.",
      "His grandfather had lost his member for only 100 couplings; the wildling was as descended from Gaea as he was and seemed far shorter of temper.",
      "And yet, gods above, how he wanted her.",
      "She stepped out ahead of him, suddenly purposeful in her stride despite being as naked as the day she was born, and he watched, confused, as she walked around them, tossing branches and brambles into the long-abandoned fire pit.",
      "Was she preparing for tuning in for the night?",
      "Hadn't it barely been dark when she'd come back?",
      "He blinked, noting for the first time that it was quite dark upon the mortal plane; so long down in his underworld, it was easy for him to forget that this was quite different from the normal day for humankind.",
      "And his one wild-lived goddess, who had chosen the mortal world over Olympian gold.",
      "She turned back to him and snorted.",
      "\"You look ridiculous, you know, standing there in the wind.",
      "Get our clothes.",
      "Your night vision surely is better than mine, or is all your talk about the underworld being so dark and gloomy just that--talk?\"",
      "He tilted his head in confusion, but she'd already turned back to the fire; did she intend to dress and leave him here?",
      "Perhaps that was the way of it.",
      "He sighed.",
      "Perhaps he would have this ailment forever, aching eternally now.",
      "Still, despite the wound to his pride, he obeyed, gathering their hastily tossed things.",
      "He held out the fabric of her chiton to her, and she rummaged around in it until she produced something from one of the drapes of fabric she'd made into a pocket: a flint.",
      "After a few moments, she managed to produce Prometheus' gift to the humans and turned back to him with a soft smile.",
      "He stood with his clothes in his hands, debating what his next move was.",
      "He should - he should go.",
      "But before he could begin to say goodbye, she was gone again, crawling into the tent.",
      "He felt a fool, and his cheeks flushed a rare shade of crimson.",
      "Perhaps she thought their coupling less than impressive, or his body proof of a less than enduring case of opposites attract; perhaps she was disappointed in this filthy old man, who wanted nothing but to so obviously to fuck her again and again.",
      "Perhaps she was reconsidering what they had done.",
      "Perhaps this was her answer as to whether it would ever happen again.",
      "Figuring that was the well and true end of things, he sighed and began to redress; it would not be particularly easy, given that he was still half-turgid, but he managed to get his pants nearly all the way up before he heard the tent part again.",
      "\"Where are you going?\"",
      "The wildlings voice was reedy and hurt, and he turned back to a look of surprised anger on her face.",
      "Again.",
      "\"I thought you wished me to leave,\" he said, and truthfully, he knew he should.",
      "Despite the fire in his blood, he had his duties under the ground and he was dimly aware he was neglecting them.",
      "But then his wildling shook her head.",
      "\"No, Hades, let me be clear: I want you to come here, and I want you to fuck me,\" she said, and his deathless heart nearly stopped.",
      "Her lips slid into a smile that may as well have been a portent of his doom; his mind whirled in giddy terror.",
      "But somehow, he was already walking toward her.",
      "The poison muddling his head and his cock took him the rest of the way.",
      "He tossed his hastily discarded clothing next to hers, abandoning it by the fire, and dove through the doorway.",
      "\"You're pretty spry, you know,\" she said, smirking, and then she held out a hand, vines wrapping around it already in a wordless embrace of life; she was open, open, and willing to mate!",
      "He opened his palm, shadow-sense open, and let instinct guide him home as he coupled her.",
      "This time, he took his time entering her; much to his satisfaction, she did not complain as he slowly pressed himself inside of her.",
      "\"Better?\"",
      "He asked, voice low; she nodded and smiled, biting her lip.",
      "\"You feel very nice,\" she murmured; a shy grin graced her lips, and he had never seen anything so beautiful.",
      "\"I could get used to this, Hades.\"",
      "He chuckled; the idea seemed a good one to him.",
      "It was different this time, in the comfort of the cave, under the crackling of the fire; his pace was slower, more tender, and despite the muddling of his senses, he was well aware of how much this felt like a different kind of union than what they'd shared earlier.",
      "Still, desperately, he wanted her; whatever she gave him, it was simultaneously too much and not even close to enough.",
      "He buried himself deep on every thrust, desperate to stay with her, to couple her completely; he felt himself buried deep in her, felt her tight cunt gripping him mercilessly and felt her overwhelming sense of being filled in turn.",
      "She wrapped her legs around him, her hands, she held tight to his above her head, and he felt everything; he felt her every move, her every breath.",
      "It was getting stronger now, the connection between them, and that was in its own way terrifying; he had never been connected to anyone on such a level.",
      "Lazy vines of morning glories slowly wound around his head in a garland, and he felt his pulse shudder at the sheer sentimentality of her giving him a crown in her own lands.",
      "He did not dare to pull his hand away from hers, not at all.",
      "He concentrated, closing his eyes and using his own power to build her a circlet of jewels from his own kingdom, pyrite chains with light green and yellow peridots dancing upon her brow.",
      "She giggled in joy at his gift, and a mad, possessive love grew deep in his old, ancient bones.",
      "His lips kissed at every bit of her he could reach, but he did not, could not break away.",
      "Now that he knew she could be trusted with this sort of embrace, it felt almost profane not to expose himself to her this way.",
      "You are setting yourself up to marry this sweetling, his mind whispered, and even knowing all the ways that could be a bad idea, knowing how many she had rejected; still, his mouth said \"Yes,\" and she had cried out and he had known, then, what he would have to ask her.",
      "It would not be too bad a thing for her.",
      "Surely she would grow used to the underworld; she would have far more power at his side than as a mere goddess of flowers and fauna.",
      "He could see it, linked with her; the bound string of fate, the woman whose face was open with unbearable pleasure upon his bed.",
      "Yes, he would have her.",
      "He needed her...and it was not, entirely, his ailment that had led him to such desires.",
      "Perhaps this was a sign, this fever; perhaps it had been given to him by the fates, the old biddies finally fed up of him being so long alone.",
      "They worked in strange ways, after all.",
      "Perhaps they had been the ones to kick the dryad from its roots; or to alert her to his needs--if so, he was in some way, thankful to them.",
      "The madness in his veins let him plunge into her, again and again, insatiable; he lost track of how many times they made love that night, only knowing that he had ceased to count by the time they finally stopped.",
      "The firelight dimmed and glowed low, and still, he made love to her; her in his lap, her on her side, her underneath him, her above him.",
      "His mind swam as he claimed her, again and again; only at the end of the night, when even his immortal body began to ache before the dawn, did he finally soften enough to be sated - if only just.",
      "She rarely broke her grip on his hands, keeping them bonded the entire time, and as sunlight began to flow over his rapidly closing eyes, she kept them locked together, so that even their dreams would be shared.",
      "Marry me, he thought, and he wasn't sure if she heard him or not; a quiet titter of laughter resounded in his head, and he wasn't sure if it was her assenting, her laughing at his ridiculous proposal, or simply his own mind acknowledging the farce of it all.",
      "They'd barely known one another a day, and yet - he could think of nothing but her.",
      "He was, for the moment, too exhausted to worry about his feelings.",
      "For the first time in a long time, he felt--at peace.",
      "Slowly, he began to ebb away from the waking world, into sleep, where his dreams were - for the first time since his father's war - pleasantly dreamless and black.",
      "He awoke more sore than he had been in years; every joint he had cracked as he slowly blinked back to awareness.",
      "He grunted and squinted in unfamiliar sunlight, trying to recall why he wasn't in his own bed, waking up to the dim fire-light of the Phlegethon.",
      "There was a smoking campfire outside, and he was in a...tent?",
      "He blinked and looked to his side, suddenly aware of the body lying next to him as he shifted.",
      "A lovely head of kinky, flowing hair well bedecked with flowers and jewels lay next to him; the wildling, he remembered, and, slowly, he began to recollect his memories of the previous day, which rolled in dimly at first and quickly amplified in volume, a symphony of low moans and heavenly cries.",
      "Hades gasped in horror.",
      "He had - oh, no.",
      "He remembered being wrapped in the vines, the urgent infection that had been sent upon his blood--and the satisfaction he'd taken in her.",
      "Oh, he'd taken his fair share, hadn't he, and more than that.",
      "Demeter was going to absolutely kill him, and he deserved it; he'd taken his younger sister's daughter--her much younger daughter--as a goddess, linked up with her in ways that were quite profane.",
      "Life and death in a dance like that?",
      "Demeter would be well within her rights to turn him into kindling.",
      "They hadn't even - gods above, had she had any sort of contraception?",
      "He did not recall asking, and he certainly hadn't offered.",
      "Zeus may well use Chronos' sickle off on him should Persephone birth his bastard, he thought.",
      "It wouldn't be easy to misidentify any kin of his; any child of his would be born with the heavy cowl of the underworld on them.",
      "Zeus would ferret it out as easily as he had his own hundreds of whelps.",
      "He had little hope of getting ahead of this; he'd have to go to Olympus as soon as possible and beg -- beg -- his insufferable younger brother for the girl's hand.",
      "A hand which Zeus had, oh-so-tactfully and subtly, already denied him by virtue of not asking him if he'd wanted her in the first place.",
      "And to think only a few afternoons ago, he had thought Zeus had done him a favor.",
      "The goddess at his side slowly turned.",
      "As she did, the blanket she'd pulled up around them fell away, revealing the flush of a well--sexed woman, and his mark well nipped into her neck.",
      "He really had lost control; he sighed.",
      "Idiot.",
      "He ran his hand over his own neck, felt the tender spot where she'd nipped into him--no, it would be obvious on them both.",
      "They'd left their marks.",
      "Well, only one thing to be done.",
      "It was too late to take things back and...he wasn't entirely sure if he regretted it.",
      "She had held him all night, shadow-palm and all.",
      "Even Hestia, his closest sister, could not boast such a simple expression of love; she had always winced when they'd so much as shaken hands, even if he'd kept his power closed off from her.",
      "The others were varying shades of not-better and worse still when it came to touching him; Zeus would barely touch his palm, shaking his hand like a limp fish; Poseidon never touched his hand at all, ditto Demeter, and Hera--well, she looked insulted he'd even try.",
      "But Persephone--she had been open with him from the start, had courted him.",
      "What was it she'd said when she'd mounted him?",
      "I have death in me, his memory of her voice whispered in his ear.",
      "And she did.",
      "How she did.",
      "How he would like her to have him again, though there was nothing left of his cock for her to find novel, not anymore.",
      "The beautiful girl snored lightly, and he could not stop himself from touching her side.",
      "How warm she was, how soft, how beautiful.",
      "He wanted her still, even knowing he should be ashamed for it.",
      "She was centuries younger than him.",
      "Perhaps even millenniums younger.",
      "She may wear the old clothes but who knew how old she was; 18? 1,800? 18,000?",
      "He was far older than all of the above, had taken his first steps when the world was little more than smoke and ash.",
      "She neither leaned into his touch nor denied it, continuing to sleep soundly.",
      "He supposed she had every right to be tired, he'd put her through her paces in this tent, and outside, too.",
      "Stars above, he realized dimly; they'd put on quite a show outside as well.",
      "He'd have even less room to maneuver with cocky Zeus now, who no doubt had seen every image of him quite eagerly enjoying his daughter's gifts.",
      "He tried to lie back down next to her, holding her as close as he could, even with her hair full of poppies, petunias, peridot and pyrite tickling at his nose.",
      "He ran a hand down her side again, closing his eyes as he explored her smooth, tawny skin.",
      "She would come with him, wouldn't she?",
      "He could not imagine the wildling out of her lands, but neither could he imagine her refusing.",
      "A realm-lord's offer of marriage was far higher than Demeter could reasonably expect her wildling daughter to receive, but then, the child had already refused Poseidon's offer of companionship, and that, too, had been a realm-lord's offer.",
      "He tightened his arm across her, holding her tighter.",
      "His heart was beating faster; perhaps fast enough that she could hear it, for she stirred slightly in his arms.",
      "And if she awoke, what then?",
      "He grimaced.",
      "He was not ready to have this discussion, not yet.",
      "He wasn't even sure he could have any conversation with her here; if she awoke, and she looked at him with wide, wicked gold-flecked eyes in a naughty glance?",
      "He'd bed her again, he thought; she was already naked, and he'd take every bit of advantage to have her again and again.",
      "He would fill her as long as she was willing.",
      "Something about her took his well-honed control and flung it straight down to Tartarus; she was vexing and intoxicating and wonderful all at once.",
      "No, he couldn't do it; had to have his mind set right.",
      "He needed - he needed space.",
      "Carefully, he extracted himself from her, slowly slipping his hands from her side and moving at a snail's pace so as not to make much noise.",
      "He crawled out of the tent with blinking confusion in the low light of day; then, he meekly gathered his outfit.",
      "He put back on his pants and buttoned up his shirt; he debated adding the coat, but forsook it - if the wilding awoke while he was walking, he wanted her to know that he was still around, had not left without saying goodbye.",
      "He glanced heavenward, as if he could see Zeus.",
      "He raised a hand to the sky, but no heavenly messenger came; no warning, either.",
      "No thunderbolt came down upon him, and he took that as perhaps a sign that Zeus would be merciful enough to allow marriage.",
      "With a sigh, he walked forward, gathering his shoes and walking through the wildling's grove.",
      "As far as sacred spaces went, it was a rather nice one; now, in the quiet twilight, he could see a bit more of it as he paced restlessly.",
      "It was an island, he realized, dimly coming across the shoreline on the opposite side of where he'd arrived earlier when he had apparated up into the mortal world.",
      "He turned back toward the wildlings grove, marveling at her little space.",
      "It was alive in every quarter; vines and grasses and thick nettles and briars everywhere he passed.",
      "The trees closest to her clearing were spectacular; old stock he knew not the name of, but even he enjoyed their brilliant green leaves.",
      "It felt unnatural to admire the vivacity of life here, so long underground, but he did.",
      "He found himself pacing back to where the wildling had met him only what felt like a day before, staring down at the garden which had so enraptured his interest--and the spirit that had once been trapped there.",
      "Poor Charon; he had been gone long, now, and the boatman must truly be bored with the nymph.",
      "Hopefully, he had not dunked it into the Styx.",
      "He could see the vine the poor dryad had been contained in and next to it, the flower he had tramped the day before.",
      "The vine had curled around the flower, still well-sprung and hale from Persephone's touch the day before.",
      "It was a beautiful thing, and again he felt the curious urge to touch it--but this time he held back, observed it more carefully.",
      "There was something a bit odd to it, the quicksilver grey mixed with light pink in its petals, the odd thrum of its energy.",
      "He stared upon it again, wondering why the quicksilver grey should so bother him--and then it hit him, all at once.",
      "That was Aphrodite's bloom, awash in the quicksilver ink; the nymph's blood, it was called.",
      "A renowned--and potent--aphrodisiac.",
      "And they had both touched it.",
      "He scooted back on instinct, panic seizing in his chest.",
      "A love-plant, a love-spell, and they'd both fallen under its sway.",
      "He'd taken her without knowing, but it made it all the more despicable; of course she would have no interest in a man such as himself without it.",
      "Of course, it had been all the damnable love goddess.",
      "Aphrodite, he thought, was Uranus' revenge on them all for his castration.",
      "What better evidence of that was this feeling rioting through his chest, as if his ancient heart was cracking open, ready to be devoured?",
      "This was not love, though it had been all too easy to fool himself with perhapses and if onlys.",
      "This had been mere chance, a shared poisoning of blood--and he, the elder, who should have known better, had done little more than all too willingly bury his cock into a woman whose virtue he should have protected.",
      "He was, he realized, no better than his brothers.",
      "And the wildling--had she truly wanted it at all?",
      "Had he done little more than rape her?",
      "Would she awaken sad and sore of him?",
      "He had to--he had to talk to her, had to explain--but that didn't matter.",
      "No, he'd done her badly.",
      "No recompense could fix it.",
      "To think, he would have asked her to marry him.",
      "Foolish.",
      "Of course he could not hope for such, of course her touch had been nothing more than mere...lust.",
      "She would never hold her hand open to him like that again, let intoxicating life course through his shadow-senses as she had.",
      "She would be horrified when she remembered how much of death she had let inside her, and he would carry this shame until his dying day.",
      "He heard the soft crunch of the grass behind him, and knew his doom was at hand.",
      "The girl crept up behind him and pressed two strong arms across his chest; he did not know what to do.",
      "Did he hold her?",
      "Did he run away?",
      "He could not decide and thus did nothing, standing quite miserable.",
      "\"Mornin', uncle.",
      "Well, evening.\"",
      "She chuckled into his ear and he shifted, trying with all his might not to turn around and bury her in his arms.",
      "\"Are you hungry?",
      "I'm quite famished; we never did eat the snack I grabbed and you worked me so hard all night.\"",
      "Her hand trailed lower, loosely caressing his hip and then lower still; he stopped her hand there, before it reached its destination.",
      "\"I did not hear you leave, you were so quiet; were you thieving out of my garden for a snack?",
      "You could have asked.",
      "I would have given one to you--though now, I suppose, I have the means to demand compensation and thus to keep you even longer.\"",
      "She slipped from his side then, taking a step forward past him and near the garden.",
      "Unable to resist any longer, he grabbed her into a tight embrace, telling himself even if it was selfish, he was at least keeping her from danger.",
      "His hands caught fabric and for once he was happy she was wearing her dress.",
      "His hand settled on her belly, softly moving with her breath under his fingertips.",
      "He dared not think of what he feared.",
      "\"Don't,\" he said, and swallowed.",
      "\"What?\"",
      "He looked down upon her, sure he was not doing a good job keeping the horror from his face.",
      "She looked up with the face of the innocent, and he watched painfully as her expression went from blissful happiness to concern.",
      "\"What troubles you, uncle?\"",
      "She looked down to her belly then back at him, and shook her head, a soft smile on her lip.",
      "\"Are you worried...?",
      "Oh, never fear uncle, you'll not be made a father yet.",
      "I've taken silphium for birth control every morning for centuries.",
      "There's no risk of that, Hades.\"",
      "That was a small relief, to know he had not begotten her an unwelcome babe on top of everything else.",
      "But still, he suffered.",
      "He reached out with an unsteady hand; cupping her cheek.",
      "He had to tell her.",
      "She had every right to know.",
      "\"Persephone...niece.\"",
      "\"Hm?\"",
      "She leaned her wild cheek into the curve of his palm, and he sucked in a hot gasp of air.",
      "Stars, how could she stand him?",
      "Surely she would not, after knowing what he had done to her.",
      "\"I need to tell you something,\" he said, and she smiled and shook her head.",
      "\"Is that all that has you so dour?",
      "I heard what you thought in the morning-light, uncle; and there is no need to be nervous, I shall give you my answer while we eat; let me pluck a few things from my garden...\" She smiled brilliantly and pulled away from him, and he wondered if she was still under its veil; she had been infected later than he had been.",
      "He could not allow her to touch it again.",
      "\"No!\"",
      "He pulled her tighter to him.",
      "\"Please listen.\"",
      "\"Whatever could be such a matter?",
      "You are bleating so much like a nanny goat I should think you were my mother.\"",
      "He ignored the insult, smoothing down her hair with shaking hands.",
      "\"Look in your garden, to the flowers; the one I trampled yesterday, do you remember?\"",
      "She turned and looked; he kept his arms on her, and told himself it was for reasons less selfish than fearing it was the last time that he would be able to do so.",
      "\"It is one of Auntie Aphrodite's plants she recently gifted me,\" she said, her voice as innocent as a lark.",
      "\"Yes, I know uncle.\"",
      "\"We touched it,\" he ground out between clenched teeth.",
      "\"We were...under its spell.\"",
      "Her eyes widened; she sucked in a harsh breath, then another.",
      "\"You...touched it?",
      "On purpose?\"",
      "Now she looked troubled, and his heart sunk as he knew it would.",
      "\"No!\"",
      "He shook his head vigorously and then stopped, reconsidered.",
      "Dangerous ground here, and it would be best to be honest.",
      "\"Well, sort of.",
      "I thought it was lovely, and wished to touch it as a flower--I did not recognize the danger of it until I saw it now, and remembered just what effect such potent drug may have.\"",
      "\"Oh.\"",
      "She looked up at him, her chin almost wobbling; even someone as unused to company as himself recognized, all too keenly, that this was a sign she might cry.",
      "\"Does that mean when we...you really were...feverish?",
      "You were not playing?\"",
      "\"Yes.\"",
      "He closed his fingers around her wrist.",
      "\"I am sorry, I should not have--\" \"No, I am the fool.\"",
      "She sniffed.",
      "\"I thought-- thought you wanted-- \" \"The fault is entirely mine.\"",
      "He pulled her closer to him, surprised that she had not yet run for the hills--or her mother.",
      "\"I am an elder of the family, and as such, I should have protected you better, even from myself.\"",
      "She made a soft, sniffling cry; he stroked her hair.",
      "\"I'm...I thought you were playing you had touched it, uncle.\"",
      "She huffed into his shirt, something between a laugh and a bitter exhale.",
      "\"You warned me and yet I thought...he is seducing me, I see it; if he were under the influence, surely he could not hold back at all and he is trying so hard not to mount me, he would not touch me, prep me...It is a game he is playing.\"",
      "\"It is not your fault, my dear.",
      "I am the elder and the blame lies with me.\"",
      "His stomach threatened towards upheaval and he fought the bile hard; he was already ruining her memories of him enough.",
      "\"It...",
      "I am terribly sorry.",
      "You see, I owe you recompense that even with all my riches, I am unsure how to repay, but I will, in whatever way you or your parents deem proper.\"",
      "She looked up at him then, biting her lip.",
      "\"Uncle Hades, I need to tell you something.\"",
      "She curled her hands over his neck, though she'd had to stand on her tip-toes to do it.",
      "She leaned up and moved her lips to his ear, as if to whisper him a secret.",
      "\"...I dosed myself,\" she whispered, and he jerked away from her, no doubt looking quite the fool but scalded all the same.",
      "Her face fell at his response.",
      "\"What?\"",
      "He looked back at her in ghastliness.",
      "He wouldn't have wished that on anyone.",
      "\"Why?\"",
      "\"You looked at me with interest, and I...\" She bit her lip.",
      "\"I knew losing my virginity to you would piss my father off.",
      "And I am tired, truth be told, of being a virgin locked on an island.",
      "And you are...\" She was bright red now, and only growing redder.",
      "\"You're...well, you're quite handsome, uncle.\"",
      "\"You are the first to call me that.\"",
      "He said, then, realizing fully well and true what she had said, he ran his hand over his face.",
      "So he'd taken her virginity to boot, his lady mother above and father below.",
      "She had as much as told him; be had simply chosen not to be aware of it.",
      "\"I am...sorry.",
      "I owed you a better time of it.",
      "I did not know.\"",
      "\"It was a very good time of it, to me.\"",
      "She smiled but he saw the cracks of unsteadiness in it; she reached out a hand to him and he took it.",
      "\"I did not know you, too, had touched it.",
      "I thought...It's a silly thing, but when I saw you look at me while I notched that arrow, I thought - I thought you found me flattering, uncle.",
      "I didn't--I didn't know it was--\" \"It was not entirely the cursed plant.",
      "I do think you beautiful, sweetling.\"",
      "He patted her shoulder awkwardly.",
      "This was a new realm; he was not used to thinking of emotional things.",
      "\"But why put such a curse upon yourself, Persephone?",
      "I would not have wished such a horrid liquid fire upon the veins of my worst enemies.\"",
      "\"I wanted to...\" She turned away and scoffed.",
      "\"I have been so long cooped up, uncle!",
      "My mother leaves me here because I am no longer allowed to assist her in her duties; my father demands I remain until I finally marry off, so I am often alone.",
      "There are no mortals here anymore, and the Gods who have come have only come to beg for my body as a brief means of pleasing my father.",
      "Why do you think I have taken an aborficant like silphium so long?",
      "I've long feared one of them would try to force me, for I wanted none of them.\"",
      "He tried to imagine it.",
      "He too had lived alone for many, many years, but he had not had the threat of rape held over his head.",
      "Stars above, he knew how ruthless the family was and yet he'd abandoned her with the rest of them.",
      "\"Oh, Persephone...\" he said, and drew his arms around her.",
      "The poor woman.",
      "No wonder she had been so fierce when first they had met.",
      "She would not need to be so again; regardless of how she felt about him, he would put her under his protection.",
      "\"I had thought you had gone to see your mother for the antidote...?",
      "It despairs me to think of you so suffering all alone.",
      "I cannot believe your mother would allow this.\"",
      "\"She has no choice; she cannot resist the will of Zeus.",
      "And I suspect you will think it foolish, but...\" her voice was wobbling now, strength fading to a vulnerability that made him shudder.",
      "\"I have lived here alone for many years, with only my suitors for company.",
      "Most did not take rejection well; many told me I was ugly and that I would be lucky of their company, that no one likes an old virgin, that I was frigid; uncle, and after so many insults I took them for truth.",
      "I thought if I would borrow some of my auntie's grace, perhaps I would be...seductive enough, for a man of your stature.",
      "I was nervous and I walked in the trees to get the sap from an old tree, and then walked more until I felt the drug take effect, and even then I waited until I was nearly out of my mind with want before I returned.",
      "I wanted you to think of me as beautiful as Aphrodite and just as irresistible.\"",
      "\"That you were,\" he admittedly quietly.",
      "\"That you are.",
      "But you would be, regardless.\"",
      "He took a chance and pressed a kiss to her forehead.",
      "\"You are stunningly beautiful, the finest of all goddesses.",
      "Know this for truth, for all your days.\"",
      "\"Now you are the first to say that,\" she said, a soft blush on her cheeks.",
      "They stayed together a moment, neither sure, he thought, of where to go from here.",
      "She squeezed his hand carefully, and he traced nonsense patterns on her hand with his thumb.",
      "She found her courage first and looked up at him, brown eyes evaluating him.",
      "\"Do you...do you regret it, uncle?",
      "What we did?\"",
      "That was a potent question and he weighed his responses carefully.",
      "He might not have wished for the conditions of their first meeting but...he could not honestly say he was sorry to make her acquaintance.",
      "She was not only beautiful but crafty and compassionate, and he had not known he much he had longed to connect with someone who showed no fear of him.",
      "\"No,\" he said, plainly.",
      "\"Do you?\"",
      "She shook her head and leaned upwards on her toes, struggling to kiss him.",
      "He bent down and captured her lips for her.",
      "Even without Aphrodite's poison, it wasn't enough for him; he kissed her again, then again, and again.",
      "She tugged his head toward her and he deepened the kiss; her hands moved under his shirt and he moaned into her, breaking the kiss only when he absolutely had to.",
      "They stumbled backward until they hit one of the trees of her orchard, and he used it to trap her against him, letting her feel how he was already half-erect at her touch.",
      "\"You are quite a dangerous thing,\" he murmured.",
      "His lips went to her neck and licked and suckled wantonly at the mark he'd made on her, knowing the bite would still be tender.",
      "She stroked at his nape, her fingers just barely reaching the mark shed placed on him, and he growled possessively.",
      "\"Always.\"",
      "She smiled at him, pure and sweet and intoxicatingly alluring, the subtlest hint of danger in the glint of her teeth.",
      "A fine queen of his lands she would be, oh yes.",
      "She grinned wider, and he wondered if she could read his thoughts.",
      "\"Do you wish to know the answer to your question?\"",
      "She wiggled her hips against him and he felt adrift in a dangerously strong current in Aphrodite's ocean.",
      "How could he be so intoxicated by her, having known her so short a time?",
      "Had he lost his damn mind?",
      "Perhaps, but he felt dangerously giddy of it.",
      "He supposed time did not matter.",
      "They belonged together.",
      "It was as simple as that.",
      "A dangerous feeling pushed up through his soul, budding like a flower in the spring: happiness, of a sort.",
      "\"I do,\" he said, daring to plan ahead.",
      "He would take her down to his domain, yes, do that first; Zeus would have no choice but to grant him his marriage then.",
      "And if he did not, well...he could hole up in the ground for a while.",
      "The human souls would wait, and Zeus would not dare to enter the underworld.",
      "Hades could afford to be patient, so long as she would come and stay at his side.",
      "She giggled and turned from him then, quickly clambering up her tree with the daring impetuousness of youth.",
      "She reached for a pomegranate upon one of her many trees and smiled.",
      "She fumbled through her pocket until she found her flint knife, cutting one of the strangely shaped fruits and he caught it as the fruit tumbled into his hands.",
      "She bounded down next, and he reached for the flint knife, using it to open the fruit.",
      "A bright flash of red arils spilled forth in a bounty he could not boast in the underworld.",
      "\"As I said, uncle, we shall have a meal.\"",
      "She smiled, all dangerous, and held it out to her lips.",
      "He watched, all hunger, as she swallowed the first seed.",
      "\"Your turn, Hades.\"",
      "He liked it when she used his name and kissed her to encourage the use of it; she tasted tart from the juice and he licked at her lips as she giggled.",
      "\"This is serious,\" she murmured; he didn't care.",
      "He picked an aril out; it had been years since he had eaten anything but the food of the dead, and the juice that stained his fingers looked strange.",
      "It was obvious why she had chosen the fruit; fidelity, it meant, in the old tongue.",
      "And to eat the fruit of another god in their dwelling--well, he knew what she was offering.",
      "Even if Zeus refused to recognize their marriage, this binding would seal him to her glen, would make him as much a part of this place as she was.",
      "He ate it, and then it was her turn to kiss him; five more seeds they ate in that fashion, swapping the juices between them, the sour-sweet taste bursting on his tongue.",
      "When it was done, he handed the fruit's core back to her.",
      "\"I would have your answer, wild one.\"",
      "He already knew, of course, but he wanted to hear it out loud.",
      "Wanted to hear she had chosen him, him above all others.",
      "But the wilding knew that too, and the look in her eyes suggested more wickedness than mercy.",
      "\"It's a funny thing, uncle, the rules of a God's lair.",
      "Did you know that by supping of their sacred foods you bind yourself to them?\"",
      "His eyes darted toward her as she picked, carefully, upon the ruins of the fruit she had offered him.",
      "\"You're mine now, Mr. Third Estate.\"",
      "\"Clever minx,\" he said, pressing her into the tree.",
      "He has dreamed of this and he would have it; he pulled his arms under her knees and hoisted her up on it; she hadn't, to his surprise, bothered with her underthings; one quick movement and he would be in her again.",
      "Her eyes suggested she very much wanted that, and who was he to fight her on it?",
      "He nodded to her unspoken question, and she laughed.",
      "Her fingers slowly fiddled with his pants as he stared down at her with heavy eyes.",
      "\"You will have to do the same in my abode in six months time; I will give up six months above should you do the same below.\"",
      "He would have to convince her to allow him to go down for some time for work but well--with apologies to the dryad and the other lost souls--that was a talk they could be having later.",
      "Perhaps much later.",
      "He hissed in triumph as she managed to undo his pants, all by herself; she pushed them down and then cupped her hands around him.",
      "Oh stars, she was clever; so clever.",
      "She stroked him mercilessly, and he didn't look away as he grew between her fingers.",
      "\"We shall see,\" She hissed; his heart faltered for a moment, but the teasing smile in her eyes suggested she was only giving him a hard time.",
      "\"You did say it was rather gloomy, and you have given me six months of your time regardless.",
      "But I will visit, at least.",
      "If only to try out your bed,\" she murmured, pushing herself up enough to kiss him.",
      "\"Would you like that?",
      "Me in your bed?\"",
      "\"Our bed, Mrs. Third Estate, and yes, yes, yes, I would,\" he said, meeting her eyes as he guided himself into her.",
      "It was a bit premature to call her that without her parent's permission, perhaps, but he did not care.",
      "He adjusted his grip so he could hold her one-handedly, letting the tree do some of the lifting.",
      "With his other hand, he opened his palm, shadows roaring out of it.",
      "Her hand rose to meet it, life exploding out between their palms.",
      "As they closed them together, he darted forward to steal a kiss from her; fate rippled, and he felt the line of his fate cross with hers.",
      "He felt - everything.",
      "Everything they had ever been, everything they would be.",
      "He saw her in himself and he cried out not from the pleasure of her body but from the union of their minds.",
      "She was no less overcome, her moans as loud as his--and despite knowing they were putting on a show again, he really did not give a damn.",
      "He would need to leave soon, to deal with the dryad, and his duties, and of course, Zeus and Demeter above.",
      "But for now, he wanted only her, and all of her, as much as he could have.",
      "He let his shadows pour forth; and vines burst forth from her palms with quixotic grace, helping to support her against the tree as he took her.",
      "Demeter and Zeus would yield.",
      "He was stubborn enough to make them, and with her at his side, nothing would stop them.",
      "\"Hades,\" she murmured, wrapping her one hand around his neck.",
      "He kissed every bit of exposed skin he could in encouragement.",
      "\"You're mine, Hades, all mine.\"",
      "\"I am,\" he purred, burying himself as deep inside of her as he could, felt her pull him deeper still, wanting more.",
      "She was as insatiable as he was.",
      "He had learned long ago not to waste precious gifts when they presented themselves, and nothing was as precious as her.",
      "He felt their consciousness merge fully, felt the burgeoning love echoing between them, and for the first time--the first time in a very long time--he felt complete.",
      "Charon waited patiently, as he had been.",
      "That had been his job since time immortal; Hades--or Iapetus, before him--brought the souls, and Charon sent them down the river to the eternal fields.",
      "Circumstances, however, were trying the boatman's patience.",
      "Things had not gone the way they had for the past several thousands of years for the past few days, and Charon had no idea what to do.",
      "He had even gotten out of his boat, so unmoored was he; staring at the walls in Hades' halls, he felt no better.",
      "The nymph who had crashed upon his boat faired little better, waiting morosely upon the step of Hades' throne room.",
      "He felt more ill at ease than usual; not only was he not on his boat, but Lord Hades hadn't been back in nearly a fortnight, and the poor creature - well, he was getting awful tired of consoling her.",
      "There were only so many ways to say sorry, you're dead and he'd run out of all of them.",
      "\"Do you think he'll be soon?\"",
      "She asked.",
      "She had accepted her fate, at least; hopefully, Hades would send her to Asphodel or Tartarus or Elysium or well, frankly, anywhere, just so long as it wasn't in the Styx.",
      "Charon loved the old river goddess too much to see her further polluted with the girls' wailing.",
      "\"I'll take it up to Zeus if he isn't back within another day or two,\" he said, knowing he must and equally dreading it.",
      "He didn't like Olympus, never had once the usurpers took over.",
      "But Hades rarely spent an hour on the surface, and frankly despite his reticence, at two weeks his lack of reporting the man missing was sliding from negligent to inexcusable.",
      "\"That won't be necessary!\"",
      "Came a new voice, and he turned in surprise, eyes wide; a woman strolled in he'd not seen.",
      "Obviously Olympian - a curvy lass, with a sonorous voice and a crown of crystal flowers and thorns made of precious jewels.",
      "\"Are you Charon?\" \"Aye.\"",
      "He eyed her warily: she'd not come dressed for war--but a new God in the underworld was an atypical thing.",
      "She wasn't Hades and his duties lied with the man, not this interloper.",
      "\"Is Lord Hades with--?\"",
      "\"He's coming,\" she said, rolling her eyes.",
      "Her crown caught in the dim light as she stepped forward and his eyes widened: her crown had an ancient inscription, one that marked her as a realm-queen.",
      "Her attention turned to the little nymph, who was staring at her in as much fascination as Charon was.",
      "\"Oh my, are you a shade?",
      "I've never seen one.\"",
      "\"Are you...?\"",
      "The nymph looked as lost as he felt, but the universe righted itself slightly as Hades strolled in, a large bouquet of asphodel in his hands.",
      "At least, he thought it was the man; he looked as Hades did, but the permanent smile on his face was...not something he'd ever associated with the man, to put it mildly.",
      "\"Found some,\" he heard Hades say, and the nymph scrambled straight up, eager now for her final benediction.",
      "His boss bounded into the low light and Charon bit his cheek: it was Hades, alright, bounding into view with not only a goofy smile on his face but a flower crown on his head.",
      "He wasn't sure if Hades had hit his head upstairs something fierce, or if Charon had finally given up all sense of sanity at the thought of seeing what Zeus had done to Chronos' hallowed halls, but it was certainly a sight, either way.",
      "\"Charon!",
      "Good seeing you.",
      "Apologies for the delay.\"",
      "He nodded stiffly, watching as Hades turned toward the Olympian, wordlessly handing her six asphodel blossoms, as if that made sense.",
      "\"Eat up, wife,\" he said, tapping her shoulder.",
      "\"Wife?\"",
      "He looked up at the Olympian woman, then back at Hades, then back at the woman.",
      "He blinked.",
      "Well.",
      "That would explain the delay, he supposed.",
      "He hadn't realized the Olympians had been compelled to mate, but he could see why Hades picked this one.",
      "She radiated life and light.",
      "\"My...Queen?\" he said, trying the word on his tongue.",
      "It felt...odd.",
      "\"We'll see.\"",
      "The woman's eyes twinkled with Jovian mischief as she wove Hades' flowers carefully into her crown.",
      "\"And yes, I'm Persephone, Hades is my husband.",
      "I'm a goddess of spring.",
      "I'll be around from time to time.\"",
      "She looked around, squinting.",
      "\"Now, if you want me to be queen of this place, we're going to need to change the lighting situation in here.",
      "How did you ever find your way here without stumbling over yourself?",
      "Gods above, I was doing you mercy, trapping you up there.\"",
      "Charon raised an eyebrow.",
      "Trapping?",
      "The young ones had odd ideas of courtship, that was for sure.",
      "Had such a courtship been his lordship's choice?",
      "It was hard to imagine the little curvaceous thing could force someone as fearsome as Hades into anything.",
      "Hades looked at him and shrugged.",
      "\"It's a...well, it's a story.\"",
      "Hades said, and was it his imagination or did the underworld god look embarrassed?",
      "Probably some sort of coupling ritual.",
      "He wouldn't pry.",
      "He truly did not wish to know.",
      "\"Uhm, sir, could I...?\"",
      "The little nymph squeaked; Hades startled, visibly, and Charon again had to bite his cheek.",
      "Well, the missus would keep things from being boring, he supposed, if she could make Hades forget his duties.",
      "\"Of course!\"",
      "He grabbed his wife's arm and strode with her over to the little nymph.",
      "\"Wife, let me introduce you to the highest of my duties.",
      "This is one of our subjects, come to their final rest.\"",
      "He flexed his hand over the girl, his shadow--hand open; Charon always liked to watch Hades work, there was something calming about the shadows that poured forth.",
      "It reminded him nothing so much as his primordial home, deep within Gaea.",
      "To his surprise, Hades opened his other hand, and the little missus opened her own power and clasped it--he saw light, brilliant light, and suddenly there was a carpet of asphodels underneath their feet.",
      "He snorted, but no one noticed him, too caught in their own rituals.",
      "\"Do you see her time, darling?\" Hades voice sounded odd, echoing in the chamber.",
      "\"It was a long life.\"",
      "\"Yes.\"",
      "She stared at the nymph for a moment, and then turned, and Charon bit back a gasp at her eyes, so bright they were glowing with nascent power.",
      "\"Where should we put her wife?",
      "It was a good life, but not perfect.",
      "She hurt some, helped others.\"",
      "\"No person is perfect.\"",
      "She leaned into her husband.",
      "\"Why not give her Elysium?",
      "She died far from home, lost and confused.",
      "It was not her fault she wandered to my grove seeking shelter, and her suffering has surely equaled if not surpassed any trouble she has caused.\"",
      "She spoke like a realm-queen alright, Charon thought with a smirk.",
      "Hades broke the connection and smiled at his wife.",
      "\"Are you sure you're not the realm-queen here yet, darling?",
      "You speak with wisdom.",
      "I am in accord.\"",
      "He reached out and pressed his shadow palm over the nymph, who closed her eyes.",
      "\"Do try to enjoy Elysium, little one,\" he murmured, and then she was gone.",
      "\"You're in a good mood,\" Charon said.",
      "He took a few steps forward and placed an ancient hand on Hades' shoulder and laughed.",
      "\"Can I assume it's safe for me to resume my work now?\"",
      "He leaned in close to his lordship's ear and murmured, \"I'll uh...knock if uh...if I need ye.\"",
      "\"Ah, yes.\"",
      "Hades did not look him in the eye, already turning red at the cheeks.",
      "Newlyweds!",
      "They were all the same.",
      "\"That might be a good idea.\"",
      "\"A pleasure meeting you, my queen,\" he said, tipping his ancient cap; she did not correct his words.",
      "Good.",
      "He hoped she would stay.",
      "\"Now, husband,\" the girl purred as he left, and he could not help but smile as he left them to their work.",
      "\"Let's talk about getting some sunlight in here.",
      "Maybe some plants?\" Charon walked back through Hades' hall, happy to leave the newlyweds to their bliss.",
      "He tried to imagine what sunlight felt like on his skin; it had been eons since the war, and even then he'd spent most of it down here.",
      "Still, he wouldn't mind the little goddess too much, even if her ideas were strange.",
      "She seemed to judge well, at least, and he knew Hades well enough to know he had no doubt chosen his bride carefully.",
      "He certainly wouldn't desperately carry off the first woman who'd shot cupid's arrow at him, he was old enough to be beyond that.",
      "Someone in the throne room giggled and Charon laughed.",
      "Perhaps not too old to care about that, however!",
      "He didn't dare look, instead pulling open Hades' heavy iron doors and walking back to what he considered his only home.",
      "He grinned, already in a better mood as he took his welcome first steps into his boat.",
      "The Styx rocked around him in return.",
      "Ah, home.",
      "The boss was back, and now he was back where he should be, and everything was once again right with the underworld, even if it was a little different than it had been before.",
      "And that, he supposed, was welcome, or at least, tolerable.",
      "Anything that put the boss in a good mood, well - he supposed there was nothing wrong with that.",
      "Change in the underworld was an odd thing, but he would grow used to it.",
      "As long as he had his hands on his oars and the Styx under his feet, all would be alright."

Countless mortal heroes, demigods, even full-blooded gods would save her if she wanted, her mother reminded her. She politely refused the first time it was brought up, growing more firm each consecutive time. Demeter would ask how she was doing, how she was coping, but never listened. Never understood that she was happy with him. It was an arrangement that she'd been tricked into, her mother was sure to mention and she agreed. She had been tricked, but that was only a formality. The underworld was bleak and barren, but down there she had been free. Hades let her do as she pleased, didn't care that she wandered off on her own, as long as she stayed with him in his realm. The contrast to her mother's constant concern, was sharp. Demeter had always wanted her near, even before Hades took her. Persephone hadn't understood at the time, but getting away from her mother it became clear. Half a year was the most she could stand her mother, after that and she longed to return to Hades. She knew that his brothers asked similar questions of him, why only her after all this time, when there were so many others he could have? She was away for half the year after all, and it didn't matter. But it mattered to Hades. For him she was the only one. That was why she always returned to him, no matter how overjoyed she was to see her mother and the surface world, she was equally happy to return to the underworld. As much as she missed the light and sun, to know that Hades was there, always loyal, waiting for her to return meant so much more.",

A Mysterious Voice: \"In the ensuing chaos of those events, with dark lightning striking the cold earth, and terrifying tremors tearing down tall trees, Demeter could not see the faces of the abductors, who boldly rode the chariots of dim black from and to the Underworld, but she had her suspicions. One of them must be Hades. None else would dare to attempt something of the like, nor had a reason to. Hades had been secretly courting Persephone for a long time prior to the abduction. Through an exchange of letters delivered by a loyal black-eyed raven, including shadowy and private meetings in a disclosed place. She knew his schemes all too well, yet had to prove herself right in the matter.\" Concealing was the weird and animalistic mask, ominous were the macabre; ivory black chariots, the horses neighed not, dead before the given task, o' dwellers of Tartarus, fallen and insane patriots. And so the Earth became barren; callous and bleak, just like her drifting thoughts and heart about to break, Demeter stood on the verge between Winter and Spring, guiding the primal forces, she was not there to sing with birds falling down from the sky and livestock decaying, her will of doom became swift; unjust and maddening. A Mysterious Voice: \"Many harsh months later -- after the day of abduction -- Demeter rushed in through the golden doors of the Temple of Mount Olympus. She was disoriented, crying without an end.\" Demeter: \"Zeus, I demand you to take action! My daughter must be retrieved, or the Earth shall suffer the consequences. My wrath is to be merciless; fruitless and hopeless -- a certain death to the mortals -- should you not find out, who has abducted her. I was with her at the time when it happened, but we got separated during the bedlam. If you did not see anything up from the heavens, then maybe restful Helios did through the sun's eyes. Do not dare to turn me down at a time like this! Listen to reason and love, for my tears have already become ponds soon to be lakes. Will you not help me search for her, and the answers to who truly holds her a prisoner? I swear it was Hades, and that he has undoubtedly seduced my fair Persephone, and tricked her to become his wife and queen of the Underworld, yet I cannot prove my claim. Or is this the will of the Fates? It must not be so...\" A Mysterious Voice: \"Sadly, there never were any tricks, only mutual love, for Hades and Persephone enjoyed of each other's company, though not at first or with the hideous mask on. Zeus had witnessed the rise of Hades, and knew that he held her 'captive' in his stygian realm, yet he chose not to reveal this information to Demeter until the end. Only a handful few had seen Hades since the beginning (or ever for that matter) of the new order of the gods, when the Three Brothers initially divided the Heaven, the Sea and the Earth's Depths. Thus, with his ceremonial mask on to add further confusion and dread, yet revealing a part of his identity, Hades knew that he could easily carry out the deed during daylight's reign. Then he had to hope she (Persephone) could be convinced to stay, and speak openly against her mother, Demeter, once the time would be right.\" They would meet in darkest reaches of the earth, Zeus, Demeter, Hades and Persephone, to settle the score when Persephone, the new queen of death decided to let go off her mother, showing true mettle. Crown the Elysium's queen, learn to cherish the darkness beyond royally and eternally, forsake all forms of sadness, where the soulless dead wander in their afterwake, there in the caress of Styx Charon the Collector rows. A Mysterious Voice: \"Is it eerie that he would choose the flowers of Spring, and then crown her regally with joys of death and flesh? So it was once woven, and destined to be. Fate. It decrees, reaches and concerns all, yet none may escape it. Not in this world. So it was once told, when they (the Moirai) were born to see.. beyond the veil of existence.

He felt Ariadne's gaze on him, which forced him to snap back to attention \"Cobb are you with us?\" Arthur asked. \"Yeah, I just thought I saw something,\" Cobb admitted. \"Mrs. Cobb paying us another little visit?\" Eames asked. \"No, this was different: it looked like a man,\" Cobb said, looking back to the spot where the figure had stood, but seeing nothing. Arthur's brow puckered with concern, but there was a bit of a dry lilt in his voice: \"Maybe Yussuf needs to adjust his recipe a bit: it seems like it's working too well.\" But now Ariadne was staring off to her left, her dark eyes huge with awe. \"I think so...\" Eames said, following Ariadne's gaze, his voice trailing off and from the look on his face, Cobb had a feeling even their snarky forger was seeing the same thing.

    "text": "Elysion's lush trees and groves, its cool lakes and streams spread before her, and Persephone had spent the afternoon learning them all. Their newly created Paradise had swelled with souls in the past year-- those who had recently arrived, but mostly the ones found worthy in Asphodel. Her husband, Hades Aidoneus Chthonios, the Lord of the Underworld, had taken it upon himself to glean the worthy shades while she was above ground with her mother, Demeter. When she returned, the Queen joined her King in the throne room for each judgment. It was exhausting work. Yesterday afternoon, in the middle of hearing the case made by a mother of five who had died rescuing her niece from a mill fire, Persephone had wearily slumped onto his shoulder and collapsed into exhausted sleep. Hades had judged souls for aeons-- Persephone only for a year or so. Aidoneus had carried her back to their room and laid her on the bed-- despite her languid and slurred protestations-- tucked her in, and went back downstairs to see another round of souls from Asphodel. Today was to be a rare and restful day for her; one her husband insisted she take, and Persephone used it to walk the seemingly endless expanse of the Elysian Fields. She stopped under the low canopy of a tree. Her fingers paused on the serrated ridges of a leaf, feeling the life pulsing through it. They wandered up the stem and then the branch. Persephone closed her eyes, her soft skin skimming over the rough bark, then the smooth globe of one of its fruits and the indentation on its underside where a flower once grew before that fruit swelled with new life. A lark twittered, and then flew past her to join its mate. She closed her fingers around the apple and tugged. When it snapped and released the fruit, a strong hand captured her wrist from behind. \"I thought I might find you here.\" His baritone voice startled her. \"You thought?\" She tittered and leaned back into him. Aidoneus always knew where she was. Just as she always knew exactly where her other half was. \"I thought,\" he answered back. Aidon brushed the inside of her arm, causing a shiver to run up her spine. \"Because, I know my wife would never just stay in bed and rest when I've implored her to do so.\" \"This is restful,\" she protested. He smirked his response and she turned to face him. \"Honestly, Aidoneus, it is. The trees and meadows remind me of...\" She hesitated saying 'home'. In many ways both her husband's palace by the Styx and her mother's temple complex at Eleusis were home to her. But nothing felt so much like home as the Elysian Fields that Hades and Persephone had created together during the great rite of hieros gamos. He knew her thoughts and stroked her cheek, smiling down at her. \"These are still a rarity in Attica.\" Persephone held up the apple for his inspection. \"One day, I want to visit all the continents of the earth, see what grows there, and put one of each fruit-bearing tree in Elysion.\" He turned the unfamiliar fruit over in his hands and took a bite, pleasantly surprised at the tartness of the fruit and the crisp, wet texture. \"A task you will similarly exhaust yourself with, my love.\" She cast her eyes down, thinking about how hard she fought fatigue while presiding over the multitudes of Asphodel. The rulers of Chthonia had bent and broken the rules of their own realm, allowing each shade to drink from the Mnemosyne to temporarily restore their life stories and voices. The effects of the Pool of Memory took some time to wear off, and those who were not yet ready to enter Paradise pleaded incessantly to be let in. She could hear their cries, see their tears, mourned each one of them, but knew that they would have more chances to reside in Elysion. \"You worry about me always, husband. You always think I take on too much.\" \"Because you do, Persephone, by right of who you are. You are the Queen of the Dead, and also responsible for Spring-- the return of life to the earth above.\" He held her closer and wrinkled his brow. \"I put too much on you, sweet one. You work so very hard when you're above, and I wanted to let our kingdom be a haven for you-- a respite. But the last time I sent you back to your mother and the sunlit world, you were more exhausted than when you arrived.\" \"You're able to do this without exhausting yourself.\" She worried her lower lip. \"What is the matter with me that I cannot?\" \"Nothing,\" he said, handing her the apple. He loved watching her eat fruit from the Elysian Fields. He loved the way her lips pressed against the skin and the way her eyes closed as she savored each morsel. \"You are wonderful, fair and just. You proved it since the first.\" \"Perhaps. But my first charge escaped.\" Persephone recalled her first day in the throne room; handing down judgment to Sisyphus, of condemning him to Tartarus by turning his words and deeds back upon himself. \"We know why he did. And it will never happen again. Your coming and going makes it so.\" Hades drew in a breath, recalling his wife's final fiery triumph over the wicked mortal king. But his thoughts quickly drew back to when he and Persephone first sat side by side as King and Queen reigning in judgment over the mortals. A delightful shiver raced through him when he recalled Persephone clearing the room and him pulling both of them down onto his throne. He clenched his jaw, his eyes riveted to Persephone. Her closeness now fanned the flames and his mind became a tumult, racing from memory to longing. He pushed those desires to the back of his brain, nervous to even mention the thoughts that had surfaced, then cleared his throat and paced away from her. He stopped just beyond the overhanging branches of the tree. \"Ah, how are your lessons with Minos?\" \"Well,\" she said, cocking an eyebrow at him as he shifted from foot to foot and folded his hands behind his back. Her husband's entire body hummed with arousal and anxious energy. \"His ancient language is not as easy to learn as the one spoken throughout Hellas, there are many hieroglyphics, but...\" Avoidance wasn't like him. When he wanted her he made it known to her, and though he often held himself back from abandoning all control and losing himself, she delighted in his honesty and passion. Persephone padded through the grass and placed a hand on his back, circling him. Aidon thinned his lips and looked at the ground. He should have known. There wasn't anything he could keep from her. But that's not what you want to ask me, she said him through thought, is it? Persephone stared up at him with her wide blue gray eyes, a mischievous half smile on her face as his unspoken want sparked a wealth of fascinating ideas and echoes of the very desires she'd longed to discuss with him. Persephone picked over his thoughts. \"I believe that... other things... from the day of our first judgment that remain unfulfilled are what you--\" \"I can't ask that of you right now,\" he said, his face reddening. \"Why not?\" \"It's poor timing. You're weary.\" \"I'm not weary, Aidon. And you certainly didn't think I was too exhausted for our usual pleasures when you came back to our room last night.\" She flitted around his body, her fingertips dancing along his waist, then she rested her head on his back and wrapped her arms around his chest. \"I worried to even bring it up to you. I fear I pressed you to say what I wanted to hear that day.\" \"To say that we both want to know all of each other?\" \"You know what I mean.\" \"My love,\" she said, \"We can read each other's thoughts and feelings with perfect openness. We journeyed through and within each other during the hieros gamos. We experienced the past, the future, the cosmos itself on its grandest scale with our souls entwined, and we created Elysion itself as omnipotent Halves of one great Whole. And you're worried about asking me if I want to explore every facet of each other on this plane of existence?\" \"I don't want to hurt you. If we do... explore... I want it to be as pleasurable for you as I can make it.\" \"It can be, if...\" Persephone fidgeted and a blush spread across her face and bosom. \"Aidon, I... I spoke with Hypnos.\" He spun around and was about to protest and admonish until she raised her finger. \"Before you say anything, didn't you once tell me that you sought out his brother for advice of a certain nature regarding me?\" \"That was a long time ago.\" \"Not so long ago, though. And judging by the results of your conversation with Thanatos, I know it to be a good thing.\" He gleaned her thoughts and curiously found a clear vision of a kantharos cup filled with a first pressing of olive oil sitting next to the hearth in their bedroom. He raised his eyebrows. \"You're sure about this?\" \"Yes. Do you trust me?\" \"'Do you trust me ', should be the real question,\" he scoffed. \"You're the one who stands to be harmed by my lack of experience.\" \"I have none to speak of either, but I have an inkling of how we should go about it. And I believe you do too.\" She traced her fingers over his bearded jaw line and tilted her head up. His lips hesitantly met hers and she drew him into a kiss. His anxiety shattered when her tongue traced over his lips, seeking entry. Aidon relaxed and gathered her into an embrace as Persephone whispered against his lips. \"'With careful preparation.' Wasn't that what you said?\" She repeated his words against his ear, kissing him at his temple. \"In our room, 'when we are both relaxed' you told me, 'and able to go slowly'.\" His pupils dilated and darkened and he pulled at her earlobe with his lips before matching her low voice. \"The last thing I imagined was you seducing me into this.\" \"And judging from our history, I think that your expectations are often exceeded by the outcome, Aidoneus.\" She wiggled against him and delighted in his strained expression. He groaned and pulled her closer. His body responded to hers, his groin warm and hardening against her abdomen, his want made explicit when he ground against her. He tightened his limbs around her frame and dove in for a deeper kiss, sucking on each of her lips and mating his tongue with hers. Aidon broke the kiss and held back, teasing her, letting her pull closer to him with a whimper. \"I suppose we'll have to see where this takes us...\" \"Then there's only one place to go,\" she said. Fire bloomed into a twisting gyre as she opened a pathway through the ether behind her, then she stepped backwards, yanking him by the front of his tunic. Vertigo gripped Aidoneus and his eyes grew wide as he was pulled, falling forward. He landed on top of Persephone and instantly propped himself up on his wrists with his giggling wife beneath him, her legs on either side of his waist and her hair tousled from landing on the mattress. It took a moment to realize that she had taken them from Elysion straight to their bed. He joined in her laughter then set to work loosening the ribbon holding her hair into a chignon. \"We've never done that before...\" \"Hopefully not the only new thing we'll try.\" He fitted his body over hers and kissed her, unwrapping the last of her hair and fanning it out on the pillow behind her. She tugged at his himation, pulling it from his shoulder. He took over her movements and pushed it to the side of the bed until it fell into a heap on the floor. Her girdle came next, the jewels clinking together, and the fibulae holding up her peplos and his tunic soon joined it. In their two years of marriage, they had settled into a comfortable familiarity in bed. A routine had developed-- one that pleased them both greatly. Every night she spent with him during winter, they would undress each other, piece by piece, their clothes piled up on the left side of the bed. He would ensure that she reached her pleasure before he entered her. Variety was had in a graceful dance and twist of positions-- some favored more than others-- before they would collapse into euphoric afterglow then sound sleep in each other arms. When they awoke, they would often reprise their love and desire before starting their day. They made love, they coupled, they fucked, but always with her supple channel grasping at his phallus, the tip touching the mouth of her womb. Several nights ago, he had pressed his thumb against the puckered gateway of her untried passage while he was expertly tonguing her folds. The experience had her clenching her thighs tightly against his ears and bowing her back so violently that she'd sat upright and screamed her pleasure. But he hadn't dared to take it any further than that. Tonight she wanted to explore what made her react so intensely. Persephone untied his belt and freed Aidoneus of his tunic. He casually balled up her peplos and threw it aside. She delighted in the feeling of skin on skin, an electric closeness that portended all the greater things to come. His kisses were ravenous and his glans butted up against her vulva, his body at war with his mind's desire to go slowly. He desperately wanted her. Persephone pressed a hand to his chest. He paused, reveling in the sensation of her inner lips fluttering against the head of his cock, her entrance kissing the tip, her body itself belying her words. \"We should relax first.\" \"I can't think of anything that will relax me faster than fucking you, sweet one,\" Aidon purred. To make his point he pushed forward a fraction of an inch, and their breath caught in their throats. His control was slipping. She licked her lips and tried not to meet his incremental penetration or squeeze around him. It would end his willpower and she would be all too happy to be swept away with it. \"I think we should try putting what I learned to use, instead.\" Aidoneus withdrew completely and swallowed the sizable lump in his throat. \"That's not wise, my love. I want you too much right now, if you couldn't tell. I don't want to hurt you.\" \"Then you need to lie back,\" she said, slithering out from underneath him, \"and trust me, Aidon.\" She stood up from the bed and glanced over her shoulder at him. Aidon's fingers clenched on the sheets, wanting to grab her by the waist and pull her back under him, to plunge into her warm wet depths with animalistic fervor until they shattered in each other's arms. Persephone pulled back the curtain of their bed to reveal their room and walked to the glowing hearth fire. Upon its ledge sat a bronze tray and the wide kantharos from her mind's eye. Aidon lay on his back watching her. \"You planned this, didn't you?\" \"I may have,\" she said with a smile. \"Not for it to go exactly this way, but I certainly left this here for us before I went to Elysion this morning. I planned to at least discuss it with you tonight.\" Persephone was giddy to uncover his desires when he found her under the apple tree, to know that this forbidden need consumed his thoughts as it had hers. Persephone picked up the tray and walked back toward the bed, her skin glowing in the firelight, the tray resting in her hands. Aidon licked his lips and watched her intently, her slow pace like that of some heathen priestess bearing an offering to the altar where he was stretched out in sacrifice. She set it down on the sheets a ways away from them and Aidon caught a glimpse of the viscous shimmer of olive oil within the cup. Persephone crawled over him and straddled his stomach, the scent of flowers rising from her body. He looked up at her and ran his hand up her thigh then her belly and ribs to cup and mold a breast. His thumb passed over the taut peak and he spoke, his voice hoarse. \"I suppose you want me to follow your lead, but I'm not sure where you're going.\" \"Then you'll have to lie back and trust me,\" she whispered. Persephone took his hand in hers and gently set it at her side before leaning down to peck a kiss on the tip of his nose. She dipped her fingers in the oil and rubbed her hands together to warm it, then spread her palms outward across his shoulders, rolling and smoothing the muscles underneath as her hands trailed down his biceps. He let out a contented sigh, feeling relaxed and slumberous when she took his hand within hers and massaged his palm and fingers. She repeated with his other hand, then gathered more oil on her fingers and started anew at his neck, meandering down his hard chest. When her ring finger traced over a flat nipple, his stomach clenched and his cock leapt behind her. It haphazardly smacked against her rear, unintentional and erotic. She smiled at him wickedly and drew quick circles around each peak with the oil, then leaned down to spiral her tongue around one while pinching its mate. Persephone rose and scooted down his body until she rested between his knees and stared up into his lidded eyes. She slicked her hands with a bit more oil and let a few drops fall on his stomach as her hands came to rest on either side of his hard organ. She brought her palms together around the base and squeezed up its length, drawing a groan from him. Aidon shut his eyes and sank back into the mattress and pillows. His wife's hands passed over the sensitive head and a finger pressed against the underside of the crown and trailed down as the other hand came up from the base, each cycle repeating itself until he couldn't tell if she was stroking up or down his length, or if the slickness of her fingers was the oil or traces of his own welled up desire. All Aidoneus knew was that it felt incredible and her motions arched his back from the bed. The attention paid to his cock ceased suddenly and he writhed with unfulfilled want. \"Oh, sweet one...\" \"Lift your hips,\" she said. He did so and she placed a pillow under his flanks so he was propped up, lifting his groin higher. He raised his knees and Persephone pushed his legs further apart. Following her lead, he spread his thighs and she crouched between them, running slick hands down the insides and massaging them until he relaxed again. His breath came in short bursts when she returned her attentions to his throbbing organ and shivered as more oil dripped down the shaft and onto the heavy sac hanging beneath. She caressed his cock with long strokes and cupped her other hand under the weight of his testicles. A drop of oil meandered down his perineum, and another joined it, collecting lower. Her hand closed lightly around his scrotum and she heard him moan softly, his thighs twitching on either side of her body. Ever so slowly, she lowered her lips to the tip of his cock and darted her tongue to taste the oil and a large drop of his essence. He hissed. One hand rested at the base as her lips closed around the tip and the fingers that had been toying with his jewels descended to follow the drops of oil that had fallen. When she pressed a finger into the smooth skin of his perineum, he stopped breathing and lay still. She paused with him. \"Do you trust me?\" \"Of course I do.\" She had never touched him there deliberately, and Aidon recalled when he had pressed his thumb to her own smooth bridge of skin and then her anus while he supped on her earlier that week. \"I think I gave you this idea,\" he said, with a half-smile. \"Didn't I?\" \"You did.\" Persephone demurred, then squeezed his shaft idly, feeling the blood pump through him. She blushed and flitted her eyes away from his intense gaze. \"I... was told that there is a place inside a man... much like the place inside a woman.\" She knew she was asking for a lot. Their society held few sexual taboos, but one poignant rule was that powerful men demonstrated their virility in the bedroom by penetrating others-- and not by being penetrated in any fashion. And her husband was one of the three most powerful beings in all of creation. Perhaps she'd gone too far; crossed an invisible line. \"Husband, if you aren't comfortable with this, with me--\" \"Sweet one,\" Aidon said softly and brushed a lock of hair back from her face, dispelling all her fears with one caress. \"I am more comfortable with you than I am with myself and I trust you implicitly. We said we wanted to know each other in every way possible, did we not?\" \"Yes,\" she said, returning his smile. \"Then let us do so,\" he said, settling back. \"This is between you and I. And I am yours, wife.\" Her smile lit up her face and she flicked her loving gaze at him before returning her attention to her task. Persephone stroked his shaft and his hips rose, his legs part further. She closed her eyes and closed her mouth again over the head, the grip of her fingers working in time with her lips and tongue. Her other hand reached for a generous palmful of oil which she drizzled onto his scrotum and smoothed down the small bridge of flesh underneath it until she came to his opening. He groaned at her touch and she moved her fingers in a slow circle, softening the tight hole with warm oil and the pads of her fingers. Aidon thrashed as she pressed down and drew back to circle the gate and relax his entrance. She sucked at him and licked the underside of his shaft, feeling him sink into the mattress and loosen for her exploration. He sighed and in that moment she pushed forward ever so slowly, her finger coated slick to ease her entry into his passage. A groan cracked in his throat when she delved deeper, her digit slipping beyond the outer ring of his anus and meeting gentle resistance on the other side. She wiggled her finger to spread the oil and he gasped, his mind utterly transported, his conscious thoughts incoherent, his responses orchestrated by her touch. She licked a circle around the rim of his cockhead, and the ring clenched around her finger. He moaned again. Persephone pushed, slowly, patiently, until her digit was buried within him, and she marveled at how scalding hot his interior was, how his muscles spasmed uncontrollably around her invading finger. Her other hand cupped his sac and she descended again, taking his pulsing cock into her mouth. The tip touched the back of her throat and Aidon shook, his body alight with new sensations. She sucked up on the withdrawal and descended again, his entrance clenching hard on her finger. Persephone remembered the ways he gave her pleasure with his hand and slowly curled her finger upward, meeting a soft resistance on the other side. \"Fuck,\" he cursed in pleasure, his breath hissing. He trembled like a leaf and dew beaded on his forehead. Aidon closed his eyes and pleasure radiated out from the place she stroked inside, the place he was not even aware existed, which turned all he perceived into a shifting vertigo of pleasure. His sac tightened against her hand, drawing closer, and his shaft swelled and grew hotter against her lips. Persephone curled her finger again, beckoning him in pleasure in perfect rhythm with her mouth, her hands, her throat... \"Oh gods,\" he moaned roughly. \"Persephone, I'm... I... I...\" He bowed his back and light crackled behind his eyes. Aidon's hands flew to her head and his fingers threaded into her hair. He roared, bucking his hips and filling her mouth with ropes of his seed, thrusting erratically beyond her lips. She swallowed his essence with a moan, gratified by his display of raw pleasure as he abandoned all care, all pretenses, swept away by the sensations she brought forth. His entrance clenched wildly around her finger as he came down, his limbs resting at last, splayed on the sheets. She carefully withdrew from him and crept up the length of the bed to lie next to her husband. Aidoneus was insensate. Persephone looked him over, his body covered with a thin sheen of perspiration and olive oil as his breathing regained some rhythm. An accomplished smirk graced her features. \"Well?\" \"Fates, I've never felt so--\" he stopped and looked at her, his face filled with worry. \"Are you alright? I completely forgot myself when I... I didn't hurt you, did I?\" \"No, you didn't hurt me, my love. I adored your reaction. Speaking of,\" she said rolling onto her side, \"how did that feel?\" He whistled low and ran his hands through his hair. \"Different. Fantastic, but different. Usually at my climax the sensations come directly from here,\" he said, lifting the head of his spent cock. \"But this... it started from within and spread outward... spread everywhere.\" \"Do you feel less apprehension now about... reciprocating?\" Before she could react, Aidoneus reached for Persephone's waist and rolled her onto her back. He lay atop her, his long hair falling around them like a curtain and smiled broadly. \"Certainly.\" \"You'll go slowly?\" Her voice shook at what she'd awoken within him. \"It's impossible for me not to. I'm surprised I can still move after what you did to me.\" She laughed and he pulled away from her to prop her up on a second pillow, raising her hips into the air and opening her thighs. Laughter ceased. His smile faded and his eyes darkened with lust at what lay before him. \"It seems you enjoyed that as much as I did,\" he muttered, swiping a finger through her swollen, glistening folds. \"I did...\" She shivered at his cool touch and her areola tightened into hardened peaks. Her pert breasts caught his attention and he dipped his finger experimentally in the kantharos of oil beside them. He mimicked her, coating his fingers and rubbing his palms together as she had to warm it. His hands went straight to her breasts, lifting them from underneath to squeeze the ivory mounds of flesh, pushing them together, circling them, pulling and pinching at her dusky nipples with gentle fingers. He loved the way they glistened with olive oil, reminding him of her arousal. He spread more oil across her stomach and hips, touching every inch of her skin, working it in, smoothing his hands all the way to her thighs and calves, then the soles of her feet. He pushed his thick fingers into the spaces between her toes and she winced at the stretching before relaxing in pleasure, her tendons and muscles loosened enough for him to massage her feet from toe to heel. His strong hands gripped one ankle and kneaded the length of her calf and thigh before he set about to work on the other. Her head lolled to the side. She sighed, closing her eyes, her arms and shoulders sinking heavily as he methodically slackened the tension in her body. Aidon splayed his hands along her hips and waist, rolling them over skin and muscle until they again rested on her breasts. He circled the softened tips slowly, raising them into tense peaks. Aidon moved over her and drew one into his mouth, tasting the warmth of the oil, then the sweetness of the flesh underneath. He alternated, pulling one peak to a stiff long point with thumb and forefinger as his tongue lashed at the other, then switched to sample its mate. By the time he was done, his wife was breathing raggedly beneath him, her eyes dilated and her chest rising and falling. He licked a meandering trail down her stomach, pausing to dip into the well of her navel, then over the thatch of hair covering her mound. Aidon petted her lips without any oil, not wanting his wife's natural taste adulterated by a first press of olives. He wanted fruit, and honey, and salt. His tongue followed the gentle stroke of his fingers, flattening as it swept over her folds, spearing when he delved inside to taste the nectar that had pooled at her opening. Her voice broke from her throat, and he swiped up again, slowly circling her bud with long, careful strokes. He waited until she was breathing hard and her legs shook against either side of his head. \"Turn over,\" he whispered, his words a sultry heat against her aching flesh. She opened her eyes and languidly obeyed. Before she could settle on her stomach, he grabbed another pillow and pushed it under her, propping her up so high that she had to put the rest of her weight on her knees. Persephone gathered another soft pillow under her head for balance. Her back arched up, her sex protruded from between her legs and cool air nipped at her inflamed flesh. \"What are you--\" \"Shh...\" He hushed her and took in the view. Her fleshy outer lips were ripe and swollen, barely concealing the wet, pink ripples of her folds and the little hood that shielded her clitoris. Aidon dipped down, and she sighed in relief as his hot breath fanned across her labia. He speared his tongue pressing it against the taut source of her pleasure. She hissed and mewled in frustration when he backed away and sat up again, looking her over. Her bottom wiggled in the air and her thighs parted wider to encourage him to return to her tender nub. In doing so, she exposed the puckered entrance that was his ultimate goal-- in her prone position, the little star crowning her delicious sex. The wanton scene before him sent a jolt straight to his loins. Aidon delicately cupped her vulva with one hand. A knuckle ran down the seam and his middle finger unfurled to nestle into her enveloping folds. The digit flexed torturously over her aching bud. He responded as she responded, stilling every time she writhed or ground into his hand for more, and Persephone whimpered, held helplessly at the plateau of pleasure. With his left hand intimately cupping her, he concentrated the other on the rounded curves of her rear, spreading a light sheen of oil across each cheek. He squeezed at the broad muscles underneath. She was still so tense, and leaned too much on her knees. He rubbed in a wide circle and patted at the glistening skin experimentally, feeling it heat up every time his hand met her rump. Persephone looked back at him curiously, her eyes half lidded. Aidon brought his right hand back and swatted her rear. Her startled body ground her sex into his palm and he stroked her with soft caresses, her pained cry resolving into a moan. Instead of lifting away and letting the air cool the sting, he gripped and pressed the heat of it back into her, listening to her punctuated moans. His right hand landed again, pushing her forward with a cry and allowing no escape from the encroaching heat. His finger circled, calming her, transforming pain into pleasure. A dull smack pelted her other cheek, the skin underneath his hand blossoming with fire. Again he stroked her aching sex, and again he kneaded the flesh of her rear until it softened in his hands. He repeated the smack and she melted under his splayed fingers. Aidon massaged through the throbbing skin and deep tissue below. She sank onto the pillows and surrendered to him. Her eyes remained shut and her breath came in ragged, shallow bursts against the sheets. Aidoneus knit his brow. \"Persephone, did I--\" \"No,\" she answered with a harsh whisper, silencing his worries before he could voice them. It wasn't the first time he'd ever spanked her, but when he had, it had been done playfully after coupling. This was the first time he'd used the force of his open hand in the midst of their pleasure to goad her on, to keep her heat rising. The palm wet with her juices had stilled, and she greedily pushed back against it. \"Aidon, please... please...\" Her whispered entreaties made the corner of his mouth twitch into a grin. He lifted his palm from her vulva and came down to eye level with her sex. Aidon leaned his head to the side, kissing the full lips, taking in her scent and feeling the heat of her against his mouth. He circled her with his tongue then doubled back and forth through her folds, pausing to spear into her vaginal entrance before continuing on his path. His heart beat out of his chest. He stood on the brink of unexplored territory and that knowledge sparked something deep within him. Persephone fisted the sheets in her hands and muffled her moan in the pillow when his lips reached the smooth rise of skin between her entrances. He rose along her seam and pulled her cheeks further apart, twirling his tongue along the puckered rim. She shook and shrieked with delight at the new sensation, and Aidon held his wife steady as he lathed the dark entrance before pulling back and reaching for a cupped handful of oil. He followed the trail his tongue had made with the slick liquid and massaged the silken ridges with his fingertip. She contracted and softened at his ministrations, then swirled closer, closer to his goal. With his smallest finger coated with olive oil, she at last opened to him. The outer ring clenched around his invasion and his loins tightened, imagining that constricting ring and blinding hot chasm swallowing his engorged cock. His brow furrowed. He knew his organ was a great deal thicker than his solitary finger, and the desire that overrode all else was his unwillingness to hurt her. She had taken great care while pleasuring him and he lighted on a way to do the same. His other hand settled immediately on her vulva and she loosened. He pushed inside her vagina with one finger and searched for the spongy ridges within. She wriggled, grinding between the thrust of each finger, one buried in her rectum, the other strumming the secret spot within her womanhood. His thumb rocked back and forth across her clitoris, sending sparks through her. He released his little finger from her tight passage and saturated his index and middle finger with oil before returning. With his other hand, one finger joined the other already stroking the ridges within her channel. He steadily pushed in and out at the same time as two digits nudged at the back entrance. \"Aidon... Oh gods, Aidon...\" He slowly worked one finger, then both in to her dark recesses, hearing her groan and repeat his name over and over against the pillow. At last they drove through, her depths clenching all around him, his knuckles now sliding past each other through the thin membrane that separated her passages. He leaned over her, his hardened cock rubbing her thigh and giving him some relief when it touched her. \"How does that feel?\" \"S-so good,\" she slurred. He kissed her at the indent of her waist, then concentrated on the motion of his hands. He worked them in tandem with each other, giving her no respite. As two fingers pushed into her womanhood, the two stretching her untried passage withdrew part way. As they re-entered, he pulled the sopping digits from her channel. Persephone was caught in the maelstrom of an endless cycle of penetration and withdrawal, neither ceasing, always filling, accompanied by the thumb pressed to her clitoris. She drifted on waves of pleasure and didn't care that she was practically howling as she grew closer. Her body wasn't under her control anymore-- it was his, his to have, his to claim, his to fill, and her ultimate surrender sent her hurtling over the edge, screaming her husband's name, coating his hand anew in her nectar. His fingers were squeezed tightly, crushed together, and he steadied her, leaning into her and over her as she bucked and thrashed underneath him. A final high-pitched cry ushered from her throat, then her body went limp. Her hair stuck to her back with a mixture of oil and ardor and she could only form one coherent, whispered sentence. \"Please... please, I need you inside me.\" He took care withdrawing both sets of fingers from her, then at the last moment took another cupped palmful of oil and slid a trail down between his fingers to fill and slick her insides. When his hand met his neglected cock to coat it and ease his entry he gasped, feeling the blood pounding through him as he slicked over head and shaft and foreskin, preparing himself for her. She lay still, anticipating, and the combination of earth-shattering climax and continued wanting started to make her legs shake anew. His urgency had been tempered by his earlier orgasm, but his voice betrayed his desperate need to be within her-- to break new ground and claim this last part of her. \"I love you, Persephone. You'll tell me if--\" \"Yes. I'll tell you.\" She wearily opened her eyes and gazed back at him. \"I'm ready.\" He looked down, his shaft held in one hand, his other rubbing a last coat of oil across the slackened entrance, the orifice opened and spasming from taut pleasure and careful preparation. He leaned forward, feeling another upwelling of his essence slick the head as it pressed against her, then into her. Ever so slowly, the tip passed the barrier. It met resistance, and he steadied himself, willing himself to calm and be staid, despite the overwhelming desire to be within her all at once. She gasped as the head made contact with the inner ring, and tried to calm and accept the mass of him entering her. Persephone winced, squeezing her eyes shut. \"Sweet one?\" He ground out. \"I'm alright.\" \"We can stop...\" \"No...\" She said between sharp breaths. \"Don't. Not now.\" Aidon let her adjust and the spasm of muscles around the head of his cock subsided. He pressed forward again, this time glacially slow. The air filling his lungs hissed in and out between clenched teeth, and he shook, his whole being concentrated on taking her as gently as possible. But he met with such great resistance as he slowly drove into her that he wavered between pressing on or ending their experiment with at least the satisfaction of trying. He was perhaps too large, or she was too small, and they would have to be content with that. Aidon looked down at his wife's face. She was so tense, her breath so shallow. Every nerve he touched flamed to life, and the heady sensations made Persephone dizzy. She tried to relax and stop resisting, and then discovered something peculiar and wonderful. When she pushed back, it sent him deeper with less friction, and she took more of him in. The hidden secret of this pleasure lay in resistance-- of meeting him equally. This was not, could not be an act of submission, and it only worked if she gave as he gave. She tried pushing back again and was sublimely rewarded. Pleasure bloomed all around the thickness of his cock entering her, a ring of fire warming her and spreading its light and heat throughout her being. She was so sensitive there that she could feel his pulse, his very heartbeat echoing inside her, carried through the heavy column of flesh and the vein that ran up its side. He exhaled, feeling her clench around his cock-- not in painful resistance but by drawing him in with the motions of her body-- then the low, guttural moans from both that accompanied their joining. He pushed forward, ever slowly, ever gently, letting her stretch to accommodate his length, his girth, then stopped, realizing that he was at the hilt. His chest grazed her back and he leaned down close to her ear. \"Persephone...\" Her name came out within a sharp moan and he considered asking her again if she were alright, if she hurt, if... if... but he could tell from the waves and heat and softness and tension enclosing and encircling his shaft that she cherished this act as much as he did. Pain existed simply because of the nature of the act, but it hovered just beyond the borders of her pleasure. She contracted and expanded, fluttered around him in every direction. He closed his eyes, blissful and triumphant in the realization that he was buried within the last untouched place she had to offer, his pleasure held in taut vibration by the incredible pressure. \"Persephone...\" Aidon repeated her name and smiled. \"Oh my love, you feel incredible.\" She shook, her body drifting on a sea of pleasure eclipsing pain, the corona of her passage stretched around him the only reminder that it could have been more so. But their preparation had been lengthy, and their union exquisitely gentle. She leaned in the direction of his voice and he surged forward, capturing her mouth and pushing even deeper. Their voices melded between their lips and he withdrew halfway with just as much care as when he entered. Persephone's hand flew behind her to rest on his hipbone and she stopped him, then guided him forward, telling him without words that the distance was as far as he should withdraw. He exhaled against the shell of her ear and slowly pushed back in. Her back arched below him and her elbows started weakening. When they gave out and she fell forward, he caught her with one strong arm, encircling her in the space of another withdrawal and thrust. Aidoneus pelted her shoulders and neck with kisses, then flattened his chest against her back and pulled her up with a hand cupping her breast. He was forced by position and the natural resistance of her body to go slowly. The great pressure around his shaft and the ever-increasing heat closing around the head pushed him close to the brink, but he withheld and refocused with every caress of her skin. He wanted her to come again, with his cock held in her tight chasm. He wanted to know and experience this part of her-- with the part of him meant only for her. He wanted her to reach ecstasy again while he was within her. Persephone's head spun in euphoria, her body lax and open, the whole of her being focused on the gentle rhythm of him sliding out and driving in. Out, in, out, in, pulling her with him in each direction. It didn't have the same feel as their normal intercourse, with the unknown ending and beginning present within and through each other, where they could lose track of the rhythm and just be-- simply feel their union as one being. This was something more visceral-- a pleasure that brought all attention back to the width of him and the weight of him pulling and pushing against the tightness of her entrance. Cool air grazed the front of her quivering body and she realized that her husband had lifted her upright. She leaned forward, supported, his arms circling around her to meld her against his skin. Aidon trailed his hand down her belly and up her thigh, then found the soaked groove of her folds and stroked up and down the crease. His other arm clamped firmly across the front of her and she leaned into it heavily, unable to stay upright on her own. Her voice broke and she writhed, discovering that the pleasure within her, usually eased and refocused by an empty clench around nothing, rebounded in waves through the rest of her body. The light touch of her husband's fingers contrasted powerfully with his cock evenly thrusting behind her and she cried out. His breath was heavy in her ear, his beard scraping against her neck. Her back and his chest were covered with perspiration and traces of olive oil, the contact heightened by the slick interplay of flesh gliding against flesh. He tightened his grasp and increased his speed, comfortable within her, urging her onward, pushing her upward. His fingers worked dark magic against the apex of her mound and his tightening sac rhythmically slapped against her aching lips. \"Come for me.\" He rasped his husky demand into her ear. His ardent voice spiked her pleasure ever higher and he felt it echo within her. \"That's it. My sweet one... my beautiful one... come. Come, my cherished one... Let go... Fall apart with me inside you...\" Persephone crested at Aidoneus' lustful entreaties, rising to unknown heights. Then everything broke and crashed within her. Her ring bore down on his thickness, reverberating in waves throughout her body. Her eyes rolled back and her voice disappeared. Everything collapsed inward before exploding like a nova. Her climax ricocheted through her being from her fingers and toes to the tips of her breasts, to the pressure around his cock, to the flood of her essence drenching his fingers. She heard Aidon's voice rise on the perimeter of her consciousness-- his moans labored and timed with each thrust. He expanded inside her and his hands fell hard on her hips, steadying her as he thrust to the hilt one last time. His whole body stiffened and bowed, his head thrown back and his voice, her name, carrying to the rafters. Waves of his release splashed into her, dragging the last ounces of pleasure from her. His body shook violently as he emptied into her and Aidoneus pinned Persephone tightly against him so the erratic movement of his hips wouldn't hurt her. The knelt like that, their hearts fluttering wildly-- his against her back, hers against his hand. Her head lay back against his shoulder, his chin rested on her neck and all either could hear was their beloved regaining the ability to breathe. Long moments passed. Aidon started pulling away with excruciating care, almost as slowly as he'd first entered her. The flared head gave them resistance and Persephone moaned at the renewed flare of pleasure and small bursts of passing discomfort. He groaned when his overly sensitive penis finally left her. Wordlessly, they crashed onto their sides, careless of the pillows, the empty cup, the tray it sat upon. He smoothed her mussed hair from her back and shoulder and pressed into her, cradling her from behind and stroking the length of her from shoulder to knee. She whimpered when he jostled her hip. \"How are you?\" She smiled, her eyes still closed. Her voice was hoarse. \"A little sore.\" \"Same.\" He chuckled. \"Not even approaching what you must feel, though.\" \"And I'm sticky.\" She smiled and wriggled around. The olive oil was cloying against her skin. \"I have just the thing for that.\" He rose from the bed slowly, his knees still shaking. Aidoneus took the water thief with him to fill it in the rushing waterfall outside their antechamber. The light was dimming along the Styx and evening had settled across the reaches of Chthonia. When he returned to the room he held the dripping bronze sphere toward the fire for a minute until it heated, then emptied its contents into the marble sink basin. He came back to the spent pile of limbs that was his wife and gathered her up in his arms. \"Come here; up you go.\" \"I have little choice in the matter,\" she giggled weakly, pulling one arm around his neck as he scooped up the back of her knees with the other. He smiled and nuzzled her, then stood with her in his arms, kissing her full on the lips, his tongue dipping and twining with hers, their mingled tastes tinged with olive oil. She pulled back breathlessly. He brushed the tip of his nose against hers again, then gently set her down beside the hearth fire. The stone cooled her skin, making contact and drawing the excess heat from her sore cheeks and inflamed lips. Aidoneus grabbed a sponge and ran it first across her back, dipping it in the water and scraping its rough surface along every inch of her skin. She luxuriated against his enfolding arm, her eyes closing as his ministrations traced each of her limbs with utmost care. He stood her up to clean her thighs and his face fell when he saw the pink handprints on her rump. \"I shouldn't have done that,\" he muttered, shaking his head. \"Done what?\" \"Spanked you. I should always remember that...\" He cast his eyes to the floor. She searched his thoughts as he trailed off and saw a familiar vision of them plunging through fire, her cry of pain in the dark when he claimed her as his wife. \"Aidoneus, my love, you did nothing wrong.\" \"After I took you from the world above, I promised myself. I swore I would never hurt you again.\" \"You didn't.\" \"What do you call that, then?\" He traced the radial of bruises his fingertips had left on her hips. \"Aidon, look at me,\" she said, cupping him at his jaw line. \"Isn't it time you forgive yourself for the very thing I forgave not a month after you brought me here? We both know why it needed to be done.\" He looked at her thoughtfully, but his brow furrowed again, and he averted his eyes from her searching gaze. She brought his focus back to her. \"You didn't hurt me. Not once in all of this, in an act that could have because,\" she said, pointed looking at his groin, \"well, you're by no means small.\" He guffawed and looked away from her, embarrassed, before staring into her bright blue gray eyes. She took the sponge from him and wrung it out in the warm water before she administered to him, brushing it over his chest and arms, his long legs. \"I admit I was curious,\" she continued while she worked, \"but also a little frightened by this. I wanted it, to know all of you as I'd said, but was so nervous I didn't want to ask you directly. And you were nervous, too, and you too kept silent, and I knew that you were withholding asking because you care deeply for me.\" \"I only ever wanted to protect you. And I think I try to protect you from myself, sometimes.\" \"Aidon, you don't have to. We trust each other. We love each other. But it saddens me every time you hold back from me, and from yourself. Tonight was one of those rare times you were able to bring down all your walls, and just let me in and be with me. And I loved it.\" He took her hand within his and stood her up in front of him. \"You did?\" \"Of course I did.\" \"Everything?\" He traced her disappearing bruises. \"All of it. Through and through. You promised yourself you'd never hurt me, but now I want you to promise me something. Can you?\" \"I would give you anything. You know that.\" \"Then promise me-- as I will promise you now-- that we won't ever let our fear of each other come between us again. Or stand between the pleasure we share as husband and wife. Can you do that with me?\" He held her arms, stroking the curve of her shoulders with his thumbs, then wrapped himself around her, drawing her against his chest. His head dipped until his nose rested atop her head. \"I will. I promise.\" She closed her eyes and listened to the crackle of the fire and warmed in his arms as he rocked her to and fro. \"Promise me something in turn,\" he said. \"That you will care for yourself, not put the world upon your shoulders, and if anything I do causes you any harm of any kind, you will tell me?\" \"I shall,\" she answered. He kissed her and breathed in the scent of her hair. Persephone melted into him, relieved and pleasantly tired. \"Though... I think that anything else we might try will have to wait at least until tomorrow.\" His torso shook with laughter. \"That's fine by me. Shall we turn in early to bed?\" \"I had a better idea,\" she said, grabbing a large, black fleece from the bed in one hand and pulling along Aidoneus with her other. \"Have you ever slept under the stars in the Elysian Fields?\"",

      "I fear I pressed you to say what I wanted to hear that day.\"",
      "\"To say that we both want to know all of each other?\"",
      "\"You know what I mean.\"",
      "\"My love,\" she said, \"We can read each other's thoughts and feelings with perfect openness.",
      "We journeyed through and within each other during the hieros gamos.",
      "We experienced the past, the future, the cosmos itself on its grandest scale with our souls entwined, and we created Elysion itself as omnipotent Halves of one great Whole.",
      "And you're worried about asking me if I want to explore every facet of each other on this plane of existence?\"",
      "\"I don't want to hurt you.",
      "If we do... explore...",
      "I want it to be as pleasurable for you as I can make it.\"",
      "\"It can be, if...\" Persephone fidgeted and a blush spread across her face and bosom.",
      "\"Aidon, I...",
      "I spoke with Hypnos.\"",
      "He spun around and was about to protest and admonish until she raised her finger.",
      "\"Before you say anything, didn't you once tell me that you sought out his brother for advice of a certain nature regarding me?\"",
      "\"That was a long time ago.\"",
      "\"Not so long ago, though.",
      "And judging by the results of your conversation with Thanatos, I know it to be a good thing.\"",
      "He gleaned her thoughts and curiously found a clear vision of a kantharos cup filled with a first pressing of olive oil sitting next to the hearth in their bedroom.",
      "He raised his eyebrows.",
      "\"You're sure about this?\"",
      "\"Yes.",
      "Do you trust me?\" \"'Do you trust me ', should be the real question,\" he scoffed.",
      "\"You're the one who stands to be harmed by my lack of experience.\"",
      "\"I have none to speak of either, but I have an inkling of how we should go about it.",
      "And I believe you do too.\"",
      "She traced her fingers over his bearded jaw line and tilted her head up.",
      "His lips hesitantly met hers and she drew him into a kiss.",
      "His anxiety shattered when her tongue traced over his lips, seeking entry.",
      "Aidon relaxed and gathered her into an embrace as Persephone whispered against his lips.",
      "\"'With careful preparation.'",
      "Wasn't that what you said?\"",
      "She repeated his words against his ear, kissing him at his temple.",
      "\"In our room, 'when we are both relaxed' you told me, 'and able to go slowly'.\"",
      "His pupils dilated and darkened and he pulled at her earlobe with his lips before matching her low voice.",
      "\"The last thing I imagined was you seducing me into this.\"",
      "\"And judging from our history, I think that your expectations are often exceeded by the outcome, Aidoneus.\"",
      "She wiggled against him and delighted in his strained expression.",
      "He groaned and pulled her closer.",
      "His body responded to hers, his groin warm and hardening against her abdomen, his want made explicit when he ground against her.",
      "He tightened his limbs around her frame and dove in for a deeper kiss, sucking on each of her lips and mating his tongue with hers.",
      "Aidon broke the kiss and held back, teasing her, letting her pull closer to him with a whimper.",
      "\"I suppose we'll have to see where this takes us...\" \"Then there's only one place to go,\" she said.",
      "Fire bloomed into a twisting gyre as she opened a pathway through the ether behind her, then she stepped backwards, yanking him by the front of his tunic.",
      "Vertigo gripped Aidoneus and his eyes grew wide as he was pulled, falling forward.",
      "He landed on top of Persephone and instantly propped himself up on his wrists with his giggling wife beneath him, her legs on either side of his waist and her hair tousled from landing on the mattress.",
      "It took a moment to realize that she had taken them from Elysion straight to their bed.",
      "He joined in her laughter then set to work loosening the ribbon holding her hair into a chignon.",
      "\"We've never done that before...\" \"Hopefully not the only new thing we'll try.\"",
      "He fitted his body over hers and kissed her, unwrapping the last of her hair and fanning it out on the pillow behind her.",
      "She tugged at his himation, pulling it from his shoulder.",
      "He took over her movements and pushed it to the side of the bed until it fell into a heap on the floor.",
      "Her girdle came next, the jewels clinking together, and the fibulae holding up her peplos and his tunic soon joined it.",
      "In their two years of marriage, they had settled into a comfortable familiarity in bed.",
      "A routine had developed-- one that pleased them both greatly.",
      "Every night she spent with him during winter, they would undress each other, piece by piece, their clothes piled up on the left side of the bed.",
      "He would ensure that she reached her pleasure before he entered her.",
      "Variety was had in a graceful dance and twist of positions-- some favored more than others-- before they would collapse into euphoric afterglow then sound sleep in each other arms.",
      "When they awoke, they would often reprise their love and desire before starting their day.",
      "They made love, they coupled, they fucked, but always with her supple channel grasping at his phallus, the tip touching the mouth of her womb.",
      "Several nights ago, he had pressed his thumb against the puckered gateway of her untried passage while he was expertly tonguing her folds.",
      "The experience had her clenching her thighs tightly against his ears and bowing her back so violently that she'd sat upright and screamed her pleasure.",
      "But he hadn't dared to take it any further than that.",
      "Tonight she wanted to explore what made her react so intensely.",
      "Persephone untied his belt and freed Aidoneus of his tunic.",
      "He casually balled up her peplos and threw it aside.",
      "She delighted in the feeling of skin on skin, an electric closeness that portended all the greater things to come.",
      "His kisses were ravenous and his glans butted up against her vulva, his body at war with his mind's desire to go slowly.",
      "He desperately wanted her.",
      "Persephone pressed a hand to his chest.",
      "He paused, reveling in the sensation of her inner lips fluttering against the head of his cock, her entrance kissing the tip, her body itself belying her words.",
      "\"We should relax first.\"",
      "\"I can't think of anything that will relax me faster than fucking you, sweet one,\" Aidon purred.",
      "To make his point he pushed forward a fraction of an inch, and their breath caught in their throats.",
      "His control was slipping.",
      "She licked her lips and tried not to meet his incremental penetration or squeeze around him.",
      "It would end his willpower and she would be all too happy to be swept away with it.",
      "\"I think we should try putting what I learned to use, instead.\"",
      "Aidoneus withdrew completely and swallowed the sizable lump in his throat.",
      "\"That's not wise, my love.",
      "I want you too much right now, if you couldn't tell.",
      "I don't want to hurt you.\"",
      "\"Then you need to lie back,\" she said, slithering out from underneath him, \"and trust me, Aidon.\"",
      "She stood up from the bed and glanced over her shoulder at him.",
      "Aidon's fingers clenched on the sheets, wanting to grab her by the waist and pull her back under him, to plunge into her warm wet depths with animalistic fervor until they shattered in each other's arms.",
      "Persephone pulled back the curtain of their bed to reveal their room and walked to the glowing hearth fire.",
      "Upon its ledge sat a bronze tray and the wide kantharos from her mind's eye.",
      "Aidon lay on his back watching her.",
      "\"You planned this, didn't you?\"",
      "\"I may have,\" she said with a smile.",
      "\"Not for it to go exactly this way, but I certainly left this here for us before I went to Elysion this morning.",
      "I planned to at least discuss it with you tonight.\"",
      "Persephone was giddy to uncover his desires when he found her under the apple tree, to know that this forbidden need consumed his thoughts as it had hers.",
      "Persephone picked up the tray and walked back toward the bed, her skin glowing in the firelight, the tray resting in her hands.",
      "Aidon licked his lips and watched her intently, her slow pace like that of some heathen priestess bearing an offering to the altar where he was stretched out in sacrifice.",
      "She set it down on the sheets a ways away from them and Aidon caught a glimpse of the viscous shimmer of olive oil within the cup.",
      "Persephone crawled over him and straddled his stomach, the scent of flowers rising from her body.",
      "He looked up at her and ran his hand up her thigh then her belly and ribs to cup and mold a breast.",
      "His thumb passed over the taut peak and he spoke, his voice hoarse.",
      "\"I suppose you want me to follow your lead, but I'm not sure where you're going.\"",
      "\"Then you'll have to lie back and trust me,\" she whispered.",
      "Persephone took his hand in hers and gently set it at her side before leaning down to peck a kiss on the tip of his nose.",
      "She dipped her fingers in the oil and rubbed her hands together to warm it, then spread her palms outward across his shoulders, rolling and smoothing the muscles underneath as her hands trailed down his biceps.",
      "He let out a contented sigh, feeling relaxed and slumberous when she took his hand within hers and massaged his palm and fingers.",
      "She repeated with his other hand, then gathered more oil on her fingers and started anew at his neck, meandering down his hard chest.",
      "When her ring finger traced over a flat nipple, his stomach clenched and his cock leapt behind her.",
      "It haphazardly smacked against her rear, unintentional and erotic.",
      "She smiled at him wickedly and drew quick circles around each peak with the oil, then leaned down to spiral her tongue around one while pinching its mate.",
      "Persephone rose and scooted down his body until she rested between his knees and stared up into his lidded eyes.",
      "She slicked her hands with a bit more oil and let a few drops fall on his stomach as her hands came to rest on either side of his hard organ.",
      "She brought her palms together around the base and squeezed up its length, drawing a groan from him.",
      "Aidon shut his eyes and sank back into the mattress and pillows.",
      "His wife's hands passed over the sensitive head and a finger pressed against the underside of the crown and trailed down as the other hand came up from the base, each cycle repeating itself until he couldn't tell if she was stroking up or down his length, or if the slickness of her fingers was the oil or traces of his own welled up desire.",
      "All Aidoneus knew was that it felt incredible and her motions arched his back from the bed.",
      "The attention paid to his cock ceased suddenly and he writhed with unfulfilled want.",
      "\"Oh, sweet one...\" \"Lift your hips,\" she said.",
      "He did so and she placed a pillow under his flanks so he was propped up, lifting his groin higher.",
      "He raised his knees and Persephone pushed his legs further apart.",
      "Following her lead, he spread his thighs and she crouched between them, running slick hands down the insides and massaging them until he relaxed again.",
      "His breath came in short bursts when she returned her attentions to his throbbing organ and shivered as more oil dripped down the shaft and onto the heavy sac hanging beneath.",
      "She caressed his cock with long strokes and cupped her other hand under the weight of his testicles.",
      "A drop of oil meandered down his perineum, and another joined it, collecting lower.",
      "Her hand closed lightly around his scrotum and she heard him moan softly, his thighs twitching on either side of her body.",
      "Ever so slowly, she lowered her lips to the tip of his cock and darted her tongue to taste the oil and a large drop of his essence.",
      "He hissed.",
      "One hand rested at the base as her lips closed around the tip and the fingers that had been toying with his jewels descended to follow the drops of oil that had fallen.",
      "When she pressed a finger into the smooth skin of his perineum, he stopped breathing and lay still.",
      "She paused with him.",
      "\"Do you trust me?\"",
      "\"Of course I do.\"",
      "She had never touched him there deliberately, and Aidon recalled when he had pressed his thumb to her own smooth bridge of skin and then her anus while he supped on her earlier that week.",
      "\"I think I gave you this idea,\" he said, with a half-smile.",
      "\"Didn't I?\"",
      "\"You did.\"",
      "Persephone demurred, then squeezed his shaft idly, feeling the blood pump through him.",
      "She blushed and flitted her eyes away from his intense gaze.",
      "\"I... was told that there is a place inside a man... much like the place inside a woman.\"",
      "She knew she was asking for a lot.",
      "Their society held few sexual taboos, but one poignant rule was that powerful men demonstrated their virility in the bedroom by penetrating others-- and not by being penetrated in any fashion.",
      "And her husband was one of the three most powerful beings in all of creation.",
      "Perhaps she'd gone too far; crossed an invisible line.",
      "\"Husband, if you aren't comfortable with this, with me--\" \"Sweet one,\" Aidon said softly and brushed a lock of hair back from her face, dispelling all her fears with one caress.",
      "\"I am more comfortable with you than I am with myself and I trust you implicitly.",
      "We said we wanted to know each other in every way possible, did we not?\"",
      "\"Yes,\" she said, returning his smile.",
      "\"Then let us do so,\" he said, settling back.",
      "\"This is between you and I. And I am yours, wife.\"",
      "Her smile lit up her face and she flicked her loving gaze at him before returning her attention to her task.",
      "Persephone stroked his shaft and his hips rose, his legs part further.",
      "She closed her eyes and closed her mouth again over the head, the grip of her fingers working in time with her lips and tongue.",
      "Her other hand reached for a generous palmful of oil which she drizzled onto his scrotum and smoothed down the small bridge of flesh underneath it until she came to his opening.",
      "He groaned at her touch and she moved her fingers in a slow circle, softening the tight hole with warm oil and the pads of her fingers.",
      "Aidon thrashed as she pressed down and drew back to circle the gate and relax his entrance.",
      "She sucked at him and licked the underside of his shaft, feeling him sink into the mattress and loosen for her exploration.",
      "He sighed and in that moment she pushed forward ever so slowly, her finger coated slick to ease her entry into his passage.",
      "A groan cracked in his throat when she delved deeper, her digit slipping beyond the outer ring of his anus and meeting gentle resistance on the other side.",
      "She wiggled her finger to spread the oil and he gasped, his mind utterly transported, his conscious thoughts incoherent, his responses orchestrated by her touch.",
      "She licked a circle around the rim of his cockhead, and the ring clenched around her finger.",
      "He moaned again.",
      "Persephone pushed, slowly, patiently, until her digit was buried within him, and she marveled at how scalding hot his interior was, how his muscles spasmed uncontrollably around her invading finger.",
      "Her other hand cupped his sac and she descended again, taking his pulsing cock into her mouth.",
      "The tip touched the back of her throat and Aidon shook, his body alight with new sensations.",
      "She sucked up on the withdrawal and descended again, his entrance clenching hard on her finger.",
      "Persephone remembered the ways he gave her pleasure with his hand and slowly curled her finger upward, meeting a soft resistance on the other side.",
      "\"Fuck,\" he cursed in pleasure, his breath hissing.",
      "He trembled like a leaf and dew beaded on his forehead.",
      "Aidon closed his eyes and pleasure radiated out from the place she stroked inside, the place he was not even aware existed, which turned all he perceived into a shifting vertigo of pleasure.",
      "His sac tightened against her hand, drawing closer, and his shaft swelled and grew hotter against her lips.",
      "Persephone curled her finger again, beckoning him in pleasure in perfect rhythm with her mouth, her hands, her throat...",
      "\"Oh gods,\" he moaned roughly.",
      "\"Persephone, I'm... I... I...\" He bowed his back and light crackled behind his eyes.",
      "Aidon's hands flew to her head and his fingers threaded into her hair.",
      "He roared, bucking his hips and filling her mouth with ropes of his seed, thrusting erratically beyond her lips.",
      "She swallowed his essence with a moan, gratified by his display of raw pleasure as he abandoned all care, all pretenses, swept away by the sensations she brought forth.",
      "His entrance clenched wildly around her finger as he came down, his limbs resting at last, splayed on the sheets.",
      "She carefully withdrew from him and crept up the length of the bed to lie next to her husband.",
      "Aidoneus was insensate.",
      "Persephone looked him over, his body covered with a thin sheen of perspiration and olive oil as his breathing regained some rhythm.",
      "An accomplished smirk graced her features.",
      "\"Well?\" \"Fates, I've never felt so--\" he stopped and looked at her, his face filled with worry.",
      "\"Are you alright?",
      "I completely forgot myself when I... I didn't hurt you, did I?\"",
      "\"No, you didn't hurt me, my love.",
      "I adored your reaction.",
      "Speaking of,\" she said rolling onto her side, \"how did that feel?\"",
      "He whistled low and ran his hands through his hair.",
      "\"Different.",
      "Fantastic, but different.",
      "Usually at my climax the sensations come directly from here,\" he said, lifting the head of his spent cock.",
      "\"But this... it started from within and spread outward... spread everywhere.\"",
      "\"Do you feel less apprehension now about... reciprocating?\"",
      "Before she could react, Aidoneus reached for Persephone's waist and rolled her onto her back.",
      "He lay atop her, his long hair falling around them like a curtain and smiled broadly.",
      "\"Certainly.\"",
      "\"You'll go slowly?\"",
      "Her voice shook at what she'd awoken within him.",
      "\"It's impossible for me not to.",
      "I'm surprised I can still move after what you did to me.\"",
      "She laughed and he pulled away from her to prop her up on a second pillow, raising her hips into the air and opening her thighs.",
      "Laughter ceased.",
      "His smile faded and his eyes darkened with lust at what lay before him.",
      "\"It seems you enjoyed that as much as I did,\" he muttered, swiping a finger through her swollen, glistening folds.",
      "\"I did...\" She shivered at his cool touch and her areola tightened into hardened peaks.",
      "Her pert breasts caught his attention and he dipped his finger experimentally in the kantharos of oil beside them.",
      "He mimicked her, coating his fingers and rubbing his palms together as she had to warm it.",
      "His hands went straight to her breasts, lifting them from underneath to squeeze the ivory mounds of flesh, pushing them together, circling them, pulling and pinching at her dusky nipples with gentle fingers.",
      "He loved the way they glistened with olive oil, reminding him of her arousal.",
      "He spread more oil across her stomach and hips, touching every inch of her skin, working it in, smoothing his hands all the way to her thighs and calves, then the soles of her feet.",
      "He pushed his thick fingers into the spaces between her toes and she winced at the stretching before relaxing in pleasure, her tendons and muscles loosened enough for him to massage her feet from toe to heel.",
      "His strong hands gripped one ankle and kneaded the length of her calf and thigh before he set about to work on the other.",
      "Her head lolled to the side.",
      "She sighed, closing her eyes, her arms and shoulders sinking heavily as he methodically slackened the tension in her body.",
      "Aidon splayed his hands along her hips and waist, rolling them over skin and muscle until they again rested on her breasts.",
      "He circled the softened tips slowly, raising them into tense peaks.",
      "Aidon moved over her and drew one into his mouth, tasting the warmth of the oil, then the sweetness of the flesh underneath.",
      "He alternated, pulling one peak to a stiff long point with thumb and forefinger as his tongue lashed at the other, then switched to sample its mate.",
      "By the time he was done, his wife was breathing raggedly beneath him, her eyes dilated and her chest rising and falling.",
      "He licked a meandering trail down her stomach, pausing to dip into the well of her navel, then over the thatch of hair covering her mound.",
      "Aidon petted her lips without any oil, not wanting his wife's natural taste adulterated by a first press of olives.",
      "He wanted fruit, and honey, and salt.",
      "His tongue followed the gentle stroke of his fingers, flattening as it swept over her folds, spearing when he delved inside to taste the nectar that had pooled at her opening.",
      "Her voice broke from her throat, and he swiped up again, slowly circling her bud with long, careful strokes.",
      "He waited until she was breathing hard and her legs shook against either side of his head.",
      "\"Turn over,\" he whispered, his words a sultry heat against her aching flesh.",
      "She opened her eyes and languidly obeyed.",
      "Before she could settle on her stomach, he grabbed another pillow and pushed it under her, propping her up so high that she had to put the rest of her weight on her knees.",
      "Persephone gathered another soft pillow under her head for balance.",
      "Her back arched up, her sex protruded from between her legs and cool air nipped at her inflamed flesh.",
      "\"What are you--\" \"Shh...\" He hushed her and took in the view.",
      "Her fleshy outer lips were ripe and swollen, barely concealing the wet, pink ripples of her folds and the little hood that shielded her clitoris.",
      "Aidon dipped down, and she sighed in relief as his hot breath fanned across her labia.",
      "He speared his tongue pressing it against the taut source of her pleasure.",
      "She hissed and mewled in frustration when he backed away and sat up again, looking her over.",
      "Her bottom wiggled in the air and her thighs parted wider to encourage him to return to her tender nub.",
      "In doing so, she exposed the puckered entrance that was his ultimate goal-- in her prone position, the little star crowning her delicious sex.",
      "The wanton scene before him sent a jolt straight to his loins.",
      "Aidon delicately cupped her vulva with one hand.",
      "A knuckle ran down the seam and his middle finger unfurled to nestle into her enveloping folds.",
      "The digit flexed torturously over her aching bud.",
      "He responded as she responded, stilling every time she writhed or ground into his hand for more, and Persephone whimpered, held helplessly at the plateau of pleasure.",
      "With his left hand intimately cupping her, he concentrated the other on the rounded curves of her rear, spreading a light sheen of oil across each cheek.",
      "He squeezed at the broad muscles underneath.",
      "She was still so tense, and leaned too much on her knees.",
      "He rubbed in a wide circle and patted at the glistening skin experimentally, feeling it heat up every time his hand met her rump.",
      "Persephone looked back at him curiously, her eyes half lidded.",
      "Aidon brought his right hand back and swatted her rear.",
      "Her startled body ground her sex into his palm and he stroked her with soft caresses, her pained cry resolving into a moan.",
      "Instead of lifting away and letting the air cool the sting, he gripped and pressed the heat of it back into her, listening to her punctuated moans.",
      "His right hand landed again, pushing her forward with a cry and allowing no escape from the encroaching heat.",
      "His finger circled, calming her, transforming pain into pleasure.",
      "A dull smack pelted her other cheek, the skin underneath his hand blossoming with fire.",
      "Again he stroked her aching sex, and again he kneaded the flesh of her rear until it softened in his hands.",
      "He repeated the smack and she melted under his splayed fingers.",
      "Aidon massaged through the throbbing skin and deep tissue below.",
      "She sank onto the pillows and surrendered to him.",
      "Her eyes remained shut and her breath came in ragged, shallow bursts against the sheets.",
      "Aidoneus knit his brow.",
      "\"Persephone, did I--\" \"No,\" she answered with a harsh whisper, silencing his worries before he could voice them.",
      "It wasn't the first time he'd ever spanked her, but when he had, it had been done playfully after coupling.",
      "This was the first time he'd used the force of his open hand in the midst of their pleasure to goad her on, to keep her heat rising.",
      "The palm wet with her juices had stilled, and she greedily pushed back against it.",
      "\"Aidon, please... please...\" Her whispered entreaties made the corner of his mouth twitch into a grin.",
      "He lifted his palm from her vulva and came down to eye level with her sex.",
      "Aidon leaned his head to the side, kissing the full lips, taking in her scent and feeling the heat of her against his mouth.",
      "He circled her with his tongue then doubled back and forth through her folds, pausing to spear into her vaginal entrance before continuing on his path.",
      "His heart beat out of his chest.",
      "He stood on the brink of unexplored territory and that knowledge sparked something deep within him.",
      "Persephone fisted the sheets in her hands and muffled her moan in the pillow when his lips reached the smooth rise of skin between her entrances.",
      "He rose along her seam and pulled her cheeks further apart, twirling his tongue along the puckered rim.",
      "She shook and shrieked with delight at the new sensation, and Aidon held his wife steady as he lathed the dark entrance before pulling back and reaching for a cupped handful of oil.",
      "He followed the trail his tongue had made with the slick liquid and massaged the silken ridges with his fingertip.",
      "She contracted and softened at his ministrations, then swirled closer, closer to his goal.",
      "With his smallest finger coated with olive oil, she at last opened to him.",
      "The outer ring clenched around his invasion and his loins tightened, imagining that constricting ring and blinding hot chasm swallowing his engorged cock.",
      "His brow furrowed.",
      "He knew his organ was a great deal thicker than his solitary finger, and the desire that overrode all else was his unwillingness to hurt her.",
      "She had taken great care while pleasuring him and he lighted on a way to do the same.",
      "His other hand settled immediately on her vulva and she loosened.",
      "He pushed inside her vagina with one finger and searched for the spongy ridges within.",
      "She wriggled, grinding between the thrust of each finger, one buried in her rectum, the other strumming the secret spot within her womanhood.",
      "His thumb rocked back and forth across her clitoris, sending sparks through her.",
      "He released his little finger from her tight passage and saturated his index and middle finger with oil before returning.",
      "With his other hand, one finger joined the other already stroking the ridges within her channel.",
      "He steadily pushed in and out at the same time as two digits nudged at the back entrance.",
      "\"Aidon...",
      "Oh gods, Aidon...\" He slowly worked one finger, then both in to her dark recesses, hearing her groan and repeat his name over and over against the pillow.",
      "At last they drove through, her depths clenching all around him, his knuckles now sliding past each other through the thin membrane that separated her passages.",
      "He leaned over her, his hardened cock rubbing her thigh and giving him some relief when it touched her.",
      "\"How does that feel?\"",
      "\"S-so good,\" she slurred.",
      "He kissed her at the indent of her waist, then concentrated on the motion of his hands.",
      "He worked them in tandem with each other, giving her no respite.",
      "As two fingers pushed into her womanhood, the two stretching her untried passage withdrew part way.",
      "As they re-entered, he pulled the sopping digits from her channel.",
      "Persephone was caught in the maelstrom of an endless cycle of penetration and withdrawal, neither ceasing, always filling, accompanied by the thumb pressed to her clitoris.",
      "She drifted on waves of pleasure and didn't care that she was practically howling as she grew closer.",
      "Her body wasn't under her control anymore-- it was his, his to have, his to claim, his to fill, and her ultimate surrender sent her hurtling over the edge, screaming her husband's name, coating his hand anew in her nectar.",
      "His fingers were squeezed tightly, crushed together, and he steadied her, leaning into her and over her as she bucked and thrashed underneath him.",
      "A final high-pitched cry ushered from her throat, then her body went limp.",
      "Her hair stuck to her back with a mixture of oil and ardor and she could only form one coherent, whispered sentence.",
      "\"Please... please, I need you inside me.\"",
      "He took care withdrawing both sets of fingers from her, then at the last moment took another cupped palmful of oil and slid a trail down between his fingers to fill and slick her insides.",
      "When his hand met his neglected cock to coat it and ease his entry he gasped, feeling the blood pounding through him as he slicked over head and shaft and foreskin, preparing himself for her.",
      "She lay still, anticipating, and the combination of earth-shattering climax and continued wanting started to make her legs shake anew.",
      "His urgency had been tempered by his earlier orgasm, but his voice betrayed his desperate need to be within her-- to break new ground and claim this last part of her.",
      "\"I love you, Persephone.",
      "You'll tell me if--\" \"Yes.",
      "I'll tell you.\"",
      "She wearily opened her eyes and gazed back at him.",
      "\"I'm ready.\"",
      "He looked down, his shaft held in one hand, his other rubbing a last coat of oil across the slackened entrance, the orifice opened and spasming from taut pleasure and careful preparation.",
      "He leaned forward, feeling another upwelling of his essence slick the head as it pressed against her, then into her.",
      "Ever so slowly, the tip passed the barrier.",
      "It met resistance, and he steadied himself, willing himself to calm and be staid, despite the overwhelming desire to be within her all at once.",
      "She gasped as the head made contact with the inner ring, and tried to calm and accept the mass of him entering her.",
      "Persephone winced, squeezing her eyes shut.",
      "\"Sweet one?\"",
      "He ground out.",
      "\"I'm alright.\"",
      "\"We can stop...\" \"No...\" She said between sharp breaths.",
      "\"Don't.",
      "Not now.\"",
      "Aidon let her adjust and the spasm of muscles around the head of his cock subsided.",
      "He pressed forward again, this time glacially slow.",
      "The air filling his lungs hissed in and out between clenched teeth, and he shook, his whole being concentrated on taking her as gently as possible.",
      "But he met with such great resistance as he slowly drove into her that he wavered between pressing on or ending their experiment with at least the satisfaction of trying.",
      "He was perhaps too large, or she was too small, and they would have to be content with that.",
      "Aidon looked down at his wife's face.",
      "She was so tense, her breath so shallow.",
      "Every nerve he touched flamed to life, and the heady sensations made Persephone dizzy.",
      "She tried to relax and stop resisting, and then discovered something peculiar and wonderful.",
      "When she pushed back, it sent him deeper with less friction, and she took more of him in.",
      "The hidden secret of this pleasure lay in resistance-- of meeting him equally.",
      "This was not, could not be an act of submission, and it only worked if she gave as he gave.",
      "She tried pushing back again and was sublimely rewarded.",
      "Pleasure bloomed all around the thickness of his cock entering her, a ring of fire warming her and spreading its light and heat throughout her being.",
      "She was so sensitive there that she could feel his pulse, his very heartbeat echoing inside her, carried through the heavy column of flesh and the vein that ran up its side.",
      "He exhaled, feeling her clench around his cock-- not in painful resistance but by drawing him in with the motions of her body-- then the low, guttural moans from both that accompanied their joining.",
      "He pushed forward, ever slowly, ever gently, letting her stretch to accommodate his length, his girth, then stopped, realizing that he was at the hilt.",
      "His chest grazed her back and he leaned down close to her ear.",
      "\"Persephone...\" Her name came out within a sharp moan and he considered asking her again if she were alright, if she hurt, if... if... but he could tell from the waves and heat and softness and tension enclosing and encircling his shaft that she cherished this act as much as he did.",
      "Pain existed simply because of the nature of the act, but it hovered just beyond the borders of her pleasure.",
      "She contracted and expanded, fluttered around him in every direction.",
      "He closed his eyes, blissful and triumphant in the realization that he was buried within the last untouched place she had to offer, his pleasure held in taut vibration by the incredible pressure.",
      "\"Persephone...\" Aidon repeated her name and smiled.",
      "\"Oh my love, you feel incredible.\"",
      "She shook, her body drifting on a sea of pleasure eclipsing pain, the corona of her passage stretched around him the only reminder that it could have been more so.",
      "But their preparation had been lengthy, and their union exquisitely gentle.",
      "She leaned in the direction of his voice and he surged forward, capturing her mouth and pushing even deeper.",
      "Their voices melded between their lips and he withdrew halfway with just as much care as when he entered.",
      "Persephone's hand flew behind her to rest on his hipbone and she stopped him, then guided him forward, telling him without words that the distance was as far as he should withdraw.",
      "He exhaled against the shell of her ear and slowly pushed back in.",
      "Her back arched below him and her elbows started weakening.",
      "When they gave out and she fell forward, he caught her with one strong arm, encircling her in the space of another withdrawal and thrust.",
      "Aidoneus pelted her shoulders and neck with kisses, then flattened his chest against her back and pulled her up with a hand cupping her breast.",
      "He was forced by position and the natural resistance of her body to go slowly.",
      "The great pressure around his shaft and the ever-increasing heat closing around the head pushed him close to the brink, but he withheld and refocused with every caress of her skin.",
      "He wanted her to come again, with his cock held in her tight chasm.",
      "He wanted to know and experience this part of her-- with the part of him meant only for her.",
      "He wanted her to reach ecstasy again while he was within her.",
      "Persephone's head spun in euphoria, her body lax and open, the whole of her being focused on the gentle rhythm of him sliding out and driving in.",
      "Out, in, out, in, pulling her with him in each direction.",
      "It didn't have the same feel as their normal intercourse, with the unknown ending and beginning present within and through each other, where they could lose track of the rhythm and just be-- simply feel their union as one being.",
      "This was something more visceral-- a pleasure that brought all attention back to the width of him and the weight of him pulling and pushing against the tightness of her entrance.",
      "Cool air grazed the front of her quivering body and she realized that her husband had lifted her upright.",
      "She leaned forward, supported, his arms circling around her to meld her against his skin.",
      "Aidon trailed his hand down her belly and up her thigh, then found the soaked groove of her folds and stroked up and down the crease.",
      "His other arm clamped firmly across the front of her and she leaned into it heavily, unable to stay upright on her own.",
      "Her voice broke and she writhed, discovering that the pleasure within her, usually eased and refocused by an empty clench around nothing, rebounded in waves through the rest of her body.",
      "The light touch of her husband's fingers contrasted powerfully with his cock evenly thrusting behind her and she cried out.",
      "His breath was heavy in her ear, his beard scraping against her neck.",
      "Her back and his chest were covered with perspiration and traces of olive oil, the contact heightened by the slick interplay of flesh gliding against flesh.",
      "He tightened his grasp and increased his speed, comfortable within her, urging her onward, pushing her upward.",
      "His fingers worked dark magic against the apex of her mound and his tightening sac rhythmically slapped against her aching lips.",
      "\"Come for me.\"",
      "He rasped his husky demand into her ear.",
      "His ardent voice spiked her pleasure ever higher and he felt it echo within her.",
      "\"That's it.",
      "My sweet one... my beautiful one... come.",
      "Come, my cherished one... Let go...",
      "Fall apart with me inside you...\" Persephone crested at Aidoneus' lustful entreaties, rising to unknown heights.",
      "Then everything broke and crashed within her.",
      "Her ring bore down on his thickness, reverberating in waves throughout her body.",
      "Her eyes rolled back and her voice disappeared.",
      "Everything collapsed inward before exploding like a nova.",
      "Her climax ricocheted through her being from her fingers and toes to the tips of her breasts, to the pressure around his cock, to the flood of her essence drenching his fingers.",
      "She heard Aidon's voice rise on the perimeter of her consciousness-- his moans labored and timed with each thrust.",
      "He expanded inside her and his hands fell hard on her hips, steadying her as he thrust to the hilt one last time.",
      "His whole body stiffened and bowed, his head thrown back and his voice, her name, carrying to the rafters.",
      "Waves of his release splashed into her, dragging the last ounces of pleasure from her.",
      "His body shook violently as he emptied into her and Aidoneus pinned Persephone tightly against him so the erratic movement of his hips wouldn't hurt her.",
      "The knelt like that, their hearts fluttering wildly-- his against her back, hers against his hand.",
      "Her head lay back against his shoulder, his chin rested on her neck and all either could hear was their beloved regaining the ability to breathe.",
      "Long moments passed.",
      "Aidon started pulling away with excruciating care, almost as slowly as he'd first entered her.",
      "The flared head gave them resistance and Persephone moaned at the renewed flare of pleasure and small bursts of passing discomfort.",
      "He groaned when his overly sensitive penis finally left her.",
      "Wordlessly, they crashed onto their sides, careless of the pillows, the empty cup, the tray it sat upon.",
      "He smoothed her mussed hair from her back and shoulder and pressed into her, cradling her from behind and stroking the length of her from shoulder to knee.",
      "She whimpered when he jostled her hip.",
      "\"How are you?\"",
      "She smiled, her eyes still closed.",
      "Her voice was hoarse.",
      "\"A little sore.\"",
      "\"Same.\"",
      "He chuckled.",
      "\"Not even approaching what you must feel, though.\"",
      "\"And I'm sticky.\"",
      "She smiled and wriggled around.",
      "The olive oil was cloying against her skin.",
      "\"I have just the thing for that.\"",
      "He rose from the bed slowly, his knees still shaking.",
      "Aidoneus took the water thief with him to fill it in the rushing waterfall outside their antechamber.",
      "The light was dimming along the Styx and evening had settled across the reaches of Chthonia.",
      "When he returned to the room he held the dripping bronze sphere toward the fire for a minute until it heated, then emptied its contents into the marble sink basin.",
      "He came back to the spent pile of limbs that was his wife and gathered her up in his arms.",
      "\"Come here; up you go.\"",
      "\"I have little choice in the matter,\" she giggled weakly, pulling one arm around his neck as he scooped up the back of her knees with the other.",
      "He smiled and nuzzled her, then stood with her in his arms, kissing her full on the lips, his tongue dipping and twining with hers, their mingled tastes tinged with olive oil.",
      "She pulled back breathlessly.",
      "He brushed the tip of his nose against hers again, then gently set her down beside the hearth fire.",
      "The stone cooled her skin, making contact and drawing the excess heat from her sore cheeks and inflamed lips.",
      "Aidoneus grabbed a sponge and ran it first across her back, dipping it in the water and scraping its rough surface along every inch of her skin.",
      "She luxuriated against his enfolding arm, her eyes closing as his ministrations traced each of her limbs with utmost care.",
      "He stood her up to clean her thighs and his face fell when he saw the pink handprints on her rump.",
      "\"I shouldn't have done that,\" he muttered, shaking his head.",
      "\"Done what?\" \"Spanked you.",
      "I should always remember that...\" He cast his eyes to the floor.",
      "She searched his thoughts as he trailed off and saw a familiar vision of them plunging through fire, her cry of pain in the dark when he claimed her as his wife.",
      "\"Aidoneus, my love, you did nothing wrong.\"",
      "\"After I took you from the world above, I promised myself.",
      "I swore I would never hurt you again.\"",
      "\"You didn't.\"",
      "\"What do you call that, then?\"",
      "He traced the radial of bruises his fingertips had left on her hips.",
      "\"Aidon, look at me,\" she said, cupping him at his jaw line.",
      "\"Isn't it time you forgive yourself for the very thing I forgave not a month after you brought me here?",
      "We both know why it needed to be done.\"",
      "He looked at her thoughtfully, but his brow furrowed again, and he averted his eyes from her searching gaze.",
      "She brought his focus back to her.",
      "\"You didn't hurt me.",
      "Not once in all of this, in an act that could have because,\" she said, pointed looking at his groin, \"well, you're by no means small.\"",
      "He guffawed and looked away from her, embarrassed, before staring into her bright blue gray eyes.",
      "She took the sponge from him and wrung it out in the warm water before she administered to him, brushing it over his chest and arms, his long legs.",
      "\"I admit I was curious,\" she continued while she worked, \"but also a little frightened by this.",
      "I wanted it, to know all of you as I'd said, but was so nervous I didn't want to ask you directly.",
      "And you were nervous, too, and you too kept silent, and I knew that you were withholding asking because you care deeply for me.\"",
      "\"I only ever wanted to protect you.",
      "And I think I try to protect you from myself, sometimes.\"",
      "\"Aidon, you don't have to.",
      "We trust each other.",
      "We love each other.",
      "But it saddens me every time you hold back from me, and from yourself.",
      "Tonight was one of those rare times you were able to bring down all your walls, and just let me in and be with me.",
      "And I loved it.\"",
      "He took her hand within his and stood her up in front of him.",
      "\"You did?\"",
      "\"Of course I did.\"",
      "\"Everything?\"",
      "He traced her disappearing bruises.",
      "\"All of it.",
      "Through and through.",
      "You promised yourself you'd never hurt me, but now I want you to promise me something.",
      "Can you?\"",
      "\"I would give you anything.",
      "You know that.\"",
      "\"Then promise me-- as I will promise you now-- that we won't ever let our fear of each other come between us again.",
      "Or stand between the pleasure we share as husband and wife.",
      "Can you do that with me?\"",
      "He held her arms, stroking the curve of her shoulders with his thumbs, then wrapped himself around her, drawing her against his chest.",
      "His head dipped until his nose rested atop her head.",
      "\"I will.",
      "I promise.\"",
      "She closed her eyes and listened to the crackle of the fire and warmed in his arms as he rocked her to and fro.",
      "\"Promise me something in turn,\" he said.",
      "\"That you will care for yourself, not put the world upon your shoulders, and if anything I do causes you any harm of any kind, you will tell me?\"",
      "\"I shall,\" she answered.",
      "He kissed her and breathed in the scent of her hair.",
      "Persephone melted into him, relieved and pleasantly tired.",
      "\"Though...",
      "I think that anything else we might try will have to wait at least until tomorrow.\"",
      "His torso shook with laughter.",
      "\"That's fine by me.",
      "Shall we turn in early to bed?\"",
      "\"I had a better idea,\" she said, grabbing a large, black fleece from the bed in one hand and pulling along Aidoneus with her other.",
      "\"Have you ever slept under the stars in the Elysian Fields?\""

    "text": "\"She can't see us here.\" That was all what it took to let my wall fall down. Thetis couldn't see us here on the mount Pelion? It was like that was the most beautiful thing I had ever heard for days. My mouth twitched involuntarily upward, my heart raced at the thoughts that came over me and a warm tingling sensation spread up in my stomach. She can't see us here, I repeated myself internally over and over again. I rolled onto my stomach and supported myself with my hands in the grass, I leaned over Achilles, who looked at me astonished but trusting. He seemed to know what was going on in my mind. Uncertainly I bit my lower lip, I looked at him closely, paid attention to his facial expressions, just in case if he doesn't want that but I found nothing - Instead, he just looked at me encouragingly and loving. I gathered my courage and leaned down to him, gently placing my lips on his. I felt him returning the kiss as his soft lips moved against mine. I closed my eyes and gave myself in to the tender kiss, Achilles wrapped his arms around my neck and held me close. The kiss was tender at first, almost shy but with every passing second we became more secure in our doing. We deepened the kiss, Achilles opened his mouth slightly, invited me to inquire his mouth with my tongue. I felt his tongue at mine as they danced passionately together, and every touch was like a bolt of lightning shooting through my body. I have dreamed of this kiss so many times, picturing what it would be like kissing Achilles beautiful lips. I've often wondered how he would taste and now I have the answer and it's so much nicer than I could have dreamed. Achilles moved slightly under me, I felt him bend his legs and stroke his hand through my dark wild hair as our kiss became more and more passionate. I put my hand to his cheek, stroking his cheekbone with my thumb while my other hand found its way to Achilles' hip and rested there. It was a breathtaking experience but I quickly realized that I wanted more of it. I wanted to feel every fiber of Achilles body; I wanted to be so much closer to him. \"Patroclus,\" Achilles murmured softly into the kiss and we carefully separated ourselves. I looked down at him, his cheeks flushed and his breathing fast. \"What is Achilles? Did I...?\" \"No, I like what happens here with you but I.. I want more.\" \"Me, too, Achilles.\" \"Then... Let's do it Patroclus.\" My heart seemed to be running its own marathon, I felt it hammering excitedly against my chest and it doesn't want to rest. I looked at Achilles in his green eyes, which faced me with a glassy look. I could drown in them, in this sea of emotions hiding behind the brilliant green color. I smiled and opened the drawstring around Achilles' tunic before I brushed it off his body; Than I did the same by myself. It was not the first time we saw each other naked but this time it was different, the atmosphere was different and I couldn't think of anything else except this beautiful boy in front of me, whom I love with everything I have. I reached out and put my flat hand on his chest, stroking the pale skin gently. I could feel under my fingertips how heated his skin was. I let my hand wander above it, brushing his nipples with my fingers, which became hard under the steady touch and I decided to just keep on doing it. I paid attention to Achilles' facial expressions, to know that he liked what I did here and I was confirmed in my actions. Achilles groaned softly as I ran my thumb over his nipple. I smiled lightly and leaned toward him, kissed his skin on his collarbone down to his left nipple, I kissed it and wrapped my lips over it, I sucking on the nipple and letting my tongue circle around it. Achilles' breathing became heavier under this touch and an irregular hoarse groan came out of his mouth. Encouraged, I continued my doing, but gently pushed him on his back. I let off with my lips from his nipple and kissed me a way along to his lower region, kissed the hip bone and raised my eyes questioningly. \"Do you know what you need to do?\", He asked me in a hoarse voice and I shook my head. \"I just like to try it, you tell me if its okay?\" \"I'll tell you.\" I let my head sink back again and kissed the tip of his penis, which stood proudly and craved for attention. I released my right hand from Achilles' chest and placed it on his thigh, stroking his skin with my thumb as I kissed his penis and licked my tongue down the lower side, eliciting some enchanting tones from Achilles. I finally took the tip in my mouth and worked it with my tongue, tried different things and did mostly that what made Achilles moan louder. His moans were like music in my ears. I loved it but even more I loved the fact that I'm the reason for that. \"Please Patroclus,\" groaned Achilles softly and he buried his fingers in my hair, I smirked a little and let off of his penis. I sat back and spat in the palm of my hand, wrapping it around my stiff penis and rubbing it stimulatingly to make it less painful for Achilles. \"I guess it would be better if you turn around,\" I said uncertainly. I had always imagined the sex with him and only done it a few times myself but really satisfied myself with a boy - better yet - to sleep with Achilles, that is something I had never seen coming. Achilles just nodded and turned around, leaning on hands and knees before me. I knelt behind him and pulled his ass cheeks apart to get better access to his hole. I took my penis and led the tip to his entrance, gently thrusting against the muscle ring. Achilles groaned. \"If I hurt you, please tell me.\" \"I will but now continue please!\" I led my member further into him, past the muscle ring, deeper and deeper. His groans got louder and louder and I could no longer suppress my own moans. Achilles felt so tight around my penis, it was breathtaking. I stayed still for a moment when I felt how much Achilles had tensed and his groaning became a brief sob. I leaned forward a bit and gave him soft butterfly kisses on his skin, I mumbled softly 'sorry' and I thought Achilles was slowly relaxing again. \"Continue.\" I nodded and pushed deeper into him as my penis was finally all the way in him. Tears stole out of the corner of my eye - it was impossible to describe what I felt right now, but it was incredible. It was an amazing feeling to be so close to the boy I loved for so long. My feelings literally flooded me. It was overwhelming. \"Do you cry?\" I heard Achilles ask softly - his voice seemed fragile as well. \"Just because I am lucky.\" \"Patroclus...\" \"I love you.\" \"I love you too.\" After some time we lingered like that, while we loved each other in silence, I felt Achilles' muscle ring relax and demand more, I can tell that from his warm moist muscles. I withdrew a bit from him and pushed into him again, I repeated this process over and over, to a certain point. Achilles groaned loudly and let himself fall on his forearms. \"What was that?\" I asked uncertainly. \"I have no idea but can you do that again?\", Achilles replied. I just nodded and did the same as I did before and Achilles had to moan loudly. I wanted to hear it again like this, so I kept that angle. His moans became increasingly demanding and louder, like a symphony that was composed by me and I loved every single note of this. My thrusts got faster and faster. The only sounds that filled the night were the bouncing naked skin and our lust moan. We found our rhythm and moved in harmony with each other. \"Patroclus!\", Achilles exclaimed loudly and he threw his head back reluctantly moaning. I felt his muscle ring tighten around my penis and his inner walls pulsed around me. One. Two... \"Achilles!\" I came deep inside of him, his inner muscles still seemed to pump out everything of my sperm and exhausted, I dropped my forehead against his sweaty back. My breath was shattering and everything was spinning around in my head. \"That was unbelievable,\" Achilles murmured softly, I silently agreed with him. Slowly I got my breathing under control, I pulled back from Achilles, sperm flowed out of his hole and a hot feeling had spread between my legs as I dropped back and my penis touched my inner thighs. It was really incredible. I closed my eyes for a moment and took a deep breath. That was the best thing I've ever felt besides my love for Achilles. I felt that Achilles laying next to me and wrapping an arm around me, hot breath brushing my sweaty skin and soft lips spreading gentle kisses on my neck and collarbone. He sends a shiver down my spine while doing this and a soft sigh came over my lips. \"I love you Patroclus.\" \"I love you too Achilles.\"",

    "text": "Andromache remembers: her mother, before the wasting disease. Soft hands and even softer eyes, smiling down at her while singing a lullaby. She's the only girl in her family, and that's probably why her mother doted on her, but even so. She's never really known what a proper lady should be. Her father's always telling her she reminds him of her mother-usually when she's ignoring his pleas to stop roughhousing with her brothers, to stay inside and demurely practice her weaving or pluck at her lyre. But she's never liked being trapped indoors, barred by the thick white pillars of her father's house. No-she'd rather be off galloping through the gently curving hills on Phaethon, her favourite of her father's horses, a majestic black steed. She loved the feel of the wind in her hair, the sun beating down on her face as she raced past sparking blue water. \"You know that one day you'll have to stop this,\" said Podes to her once. He had still been small at this time, scrawny and no match for his younger sister, spry and tall for her age. He'd been angry that she'd wrestled him into submission, never mind that her legs would bruise with how hard he had tackled her. \"What? Why?\" she had replied, still flush with victory, her hair matted all around her face and her chiton covered in mud. Her mother's handmaidens would scold her, later, and her mother would sigh, but it was enough, now, to have bested her brother. \"You're a princess,\" he'd said, matter-of-factly, regaining confidence now that he had her wrong-footed. \"Everyone knows that princesses have to be married off to a prince someday. And then you'll have to act like a nice lady and you won't be able to wrestle with us anymore.\" \"That's not true!\" \"Is so. Father told me so.\" \"It's not! I'm going to fight and go to war and bring victory to our land!\" She hadn't been raised on tales of glory, exactly, but her father's drunken guests weren't always particularly observant to peeking ears. \"Ha! A girl, in battle? Girls don't fight, everyone knows that!\" Podes had grinned at her triumphantly at that, like she was a stupid horsefly who didn't know any better, and Andromache had been so angry that she'd burst into tears and stomped on his foot. Hard. Their father had been very angry, later, when he'd found them brawling on the dirt like commoners, but her mother's arms had been warm and inviting. \"I don't want to marry anyone,\" she had cried, her tears and dirt getting all over her mother's lovely robe as she buried her face in her mother's warm embrace. \"I want to fight!\" \"Oh, Andromache,\" said her mother. \"Listen: you are the princess of Thebes. You will fight-it is in your name. But you don't have to fight with a sword, nor with any weapon at all. You can fight with your brain, with your heart. There is more than one way to win a battle.\" Andromache sniffed and privately thought that for once, her mother had no idea what she was talking about. But now: she is staring at their Trojan guests. Her father had laid out a marvelous banquet in anticipation of these men, and further in the hopes that one will make an offer for her hand in marriage, she knows. One is handsome and playful, flirting with the servants and dancing skillfully with the women. But she doesn't care about this one. Her eyes are drawn, instead, to the other one. He's not nearly as handsome, but he's well-built, and moves with a warrior's grace. His hands were callused where they had brushed over hers, almost as if by accident, when she had poured him a cup of wine. But somehow she doesn't think this is the case. She had seen him when he rode up to her home, the setting sun glancing burnished gold over his helm, hands loose and sure on a magnificent steed. And then he had taken it off to look up, it seemed, right into her eyes, where she had been watching over the palace wall. She sees him now, when he looks at her, eyes dark and deep. His smile is slow where it spreads over his face. For the first time, Andromache feels her heart beat in time with something other than the steps of Phaethon's hooves on the earth; her blood sing with something other than the thrill of physical exertion. Maybe her mother had been right about something, after all.",

    "text": "In a modest home near the Ionian Sea, a child of Zeus slept the night away, deep in Morpheus' grasp. On the day of his birth, many years ago, he was stolen from his mother's grasp by a goddess who hid him from his father's sight. And to create a spell of such a power, she stole the boy's eye to do so. Making him blind to the monsters that hunt him and his fellow demigod siblings in the night. And which goddess did this, you may ask? Hecate, the goddess of witchcraft and magic. You see, this goddess had seen enough of demigod heroes dying for their godly parents who didn't even care about them. Not even having her own child, she couldn't help but wonder how the gods and goddesses could do such a thing to their own flesh and blood. So, she stole the child of Zeus away from his mother's arms as Zeus' wife, Hera, went on a warpath that night. Unable to find the child, though, the goddess of marriage's rage grew. Hera was an unwilling wife who was tricked into marrying an unfaithful husband who only wanted her for her beauty before pushing her aside for the newest catch. Once, one could say that she was a kind soul who cared for all, but now? She was only a bitter woman with a frozen heart. And on this night as a child of Zeus slept, Hera began to hunt him down once more. Unaware, Hecate left him alone to visit Olympus. That was her first mistake. As Athena watched from above, she turned her away from the injustice, but she wasn't going to do anything. No one ever did. The child of Zeus awoke to his hound barking. A loud whine before a strangled yelp got him out of the bed. And that was the last thing he did. On this night as Hecate arrived at the modest house to check on the child of Zeus, Hera's rage was pacified and Hecate's heart shattered further. The only child she had tried to save was brutally murdered by an angry goddess for nothing. He didn't insult her. He didn't offend her. He did nothing. He was only a child of Zeus. And was killed for it. And on this night as she dropped to her knees, her tears staining her pale cheeks, Athena flew from Olympus to whisper wisdom in the goddess of magic's ear. \"The kind are killed in our world, Hecate, don't try and be a hero. You're only a goddess.\" And when the sun kissed the horizon the next morning, the modest house was gone. The clearing where the house once stood was bare and empty. No hound. No child. No bloody scene. No house And if further into the woods, a prye burned softly all day, no one said nothing.",

I had been the daughter of a prophetic god, long ago, after all, and my father's gift had passed down to me, in spite of my halfhearted filial devotion. His men preceded him, and I welcomed them all on my shore, but I won't waste my breath over the likes of them and what I made of them. They were arrogant, and greedy, and lascivious, and fragile, like mortals often are, and they were better off as pigs anyway. He, though, he was the sole specimen of his kind. He presented himself as some sailor from Argos, and I knew it to be a lie right away. A wit as sharp as his couldn't be merely some sailor's. But he was starving, so I fed him. He regarded everything I gave him with wary eyes, yet clever enough not to let his suspicion show. But I was a mistress of treachery, every inch as skillful as him, so I noticed how he inspected the boar on his plate, as if his mortal eyes could detect witchery. Where were his companions, anyway? He did not ask until later that night, after the coupling. I hadn't had a man in over a century, for my own prickly pride would deem everyone beneath me. Why was this one different? When he asked about his comrades, I was sitting upright on the bed's edge, bathing in the moonlight that seeped from the silk curtains. I felt silver, and young again. In hindsight, I truly was young back then, and thus I took offence that he could have a thought for them, even when I was right under his eyes, looking so beautiful and divine. I learned later that he seldom forgot himself and his duties. My beauty, the prowess of my love-making or even my pleas could nothing against the sharpness of his intent. I told him once that, in that, he was not unlike us witches. We must sharpen our intent like a river stone before a spell, if we hope to succeed. He laughed at the parallel, but I could see from the shadow across his brow that he did not find it flattering. In the end I had to turn back the swines into those pitiful excuses for men that he called his crew, in order to please him and keep him by me. A year he stayed on Aiaia, under my roof, in my bed, in my arms. The warmth that radiated from his limbs was the greatest pleasure I drew from him, second only to the stories he would share, and his wisecracks. Seldom I had met, in all my years as the sun's daughter, a warmer source of light. His wounds were endearing, and the way he used to try and hide them filled me with a biting urge to tend to them. Gods, we heal fast, but a mortal is as fragile as a bluebird and every broken bone requires several months to be set aright. And his men were even more mangled, thankfully, so they had dire need of my potions to heal. They spent a year by me, and had all the time to heal and frolic about my gardens and woods, so much that they grew sick of the idleness. These were men of action, and although they were just now coming from a battlefield, they already craved another. I began to fear their poisonous tongues, for I knew that when I was out of earshot, they pressed their case to Odysseus incessantly, and although he first rejected them, I knew he was now beginning to crack under their pressure. It was at dawn, when he came to me, that I knew our peaceful idyll was at an end. I had risen early from our bed because I couldn't bear feeling him so close to me, asleep, and knowing that he will be gone by tomorrow. So I was now sitting on a rock by the cliff's edge, with my lioness at my side. She was my faithful familiar, and I summoned her when I needed to feel like the proud females of her kind myself. \"Circe,\" he muttered, under his breath. Had I not been waiting for him, I would not have even heard him. Able, clever Odysseus, who has faced a thousand trials and overcome them with his wit, was now cowering before me like some unmanned rabbit. \"I have come to a decision.\" \"Have you? It was about time.\" The wind was strong and fierce, it was cutting at my cheekbones. Perfect for sailing. The gods, my life-long adversaries, were clearly blessing his enterprise, and would speed up his journey home with favourable winds. \"Say it, then.\" I wept, and raged, and wept again. The lioness at my side, that had always shown him regard, was now menacingly baring her teeth to him. I was accustomed to loss by then, and yet it never ceased to give me pleasure, having mortal outlets for my mortal emotions. It made me feel like I was weak too, and alive, and with my days numbered. \"Do not weep for me, my sweet... You knew it was my fate to sail back to Ithaca, to Penelope.\" Her name was like an ice splinter in my eye. I stopped weeping at once, the tears dried on their own. I turned away from the cliff and my lioness followed me. The unruly wind was still ruffling my vest. Even in his stories of war and home, that I liked above all else, her name always spoiled my mood when it came up, and I could no longer focus on the rest of Odysseus' telling, so over time he stopped mentioning her, and the unspoken name \"Penelope\" became yet one more wound on his heart, one that not even my potent witchcraft could heal. \"I am no jailer. All the time you have spent by me, you have spent willingly. But now your conscience is eating at you, and the ghosts of those you've left behind are digging their claws in your heart when you sleep. What can I say? Be on your way, Odysseus, son of Laertes. May the gods favour your return to those you cherish.\" The wind carried my words to him, and made them sound more detached, cold, hard, of which I felt grateful. It would make the parting easier. \"I cherished you too, for however long the gods would allow me.\" I would have gladly pushed him off the cliff he was standing on. He always had a way with words. They were like polished blades in his hands, which he could use to his convenience. And I hated when he used his wiles to trick me, too, as if I were one of those dim-witted Trojans on the battlements of their fallen city, the ones he convinced to accept the deadly token he had laid out for them on the nearby beach. Gods were the petty excuse of vile men who could not keep their promises. I would have defied even the greatest of them for him, but all this, I kept for myself. Why would I let him know the actual weight of my heart? He would not be delayed anymore. He had a wife, a son and a land to go back to. I would only debase myself for nothing. I watched from my window, refusing to go bid them farewell from the beach. It all ended as it began, only in reverse; the white sails shifting further and further from my sight on the water, instead of approaching. Due to the similarity of what I had already witnessed a thousand times in my life, I could not be pained over the loss of him for long. My life had been a constant streak of the same events over and over again, only with a few diverse coincidences gracefully adjusted to make them look just a tad bit different from the last time, but still fairly equivalent in their method. I suppose immortals run a groove in the world in order to keep their immortality, and they hardly ever experience anything new, or exceptional enough to affect them permanently.",

    "text": "Boy of stardust and steel (of broken bones and scorched skin) Rise with your waxless wings. And fear not the fall, For your wings are made of iron. Boy of starlight and starfire, Of asteroids and comets and constellations (And how beautiful they are As they burn and burn and die). Golden boy of sun kissed wings, (Tell me what it's like to conquer) Fearless boy who touched the gods (Tell me what it's like to burn). Sunlight scalds your skin And a thousand stars your lungs, But still you rise above, (and for one shining moment, you kissed the clouds, tasted sun drops on your lips and stood where only gods dare to tread) And hold the sky in your outstretched arms (and the world beneath your winged shoulders). And let not tragedy repeat itself, On the base of molten wax (Oh, but Icarus, wasn't it worth it? For the chance to taste the sky, To die with the sun in your eyes?). So Icarus, who dared to love the sun, (Icarus, of the fearless flight) taste the sunlight in your mouth, fire-sweet where it's caught in your throat. (And Icarus hit the ocean with a crack, The current wrapped around him, swallowed him, Deep beneath the waves where the Sun couldn't reach. The ocean's stories belong to no one but herself, her secrets an uncharted abyss. But Icarus is the fallen one. The fated one. Marked by the sun. And currents whisper secrets among themselves hidden in the brine, to those who know what to listen for, and they say: 'In the dark, he glows.') Reach towards your love, Apollo, And grasp the sun god in your hands. Let the world know --the boy who fell flew. The day Icarus fell, Apollo cried. When his bones were crushed by the waves, Apollo wept, Tears of silver and gold. Oh, Apollo, you were celestial, You belonged among the stars, With golden eyes and starlight teeth. A god burning bright, high in the sky. But Icarus was a boy with starlight eyes, a smile that held a thousand stars, And the sun was in love. Oh, Apollo, You drown yourself in the horizon And paint the sky in bruises of purple, red and gold, To learn the painful process of destroying and resurrecting yourself for your love. Oh, Apollo, All of this so that one day you can defy Olympus' rule of never resurrecting a mortal for Icarus, the only mortal who ever dared to love you enough to burn. (If he ever learns to resurrect mortals the way he resurrects himself, Apollo's favourite sight would always be Icarus rising, the way he does every morning, whole again from the sea.) Oh, Apollo, Do you think the stars wept when Icarus fell? I think they reached out; I think they tried to catch him - and that's why they shine a little brighter than they did before. The sea took too much from Apollo waves had grasped at his lover in a malice hunger, and drank up every teardrop he sent down (you can't reach the sun at the bottom of the sea). The day Icarus fell, Apollo cried, And the sun no longer shone the same way. - Do not forget the sun is a star too",

      "Oh, Apollo, All of this so that one day you can defy Olympus' rule of never resurrecting a mortal for Icarus, the only mortal who ever dared to love you enough to burn.",
      "(If he ever learns to resurrect mortals the way he resurrects himself, Apollo's favourite sight would always be Icarus rising, the way he does every morning, whole again from the sea.)",
      "Oh, Apollo, Do you think the stars wept when Icarus fell?",
      "I think they reached out; I think they tried to catch him - and that's why they shine a little brighter than they did before.",
      "The sea took too much from Apollo waves had grasped at his lover in a malice hunger, and drank up every teardrop he sent down (you can't reach the sun at the bottom of the sea).",
      "The day Icarus fell, Apollo cried, And the sun no longer shone the same way.",
      "- Do not forget the sun is a star too"

    "text": "I'm halfway down the first flight of stairs before I even realize it is time again, yet I suppose a part of me had always known it is not the sunlight that owns me. Roaming fields the hue of mother's hair, accompanied by laughter and the scent of wheat, my steps can never follow any pattern but the unconscious spiral away from home, inevitably leading down. Down, away from the sun and heat and life - because the ice could never be defied. The place of descent is easy to find, the path always the same, no matter where I start. This is my husband's first greeting, the ritual that leads me back to him. I welcome it into my very being and I feel the priest's chant within my rapidly cooling bones. Absentmindedly, I wonder whether he knows how very soon he will follow me on the steep path down. I wonder whether he minds, his prayer so very full of longing - but no matter. A mortal can not distract me from my purpose although I briefly smile while I allow his drumming to become the rhythm of my feet. Were I to look back now, I'd see a world on the brink of turning to ice as well. Oh, the air is still warm, with some days left to bring the harvest in, but already the promise of ice is on the wind. And a promise it is! Sometimes I wonder why it fell to me to negate mother this way... But of course I don't look back, I never do. In the distance, is that the sound of a lyre I hear? The hallway I pass is also covered in ice. I smile when I brush against one of the sparkling crystals and it feels warm to the touch although my feet are cold. This is true ice that has been touched by the world below, that has frozen so cold it has forgotten how to thaw. This is the ice that made me strong. Laughing, I lick the crystal's very tip. I recognize my husband's second greeting and after all these years, it still moves me as nothing else could. Ice, after all, can not be defied. Yet deeper I follow the path that by now has become a part of me, the core of what I have become now that I am not just the daughter anymore, not just a girl. In my haste, I almost stumble, with the holy beat fading into the distance - my hands are busy braiding mother's last gift into my windswept hair. I will wear that garland of poppies as a crown, and another around my waist, when soon I will again discard all that ties me to above. Above, where truth is only a dim memory, where I never fully remember my kingdom, my power, my husband's kiss, and the ice, oh, the ice! A last memory of sunlight while I anticipate the moment I cannot hear the chants anymore, while I wait for my heart to stop beating again. To receive my husband's third greeting, I leave behind my dress, carefully embroidered by mother's hand, red pomegranates a shocking pattern on the pale river bank. A last unseen nod from queen to queen, and then I'm going down, I'm going home to meet my love.",

    "text": "\"Don't be afraid. Death isn't literal. It often means transformation, or leaving something behind. Think of it as a rebirth.\" \"I know,\" said Cora. \"I've heard that before. But what does this mean?\" Though the Death card was beautiful, she felt somehow drawn to the one next to it, depicting a naked man in a chariot pulled by a bull. \"Ah,\" said the fortune-teller. \"That's the Prince of Disks. Princes are air, but Disks are Earth. These are opposites. He is pulled between the two. But he is thoughtful; practical. A good man.\" Before beginning the reading, the fortune-teller had asked Cora a few questions about herself, then looked through a the deck and pulled out a single card, laying it face up on the tablecloth. It had been Princess of Disks. \"What do you think it means,\" asked Cora, \"that this card--\" \"Your Significator,\" said the fortune-teller, with a slight incline of the head. \"Yes,\" said Cora. \"Well, it's the Princess. And the Prince came out in the reading. What do you think it means?\" The fortune-teller hummed noncommittally. \"Perhaps we might pull another card, for clarity.\" \"All right,\" said Cora. The fortune-teller shuffled the deck and pulled out another card, laying it on top of the Prince. \"The Lovers,\" read Cora. \"So I'm going to meet a man--this good man--and he's going to be my lover?\" \"Perhaps,\" said the fortune-teller. \"But the Lovers card, like Death, is not always literal. Often, it represents a choice.\" \"What sort of choice?\" \"I believe that the Prince will enter your life, one way or another. It may not be a man; it may not even be a person. It may be an opportunity, represented by the energy of the card. I believe you have a choice to make. One path will lead to transformation; the other...\" \"What?\" \"Well. If we don't transform, we stagnate. This is what people often don't see about the Death card. I often think that it ought to be called the Chrysalis; then perhaps people would understand.\" \"So... you don't think it's a man?\" The fortune-teller sighed. \"There is every possibility that you will meet a very good, handsome man and become his lover. Best of luck.\" * Cora walked briskly back to the house. Her mother wouldn't look kindly on her going to see a fortune-teller, even if it was only a bit of fun. She felt as if the fortune-teller had taken it all a bit too seriously. Wasn't it all supposed to be \"you will meet a tall, dark stranger and go on a journey\" sort of thing? Still, she'd liked the cards. They were a different design than the one she'd seen pictures of, and seemed to have slightly different names. When she opened the door, the overwhelming smell of lilies nearly knocked her down. Her mother must have gone shopping while Cora was out. She only bought lilies when she was in a particularly extravagant mood, so it would either be a good day or a very bad day. \"Hello?\" she called. \"Hello, darling,\" came her mother's voice from the kitchen. \"We have company!\" It wasn't unusual for her mother to have visitors, but usually she would mention them by name--\"Helen's here,\" or \"Lucas is here\". Cora made her way to the kitchen, where her mother stood, glass of white wine in hand (oh dear), and, on the other side of the kitchen island, a man--he had his back to her, but she could see the way he stood ramrod straight, hands clasped behind his back, curly hair neatly styled and shot through with streaks of grey. \"Hello,\" she said. The man turned--he had a nice face, though slightly too full in the cheeks to be really handsome, and with downturned green eyes which made him look sad. \"Hello,\" he said, putting out his hand. Cora took it. \"Cora, do you remember Aidan?\" asked her mother. \"I don't think we've met,\" said Cora. \"I think we might have, years ago,\" said Aidan. He had an accent, she realized--what was that, British? \"Aidan used to work with your father,\" said Cora's mother. \"You were probably very little when you saw him last.\" Cora felt the blood rushing to her face, and was glad that her olive skin was unlikely to show it. She wanted to be introduced to people as an equal, not thought of as a child. It was difficult, when everybody seemed to know her mother. 'Oh, you're Chloe's daughter!'--she longed to be thought of on her own terms. She longed for the day when her mother would introduce herself to somebody, and that somebody would say 'oh, you're Cora's mother!'. Perhaps, one day, when she was a concert pianist and her mother was just a faded socialite, and she had friends who made art instead of just collecting it, and there was a profile of her in The New Yorker... She realized with some embarrassment that she probably ought to have said something by now. \"Well then, it's very nice to see you again,\" she said. \"Likewise,\" he said, then coughed as if his tie were choking him (it was done up awfully tight). \"Why don't you two make yourselves comfortable in the living room,\" said Chloe. \"Aidan, would you like anything to drink?\" \"Oh, no, I'm fine, thanks.\" \"Really, it's no trouble.\" \"D'you have tea?\" Chloe looked around theatrically. \"I may have some herbal--\" \"Coffee?\" Chloe laughed her tinkling laugh. \"Now that, I can manage. Milk and sugar?\" \"Just the one sugar, please.\" \"Of course. Well, go through to the--\" \"Cora, did you not want anything to drink?\" Aidan interrupted. \"Oh yes, of course,\" said Chloe. \"Darling?\" \"I'll have a coffee, too,\" said Cora. \"You don't drink coffee,\" said Chloe. Cora just looked at her. \"Well, all right then. How would you like it?\" \"I'll have one sugar, too.\" \"If you say so,\" said Chloe, and then looked at Aidan and laughed again. \"Well, do go through to the living room. Cora, why don't you play something for Aidan?\" \"You really don't have to--\" \"It's fine,\" said Cora, leading the way. \"I like to play.\" \"Okay,\" said Aidan, perching on the edge of the least comfortable chair in the room (the bergere). \"Well, do you know Vltava?\" \"Of course.\" She was aware that she was showing off, and also aware that she had been encouraged to show off by her mother, and equal parts resentful and determined to impress. Vltava happened to be one of her favorite pieces, and perhaps she ought to have told him that--put him at ease, made small talk. She was too busy, though, abiding by the letter of her mother's law but not its spirit: entertaining the guest without charming him. \"Very nice,\" he said, when she had finished. \"Any other requests?\" \"Let's just--why don't you relax? I don't want to put you out. Anyway, you've got coffee coming in a minute, you can't play and drink.\" It was difficult to argue with that. She moved over to the couch. \"So,\" she said, \"what accent is that, British?\" \"Ahm, no, not really,\" said Aidan. \"It's Irish.\" \"Isn't Ireland in Britain? Or is it the UK? I always get that mixed up.\" \"It's... Northern Ireland is in the UK, but none of Ireland is in Britain. But they're both in the British Isles.\" \"Oh.\" \"Yeah, it's a nightmare,\" he said. Cora smiled despite herself. \"Vltava's one of my favorite pieces,\" she said.",

    "text": "After he had drowned the dirt with bitter tears, after he had torn his clothes and wrenched out his hair, after his throat had grown hoarse and his mouth tasted like stale blood, after agony had consumed him and annihilated all joy, Achilles thirsted for war. He turned away from the cold body of his beloved Patroclus. He could no longer bear the tragic softness of his form. He swore that he would avenge his companion's death by cutting down and tearing apart all those who had opposed him in this life. He would war until murderous Hector was dead and the golden city of Troy was ash and dust. Achilles dressed himself in his glorious god-forged armour, and leapt into his chariot, urging his sleek horses towards the main Achaean camp. As he made to speed away from his tent, Thetis called out to him. While Achilles had clung to Patroclus' corpse, weeping and kissing his lips and cheeks, Thetis had burned with anguish. She had petitioned the gods for his heavenly armour, for she wanted to see Hector murdered and maimed for having stolen her son's lover. Now, watching her son leave, she remembered the prophecies and her heart ached. She truly did not wish for her son a short life, his great glory extinguished at the gates of Troy. Thetis implored him, \"My child, I told you that there was no hope in mourning and urged you to avenge Patroclus' death, but I spoke wrong to spur you down a road where death waits at the end. Your life is short, and the deaths of a thousand Trojans will not bring your Patroclus back!\" She begged through tears, \"I loved Patroclus as I love you, because he protected you and brought you great joy, but now that he is gone I wish for you a long and peaceful life. Return home, to Phthia. Fill yourself with happiness. Take for yourself a new lover. Only choose a woman or a beautiful youth, not a warrior; not a man who would remind you of what you lost!\" Achilles was unmoved by his mother's words. His soul ached for Patroclus. He yearned for the comfort known only by true lovers, and pain swelled within his heart. He threw down his helm and cried out, \"You say that you loved Patroclus, but now you want me to forget about him! I loved Patroclus, but I was not born to love. I cannot simply fill my heart again to replace him. Only war will avenge my loss. My heart will be joyous after I have broken Hector's beautiful body, and stripped him limb by limb of the armour he stole from me. I will not return home until I have hauled Hector's corpse behind my chariot and razed Troy to the ground.\" Thetis reached for his face, taking his burning cheeks in her hands. His bright eyes contorted between tears of anguish and fury, and his mouth snarled and trembled at times. Still, he sought comfort in her touch. Then, he suddenly turned his beautiful face from her and spurred his chariot away. She sensed that something deep inside of him had been decided. Long ago, she had tried to escape a trap by turning into a flame, a lion, a serpent; any form that she could think of, but she had learned that there was no form that could escape destiny. Looking down from Olympus, Hera saw Achilles, in all his golden fury, hurrying towards Agamemnon's tent. She flew to Zeus in a rage. \"Your man is about to kill my man!\" she cried, for Zeus loved Achilles and Hera loved Agamemnon, the king of Mycenae, and lord of all the Achaeans. Zeus stayed her hand, \"The affairs of men are difficult for women to understand. A woman either loves or hates. But for a man, love and hate are one and the same. Man loves what he detests. He wars the most with his countrymen, and he makes love to his sworn enemies. So do not fear. No harm will come to Agamemnon from this union.\" Then Zeus drew a mass of dark clouds over the sky so that Hera could no longer look down upon Agamemnon's camp. Agamemnon's men grimaced as Achilles approached with rage in his eyes, but Agamemnon dismissed his guards with a gesture of his hand. He recognized the pain in Achilles' eyes, and said, \"Achilles, what disturbs you now? Did we not make peace? Are you not pleased with your gifts?\" Achilles replied, \"I care not for gifts, I think only of war; war is a far sweeter joy. I crave blood and destruction!\" \"Swift-footed Achilles,\" said Agamemnon, \"the time is not ripe for battle. We wait for daybreak. Return to your camp and sleep.\" Achilles clasped Agamemnon's hand and said, \"I swear to you, by Zeus and all the gods, that I will not sleep, nor will I return to my tall ships until I have struck down Hector and his brothers.\" Agamemnon smiled. \"Then you will not return to your ships. Dine with me tonight.\" \"No mortal food will pass my lips until Hector is dead and I have stabbed his corpse a thousand times!\" \"Drink with me, I will tell you stories of my family that will amuse you, and further rouse your passion for bloodshed. You know that my family was cursed by the gods. Brother fought brother, and they ate the flesh of their own sons.\" Achilles abated and put down his golden helm, and his beautiful shield that was as bright and as round as the moon. He drank Agamemnon's wine until his lips and teeth were stained red and bloodlike, and he grew flushed and heated. \"Now that you have returned to us, you will want for nothing,\" Agamemnon told him. \"You will have the greatest share of the spoils of war, and I will give you my daughter's hand in marriage. You and I both will be kings.\" \"I care not for kingdoms or spoils of war. I seek only to avenge Patroclus.\" \"You loved him,\" said Agamemnon. Achilles cast his eyes down and said nothing. \"Briseis does not please you then?\" \"I care nothing for her. I cared for my honour! What right did you have to steal my war prize?\" Achilles spat. \"I had no right to her, but I did not steal her. All the time that I kept her in my tent, I did not once touch her. I hoped that she would grow to love me of her own will. She wept when I told her that she must return to you,\" said Agamemnon. \"Liar! She loves me.\" \"You killed her husband and her brothers, and then you lay with her. How could you expect love to blossom in her heart?\" \"These are the ways of war,\" Achilles spoke. Agamemnon towered over Achilles. He was older, manlier, and fiercer. He was a beautiful and majestic king. His long hair was thick and sleek, and his beard was streaked with grey. \"Is that what you tell yourself?\" he said. \"You promised to marry her, but what of the other women you enslaved and carried away from their homes? Did you promise to marry them too? Long ago, your father stole your mother from the sea. She tried to escape him by turning herself into a hundred different beasts, but he held her fast and forced himself onto her. When you were born, she must have hoped that you would not grow to be cruel like your father. She loves you. She still sees in you the little baby who babbled on her lap and brought her joy in those dark times. I see you as who you really are.\" Achilles lashed out, clasping Agamemnon by the throat, saying, \"Arrogant man! You have no right to speak of me in this way!\" Agamemnon shrugged off Achilles' hands and laughed. \"Do not think that I insult you! I admire your cruelty. The gods of war do not reward the meek. I am proof of that.\" He allowed his robes to fall from his body. His limbs were shining and strong. His skin was scarred and bruised from the years of war that he had faced, always thrusting himself into the heart of the battle. Light white scars lined his chest and belly. His thigh bore a deep and crooked scar from a spear that had never faded. His wounded arm was still stinging with pain, and bound with fabric. Achilles was fascinated and outraged by the king. He gripped Agamemnon's neck, clawing and twisting at him, as if to choke him. Agamemnon did not struggle, instead using his strength to pull Achilles closer to him, wrestling Achilles underneath him. He sucked bruises down the skin of Achilles' beautiful young neck. Achilles struggled in his grasp, like a swan in a cage helplessly flapping its wings. Finally, Achilles cried, \"When you called for the raids on the Trojans and were outnumbered, you said that you acted on false dream sent by Zeus. When you stole Briseis from me, you blamed Zeus for your greed. Tell me, is it Zeus who inflames your loins now?\" He struck out at Agamemnon. They fell against each other and grappled and wrestled in the dirt. Agamemnon grasped Achilles, pulled up his pteruges and forced apart his legs. Achilles cried out, for it seemed so long since a man had taken him like this. He desired him, although he knew that Agamemnon would still have taken him like this even if he did not. He felt Agamemnon press his erection between his thighs. He thought that if he closed his eyes, he could feel Patroclus. Agamemnon had the same beard and taut muscles, and he made the same deep moans that Patroclus would have done as he spent himself between Achilles' thighs. They lay together while tears flowed down Achilles' cheeks. He felt Agamemnon's wet discharge across his thighs. His muscles were tense and ached most beautifully. Agamemnon embraced him, and wiped his tears away with his large warm fingers. Achilles choked, remembering when Patroclus had held him as close as this. \"You can pity me all you want, but you know nothing of grief,\" he snarled. Agamemnon spoke, \"There is a river in Boetia. The water is so warm there in the summer. After my first conquests, I built a temple there.\" Achilles grew annoyed. What did he care for an old man's memories? \"When I was a young man, I waited beside the river praying. It seemed to me to be the edge of the world. Before I sailed for Troy I returned there for the last time, but I never dared to even touch the waters there. I fell in love with a man named Argynnus when I saw him bathing in that river. Years later, in this same river, he drowned. Cephisus stole him away that day. No mortal could have Argynnus. He was made captive by the gods; for no crime other than his beauty. I will never forget my hatred for the waters that smothered him. \"When he was stolen from me, I grieved, but it was not long until that grief hardened into avarice. War became my mistress, and grew to love all that I could attain from her. I even grew to forget the boy that I had loved. I see him in you. You are almost as beautiful as he was. Why hasn't a god stolen you away? \"I would that I was the son of a god and I had the power to plead Poseidon to strike Cephisus with an earthquake to make him return my Argynnus to me. But no favours will be bestowed unto me. I am a fool of the gods. I no longer trust the dreams that the gods deign to favour me with. Still, every night, Death claws at my chest with knives, leaving me choking with blood.\" Achilles softened when he heard Agamemnon's honeyed words and said, \"We are great men. We exist only to appease the whims of the gods. This is our doom and our blessing. We are the captives of the gods, and to resist our fate is futile. I have even tried to raise my hand and reach for my sword to kill you, but the gods forbid me.\" Achilles remembered his mother's words: Take for yourself a new lover. Only choose a woman or a beautiful youth, not a warrior; not a man who would remind you of what you lost, and said, \"The gods would not have us war, but they would not have us love each other, either. Tonight, the clouds conceal us from the wills of the gods, and the darkness will obscure our true identities. Now take me as you once took Argynnus.\" So Agamemnon stripped Achilles of his bronze breastplate, the heavy armour crashing to the floor, exposing his taut frame. He shivered before Agamemnon, his shiny chest and limbs glistened, and his red hair shone in the light of the fire like leaves in autumn. Agamemnon licked and sucked on his nipples, licking the sensitive area around it in little circles, and sucking on the delicate tip. Next, he helped him to undo his greaves with the silver ankle clasps, and his lips bent at the edge of his ankles, and his beard brushed at his feet. Agamemnon kissed his feet, and all along his beautiful and muscular calves and thighs, until he reached the golden-red hair of his sex. Then Agamemnon spread oil over Achilles' muscles, working the cold liquid into his skin, until it was warm and soft. Finally, Agamemnon pressed his slick fingers inside Achilles, working him open. He would not pleasure himself chastely between Achilles' thighs as he had before. He pushed himself deep into Achilles, his powerful manhood conquering the young hero. With each stroke inside of him, Achilles could feel a tension build within his loins. He raised his legs and gripped Agamemnon's arms, pushing back into his thrusts. As he approached the height of his pleasure, Achilles cried out for Patroclus. Agamemnon snarled and grasped him by the neck with one hand, and said, \"I am Agamemnon, lord of men! Do not play me for a fool with your childish fantasies.\" Achilles grew elevated. \"Patroclus!\" he cried out as soon as Agamemnon released his throat. The pressure was reapplied, and his breath failed him. They struggled with each other. Achilles would wreck his throat to shout \"Patroclus!\" clenching himself around Agamemnon as he did so, until Agamemnon pinned him down so hard that he could not breathe. Finally, Agamemnon pulled out of Achilles in disgust, shouting, \"I refuse to be a vessel for your desire for Patroclus!\" Achilles, empty and on the brink of his release, seized his own manhood in desperation, and pleaded, \"Brilliant Agamemnon, forgive me! I forgot myself.\" But Agamemnon turned away from him. Achilles cried out, \"Agamemnon, lord of men, please, I am weak and need you to ruin me. Take me, Agamemnon, my lord, my king.\" So Agamemnon drove himself deep into Achilles, and became relentless in his lovemaking. Achilles, his manhood untouched, shuddered and moaned with every thrust. Finally, he leaked wet cum onto his beautiful chest, and a dark and mournful cry rang out throughout all of Agamemnon's camp. A great wind came up that night, and blew apart the clouds, and found them sleeping there, Achilles and Agamemnon, all shining limbs, with glittering bronze swords and golden-crested horsehair helms at their side.",

      "So Agamemnon stripped Achilles of his bronze breastplate, the heavy armour crashing to the floor, exposing his taut frame.",
      "He shivered before Agamemnon, his shiny chest and limbs glistened, and his red hair shone in the light of the fire like leaves in autumn.",
      "Agamemnon licked and sucked on his nipples, licking the sensitive area around it in little circles, and sucking on the delicate tip.",

    "text": "\"This heat is horrible. How can you stand living up here during summer?\" The woman with silver-coloured hair, yet without the aged face of a old woman, tried to push herself deeper into the shade under the trees while still covering herself from the sun with a parasol. Her feet was down in the cool water of the stream as well. \"Yeah, well, suit yourself if you dresses in black, silly wife,\" a slightly younger man responded from where he was rolling around in the grass like a happy horse. His skin was tanned from the sun, making his green eyes and copper-colored hair down to his shoulders stand out. In contrast to the woman, he wore a white tunic which reached down to his knees. The sandals had already been thrown off earlier so he could be barefoot. \" Black is the only decent colour. \" New laughter from her younger husband. \"Only because you are the Queen of the Underworld, huh? Can not have you be mistaken for my mother or aunt Hera. Or aunt Hestia either, though that is almost impossible since you are the only one with silver hair.\" \"I was silver-haired from the very start, not as a result of stress-related work later in life,\" The wife snorted as she took off the belt from her waist, then pulling out the small pins holding her clothing together and took off her Ionic chiton, so she now was only wearing a loincloth for modestly. \"No strophion?\" She ignored his teasing. \"The Underworld are not supposed to be a joyful place, especially for those who have been wicked in life and faces eternal punishment for what they did in the past. The mortals fears me because they tries to avoid death in the hope of living forever and yet they always end up there in the long run.\" Suddenly, a wall of plants, weaved together like a wicker basket, shaded her from the merciless sun because she was almost pale enough to be one of the dead. \"I can do a full little shelter...if my lady wishes to sleep?\" His eyes had changed a little bit. A inner darkness, which was always present there in him since he had eaten the pomegranate seeds to bind himself to the Underworld as her consort. Not a evil darkness, just showing that he was not innocent in the way people could mistake. \"Well...if you are that horny already after only two and a half month back on earth with your mother.... Persephone. \" Hades did not protest when he kissed her. Her husband was still young, in human years he could be likened to a young man in his twenties, mature in his own manner but not afraid of showing some of his more childish side as well. \"I am forever grateful for that you remained unwed for so long that I could wed you, Hades.\" She smiled under a pretended shyness, her own black eyes shining like the realm of the dead she ruled as Queen. \"I never found someone who I really could imagine as my husband, until that you came. And was brave enough to face the dangers of the Underworld despite that your powers of fertility was linked to the seasons already before it became a power of rebirth as well.\" This time, they kissed each other, Persephone snapping his fingers to form that shelter he had promised earlier, so neither the sun or the curious eyes saw them.",

    "text": "Grantaire sat on a bench, painting, smiling as Enjolras approached him. \"What is this? Another masterpiece?\" \"It's a surprise,\" he said, turning the canvas away. \"Wait just a moment and I'll show you.\" After a moment, he turned the canvas back around. It was a beautiful painting of Enjolras and Grantaire, watching the sun set. Their hands were intertwined. Enjolras studied it carefully. \"There's a mistake here,\" he said. \"There's a strip of gray on my finger here.\" \"That's no mistake,\" Grantaire said. Enjolras looked up from the painting to see him on one knee, a small silver ring in his hand. \"It's not much,\" he said apologetically. \"But I wanted to...\" Enjolras pulled Grantaire into an embrace. \"Yes! A thousand times yes.\" \"Your father will not--\" \"I don't care about my father,\" Enjolras said. \"I care about you.\" And as the sun set over the two of them, it seemed like this moment would be captured in time forever. The night of the wedding, they sat together in their new home, surrounded by friends. That night had been one of joy, but also one of sadness. Enjolras's father had shown up at their wedding and threatened him after they had said their vows. However, they had had a good night after that, and during the afterparty, there had been far too much wine and far too much fun. \"Grantaire,\" Enjolras said, putting a hand on his arm. He shrugged it off. \"What, your worries tonight? It's fine! Have fun!\" \"No, Grantaire, I--\" The word was cut off by the sound of a shot being fired. Enjolras fell at Grantaire's feet as if he had been struck by lightning. Panic ensued. Grantaire stood in the middle of it all, with his friends screaming around him, stock still. All he could do was look down at the body of Enjolras at his feet. The funeral was held in the same hall as the wedding a day before. Grantaire left early. He could not bear to see Enjolras like that, all the fire gone from him. It wasn't right, it wasn't natural. He needed that fire, and with it gone, Grantaire's purpose was gone too. He sat on the cliff where he had proposed, and cried there. He was so overcome with emotion that he could not help but sing. A song Enjolras had taught him. Enjolras, who could barely carry a tune, who had still tried so hard to sing to stir the people to his cause. His voice broke, and he could not sing any more. A voice sang out over him. \"Please, cry no longer. Your song is causing the heart of my husband to break.\" Standing above him was a woman with dark curly hair. She was wearing a gown made of flowers, and her feet were bare. \"Come with me,\" she said. Grantaire had no choice but to follow. Grantaire was brought by the woman wearing flowers down through the earth into the realm of Hades. When he went through the earth, he passed over the river Styx, and was brought to the palace of Hades. He sat upon a throne of books, holding a pen as his staff. Hell was a place of fire, yes, but also a place of many, many words. Words that no one needed. \"Who are you, singer? Why do you mourn?\" \"My husband is gone. He has been killed by his father. It was an unjust death. I want him to come back.\" \"Who is he?\" Hades asked, paging through a thick tome. \"I must find his name.\" \"Enjolras. He was shot.\" The man shut the book. \"I have found him. Are you sure you were really in love?\" \"I loved him-- I still love him with all my heart.\" Hades nodded. All of a sudden, Enjolras was brought through the door. Grantaire started crying all over again. He was barely a shade of his former self, no body, no fire, just a pale ghostly form draped in a white cloth garment. \"You may take him back to the human world,\" Hades said, \"under one condition. While you bring him from here to the top of the world, you cannot look back at him.\" Grantaire nodded and took Enjolras's hand with a smile. \"Come with me. I'll bring you home.\" As they walked up the long stairs upwards towards the world, Grantaire grew doubtful. He did not know if Enjolras was behind him. \"Enjolras?\" No reply. \"Enjolras, are you there?\" Again, he did not reply. It was odd. Enjolras was normally all about words, constantly speaking, constantly trying to tell the world that he was there. Grantaire's doubts grew. What if he was being lied to? \"Enjolras, I need to know if you're there.\" As they approached the world above, he stepped across the threshold of Hades, and ran outside, momentarily forgetting Enjolras. All of a sudden, he heard a voice behind him. \"Grantaire?\" He turned around at last, seeing Enjolras standing behind him, wearing the clothes he was buried in. Tears were streaming down his face. Grantaire ran towards him, burying his face in Enjolras's chest. \"I thought you were gone forever,\" he cried. Enjolras looked at him sadly, pulled up the hem of his shirt, and showed him a bullet-shaped scar on his stomach. \"Oh,\" Grantaire whispered. \"It still hurts. I can still feel it.\" Grantaire showed him the ring, still on his finger even after his death. \"I will always be here to make sure it doesn't hurt.\"",

    "text": "Medusa hated shopping. Not the act itself, she didn't mind the looking, the selecting, the purchasing. She certainly didn't mind parting with her drachmae (she had more than she knew what to do with). No, she hated the process. First she had to bundle up. Wrapping her head was a given, as no mortals she had met seemed accommodating to the whole 'snakes for hair' situation, though it took one disastrous encounter to make her realize she needed to wrap enough layers to muffle the hissing. Then came the long sleeves, gloves, and ankle skirt to hide her skin which was a pleasant, though unnatural, shade of light green. The veil wasn't the worst, though it had been a process of trial and error to discover which particular type and thickness of fabric would allow her to see while also ensuring that she didn't run into walls or suddenly acquire a new collection of statues. That's why we can't go back to Makedonia, she remembered. Then, when all of that was done, she had to sojourn nearly ten dolichos to a secure village where she could make her purchases and leave without too much suspicion. She sighed as she passed through the back entrance to the temple where she made her home. She began to disrobe, carefully unwrapping the head scarves so as not to hurt the snakes (little Perakus moped for weeks last time she caught him up in the bundle) and removing the long, stifling garments. It was nearly summer, and the heat had been all but unbearable. She changed back into her favorite outfit: a short, white tunic with no sleeves, cinched around the waist with a thin, snake shaped, leather belt. When her sisters were back she wouldn't need to bother. Euryale could hunt for food, and Sthenos could make the shopping trips which she mysteriously enjoyed. (Euryale thought she might have a boyfriend in the village). She hung her satchel on the outstretched arm of the statue of some warrior or other (Herodotus? She couldn't remember. He was noisy, and crass, and much more useful as a coat rack.) and set about placing her acquisitions in the pantry. Some days she wished she was normal. An ordinary girl in an ordinary village. She would have friends, go to school, shop for fun. Her life would be simpler. A memory rose in her mind. Rain. A muddy street. Cold marble. Hands. Terrible hands. Laughter. Pain. Misery. Shame. There was the sound of glass breaking as the jar of honey shattered in her grip. \"Amathes.\" She swore and set to cleaning her hand and collecting the shards. It was worth it, she knew, to be like this. To never feel like that again. She had just deposited the shards out the window when Medusa heard a crash from out in the temple. \"Ugh,\" she groaned, \"Now? I just got home. Fine, malaka, I'm coming.\" The main chamber of the old temple was a large room lined with columns. Opposite the large, square entrance, was a tall statue of Athena Promachos, bearing spear and shield. The paint had long since faded and chipped away, leaving the statue a stark white. The room was also filled with statues. Dozens of flawless stone statues each bearing the appearance of a warrior. Many bore expressions of fear, but others were in mid strike or attack. One, near the back, was frozen in the act of opening his tunic, his lips pursed in a pastiche of seduction. He was Medusa's least favorite. Medusa emerged from a little hidden door behind the statue of Athena and crouched behind it. \"Alright,\" she whispered, \"You know the drill, fan out, fangs bared. Leander, don't hiss over my lines. Korinna, get those fangs out. If we scare him enough, he'll run off so we don't have to petrify him, for once. All ready? Okay, show time.\" She darted out from behind the statue. \"Foolish mortal,\" she hissed, making her voice low and raspy, \"Who dares enter the domain of-\" She stopped. Where is he? There wasn't a living soul in sight. That was odd, she thought. They usually spent much longer staring at the statues in horror. One, an old statue of a bearded man in heavy armor, had been knocked over, it's head in pieces. \"Hello?\" she called, \"Foolish mortal?\" There was a crash from the side room where the offerings to Athena had been kept. \"Kopros.\" She dashed into the room. It was about half the size of the main chamber, filled with large, clay vases which each held some quantity of drachmae or valuables that she and her sisters acquired from the hapless men that attempted to slay them. \"Quit wandering around,\" she chided, \"How am I supposed to-\" Medusa's voice caught in her throat. Standing over a broken vase spilling drachmae across the ground was a young woman. She was lithe, dressed in a long, lilac tunic. Auburn hair tumbled over her shoulders in large, lazy curls, and her face was soft, and cherubic. She had her arms in front of her, searching the air. Medusa saw her eyes. They were gray and clouded. \"Sorry,\" the girl chirped, \"I think I broke an urn. And something heavy in the other room. I hope they weren't important. I can pay you back, I promise, I'm just, uh, not sure where I am?\" Medusa had no words. She couldn't think. A girl? How did she get here? What did she want? \"Hello?\" the young woman called out, \"Are you there? I thought I heard someone. I'm a little lost.\" Medusa shook her head, forcing the wheels of her mind to move. \"I, uh... Don't move, I'll help you.\" She started walking over to the young woman. \"Thank you so much. I'm afraid I'm far from home.\" She reached toward the sound of Medusa's footsteps, narrowly missing a cluster of vipers who stared on in confusion. \"Careful! Here, let me...\" She grasped the woman's hand and pulled her toward the main hall. \"Oh! Thank you. My name is Xenia.\" \"Medusa.\" \"I'm so glad you're here. I was beginning to worry this building was abandoned and I was all alone.\" \"I just returned, and you're lucky I did,\" Medusa explained, \"I've been out of the house for days.\" \"House?\" Xenia asked, \"From the outer walls, I assumed this was a temple.\" \"Um...in a way, it was, I suppose, but now it's where I live.\" Medusa walked her through the forest of statues to a marble bench, where she sat her down, taking her own seat on the far end. \"Now,\" Medusa began, \"How did you find yourself here?\" \"I am without sight,\" she explained, \"And I found myself turned around. I think my brother, Demetrios, may be playing a trick on me.\" \"A trick?\" Medusa bristled. \"Yes, he has...quite the sense of humor,\" Xenia smiled, weakly, \"But he's all I have. He does take care of me.\" \"Still,\" Medusa huffed, \"It's hardly an appropriate thing to do to your sister.\" Xenia smiled broader. \"You're very kind.\" Medusa felt a flutter in her stomach. It had been a long time since she spent this much time in the company of an ordinary person without the benefit of darkness or disguise. Even if Xenia was blind, this was the closest thing she'd had to eye contact in ages. Yes, she told herself, that was it. That's what this feeling was. \"It's nothing,\" Medusa muttered, \"He's lucky you weren't hurt. Fallen into a ditch, or beset by brigands.\" Xenia scooted a little closer to her. \"I do appreciate the help. I don't think I know you from the village, Medusa, are you new?\" \"No, I've lived here for ages,\" Medusa said, without thinking, \"I mean, uh, I don't go to the village often. I live out here. With my sisters. Though they're traveling, at the moment.\" \"I see,\" said Xenia, \"That sounds lonely.\" \"It can be, though I'm used to it. It's better for me, like this.\" They sat in silence a moment. \"Well,\" Medusa said, \"I should set you to home.\" \"Oh, sure. Thank you. If you can lead me to the edge of town, I'll be able to manage from there.\" The edge of town. A shiver ran down Medusa's spine. \"Um, actually I can't, uh, go with you, I...uh....One minute!\" She ran out of the room, leaving the confused Xenia behind. She ran to the rear entry and began to hurriedly don her disguise from the statue it was hung on. Her snakes hissed in protest as she frantically wrapped the head scarf. \"Shut up! Just keep quiet under there and I promise I'll catch you extra mice tonight.\" They calmed and coiled up under the cloth. This would get her down the road, but she couldn't take Xenia all the way to the border. the village was only a twenty minute walk from the temple, but the sisters avoided it at all costs. If anyone there ever found out about the gorgon's home, it would be easy for them to make trouble. She looked around, panicked, for a solution. She saw it: a long, thin piece of cypress wood that they used to knock olives off of high branches. She led Xenia out to the road at the edge of the temple's grounds. \"It's not a far walk,\" she said, \"But stay close.\" \"You sound different,\" Xenia said, \"Are you wearing something over your face?\" Medusa cursed under her breath. This girl's hearing was incredible. \"I, uh, have a bad reaction to the sun. We should move.\" They headed down the little dirt path until it joined back with the larger main road. Xenia kept good pace and made pleasant conversation as they walked, though often she would drift until Medusa finally grabbed her hand and lead her directly. Her face felt hot under the veil. After a bit longer, the sight of the small village came into view. \"This is where I leave you.\" She finally huffed. \"Oh,\" Xenia said, \"Are we at the village? I can usually hear the market from here.\" \"I...I can't take you that far. If you continue down the road, you'll reach the eastern edge.\" \"I don't know if I can-\" \"Here.\" Medusa shoved the stick into Xenia's hand. \"Tap this on the ground in front of you. If it sounds hard,\" she tapped it on the road, \"Then you're on the right track. You'll be fine. It's after noon, so keep the sun on your face and you'll make it.\" \"Okay, I think I can manage that. Medusa, you've been so kind to me, I really do appreciate everything.\" \"It was nothing,\" Medusa huffed, \"Really.\" Xenia began down the road towards town, tapping her cane against the ground as she went. She stopped and turned. \"Perhaps I'll see you again?\" \"Perhaps.\" Medusa sighed. Xenia smiled and proceeded down the way. Medusa watched her until she was near enough to town that she was sure Xenia would make it before she turned back to make her way home. \"Perhaps.\" Summer had come, and the bright sun beat down on the Greek Isles, washing everything in intense heat. Cicada buzzed in the grove of olive and citrus trees behind the temple as Medusa set a plate of figs to dry in the hot sun. She wiped her brow and shushed her hair. The heat always seemed to excite them, and they became more and more restless as the summer grew. She sat in the shade of a fig tree, fanning herself and deciding whether it would be worth the effort to take a dip in the little pond out back. It was unlikely anyone would visit. \"Heroes\" were less common in the summer when the heat made traveling in armor less desirable. She was just starting to rouse herself when she heard a voice. \"Medusa?\" Her sisters likely wouldn't be back until next spring, so it probably wasn't them, she thought. Besides, Stheno would've tried to jump out and scare her first. No mortals who came to the temple would know her name, except... \"Oh, by Athena.\" She sighed. Wandering by the front entrance was Xenia. Her skin had tanned, and her hair was tied in a high ponytail. She wore a peach colored dress that came to her mid-thigh, and high sandals. \"Xenia?\" \"Oh, there you are!\" Xenia headed toward the sound of the other woman's voice, tapping the thin cane Medusa gave her along the way. She had become quite adept with it and managed to avoid small rocks and ledges in her path. \"It's, uh, good to see you, again,\" Medusa stammered, \"How did you get here?\" \"Well, mostly thanks to this wonderful little cane! It's been so helpful in getting around, I hardly ever get lost or fall down anymore. I was afraid my brother might break it for one of his jokes, but even he benefits from having to take less care of me.\" \"Oh. I'm...glad.\" \"Anyway, I remembered the way from last time and thought it might be nice to pay you a visit. Have your sisters not returned?\" \"No. Not yet. Would you, uh, like to come in? Are you thirsty?\" \"Yes,\" Xenia beamed, \"I'd like that.\" Medusa led her carefully through the main hall into the living area behind the altar. The Gorgons had converted it into a large, shared living space with several sofas and a stone table with four chairs. Door led to each of the sister's private quarters, and another into the kitchen. Medusa sat Xenia down at the table and retrieved a pitcher of water from the miniature cellar beneath the kitchen, which was cool even in the height of summer. She filled two cups and brought them out. Xenia drained hers in one and sheepishly asked for more, and Medusa refilled her cup. The blind girl sipped now, demurely. \"So,\" Medusa began, \"How have you been?\" \"Very well! I adore the summer, and get to spend most days walking by the beach, collecting sea shells, though sometimes I take the forest road so I can smell the trees and the wildflowers. Do you ever get to the beach?\" \"We're cliff side, so I'll watch the ocean in the evening. Most of the day I tend to the orchard and paint.\" \"That sounds lovely! Do you get out of here often?\" \"No,\" Medusa shook her head, \"But I have everything I need here. Even a little spring in back to swim in.\" \"Oh, I love swimming, but I don't get to much. I need someone to keep an eye on me so I don't get turned around.\" \"And no one will?\" \"I don't have many friends. And it's just Demetrius and I at home since mother and father passed.\" \"And has he been cruel to you, again?\" \"No,\" she waved her hand, \"He's never cruel, just...playful. He likes to make fun, but he's the only one who cares for me. He appreciates my new independence, though, he seems more cheerful.\" \"Hmm.\" \"Please don't judge him too harshly, Medusa. I can be such a burden on him.\" Medusa bit back a comment. \"What's that noise? Is something boiling?\" Medusa looked around for a moment until she realized what Xenia was talking about: her snakes were rousing and hissing, having picked up on her budding anger. She tried to gently pat them down. \"I'll tell you what, Xenia,\" she deflected, \"Let's go swimming.\" \"Really?\" \"Sure, I could use a cooling down.\" The pair ventured to the orchard behind the temple where lemon trees formed a ring around a crystal blue pond. It was only twenty feet across, and four feet deep at the center, but that was more than enough to enjoy on a hot day like today. Only when they arrived and Xenia began to disrobe did Medusa conceive the reality of her plan. She looked away, her cheeks on fire. Not only was Medusa seeing Xenia disrobe, but no one, outside of her sisters, had seen Medusa undressed in a very long time. And they still wouldn't, she realized, Xenia is blind. Medusa felt stupid. To be fair, she sort of was. She took off her dress and hung it on a nearby tree. She brought out a small head wrap and tucked her serpentine locks into it. No sense risking Xenia getting a handful of snakes. She took the other girl's hand and led her into the spring. They shivered as they waded into the cool water, but quickly adjusted. \"You should be okay,\" Medusa said, letting her hand go, \"It's not to deep or wide.\" \"Oh,\" was she blushing? \"S-sure, thank you.\" They settled, enjoying the water and the sounds of the summer around them. Medusa felt the snakes calm as her temperature dropped. \"This is wonderful,\" Xenia sighed, \"The water is perfect, and it smells so lovely out here. Lemons, olives, and are those hyacinths?\" \"They are,\" Medusa chuckled, \"You have a keen sense of smell.\" \"It's one of the ways I can enjoy the world. For example, you smell like...earthenware and...figs?\" Medusa blushed, \"Yeah, I was drying some when you arrived.\" \"Mmhmm, and there's something else, too, like a personal scent. Everyone has one, I've noticed. It makes it easy to recognize them when they're near. Though yours is quite unique.\" \"That's amazing.\" \"You're the amazing one, Medusa, living here alone, taking care of yourself. I wish I could do that.\" \"I mean, my sisters helped with a lot of it. They planted the orchard and taught me about drying and preserving food.\" \"Do they leave often?\" \"Every few years. They like to travel the isles. Euryale, my oldest sister, loves to sail. And Stheno gets so restless she'd drive the whole world mad cooped up in here.\" \"Why don't you go with them?\" Medusa paused. \"I...I like it here. I've never wanted to leave.\" She could feel Xenia examining her words. \"I understand,\" the other girl said, \"Home can be...hard to turn away from.\" The lounged, in silence, for some time. \"Why don't we get out,\" Medusa finally said, \"Have some of those figs.\" Xenia smiled, \"I'd like that.\" Xenia visited often after that. Every few days Medusa would hear the tapping of her cane up the little path and go out to greet her. She began to enjoy the visits, and planned around them. She cleared some of the statues out of the main chamber, putting the rest against the walls so her friend could walk through without issue. Xenia became more and more familiar with the grounds, and was able to find Medusa even if she was in the orchard picking fruit, or in the cellar tending to the preserves. Medusa had always enjoyed the time her sister's were away. Stheno and Euryale were lovely, but they could be a lot to deal with, and she had come to appreciate the peace and quiet that came with solitude. But being with Xenia was...different. Medusa never found herself tired of the other girls company and, on the occasions where more time than usual passed between her visits, she would find herself dawdling by the entrance of the temple, watching the clouds and listening closely for the tap tap tap of her friend coming up the hill. The only problem was that she was having trouble keeping their conversations away from the details of her life. Xenia was intensely curious as to how Medusa had come to be where she was, and every little fact threatened to give away her secret. To say nothing of the time Xenia wanted to trade hair-care tips. What would happen if she found out what Medusa was? Would she still accept her? Would she still want to be her friend? Would she... This troubled Medusa late that summer as she and Xenia walked through the orchard together. Xenia had put her cane up, and the pair walked with their arms linked. Medusa had her head wrapped, though her serpents were growing restless in the heat and little Perakus had peaked out to examine his surroundings with a curious tongue. \"I only worry that someone will accost you on the road,\" Medusa complained, \"Are you never concerned about robbers or bandits?\" Xenia laughed, \"You are sweet to worry,\" she said, \"But I've never heard of anything like that in the lands. I'm much more concerned of pits and rocks, though less so, thanks to you.\" \"I keep telling you,\" Medusa smiled, \"It's no great invention. I'm surprised no one thought of it before. But, if you aren't concerned...\" \"The only thing of danger around here is the hideous dread the travelers are always speaking of.\" \"Hideous dread?\" \"You've never heard? There's a local legend about a monster who lives on one of the hills. They say it was cursed by the gods to be so dreadful to look upon that anyone who does dies of fright.\" Medusa felt a pit in her stomach. She brushed Perakus back under the wrap, ignoring his protests. \"Do many speak of this legend?\" She asked. \"A few,\" Xenia admitted, \"It's a sort of local superstition. Some of the sailors who stop at the village know of it, too. Every elder has a second-cousin, or some such thing, who went onto the hills to slay it, and never returned.\" \"Do you fear it?\" She laughed, \"I suppose I'd have no reason too. Unless it just decides to gobble me up. It must be quite horrible to have been cursed in such a way.\" \"Maybe it wasn't a curse,\" Medusa muttered. \"What do you mean?\" \"Maybe it just wanted to be left alone.\" Xenia considered that for a few moments. \"Then,\" she said, \"I suppose something horrible must have happened to it, to ask the gods for such a thing.\" Medusa didn't respond. \"Enough of this melancholy topic,\" Xenia said, \"Let's go back and enjoy those candied lemons I smell.\" Xenia's next few visits were different. She was as sweet and jubilant as always, but there was something else. An undercurrent of tension under her words. A hesitance that Medusa had never noticed before. She continued to come to the temple, but less frequently, if only slightly. It was a few weeks later. Summer had nearly given way to autumn, and Medusa was reading at the table from one of her many scrolls of poetry. The sun had nearly set, so she had lit candles and lanterns by which to read. There was a knock at the back door. Medusa stared at it for a moment, unsure, as this wasn't something that had ever happened. Her serpents rose high, tongues flickering, mirroring her trepidation. \"Who...is it?\" She called. \"It's Xenia.\" \"Oh.\" She got up, bid her hair to calm down, and walked over to the door. Xenia stood outside, dressed in a long, white gown. She held her cane in both hands, her face twisted in a look of concern. \"Xenia,\" Medusa said, \"What are you doing here so late? The path will be too dark...no it won't, Medusa, don't be stupid. Please, come in.\" Xenia entered and found her way to the table. She sat down. \"Medusa,\" she said, her voice was shaky, \"Sit next to me. Please.\" Medusa did, scooting her chair just far enough away so that her uncovered serpents would be out of reach. Xenia chuckled, nervously, \"You always do that, you know? When I surprise you you stay out of reach.\" \"Xenia, is everything alright? You seem nervous.\" \"The first time we met, Medusa, you wouldn't take me to the village. Why was that?\" \"What-\" \"And you wore coverings over your face. You said that was to keep the sun off, but we've been in the sun many times since then, and you've had no trouble. Why was that?\" \"I-\" \"You never go to the village. You've been to market, to be sure, I remember you complaining about it, but never the one closest to you. Why?\" Medusa had nothing. \"Medusa, I cannot see. There is much in this world I miss, but also much I notice that others do not. When I spoke of the hideous dread the other day, I heard your voice. I heard you were nervous. Your breathing quickened. I could feel your heart pounding through your skin.\" \"What are you asking me, Xenia?\" \"I care for you, Medusa, but there's something I need to know. The other day a man came through the port. He was harried. He had been to Delphi, and the oracle told him never tarry on this island, because of the creatures that lived on it. A trio of sisters, cursed by the gods to turn any who look upon them to stone. You have two sisters, correct? And your front hall was full of statues, I felt them when I first came here. He called them the gorgons.\" Medusa was silent. \"Is it you?\" Medusa paused. Xenia was so sweet, and kind. She was friendly, and bright, and optimistic. But she was not stupid. \"Yes. I am Medusa, youngest of the gorgon sisters. The goddess Athena gave this, as you say, curse to us many years ago.\" \"Can I see?\" \"What?\" \"With my hands, can I see your face? I've never asked, you were always so nervous when I got to close. Can I look upon you?\" \"I-\" she was surprised by the request, \"I-I suppose.\" Xenia scooted close to her. She reached out, and Medusa guided her hands to her face. She felt her, running the tips of her fingers over her nose and brow. She stroked her cheekbones and touched her lips. \"I see.\" Xenia finally said. \"What?\" She sighed. \"Those legends never get anything right. You're gorgeous.\" Medusa blushed and her eyes welled with tears. \"W-w-what? Y-you're lying.\" \"Why would I be? Cute nose, high cheekbones. By Zeus, I wish my own lips were so full.\" Medusa was lost for words, \"You...your...I don't, I mean, my hair...\" \"Yes, what of your hair? You always keep it hidden. Is it unusual?\" \"It's...snakes.\" \"I'm sorry, I thought, for a second, you said snakes.\" \"Here,\" she grasped Xenia's hands again, \"Feel. They know you, so they won't bite.\" She guided her hands, slowly, into her serpent locks, which were fanning out to give better access. \"Oh!\" Xenia exclaimed, \"You weren't kidding. Well, that's interesting. I've never felt a snake before, but...they're quite smooth, like leather, I didn't expect-Oh, that tickles!\" \"Sorry, that's a tongue,\" Medusa explained, \"Korrina has to taste everything, I swear.\" \"They have names?\" \"Of course, Korrina, the little one you're touching now is Perakus. There's Menalaeus, Archibiades, Kassandra...\" She guided Xenia through her cranial menagerie. The serpents enjoyed the attention, and whatever apprehension Xenia might have had vanished as she caressed the friendly vipers. They were so involved, neither of them noticed Xenia scoot closer and closer to Medusa. Not until their faces were inches apart. They could feel each other's breath. Now, Medusa could smell her, too. Xenia smelled earthy and sweet, like wildflowers in fresh soil. \"They like you,\" Medusa breathed. \"Are they the only ones?\" Medusa had no words for her. She pressed her lips into Xenia's. They reveled in that beautiful, wonderful kiss for all of eternity. When they finally parted, flushed and panting, night had fallen, and crickets chirped outside the window. Xenia reached up and stroked Medusa's cheek. \"I think this one likes me a lot.\" Autumn came as Medusa and Xenia's romance bloomed, a single bright flower among cool winds and golden leaves. The blind girl made the journey to the old temple nearly every day. She would help with Medusa's various responsibilities and chores, and, once finished, they would spend the day together walking about the temple or simply lounging in each other's arms. Xenia would describe for Medusa the precise smells and sensations the winds carried, and Medusa would regale her with tales of her of the long time she'd spent living and traveling throughout the Greek world. On this day, they were laying in the orchard. Xenia's head rested on Medusa's chest, while they ate dried figs and talked. \"And then,\" Medusa continued, \"The myrmidons, all with their eyes covered, their General turned to stone, were just standing there, and Euryale said 'May we leave? Or will all of your wives be receiving new decorations for their gardens?'\" Xenia laughed, \"That's incredible. What happened next?\" \"They prepared our ship and let us leave.\" \"Your sister sounds great.\" \"She is. Euryale can be bossy, but she always knows what to do and say. And Stheno is great too, lively and very funny, though she can be a little much, at times.\" \"Do you think they'll like me?\" \"Oh, I have no doubt.\" \"Your heart is beating faster.\" \"I mean, I'm sure they'll love you.\" She corrected. \"They may be...apprehensive about a mortal being around our sanctuary, but I'll convince them. You'll see. It's not like they can turn you to stone.\" \"So how does it work? The turning to stone?\" \"Anyone who looks at us is turned to stone. Simple as that.\" \"And how to the snakes come in?\" \"They don't? I mean, they're venomous, but even if they're hidden the petrification still works. It's in our eyes, I think.\" \"So how did it happen? Oh, you've tensed up. I'm sorry, is it hard to talk about? You don't have to.\" \"I...\" Medusa had done everything to put that night behind her. \"It was...terrible. I wished...I prayed for a way that no one, no man, would ever look upon me again. Athena answered me. She told me there would be a price, but I didn't care.\" Tears flowed down her face. \"I wanted this.\" \"And your sisters?\" \"After...after that, my sisters wanted to be with me. We were all each other had. Athena gave them the same choice, and they accepted.\" \"So you've been together all of this time? Just the three of you?\" \"Mmhmm.\" \"They must really love you.\" \"They're my sisters. They're all I have.\" \"I-\" \"Xenia?\" A deep voice called from near the temple. Medusa shot up. \"Who is that?\" she hissed. \"My brother. Hide, I'll get rid of him.\" Medusa darted behind a tree. Xenia stood and walked toward Demetrius, who wandered over from the temple. \"There you are, kepfos, what are you doing out here?\" He was tall, with broad shoulders. His hair was long, and he had a dark, chin-strap beard. His teeth were bared in a wide grin that made him look like he was up to something. \"I-I've been coming up here, you know, to get away.\" \"By yourself? I'm a little impressed. What is this place? Some old temple?\" \"Yes, I think so. Did you need me for something, Demetrius?\" \"I wanted to see where you've been running off to every day.\" \"Oh, well, now you have, I guess.\" \"What are you hiding? I'd guess a boyfriend, but who would ever be interested in you?\" A nest of serpents hissed, nearby. \"What's that?\" Demetrius asked. \"Probably a bird. We should get back before it gets late.\" \"Don't be stupid, I want to look around.\" Ignoring her protests, he headed back towards the temple, entering through the large, open portal in the front. \"It's to Athena,\" he said, \"Too bad. Poseidon or Zeus would be more interesting. But what are these?\" By the time Xenia caught up to him, he was examining one of the statues along the walls. \"They're so realistic. And such expressions, what are they for?\" \"Demetrius, we really should leave.\" Xenia grabbed his tunic by the shoulder and pulled. He wrenched out of her grasp and shoved her. Xenia fell to the ground, her cane clattering away. \"Don't tell me what to do, kochone. I'm the elder brother. You listen to me. Hey, all these statues. That sailor a few months ago, didn't he say...By Poseidon, this is it! The hideous dread's lair! I have to tell the village, we can gather the men and-\" \"No!\" Xenia was standing, her fists balled in defiance. \"What do you mean, no?\" \"You can't tell people, she isn't a bad person, se-\" \"'She?' What are you talking about? Do you know...Are you friends with this thing?\" Xenia's face flushed. She didn't know what to say. \"You've always been stupid, sister, but never this stupid. This thing isn't your friend, it's a monster that does this to people.\" \"Only the ones who've tried to kill her!\" \"You mean heroes? Xenia, I'm getting the men, and we're coming back here to kill that monster. You need to go home and stay there until I tell you otherwise.\" He turned and left in a huff. After he was gone, Medusa entered the temple. \"Medusa? Is that you?\" \"Yes.\" All of the color was gone from her face, and her voice trembled, \"I need to leave, Xenia. Right now. You can come with me if you want, but I have to go.\" \"But what about your sisters?\" \"They'll...they'll find me. Somehow.\" \"Medusa, we can stay. We can talk to them, it will be okay.\" \"No, Xenia, you don't understand. I can't be here when he comes back with the village. I can't.\" \"Please, Medusa,\" Xenia cried, \"Help me understand.\" Medusa paused. \"I was the most beautiful girl in my village. I'm not being vain, Xenia, I was. The gods themselves declared it. Men would sing songs of me. People passing through would make every effort to meet me. Every man I met wanted to share my life or my bed, but I turned them all down. I wasn't interested. You can probably guess why.\" Xenia flushed. \"Then a new man arrived. He was tall, and impressive, and smelled of salt-water and he asked to share my bed, and I told him no. He did not take well to that.\" \"Medusa...\" She took a deep breath. \"He followed me to Athena's temple when I went to pray that evening and he...he took what I would not give. He stole it from me, Xenia. I thought it was over, I hoped so badly, but...he brought them all. The men from the village. All the men I had turned down. All the men who thought I owed them something.\" She fell to her knees, sobbing. Xenia reached for her, wrapping her arms around Medusa's shoulders. \"After,\" she choked, \"They dragged me out, into the rain, threw me in the mud. They laughed, Xenia. I can still hear it. The laughing. I was so ashamed, so crushed. I prayed to Athena to take my hurt from me, to ensure such a thing would never happen again, and so...\" \"She made you a gorgon.\" Medusa nodded. \"The man...he was Poseidon, disguised in human form. She could not strike him and, in a way, we had defiled her temple, together. She told me her gift would come with a cost. Once my sisters knew what happened, they stormed the town, demanding to know what would be done. They found the men in their homes, at their jobs, living their lives. No one cared. No one, even those who weren't a part of it, would raise their voice for justice. So they screamed their plea to the heavens, and Athena gave them the same gift she'd given to me.\" \"What did they do?\" Medusa sniffed. \"There's no village there, anymore. Only ruins. And statues.\" Xenia squeezed her tight. \"I'll go down the hill, try to buy you time. Get packed and leave. I won't make you go through that again.\" Medusa nodded. \"Good luck, my love.\" They kissed. \"My heart is with you.\" Medusa packed dried fruits and preserves into a bag, and loaded clothes into another. She knew her sisters would return, eventually, so she considered how best to direct them to her. And what of Xenia? She needed to leave it where all of her loved ones could find her. But where would she go? North, along the coast? Into the woods? With winter approaching, neither were ideal, but she was short on options. She decided she would follow the sea, and leave the missive where Xenia and her sisters would know where to look, in the preserving cellar beneath the kitchen. But Xenia can't read parchment. She cursed to herself. She'd have to carve it. She made relatively quick, though slapdash, work of the message, but she was confident it would be effective. The sun was already setting, though, as she stole out the back of the temple. She heard a commotion along the road. Just in time. She chanced a look at the mob, peeking around the far corner. It was, indeed, a large collection of men from the village, as well as a few women, bearing torches, farming tools, and a few chipped spears. Medusa shivered. She had to get out. Demetrius was leading the mob, holding a fishing trident, and he was dragging someone. Oh no. It was Xenia. She looked ruffled, and there were bruises along her arms and a long cut down her cheek. Her serpents bristled beneath her head wrap. She felt her heart pound boiling blood through her veins. The thought of the crowd, the men all looking at her made her knees shake and her stomach roil. She could leave. Run away before anyone saw her. She could. She knew what she had to do. The mob approached the temple, stopping just short of the entrance. Demetrius yanked on Xenia's arm and threw her onto the ground before him. \"Are you there, monster? I brought your kochone laikas. Come and greet her!\" Nothing happened. There was a grumble through the crowd. \"Not interested?\" He raised his trident, \"Then you won't mind if I skewer her into the dirt?\" \"Foolish mortals!\" Everyone froze as the torches in the temple came to life, and, framed by statues of terrified adventurers, was Medusa. She had changed into her long white gown, and wore belt and bracers designed to look like intertwined serpents. The vipers in her hair fanned out, fangs bared and hissing, menacingly. Her eyes were closed. \"You dare traipse upon the sanctuary of the Gorgons?! Flee, now, or face my wrath, and end up as these other hapless 'heroes' have before you!\" The crowd blanched at her threat and terrifying visage, but Demetrius resisted. \"So that's what you look like,\" he sneered, \"No wonder you had to get this blind fool to care for you.\" Medusa snarled, and her serpents rose, aggressively. \"Leave,\" she ordered, \"Now, and leave the girl. Or you will decorate my hall for the rest of time.\" \"Will we?\" He asked, \"Can you stop us all before we take you down? Before we swarm you? I mean you are hideous, for sure, but I don't seem to be dead, yet.\" He was arrogant, Medusa thought, but he might be right. She didn't know if she could petrify them all before they were on her. Regardless of how her gambit played out, this was a huge risk. \"Get out,\" she growled, \"I don't want to hurt you.\" \"Brother.\" Xenia pushed herself to her feet. \"Please, don't do this. She isn't a monster. Just go, please.\" People yelled from the crowd. \"Traitor!\" \"Freak!\" A rock flew from the crowd and struck Xenia across the temple. She cried out and sprawled on the floor. \"Xenia!\" Medusa rushed to her, chancing to open her eyes just enough to see her beloved, unconscious and bleeding in her arms. Medusa forgot fear. She forgot pain. She forgot mercy. She forgot love and glory. The goddess only sung one word in her mind: Rage. Medusa roared, her serpents hissed and spit venom. The crowd flinched and fell silent. Even Demetrius took a step back. \"Die!\" she screamed. Before she could open her eyes and unleash her deadly glare, a soft hand covered her face. \"Medusa,\" Xenia whispered, \"Don't. You aren't what they call you. You don't have to be like them.\" Medusa felt her lover's touch. She could feel her heartbeat. Smelled her scent, earth, and sweat, and hyacinths. The fire in her heart died down. The serpents on her head relaxed and lowered to frame her face. Perakus nuzzled her cheek, licking away a tear. She stroked his head and smiled. \"You remember the best part of me,\" she sniffed, \"You remember I'm not a monster.\" The crowd had gone silent at the tender display. They simply stood and watched for a moment. A man spoke out, \"What are we doing?\" Another said, \"There's no danger here. Let's go home.\" \"What?\" Demetrius cried, \"What's wrong with you? The monster is right there! Have you lost you manhoods? Have you lost your minds?\" An older man with a white beard put a hand on his shoulder. \"Elder?\" \"It's over, Demetrius,\" he said, \"I will not be part of senseless slaughter.\" He looked to the girls, \"Medusa, we will not bother you again, so long as you and your sisters do not trouble us. Your secret will be safe.\" \"Thank you,\" said Medusa, \"You will not see me again.\" He nodded, turned, and left with the others. Demetrius yelled after them, \"You can't! Think of the glory! The songs!\" When they disappeared down the hill, Demetrius turned back to the temple and found Medusa upon him. She wrapped a hand around his throat and, with hardly an effort, lifted him so his toes dangled above the path. His eyes bulged in shock and pain. Medusa kept her eyes closed, but her vipers neared the terrified man's face, fangs bared and dripping venom. \"Let me make something clear to you, koprias.\" She growled, \"Should you ever cause Xenia, myself, or any woman trouble ever again, I will not turn you to stone before I break you into pieces, chop you to to chunks, and feed you to my snakes. There will be nowhere you can run, nowhere you can hide. I will hound you like the furies themselves from one end of this world to the other.\" The back of her dress rustled as huge, white-feathered wings unfurled from the special holes she had cut in it. \"I will make you pray to the gods for death, but I promise you, it shall not come. Am I understood?\" He nodded, red faced, and she released her grip. He fell to the ground, gripping his neck. Then he clambered to his feet and ran down the hill. When the panicked footfalls finally faded away, Medusa opened her eyes and let out a deep sigh. She went to Xenia and helped her to her feet. They embraced. \"You were brilliant,\" Xenia whispered, \"Absolutely fantastic.\" \"Thanks to you.\" \"These...\" Xenia asked, running her hands over her girlfriend's feathery appendages, \"Do you have...wings?\" \"When I want to,\" Medusa admitted, \"Truth be told, I've never been a...capable flier, so I tend to keep them tucked away.\" Xenia smiled and kissed her. \"So many surprises, my love. I fear we shall never be bored.\" Medusa laughed, \"I suppose I've had my fill of quiet, anyway.\" They kissed again. They were happy. Winter had broken, and Spring had come. The rain and storms had made for a bright season, and flowers bloomed all throughout the orchard behind the temple. Blossoms on the trees sung the prelude of a rich harvest. Birds chirped, sunning themselves and bathing in the crisp, clean water of the little pond. By the temple's entrance, Medusa and Xenia sat on a little stone bench that caught the mid-morning sun. Xenia leaned, sleepily, on Medusa's shoulder, and several of the serpents on that side of her head curled up in her auburn locks, sleeping peacefully. Medusa read from a pile of scrolls at her side, reciting poetry. \"-and that, I do think, someone will remember us, my dear, even in another time.'\" She closed the scroll. Xenia smiled. \"That was lovely. Could you read another?\" \"At this rate I'll have to start writing my own to keep you satisfied.\" \"That wouldn't be so bad, dearest. You have a poet's heart.\" Medusa smirked and began to unfurl a scroll when the sound of beating wings came from up above. Two gorgons, who looked much like Medusa, descended from the sky on white wings, landing at the front of the temple. Euryale, who was tall with broad shoulders, appraised the couple curiously. Stheno, who was petite, grinned broadly when she saw them. \"Welcome home, sisters.\" \"Medusa,\" Euryale said, \"Who is your friend?\" Xenia perked up. \"Oh,\" she blurted, hurriedly standing, \"Um, hello. I am Xenia. It's, uh, lovely to meet you.\" The taller sister raised her eyebrow, but stuck out a hand. \"Euryale.\" She waited for Xenia to shake. \"Sister,\" Medusa said, pointing at her eyes. \"Oh,\" said Euryale, \"Oh! Well, asked and answered, I suppose. I am Euryale, dear, it's lovely to meet you.\" \"And I'm Stheno!\" Xenia smiled. \"I'm so glad to finally meet you! Medusa speaks so highly of you both.\" \"I'm sure she does,\" Euryale smiled, \"Sister, I do believe we have much to discuss.\" Medusa nodded with a grimace. \"Can it wait a bit, though? We've nearly finished here.\" Eurydale rolled her eyes but couldn't suppress a smirk. \"Fine,\" she said, \"Come, Stheno, let's settle back in and leave these two to their...poetry.\" She walked into the temple, Stheno bounding after. Xenia sighed, and plopped back onto the bench beside Medusa. \"That went well,\" Medusa mused. \"Did it? They seemed...unsure.\" \"They're cautious, but I know, my love, give them time and they will simply adore you.\" She pressed her lips in Xenia's, who nestled back into her shoulder. \"Where did we leave off?\" Xenia asked. \"Right here. 'Like the sweet apple which reddens the topmost bough, atop the topmost twig, which the pluckers forgot, somehow...\" Many know only the end of Medusa's story, and so many know only hateful lies. The days ahead were not all joyous, for our young lovers, but there would always be times like this for them. Times of joy, and tenderness, and love that too few ever speak of. So often that is the truth behind the tales of those we call monsters. Too often that is the case.",

      "She ran out of the room, leaving the confused Xenia behind.",
      "She ran to the rear entry and began to hurriedly don her disguise from the statue it was hung on.",
      "Her snakes hissed in protest as she frantically wrapped the head scarf.",
      "\"Shut up!",
      "Just keep quiet under there and I promise I'll catch you extra mice tonight.\"",
      "They calmed and coiled up under the cloth.",
      "This would get her down the road, but she couldn't take Xenia all the way to the border.",
      "the village was only a twenty minute walk from the temple, but the sisters avoided it at all costs.",
      "If anyone there ever found out about the gorgon's home, it would be easy for them to make trouble.",
      "She looked around, panicked, for a solution.",
      "She saw it: a long, thin piece of cypress wood that they used to knock olives off of high branches.",
      "She led Xenia out to the road at the edge of the temple's grounds.",
      "\"It's not a far walk,\" she said, \"But stay close.\"",
      "\"You sound different,\" Xenia said, \"Are you wearing something over your face?\"",
      "Medusa cursed under her breath.",
      "This girl's hearing was incredible.",
      "\"I, uh, have a bad reaction to the sun.",
      "We should move.\"",
      "They headed down the little dirt path until it joined back with the larger main road.",
      "Xenia kept good pace and made pleasant conversation as they walked, though often she would drift until Medusa finally grabbed her hand and lead her directly.",
      "Her face felt hot under the veil.",
      "After a bit longer, the sight of the small village came into view.",
      "\"This is where I leave you.\"",
      "She finally huffed.",
      "\"Oh,\" Xenia said, \"Are we at the village?",
      "I can usually hear the market from here.\"",
      "\"I...I can't take you that far.",
      "If you continue down the road, you'll reach the eastern edge.\"",
      "\"I don't know if I can-\" \"Here.\"",
      "Medusa shoved the stick into Xenia's hand.",
      "\"Tap this on the ground in front of you.",
      "If it sounds hard,\" she tapped it on the road, \"Then you're on the right track.",
      "You'll be fine.",
      "It's after noon, so keep the sun on your face and you'll make it.\"",
      "\"Okay, I think I can manage that.",
      "Medusa, you've been so kind to me, I really do appreciate everything.\"",
      "\"It was nothing,\" Medusa huffed, \"Really.\"",
      "Xenia began down the road towards town, tapping her cane against the ground as she went.",
      "She stopped and turned.",
      "\"Perhaps I'll see you again?\" \"Perhaps.\"",
      "Medusa sighed.",
      "Xenia smiled and proceeded down the way.",
      "Medusa watched her until she was near enough to town that she was sure Xenia would make it before she turned back to make her way home.",
      "\"Perhaps.\"",
      "Summer had come, and the bright sun beat down on the Greek Isles, washing everything in intense heat.",
      "Cicada buzzed in the grove of olive and citrus trees behind the temple as Medusa set a plate of figs to dry in the hot sun.",
      "She wiped her brow and shushed her hair.",
      "The heat always seemed to excite them, and they became more and more restless as the summer grew.",
      "She sat in the shade of a fig tree, fanning herself and deciding whether it would be worth the effort to take a dip in the little pond out back.",
      "It was unlikely anyone would visit.",
      "\"Heroes\" were less common in the summer when the heat made traveling in armor less desirable.",
      "She was just starting to rouse herself when she heard a voice.",
      "\"Medusa?\"",
      "Her sisters likely wouldn't be back until next spring, so it probably wasn't them, she thought.",
      "Besides, Stheno would've tried to jump out and scare her first.",
      "No mortals who came to the temple would know her name, except...",
      "\"Oh, by Athena.\"",
      "She sighed.",
      "Wandering by the front entrance was Xenia.",
      "Her skin had tanned, and her hair was tied in a high ponytail.",
      "She wore a peach colored dress that came to her mid-thigh, and high sandals.",
      "\"Xenia?\"",
      "\"Oh, there you are!\"",
      "Xenia headed toward the sound of the other woman's voice, tapping the thin cane Medusa gave her along the way.",
      "She had become quite adept with it and managed to avoid small rocks and ledges in her path.",
      "\"It's, uh, good to see you, again,\" Medusa stammered, \"How did you get here?\"",
      "\"Well, mostly thanks to this wonderful little cane!",
      "It's been so helpful in getting around, I hardly ever get lost or fall down anymore.",
      "I was afraid my brother might break it for one of his jokes, but even he benefits from having to take less care of me.\"",
      "\"Oh.",
      "I'm...glad.\"",
      "\"Anyway, I remembered the way from last time and thought it might be nice to pay you a visit.",
      "Have your sisters not returned?\" \"No. Not yet.",
      "Would you, uh, like to come in?",
      "Are you thirsty?\"",
      "\"Yes,\" Xenia beamed, \"I'd like that.\"",
      "Medusa led her carefully through the main hall into the living area behind the altar.",
      "The Gorgons had converted it into a large, shared living space with several sofas and a stone table with four chairs.",
      "Door led to each of the sister's private quarters, and another into the kitchen.",
      "Medusa sat Xenia down at the table and retrieved a pitcher of water from the miniature cellar beneath the kitchen, which was cool even in the height of summer.",
      "She filled two cups and brought them out.",
      "Xenia drained hers in one and sheepishly asked for more, and Medusa refilled her cup.",
      "The blind girl sipped now, demurely.",
      "\"So,\" Medusa began, \"How have you been?\" \"Very well!",
      "I adore the summer, and get to spend most days walking by the beach, collecting sea shells, though sometimes I take the forest road so I can smell the trees and the wildflowers.",
      "Do you ever get to the beach?\"",
      "\"We're cliff side, so I'll watch the ocean in the evening.",
      "Most of the day I tend to the orchard and paint.\"",
      "\"That sounds lovely!",
      "Do you get out of here often?\"",
      "\"No,\" Medusa shook her head, \"But I have everything I need here.",
      "Even a little spring in back to swim in.\"",
      "\"Oh, I love swimming, but I don't get to much.",
      "I need someone to keep an eye on me so I don't get turned around.\"",
      "\"And no one will?\"",
      "\"I don't have many friends.",
      "And it's just Demetrius and I at home since mother and father passed.\"",
      "\"And has he been cruel to you, again?\"",
      "\"No,\" she waved her hand, \"He's never cruel, just...playful.",
      "He likes to make fun, but he's the only one who cares for me.",
      "He appreciates my new independence, though, he seems more cheerful.\"",
      "\"Hmm.\"",
      "\"Please don't judge him too harshly, Medusa.",
      "I can be such a burden on him.\"",
      "Medusa bit back a comment.",
      "\"What's that noise?",
      "Is something boiling?\"",
      "Medusa looked around for a moment until she realized what Xenia was talking about: her snakes were rousing and hissing, having picked up on her budding anger.",
      "She tried to gently pat them down.",
      "\"I'll tell you what, Xenia,\" she deflected, \"Let's go swimming.\"",
      "\"Really?\"",
      "\"Sure, I could use a cooling down.\"",
      "The pair ventured to the orchard behind the temple where lemon trees formed a ring around a crystal blue pond.",
      "It was only twenty feet across, and four feet deep at the center, but that was more than enough to enjoy on a hot day like today.",
      "Only when they arrived and Xenia began to disrobe did Medusa conceive the reality of her plan.",
      "She looked away, her cheeks on fire.",
      "Not only was Medusa seeing Xenia disrobe, but no one, outside of her sisters, had seen Medusa undressed in a very long time.",
      "And they still wouldn't, she realized, Xenia is blind.",
      "Medusa felt stupid.",
      "To be fair, she sort of was.",
      "She took off her dress and hung it on a nearby tree.",
      "She brought out a small head wrap and tucked her serpentine locks into it.",
      "No sense risking Xenia getting a handful of snakes.",
      "She took the other girl's hand and led her into the spring.",
      "They shivered as they waded into the cool water, but quickly adjusted.",
      "\"You should be okay,\" Medusa said, letting her hand go, \"It's not to deep or wide.\"",
      "\"Oh,\" was she blushing?",
      "\"S-sure, thank you.\"",
      "They settled, enjoying the water and the sounds of the summer around them.",
      "Medusa felt the snakes calm as her temperature dropped.",
      "\"This is wonderful,\" Xenia sighed, \"The water is perfect, and it smells so lovely out here.",
      "Lemons, olives, and are those hyacinths?\"",
      "\"They are,\" Medusa chuckled, \"You have a keen sense of smell.\"",
      "\"It's one of the ways I can enjoy the world.",
      "For example, you smell like...earthenware and...figs?\"",
      "Medusa blushed, \"Yeah, I was drying some when you arrived.\"",
      "\"Mmhmm, and there's something else, too, like a personal scent.",
      "Everyone has one, I've noticed.",
      "It makes it easy to recognize them when they're near.",
      "Though yours is quite unique.\"",
      "\"That's amazing.\"",
      "\"You're the amazing one, Medusa, living here alone, taking care of yourself.",
      "I wish I could do that.\"",
      "\"I mean, my sisters helped with a lot of it.",
      "They planted the orchard and taught me about drying and preserving food.\"",
      "\"Do they leave often?\"",
      "\"Every few years.",
      "They like to travel the isles.",
      "Euryale, my oldest sister, loves to sail.",
      "And Stheno gets so restless she'd drive the whole world mad cooped up in here.\"",
      "\"Why don't you go with them?\" Medusa paused.",
      "\"I...I like it here.",
      "I've never wanted to leave.\"",
      "She could feel Xenia examining her words.",
      "\"I understand,\" the other girl said, \"Home can be...hard to turn away from.\"",
      "The lounged, in silence, for some time.",
      "\"Why don't we get out,\" Medusa finally said, \"Have some of those figs.\"",
      "Xenia smiled, \"I'd like that.\"",
      "Xenia visited often after that.",
      "Every few days Medusa would hear the tapping of her cane up the little path and go out to greet her.",
      "She began to enjoy the visits, and planned around them.",
      "She cleared some of the statues out of the main chamber, putting the rest against the walls so her friend could walk through without issue.",
      "Xenia became more and more familiar with the grounds, and was able to find Medusa even if she was in the orchard picking fruit, or in the cellar tending to the preserves.",
      "Medusa had always enjoyed the time her sister's were away.",
      "Stheno and Euryale were lovely, but they could be a lot to deal with, and she had come to appreciate the peace and quiet that came with solitude.",
      "But being with Xenia was...different.",
      "Medusa never found herself tired of the other girls company and, on the occasions where more time than usual passed between her visits, she would find herself dawdling by the entrance of the temple, watching the clouds and listening closely for the tap tap tap of her friend coming up the hill.",
      "The only problem was that she was having trouble keeping their conversations away from the details of her life.",
      "Xenia was intensely curious as to how Medusa had come to be where she was, and every little fact threatened to give away her secret.",
      "To say nothing of the time Xenia wanted to trade hair-care tips.",
      "What would happen if she found out what Medusa was?",
      "Would she still accept her?",
      "Would she still want to be her friend?",
      "Would she...",
      "This troubled Medusa late that summer as she and Xenia walked through the orchard together.",
      "Xenia had put her cane up, and the pair walked with their arms linked.",
      "Medusa had her head wrapped, though her serpents were growing restless in the heat and little Perakus had peaked out to examine his surroundings with a curious tongue.",
      "\"I only worry that someone will accost you on the road,\" Medusa complained, \"Are you never concerned about robbers or bandits?\" Xenia laughed, \"You are sweet to worry,\" she said, \"But I've never heard of anything like that in the lands.",
      "I'm much more concerned of pits and rocks, though less so, thanks to you.\"",
      "\"I keep telling you,\" Medusa smiled, \"It's no great invention.",
      "I'm surprised no one thought of it before.",
      "But, if you aren't concerned...\" \"The only thing of danger around here is the hideous dread the travelers are always speaking of.\"",
      "\"Hideous dread?\"",
      "\"You've never heard?",
      "There's a local legend about a monster who lives on one of the hills.",
      "They say it was cursed by the gods to be so dreadful to look upon that anyone who does dies of fright.\"",
      "Medusa felt a pit in her stomach.",
      "She brushed Perakus back under the wrap, ignoring his protests.",
      "\"Do many speak of this legend?\"",
      "She asked.",
      "\"A few,\" Xenia admitted, \"It's a sort of local superstition.",
      "Some of the sailors who stop at the village know of it, too.",
      "Every elder has a second-cousin, or some such thing, who went onto the hills to slay it, and never returned.\"",
      "\"Do you fear it?\"",
      "She laughed, \"I suppose I'd have no reason too.",
      "Unless it just decides to gobble me up.",
      "It must be quite horrible to have been cursed in such a way.\"",
      "\"Maybe it wasn't a curse,\" Medusa muttered.",
      "\"What do you mean?\" \"Maybe it just wanted to be left alone.\"",
      "Xenia considered that for a few moments.",
      "\"Then,\" she said, \"I suppose something horrible must have happened to it, to ask the gods for such a thing.\"",
      "Medusa didn't respond.",
      "\"Enough of this melancholy topic,\" Xenia said, \"Let's go back and enjoy those candied lemons I smell.\"",
      "Xenia's next few visits were different.",
      "She was as sweet and jubilant as always, but there was something else.",
      "An undercurrent of tension under her words.",
      "A hesitance that Medusa had never noticed before.",
      "She continued to come to the temple, but less frequently, if only slightly.",
      "It was a few weeks later.",
      "Summer had nearly given way to autumn, and Medusa was reading at the table from one of her many scrolls of poetry.",
      "The sun had nearly set, so she had lit candles and lanterns by which to read.",
      "There was a knock at the back door.",
      "Medusa stared at it for a moment, unsure, as this wasn't something that had ever happened.",
      "Her serpents rose high, tongues flickering, mirroring her trepidation.",
      "\"Who...is it?\"",
      "She called.",
      "\"It's Xenia.\"",
      "\"Oh.\"",
      "She got up, bid her hair to calm down, and walked over to the door.",
      "Xenia stood outside, dressed in a long, white gown.",
      "She held her cane in both hands, her face twisted in a look of concern.",
      "\"Xenia,\" Medusa said, \"What are you doing here so late?",
      "The path will be too dark...no it won't, Medusa, don't be stupid.",
      "Please, come in.\"",
      "Xenia entered and found her way to the table.",
      "She sat down.",
      "\"Medusa,\" she said, her voice was shaky, \"Sit next to me.",
      "Please.\"",
      "Medusa did, scooting her chair just far enough away so that her uncovered serpents would be out of reach.",
      "Xenia chuckled, nervously, \"You always do that, you know?",
      "When I surprise you you stay out of reach.\"",
      "\"Xenia, is everything alright?",
      "You seem nervous.\"",
      "\"The first time we met, Medusa, you wouldn't take me to the village.",
      "Why was that?\" \"What-\" \"And you wore coverings over your face.",
      "You said that was to keep the sun off, but we've been in the sun many times since then, and you've had no trouble.",
      "Why was that?\"",
      "\"I-\" \"You never go to the village.",
      "You've been to market, to be sure, I remember you complaining about it, but never the one closest to you.",
      "Why?\"",
      "Medusa had nothing.",
      "\"Medusa, I cannot see.",
      "There is much in this world I miss, but also much I notice that others do not.",
      "When I spoke of the hideous dread the other day, I heard your voice.",
      "I heard you were nervous.",
      "Your breathing quickened.",
      "I could feel your heart pounding through your skin.\"",
      "\"What are you asking me, Xenia?\"",
      "\"I care for you, Medusa, but there's something I need to know.",
      "The other day a man came through the port.",
      "He was harried.",
      "He had been to Delphi, and the oracle told him never tarry on this island, because of the creatures that lived on it.",
      "A trio of sisters, cursed by the gods to turn any who look upon them to stone.",
      "You have two sisters, correct?",
      "And your front hall was full of statues, I felt them when I first came here.",
      "He called them the gorgons.\"",
      "Medusa was silent.",
      "\"Is it you?\" Medusa paused.",
      "Xenia was so sweet, and kind.",
      "She was friendly, and bright, and optimistic.",
      "But she was not stupid.",
      "\"Yes.",
      "I am Medusa, youngest of the gorgon sisters.",
      "The goddess Athena gave this, as you say, curse to us many years ago.\"",
      "\"Can I see?\" \"What?\"",
      "\"With my hands, can I see your face?",
      "I've never asked, you were always so nervous when I got to close.",
      "Can I look upon you?\"",
      "\"I-\" she was surprised by the request, \"I-I suppose.\"",
      "Xenia scooted close to her.",
      "She reached out, and Medusa guided her hands to her face.",
      "She felt her, running the tips of her fingers over her nose and brow.",
      "She stroked her cheekbones and touched her lips.",
      "\"I see.\"",
      "Xenia finally said.",
      "\"What?\"",
      "She sighed.",
      "\"Those legends never get anything right.",
      "You're gorgeous.\"",
      "Medusa blushed and her eyes welled with tears.",
      "\"W-w-what?",
      "Y-you're lying.\"",
      "\"Why would I be?",
      "Cute nose, high cheekbones.",
      "By Zeus, I wish my own lips were so full.\"",
      "Medusa was lost for words, \"You...your...I don't, I mean, my hair...\" \"Yes, what of your hair?",
      "You always keep it hidden.",
      "Is it unusual?\" \"It's...snakes.\"",
      "\"I'm sorry, I thought, for a second, you said snakes.\"",
      "\"Here,\" she grasped Xenia's hands again, \"Feel.",
      "They know you, so they won't bite.\"",
      "She guided her hands, slowly, into her serpent locks, which were fanning out to give better access.",
      "\"Oh!\"",
      "Xenia exclaimed, \"You weren't kidding.",
      "Well, that's interesting.",
      "I've never felt a snake before, but...they're quite smooth, like leather, I didn't expect-Oh, that tickles!\"",
      "\"Sorry, that's a tongue,\" Medusa explained, \"Korrina has to taste everything, I swear.\"",
      "\"They have names?\"",
      "\"Of course, Korrina, the little one you're touching now is Perakus.",
      "There's Menalaeus, Archibiades, Kassandra...\" She guided Xenia through her cranial menagerie.",
      "The serpents enjoyed the attention, and whatever apprehension Xenia might have had vanished as she caressed the friendly vipers.",
      "They were so involved, neither of them noticed Xenia scoot closer and closer to Medusa.",
      "Not until their faces were inches apart.",
      "They could feel each other's breath.",
      "Now, Medusa could smell her, too.",
      "Xenia smelled earthy and sweet, like wildflowers in fresh soil.",
      "\"They like you,\" Medusa breathed.",
      "\"Are they the only ones?\"",
      "Medusa had no words for her.",
      "She pressed her lips into Xenia's.",
      "They reveled in that beautiful, wonderful kiss for all of eternity.",
      "When they finally parted, flushed and panting, night had fallen, and crickets chirped outside the window.",
      "Xenia reached up and stroked Medusa's cheek.",
      "\"I think this one likes me a lot.\"",
      "Autumn came as Medusa and Xenia's romance bloomed, a single bright flower among cool winds and golden leaves.",
      "The blind girl made the journey to the old temple nearly every day.",
      "She would help with Medusa's various responsibilities and chores, and, once finished, they would spend the day together walking about the temple or simply lounging in each other's arms.",
      "Xenia would describe for Medusa the precise smells and sensations the winds carried, and Medusa would regale her with tales of her of the long time she'd spent living and traveling throughout the Greek world.",
      "On this day, they were laying in the orchard.",
      "Xenia's head rested on Medusa's chest, while they ate dried figs and talked.",
      "\"And then,\" Medusa continued, \"The myrmidons, all with their eyes covered, their General turned to stone, were just standing there, and Euryale said 'May we leave?",
      "Or will all of your wives be receiving new decorations for their gardens?'\" Xenia laughed, \"That's incredible.",
      "What happened next?\"",
      "\"They prepared our ship and let us leave.\"",
      "\"Your sister sounds great.\"",
      "\"She is.",
      "Euryale can be bossy, but she always knows what to do and say.",
      "And Stheno is great too, lively and very funny, though she can be a little much, at times.\"",
      "\"Do you think they'll like me?\"",
      "\"Oh, I have no doubt.\"",
      "\"Your heart is beating faster.\"",
      "\"I mean, I'm sure they'll love you.\"",
      "She corrected.",
      "\"They may be...apprehensive about a mortal being around our sanctuary, but I'll convince them.",
      "You'll see.",
      "It's not like they can turn you to stone.\"",
      "\"So how does it work?",
      "The turning to stone?\"",
      "\"Anyone who looks at us is turned to stone.",
      "Simple as that.\"",
      "\"And how to the snakes come in?\"",
      "\"They don't?",
      "I mean, they're venomous, but even if they're hidden the petrification still works.",
      "It's in our eyes, I think.\"",
      "\"So how did it happen?",
      "Oh, you've tensed up.",
      "I'm sorry, is it hard to talk about?",
      "You don't have to.\"",
      "\"I...\" Medusa had done everything to put that night behind her.",
      "\"It was...terrible.",
      "I wished...I prayed for a way that no one, no man, would ever look upon me again.",
      "Athena answered me.",
      "She told me there would be a price, but I didn't care.\"",
      "Tears flowed down her face.",
      "\"I wanted this.\"",
      "\"And your sisters?\"",
      "\"After...after that, my sisters wanted to be with me.",
      "We were all each other had.",
      "Athena gave them the same choice, and they accepted.\"",
      "\"So you've been together all of this time?",
      "Just the three of you?\" \"Mmhmm.\"",
      "\"They must really love you.\"",
      "\"They're my sisters.",
      "They're all I have.\"",
      "\"I-\" \"Xenia?\"",
      "A deep voice called from near the temple.",
      "Medusa shot up.",
      "\"Who is that?\" she hissed.",
      "\"My brother.",
      "Hide, I'll get rid of him.\"",
      "Medusa darted behind a tree.",
      "Xenia stood and walked toward Demetrius, who wandered over from the temple.",
      "\"There you are, kepfos, what are you doing out here?\"",
      "He was tall, with broad shoulders.",
      "His hair was long, and he had a dark, chin-strap beard.",

      "Some old temple?\"",
      "\"Yes, I think so.",

      "\"Oh, well, now you have, I guess.\"",
      "\"What are you hiding?",
      "I'd guess a boyfriend, but who would ever be interested in you?\"",
      "A nest of serpents hissed, nearby.",
      "\"What's that?\" Demetrius asked.",
      "\"Probably a bird.",
      "We should get back before it gets late.\"",
      "\"Don't be stupid, I want to look around.\"",
      "Ignoring her protests, he headed back towards the temple, entering through the large, open portal in the front.",
      "\"It's to Athena,\" he said, \"Too bad.",
      "Poseidon or Zeus would be more interesting.",
      "But what are these?\"",
      "By the time Xenia caught up to him, he was examining one of the statues along the walls.",
      "\"They're so realistic.",
      "And such expressions, what are they for?\" \"Demetrius, we really should leave.\"",
      "Xenia grabbed his tunic by the shoulder and pulled.",
      "He wrenched out of her grasp and shoved her.",
      "Xenia fell to the ground, her cane clattering away.",
      "\"Don't tell me what to do, kochone.",
      "I'm the elder brother.",
      "You listen to me.",
      "Hey, all these statues.",
      "That sailor a few months ago, didn't he say...By Poseidon, this is it!",
      "The hideous dread's lair!",
      "I have to tell the village, we can gather the men and-\" \"No!\"",
      "Xenia was standing, her fists balled in defiance.",

      "She didn't know what to say.",
      "\"You've always been stupid, sister, but never this stupid.",
      "This thing isn't your friend, it's a monster that does this to people.\"",
      "\"Only the ones who've tried to kill her!\"",
      "\"You mean heroes?",
      "Xenia, I'm getting the men, and we're coming back here to kill that monster.",
      "You need to go home and stay there until I tell you otherwise.\"",
      "He turned and left in a huff.",
      "After he was gone, Medusa entered the temple.",

      "Is that you?\"",
      "\"Yes.\"",
      "All of the color was gone from her face, and her voice trembled, \"I need to leave, Xenia.",
      "Right now.",
      "You can come with me if you want, but I have to go.\"",
      "\"But what about your sisters?\" \"They'll...they'll find me.",
      "Somehow.\"",
      "\"Medusa, we can stay.",
      "We can talk to them, it will be okay.\"",
      "\"No, Xenia, you don't understand.",
      "I can't be here when he comes back with the village.",
      "I can't.\"",
      "\"Please, Medusa,\" Xenia cried, \"Help me understand.\"",
      "Medusa paused.",
      "\"I was the most beautiful girl in my village.",
      "I'm not being vain, Xenia, I was.",
      "The gods themselves declared it.",
      "Men would sing songs of me.",
      "People passing through would make every effort to meet me.",
      "Every man I met wanted to share my life or my bed, but I turned them all down.",
      "I wasn't interested.",
      "You can probably guess why.\"",
      "Xenia flushed.",
      "\"Then a new man arrived.",
      "He was tall, and impressive, and smelled of salt-water and he asked to share my bed, and I told him no.",
      "He did not take well to that.\"",
      "\"Medusa...\" She took a deep breath.",
      "\"He followed me to Athena's temple when I went to pray that evening and he...he took what I would not give.",
      "He stole it from me, Xenia.",
      "I thought it was over, I hoped so badly, but...he brought them all.",
      "The men from the village.",
      "All the men I had turned down.",
      "All the men who thought I owed them something.\"",
      "She fell to her knees, sobbing.",
      "Xenia reached for her, wrapping her arms around Medusa's shoulders.",
      "\"After,\" she choked, \"They dragged me out, into the rain, threw me in the mud.",
      "They laughed, Xenia.",
      "I can still hear it.",
      "The laughing.",
      "I was so ashamed, so crushed.",
      "I prayed to Athena to take my hurt from me, to ensure such a thing would never happen again, and so...\" \"She made you a gorgon.\"",
      "Medusa nodded.",
      "\"The man...he was Poseidon, disguised in human form.",
      "She could not strike him and, in a way, we had defiled her temple, together.",
      "She told me her gift would come with a cost.",
      "Once my sisters knew what happened, they stormed the town, demanding to know what would be done.",
      "They found the men in their homes, at their jobs, living their lives.",
      "No one cared.",
      "No one, even those who weren't a part of it, would raise their voice for justice.",
      "So they screamed their plea to the heavens, and Athena gave them the same gift she'd given to me.\"",
      "\"What did they do?\" Medusa sniffed.",
      "\"There's no village there, anymore.",
      "Only ruins.",
      "And statues.\"",
      "Xenia squeezed her tight.",
      "\"I'll go down the hill, try to buy you time.",
      "Get packed and leave.",
      "I won't make you go through that again.\"",
      "Medusa nodded.",
      "\"Good luck, my love.\"",
      "They kissed.",
      "\"My heart is with you.\"",
      "Medusa packed dried fruits and preserves into a bag, and loaded clothes into another.",
      "She knew her sisters would return, eventually, so she considered how best to direct them to her.",
      "And what of Xenia?",
      "She needed to leave it where all of her loved ones could find her.",
      "But where would she go?",
      "North, along the coast?",
      "Into the woods?",
      "With winter approaching, neither were ideal, but she was short on options.",
      "She decided she would follow the sea, and leave the missive where Xenia and her sisters would know where to look, in the preserving cellar beneath the kitchen.",
      "But Xenia can't read parchment.",
      "She cursed to herself.",
      "She'd have to carve it.",
      "She made relatively quick, though slapdash, work of the message, but she was confident it would be effective.",
      "The sun was already setting, though, as she stole out the back of the temple.",
      "She heard a commotion along the road.",
      "Just in time.",
      "She chanced a look at the mob, peeking around the far corner.",
      "It was, indeed, a large collection of men from the village, as well as a few women, bearing torches, farming tools, and a few chipped spears.",
      "Medusa shivered.",
      "She had to get out.",
      "Demetrius was leading the mob, holding a fishing trident, and he was dragging someone.",
      "Oh no.",
      "It was Xenia.",
      "She looked ruffled, and there were bruises along her arms and a long cut down her cheek.",
      "Her serpents bristled beneath her head wrap.",
      "She felt her heart pound boiling blood through her veins.",
      "The thought of the crowd, the men all looking at her made her knees shake and her stomach roil.",
      "She could leave.",
      "Run away before anyone saw her.",
      "She could.",
      "She knew what she had to do.",
      "The mob approached the temple, stopping just short of the entrance.",
      "Demetrius yanked on Xenia's arm and threw her onto the ground before him.",
      "\"Are you there, monster?",
      "I brought your kochone laikas.",
      "Come and greet her!\"",
      "Nothing happened.",
      "There was a grumble through the crowd.",
      "\"Not interested?\"",
      "He raised his trident, \"Then you won't mind if I skewer her into the dirt?\"",
      "\"Foolish mortals!\"",
      "Everyone froze as the torches in the temple came to life, and, framed by statues of terrified adventurers, was Medusa.",
      "She had changed into her long white gown, and wore belt and bracers designed to look like intertwined serpents.",
      "The vipers in her hair fanned out, fangs bared and hissing, menacingly.",
      "Her eyes were closed.",
      "\"You dare traipse upon the sanctuary of the Gorgons?!",
      "Flee, now, or face my wrath, and end up as these other hapless 'heroes' have before you!\"",
      "The crowd blanched at her threat and terrifying visage, but Demetrius resisted.",
      "\"So that's what you look like,\" he sneered, \"No wonder you had to get this blind fool to care for you.\"",
      "Medusa snarled, and her serpents rose, aggressively.",
      "\"Leave,\" she ordered, \"Now, and leave the girl.",
      "Or you will decorate my hall for the rest of time.\"",
      "\"Will we?\"",
      "He asked, \"Can you stop us all before we take you down?",
      "Before we swarm you?",
      "I mean you are hideous, for sure, but I don't seem to be dead, yet.\"",
      "He was arrogant, Medusa thought, but he might be right.",
      "She didn't know if she could petrify them all before they were on her.",
      "Regardless of how her gambit played out, this was a huge risk.",
      "\"Get out,\" she growled, \"I don't want to hurt you.\"",
      "\"Brother.\"",
      "Xenia pushed herself to her feet.",
      "\"Please, don't do this.",
      "She isn't a monster.",
      "Just go, please.\"",
      "People yelled from the crowd.",
      "\"Traitor!\"",
      "\"Freak!\"",
      "A rock flew from the crowd and struck Xenia across the temple.",
      "She cried out and sprawled on the floor.",
      "\"Xenia!\"",
      "Medusa rushed to her, chancing to open her eyes just enough to see her beloved, unconscious and bleeding in her arms.",
      "Medusa forgot fear.",
      "She forgot pain.",
      "She forgot mercy.",
      "She forgot love and glory.",
      "The goddess only sung one word in her mind: Rage.",
      "Medusa roared, her serpents hissed and spit venom.",
      "The crowd flinched and fell silent.",
      "Even Demetrius took a step back.",
      "\"Die!\"",
      "she screamed.",
      "Before she could open her eyes and unleash her deadly glare, a soft hand covered her face.",
      "\"Medusa,\" Xenia whispered, \"Don't.",
      "You aren't what they call you.",
      "You don't have to be like them.\"",
      "Medusa felt her lover's touch.",
      "She could feel her heartbeat.",
      "Smelled her scent, earth, and sweat, and hyacinths.",
      "The fire in her heart died down.",
      "The serpents on her head relaxed and lowered to frame her face.",
      "Perakus nuzzled her cheek, licking away a tear.",
      "She stroked his head and smiled.",
      "\"You remember the best part of me,\" she sniffed, \"You remember I'm not a monster.\"",
      "The crowd had gone silent at the tender display.",
      "They simply stood and watched for a moment.",
      "A man spoke out, \"What are we doing?\"",
      "Another said, \"There's no danger here.",
      "Let's go home.\"",
      "\"What?\"",
      "Demetrius cried, \"What's wrong with you?",
      "The monster is right there!",
      "Have you lost you manhoods?",
      "Have you lost your minds?\"",
      "An older man with a white beard put a hand on his shoulder.",
      "\"Elder?\"",
      "\"It's over, Demetrius,\" he said, \"I will not be part of senseless slaughter.\"",
      "He looked to the girls, \"Medusa, we will not bother you again, so long as you and your sisters do not trouble us.",
      "Your secret will be safe.\"",
      "\"Thank you,\" said Medusa, \"You will not see me again.\"",
      "He nodded, turned, and left with the others.",
      "Demetrius yelled after them, \"You can't!",
      "Think of the glory!",
      "The songs!\"",
      "When they disappeared down the hill, Demetrius turned back to the temple and found Medusa upon him.",
      "She wrapped a hand around his throat and, with hardly an effort, lifted him so his toes dangled above the path.",
      "His eyes bulged in shock and pain.",
      "Medusa kept her eyes closed, but her vipers neared the terrified man's face, fangs bared and dripping venom.",
      "\"Let me make something clear to you, koprias.\"",
      "She growled, \"Should you ever cause Xenia, myself, or any woman trouble ever again, I will not turn you to stone before I break you into pieces, chop you to to chunks, and feed you to my snakes.",
      "There will be nowhere you can run, nowhere you can hide.",
      "I will hound you like the furies themselves from one end of this world to the other.\"",
      "The back of her dress rustled as huge, white-feathered wings unfurled from the special holes she had cut in it.",
      "\"I will make you pray to the gods for death, but I promise you, it shall not come.",
      "Am I understood?\"",
      "He nodded, red faced, and she released her grip.",
      "He fell to the ground, gripping his neck.",
      "Then he clambered to his feet and ran down the hill.",
      "When the panicked footfalls finally faded away, Medusa opened her eyes and let out a deep sigh.",
      "She went to Xenia and helped her to her feet.",
      "They embraced.",
      "\"You were brilliant,\" Xenia whispered, \"Absolutely fantastic.\"",
      "\"Thanks to you.\"",
      "\"These...\" Xenia asked, running her hands over her girlfriend's feathery appendages, \"Do you have...wings?\"",
      "\"When I want to,\" Medusa admitted, \"Truth be told, I've never been a...capable flier, so I tend to keep them tucked away.\"",
      "Xenia smiled and kissed her.",
      "\"So many surprises, my love.",
      "I fear we shall never be bored.\"",
      "Medusa laughed, \"I suppose I've had my fill of quiet, anyway.\"",
      "They kissed again.",
      "They were happy.",
      "Winter had broken, and Spring had come.",
      "The rain and storms had made for a bright season, and flowers bloomed all throughout the orchard behind the temple.",
      "Blossoms on the trees sung the prelude of a rich harvest.",
      "Birds chirped, sunning themselves and bathing in the crisp, clean water of the little pond.",
      "By the temple's entrance, Medusa and Xenia sat on a little stone bench that caught the mid-morning sun.",
      "Xenia leaned, sleepily, on Medusa's shoulder, and several of the serpents on that side of her head curled up in her auburn locks, sleeping peacefully.",
      "Medusa read from a pile of scrolls at her side, reciting poetry.",
      "\"-and that, I do think, someone will remember us, my dear, even in another time.'\" She closed the scroll.",
      "Xenia smiled.",
      "\"That was lovely.",
      "Could you read another?\"",
      "\"At this rate I'll have to start writing my own to keep you satisfied.\"",
      "\"That wouldn't be so bad, dearest.",
      "You have a poet's heart.\"",
      "Medusa smirked and began to unfurl a scroll when the sound of beating wings came from up above.",
      "Two gorgons, who looked much like Medusa, descended from the sky on white wings, landing at the front of the temple.",
      "Euryale, who was tall with broad shoulders, appraised the couple curiously.",
      "Stheno, who was petite, grinned broadly when she saw them.",
      "\"Welcome home, sisters.\"",
      "\"Medusa,\" Euryale said, \"Who is your friend?\" Xenia perked up.",
      "\"Oh,\" she blurted, hurriedly standing, \"Um, hello.",
      "I am Xenia.",
      "It's, uh, lovely to meet you.\"",
      "The taller sister raised her eyebrow, but stuck out a hand.",
      "\"Euryale.\"",
      "She waited for Xenia to shake.",
      "\"Sister,\" Medusa said, pointing at her eyes.",
      "\"Oh,\" said Euryale, \"Oh!",
      "Well, asked and answered, I suppose.",
      "I am Euryale, dear, it's lovely to meet you.\"",
      "\"And I'm Stheno!\"",
      "Xenia smiled.",
      "\"I'm so glad to finally meet you!",
      "Medusa speaks so highly of you both.\"",
      "\"I'm sure she does,\" Euryale smiled, \"Sister, I do believe we have much to discuss.\"",
      "Medusa nodded with a grimace.",
      "\"Can it wait a bit, though?",
      "We've nearly finished here.\"",
      "Eurydale rolled her eyes but couldn't suppress a smirk.",
      "\"Fine,\" she said, \"Come, Stheno, let's settle back in and leave these two to their...poetry.\"",
      "She walked into the temple, Stheno bounding after.",
      "Xenia sighed, and plopped back onto the bench beside Medusa.",
      "\"That went well,\" Medusa mused.",
      "\"Did it?",
      "They seemed...unsure.\"",
      "\"They're cautious, but I know, my love, give them time and they will simply adore you.\"",
      "She pressed her lips in Xenia's, who nestled back into her shoulder.",
      "\"Where did we leave off?\" Xenia asked.",
      "\"Right here. '",
      "Like the sweet apple which reddens the topmost bough, atop the topmost twig, which the pluckers forgot, somehow...\" Many know only the end of Medusa's story, and so many know only hateful lies.",
      "The days ahead were not all joyous, for our young lovers, but there would always be times like this for them.",
      "Times of joy, and tenderness, and love that too few ever speak of.",
      "So often that is the truth behind the tales of those we call monsters.",
      "Too often that is the case."

    "text": "Prompt: Greek mythology, Demeter & Persephone, a woman's rage is like the winter Her daughter is different, when she returns, when she rises once more above the ground and stands, whole and blinking, in the sun. On the surface she is the same, skin unblemished and hair smooth, no trace of his touch staining her like a blight. But a mother's eye will see; the pale skin, bone white and dead chill; the eyes, haunted and huge and stark, and so winter becomes - a mourning, a tribute, a memory. Prompt: Greek Mythology, Hades/Persephone, wait for me \"Wait for me,\" he says, soft in the shell of her ear, when the seasons shift and the earth breathes over their heads, new life wending its way down to take away his. In the bright of summer above, she blooms, and basks in the light, heady and swaying, drunk on the riot of color and life and yet; and yet - \"Wait for me,\" she whispers, palm pressed into the earth, dark and damp, fingers digging down until she feels his chill. Prompt: Greek Mythology, Persphone and Hades, role reversal She watches him carefully, this dark, slender king, pale amongst the bright riot of blossoms that surround them, and ponders all the tricks and tools at her disposal. Life, she knows, is both seductive and repulsive to him, so unfamiliar, so unexpected - but death, ah, death is his reluctant home, the soft spot that will allow her to penetrate the deceptively thick shell of his reserve. \"Do you not find it strange,\" she asks, carelessly plucking a handful of berries, \"how the very material that sustains our lives must die to make it so?\" and she's careful, so very careful, to let them fall artlessly from her fingers, to turn away without watching, as though she hasn't seen the fixed nature of his gaze, as though she cannot feel his hunger seeping through her, even now; he will eat, and she will have dominion, even over death - this she knows. Prompt: Greek mythology, Hades/Persephone, everything they said about him was wrong Of all that she did not expect, this surprises her most: his skin is warm. She is built of her own world, all lush life, brightness and warmth, rosy, sun-spotted skin and flushed cheeks; everything in his world is dark, muffled, floating in an endless chilled mist, leeched of color, a delicate veil cloaking sharp edges. But when his hands are finally upon her, in those first tentative touches, as though she is as delicate as a fresh-bloomed flower, they are more than warm; they are a brand, raising an inferno within her, a heat blinding enough to replace the sun, to melt her bones into his; enough to make steam rise from her skin, bright white amidst the grey. Prompt: Greek Mythology, Persephone & Psyche, why Persephone chose to give her a box of death/eternal sleep instead of beauty The Goddess of the Underworld gazes long at her, and though her eyes are a warm shade of green, Psyche feels chilled to her marrow. \"No,\" Persephone says finally, shifting on her great ebony throne, her slim bare feet flashing from beneath the hem of her dark robe, \"I think you have had your fill of beauty, and both the prizes and trials it carries in its wake.\" When the box is handed to her, tiny and smooth and far too heavy for its size, Persephone gives her a smile all full of edges and promise, and says, \"This is something you have not yet known, and one way or another, it will gain you what you seek, that I promise you.\" Prompt: Greek mythology, Ariadne/Dionysus, don't be afraid \"Don't be afraid,\" she says to him, laughing, before the battle begins. As she lies dying, he says it in return, tears flowing like wine, like blood, over his face. Even in the Underworld, she hears its echoes, and waits. Prompt: Greek mythology, Artemis/Iphigenia, modern roommate AU shenanigans \"You're a lifesaver Art, you know that?\" Iphigenia muttered into the vicinity of Artemis's collarbone, squeezing so hard she thought they both might break. \"Hey,\" Artemis said, shifting enough to look her in the face, \"so your jerkass dad cuts you off, that doesn't mean I'm going to let my girl end up out on the street. Of course,\" she added, brushing her thumb over Iphigenia's lips and winking to make her laugh, \"you might just have to work for me in other ways to pay that rent...\" Prompt: Greek mythology, Hector/Andromache/Helen, heaven can't help me now \"All is well,\" Andromache whispers in her ear, though all Helen hears is \"All you do is a betrayal.\" \"The gods owe you a moment's release\" she says, hot against Helen's ear, and Hector's hands are hot against her skin, stronger and more sure than his brother's by far, but oh, she can't, how can she. \"Give in; you are safe,\" Hector tell her, as his wife's arms wrap around her and Helen's world comes apart; still, her head echoes in ecstasy, \"Flee, for I will bring you ruin,\" and they mistake her sobs for pleasure, and the gods look the other way for one more precious night. Prompt: Andromache/Hektor, was ready for the downslide/but not for spring to well up \"You should never have come here,\" he says, and, \"I'm sorry, I'm sorry,\" breathed against her skin in the darkness like an offering, like a prayer for release. But she is not. Her thoughts remain the same, since she came to this city a proud girl, expecting a fight and finding instead - I love as she saw the way he looked at her, and smiled, and I love as his fingers splayed over the tight skin of her rounded belly, feeling their child shift inside, and I love even now, even as she watches him walk away, straight backed and shining in his armor, one last time. Prompt: Trojan War Cycle, Hektor/Andromache, But if you close your eyes/ does it almost feel like nothing changed at all? With her eyes closed, the distant campfires on the beach are blotted out in the blackness; the scents of smoke and blood and burning might be mistaken for the night following a great sacrifice, the constant unease draped over the city like a smothering blanket be merely the foreboding of a storm blowing in from the sea. \"Close your eyes,\" she murmurs to Hektor, and shifts her body to straddle his, hands meeting the familiar planes of his chest. \"It is just you and I, my love,\" she says, and feels his mouth curve against hers, for as long as the darkness lasts. Prompt: Trojan War Cycle, any member/ship of the Royal Family of Troy [Hector, Paris & Cassandra], we were caught up and lost in all of our vices In the city, with Andromache, Hektor is calm, and responsible - a good father, noble son, caring husband - but here in the dust and grit of the battlefield, he is a beast, a creature born of blood rage and wrath, striking down those in his path and exulting in it, though he knows it is wrong; for it is not a thing he shares, not with anyone. Sometimes Paris believes he is frightened of everything in the world - the battle raging endlessly below, the disappointment in Priam's eyes, the bellowing rage of the Greeks, come for his blood - but mostly, as he lies in the darkness beside his great prize, he fears losing Helen most of all, and clutches her all the harder, until she shifts in his grasp, his fingers leaving marks in their wake. \"You will save a city in peril, and guide it to the greatest glory the world has known,\" Cassandra tells Aeneas, but he merely laughs, and says, \"I'm no great hero such as that, my friend,\" and leaves before she can tell him no, you are the only one among us who is. Prompt: Trojan War Cycle, Cassandra & Any [Paris], gather ye rosebuds while ye may Paris has never been her favorite brother; he is too callow, too flighty, too well pleased with himself. And yet: he is sweet, and gentle; it was he who would bring her kittens and flowers when they were small, always wanting to please, always wanting to be her hero. That is why, when he boards the fateful ship, she lays a hand on his arm, and smiles, and tells him, \"Enjoy well your days in the sun, brother,\" though he only laughs and kisses her hair farewell, a careless boy still. Prompt: greek mythology, trojan war queens, the men had their oath of the horse; the women had something just as binding His brothers speculate, in sly, sideways glances, in murmured asides to one another - Was she worth it? Was there enough beauty in all the world to pay this price?- and still, Helen holds her head high. But Andromache takes her by the hand, saying, \"We understand,\" and Cassandra meets her eyes, no trace of madness in her gaze, and whispers, \"You chose this too.\" \"Freedom is worth any price,\" Andromache says, firm and proud, and only then does Helen allow herself the luxury of tears. Prompt: Greek Mythology, Helen/Paris, this is a state of grace \"Were you ever truly happy here?\" he asks on the eve of battle, when the clamor of the Greeks at the gates rises even to the level of the palace. She feels his fingertips brushing her skin, and sees with dry, sleepless eyes the beloved lines of his face before her, and knows what he really means is were you ever truly happy with me? She thinks of Sparta, and Menelaus, and escape; she thinks of trying to explain the difference between choosing and happiness, and finds they've grown too tangled inside her, and all she can say is, \"I never dared to think we'd even get so far.\" Prompt: Greek mythology, Aeneas/Cassandra, when we were young/oh we did enough At Hector's wedding, she dances the night away with suitors from far off lands, with her brothers, even with her father, coaxing old Priam down from his throne with smiles and eager, outstretched hands. Aeneas she ignores, leaving him to glower over his fine wine amidst the wreckage of the banquet tables, until the night begins to lengthen towards the sun's rising, and the groom and his bride have long been hauled away. He is just beginning to doze when her hands tickle beneath his tunic, the wildflower scent of her hair bringing him out of sleep with a jerk as her laughing voice murmurs in his ear, \"See, you do care, friend Aeneas; you cannot pretend indifference much longer.\" Prompt: Trojan War Cycle, Aphrodite & Cassandra, here to make amends Her heart has ever been mercurial, soft and hardened by turns, but she truly feels for this little princess, Priam's pretty daughter, and all the misfortunes the gods have heaped upon her. \"Surely there is one you hold beloved,\" she whispers, \"for all deserve a little pleasure; but speak his name, and he shall be yours.\" \"I will bring pleasure to none,\" Cassandra says, her eyes on the distant figure of the goddess's child, and Aphrodite feels chill, even in the midst of Apollo's blazing sun. Prompt: fairytales/mythology, any [Cassandra], a step sideways from reality In visions granted in sun-stroke, Cassandra sees her prophecies gone right - her brother kept at home, a war averted, a wooden horse burning high on the beach, screams lost to the crackling flames. In her dreams, Hektor is king and greyed with age; Paris laughs at his side, gone fat and jolly; Creusa beams at her brood of grandchildren, and Cassandra - Cassandra is not there, and she wakes with the sun's glare in her eyes, harsh and pitiless; unforgiving, unrelenting, unbearable. Prompt: Greek mythology, any woman [Cassandra], I'm locking up everyone/who ever laid a finger on me \"You will die,\" she tells him, for she sees it all: the raging wife, the welter of blood, the final act of a revenge long plotted, coming at last to brutal flowering; he does not believe her, this commander who thinks himself above all, his ugly hands pressed hard against her mouth, stifling her voice. \"You will die,\" she warns the wife, for she sees this too: children must honor a father they barely recall, even at the cost of a mother they know too well; she does not believe her, and even the feather-light touch of her fingers, pushing away the girl as though to push away the prophecy, feel cold and sharp as bone. \"You will die,\" she whispers to the god with her last breath, for this is her last sight: his temples crumbling, his light fading, his believers turning to a different sort of son; she knows from the flash of terror in his eyes that he believes her, and so she goes to Hades with a smile on her lips.",

    "text": "There were more statues around the mouth of Medusa's cave than there had been the last time Athena visited. The first couple times she came to visit, the statues had been of varying kinds. Some had been old admirers of Medusa who did not believe the tales and come wooing her in her exile. Some had been shepherds and travelers who had not heard the tales and came near her by accident. Now, though, the statues were all of a kind, warriors who came seeking to kill her or adventurers seeking a marvel, sure they could win out against the odds. Now the story had spread far and wide; everyone had heard it. Athena would have preferred if the story scared everyone off entirely, and no one came to visit Medusa at all--except for Athena herself, of course. But this was the best alternative, she supposed. She admired one of the new statues, a man with a body covered in muscles and a face full of pride, now frozen and dead. There would have been a time he could have made Medusa his, one way or another, but not anymore. Medusa was Athena's. She went to the entrance of the cave and called in. Medusa answered, asking for a moment to look presentable. She came out in minutes. Her dress was worn and ripped--she could not go into town to get new clothing--and so she could only be so presentable, but her face was clean and carefully smiling, surrounded though it was by serpents. \"Medusa, it is good to see you again!\" \"You are the only one who would say that,\" Medusa said drily. But she was not as melancholy as she was at times. She opened her arms for Athena's embrace, and Athena was careful not to squeeze too hard. She could break a demigod's back that way, never mind a fragile woman like Medusa. \"Come in,\" Medusa said. She waved Athena into the cave. It was not a bad set-up, full of the various gifts Athena had brought her over the years. Pots and pans and such. Probably a few too many knives. Athena was always seeing the most beautiful knives and wanting to give them to someone, and usually her favorites were more warlike than Medusa. But Medusa would always smile and accept them, gingerly putting them on the shelf she'd set up on the wall, so she figured it was all right. And so she'd brought another knife today. \"This is a rare one, my sweet,\" she said, holding it out so Medusa could get a good look. \"Is it? You know I don't know much about weaponry.\" \"I went to Hephaestus himself. He owed me a favor.\" As he often did. \"This one could slice through bone, I'm sure. Or stone.\" She smiled. \"I'm sure you must get tired of all those statues staring at you. Though they can see nothing, their gaze is still troubling. With this you could deface their eyes--or cut off their heads entirely...\" \"How thoughtful.\" Medusa took the knife. She did not wave it around or even weight it long in her hand, but put it with the other ones. \"I'll consider it. A very generous gift.\" \"I will bring you anything if you ask me.\" She put a hand on Medusa's waist. \"There is something I would like, actually. Though I would never trouble a god for my petty desires...\" The snakes around Medusa's head squirmed uneasily. \"What?\" \"Well, a new dress?\" Medusa shrugged. \"You sometimes walk among humans unknown, don't you? I thought perhaps the next time you are in town...\" How boring. Medusa had always been like this--no sense of the greater things. But Athena forgave her. She was only a Gorgon, after all, and no goddess. \"Of course.\" They talked a while longer. Athena asked Medusa to describe her last encounter with a warrior, and Medusa shrugged. Not much to tell, she said. All very mundane. \"A story of a battle,\" Athena insisted. Medusa said, \"It was hardly a battle. I heard him outside, and went into the cave. He called for me to come out. I was afraid he'd come in--I thought of how his statue could end up in here, stuck staring at me...\" \"Ah, so you do see the use of the knife I brought you. The eyes of the dead are truly fearsome.\" \"...I gave up and went outside, and he died on seeing me. I suppose I could have stayed inside a while longer, and maybe he would have went away.\" \"I doubt it. You know little of warriors, sweet. When the thought of a battle is in one's blood, it is stronger than wine. To get one to leave a battle would be harder than tearing them from a pot of gold and jewels.\" She put a hand on the back of Medusa's neck, slipping back the serpents who lifted themselves away from her hand to accommodate. \"But don't worry yourself about it. You know little of battle, but you will always win. That is my gift to you.\" Medusa smiled at her. Her eyes looked to be watering a little, but they didn't blink. \"And since you have won again for me,\" Athena said, \"shall I give you a prize?\" She kissed Medusa on stiff lips until Medusa relaxed into it. The snakes settled themselves against her hand, and she put her other hand through one of the rips in Medusa's dress, a wide rip at the side. She felt the smooth skin of Medusa's waist--when she could not reach far enough, she ripped the dress open farther. Medusa squirmed, but she hushed her. She'd get a new dress, remember? In any case, there was no shame in nudity--not with a well-formed body like Medusa's, and especially not when none would see it, none but Athena, and there was no reason to hide anything from Athena... And Medusa sighed and relaxed again, and Athena guided her to her cot and lay her down, gentle, as the snakes twined themselves around her arm and hissed, singing threats and love songs stronger than Medusa herself would ever voice.",

    "text": "X. Ah, thinks the Queen as the Prince accepts adoption, turned out well enough. She can hear her husband agree solemnly. It shall be, for now. For nothing is permanent, and both constellations know from experience that their newly adopted son habitually wreaks havoc in the most astonishing way possible. His status as a Fallen befits him rather too well. III. For Persephone, the start of this whole broadcasting business comes with her husband, Hades. To be precise, there is no such thing as a Star Stream until a pantheon of twelve gods give or take form in the south of the Balkan Peninsula. Only after they kick Persephone out of her Trinity and Hestia to the fireplace does the whole storyline with demigods start. Chthonic deities like her household choose not to interfere since they aren't exactly fond of toying with living Incarnates, happier to build their own legends without batches of misplaced heroes. Yes, she is referencing the whole debacle with Theseus and his idiot friend. IV. 'Queen of Darkest Spring' becomes her modifier as Hesiod finally publishes his brand of the Theogony, introducing her to the general public as Daughter of Demeter, Goddess of Spring, and Consort to the Affluent Father of Night. It does not mean that she likes said modifier. She would have preferred it to be named after her earlier names: Pyirsipyatya, Phersephassa. Bringer of Destruction, the Destroying Dove. After all, these were ancient and true, made much before mere Persephone had been coined by those who, at their very best, mauled the language. These names represents her very core, even if they were not very suitable to the whole Olympus concept the majority of their society seemed to favor. Shame. II. Aides does not always have a place in the Underworld. He is a newborn lore when he turns up in the dark caverns that crawls deep down into the Earth, blinking owlishly up towards the Destroyer. Intrigued by the dark-eyed child, Phersephassa takes him in with a graceful sweep of her arms. It does not take much for a matriarchal society to become farmers, and it takes even less for it to become a strict patriarchal one. Apparently they cannot imagine Death as a mere goddess. Hades grows accordingly to these beliefs, from Phersephassa's little boy into a man, eyes still echoing with such profound darkness. Now called Persephone to most, she takes to the change like a fish in the water yet never yields her power to her former ward. He never demands it anyway, sitting regal on the left side of the double throne while Persephone holds court. Humans always reason that it is due to the Underworld being a mirror to the living world, that it is why Hades is on the left, not right. Fools they are. Fools they always are. VI. But then all this means utterly nothing in the grand scheme of the universe. Nothing truly does. The Queen flicks a coin. Heads or tails? V. Persephone can enjoy how her myths fluctuates between outright kidnapping and voluntary runaway. She cannot enjoy how she is called Kore, as if she were a mere maiden with only an idle task on her hands like painting flowers. The imagination of humanity (or really, the lack thereof) is startling sometimes, and Persephone scoffs. Then she misses those too, for it would still be better than this. VIII. Tails. She is sick of this, all of this; e verything that confines her is asphyxiating and she bleeds, oh how she bleeds. I. Persephone. Phersephatta, Pherepapha, Periphona, Pyirsipyatya. Despoina, Praxidike, Melinoia, Soteira. Names of the underworld, names of a destroyer. Epithets of vengeance, of justice, of power. Of spring, of honey, of youth. Of eternal sleep and chthonic life; the Mistress, the Savior, the Bringer of Fruit. Mere names of a past. There is only the Queen of Darkest Spring here. VII. Heads. The first time the Queen glimpses the young man she thinks, oh. It seems as if stars glimmer over him, blessing every step of his way and the Queen is not surprised at the radical choice Olympus has made. She can completely understand how they pointed him out as the singularity of this game. For he is. It is evident in both in his light, radiant as a neutron star and in his partner-in-crime, tenebrous as a black hole. Birds of a feather, two of a kind, matching each other so perfectly. The Queen throws back her head and laughs like a madwoman before bending down to whisper an advice. The Father steals a glance and smiles faintly. Her darling husband knows she has found exactly what she has been looking for. O. Pyirsipyatya, Damate, Posedao. The Trinity of Eleusis, of Mycenean Greece. The birthlore of its gods, bright-eyed and sun-kissed, forever lost within the flood of foreign gods: Of young concepts who take their place and change their myths. IX. Of young children who take their place and change their myths. Grieving, lost, idealistic children like the Prince of Salvation, the Seventy-Third Fallen; The Apostle of Two Ends--he shall change everything for his beloved and the Queen shall watch over him step by step. After all, it is what she had done for her darling Hades, her husband and successor. She has never hesitated to embrace inevitability, for it is what Death do best. For the child may even free them from these millennia of apathy and the Queen of Darkest Spring shall become Persephone again, Once and for All.",

    "text": "\"Good morning, sunshine. It's time to get this day started.\"The golden haired woman groaned softly and threw an arm over her eyes. She threw a pillow at the man who had awoken her.\"Go away, Apollo. It's far too early to be awake.\"\"Early? Aurora, are you feeling well? I mean, this is kind of what we do. You bring forth the new day, and I come right after with the big ball of fire. Move your bones, girl.\" Apollo shook her roughly.She moaned and sat up on her couch, tossing the sheet to the floor. A satyr hurried across the room to pick it up and folded it. Another handed her a hand towel and stood before her with a basin. Aurora dipped the cloth and wiped her face. Standing, she stretched forth her arms and yawned.Apollo averted his face.\"Sweetheart, you're naked.\"\"Oh, I'm sorry. Is the god of the sun, who's undone more girdles than Zeus himself, embarrassed by a little nudity?\" Aurora snarked at him.\"No, it's just, you know, you're my friend.\"\"Friend, yeah, sure. Friends don't wake each other so horribly early. It's like 4 in the morning. Dawn doesn't start for another hour.\" She waved her hand over herself.There was a golden sparkle, and she stood wearing a chiton and cloak of pale gold, pinks, reds, and peach.\"Alright, I'm awake and dressed. Shall we move on?\" Apollo clasped her on the shoulder, grinning, and together they strode from the pavilion.The stables were an oasis of noise as grooms scrambled around leading horses to two different chariots. One was pure gold. The other was carved white ivory. Both depicted scenes of the sun: One engraved with the noonday sun overlooking busy life scenes, and the other was inscribed with the dawning sun overlooking the tranquil scenes of the early hours.\"Holy Tartarus, why is it so loud in here?\" Aurora held a palm up to her head. \"Why must horses be so freakin' loud?\"Apollo flicked his hand and silence descended over everything, though nothing stopped hurrying about with its work. A new man came striding in just as Apollo's spell fell.\"Aurora having another hard morning?\" he chuckled in a deep, rich baritone. It filled the silence and made even the frantically working stable hands feel a heavy weariness in their bones.\"Hypnos!\" Apollo high-fived the newcomer. \"You know that she is. Spends all night partying with the Charities, and she can't be bothered to do anything in the morning. Are you just getting in, man?\"\"Oh, yeah,\" Hypnos answered. \"Long night for Morpheus and I - not even the poets and artists wanted to stay awake tonight. Only place we didn't have to stop by was Troy; the Greeks started their opening volleys around sunset. Take a look as you go over. You can't miss it. There's fire everywhere.\"A stable hand came over, motioning with his hands. When that failed to gain the attention of the gods, he resorted to tugging on Aurora's cloak.\"What the...\" she sputtered spinning around. \"What impertinence do you think you are....oh, right.\" She waved her hand and sound once again filled the stable.The stable hand managed to squeak out, \"Your chariot is ready, my Lady.\"She tossed her hair at him in dismal.\"That's my cue to leave you two,\" Hypnos told them. \"I'm off to bed. Don't forget to check out Troy.\"\"We won't,\" Apollo called after him as he left. Apollo was already in his chariot, reigns in hand. \"I enjoy a nice bonfire in the morning.\"\"It's because you're an utter barbarian.\" Aurora told him as she climbed into her own chariot. Another satyr handed her the reigns.The sound of Apollo's laughter followed her as she raced her chariot through the open stable gates and dropped through down into a cold starry night. There was no sign of the stables or Apollo before her. She hung in the air, chariot and horses all motionless. She spread out her hands and began intoning.\"Sten arkhe, o Theos eipe, << Genetheto phos >>, kai uperkhe phos.\" The words fell from her lips like clouds.Behind her, the first rays of morning began to shine. Her voice deepened, her hands and arms grew more taunt and straight, and still the words continued to pour forth. The horizon began to glow brighter, and colors filled the sky. Each color complimented the ones on her chiton perfectly. Slowly the sun peeked its head over the horizon and filled the sky with quiet assurance. Birds begin to chirrup all around.\"Good job, cuz.\" Apollo had appeared in his chariot behind her. \"You only forgot one line.\"She jumped and spooked her horses. She battled to bring them back under control. Spinning on her heel, she turned to face Apollo.\"I don't forget lines, cousin. My recitations are always flawless.\"\"Oh, yeah? The partying is getting to you, darling. Look down.\"She did and her jaw dropped. Everything was gently illuminated by the light of the rising sun. It would have been beautiful except....\"Black and white?!\" she shrieked. \"Mother...Hera!\"She literally started to fume as she spun back around to restart her chanting.Apollo's laughter filled the monochromatic world.",

It baffles the human mortal doctors when he goes to them (he used to go for a laugh- to see the the looks on their faces when they realize that his bones are coral, and his blood samples are just salt water. He's not laughing at this. Not anymore.) It's not like he could go any of the other Gods to help him from his suffering. Those that remain, if whole and left unaffected, have long since fled from Olympus. He can't go to Apollo for help- he's too busy being driven mad by the sound of songbirds- of whispers of the damned and the doomed and pleading and cursed that he's ignored for so long. Burned up from the inside out. They're all dying in some way or other. Some in more obvious ways. Athena has been coughing up spiders; clutches hatching under her skin- egg sacks blocking up her lungs as the newly hatched scuttle their ways out of her throat and nose. Dionysus is drying up, and Demeter is turning into her beloved Earth- stretched out and stretched thin like a tarp. Hera is gone, adrift in the wind. There is no hospitality for the Queen of Olympus. Hestia has no memories. She toils, wasting away in the mortal plane. It is a kindness. Or is it? For her, no more burden (she was always the kindest); or for them- so they are no more reminded of their coming demise? (By far, hers is one of the kinder fates). Artemis has become feral (by choice or by force), perhaps in response to the fate of her twin or perhaps in some twisted mirror- both of them present in body, yet broken in mind. She no longer remembers human speech and strikes out against contact. Is it worse when half of them don't remember, are already gone-- and the rest of them are forced to watch them all fade agonizingly slow? They are being cursed by their very elements and all those they've wronged. And they've wronged so many people throughout the millennia. They go out in many ways. Like the Christian ushers of Death. Like the Egyptian Gods and their proclamations and sabotage and permanent solutions to temporary problems. Like the Norse Gods proclaimed solemn oath of endings. This is no laughing matter- then why can he not stop? They all laugh without malice- because no matter from the inside or out- nor the faith- they are. They persist. They have persisted; they consist. They are all as helpless as their fellow \"gods\". And Poseidon is paralyzed; drowning from the inside when his lungs finally stop working and succumb to being filled with fluid. He has been blessed with immortality for so long- he remembers when the Titans thundered upon the Earth- it burns to be forced to die in such a slow, agonizing way, the worst of all ways to disappear. To die as if a mortal! That's what really gets to him. He can't die with his dignity. He can't die with it-- only after it's gone. \"It's like you're being turned to stone\" one befuddled and horrified doctor admits, frowning at her clipboard. She adjusts her hijab and drums her fingers and is bemusedly stumped, but she is open. Honest. The best in her field. He has dreams of snakes with lovely eyes. He sighs, \"I know\" he says, \"I am\". Poseidon is dying a mortal death, and this is the most terrified he has ever been. Somewhere in the distance, Medusa is hissing with laughter as she pauses in her study from a mountainside, looking at the strata and conglomerates and layers of history that she is far older than.",

    "text": "I wish I could see Aslan crown the Pevensies on that day, Could watch the Ring destroyed and Middle-earth battle in the fray, Could see Halt's rangers shoot, or with Earendil sail the seas, Or read the Scriptures and, in reading, live their histories. Amid the world's destruction watch and cheer Avengers on, Amid her English life with Elinor Dashwood get along. I'd with Odysseus sail, in France would watch Sir Percy's back, With Hector Horse-tamer mourn ruin of Troy and city's sack. I'd Fabius Maximus join in plotting Roman victory, With Armstrong walk the moon, move West with Ingalls family, See arrow split by Robin, Ivanhoe's great trial fight, With Peter Parker crawl the walls of New York City's night. Sir Percivale I'd join to fight temptation's thoughts impure, With Luke I'd blast the Death Star and resist the Dark Side's lure, Be one who learns at Euclid's feet or Hogwarts School attends, In Houston solve the problems that Apollo Thirteen sends. On Captain Sully's plane the icy Hudson I'd survive, I'd watch Valjean's redemption as he leaves Javert alive, Fight Nazis with Von Trapps, Rick Blaine, or Indiana Jones, I'd spell \"Anne\" with an \"e;\" I'd recognize the marlin's bones. I'd hear great Chiron's wisdom and to Finrod's measure it, I'd face the Alamo's fall, investigate with Wimsey's wit. With Aravis I'd flee, help Reynie Muldoon problem-solve, Praise Obi-Wan's Soresu as he fights with calm resolve. For Balder's death I'd weep, with Spartans hold Thermopylae, Mulan I'd help disguise to fight and save her family. I'd Alfred's Saxons join to drive the Northmen from the land; On Gotham City's peak with Batman sentinel I'd stand. At Roonwit's side I'd kneel, with Lewis and Clark explore the West, With Colonel Joshua Chamberlain fight yet mourn the day's unrest. St. George see kill his dragon, Perseus commence his fights, I'd cheer the strength and justice of King Arthur and his knights. But though I cannot live within these stories that I know, I'll love them for their goodness, beauty, and the truth they show. Expecting a poem you probably were; I apologize for this instead,But in case you care here's explanations of the first chapter's poem you read. Aslan crowning the Pevensies: C. S. Lewis's The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe; after the defeat of the Witch and the end of the Winter, Aslan, the Great Lion, crowns Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy Pevensie as Kings and Queens under Him in Narnia. Middle-earth's battle and the Ring's destruction: J. R. R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings; the One Ring is destroyed, the Dark Lord thrown down, and the Free Peoples of Middle-earth hold the field. Halt's rangers: John Flanagan's Ranger's Apprentice series (technically it should be \"Crowley's rangers\" or even \"Duncan's rangers,\" but I thought Halt was more recognizable and distinctive). They protect and serve the kingdom. Earendil: Tolkien's Silmarillion; Earendil saves Middle-earth by sailing to the Blessed Realm to beg the Powers to lift their doom and help the Elves and Men against the Dark Lord; now he sails the sky as the Evening Star. Scriptures: All of them. Except perhaps Judah and Tamar. And Lot and his daughters. And Jehu (right, Miss Natasha Rostova?). Avengers saving the world: Marvel's Cinematic Universe, specifically, since I haven't read the comics. (Side note: how many times now has the world almost been destroyed? I've lost count...) Elinor Dashwood's English life: Jane Austen's Sense and Sensibility; Elinor vies with Anne Elliot of Persuasion as the Austen Novel Heroine to whom I can most relate. Odysseus: Homer's Odyssey. The poor guy just couldn't get home. Sir Percy in France: Baroness Orczy's Scarlet Pimpernel, or even more so the 1982 Anthony Andrews movie. He rescues French aristocrats from the guillotine during the Reign of Terror. Hector and the ruin of Troy: Homer's Iliad, etc. Technically he was dead before the city fell, but he would've mourned it, at any rate. And I'm pretty sure he knew it was doomed from the start. Fabius Maximus plotting Roman victory: Recorded in Livy, Quintus Fabius Maximus was a Roman general during the Second Punic War fighting against Hannibal. His defensive maneuvers and tactical retreats were brilliant but underappreciated in his own time. Armstrong walking the moon: Neil Armstrong was the first man to step onto the moon on July 20, 1969. Ingalls family: Laura Ingalls Wilder's Little House series. They move west. Robin splitting an arrow: Robin Hood legends, and the 1938 Errol Flynn movie. Ivanhoe's fight: Sir Walter Scott's Ivanhoe, and the 1982 Anthony Andrews movie. Calling the fight \"great\" might be laughable, since Ivanhoe was barely recovered from a wound to even participate, but he saved Rebecca's life despite that. Peter Parker: aka Spider Man, specifically in the Tobey Maguire movies, or, more recently, the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Sir Percivale fighting temptation: King Arthur legends, specifically from Sir Thomas Malory's Le Morte d'Artur. He has to resist the advances of a sorceress while on the Quest of the Holy Grail. Luke's death-star-blasting and dark-side-resisting: Luke Skywalker, Star Wars the Original Trilogy. Euclid: Ancient Greek mathematician and the Father of Geometry. Hogwarts School: of Witchcraft and Wizardry, from J. K. Rowling's Harry Potter series, as I expect you already knew. Houston and Apollo 13: Often referred to as NASA's \"successful failure,\" the mission was unable to land on the moon but the combined skills of the astronauts themselves and the engineers back at Mission Control in Houston brought them home safely. I'm especially thinking of the 1995 Tom Hanks movie. (Origin of the phrase \"Houston, we have a problem.\") Captain Sully and the Hudson: On January 15, 2009 Captain Chesley Sullenberger successfully landed US Airways Flight 1549 in the Hudson River after a double-engine loss due to bird strike. The story was most recently brought to my attention by the 2016 Clint Eastwood-directed Tom Hanks film Sully. Valjean and Javert: From Les Miserables, particularly the Broadway musical or 2012 musical drama film. (I haven't read Hugo's original novel, but my sister Miss Natasha did and assured me that everything in the movie happened in the book--there's just more in the book.) In any case, Valjean is redeemed through mercy, and, in the spirit of this mercy, spares the life of Javert, his pursuer. Von Trapps: Family from the Sound of Music that flees Austria rather than submit to Nazi rule. Rick Blaine: Protagonist from 1942 film Casablanca who at first seems a cold-hearted capitalist but actually smuggles people away from the Nazis. Indiana Jones: Titular character of four movies starring Harrison Ford who hunts down artifacts from all over the world and usually ends up fighting oppression and Nazis, while he's at it. Chiron: He was a (the only...) good Centaur of Greek mythology. Known for his wisdom, he taught such illustrious figures as Achilles, Theseus, and Perseus. Finrod: Tolkien's Silmarillion; King Finrod Felagund of Nargothrond was the wisest, fairest, and most beloved of the High Elves in Middle-earth (incidentally, also Galadriel's brother). The Alamo's fall: It fell in 1836, defended by James Bowie and Davy Crockett fighting for Texas independence. Wimsey's wit: Lord Peter Wimsey of Dorothy Sayers's detective novels. Aravis fleeing: Lewis's The Horse and His Boy; she flees wicked Calormen, comes to Narnia, and learns of Aslan. Reynie Muldoon's problem-solving: Trenton Lee Stewart's The Mysterious Benedict Society; Reynie is the unofficial leader of the society and very good at solving riddles and coming up with plans. Obi-Wan's Soresu: Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi of the Star Wars Prequel Trilogy; according to Extraneous Material That I Have Not Read And Thus Only Know Second-Hand, Soresu is the all-defensive form of lightsaber combat that Obi-Wan takes up (and becomes the master of) after his master Qui-Gon Jinn's death. Balder's death: In Norse mythology Balder, the god of forgiveness, light, and justice, is killed by Loki's treachery. Hel, the goddess of death, agrees to return him to life only if everything in all the realms weeps for his death. Loki doesn't and so denies Balder his resurrection. Spartans at Thermopylae: The Spartans (and some oft-forgotten Thespians and Thebans) held off the Persian forces long enough for the rest of Greece to organize its defense. Mulan saving her family: Any of the legends, or the Disney movie. She goes to war so her elderly father won't die on the battlefields. Alfred's Saxons and the Northmen: Alfred the Great was the king of Wessex in the 800s who defended what would later become England from the invading Norse Vikings. I first fell in love with his story in G. A. Henty's The Dragon and the Raven. Batman as Gotham City's sentinel: Comic book figure of legend, Bruce Wayne as Gotham City's protector and Dark Knight from either the comics themselves, various cartoon interpretations, or Christopher Nolan's great live-action film trilogy. Roonwit: Lewis's The Last Battle; Roonwit is a centaur who dies for king and country. (Final quote: \"All worlds draw to an end, and a noble death is a treasure that no one is too poor to buy.\") Lewis and Clark: The great expedition through the Louisiana Purchase to the Pacific Ocean. I came to appreciate it fully through Steven Ambrose's Undaunted Courage. Colonel Joshua Chamberlain: Held the far left of the Union line in the Battle of Gettysburg and secured that victory. He always led from the front and was several times wounded, was Grant's first ever field promotion (to General) and saluted the defeated Confederate forces when he received their arms and colors after the surrender. St. George's dragon: He killed it, freed the city, and rescued the princess. Perseus' fights: He had a lot of them, including killing Medusa and rescuing Andromeda. King Arthur and his knights: Specifically as described in Alfred Lord Tennyson's Idylls of the King. Truth, goodness, and beauty: The three \"absolutes\" in the world, and gifts of God.",

    "text": "Prince Theseus, Athens' most heroic son, stood silently at the prow of a ship, the midday sun warming his broad golden shoulders as he looked out across the sea towards his destiny, lying in wait on the island ahead. Fathered by both king Aegeus and the god Poseidon, who had both lain with his mother Aethra on the same night, a mix of mortal and divine seeds flowed hot in the young man's veins. All in Athens, men and women alike, admired him as much for the beauty of his form as for his bravery as a warrior. Taller than any man in Attica, shoulder-length brown hair flowed in soft curtains that cast shadows over his fiercely strong face, emerald-green eyes, chiseled cheekbones and angular jaw that would alone have made him the apex of masculine beauty. But he possessed all the physical virtues a warrior could have. A broad, near-hairless chest, brown-nippled and swelling with strength upon every breath, lifted full and high above a wasp-waist, crammed to bursting with a dizzying formation of tight fatless muscles. They plunged down his stomach, all leading the eye to one place, that slightest of calfskin garments laced low on his hips and bulging proudly, straining from the burden of the demi-god's heavy, fecund loins. At the rear, it barely covered half of his two full, square buttocks, firmly commanding his herculean legs. Leather bindings criss-crossed his toned calves all the way to the knees, holding in place the sandals that had not left his feet these five days. Not since leaving Athens. Athens...the very city the god-spawned hero was on this journey to defend. The great power of the Greek world was Crete, who's king, Minos, had years earlier sent his son Androgeus to take part in the Athenian games. Being strong and skilled, Androgeus had excelled, winning the hearts of the masses...and the jealousy of the Phallantides, Theseus' power-hungry cousins. Filled with resentment, they had murdered Androgeus in the night, leaving the enraged King Minos to fall upon Athens with his mighty army by sea. King Aegeus had no choice but to surrender the city, and when the killers could not be found, Minos instead set out terms upon which Athens would be spared. Every seven years, seven young men of city's noble families were to be collected by boat and taken to Crete. All were to be given as sacrifices to the creature the very name of which made most Greek's blood run cold, and whose origin was a dark mirror of Theseus' own... The Minotaur. After ascending to the throne of Crete, Minos had prayed to Poseidon to send him a snow-white bull as a sign of the god's support, promising to slaughter it in the god's honor at a grand festival in Knossos, the capital. Instead, Minos, so enraptured by its elegance and strength, chose to keep it as a symbol of his own power, sacrificing instead one of his own bulls. Enraged at the insult, Poseidon had the goddess Aphrodite cast a spell on his queen Pasiphae, who fell madly in lust with the divine animal. She in turn had the great genius Daedalus make a hollow wooden cow, and climbed within it to join with the living idol. Thus the monstrous Minotaur, its true name known only to the royal family, was spawned. Being the cursed offspring of man and beast, part mortal, and part divine, it quickly grew to become wild and ferocious, so after consulting the oracle at Delphi, Minos had Daedalus construct a huge maze to hold it. Years had passed since those events and now the third time of atonement had arrived. Knowing that under Minos' peace terms only the death of the creature would end the sacrifices, Theseus had volunteered to go as one of the seven, determined over the objections of his father to slay the beast and rid Athens of its horned foe forever. He looked back over his shoulder at his athletic companions, all milling about the deck as lines of Cretan oarsmen powered them towards the beach. The ship's keel slid softly onto the sand, her tanned crew drawing in the black sail while others threw fixing ropes to men on the tideline. Knowing his weaponry had already been smuggled in by trusted traders, he and the rest headed inland in a train of horses, the dry dirt road winding its way towards the capital. Crowds of curious villagers and townsfolk lined the route, staring pitilessly at the men who would be at the very heart of the upcoming celebrations. Soon enough they were upon it. Knossos. The cities' tightly-packed mass of square, white, mud brick dwellings rose in a disorganised mass towards the imposing sight of the royal palace beyond. Sitting high on a hill, it's brightly coloured, flat-roofed wings with their blood-red columns glowed in the afternoon sun. Theseus was expecting the massed throngs of the city to meet them with contempt when they entered, but instead it seemed a carnival atmosphere had enveloped all. Rose petals rained down on them from the rooftops, and crowds danced and cheered to pipe music. Maidens threw flower garlands over the heads of the Athenians and their horses as if they were returning heroes. But of course, Theseus knew the truth of it. They were merely prize cattle being led for slaughter: the very best gifts Crete could offer Poseidon to arrest his rage. Through the ecstatic throngs they pushed, all the way to the royal residence. Alighting from their horses, they climbed the guarded steps to its imposing entrance. Two enormous marble bulls flanked the gateway, each as black as jet, reminding those who entered of the true source of this kingdom's power. Within lay a vast open courtyard, its fringes shaded by a rainbow of silken awnings, protecting the elaborately dressed elites seated beneath from the scorching rays. The Cretan aristocrat looked towards the approaching Athenians, their faces a wall of superior distain. Theseus felt a moment of panicked realisation. Some of these men would surely have visited the Greek games, seen him compete there, and might recognise him. He hurriedly drew as much of his brown curtains over his face as he could and aimed his gaze at the ground, hoping the heavy shadows cast by the lowering sun would help disguise his heroic features. Every eye followed the athletic, scantily-clad men as they walked the spearman-flanked path to the royal box, lining up before the island's enthroned lord. King Minos, the most powerful man in the Greek world, sat gripping the bull-headed armrests of his golden throne, a spiked silver crown resting on his curling grey hair. This was the last person from whom a warm welcome would come. His cold, unwavering stare cut straight through the warriors, only breaking away when a young man ahead of him rose from his stool. It was Ariadeus, the king's youngest son, recently come of age and made high priest of the bull cult. His hands and face rose dramatically to the heavens, the sleeves of his crimson cowl sliding back as he readied himself to invoke loudly. \"Mighty Poseidon! Lord of the wine-dark sea! Guardian of our shores! We offer these! The spoils of war!\" he exclaimed, his arms lowering towards the Athenians. \"Heroes of men! Soldiers of the sword! Tomorrow we send them to your mighty son!\" With that, the gathered gentry of Crete burst from their seats and erupted into cheering, hailing the men's arrival and the protection their ghastly demise would soon earn them. Ariadeus stepped forward, followed swiftly by more robed cult members, who surrounded the Greeks before guiding them to rooms in the palace built solely to ready the offerings for their entrance into the maze. One man would be sent in each day for the next week, with the first to enter the following noon. Throughout the evening they were prepared by the hooded priests with incense burning and countless incantations, their bodies bathed in oil and the symbol of Crete, the double-axe head, daubed upon their chests. Ariadeus stood watching, his probing eyes never leaving Theseus as a thick horse hair brush spread yellow saffron paint across his Titan-like pectorals. He suspects. Theseus was certain of it. Now he had to get to the labyrinth as soon as he could, before his presence was revealed to the king. But he would find no opportunity to do so. Too soon, the time for their final night's sleep came, and each were led to their own rooms, only a cold stone altar within each to serve as a bed. Theseus lay down under the watchful gaze of priests and guards, who chained his wrists and ankles, guaranteeing no last-minute flight of their precious human carrion. Half an hour passed, with Theseus' bulging arms testing the manacles several times, but to no avail. He seemed doomed. Surely it wouldn't be long now before the King's soldiers burst in and took his life. As that very thought crossed his mind, the heavy door beyond his feet creaked. Flickering yellow rays burst through the gap as it opened, he assumed to be followed by an enraged hoard of spearmen. But instead, only a single hooded figure appeared. He stood silently in the doorway for a moment, oil lamp in hand, letting its gentle light pour down on the shackled hero's glowing skin. Carefully sealing the door behind him, he paced forward slowly, coming to a halt next to the Athenian's strong but troubled face. Placing the lamp on the alter next to him, he lifted the hood of his cowl. It was Ariadeus. The callow young prince's chestnut eyes stared down at him, his soft, elegant features and flowing blond locks catching the lamplight. His expression, though far from murderous or disdainful, seemed mild and unreadable to the prince. He would soon explain however, that he had a use in mind for Theseus that was far more benign than his father's. On first seeing Theseus in the courtyard, Ariadeus had known him to be above normal men. His demi-god nature shone from him in a way only a priest could see. In that moment, he felt as if he too had been sent a gift by Poseidon, just as his father had, and likewise recoiled at the thought of sacrificing such divine magnificence to the monstrous half-brother he kept fed and watered within the maze. It seemed almost sacrilege, but he had kept it to himself, wise enough to hide his true feelings behind public spectacle. \"You know who I am,\" Theseus stated quietly in an accepting tone, raising a slight smile from the Cretan prince. \"Of course. It was obvious to me. I've heard many stories of your strength and heroism Theseus...and of your beauty.\" A hand rested softly upon the Athenian's mighty chest. \"And I believe I can also guess at your purpose here. You have not come simply to wonder the maze unarmed and be devoured like the others\". He reasoned, feeling the slow strong beat of his mighty heart under the broad plate of muscle. His other hand lingered softly on the Athenian's rippling stomach. \"I have an offer for you, one I hope may satisfy both our needs...\" came his suggestive tones, a single fingertip toying gently with the rim of Theseus' naval. \"I will free you and your compatriots, and help you in your dealings with the Minotaur, for one wish in return.\" Theseus looked at him with a serious stare. \"Name your price,\" He asked, expecting it to be high. The young priest's toying expression suddenly dropped away. \"Poseidon still distains the king. He has not forgiven him for his slight. The sacrifices only stay his trident. After all these years, my father has grown bitter and resentful at the rejection. This palace is now a place of misery and fear, not somewhere any sane man would choose to remain. And besides, the thought of sending innocent men to their deaths to pay for my father's folly holds no joy for me.\" Theseus could see genuine revulsion in the young man's eyes at the very thought of it. \"Carry me away from this place,\" he asked, half pleading, half demanding. \"That is all?\" the hero asked, surprised for a moment by the simplicity of the nodding prince's request, until his mind had fully realised the implications of carrying out his wish. \"But wait, what of Poseidon? Surely he would be even more enraged if one of his own priests liberating gifts meant for him. His waves would dash us on the rocks the moment we took sail.\" It was a simple truth, but one which the young man had already considered. \"Ah, but we would have a guarantor of our safety on-board, would we not? I doubt he would choose to sink a ship carrying the fruit of his own loins.\" The Athenian's jaw muscles flexed under his high cheekbones. \"It seems you know a great deal more about me than most men.\" \"Oh, we priests hold many secrets. So, what of my offer...demi-god?\" Ariadeus challenged. \"Well, it seems I am in no position to refuse,\" Theseus retorted, smiling slightly as he rattled his chains. \"You have my word\". With that, the young high-priest moved to free him from his bondage, and after sitting up and making a few sore stretches of his unshackled limbs, both made for the door. As his fingers grasped the handle, a gentle hand took hold of the hero's thick wrist. \"Wait...There is one more price...\" he whispered to the warrior, whose eyebrow rose a little, questioningly. \"I desire to know the taste of you, if only once. Think if it as a small...offering.\" He leaning up to the taller man's face and placing on his mouth a careful, soft kiss. Theseus, being a Greek warrior, was no stranger to the love of other men, and accepted the beautiful young prince's terms with ease, running a strong hand up his back and the other into his golden hair, enveloping his soft, succulent lips in a passionate, full-bodied kiss. With the second price paid in full, the two quietly freed Theseus' comrades from their cells and told them of his new plans. Once Ariadeus had led him to the maze, the young prince would return and slip them out of the palace to the coast were they would steal a ship and wait for Theseus. With everything made clear, they parted, he and his new companion slipping through the corridors and precincts of the palace like ghosts, coming eventually to a balcony at its rear. There, bathed in moonlight, lay the Labyrinth. As large as the city it sat behind, its towering outer-wall encircled a tangled web of masonry, within which already lay the bones of fourteen innocent Athenians. Theseus clenched his jaw, determined they would be the last. Ariadeus handed him a ball of string, instructing him on how it would aide in his escape from the maze, before providing one last sacred piece of knowledge. \"Asterion...the creature's true name. Look it in the eyes, speak it, and it will be yours.\" Theseus bade him farewell with another kiss and slipped down a winding creeper to the ground. Knowing exactly where the traders had hidden his weapons, he fished them free from the dense ornamental bushes flanking the high walls of the maze. Onto his waist went his sword belt, and he slipped the broad, round shield over his left forearm. Pushing his tightly-fitting bronze helmet down over his face, he jogged forward, its red horsehair crest catching the light of the two flaming torches which framed the towering doors to the Labyrinth. After pulling back the huge bolt, which seemed made more for a giant's hands, he lifted one torch from its fixing, and yanked with his whole body weight on one of the door's enormous ringed handles. A low groan issued from its hinges as it reluctantly swung open, just enough for the athletic Greek to slip through. Knotting the end of his ball of twine to the other ring, he stepped inside. Theseus paused just inside the threshold for a moment, his breath condensing in the cold, still atmosphere, before striding forward to meet the fate the gods had prepared for him. With the starry sky above serving as a ceiling to the roofless maze, moonbeams poured down onto the cracked and weed-strewn slabs beneath his sandals. Yellow light from the hero's torch flickered against the walls, making the limbs of half-dead vines cast long sinister shadows into the darkness ahead. He knew from Ariadeus that the creature resided at the very core of the sprawling warren, and that his best chance of defeating it was to surprise it whilst it slept. As his path twisted and turned through the uneven corridors, the ball of string span wildly in his palm, the yarn spitting out from between two of his fingers. Even with the high-priest's guidance, navigating the Labyrinth was proving a near-impossible task for the muscular hero. Dead-ends and looping passages burned precious time, with the demi-god more than once coming upon the string he had lain behind himself. Having lost an hour to the genius of Daedalus' design, a frustrated Theseus decided instead to make use of his brawn to assist his passage. Finding another thick-stemmed vine, he lay down his shield and torch and began to climb. From the wall's top he would surely be able to see the true route to the centre. Although his logic was good, Theseus had assumed the masonry of the maze to be as sound as its confusing design. But it was not so. As he continued to scramble up the woody, overlapping limbs, the plant's anchors loosened from their fixings, unable to carry the hero's flexing bulk. Dry mortar spilling onto his shoulders gave warning of what was to come. He looked up, his eyes widening in panic, as great blocks of stone started heaving and grinding against each other near the top of the wall. Their corners flaked and cracked, their strength destroyed by years of rain and sun, sending a hail of grit down onto the now rapidly descending warrior. Leaves streaked a green slime onto his palms has he slid downwards with incredible speed, and just as his sandal touched the floor, the first mighty block took flight. Theseus dived away, with it missing his head by a hairs-breadth and shattering with a heavy thud. More followed, with the hero rolling out of harms-way as they tumbled in a pile onto the broken pavement with a ground-shaking rumble. A pall of dust washed out from the uneven mound of rubble, its heavy particles falling like snow on the hero's bare musculature as he surveyed the gaping breach from which the rocks had poured. Brushing the dry grains from his biceps as he stood, a deflated Theseus cursed his bad fortune, wondering if perhaps his father had been wiser in trying to stop him. This self-doubt however would soon be shocked from the Greek's thoughts. A blood-chilling sound washed over the Labyrinth, its note deep and uneven, with the unmistakable roughness of a bovine throat. The Minotaur had awoken, stirred by the noise of the collapse, and was sure to begin at any moment searching out the disturbance in its realm. Theseus scrambled for his shield and torch, his eyes darting between the dark passageways that suddenly seemed to be all around him. His first instinct was to run, but his years of training soon tamed that impulse. His accident had provided him with an opportunity. The beast would come to him now. All he need do was find the right spot from which to strike, but first he would leave a small distraction to draw its curiosity. Scaling the small hill of rubble, Theseus planted his torch upright in its summit. Its fire shone like a beacon as its owner now slid his sword free from its scabbard and slinked off to watch from a shadowy corner a dozen paces away. Tense minutes passed by with aching slowness for the Greek, whose clammy palm played nervously with the leathered grip of his weapon. With his eyes fixed on the dancing flame ahead, his mind swam in the vast library of useful memories amassed facing countless other foes. Not to mention day after day of sweat-drenched training. All the back-breaking trails and tests. The mock sword fights and wrestling matches. All of it giving him the statue-like frame of a Titan and skills as sharp as the blade in his hand. He would need all of them to defeat this latest enemy, one who's heavy hoof-falls had just come in range of the hero's ears. Grip tightening, goosebumps washed over his sun-soaked skin as the stone-scraping thuds grew louder, echoing around him. A huge horned shadow grew across the floor ahead from a side passage, climbing the rubble mound as its owner cautiously neared. Finally, it strode into view. The Minotaur. Confused and surprised, Theseus looked at the beast stood in profile before him. What he could see of it in the dim light seemed nothing like the hideous, malformed image a lifetime of stories had placed in his imagination. As tall as a rearing horse, long black horns curled lyre-like towards the sky from its wide, angular head, and a dense layer of short, milk-white hairs covered its entire colossal body, growing longer over its fore-arms and double-jointed legs. The broad, towering frame was awash with beef, every hefty muscle swelling proudly from its anchorage with perfect, statuesque definition. Far from being repulsive, it was magnificent. Man and bull perfectly blended into a single god-like being. Reminded of his purpose by heavy club it carried with it, Theseus' admiration of its aesthetic qualities quickly gave way to more pressing tactical matters. The curious but wary Minotaur reached for the burning torch, its long, tuft-tipped tail dancing nervously in the air as it's thick fingers slid around the wood. This was the moment. With the creature turning its back on him, and its attention focused fully on the flame, Theseus could strike. Just as the beast grasped the torch and started pulling it free from the rubble, the Greek burst from his hiding place, shooting like lightening across the space between them. He leapt upwards as he neared it, planning to bring his sword down hard behind its collarbone to kill it with a single thrust, but it was not to be. As Theseus sailed through the air, the Minotaur sensed the danger, instinctively swinging the roughly-carved club in its other hand. It glanced off the top of the Athenian's shield, struck the side of his helmet, and sent him cartwheeling towards a side wall. His sword flew from his grasp, planting itself tip-first in the rubble pile while he tumbled with a heavy thud onto the cracked pavement, landing in a sitting position against the wall with his dented headpiece rolling around beside him. Dazed, his limbs moved sluggishly as he tried to rouse himself, the edge of his shield scraping the stone floor as a massive silhouette moved over him. Torch in one hand, club in the other, the snorting Minotaur filled his blurry vision. Squatting down, the thick golden ring in its pale pink snout glinted as it moved close to the groggy hero. A hot breath blasted from its nostrils, issuing in two waves of steam over Theseus' handsome, unprotected face. The heavy cloud seemed to search out his mouth and nose, flowing into him as if alive. An unnatural heat carried with it, filling his insides with a strange, furnace-like burning strong enough to drag the dizzy warrior back to his senses. His cleared sight was met by two fierce glowing red eyes, dripping more with instinct than thought, burning purposefully into the Greek's own. For a few moments, Theseus could not look away. It was as if a spell had fallen over him. Its piercing animal gaze seemed to cut to his very soul. But his will was still strong, and he managed to shake his mind free, enough sharpness now returned for him to lash out defensively with his battered shield, knocking the torch from the Minotaur's hand and sending it stumbling backwards over one of the broken stones. Springing to his feet, he shot past the surprised beast and over the rubble mound, snatching up his sword and dashing through the breach in the wall. An enraged roar filled the maze as he sprinted away, followed fast by heavy, quickening hoof-falls behind him. His shapely legs became a blur, carrying him away through bends and turns of the maze for a far greater distance than the hero had truly intended. He had only wanted to put a few moments of time between him and the monster, enough to prepare for the fight, yet he was still running. Eventually he forced himself to a stop. His broad chest heaved as he slumped back against the masonry of the Labyrinth, trying to fathom his actions. Something has spurred him on. He felt as if he had been running from more than just the Minotaur. With his breath slowing, growing awareness of other sensations countered his exhaustion. They pulled his eyes down over his own form, to take in the sight of his erect brown nipples, there thick nubs standing-out proudly from his sweat-beaded pectorals. The skin there felt tighter than it had ever been before, the pinching enough to have drawn his gaze. He could have dismissed this as caused merely by the chill of the air on his perfect skin, or the thrill of a life-or-death chase, were it not for the stirring of another part of his godly form. Further down, his engorging manhood pushed against the calfskin that held it, filling out the soft vellum until its tip had pushed all the way across to his left hip. \"By the gods...\" Shocked, Theseus' breath shuddered in confusion and he pushing at the bulge with his free hand, as if trying to send away the organ for its unwanted behavior. But this did nothing to abate it, in fact, the rejection seemed only to make it grow harder, its swelling crown fighting against the prison holding it back. He tried to lift his hand away, but it refused his commands. Every heartbeat sent another wave of growth along the pillar, and Theseus found himself fighting a growing need to free it. To have it in his grasp. To stroke it. Unknown to the warrior prince, the cause of his unnatural arousal was the very creature now searching him out in its vast domain. For the Minotaur did devour men, but not in the manner all the world believed. It was a secret only a handful knew, and unfortunately for Theseus, young Ariadeus was not one of them. A ravenous lust had consumed the beast from the moment it came of age, a lust that had been first meted out on a few unlucky palace guards. It was their embarrassed, half-told stories that had been misunderstood by so many eager ears, spun into tales of a horned monster that ate man-flesh. It would break any chain to sate its thirst, and as it matured, only the strongest and most durable men had the strength to satisfy it for any amount of time, so the Labyrinth and the Athenian tribute proved the perfect solution. Possessed of the seductive potency of its beast father, each man who had entered the maze had been quickly ensnared, only a single wisp of its hot breath on their tongues needed to empty their minds of all worldly concerns and have them surrender willingly to its raw animal need. An endless sexual frenzy had followed for each. Year upon year of unrestrained, unending coupling ravaging their bodies until one after the other they gave way under the sheer strain. The labyrinth was a prison for man as much as beast, and the Minotaur's breath spelt ecstasy and death for those who tasted it. Long recovered from his running, Theseus' heart still pounded in his chest. The strength of its beat now maintained by the magic corrupting his mind. Closing his eyes, he rested the back of his head against the wall, letting his shield-covered free hand slide slowly off his groin and up his hardened abdominals to his pectoral shelf. Whispered gasps poured from his mouth with every pull of his nipples, his hand drifting from one to the other to rub the erect nubs hard between finger and thumb. He was sinking into erotic exhaustion, his poisoned instincts robbing his strength. Yet still enough of him remembered its purpose, refusing to release the sword in his hand, even as he rubbed roughly at his throbbing bulge with its pommel. So engrossed was Theseus in kneading his manhood with the rounded metal, that it took a few moments for the heavy trot of approaching hooves to drag him back to his senses. His eyelids parted, and the towering outline of the Minotaur filled his vision once again, standing motionless at the dark exit of a passage. Led by the Greek's vivid scent, its flaming ruby eyes had only to take in his overtaxed garment to know that it had him half-enslaved already. Theseus pushed his sweaty unwilling physique away from the wall with his elbows, the blade shaking in his hand as he raised it to defend himself. So out-of-sorts was he that he had to remind himself to take a defensive posture, bending his knees and lifting his dented shield until only his eyes peered over the rim. The beast stepped forward, a glow filling the space they shared as the moonbeams hit upon its snowy pelt, and then...it simply stopped. Resting the blunt end of its club on the pavement, it stood motionless just beyond the reach of Theseus' sword. \"Ast...Aster...\" He tried to speak its name, but the word would not leave his mouth. Its glare burned through the Greek's skull, somehow commanding his eyes to wander over the rest of its monumental body. With the Minotaur much closer than before, Theseus could see how truly glorious it really was. A streak of brown hair ran from its chin down its thick neck and midline, mirrored by another running up its spine to end in a bushy crest sprouting from the back of its head. Thinner lines of hair flowed off from both, flowing river-like in and around the borders of each mountainous muscle group, defining them still further than their clean edges already did. Full round nipples, of obscene size and matched the pink of its flat, square muzzle, crowned like two hill-top fortresses the thick wide pectorals dominating its torso. Every limb abounded with countless heaving muscles, its shoulders needing immense power simply to lift arms the breadth of Theseus' own waist. Nothing seemed out of place or wrongly-sized to the Greek. Nothing. Even the nails at the ends of its thick, furry white fingers matched the glossy obsidian shade of its horns perfectly. It was a work of divine art. A perfect colossus worthy of worship in a temple. But in truth, his detailed study of the monster's anatomy was now more about preventing his stare from shifting to the one place it should never have wished to go. Theseus exhaled heavily, fighting the inner demon that kept dragging his eyes back down towards that same spot time and again. Eventually, he purposefully planted his stare there, in a feeble attempt to convince himself this was the choice of his higher reasoning, not the beast's dark influence. Two huge, engorged, oval gonads, heavy with semen, hung pendulously between its tree trunk-thick thighs, a tuft of dark hair sprouting from the bottom of the brown-furred sack in which they swayed. Clearly this area of the beast too was as much animal as man, as where Theseus expected to see a long dormant member, instead only a large, fur-covered bulge greeted him, with what must have been a sizeable organ lying behind the slit running down its centre, dormant deep within its master's loins. Green eyes locked with red once again, only this time Theseus stared back with the same unblinking intensity. Vacant-minded, he lifted slowly out of his defensive posture, somehow lost to the moment. His arms lowered, a heavy clang echoing out as the battered shield slipped from his arm. Only one last symbol of his heroic defiance remained. His fingers loosened their grip on his sword, the fear of being unarmed dissolving under the Minotaur's wild hypnosis. It stoked a fire inside him, turning to ashes all other thoughts. His plan. His comrades. Athens. It all drifted into irrelevancy. Sharpened bronze slipped from his grasp, chiming his surrender as it struck the stones beneath. With it dropped monster's own club, rolling from its hand like a freshly-felled tree. Theseus threw himself up into the creature's embrace, gripping its huge shoulders and clamping his hefty legs around its torso. The delicious feeling of hard muscle under soft velvet pelt made his skin itch where ever the two were in contact, and Theseus could only hold himself back for a split second to revel in it before slamming his lips hard against the Minotaur's wet muzzle. His tongue probed desperately, trying to work its way through the two flat rows of clenched teeth inside. They gave way, but not to let him in. A massive slick black tongue poured into the Greek's mouth, while muscular lips slathering the lower part of his face with saliva, sucking at the potent hero hungrily. Not content with just his mouth, the ravenous beast slid it's hands down Theseus' back, cradled his firm full rear, and lifted him up until his chest sat level with its demonic maw. Raised up high, he clung to its horns with both hands, throwing his head back in lust as it consumed the deep cleft between his pectorals. One nipple, then the other, was savagely assaulted, leaving him almost insane with arousal and calling out at the top of his lungs. \"BY THE GODS!!!! YYEEEESSS!!\" Theseus' ecstasy only served to arouse the Minotaur further, stirring into life its own monstrous organ. The slit in its groin bulged outwards, it's taught, furry doors resisting only for a moment the demands of its waking resident to be released. The steaming phallus grew branch-like into the cold air, air now licking Theseus' exposed buttocks as thick hungry fingers tore away his calfskin. The same length as the hero's arm from shoulder to fingertips, the gargantuan member widened from the man-sized crown at its tip, to the width of the prince's thick-chorded neck at its base. Almost with a mind of its own, its upward-curving length flexed manically, searching out the newly-exposed entrance as a thirst-crazed man seeks a well. With the young prince's legs spread wide apart, an open target lay between his tensing glutes. But Theseus knew nothing of it, utterly mesmerised as he was by the huge inviting nipples flanking his face. Gasping, his tongue ran absent-mindedly across his bottom lip as he moved forward, mouth and tongue unfurling to worship the pink, iron-hard nub to his right. It disappeared in the shade of his oral cavity, but before he could lock his lips upon it, a contact made in his deepest recess sent his spine shuddering. The Minotaur's member had found its goal, and its slick, dripping tip had set to work furiously rubbing at the skin around a passage only ever touched by Athens' noble, gymnasium-sculpted sons. Lightning thundered up Theseus' vertebrae, leaving him almost paralysed from the stimulation. All he could do was endure, and that was all he wished to do, grasping and rubbing at the beast's nipples with each hand as he buried his face in its chest. Eyes closed, he groaned deeply into its musky pelt, and could feel its wild heart pounding against his cheek, its drumbeat the harbinger of an approaching invasion. Obeying its master's demands, monstrous phallus finally burst inside. White fur brushed the teeth of Theseus' dark, lust-drenched grin, his eyes rolling under their lids at the ever-deeper, ever-widening penetration. There was no steady width to this titanic phallus, only greater and greater girth, every newly-arrived portion stretching and straining his muscular passage more than the last. Theseus relished it, the monster's magic exciting his own impressive spear until it stood proud and erect in the space between their flexing stomachs. Looking down at it, he swore for a moment that he saw a bulge shift under his eight flexing abdominals. The crown had ventured deep, thrusting its way into the prince's own inner Labyrinth until the full length of the mighty veined column behind had entered and was pushing at his flat, muscled belly from within. With the entire shaft swallowed up, the Minotaur's furry groin kissed the Greek's full flexing cheeks. Still seated in its palms, a ragged Theseus pushed himself up off its chest, locking eyes once more with the creature which had, in the space of only a few minutes, turned from his deadliest enemy, to his welcome sexual tormentor. Another throat-filling kiss ensued, with spit falling in steaming strings from between their fighting mouths. Theseus clung firmly to its heavy trapezius muscles, willing the undulating tongue to push its way down into his very core and meet the mighty throbbing hardness already so far within him. A powerful rumble vibrated from the Minotaur's throat as it sated its thirst, resonating inside the Greek's ribcage and earning a muffled growl in return. Intoxicated with lust, clear pearls seeped from his throbbing pillar, sticking to the beast's pelt and leaving glistening strands behind each time it bounced off its furry, flexing belly. While his own juices smeared the Minotaur, Theseus lapped at its wet nose, curling his tongue around the spit-smeared golden ring and into its nostrils like an unabashed Theban whore. A fire burned in his backside unlike anything he had ever known. The monstrous battering ram thundered in and out under its own power, barely a single hip thrust needed from its bulky anchorage to plough its whole hard, flexing length home. So lost was Theseus in the throes of passion, that his eyes were drawn away from the monster only by the deep yellow light growing all around. A cavernous rectangular hall now surrounded him, its walls lined with rows of burning torches and with a floor carpeted with countless animal skins. He had been walked all the way to the very heart of the maze by the Minotaur, their furious coupling seemingly robbing him of any sense of time or space. Tall wine amphora and baskets of fresh fruit rested in a corner near the imposing doorway through which they had entered, these the daily offerings of Ariadeus and the bull cult, while a mighty fire raged in the hearth at the centre of the room, its glowing embers rising almost to the rafters of the dark wooden roof as its warmth embraced the pair. The Minotaur dropped to its knees, slipping from inside its newest Greek plaything to lay him back-first into the soft, thick furs. With all its other enslaved lovers, the beast had taken what it wanted at will, savagely debasing each mindless man without a thought for their pleasure, the sheer force of its physical and magical hold over them enough alone to drive them to climax. But with this warrior it was different, for he was no ordinary man, and had, quite without knowing it, changed to rules of this bull-spawn's pleasure games. It indulged itself, licking Theseus' heaving chest and sucking so hard on his rigid nipples that they rose high from their moorings, hard nubs grinding between large flat teeth before being allowed to spring free. A lick curled around the outside of one of the prince's pectorals, sweeping up a few damp stray hairs protruding from his armpit as it went, the heavy musk saturating them almost making the Minotaur's tongue spasm. Its scarlet irises dilated at the vivid male flavour, and it shook its head briefly to regain its senses, before quickly slamming Theseus' hands down over his head and burying its muzzle deep into each musky erogenous pit in turn. Obscene, curling tongue-strokes slathered every firm muscle from neck to naval, winding its way on an achingly long path to the one area that desired it's attentions most of all. Thundering like an avalanche through the dense sweated hairs of Theseus' groin, its wet tip curled around and behind his seed-heavy sack to meet its gold ring the other side. None of the countless sexual experiences in Theseus' life were adequate preparation for the mind-bending feeling of a hot, dextrous animal mouth rising up his manhood, carrying his swelling gonads high up its length until the sack in which they resided could be pulled no further, popping loose from the muzzle and its relentless assent. Rumbles of pleasure vibrated through the erect tissue from the Minotaur as it drank him in, lapping at the broad, plump crown to draw out yet more thirst-quenching fore-seed. But it was not enough. It hungered for more. Up went Theseus into the air once again, lifted to his feet by the hips so the kneeling beast could swallow him completely. He gripped its horn-tips, looking down just in time to see his thick, proud member sinking deep into its snout to the hilt. The sight should have repulsed him, filled him with outrage and hate at having his warrior dignity affronted so blatantly by such an unnatural enemy. But instead, with his head rolling back, he welcomed the wet heat of its mouth, his top lip twitching back and baring his teeth to the rafters in a dark grin. Even if he hadn't wanted this, he knew that he could do nothing to resist such overwhelming might, and that fact seemed only to enflame him even more. He rocked his groin in time with those impossibly tight lips, the Minotaur's tongue swirling around his shaft on every inward stroke again and again until it had driven him to the very edge. Then, just as Theseus was a hairs-breadth from the zenith, the creature reared back its head and let his Marble-hard herm spring from its dripping maw, eliciting a tortured exclamation from the desperate Greek. \"PLEASE! MORE! I BEG YOU! MOOORE!!\" Given no more time to plea for fresh oral pleasure, Theseus found himself on his hands and knees, the snorting monster impaling his breathless body once again with its full length so deeply it almost seemed it would emerge from his throat. A long, savouring lick ran up his spine, arriving at the base of his skull with a hot blast of nasal air that blew through his damp hair to the scalp beneath. This mass of sensations served only to extrude Theseus' reason even further, chief amongst them the impossibly erotic tightness in his rear, stretched wide and holding firmly to the slick neck-thick, column filling him so perfectly. His face buried itself in the pelt beneath him, a long moan issuing into the soft bearskin as the first few thrusts turned his spine to water. From then on it was a strength-testing ride, Theseus' full, round buttocks slapping loudly and with ever-greater speed against the monster's sinuous hips. A weak thought crossed his lust-addled mind that this fate must have befallen all the Athenians that had gone before him, the stout swordsmen willingly handing themselves over for the beast to sate itself upon. He could not have been more wrong, for the others had been no more than possessions to the Minotaur, pert muscular dolls to play with until it wore them out. Its actions towards him were quite different, for Theseus was not the only one spell-bound. He may have been on his knees, his pectorals jerking on his ribcage from the jarring penetrations, but the Minotaur was now just as much a slave to him as the hero was to it. For Theseus too was spawned by a god, and held in his possession that same sexual power that now intoxicated the beast with equal force to that which possessed him. As if he were the greatest of feasts, the Minotaur consumed him. Long sweeps of its tongue gathered up sweat from his broad, triangular back, while every hair on its body stood erect thanks to the impossibly tight waist in its grasp. So compact was it, that the fingers of the monster's huge hands almost met each other on his belly, and beneath them it could feel its own epic member invading and retreating. Even after a host of savage attacks, the human ring gripping it remained defiantly tight, as if to demonstrate its owner's physical prowess. More and more laboured became the beast's breaths, as if the sheer overwhelming perfection of its new mate were challenging the strength of its blood-lust, testing its endurance. It lay back on the furs, lifting the Greek as it went, wanting him to ride its groin as if it were a horse at full gallop. Theseus took no prompting, bracing his hands on the beast's knees and bearing down hard onto the red-hot sceptre. Determined to be breached by every inch of it, he threw all the muscles of his majestic body into that quest. His bestial lover looked on snorting, watching his mighty back flexing and undulating from neck to buttocks. A few minutes in that position had the prince's untouched manhood streaming, almost the entirety of his shaft glazed with a clear viscous coating. Filled now with a fearless sexual daring, Theseus turned himself around on the demonic pillar, grunting as he felt it shift inside him, his manhood leaving a silvery trail on one of the Minotaur's enormous thighs. With palms braced either side of its naval, he rode it with even more vigour, meeting its aggressive stare with one of his own and scraping his fingernails against its furry belly. Both were near now. Their breaths growing more ragged and uneven with every passing minute. Theseus reached his arms back, bracing himself once more on the beast's thickset knees, his torso arching in a way that had his statuesque abdominals stretching long and tight, a bulge rising and falling beneath them with each of his full-bodied thrusts. Had anyone been standing in the doorway, they would have born witness to a spectacular, other-worldly sight. Two god-like male forms, silhouetted against the raging fire, their synchronised bodies burning in a sexual dance as hot as the flames themselves. Every vein protruding. Every muscle straining. Strong sinuous hips rising and falling towards each other, desperately crashing together like two racks of antlers. The moment had come. In a supreme act of physical union, they would climax together. Both heads flung back in unison, a groan and a roar echoing inside the hall and blending into a single deafening call. The Minotaur's searing seed burst into Theseus, a molten army pouring in through his broken gates, sacking the Athenian's insides and taking the Greek that one last step over the cliff edge. Heroic semen issued high into the air between them, raining down in a torrent onto the Minotaur's face, painting its hungry lips with thick, milky-white ropes. Each orgasm only fed the other, a demonic tongue snaking out to taste yet more of the hero's copious gift, while an excess of its own bestial seed spilled from the Greek's conquered hole and down the phallus from which it had erupted, greasing the shaft yet further for Theseus' ardent, still-unrelenting bodily thrusts. Like sword and scabbard, each male seemed made to fit the other, a feeling so perfect that neither stopped until both were utterly dry, with one last tired upwelling oozing from the Athenian before he collapsed exhausted onto the heaving chest beneath him. For a few long moments they lay there, one slipping from inside the other, the sound of softening breaths giving way to the crackle of the firewood. But fate would not allow them long to wallow in their post-coital glow, for these two demi-gods had shared each other's essence, and the result would fall beyond the imaginings of even the gods themselves. A sudden, violent spasm of their whole frames jolted Prince and beast out of their near-slumber. Against their will, some unknown force had them both leaping to their feet. Theseus stared in shock at the Minotaur, as much from seeing fear in its eyes for the first time as from the rebelling of their bodies. Dropping to their knees, their manhoods awoke again, rising fast until fiercely turgid. A heat grew in their shaking cores, building until it felt as if they had both swallowed the sun itself. Muscle-saddled spines arched hard, pushing their full chests high up into the air and their heads forcibly back, making Theseus' long locks spray sweat from the sudden motion. Both their mouths drew wide open, ready to provide the next other-worldly sight for the chamber to play host to. Columns of glowing blue smoke arose from within their throats, climbing high into the warm air of the hall, spiralling around each other and stirring up into a tempest. With greater and greater force it blew, picking up the burning logs of the fire, the animal skins and the food, until a whirlwind of cinders, furs and broken pottery raged around the calm eye in which they knelt. As the last wisps of godly energy slipped from their mouths, a blindingly bright ball of it gathered above their heads. Free of jolting spasms for just a moment, both were able to take in a few ragged breaths before the next supernatural act began. Two rivers of smoke shot from the glowing sphere, plunging head-long into their throbbing members. Their faces dropped, blank of expression, eyes rolling back to empty whiteness. Blind, and lost inside himself, Theseus felt nothing but the warm, now-familiar sense of being filled by the Minotaur. But it was not the beast's seed flooding him now. This most intimate of invasions was gifting each with the essence of the other, and would, as they would soon discover, bring changes in both that would surpass even the epic spectacle of their mating, The first the Athenian knew of it was the tingling in his fingertips. The digits swelled and lengthened, a carpet of brown hairs bursting from beneath the skin around his darkening fingernails. The toes on his feet melted together into glossy grey hoofs, pelt sprouting there too, all while his shins and ankles stretched contorted into new bovine joints. His whole frame engorged, waves of fur rising up his limbs and coating his swelling musculature. It crested his newly-swollen rump, a tail bursting snake-like from the root of his spine as the transformation engulfed his torso at the shoulders and hips. Dark nipples grew as large and prominent as shield bosses as each pectoral swelled into a mighty slab. The groans and gasps issuing from him collapsed into deeper, more guttural noises, the voice box that made them growing cruder in his thickening neck. High cheekbones and square mandible gave way to an even squarer, long-tongued muzzle. The wave of change reached the summit of his skull, sending two huge grey horns erupting out from under the scalp. Olympian magic completed its work with one final flourish, ending where it had begun. Veins swelled at the base of his twitching phallus, climbing like creepers up the lengthening shaft until his manhood was tall, thick, and with a fierce upward curve. The last remnants of the glowing orb evaporated, and with it the power of the tempest around them, the air shedding its debris onto the stone floor but leaving the perfect uncluttered circle around the two. Theseus dropped breathlessly onto his enormous new haunches. His vision returned, he peered down at the huge herm, jutting so high and proud from between his immense furry thighs that it almost touched his lips. By the gods... He tried to speak, but instead only animal rumblings came out. These changes would have amazed him more if he had been given time to dwell upon them, but a hand pressing against the crown of his head drew his thoughts away. Slowly, he looked up, those same fingertips sliding down his muzzle and the shocked features of his new bovine face. A vision even more unexpected than the sight of himself greeted his eyes. Muscular and handsome, a naked man with long, ice-white locks peered back at him. It can't be... Theseus shook his head, questioning his own senses, but it WAS him. It had to be. Those fire-red eyes. The nose ring now lying broken on the floor. It was the Minotaur, or at least that which used to be, now transfigured into an entirely new and just as spectacular being. They rose from the floor together, Theseus momentarily dizzied by how high he now towered over his lover. The Minotaur was now endowed with a warrior's body, as perfect as the Greek's old form. Finely-honed muscle and sweeping curves caught the moon rays coming through the doorway, dustings of white hair wonderfully accentuating the most intimate areas. The stare boring into his eyes was just as intense as before, only this time it emanated from a beautiful human face. Possessed with the creature's instincts yet somehow still himself, suddenly Theseus understood its nature completely. It's lust. Its passions. They all coursed through him now, honest, raw and unrefined. The Minotaur too had gained more than just a human form, and the first words it had even spoken would prove it to Theseus. \"Take me.\" The two demi-gods had shared each other's essence, and now, for the few hours of night still remaining, each would know sex through the other's eyes. Hard, breathless passion consumed them both, almost blending them into one being. The beast, who had taken so many men so wildly, revelled in being taken itself for the first time. And Theseus, once so noble and dignified, now let loose these unstoppable, animal urges at full force, pouring them into the Minotaur's unconquered human body with his enormous, pulsing member. Climax after bone-shaking climax flooded between them, bathing them inside and out. Each seemed utterly inexhaustible, and would, it seems have gone on forever, had not another powerful entity made its presence felt. With them both panting, arms and legs still holding on tightly, the first few rays of dawn reached over the walls of the maze and in through the doorway, falling bright on their steaming bodies. Its effect on Theseus was immediate. With the dawn chorus seeping into the chamber, his huge bovine bulk shrank, horns and fur vanishing smoothly into him until he was once again the handsome young prince who had set off from Athens what seemed like a lifetime ago. Still in the embrace of his unchanged lover, he looked into those deep vermilion eyes and whispered the name that would finally and forever bond the two, the name now burned into him, body and soul. \"...Asterion...\" There would be no killing today. No victorious Prince would walk from the Labyrinth with a bloodied bull's head to hold high in triumph. There had been a conquest thought, but both had been victorious, and now the two magnificent men, both born of the gods, departed the maze together, animal skins tied loosely around their hips for the galloping horseback ride to the coast. And so, turning their ship away from the shores of Crete, the cohorts headed out into the vast Aegean, calm and untroubled by Poseidon. The true story of their adventure would never be known to Greece, kept secret by a grateful band of brothers, honoured to call two demi-gods their friends. Only Theseus' triumph in the Labyrinth would be remembered by posterity. The heroic defeat of a hideous half-breed. No one would know that his encounter with the Minotaur had never ended. Would know that, so often, as the last of the twilight faded over the painted temples of Athens, he and his white-haired lover would journey high into the hills of Attica together. To become man or beast at will......and lock horns once again.",

      "Some of these men would surely have visited the Greek games, seen him compete there, and might recognise him.",

      "He seemed doomed.",

      "As that very thought crossed his mind, the heavy door beyond his feet creaked.",
      "Flickering yellow rays burst through the gap as it opened, he assumed to be followed by an enraged hoard of spearmen.",
      "But instead, only a single hooded figure appeared.",
      "He stood silently in the doorway for a moment, oil lamp in hand, letting its gentle light pour down on the shackled hero's glowing skin.",
      "Carefully sealing the door behind him, he paced forward slowly, coming to a halt next to the Athenian's strong but troubled face.",
      "Placing the lamp on the alter next to him, he lifted the hood of his cowl.",
      "It was Ariadeus.",
      "The callow young prince's chestnut eyes stared down at him, his soft, elegant features and flowing blond locks catching the lamplight.",
      "His expression, though far from murderous or disdainful, seemed mild and unreadable to the prince.",
      "He would soon explain however, that he had a use in mind for Theseus that was far more benign than his father's.",
      "On first seeing Theseus in the courtyard, Ariadeus had known him to be above normal men.",
      "His demi-god nature shone from him in a way only a priest could see.",
      "In that moment, he felt as if he too had been sent a gift by Poseidon, just as his father had, and likewise recoiled at the thought of sacrificing such divine magnificence to the monstrous half-brother he kept fed and watered within the maze.",
      "It seemed almost sacrilege, but he had kept it to himself, wise enough to hide his true feelings behind public spectacle.",
      "\"You know who I am,\" Theseus stated quietly in an accepting tone, raising a slight smile from the Cretan prince.",
      "\"Of course.",
      "It was obvious to me.",
      "I've heard many stories of your strength and heroism Theseus...and of your beauty.\"",
      "A hand rested softly upon the Athenian's mighty chest.",
      "\"And I believe I can also guess at your purpose here.",
      "You have not come simply to wonder the maze unarmed and be devoured like the others\".",
      "He reasoned, feeling the slow strong beat of his mighty heart under the broad plate of muscle.",
      "His other hand lingered softly on the Athenian's rippling stomach.",
      "\"I have an offer for you, one I hope may satisfy both our needs...\" came his suggestive tones, a single fingertip toying gently with the rim of Theseus' naval.",
      "\"I will free you and your compatriots, and help you in your dealings with the Minotaur, for one wish in return.\"",
      "Theseus looked at him with a serious stare.",
      "\"Name your price,\" He asked, expecting it to be high.",
      "The young priest's toying expression suddenly dropped away.",
      "\"Poseidon still distains the king.",
      "He has not forgiven him for his slight.",
      "The sacrifices only stay his trident.",
      "After all these years, my father has grown bitter and resentful at the rejection.",
      "This palace is now a place of misery and fear, not somewhere any sane man would choose to remain.",
      "And besides, the thought of sending innocent men to their deaths to pay for my father's folly holds no joy for me.\"",
      "Theseus could see genuine revulsion in the young man's eyes at the very thought of it.",
      "\"Carry me away from this place,\" he asked, half pleading, half demanding.",
      "\"That is all?\" the hero asked, surprised for a moment by the simplicity of the nodding prince's request, until his mind had fully realised the implications of carrying out his wish.",
      "\"But wait, what of Poseidon?",
      "Surely he would be even more enraged if one of his own priests liberating gifts meant for him.",
      "His waves would dash us on the rocks the moment we took sail.\"",
      "It was a simple truth, but one which the young man had already considered.",
      "\"Ah, but we would have a guarantor of our safety on-board, would we not?",
      "I doubt he would choose to sink a ship carrying the fruit of his own loins.\"",
      "The Athenian's jaw muscles flexed under his high cheekbones.",
      "\"It seems you know a great deal more about me than most men.\"",
      "\"Oh, we priests hold many secrets.",
      "So, what of my offer...demi-god?\" Ariadeus challenged.",
      "\"Well, it seems I am in no position to refuse,\" Theseus retorted, smiling slightly as he rattled his chains.",
      "\"You have my word\".",
      "With that, the young high-priest moved to free him from his bondage, and after sitting up and making a few sore stretches of his unshackled limbs, both made for the door.",
      "As his fingers grasped the handle, a gentle hand took hold of the hero's thick wrist.",
      "\"Wait...There is one more price...\" he whispered to the warrior, whose eyebrow rose a little, questioningly.",
      "\"I desire to know the taste of you, if only once.",
      "Think if it as a small...offering.\"",
      "He leaning up to the taller man's face and placing on his mouth a careful, soft kiss.",
      "Theseus, being a Greek warrior, was no stranger to the love of other men, and accepted the beautiful young prince's terms with ease, running a strong hand up his back and the other into his golden hair, enveloping his soft, succulent lips in a passionate, full-bodied kiss.",
      "With the second price paid in full, the two quietly freed Theseus' comrades from their cells and told them of his new plans.",
      "Once Ariadeus had led him to the maze, the young prince would return and slip them out of the palace to the coast were they would steal a ship and wait for Theseus.",
      "With everything made clear, they parted, he and his new companion slipping through the corridors and precincts of the palace like ghosts, coming eventually to a balcony at its rear.",
      "There, bathed in moonlight, lay the Labyrinth.",
      "As large as the city it sat behind, its towering outer-wall encircled a tangled web of masonry, within which already lay the bones of fourteen innocent Athenians.",
      "Theseus clenched his jaw, determined they would be the last.",
      "Ariadeus handed him a ball of string, instructing him on how it would aide in his escape from the maze, before providing one last sacred piece of knowledge.",
      "\"Asterion...the creature's true name.",
      "Look it in the eyes, speak it, and it will be yours.\"",
      "Theseus bade him farewell with another kiss and slipped down a winding creeper to the ground.",
      "Knowing exactly where the traders had hidden his weapons, he fished them free from the dense ornamental bushes flanking the high walls of the maze.",
      "Onto his waist went his sword belt, and he slipped the broad, round shield over his left forearm.",
      "Pushing his tightly-fitting bronze helmet down over his face, he jogged forward, its red horsehair crest catching the light of the two flaming torches which framed the towering doors to the Labyrinth.",
      "After pulling back the huge bolt, which seemed made more for a giant's hands, he lifted one torch from its fixing, and yanked with his whole body weight on one of the door's enormous ringed handles.",
      "A low groan issued from its hinges as it reluctantly swung open, just enough for the athletic Greek to slip through.",
      "Knotting the end of his ball of twine to the other ring, he stepped inside.",
      "Theseus paused just inside the threshold for a moment, his breath condensing in the cold, still atmosphere, before striding forward to meet the fate the gods had prepared for him.",
      "With the starry sky above serving as a ceiling to the roofless maze, moonbeams poured down onto the cracked and weed-strewn slabs beneath his sandals.",
      "Yellow light from the hero's torch flickered against the walls, making the limbs of half-dead vines cast long sinister shadows into the darkness ahead.",
      "He knew from Ariadeus that the creature resided at the very core of the sprawling warren, and that his best chance of defeating it was to surprise it whilst it slept.",
      "As his path twisted and turned through the uneven corridors, the ball of string span wildly in his palm, the yarn spitting out from between two of his fingers.",
      "Even with the high-priest's guidance, navigating the Labyrinth was proving a near-impossible task for the muscular hero.",
      "Dead-ends and looping passages burned precious time, with the demi-god more than once coming upon the string he had lain behind himself.",
      "Having lost an hour to the genius of Daedalus' design, a frustrated Theseus decided instead to make use of his brawn to assist his passage.",
      "Finding another thick-stemmed vine, he lay down his shield and torch and began to climb.",
      "From the wall's top he would surely be able to see the true route to the centre.",
      "Although his logic was good, Theseus had assumed the masonry of the maze to be as sound as its confusing design.",
      "But it was not so.",
      "As he continued to scramble up the woody, overlapping limbs, the plant's anchors loosened from their fixings, unable to carry the hero's flexing bulk.",
      "Dry mortar spilling onto his shoulders gave warning of what was to come.",
      "He looked up, his eyes widening in panic, as great blocks of stone started heaving and grinding against each other near the top of the wall.",
      "Their corners flaked and cracked, their strength destroyed by years of rain and sun, sending a hail of grit down onto the now rapidly descending warrior.",
      "Leaves streaked a green slime onto his palms has he slid downwards with incredible speed, and just as his sandal touched the floor, the first mighty block took flight.",
      "Theseus dived away, with it missing his head by a hairs-breadth and shattering with a heavy thud.",
      "More followed, with the hero rolling out of harms-way as they tumbled in a pile onto the broken pavement with a ground-shaking rumble.",
      "A pall of dust washed out from the uneven mound of rubble, its heavy particles falling like snow on the hero's bare musculature as he surveyed the gaping breach from which the rocks had poured.",
      "Brushing the dry grains from his biceps as he stood, a deflated Theseus cursed his bad fortune, wondering if perhaps his father had been wiser in trying to stop him.",
      "This self-doubt however would soon be shocked from the Greek's thoughts.",
      "A blood-chilling sound washed over the Labyrinth, its note deep and uneven, with the unmistakable roughness of a bovine throat.",
      "The Minotaur had awoken, stirred by the noise of the collapse, and was sure to begin at any moment searching out the disturbance in its realm.",
      "Theseus scrambled for his shield and torch, his eyes darting between the dark passageways that suddenly seemed to be all around him.",
      "His first instinct was to run, but his years of training soon tamed that impulse.",
      "His accident had provided him with an opportunity.",
      "The beast would come to him now.",
      "All he need do was find the right spot from which to strike, but first he would leave a small distraction to draw its curiosity.",
      "Scaling the small hill of rubble, Theseus planted his torch upright in its summit.",
      "Its fire shone like a beacon as its owner now slid his sword free from its scabbard and slinked off to watch from a shadowy corner a dozen paces away.",
      "Tense minutes passed by with aching slowness for the Greek, whose clammy palm played nervously with the leathered grip of his weapon.",
      "With his eyes fixed on the dancing flame ahead, his mind swam in the vast library of useful memories amassed facing countless other foes.",
      "Not to mention day after day of sweat-drenched training.",
      "All the back-breaking trails and tests.",
      "The mock sword fights and wrestling matches.",
      "All of it giving him the statue-like frame of a Titan and skills as sharp as the blade in his hand.",
      "He would need all of them to defeat this latest enemy, one who's heavy hoof-falls had just come in range of the hero's ears.",
      "Grip tightening, goosebumps washed over his sun-soaked skin as the stone-scraping thuds grew louder, echoing around him.",
      "A huge horned shadow grew across the floor ahead from a side passage, climbing the rubble mound as its owner cautiously neared.",
      "Finally, it strode into view.",
      "The Minotaur.",
      "Confused and surprised, Theseus looked at the beast stood in profile before him.",
      "What he could see of it in the dim light seemed nothing like the hideous, malformed image a lifetime of stories had placed in his imagination.",
      "As tall as a rearing horse, long black horns curled lyre-like towards the sky from its wide, angular head, and a dense layer of short, milk-white hairs covered its entire colossal body, growing longer over its fore-arms and double-jointed legs.",
      "The broad, towering frame was awash with beef, every hefty muscle swelling proudly from its anchorage with perfect, statuesque definition.",
      "Far from being repulsive, it was magnificent.",
      "Man and bull perfectly blended into a single god-like being.",
      "Reminded of his purpose by heavy club it carried with it, Theseus' admiration of its aesthetic qualities quickly gave way to more pressing tactical matters.",
      "The curious but wary Minotaur reached for the burning torch, its long, tuft-tipped tail dancing nervously in the air as it's thick fingers slid around the wood.",
      "This was the moment.",
      "With the creature turning its back on him, and its attention focused fully on the flame, Theseus could strike.",
      "Just as the beast grasped the torch and started pulling it free from the rubble, the Greek burst from his hiding place, shooting like lightening across the space between them.",
      "He leapt upwards as he neared it, planning to bring his sword down hard behind its collarbone to kill it with a single thrust, but it was not to be.",
      "As Theseus sailed through the air, the Minotaur sensed the danger, instinctively swinging the roughly-carved club in its other hand.",
      "It glanced off the top of the Athenian's shield, struck the side of his helmet, and sent him cartwheeling towards a side wall.",
      "His sword flew from his grasp, planting itself tip-first in the rubble pile while he tumbled with a heavy thud onto the cracked pavement, landing in a sitting position against the wall with his dented headpiece rolling around beside him.",
      "Dazed, his limbs moved sluggishly as he tried to rouse himself, the edge of his shield scraping the stone floor as a massive silhouette moved over him.",
      "Torch in one hand, club in the other, the snorting Minotaur filled his blurry vision.",
      "Squatting down, the thick golden ring in its pale pink snout glinted as it moved close to the groggy hero.",
      "A hot breath blasted from its nostrils, issuing in two waves of steam over Theseus' handsome, unprotected face.",
      "The heavy cloud seemed to search out his mouth and nose, flowing into him as if alive.",
      "An unnatural heat carried with it, filling his insides with a strange, furnace-like burning strong enough to drag the dizzy warrior back to his senses.",
      "His cleared sight was met by two fierce glowing red eyes, dripping more with instinct than thought, burning purposefully into the Greek's own.",
      "For a few moments, Theseus could not look away.",
      "It was as if a spell had fallen over him.",
      "Its piercing animal gaze seemed to cut to his very soul.",
      "But his will was still strong, and he managed to shake his mind free, enough sharpness now returned for him to lash out defensively with his battered shield, knocking the torch from the Minotaur's hand and sending it stumbling backwards over one of the broken stones.",
      "Springing to his feet, he shot past the surprised beast and over the rubble mound, snatching up his sword and dashing through the breach in the wall.",
      "An enraged roar filled the maze as he sprinted away, followed fast by heavy, quickening hoof-falls behind him.",
      "His shapely legs became a blur, carrying him away through bends and turns of the maze for a far greater distance than the hero had truly intended.",
      "He had only wanted to put a few moments of time between him and the monster, enough to prepare for the fight, yet he was still running.",
      "Eventually he forced himself to a stop.",
      "His broad chest heaved as he slumped back against the masonry of the Labyrinth, trying to fathom his actions.",
      "Something has spurred him on.",
      "He felt as if he had been running from more than just the Minotaur.",
      "With his breath slowing, growing awareness of other sensations countered his exhaustion.",
      "They pulled his eyes down over his own form, to take in the sight of his erect brown nipples, there thick nubs standing-out proudly from his sweat-beaded pectorals.",
      "The skin there felt tighter than it had ever been before, the pinching enough to have drawn his gaze.",
      "He could have dismissed this as caused merely by the chill of the air on his perfect skin, or the thrill of a life-or-death chase, were it not for the stirring of another part of his godly form.",
      "Further down, his engorging manhood pushed against the calfskin that held it, filling out the soft vellum until its tip had pushed all the way across to his left hip.",
      "\"By the gods...\" Shocked, Theseus' breath shuddered in confusion and he pushing at the bulge with his free hand, as if trying to send away the organ for its unwanted behavior.",
      "But this did nothing to abate it, in fact, the rejection seemed only to make it grow harder, its swelling crown fighting against the prison holding it back.",
      "He tried to lift his hand away, but it refused his commands.",
      "Every heartbeat sent another wave of growth along the pillar, and Theseus found himself fighting a growing need to free it.",
      "To have it in his grasp.",
      "To stroke it.",
      "Unknown to the warrior prince, the cause of his unnatural arousal was the very creature now searching him out in its vast domain.",
      "For the Minotaur did devour men, but not in the manner all the world believed.",
      "It was a secret only a handful knew, and unfortunately for Theseus, young Ariadeus was not one of them.",
      "A ravenous lust had consumed the beast from the moment it came of age, a lust that had been first meted out on a few unlucky palace guards.",
      "It was their embarrassed, half-told stories that had been misunderstood by so many eager ears, spun into tales of a horned monster that ate man-flesh.",
      "It would break any chain to sate its thirst, and as it matured, only the strongest and most durable men had the strength to satisfy it for any amount of time, so the Labyrinth and the Athenian tribute proved the perfect solution.",
      "Possessed of the seductive potency of its beast father, each man who had entered the maze had been quickly ensnared, only a single wisp of its hot breath on their tongues needed to empty their minds of all worldly concerns and have them surrender willingly to its raw animal need.",
      "An endless sexual frenzy had followed for each.",
      "Year upon year of unrestrained, unending coupling ravaging their bodies until one after the other they gave way under the sheer strain.",
      "The labyrinth was a prison for man as much as beast, and the Minotaur's breath spelt ecstasy and death for those who tasted it.",
      "Long recovered from his running, Theseus' heart still pounded in his chest.",
      "The strength of its beat now maintained by the magic corrupting his mind.",
      "Closing his eyes, he rested the back of his head against the wall, letting his shield-covered free hand slide slowly off his groin and up his hardened abdominals to his pectoral shelf.",
      "Whispered gasps poured from his mouth with every pull of his nipples, his hand drifting from one to the other to rub the erect nubs hard between finger and thumb.",
      "He was sinking into erotic exhaustion, his poisoned instincts robbing his strength.",
      "Yet still enough of him remembered its purpose, refusing to release the sword in his hand, even as he rubbed roughly at his throbbing bulge with its pommel.",
      "So engrossed was Theseus in kneading his manhood with the rounded metal, that it took a few moments for the heavy trot of approaching hooves to drag him back to his senses.",
      "His eyelids parted, and the towering outline of the Minotaur filled his vision once again, standing motionless at the dark exit of a passage.",
      "Led by the Greek's vivid scent, its flaming ruby eyes had only to take in his overtaxed garment to know that it had him half-enslaved already.",
      "Theseus pushed his sweaty unwilling physique away from the wall with his elbows, the blade shaking in his hand as he raised it to defend himself.",
      "So out-of-sorts was he that he had to remind himself to take a defensive posture, bending his knees and lifting his dented shield until only his eyes peered over the rim.",
      "The beast stepped forward, a glow filling the space they shared as the moonbeams hit upon its snowy pelt, and then...it simply stopped.",
      "Resting the blunt end of its club on the pavement, it stood motionless just beyond the reach of Theseus' sword.",
      "\"Ast...Aster...\" He tried to speak its name, but the word would not leave his mouth.",
      "Its glare burned through the Greek's skull, somehow commanding his eyes to wander over the rest of its monumental body.",
      "With the Minotaur much closer than before, Theseus could see how truly glorious it really was.",
      "A streak of brown hair ran from its chin down its thick neck and midline, mirrored by another running up its spine to end in a bushy crest sprouting from the back of its head.",
      "Thinner lines of hair flowed off from both, flowing river-like in and around the borders of each mountainous muscle group, defining them still further than their clean edges already did.",
      "Full round nipples, of obscene size and matched the pink of its flat, square muzzle, crowned like two hill-top fortresses the thick wide pectorals dominating its torso.",
      "Every limb abounded with countless heaving muscles, its shoulders needing immense power simply to lift arms the breadth of Theseus' own waist.",
      "Nothing seemed out of place or wrongly-sized to the Greek.",
      "Nothing.",
      "Even the nails at the ends of its thick, furry white fingers matched the glossy obsidian shade of its horns perfectly.",
      "It was a work of divine art.",
      "A perfect colossus worthy of worship in a temple.",
      "But in truth, his detailed study of the monster's anatomy was now more about preventing his stare from shifting to the one place it should never have wished to go.",
      "Theseus exhaled heavily, fighting the inner demon that kept dragging his eyes back down towards that same spot time and again.",
      "Eventually, he purposefully planted his stare there, in a feeble attempt to convince himself this was the choice of his higher reasoning, not the beast's dark influence.",
      "Two huge, engorged, oval gonads, heavy with semen, hung pendulously between its tree trunk-thick thighs, a tuft of dark hair sprouting from the bottom of the brown-furred sack in which they swayed.",
      "Clearly this area of the beast too was as much animal as man, as where Theseus expected to see a long dormant member, instead only a large, fur-covered bulge greeted him, with what must have been a sizeable organ lying behind the slit running down its centre, dormant deep within its master's loins.",
      "Green eyes locked with red once again, only this time Theseus stared back with the same unblinking intensity.",
      "Vacant-minded, he lifted slowly out of his defensive posture, somehow lost to the moment.",
      "His arms lowered, a heavy clang echoing out as the battered shield slipped from his arm.",
      "Only one last symbol of his heroic defiance remained.",
      "His fingers loosened their grip on his sword, the fear of being unarmed dissolving under the Minotaur's wild hypnosis.",
      "It stoked a fire inside him, turning to ashes all other thoughts.",
      "His plan.",
      "His comrades.",
      "Athens.",
      "It all drifted into irrelevancy.",
      "Sharpened bronze slipped from his grasp, chiming his surrender as it struck the stones beneath.",
      "With it dropped monster's own club, rolling from its hand like a freshly-felled tree.",
      "Theseus threw himself up into the creature's embrace, gripping its huge shoulders and clamping his hefty legs around its torso.",
      "The delicious feeling of hard muscle under soft velvet pelt made his skin itch where ever the two were in contact, and Theseus could only hold himself back for a split second to revel in it before slamming his lips hard against the Minotaur's wet muzzle.",
      "His tongue probed desperately, trying to work its way through the two flat rows of clenched teeth inside.",
      "They gave way, but not to let him in.",
      "A massive slick black tongue poured into the Greek's mouth, while muscular lips slathering the lower part of his face with saliva, sucking at the potent hero hungrily.",
      "Not content with just his mouth, the ravenous beast slid it's hands down Theseus' back, cradled his firm full rear, and lifted him up until his chest sat level with its demonic maw.",
      "Raised up high, he clung to its horns with both hands, throwing his head back in lust as it consumed the deep cleft between his pectorals.",
      "One nipple, then the other, was savagely assaulted, leaving him almost insane with arousal and calling out at the top of his lungs.",
      "\"BY THE GODS!!!!",
      "YYEEEESSS!!\"",
      "Theseus' ecstasy only served to arouse the Minotaur further, stirring into life its own monstrous organ.",
      "The slit in its groin bulged outwards, it's taught, furry doors resisting only for a moment the demands of its waking resident to be released.",
      "The steaming phallus grew branch-like into the cold air, air now licking Theseus' exposed buttocks as thick hungry fingers tore away his calfskin.",
      "The same length as the hero's arm from shoulder to fingertips, the gargantuan member widened from the man-sized crown at its tip, to the width of the prince's thick-chorded neck at its base.",
      "Almost with a mind of its own, its upward-curving length flexed manically, searching out the newly-exposed entrance as a thirst-crazed man seeks a well.",
      "With the young prince's legs spread wide apart, an open target lay between his tensing glutes.",
      "But Theseus knew nothing of it, utterly mesmerised as he was by the huge inviting nipples flanking his face.",
      "Gasping, his tongue ran absent-mindedly across his bottom lip as he moved forward, mouth and tongue unfurling to worship the pink, iron-hard nub to his right.",
      "It disappeared in the shade of his oral cavity, but before he could lock his lips upon it, a contact made in his deepest recess sent his spine shuddering.",
      "The Minotaur's member had found its goal, and its slick, dripping tip had set to work furiously rubbing at the skin around a passage only ever touched by Athens' noble, gymnasium-sculpted sons.",
      "Lightning thundered up Theseus' vertebrae, leaving him almost paralysed from the stimulation.",
      "All he could do was endure, and that was all he wished to do, grasping and rubbing at the beast's nipples with each hand as he buried his face in its chest.",
      "Eyes closed, he groaned deeply into its musky pelt, and could feel its wild heart pounding against his cheek, its drumbeat the harbinger of an approaching invasion.",
      "Obeying its master's demands, monstrous phallus finally burst inside.",
      "White fur brushed the teeth of Theseus' dark, lust-drenched grin, his eyes rolling under their lids at the ever-deeper, ever-widening penetration.",
      "There was no steady width to this titanic phallus, only greater and greater girth, every newly-arrived portion stretching and straining his muscular passage more than the last.",
      "Theseus relished it, the monster's magic exciting his own impressive spear until it stood proud and erect in the space between their flexing stomachs.",
      "Looking down at it, he swore for a moment that he saw a bulge shift under his eight flexing abdominals.",
      "The crown had ventured deep, thrusting its way into the prince's own inner Labyrinth until the full length of the mighty veined column behind had entered and was pushing at his flat, muscled belly from within.",
      "With the entire shaft swallowed up, the Minotaur's furry groin kissed the Greek's full flexing cheeks.",
      "Still seated in its palms, a ragged Theseus pushed himself up off its chest, locking eyes once more with the creature which had, in the space of only a few minutes, turned from his deadliest enemy, to his welcome sexual tormentor.",
      "Another throat-filling kiss ensued, with spit falling in steaming strings from between their fighting mouths.",
      "Theseus clung firmly to its heavy trapezius muscles, willing the undulating tongue to push its way down into his very core and meet the mighty throbbing hardness already so far within him.",
      "A powerful rumble vibrated from the Minotaur's throat as it sated its thirst, resonating inside the Greek's ribcage and earning a muffled growl in return.",
      "Intoxicated with lust, clear pearls seeped from his throbbing pillar, sticking to the beast's pelt and leaving glistening strands behind each time it bounced off its furry, flexing belly.",
      "While his own juices smeared the Minotaur, Theseus lapped at its wet nose, curling his tongue around the spit-smeared golden ring and into its nostrils like an unabashed Theban whore.",
      "A fire burned in his backside unlike anything he had ever known.",
      "The monstrous battering ram thundered in and out under its own power, barely a single hip thrust needed from its bulky anchorage to plough its whole hard, flexing length home.",
      "So lost was Theseus in the throes of passion, that his eyes were drawn away from the monster only by the deep yellow light growing all around.",
      "A cavernous rectangular hall now surrounded him, its walls lined with rows of burning torches and with a floor carpeted with countless animal skins.",
      "He had been walked all the way to the very heart of the maze by the Minotaur, their furious coupling seemingly robbing him of any sense of time or space.",
      "Tall wine amphora and baskets of fresh fruit rested in a corner near the imposing doorway through which they had entered, these the daily offerings of Ariadeus and the bull cult, while a mighty fire raged in the hearth at the centre of the room, its glowing embers rising almost to the rafters of the dark wooden roof as its warmth embraced the pair.",
      "The Minotaur dropped to its knees, slipping from inside its newest Greek plaything to lay him back-first into the soft, thick furs.",
      "With all its other enslaved lovers, the beast had taken what it wanted at will, savagely debasing each mindless man without a thought for their pleasure, the sheer force of its physical and magical hold over them enough alone to drive them to climax.",
      "But with this warrior it was different, for he was no ordinary man, and had, quite without knowing it, changed to rules of this bull-spawn's pleasure games.",
      "It indulged itself, licking Theseus' heaving chest and sucking so hard on his rigid nipples that they rose high from their moorings, hard nubs grinding between large flat teeth before being allowed to spring free.",
      "A lick curled around the outside of one of the prince's pectorals, sweeping up a few damp stray hairs protruding from his armpit as it went, the heavy musk saturating them almost making the Minotaur's tongue spasm.",
      "Its scarlet irises dilated at the vivid male flavour, and it shook its head briefly to regain its senses, before quickly slamming Theseus' hands down over his head and burying its muzzle deep into each musky erogenous pit in turn.",
      "Obscene, curling tongue-strokes slathered every firm muscle from neck to naval, winding its way on an achingly long path to the one area that desired it's attentions most of all.",
      "Thundering like an avalanche through the dense sweated hairs of Theseus' groin, its wet tip curled around and behind his seed-heavy sack to meet its gold ring the other side.",
      "None of the countless sexual experiences in Theseus' life were adequate preparation for the mind-bending feeling of a hot, dextrous animal mouth rising up his manhood, carrying his swelling gonads high up its length until the sack in which they resided could be pulled no further, popping loose from the muzzle and its relentless assent.",
      "Rumbles of pleasure vibrated through the erect tissue from the Minotaur as it drank him in, lapping at the broad, plump crown to draw out yet more thirst-quenching fore-seed.",
      "But it was not enough.",
      "It hungered for more.",
      "Up went Theseus into the air once again, lifted to his feet by the hips so the kneeling beast could swallow him completely.",
      "He gripped its horn-tips, looking down just in time to see his thick, proud member sinking deep into its snout to the hilt.",
      "The sight should have repulsed him, filled him with outrage and hate at having his warrior dignity affronted so blatantly by such an unnatural enemy.",
      "But instead, with his head rolling back, he welcomed the wet heat of its mouth, his top lip twitching back and baring his teeth to the rafters in a dark grin.",
      "Even if he hadn't wanted this, he knew that he could do nothing to resist such overwhelming might, and that fact seemed only to enflame him even more.",
      "He rocked his groin in time with those impossibly tight lips, the Minotaur's tongue swirling around his shaft on every inward stroke again and again until it had driven him to the very edge.",
      "Then, just as Theseus was a hairs-breadth from the zenith, the creature reared back its head and let his Marble-hard herm spring from its dripping maw, eliciting a tortured exclamation from the desperate Greek.",
      "\"PLEASE!",
      "MORE!",
      "I BEG YOU!",
      "MOOORE!!\"",
      "Given no more time to plea for fresh oral pleasure, Theseus found himself on his hands and knees, the snorting monster impaling his breathless body once again with its full length so deeply it almost seemed it would emerge from his throat.",
      "A long, savouring lick ran up his spine, arriving at the base of his skull with a hot blast of nasal air that blew through his damp hair to the scalp beneath.",
      "This mass of sensations served only to extrude Theseus' reason even further, chief amongst them the impossibly erotic tightness in his rear, stretched wide and holding firmly to the slick neck-thick, column filling him so perfectly.",
      "His face buried itself in the pelt beneath him, a long moan issuing into the soft bearskin as the first few thrusts turned his spine to water.",
      "From then on it was a strength-testing ride, Theseus' full, round buttocks slapping loudly and with ever-greater speed against the monster's sinuous hips.",
      "A weak thought crossed his lust-addled mind that this fate must have befallen all the Athenians that had gone before him, the stout swordsmen willingly handing themselves over for the beast to sate itself upon.",
      "He could not have been more wrong, for the others had been no more than possessions to the Minotaur, pert muscular dolls to play with until it wore them out.",
      "Its actions towards him were quite different, for Theseus was not the only one spell-bound.",
      "He may have been on his knees, his pectorals jerking on his ribcage from the jarring penetrations, but the Minotaur was now just as much a slave to him as the hero was to it.",
      "For Theseus too was spawned by a god, and held in his possession that same sexual power that now intoxicated the beast with equal force to that which possessed him.",
      "As if he were the greatest of feasts, the Minotaur consumed him.",
      "Long sweeps of its tongue gathered up sweat from his broad, triangular back, while every hair on its body stood erect thanks to the impossibly tight waist in its grasp.",
      "So compact was it, that the fingers of the monster's huge hands almost met each other on his belly, and beneath them it could feel its own epic member invading and retreating.",
      "Even after a host of savage attacks, the human ring gripping it remained defiantly tight, as if to demonstrate its owner's physical prowess.",
      "More and more laboured became the beast's breaths, as if the sheer overwhelming perfection of its new mate were challenging the strength of its blood-lust, testing its endurance.",
      "It lay back on the furs, lifting the Greek as it went, wanting him to ride its groin as if it were a horse at full gallop.",
      "Theseus took no prompting, bracing his hands on the beast's knees and bearing down hard onto the red-hot sceptre.",
      "Determined to be breached by every inch of it, he threw all the muscles of his majestic body into that quest.",
      "His bestial lover looked on snorting, watching his mighty back flexing and undulating from neck to buttocks.",
      "A few minutes in that position had the prince's untouched manhood streaming, almost the entirety of his shaft glazed with a clear viscous coating.",
      "Filled now with a fearless sexual daring, Theseus turned himself around on the demonic pillar, grunting as he felt it shift inside him, his manhood leaving a silvery trail on one of the Minotaur's enormous thighs.",
      "With palms braced either side of its naval, he rode it with even more vigour, meeting its aggressive stare with one of his own and scraping his fingernails against its furry belly.",
      "Both were near now.",
      "Their breaths growing more ragged and uneven with every passing minute.",
      "Theseus reached his arms back, bracing himself once more on the beast's thickset knees, his torso arching in a way that had his statuesque abdominals stretching long and tight, a bulge rising and falling beneath them with each of his full-bodied thrusts.",
      "Had anyone been standing in the doorway, they would have born witness to a spectacular, other-worldly sight.",
      "Two god-like male forms, silhouetted against the raging fire, their synchronised bodies burning in a sexual dance as hot as the flames themselves.",
      "Every vein protruding.",
      "Every muscle straining.",
      "Strong sinuous hips rising and falling towards each other, desperately crashing together like two racks of antlers.",
      "The moment had come.",
      "In a supreme act of physical union, they would climax together.",
      "Both heads flung back in unison, a groan and a roar echoing inside the hall and blending into a single deafening call.",
      "The Minotaur's searing seed burst into Theseus, a molten army pouring in through his broken gates, sacking the Athenian's insides and taking the Greek that one last step over the cliff edge.",
      "Heroic semen issued high into the air between them, raining down in a torrent onto the Minotaur's face, painting its hungry lips with thick, milky-white ropes.",
      "Each orgasm only fed the other, a demonic tongue snaking out to taste yet more of the hero's copious gift, while an excess of its own bestial seed spilled from the Greek's conquered hole and down the phallus from which it had erupted, greasing the shaft yet further for Theseus' ardent, still-unrelenting bodily thrusts.",
      "Like sword and scabbard, each male seemed made to fit the other, a feeling so perfect that neither stopped until both were utterly dry, with one last tired upwelling oozing from the Athenian before he collapsed exhausted onto the heaving chest beneath him.",
      "For a few long moments they lay there, one slipping from inside the other, the sound of softening breaths giving way to the crackle of the firewood.",
      "But fate would not allow them long to wallow in their post-coital glow, for these two demi-gods had shared each other's essence, and the result would fall beyond the imaginings of even the gods themselves.",
      "A sudden, violent spasm of their whole frames jolted Prince and beast out of their near-slumber.",
      "Against their will, some unknown force had them both leaping to their feet.",
      "Theseus stared in shock at the Minotaur, as much from seeing fear in its eyes for the first time as from the rebelling of their bodies.",
      "Dropping to their knees, their manhoods awoke again, rising fast until fiercely turgid.",
      "A heat grew in their shaking cores, building until it felt as if they had both swallowed the sun itself.",
      "Muscle-saddled spines arched hard, pushing their full chests high up into the air and their heads forcibly back, making Theseus' long locks spray sweat from the sudden motion.",
      "Both their mouths drew wide open, ready to provide the next other-worldly sight for the chamber to play host to.",
      "Columns of glowing blue smoke arose from within their throats, climbing high into the warm air of the hall, spiralling around each other and stirring up into a tempest.",
      "With greater and greater force it blew, picking up the burning logs of the fire, the animal skins and the food, until a whirlwind of cinders, furs and broken pottery raged around the calm eye in which they knelt.",
      "As the last wisps of godly energy slipped from their mouths, a blindingly bright ball of it gathered above their heads.",
      "Free of jolting spasms for just a moment, both were able to take in a few ragged breaths before the next supernatural act began.",
      "Two rivers of smoke shot from the glowing sphere, plunging head-long into their throbbing members.",
      "Their faces dropped, blank of expression, eyes rolling back to empty whiteness.",
      "Blind, and lost inside himself, Theseus felt nothing but the warm, now-familiar sense of being filled by the Minotaur.",
      "But it was not the beast's seed flooding him now.",
      "This most intimate of invasions was gifting each with the essence of the other, and would, as they would soon discover, bring changes in both that would surpass even the epic spectacle of their mating, The first the Athenian knew of it was the tingling in his fingertips.",
      "The digits swelled and lengthened, a carpet of brown hairs bursting from beneath the skin around his darkening fingernails.",
      "The toes on his feet melted together into glossy grey hoofs, pelt sprouting there too, all while his shins and ankles stretched contorted into new bovine joints.",
      "His whole frame engorged, waves of fur rising up his limbs and coating his swelling musculature.",
      "It crested his newly-swollen rump, a tail bursting snake-like from the root of his spine as the transformation engulfed his torso at the shoulders and hips.",
      "Dark nipples grew as large and prominent as shield bosses as each pectoral swelled into a mighty slab.",
      "The groans and gasps issuing from him collapsed into deeper, more guttural noises, the voice box that made them growing cruder in his thickening neck.",
      "High cheekbones and square mandible gave way to an even squarer, long-tongued muzzle.",
      "The wave of change reached the summit of his skull, sending two huge grey horns erupting out from under the scalp.",
      "Olympian magic completed its work with one final flourish, ending where it had begun.",
      "Veins swelled at the base of his twitching phallus, climbing like creepers up the lengthening shaft until his manhood was tall, thick, and with a fierce upward curve.",
      "The last remnants of the glowing orb evaporated, and with it the power of the tempest around them, the air shedding its debris onto the stone floor but leaving the perfect uncluttered circle around the two.",
      "Theseus dropped breathlessly onto his enormous new haunches.",
      "His vision returned, he peered down at the huge herm, jutting so high and proud from between his immense furry thighs that it almost touched his lips.",
      "By the gods...",
      "He tried to speak, but instead only animal rumblings came out.",
      "These changes would have amazed him more if he had been given time to dwell upon them, but a hand pressing against the crown of his head drew his thoughts away.",
      "Slowly, he looked up, those same fingertips sliding down his muzzle and the shocked features of his new bovine face.",
      "A vision even more unexpected than the sight of himself greeted his eyes.",
      "Muscular and handsome, a naked man with long, ice-white locks peered back at him.",
      "It can't be...",
      "Theseus shook his head, questioning his own senses, but it WAS him.",
      "It had to be.",
      "Those fire-red eyes.",
      "The nose ring now lying broken on the floor.",
      "It was the Minotaur, or at least that which used to be, now transfigured into an entirely new and just as spectacular being.",
      "They rose from the floor together, Theseus momentarily dizzied by how high he now towered over his lover.",
      "The Minotaur was now endowed with a warrior's body, as perfect as the Greek's old form.",
      "Finely-honed muscle and sweeping curves caught the moon rays coming through the doorway, dustings of white hair wonderfully accentuating the most intimate areas.",
      "The stare boring into his eyes was just as intense as before, only this time it emanated from a beautiful human face.",
      "Possessed with the creature's instincts yet somehow still himself, suddenly Theseus understood its nature completely.",
      "It's lust.",
      "Its passions.",
      "They all coursed through him now, honest, raw and unrefined.",
      "The Minotaur too had gained more than just a human form, and the first words it had even spoken would prove it to Theseus.",
      "\"Take me.\"",
      "The two demi-gods had shared each other's essence, and now, for the few hours of night still remaining, each would know sex through the other's eyes.",
      "Hard, breathless passion consumed them both, almost blending them into one being.",
      "The beast, who had taken so many men so wildly, revelled in being taken itself for the first time.",
      "And Theseus, once so noble and dignified, now let loose these unstoppable, animal urges at full force, pouring them into the Minotaur's unconquered human body with his enormous, pulsing member.",
      "Climax after bone-shaking climax flooded between them, bathing them inside and out.",
      "Each seemed utterly inexhaustible, and would, it seems have gone on forever, had not another powerful entity made its presence felt.",
      "With them both panting, arms and legs still holding on tightly, the first few rays of dawn reached over the walls of the maze and in through the doorway, falling bright on their steaming bodies.",
      "Its effect on Theseus was immediate.",
      "With the dawn chorus seeping into the chamber, his huge bovine bulk shrank, horns and fur vanishing smoothly into him until he was once again the handsome young prince who had set off from Athens what seemed like a lifetime ago.",
      "Still in the embrace of his unchanged lover, he looked into those deep vermilion eyes and whispered the name that would finally and forever bond the two, the name now burned into him, body and soul.",
      "\"...Asterion...\" There would be no killing today.",
      "No victorious Prince would walk from the Labyrinth with a bloodied bull's head to hold high in triumph.",
      "There had been a conquest thought, but both had been victorious, and now the two magnificent men, both born of the gods, departed the maze together, animal skins tied loosely around their hips for the galloping horseback ride to the coast.",
      "And so, turning their ship away from the shores of Crete, the cohorts headed out into the vast Aegean, calm and untroubled by Poseidon.",
      "The true story of their adventure would never be known to Greece, kept secret by a grateful band of brothers, honoured to call two demi-gods their friends.",
      "Only Theseus' triumph in the Labyrinth would be remembered by posterity.",
      "The heroic defeat of a hideous half-breed.",
      "No one would know that his encounter with the Minotaur had never ended.",
      "Would know that, so often, as the last of the twilight faded over the painted temples of Athens, he and his white-haired lover would journey high into the hills of Attica together.",
      "To become man or beast at will......and lock horns once again."

    "text": "It takes a few heartbeats for Odysseus to register the clear starry sky above and what it means. It's over. No more water tunnels, no more sneaking around in an enemy city. This war, while not yet won, has a very real chance of coming to an end. The Ithakan could have sworn he had not drawn a single breath during the whole mission. Now, he can bask in that luxury again. They did it. They did it, right? He looks at his friend. At the small wooden statue in his hands. At all the blood, unnaturally vivid despite the darkness. It is one thing to dispatch a temple guard before he can notify anyone else of the intruders. But touching a sacred xoanon with unclean hands so carelessly is entirely... There will be consequences, Laertiades knows. The stars see all. Akhaia is a step away from victory. A step away from its inevitable reckoning, too. How many steps to Ithake, then? And would Helle's sea not turn red once the Akhaian ships touch it? His head spins. It is full of blood, of knives, of poison. Necessary sacrifices, self-serving betrayals, sacrilegesacrilegesacrilege. His island home might as well be a world away. The nympholeptes, however, is right here, cawing madly, a promise of return on his lips - after twenty years. That voice never grew silent - not for Odysseus. And now, it is deafening and more real than anything. His fingers find the dagger hilt unconsciously. Grasp it. Draw the weapon. Prepare to strike. Reflected moonlight gleams oh. So. Brightly. A flash. Before the Ithakan knows it, he is incapacitated, arm twisted behind back painfully. That went about as well as could be expected. Just how fast is this bastard? Or was the attempt just that inept? - What in Tartaros came over you? - Diomedes demands. - Oh, take a wild guess. You expect such treatment of the Palladion to go unpunished merely because the Goddess favours us? - Laertiades, you know there was no time to approach it properly. - It doesn't matter. You're fucked. And so am I - just by association. That cold, steely gaze holds Odysseus' indignant one. A shower of icy water could not have been more sobering. Odysseus gulps. The blade of his own dagger is a finger's breadth from his throat. The younger man's tone is even - eerily so. - You are right, we are all fucked. So what? A shake of the head. At this point, he releases his hold on Odysseus. Surely the latter has reached his daily limit of absurd stunts. And so he has. Aside from a few very clumsy punches that are all too easy to block - the islander can normally throw better ones while drunk - he seems to have calmed down somewhat. Diomedes would have found the scene amusing - part of him still does - yet it is anything but. - We have hardly been throwing dice for ten years, have we? Reasons or no reasons, it is a bit too late to run from the consequences of our actions in this war. This is one drop in a sea of blood - and you think keeping up appearances would have fooled Nemesis? - Sometimes one drop is a drop too much. We were supposed to win. I was supposed to go back home. It was never supposed to be like... like this. Except, of course, Victory is all too often just. Like. This. The Argive covers his face with his hand, exasperated. So many words, but they barely make sense even to Odysseus himself. They have given the Gods far better reasons to be angry than today's impiety. What is driving the Ithakan insane is something else entirely. -...That prophecy you were given in the cave of the Nymphs. It's eroding your sanity. A weak nod. Forget ten years of bloody battle. What comes after can sometimes be worse. - Odysseus, this is not the time. Right now, we have a job to do. You will deal with the next obstacle - if the prophecy is even correct - once you reach it. - I'm a human being, and I've kept myself in one piece for far too long. I am allowed to break. - Broken things can often be restored. But for now... - What? What now? I can't fight my own bloody shadow. Why should I, even? - Because giving up is not an option. Because no matter how much you panic along the way, you still always persevere in the end. He lowers the dagger now. Pauses a while. - You want to be next, Ithakan? You want to drown in that garbage the weakest part of you keeps spewing? Odysseus has decided the ground is endlessly fascinating. He knows all too well what \"next\" means. No need for elaboration. Far too many have lost to Lyssa - men who could match any enemy, who seemed invincible until... He would have liked to say this has nothing to do with him. Before tonight, he probably could have mouthed the words. Not anymore. - Why not? I probably should. Better men than I have. The ruler of Argos mutters a few distinctly Aitolian curses. They have tarried too long here. Then: - Get. Your. Act. Together. Now. You can freak out back in camp. Move. An order. Fine. Laertiades complies. There is a part of him that is relieved to do so. Another must be too exhausted to resist, or too intimidated, perhaps. But, first and foremost, he has decided this is not the way he wants to meet his end. Not so close to victory. Not on such a beautiful night. Not by his own dagger. Not by a friend's hand. Suddenly, Odysseus finds himself laughing. This friend had just been a few heartbeats from killing him. With full justification, too. Half of the reason the Ithakan managed to survive this far is that he had been given far too many second chances. His stride is still not confident - but it's getting there. Now, if only those stupid hands stopped trembling, and he could find the voice for an apology... On second thought, no. Not now. If he is going to ask for forgiveness - he had better mean every word. For the time being, he can be an obedient little sheep and march towards the damned camp without complaining. Amuse himself with pretending fear of the bronze... goad, so to speak. The shepherd understands. Far too perceptive for anyone's good, crows take him. - Listen, this will pass. The war. Whatever waits for you after. You will be back to... if not yourself, at least to someone who knows where he belongs. - Some other Odysseus, huh? Sounds about right. If my current idiotic self tries to reach home, a decade will not be enough. And so, to the camp they go. Small steps. Excruciatingly small, to be honest. But the son of Laertes is once again slipping away from Lyssa's talons. He touches the Palladion at some point. Gingerly, with much more fear than warranted, considering his companion has been handling the xoanon just fine. Well, there is no smiting involved. Must be a good sign. Or a terrible one. Diomedes returns the dagger, of course. Not that his friend knows what to do with the piece of bronze. It's an eyesore. For no rational reason, but still. The Ithakan wants to throw it away. Then, he wants to keep it - and all the attendant memories. Eventually, he decides to haul the weapon around until the shores of that island with the sweetest name in existence greet him. He doesn't, of course. The dagger is lost somewhere between Skylla and Kharybdis, if not earlier. But, after the longest time, Ithake does welcome her wayward king. The seagulls laugh in a familiar language, and he can begin mending what is broken and see what happens.",

    "text": "\"Death has been at my door a little more than I would like as of late,\" Hestia says over a steaming mug of tea. It billows out steam that fogs the window she sits next to. Little tendrils of ivy crawl up the walls, both inside and out. The room around them is cozy. Framed pictures of numerous gods, goddesses and heroes that had come to visit her over the millennia hang on the walls. Potted plants hang from the ceiling, crowd her shelves along with odd knickknacks and old tomes and still more pictures. Several candles are lit and dance merrily. The seats they sat on were accompanied with an odd mix of cushions of varied colors and shapes and Persephone relaxed into them as she listens to her friend speak. The reason Hestia was in her own home talking to none other than Persephone was because, well. Persephone, if she was one thing, was open. She was a bridge, a path, a way through and if there was something Hestia needed of late, it was that. She was also very, very close to death in that it came naturally to her through her... circumstances. She wasn't anywhere near as flighty or adverse to the topic as some of the nature and life centered deities could be. \"He comes to me late in the night, always the night, to talk about his job,\" Hestia says, resting her cheek glumly into the palm of her hand. Yes, Death had many names and titles and all that sordid pomp, but when they had first met he had said \"Please, call me Death\" and Hestia had never been one to run counter to other's desires. That is also why night after night she lets him in with his hood up and his shoulders hunched with some sort of invisible weight. It is in her very nature to never leave anyone out to the cold and maybe that is why she is the place Death seems to have found his niche. \"What does he say?\" \"He tells me it is too much of late, there is a little too much tragedy for death, can you imagine? I get he is still quite green at the job after a few thousand years, but still,\" Hestia clasped both hands to her mug and felt the warmth between her palms and watched the vapor rise in swirls that clenched and unclenched and then dissipate into the air as she mulled on her thoughts. \"He starts to tell me about his day, he first tells me about the old mother he visited, told me about how she was ready to go, but how her son wasn't. Talks about the sounds he made, the anguish, the grief. He tells me about the ones that pass gently in rooms full of loved ones, the ones that die fitfully alone in the cold. And every mix in between. Then he tells me about the young baby, it was this wee thing, only alive for an hour he said...,\" Hestia trails off and she feels her eyes prickle and she doesn't know who the tears are for. Death was curious in a way. He seemed to be long past the time of the great Greek Theatrics that even the Lord of the Underworld himself wasn't over. When he told his story he told it plainly. In a flat monotone that betrayed no emotions. He would come every night and tell those stories, he would stand, he would thank her, and then he would leave and when he walked out the door the darkness of the night seemed to greet him and when he left a veil of sorrow seemed to lay across Hestia's home. The morning dew had come like teardrops on the grass. She had always had the hearth lit before death started coming, but it wasn't until he started coming that the hearth began to feel vital to her in a way it had never been. It was on the nights he came and went that she huddled closer to the fire and felt it thaw out the deep-set cold that had creeped into her while they had their chat. She struggled with the feeling that her talks with Death weren't doing much but rerouting an unceasing tide instead of easing it. \"Why you? Have you ever asked him why he comes to you?\" Persephone asked as she slid her hands across the table to intertwine her fingers in Hestia's. Hestia hadn't realized she had been staring out the window without speaking for quite a while. \"I've never asked him much of anything, aside from the stories he tells, neither of us speak much,\" Hestia says. \"When he comes I say 'welcome', when he leaves, he says thank you and I say goodbye.\" \"Why do you let him in if it bothers you so much?\" Hestia thinks on that for a long moment. \"It comes with my job and my nature, I am the goddess of the home, and every night, the weariest traveler in the world shows up on my doorstep. How could I turn him away?\" \"Would it make you feel any better if I sat through the night with you and met him?\" Persephone asks. Hestia looks at her in stunned disbelief, \"Meet him? Have you not been listening to what I have been saying? Why would you ever want to do that?\" \"It would probably make you feel better and I like meeting new people,\" Persephone says, finishing the sentence with a contented smile. Hestia glances at the window where weak light is streaming in. She really does not want another long night alone with Death, no. She looks at Persephone with her long hair falling in tresses and spread out all around her on the seat and cushions and peace radiating out from her expression. Persephone was like light itself in a way, persistent yet soft. \"I feel like he would enjoy meeting you for some reason,\" Hestia said as she squinted at her friend. \"Well, let's find out!\" Persephone said, clasping her hands together and looking eager. The other gods and goddesses had often whispered about how Persephone was the strange one of their kind. The odd one out, the black sheep. Hestia could see why, but at the same time, she felt it wasn't a bad thing. Far from it. They spend the rest of their fading daylight together and some of the evening. Hestia lights her fire and gets Persephone a cup of tea and keeps the kettle simmering for Death as she always poured him a cup as well when he came about. Close to midnight a soft knock comes on the door and Hestia gets up to open it. Death steps inside with a soft, \"Thank you.\" He finds his usual spot occupied by Persephone so for a moment Death stands awkwardly before Hestia bustles over again with his mug in hand and gestures to her spot. Death is seated and Hestia finds herself next to Persephone. She slides Death's mug across the table to him where he does what he usually does, holds it. Night after night, he holds the mug from time of arrival to time of departure. It never once moves from its spot on the table and by the time she collects it up again the tea is always cold, regardless of whether Death stays five minutes or five hours. Persephone looks at him with her gentle kind eyes and smiles softly. She turns over Death's own hand with hers and taps it. A seed appears in his hand, sprouts, grows with roots that spread in gentle deltas crawling and splitting and weaving their way across his palm as the stalk of the plant grows taller and taller until a bud appears. It swells and swells and little white petals appear one at a time and then many as the bud keeps swelling and then finally bursts into a daisy. Persephone's hands leave Death's and he sits there and as he does the daisy starts to shrivel and wither and crumble and at the very end of it, Death is left with a handful of dry, dead bits which he closes his fists around. He holds them a moment. When he reaches across the table towards Persephone, Hestia is surprised to see the small tremor in his hand. He opens his fist into Persphone's waiting palm and out fall the crumble of dead plant. This time, several sprouts of daisies arise in Persephone's hand before she closes it. \"So, how was your day?\" Persephone asks to break the gathering silence in the room. Death starts in his monotone to talk of others. \"I understand how their day was, pretty bad, but how was yours?\" Persephone insists. \"We also saw those people down in the underworld, but when you ask me about my day, I say things like 'Well today I saw a dog and that made me happy' or 'Hades gave me pomegranate juice for breakfast, that guy'\" Persephone says with a mimed nudge and a wink. Death is quiet a long moment. So long Hestia thinks he is angry or upset he was interrupted. After the long pause, in a quiet, thoughtful voice, Death says, \"I like dogs.\" \"Oh really? What is your favorite kind? I like the little wiener ones that waddle when they walk,\" Persephone gushes. \"Err, I like the black and tan ones with the smushed face,\" Death says and then draws a little swirl in the air, \"and the curly tail.\" \"Pugs!\" Persephone says bouncing up and down, \"Oh, I love those ones too!\" \"They die awfully fast though,\" Death says. \"We have boatloads of them cross the Styx.\" \"Oh but you love them while they are here and they are just the best,\" Persephone barrels on. \"Hmm yes...\" Death says and then is quiet a long moment again. Hestia does not think any oracle on whatever high mountain could have prepared her for the sentence next to come out of Death's mouth. \"Perhaps I should get a dog.\" Persephone squeals and reaches out to clasp Death's hands. \"You should, you should. I have one or three. Not sure how the math works out on that one but, I have a dogs and it is great.\" They talk long into the night about the best things about dogs, how to train them, how to keep them from chewing Death's robes. By the time Death is rising to go, Persephone is falling off his robes talking about dogs and how good they are at fetching and how she still hasn't even gotten Hades to fetch. Death thanks them and in the shifting shadows under that hood Hestia is sure she catches the ghost of a smile as he turns and goes and the door shuts and she is left with the feeling that for once all the light has remained within her house. \"Persephone, how in the gods names did you do that?\" Hestia says staring at her friend dumbfounded. Persephone shrugs, \"Well you know, I make friends with anyone and he seemed very sweet just stuck in a funk.\" \"Stuck in a funk,\" Hestia says faintly. Endless nights of doom and gloom and a deep introspective look at the ephemeralness of human life and all she had to do to get off that topic and have a suitable guest was talk about dogs. Persephone flicks her hair over her shoulder and smiles at her friend warmly, \"Tell him he is welcome to come visit me if you ever get tired of having a nightly guest.\" Hestia takes her up on that offer, to give herself a few nights of respite for the first time in... she can't even fathom how long. Death only occasionally reappears on her doorstep, this time with abundant photos of his new dog, one of which goes up on Hestia's wall. He finds himself spending his nights with other gods and goddesses as Persephone introduces him and helps him get around to bonding with other immortals over various niche interests. As time goes on, Death treads the earth with notably more spring in his step.",

      "Close to midnight a soft knock comes on the door and Hestia gets up to open it.",
      "Death steps inside with a soft, \"Thank you.\"",
      "He finds his usual spot occupied by Persephone so for a moment Death stands awkwardly before Hestia bustles over again with his mug in hand and gestures to her spot.",
      "Death is seated and Hestia finds herself next to Persephone.",
      "She slides Death's mug across the table to him where he does what he usually does, holds it.",
      "Night after night, he holds the mug from time of arrival to time of departure.",
      "It never once moves from its spot on the table and by the time she collects it up again the tea is always cold, regardless of whether Death stays five minutes or five hours.",
      "Persephone looks at him with her gentle kind eyes and smiles softly.",
      "She turns over Death's own hand with hers and taps it.",
      "A seed appears in his hand, sprouts, grows with roots that spread in gentle deltas crawling and splitting and weaving their way across his palm as the stalk of the plant grows taller and taller until a bud appears.",
      "It swells and swells and little white petals appear one at a time and then many as the bud keeps swelling and then finally bursts into a daisy.",
      "Persephone's hands leave Death's and he sits there and as he does the daisy starts to shrivel and wither and crumble and at the very end of it, Death is left with a handful of dry, dead bits which he closes his fists around.",
      "He holds them a moment.",
      "When he reaches across the table towards Persephone, Hestia is surprised to see the small tremor in his hand.",
      "He opens his fist into Persphone's waiting palm and out fall the crumble of dead plant.",
      "This time, several sprouts of daisies arise in Persephone's hand before she closes it.",
      "\"So, how was your day?\" Persephone asks to break the gathering silence in the room.",
      "Death starts in his monotone to talk of others.",
      "\"I understand how their day was, pretty bad, but how was yours?\" Persephone insists.",
      "\"We also saw those people down in the underworld, but when you ask me about my day, I say things like 'Well today I saw a dog and that made me happy' or 'Hades gave me pomegranate juice for breakfast, that guy'\" Persephone says with a mimed nudge and a wink.",
      "Death is quiet a long moment.",
      "So long Hestia thinks he is angry or upset he was interrupted.",
      "After the long pause, in a quiet, thoughtful voice, Death says, \"I like dogs.\"",
      "\"Oh really?",
      "What is your favorite kind?",
      "I like the little wiener ones that waddle when they walk,\" Persephone gushes.",
      "\"Err, I like the black and tan ones with the smushed face,\" Death says and then draws a little swirl in the air, \"and the curly tail.\"",
      "\"Pugs!\"",
      "Persephone says bouncing up and down, \"Oh, I love those ones too!\"",
      "\"They die awfully fast though,\" Death says.",
      "\"We have boatloads of them cross the Styx.\"",
      "\"Oh but you love them while they are here and they are just the best,\" Persephone barrels on.",
      "\"Hmm yes...\" Death says and then is quiet a long moment again.",
      "Hestia does not think any oracle on whatever high mountain could have prepared her for the sentence next to come out of Death's mouth.",
      "\"Perhaps I should get a dog.\"",
      "Persephone squeals and reaches out to clasp Death's hands.",
      "\"You should, you should.",
      "I have one or three.",
      "Not sure how the math works out on that one but, I have a dogs and it is great.\"",
      "They talk long into the night about the best things about dogs, how to train them, how to keep them from chewing Death's robes.",
      "By the time Death is rising to go, Persephone is falling off his robes talking about dogs and how good they are at fetching and how she still hasn't even gotten Hades to fetch.",
      "Death thanks them and in the shifting shadows under that hood Hestia is sure she catches the ghost of a smile as he turns and goes and the door shuts and she is left with the feeling that for once all the light has remained within her house.",
      "\"Persephone, how in the gods names did you do that?\"",
      "Hestia says staring at her friend dumbfounded.",
      "Persephone shrugs, \"Well you know, I make friends with anyone and he seemed very sweet just stuck in a funk.\"",
      "\"Stuck in a funk,\" Hestia says faintly.",
      "Endless nights of doom and gloom and a deep introspective look at the ephemeralness of human life and all she had to do to get off that topic and have a suitable guest was talk about dogs.",
      "Persephone flicks her hair over her shoulder and smiles at her friend warmly, \"Tell him he is welcome to come visit me if you ever get tired of having a nightly guest.\"",
      "Hestia takes her up on that offer, to give herself a few nights of respite for the first time in... she can't even fathom how long.",
      "Death only occasionally reappears on her doorstep, this time with abundant photos of his new dog, one of which goes up on Hestia's wall.",
      "He finds himself spending his nights with other gods and goddesses as Persephone introduces him and helps him get around to bonding with other immortals over various niche interests.",
      "As time goes on, Death treads the earth with notably more spring in his step."

    "text": "I walk on bare feet. It's not because I believe it to be more comfortable, because it's really not. Small stones, hot sand, wood... I have to. I can't see. I can't see the large rock in front of me. And I can survive like this. It's difficult, because I can't work and no man wants me. Not that I want a man. I have no interest in men. I can feel a storm rising. I can sense the lowering temperature, so nightfall is probably near. I have been like this for seventeen years. Seventeen years of not seeing a single thing. My father and sister, who I lived with, died three years back. I've lived on by myself, begging for single scraps of bread. I know I'm malnourished. Whenever I touch my chest, I just feel my ribs poking out. My dress is ripped, uneven. Its beautiful whites have probably turned brown in my travels. It's the last thing my father had given me before his death. A horse neighs. I'm on a path, I think. A man grunts. Something tugs at my hair. I wince, trying to get away. He's stronger than me. A cry rips from my throat. The man laughs. I can hear him. Tears are in my eyes and I'm shaking. I'm scared. People have been trying to kill me for years, since I'm useless blind. These past years I have been fleeing, running from everything, everyone. I can't defend myself. Then everything's quiet. I tilt my head and reach above, to where the man held my hair. I only feel stone. I twist my head in different directions. \"Don't look at me, I'll turn you to stone too,\" a feminine voice says. She sounds closeby. Close enough, in fact, to gently pull my hair from the stone man's grip. I smile. \"Thank you for saving me,\" I murmur, trying to face the lady who saved me. \"Don't look at me,\" she insists. I reach out. My fingertips touch a soft shoulder, cloth draped over it. I trail my fingers down her arm and grasp her hand. She doesn't move. \"I can't. I'm blind,\" I say gently. Her fingers curl around mine, almost protectively. Her other hand touches my forehead, traces the long scars over my eyes, forehead and cheek. I close my eyes. \"Does it hurt?\" she asks, pausing and looking for permission. \"No. I have been like this for most of my life.\" Her fingers continue along the rough scars, touch featherlight. She doesn't wish to hurt me, unlike many others I have met. \"My name is Charissa,\" I introduce myself. A huff of amusement passes her lips, and I can feel it on my face. I hadn't even realized how close she was standing. \"Medusa. Do you want to come with me? I have food,\" she says. \"I haven't eaten in two days,\" I say, giggling a bit. \"I'd love to.\" Medusa doesn't release my hand as she leads me along the shore. It's like she's afraid the sea will take me with. Like Poseidon will claim me. I am worth nothing to the gods. Sure, I pray, but if the representatives of the gods on earth had any say in it I would be long gone. Disposed of the moment they realized I would never be able to see anymore. A door creaks, and I can already feel myself warming up as I step inside the cabin. Medusa steps arounds me and closes the door, before she releases my hand and walks away. Presumably to get food. When the table is set, she grabs my hand again and leads me toward it. The smell of food reaches my nose, and I release a relieved sigh. The chair scratches against the wooden floor as she pulls it back for me. Medusa gently leads me into the seat. I sit down and turn myself toward the food. She helps me. She hands me a piece of bread, she puts wine in a cup and wraps my fingers around it. She lets her own fingers stay curled around mine for a little, her warmth seeping into my cold body. She treats me like royalty. \"What happened to the man who grabbed me?\" I ask quietly. I try to show in my voice that she doesn't have to answer, but somewhere I know she will. As I chew on some bread, she speaks up. \"Athena herself cursed me. Everyone who looks at me is turned to stone. That is why I didn't want you to look at me,\" she says. She sounds calm, though there's a deep regret somewhere in her beautiful voice. \"Why did she curse you?\" I ask, my voice barely above a whisper. She piqued my curiosity. It's quiet, and for a moment I think she's not going to answer. \"Poseidon forced himself onto me in her temple. Athena does not listen to reason. I was too beautiful, she said.\" \"Well, I think you're beautiful,\" I say, trying to lighten the mood. Medusa laughs. I love her laugh already. \"You can't see, though.\" \"You have a beautiful voice,\" I continue. I feel myself shying away from adding a flirtatious tone, but really, it is unneeded. She stutters for a bit. \"Thank you. You look beautiful,\" she then states. I giggle again. -- I stay with Medusa. She helps me learn how to take control of my life. I help her through hard times. I love her. I love the way she laughs when I say something funny. I love the way she somehow can't figure out her words when I compliment her. I love how she traces her fingers along my scar like I'm the most fragile piece of art in existence. I love resting my head against her shoulder and feeling it move up and down slowly as she breathes. I love the way she crawls with me into bed, unafraid. I love her. -- We stand in the waves. The water laps at my knees. Medusa is holding onto my arms, and I can only imagine her bright smile because I know she's smiling. I want to see the way her eyes twinkle. I want to see her grinning at me. She releases one arm, hooks it around my waist instead. She tugs me closer as the storm rages on. My hair is in my face. She releases my other arm and brushes the strands from my face, pushing her fingers into my hair like a clip. Her palm is pressed against my jaw, her thumb gently running over my temple. I touch her wrist with my hand and trail my fingers up until I can wrap my arm around her neck, my other quickly joining it. She leans forward, her forehead pressed against mine. She continues until our bodies are pressed together. She tilts her head and touches my lips with her own. I feel starved. I reach for her, try to get her closer. I kiss her back like I'm about to lose her to the wild waves and strong wind around us. Every single one of her touches is featherlight and yet desperate. It's not a dream. It's not perfect. It's with her, though. That's all I want. -- It's stormy. I'm naked. Medusa is pressing lazy kisses to my shoulder and throat, any spot she can reach with me laying half on top of her. It's nice. I'm happy. \"Medusa!\" I hear a man call. I hold my breath. Not many know her name. Not many know where she lives, even less come here without the intent to kill her. I take my white gown off the floor and pull it on. The bed creaks. Medusa is moving too. She kisses me, desperate. Even she seems to think this is the end. I don't want to believe it. I'm not going to believe it. She's not dying. Not here, not now. \"Medusa?\" I whisper, my hand on her arm and not letting her go. I know she pauses. The motion under my hand stops. She takes my free hand in hers. \"Charissa, my Love, my Dearest. I love you so much,\" she says. She presses a kiss to my lips, to my forehead, back to my lips. \"I love you too...\" I know I sound terrified. I know I'm shaking. I know tears wet my cheeks, I know she's pulling me into her arms and hugging my tightly for what may be the last time. I love her so much. She presses another desperate kiss to my lips. Someone knocks on the door. Rather, he nearly smashes it with the force of his hits. I wince. Medusa releases me and walks past me to chase away the man. I can hear her losing. I run outside, desperate to protect her. The man's blade pierces my abdomen. I have never felt pain like this. Never. I can hear Medusa cry out to me. \"Charissa!\" she yells, throwing herself in front of me. I smile. \"I love you.\" I see her. I see her. I wake up and I blink and I see a pair of eyes watching me. \"Chari?\" she asks. It's still the same gentle voice I got used to living with her. I reach out and press my hand against her cheek. \"You're beautiful,\" I whisper, undoubtedly smiling. She really is. I want to grab her and kiss every inch of her beautiful face. Her eyes shift from my face to our surroundings, before she looks back at me. \"You can see?\" she asks. I nod. A surprised laugh leaves her lips, and she presses her forehead against my shoulder. \"You're beautiful,\" I repeat. It still feels weird. I haven't seen anything since I was nine. And then she's looming over me and kissing me and I close my eyes and I feel alive despite it being clear I no longer am. But she's here and I can see and I'm not stone, so we're fine. We're alright.",

    "text": "You watch the sunrise over the courtyard from the roof of the main dorm building. The cool morning breeze lifts some of the curls from your shoulders and you shiver just a touch at the caress. Fleetingly you think of strong fingers doing the same, how good it would feel... Off to your left one of the rooster's crow from the livestock section. Everything would slowly awake now, interrupting your quiet reprieve. You loved the women here, really you did. But there were times you dreamed of just being able to be alone. No one asking anything of you, no one calling for aid, just... being. Gods had duties though. Mother always made that clear to you. The price they paid for their seeming immortality and power. Service. The other gods seemed to attain some kind of satisfaction from the service they provided to humans though. You never truly felt that though, going through the motions day after day always feeling like you were missing something. Sighing you stand on the edge of the roof and jump the few stories to the ground below. Another day. Like hundreds before it. You hate this feeling of dissatisfaction that's been growing since Danielle's death. Her son had been sent off to the nearest House of Ares yesterday. Just five days old. Logically you knew he would be loved and cared for, they all were. But he would also be trained to be a warrior. A life filled with training and combat and... death. The beginning and ending of all things. It didn't matter. Shoving your hands in the pockets of your long skirt you pass through the garden, too scared to touch anything since the apple incident. You'd even been avoiding your duties in the lab and greenhouse. Secluding yourself every moment you could. If that had happened around Mother... What exactly would she have done? What could she have done? Maybe it was normal, just some odd misdirected surge of energy... no. You knew to your marrow that wasn't it. \"Daughter,\" Mother's voice reaches you as you turn out of the garden toward the vegetable plots. Damn. She's shrouded in a faint mist of power as she stands in a recently tilled plot, at her command, the freshly planted tomatoes grow up their stakes, green fruit already swelling. Life throbs around her in thick ropes of bright light. It's beautiful. Always beautiful. Just like the other night though you smell the rot in the ground, the necessary decay to allow life to thrive... \"Morning, Mother.\" \"Come,\" she extends a perfectly sculpted hand to you. Another time you would have happily taken her invitation. Thrilled at the chance to create new life from, seemingly, nothing. Now you stare at it. Unable to allow yourself. \"Kore. Come,\" this time it's less a request and more an order. The shift in her tone and demeanor clear. She is your Mother but also your superior. Honor bound to obey, your feet move without consulting your own desires and your hand clasps hers. You hate this. Hate your lack of will. \"I haven't seen much of you these past days. You seem troubled my child,\" the space between your hand's prickles with static instead of flowing with mutual power. Rather than answer you try to focus on letting the life flow through you. \"It's nothing, Mother.\" Her grip tightens, \"Look at me, darling.\" You do as she asks, not because it's a command but because of the tenderness in her tone. \"I know it is hard to see them suffer. You believe it is unfair that their fate should be so fragile while we remain.\" It wasn't all of it. Hardly scratched the surface. But you supposed it was close enough. The humans were fragile, nothing you could do for them would alter that. \"All young gods feel this pain. We continue on as they fade. But this sorrow is for someone else to bear my child.\" Your eyes narrow. \"We all have a place in this world. For some it's to shelter knowledge, others to cultivate beauty, love, war. We are blessed to have been gifted with the task of nurturing life.\" The same old story. You're not in the mood for it. Looking away you attempt to pull from her grasp, instead, she tightens her grasp on your hand, so tight it almost hurts. You glare back at her. \"Do not think I don't notice the coins you slip them, daughter. Or how you linger as they leave our realm of responsibility.\" A darkness slips behind your Mother's eyes that you don't know you've ever seen before. \"It's normal for one young as you to forget her place. However, you stray too far from the path my child. This world is in a new age, we must shepherd it. Each guiding the sheep they are given, nothing more.\" Silence hangs. \"Do you understand what I'm telling you, Kore? I have allowed you these follies and morose moods for some time. No more.\" Her free hand gestures to the other plots, flinging a wave of power causing the plants to perk up, their crops swelling a bit at the goddesses' gift. \"We shepherd life.\" She releases you and steps away, her look, bidding you to finish making the crop grow. Taking a deep breath you focus on the life. Low panic thrumming in the back of your mind but you do your best to ignore it. Life. She wants to see you do this. You must do this. The same light that flowed from her streams from you. It curls down into the soil to the roots of the plants, thrumming up the fragile stalks and filling the fruit, willing it to thrive. \"Beautiful, Kore. Beautiful.\" Your eyes open and she is beaming at you. \"We are blessed among the gods my darling. Be thankful.\" \"Yes, Mother.\" You don't trust your own tongue to say anything else. There's a tremor working it's way up your spine. Deep in your gut, something hurts, aches so deep you think you may scream. Still, you force a smile. Mother nods and begins to walk away. \"I expect you in the lab in an hour, Kore.\" With that, she turns, heading toward the greenhouse on the other side of the dorm. As soon as she's out of sight you drop to your knees and plunge your shaking hands into the soil. What is this?! Your panicked mind is spinning. Hands digging in the dark soil of their own volition, desperately. For what? A voice in the back of your head whispers, \"Give it to me.\" And another wave of panic crashes into you. Have you ever felt this before? Felt this horror? This... fear? No. You couldn't remember ever knowing fear before... \"Stop,\" you say, speaking to your own body. \"Please stop,\" you hiss trying not to scream as you hands shovel dirt and rocks, reaching into the earth. Closing your eyes you try to focus on the light of the life around you, this is what you were made for after all. Mother had just said it. Shepherding life. Maybe if you focused on that you could get control of your body. It pulses around you, all these tendrils of life from the new little tomato plants. Then... just like with the apple they begin to snap. The life flowing like Ichor hot and bright out of them back into the ground. The shock of it makes your hands stop. They cover your mouth, holding the scream in. Trembling you sit back on your ankles and stare at the dead tomato plants surrounding you, falling to dust. Frantically you look around. Desperately hoping no one has just seen you. A bit of the panic recedes when you realize you're alone. Just as you breathe you see the sway of skirts in the shadow cast by the dorm. Maybe it was a trick of the light but you could have sworn there was a woman there, a hood covering her face. You bolt toward the woman. Intending to beg her silence. When you arrive on the spot there's nothing. A strange laugh slips from your lips as you lean into the wall. Your heart is thundering, veins glowing golden as the Ichor pumps quickly through your body. Could gods go mad? You had seen humans suffer from it. Seeing things that weren't there, their fragile minds breaking down. The thought fills you once more with fear, this strange new emotion. But there's something else just beneath it, something you haven't felt in such a long time. Excitement. - The bike roars between James' thighs. His brother's mocked this primitive mode of transportation, preferring to travel in more... godly ways such as just appearing or taking to the sky. James preferred sticking close to the ground, plus he liked the time alone it afforded him. This was his favorite bike. Anthony may have mocked him but he couldn't resist a project. The clunky Harley had been reworked, powered by one of his brothers lightening arc batteries, fitted in such a way to maintain the thunderous sound, Anthony appreciated loud things after all. The color? Bright white. When he'd originally scoffed at the choice Anthony told him, \"There's some modern human myth about death riding a white horse and if you insist on getting around like a mortal you may as well make a statement.\" That was his brother for you. Despite it being his less than favorite color he loved how it rode, sailing over broken and brittle roadways like they were nothing. Passing through ghost town after ghost town in a flash. His destination was just outside what was once Minneapolis. Unlike many cities in the wasteland that was the midwestern United States, those close to the Great Lakes had survived... enough. At the very least they were healing faster than other regions. In another hundred or so years they would bear little scars of the cataclysm that brought the gods here. For now, though they sustained life better than most. That also meant they were hotbeds of unrest. Humans were pack animals, after all, all vying for their own slice of what was left of the habitable land on the continent. Because of this, the region was riddled with war. Each faction with their Children of Ares and Athena taking the front lines. Every battle bloody until one faction was left shattered. To the winner the spoils. While the gods usually let the humans sort themselves out when one of their own got involved... well, it was best someone take care of it... quickly. Demi-gods who didn't understand their place could plant distrust in the humans. Distrust could lead to an uprising, and no one had the time for that. Not to mention the more followers these half breed gods attained, the stronger they became. That benefitted no one. He can just see the encampment on the horizon. They had been here for a while. Tents and ramshackle homes spreading out for about a mile until they hit the 20-foot walls. At a glance, they seemed to be your standard shoddy defense walls most of these settlements managed to cobble together if they lasted long enough, mainly corrugated metal and barbed wire. As he gets closer though James can see turrets, advanced for these parts, at the top. Tendrils of electricity snake up the metal encasing the wall here and there, interesting- A blast slams into the tarmac directly in front of his bike. James reacts in an instant jerking the bike to the left, using his metal arm to steady the skid, just barely missing disaster. The bike stops and he looks back. The ground is molten hot, steaming as it cools. He sighs, this wasn't a good sign. \"Impressive isn't it?\" A voice bellows from the direction of the wall. He turns back to see a large man, long golden strawberry hair pulled on top of his head, shoulders incredibly broad, arms like a... blacksmith. \"I may not know my father but I seem to have inherited his affinity for weapons.\" James feels his chest tighten. Heph was his favorite nephew, he loved him like a son, how could he be so reckless... like his father. Damnit. James holds his hands up, allowing his great-nephew and the horde of people behind him to approach and surround him. As he looks at this nephew he can see bits of Hephaestus there. The eyes, the set of the shoulders, but the swagger and pompous smile makes him think of the boy's grandfather. His blood boils. Steven may have been honest about being too busy to handle this one but Anthony... he knew exactly who's child this was. Bastard. \"Struck speechless? I do seem to have that effect,\" the crowd snickers a little in response. Very much like his grandfather. \"So, who the hell are you supposed to be?\" James' eyebrows raise at this. He studies the boy for a sign of dishonesty but he genuinely seems to not know or realize. A woman standing to the back right of the boy glances at him in shock before looking back to James, concern darkening her features. \"Why don't you ask your friend there,\" James gestures to the woman, \"she seems to know exactly who I am.\" She takes a half step back as the boy turns to her. \"Nate,\" she hisses, \"That's the Winter fucking Soldier.\" James winces at the title. When the gods awoke it was to an earth in the grip of a monstrous man-made winter. Discombobulated and confused they lashed out at the humans and each other. No one really remembered what sparked their fight but it only lasted a few weeks before they seemed to get a hold of themselves, remembering who and what they were. It was a haze in James' mind. Once in control of themselves, they ended the winter that had encapsulated the earth. Now it had been nearly a century and the only thing to bring cold to a land of perpetual spring was death. Hence the human's title for him. The boy looks back to James, his freckled face filled with rage and shadows. \"I prefer James. Hades will also do in a pinch.\" Nate sneers, \"Are you the leader of these people, Nate?\" \"He is our king!\" A man to the back left of Nate bellows, taking a confident step forward, \"And you should approach him with respect.\" The man places himself between James and Nate, chin up, stance defiant. James can't help the small smile that rises to his face. \"Ah,\" he slips out of the leather jacket he wore and tosses it over the bike. The sun catches the gold banding on his left arm. \"Tell me, since you're so well versed in the matter, how should one king address another?\" James grips the man's chin in his left hand, staring intently into his eyes. Fear fills them. Staring at death was unsettling to all humans. The man whimpers and the acrid smell of piss fills his nose. \"I think that's the wrong answer.\" He flings the man to the left, unharmed save for his pride. \"Do you have a place we can talk?\" James has no interest in harming this boy. If he can rectify this situation without violence he will. \"This doesn't need to be a fight.\" Nate glances to the man and back to James, \"I always thought you'd be bigger. Now here you are and I gotta say, it's kind of underwhelming.\" James shrugs, not taking the bait, secretly amused at the thought of what Anthony would have done had the boy said that to him. Scratching his chin Nate looks around to his people. \"Oh well,\" he reaches back and plucks what seems to be an empty hilt from his waistband. With a flick a blade about two feet long unfurls and locks into place, blue tendrils of energy pulsing up it. He roars as he takes a swing at James. Sighing, James catches the blade in his left hand, the sound of metal on metal grating. He looks at the impressive weapon, wondering where the boy was able to craft something like this. \"I don't want to hurt you,\" James says looking at his great nephew. The boy simply pulls back and takes a warrior's stance. The crowd around them has spread out but boldly looks on. He lunges once again and James deflects, \"Please, we can discuss-\" \"I have nothing to say to someone like you!\" Nate bellows as another blow pings off James' arm. His brows knit. Grabbing the blade and brings his opponent close. Growling he says, \"You know nothing of me boy.\" He bashes his head into his nose. Nate stumbles back clutching at his bloody broken nose. He straightens leveling a glare at James, \"I am no boy! I'm a man of some 90 years. I've watched as you so-called gods, build your new Olympus,\" he spits blood from his mouth, wiping at the gold-tinged red coating his face. \"Feigning benevolence while you feed off humanity like leaches!\" \"And you think you're better than us?\" James gestures to the people surrounding them, \"You think that the love of your people doesn't make the Ichor sing in your veins, boy?!\" There's a flicker of doubt across his face and a murmur in the crowd. \"Didn't think that through did you?\" \"Is that true, Nathaniel?\" The woman from earlier asks, her face filled with betrayal. \"I...\" Nathaniel's mouth gapes. \"It doesn't take a smart man to see what isn't hidden.\" James approaches him slowly, \"We need humanity as they need us. We never deny that.\" He can practically smell the doubt in the air, a touch of the gold seems to drain from Nathaniel's hair. How quickly human faith can sway. Once again James raises his hands, \"Now, please, let's talk. There's no need for this to end poorly.\" Nathaniel lunges at him and he simply spins, kicking a leg out, sending the boy tumbling to the ground. The blade falls out of his hand but he crouches and runs for James. A well placed right hook makes Nathaniel stagger back, spitting more blood. The woman runs to his side, \"Just talk to him, darling, please.\" \"No!\" Nathaniel bellows pushing her roughly back. \"I've been waiting my whole life for this.\" He reaches under his shirt, pulling out what looks sort of like a gun. It's red and gold and... Sweet Gaia. Glowing and lashing at the mouth of the barrel is lightening... Anthony's lightning, the kind Heph uses to craft. The shock catches James off guard. With a crack like thunder, a bolt shoots toward him. He's almost too slow, instead of ripping a hole through his middle it tears a gash in his side. Hitting the ground he groans, gold Ichor seeps thick and glowing from the wound, soaking into the black tee he wore and down into the dark denim. Nathaniel bellows a laugh, drunk with the power pulsing from the weapon. \"See!\" He calls to his people, \"I told you, the gods bleed just like men!\" \"Please, don't do this,\" James feels his patience waiver. \"They even beg like them!\" The boy's eyes are wild. \"I don't want-\" He hears the rumble of thunder. Before another bolt tears toward him, he lunges for the boy. Nathaniel moves, attempting to redirect the bolt. His grip on the gun falters, the energy pulses, as it falls from his hand it spins back on him, blasting a devastating wound through his left side. Once the flash of light dims screams fill the air. Nathaniel hits his knees looking in shock to his left side. James swallows hard, remembering a similar wound, his left-hand flexes. Catching the boy before he falls face first to the ground he guides him to his back. His eyes are filled with tears, mouth opening and closing like a fish, shock overtaking him. Blood pours from him, red and dark with strands of gold spinning in the pool. This wasn't a wound a mortal survived and no matter how long-lived Nathaniel was he was... mortal. \"I'm sorry,\" James says softly looking down. \"You have nothing to fear Nathaniel. You fought bravely,\" if not stupidly, but now wasn't the time. He reaches into his pocket plucking an old worn gold coin from it and slipping it into the boy's only remaining hand. \"So the ferryman knows who sent you.\" With that Nathaniel takes his last breath, his body, free of the Ichor that had given it such long-lived vigor shrivels. James plucks the gun from the ground and stands slowly, clutching his side. The people are huddled together close to the gate, some sobbing, some in shock. The woman approaches tentatively, staring horrified at the wrinkled corpse before her. She doesn't tremble though, in fact, he's impressed by her strength. After a moment her hand rises to her mouth to catch a sob or a scream. James grabs her wrist she swallows the emotion looking up at him, defiant. \"Don't let them see you break,\" he looks over her shoulder. \"Your people need you. They will need your strength once word gets around that you've lost him.\" Her knowing eyes bore into his own. Women never feared death the same as men. \"I didn't want this,\" he doesn't know why but it matters to him that she knows. She glances to her fallen love then back to James, \"I know.\" He nods. Releasing her he walks toward the people who seem to collectively tremble at the approach of a god of Death, \"Let this be a day you remember,\" his voice booms with the force only a god can produce. He gestures back to the corpse, \"Death came here, and came with mercy. Hubris caused this, not The Winter Soldier,\" he spits the title. \"Remember, and don't make the same mistakes.\" The woman has come up to his side, \"What's your name doll?\" He asks in a normal tone. \"Adelaide,\" she says straightening her back. He looks back to the crowd, \"This woman, Adelaide, will lead you forward. You will need to band together if you plan to survive.\" Without another word he turns and strides back to his bike, grabbing the jacket. He doesn't notice the hooded woman who fades away in the crowd. He stares at the bike. Anthony knew... he knew whose son this was and he wasn't certain he didn't know or even give him a god-killing weapon... Disgust fills his mouth. With a roar he punches his left fist through the battery, rendering the machine useless, and stalk's forward the earth opening at his call. As he strides into his realm, clutching at the still bleeding wound in his side, all he can think about is blowing his youngest brother's head off his body. Rage is something he hasn't felt in quite some time. He has to admit, it's a touch invigorating.",

      "Blood pours from him, red and dark with strands of gold spinning in the pool.",
      "This wasn't a wound a mortal survived and no matter how long-lived Nathaniel was he was... mortal.",
      "\"I'm sorry,\" James says softly looking down.",
      "\"You have nothing to fear Nathaniel.",
      "You fought bravely,\" if not stupidly, but now wasn't the time.",
      "He reaches into his pocket plucking an old worn gold coin from it and slipping it into the boy's only remaining hand.",
      "\"So the ferryman knows who sent you.\"",
      "With that Nathaniel takes his last breath, his body, free of the Ichor that had given it such long-lived vigor shrivels.",
      "James plucks the gun from the ground and stands slowly, clutching his side.",
      "The people are huddled together close to the gate, some sobbing, some in shock.",
      "The woman approaches tentatively, staring horrified at the wrinkled corpse before her.",
      "She doesn't tremble though, in fact, he's impressed by her strength.",
      "After a moment her hand rises to her mouth to catch a sob or a scream.",
      "James grabs her wrist she swallows the emotion looking up at him, defiant.",
      "\"Don't let them see you break,\" he looks over her shoulder.",
      "\"Your people need you.",
      "They will need your strength once word gets around that you've lost him.\"",
      "Her knowing eyes bore into his own.",
      "Women never feared death the same as men.",
      "\"I didn't want this,\" he doesn't know why but it matters to him that she knows.",
      "She glances to her fallen love then back to James, \"I know.\"",
      "He nods.",
      "Releasing her he walks toward the people who seem to collectively tremble at the approach of a god of Death, \"Let this be a day you remember,\" his voice booms with the force only a god can produce.",
      "He gestures back to the corpse, \"Death came here, and came with mercy.",
      "Hubris caused this, not The Winter Soldier,\" he spits the title.",
      "\"Remember, and don't make the same mistakes.\"",
      "The woman has come up to his side, \"What's your name doll?\"",
      "He asks in a normal tone.",
      "\"Adelaide,\" she says straightening her back.",
      "He looks back to the crowd, \"This woman, Adelaide, will lead you forward.",
      "You will need to band together if you plan to survive.\"",
      "Without another word he turns and strides back to his bike, grabbing the jacket.",
      "He doesn't notice the hooded woman who fades away in the crowd.",
      "He stares at the bike.",
      "Anthony knew... he knew whose son this was and he wasn't certain he didn't know or even give him a god-killing weapon...",
      "Disgust fills his mouth.",
      "With a roar he punches his left fist through the battery, rendering the machine useless, and stalk's forward the earth opening at his call.",
      "As he strides into his realm, clutching at the still bleeding wound in his side, all he can think about is blowing his youngest brother's head off his body.",
      "Rage is something he hasn't felt in quite some time.",
      "He has to admit, it's a touch invigorating."

Her stance deepened, hardened. Headstrong like her father, determined like her mother, she yanked him hard and snarled low between her teeth when he didn't budge a muscle. \"They used to use me as a shield,\" Hades began slowly, his eyes fluttering slow closed. He titled his head back, as though trying to catch the rain that hit the edge of the boundaries that held her in and did not drip in any further. The petals around his throat began to decay and fade away. \"Because I could not be shifted. And I could not be harmed.\" He raised one hand. \"What makes you think you can?\" \"Because I never give up,\" she snapped. \"And I will get what I want.\" Shadows licked her legs. \"And what do you want?\" She looked at the edge of the trees, expanding far beyond her reach. Before them shimmered the border lines that held her in. She thought of the rain that fell that she'd never felt. The house that she curled herself inside of, crying, sobbing, waiting. Waiting for the doors to be opened and her mother to let her go. Her eyes snapped to him. \"I want freedom.\" \"The Underworld is not freedom,\" he said, easy. \"Only to its king.\" A thrill shivered down her spine. His eyes matched hers, a challenge. A proposal. In her dreams, she'd thought it differently. Someone else. Warmer. Kinder. Softer. A savior who'd fought for her. Not someone she'd forcefully dragged from the depths of the dirt and rock below her feet, not someone she'd tried to trap there with her until he took her with him and let her out. \"Then I will be your queen,\" she said, stepping back. \"And you will keep me free.\" \"As you wish, my wife,\" he said, eyes dark and unchanged. He stepped towards her fast. Shadows bloomed where he stepped, swirling, encompassing and the ground trembled with every stepped. He captured her hand in his, fingers intertwined, and without warning, she was in the air, hefted high into his arms. Shadowed horses bled from the darkness. Trailing behind them clattered and clanked a chariot made of skeletal remains. She heard the screams of the souls ever trapped within. He carried her in and kept her tight in lap. \"Hold on.\" His voice was softer than it had ever been and she trembled. She glanced up to him and he was smiling. \"It will be cold for a spell. But you will breathe again.\" \"Of course, I will,\" she snapped, refusing to betray her fear to him. \"I am the Queen of the Underworld. I do not die.\" \"Brave words,\" he mused, \"for someone about to be buried.\"",

    "text": "Bruce has the leniency of a bull; one wrong move and he'll charge. He plans tediously for every enemy (and ally) he meets, so victory is not only slim but all the more impressive. Slade knows this, which is why he has never had the ambition to war with him. However, his son Dick is someone he'd be willing to risk everything for. When he was a child, Slade rarely caught a glimpse of him- Bruce was too eager to keep him as far from his favourite child as possible for them to properly meet- but when he'd finally seen him all those years later...he had no words. He'd grown into the most beautiful soul imaginable, a gorgeous blend of body and mind that made him infuriatingly attractive and impossible to resist. Slade's dream were haunted by him; his smile, his laughter, his amazing ass... But Dick wasn't just temptation incarnate, he was also gifted with a sharp mind and even sharper tongue. He was fearless, spoke his mind, and never took anything at face value. He was perfect. So Slade took the journey to Mount Olympus on his dark chariot, walked the palace steps, and waited. Bruce did not disappoint. \"You request an audience?\" He boomed, hands tightly curled around his lightning bolts. \"Yes. It's a matter of the heart, I'm afraid. You can put your bolts down now.\" \"Even in my own home you remain insolent. This is not your realm, speak with respect, if you have any.\" Slade smirked and crossed his arms. \"You rule over every God in Olympus, but I am not from Olympus, therefore you are not my king, and I can speak to you however I like.\" \"You came to me, Slade. I'd like to remind you of that before I send you away.\" He scoffed and uncrossed his arms, still standing at ease despite the clear aggression Bruce was displaying. \"Unfortunately for you, you can't.\" Bruce inclined his head, interest piqued but still incensed by Slade's attitude. \"And why would that be?\" \"Because as king, your word is your bond. And I've come to collect on a promise you made.\" Bruce narrowed his eyes but lowered his bolts finally. He was a very prideful man, and he lived by his code. He never made false promises. \"Go on.\" \"Many years ago, you promised me a bride of my choosing from your children. I've decided on taking one's hand in marriage.\" Bruce tensed up and reached for his bolts immediately. He was immensely protective of his children, and would do anything for them. Slade demanding one to marry was probably one of his worst nightmares, but he had made his vow. Now he must deliver. \"Which.\" He growled, weapons sparking dangerously. With a pleased smirk, Slade looked Bruce defiantly in the eye. He grinned as he said \"Dick.\" Bruce snarled and his bolts flared threateningly; he looked ready to attack. Slade held a hand out, placating. \"Calm down, I'm not interested in fighting you-\" \"You'd come into my home, ask to marry my son, and yet not expect a battle? Truly you have no respect-\" \"You made a vow. Do you mean to tell me that you don't intend to keep it?\" Bruce froze, and Slade could see him battling with his pride as a king and as a father. Ultimately, there was nothing he could do. He let out a deep sigh and squared his shoulders. Then he barked \"Get out.\" Slade bowed \"I'll wait, Bruce. But not for long.\" He fixed him with an intense stare as he straightened up \"Either you keep your promise, or I'll keep it for you.\" Bruce turned his back to him, thrumming with tension. As soon as he was out of sight, Bruce threw a bolt at the door and roared.",

    "text": "The first time she meets Agamemnon, Troy is burning as it did in her visions. Her brother is long dead, as are the lucky of those that were in the city. Her eyes shut and the horrific visions come back of what will- has- happened to her people. Agamemnon kisses her hand as if he's planning to court her, as if he'd ever listen to a single word she should speak. With his lips comes the vision of her death, but Agamemnon is dead too. And standing in her fallen city, hearing the cries of her people, Cassandra thinks it a fair trade. That she can tell him his death is coming, know it will only hasten to make it happen, is all the sweeter. (When is a curse, not a curse? When it starts the pyre of your enemies.). Agamemnon kisses her lips, and she sees a queen run him through with his own sword. Agamemnon kisses her thigh, and she sees him die in a poisoned bath, drowning. Agamemnon is confused, doesn't understand why his previously quiet concubine will not stop laughing. She must appear as mad as they say, for it is the first night he does not force himself upon her. (A tragedy it only works once.) The visions have never been wrong before, have never contradicted themselves. It is also the first time she has not spoken details of what is shown to her, has not tried to stop it. The idea makes her far too giddy, but may be true: if she were to speak it, the fates would be decided. It is a long journey to a foreign land, new deaths bringing her a cold comfort. For no matter how the visions change, the end is always imminent. Agamemnon will not survive the cruelties he inflicted upon others. Cassandra steals a knife from a drunken soldier, and the visions shift once more. Agamemnon is still dead; but she lives. They are but a single day from Mycenae when she sees it: a future that allows for the impossible. And perhaps the fates are teasing her or bribing her, or perhaps she will be turned into a cat for how very much she is thinking of herself, but this future must be. She speaks to the King's guards, for even though they disbelieve her, they still tie her wrists for foretelling treason. The sun sets, and Cassandra neither hears nor divines any new truth- but then a raven is flown to Mycenae. When it lands, Aegisthus will be killed. Only the most simplistic of barters will do for the fates- a soul for a soul. Cassandra will live.. They arrive on a sunny day, something Agamemnon takes as a fortuitous sign because he is a fool. How the gods love to lift a mortal up, and then crush them. His last bath shall be before the sun sets, a new monarchy before a first lament. Clytemnestra is awaiting them, glorious in gold, a touch of blood upon her lips. Soon, Cassandra will taste that mouth, will taste love and happiness, knowledge that does not hurt, and feelings so vivid her visions must be in excess. They will kill him together, they will crown one another in his blood, they will take this country and make it their own. There will be one day of bloodshed, and then Clytemnestra's children sent to marry those that would oppose them. Cassandra has learned how to speak in half-truths, to weaponize disbelief. Clytemnestra greets the King like a proper wife, asks after his travels and tells a servant to draw them a fresh bath. Soon.",

    "text": "Oerath Windsoul presents: The Ancient Greek Tales of Myths, Tragedy & Heroism Of the Demigod Heracles & the Twelve Labors of Legend King Eurystheus of Mycenae has given me a equally unique and dangerous task, for I am to help the scared people of the town of Nemea to get rid off a savage lion of so many threats. It is said to reflect all arrows, and so hard is the golden fur shielding it's skin, that no club or sword could do it much harm. It's only true weakness may be it's neck, which is widely unprotected. Considering this little knowledge I have acquired, it may be so, that this one ferocious beast I must battle against with my bare hands. Fortunately all of the years I spent training under guidance of the mighty and wise centaurs, will be now of use to me in this task to defeat all, that is evil, to forever free these sacred lands. O' Hera, I understand why you hate me with your whole immortal, yet bleeding heart, but in sight of the Twelve, I swear to you all.. I shall prove myself worthy of all the praise to be called the true champion of mankind. You, whose minds only darkness manages to find, stay away, you are lost beyond hope, damneth and dimmeth be the last of ye days. Of the Demigod Heracles & the Twelve Labors of Legend Part I: Slaying of the Nemean Lion (1st Labor) (Near the outskirts of Nemea, Peloponnesus) I hope this victory will launch of a long journey with promise of something so much more, for I have so much strength left in store. Over high hills with a good view to the Sea, I watch far into the distance, my thoughts weigh heavy, for so many wicked creatures of chaos still prowl the Earthly World free. Yet one day, misery is to forever lose it's way, and even though shrouded in a cloud of mysteries remains today, my courage is very real, thus I cannot possibly fail, for illuminated by the righteous sun fire is the ancient hero's way! Cry for triumph in face of the Nemean Lion, end it's reign, cease the violence for at least a moment, ultimate strength in your iron fists, you hold the power to repel most attacks of this one tough beast! Elegant monuments, statues are to be raised in my name one day, as my reputation will rapidly sweep across the many nations. My deeds will be recorded, to never let it all fade away. These monster slaying missions are the darkest of all events, more of them in future to follow. I am here to prevent the descending, or birth of further Chaos, for no more the mortal hearts and minds should feel fear, nor become entirely void of delight and hollow. A peaceful-looking pond near a quiet forest, which a harmless stranger approaches, is sadly a very occupied drinking spot for one.. a lion, both terrifying and strong. Innocent hearts are once again in grave danger, hasten to make the decision, citizens, flee, before it strikes too fiercely, the fear, have no fear, all light shall not be gone. For once, I wish to have a chance to personally choose color of the next dawn. I dance, while the shadows crawl towards me, their presence does not concern this one, who does not believe in any glory or gifts granted to the faithful pawns of the Gods, who oft choose to spawn into Face of the World in their mortal-like, deceiving forms. It is my true calling to defend that, which all of you all-powerful higher beings do no longer even care for. In the beginning, there was always room for hope, wisdom and love, yet now only sadness rules the decisions made so much higher above. Only one solution of greatness awaits by the shining door, for my self-confidence grows, while the followers of evil are bound to slowly lose themselves, upon gazing too many times into Destiny's cold, darkened and hellish portal of an mirror! The peacock seer, and the lightning-hearted king, their actions do not predetermine everything. Clear is now the sky, so have no fear, a faint and divine whisper in your ear will not suddenly just change into an eye's falling tear. The end must never even get a chance to arrive to ruthlessly play the utterly horrified. Hours flew.. if I just could.. get a hold of it's neck, I would be able to.. twist and break it, for no other option there is to this perilous situation. Such an agile animal, I have great difficulties with dealing in any damaging blows. A torment's true trial, yet no matter how impossible it would seem, let it be widely known.. to no adversary.. this heroic soul bows. No arrows left, my oaken club all broken, a sword sings to be once more sharpened. Face to face again, I bleed from my face, not heavily, steadily, I choose my steps, ease the beating of my heart, calm my breath.. and then I channel all of my inner force, to execute another leap of brutal power, to finally take down the Nemean Lion. And successful is the punch I deliver, and then begins the wrestle, I grab the beast's neck, a final roar echoes in the sky at the moment, when I arise covered in blood and sweat, holding it's severed head in my right hand. A trophy, that will surely make even the King kneel down in fearful awe, to send me upon another quest, another daring journey, for it is all this adventurous and valiant heart needs to make it beat, let the adrenaline run pure and clear, this is not the last you will hear.. of me, for the end.. it is not yet here.. it is far from being over, it is not near. Eurystheus: \"Heracles, what you have now brought in front of me, is a truly gruesome sight of horror. I can only imagine, what the beast must have looked like, when it was still alive, but this trophy you now present to me, it's head.. is unlike any I have ever seen. I really commend you on the kill, and by my good will, may your awesome labors continue under these skies of white and blue.\" The Narrator: \"This is what the King says, yet we all know Eurystheus sided up with Hera prior to the beginning of the Labors. An evil man for certain, surely he shall be disappointed in the end, for the hero Heracles.. was not made to give up.\" Nine heads it normally has, this venom breathing, o' vile serpent. And endless in terror seems to be it's reign, so monstrously grim. Outside the vast lair it oft ventures to seek for prey, meet the challenge, capture the final moment. Whoever, a soul brave enough, could slay this one beast, whose singular purpose is to inflict fear and chaos through the actions dim. O' the King of the Heaven, an ancient scroll reads out, that by your will a child will be born. Zeus, a mortal woman He has romanced, and without a doubt.. this child, a boy is to become a demigod destined to walk through a trialing storm of deeds, called.. the Twelve Labors of Heracles. The Lernaean Hydra, all of your heads shall be mine, I shall return your burning carcass to your parents, o' spawn of Typhon, the Serpent Giant and Echidna, the Mother of All Monsters. No more shall your stray offspring plague this world with terror, your evil existence is an grave error. I do not share the Olympians' passion of tormenting the mankind, I care so much about this world, for I am the champion of justice. My battle cry is a fierce one, the strength of over ten men do I possess, being a hero can be quite a calling.. and this I should truly know, for my name is.. Heracles. Heracles: \"I have found it's lair, which leads deep below the ground, through tunnels crafted with care, I walk to reach a cavern, of which vastness truly surprises me. There, awaiting in the darkness, is the Hydra, towering an opponent. The battle is set to begin.\" Of the Demigod Heracles & the Twelve Labors of Legend Part II: Slaying of the Lernaean Hydra (2nd Labor) (At the Lake of Lerna, Argolis) At first, no matter how vigorously I kept beheading it's heads, two heads always grew back, when I had cut one. Finally, I realized that if I had fire, maybe I could ignite it's venom, in agony it would then shriek, while I would perform an attack never seen before. Luckily, I recalled I had an artifact, called: 'An Underworld Firestone' with me, which I received from Hephaestus as a gift a long time ago. The Hydra was hungry for more bloodshed, yet I could not grant it what it desired, and so.. I reached out for the stone, throwing it with great precision and power at the creature, the gemstone of captured flame spirits breaking, howling voices echoed in the cave for a time, before the hue of red turned violent. Then there was an explosion, a high torrent of flames, dancing and crimson, deadly and burning. O' Hydra, you are finished. Far too many lie dead and have gone missing because of you, farewell. This next strike, shall be your end. The walls of it's lair trembled, as I jumped high up into the air to cut all of it's now a hundred heads or more at once. Euphorically I landed afterwards, it's blood mixed with venom all over me. May waters of the lake outside cleanse these wounds and clothes, but right now.. I feel quite.. victorious. Like an eagle, I claimed myself the right to rule the sky, even for a while, for that leap of might I just executed, was over thirty meters high! Tragedies shall no longer follow one after another, O' Destiny, do not be so cold, I want to believe in your power. Dark mysteries were to betray the peacock seer, the moment she dared to question my plans to steer the mankind's course for better. So here and now begins a series of heroic acts and commitments, Eleven Labors there are left, until my crusade upon the Earthly World is finished, yet not completely over. My power of will burns with delight, my thoughts about peace, they cannot be taken away nor magically vanquished. Upon this journey I embark with the wind, as my one and only company. This world must be defended, and if I am to bleed, then I shall heal myself with herbs and other nature's ointments. My heart is a sword, my mind is a shield. I am no corrupt and wealthy lord, and thus I shall never yield. Skyward I raise my fist, as I prepare myself to walk through dark forests and evil lands engulfed by an eerie mist. No light to illuminate these perilous paths with, fearless I still stand, for inside this head and this heart, no thoughts and feelings are ever too adrift. Foolishness is to ignore the work of good, I know she enjoys of her rule over the wicked, around whose necks, so tightened are the damaging iron knots. Whatever you throw in front of me.. I will not be bothered, for down in the core of my very being, death is something I fear not. And to every other creature of darkness out there, let it be known, that the champion's path is open only for one, who as a legendary hero will be remembered. And many are the tales, these ancient chronicles of the Greek mythology have yet to tell. But alas, not everything is meant to be revealed.. all at once. I have been told it's speed is so great, that it outruns even an arrow shot from one of Athena's handmade, golden bows, such impressive agility belongs to only one beast, the Ceryneian Hind by it's name, who will also come to face an imminent defeat in the hands of the champion of righteous power, who fears nothing is ready to sacrifice everything in order to gain the right to be called the legendary hero of ancient might.. is prepared, well rested, ready to set his traps, so that the creature may be caught, for with it's capture comes yet another closure, this is how the path towards an age of peace is wrought, this is how an end to yet another labor is brought! Of the Demigod Heracles & the Twelve Labors of Legend Part III: the Ceryneian Hind, the Beast swifter than an shot arrow (3rd Labor) (Near a temple of Artemis somewhere in Keryneia) Heracles: \"King Eurystheus says the other thing, yet thinks the another, for I know of his schemes with the peacock seer, Hera. Those two.. curse them. Despite their efforts to ruin my labors, all of the given tasks shall be carried out. This is my will, iron-strong, no failure is accepted, justice shall be met, before wickedness is given even a slightest of chance to bloom amongst the good. Evil begone, the sunlight, help me win this one man's war against the monsters of the myths and the oft cruel gods and goddesses.\" A nearby river runs pure and clear, as I tread on with care, without fear, for with sheer strength and cunningness I have taken down many monsters of dreadfulness. And today, the labors in the making have led me to a forest, where an agile beast wanders, for it's speed, it has become the forest's king, this creature sacred to Artemis, yet I will find a way to bring an end to it's reign, I know that with this task, something is amiss, for I would not needlessly invoke her anger, for the Hellenic Goddess of the Hunt.. is an wanted ally, and thus, I shall not hurt the hind, such thoughts I dismiss as unnecessary, blunt, only a man truly blind, would freely choose to kill this golden colored being with a hue of bronze, and so it sees me, and in response, it runs, yet I feel this is it.. I can read it's every movement, this is the right moment, soon the glory of this capture is mine, it manages to avoid some of my ground traps, yet I always have carried a titanium net with me, and so, a coin of the Moerae is flipped, no matter what side I choose, I always win, and so I jump to a rock, and from there at a tree, and so I strengthen the overall force of my legs to momentarily use the tree to launch myself with great haste over fifty meters high, going forward, still skyward, I see the hind, and so I throw the net, successfully hitting the target, capturing it inside.. rendering it motionless, hence bringing the chase to an end. On the way back to Mycenae, I am suddenly approached by Artemis, she seems angered by my actions, yet after explaining myself, and revealing my true intentions to her, she agrees that I shall take the hind, and bring it in front of Eurystheus, only to set it free upon the moment he hurries to the castle's yard to see it in the leash, captured, then to be released, may the King see it or not, a promise has been made, an oath now momentarily binds me to the service of Artemis, yet this occurrence of Destiny comes with great bliss, the hind agrees to come with me peacefully, and so finally, I may set out for another journey, restless forever, I turn the luminous key, opening a door, leading through space and time into the multi-colored; labyrinthian halls of the Airborne Mount Olympus, a place both horrifying and divine, this is where the Gods reside, one day my paths may once more lead me here, to greet Zeus.. for the last time.. to claim the permanent right.. to continue diminishing the presence.. of the evil beings lurking in the shades.. of every passing night. Artemis: \"Doth better not betray me, Heracles, for a price too dear you could pay for such.. an foolish act of despair. I place my trust upon you this time, and never shall you forget my kindness.\" Of the Demigod Heracles & the Twelve Labors of Legend (A Short Poetic Summary) Part IV: The Capture of A Raging Beast: the Erymanthian Boar (4th Labor) The Erymanthian boar, in Artemis's name it haunts a temple atop the sacred mountain, Erymanthos, from which it would be called forth to lay devastation upon the fields of the great farmers, if any disobedient was shown. Raging down the mountainsides, a colossal beast, the bringer of cursed tides, it must be stopped, by the Twelve, I, Heracles, shall save these once so quiet hills. This odd reign of terror shall be stopped, no more it is to reveal it's deadly spikes, the charging Erymanthian boar, may you terrorize the fields and eat the harvest no more, you will be captured, o' beast of wrath, may the celestial peace rule these lands evermore. Of the Demigod Heracles & the Twelve Labors of Legend Part V: Cleaning of the Augean Stables (5th Labor) (The Kingdom of Elis, southern Peloponnesos) The next task at hand, one which I had been paid for, involved thinking and strength, yet it was of a difficult nature, for it befall upon me to cleanse the Augean stables, which housed over three thousand divinely healthy cattle, of whose overall dung made the stable's cleaning quite impossible. And for long Heracles pondered, that what could be the solution to this matter, but then he remembered that nearby, two short rivers run both with ease, if he managed to connect them, such an enormous flow of water would surely clean the stables, and thus, the labor would be carried out through cunningness and power. And of this I am certain, I shall not lose a single labor.. for my burning will is a terror to those, who know me not. And whoever my foe decides to be, feel fear, because even though my heart is righteous and just, I still do not suffer harming of the innocent, for one should always walk in the name of peace. Daring are the ways of the heroes, who live in the moment, await for the next encounter, be it dangerous or not, creatures of evil, I have not forgot about your existence in this world, for after I have connected these two rivers, cleaned the stables, I shall embark of a much more perilous quest, yet more of this the sands of time and the crystal ball in the Twelve Olympian's Hall do not reveal, so may the Fates seal another event of Destiny, their power I shall not deny, and as for this calling of mine, these journeys epic and divine are yet to continue for six more parts, but let us follow the road for a while, and then a forestpath, for a test of might awaits one, who was born under the mightiest stars, with your fists of iron and if chosen so, of rage, hit the earth now, may the wind increasingly blow, as cracks the earth, water rushing forth to unite the rivers, and together, they wash over the Augean stables, their force and speed hastened by the wind, as was to be expected, for the forces of nature always seem to be.. on my side. Unfortunately, in the end, King Augeas did not honor his part of the bargain, for he promised me one tenth of his whole cattle, if the job was finished in a day, and so, a fight followed, and I eventually had to deal the mortal blow, but it seems to me the Fates themselves deemed this angry man's rule impure and tyrannous, however, I do not take pleasure in his slaying, but a heir is to be chosen, and so, may one of his sons, Phyleus, from now on rule this kingdom, as for the reward, it shall still be claimed, and then is the time.. to go and sell the cattle, buy a golden horse and a silvery saddle, and a new weapon, for one is ready for another monster battle. Heracles: \"This labor is done, may King Eurystheus approve of this method or not, it was of my choosing, and it was the best solution to the problem for certain, because now for the first time in over thirty years, the stables of Augean are clean, even if only for a while. This was the labor, fifth in number, and may seven more follow.. before the snows endlessly rain down from the pale winter skies, and the wheel of the year has turned once more.\" Of the Demigod Heracles & the Twelve Labors of Legend Part VI: And So, Down From the Skies Fall the Stymphalian birds (6th Labor) (Lake Stymphalia, Arcadia) Heracles: \"With poison of the Lernaean Hydra, that I so carefully stored inside a large vial after the battle had ended, I shall now bring an end to the birds, whom these swamps have for long terrorized. This is to be my sixth labor, and with bow and arrow, I am to succeed, though my skills in their use are not naturally great, I am ever so a quick learner, capable of mastering anything, if given a period of time to carry out focused training of the mind, for to a burning will, no boundaries exist.\" Into the swamps deadly and murky one ventured, to watch the lakes of green poison boil, the steam mixed with a hue of violent red, above, slightly avoiding the harmful fumes await the ever so hungry and insightful vultures. I once again have to place my trust upon Athena's craft, a golden bow and a quiver full of arrows to be my choice, leave ye dim den already, o' the Stymphalian birds, witness ye energy of life drift, into the burrows below fall, never to answer to the emerald green sky's call. Great, glowing feathers collected from each, heads cut, taken as trophies, born a true tactician, mine are not the paths forlorn, not the role of a tyrannous king, nor an evil magician, for a man of true wisdom and strength I am, one who seeks not to control the weathers, nor oppress the innocent, for a heart too kind and righteous, belongs to him, whose deeds are legendary, divine, courageous. The winds are so restless, the man to who I work for, is truly heartless, a king unworthy of his jewelled throne, in service of Hera, that wicked crone, a once noble king turned a vile man, only known to power, more and more he craves, yet eventually it will all be over, of old age he is not to die, but to poison, perhaps.. is to shatter the dreams of a tyrannous and pitiful ruler. Heracles: \"This shall do fine as means of proof to bring back to King Eurystheus, to confirm that I have once again succeeded in my heroic endeavors.\" Of the Demigod Heracles & the Twelve Labors of Legend Part VII: Capture of the great and shining Cretan Bull (7th Labor) (Wandering the crop fields near Crete) To include references to King Minos, the Minotaur and so forth. The Narrator: \"Once, King Minos asked Poseidon to send for him a white bull. Thinking it would be then sacrificed in his name, the god did, yet Minos saw greatness in the bull and was not willing to sacrifice it. Enraged of this, Poseidon had Aphrodite cause Pasiphae, the king's wife to fall in love with the Bull, this strange affair leading to birth of the Minotaur, a very deadly creature in it's own right. The Cretan Bull remained too, and in time, became a blight for the folk living near the vast crop fields in Crete, later to be counted as seventh among the Labors of the great hero Heracles.\" Great, shining and white is the Cretan Bull, the enraged queen Pasiphae seeks it out, falls in love with, the union gives birth.. to a creature most unholy, the Minotaur, partly a man, from the torso, and partly a bull, from the head, a savage and bloodthirsty being, which would end up locked in the Labyrinth, built and designed by the master architect and artificer Daedalus, under orders of King Minos of Crete, and what a cruel tradition would form from this creation.. for in time, he would have no choice, but for the mad delight of his wife.. begin sending.. seven young boys and seven young girls, every nine years.. to bestow as food for the Minotaur, so that it would be satisfied, and able to feast from the pile.. for another nine years to come. With my olive-wood club and raw power, I shall permanently stop the Cretan Bull from laying waste to the land of Crete, it's many sources of food, verdant hills, for the rage of Poseidon rests within it still, supremely, it has a will to cause devastation and endless harm to the peaceful workers of the fields. Excellently the beast charged at me, determined to ram at my body with it's horns, yet one move of haste and evasion, a very powerful tackle, followed by a short wrestle, the battle was over before it even began, down falls the Cretan Bull, born with tactical vision, always able to make the right combat decisions. Upon these two shoulders I shall carry it to Tiryns, where King Eurystheus said he wants to keep it locked inside a corral, little does it's body weigh, to a normal human being, the task of getting this animal there would prove heavy, difficult, impossible even, but I am no ordinary man, nor am I physically weak or weary, for I am Heracles, the one who is sent when you need to capture or kill a strong beast.. or a fearsome monster. Of the Demigod Heracles & the Twelve Labors of Legend Part VIII: The man-eating Mares of Diomedes (8th Labor) (Near the kingdom of Thrace, besides the Black Sea) Heracles: \"Podargos, Lampon, Xanthos and Deinos, with my bare hands, I shall carry the four of you to the court of vile King Eurystheus.\" The Mares had always been deadly in their behaviour, and thus, the people desperately cried out for a savior, I was the one to answer, to devise yet another grand plan, my ways are those of a hero, most revered and legendary, of that there is no doubt, all know for a fact, that I truly am.. the strongest living man, the shining powers of a demigod residing within flesh and blood. The Mares of Diomedes were four flesh-eating horses; far beyond savage and wild, their owner, the giant Diomedes, he was.. a proud owner of these animals, feeling no remorse about their unnatural diet. Without feeling any mercy, or kindness in that regard, he would lure people, common folk into the yard, to the very stables wherein he kept them locked in chains, and watch them snatch the victim, witness them eat the flesh.. such madness, it must be stopped, no, it will be stopped! No more are they to perish in the hands of abominations, I am here to bring an end to all creatures of evil, to unite the nations, the rivers at times, if I must showcase my power, the world of Man with deeds far more than heroic, oft a bit dark.. I always was meant as a slowed down fall of yellowed pages to shower. In my eyes, he who longed to see them dead deserves nothing else, than an ax.. struck unto his head. The horses I freed, scared them off to a high peninsula, then I dug a deep trench, watched it get filled with water, the Mares no longer able to cross, I did this in the cover of night, so that I would not have my throat sliced by Diomedes due to being asleep, awake I stayed, waited patiently in the shadows for arrival of the giant, who seemed angry, shouting my name, demanding me to reveal my position, yet I did not, for the next time he turned away, I ran, a swing was heard, and there fell the giant, down to embrace of the dim earth. As for the Mares, I fed Diomedes's body to them to calm the beings, and when I finally returned with the horses, now subdued, King Eurystheus ordered them to be presented as a sacrifice to Zeus, yet the God-King refused them, sending as equally savage animals to make quick work of the man-eating Mares, to end their lives. Wolves, lions and bears, a passion for flesh their eyes no longer see, Thrace finally rid off it's fears, I am one step closer, for freedom.. is what I ultimately need. Traversing knee deep in the bloody rivers harboring the kingdom of the Amazons. For ages, has their culture withstood the weight of not allowing any mortal boys to ever even see the light of day. Truly, a barbaric tribe, a race of it's own, unknown of and to the surrounding world. It is so, that your Queen's revered girdle of powerful war magic would suit the waist of another divine creature, a king's daughter, the crown princess. Of the Demigod Heracles & the Twelve Labors of Legend Part IX: The Girdle of Hippolyta, queen of the Amazons (9th Labor) (Kingdom of the Amazons) Eurystheus: \"Heracles, this time, I send you to retrieve the girdle of Hippolyta, queen of the Amazons. I, however, do wish you would find a peaceful solution to the matter, and that she is willing to part with the item without causing a scene. The item is a gift from her father, Ares, imbued with great magical power. My daughter would be pleased to wear it. And know this, their sins are many, their primeval sacrifices to whatever gods or goddesses those people worship.. unforgivable. Should she appear hostile, violent, if there are no other options left, then quickly bring her down, let her beloved crown roll across the stone floor, as into eternity fades the soul of the cruel queen of the Amazons. Either way, this is to be your ninth labor.\" Hiding in the shadows, peacock feathers guide the approaching storm in the black sky. Treading forth dangerous paths overrun by long, spiky thorns, giant spiders and bloodthirsty bats, and you.. o' queen of the Gods, you may try and try....yet you may not sway my iron-strong will, your spiritual presence, begone from this tropical hill, in which tall grass I await for hours to pass, let the evening fall once more.. to the eerie; skull faced moon's call. And so, once again in time, the forces of darkness seek to devour it all. An evil spirit lurks in midst, and so the queen of the Amazon falls into a distracted state of pure rage. A mind lost, fury uncaged, chaos is slowly becoming one with her will, her thoughts now drift into the beyond, where in all quietness, await the tides of nothingness, with open arms, prepared to welcome the broken existence of one legendary Amazon warrior princess. Sadly, it had to come to this.. we already had agreed on peace.. yet She, once again undid.. another heavenly alliance.. Hera, never shall you be forgiven, eight deeds there are now left, though never shall one thing come to pass.. a journey, it was meant to last.. this is yet another beginning of a mystical and mythical era.. of an epic warrior poet's existence.. in this promised world currently shrouded.. by a thick cloak of blackness. Heracles: \"Heroes are born with a just cause, to serve the World of Man as their primary house, to not break any oaths, to not violate any laws, for that is the hero's way, to valiantly stand in face of the end, no matter the day. Today was a cruel day, and once these labors are done, I hope I will never see King Eurystheus again.\" Of the Demigod Heracles & the Twelve Labors of Legend (Part IX) Part X: The Cattle of the Monster Geryon (10th Labor) (The isle of Erytheia, the Mediterranean Sea) Heracles: \"To obtain the Cattle of the Monster Geryon, to carry the man-eating Mares of Diomedes, to capture the great Cretan Bull, to steal the golden apples from the Garden of the Hesperides.\" And there I was, crossing the Libyan desert without any nourishment or drink, I got so frustrated, I bored so much to the very sight of Helios, the Sun, that I shot an arrow up high, trying to damage him, unable to rest, my whole life being a physical test, yet Helios seemed somewhat pleased, for he saw courage in my actions, and thus, granted me the golden chariots with which I could cross the Sea, and finally reach Erytheia, an isle far in the Mediterranean, for there my next task shall lead me to face the Monster Geryon. A horrid giant with a head most deformed, faces.. so many, some of them resembling humans, and without a doubt, his reign of terror shall cease to be. A two-headed dog and it's colossal master, carrying three shields, three spears and three helmets to break me, yet my olive-wood club ready, fear.. no, I do not feel any. Geryon, the mere sight of you along with your many grotesque faces truly.. disturbs me. A being blessed with hideousness alone, your hound of the watch, no match for the supremeness of my.. naturally divine strength. Many monsters lay broken, their lives forfeit, reigns ended, you.. shall not become an exception in that regard, for the moment of valor is at hand.. it is time to shine bright.. for the Airborne Olympian kingdom. A herder unworthy of the position, a truly wrongly gained one, two great manly swings, two successful hits, the downfall of two minions alerts an outraged master giant, who from grace is to fall, to step outside the walls of existence, the forces of good are to win, I can feel it, truest my heart sings, if it can valiantly pass down the sentence, Fates, I am the favorite son, a brown-haired tall one, a known bearer of the three heavenly gifts: Heroism, Justice & Wisdom. A poison arrow shot through the giant's forehead, the fight ended with a mighty clash of steel; a sound quite loud, during which nine heavy items.. were suddenly, and finally.. dropped down to the ground. Orthrus and Eurytion, their names now mean oblivion, for finished is the tenth labor, swift was Geryon's approach, as we waged battle at the river Anthemus, yet he too fell, I obtained his Cattle, no tears were shed, as the eyes all across his many faces.. shut, one by one, and so dawned a new dawn upon red isle of the sunset, it became a peaceful place once again, for with the perishment of Geryon, every living thing there regained it's color. Heracles: \"Many perils I had to face to get this cattle brought in front of King Eurystheus, only for the lot that remained to be sacrificed to Hera. Such brutality. Once I am done with these labors, I hope for the king to release me from his service, to be finally able to do my own bidding, to explore the world as I see fit, for inside me dwells a powerful and ever so free spirit.\" Of the Demigod Heracles & the Twelve Labors of Legend Part XI: Theft of the golden apples from the Garden of the Hesperides (11th Labor) (Climbing the Mount Atlas, to reach the Garden) Heracles: \"Once these labors are finished, I shall follow the paths of peril no more, but now, I must walk across the beds of flowers, this is the fabled Garden of the Hesperides, guarded by a watchful dragon of magic, and of course, by the many divine daughters of Hesperus.\" Heracles: \"With only one more labor left, my eyes now focused, breathing steady and heartbeat slowed, I prepare myself for quite a daring theft.\" The most challenging labor proved out to be acquiring of the magical and hallowed golden apples from the Garden of the Hesperides, for no easy paths lead there, it is either across the sea or the air, I must reach the isle, where the waves, wildly and calmly ride in tandem with the jumping fishes and the singing birds, that have come to enjoy of the area's strange tides, it is also wherein the Daughters of Hesperus, nymphs of the playful evening and beautiful golden sunset lie, waiting for the adventurers, to lure them, to break them, if they dared to touch any of the sacred apples. Many travelers I met during my journey to find the Garden, until I encountered Nereus, the age-old Augean Sea god, who generously revealed to me the location, said to be atop the Mount Atlas, and on my way there, with Antaeus I met, invisibility helped him not, for he was there to thwart my progress, to end my existence, so I had no choice, but to hold him in a crushing embrace in the air, until the blood of life ceased from running in his veins, his heart still, I dropped his body for the Mother Gaia to behold, and continued ever onward, for next I would have to hold the heavens upon my two shoulders, if even for a little while, in the colossal Atlas's stead. Enter the garden of longevity, hedonism and uncounted pleasures, for it is guarded by the Daughters of Hesperus, maidens wearing only the necessary clothes, always willing to tend to wounds of any lost adventurers, offering the guide of softness, deception and love, who in this world, if a man, could even hope to deny their lust, only the blind, but those heroic and sworn to protect the Mankind, should they too not - on rare occasions - give in.. to costly temptations. Finally, after hours of clever discussing, through sheer cunningness, almost ended up entangled in a cycle of pleasures, no more, only a moment's glamour, it already faded, fortunately, I did not have to fight the dragon, and now I must return with the apples obtained, for King Eurystheus is not going to believe his eyes, once he sees them, he will be furious I presume, for little did he think that I could actually return from the Garden unscathed, and what happened to the maidens, the nymphs.. well, their fates are not sealed, because them I could not possibly kill, for such divine beings those nymphs are with their smiles and angelic wings, and so, without further mysteries, the eleventh labor.. is finished. A three-headed canine protector of blazing fire and rage sits watching, widely uncaged, guarding the Underworld's dark and burning gates, keeping the dead from ever leaving. A skeletal metal mask wears he, whose deeply blue; glowing sword of pure blackness darkens all eyes with it's aura's blinding light, which gently devours on afterlife force of the spirits lingering about Tartarus, the tormented abyss of the dead, yet staying away.. from the ones resting over.. in the realm, they call the fabled Elysian Fields. Of the Demigod Heracles & the Twelve Labors of Legend Part XII: the Dangerous Capture of Cerberus, the Hound of Hades (12th Labor) (At the Gates of the Underworld) O' Cerberus, the Hound of Hades, you shall meet both the righteousness and toughness of my two fists, which have shattered many great rocks, tore down many tall trees, in their search of divine justice, the arms of steel are strong and swift, yet of an equally high level, is the hero's vigilance. I am to become your captor, submit easily, or I will have to take you down, you devilish, monstrous dog, you hear.. good, do bark and bark more, in this dark sanctum, Hades's domains very crown, the Gates leading to an afterlife of torment, or of celestial beauty.. you are bound to fall down to the scorched ground, for I have been ordered.. to bring you back in these adamantine chains.. may the battle begin, to be followed.. by a scene of blood red.. yet I do not wish to take any.. of your three heads.. for this is another wrestle.. to prove that no beast.. is a match.. to the ever so great Champion of Mankind, no names need to be uttered, for mine.. is known all around.. the Ancient Greece! Heracles: \"And so, after an excessively long and tiresome fight, the mighty Cerberus finally yields, submits, and hence, is now under my full control, to do my bidding. Truly, I bleed heavily, yet this victory, was the last one I needed.. the Twelfth Labor.. it is done, carried out. And now, may the deceiving King Eurystheus.. in sight of the Twelve Olympians, who I at times so greatly despise.. finally and officially recognize me as the mankind's greatest and most legendary hero, who ever lived. And what is to follow from here onward, that.. is a question to which only the quiet winds of Greece.. know the correct answer.\" Oerath Windsoul presents: A Monsterslaying/Adventure Classic Of the Travels of Theseus, the Ancient King of Athens Chapter I: Slaying of the Minotaur The Narrator: \"Perseus was valiant, for one of his many successful feats was the slaying of Medusa, once feared queen of the Gorgons. Heracles was very legendary, for he carried out the task of the Twelve Labors, earning the praise and status of a true hero, very much like Perseus. In this regard, Theseus, the King of Athens, is no difference, for among many heroic things, he is known as the one, who slew the Minotaur, becoming the only living person to make it out of the Labyrinth alive. A place most terrible, which was designed by Daedalus, King Minos's chief architect, and made deadly beyond comprehension.\" With the thread everlasting, I carefully treaded along those olden passages filled with gore and dust of the many silent decades. The Minotaur knew of corpses and the delight of blood alone, and would not tolerate any breathing trespassers, unknown of the outside world, so obscure it's hunger, so blank it's violent red gaze. The Labyrinth stands tall in the isle kingdom of Crete, the ruins even Heracles wished not to disturb, for there you can get lost so easily, for the passages themselves were made ever-changing, forever wavering, deadly beyond imaginable, known for it's many traps; the work of the grand artificer, Daedalus. The Narrator: \"Forced to carry out the designing and building of this structure, for mad was King Minos, and so it had to be done, for so raging was his will, that it could not be swayed. Threats followed, and Daedalus was forced to yield, pledging himself to the king's service to have a home for Icarus, his son. Yet one day.. he would fly too close to the Sun, even though he knew the risks, the call of adventure and foolish bravery, was all it took. Helios showed no mercy upon that day, for the wings he burned, and so, Icarus fell down to dark embrace of the Sea, never to be seen again.\" Long was my ascent to claim the throne of Athens, my many journeys of peril, heroism and awe saw to that. I was a young and fearless warrior during those days, when I valiantly fought for the Twelve for the good of all mankind. From King Minos's daughter, Ariadne, who seemingly has fallen in love with me, I received the everlasting ball of white thread, a sword and a shield, fully prepared for the battle which lies ahead. I aim to answer to her call of love. And so I went on, and soon, came to a clearing where a temple stood. And from midst it's shadows rose the horned head of a bull, the torso belonging to man. It was the Minotaur, an ugly and fearsome creature of evil. I am the swift doom shining in the dark, and thus, it desperately wants to see me dead. No more children ever to be sacrificed, only one death to make things right for the end of Crete's ancient times. In face of a powerful adversary, do whatever is necessary, let your reign be legendary. Never give in, untouched, bear not a single sin, for you are Theseus.. fast you move, armed with the heavenly glowing trident, always keeping your hand ready at your sword's sheath, this much is obvious.. you were born to win. The battle was one of the bloody legends, only in minor a gruesome detail to be described; cuts throughout the torso, legs severed. The creature of hideousness in embrace of the temple's vines lie, it's head taken as a trophy. No more sacrifices, overthrow the evil king, banish the oracles. The ancestral hero Heracles and his twelve divine deeds inspired me to take on the task of traveling the world in the search of monsters to slay, glory to claim and artifacts to uncover. So now, may I finally join the order of the victorious and vicarious champions. May I at last enter the hall of those, who became the protectors of mankind for all eternity!? The wrongful fruit of actions of the God, Poseidon. Cursed King of the Sea, no more shall your rage harm the folk of Crete, for ended shall be the reign of the mad King Minos, through who you see with the eyes of primal watery evil! The monuments of stone crackle, as I march past them with a speed unseen before, my very thoughts hastened by the silvery moon's radiating and haunting light. Born under the stars miraculously bright and of fortune most limitless, a guardian of the nights answers to the call silently, so that none could foresee his arrival so deadly, unimaginably swift. With his guidance, all could learn from the winds, to be free, to harness the power of speed, the key to it rests within one, to activate the blood, the mind's river must flow into the right direction, for only then the truest amount of mystically shining; astral power could be harnessed as a force of victory, unleashed it be upon the foes wicked and evil beyond salvation. Where shall lead this olden path of mine, that not even I seem to be certain of, as I walk the higher places of this world, where most would not dare to venture, I yearn for the dangers and adventures. One thing is for certain. Accursed be the raging God of the Sea! Chosen to rid the Earthly World off many a peril, my heart is a sword, my mind the scales of justice, my eyes can see through any guise of evil. Embracing the oceanic tides, here to save lives, not from the Sun one hides, boldly challenges the ways of the skies. I am Theseus, son of Aegon and Aethra, and I was born a king. To prove my worth, I had to seek out the sword and sandals hidden under a great rock, left there by my father, Aegon, when I was a little child. Only when I would be strong enough to lift the rock all by myself, and take the items, should I leave the Motherland and seek out to claim my birthright. A life full of tests, the hardships I survived. And then through the military ranks I arose to become something more than just a mere warrior.. a true hero. Ancient Poems and Songs of the Greek Myths Stories tell about the Gorgon cavern of ancient legend, which leads deep below the earth into a murky temple of eldritch horror. And into those depths of reeking death a brave warrior once ventured, a man, who possessed three heavenly gifts. An adamantine sword from Zeus, a polished silver shield from Athena, and the helm of darkness from Hades. Valiant, trustworthy, legendary, heroic. These qualities define the hero, who was so mighty to survive the dangers of the realm, which lies deep below, a vast cavern almost filled with water, built to be a labyrinth of traps, chambers and endless terror. Zeus: \"Perseus, by your deeds of good and of valor, in your quest to slay monsters, may you forge yourself a name, so that you will be remembered as a hero by the people, whom these creatures for so long and mercilessly terrorized. Go forth in the name of Olympus.\" A Monsterslaying Classic: The Battle of Perseus & Medusa, queen of the Gorgons This strange place.. I am slowly beginning to doubt.. my faith and resolve.. by all the Twelve's grace.. I may be the only one, who in the secrets of this dark cavern would freely choose to delve. Such unearthly sounds of unholy nature keep ringing in my ears, as I feel years of my life fading away from my reach, just by listening.. to these.. voices and whispers. It is said that treading here alone devours on your sanity, leaving your thoughts lingering in the dark, yet I do not feel it's effects in my mind, nor in my heart, for I know what awaits ahead of me. Fear has never truly managed to creep up into my mind, I know it is her emerald gaze, which petrifies any beholder it may possibly find. I am a slayer of monsters, I never stop to look behind, and if one day, these eyes have turned grey, I may become blind, yet I shall always continue to fight.. for the Gods and the Mankind.. for they left it to burn inside me for all eternity.. that fire.. the desire.. to be the greatest of all champions, who ever lived. Finally, I have reached the heavy front doors of stone leading into her personal; slimy chamber, I will disable the effects of my helm for this fight, and tie my shield into my back, because I want it to be a battle to be remembered! Medusa, queen of the Gorgons! For your acts of cruelty, the Gods, I and the spirits of all your victims beckoning me all the way from the fabled Elysian Fields, demand only one thing.. justice. And then I swiftly charge, but so does the queen, my adamantine sword and her titanium spear clash, creating a massive shock wave of immense magical power unseen. Then I manage to deal a few critical blows to her chest, as she once again tries to petrify me with her gaze, yet I keep dodging her by using nearby pillars as a shield, then by equipping my own shield, and using it's magical power, Medusa unleashes her final petrifying gaze, as I call upon the shield's reflecting ability, the green ball of magic hurling back at her, starting to slowly turn her into stone. With haste, I run towards her, the sword ready at my side, and Medusa cries for one last time, as the adamantine sword pierces her heart, her green eyes close forever, and by cutting her neck, there drops her vile head, and from her stony carcass, two divine gifts in form of mythical creatures are allowed to be born into the world.. Pegasus and Chrysaor. Perseus: \"Now there is no need to walk back to the surface, when I can fly across the sky upon back of Pegasus, a flying horse of magic, for everything is in order. I have claimed my trophy to be taken back to Zeus, who assigned me this daring task, which I performed as any true hero would. There was never no need for the mask, except for getting past the horde.. of Medusa's armed, Gorgon warriors, but now is the time to celebrate, for the victory is mine. Pegasus.. let us fly above the clouds for a while, let the sunlight guide our heavenly paths, as ends a Monsterslaying Classic, to be followed by many a tale in a time unknown to all, except the eternally red dunes of sand.\" And so Perseus delivers the trophy, Medusa's Head to Zeus, and is immediately declared a living legend in all across the sacred land. I: Hades Returns From the Underworld Tangled long hair of black, he who wears a skeletal metal mask, one does simply not leave the Underworld, for to watch over the dead.. is Lord Hades's most sacred task. The primordial flames of charcoal grey, deep violet and archaic tangerine, fill Tartarus's depths with newborn masses of darkness, where Titans, the ancient destined lie imprisoned. The sword of Hades lives with the shadows, iris blue it may first appear to be, yet the hilt darkens and deforms it's wielder, while the blade devours on light's essence. Rise to paint the sky in blood red by using the souls of the dead, challenge the living, heroes and kings, call forth Cerberus, the three-headed hound, witness the eagles of Zeus descending, divine lightning, silence becomes profound, as a tidal wave sweeps over the lands and forests, Poseidon can be seen riding on the back of a seahorse, and so the three brothers, sons of Cronus and Rhea meet again. II: Hera, the Ancient Sorceress of Darkness I hail from the land of cold purity, an emissary of the colorless sun, who can tell you exactly, how the age of mysterious horrors began. Fail may I not, said the cultist, for this crusade is a sacred one, done in the name of her.. evil and dark Excellency.. o' Hera, the Ancient Sorceress of Darkness.. For ages you have plagued the Mankind, with words unkind, turning the already weak blind, o' why ye Gods so wrathfully choose.. to let the Fate doom all your actions.. it will always have sway over your will.. to set your hatred loose.. should you lower yourselves to spill.. blood upon ye golden crowns, then from that point onward, worthy shall you be no more. In time, you will try to strike us mortals down for good, but now, let it boldly dawn.. the fabled age of heroes, who will finally defend us, while only cunningly serving you, awaiting for the balance of power to shift, to cast a spell, that will let the Gods drift in all timelessness of a glowing crystal ball, which is used to open a portal, leading those who were born fearless, into a great hall of memories and images, where all timelines are shown, the past, the present and the future show their ethereal faces, which are still way too many, for even a being like me.. to behold, yet of such greatness is this one privilege in form of a calling, for I.. am devoted.. I.. am one of the chosen.. my.. will.. is burning.. with a fire radiating such spiritual strength unseen. Hera: \"And so He finally answered, and traveled beyond the seen walls, where by using high waterfalls, the Olympians climb towards the sky, to gather speed, so that he could fly, where many have tried to go, without ever even truly knowing why we chose to leave the earthly abode.. so downward and far behind.\" III: The God of Fire, Hephaestus, the Celestial Smith You forge such significant and magnificent weapons for the other Gods, yet they only let you stay in your separated sanctuary, the Earthbound Hall. You were born lame, gifted in all fields of craftsmanship, yet you were a cripple at birth, and for this, down to the Earth you were then cast by your mother, Hera, who deemed you unworthy of your sacred blood. You are still none other, than Hephaestus, the God of Fire, the Celestial Smith, in your capable hands, the hammer constantly strikes the hot iron. Surely, you would never let the tool of crafting and building fall. Hera and Zeus loved you not, but then the Goddess of Love, Aphrodite was given to you, and she surely did. Married you were then, she was there to support your timeless art, and the only one to witness your fire red inner beauty burning within. You then made a statue out of pure gold in her honor, of which beauty, literary and in craftsmanship, was unparalleled, truly remarkable. And to forever guard all your creations, you created a giant, black panther out of various jewels and iron. Living to be, to behold it was to be left in all awe, fear and astonishment. In the face of it's roars, and the thousands upon thousands of priceless jewels attached unto it's hard skin, it's very presence and appearance suggesting it could be from a local fable. Now, a set of bold and daring plans lie upon ye great worktable, and when you are once more able, a very special weapons and armors order awaits, including long titanium chains never to be broken are to be created. The thunderous voice of Zeus echoes in Hephaestus's Halls. Zeus: \"Complete this one task, my fallen son, and for you, the Gates of the Sky, leading up back to Mount Olympus shall be opened. This I promise in the sight of the night stars, to witness this moment of the divines, upon which both your might and pride are now fated to be restored. To Hades, you must forge a sword made out of flame and darkness, to help him with purging of the Underworld, which has to be done from time to time when wars are being caused and waged there, and to keep the Elysian Fields safe forever. To me, Zeus, you must forge a heavenly disc bearing a tremendous power, with an ability to float in the air beside me, equipping me with an endless stock of divine lightning bolts. To Poseidon, you must forge a new trident of your celestial quality, with so much force, that you may break the Earth in half with one hit, and divide the Sea with another. May all of the Olympians, and even the Ruler of the Underworld fight supremely in the face of any foe with your divine weapons, that are known to prevent all the actions and the events leading up to meaningless peril, and endless woe.\" Active volcanoes surround you in your enormous caverns, deep below the Earth, where you dwell, not so far away from Tartarus, the truest Underworld (Abyss), which Hades fully controls, bound to dwell therein.. until the world's last breath. IV: Ancient Lair of the Fiery Chimera Trophies in form of endless piles of human skeletons, sanguine is the color of this ancient lair. Malevolence of the raging aeons is captured in it's only inhabitant's intense; cold stare. Because of this one monster, often depicted to consist of many different animals. A lion, a goat and a serpent for one, a true hybrid creature above all. Nearly all passages of this cave were made to crumble many thousands of years ago, when the creature still freely wreaked havoc in the world above relentlessly. And I truly dare you to go, to where roaring evil sleeps ever so restlessly. O' Nyx, the mother of night, commence the grand work of twilight at once. Your glorious bastion of dying light will once more rise, and then you shall finally claim back the right to forever rule over the night's shadowy creatures. You carry souls of the deeply curious adventurers across the eyed bridge of perilous portents. Shine and guide the black sun's light into their grey eyes, and make them bleed from within their damaged brains again and again! And then you may unleash Chimera, to once more devour on our very energies of life. Only instant and burning pain to be felt, scorch the skin, and then cut through the flesh with precision of a well sharpened knife. O' Erebus, heir of darkness, your unwavering presence silences all of the messengers. Their tongues you take, of chaotic essence is your insanity of hate, which provokes those too weak to make choices, they will later truly come to regret. How could they not know, that with you around it's always dim, the sky feels heavy, first it rains, and then comes the hail. Not everything is showed in time, for the cold hands of death rest upon your shoulders now. Is this still to be your greatest, and most triumphant hour? If none will be able to hear ye cries in the dark, whatever will you then do? Just one misplaced step midst the laughing shadows, and the daylight's rays could easily die with you. Why did you even come to this forsaken place? To seek to eliminate another monster of the myth from the earth's face. Be warned now, for there will always be enough creatures gone completely wicked, replace the fallen one, and dye the dawn in blood. Erebus: \"Are you the lone torchbearer, the divider of darkness with too many monsters left to chase? You must be doing this for the sake of your entire; famed beast hunter's race, you savage lunatic.\" Full of dangers is the journey you have chosen, and now all of your dreams could come to a close so soon. The same burning pain will make your thoughts and memories drift, your mind nearly all drained out and broken. This legendary endurance of yours, however, is what separates true heroes from petty fools. You are no mere stalker of the prey, for you are a master of the wilderness. For you, this could still be a victorious day, if you somehow managed to end Chimera's reign of madness. V: The Last Flight of Icarus A sunlit tragedy above the temple of divinity, an embrace of the dark oceanic depths, the feathery wings scarred from the blue heaven, fall from higher than the clouds, swim in vain. Teardrops shed by the shore of crimson red sand, spirit of a boy departs for the Elysian fields, oars row steadily, as the architect goes mad, pleads of a mere mortal cannot be heard, retrieve the sinking body, ere Poseidon it claims. Hellenic maidens in the service of goddess Artemis rush to the scene, holding prayer beads in their hands, singing a soothing song of death and remembrance. O' great father sitting upon the golden seat of Olympus, have mercy on my son, who has fallen from safety of the sky, like a whisper carried away by wind, by the will of Helios, Icarus was plunged down, as he flew too close to the sun. VI: When By Three Brothers, the Earth, the Sky and the Sea Were Divided Saturn (Cronus), Jupiter (Zeus), Neptune (Poseidon), and Pluto (Hades) From Saturn and Rhea, this lightning-hearted one gained a beginning, still halfway in existence, later on to become both God and King. The Earth, the Sky and the Sea yet to be divided between the Three Brothers, and first Chaos would have to be diminished. They were all offspring of those two Titans, the ancient destined. Jupiter, Neptune and Pluto by their names, by them the Day, the Night, the Sun and the Moon would be given to the world in joy to be cherished. Man was created by Prometheus, and was offered many kind of things, Jupiter for one to keep watch over the Earthly World from the Sky above with aid of the eagles and their wings. Jupiter, to rule over the Sky and the Earth, lightning guards Mount Olympus, home to all future Olympian Gods. Neptune, to rule over the Sea with the wrath of the Winds, if given no other choice, yours is the world of Man with tremors to shake, and with rivers and lakes to flood. Pluto, to forever rule the Underworld, never to be seen upon the Earth, to watch over the realm of the Dead, and the fabled Elysian Fields. For when Man falls, he enters this realm of the Immortals, completely ridden off the gift of Life and Blood. The first woman, called Pandora, out of both stupidity and curiosity opened a very special jar, releasing all of the plagues within upon the Earthly World to freely spread peril and doom. And no more do the flowers bloom, no more do the birds sing. And so Chaos returns from it's long slumber, back into existence it will spring. Failing to realize it's faults, Mankind stands on the destruction's edge, in the deep embrace of Violence and Death. And the age at hand becomes so distorted in it's purpose, that in a fit of rage, Jupiter gives an order to Neptune to cover the world entirely in water. All of it's good things to be divided once again. Only thunderbolts clashing down upon the surface, they leave the Earth one by one, the Gods, and so the world goes empty for a long time. No more Man, the Sun nor the Moon, by the three Fates known to be cold, still with little joy this one special thread is cut. Yet Man will not be gone for good, for one day it's divine thread will be woven anew. During an event of redemption said to occur very soon. But how long will Mankind be allowed to grow, to learn of it's grave, yet past mistakes, to rise only to fall once more to Chaos's call. Then came another age, and now there were the Twelve Olympians, and many other Gods too, and Man was worthy once again. By their blessing we live, and believe that the Earth is indeed flat. And if the higher call of the Sky is given once more during this ever so shortening mortal life, then by their might, the world will once more go empty for a time. Hope, it does not ever again come to that.. and even though the screams of anguish echo across the air, in time, Destiny will surely be once again given back to it's rightful heir. Song of the Primordials / the Fabled Sisters of Fates Black Drachma of the Moirai, Fortuna holds no dominion over this coin, dropped on playground of the Three Watchers, of which the first is life's fairness (Clotho), the second is will's maliciousness (Lachesis), and the third is death's ugliness (Atropos). Spin, measure and cut many a thread, Destiny is weighed in hands of the Fates, you who observe, and then quietly dictate. Spin, measure and cut thousands of threads, in name of the gods, signal the keeper of gates, who leads souls to finality beyond love and hate. The Elysian Fields are open to the chosen, Tartarus gladly welcomes the sinful and broken. From the Immemorial Times of Nyx A Mysterious Voice: \"All of the Primordials were born of Chaos, in one way or another. Yet the most exceptional of them all was the primordial Nyx (Night), who has always stood at the center of cosmos's creation. Together with Erebus (Darkness), they also gave birth to a daughter, who would come to cherish the beauty of flowers and the radiance of daylight as her own. This young goddess, later on to be considered a primordial herself, was given the name of Hemera (Day). Nyx's other children include: the twin brothers Hypnos (Sleep) and Thanatos (Death).\" O' Nyx, the mother of night's calmness and sleep all of the shadows disperse and pass at your command, and so came the time of somnolent Hypnos, the firstborn; ruler of the dream-island Lemnos, the forgetful river Lethe, where day meets night, and claims a half of one's life. Then came the time of phantasmal Thanatos, the secondborn; the unseen god of fast judgments, an adviser to Hades, who would help Erebus achieve widespread dominance, beware his decaying hand's reach, a forehead's touch of death. Jason the Explorer, Leader of the Argonauts On a Quest to Claim the Golden Fleece of Crius Jason: \"I have heard all of the legends concerning the mighty Three Hundred and the Spear of Leonidas, from the kingdom of Iolcus to retrieve the Golden Fleece, I sailed on, accompanied by the Argonauts and the Argo, smiling at the wind, clouds of Zeus and sights of Greece.\" From Lemnos, the island of murderous women to Doliones of bare mountains, where dwelt giants known as the Gegeines, who attacked the ship at dock, yet were valiantly slain by Heracles, the slayer of tyrants, the hero of heroes, was then left behind, when his squire disappeared from the shore, while fashioning a new oar, tempted by the promises of a water nymph, sanity lost, Heracles could not possibly leave the warrior to his fate, and thus the Argo sailed on without his heroic aid. Then they arrived to Thrace, to greet King Phineas, who offerred them information, a location in Colchis of Crius, ram of Zeus, a god came to the rescue, when a navigator fell overboard near the Amazons, the course of the ship was rotated by lightning, which created a mighty whirlpool in the Aegean, miraculously they then escaped from throws of javelins, only to rest upon an foggy island belonging to Ares, where the immortal Stymphalian Birds waited in rest, pound ye shields of metal loudly, a heavenly test, scared off they were, and the journey continued. A Mysterious Voice: \"Sirens o' lustful; wailing and beautiful by appearance, beware of them, o' sailors brave. No pearl shining is worth of diving down to the deeps, where these cunning seductresses prey in wait. On Colchis, the king, angered by the fact, that great Jason had sailed across the Aegean, been on many isles, faced many perils, and yet he had come only for the fleece so golden and holy. Know that three divine tasks await, equivalent of the Trials of Heracles. That is the punishment for desiring an fabled artifact of godliness, status and wealth.\" Medea, the brunette beauty known to sorcery would cross paths with the wandering hero, sent by Hera, the peacock seeress of misery, her task was to only help, and never betray, yet the Fates allowed love to come in evil's way, and thus began their relationship so daring. An unfortunate chain of despairing events, a fire-breathing dragon spotted at a cornfield, cut it's head, remove one of it's sacred tooth, warriors slaying each other, such savages, throw a stone into the crowd, cast a spell, you who were bewitched by Aphrodite, further the confusion in the hands of Hera, a king's head must roll on the castle floor, Jason must find in himself to fall for Medea, together, enraged, they could easily slay Pelias. But nay, the cuckoo goddess of fertility fails, no death granted, hatred greatly grown, with haste they must now flee Hera's wrath to the kingdom of Corinth. The Retribution of Paris (Preview) His sharp eyes were asleep, o' watery Immortal's Son, the golden will of Apollo cannot be swayed, an arrowhead anointed with a sand viper's poison, the sun's light of music's beauty cannot be outplayed. The hero kneels before the defiled statues, one rises from midst a nearby bush of grass, wait until Achilles has denounced his virtues. Paris: \"This devastating arrow of justice carries the doom of Hector, and all of the Trojans who fell by your sword. Hades's domain awaits.\"",

      "The most challenging labor proved out to be acquiring of the magical and hallowed golden apples from the Garden of the Hesperides, for no easy paths lead there, it is either across the sea or the air, I must reach the isle, where the waves, wildly and calmly ride in tandem with the jumping fishes and the singing birds, that have come to enjoy of the area's strange tides, it is also wherein the Daughters of Hesperus, nymphs of the playful evening and beautiful golden sunset lie, waiting for the adventurers, to lure them, to break them, if they dared to touch any of the sacred apples.",

      "Finally, after hours of clever discussing, through sheer cunningness, almost ended up entangled in a cycle of pleasures, no more, only a moment's glamour, it already faded, fortunately, I did not have to fight the dragon, and now I must return with the apples obtained, for King Eurystheus is not going to believe his eyes, once he sees them, he will be furious I presume, for little did he think that I could actually return from the Garden unscathed, and what happened to the maidens, the nymphs.. well, their fates are not sealed, because them I could not possibly kill, for such divine beings those nymphs are with their smiles and angelic wings, and so, without further mysteries, the eleventh labor.. is finished.",

      "Jason the Explorer, Leader of the Argonauts On a Quest to Claim the Golden Fleece of Crius Jason: \"I have heard all of the legends concerning the mighty Three Hundred and the Spear of Leonidas, from the kingdom of Iolcus to retrieve the Golden Fleece, I sailed on, accompanied by the Argonauts and the Argo, smiling at the wind, clouds of Zeus and sights of Greece.\"",
      "From Lemnos, the island of murderous women to Doliones of bare mountains, where dwelt giants known as the Gegeines, who attacked the ship at dock, yet were valiantly slain by Heracles, the slayer of tyrants, the hero of heroes, was then left behind, when his squire disappeared from the shore, while fashioning a new oar, tempted by the promises of a water nymph, sanity lost, Heracles could not possibly leave the warrior to his fate, and thus the Argo sailed on without his heroic aid.",
      "Then they arrived to Thrace, to greet King Phineas, who offerred them information, a location in Colchis of Crius, ram of Zeus, a god came to the rescue, when a navigator fell overboard near the Amazons, the course of the ship was rotated by lightning, which created a mighty whirlpool in the Aegean, miraculously they then escaped from throws of javelins, only to rest upon an foggy island belonging to Ares, where the immortal Stymphalian Birds waited in rest, pound ye shields of metal loudly, a heavenly test, scared off they were, and the journey continued.",
      "A Mysterious Voice: \"Sirens o' lustful; wailing and beautiful by appearance, beware of them, o' sailors brave.",
      "No pearl shining is worth of diving down to the deeps, where these cunning seductresses prey in wait.",
      "On Colchis, the king, angered by the fact, that great Jason had sailed across the Aegean, been on many isles, faced many perils, and yet he had come only for the fleece so golden and holy.",
      "Know that three divine tasks await, equivalent of the Trials of Heracles.",
      "That is the punishment for desiring an fabled artifact of godliness, status and wealth.\"",
      "Medea, the brunette beauty known to sorcery would cross paths with the wandering hero, sent by Hera, the peacock seeress of misery, her task was to only help, and never betray, yet the Fates allowed love to come in evil's way, and thus began their relationship so daring.",
      "An unfortunate chain of despairing events, a fire-breathing dragon spotted at a cornfield, cut it's head, remove one of it's sacred tooth, warriors slaying each other, such savages, throw a stone into the crowd, cast a spell, you who were bewitched by Aphrodite, further the confusion in the hands of Hera, a king's head must roll on the castle floor, Jason must find in himself to fall for Medea, together, enraged, they could easily slay Pelias.",
      "But nay, the cuckoo goddess of fertility fails, no death granted, hatred greatly grown, with haste they must now flee Hera's wrath to the kingdom of Corinth.",
      "The Retribution of Paris (Preview)",
      "His sharp eyes were asleep, o' watery Immortal's Son, the golden will of Apollo cannot be swayed, an arrowhead anointed with a sand viper's poison, the sun's light of music's beauty cannot be outplayed.",
      "The hero kneels before the defiled statues, one rises from midst a nearby bush of grass, wait until Achilles has denounced his virtues.",
      "Paris: \"This devastating arrow of justice carries the doom of Hector, and all of the Trojans who fell by your sword.",
      "Hades's domain awaits.\""

    "text": "I felt cool air rush around me as the cover was pulled back. Gooseflesh rose along my arms and I grumbled, blindly reaching for the missing fabric. The sheets rustled as another body slid into the bed, curling around my exposed back before pulling the blanket back up. \"Mmm?\" I asked, my eyelids cracking open. The alarm clock on the bedside table read 3:21 a.m. \"It's just me. Go back to sleep,\" a voice murmured in my ear. I sighed, my head too fuzzy to comprehend the words. I closed my eyes again and immediately drifted off. The next thing I knew it was morning. Sunlight blazed through the window, shining on the cheery yellow walls. It backlit the red geraniums on the windowsill and glinted off the picture frames scattered around the room. The clock read 6:37 a.m. Zeus had an arm slung across my waist. I could feel his warm breath against the back of my neck. I turned toward him. He was sound asleep, his pale hair tangled around his face, his lips slightly parted, barely revealing the edge of his teeth. Zeus had pretty teeth, pearly white and perfect. It was an odd thing to admire, but I always had. Barely breathing, I leaned forward and brushed my lips against his. He made a sound in his sleep but didn't wake up. I carefully disentangled myself from his arms and slid out of bed before easing my way across the floor. I didn't want to wake him. I wasn't sure what had sent him here like this, stealing into my bed in the middle of the night, but experience told me that it probably had something to do with his wife. I grabbed a towel and some clean boxers and headed for the bathroom. I had a feeling that when Zeus woke up, I'd be in for quite a story. Better get in a hot shower beforehand. I turned the water on full blast and stepped out of my boxers, picking them up with my toes and flipping them into the clothes hamper on the other side of the bathroom. \"Ten points,\" I muttered. I turned back around and caught sight of myself in the mirror. My dark hair was sticking up at all angles and my eyes were squinty with sleep. I smirked. I wondered what would have happened if Zeus had seem me like this that first day. Stepping into the hot shower, I pondered that for awhile. What would my life have been like if I'd never met the man in the other room? It was hardly the first time I'd thought about it and I was no closer to the answer now than I ever had been. No doubt I would have gotten married to some girl, hopefully ending up with a kid or two. Would I have grown to love my wife? Perhaps not as a husband should, but there are other kinds of love. If she'd been a sweet woman, a kind one, then maybe we'd have become friends. Or maybe she'd have been a bitter crone and I'd have thrown myself off a parapet to be rid of her. I sighed. What use was it to dwell on the past? Those days were long dead, and if Zeus hadn't done what he had I'd be dead right along with them. I closed my eyes and tilted my head back, letting the hot water slosh over my hair. My mind traced it's way back through the centuries. The wooden swords collided with a sharp crack. \"Give in, Ganymede,\" the other boy jeered, striking out again with his sword. \"Never!\" I shouted, laughing. The game continued, the two of us circling each other, our swords connecting again and again. Isandros was good, very good, but I managed to hold my own. The other boys stood around, cheering for one or the other of us. Most of them shouted for me to win, but I knew it was only because I was the prince. If money had been involved, their bets would be on the boy facing me. Isandros came in toward me, his dark eyes flashing with a wild light. His sword came down hard, smashing into my own with such force that it was knocked out of my hand. I jerked back from him and managed to catch my foot of a rock, stumbling backwards and landing on my rump in the dust. Isandros came and stood over me, his sword at my chest. \"Yield?\" he asked. I glared up at him. \"Never. You'll have to kill me, Spartan jackass.\" He rolled his eyes and flicked away his sword before he leaned forward and grabbed my wrist. His hand was warm and steady as he hauled me to my feet. I pulled away as soon as I was upright and went to fetch my sword. \"You put up a good fight,\" he said from behind me. I gave him a haughty look. \"You're not half bad yourself.\" The others laughed, and I laughed with them. We were up in the hills above the city. Troy stretched out beneath us and beyond it the sea. There were about ten boys on the hillside, ranging from lowly farm boys to me, the prince. Sheep dotted the stony hills around us. We were supposed to be tending them, but a man could only stare at sheep so long before he went mad. Sword fights were necessary. Usually we pitted ourselves against each other as Trojans versus warriors from other cities. Isandros favored fighting for Sparta. With the duel over, the boys scattered across the hills again, back to their sheep. I picked up my staff and started off toward my own flock. Isandros trotted after me. \"You really are getting better, you know,\" he said, brushing some of the hair out of his eyes. His hair was a curling mess that always seemed to be slipping free from the leather tie at the back of his neck. I smiled a little. \"Thanks. I'm glad to hear it.\" Isandros was the son of a Trojan war hero and I half-believed that he'd been born with a sword in his hand. I, on the other hand, didn't have half of his natural skill or any of his grace. As a warrior I was a bit of a disappointment, but I tried my best and practiced every day. Isandros had volunteered to help me as much as he could and I was grateful for it. \"Do you want to meet up in the training yard later today?\" he asked. \"Sure.\" \"All right. Well, I guess I'll see you there,\" he said, and turned on his heel to leave. I watched him go, the bright sunlight casting him in bronze, defining the broad expanse of his shoulders and glinting off his dark hair. The sheep wandered up and down the hillside, bleating and snuffling at the grass. I gazed at them from my vantage point on top of the hill, my head leaning against my hand. My mind was blank with boredom and my head itched beneath the hot shepherd's cap. I reached up to scratch it, wondering if this was all my life would ever amount to. A shadow flew along the ground. I glanced up and spotted an eagle soaring high above me, its feathers glinting. It flew over the pasture before slowly circling back around, scanning the ground for field mice and rabbits. It flew directly overhead again, and I looked up at it and was amazed to see how brightly it's talons shone, as if they were sheathed in copper. The eagle swerved sharply to the left and began to descend, alighting on a tree stump a few yards away from me. I blinked at it, startled that it'd come so close. The eagle glared back at me, head cocked to the side. I'd never seen a bird so big. The eagle was as tall as a person, his head the size of my own. I sat frozen, uncertain what to do. If he attacked me, I didn't like my chances of fighting him off before those talons ripped through my flesh. \"Prince Ganymede!\" I jerked around, startled. I shot a quick glance at the eagle but it hadn't moved. \"Prince Ganymede!\" \"I'm over here,\" I called. The eagle turned his head toward the voice and then took to the air, those powerful wings stirring up the dust so badly that I had to cover my eyes. When I opened them the eagle was high in the air, soaring towards Troy. I watched him go, still astonished by the encounter. A servant came up over the hill, his tunic fluttering as he ran. \"My prince, the king wishes to see you at once. I am to watch the sheep.\" I didn't argue, gladly leaving the flock in the servant's care. I met my father in his solar, talking to his advisor, Perdix. My father smiled at me and reached out his hand. I embraced him. \"Ganymede, Perdix has just brought me some very good news.\" Perdix smiled at me. He was a jovial, pudgy man with empty brown eyes. \"Ah, yes, Prince Ganymede. For the last several weeks I have been communicating with a certain leading man in Corinth, Pentares, who has presented his daughter to us in the hopes of a marriage alliance between his house and that of king Tros. Pentares, though not royal, has control over much of the Corinthian military, and his daughter, Aristomache, is said to be one of the most beautiful girls in Hellas. It'd be a fortuitous alliance.\" I looked at him for a few moments before turning back to my father. He smiled at me, though there was a warning in his eyes. \"So I am to marry this Aristomache?\" I asked, keeping my voice level. \"Well, it is certainly something to consider,\" said Perdix. \"Though it isn't official yet.\" \"It would be a good match,\" my father told me. \"I want you to think about it.\" \"But don't think too long,\" joked Perdix, \"Better to get an answer back to Pentares before he changes his mind, no?\" \"Thank you, Perdix,\" Father said. \"Now why don't you go and take some refreshment? My cellars are at your disposal.\" \"Thank you, Your Grace,\" he replied, sweeping a low bow before trotting out of the room. Father waited until the door closed behind him before speaking. \"I know how you must be feeling. I know how I felt when they told me I was to marry a woman I'd never met.\" \"So I am to marry her?\" \"It would be a good match, Ganymede,\" he said again. \"And you must marry somebody. Why not this girl?\" I stared at the floor, my stomach churning with uncertainty. He was right. I'd always known I was going to marry a girl, most likely one I'd never met. However, knowing and doing were two different things. \"Just think about it, won't you? It'd be for the good of the city.\" He patted my shoulder and turned back to his work table. \"How's the swordplay coming?\" he asked, unsubtly changing the subject. \"Isandros says I'm doing much better.\" \"Good. I'll have to come watch you today.\" I fidgeted with the edge of my tunic, unsure how I felt about that. I might be doing better, but I'd never actually beaten Isandros. I didn't want Father to see me lose.\"You don't have to. I'm sure you're busy.\" \"I can spare the time,\" he said, giving me a small smile. I smiled back. \"Your father is here,\" Isandros muttered. We were standing at the edge of the training yard, practice swords in our hands. \"I know. He said he was going to come watch me.\" I gave Isandros a frantic look. \"Please, don't beat me too badly.\" He smiled at me. \"I never beat you very badly these days. Like I told you, you're getting a lot better at this Ganymede.\" My heart swelled with pride. We took our stances. Father watched at the edge of the ring. My older brothers Ilus and Assaracus were with him. My sudden good mood vanished. It was one thing to lose in front of my father, but my brothers were a different matter entirely. Ilus was the eldest, serious and severe. He was a scholar and skilled tactician. Assaracus was the warrior in the family. I believed Isandros could beat him, but not many others could. He watched me now with a lopsided smirk, just waiting to laugh when I fell in the dust. I groaned under my breath. \"Don't think about them,\" Isandros whispered. \"Focus on me.\" I looked across at him, at his narrow face and high cheekbones and dark, dark eyes that watched me from beneath his straight brows. I let the rest of the world disappear until it was just me and him and our swords rising to meet each other. Clack, clack, clack. We whirled around each other, side stepping and feigning, coming together and splitting apart, our swords dancing. I kept my eyes on him, watching his every move. Finally, he managed to get through my defences and placed his sword against my throat. We both froze, breathing heavily. I dropped my sword to the ground. \"Good show,\" I heard Father call. Assaracus was laughing. Soon they were all standing next to us. Assaracus clapped Isandros on the back. \"Poor fool never had a chance,\" he said. I bristled, but Isandros came to my rescue. \"I wouldn't say that, sir. There were a few moments when he had me pretty scared.\" \"Then you must scare easily. Ganymede swings that thing like he's trying to swat flies with it.\" \"Assaracus,\" my father scolded. \"That's enough out of you.\" He turned to Isandros. \"Thank you, young man, for helping my son. I know it must take a lot of your time.\" Isandros bowed. \"It's nothing, Your Grace. I enjoy it.\" He grinned at me. \"Ganymede is my favorite student.\" I felt my cheeks grow warm under such praise and turned away before he noticed. When I turned my head, I caught my father looking at me in such a way that made my embarrassment turn to fear. His expression was neutral, but there was something in his eyes that made me want to crawl away from his scrutiny. \"Well, if you don't mind, I need to take your favorite student away from you tonight,\" he said. \"We've got a few things to discuss.\" \"Of course, Your Grace.\" Isandros bowed again before picking up my training sword and going back to the barracks. Father watched him go before turning to my brothers. \"You two, go on inside.\" Assaracus and Ilus glanced at each other but did as they were told. My heart thudded in my chest as I watched them leave and I wanted to race after them to get out from under my father's gaze. \"Ganymede,\" he said. I glanced up at him. \"Yes?\" \"Come with me.\" We walked across the yard, toward the city gates. I followed him up the stone steps to the top of the city wall. Troy's walls had been smaller then, not the colossal things that faced Odysseus and Agamemnon years later. Still, at the time they'd been the tallest structures I'd ever seen. Standing on them, I could see my entire world, the glittering city and the hill country and the sparkling blue sea the swept out before me in all of its mystery. The sun was setting over the sea now, making it look as if the water itself had caught fire. Father dismissed the guards standing watch and we looked at the sea together. \"You need to make some decisions, Ganymede,\" he told me, still watching the sea. I looked down at my hands resting on the battlements in front of me and said nothing. \"You are a prince of Troy, my son. And princes don't always get what they want.\" He finally looked over at me. \"Your brothers were in the same scrape you are now. Neither was overly thrilled to marry, but they did because they knew the importance of it. Aristomache is a good match for the people of Troy. I know you don't want to hear that, but you're seventeen years old. It's time to start facing the facts.\" I didn't reply. \"I know that you're the third son, and that you'll hopefully never have to bear the burden of my crown. But our house still needs to be built. Heirs need to be born so that our line will remain strong. And so that my sons' legacies will continue on.\" He turned away again, staring out at the sea. \"You legacy will not be furthered by Isandros son of Aktor.\" I felt my face go red and I prayed that the sunset would mask it. \"I don't know what you mean,\" I muttered. \"Oh, Ganymede.\" My father sighed. \"You don't have to hide from me. I've known about you for a long time.\" He reached over and grasped me by the shoulder. \"I'm not angry with you. I know that you can't help it. But you have to think about what's best for others, not just your own desires. You can't marry Isandros, nor any other man. You can't father children from such a scheme. I am asking you, for the good of our people and for the good of our family, to set aside your infatuations for now and to move forward with our agreement with Pentares of Corinth.\" I couldn't answer at first. A lump had formed in my throat and to my shame I was on the brink of tears. I considered what he was asking of me and felt like my heart was breaking in two. Put aside my \"infatuations\" as he called them? How? If I could so easily cast them aside I already would have. Did he think I wanted to feel like this? \"I don't know how to do that,\" I croaked. \"I can't make my feelings go away, Father. I've tried to do that...\" I shook my head, unable to finish. How many nights had I laid awake in my bed, wishing that I could be different than I was? That I had been born normal? \"Maybe,\" he murmured, squeezing my shoulder. \"Once you see this girl, it'll be easier for you to--\" I shook my head, cutting him off. \"It won't. Father, I--\" The words caught in my throat, but I forced them out. \"I've never... felt that way... for any woman. I've tried, but I just can't...\" I covered my face with my hands, hating myself. Why couldn't I just do what he asked? Why couldn't I make myself desire something that men were supposed to want? \"I want you to try, Ganymede. I know it won't be easy, and I know that you might never feel the way a husband ought to feel about his wife,\" I had to bite back a sob when he said that, my fingers digging into my scalp, punishing me for my wretchedness. Father continued. \"But I think if you give it a chance, you'll be able to find some happiness with your wife. Maybe not the kind of romantic love most young people desire in a marriage, but in a marital relationship affection and respect are just as valuable as any of that. I think you could be happy, Ganymede. And, after a few children have been conceived, perhaps you could find... other ways to fulfill your needs.\" I uncovered my face and looked up at him. He watched me, his head tilted to the side. \"You mean,\" I hesitated, almost afraid to ask. \"That you expect me to have relationships with men outside of my marriage?\" \"Affairs aren't exactly uncommon, Ganymede,\" he said ruefully. \"Between men and women or otherwise. I know a few men who discuss their male lovers with their wives openly, though you'd better be pretty sure she approves before you do that.\" He chuckled, clapping his hand on my shoulder one last time before turning to leave. \"I want you to be happy, Ganymede. I know it may not seem like that now, but I really do want you to enjoy your life. But we all must make sacrifices.\" I stayed up on the wall after Father left. I looked out at the sea, wondering if there were any foreign lands where it was acceptable to be like I was. I imagined walking down a public street arm in arm with Isandros, turning to smile up at him the way I'd seen women do to their sweethearts. My heart hurt with longing for such a place, aching all the more from the belief that no such paradise existed. At last I turned away from the sea, and began trudging toward home. The stairs were cast in shadow now that the sun had sank below the horizon and I had to keep my eyes on my feet to see where I was going. That's why I didn't see the girl until I ran right into her. She was a laundress from the look of it, and I'd smacked into her so hard that she'd dropped the basket of clothes she was carrying. She let out a little wail and fell to her knees, picking up the scattered clothes off the ground. \"I'm so sorry,\" I said, sinking to my knees as well and helping her. There must have been a hundred garments in that basket and they'd been flung pell-mell across the paving stones. \"I wasn't watching what I was doing. Are you hurt?\" \"No, sir,\" she replied. Her tone was brusque. I felt my ears turning hot. \"I really am sorry.\" We picked up the rest of the clothes in silence. I plucked up the last tunic and brought it over to where she was kneeling beside the basket. I dropped the tunic on top of the pile. She glanced up at me and did a double take, her mouth falling open a little. \"My--my prince,\" she stuttered, rising to her feet. \"I'm so sorry. I didn't know it was you.\" I smiled politely. \"It's all right. I'm the one who wasn't paying attention.\" The girl kept watching me, her eyes wide. She had astonishing eyes, such a pale blue that they looked nearly colorless in the dim light. They were drifting back and forth across my face in a way that I recognized. I was used to women ogling at me, just like I was used to men teasing me about my pretty face. Assaracus always said I looked like a girl. My mother had called me beautiful until I was fourteen when Father told her to quit embarrassing me. The girl was beautiful too. She had long dark hair swept into an ornate updo on top of her head. It contrasted dramatically with her light skin and pale blue eyes. She also had a pair of full red lips and the kind of curves that would fill other men's dreams long after they'd seen her. I stared at her, trying to make my body respond. My eyes admired her, but only in the way someone admired an artist's statue. My heart wasn't aroused and neither was anything else. \"Excuse me,\" I murmured, trying to move past her. \"Of course, my prince,\" she murmured, her tone demure. She stepped aside and did something strange with her eyes. She glanced at the ground and then back up at me, her pale eyes shining through a forest of black eyelashes. Her gaze smoldered, and it was suddenly difficult to move. My breathing stuttered. The world narrowed until all I could see were those blue eyes. Then the girl blinked and the connection was broken. She giggled and turned away, casting me one last look over her shoulder. \"Goodnight,\" she called, giggling again, her hips swaying as she walked. I gaped after her, my thoughts sluggish. Taking a deep breath, I looked away from her, shaking my head a little to get my thoughts moving again. I wasn't entirely sure what had just happened, but it had been incredible. I'd felt like my entire existence could have been snuffed out by those eyes. Was this what other men felt around women? I looked back at the girl, but she was already gone, having vanished as suddenly as she'd come. I stepped out of the shower and toweled off. A drop of water had gotten down in my ear and I had to tilt my head to the side until it drained before I could move on with my life. Then I brushed my teeth and slipped on some new boxers before waltzing out to face the day. A few years ago I'd decided to move to a new bedroom and had furnished it all on my own. My new room was small--this is, comparatively small. There was a platform bed on one side, a dresser and closet on the other, and a small, built-in desk in the far corner with a bar stool in front of it. The closet wasn't a walk-in, I'd gotten the antique dresser and barstool at a garage sale and refurbished them myself, and--horror of horrors--the bed was a queen size. Zeus had nearly gone into conniptions the first time he'd walked in. \"Are you dumping me?\" he'd demanded. \"What? No.\" \"Then why does it feel like you're trying to squeeze me out of your life?\" He'd walked around the room, stretching out his arms like he was measuring the space. \"Seven steps. It takes seven steps to get from one end to the other. I can barely breathe in here!\" I'd rolled my eyes. \"Oh, come on. There's two of us. This is plenty of room.\" He'd whirled on me, eyes bright. \"I know what this is,\" he'd accused, pointing his finger at me. \"You've become one of those weird minimalists!\" That had made me laugh. \"You say it like it's a bad thing.\" \"It's sad. Look at this place. It's tiny. You're the cupbearer to the King of Heaven. You deserve better than a broom closet.\" \"But this is what I want,\" I'd replied. \"I like it how it is. Bedrooms aren't supposed to be the cathedrals of your life, Zeus. They're supposed to be your quiet monastery, a place of peace and mediation.\" I'd read that in a book once. \"So you've decided to become a monk now?\" he'd grumbled. I'd smiled and strolled over to him before wrapping my arms around his waist. \"Not exactly,\" I'd purred, standing on my tiptoes to kiss him. Zeus had gotten over it eventually, and though I'd never convinced him to take up the lifestyle himself, he had admitted to me once that my \"little\" bed was cozier than the one in his room. He was still lying in it when I came out of the bathroom, his long limbs sprawled across it like a giant starfish. I chuckled at him as I grabbed a pair of jeans and a T-shirt out of my closet and pulled them on before going over to my desk. I switched on my laptop and listened as it hummed to life, swinging my bare feet as I waited for it to warm up. I glanced over at Zeus, my memories sweeping up around me again. The next morning, right after breakfast, I went to find my father. \"I want you to go ahead with the marriage negotiations,\" I told him. He nodded and wrote something down on a scrap of parchment. I had to go out with the sheep after that. Life as a prince of Troy wasn't always as grand as it sounded, and life as the third prince was even duller. I plopped down under a tree, my face leaning against my palm, my jaw slack with boredom. There was a rustling in the branches above me. I glanced up-- and nearly had a stroke when I saw the colossal bird watching me. I gawked up at it for a long time, barely believing what I was witnessing. It was the eagle from yesterday, and he was scrutinizing me, his head turned so that he could see me with one of those big yellow eyes. I felt my heart flipping in my chest, and I thought for a moment that I was going ot be sick. It was one thing to see the monster eagle from a distance, but this close I could make out each individual feather and count its giant claws, each one longer than my hand. Holding my breath, I eased away from the tree, trying not to startle it. The eagle watched me go, never taking its eye off me. We stared each other down until I was out from under the tree and the leaves obscured my view. There was a loud whooshing noise, and the eagle flew off, soaring above my head until it disappeared into the distance. I watched it go, praying that it wouldn't come back. Not much else happened that afternoon. I stayed away from any trees, and the eagle never came close to me again, though I did him swooping by every now and then. Finally, I headed back to Troy, shooing my flock in front of me. I left them in their fold and then walked into the city, pulling off my shepherd cap as I went. People looked at me as I walked down the main road. Many of them bowed as I passed by. I smiled at them, hurrying to get away. I could feel their eyes on me, boring into my skin like invisible awls, gnawing away at my flesh. Mother always said that they stared because I was beautiful, but I didn't feel beautiful when they watched me. I felt like an insect trapped in the bottom of a bowl, scrabbling uselessly for a way out as little boys jeered at me from above. The day was ending and the streets were crowded with people trying to get out of the city before the gates closed for the night. Every once in awhile I'd feel someone rub up against me. I ignored this as well as I could, but sometimes I couldn't help but cringe as I felt a hand brush along my arm in a very non-accidental way. I'd always look around, but with this press of people it was usually impossible to tell who'd done it. Up ahead, I saw a familiar figure walking toward me, a basket of clothes under her arm. It was the blue-eyed laundress from the night before. She caught my eye and brazenly held my gaze as she drew closer. Just like before, my breath caught in my throat and I couldn't look away. Her lips turned up at the corners. At that moment the crowd around me compressed as a large cart rumbled down the street, people pushed to the sides of the road as it passed by. The girl met me then and turned sideways to squeeze between me and another traveler, her breasts pressing against my upper arm and her free hand snagging in my belt, tugging on it a little. I shot her an astonished look, ready to tell her off, but in that instant I met her gaze again and lost all power of speech. \"Pardon me, my prince,\" she whispered between barely moving lips, her blue eyes dancing. And then she was gone, swallowed up in the crowd like she'd never existed. I scanned the street for her, searching for her dark head bobbing through the mass of people. I never caught sight of her and eventually gave up, turning back toward home. I practiced my sword play with Isandros once I got back, but I was so distracted that I could barely focus. \"What's up with you?\" he wondered after I'd lost my third match in ten minutes. I shrugged. \"Just not into it today I guess,\" I muttered, avoiding his eyes. \"Is this about your father?\" he asked. I glanced over at him. \"What?\" \"Yesterday you looked pretty nervous when he said he wanted to talk to you.\" I shuffled my feet, my cheeks blazing. If only Isandros knew the subject of our conversation, he wouldn't be so quick to pry. I decided to give him an answer, though not an entirely truthful one. \"I'm getting married.\" He raised his eyebrows. \"Really? To whom?\" I shrugged. \"Some girl from Corinth. I've never met her.\" \"Oh.\" I looked over at him, desperately wanting to know what he was thinking. Was he jealous? Did he not want me to get married? Or did he just not care enough to say anything else? \"Um, how do you feel about that?\" he asked eventually. I shrugged again. \"It's a good match.\" He snorted. \"Glad my parents haven't found any \"good matches\" for me yet. Sounds pretty boring.\" I smiled a little. \"It does, doesn't it?\" We were quiet for several moments, neither of us knowing what to say. \"Well,\" he said at last, clapping his hands together. \"You don't have to stay out here if you don't feel like it. Why don't you take the rest of the night off?\" I think he wanted me to be excited, but the words made me feel hollow inside. I didn't want to leave him, not when I only had so much time before I wed. I argued with myself that now was the time to start the separation, making it gradual so that I wouldn't feel so much pain once I had to give him up for good. My heart rebelled against the notion. I never wanted to say goodbye to Isandros. \"We don't have to,\" I replied. \"I can keep going.\" He gave me a little smile. \"As much as I'd like to, I think we should take a break. Go get a good night's sleep.\" I had to relent. We went into the armor room and put up our practice swords. Isandros playfully punched my arm. \"See you tomorrow?\" he asked. \"Yeah.\" He shot me one last grin and headed off toward his home. I stood in the doorway of the armor room, unsure what to do. I wanted to go after Isandros, grab him by the back of his tunic and beg him to run away with me. We'd go find that mythical land where men could be together openly, not just in the shadows and behind closed doors. I wanted to be with Isandros, forever, not just as some love affair after I'd begotten a son or two. I leaned against the door frame and rubbed my chest, feeling my heart break inside me. There was a rustle of fabric next to me. I flinched and glanced to my left, only to see the blue-eyed girl. I swore and took a step away from her. How had she managed to sneak up without me seeing her? The girl smiled at me, tilting her head to the side. \"Did I scare you?\" \"What are you doing here?\" She pouted. \"You don't want me here?\" She took a step toward me and lowered her voice. \"It looked like you did, when you were searching for me in the market earlier.\" \"I didn't--\" \"Shhh,\" she place two fingers on my lips and looked up at me beneath half-lowered eyelids. \"You don't have to apologize. I looked for you as well.\" She grinned. \"Only my search was more successful.\" \"You shouldn't be here,\" I told her, glancing around. No one else was nearby, but I didn't want to risk being seen with her. It was obvious that she was some kind of harlot. \"Do you want to send me away? Why? Don't you think I'm pretty?\" she tipped her head to the side, like she was genuinely curious. \"I want you to think I'm pretty. Would you rather I have fair hair?\" She wasn't making any sense. \"Your hair is fine,\" I said. She smiled again. \"Good. I was hoping you'd like it.\" Suddenly, she put her hand on my chest and pushed me back into the armor room, grabbing the front of my tunic when I almost fell backwards. She was strong for a girl. Laundry must be hard work. \"What are you doing?\" I demanded. \"What would you like me to do?\" \"What? Get away from me!\" \"Why?\" she asked, completely unperturbed by my tone. She leaned even closer to me, her hands winding up into my hair, bringing my face close to hers, her soft breasts pressed against my chest. I couldn't help but look into her eyes again, and all my thoughts vanished. \"I've seen your sad eyes, Ganymede,\" she said, her breath fanning across my face. Her voice was like a silk rope, slithering around my mind and tying me fast. \"Don't you want me to make you feel better? I can make you feel so good.\" Without another word, she kissed me full on the mouth. I froze, feeling her lips move against mine. I watched her, my eyes wide open. I'd never been kissed before and it was strange to have someone's face that close to my own. I noticed how long her nose was and the tiny flecks of black khole smattered across her cheek, like she'd rubbed her eye. Once her eyes weren't boring into mine, my brain was able to function again, and after another moment I disentangled myself from the kiss. She blinked up at me, surprised. \"What's wrong?\" \"What's wrong?\" I demanded. \"I don't even know you. And I'd like you to leave.\" She stared up at me, her mouth hanging open. \"You want me to leave?\" she asked. \"Yes,\" I said, exasperated. Her bottom lip began to tremble and to my utter amazement, her eyes began to sparkle with unshed tears. \"So, you really don't want me?\" Swallowing hard, I shook my head. \"I'm sorry.\" \"But, why? Why don't you want me? You said I was pretty!\" I could only gape at her helplessly, completely unsure what to do. \"Please don't cry,\" I said. She stomped her foot. \"Why shouldn't I cry? You keep watching me and keep smiling at me and you say that I'm pretty and then you do this!\" \"I do think you're pretty,\" I said. \"Really. It's just that, well, I'm not looking for anyone to, um, make me feel good right now.\" She huffed and looked up at me again, her blue eyes blazing. \"Why not?\" She narrowed her eyes. \"Is there somebody else? There's somebody else, isn't there?\" \"No,\" I said, wondering how in the world I'd gotten into this mess. The girl didn't say anything for a few moments, the heat fading from those hypnotic eyes. She considered me. \"Do you not want me to touch you because you don't want me? Or is it because you're afraid?\" She came toward me again, her eyes beginning to smolder. I looked away before they could ensnare me again. I felt her touch my chest with her finger, trailing it up to the collar of my tunic. She began rubbing the material between her fingers. I snatched her hand in my own, trying to push her away. \"Have you ever been touched, Ganymede?\" she asked. I glared at the far wall, refusing to meet her gaze. \"I want you to leave,\" I growled. \"I'd be gentle with you,\" she whispered. \"I'd be good to you, my prince. I'd make you feel like a god.\" \"Get out.\" \"Please,\" she pleaded. \"Please, don't send me away. I've dreamed of you, Ganymede. I've dreamed of you every night since I first saw you. You fill my head all day and chase me though my sleep. I can't think about anything but you. Let me touch you. Let me make you feel like a man.\" I closed my eyes. Who was this woman? How had I allowed this to happen? \"I can't.\" I sighed. \"I'm sorry, but I can't do it. I have to go.\" I let go of her hand and walked past her. She didn't try to stop me. I paused in the doorway and glanced back at her. She was still turned away from me, her eyes on the floor. I told myself to leave, to run away from this crazy girl and never look back. But something about her expression made that impossible. Inexplicably, I almost felt sorry for her. I cleared my throat. She looked up at me, her extraordinary eyes suddenly dull. \"By the way,\" I said, giving her a tiny smile. \"I never asked you what your name was.\" She blinked at me a couple of times, and I wondered if she was going to answer. \"It's Olympia,\" she said eventually. I nodded once then hurried away. My dreams were a mess that night. They started out fine. I was walking through a beautiful forest, my hand in Isandros' as he led me to our paradise. \"We're nearly there, Ganymede,\" he said, looking at me over his shoulder. His eyes were dark and warm and his hair was slipping out of its tie again. I wanted to reach forward to push it back into place but he was walking too fast and it was all I could do to keep up. I heard the roar of a waterfall up ahead. \"I love you,\" I told him, wondering where I got the courage. He smiled at me, showing off his dimples. My stomach fluttered when I thought about our destination. A romantic pool at the foot of a waterfall? My mind wandered to places it shouldn't. We'd be all alone there. All alone, no other person around for miles. I grinned, warmth spreading across my cheekbones. There were just a few more trees up ahead. The path led around them, the sun shining through the leaves. And then everything changed. The trees fell away, and stone walls rose up around me. Isandros changed into my brother Ilus, and the roar of the waterfall became the sound of a large crowd of people, their voices echoing around the chamber. My father stood at the far end of the hall with another man, both of them looking at me with eyes of ice. A slender figure stood beside them, draped in a gauzy veil. I tugged against Ilus' restraining hand. \"No,\" I begged. \"No, please, don't make me. I don't want to marry her! I don't want to marry her!\" \"Shut up,\" Ilus snapped, not looking at me. A shadow fell across us and I looked up to see the golden eagle swoop through the rafters, alighting right above my father, its yellow eye watching me. \"Let me go!\" I screamed, fighting against my brother. \"Please, let me go. Isandros! Isandros, help!\" I looked around the room but Isandros was nowhere to be seen. We came to the front of the room and Ilus held me still as my father blessed the marriage. \"May you have many children,\" he said, his deep voice booming throughout the hall. \"And may this young woman tame my son's deviant heart.\" \"Aristomache,\" said the other man, presumably Pentares, her father. \"Take off your veil. Let Ganymede see you.\" I struggled against Ilus, sobbing to be let go. \"I can't marry her, I can't. Father, please--\" The girl pulled her gauzy veil aside, revealing her face. Pale blue eyes scorched my skin, drawing me into a whirlwind of color and sound. I screamed, flailing, falling through space and time, sure that I was about to be smashed to splinters. Then I was lying in soft grass, not falling at all. The roar of a waterfall filled my ears, along with the gentle lap of water on stone and the rustle of wind through the trees. \"Isandros?\" \"My prince,\" he whispered in my ear. I grinned and rolled over to look at him, only to jerk back when I came face to face with a stranger. He was young, around my own age, with inky black curls and almost-colorless blue eyes. With a start, I realized that he looked just like Olympia. His pretty lips curled up in a smile and he crawled toward me on hands and knees, his eyes holding me in place. He rose over me where I lay sprawled on my back, his hands on either side of my head. \"I've dreamed of you, Ganymede,\" he whispered. They were Olympia's words spoken in Isandros' voice. \"I've dreamed of you every night since I first saw you.\" The stranger leaned down and kissed me, just like Olympia had. Only it was nothing like when she'd kissed me. Fire roared through my veins and I lost my mind. The strange boy's hand cradled the back of my head and I leaned up into the kiss, my eyes slipping closed. My hands crept around his back and I pulled him down onto me. He groaned and bucked his hips against me, grinding against my pelvis. I gasped, tilting my head back and feeling his lips descend down my throat. \"Isandros,\" I whimpered. \"No,\" said the stranger with Isandros' voice. \"Don't say his name. You're with me now.\" I looked up at him, melting beneath his gaze. \"Who are you, then?\" But before he could answer, the dream melted away, the paradise shattering into a million silver stars. I opened my eyes, waking alone in my own bed. I pushed myself upright, feeling more confused than I ever had. I was so aroused, my cock stiff beneath the sheets. I ran a hand back through my hair, my face growing warm with the memory of the dream, even as I was overcome with chagrin. The boy in the dream hadn't been Isandros. He wasn't the man I loved. He hadn't even been real, just some male equivalent of my would-be seductress. And yet, when I'd woken, my first thought hadn't been shame over my dream-adultery. It had been disappointment that I hadn't gotten to learn the stranger's name. \"Dammit,\" I said, collapsing back against the pillows. My cock was lifting up the sheet, creating a tent. I glared at it, knowing I'd never be able to sleep if I didn't take care of it. I slid my hand beneath the sheet and closed my eyes, deliberately thinking about Isandros. I imagined his face hovering above me, his lips parted and brown eyes full of lust. Those were his fingers gripping me, his hand pumping up and down, sending shivers of pleasure across my entire body. I let my imagination roam wild, thinking about the other things we'd be doing to each other if the first part of the dream had been real. I imagined the way his curly brown hair would wave back and forth as he ground his erection against mine, our breathing coming in frantic gasps. Then he'd flip me over onto my stomach. In my fantasies, it was always Isandros who did the penetrating. Perhaps it wasn't very masculine of me, but I'd always wanted to be on the bottom half of my first sexual encounter, with Isandros--the stronger one, the braver one, the more manly one--entering me. I really didn't have much to offer anyone, but people said I was beautiful. I would be try to look beautiful for my love as he took me. I imagined what Isandros' face would look like once he was fully inside me. His head would be tilted back, his eyes squeezed shut and his mouth open in a silent cry of pleasure. I groaned just thinking about it, my hand moving faster beneath the sheet. In my mind's eye, he began thrusting in time with my real-life hand movements. I was sure that I'd never want him to move that fast in actuality, but in my fantasies he rode me ragged, pumping into me for all he was worth. As I rose closer to my peak, my thoughts became frantic and my control slipped. Without me being able to stop it, the boy in my delusion changed. His skin lightened, his hands gripping my hips, holding me steady as he fucked me. Isandros' brown curls darkened to black and his face became radiant, his eyes otherworldly. I pressed my free hand against my mouth to keep from crying out. The strange boy whispered to me again, using Isandros' voice. \"I've dreamed of you, Ganymede,\" he said, looking down at Fantasy Me with those haunting eyes. \"I've dreamed of you every night since I first saw you. You fill my head every moment of the day and chase me though my sleep.\" He tightened his grip on my hips and pulled me back against him as he lunged forward. Fantasy Me squealed and Real Me moaned against my fist. \"I can't think about anything but you.\" He slammed into me again. \"Let me touch you.\" Slam. I was so close to my climax that I started trembling. \"Let me make you feel...\" he growled, shoving himself into me one last time. \"Like a man.\" In real life, I twisted into my pillow, pressing my face into it as I shouted, my body spasming as I released. I collapsed against the bed, my ears ringing and my face still buried in the pillow. It was several moments before I could move. When I finally did, I rolled onto my back and stared at the ceiling, waiting for my breathing to slow. I contemplated what had just happened. Isandros was the love of my life, yet he'd not been the one I'd screamed for. I'd shouted for the stranger. Embarrassment swept over me, almost powerful enough to eradicate my euphoria. Almost. The phone vibrated on the table. I glanced over and saw a text message on the homescreen. It was from Hebe and read: \"Hey, dad with you?\" \"Yeah\" I texted back. \"K. He need anything?\" I glanced over at Zeus before replying. He was still asleep. \"I got it handled.\" \"K\" I regarded the text mournfully, restraining myself from calling her up and giving her my \"K\" rant. I didn't care how dismal society became, \"K\" would never be an acceptable response. I tapped back to my messaging home screen and pulled up Hermes' number. \"Hey,\" I typed. \"Connect Coffee House. One 16 oz. black, one 16 oz caramel hazelnut iced latte with whip. \" I put the phone down and turned back to my computer. A blank, white screen gazed back, the little black cursor winking at me. I placed my hands back on the keyboard, ready to type, when my phone buzzed. Glancing over at it, I saw his response. \"I'm not your errand boy.\" I rolled my eyes. \"Your dad says don't forget the whip.\" I lied, flipping the phone over so that I couldn't see the screen. I looked back at my computer. I was starting a new novel and wasn't quite sure how to begin. It was days before I could look Isandros in the eye. The dream lingered in my thoughts, the memories leaking into my bloodstream and becoming a part of me. I tried not to think about what had happened, either the dream or the orgasm, but it was impossible not to. I began making excuses not to see him, as foolish as that was, to avoid the awkward silences that had started sprouting up between us. I tried telling myself that it was just a stupid dream. I hadn't actually done anything wrong. But I couldn't seem to convince myself. I'd seen Olympia once since the bizarre interview in the armory. She'd been across the street from me, carrying her load of laundry. I caught her staring, but she'd immediately dropped her gaze and turned another way. Seeing her had only made me think of the dream boy and something stirred in my gut, both painful and tantalizing. The pasture was the only place I could find any peace. Up there was nothing but wind and the smell of sheep and the sea. I'd walked across the Trojan countryside, allowing my mind to empty itself of all its convoluted cares. Every once in awhile I'd search the sky for the giant eagle, but it never appeared. Clouds would sail across the heavens like ships on the sea, and fluttering birds darted around them like schools of fish, but the eagle, the king of the sky, never revealed himself to me. Father had sent a letter to Pentares of Corinth, relating my eagerness to move forward with negotiations. We expected my bride to set sail for Troy within a week. I'd begun staying out in the hills later than usual, coming back after dusk, trying to avoid people as much as I could. Isandros would wait for me in the training yard. He never mentioned my strange new moodiness, but I could read the concern behind his eyes. Finally, after the fourth day, he cornered me outside the door of the palace. \"Have I done something to upset you?\" he asked. I blinked in surprise. \"No, of course not.\" \"Then why do you keep treating me like I slapped your grandmother?\" I chuckled. \"I'm sorry. Really. It's not anything you've done, it's just...\" I trailed off, unsure what to even say. Honestly, not even I knew what was wrong. I just felt... empty inside. Like my heart had shriveled up in an attempt to escape the pain of my circumstances. I looked at Isandros, my insides melting at the concern in his eyes. It made me happy. It made me very, very sad. He tilted his head to the side, his curls falling over his forehead. \"This is about your engagement, isn't it? You haven't been acting right since that night.\" I nodded. That was part of it, but not nearly enough. \"I don't love her,\" I muttered, feeling embarrassed to say it out loud. It sounded so childish. \"I don't even know her. What if we end up hating each other?\" He stepped toward me and put his hand on my arm. My entire world shrank to the warmth and weight of that hand. \"You won't,\" he told me. \"No one could ever hate you, Ganymede. You're too good.\" I glanced up at him, meeting his gaze. He smiled at me, his eyes tender. \"She'll be a lucky woman.\" I shook my head. \"I'm not so sure. Even if she does learn to like me, what if I can't do the same to her?\" I paused, weighing my next words. \"What if I fall in love with somebody else?\" He frowned at me. \"Are you in love with somebody? Is that the real reason for all this? Some girl's gone and caught your eye?\" He grinned. I glanced away from him, blushing. \"No,\" I muttered. He laughed. \"Poor Ganymede. Love's a fickle bitch, isn't it?\" \"Yes,\" I whispered. He patted my shoulder, and suddenly it didn't feel quite so good. \"You'll make it through. Just give the girl a chance. And if she doesn't turn out to be everything you've wanted, well,\" he winked at me. \"Who says you need to spend every night in her bed, huh?\" He patted my arm again and headed off in the opposite direction, leaving me staring after him. The next day when I took the flock out, I went north, keeping the sea to my left and the wild hill country to my right. The hills were steeper here, and less vegetation grew. There was enough for my herd though, so I didn't worry too much about it. I led them far out into the wild, the city vanishing behind us. After a couple hours the landscape had changed dramatically. Lush pasture land spread out around me in a long plateau. At the furthest edge, the earth dropped away, leaving a sheer cliff-face, the surf pounding against the thin stretch of beach a hundred feet below. I picked my way to the edge of the cliff, feeling the sea breeze ruffle my hair and tug at my clothes. I tilted my head back and breathed in the briney air, letting it wash over me and blow away my heartache. A shrill cry caught my attention. Opening my eyes, I saw the golden eagle wheeling above me, its beak and claws glinting in the bright light. It flew out over the sea and dove, its wings curling in around its body until the instant before it hit the water. Its wings unfurled and it skimmed over the surface of the waves, catching a large fish in its talons. I watched as the eagle labored to keep the squirming fish aloft, but after a few moments it let go, the fish living to see another day. The bird swooped upwards again, sharp eyes searching for another catch. I stood watching the eagle for quite some time, envying its freedom. Occasionally it'd let out a shriek of exultation, whirling and diving without a care in the world. At last it must have grown tired of all its failed fishing attempts and went in search of less slippery prey, flying up into the clouds until I lost sight of it. I returned my gaze to the sea. I wondered if my betrothed had heard the news yet. Would she weep when she found out she was being shipped off to a city she'd never seen? Or would she rejoice to be getting a husband before she became an old maid? One of these days I'd get the chance to ask her. Something hit me on the back of the head. I cried out, more from surprise than pain. The blow had pushed me to my knees and I whirled about, searching for my attacker. Another scream filled the air. I looked up. There was the eagle, flying away from me, something red in its claws. I gaped, and reached up to my head. Sure enough, my shepherd's cap was gone. The bastard had snuck up behind me and snatched it away. I watched the eagle go, expecting to see it drop the cap into the ocean. It wheeled in the opposite direction though, and flew a few more seconds before releasing the cap, probably realizing that it wasn't food. I huffed and ran over to get it, being sure to keep the eagle in sight in case he swept around again and tried to take my head off this time. The bird flew into the distance and disappeared behind some trees. I reached the area where I'd seen it fall, but still had to search around through the underbrush before I spotted it, snagged on a thornbush. I pried it out of the thorns, sticking myself a couple times in the process. \"What happened?\" someone asked from right behind me. I started so violently that I dropped the cap again. I turned to see Olympia standing there, her hands tucked behind her back as she regarded me. \"What in the--where did you come from?\" I sputtered. She raised an eyebrow at my tone. \"I've been here the whole time,\" she replied. \"I was walking along the beach and saw you standing at the edge of the cliff. I came up to make sure you weren't thinking about jumping.\" It was difficult to argue with her assurity, but I hadn't seen her down on the beach. I told her as much. Olympia frowned. \"You must be blind then.\" She changed the subject before I could reply, pointing at the cap in my hands. \"Why do you wear that thing?\" \"It's a shepherd's cap,\" I muttered, putting it back on my head. \"I'm a shepherd.\" \"I thought you were the prince?\" \"Yes, well, I'm the third prince, which means I get to watch the sheep.\" I turned and walked back toward my vantage point over the sea. I was hoping she'd leave, but I doubted it. Sure enough, I heard her following after me, her bare feet whispering over the grass. \"Do you like watching sheep?\" I laughed a little. \"Nobody likes watching sheep. Sheep are the stupidest animals alive. And the dullest.\" \"I don't know, it seems like it might be fun.\" We'd come to the edge of the cliff again. I looked down at the crashing waves beneath me, watching the foam collect at the edge of the sea. \"It's not,\" I told her. \"But sometimes it is nice to get away from the city.\" She made a sound of agreement. I could feel her eyes on me but I kept my attention on the sea. I was a little nervous, being out here all by myself with this girl. She didn't really look like a harlot, but I remembered all too clearly the persistence she'd displayed in the armory. \"Why are you out here?\" I asked. I saw her shrug in my periphery. \"I like being alone sometimes. And the sea is beautiful.\" I glanced over at her. She was looking out at the sea now, her eyes squinting against the afternoon sunlight. I turned to do the same. \"I'd love to see more of it,\" I said. \"Where all have you been? What cities have you gone to?\" I shook my head. \"I've never been away from Troy.\" She seemed surprised. \"Never?\" \"Nope.\" She appraised me. \"How old are you, Ganymede?\" \"Seventeen.\" \"So young,\" she murmured. I looked over at her. \"You're not exactly ancient yourself,\" I pointed out. She grinned. \"Where would you go, then, if you ever left Troy?\" I considered it. \"Somewhere far away,\" I said. \"Somewhere nobody's here's ever even heard of.\" \"What would you do there?\" I smiled a little sadly, thinking of my paradise. \"I'd live.\" Olympia studied me, seeming to hear the edge in my voice. \"You aren't living here?\" \"Not really.\" We were quiet for a bit, neither of us seeming to know what to say. \"I'd like to see Paphos,\" she said at last. \"The birthplace of Aphrodite,\" I said. \"That doesn't really surprise me.\" \"What?\" \"You seem like the kind of person who'd spends a lot of time making herself beautiful.\" She scoffed, but didn't try to argue. \"Not all of us wake up looking as perfect as you do.\" I snorted. \"Nobody wakes up looking perfect.\" \"Of course not,\" she said sarcastically. We lapsed into silence again. The wind was blowing a little harder now. It pulled some of her dark hair out of its braid, and blew it around her face. I tried to keep my eyes to myself so that I didn't give her any of the wrong ideas, but it was difficult not to look at her. I kept thinking about the boy in my dreams. He might have been her brother, they looked so alike. I sighed. If only Olympia had been born a boy. I shook off the thought, ashamed of myself. I loved Isandros. It was wrong to fantasize about another man, even one that didn't exist. She was watching me again, her eyes as blue as the sky and sea around us. \"Why was your cap in the briar bush?\" she asked suddenly. \"An eagle stole it.\" She raised an eyebrow. \"It did,\" I huffed. \"Right before you showed up. The thing flew right over my head, yanked it off and dropped it in the thorn bush.\" She smirked. \"Maybe he thought you looked better without it.\" I rolled my eyes. \"What? You think eagles don't know what's stylish?\" \"I think you're reading too much into this.\" \"Ha!\" she lunged toward me and plucked the cap off my head before darting away. \"Hey!\" She dangled the cap in front of me, grinning like a lunatic. \"See, you look much nicer without it. Let the world see your pretty hair.\" I tried to grab it back but she danced out of the way, laughing. \"Give it back!\" \"You want it?\" she said, \"Come get it.\" And she took off running, her skirt flying out behind her. I raced after her, surprised by her speed. Her laughter peeled across the pasture, and to my surprise I found myself laughing along with her. \"Give it back!\" I called. \"Never!\" I was gaining on her. Her skirts were beginning to slow her down and she was laughing so hard that she couldn't focus on running. Right as I was about to close my hand around her arm, she dashed to the side and I stumbled, my hands clutching at the air. \"Missed me!\" I turned to see where she'd gone. She was standing at the edge of the woods, waving my cap in her hand. \"All right, give it back,\" I called, reaching out my hand. \"Huh-uh.\" \"Olympia,\" I said, using my best prince-voice. \"Give me back my cap.\" She stuck out of her tongue and vanished into the forest. I shook my head in amazement. She really was mad. I jogged into the forest, taking a moment to let my eyes adjust to the dim light. \"Olympia?\" There was a giggle from above. I looked up. She was perched on a limb high above my head, swinging her leg over the side. \"How did you get up there so fast?\" I asked. She just smirked. \"Why don't you come down?\" I said. \"I don't want to climb up there after you.\" \"Then I guess you don't want your hat back.\" I shrugged. \"It's not like I can't get a new one, you know.\" She shrugged as well but tossed me the cap. \"Fine, if it means that much to you. But I don't want you to put it on. You're hair's too pretty to be covered up.\" I rolled my eyes. \"Whatever makes you happy, I guess.\" I bent down to retrieve it. There was a rustle of fabric and before I could stop her, Olympia jumped down and landed right in front of me. \"Are you crazy?\" I shouted. The limb she'd been sitting on was more than halfway up the tree. She could easily have broken her legs. She brushed her hands together, completely unconcerned. \"Calm down, Ganymede, everything's--get down!\" Olympia's hand slammed into my shoulder, knocking me down. I landed on my stomach in the dust, my face full of prickling grass. There was a brilliant light above my head and an inhuman shriek that made my blood freeze in my veins. I looked over and couldn't believe my eyes. There, in the middle of the clearing, was a snake's head as big around as a bull, with steam curling out of it's maw. It was so massive that the head was all I could see, the rest of it's body hidden by the undergrowth. Olympia stood in front of me protectively, facing the creature. The snake reared up its head and opened its mouth, it's gullet glowing red as an ember and getting brighter by the second. Before I could stop her, Olympia ran toward it and leapt into the air. The snake unleashed a volley of fire, instantly incinerating her. I saw her body dissolve in midair, ashes blasting back from her glowing bones. I pushed myself to my knees and screamed her name, knowing it was too late. Then I realized what I was seeing. The glowing figure that I'd thought was Olympia's ignited skeleton was actually a man. He landed in front of the snake, his skin brilliant as molten gold, his hair shining white like hot iron. He stretched his arms out to the sides before bringing his hands together with a boom that shook the earth, blew back the trees and made my hair stand on end. A twisted bolt of lightning arched out of his fingertips, blasting the creature to cinders and bone. The snake screamed and jerked as it was obliterated. Then, as quickly as it had begun, it was over. The snake was dead, nothing but smoking remains. The man slowly lowered his hands, balling them into fists at his sides. He stood with his back to me, the fiery glow fading from his skin until it was no more brilliant than my own. His clothes--Olympia's dress--had burned away, just like Olympia herself. I sat there trembling, my mind refusing to believe what my eyes had just witnessed. \"Are you all right, Ganymede?\" he asked. His voice was deeper than my own and smooth as honey. I didn't answer. I couldn't. The man glanced over his shoulder at me, allowing me to see his face for the first time. I felt a pang in my chest. He was beautiful, his long, straight nose and sharp cheekbones softened by long waves of silvery blond hair and lips shaped like a bow. His jaw was covered by a beard the same silver-blond color as his hair. He contemplated me a little sadly with eyes as pale as the noonday horizon. \"Ganymede?\" I gaped at him, my mouth opening and closing like a fish. \"What happened to her?\" I finally asked, not sure what else to do. He made an amused sound, though he was still watching me warily. \"Olympia? She was just a glamour. The lizard burned the magic away.\" I nodded, trying to get a grip. \"So, she never really existed then. All right.\" I eyed him, doing my best to keep my gaze from wandering any lower than his face. \"So if Olympia was a glamour, as you call it, then who are you?\" \"Can't you guess?\" \"You're Zeus?\" He smiled. \"I knew you were smart.\" \"Not very.\" I rose to my feet and glanced away from him. \"Can I go home now?\" \"Of course, if you want to.\" I turned away and walked out of the woods, my limbs stiff as an automaton's, my mind a jumble of incoherent words and images. I could feel his eyes on me, but I was too afraid to look back. Too afraid of my own emotions to let him see my face. I half expected him to follow me, but he didn't. I gathered up my flock and took them back to Troy, shooting nervous glances over my shoulder the whole trip back. It was too early to put to sheep back in their fold, but I found one of the servants to take over for me. That might have been irresponsible of me, but I had too much on my mind to bother with such things. I trudged through the byways of Troy, trying to come to terms with this new development. In the light of this new information, I reviewed my short acquaintance with the strange girl Olympia, a young woman who had shown up unexpectedly one day and forced her way into my life. Now I knew that the girl hadn't been a girl at all, but the king of the gods disguised as a woman. I recalled the unprecedented power of her eyes, the way they sucked me into her world and made me forget how to breathe. I blushed furiously when I recalled how she'd pushed me up against the back wall of the armory, her hands in my hair and her tongue trying to tease it's way past my lips. That had been a Zeus' tongue, a man's tongue and a man's lips and a man's body pressed up against mine. It was mortifying. It was arousing. I halted in the middle of an empty street and covered my face with my hands, cringing as I remembered my behavior. I'd been rude to Zeus. I'd pushed Zeus away. I'd chased Zeus through a meadow at the edge of the sea like he was an ordinary human being. I groaned, trying to escape the memory. What had he thought of me up there on the cliff, droning on about sailing away from Troy like some stupid actor in a tragedy? And why had he disguised himself as a woman? Why had he tricked me? I chewed my lip, refusing to believe that it had been in pursuit of me. Why would the king of the gods try to seduce me, a mortal, a boy, when he could have anybody he chose? It must have been some sort of mischievous joke. Maybe he'd figured out my secret and wanted to poke fun at me. Maybe the gods had made a wager to see if the homosexual prince of Troy could be convinced to bed a woman. I shook my head, so humiliated by the thought that I began to cry, tears trickling down between my fingers, adding to my shame. I couldn't make the tears stop so I ran and hid behind a rubbish heap where nobody could see me. I sank down behind the heap, curled my arms around my knees and cried, feeling more miserable than I ever had. I was so stupid and wretched that even the gods had begun to make sport of me. In that moment I truly began to hate myself, and I hated myself even more when I remembered how Zeus had looked after killing that serpent. He'd been the most extraordinary thing I'd ever seen, far lovelier than the Olympia glamour. If that person had pressed me up against a wall, I would have given him anything he wanted. I was certain that he'd seen my admiration. I could only wonder if he'd gone home and told the other gods about it yet. That possibility made me cry even harder. I stayed there for too long, sobbing like a little boy. At last I managed to compose myself enough to head for home. I hurried back to my father's house, trying to keep out of sight. When I did meet people I was careful to look away from them so that they wouldn't see my bloodshot eyes. I was almost home when I rounded a corner and nearly smacked into Isandros. He grinned at me for a moment before he noticed. I tried to turn away but I knew that he'd seen. \"Ganymede?\" \"Please excuse me,\" I muttered, trying to move past him. \"Ganymede, wait, what's the matter?\" I kept walking, but he reached out and caught me by the elbow. I stopped. I couldn't deny him anything. \"Are you all right?\" \"I'm fine,\" I said, keeping my face turned away from him. \"Did someone hurt you?\" I looked back at him. There was a dangerous glint in his eye. He's ready to defend me, I realized with a start. Warmth spread through my chest. I gave him a small smile. \"No. I'm fine. Really.\" And in that moment I was. He shook his head, not believing me. \"Tell me who did it.\" I considered. Should I tell him what had happened? Would he even believe me? I wasn't sure whether I believed it myself. \"Honestly?\" I said at last, \"I did it to myself.\" He narrowed his eyes. \"I don't believe you.\" \"No, it's true,\" I said. \"I was stupid. I pretty much walked right into it.\" \"Ganymede, what are you talking--\" \"Do you know what I am?\" I asked suddenly, before I could change my mind. \"What?\" \"Do you know what I am?\" \"You're... the prince.\" I took a step closer to him, my heart teetering between joy and terror. Even the gods knew about me. If the gods knew, surely everybody else did too. Maybe I'd been wrong all along. Maybe I'd been the blind one. Maybe this boy was just as good a liar as me. \"I like boys,\" I whispered. \"I like men the way other men like women.\" Whatever he'd been expecting me to say, it certainly hadn't been that. Isandros blinked at me, seeming uncertain what to do. \"Um, all right,\" he said. I scrutinized his expression, not knowing if he'd fully understood what I'd been trying to tell him. My sudden bout of courage was quickly slipping away, and I wanted to run and hide from him. Taking a deep breath, I forced myself onward. \"What I meant to say, Isandros, is that I... I like you the way other men like women.\" Isandros dropped his eyes from my face, staring at the ground. \"I see.\" My heart plummeted. I sucked in a ragged breath, my eyes filling with tears again. \"I'm sorry,\" I blubbered. \"I'm so sorry, Isandros.\" I fled from him, suddenly wanting to be anywhere but Troy. He didn't try to stop me. I ran outside the city walls, and into the wilderness beyond. I ran until my lungs felt like they would burst and then I stumbled to a walk, only to run again as soon I had energy enough. My feet carried me up hills and down nearly unseen forest paths. I didn't care where I went, I just couldn't be in that city anymore. I couldn't be near anybody who'd recognize me. I felt like such a fool. What had I been thinking, telling Isandros that? Had I gone mad? But even so, now I knew. There could be no more hope for us. He didn't love me back. I sobbed as I ran. This pain hurt a thousand times worse the Zeus' games. This was the kind of pain that drove men to fall on their swords to end it all. I kept running until the sun began to set and I was miles away from home. The hills became steep and rugged, but I kept on going, trying to outrun my fortune. At last I came to the top of a mountain, my legs trembling from exhaustion and my mouth parched. I sank down onto the ground and looked over the world. I could see Troy in the distance, a city of pale white stone shining like a beacon in the fading light. The sea was beyond it, a thin blue haze at the edge of the world. Dusk was descending over the east and the west burned with orange flame as the sun dipped beyond the horizon. I looked up at the sky, watching as the stars began twinkling into existence, wondering if I'd ever be able to get far enough away from this place. The sound of footsteps echoed beneath me. I glanced down the mountain, half expecting to see a bear lumbering up the slope. Instead there was a figure striding toward me, his pale hair catching the last few rays of sunlight. I made a face and slunk back away from the edge, hoping he wouldn't see me. \"I know you're there,\" he called. I sighed and didn't respond. I didn't know how much more I could handle today. I'd expected him to keep walking up the same path I'd taken, the one that wound up the side of the mountain, but then I heard a whooshing sound and suddenly Zeus was standing in front of me. Two huge wings were protruding from his back, casting me in shadow. He calmly folded thema behind him and they disappeared. He gazed at me, his expression serious. \"It took me a while to find you,\" he said. I didn't reply. He was wearing clothes now, a deep green chiton with a silver colored himation draped across his shoulders. His hair was woven into a braid with a few wisps coming loose and framing his face. A golden circlet rested on his forehead. \"What are you doing all the way out here?\" \"I needed to get away.\" He studied me, no doubt noticing my red, swollen eyes and tear stained cheeks. I glared back at him, wanting him to see what he'd done. Wanting him to know what he'd put me through. \"Oh, Ganymede,\" he murmured. I drew in a ragged breath. \"What do you want?\" I asked, shocked that I had the courage to confront him. \"What I've always wanted,\" he replied, walking toward me. He knelt in front of me and looked me full in the face, those piercing blue eyes unraveling my soul. He reached out and brushed his knuckles down the side of my face. My skin burned where he touched me. \"I don't want you here,\" I said, trying to ignore my body's reaction to him. \"I'm sorry for lying to you.\" I glared at him, wondering what sort of game he was playing now. \"Why did you?\" His lips tilted up in a shy smile. \"I figured you'd want a girl more than a man.\" My cheeks blazed. \"I don't believe you,\" I whispered. He narrowed his eyes. \"No? Why not?\" \"Because there's no reason for you to want me that way! You're the king of the gods. You're married to the most beautiful goddess in the world. You could bed anyone you want, any time you want. Why would somebody like that be interested in somebody like me?\" He appraised me, his head tilted to the side. \"What do you mean, somebody like you? Haven't you ever looked at yourself? Do you know who you are? You're a prince of Troy! And you're the most splendid creature I've ever seen.\" He caught my hand in his and pulled it toward him, playing with my fingers as he spoke. \"I told you before, remember? I haven't been able to sleep since I first saw you that day in the field. I had to find out who that beautiful boy was, sitting out there watching the sheep. I disguised myself as a laundress and searched through the town, hoping to find you.\" He glanced up at me from beneath his lashes, just like he had that first night I'd met him, disguised as Olympia. His eyes froze me in place, reducing my thoughts to a crawl. \"Wait,\" I said, trying to regain my power of speech. \"When did you see me with the sheep?\" The only time I'd seen Olympia out in the pasture was earlier that afternoon. Zeus grinned. \"How much do you know about me, Ganymede?\" I thought about it as he continued to fiddle with my hand. He linked his fingers between mine, gently pressed his thumb into the center of my palm, massaging it. He studied my fingernails, running the pad of his thumb across their edges. It was very distracting. \"Why are you doing that?\" I asked. He shrugged. \"You interest me. I want to know all of your secrets.\" My heart sped but I kept my voice neutral. \"And are my fingernails revealing anything to you?\" I asked drily. \"Mmm, a great many things actually.\" He glanced up at me. \"But you didn't answer my question.\" \"I don't know. I know all the basic things about you. The things the priest taught me.\" \"Like what?\" He only sounded half interested, his focus still on my hand in his lap. His left hand was skimming further up my arm, brushing over the blue veins in my wrist. \"Um, like that you're the king of the gods.\" \"The priest really knows his stuff, doesn't he?\" Zeus said. He was gently squeezing his hand around my arm then pulling it away, watching the white imprint fade as the blood rushed up under the skin. \"I know you're the god of the sky and that you bring thunderstorms.\" \"Very insightful.\" I blushed. \"All right, I know that you have five siblings, who I won't name, and I know you've fathered dozens of other gods and heroes who I also won't name. You have a temple at Knossos, married your older sister, and apparently have a fetish with hands.\" He turned to look at me. Without breaking eye contact, he brought my hand up to his face and sucked one of my fingers into his mouth. I gasped, instinctively trying to pull back. He tightened his grip around my wrist, not letting me go anywhere. He sucked my finger deeper into his mouth until the entire thing was inside. Zeus swirled his tongue around it, making me gasp again. It felt strange and disgusting and very good. He pulled back, releasing my finger with a plop sound. \"For your information,\" he said, as if nothing had happened. \"I married two of my older sisters. And two aunts. And one childhood friend.\" I was still reeling from the finger sucking. \"What else do you want me to tell you about yourself?\" He grinned at my reaction and sucked another finger into his mouth. It wasn't as shocking this time, but seemed even more erotic. I could only stare helplessly as he did it, his eyes never leaving mine. \"What is my emblem?\" he said, once he'd released me. \"Uh,\" I was having difficulty thinking. Zeus was kissing me, pressing his lips into the palm of my hand and moving downward, his lips barely brushing against the skin of my arm. It made my hair stand on end. \"Ganymede? What is it?\" he whispered, pausing to nibble at the sensitive skin near my inner elbow. \"It's, it's an eagle, isn't it?\" I answered. He was so close to me now, I couldn't take my eyes off of him. \"Mmm,\" he hummed into my skin. \"That's how I saw you.\" \"What?\" He'd reached the top of my shoulder. I could feel his beard brush over my skin, his lips ghosting over my collarbone. \"The first time I saw you. I was an eagle.\" He began kissing my neck and I forgot my own name. \"Oh,\" I whispered. I'd been answering him, but he took it as an invitation. He pushed me back, laying me down against the sandy ground. He hovered over me, doubling his efforts. He kissed me, hard, one hand on the side of my head, the other drifting down over my body before sliding up my inner thigh. I froze, pulling back from the kiss. This was too fast, we were going way too fast. He looked down at me, his pale eyes clouded with lust. It made my heart skip a beat and also made me afraid. He was a god. I couldn't say no to a god. \"Please,\" I pleaded. \"Please, stop.\" Zeus blinked at me, his face expressionless. For a moment I wasn't sure if he was going to listen to me. Then he rolled off and allowed me to sit up. \"I'm sorry,\" I mumbled, straightening my clothes. He was looking away from me. I bit my lip, afraid that I'd made him angry. Finally I heard him exhale loudly through his nose. He turned to face me, his expression apologetic. \"No. Forgive me. I got carried away.\" I blushed and looked down. \"It's all right.\" He reached out and stroked my cheek with the back of his knuckles. \"You were crying when I first arrived. Why?\" I turned my head away from him, ashamed of myself. Every time I was near Zeus, I seemed to forget that the rest of the world existed. Now my memories came flooding back. Isandros' rejection, Zeus' 'torment'. After what had just happened, I wasn't sure about the second one now, but the disappointment I felt about the other was still raw. I felt his fingers grip the edge of my chin and turn me back to face him. Those extraordinary eyes lifted the secrets out of me. \"He doesn't love me,\" I told him. \"Isandros doesn't love me. He never did.\" \"And you loved him?\" he asked, his eyes softening. I nodded, swallowing hard. Would he be angry about that? \"This Isandros is a fool, then.\" Zeus said, his hand keeping my face from turning away again. \"I'd give anything to be able to have your affection.\" I blushed crimson. \"You don't mean that.\" \"I do.\" I looked up at him, my eyes wandering over his lovely face. \"You know, you don't look the way I always imagined you would.\" He smirked. \"Disappointed?\" \"Not at all,\" I smiled. \"I always thought you'd look like an old man.\" \"Well, I look older than you do.\" It was true. Zeus was a man grown, not a boy like Isandros. It was a different, exciting kind of beauty. \"I don't mind,\" I said. We looked at each other for another long moment, neither of us speaking. The breeze blew my hair into my eyes and he reached up to smooth it back. \"You said earlier today that you wanted to get away from Troy,\" he said. \"Is that still true?\" I nodded. \"Now more than ever.\" I cringed to think about going back to that city and meeting Isandros. \"Then what would you say about coming home with me?\" \"Home? You mean, to Mount Olympus?\" He smiled, \"Would you like that?\" I couldn't believe my good luck. Then I realized something and my elation fell. Zeus noticed. \"What is it?\" \"How long would I be staying there? Only, only for a little while, right? Then I'll be sent back?\" \"Did I say that?\" He leaned forward and caught me in a kiss. Every thought I had fled, my entire world condensing to feeling his mouth on mine. After a moment he pulled away and laughed at my expression. \"You liked that, did you?\" he asked, running his thumb across my bottom lip. \"I liked it, too. When I asked you to come with me, I wasn't talking about just for tonight, I was talking about the foreseeable future. I want you to live with me.\" I bit my lip, unsure how I felt. I barely knew this man. I was attracted to him, but I didn't love him. Was I about to make the biggest mistake of my life? And yet, what was left for me in Troy? A future wife I couldn't love? Secret flings with young men behind her back? Seeing Isandros' face every day, knowing that I'd destroyed our friendship? I met Zeus' gaze, saw those crystal eyes looking back at me, and I suddenly knew what I was going to do. \"Take me away.\" There was a rap at the door. I slid off the bar stool and went to answer it, hoping it was Zeus' son with our coffee and not Zeus' wife with a baseball bat. Hate for it to be a repeat of last time. I opened the door a crack, waiting a moment before peeking around it just in case Hera tried anything. \"Delivery for one boy toy and his sugar daddy,\" a surly voice called from the other side of the door. I opened it further and took the coffee from Hermes, thanking him. \"What, no tip?\" he sneered. I smiled at him. \"Oh, sorry, almost forgot.\" I rummaged through my pocket, pretending to look for something. \"Here you go.\" I pulled my hand out, flipped him my middle finger and closed the door before he could react. \"Coffee?\" Zeus called from the bed, cracking one eye open. I smirked. \"Yup. Got your favorite.\" I placed it on the desk and hopped back up onto the stool. I was halfway through the first page of my story and didn't want to lose my momentum. I heard him slide out of bed and walk over, yawning. He picked up his sugar-loaded, poor-excuse-for-coffee and started sipping, his eyes on the screen. I squirmed to have it under his scrutiny, repressing the urge to cover the screen with my hands. It was the rough draft, nowhere near presentable. \"What'cha writin'?\" he asked. \"Smut?\" \"Sorry, no.\" \"You should write some smut.\" I snorted. \"Yes, really put my abilities to the test.\" \"Hey,\" he said. \"Smut writers are talented too. They're just misunderstood.\" \"Okay, Your Grace.\" I clicked out of the tab, knowing I'd never be able to come up with anything while he was standing there. I glanced up at him, seeing him watching me back, sucking up his iced latte through the straw. \"So,\" I said. \"Should I be expecting the Queen of Heaven to come knocking?\" He made a face. \"Not this time,\" he muttered. \"Well, hopefully not anyway.\" He swirled the straw around in his drink, shifting the ice cubes. \"Zeus, what happened?\" I recognized the look in his eyes. He looked vulnerable, flustered, so unlike his usual self. It worried me. He glanced up at me through his eyelashes, making my head spin just like it always had. He put his drink down and took a step toward me, the space between us vanishing. He took my face in his hands and kissed me, desperation marked in every movement. I knew this routine, knew it like the back of my hand. I kissed him back, my arms going around his middle, trying to comfort him as best as I could. He clung to me, kissing me like it was the only thing keeping him alive. \"Do you want to go to the bed?\" I whispered in a brief moment when my lips were free. \"Yes.\" The eagle soared high above the earth. I clung to Zeus, my arms wrapped around his neck, the cold wind whipping my hair back. The tops of my arms and legs were cold, but every part of me that was pressed against the eagle was warm, half buried in his soft feathers. My shepherd's cap had blown off a while ago and when I'd mentioned it, the eagle had screamed in glee. The earth was spread out beneath us like an over-sized map. At first I'd been afraid to look down, my face pressed into Zeus' neck, but once I realized that I wasn't about to die, I dared peek out at the world. My fear fell away, replaced by such joy I could barely stand it. Half the world was green and the other half blue. Zeus flew along the coast line, allowing me to see both sides. Trees and houses and people looked like ants from this height. I saw men and women walking around doing their evening chores, not noticing the giant eagle with the boy on his back. I laughed, my heart too full of happiness to contain it. Zeus glanced back at me, his eagle face unreadable. \"It's so beautiful,\" I shouted to him over the wind. His only response was a sudden swoop downward that made my stomach fly into my mouth. I clutched his neck so tightly I probably choked him. He spread his wings out again and leveled out, screeching when he saw my expression. I glared at him, suspicious that he was laughing. Troy flew by beneath us faster than I would have thought possible. I couldn't recognize any of the people from this height, but I was pretty sure a couple of them were pointing up at the eagle. I waved at them, giggling like a madman. Then the city was gone, vanishing behind us like it had never existed. We passed over other cities and towns and great fleets of ships. I wondered if Aristomache was on any of them. I felt sorry for her. Once she reached Troy there would be no prince for her to marry. The last of the sunlight bled out of the sky. I thought Zeus would have to stop for the night, but the eagle kept on. Soon it was too dark to see anything below me, but the stars were out. Snuggling down into Zeus' warm feathers, I watched his wing flap up and down, making the stars vanish and reappear with every stroke. I woke up in a bed that was not my own. I blinked a couple times, trying to figure out where I was. I remembered the eagle and the stars, but everything after that was nothing but shadows and incomplete thoughts. The room I was in was splendid. It was bright and airy, with gauze curtains strung between the pillars. I heard birds and the sound of rushing water. Something brushed down my arm, making me jump. I twisted around to see Zeus lying behind me, an arm pillowed under his head. \"'Morning, beautiful,\" he said. Smiling at him, I pushed myself up and looked around the room. The bed sat on a raised platform, looking out over everything. There were no walls, just pale marble pillars on all sides with gossamer sheets hanging between them. The floor was light-colored wood with colorful rugs scattered across it. The place was filled with priceless objects, ornate couches and beautiful carved tables. A harp sat in one corner and a table full of scrolls in another. I stepped out of the bed, glancing down at myself in surprise. I was only wearing my perizoma, the white undergarment still wrapped securely around my middle. I glanced over my shoulder as Zeus. \"Where are my clothes?\" He nodded toward the corner of the room. \"I put them over there. Figured you wouldnt want to sleep in them.\" I raised an eyebrow at him. \"Don't worry, I just undressed you.\" He smirked. \"I want you awake when I start doing other things. And I left this on,\" He reached over and caught the bottom edge of my perizoma, rubbing it between his fingers before I scooted away. He sighed dramatically. I laughed and moved away, walking across the room. I'd never seen anything so lavish. The furniture was all ivory and gold, the carpets crimson and woven into fantastic patterns. The ceiling was painted to look like a landscape as seen from a great height, just like I'd witnessed last night from the eagle's back. The sound of rushing water permeated the room as a waterfall cascaded off one side of the roof, creating a translucent wall--the only wall in the room. I could feel Zeus' eyes on me as I walked around, but I didn't look at him. I felt shy. Zeus had always been a little other-worldly, even in his Olympia disguise, but after riding through the sky on the back of an eagle and waking up on the mountain of the gods, I felt more than a little trepidation. I didn't know how to behave around somebody like him. \"Ganymede,\" he called from behind me. \"Come here.\" I had to obey, though I still couldn't look directly at him. He patted the coverlet beside him. I climbed up into the bed. \"You have a beautiful home, sir.\" I said, fixing my eyes on the coverlet. \"What's wrong?\" he asked. He caught my chin in his hand and made me look up at him. \"Are you unhappy?\" \"No!\" I blushed, hating myself for making him think I was ungrateful. \"No, it's not that at all, it's just... it's just a lot to take in. Really.\" He looked unconvinced. His hand moved from my chin to cup the side of my face, his fingers winding into my hair. \"I want you to be happy here,\" he said. I smiled a little. \"I am. Thank you, for what you did. Your Grace.\" He noticed how I tacked on the title. \"You've never called me that before.\" I blushed again. \"I should have. I haven't been very respectful to you. I'm sorry.\" He leaned toward me, unleashing the full force of his eyes. \"I didn't bring you here to be respectful.\" He kissed me, his hand curling around the back of my head, his tongue skimming along my lips. I parted them for him, moaning as his tongue stole into my mouth, entwining with my own. My arms wrapped around his neck and I rose up on my knees, pressing myself against his bare chest, embarrassment forgotten. He kissed me hungrily, his free hand finding my hip and tugging me closer. At last he drew back, both of us gasping for air. He studied me, his pupils dilated. He turned me, laying me back on the bed. I obeyed, the look in his eyes leaving me breathless. There was no doubt in my mind; I would not be leaving this room a virgin. The idea excited me and made me a little nervous. He hovered over me, pushing his hair behind his ear so he could see me better. His hand came up and touched my face before slowly trailing down my throat and over my chest, pausing at my nipple. He looked down at it, and brushed his thumb across it. I gasped, surprised at how sensitive it was. \"You were in love with another man,\" he murmured, not meeting my gaze. \"That's what you said.\" I blinked at him, surprised by the sudden turn of the conversation. \"Tell me,\" he said, grazing his thumb across the nipple again. \"How old was this man?\" He caught the sensitive skin between his fingers and rubbed his thumb in a circle. \"He, he was a year younger than me,\" I stammered, biting my lip as he continued toying with me. Zeus made a sound in the back of his throat. \"A boy, then. And you said he didn't love you back. Did he ever touch you?\" I felt a stab of pain when he talked about Isandros, but it vanished when Zeus leaned down and put his mouth where his hand had been. I whimpered, feeling his tongue flick over the nipple. I'd never even imagined anything like this. \"No,\" I answered. \"We never did anything like that.\" I moaned, arching my back, trying to give him more of me. He released me, rubbing his hand over my chest to wipe away the moisture. \"So you've never been touched?\" he asked, his nose drifting across the center of my chest before he latched onto my other nipple. \"N-no.\" I breathed, closing my eyes. \"You're the only one who's ever, ah, done anything like this.\" He groaned against my skin, grazing the sensitive nub with his teeth. He let me go, climbing up my body until we were eye to eye. His eyes were possessive as they looked down at me. My heart began to hammer. He leaned down suddenly, his mouth next to my ear. \"I'm glad for that,\" he whispered, his voice soft and seductive. \"I want to be the first one to fuck you, my little Trojan prince.\" I shuddered, and my breathing sped. \"Will it hurt?\" I asked, only half caring if it did. I'd been fantasizing about sex forever. To imagine that I was about to experience it was so surreal that I almost couldn't be afraid. Zeus turned back to me and smiled a little. \"Not too much, I don't think. Not when you're with me.\" I wasn't sure I believed him, but before I could reply he kissed me again, his lips barely brushing against mine. \"I'll be careful with you,\" he promised. I kissed him back, the kiss gradually increasing until our breathing became ragged, our mouths trying to possess each other. At last he broke away, burying his face in my neck, teasing the sensitive skin there. I sighed and tilted my head to allow him more access. He began sucking harder for a few seconds before abruptly pulling back, making a little pop sound as the suction broke. He smirked and touched my neck with his finger, like he had found something. Catching my look, he winked and leaned closer, pressing his lips to my ear again. \"Mine,\" he whispered, sending another chill up my spine. His body pushed mine into the mattress as he continued his journey down my body, touching and kissing me. Sometimes he'd pause at a certain area and examine it, just like he had the day before with my hand. Those moments frustrated me. I was more aroused than I'd ever been, my cock aching to release, and he chose now of all times to dawdle. \"What are you waiting for?\" I challenged him the third time this happened. He was lying on my legs, pinning them down with his stomach, his own legs lazily kicking back and forth in the air behind him, like a daydreaming child. He'd laid his head on my lower stomach and was watching his thumb as it stroked back and forth over my hip bone. His breathing ruffled the edge of my perizoma, making me desperate. He glanced up at me in surprise. \"What?\" I huffed, my arousal making me impolite. \"You said you were going to fuck me! Did you change your mind?\" A slow, evil grin spread across his features, his eyes turning to blue coals in his head. \"Does this bother you?\" he asked, slowly drumming his fingers on my hip. I groaned. \"Please,\" I whined, tossing my arms across my face. \"Please, I want you.\" He was there before the last word was out of my mouth, his hand pushing my arms out of the way, his eyes scorching me. I shrank away from his expression. \"I wouldn't do that, if I were you,\" he remarked, his voice flat. \"I wouldn't beg me for it. That might drive me over the edge, and then you'll be dreaming for this,\" he brushed the back of his hand down my ribcage, moving excruciatingly slow. His eyes never left mine. They left me addled. He smiled at me, showing just the edge of his teeth, reminding me of a knife blade. \"I know what I said earlier, about fucking you. I was lying. You don't want to be fucked today, my little prince.\" He kissed me softly. \"Someday you will. Someday you'll beg me for it, and I'll take you so hard that you won't be able to walk afterwards. But not today.\" He kissed me again. \"No more begging,\" he whispered against my lips. \"Today we go slow.\" \"Yes, sir,\" I murmured, my heart slamming into my ribs. He smiled, his good humor rushing back. \"You can call me by my name.\" \"Yes, sir.\" He laughed and went back to his anatomical study, stroking the tender skin on the inside of my hip like nothing had happened. I closed my eyes and tried to enjoy it, biting my lip to keep in my impatience. At last I felt his hand move dip into my perizoma. \"Oh, \" I breathed, adrenaline coursing through my veins. My cock was making an obvious tent in the white fabric and I blushed, a little embarrassed. I'd never felt comfortable being naked around other people, and I'd never been naked around a lover. I squirmed and twisted a strand of hair around my finger self-consciously. Zeus tugged the fabric back, exposing me. He helped me out of the undergarment before tossing in the corner with the rest of my clothes. His eyes wandered down my body, completely bare beneath him before he caught my eye. He smiled at me. \"You are the loveliest thing I've ever seen.\" I smiled back at him, relieved. He laid beside me, kissing me again, his hand wrapping around my manhood. My eyes rolled back in my head a little. He stroked me, his hand gripping me firmly and his thumb running over the tip with every pass. Moaning, I bucked into his hand, all traces of embarrassment forgotten. This seemed to excite him, and his pace quickened. \"Ganymede,\" he rasped, kissing my neck again. My hand skimmed down his torso and touched him through his own undergarment, making his groan. Emboldened, I stuck my hand inside and wrapped it around his cock, stroking the smooth skin. He swore and pushed down his perizoma, giving me better access. I turned my head and kissed him, the hand not stroking him winding in his hair. We were both on our sides, sharing hot, passionate kisses as we jerked each other off. The tips of our penises would occasionally brush against each other, and every time that happened I went hot all over. I tried positioning myself so that it would happen as often as possible. All too soon I felt my climax approaching, the experience of being touched like that too intense. \"Oh, you're, you're going to make me cum,\" I moaned, my head falling back as I felt it rising. Zeus immediately dropped his hand and all my hopes and dreams fell with it. I stared at him wildly, feeling utterly betrayed. He chuckled at my outraged expression and took my face in his hands, leaning our foreheads together. \"Not yet,\" he said, kissing the tip of my nose before pulling back. \"We've got so much more to do.\" I pouted, and had to stop myself from pleading with him again. My hand was still around his cock, though I'd stopped pumping when I'd been about to climax. A sudden, bold thought entered my mind and I acted on it before my courage failed me. I wriggled lower on the bed and slid his cock into my mouth, swirling my tongue around it experimentally. Zeus made a sound in the back of his throat that nearly undid me. I felt his hands in my hair, gently coaxing me to take more of him into my mouth. I did, bobbing my head up and down his heavy cock. I really didn't know what I was doing, but Zeus seemed to be enjoying himself. He whispered my name, his chest heaving and eyes slipping closed. Seeing him so aroused made me feel powerful. It was so obvious that he wanted me. Finally he pushed me away from him, a spiderweb of pre-cum and spit trailing from my lips, connecting me to him. I wiped my mouth with the back of my hand, glancing up at him in surprise. \"Did I do something wrong?\" He shook his head, his eyes wide and unfocused. \"I think we've had enough foreplay. I want to be inside you now.\" I nodded, excitement and nerves warring with each other. I rose up on my hands and knees beside him, waiting expectantly. Zeus propped himself up on his elbow and looked over at me. He reached over and touched my backside, trailing his fingers downward. I glanced over at him, wondering why he hesitated. \"Zeus?\" \"Lay on your back. I want to see your pretty face.\" I did as I was told, curious. Zeus grabbed several pillows and stacked them under my back and hips, raising up my bottom half. \"Comfortable?\" he asked. I nodded. \"Good.\" He slid off the bed and grabbed something off the table. It was a glass vial full of amber liquid. My heart skipped a beat when I saw it. \"Oil?\" I asked, trying to keep my voice steady. \"With a special ingredient,\" he replied, climbing back into the bed. \"Hopefully it'll make it hurt less.\" I chewed my lip, my stomach twisting in knots. He noticed my expression and leaned forward between my legs to kiss me. 'I'll be careful with you.\" he reassured me. \"I promise.\" I nodded my head, too nervous to say anything. Zeus unstoppered the vial and poured a little of the oil into his hand. \"Just try to relax, Ganymede.\" I took a deep breath and closed my eyes, trying to calm myself down. I wanted this. I felt his hands settle between my thighs, parting me. Something warm brushed over my entrance, sending a jolt of pleasure through me. His finger swirled around my anus, warm and slick with the oil. I opened my eyes a little. Zeus was kneeling between my legs, his hand hidden from view. He seemed completely absorbed in his task, his eyes watching his fingers. I melted under those fingers, my muscles turning to jelly. \"That feels nice,\" I said. \"Good. I'm going to do a little more now.\" The finger poked at my entrance, struggling against the resistance there. It slid up inside me, filling me up. I sighed. \"Does that hurt?\" I shook my head. It was a strange sensation, but not a bad one. I felt a little more pressure and then another finger moved to join the first, stretching me. This felt a little more invasive, but nothing like the pain I'd been expecting. The fingers slid in and out of me, very slowly at first and then a little faster, feeling me relax around them. Zeus trickled a little more oil over them as he went, getting me all slick inside. After a minute or so, I felt him add a third finger. The pressure built, but not the pain. After the initial shock, I was starting to enjoy being so full. \"How are you doing?\" he asked me. He was watching me now, scrutinizing my expression. I smiled, trying to reassure him. \"I want you,\" I answered. It was so true. Zeus' fingers felt good, but they only teased me. I wanted more. Zeus was quick to comply. He took his fingers out and slickened his manhood with the oil before moving to settle over me. He guided his cock into my entrance, going painfully slow. He was bigger around than his fingers had been, and he went gently, allowing me a chance to adjust. I felt him glide into me, and it was almost more than I could stand. I whimpered his name, tossing my head back. This was like a dream. The sexiest dream I'd ever had. \"Ganymede?\" \"You feel so good,\" I moaned. I heard him chuckle. \"So do you,\" he breathed, sounding short of breath. \"You are the most fuckable thing alive.\" He pushed deeper into me, and kept going until he was completely sheathed. I laid there, gasping, my body spasming around the invasion of his. It hadn't hurt at all, but the pressure was driving me to distraction. Zeus began rolling his hips, slowly thrusting inside of me. I watched him, admiring the fine lines of his body as he moved in and out of me, my mind delirious with lust. His locked his eyes with mine and he started thrusting a little faster, making me moan. \"You like that?\" I could only nod, lost in sensation. He had to pause every once in a while to trickle more oil along his cock, and those moments were the most desperate of my life, followed by the sweetest when he'd sheath himself in me once again. We continued like that for several minutes, his movements gradually increasing in speed and me lying prone beneath him, feeling all the happiness in the world. \"You look like you're enjoying yourself,\" he observed. I smiled up at him. \"This is the best day of my life.\" He grinned, \"It's about to get better.\" Before I could ask him what he meant, he adjusted the angle of his strokes, leaning a little back on his knees so that his downstroke would brush against something inside me that softened my bones. I yelped in surprise, my back arching off the bed and my cock going rigid. Zeus found that place again and again, each time sending a bolt of pleasure through me that was almost beyond all comprehension. My moans grew louder, becoming almost frantic as he rubbed up against that hidden spot with every stroke. \"You sound like a whore,\" he growled. The words were an insult but the tone was not. \"Do you like it?\" I asked, gazing up at him under my eyelashes. I angled myself upwards, allowing him deeper access. He groaned. \"Very much.\" His skin was shiny with sweat, his eyes bright. He reached up and caught my cock in his hand, fondling the tip. \"Ah,\" I said, tilting my head back, my mind going blank, just letting my body feel. I felt his thick cock prodding against my center, releasing wave after wave of indescribable pleasure. I'd never felt anything like it, not even with his hand around me. The tempo of his thrusts increased again, almost getting rough. It still didn't hurt, but I felt the force of it. The knowledge that he was enjoying taking his pleasure of me added fuel to my own ecstacy. The wave of pleasure building inside me grew higher, threatening to crash over me at any moment. I yearned for it, my breathing ragged and my voice growing hoarse from all racket I was making. He was right, I did sound like a whore. And I didn't care one bit. \"Ah, fuck, you feel so good,\" Zeus growled, grabbing my hips to steady himself as his thrusts became erratic. Oddly enough, it was his cursing that sent me over the edge, the husky sound of his voice adding that last tiny bit of stimulation I needed to come flying apart. \"Ah! Ahhaha, yes! Oh Zeus!\" I jerked under him, my hips straining upwards as creamy, white ejaculate splattered across my stomach, wave after crashing wave of pleasure washing over my entire body. This wasn't an orgasm. This was dying and going to Elysium. Seeing me finish sped Zeus' own climax and within moments he was pulling out of me and spilling himself across my stomach, his seed mixing with my own. He groaned, his hand squeezing out the last of it before he collapsed next to me, panting. We both lay there, arms stretched out and breathing fast, too spent to move. My ears were ringing and the sea of cum all over me was turning cold. \"Well,\" I said at last. \"That was amazing.\" \"Yes, it was.\" Zeus was lying on his stomach, his arms raised above his head. He opened his eye to look at me over the top of his arm. \"You look good covered in cum,\" he said. I blushed furiously. \"I need a rag or something.\" He glanced around, picked up his perizoma, and handed it to me. I eyed the garment warily, the notion of cleaning off with someone else's used underclothes not very comforting. Zeus smirked when he noticed my reaction. \"You know, if you're that concerned about my personal cleanliness, you really shouldn't have let me stick my dick up your ass.\" It was hard to argue with that logic. I took the garment and started wiping off globs of semen. Zeus watched me as I did this. \"How are you feeling?\" he asked. \"Fantastic,\" I answered. \"Did it hurt much?\" I shook my head. \"No, not at all. It was strange, I'd expected it to hurt a lot.\" \"It usually does. I put some nectar in the oil, to see if it would help you any. I didn't know if it would work or not, but it helps with other kinds of pain so I figured it'd be worth a shot. You might feel sore later on, once the effects wear off.\" I glanced up at him and smiled. \"That was very kind of you.\" He shrugged off my gratitude. \"I want you to be happy here. I went a little faster than I planned to, at the end. I hope I didn't make you uncomfortable.\" I assured him that he hadn't. \"I've never felt so good in my life,\" I said, propping myself up on my elbow to look at him. I raised a hand to brush back some of his hair that had fallen forward. \"That was incredible.\" He caught my hand and kissed my palm. \"You said you'd never been with anyone, but I almost wonder, have you ever actually peaked before?\" \"Yes,\" I said, curious as to where the question arose from. \"I mean, I've touched myself plenty of times.\" He grinned. \"I'm going to have to see that someday,\" he murmured. \"But the reason I asked is because of your reaction when I made you come just now. You looked starstruck, like it was the first time you ever had an orgasm.\" \"Well,\" I muttered. \"I've never experienced something like that before. I've never even come close to anything like that.\" \"Interesting.\" He turned over, winding his arms behind his head. I wiggled nearer to him, wanting to be pressed up against him, but not sure if he'd appreciate me invading his space. Luckily, he noticed what I was doing and pulled me close, his arm wrapping around my back. I sighed and snuggled into the crook of his arm, my head on his chest. His chest was dusted with fair hair, tapering into a line that trailed down his stomach and eventually fanned out again, making a nest of light colored curls between his legs. Like his chest, Zeus' arms and legs were also hairier than my own, making him look very manly. I liked it. His heart was beating under my ear. Hearing it surprised me, though it shouldn't have. It made sense that Zeus would have a heartbeat--he was alive wasn't he?--but it seemed almost odd that a god could have something so ordinary. My eyes grew heavy and I was beginning to nod off when he spoke again. \"We're going to have to be careful, my little prince.\" I stirred against him, trying to shake off my stupor. \"What?\" Zeus glanced over at me, his pale eyes conflicted. \"I'm going to make you my cupbearer. That will be your official role here. It'll be our excuse.\" I raised an eyebrow, not following him. \"What do you mean, our excuse?\" Zeus sighed. \"You mentioned it yourself yesterday evening. I'm married. And Hera isn't the most understanding person.\" I bit my lip, feeling stupid. I had known he was married, but in the whirlwind of emotion that this man stirred up in me, I'd barely even thought about it. \"What will she do?\" I whispered. He clenched me tighter, leaning his forehead against mine. \"Oh, sweetling, you don't need to be frightened. I'm not going to let her hurt you. We just need to be careful.\" \"But how? Do you really think she won't suspect us of this?\" I gestured at the two of us. \"She probably already knows I'm in here.\" Zeus chuckled, his tone humorless. \"Oh, trust me, if she knew you were in here, we'd both be in a world of pain.\" He pulled my face back to his when I tried to turn away. \"Ganymede, I'm not going to let her hurt you. I promise.\" I bit my lip harder, wanting to believe him, but not sure I could. I'd heard stories about what Hera did to her husband's lovers. I'd been beyond stupid to come here. Then I looked into those pale blue eyes and felt the rest of the world fall away, just like always. I could never have said no to those eyes, nor the god they belonged to. With a sinking feeling, I realized I'd been lost the moment I'd seen him standing in the forest after he'd struck down the serpent. The memory of the serpent brought something to my mind and I groaned. \"Ganymede?\" \"The giant snake you killed. Your wife sent it after us, didn't she?\" Now it was Zeus' turn to look away. I sighed, resigning myself. \"I'll be your cupbearer, then, if that's what you think is best.\" \"She's got no reason to hurt my cupbearer, now does she? And for all she knows, that's all I ever wanted you for.\" His tone was a little desperate, his story thin as a spider's web. But it was still more than I could come up with. \"And there's one more thing, something to protect you.\" Zeus disentangled himself from me and slid out of the bed. I watched as he walked across the room and picked up a little dish off a table. There was something on the dish that resembled a small cake, small enough to fit in the palm of my hand and the color of honey. \"What is it?\" I asked. \"Ambrosia. If you eat it, you'll be immortal. Never aging, never dying.\" I stared at him, completely dumbfounded. \"You aren't serious?\" He nodded. \"I told you, I want you to be with me.\" He pushed the tray toward me. \"Eat it.\" I looked down at the tiny cake, my mind numb. I felt like I should take some time to decide. But why? When somebody offered you immortality, who would be stupid enough to refuse? Yet I hesitated. This was the most monumental moment of my entire life, and I'd had no time to prepare. I glanced up at Zeus, looking at his lovely face. He was watching me expectantly, his hair disheveled from our romp, his eyes stunningly blue and endless. I imagined leaving him and returning to my father's house, and cringed away from the thought. How could I ever go back to the way things had been? It was impossible. Therefore, I would be staying here. And if I was staying here with Zeus, shouldn't I actually be able to stay? If I remained mortal, death would eventually take me away from here, if I wasn't cast out for being old and ugly beforehand. No, the answer was simple and I was just delaying the inevitable. I picked up the little golden cake and popped the entire thing into my mouth. It was delicious. The taste was unlike anything I could ever imagine. It was sweet, it was rich and it seemed to carry with it every beautiful feeling in the world. The cake made me happy with a joy that made every particle of my body glow from within. I laughed, the joy bubbling up out of me like a fountain. Zeus smiled and bent forward to kiss me, his hands winding in my hair. I kissed him back, all of my energy returning ten fold. I was so happy I wanted to yell from the rooftops and dance through the streets and make love to him again and again. The world was bright and beautiful and I was beautiful too. I wrestled the king of the gods back down into the sheets, kissing his throat and grinding against him, ready for another round. He laughed and let me caress him, his eyes never leaving me. \"Congratulations,\" he said after a while, gasping when my mouth slipped around his awakening arousal. \"Welcome to immortality, my prince.\" We fell into the bed, Zeus never allowing me more than an arm's reach away from him. I started out underneath him, one hand in his hair, the other gripping the small of his back, my own need rising to meet his. He wiggled out of my grasp and moved lower, unfastening my jeans. As soon as enough fabric was out of his way, my cock was in his mouth, his hand pumping the stem while his mouth sucked at the top, his tongue twirling around the slit. I whimpered, pressing the heels of my hands against my eyes. He kept at it for another couple minutes, pausing only when I was good and hard. I pushed myself into a sitting position, kicking off my jeans and boxers. He helped me out of my shirt. I fell back into pillows and spread my legs for him, knowing that he doesn't care for much foreplay when he's in this kind of mood. He paused, looking at me from the end of the bed with a strange expression. I tilted my head to the side, evaluating him. Seeing my look, he glanced away, his mouth twisting. I pushed myself upright again and crawled toward him on my hands and knees, turning his face back to me. \"Are you all right?\" I asked. He smiled a little, but it didn't touch his eyes. That same vulnerable look was in them again, like he was pleading with me but couldn't find the right words to say. At last he just shook his head and said that he was fine. I wasn't convinced. Cupping his face in my hand, I leaned forward and kissed him softly, carefully. I felt him kiss me back, his arms encircling my waist, his hands skimming over my back. I kept the pace slow, deliciously slow, our breathing turning ragged. My fingers stroked his hair, touched his face, brushed over his bare shoulders. He was just wearing a pair of loose pajama bottoms that I couldn't wait to get off him. I breathed his name against his lips, trying to persuade him to open up. \"I--\" he said, when I moved lower to kiss his throat. \"Could we--I mean, could you...\" He huffed in frustration. \"Forget it.\" I looked back at him, taking in his torn expression before kissing him again. \"Could I what?\" I asked, catching his bottom lip between my teeth. He sighed. \"Ganymede, I...I want you today,\" he brushed some invisible dirt off my collarbone, not looking me directly in the eye. \"You know, like we did that time in Paris?\" I raised an eyebrow but quickly rearranged my expression, not wanting to make him more embarrassed than he already was. \"Of course,\" I said, bringing his face up so that he was looking at me again. \"You know that we can do that whenever you want.\" \"I know,\" he said and I was sure I saw him blush. I smiled and kissed him, my tongue stealing into his mouth and touching his own, making him sigh and lean further into the kiss. I turned him so that we could both lay out on the bed. \"How do you want to do it?\" I asked. He smirked, his eyes starting to regain some of their fire. \"You're the one in charge, remember?\" I laughed. \"That's not really how it works, but alright. Turn on your side, facing the window.\" He obeyed, watching me out of the corner of his eye. I curled up behind him, reaching around his waist and touching him, running my hands down his chest, over his flat belly and finally catching the edge of his waistband with my finger. I pushed it down and helped pull off his pants. Zeus kicked them onto the floor. Going back behind him, I reached out and slowly ran my hand down over his cock, feeling it jump against my hand. I went further down, cupping his balls and running my thumb over them, before going even further, pausing at his perineum and rubbing my fingers in a slow circle. He groaned when I picked up the pace. Using my other hand, I began massaging his cock, loving the sounds he made as my fingers worked him. Soon his breathing became labored and I pulled my hands away, not wanting him to get too worked up. He made a disgruntled noise when I stopped, but I just tsked him. \"I'm in charge, remember?\" I teased, reaching behind me. \"Whatever.\" I laughed. I found what I was looking for, the bottle of lube hidden between the mattress and the wall. I shook the bottle and poured a little into my hand. \"Do you want to use some nectar?\" I asked. He shook his head, not looking at me. I winced. We didn't do this very often and every time--even the first--Zeus had refused to use the nectar, choosing instead to feel the discomfort of anal sex. I'd often wondered why. Zeus said he didn't mind the pain, that it felt good. I didn't understand it. Pain and I weren't friends and we definitely weren't lovers. I'd used nectar every time he'd gone into me, but that was me. Zeus could like whatever he wanted. I'd been Zeus' lover for three hundred years before I'd first gone into him. In those days it was still considered indecent for an influential man to be penetrated. Men like Zeus were supposed to be powerful, the dominators, the conquerors. I'd never thought much of the rule, but it had taken centuries for Zeus to give it up. It was still in the back of his mind to this day, which is one of the reasons why we had only done this a few times since we'd been together, and most of those had been in the last couple of centuries. There had been an especially spectacular evening in Paris about fifty years ago that he always referred to whenever he wanted to try it again. I spread the lube over my fingers and dipped them down against his entrance. He let out a sound that sent a shiver of anticipation down my spine. I slipped a finger into him, feeling the soft walls clenching around me. I wiggled my finger and he moaned. \"Does that feel okay?\" I asked, kissing his side. \"Yeah,\" he gasped. \"Yeah it does.\" \"Good,\" I slid another finger in and then another, slowly pumping them in and out of him. \"You feel really tight,\" I said, grinning up at him. He laughed a little, making his muscles quiver around my fingers. \"You sound like a teenager the first time he sticks a finger up his virgin girlfriend.\" \"Well, I wouldn't know much about that.\" \"You would if you read more smut.\" I rolled my eyes and leaned close to him. From this position my head came about halfway down Zeus' spine, my hand reaching lower, getting him ready for me. I left little airy kisses all up and down his side, from his rib cage to his hip bone. He was ticklish around his belly which usually amused me to no end but I didn't want him to twist around too much in our current position so I avoided those spots. My fingers kept pumping in and out of him, spreading the lube around and getting him nice and relaxed. I saw him wrap his hand around himself, slowly moving it in time with my fingers. I watched him through half closed eyes, feeling my own erection jerk to life. I tried to be patient with my preparations but watching him touch himself was not helping my resolve. \"Gan,\" he breathed, looking back at me, his eyes grown cloudy with desire. I didn't need to be told twice. I grabbed the lube and spread some over my cock before positioning myself behind him. I had to use my hand to guide myself into him. Zeus never had to do that anymore, but I didn't have nearly as much experience with this. I pressed myself against him, marveling at just how small the entrance was. The first time we did this, it had taken me forever to even get inside him. Small wonder we hadn't done it again for another couple centuries. Now I wiggled the tip a little, just barely putting it inside. Zeus gasped quietly. I pushed forward with my hips, easing my way into him at a snail's pace. Once, he made a tiny pained sound and I saw him grab a fistful of the sheets. I immediately pulled back. \"Babe, we can use some of the nectar.\" He shook his head, letting out his breath through his nose. \"I'm fine. Just give me a second, please.\" I did, wrapping my arm around his waist and kissing along the back of his shoulders. I felt terrible for causing him pain and even worse for my own impatience. I was so aroused. It was all I could do not to shove the rest of my cock up into him and feel his walls squeezing around me. Zeus finally gave the go-ahead and I slid a little farther into him, my eyes rolling back from the sensation. At last I was completely inside. Zeus moaned and leaned his head back, feeling me fill him up. My initial thrusts started out excruciatingly slow and gradually became a little faster, my breathing uneven. He was tight around me, tighter than anything I'd ever felt, all heat and friction and slick lube. \"You feel so good,\" I huffed, doing my best to keep my control. Zeus was breathing heavily, his eyes closed and lips parted. I tried to adjust the angle of my thrusts, attempting to hit his prostate, the bundle of nerves that had the power to make a man come unglued. After a few more thrusts I got it. I felt a shudder ripple through him and he let out a little whine. \"Oh my God,\" he said, moaning when I hit the spot again. His response made me go a little wild and I thrust into him again and again, loving the sound of his voice. My arms were wrapped tightly around his waist, my forehead against the back of his shoulder. \"Oh, God that feels so good,\" he gasped. \"Hell yeah it does,\" I said through gritted teeth, \"I want you to cum for me.\" I slid my hand up and started playing with his nipple, my erection brushing up against his g-spot again. My own orgasm was slowly building and I wanted to make sure that he found his release before I did. Zeus shivered, his erection curled up over his stomach. I leaned up on my elbow so I could see his face better. He looked up at me, his beautiful eyes delirious. He brought my face down so we could kiss, both of us moaning with every thrust. \"I love you,\" he whispered against my lips, squeezing his eyes shut when I thrust into him again. \"Oh, don't stop,\" he said. \"Whatever you do, don't stop.\" \"I love you, too\" I said, shoving myself into him, \"Oh, Baby I love you so much.\" I bent and started attacking his neck, sucking on the skin under his jaw. He gasped and leaned up into it. It wasn't much longer before his moans became louder, and he began moving into my thrusts. \"Gan, Baby, I'm gonna, I'm gonna...\" He cried out, his body shuddering as he came. I felt his walls grip me even harder, making me groan. My pace quickened, his ecstasy fueling my own desire. Zeus gasped for air, his skin dewy with sweat. He went limp in my arms. \"You are so beautiful,\" I whispered against his skin. I breathed in the scent of him, a heady mix of sweat and sex and rain. \"I want you to finish inside me,\" he said. \"Oh,\" I breathed. My hips bucked against him, my climax surging up within me. \"Oh, here it comes,\" I said, gripping him as pleasure exploded through me. We both moaned as I came, my semen spilling inside him. I spasmed for several seconds before collapsing against him, both of us breathing heavily. I eased my way out.He rolled over to look at me. \"That was nice,\" he murmured. \"Yeah it was,\" I agreed, grinning at him. \"Don't get too comfortable though. If you're thinking about becoming the bottom of this relationship you're going to have to fight me for it.\" He smirked. \"I don't think you have to worry about that.\" He reached over and caught a strand of my hair and twirled it around his fingers. \"Sometimes it's just nice to let someone else be in control,\" he said. I pushed myself up on my elbows. \"Do you wanna talk about it now?\" He sighed, dropping his hand. \"Not much to talk about really.\" \"Hera?\" He made a face. \"It was just the usual stuff, how I'm a terrible husband and a terrible father and a terrible person. It just gets old after awhile.\" I sat up and picked up his hand, kissing it. \"I don't think you're a terrible person.\" \"Then you're an idiot.\" I glanced at him, surprised. He grimaced and apologized. \"But you can't honestly say that I'm a good person. Or father or husband.\" \"I can say whatever I want,\" I declared. \"But I do know that you're a much better father than you used to be. And you were always kind to me. A truly awful person wouldn't be nice to anybody.\" He laughed a little. \"What did I do to deserve you?\" he asked. \"You let a snake burn up your clothes,\" I said with a smirk. \"I think you did it on purpose too. There was no way I was going to let you get away from me once I saw this body.\" I ran my hand down his stomach, making him twist away. I raised an eyebrow. \"Don't,\" he warned, narrowing his eyes. I grinned and attacked him, tickling his sides until he howled, thrashing in the bed. \"Dammit, Ganymede! Get off!\" I let him go, still laughing, pushing the hair back out of my eyes. \"You know, I was thinking about that earlier, about how I met you, I mean.\" \"Yeah? And how sexy I was?\" I rolled my eyes. \"If you do say so yourself.\" I laid back down, my arms stretched out. He leaned back against me, his head on my shoulder. I smiled, pleased by his reaction. I kissed his hair and tugged him closer to me. \"Actually, I was thinking more along the lines of how different we both are around each other now.\" He snorted. \"You had the self-esteem of a kicked puppy.\" \"I was pretty pitiful, wasn't I?\" Zeus propped himself up to look at me. \"No. You were perfect. It just took you forever to realize it.\" He brushed his thumb over my cheek. \"I like the new you. The one who knows you're amazing.\" I smiled. \"I am pretty awesome.\" He laughed. I loved his laugh. It was deep and loud and contagious. \"You are. And you're dead sexy.\" I was about to answer when a voice called from the doorway: \"So this is where you've been hiding.\" I fidgeted with the edge of my himation, slowly shifting my weight from foot to foot. The women stared at each other across the small table. The frosty morning air was thick with tension, making my hair stand on end and a shiver run down my spine. Finally, the woman on the right reached out and slid the round game-piece across the table, knocking her opponent's square token out the of the circle. Her opponent groaned. \"Why can't you ever let me win?\" Hera grumbled, leaning back in her chair. She tapped the rim of her cup and I hurried to refill it. Athena laughed. \"You'd be even angrier if I did.\" \"True. But can't you at least have an off game? Must you always be so perfect?\" \"Maybe we can play something else next time.\" \"No,\" replied Hera. \"I will continue this until I master it.\" \"As you wish.\" Athena glanced up at me. \"And how are you today, Ganymede?\" I squirmed. I hated being noticed by the deities, much preferring to stand in the corner until someone wanted more wine. \"I am well, my lady,\" I murmured. \"Speak up, Ganymede,\" Hera snapped. \"Nobody can hear you.\" \"Are you adjusting to life here, then?\" Athena asked, ignoring the other's outburst. \"I'm sure it's a lot to get used to.\" I smiled a little. I liked Athena. She was a witty, generous sort of person. \"It is, my lady, but I am happy to be here.\" \"He is doing quite well,\" Hera said, her voice echoing inside her cup as she lifted it to her lips. I couldn't help but look at her profile as she did so. Hera's face made me feel totally inadequate. Everyone was beautiful on Mount Olympus, from Zeus to the lowliest dryad. And Hera was lovelier than anybody. She was small and soft, with a delicate face and a perfect little nose and skin fair as fresh cream. Her dark hair was curled and braided into an elaborate up-do that made her seem taller than she was. Her eyes were large and dark and her voice was surprisingly low-pitched for such a tiny person, booming out of her with the force of a tidal wave. \"Well we are glad to have you,\" Athena said, standing to leave. \"Have a good day, Your Highness.\" Hera waved her away, not bothering to look at her. \"We'll resume this tomorrow.\" \"As you say.\" She left, leaving me alone with the Queen of Heaven. Hera reclined in her chair, slowly swirling the wine in her cup. Silence fell so thick that when one of her peacocks crowed I nearly leapt out of my skin. \"So,\" she said at last, still staring into her cup. \"You're his new toy.\" Nausea rolled over me. I wasn't sure how to answer, and paused so long that she seemed to think that I wasn't going to. \"No denying it?\" she wondered. \"No desperate denouncement of your trysts?\" \"I am my king's humble servant, Your Grace,\" I said. My voice was barely more than a whisper. \"I am honored that he chose to bring me here.\" Hera scoffed. She finally looked up at me and her dark eyes were sharpened by malice and pain. \"Do you really think I'm that stupid? That I believe he just brought you here--you, with your obscenely pretty face and pathetic spinelessness--to stand around pouring wine? Any half-wit can pour wine. He brought you here to squeal into a pillow.\" I opened my mouth, but no words came out. Every defense that I'd practiced for this moment had fled and all I could think of was what horrible thing she was going to do to me now. She saw that I wasn't going to reply and her lip curled. \"Still have nothing to say? How odd. Maybe you are a half-wit.\" I turned my eyes to the floor and said nothing. \"Tell me, Ganymede,\" she said my name like it was a filthy thing. \"Do you intend to steal him away from me? To seduce him into some plot that removes me from his side? Then you could have him all to yourself.\" I glanced up at her. I found my words again, but Hera barreled ahead, making it impossible for me to say them. \"But let me tell you,\" she snapped. \"I am not going anywhere. I am his wife and the only way he'll be rid of me is if he kills me the way he did Metis.\" She smiled then, her tiny rosebud mouth splitting back over her teeth. \"And I am no Metis. I am a goddess, daughter of Kronos the Crooked One, and I will see you strung from the stars by your slithering guts before I let you separate me from what's mine.\" I gazed at her in perfected understanding. \"You're right\" I told her. \"I don't belong here.\" Her eyes shifted. \"Your husband asked me if I wanted to leave Troy and come here to be with him. I agreed to it, mostly just to get away from home. I do like your husband, he's an interesting, passionate person. But I am fully aware that he will never really be mine--I'm not sure he can be anybody's. He's not somebody you can pin down with rules and rites. He's wild. But isn't that untamed, vibrant spirit the part of him that attracts you the most? It's true that the two of you are opposites; you're grounded and practical and unswervingly devoted, while Zeus is reckless and restless and driven by passion. But when you two are near each other it's like watching two halves of the same soul. Zeus isn't used to people contradicting him but for whatever reason I think he enjoys a good quarrel with you. It's a challenge for him. You sharpen his mind and burgeon his creativity. How could I or anybody else ever compete with that? \"So what I'm saying, Your Grace, is that I'm sticking around here as long as I can. I won't lie to you and say that I'm not attracted to Zeus. I am. But I also know that even if I tried to get him away from you it'd never work. So I'll take what I can get, appreciate his attentions as long as I have them, and count myself lucky that he ever noticed me at all. And, eventually, when he stops caring about me, I'll go away somewhere and think about how lucky you are that you'll always get to have a place in his heart.\" Hera stared at me for several long seconds. \"You're a fool,\" she said at last. I smiled a little. \"I suppose I am, Your Grace.\" \"So you're willing to be in a relationship where one of the participants is disloyal?\" she demanded. \"What about when he takes a new lover, hmm? How will that make you feel?\" I shrugged. In truth the idea of Zeus loving someone else made me die a little inside, but that feeling didn't change my outlook. \"Zeus is a god. Who am I to contradict what a god does?\" Hera scoffed. She rose to her feet, the folds of her spangled peplos falling around her like a purple waterfall. She squinted up at me like I was a wormy, half-rotten apple hanging from a pretty tree. \"If he hadn't made you immortal, I'd slit your throat and hold you over the side of my balcony. Then Zeus would know that he's not the only one who can make the rain fall.\" I just bowed my head. She brushed past me. \"Oh, and Ganymede?\" I turned toward her. She stood with her hand on the door. \"You can be quite eloquent, even if you do have foolish notions. You should try expressing yourself more often.\" I smiled. \"All I need is a pen and ink and I will express myself as often as you wish, Your Highness.\" I spun around to see Hera standing there, just inside the door, her face blank, watching us. Zeus pushed himself upright, smoothing his hair down. I pulled the sheet up around me, knowing that she'd already seen everything I was trying to hide. \"I see you're really mulling over your sins,\" she said. \"What do you want?\" he asked. \"I'm kind of busy right now.\" \"I was coming to see if you wanted to go out for breakfast with us, but I realize now that you have other activities planned for the day.\" She turned to go, her back rigid. \"Wait,\" I called. \"He'd love to go.\" \"What?\" asked Zeus. \"Really?\" Hera asked sarcastically, turning back to sneer at us. \"Yup, he'll be right out.\" I leaned over Zeus and picked up my boxers, shimmying into them under the sheets. Once I wasn't naked I climbed out of bed, strode over to the dresser, then pulled out the bottom drawer where I kept several pairs of Zeus' clothes. \"Where were you planning on going?\" I asked, sorting through the clothes. I hoped they hadn't been aiming fancy because I didn't have many formal things here. \"Chloe wants to go to Taylor's,\" Hera said. Chloe was their youngest daughter, only six years old and cute as a button. Taylor's was her favorite restaurant, a classic country diner where she always ordered chocolate chip pancakes. I could feel the tension behind me as husband and wife stared each other down. I pretended not to notice, pulling a blue flannel shirt and a pair of designer jeans from the drawer. \"Here,\" I said, tossing them to Zeus. He caught them automatically. \"I don't really feel like breakfast,\" he muttered. \"Yes, you do,\" I told him. I turned back to Hera. \"He'll be right down,\" I said, smiling pleasantly. She curled her lip and left, slamming the door behind her. Zeus glared at me. \"What are you doing? I don't want to go.\" I just looked at him. \"What?\" he demanded. \"She came here to find you,\" I said. \"She invited you to breakfast with her and the kids. She's apologizing.\" \"You call that an apology?\" \"I call that walking into a room and seeing your husband rolling around in the sheets with his concubine. She's be stupid not to be mad.\" I sighed. \"Go after her. Take your family out and show them a good time. She called you a bad father. Prove her wrong.\" He shook his head but started getting dressed. \"She called me a bad husband too. Do you want me to stop coming to see you so I can prove her wrong?\" I eyed him. \"You couldn't stay away.\" He grinned. He dressed quickly, coming to stand beside me afterwards. He took my hand, running his thumb over my knuckles. \"I kind of wanted to stay in bed with you all day,\" he murmured. \"That would have been a waste of time,\" I told him. He smiled, reaching up to cup the back of my head. \"Always so practical.\" \"One of us has to be.\" He kissed me. \"I love you,\" he whispered afterwards. \"You love her too,\" I replied cutting him off before he could protest. \"You do. You always have. That's why you care so much about what she thinks of you.\" He glanced away. \"It's alot easier to love you,\" he muttered. \"You've always liked a challenge.\" I smiled at him. \"Have a good day, sweetheart. Don't stay away too long.\" He kissed me once more before striding out the door, going to meet the other half of his life. I stood there a moment, noticing how empty the room felt without him in it. I shook my head and went to pick up my clothes. Zeus would be back soon enough. I hopped back up onto the bar stool, pondering what my next scene would be.",

      "I'd always known I was going to marry a girl, most likely one I'd never met.",
      "However, knowing and doing were two different things.",
      "\"Just think about it, won't you?",
      "It'd be for the good of the city.\"",
      "He patted my shoulder and turned back to his work table.",
      "\"How's the swordplay coming?\" he asked, unsubtly changing the subject.",
      "\"Isandros says I'm doing much better.\"",
      "\"Good.",
      "I'll have to come watch you today.\"",
      "I fidgeted with the edge of my tunic, unsure how I felt about that.",

      "I didn't want Father to see me lose.\"You don't have to.",

      "We were standing at the edge of the training yard, practice swords in our hands.",
      "\"I know.",

      "I gave Isandros a frantic look.",
      "\"Please, don't beat me too badly.\"",
      "He smiled at me.",
      "\"I never beat you very badly these days.",
      "Like I told you, you're getting a lot better at this Ganymede.\"",

      "It was one thing to lose in front of my father, but my brothers were a different matter entirely.",
      "Ilus was the eldest, serious and severe.",
      "He was a scholar and skilled tactician.",
      "Assaracus was the warrior in the family.",
      "I believed Isandros could beat him, but not many others could.",

      "I groaned under my breath.",
      "\"Don't think about them,\" Isandros whispered.",
      "\"Focus on me.\"",
      "I looked across at him, at his narrow face and high cheekbones and dark, dark eyes that watched me from beneath his straight brows.",
      "I let the rest of the world disappear until it was just me and him and our swords rising to meet each other.",
      "Clack, clack, clack.",
      "We whirled around each other, side stepping and feigning, coming together and splitting apart, our swords dancing.",
      "I kept my eyes on him, watching his every move.",
      "Finally, he managed to get through my defences and placed his sword against my throat.",
      "We both froze, breathing heavily.",
      "I dropped my sword to the ground.",
      "\"Good show,\" I heard Father call.",
      "Assaracus was laughing.",
      "Soon they were all standing next to us.",

      "\"Poor fool never had a chance,\" he said.",
      "I bristled, but Isandros came to my rescue.",
      "\"I wouldn't say that, sir.",
      "There were a few moments when he had me pretty scared.\"",
      "\"Then you must scare easily.",
      "Ganymede swings that thing like he's trying to swat flies with it.\"",
      "\"Assaracus,\" my father scolded.",
      "\"That's enough out of you.\"",
      "He turned to Isandros.",
      "\"Thank you, young man, for helping my son.",
      "I know it must take a lot of your time.\"",
      "Isandros bowed.",
      "\"It's nothing, Your Grace.",
      "I enjoy it.\"",
      "He grinned at me.",
      "\"Ganymede is my favorite student.\"",
      "I felt my cheeks grow warm under such praise and turned away before he noticed.",
      "When I turned my head, I caught my father looking at me in such a way that made my embarrassment turn to fear.",
      "His expression was neutral, but there was something in his eyes that made me want to crawl away from his scrutiny.",
      "\"Well, if you don't mind, I need to take your favorite student away from you tonight,\" he said.",
      "\"We've got a few things to discuss.\"",
      "\"Of course, Your Grace.\"",
      "Isandros bowed again before picking up my training sword and going back to the barracks.",
      "Father watched him go before turning to my brothers.",
      "\"You two, go on inside.\"",
      "Assaracus and Ilus glanced at each other but did as they were told.",
      "My heart thudded in my chest as I watched them leave and I wanted to race after them to get out from under my father's gaze.",
      "\"Ganymede,\" he said.",
      "I glanced up at him.",
      "\"Yes?\"",
      "\"Come with me.\"",
      "We walked across the yard, toward the city gates.",
      "I followed him up the stone steps to the top of the city wall.",
      "Troy's walls had been smaller then, not the colossal things that faced Odysseus and Agamemnon years later.",
      "Still, at the time they'd been the tallest structures I'd ever seen.",
      "Standing on them, I could see my entire world, the glittering city and the hill country and the sparkling blue sea the swept out before me in all of its mystery.",
      "The sun was setting over the sea now, making it look as if the water itself had caught fire.",
      "Father dismissed the guards standing watch and we looked at the sea together.",
      "\"You need to make some decisions, Ganymede,\" he told me, still watching the sea.",
      "I looked down at my hands resting on the battlements in front of me and said nothing.",
      "\"You are a prince of Troy, my son.",
      "And princes don't always get what they want.\"",
      "He finally looked over at me.",
      "\"Your brothers were in the same scrape you are now.",
      "Neither was overly thrilled to marry, but they did because they knew the importance of it.",
      "Aristomache is a good match for the people of Troy.",
      "I know you don't want to hear that, but you're seventeen years old.",
      "It's time to start facing the facts.\"",
      "I didn't reply.",
      "\"I know that you're the third son, and that you'll hopefully never have to bear the burden of my crown.",
      "But our house still needs to be built.",
      "Heirs need to be born so that our line will remain strong.",
      "And so that my sons' legacies will continue on.\"",
      "He turned away again, staring out at the sea.",
      "\"You legacy will not be furthered by Isandros son of Aktor.\"",
      "I felt my face go red and I prayed that the sunset would mask it.",
      "\"I don't know what you mean,\" I muttered.",
      "\"Oh, Ganymede.\"",
      "My father sighed.",
      "\"You don't have to hide from me.",
      "I've known about you for a long time.\"",
      "He reached over and grasped me by the shoulder.",
      "\"I'm not angry with you.",
      "I know that you can't help it.",
      "But you have to think about what's best for others, not just your own desires.",
      "You can't marry Isandros, nor any other man.",
      "You can't father children from such a scheme.",
      "I am asking you, for the good of our people and for the good of our family, to set aside your infatuations for now and to move forward with our agreement with Pentares of Corinth.\"",
      "I couldn't answer at first.",
      "A lump had formed in my throat and to my shame I was on the brink of tears.",
      "I considered what he was asking of me and felt like my heart was breaking in two.",
      "Put aside my \"infatuations\" as he called them?",
      "How?",
      "If I could so easily cast them aside I already would have.",
      "Did he think I wanted to feel like this?",
      "\"I don't know how to do that,\" I croaked.",
      "\"I can't make my feelings go away, Father.",
      "I've tried to do that...\" I shook my head, unable to finish.",
      "How many nights had I laid awake in my bed, wishing that I could be different than I was?",
      "That I had been born normal?",
      "\"Maybe,\" he murmured, squeezing my shoulder.",
      "\"Once you see this girl, it'll be easier for you to--\" I shook my head, cutting him off.",
      "\"It won't.",
      "Father, I--\" The words caught in my throat, but I forced them out.",
      "\"I've never... felt that way... for any woman.",
      "I've tried, but I just can't...\" I covered my face with my hands, hating myself.",
      "Why couldn't I just do what he asked?",
      "Why couldn't I make myself desire something that men were supposed to want?",
      "\"I want you to try, Ganymede.",
      "I know it won't be easy, and I know that you might never feel the way a husband ought to feel about his wife,\" I had to bite back a sob when he said that, my fingers digging into my scalp, punishing me for my wretchedness.",
      "Father continued.",
      "\"But I think if you give it a chance, you'll be able to find some happiness with your wife.",
      "Maybe not the kind of romantic love most young people desire in a marriage, but in a marital relationship affection and respect are just as valuable as any of that.",
      "I think you could be happy, Ganymede.",
      "And, after a few children have been conceived, perhaps you could find... other ways to fulfill your needs.\"",
      "I uncovered my face and looked up at him.",
      "He watched me, his head tilted to the side.",
      "\"You mean,\" I hesitated, almost afraid to ask.",
      "\"That you expect me to have relationships with men outside of my marriage?\" \"Affairs aren't exactly uncommon, Ganymede,\" he said ruefully.",
      "\"Between men and women or otherwise.",
      "I know a few men who discuss their male lovers with their wives openly, though you'd better be pretty sure she approves before you do that.\"",
      "He chuckled, clapping his hand on my shoulder one last time before turning to leave.",
      "\"I want you to be happy, Ganymede.",
      "I know it may not seem like that now, but I really do want you to enjoy your life.",
      "But we all must make sacrifices.\"",
      "I stayed up on the wall after Father left.",
      "I looked out at the sea, wondering if there were any foreign lands where it was acceptable to be like I was.",
      "I imagined walking down a public street arm in arm with Isandros, turning to smile up at him the way I'd seen women do to their sweethearts.",
      "My heart hurt with longing for such a place, aching all the more from the belief that no such paradise existed.",
      "At last I turned away from the sea, and began trudging toward home.",
      "The stairs were cast in shadow now that the sun had sank below the horizon and I had to keep my eyes on my feet to see where I was going.",
      "That's why I didn't see the girl until I ran right into her.",
      "She was a laundress from the look of it, and I'd smacked into her so hard that she'd dropped the basket of clothes she was carrying.",
      "She let out a little wail and fell to her knees, picking up the scattered clothes off the ground.",
      "\"I'm so sorry,\" I said, sinking to my knees as well and helping her.",
      "There must have been a hundred garments in that basket and they'd been flung pell-mell across the paving stones.",
      "\"I wasn't watching what I was doing.",
      "Are you hurt?\"",
      "\"No, sir,\" she replied.",
      "Her tone was brusque.",
      "I felt my ears turning hot.",
      "\"I really am sorry.\"",
      "We picked up the rest of the clothes in silence.",
      "I plucked up the last tunic and brought it over to where she was kneeling beside the basket.",
      "I dropped the tunic on top of the pile.",
      "She glanced up at me and did a double take, her mouth falling open a little.",
      "\"My--my prince,\" she stuttered, rising to her feet.",
      "\"I'm so sorry.",
      "I didn't know it was you.\"",
      "I smiled politely.",
      "\"It's all right.",
      "I'm the one who wasn't paying attention.\"",
      "The girl kept watching me, her eyes wide.",
      "She had astonishing eyes, such a pale blue that they looked nearly colorless in the dim light.",
      "They were drifting back and forth across my face in a way that I recognized.",
      "I was used to women ogling at me, just like I was used to men teasing me about my pretty face.",
      "Assaracus always said I looked like a girl.",
      "My mother had called me beautiful until I was fourteen when Father told her to quit embarrassing me.",
      "The girl was beautiful too.",
      "She had long dark hair swept into an ornate updo on top of her head.",
      "It contrasted dramatically with her light skin and pale blue eyes.",
      "She also had a pair of full red lips and the kind of curves that would fill other men's dreams long after they'd seen her.",
      "I stared at her, trying to make my body respond.",
      "My eyes admired her, but only in the way someone admired an artist's statue.",
      "My heart wasn't aroused and neither was anything else.",
      "\"Excuse me,\" I murmured, trying to move past her.",
      "\"Of course, my prince,\" she murmured, her tone demure.",
      "She stepped aside and did something strange with her eyes.",
      "She glanced at the ground and then back up at me, her pale eyes shining through a forest of black eyelashes.",
      "Her gaze smoldered, and it was suddenly difficult to move.",
      "My breathing stuttered.",
      "The world narrowed until all I could see were those blue eyes.",
      "Then the girl blinked and the connection was broken.",
      "She giggled and turned away, casting me one last look over her shoulder.",
      "\"Goodnight,\" she called, giggling again, her hips swaying as she walked.",
      "I gaped after her, my thoughts sluggish.",
      "Taking a deep breath, I looked away from her, shaking my head a little to get my thoughts moving again.",
      "I wasn't entirely sure what had just happened, but it had been incredible.",
      "I'd felt like my entire existence could have been snuffed out by those eyes.",
      "Was this what other men felt around women?",
      "I looked back at the girl, but she was already gone, having vanished as suddenly as she'd come.",
      "I stepped out of the shower and toweled off.",
      "A drop of water had gotten down in my ear and I had to tilt my head to the side until it drained before I could move on with my life.",
      "Then I brushed my teeth and slipped on some new boxers before waltzing out to face the day.",
      "A few years ago I'd decided to move to a new bedroom and had furnished it all on my own.",
      "My new room was small--this is, comparatively small.",
      "There was a platform bed on one side, a dresser and closet on the other, and a small, built-in desk in the far corner with a bar stool in front of it.",
      "The closet wasn't a walk-in, I'd gotten the antique dresser and barstool at a garage sale and refurbished them myself, and--horror of horrors--the bed was a queen size.",
      "Zeus had nearly gone into conniptions the first time he'd walked in.",
      "\"Are you dumping me?\" he'd demanded.",
      "\"What?",
      "No.\"",
      "\"Then why does it feel like you're trying to squeeze me out of your life?\"",
      "He'd walked around the room, stretching out his arms like he was measuring the space.",
      "\"Seven steps.",
      "It takes seven steps to get from one end to the other.",
      "I can barely breathe in here!\"",
      "I'd rolled my eyes.",
      "\"Oh, come on.",
      "There's two of us.",
      "This is plenty of room.\"",
      "He'd whirled on me, eyes bright.",
      "\"I know what this is,\" he'd accused, pointing his finger at me.",
      "\"You've become one of those weird minimalists!\"",
      "That had made me laugh.",
      "\"You say it like it's a bad thing.\"",
      "\"It's sad.",
      "Look at this place.",
      "It's tiny.",
      "You're the cupbearer to the King of Heaven.",
      "You deserve better than a broom closet.\"",
      "\"But this is what I want,\" I'd replied.",
      "\"I like it how it is.",
      "Bedrooms aren't supposed to be the cathedrals of your life, Zeus.",
      "They're supposed to be your quiet monastery, a place of peace and mediation.\"",
      "I'd read that in a book once.",
      "\"So you've decided to become a monk now?\" he'd grumbled.",
      "I'd smiled and strolled over to him before wrapping my arms around his waist.",
      "\"Not exactly,\" I'd purred, standing on my tiptoes to kiss him.",
      "Zeus had gotten over it eventually, and though I'd never convinced him to take up the lifestyle himself, he had admitted to me once that my \"little\" bed was cozier than the one in his room.",
      "He was still lying in it when I came out of the bathroom, his long limbs sprawled across it like a giant starfish.",
      "I chuckled at him as I grabbed a pair of jeans and a T-shirt out of my closet and pulled them on before going over to my desk.",
      "I switched on my laptop and listened as it hummed to life, swinging my bare feet as I waited for it to warm up.",
      "I glanced over at Zeus, my memories sweeping up around me again.",
      "The next morning, right after breakfast, I went to find my father.",
      "\"I want you to go ahead with the marriage negotiations,\" I told him.",
      "He nodded and wrote something down on a scrap of parchment.",
      "I had to go out with the sheep after that.",
      "Life as a prince of Troy wasn't always as grand as it sounded, and life as the third prince was even duller.",
      "I plopped down under a tree, my face leaning against my palm, my jaw slack with boredom.",
      "There was a rustling in the branches above me.",
      "I glanced up-- and nearly had a stroke when I saw the colossal bird watching me.",
      "I gawked up at it for a long time, barely believing what I was witnessing.",
      "It was the eagle from yesterday, and he was scrutinizing me, his head turned so that he could see me with one of those big yellow eyes.",
      "I felt my heart flipping in my chest, and I thought for a moment that I was going ot be sick.",
      "It was one thing to see the monster eagle from a distance, but this close I could make out each individual feather and count its giant claws, each one longer than my hand.",
      "Holding my breath, I eased away from the tree, trying not to startle it.",
      "The eagle watched me go, never taking its eye off me.",
      "We stared each other down until I was out from under the tree and the leaves obscured my view.",
      "There was a loud whooshing noise, and the eagle flew off, soaring above my head until it disappeared into the distance.",
      "I watched it go, praying that it wouldn't come back.",
      "Not much else happened that afternoon.",
      "I stayed away from any trees, and the eagle never came close to me again, though I did him swooping by every now and then.",
      "Finally, I headed back to Troy, shooing my flock in front of me.",
      "I left them in their fold and then walked into the city, pulling off my shepherd cap as I went.",
      "People looked at me as I walked down the main road.",
      "Many of them bowed as I passed by.",
      "I smiled at them, hurrying to get away.",
      "I could feel their eyes on me, boring into my skin like invisible awls, gnawing away at my flesh.",
      "Mother always said that they stared because I was beautiful, but I didn't feel beautiful when they watched me.",
      "I felt like an insect trapped in the bottom of a bowl, scrabbling uselessly for a way out as little boys jeered at me from above.",
      "The day was ending and the streets were crowded with people trying to get out of the city before the gates closed for the night.",
      "Every once in awhile I'd feel someone rub up against me.",
      "I ignored this as well as I could, but sometimes I couldn't help but cringe as I felt a hand brush along my arm in a very non-accidental way.",
      "I'd always look around, but with this press of people it was usually impossible to tell who'd done it.",
      "Up ahead, I saw a familiar figure walking toward me, a basket of clothes under her arm.",
      "It was the blue-eyed laundress from the night before.",
      "She caught my eye and brazenly held my gaze as she drew closer.",
      "Just like before, my breath caught in my throat and I couldn't look away.",
      "Her lips turned up at the corners.",
      "At that moment the crowd around me compressed as a large cart rumbled down the street, people pushed to the sides of the road as it passed by.",
      "The girl met me then and turned sideways to squeeze between me and another traveler, her breasts pressing against my upper arm and her free hand snagging in my belt, tugging on it a little.",
      "I shot her an astonished look, ready to tell her off, but in that instant I met her gaze again and lost all power of speech.",
      "\"Pardon me, my prince,\" she whispered between barely moving lips, her blue eyes dancing.",
      "And then she was gone, swallowed up in the crowd like she'd never existed.",
      "I scanned the street for her, searching for her dark head bobbing through the mass of people.",
      "I never caught sight of her and eventually gave up, turning back toward home.",
      "I practiced my sword play with Isandros once I got back, but I was so distracted that I could barely focus.",
      "\"What's up with you?\" he wondered after I'd lost my third match in ten minutes.",
      "I shrugged.",
      "\"Just not into it today I guess,\" I muttered, avoiding his eyes.",
      "\"Is this about your father?\" he asked.",
      "I glanced over at him.",
      "\"What?\"",
      "\"Yesterday you looked pretty nervous when he said he wanted to talk to you.\"",
      "I shuffled my feet, my cheeks blazing.",
      "If only Isandros knew the subject of our conversation, he wouldn't be so quick to pry.",
      "I decided to give him an answer, though not an entirely truthful one.",
      "\"I'm getting married.\"",
      "He raised his eyebrows.",
      "\"Really?",
      "To whom?\" I shrugged.",
      "\"Some girl from Corinth.",
      "I've never met her.\"",
      "\"Oh.\"",
      "I looked over at him, desperately wanting to know what he was thinking.",
      "Was he jealous?",
      "Did he not want me to get married?",
      "Or did he just not care enough to say anything else?",
      "\"Um, how do you feel about that?\" he asked eventually.",
      "I shrugged again.",
      "\"It's a good match.\"",
      "He snorted.",
      "\"Glad my parents haven't found any \"good matches\" for me yet.",
      "Sounds pretty boring.\"",
      "I smiled a little.",
      "\"It does, doesn't it?\"",
      "We were quiet for several moments, neither of us knowing what to say.",
      "\"Well,\" he said at last, clapping his hands together.",
      "\"You don't have to stay out here if you don't feel like it.",
      "Why don't you take the rest of the night off?\" I think he wanted me to be excited, but the words made me feel hollow inside.",
      "I didn't want to leave him, not when I only had so much time before I wed. I argued with myself that now was the time to start the separation, making it gradual so that I wouldn't feel so much pain once I had to give him up for good.",
      "My heart rebelled against the notion.",
      "I never wanted to say goodbye to Isandros.",
      "\"We don't have to,\" I replied.",
      "\"I can keep going.\"",
      "He gave me a little smile.",
      "\"As much as I'd like to, I think we should take a break.",
      "Go get a good night's sleep.\"",
      "I had to relent.",
      "We went into the armor room and put up our practice swords.",
      "Isandros playfully punched my arm.",
      "\"See you tomorrow?\" he asked.",
      "\"Yeah.\"",
      "He shot me one last grin and headed off toward his home.",
      "I stood in the doorway of the armor room, unsure what to do.",
      "I wanted to go after Isandros, grab him by the back of his tunic and beg him to run away with me.",
      "We'd go find that mythical land where men could be together openly, not just in the shadows and behind closed doors.",
      "I wanted to be with Isandros, forever, not just as some love affair after I'd begotten a son or two.",
      "I leaned against the door frame and rubbed my chest, feeling my heart break inside me.",
      "There was a rustle of fabric next to me.",
      "I flinched and glanced to my left, only to see the blue-eyed girl.",
      "I swore and took a step away from her.",
      "How had she managed to sneak up without me seeing her?",
      "The girl smiled at me, tilting her head to the side.",
      "\"Did I scare you?\"",
      "\"What are you doing here?\"",
      "She pouted.",
      "\"You don't want me here?\"",
      "She took a step toward me and lowered her voice.",
      "\"It looked like you did, when you were searching for me in the market earlier.\"",
      "\"I didn't--\" \"Shhh,\" she place two fingers on my lips and looked up at me beneath half-lowered eyelids.",
      "\"You don't have to apologize.",
      "I looked for you as well.\"",
      "She grinned.",
      "\"Only my search was more successful.\"",
      "\"You shouldn't be here,\" I told her, glancing around.",
      "No one else was nearby, but I didn't want to risk being seen with her.",
      "It was obvious that she was some kind of harlot.",
      "\"Do you want to send me away?",
      "Why?",
      "Don't you think I'm pretty?\" she tipped her head to the side, like she was genuinely curious.",
      "\"I want you to think I'm pretty.",
      "Would you rather I have fair hair?\"",
      "She wasn't making any sense.",
      "\"Your hair is fine,\" I said.",
      "She smiled again.",
      "\"Good.",
      "I was hoping you'd like it.\"",
      "Suddenly, she put her hand on my chest and pushed me back into the armor room, grabbing the front of my tunic when I almost fell backwards.",
      "She was strong for a girl.",
      "Laundry must be hard work.",
      "\"What are you doing?\" I demanded.",
      "\"What would you like me to do?\" \"What?",
      "Get away from me!\"",
      "\"Why?\" she asked, completely unperturbed by my tone.",
      "She leaned even closer to me, her hands winding up into my hair, bringing my face close to hers, her soft breasts pressed against my chest.",
      "I couldn't help but look into her eyes again, and all my thoughts vanished.",
      "\"I've seen your sad eyes, Ganymede,\" she said, her breath fanning across my face.",
      "Her voice was like a silk rope, slithering around my mind and tying me fast.",
      "\"Don't you want me to make you feel better?",
      "I can make you feel so good.\"",
      "Without another word, she kissed me full on the mouth.",
      "I froze, feeling her lips move against mine.",
      "I watched her, my eyes wide open.",
      "I'd never been kissed before and it was strange to have someone's face that close to my own.",
      "I noticed how long her nose was and the tiny flecks of black khole smattered across her cheek, like she'd rubbed her eye.",
      "Once her eyes weren't boring into mine, my brain was able to function again, and after another moment I disentangled myself from the kiss.",
      "She blinked up at me, surprised.",
      "\"What's wrong?\" \"What's wrong?\" I demanded.",
      "\"I don't even know you.",
      "And I'd like you to leave.\"",
      "She stared up at me, her mouth hanging open.",
      "\"You want me to leave?\" she asked.",
      "\"Yes,\" I said, exasperated.",
      "Her bottom lip began to tremble and to my utter amazement, her eyes began to sparkle with unshed tears.",
      "\"So, you really don't want me?\"",
      "Swallowing hard, I shook my head.",
      "\"I'm sorry.\"",
      "\"But, why?",
      "Why don't you want me?",
      "You said I was pretty!\"",
      "I could only gape at her helplessly, completely unsure what to do.",
      "\"Please don't cry,\" I said.",
      "She stomped her foot.",
      "\"Why shouldn't I cry?",
      "You keep watching me and keep smiling at me and you say that I'm pretty and then you do this!\"",
      "\"I do think you're pretty,\" I said.",
      "\"Really.",
      "It's just that, well, I'm not looking for anyone to, um, make me feel good right now.\"",
      "She huffed and looked up at me again, her blue eyes blazing.",
      "\"Why not?\"",
      "She narrowed her eyes.",
      "\"Is there somebody else?",
      "There's somebody else, isn't there?\"",
      "\"No,\" I said, wondering how in the world I'd gotten into this mess.",
      "The girl didn't say anything for a few moments, the heat fading from those hypnotic eyes.",
      "She considered me.",
      "\"Do you not want me to touch you because you don't want me?",
      "Or is it because you're afraid?\"",
      "She came toward me again, her eyes beginning to smolder.",
      "I looked away before they could ensnare me again.",
      "I felt her touch my chest with her finger, trailing it up to the collar of my tunic.",
      "She began rubbing the material between her fingers.",
      "I snatched her hand in my own, trying to push her away.",
      "\"Have you ever been touched, Ganymede?\" she asked.",
      "I glared at the far wall, refusing to meet her gaze.",
      "\"I want you to leave,\" I growled.",
      "\"I'd be gentle with you,\" she whispered.",
      "\"I'd be good to you, my prince.",
      "I'd make you feel like a god.\"",
      "\"Get out.\"",
      "\"Please,\" she pleaded.",
      "\"Please, don't send me away.",
      "I've dreamed of you, Ganymede.",
      "I've dreamed of you every night since I first saw you.",
      "You fill my head all day and chase me though my sleep.",
      "I can't think about anything but you.",
      "Let me touch you.",
      "Let me make you feel like a man.\"",
      "I closed my eyes.",
      "Who was this woman?",
      "How had I allowed this to happen?",
      "\"I can't.\"",
      "I sighed.",
      "\"I'm sorry, but I can't do it.",
      "I have to go.\"",
      "I let go of her hand and walked past her.",
      "She didn't try to stop me.",
      "I paused in the doorway and glanced back at her.",
      "She was still turned away from me, her eyes on the floor.",
      "I told myself to leave, to run away from this crazy girl and never look back.",
      "But something about her expression made that impossible.",
      "Inexplicably, I almost felt sorry for her.",
      "I cleared my throat.",
      "She looked up at me, her extraordinary eyes suddenly dull.",
      "\"By the way,\" I said, giving her a tiny smile.",
      "\"I never asked you what your name was.\"",
      "She blinked at me a couple of times, and I wondered if she was going to answer.",
      "\"It's Olympia,\" she said eventually.",
      "I nodded once then hurried away.",
      "My dreams were a mess that night.",
      "They started out fine.",
      "I was walking through a beautiful forest, my hand in Isandros' as he led me to our paradise.",
      "\"We're nearly there, Ganymede,\" he said, looking at me over his shoulder.",
      "His eyes were dark and warm and his hair was slipping out of its tie again.",
      "I wanted to reach forward to push it back into place but he was walking too fast and it was all I could do to keep up.",
      "I heard the roar of a waterfall up ahead.",
      "\"I love you,\" I told him, wondering where I got the courage.",
      "He smiled at me, showing off his dimples.",
      "My stomach fluttered when I thought about our destination.",
      "A romantic pool at the foot of a waterfall?",
      "My mind wandered to places it shouldn't.",
      "We'd be all alone there.",
      "All alone, no other person around for miles.",
      "I grinned, warmth spreading across my cheekbones.",
      "There were just a few more trees up ahead.",
      "The path led around them, the sun shining through the leaves.",
      "And then everything changed.",
      "The trees fell away, and stone walls rose up around me.",
      "Isandros changed into my brother Ilus, and the roar of the waterfall became the sound of a large crowd of people, their voices echoing around the chamber.",
      "My father stood at the far end of the hall with another man, both of them looking at me with eyes of ice.",
      "A slender figure stood beside them, draped in a gauzy veil.",
      "I tugged against Ilus' restraining hand.",
      "\"No,\" I begged.",
      "\"No, please, don't make me.",
      "I don't want to marry her!",
      "I don't want to marry her!\"",
      "\"Shut up,\" Ilus snapped, not looking at me.",
      "A shadow fell across us and I looked up to see the golden eagle swoop through the rafters, alighting right above my father, its yellow eye watching me.",
      "\"Let me go!\"",
      "I screamed, fighting against my brother.",
      "\"Please, let me go.",
      "Isandros!",
      "Isandros, help!\"",
      "I looked around the room but Isandros was nowhere to be seen.",
      "We came to the front of the room and Ilus held me still as my father blessed the marriage.",
      "\"May you have many children,\" he said, his deep voice booming throughout the hall.",
      "\"And may this young woman tame my son's deviant heart.\"",
      "\"Aristomache,\" said the other man, presumably Pentares, her father.",
      "\"Take off your veil.",
      "Let Ganymede see you.\"",
      "I struggled against Ilus, sobbing to be let go.",
      "\"I can't marry her, I can't.",
      "Father, please--\" The girl pulled her gauzy veil aside, revealing her face.",
      "Pale blue eyes scorched my skin, drawing me into a whirlwind of color and sound.",
      "I screamed, flailing, falling through space and time, sure that I was about to be smashed to splinters.",
      "Then I was lying in soft grass, not falling at all.",
      "The roar of a waterfall filled my ears, along with the gentle lap of water on stone and the rustle of wind through the trees.",
      "\"Isandros?\"",
      "\"My prince,\" he whispered in my ear.",
      "I grinned and rolled over to look at him, only to jerk back when I came face to face with a stranger.",
      "He was young, around my own age, with inky black curls and almost-colorless blue eyes.",
      "With a start, I realized that he looked just like Olympia.",
      "His pretty lips curled up in a smile and he crawled toward me on hands and knees, his eyes holding me in place.",
      "He rose over me where I lay sprawled on my back, his hands on either side of my head.",
      "\"I've dreamed of you, Ganymede,\" he whispered.",
      "They were Olympia's words spoken in Isandros' voice.",
      "\"I've dreamed of you every night since I first saw you.\"",
      "The stranger leaned down and kissed me, just like Olympia had.",
      "Only it was nothing like when she'd kissed me.",
      "Fire roared through my veins and I lost my mind.",
      "The strange boy's hand cradled the back of my head and I leaned up into the kiss, my eyes slipping closed.",
      "My hands crept around his back and I pulled him down onto me.",
      "He groaned and bucked his hips against me, grinding against my pelvis.",
      "I gasped, tilting my head back and feeling his lips descend down my throat.",
      "\"Isandros,\" I whimpered.",
      "\"No,\" said the stranger with Isandros' voice.",
      "\"Don't say his name.",
      "You're with me now.\"",
      "I looked up at him, melting beneath his gaze.",
      "\"Who are you, then?\"",
      "But before he could answer, the dream melted away, the paradise shattering into a million silver stars.",
      "I opened my eyes, waking alone in my own bed.",
      "I pushed myself upright, feeling more confused than I ever had.",
      "I was so aroused, my cock stiff beneath the sheets.",
      "I ran a hand back through my hair, my face growing warm with the memory of the dream, even as I was overcome with chagrin.",
      "The boy in the dream hadn't been Isandros.",
      "He wasn't the man I loved.",
      "He hadn't even been real, just some male equivalent of my would-be seductress.",
      "And yet, when I'd woken, my first thought hadn't been shame over my dream-adultery.",
      "It had been disappointment that I hadn't gotten to learn the stranger's name.",
      "\"Dammit,\" I said, collapsing back against the pillows.",
      "My cock was lifting up the sheet, creating a tent.",
      "I glared at it, knowing I'd never be able to sleep if I didn't take care of it.",
      "I slid my hand beneath the sheet and closed my eyes, deliberately thinking about Isandros.",
      "I imagined his face hovering above me, his lips parted and brown eyes full of lust.",
      "Those were his fingers gripping me, his hand pumping up and down, sending shivers of pleasure across my entire body.",
      "I let my imagination roam wild, thinking about the other things we'd be doing to each other if the first part of the dream had been real.",
      "I imagined the way his curly brown hair would wave back and forth as he ground his erection against mine, our breathing coming in frantic gasps.",
      "Then he'd flip me over onto my stomach.",
      "In my fantasies, it was always Isandros who did the penetrating.",
      "Perhaps it wasn't very masculine of me, but I'd always wanted to be on the bottom half of my first sexual encounter, with Isandros--the stronger one, the braver one, the more manly one--entering me.",
      "I really didn't have much to offer anyone, but people said I was beautiful.",
      "I would be try to look beautiful for my love as he took me.",
      "I imagined what Isandros' face would look like once he was fully inside me.",
      "His head would be tilted back, his eyes squeezed shut and his mouth open in a silent cry of pleasure.",
      "I groaned just thinking about it, my hand moving faster beneath the sheet.",
      "In my mind's eye, he began thrusting in time with my real-life hand movements.",
      "I was sure that I'd never want him to move that fast in actuality, but in my fantasies he rode me ragged, pumping into me for all he was worth.",
      "As I rose closer to my peak, my thoughts became frantic and my control slipped.",
      "Without me being able to stop it, the boy in my delusion changed.",
      "His skin lightened, his hands gripping my hips, holding me steady as he fucked me.",
      "Isandros' brown curls darkened to black and his face became radiant, his eyes otherworldly.",
      "I pressed my free hand against my mouth to keep from crying out.",
      "The strange boy whispered to me again, using Isandros' voice.",
      "\"I've dreamed of you, Ganymede,\" he said, looking down at Fantasy Me with those haunting eyes.",
      "\"I've dreamed of you every night since I first saw you.",
      "You fill my head every moment of the day and chase me though my sleep.\"",
      "He tightened his grip on my hips and pulled me back against him as he lunged forward.",
      "Fantasy Me squealed and Real Me moaned against my fist.",
      "\"I can't think about anything but you.\"",
      "He slammed into me again.",
      "\"Let me touch you.\"",
      "Slam.",
      "I was so close to my climax that I started trembling.",
      "\"Let me make you feel...\" he growled, shoving himself into me one last time.",
      "\"Like a man.\"",
      "In real life, I twisted into my pillow, pressing my face into it as I shouted, my body spasming as I released.",
      "I collapsed against the bed, my ears ringing and my face still buried in the pillow.",
      "It was several moments before I could move.",
      "When I finally did, I rolled onto my back and stared at the ceiling, waiting for my breathing to slow.",
      "I contemplated what had just happened.",
      "Isandros was the love of my life, yet he'd not been the one I'd screamed for.",
      "I'd shouted for the stranger.",
      "Embarrassment swept over me, almost powerful enough to eradicate my euphoria.",
      "Almost.",
      "The phone vibrated on the table.",
      "I glanced over and saw a text message on the homescreen.",
      "It was from Hebe and read: \"Hey, dad with you?\"",
      "\"Yeah\" I texted back.",
      "\"K. He need anything?\" I glanced over at Zeus before replying.",
      "He was still asleep.",
      "\"I got it handled.\"",
      "\"K\" I regarded the text mournfully, restraining myself from calling her up and giving her my \"K\" rant.",
      "I didn't care how dismal society became, \"K\" would never be an acceptable response.",
      "I tapped back to my messaging home screen and pulled up Hermes' number.",
      "\"Hey,\" I typed.",
      "\"Connect Coffee House.",
      "One 16 oz.",
      "black, one 16 oz caramel hazelnut iced latte with whip. \"",
      "I put the phone down and turned back to my computer.",
      "A blank, white screen gazed back, the little black cursor winking at me.",
      "I placed my hands back on the keyboard, ready to type, when my phone buzzed.",
      "Glancing over at it, I saw his response.",
      "\"I'm not your errand boy.\"",
      "I rolled my eyes.",
      "\"Your dad says don't forget the whip.\"",
      "I lied, flipping the phone over so that I couldn't see the screen.",
      "I looked back at my computer.",
      "I was starting a new novel and wasn't quite sure how to begin.",
      "It was days before I could look Isandros in the eye.",
      "The dream lingered in my thoughts, the memories leaking into my bloodstream and becoming a part of me.",
      "I tried not to think about what had happened, either the dream or the orgasm, but it was impossible not to.",
      "I began making excuses not to see him, as foolish as that was, to avoid the awkward silences that had started sprouting up between us.",
      "I tried telling myself that it was just a stupid dream.",
      "I hadn't actually done anything wrong.",
      "But I couldn't seem to convince myself.",
      "I'd seen Olympia once since the bizarre interview in the armory.",
      "She'd been across the street from me, carrying her load of laundry.",
      "I caught her staring, but she'd immediately dropped her gaze and turned another way.",
      "Seeing her had only made me think of the dream boy and something stirred in my gut, both painful and tantalizing.",
      "The pasture was the only place I could find any peace.",
      "Up there was nothing but wind and the smell of sheep and the sea.",
      "I'd walked across the Trojan countryside, allowing my mind to empty itself of all its convoluted cares.",
      "Every once in awhile I'd search the sky for the giant eagle, but it never appeared.",
      "Clouds would sail across the heavens like ships on the sea, and fluttering birds darted around them like schools of fish, but the eagle, the king of the sky, never revealed himself to me.",
      "Father had sent a letter to Pentares of Corinth, relating my eagerness to move forward with negotiations.",
      "We expected my bride to set sail for Troy within a week.",
      "I'd begun staying out in the hills later than usual, coming back after dusk, trying to avoid people as much as I could.",
      "Isandros would wait for me in the training yard.",
      "He never mentioned my strange new moodiness, but I could read the concern behind his eyes.",
      "Finally, after the fourth day, he cornered me outside the door of the palace.",
      "\"Have I done something to upset you?\" he asked.",
      "I blinked in surprise.",
      "\"No, of course not.\"",
      "\"Then why do you keep treating me like I slapped your grandmother?\" I chuckled.",
      "\"I'm sorry.",
      "Really.",
      "It's not anything you've done, it's just...\" I trailed off, unsure what to even say.",
      "Honestly, not even I knew what was wrong.",
      "I just felt... empty inside.",
      "Like my heart had shriveled up in an attempt to escape the pain of my circumstances.",
      "I looked at Isandros, my insides melting at the concern in his eyes.",
      "It made me happy.",
      "It made me very, very sad.",
      "He tilted his head to the side, his curls falling over his forehead.",
      "\"This is about your engagement, isn't it?",
      "You haven't been acting right since that night.\"",
      "I nodded.",
      "That was part of it, but not nearly enough.",
      "\"I don't love her,\" I muttered, feeling embarrassed to say it out loud.",
      "It sounded so childish.",
      "\"I don't even know her.",
      "What if we end up hating each other?\"",
      "He stepped toward me and put his hand on my arm.",
      "My entire world shrank to the warmth and weight of that hand.",
      "\"You won't,\" he told me.",
      "\"No one could ever hate you, Ganymede.",
      "You're too good.\"",
      "I glanced up at him, meeting his gaze.",
      "He smiled at me, his eyes tender.",
      "\"She'll be a lucky woman.\"",
      "I shook my head.",
      "\"I'm not so sure.",
      "Even if she does learn to like me, what if I can't do the same to her?\" I paused, weighing my next words.",
      "\"What if I fall in love with somebody else?\"",
      "He frowned at me.",
      "\"Are you in love with somebody?",
      "Is that the real reason for all this?",
      "Some girl's gone and caught your eye?\"",
      "He grinned.",
      "I glanced away from him, blushing.",
      "\"No,\" I muttered.",
      "He laughed.",
      "\"Poor Ganymede.",
      "Love's a fickle bitch, isn't it?\"",
      "\"Yes,\" I whispered.",
      "He patted my shoulder, and suddenly it didn't feel quite so good.",
      "\"You'll make it through.",
      "Just give the girl a chance.",
      "And if she doesn't turn out to be everything you've wanted, well,\" he winked at me.",
      "\"Who says you need to spend every night in her bed, huh?\"",
      "He patted my arm again and headed off in the opposite direction, leaving me staring after him.",
      "The next day when I took the flock out, I went north, keeping the sea to my left and the wild hill country to my right.",
      "The hills were steeper here, and less vegetation grew.",
      "There was enough for my herd though, so I didn't worry too much about it.",
      "I led them far out into the wild, the city vanishing behind us.",
      "After a couple hours the landscape had changed dramatically.",
      "Lush pasture land spread out around me in a long plateau.",
      "At the furthest edge, the earth dropped away, leaving a sheer cliff-face, the surf pounding against the thin stretch of beach a hundred feet below.",
      "I picked my way to the edge of the cliff, feeling the sea breeze ruffle my hair and tug at my clothes.",
      "I tilted my head back and breathed in the briney air, letting it wash over me and blow away my heartache.",
      "A shrill cry caught my attention.",
      "Opening my eyes, I saw the golden eagle wheeling above me, its beak and claws glinting in the bright light.",
      "It flew out over the sea and dove, its wings curling in around its body until the instant before it hit the water.",
      "Its wings unfurled and it skimmed over the surface of the waves, catching a large fish in its talons.",
      "I watched as the eagle labored to keep the squirming fish aloft, but after a few moments it let go, the fish living to see another day.",
      "The bird swooped upwards again, sharp eyes searching for another catch.",
      "I stood watching the eagle for quite some time, envying its freedom.",
      "Occasionally it'd let out a shriek of exultation, whirling and diving without a care in the world.",
      "At last it must have grown tired of all its failed fishing attempts and went in search of less slippery prey, flying up into the clouds until I lost sight of it.",
      "I returned my gaze to the sea.",
      "I wondered if my betrothed had heard the news yet.",
      "Would she weep when she found out she was being shipped off to a city she'd never seen?",
      "Or would she rejoice to be getting a husband before she became an old maid?",
      "One of these days I'd get the chance to ask her.",
      "Something hit me on the back of the head.",
      "I cried out, more from surprise than pain.",
      "The blow had pushed me to my knees and I whirled about, searching for my attacker.",
      "Another scream filled the air.",
      "I looked up.",
      "There was the eagle, flying away from me, something red in its claws.",
      "I gaped, and reached up to my head.",
      "Sure enough, my shepherd's cap was gone.",
      "The bastard had snuck up behind me and snatched it away.",
      "I watched the eagle go, expecting to see it drop the cap into the ocean.",
      "It wheeled in the opposite direction though, and flew a few more seconds before releasing the cap, probably realizing that it wasn't food.",
      "I huffed and ran over to get it, being sure to keep the eagle in sight in case he swept around again and tried to take my head off this time.",
      "The bird flew into the distance and disappeared behind some trees.",
      "I reached the area where I'd seen it fall, but still had to search around through the underbrush before I spotted it, snagged on a thornbush.",
      "I pried it out of the thorns, sticking myself a couple times in the process.",
      "\"What happened?\" someone asked from right behind me.",
      "I started so violently that I dropped the cap again.",
      "I turned to see Olympia standing there, her hands tucked behind her back as she regarded me.",
      "\"What in the--where did you come from?\" I sputtered.",
      "She raised an eyebrow at my tone.",
      "\"I've been here the whole time,\" she replied.",
      "\"I was walking along the beach and saw you standing at the edge of the cliff.",
      "I came up to make sure you weren't thinking about jumping.\"",
      "It was difficult to argue with her assurity, but I hadn't seen her down on the beach.",
      "I told her as much.",
      "Olympia frowned.",
      "\"You must be blind then.\"",
      "She changed the subject before I could reply, pointing at the cap in my hands.",
      "\"Why do you wear that thing?\"",
      "\"It's a shepherd's cap,\" I muttered, putting it back on my head.",
      "\"I'm a shepherd.\"",
      "\"I thought you were the prince?\"",
      "\"Yes, well, I'm the third prince, which means I get to watch the sheep.\"",
      "I turned and walked back toward my vantage point over the sea.",
      "I was hoping she'd leave, but I doubted it.",
      "Sure enough, I heard her following after me, her bare feet whispering over the grass.",
      "\"Do you like watching sheep?\" I laughed a little.",
      "\"Nobody likes watching sheep.",
      "Sheep are the stupidest animals alive.",
      "And the dullest.\"",
      "\"I don't know, it seems like it might be fun.\"",
      "We'd come to the edge of the cliff again.",
      "I looked down at the crashing waves beneath me, watching the foam collect at the edge of the sea.",
      "\"It's not,\" I told her.",
      "\"But sometimes it is nice to get away from the city.\"",
      "She made a sound of agreement.",
      "I could feel her eyes on me but I kept my attention on the sea.",
      "I was a little nervous, being out here all by myself with this girl.",
      "She didn't really look like a harlot, but I remembered all too clearly the persistence she'd displayed in the armory.",
      "\"Why are you out here?\" I asked.",
      "I saw her shrug in my periphery.",
      "\"I like being alone sometimes.",
      "And the sea is beautiful.\"",
      "I glanced over at her.",
      "She was looking out at the sea now, her eyes squinting against the afternoon sunlight.",
      "I turned to do the same.",
      "\"I'd love to see more of it,\" I said.",
      "\"Where all have you been?",
      "What cities have you gone to?\"",
      "I shook my head.",
      "\"I've never been away from Troy.\"",
      "She seemed surprised.",
      "\"Never?\" \"Nope.\"",
      "She appraised me.",
      "\"How old are you, Ganymede?\" \"Seventeen.\"",
      "\"So young,\" she murmured.",
      "I looked over at her.",
      "\"You're not exactly ancient yourself,\" I pointed out.",
      "She grinned.",
      "\"Where would you go, then, if you ever left Troy?\" I considered it.",
      "\"Somewhere far away,\" I said.",
      "\"Somewhere nobody's here's ever even heard of.\"",
      "\"What would you do there?\" I smiled a little sadly, thinking of my paradise.",
      "\"I'd live.\"",
      "Olympia studied me, seeming to hear the edge in my voice.",
      "\"You aren't living here?\"",
      "\"Not really.\"",
      "We were quiet for a bit, neither of us seeming to know what to say.",
      "\"I'd like to see Paphos,\" she said at last.",
      "\"The birthplace of Aphrodite,\" I said.",
      "\"That doesn't really surprise me.\"",
      "\"What?\"",
      "\"You seem like the kind of person who'd spends a lot of time making herself beautiful.\"",
      "She scoffed, but didn't try to argue.",
      "\"Not all of us wake up looking as perfect as you do.\"",
      "I snorted.",
      "\"Nobody wakes up looking perfect.\"",
      "\"Of course not,\" she said sarcastically.",
      "We lapsed into silence again.",
      "The wind was blowing a little harder now.",
      "It pulled some of her dark hair out of its braid, and blew it around her face.",
      "I tried to keep my eyes to myself so that I didn't give her any of the wrong ideas, but it was difficult not to look at her.",
      "I kept thinking about the boy in my dreams.",
      "He might have been her brother, they looked so alike.",
      "I sighed.",
      "If only Olympia had been born a boy.",
      "I shook off the thought, ashamed of myself.",
      "I loved Isandros.",
      "It was wrong to fantasize about another man, even one that didn't exist.",
      "She was watching me again, her eyes as blue as the sky and sea around us.",
      "\"Why was your cap in the briar bush?\" she asked suddenly.",
      "\"An eagle stole it.\"",
      "She raised an eyebrow.",
      "\"It did,\" I huffed.",
      "\"Right before you showed up.",
      "The thing flew right over my head, yanked it off and dropped it in the thorn bush.\"",
      "She smirked.",
      "\"Maybe he thought you looked better without it.\"",
      "I rolled my eyes.",
      "\"What?",
      "You think eagles don't know what's stylish?\"",
      "\"I think you're reading too much into this.\"",
      "\"Ha!\"",
      "she lunged toward me and plucked the cap off my head before darting away.",
      "\"Hey!\"",
      "She dangled the cap in front of me, grinning like a lunatic.",
      "\"See, you look much nicer without it.",
      "Let the world see your pretty hair.\"",
      "I tried to grab it back but she danced out of the way, laughing.",
      "\"Give it back!\"",
      "\"You want it?\" she said, \"Come get it.\"",
      "And she took off running, her skirt flying out behind her.",
      "I raced after her, surprised by her speed.",
      "Her laughter peeled across the pasture, and to my surprise I found myself laughing along with her.",
      "\"Give it back!\"",
      "I called.",
      "\"Never!\"",
      "I was gaining on her.",
      "Her skirts were beginning to slow her down and she was laughing so hard that she couldn't focus on running.",
      "Right as I was about to close my hand around her arm, she dashed to the side and I stumbled, my hands clutching at the air.",
      "\"Missed me!\"",
      "I turned to see where she'd gone.",
      "She was standing at the edge of the woods, waving my cap in her hand.",
      "\"All right, give it back,\" I called, reaching out my hand.",
      "\"Huh-uh.\"",
      "\"Olympia,\" I said, using my best prince-voice.",
      "\"Give me back my cap.\"",
      "She stuck out of her tongue and vanished into the forest.",
      "I shook my head in amazement.",
      "She really was mad.",
      "I jogged into the forest, taking a moment to let my eyes adjust to the dim light.",
      "\"Olympia?\"",
      "There was a giggle from above.",
      "I looked up.",
      "She was perched on a limb high above my head, swinging her leg over the side.",
      "\"How did you get up there so fast?\" I asked.",
      "She just smirked.",
      "\"Why don't you come down?\" I said.",
      "\"I don't want to climb up there after you.\"",
      "\"Then I guess you don't want your hat back.\"",
      "I shrugged.",
      "\"It's not like I can't get a new one, you know.\"",
      "She shrugged as well but tossed me the cap.",
      "\"Fine, if it means that much to you.",
      "But I don't want you to put it on.",
      "You're hair's too pretty to be covered up.\"",
      "I rolled my eyes.",
      "\"Whatever makes you happy, I guess.\"",
      "I bent down to retrieve it.",
      "There was a rustle of fabric and before I could stop her, Olympia jumped down and landed right in front of me.",
      "\"Are you crazy?\" I shouted.",
      "The limb she'd been sitting on was more than halfway up the tree.",
      "She could easily have broken her legs.",
      "She brushed her hands together, completely unconcerned.",
      "\"Calm down, Ganymede, everything's--get down!\"",
      "Olympia's hand slammed into my shoulder, knocking me down.",
      "I landed on my stomach in the dust, my face full of prickling grass.",
      "There was a brilliant light above my head and an inhuman shriek that made my blood freeze in my veins.",
      "I looked over and couldn't believe my eyes.",
      "There, in the middle of the clearing, was a snake's head as big around as a bull, with steam curling out of it's maw.",
      "It was so massive that the head was all I could see, the rest of it's body hidden by the undergrowth.",
      "Olympia stood in front of me protectively, facing the creature.",
      "The snake reared up its head and opened its mouth, it's gullet glowing red as an ember and getting brighter by the second.",
      "Before I could stop her, Olympia ran toward it and leapt into the air.",
      "The snake unleashed a volley of fire, instantly incinerating her.",
      "I saw her body dissolve in midair, ashes blasting back from her glowing bones.",
      "I pushed myself to my knees and screamed her name, knowing it was too late.",
      "Then I realized what I was seeing.",
      "The glowing figure that I'd thought was Olympia's ignited skeleton was actually a man.",
      "He landed in front of the snake, his skin brilliant as molten gold, his hair shining white like hot iron.",
      "He stretched his arms out to the sides before bringing his hands together with a boom that shook the earth, blew back the trees and made my hair stand on end.",
      "A twisted bolt of lightning arched out of his fingertips, blasting the creature to cinders and bone.",
      "The snake screamed and jerked as it was obliterated.",
      "Then, as quickly as it had begun, it was over.",
      "The snake was dead, nothing but smoking remains.",
      "The man slowly lowered his hands, balling them into fists at his sides.",
      "He stood with his back to me, the fiery glow fading from his skin until it was no more brilliant than my own.",
      "His clothes--Olympia's dress--had burned away, just like Olympia herself.",
      "I sat there trembling, my mind refusing to believe what my eyes had just witnessed.",
      "\"Are you all right, Ganymede?\" he asked.",
      "His voice was deeper than my own and smooth as honey.",
      "I didn't answer.",
      "I couldn't.",
      "The man glanced over his shoulder at me, allowing me to see his face for the first time.",
      "I felt a pang in my chest.",
      "He was beautiful, his long, straight nose and sharp cheekbones softened by long waves of silvery blond hair and lips shaped like a bow.",
      "His jaw was covered by a beard the same silver-blond color as his hair.",
      "He contemplated me a little sadly with eyes as pale as the noonday horizon.",
      "\"Ganymede?\" I gaped at him, my mouth opening and closing like a fish.",
      "\"What happened to her?\" I finally asked, not sure what else to do.",
      "He made an amused sound, though he was still watching me warily.",
      "\"Olympia?",
      "She was just a glamour.",
      "The lizard burned the magic away.\"",
      "I nodded, trying to get a grip.",
      "\"So, she never really existed then.",
      "All right.\"",
      "I eyed him, doing my best to keep my gaze from wandering any lower than his face.",
      "\"So if Olympia was a glamour, as you call it, then who are you?\" \"Can't you guess?\"",
      "\"You're Zeus?\"",
      "He smiled.",
      "\"I knew you were smart.\"",
      "\"Not very.\"",
      "I rose to my feet and glanced away from him.",
      "\"Can I go home now?\"",
      "\"Of course, if you want to.\"",
      "I turned away and walked out of the woods, my limbs stiff as an automaton's, my mind a jumble of incoherent words and images.",
      "I could feel his eyes on me, but I was too afraid to look back.",
      "Too afraid of my own emotions to let him see my face.",
      "I half expected him to follow me, but he didn't.",
      "I gathered up my flock and took them back to Troy, shooting nervous glances over my shoulder the whole trip back.",
      "It was too early to put to sheep back in their fold, but I found one of the servants to take over for me.",
      "That might have been irresponsible of me, but I had too much on my mind to bother with such things.",
      "I trudged through the byways of Troy, trying to come to terms with this new development.",
      "In the light of this new information, I reviewed my short acquaintance with the strange girl Olympia, a young woman who had shown up unexpectedly one day and forced her way into my life.",
      "Now I knew that the girl hadn't been a girl at all, but the king of the gods disguised as a woman.",
      "I recalled the unprecedented power of her eyes, the way they sucked me into her world and made me forget how to breathe.",
      "I blushed furiously when I recalled how she'd pushed me up against the back wall of the armory, her hands in my hair and her tongue trying to tease it's way past my lips.",
      "That had been a Zeus' tongue, a man's tongue and a man's lips and a man's body pressed up against mine.",
      "It was mortifying.",
      "It was arousing.",
      "I halted in the middle of an empty street and covered my face with my hands, cringing as I remembered my behavior.",
      "I'd been rude to Zeus.",
      "I'd pushed Zeus away.",
      "I'd chased Zeus through a meadow at the edge of the sea like he was an ordinary human being.",
      "I groaned, trying to escape the memory.",
      "What had he thought of me up there on the cliff, droning on about sailing away from Troy like some stupid actor in a tragedy?",
      "And why had he disguised himself as a woman?",
      "Why had he tricked me?",
      "I chewed my lip, refusing to believe that it had been in pursuit of me.",
      "Why would the king of the gods try to seduce me, a mortal, a boy, when he could have anybody he chose?",
      "It must have been some sort of mischievous joke.",
      "Maybe he'd figured out my secret and wanted to poke fun at me.",
      "Maybe the gods had made a wager to see if the homosexual prince of Troy could be convinced to bed a woman.",
      "I shook my head, so humiliated by the thought that I began to cry, tears trickling down between my fingers, adding to my shame.",
      "I couldn't make the tears stop so I ran and hid behind a rubbish heap where nobody could see me.",
      "I sank down behind the heap, curled my arms around my knees and cried, feeling more miserable than I ever had.",
      "I was so stupid and wretched that even the gods had begun to make sport of me.",
      "In that moment I truly began to hate myself, and I hated myself even more when I remembered how Zeus had looked after killing that serpent.",
      "He'd been the most extraordinary thing I'd ever seen, far lovelier than the Olympia glamour.",
      "If that person had pressed me up against a wall, I would have given him anything he wanted.",
      "I was certain that he'd seen my admiration.",
      "I could only wonder if he'd gone home and told the other gods about it yet.",
      "That possibility made me cry even harder.",
      "I stayed there for too long, sobbing like a little boy.",
      "At last I managed to compose myself enough to head for home.",
      "I hurried back to my father's house, trying to keep out of sight.",
      "When I did meet people I was careful to look away from them so that they wouldn't see my bloodshot eyes.",
      "I was almost home when I rounded a corner and nearly smacked into Isandros.",
      "He grinned at me for a moment before he noticed.",
      "I tried to turn away but I knew that he'd seen.",
      "\"Ganymede?\"",
      "\"Please excuse me,\" I muttered, trying to move past him.",
      "\"Ganymede, wait, what's the matter?\" I kept walking, but he reached out and caught me by the elbow.",
      "I stopped.",
      "I couldn't deny him anything.",
      "\"Are you all right?\"",
      "\"I'm fine,\" I said, keeping my face turned away from him.",
      "\"Did someone hurt you?\" I looked back at him.",
      "There was a dangerous glint in his eye.",
      "He's ready to defend me, I realized with a start.",
      "Warmth spread through my chest.",
      "I gave him a small smile.",
      "\"No. I'm fine.",
      "Really.\"",
      "And in that moment I was.",
      "He shook his head, not believing me.",
      "\"Tell me who did it.\"",
      "I considered.",
      "Should I tell him what had happened?",
      "Would he even believe me?",
      "I wasn't sure whether I believed it myself.",
      "\"Honestly?\" I said at last, \"I did it to myself.\"",
      "He narrowed his eyes.",
      "\"I don't believe you.\"",
      "\"No, it's true,\" I said.",
      "\"I was stupid.",
      "I pretty much walked right into it.\"",
      "\"Ganymede, what are you talking--\" \"Do you know what I am?\" I asked suddenly, before I could change my mind.",
      "\"What?\"",
      "\"Do you know what I am?\"",
      "\"You're... the prince.\"",
      "I took a step closer to him, my heart teetering between joy and terror.",
      "Even the gods knew about me.",
      "If the gods knew, surely everybody else did too.",
      "Maybe I'd been wrong all along.",
      "Maybe I'd been the blind one.",
      "Maybe this boy was just as good a liar as me.",
      "\"I like boys,\" I whispered.",
      "\"I like men the way other men like women.\"",
      "Whatever he'd been expecting me to say, it certainly hadn't been that.",
      "Isandros blinked at me, seeming uncertain what to do.",
      "\"Um, all right,\" he said.",
      "I scrutinized his expression, not knowing if he'd fully understood what I'd been trying to tell him.",
      "My sudden bout of courage was quickly slipping away, and I wanted to run and hide from him.",
      "Taking a deep breath, I forced myself onward.",
      "\"What I meant to say, Isandros, is that I...",
      "I like you the way other men like women.\"",
      "Isandros dropped his eyes from my face, staring at the ground.",
      "\"I see.\"",
      "My heart plummeted.",
      "I sucked in a ragged breath, my eyes filling with tears again.",
      "\"I'm sorry,\" I blubbered.",
      "\"I'm so sorry, Isandros.\"",
      "I fled from him, suddenly wanting to be anywhere but Troy.",
      "He didn't try to stop me.",
      "I ran outside the city walls, and into the wilderness beyond.",
      "I ran until my lungs felt like they would burst and then I stumbled to a walk, only to run again as soon I had energy enough.",
      "My feet carried me up hills and down nearly unseen forest paths.",
      "I didn't care where I went, I just couldn't be in that city anymore.",
      "I couldn't be near anybody who'd recognize me.",
      "I felt like such a fool.",
      "What had I been thinking, telling Isandros that?",
      "Had I gone mad?",
      "But even so, now I knew.",
      "There could be no more hope for us.",
      "He didn't love me back.",
      "I sobbed as I ran.",
      "This pain hurt a thousand times worse the Zeus' games.",
      "This was the kind of pain that drove men to fall on their swords to end it all.",
      "I kept running until the sun began to set and I was miles away from home.",
      "The hills became steep and rugged, but I kept on going, trying to outrun my fortune.",
      "At last I came to the top of a mountain, my legs trembling from exhaustion and my mouth parched.",
      "I sank down onto the ground and looked over the world.",
      "I could see Troy in the distance, a city of pale white stone shining like a beacon in the fading light.",
      "The sea was beyond it, a thin blue haze at the edge of the world.",
      "Dusk was descending over the east and the west burned with orange flame as the sun dipped beyond the horizon.",
      "I looked up at the sky, watching as the stars began twinkling into existence, wondering if I'd ever be able to get far enough away from this place.",
      "The sound of footsteps echoed beneath me.",
      "I glanced down the mountain, half expecting to see a bear lumbering up the slope.",
      "Instead there was a figure striding toward me, his pale hair catching the last few rays of sunlight.",
      "I made a face and slunk back away from the edge, hoping he wouldn't see me.",
      "\"I know you're there,\" he called.",
      "I sighed and didn't respond.",
      "I didn't know how much more I could handle today.",
      "I'd expected him to keep walking up the same path I'd taken, the one that wound up the side of the mountain, but then I heard a whooshing sound and suddenly Zeus was standing in front of me.",
      "Two huge wings were protruding from his back, casting me in shadow.",
      "He calmly folded thema behind him and they disappeared.",
      "He gazed at me, his expression serious.",
      "\"It took me a while to find you,\" he said.",
      "I didn't reply.",
      "He was wearing clothes now, a deep green chiton with a silver colored himation draped across his shoulders.",
      "His hair was woven into a braid with a few wisps coming loose and framing his face.",
      "A golden circlet rested on his forehead.",
      "\"What are you doing all the way out here?\"",
      "\"I needed to get away.\"",
      "He studied me, no doubt noticing my red, swollen eyes and tear stained cheeks.",
      "I glared back at him, wanting him to see what he'd done.",
      "Wanting him to know what he'd put me through.",
      "\"Oh, Ganymede,\" he murmured.",
      "I drew in a ragged breath.",
      "\"What do you want?\" I asked, shocked that I had the courage to confront him.",
      "\"What I've always wanted,\" he replied, walking toward me.",
      "He knelt in front of me and looked me full in the face, those piercing blue eyes unraveling my soul.",
      "He reached out and brushed his knuckles down the side of my face.",
      "My skin burned where he touched me.",
      "\"I don't want you here,\" I said, trying to ignore my body's reaction to him.",
      "\"I'm sorry for lying to you.\"",
      "I glared at him, wondering what sort of game he was playing now.",
      "\"Why did you?\"",
      "His lips tilted up in a shy smile.",
      "\"I figured you'd want a girl more than a man.\"",
      "My cheeks blazed.",
      "\"I don't believe you,\" I whispered.",
      "He narrowed his eyes.",
      "\"No? Why not?\"",
      "\"Because there's no reason for you to want me that way!",
      "You're the king of the gods.",
      "You're married to the most beautiful goddess in the world.",
      "You could bed anyone you want, any time you want.",
      "Why would somebody like that be interested in somebody like me?\"",
      "He appraised me, his head tilted to the side.",
      "\"What do you mean, somebody like you?",
      "Haven't you ever looked at yourself?",
      "Do you know who you are?",
      "You're a prince of Troy!",
      "And you're the most splendid creature I've ever seen.\"",
      "He caught my hand in his and pulled it toward him, playing with my fingers as he spoke.",
      "\"I told you before, remember?",
      "I haven't been able to sleep since I first saw you that day in the field.",
      "I had to find out who that beautiful boy was, sitting out there watching the sheep.",
      "I disguised myself as a laundress and searched through the town, hoping to find you.\"",
      "He glanced up at me from beneath his lashes, just like he had that first night I'd met him, disguised as Olympia.",
      "His eyes froze me in place, reducing my thoughts to a crawl.",
      "\"Wait,\" I said, trying to regain my power of speech.",
      "\"When did you see me with the sheep?\"",
      "The only time I'd seen Olympia out in the pasture was earlier that afternoon.",
      "Zeus grinned.",
      "\"How much do you know about me, Ganymede?\" I thought about it as he continued to fiddle with my hand.",
      "He linked his fingers between mine, gently pressed his thumb into the center of my palm, massaging it.",
      "He studied my fingernails, running the pad of his thumb across their edges.",
      "It was very distracting.",
      "\"Why are you doing that?\" I asked.",
      "He shrugged.",
      "\"You interest me.",
      "I want to know all of your secrets.\"",
      "My heart sped but I kept my voice neutral.",
      "\"And are my fingernails revealing anything to you?\" I asked drily.",
      "\"Mmm, a great many things actually.\"",
      "He glanced up at me.",
      "\"But you didn't answer my question.\"",
      "\"I don't know.",
      "I know all the basic things about you.",
      "The things the priest taught me.\"",
      "\"Like what?\"",
      "He only sounded half interested, his focus still on my hand in his lap.",
      "His left hand was skimming further up my arm, brushing over the blue veins in my wrist.",
      "\"Um, like that you're the king of the gods.\"",
      "\"The priest really knows his stuff, doesn't he?\" Zeus said.",
      "He was gently squeezing his hand around my arm then pulling it away, watching the white imprint fade as the blood rushed up under the skin.",
      "\"I know you're the god of the sky and that you bring thunderstorms.\"",
      "\"Very insightful.\"",
      "I blushed.",
      "\"All right, I know that you have five siblings, who I won't name, and I know you've fathered dozens of other gods and heroes who I also won't name.",
      "You have a temple at Knossos, married your older sister, and apparently have a fetish with hands.\"",
      "He turned to look at me.",
      "Without breaking eye contact, he brought my hand up to his face and sucked one of my fingers into his mouth.",
      "I gasped, instinctively trying to pull back.",
      "He tightened his grip around my wrist, not letting me go anywhere.",
      "He sucked my finger deeper into his mouth until the entire thing was inside.",
      "Zeus swirled his tongue around it, making me gasp again.",
      "It felt strange and disgusting and very good.",
      "He pulled back, releasing my finger with a plop sound.",
      "\"For your information,\" he said, as if nothing had happened.",
      "\"I married two of my older sisters.",
      "And two aunts.",
      "And one childhood friend.\"",
      "I was still reeling from the finger sucking.",
      "\"What else do you want me to tell you about yourself?\"",
      "He grinned at my reaction and sucked another finger into his mouth.",
      "It wasn't as shocking this time, but seemed even more erotic.",
      "I could only stare helplessly as he did it, his eyes never leaving mine.",
      "\"What is my emblem?\" he said, once he'd released me. \"Uh,\" I was having difficulty thinking.",
      "Zeus was kissing me, pressing his lips into the palm of my hand and moving downward, his lips barely brushing against the skin of my arm.",
      "It made my hair stand on end.",
      "\"Ganymede?",
      "What is it?\" he whispered, pausing to nibble at the sensitive skin near my inner elbow.",
      "\"It's, it's an eagle, isn't it?\" I answered.",
      "He was so close to me now, I couldn't take my eyes off of him.",
      "\"Mmm,\" he hummed into my skin.",
      "\"That's how I saw you.\"",
      "\"What?\"",
      "He'd reached the top of my shoulder.",
      "I could feel his beard brush over my skin, his lips ghosting over my collarbone.",
      "\"The first time I saw you.",
      "I was an eagle.\"",
      "He began kissing my neck and I forgot my own name.",
      "\"Oh,\" I whispered.",
      "I'd been answering him, but he took it as an invitation.",
      "He pushed me back, laying me down against the sandy ground.",
      "He hovered over me, doubling his efforts.",
      "He kissed me, hard, one hand on the side of my head, the other drifting down over my body before sliding up my inner thigh.",
      "I froze, pulling back from the kiss.",
      "This was too fast, we were going way too fast.",
      "He looked down at me, his pale eyes clouded with lust.",
      "It made my heart skip a beat and also made me afraid.",
      "He was a god.",
      "I couldn't say no to a god.",
      "\"Please,\" I pleaded.",
      "\"Please, stop.\"",
      "Zeus blinked at me, his face expressionless.",
      "For a moment I wasn't sure if he was going to listen to me.",
      "Then he rolled off and allowed me to sit up.",
      "\"I'm sorry,\" I mumbled, straightening my clothes.",
      "He was looking away from me.",
      "I bit my lip, afraid that I'd made him angry.",
      "Finally I heard him exhale loudly through his nose.",
      "He turned to face me, his expression apologetic.",
      "\"No. Forgive me.",
      "I got carried away.\"",
      "I blushed and looked down.",
      "\"It's all right.\"",
      "He reached out and stroked my cheek with the back of his knuckles.",
      "\"You were crying when I first arrived.",
      "Why?\" I turned my head away from him, ashamed of myself.",
      "Every time I was near Zeus, I seemed to forget that the rest of the world existed.",
      "Now my memories came flooding back.",
      "Isandros' rejection, Zeus' 'torment'.",
      "After what had just happened, I wasn't sure about the second one now, but the disappointment I felt about the other was still raw.",
      "I felt his fingers grip the edge of my chin and turn me back to face him.",
      "Those extraordinary eyes lifted the secrets out of me.",
      "\"He doesn't love me,\" I told him.",
      "\"Isandros doesn't love me.",
      "He never did.\"",
      "\"And you loved him?\" he asked, his eyes softening.",
      "I nodded, swallowing hard.",
      "Would he be angry about that?",
      "\"This Isandros is a fool, then.\"",
      "Zeus said, his hand keeping my face from turning away again.",
      "\"I'd give anything to be able to have your affection.\"",
      "I blushed crimson.",
      "\"You don't mean that.\"",
      "\"I do.\"",
      "I looked up at him, my eyes wandering over his lovely face.",
      "\"You know, you don't look the way I always imagined you would.\"",
      "He smirked.",
      "\"Disappointed?\"",
      "\"Not at all,\" I smiled.",
      "\"I always thought you'd look like an old man.\"",
      "\"Well, I look older than you do.\"",
      "It was true.",
      "Zeus was a man grown, not a boy like Isandros.",
      "It was a different, exciting kind of beauty.",
      "\"I don't mind,\" I said.",
      "We looked at each other for another long moment, neither of us speaking.",
      "The breeze blew my hair into my eyes and he reached up to smooth it back.",
      "\"You said earlier today that you wanted to get away from Troy,\" he said.",
      "\"Is that still true?\" I nodded.",
      "\"Now more than ever.\"",
      "I cringed to think about going back to that city and meeting Isandros.",
      "\"Then what would you say about coming home with me?\" \"Home?",
      "You mean, to Mount Olympus?\"",
      "He smiled, \"Would you like that?\" I couldn't believe my good luck.",
      "Then I realized something and my elation fell.",
      "Zeus noticed.",
      "\"What is it?\"",
      "\"How long would I be staying there?",
      "Only, only for a little while, right?",
      "Then I'll be sent back?\"",
      "\"Did I say that?\"",
      "He leaned forward and caught me in a kiss.",
      "Every thought I had fled, my entire world condensing to feeling his mouth on mine.",
      "After a moment he pulled away and laughed at my expression.",
      "\"You liked that, did you?\" he asked, running his thumb across my bottom lip.",
      "\"I liked it, too.",
      "When I asked you to come with me, I wasn't talking about just for tonight, I was talking about the foreseeable future.",
      "I want you to live with me.\"",
      "I bit my lip, unsure how I felt.",
      "I barely knew this man.",
      "I was attracted to him, but I didn't love him.",
      "Was I about to make the biggest mistake of my life?",
      "And yet, what was left for me in Troy?",
      "A future wife I couldn't love?",
      "Secret flings with young men behind her back?",
      "Seeing Isandros' face every day, knowing that I'd destroyed our friendship?",
      "I met Zeus' gaze, saw those crystal eyes looking back at me, and I suddenly knew what I was going to do.",
      "\"Take me away.\"",
      "There was a rap at the door.",
      "I slid off the bar stool and went to answer it, hoping it was Zeus' son with our coffee and not Zeus' wife with a baseball bat.",
      "Hate for it to be a repeat of last time.",
      "I opened the door a crack, waiting a moment before peeking around it just in case Hera tried anything.",
      "\"Delivery for one boy toy and his sugar daddy,\" a surly voice called from the other side of the door.",
      "I opened it further and took the coffee from Hermes, thanking him.",
      "\"What, no tip?\" he sneered.",
      "I smiled at him.",
      "\"Oh, sorry, almost forgot.\"",
      "I rummaged through my pocket, pretending to look for something.",
      "\"Here you go.\"",
      "I pulled my hand out, flipped him my middle finger and closed the door before he could react.",
      "\"Coffee?\"",
      "Zeus called from the bed, cracking one eye open.",
      "I smirked.",
      "\"Yup.",
      "Got your favorite.\"",
      "I placed it on the desk and hopped back up onto the stool.",
      "I was halfway through the first page of my story and didn't want to lose my momentum.",
      "I heard him slide out of bed and walk over, yawning.",
      "He picked up his sugar-loaded, poor-excuse-for-coffee and started sipping, his eyes on the screen.",
      "I squirmed to have it under his scrutiny, repressing the urge to cover the screen with my hands.",
      "It was the rough draft, nowhere near presentable.",
      "\"What'cha writin'?\" he asked.",
      "\"Smut?\" \"Sorry, no.\"",
      "\"You should write some smut.\"",
      "I snorted.",
      "\"Yes, really put my abilities to the test.\"",
      "\"Hey,\" he said.",
      "\"Smut writers are talented too.",
      "They're just misunderstood.\"",
      "\"Okay, Your Grace.\"",
      "I clicked out of the tab, knowing I'd never be able to come up with anything while he was standing there.",
      "I glanced up at him, seeing him watching me back, sucking up his iced latte through the straw.",
      "\"So,\" I said.",
      "\"Should I be expecting the Queen of Heaven to come knocking?\"",
      "He made a face.",
      "\"Not this time,\" he muttered.",
      "\"Well, hopefully not anyway.\"",
      "He swirled the straw around in his drink, shifting the ice cubes.",
      "\"Zeus, what happened?\" I recognized the look in his eyes.",
      "He looked vulnerable, flustered, so unlike his usual self.",
      "It worried me.",
      "He glanced up at me through his eyelashes, making my head spin just like it always had.",
      "He put his drink down and took a step toward me, the space between us vanishing.",
      "He took my face in his hands and kissed me, desperation marked in every movement.",
      "I knew this routine, knew it like the back of my hand.",
      "I kissed him back, my arms going around his middle, trying to comfort him as best as I could.",
      "He clung to me, kissing me like it was the only thing keeping him alive.",
      "\"Do you want to go to the bed?\" I whispered in a brief moment when my lips were free.",
      "\"Yes.\"",
      "The eagle soared high above the earth.",
      "I clung to Zeus, my arms wrapped around his neck, the cold wind whipping my hair back.",
      "The tops of my arms and legs were cold, but every part of me that was pressed against the eagle was warm, half buried in his soft feathers.",
      "My shepherd's cap had blown off a while ago and when I'd mentioned it, the eagle had screamed in glee.",
      "The earth was spread out beneath us like an over-sized map.",
      "At first I'd been afraid to look down, my face pressed into Zeus' neck, but once I realized that I wasn't about to die, I dared peek out at the world.",
      "My fear fell away, replaced by such joy I could barely stand it.",
      "Half the world was green and the other half blue.",
      "Zeus flew along the coast line, allowing me to see both sides.",
      "Trees and houses and people looked like ants from this height.",
      "I saw men and women walking around doing their evening chores, not noticing the giant eagle with the boy on his back.",
      "I laughed, my heart too full of happiness to contain it.",
      "Zeus glanced back at me, his eagle face unreadable.",
      "\"It's so beautiful,\" I shouted to him over the wind.",
      "His only response was a sudden swoop downward that made my stomach fly into my mouth.",
      "I clutched his neck so tightly I probably choked him.",
      "He spread his wings out again and leveled out, screeching when he saw my expression.",
      "I glared at him, suspicious that he was laughing.",
      "Troy flew by beneath us faster than I would have thought possible.",
      "I couldn't recognize any of the people from this height, but I was pretty sure a couple of them were pointing up at the eagle.",
      "I waved at them, giggling like a madman.",
      "Then the city was gone, vanishing behind us like it had never existed.",
      "We passed over other cities and towns and great fleets of ships.",
      "I wondered if Aristomache was on any of them.",
      "I felt sorry for her.",
      "Once she reached Troy there would be no prince for her to marry.",
      "The last of the sunlight bled out of the sky.",
      "I thought Zeus would have to stop for the night, but the eagle kept on.",
      "Soon it was too dark to see anything below me, but the stars were out.",
      "Snuggling down into Zeus' warm feathers, I watched his wing flap up and down, making the stars vanish and reappear with every stroke.",
      "I woke up in a bed that was not my own.",
      "I blinked a couple times, trying to figure out where I was.",
      "I remembered the eagle and the stars, but everything after that was nothing but shadows and incomplete thoughts.",
      "The room I was in was splendid.",
      "It was bright and airy, with gauze curtains strung between the pillars.",
      "I heard birds and the sound of rushing water.",
      "Something brushed down my arm, making me jump.",
      "I twisted around to see Zeus lying behind me, an arm pillowed under his head.",
      "\"'Morning, beautiful,\" he said.",
      "Smiling at him, I pushed myself up and looked around the room.",
      "The bed sat on a raised platform, looking out over everything.",
      "There were no walls, just pale marble pillars on all sides with gossamer sheets hanging between them.",
      "The floor was light-colored wood with colorful rugs scattered across it.",
      "The place was filled with priceless objects, ornate couches and beautiful carved tables.",
      "A harp sat in one corner and a table full of scrolls in another.",
      "I stepped out of the bed, glancing down at myself in surprise.",
      "I was only wearing my perizoma, the white undergarment still wrapped securely around my middle.",
      "I glanced over my shoulder as Zeus.",
      "\"Where are my clothes?\"",
      "He nodded toward the corner of the room.",
      "\"I put them over there.",
      "Figured you wouldnt want to sleep in them.\"",
      "I raised an eyebrow at him.",
      "\"Don't worry, I just undressed you.\"",
      "He smirked.",
      "\"I want you awake when I start doing other things.",
      "And I left this on,\" He reached over and caught the bottom edge of my perizoma, rubbing it between his fingers before I scooted away.",
      "He sighed dramatically.",
      "I laughed and moved away, walking across the room.",
      "I'd never seen anything so lavish.",
      "The furniture was all ivory and gold, the carpets crimson and woven into fantastic patterns.",
      "The ceiling was painted to look like a landscape as seen from a great height, just like I'd witnessed last night from the eagle's back.",
      "The sound of rushing water permeated the room as a waterfall cascaded off one side of the roof, creating a translucent wall--the only wall in the room.",
      "I could feel Zeus' eyes on me as I walked around, but I didn't look at him.",
      "I felt shy.",
      "Zeus had always been a little other-worldly, even in his Olympia disguise, but after riding through the sky on the back of an eagle and waking up on the mountain of the gods, I felt more than a little trepidation.",
      "I didn't know how to behave around somebody like him.",
      "\"Ganymede,\" he called from behind me.",
      "\"Come here.\"",
      "I had to obey, though I still couldn't look directly at him.",
      "He patted the coverlet beside him.",
      "I climbed up into the bed.",
      "\"You have a beautiful home, sir.\"",
      "I said, fixing my eyes on the coverlet.",
      "\"What's wrong?\" he asked.",
      "He caught my chin in his hand and made me look up at him.",
      "\"Are you unhappy?\" \"No!\"",
      "I blushed, hating myself for making him think I was ungrateful.",
      "\"No, it's not that at all, it's just... it's just a lot to take in.",
      "Really.\"",
      "He looked unconvinced.",
      "His hand moved from my chin to cup the side of my face, his fingers winding into my hair.",
      "\"I want you to be happy here,\" he said.",
      "I smiled a little.",
      "\"I am.",
      "Thank you, for what you did.",
      "Your Grace.\"",
      "He noticed how I tacked on the title.",
      "\"You've never called me that before.\"",
      "I blushed again.",
      "\"I should have.",
      "I haven't been very respectful to you.",
      "I'm sorry.\"",
      "He leaned toward me, unleashing the full force of his eyes.",
      "\"I didn't bring you here to be respectful.\"",
      "He kissed me, his hand curling around the back of my head, his tongue skimming along my lips.",
      "I parted them for him, moaning as his tongue stole into my mouth, entwining with my own.",
      "My arms wrapped around his neck and I rose up on my knees, pressing myself against his bare chest, embarrassment forgotten.",
      "He kissed me hungrily, his free hand finding my hip and tugging me closer.",
      "At last he drew back, both of us gasping for air.",
      "He studied me, his pupils dilated.",
      "He turned me, laying me back on the bed.",
      "I obeyed, the look in his eyes leaving me breathless.",
      "There was no doubt in my mind; I would not be leaving this room a virgin.",
      "The idea excited me and made me a little nervous.",
      "He hovered over me, pushing his hair behind his ear so he could see me better.",
      "His hand came up and touched my face before slowly trailing down my throat and over my chest, pausing at my nipple.",
      "He looked down at it, and brushed his thumb across it.",
      "I gasped, surprised at how sensitive it was.",
      "\"You were in love with another man,\" he murmured, not meeting my gaze.",
      "\"That's what you said.\"",
      "I blinked at him, surprised by the sudden turn of the conversation.",
      "\"Tell me,\" he said, grazing his thumb across the nipple again.",
      "\"How old was this man?\"",
      "He caught the sensitive skin between his fingers and rubbed his thumb in a circle.",
      "\"He, he was a year younger than me,\" I stammered, biting my lip as he continued toying with me.",
      "Zeus made a sound in the back of his throat.",
      "\"A boy, then.",
      "And you said he didn't love you back.",
      "Did he ever touch you?\" I felt a stab of pain when he talked about Isandros, but it vanished when Zeus leaned down and put his mouth where his hand had been.",
      "I whimpered, feeling his tongue flick over the nipple.",
      "I'd never even imagined anything like this.",
      "\"No,\" I answered.",
      "\"We never did anything like that.\"",
      "I moaned, arching my back, trying to give him more of me.",
      "He released me, rubbing his hand over my chest to wipe away the moisture.",
      "\"So you've never been touched?\" he asked, his nose drifting across the center of my chest before he latched onto my other nipple.",
      "\"N-no.\"",
      "I breathed, closing my eyes.",
      "\"You're the only one who's ever, ah, done anything like this.\"",
      "He groaned against my skin, grazing the sensitive nub with his teeth.",
      "He let me go, climbing up my body until we were eye to eye.",
      "His eyes were possessive as they looked down at me.",
      "My heart began to hammer.",
      "He leaned down suddenly, his mouth next to my ear.",
      "\"I'm glad for that,\" he whispered, his voice soft and seductive.",
      "\"I want to be the first one to fuck you, my little Trojan prince.\"",
      "I shuddered, and my breathing sped.",
      "\"Will it hurt?\" I asked, only half caring if it did.",
      "I'd been fantasizing about sex forever.",
      "To imagine that I was about to experience it was so surreal that I almost couldn't be afraid.",
      "Zeus turned back to me and smiled a little.",
      "\"Not too much, I don't think.",
      "Not when you're with me.\"",
      "I wasn't sure I believed him, but before I could reply he kissed me again, his lips barely brushing against mine.",
      "\"I'll be careful with you,\" he promised.",
      "I kissed him back, the kiss gradually increasing until our breathing became ragged, our mouths trying to possess each other.",
      "At last he broke away, burying his face in my neck, teasing the sensitive skin there.",
      "I sighed and tilted my head to allow him more access.",
      "He began sucking harder for a few seconds before abruptly pulling back, making a little pop sound as the suction broke.",
      "He smirked and touched my neck with his finger, like he had found something.",
      "Catching my look, he winked and leaned closer, pressing his lips to my ear again.",
      "\"Mine,\" he whispered, sending another chill up my spine.",
      "His body pushed mine into the mattress as he continued his journey down my body, touching and kissing me.",
      "Sometimes he'd pause at a certain area and examine it, just like he had the day before with my hand.",
      "Those moments frustrated me.",
      "I was more aroused than I'd ever been, my cock aching to release, and he chose now of all times to dawdle.",
      "\"What are you waiting for?\" I challenged him the third time this happened.",
      "He was lying on my legs, pinning them down with his stomach, his own legs lazily kicking back and forth in the air behind him, like a daydreaming child.",
      "He'd laid his head on my lower stomach and was watching his thumb as it stroked back and forth over my hip bone.",
      "His breathing ruffled the edge of my perizoma, making me desperate.",
      "He glanced up at me in surprise.",
      "\"What?\" I huffed, my arousal making me impolite.",
      "\"You said you were going to fuck me!",
      "Did you change your mind?\"",
      "A slow, evil grin spread across his features, his eyes turning to blue coals in his head.",
      "\"Does this bother you?\" he asked, slowly drumming his fingers on my hip.",
      "I groaned.",
      "\"Please,\" I whined, tossing my arms across my face.",
      "\"Please, I want you.\"",
      "He was there before the last word was out of my mouth, his hand pushing my arms out of the way, his eyes scorching me.",
      "I shrank away from his expression.",
      "\"I wouldn't do that, if I were you,\" he remarked, his voice flat.",
      "\"I wouldn't beg me for it.",
      "That might drive me over the edge, and then you'll be dreaming for this,\" he brushed the back of his hand down my ribcage, moving excruciatingly slow.",
      "His eyes never left mine.",
      "They left me addled.",
      "He smiled at me, showing just the edge of his teeth, reminding me of a knife blade.",
      "\"I know what I said earlier, about fucking you.",
      "I was lying.",
      "You don't want to be fucked today, my little prince.\"",
      "He kissed me softly.",
      "\"Someday you will.",
      "Someday you'll beg me for it, and I'll take you so hard that you won't be able to walk afterwards.",
      "But not today.\"",
      "He kissed me again.",
      "\"No more begging,\" he whispered against my lips.",
      "\"Today we go slow.\"",
      "\"Yes, sir,\" I murmured, my heart slamming into my ribs.",
      "He smiled, his good humor rushing back.",
      "\"You can call me by my name.\"",
      "\"Yes, sir.\"",
      "He laughed and went back to his anatomical study, stroking the tender skin on the inside of my hip like nothing had happened.",
      "I closed my eyes and tried to enjoy it, biting my lip to keep in my impatience.",
      "At last I felt his hand move dip into my perizoma.",
      "\"Oh, \" I breathed, adrenaline coursing through my veins.",
      "My cock was making an obvious tent in the white fabric and I blushed, a little embarrassed.",
      "I'd never felt comfortable being naked around other people, and I'd never been naked around a lover.",
      "I squirmed and twisted a strand of hair around my finger self-consciously.",
      "Zeus tugged the fabric back, exposing me.",
      "He helped me out of the undergarment before tossing in the corner with the rest of my clothes.",
      "His eyes wandered down my body, completely bare beneath him before he caught my eye.",
      "He smiled at me.",
      "\"You are the loveliest thing I've ever seen.\"",
      "I smiled back at him, relieved.",
      "He laid beside me, kissing me again, his hand wrapping around my manhood.",
      "My eyes rolled back in my head a little.",
      "He stroked me, his hand gripping me firmly and his thumb running over the tip with every pass.",
      "Moaning, I bucked into his hand, all traces of embarrassment forgotten.",
      "This seemed to excite him, and his pace quickened.",
      "\"Ganymede,\" he rasped, kissing my neck again.",
      "My hand skimmed down his torso and touched him through his own undergarment, making his groan.",
      "Emboldened, I stuck my hand inside and wrapped it around his cock, stroking the smooth skin.",
      "He swore and pushed down his perizoma, giving me better access.",
      "I turned my head and kissed him, the hand not stroking him winding in his hair.",
      "We were both on our sides, sharing hot, passionate kisses as we jerked each other off.",
      "The tips of our penises would occasionally brush against each other, and every time that happened I went hot all over.",
      "I tried positioning myself so that it would happen as often as possible.",
      "All too soon I felt my climax approaching, the experience of being touched like that too intense.",
      "\"Oh, you're, you're going to make me cum,\" I moaned, my head falling back as I felt it rising.",
      "Zeus immediately dropped his hand and all my hopes and dreams fell with it.",
      "I stared at him wildly, feeling utterly betrayed.",
      "He chuckled at my outraged expression and took my face in his hands, leaning our foreheads together.",
      "\"Not yet,\" he said, kissing the tip of my nose before pulling back.",
      "\"We've got so much more to do.\"",
      "I pouted, and had to stop myself from pleading with him again.",
      "My hand was still around his cock, though I'd stopped pumping when I'd been about to climax.",
      "A sudden, bold thought entered my mind and I acted on it before my courage failed me.",
      "I wriggled lower on the bed and slid his cock into my mouth, swirling my tongue around it experimentally.",
      "Zeus made a sound in the back of his throat that nearly undid me.",
      "I felt his hands in my hair, gently coaxing me to take more of him into my mouth.",
      "I did, bobbing my head up and down his heavy cock.",
      "I really didn't know what I was doing, but Zeus seemed to be enjoying himself.",
      "He whispered my name, his chest heaving and eyes slipping closed.",
      "Seeing him so aroused made me feel powerful.",
      "It was so obvious that he wanted me.",
      "Finally he pushed me away from him, a spiderweb of pre-cum and spit trailing from my lips, connecting me to him.",
      "I wiped my mouth with the back of my hand, glancing up at him in surprise.",
      "\"Did I do something wrong?\"",
      "He shook his head, his eyes wide and unfocused.",
      "\"I think we've had enough foreplay.",
      "I want to be inside you now.\"",
      "I nodded, excitement and nerves warring with each other.",
      "I rose up on my hands and knees beside him, waiting expectantly.",
      "Zeus propped himself up on his elbow and looked over at me.",
      "He reached over and touched my backside, trailing his fingers downward.",
      "I glanced over at him, wondering why he hesitated.",
      "\"Zeus?\"",
      "\"Lay on your back.",
      "I want to see your pretty face.\"",
      "I did as I was told, curious.",
      "Zeus grabbed several pillows and stacked them under my back and hips, raising up my bottom half.",
      "\"Comfortable?\" he asked.",
      "I nodded.",
      "\"Good.\"",
      "He slid off the bed and grabbed something off the table.",
      "It was a glass vial full of amber liquid.",
      "My heart skipped a beat when I saw it.",
      "\"Oil?\" I asked, trying to keep my voice steady.",
      "\"With a special ingredient,\" he replied, climbing back into the bed.",
      "\"Hopefully it'll make it hurt less.\"",
      "I chewed my lip, my stomach twisting in knots.",
      "He noticed my expression and leaned forward between my legs to kiss me. 'I'll be careful with you.\"",
      "he reassured me.",
      "\"I promise.\"",
      "I nodded my head, too nervous to say anything.",
      "Zeus unstoppered the vial and poured a little of the oil into his hand.",
      "\"Just try to relax, Ganymede.\"",
      "I took a deep breath and closed my eyes, trying to calm myself down.",
      "I wanted this.",
      "I felt his hands settle between my thighs, parting me.",
      "Something warm brushed over my entrance, sending a jolt of pleasure through me.",
      "His finger swirled around my anus, warm and slick with the oil.",
      "I opened my eyes a little.",
      "Zeus was kneeling between my legs, his hand hidden from view.",
      "He seemed completely absorbed in his task, his eyes watching his fingers.",
      "I melted under those fingers, my muscles turning to jelly.",
      "\"That feels nice,\" I said.",
      "\"Good.",
      "I'm going to do a little more now.\"",
      "The finger poked at my entrance, struggling against the resistance there.",
      "It slid up inside me, filling me up.",
      "I sighed.",
      "\"Does that hurt?\"",
      "I shook my head.",
      "It was a strange sensation, but not a bad one.",
      "I felt a little more pressure and then another finger moved to join the first, stretching me.",
      "This felt a little more invasive, but nothing like the pain I'd been expecting.",
      "The fingers slid in and out of me, very slowly at first and then a little faster, feeling me relax around them.",
      "Zeus trickled a little more oil over them as he went, getting me all slick inside.",
      "After a minute or so, I felt him add a third finger.",
      "The pressure built, but not the pain.",
      "After the initial shock, I was starting to enjoy being so full.",
      "\"How are you doing?\" he asked me.",
      "He was watching me now, scrutinizing my expression.",
      "I smiled, trying to reassure him.",
      "\"I want you,\" I answered.",
      "It was so true.",
      "Zeus' fingers felt good, but they only teased me.",
      "I wanted more.",
      "Zeus was quick to comply.",
      "He took his fingers out and slickened his manhood with the oil before moving to settle over me.",
      "He guided his cock into my entrance, going painfully slow.",
      "He was bigger around than his fingers had been, and he went gently, allowing me a chance to adjust.",
      "I felt him glide into me, and it was almost more than I could stand.",
      "I whimpered his name, tossing my head back.",
      "This was like a dream.",
      "The sexiest dream I'd ever had.",
      "\"Ganymede?\"",
      "\"You feel so good,\" I moaned.",
      "I heard him chuckle.",
      "\"So do you,\" he breathed, sounding short of breath.",
      "\"You are the most fuckable thing alive.\"",
      "He pushed deeper into me, and kept going until he was completely sheathed.",
      "I laid there, gasping, my body spasming around the invasion of his.",
      "It hadn't hurt at all, but the pressure was driving me to distraction.",
      "Zeus began rolling his hips, slowly thrusting inside of me.",
      "I watched him, admiring the fine lines of his body as he moved in and out of me, my mind delirious with lust.",
      "His locked his eyes with mine and he started thrusting a little faster, making me moan.",
      "\"You like that?\" I could only nod, lost in sensation.",
      "He had to pause every once in a while to trickle more oil along his cock, and those moments were the most desperate of my life, followed by the sweetest when he'd sheath himself in me once again.",
      "We continued like that for several minutes, his movements gradually increasing in speed and me lying prone beneath him, feeling all the happiness in the world.",
      "\"You look like you're enjoying yourself,\" he observed.",
      "I smiled up at him.",
      "\"This is the best day of my life.\"",
      "He grinned, \"It's about to get better.\"",
      "Before I could ask him what he meant, he adjusted the angle of his strokes, leaning a little back on his knees so that his downstroke would brush against something inside me that softened my bones.",
      "I yelped in surprise, my back arching off the bed and my cock going rigid.",
      "Zeus found that place again and again, each time sending a bolt of pleasure through me that was almost beyond all comprehension.",
      "My moans grew louder, becoming almost frantic as he rubbed up against that hidden spot with every stroke.",
      "\"You sound like a whore,\" he growled.",
      "The words were an insult but the tone was not.",
      "\"Do you like it?\" I asked, gazing up at him under my eyelashes.",
      "I angled myself upwards, allowing him deeper access.",
      "He groaned.",
      "\"Very much.\"",
      "His skin was shiny with sweat, his eyes bright.",
      "He reached up and caught my cock in his hand, fondling the tip.",
      "\"Ah,\" I said, tilting my head back, my mind going blank, just letting my body feel.",
      "I felt his thick cock prodding against my center, releasing wave after wave of indescribable pleasure.",
      "I'd never felt anything like it, not even with his hand around me.",
      "The tempo of his thrusts increased again, almost getting rough.",
      "It still didn't hurt, but I felt the force of it.",
      "The knowledge that he was enjoying taking his pleasure of me added fuel to my own ecstacy.",
      "The wave of pleasure building inside me grew higher, threatening to crash over me at any moment.",
      "I yearned for it, my breathing ragged and my voice growing hoarse from all racket I was making.",
      "He was right, I did sound like a whore.",
      "And I didn't care one bit.",
      "\"Ah, fuck, you feel so good,\" Zeus growled, grabbing my hips to steady himself as his thrusts became erratic.",
      "Oddly enough, it was his cursing that sent me over the edge, the husky sound of his voice adding that last tiny bit of stimulation I needed to come flying apart.",
      "\"Ah!",
      "Ahhaha, yes!",
      "Oh Zeus!\"",
      "I jerked under him, my hips straining upwards as creamy, white ejaculate splattered across my stomach, wave after crashing wave of pleasure washing over my entire body.",
      "This wasn't an orgasm.",
      "This was dying and going to Elysium.",
      "Seeing me finish sped Zeus' own climax and within moments he was pulling out of me and spilling himself across my stomach, his seed mixing with my own.",
      "He groaned, his hand squeezing out the last of it before he collapsed next to me, panting.",
      "We both lay there, arms stretched out and breathing fast, too spent to move.",
      "My ears were ringing and the sea of cum all over me was turning cold.",
      "\"Well,\" I said at last.",
      "\"That was amazing.\"",
      "\"Yes, it was.\"",
      "Zeus was lying on his stomach, his arms raised above his head.",
      "He opened his eye to look at me over the top of his arm.",
      "\"You look good covered in cum,\" he said.",
      "I blushed furiously.",
      "\"I need a rag or something.\"",
      "He glanced around, picked up his perizoma, and handed it to me.",
      "I eyed the garment warily, the notion of cleaning off with someone else's used underclothes not very comforting.",
      "Zeus smirked when he noticed my reaction.",
      "\"You know, if you're that concerned about my personal cleanliness, you really shouldn't have let me stick my dick up your ass.\"",
      "It was hard to argue with that logic.",
      "I took the garment and started wiping off globs of semen.",
      "Zeus watched me as I did this.",
      "\"How are you feeling?\" he asked.",
      "\"Fantastic,\" I answered.",
      "\"Did it hurt much?\"",
      "I shook my head.",
      "\"No, not at all.",
      "It was strange, I'd expected it to hurt a lot.\"",
      "\"It usually does.",
      "I put some nectar in the oil, to see if it would help you any.",
      "I didn't know if it would work or not, but it helps with other kinds of pain so I figured it'd be worth a shot.",
      "You might feel sore later on, once the effects wear off.\"",
      "I glanced up at him and smiled.",
      "\"That was very kind of you.\"",
      "He shrugged off my gratitude.",
      "\"I want you to be happy here.",
      "I went a little faster than I planned to, at the end.",
      "I hope I didn't make you uncomfortable.\"",
      "I assured him that he hadn't.",
      "\"I've never felt so good in my life,\" I said, propping myself up on my elbow to look at him.",
      "I raised a hand to brush back some of his hair that had fallen forward.",
      "\"That was incredible.\"",
      "He caught my hand and kissed my palm.",
      "\"You said you'd never been with anyone, but I almost wonder, have you ever actually peaked before?\"",
      "\"Yes,\" I said, curious as to where the question arose from.",
      "\"I mean, I've touched myself plenty of times.\"",
      "He grinned.",
      "\"I'm going to have to see that someday,\" he murmured.",
      "\"But the reason I asked is because of your reaction when I made you come just now.",
      "You looked starstruck, like it was the first time you ever had an orgasm.\"",
      "\"Well,\" I muttered.",
      "\"I've never experienced something like that before.",
      "I've never even come close to anything like that.\"",
      "\"Interesting.\"",
      "He turned over, winding his arms behind his head.",
      "I wiggled nearer to him, wanting to be pressed up against him, but not sure if he'd appreciate me invading his space.",
      "Luckily, he noticed what I was doing and pulled me close, his arm wrapping around my back.",
      "I sighed and snuggled into the crook of his arm, my head on his chest.",
      "His chest was dusted with fair hair, tapering into a line that trailed down his stomach and eventually fanned out again, making a nest of light colored curls between his legs.",
      "Like his chest, Zeus' arms and legs were also hairier than my own, making him look very manly.",
      "I liked it.",
      "His heart was beating under my ear.",
      "Hearing it surprised me, though it shouldn't have.",
      "It made sense that Zeus would have a heartbeat--he was alive wasn't he?--but it seemed almost odd that a god could have something so ordinary.",
      "My eyes grew heavy and I was beginning to nod off when he spoke again.",
      "\"We're going to have to be careful, my little prince.\"",
      "I stirred against him, trying to shake off my stupor.",
      "\"What?\"",
      "Zeus glanced over at me, his pale eyes conflicted.",
      "\"I'm going to make you my cupbearer.",
      "That will be your official role here.",
      "It'll be our excuse.\"",
      "I raised an eyebrow, not following him.",
      "\"What do you mean, our excuse?\" Zeus sighed.",
      "\"You mentioned it yourself yesterday evening.",
      "I'm married.",
      "And Hera isn't the most understanding person.\"",
      "I bit my lip, feeling stupid.",
      "I had known he was married, but in the whirlwind of emotion that this man stirred up in me, I'd barely even thought about it.",
      "\"What will she do?\" I whispered.",
      "He clenched me tighter, leaning his forehead against mine.",
      "\"Oh, sweetling, you don't need to be frightened.",
      "I'm not going to let her hurt you.",
      "We just need to be careful.\"",
      "\"But how?",
      "Do you really think she won't suspect us of this?\" I gestured at the two of us.",
      "\"She probably already knows I'm in here.\"",
      "Zeus chuckled, his tone humorless.",
      "\"Oh, trust me, if she knew you were in here, we'd both be in a world of pain.\"",
      "He pulled my face back to his when I tried to turn away.",
      "\"Ganymede, I'm not going to let her hurt you.",
      "I promise.\"",
      "I bit my lip harder, wanting to believe him, but not sure I could.",
      "I'd heard stories about what Hera did to her husband's lovers.",
      "I'd been beyond stupid to come here.",
      "Then I looked into those pale blue eyes and felt the rest of the world fall away, just like always.",
      "I could never have said no to those eyes, nor the god they belonged to.",
      "With a sinking feeling, I realized I'd been lost the moment I'd seen him standing in the forest after he'd struck down the serpent.",
      "The memory of the serpent brought something to my mind and I groaned.",
      "\"Ganymede?\"",
      "\"The giant snake you killed.",
      "Your wife sent it after us, didn't she?\"",
      "Now it was Zeus' turn to look away.",
      "I sighed, resigning myself.",
      "\"I'll be your cupbearer, then, if that's what you think is best.\"",
      "\"She's got no reason to hurt my cupbearer, now does she?",
      "And for all she knows, that's all I ever wanted you for.\"",
      "His tone was a little desperate, his story thin as a spider's web.",
      "But it was still more than I could come up with.",
      "\"And there's one more thing, something to protect you.\"",
      "Zeus disentangled himself from me and slid out of the bed.",
      "I watched as he walked across the room and picked up a little dish off a table.",
      "There was something on the dish that resembled a small cake, small enough to fit in the palm of my hand and the color of honey.",
      "\"What is it?\" I asked.",
      "\"Ambrosia.",
      "If you eat it, you'll be immortal.",
      "Never aging, never dying.\"",
      "I stared at him, completely dumbfounded.",
      "\"You aren't serious?\"",
      "He nodded.",
      "\"I told you, I want you to be with me.\"",
      "He pushed the tray toward me.",
      "\"Eat it.\"",
      "I looked down at the tiny cake, my mind numb.",
      "I felt like I should take some time to decide.",
      "But why?",
      "When somebody offered you immortality, who would be stupid enough to refuse?",
      "Yet I hesitated.",
      "This was the most monumental moment of my entire life, and I'd had no time to prepare.",
      "I glanced up at Zeus, looking at his lovely face.",
      "He was watching me expectantly, his hair disheveled from our romp, his eyes stunningly blue and endless.",
      "I imagined leaving him and returning to my father's house, and cringed away from the thought.",
      "How could I ever go back to the way things had been?",
      "It was impossible.",
      "Therefore, I would be staying here.",
      "And if I was staying here with Zeus, shouldn't I actually be able to stay?",
      "If I remained mortal, death would eventually take me away from here, if I wasn't cast out for being old and ugly beforehand.",
      "No, the answer was simple and I was just delaying the inevitable.",
      "I picked up the little golden cake and popped the entire thing into my mouth.",
      "It was delicious.",
      "The taste was unlike anything I could ever imagine.",
      "It was sweet, it was rich and it seemed to carry with it every beautiful feeling in the world.",
      "The cake made me happy with a joy that made every particle of my body glow from within.",
      "I laughed, the joy bubbling up out of me like a fountain.",
      "Zeus smiled and bent forward to kiss me, his hands winding in my hair.",
      "I kissed him back, all of my energy returning ten fold.",
      "I was so happy I wanted to yell from the rooftops and dance through the streets and make love to him again and again.",
      "The world was bright and beautiful and I was beautiful too.",
      "I wrestled the king of the gods back down into the sheets, kissing his throat and grinding against him, ready for another round.",
      "He laughed and let me caress him, his eyes never leaving me.",
      "\"Congratulations,\" he said after a while, gasping when my mouth slipped around his awakening arousal.",
      "\"Welcome to immortality, my prince.\"",
      "We fell into the bed, Zeus never allowing me more than an arm's reach away from him.",
      "I started out underneath him, one hand in his hair, the other gripping the small of his back, my own need rising to meet his.",
      "He wiggled out of my grasp and moved lower, unfastening my jeans.",
      "As soon as enough fabric was out of his way, my cock was in his mouth, his hand pumping the stem while his mouth sucked at the top, his tongue twirling around the slit.",
      "I whimpered, pressing the heels of my hands against my eyes.",
      "He kept at it for another couple minutes, pausing only when I was good and hard.",
      "I pushed myself into a sitting position, kicking off my jeans and boxers.",
      "He helped me out of my shirt.",
      "I fell back into pillows and spread my legs for him, knowing that he doesn't care for much foreplay when he's in this kind of mood.",
      "He paused, looking at me from the end of the bed with a strange expression.",
      "I tilted my head to the side, evaluating him.",
      "Seeing my look, he glanced away, his mouth twisting.",
      "I pushed myself upright again and crawled toward him on my hands and knees, turning his face back to me.",
      "\"Are you all right?\" I asked.",
      "He smiled a little, but it didn't touch his eyes.",
      "That same vulnerable look was in them again, like he was pleading with me but couldn't find the right words to say.",
      "At last he just shook his head and said that he was fine.",
      "I wasn't convinced.",
      "Cupping his face in my hand, I leaned forward and kissed him softly, carefully.",
      "I felt him kiss me back, his arms encircling my waist, his hands skimming over my back.",
      "I kept the pace slow, deliciously slow, our breathing turning ragged.",
      "My fingers stroked his hair, touched his face, brushed over his bare shoulders.",
      "He was just wearing a pair of loose pajama bottoms that I couldn't wait to get off him.",
      "I breathed his name against his lips, trying to persuade him to open up.",
      "\"I--\" he said, when I moved lower to kiss his throat.",
      "\"Could we--I mean, could you...\" He huffed in frustration.",
      "\"Forget it.\"",
      "I looked back at him, taking in his torn expression before kissing him again.",
      "\"Could I what?\" I asked, catching his bottom lip between my teeth.",
      "He sighed.",
      "\"Ganymede, I...I want you today,\" he brushed some invisible dirt off my collarbone, not looking me directly in the eye.",
      "\"You know, like we did that time in Paris?\" I raised an eyebrow but quickly rearranged my expression, not wanting to make him more embarrassed than he already was.",
      "\"Of course,\" I said, bringing his face up so that he was looking at me again.",
      "\"You know that we can do that whenever you want.\"",
      "\"I know,\" he said and I was sure I saw him blush.",
      "I smiled and kissed him, my tongue stealing into his mouth and touching his own, making him sigh and lean further into the kiss.",
      "I turned him so that we could both lay out on the bed.",
      "\"How do you want to do it?\" I asked.",
      "He smirked, his eyes starting to regain some of their fire.",
      "\"You're the one in charge, remember?\" I laughed.",
      "\"That's not really how it works, but alright.",
      "Turn on your side, facing the window.\"",
      "He obeyed, watching me out of the corner of his eye.",
      "I curled up behind him, reaching around his waist and touching him, running my hands down his chest, over his flat belly and finally catching the edge of his waistband with my finger.",
      "I pushed it down and helped pull off his pants.",
      "Zeus kicked them onto the floor.",
      "Going back behind him, I reached out and slowly ran my hand down over his cock, feeling it jump against my hand.",
      "I went further down, cupping his balls and running my thumb over them, before going even further, pausing at his perineum and rubbing my fingers in a slow circle.",
      "He groaned when I picked up the pace.",
      "Using my other hand, I began massaging his cock, loving the sounds he made as my fingers worked him.",
      "Soon his breathing became labored and I pulled my hands away, not wanting him to get too worked up.",
      "He made a disgruntled noise when I stopped, but I just tsked him.",
      "\"I'm in charge, remember?\" I teased, reaching behind me.",
      "\"Whatever.\"",
      "I laughed.",
      "I found what I was looking for, the bottle of lube hidden between the mattress and the wall.",
      "I shook the bottle and poured a little into my hand.",
      "\"Do you want to use some nectar?\" I asked.",
      "He shook his head, not looking at me.",
      "I winced.",
      "We didn't do this very often and every time--even the first--Zeus had refused to use the nectar, choosing instead to feel the discomfort of anal sex.",
      "I'd often wondered why.",
      "Zeus said he didn't mind the pain, that it felt good.",
      "I didn't understand it.",
      "Pain and I weren't friends and we definitely weren't lovers.",
      "I'd used nectar every time he'd gone into me, but that was me.",
      "Zeus could like whatever he wanted.",
      "I'd been Zeus' lover for three hundred years before I'd first gone into him.",
      "In those days it was still considered indecent for an influential man to be penetrated.",
      "Men like Zeus were supposed to be powerful, the dominators, the conquerors.",
      "I'd never thought much of the rule, but it had taken centuries for Zeus to give it up.",
      "It was still in the back of his mind to this day, which is one of the reasons why we had only done this a few times since we'd been together, and most of those had been in the last couple of centuries.",
      "There had been an especially spectacular evening in Paris about fifty years ago that he always referred to whenever he wanted to try it again.",
      "I spread the lube over my fingers and dipped them down against his entrance.",
      "He let out a sound that sent a shiver of anticipation down my spine.",
      "I slipped a finger into him, feeling the soft walls clenching around me.",
      "I wiggled my finger and he moaned.",
      "\"Does that feel okay?\" I asked, kissing his side.",
      "\"Yeah,\" he gasped.",
      "\"Yeah it does.\"",
      "\"Good,\" I slid another finger in and then another, slowly pumping them in and out of him.",
      "\"You feel really tight,\" I said, grinning up at him.",
      "He laughed a little, making his muscles quiver around my fingers.",
      "\"You sound like a teenager the first time he sticks a finger up his virgin girlfriend.\"",
      "\"Well, I wouldn't know much about that.\"",
      "\"You would if you read more smut.\"",
      "I rolled my eyes and leaned close to him.",
      "From this position my head came about halfway down Zeus' spine, my hand reaching lower, getting him ready for me.",
      "I left little airy kisses all up and down his side, from his rib cage to his hip bone.",
      "He was ticklish around his belly which usually amused me to no end but I didn't want him to twist around too much in our current position so I avoided those spots.",
      "My fingers kept pumping in and out of him, spreading the lube around and getting him nice and relaxed.",
      "I saw him wrap his hand around himself, slowly moving it in time with my fingers.",
      "I watched him through half closed eyes, feeling my own erection jerk to life.",
      "I tried to be patient with my preparations but watching him touch himself was not helping my resolve.",
      "\"Gan,\" he breathed, looking back at me, his eyes grown cloudy with desire.",
      "I didn't need to be told twice.",
      "I grabbed the lube and spread some over my cock before positioning myself behind him.",
      "I had to use my hand to guide myself into him.",
      "Zeus never had to do that anymore, but I didn't have nearly as much experience with this.",
      "I pressed myself against him, marveling at just how small the entrance was.",
      "The first time we did this, it had taken me forever to even get inside him.",
      "Small wonder we hadn't done it again for another couple centuries.",
      "Now I wiggled the tip a little, just barely putting it inside.",
      "Zeus gasped quietly.",
      "I pushed forward with my hips, easing my way into him at a snail's pace.",
      "Once, he made a tiny pained sound and I saw him grab a fistful of the sheets.",
      "I immediately pulled back.",
      "\"Babe, we can use some of the nectar.\"",
      "He shook his head, letting out his breath through his nose.",
      "\"I'm fine.",
      "Just give me a second, please.\"",
      "I did, wrapping my arm around his waist and kissing along the back of his shoulders.",
      "I felt terrible for causing him pain and even worse for my own impatience.",
      "I was so aroused.",
      "It was all I could do not to shove the rest of my cock up into him and feel his walls squeezing around me.",
      "Zeus finally gave the go-ahead and I slid a little farther into him, my eyes rolling back from the sensation.",
      "At last I was completely inside.",
      "Zeus moaned and leaned his head back, feeling me fill him up.",
      "My initial thrusts started out excruciatingly slow and gradually became a little faster, my breathing uneven.",
      "He was tight around me, tighter than anything I'd ever felt, all heat and friction and slick lube.",
      "\"You feel so good,\" I huffed, doing my best to keep my control.",
      "Zeus was breathing heavily, his eyes closed and lips parted.",
      "I tried to adjust the angle of my thrusts, attempting to hit his prostate, the bundle of nerves that had the power to make a man come unglued.",
      "After a few more thrusts I got it.",
      "I felt a shudder ripple through him and he let out a little whine.",
      "\"Oh my God,\" he said, moaning when I hit the spot again.",
      "His response made me go a little wild and I thrust into him again and again, loving the sound of his voice.",
      "My arms were wrapped tightly around his waist, my forehead against the back of his shoulder.",
      "\"Oh, God that feels so good,\" he gasped.",
      "\"Hell yeah it does,\" I said through gritted teeth, \"I want you to cum for me.\"",
      "I slid my hand up and started playing with his nipple, my erection brushing up against his g-spot again.",
      "My own orgasm was slowly building and I wanted to make sure that he found his release before I did.",
      "Zeus shivered, his erection curled up over his stomach.",
      "I leaned up on my elbow so I could see his face better.",
      "He looked up at me, his beautiful eyes delirious.",
      "He brought my face down so we could kiss, both of us moaning with every thrust.",
      "\"I love you,\" he whispered against my lips, squeezing his eyes shut when I thrust into him again.",
      "\"Oh, don't stop,\" he said.",
      "\"Whatever you do, don't stop.\"",
      "\"I love you, too\" I said, shoving myself into him, \"Oh, Baby I love you so much.\"",
      "I bent and started attacking his neck, sucking on the skin under his jaw.",
      "He gasped and leaned up into it.",
      "It wasn't much longer before his moans became louder, and he began moving into my thrusts.",
      "\"Gan, Baby, I'm gonna, I'm gonna...\" He cried out, his body shuddering as he came.",
      "I felt his walls grip me even harder, making me groan.",
      "My pace quickened, his ecstasy fueling my own desire.",
      "Zeus gasped for air, his skin dewy with sweat.",
      "He went limp in my arms.",
      "\"You are so beautiful,\" I whispered against his skin.",
      "I breathed in the scent of him, a heady mix of sweat and sex and rain.",
      "\"I want you to finish inside me,\" he said.",
      "\"Oh,\" I breathed.",
      "My hips bucked against him, my climax surging up within me.",
      "\"Oh, here it comes,\" I said, gripping him as pleasure exploded through me.",
      "We both moaned as I came, my semen spilling inside him.",
      "I spasmed for several seconds before collapsing against him, both of us breathing heavily.",
      "I eased my way out.",
      "He rolled over to look at me.",
      "\"That was nice,\" he murmured.",
      "\"Yeah it was,\" I agreed, grinning at him.",
      "\"Don't get too comfortable though.",
      "If you're thinking about becoming the bottom of this relationship you're going to have to fight me for it.\"",
      "He smirked.",
      "\"I don't think you have to worry about that.\"",
      "He reached over and caught a strand of my hair and twirled it around his fingers.",
      "\"Sometimes it's just nice to let someone else be in control,\" he said.",
      "I pushed myself up on my elbows.",
      "\"Do you wanna talk about it now?\"",
      "He sighed, dropping his hand.",
      "\"Not much to talk about really.\"",
      "\"Hera?\"",
      "He made a face.",
      "\"It was just the usual stuff, how I'm a terrible husband and a terrible father and a terrible person.",
      "It just gets old after awhile.\"",
      "I sat up and picked up his hand, kissing it.",
      "\"I don't think you're a terrible person.\"",
      "\"Then you're an idiot.\"",
      "I glanced at him, surprised.",
      "He grimaced and apologized.",
      "\"But you can't honestly say that I'm a good person.",
      "Or father or husband.\"",
      "\"I can say whatever I want,\" I declared.",
      "\"But I do know that you're a much better father than you used to be.",
      "And you were always kind to me.",
      "A truly awful person wouldn't be nice to anybody.\"",
      "He laughed a little.",
      "\"What did I do to deserve you?\" he asked.",
      "\"You let a snake burn up your clothes,\" I said with a smirk.",
      "\"I think you did it on purpose too.",
      "There was no way I was going to let you get away from me once I saw this body.\"",
      "I ran my hand down his stomach, making him twist away.",
      "I raised an eyebrow.",
      "\"Don't,\" he warned, narrowing his eyes.",
      "I grinned and attacked him, tickling his sides until he howled, thrashing in the bed.",
      "\"Dammit, Ganymede!",
      "Get off!\"",
      "I let him go, still laughing, pushing the hair back out of my eyes.",
      "\"You know, I was thinking about that earlier, about how I met you, I mean.\"",
      "\"Yeah?",
      "And how sexy I was?\" I rolled my eyes.",
      "\"If you do say so yourself.\"",
      "I laid back down, my arms stretched out.",
      "He leaned back against me, his head on my shoulder.",
      "I smiled, pleased by his reaction.",
      "I kissed his hair and tugged him closer to me.",
      "\"Actually, I was thinking more along the lines of how different we both are around each other now.\"",
      "He snorted.",
      "\"You had the self-esteem of a kicked puppy.\"",
      "\"I was pretty pitiful, wasn't I?\" Zeus propped himself up to look at me.",
      "\"No.",
      "You were perfect.",
      "It just took you forever to realize it.\"",
      "He brushed his thumb over my cheek.",
      "\"I like the new you.",
      "The one who knows you're amazing.\"",
      "I smiled.",
      "\"I am pretty awesome.\"",
      "He laughed.",
      "I loved his laugh.",
      "It was deep and loud and contagious.",
      "\"You are.",
      "And you're dead sexy.\"",
      "I was about to answer when a voice called from the doorway: \"So this is where you've been hiding.\"",
      "I fidgeted with the edge of my himation, slowly shifting my weight from foot to foot.",
      "The women stared at each other across the small table.",
      "The frosty morning air was thick with tension, making my hair stand on end and a shiver run down my spine.",
      "Finally, the woman on the right reached out and slid the round game-piece across the table, knocking her opponent's square token out the of the circle.",
      "Her opponent groaned.",
      "\"Why can't you ever let me win?\"",
      "Hera grumbled, leaning back in her chair.",
      "She tapped the rim of her cup and I hurried to refill it.",
      "Athena laughed.",
      "\"You'd be even angrier if I did.\"",
      "\"True.",
      "But can't you at least have an off game?",
      "Must you always be so perfect?\"",
      "\"Maybe we can play something else next time.\"",
      "\"No,\" replied Hera.",
      "\"I will continue this until I master it.\"",
      "\"As you wish.\"",
      "Athena glanced up at me.",
      "\"And how are you today, Ganymede?\" I squirmed.",
      "I hated being noticed by the deities, much preferring to stand in the corner until someone wanted more wine.",
      "\"I am well, my lady,\" I murmured.",
      "\"Speak up, Ganymede,\" Hera snapped.",
      "\"Nobody can hear you.\"",
      "\"Are you adjusting to life here, then?\" Athena asked, ignoring the other's outburst.",
      "\"I'm sure it's a lot to get used to.\"",
      "I smiled a little.",
      "I liked Athena.",
      "She was a witty, generous sort of person.",
      "\"It is, my lady, but I am happy to be here.\"",
      "\"He is doing quite well,\" Hera said, her voice echoing inside her cup as she lifted it to her lips.",
      "I couldn't help but look at her profile as she did so.",
      "Hera's face made me feel totally inadequate.",
      "Everyone was beautiful on Mount Olympus, from Zeus to the lowliest dryad.",
      "And Hera was lovelier than anybody.",
      "She was small and soft, with a delicate face and a perfect little nose and skin fair as fresh cream.",
      "Her dark hair was curled and braided into an elaborate up-do that made her seem taller than she was.",
      "Her eyes were large and dark and her voice was surprisingly low-pitched for such a tiny person, booming out of her with the force of a tidal wave.",
      "\"Well we are glad to have you,\" Athena said, standing to leave.",
      "\"Have a good day, Your Highness.\"",
      "Hera waved her away, not bothering to look at her.",
      "\"We'll resume this tomorrow.\"",
      "\"As you say.\"",
      "She left, leaving me alone with the Queen of Heaven.",
      "Hera reclined in her chair, slowly swirling the wine in her cup.",
      "Silence fell so thick that when one of her peacocks crowed I nearly leapt out of my skin.",
      "\"So,\" she said at last, still staring into her cup.",
      "\"You're his new toy.\"",
      "Nausea rolled over me.",
      "I wasn't sure how to answer, and paused so long that she seemed to think that I wasn't going to.",
      "\"No denying it?\" she wondered.",
      "\"No desperate denouncement of your trysts?\"",
      "\"I am my king's humble servant, Your Grace,\" I said.",
      "My voice was barely more than a whisper.",
      "\"I am honored that he chose to bring me here.\"",
      "Hera scoffed.",
      "She finally looked up at me and her dark eyes were sharpened by malice and pain.",
      "\"Do you really think I'm that stupid?",
      "That I believe he just brought you here--you, with your obscenely pretty face and pathetic spinelessness--to stand around pouring wine?",
      "Any half-wit can pour wine.",
      "He brought you here to squeal into a pillow.\"",
      "I opened my mouth, but no words came out.",
      "Every defense that I'd practiced for this moment had fled and all I could think of was what horrible thing she was going to do to me now.",
      "She saw that I wasn't going to reply and her lip curled.",
      "\"Still have nothing to say?",
      "How odd.",
      "Maybe you are a half-wit.\"",
      "I turned my eyes to the floor and said nothing.",
      "\"Tell me, Ganymede,\" she said my name like it was a filthy thing.",
      "\"Do you intend to steal him away from me?",
      "To seduce him into some plot that removes me from his side?",
      "Then you could have him all to yourself.\"",
      "I glanced up at her.",
      "I found my words again, but Hera barreled ahead, making it impossible for me to say them.",
      "\"But let me tell you,\" she snapped.",
      "\"I am not going anywhere.",
      "I am his wife and the only way he'll be rid of me is if he kills me the way he did Metis.\"",
      "She smiled then, her tiny rosebud mouth splitting back over her teeth.",
      "\"And I am no Metis.",
      "I am a goddess, daughter of Kronos the Crooked One, and I will see you strung from the stars by your slithering guts before I let you separate me from what's mine.\"",
      "I gazed at her in perfected understanding.",
      "\"You're right\" I told her.",
      "\"I don't belong here.\"",
      "Her eyes shifted.",
      "\"Your husband asked me if I wanted to leave Troy and come here to be with him.",
      "I agreed to it, mostly just to get away from home.",
      "I do like your husband, he's an interesting, passionate person.",
      "But I am fully aware that he will never really be mine--I'm not sure he can be anybody's.",
      "He's not somebody you can pin down with rules and rites.",
      "He's wild.",
      "But isn't that untamed, vibrant spirit the part of him that attracts you the most?",
      "It's true that the two of you are opposites; you're grounded and practical and unswervingly devoted, while Zeus is reckless and restless and driven by passion.",
      "But when you two are near each other it's like watching two halves of the same soul.",
      "Zeus isn't used to people contradicting him but for whatever reason I think he enjoys a good quarrel with you.",
      "It's a challenge for him.",
      "You sharpen his mind and burgeon his creativity.",
      "How could I or anybody else ever compete with that?",
      "\"So what I'm saying, Your Grace, is that I'm sticking around here as long as I can.",
      "I won't lie to you and say that I'm not attracted to Zeus.",
      "I am.",
      "But I also know that even if I tried to get him away from you it'd never work.",
      "So I'll take what I can get, appreciate his attentions as long as I have them, and count myself lucky that he ever noticed me at all.",
      "And, eventually, when he stops caring about me, I'll go away somewhere and think about how lucky you are that you'll always get to have a place in his heart.\"",
      "Hera stared at me for several long seconds.",
      "\"You're a fool,\" she said at last.",
      "I smiled a little.",
      "\"I suppose I am, Your Grace.\"",
      "\"So you're willing to be in a relationship where one of the participants is disloyal?\" she demanded.",
      "\"What about when he takes a new lover, hmm?",
      "How will that make you feel?\" I shrugged.",
      "In truth the idea of Zeus loving someone else made me die a little inside, but that feeling didn't change my outlook.",
      "\"Zeus is a god.",
      "Who am I to contradict what a god does?\" Hera scoffed.",
      "She rose to her feet, the folds of her spangled peplos falling around her like a purple waterfall.",
      "She squinted up at me like I was a wormy, half-rotten apple hanging from a pretty tree.",
      "\"If he hadn't made you immortal, I'd slit your throat and hold you over the side of my balcony.",
      "Then Zeus would know that he's not the only one who can make the rain fall.\"",
      "I just bowed my head.",
      "She brushed past me.",
      "\"Oh, and Ganymede?\" I turned toward her.",
      "She stood with her hand on the door.",
      "\"You can be quite eloquent, even if you do have foolish notions.",
      "You should try expressing yourself more often.\"",
      "I smiled.",
      "\"All I need is a pen and ink and I will express myself as often as you wish, Your Highness.\"",
      "I spun around to see Hera standing there, just inside the door, her face blank, watching us.",
      "Zeus pushed himself upright, smoothing his hair down.",
      "I pulled the sheet up around me, knowing that she'd already seen everything I was trying to hide.",
      "\"I see you're really mulling over your sins,\" she said.",
      "\"What do you want?\" he asked.",
      "\"I'm kind of busy right now.\"",
      "\"I was coming to see if you wanted to go out for breakfast with us, but I realize now that you have other activities planned for the day.\"",
      "She turned to go, her back rigid.",
      "\"Wait,\" I called.",
      "\"He'd love to go.\"",
      "\"What?\" asked Zeus.",
      "\"Really?\"",
      "Hera asked sarcastically, turning back to sneer at us.",
      "\"Yup, he'll be right out.\"",
      "I leaned over Zeus and picked up my boxers, shimmying into them under the sheets.",
      "Once I wasn't naked I climbed out of bed, strode over to the dresser, then pulled out the bottom drawer where I kept several pairs of Zeus' clothes.",
      "\"Where were you planning on going?\" I asked, sorting through the clothes.",
      "I hoped they hadn't been aiming fancy because I didn't have many formal things here.",
      "\"Chloe wants to go to Taylor's,\" Hera said.",
      "Chloe was their youngest daughter, only six years old and cute as a button.",
      "Taylor's was her favorite restaurant, a classic country diner where she always ordered chocolate chip pancakes.",
      "I could feel the tension behind me as husband and wife stared each other down.",
      "I pretended not to notice, pulling a blue flannel shirt and a pair of designer jeans from the drawer.",
      "\"Here,\" I said, tossing them to Zeus.",
      "He caught them automatically.",
      "\"I don't really feel like breakfast,\" he muttered.",
      "\"Yes, you do,\" I told him.",
      "I turned back to Hera.",
      "\"He'll be right down,\" I said, smiling pleasantly.",
      "She curled her lip and left, slamming the door behind her.",
      "Zeus glared at me.",
      "\"What are you doing?",
      "I don't want to go.\"",
      "I just looked at him.",
      "\"What?\" he demanded.",
      "\"She came here to find you,\" I said.",
      "\"She invited you to breakfast with her and the kids.",
      "She's apologizing.\"",
      "\"You call that an apology?\"",
      "\"I call that walking into a room and seeing your husband rolling around in the sheets with his concubine.",
      "She's be stupid not to be mad.\"",
      "I sighed.",
      "\"Go after her.",
      "Take your family out and show them a good time.",
      "She called you a bad father.",
      "Prove her wrong.\"",
      "He shook his head but started getting dressed.",
      "\"She called me a bad husband too.",
      "Do you want me to stop coming to see you so I can prove her wrong?\" I eyed him.",
      "\"You couldn't stay away.\"",
      "He grinned.",
      "He dressed quickly, coming to stand beside me afterwards.",
      "He took my hand, running his thumb over my knuckles.",
      "\"I kind of wanted to stay in bed with you all day,\" he murmured.",
      "\"That would have been a waste of time,\" I told him.",
      "He smiled, reaching up to cup the back of my head.",
      "\"Always so practical.\"",
      "\"One of us has to be.\"",
      "He kissed me.",
      "\"I love you,\" he whispered afterwards.",
      "\"You love her too,\" I replied cutting him off before he could protest.",
      "\"You do.",
      "You always have.",
      "That's why you care so much about what she thinks of you.\"",
      "He glanced away.",
      "\"It's alot easier to love you,\" he muttered.",
      "\"You've always liked a challenge.\"",
      "I smiled at him.",
      "\"Have a good day, sweetheart.",
      "Don't stay away too long.\"",
      "He kissed me once more before striding out the door, going to meet the other half of his life.",
      "I stood there a moment, noticing how empty the room felt without him in it.",
      "I shook my head and went to pick up my clothes.",
      "Zeus would be back soon enough.",
      "I hopped back up onto the bar stool, pondering what my next scene would be."

    "text": "Hades, a relatively new investment banker, stationed across the street from the Capitol tried to hurry his way to his car through a horde of lobbyists. It seemed to be a group of women for some organization called ERA Yes. As the hustle and bustle of the crowd jostled him he couldn't help but notice one girl especially among the crowd. She moved deftly through her fellow activists, passing out yellow roses from a wicker basket she was carrying. She had hair like the mane of a lion, a tangled mass of golden brown curls. Her eyes were a brilliant hazel, and her toasted looking skin was adorned with a tangle of intricately drawn vines. Hades could only stare in amazement. Who was this girl with the baeutiful face, and tattoos, and an even more beautiful aura surrounding her? Here was a girl- No! THE girl he had been looking for. She looked like a beautiful princess, practically a goddess. She seemed to pulse with vitality, and there was a certain fierceness behind her warm eyes. She was the kind of girl who lured you in with her beauty and kindness, but made sure you knew your place in her life. She was the kind of girl who looked for a partner, a supporter rather than an overbearing boyfriend type. Suddenly, Hades had a new purpose other than finding his car and getting home. He had to meet this girl, who might be more aptly described as a force of nature. He pushed through the crowd more desperately now, determined to meet this enigmatic figure that he still had not said two words to, and yet he was already imagining their life together. He was 5 feet away...3 feet... He was so close! Suddenly, he could wait no longer and made a mad grab for her arm. \"What the hell do you think you're doing, Buster?\" she shrieked as she whirled around grabbing a can of mace, poised to spray the pallid man with long dark hair pulled back into a bun standing before her, but she stopped. \"What was that about?\" \"Well...uh...you see...uh...I'm Hades,\" he stammered not used to feeling this insecure. His thin lips were chapped and speaking to her seemed to almost pain him, he looked so scared. \"And well...uh I noticed you in the crowd, and there was something about you. I just felt this pull like I had to meet you, and uh...would you maybe want to get coffee sometime and tell me more about your cause?\" he finally spit out, sounding breathless. \"Sure,\" she said pinning a yellow rose to his lapel. He noticed how much more melodic her voice sounded when she wasn't shrieking at him. It had a nice lull to it. Also she was now so close to him that he could smell the intoxicating scent that was almost indescribably her. She smelled like flowers, a delicate blend of rose and an almost lily like quality with a hint of lime. She took the cellphone he offered her, and input her name and number. \"Persephone,\" he said softly to himself, grinning slightly. He watched the enigma of a girl with the fiery personality disappear back into the crowd continuing her purpose of encouraging her companions.",

    "text": "There was something in her woods, something that wasn't supposed to be there. Alecto allowed herself to take a physical form, stepping out of the lake that she had last watched over, and began a steady pace towards where the foreigner had been sensed. Things came easy and fast, especially considering how all of the dryads loved to gossip through the leaves and the grapevines. So the second that there was a stranger in the woods, even if she couldn't sense them right off, it would be seconds before she was alerted to it. The forest was ancient, and that meant that new things were easily found. The forest would never hurt her, never allowed itself to be any sort of danger to it's watcher. No nettles drove their way into the soles of her feet, no branches whipped their way into her cheek, and there was no danger posed in any of the wild beasts. Not that any of the beasts even perceived her, not in any way that they could see her as an attacker. Alecto found herself coming across the trails more often then she wanted to. The hunters and the thieves and merchants that came through her woods always seemed to pave something or take something or leave something that they weren't supposed to every time that they came through. And it wasn't for lack of trying on Alecto's part. She had tried every trick that she had at her disposal, spreading rumors of wild, angry beasts in the woods. Coaxing thorn bushes and roots to grow through the carefully maintained trials overnight, diverting trials and making them loop in circles. Decades and decades of effort, and even though time meant very little to an ancient being such as her, it still made her leaves curl at the edges. This easily could be another example of humanity leaving something that it shouldn't, but it wasn't trash. This time it felt different, like a new soul had joined. But that hadn't happened in centuries, and Alecto knew (or at least thought that she did) that there weren't any new plants that were supposed to be gaining sentience any time soon. Could she have miscalculated? It was rare, but her forest had grown so much over the millennium that maybe she was just losing her touch. It had been a little too long since she had last walked around her boundaries, maybe she needed to update her memory of the place. If this ended up being a clerical mistake, then she would do that after welcoming the new soul in the most proper way. Everything had an order in which it should be developed, and that meant that routine always came first. New souls would be welcomed first, shown how everything works first, and then Alecto could go back to her personal duties. It seemed that she was right, that maybe a new soul had joined without her even noticing, because when she got to the edge of the trail there was something new. Winding around one of the newer trees was a new vine of some sorts, which lead her to one conclusion. Humans had brought something to her forest, but this time it had a soul. So much sadder than the junk that they left. Sure the junk could injure and harm the denizens of her woods, but it was easily picked up and thrown into the back of another passing human cart. But to bring a soul here? A soul into a new home, a new area that it had never seen before? One that it probably wasn't cut out for? That was cruel, that was tragic and Alecto could feel her heart pound in pity for whatever spirit the strange leafed vine held. \"Come out, dear one,\" Alecto knew better than to use her terrifying voice, even though this spirit could be harmful or dangerous to her forest it had no choice in being brought here, \"You won't be hurt, darling.\" It was the same voice that she used for coaxing out any other spirit or baby animal, soft and pleasant and almost crooning. \"Wh-where am I?\" The voice came to her side and as Alecto turned she noticed that the dryad was already fully formed. A tad strange, but the entire situation was strange to her, \"Who are you?\" Her hair was made out of the same leaves that ran up the vine, her skin was the same color of the bark of the tree that she was wrapped around, and her eyes were the same dark green. \"I am Alecto, I am the Watcher of this Wood and you are now in my woods.\" She spread her arms and let the small torrents and gouts of light. It was a little flashy but it did it's job, \"And who are you?\" \"My names Basia, I- the plant's mine please don't tear it up,\" Basia's eyes widened and she moved to try to go in front of it, like she truly believed that Alecto posed a threat to her. \"I wouldn't, you have my word, Basia,\" There was a power behind her words, behind giving her word, and there always had been. It was a useful technique, best used for new comers who weren't entirely sure of themselves, \"But I need to know what you are, so I can ensure that you aren't going to be dangerous to my woods,\" \"I'm a- Poison Ivy, that's what they call me. It's because I cause a rash on every person who touches me- and I don't even know how I got here! People don't take me willingly, I've been cut down several times and I keep growing back and no one wants me!\" Basia seemed like she was about to burst into tears, considering how her eyes started getting bloodshot with green and red as she wiped at her eyes. Alecto wasn't a selfish protector, and she knew that there were so many important things that were more important than keeping humans out- but this was a promise for something. If people hated the poison ivy, and if she could spread enough rumors about the consequences of cutting down the forest, this could be the best of both worlds, \"I will not force you out, and I will not allow anything to hurt you. You are now in my forest and you are underneath my protection. No humans nor beasts will bring harm to you while you live in my forest, for we are all together here.\" She sounded much more sure of herself than she felt, but truly this was how things went. She did her best to make sure that everyone was happy and at least a little at peace when it comes to welcoming them in. After that? Well, she really can't be promising anything. Life comes at all of them, strangely fast now that there was civilization far too close to her forest. Things went too fast, and that was a tad concerning considering how close the people had gotten. Mostly concerning out of the fact that things were getting more and more dangerous for the fauna in the wilds, as man often attempted to hunt in her woods. And Attempt was truly the best word for it, everything was so much more dangerous than humanity was prepared for, and so her woods had gotten a reputation for being dangerous. Still, even the threat of death and danger and permanently feeding the forest with their corpse wasn't going to be enough for them to stay away. Though, it did meant that those who did come in after all of the warnings were the most foolhardy and dangerous. And a foolhardy human was one that would ignore everything except only the most direct attacks, and they always carried with them the risk of blowing the entire thing out of the water. Too dangerous and people would try to bulldoze the forest in order to protect everyone else, too safe and people wouldn't know what was best for them. And they would come in droves and pave through her woods and everything would be horrifying and new. Basia hummed out a little, stumbling her way in order to grasp onto Alecto's arms, \"I'm, show me around? This is nothing like the last place I was. It's a lot denser and the trees are strange here,\" Her eyes darted around, a little paranoia entering her gaze as she kept close. \"Maybe this place is a little strange for you, but it was strange for everyone once and I hope that eventually you can come to accept and enjoy it as your new home,\" Alecto hummed, pressing a mothering kiss to Basia's temple, \"You are here until you wilt, and I hope that I can make sure that it's a comfortable stay.\" Which is exactly what they wanted, they had to. It was her job to protect and watch over the woods and that means that she has to take care of every single plant and flower and beast in the forest no matter the cost. Of course, it all depended on if Poison Ivy (such a strange name for a plant) was going to be harmful to her already there plants and creatures. Even if it did happen, well then things could be arranged so that everything is wonderfully separated and that meant that she could find a new place to put the Ivy in where it wouldn't risk anyone for anything (except the humans). The quickly growing vine was also very promising for being able to grow around the paths and trip everything human up. It was going to be interesting, and if humanity got the sign that the poison ivy was going to hurt them, then they wouldn't go in the paths. That way, it would be the perfect thing to cover the brambles with when they grow through the path. If the path is ruined and covered in brambles and vines, then humanity can't get through. If they can't get through in such an easy and fast way, they'll have to move. And if they move, then Alecto won't have to ever worry about humanity ruining her woods again! This was going to be a rather exciting partnership, and she couldn't wait until the experiment bore at least some sort of fruit. Well, not exactly fruit, the forest here didn't grow any sort of fruit. But that was a pretty good thing, considering that if any of the fruit and berries grown here were human edible then it would have been ruined so long ago. Turned into manufactured rows and clean ground and paved roads. Alecto would be useless, wouldn't she? Or would she just turn into a watcher of the orchard and be a twisted being who was unable to realize that that's the opposite of what she should be. The thought was a little terrifying, and she didn't really want to dwell on it. How terrifying, the idea of turning into a protector of falseness was too much for her to bear. So she focused on the dryad in front of her, gently carding her fingers through Basia's hair. \"It's okay, little one, I will not allow the humans to harm you ever again. You are protected inside of my forest and you will always be for as long as your vine grows on my land, I will have you flourish and I will not allow harm to come to you. You'll be protected by me, by the others in the forest, just as you will protect them in turn.\" \"I will, I will I swear,\" Basia rubbed at her slightly green tinted cheeks, trying to calm herself down from the precipice of an actual panic attack, \"I'm not going to hurt anyone, I don't want to hurt anyone! I just can't help it, I just can't help it!\" \"Just as the yew berries cannot help their poisonous nature, just as the sap of the pine cannot help but entrap insects. It is in your nature to harm some, and in your nature to help others. You don't have to worry about all of that here, not now.\" And truly, Basia didn't have to worry about all of that. Harm was inevitable, and that meant that she would be unable to really comfort her on that end. It would be foolish of her to tell the dryad that she would never harm another living soul, when harm and hurt can never be truly separated from some beings. But harm can be mitigated and that would be the goal of all of this. Keeping the harm easy and able to either bandage or ignore, that was the best way to go about it. Basia seemed to take at least a little comfort in her words, and that was enough for Alecto to press another motherly kiss to her forehead. \"You are strong and beautiful, Basia, and you need not to worry yourself about the humans. I have a plan,\" She knew that her eyes had gained a strange glint in them and maybe Basia was a little intimidated by that but Alecto couldn't really worry herself about that. Basia would have to get used to it, because she had long understood that she should never prune or clip her more terrifying parts no matter how new the spirit is. They would find her true nature regardless, and everything was going to make itself clear in time. Why bother with hiding something that was going to make itself clear in time. It was a waste of a good red herring, and Alecto didn't have the time for it. \"Thank you...?\" Her voice ended on a high note and Alecto fought against a blush rising to her cheeks as she realized that she never introduced herself properly. \"My name is Alecto, I am the Watcher of the Woods in the same way that you are the Poison Ivy,\" She gestured slightly at the vine that was fast growing around the tree, \"These woods are all I know,\" \"I'll make sure to protect whatever tree I'm attached to, I swear Alecto!\" Basia seemed still just a little too nervous for Alecto's taste, but she just has to trust that it will all settle out the longer that she lives in the forest. \"I'm sure that you will, Basia, and please let me know if there is anything that I can do in order to make your stay here easy,\" Stay was a little bit of a strange term to use, but Alecto figured that since time was so strange and funny with a spirit's perception of time. A decade to a tree is nothing, especially compared with the lifespans of beasts and man. Time was strange and stretched like sap, but Alecto knew that everyone experienced time different. But she will remain until humanity destroys her woods, and she will not blink at the duty that is in front of her.",

      "And Attempt was truly the best word for it, everything was so much more dangerous than humanity was prepared for, and so her woods had gotten a reputation for being dangerous.",
      "Still, even the threat of death and danger and permanently feeding the forest with their corpse wasn't going to be enough for them to stay away.",
      "Though, it did meant that those who did come in after all of the warnings were the most foolhardy and dangerous.",
      "And a foolhardy human was one that would ignore everything except only the most direct attacks, and they always carried with them the risk of blowing the entire thing out of the water.",
      "Too dangerous and people would try to bulldoze the forest in order to protect everyone else, too safe and people wouldn't know what was best for them.",
      "And they would come in droves and pave through her woods and everything would be horrifying and new.",
      "Basia hummed out a little, stumbling her way in order to grasp onto Alecto's arms, \"I'm, show me around?",
      "This is nothing like the last place I was.",
      "It's a lot denser and the trees are strange here,\" Her eyes darted around, a little paranoia entering her gaze as she kept close.",
      "\"Maybe this place is a little strange for you, but it was strange for everyone once and I hope that eventually you can come to accept and enjoy it as your new home,\" Alecto hummed, pressing a mothering kiss to Basia's temple, \"You are here until you wilt, and I hope that I can make sure that it's a comfortable stay.\"",
      "Which is exactly what they wanted, they had to.",
      "It was her job to protect and watch over the woods and that means that she has to take care of every single plant and flower and beast in the forest no matter the cost.",
      "Of course, it all depended on if Poison Ivy (such a strange name for a plant) was going to be harmful to her already there plants and creatures.",
      "Even if it did happen, well then things could be arranged so that everything is wonderfully separated and that meant that she could find a new place to put the Ivy in where it wouldn't risk anyone for anything (except the humans).",
      "The quickly growing vine was also very promising for being able to grow around the paths and trip everything human up.",
      "It was going to be interesting, and if humanity got the sign that the poison ivy was going to hurt them, then they wouldn't go in the paths.",
      "That way, it would be the perfect thing to cover the brambles with when they grow through the path.",
      "If the path is ruined and covered in brambles and vines, then humanity can't get through.",
      "If they can't get through in such an easy and fast way, they'll have to move.",
      "And if they move, then Alecto won't have to ever worry about humanity ruining her woods again!",
      "This was going to be a rather exciting partnership, and she couldn't wait until the experiment bore at least some sort of fruit.",
      "Well, not exactly fruit, the forest here didn't grow any sort of fruit.",
      "But that was a pretty good thing, considering that if any of the fruit and berries grown here were human edible then it would have been ruined so long ago.",
      "Turned into manufactured rows and clean ground and paved roads.",
      "Alecto would be useless, wouldn't she?",
      "Or would she just turn into a watcher of the orchard and be a twisted being who was unable to realize that that's the opposite of what she should be.",
      "The thought was a little terrifying, and she didn't really want to dwell on it.",
      "How terrifying, the idea of turning into a protector of falseness was too much for her to bear.",
      "So she focused on the dryad in front of her, gently carding her fingers through Basia's hair.",
      "\"It's okay, little one, I will not allow the humans to harm you ever again.",
      "You are protected inside of my forest and you will always be for as long as your vine grows on my land, I will have you flourish and I will not allow harm to come to you.",
      "You'll be protected by me, by the others in the forest, just as you will protect them in turn.\"",
      "\"I will, I will I swear,\" Basia rubbed at her slightly green tinted cheeks, trying to calm herself down from the precipice of an actual panic attack, \"I'm not going to hurt anyone, I don't want to hurt anyone!",
      "I just can't help it, I just can't help it!\"",
      "\"Just as the yew berries cannot help their poisonous nature, just as the sap of the pine cannot help but entrap insects.",
      "It is in your nature to harm some, and in your nature to help others.",
      "You don't have to worry about all of that here, not now.\"",
      "And truly, Basia didn't have to worry about all of that.",
      "Harm was inevitable, and that meant that she would be unable to really comfort her on that end.",
      "It would be foolish of her to tell the dryad that she would never harm another living soul, when harm and hurt can never be truly separated from some beings.",
      "But harm can be mitigated and that would be the goal of all of this.",
      "Keeping the harm easy and able to either bandage or ignore, that was the best way to go about it.",
      "Basia seemed to take at least a little comfort in her words, and that was enough for Alecto to press another motherly kiss to her forehead.",
      "\"You are strong and beautiful, Basia, and you need not to worry yourself about the humans.",
      "I have a plan,\" She knew that her eyes had gained a strange glint in them and maybe Basia was a little intimidated by that but Alecto couldn't really worry herself about that.",
      "Basia would have to get used to it, because she had long understood that she should never prune or clip her more terrifying parts no matter how new the spirit is.",
      "They would find her true nature regardless, and everything was going to make itself clear in time.",
      "Why bother with hiding something that was going to make itself clear in time.",
      "It was a waste of a good red herring, and Alecto didn't have the time for it.",
      "\"Thank you...?\"",
      "Her voice ended on a high note and Alecto fought against a blush rising to her cheeks as she realized that she never introduced herself properly.",
      "\"My name is Alecto, I am the Watcher of the Woods in the same way that you are the Poison Ivy,\" She gestured slightly at the vine that was fast growing around the tree, \"These woods are all I know,\" \"I'll make sure to protect whatever tree I'm attached to, I swear Alecto!\"",
      "Basia seemed still just a little too nervous for Alecto's taste, but she just has to trust that it will all settle out the longer that she lives in the forest.",
      "\"I'm sure that you will, Basia, and please let me know if there is anything that I can do in order to make your stay here easy,\" Stay was a little bit of a strange term to use, but Alecto figured that since time was so strange and funny with a spirit's perception of time.",
      "A decade to a tree is nothing, especially compared with the lifespans of beasts and man.",
      "Time was strange and stretched like sap, but Alecto knew that everyone experienced time different.",
      "But she will remain until humanity destroys her woods, and she will not blink at the duty that is in front of her."

    "text": "Your little brother was perhaps the single most important piece of your life; he meant everything to you. Of course, you were technically twins, but being born nine days earlier gave you an advantageous head start. You even helped your mother through his birth. And when you held him, so small and vulnerable in your arms, his laugh as bright as the sun, you vowed on that day to do everything in your power to protect him; always. Yet when you swore that promise, you had yet to realize the gravity behind it. It was soon after that it dawned on you that you and Apollo were destined to be exact opposites. He the sun, you the moon; you chaste and pure and he... Well, to say promiscuous would be putting it lightly. You were cunning and thoughtful and he was impulsive and impetuous, proning him to all types of trouble you'd bail him from. So when he went missing, and he often did, it didn't surprise you. Two weeks was fine, but at three weeks you started to worry. And as the weeks turned into months you knew you had to go looking for him. The last time he went missing was for a month and a half in the roaring twenties. You tracked him down to New York City and discovered him in the middle of a bender so infamous, Dionysus himself was envious. Had mortals shown an ounce of respect for gods these days, Apollo would have at least one or two more stories to add to his repertoire. After that, the two of you stayed in the New World, occasionally travelling here or there, for family engagements. As much as possible, you kept a low profile, and tried to convince your brother to as well. It worked, for the most part. This time after he went missing, naturally, you started with the party towns and after hearing about a 'miracle' in Las Vegas where the sun didn't set for three days time, you knew you had found the place to start. Knowing Apollo had a flair for extravagance, you started at the top, working your way down. But even the Bentel & Bentel penthouse suite at the Cosmopolitan Hotel was a but flashy, even for him. The signs of his inhabitants were all to clear, but he had not returned even after several days. You started pursuing club surveillance, finally pinning him to the Emerald Gentlemen's Club. It was his last known whereabouts and the last place he was seen. All other traces of him had vanished. It was as if he didn't want to be found. But on the video surveillance, two days later popped up another face. One you were all to familiar with. One Apollo had several run ins with that often lead to trouble. The trickster. You hunted him down to the desolate wasteland of North Dakota, hiding like a fox in a hole. His private resort was carved into the side of a mountain, easily overlooked by the untrained eye. But Loki's desire for luxury undid him. It glowed as obvious as a candle in the night, calling you in. You lurked in the shadows for days. Watching, waiting, but Apollo never showed. You finally revealed yourself once you had enough of the cheating rat's trickery. He was in the middle of a poker game, porn stars in barely nothing dancing around polls opposite of him. Three other men, all gruff placed bets. He lifted his his face, when you saw it. His two cards were four, all aces. Your restraint could no longer be contained. You lifted your bow, sliding an arrow into place and without hesitation let it release. It tore right through the cards, pinning them to the table. The three gentlemen looked down at the table seeing the four cards displayed. They eyed Loki dangerously. He shrugged his shoulders. \"Fellas, those aren't mine.\" One man threw his hand down on the table, before rolling up his sleeves. But Loki paused the scene before it continued. \"And neither is this.\" He pried the arrow from the table, the illusion faded as he further examined it. The people, the cards, the drinks, all vanished leaving only you, him, and the furnishings. \"Come out Katniss.\" He goaded. You bravely stepped out of the shadows. \"My... Athena... Haven't you changed with the times.\" He looked you up and down; your black skinny jeans tucked into dark boots., studded leather jacket over a silk red top, and your hair hanging down in curls. \"It's Artemis, you pig.\" You held you bow close. \"Ah yes.\" He recalled. \"All of you are so hard to keep straight. Don't even get me started with the whole Roman thing...\" He walked over to a wooden bar pouring himself a drink. \"So what can I do ya for? I make a mean Sex on the Beach.\" He offered before taking a sip. You ignored the proposal. \"I'm here for information. It'd be wise you answer truthfully in interest of your well being.\" You paused and for a moment your curiosity got the better of you. \"Is it true what they say about you?\" He wiggled his eyebrows playfully. \"And what do they say about me? That I can last nights on end, that I have the endurance of a panther, that Aphrodite got half her stories from me, that Zeus wishes he had a pair like...\" You squinted at him. \"You dare tempt me?\" He chuckled. \"Oh god no. I was just hoping that cute brother of yours was going to pop out of a shadow in a jealous rage. But it looks like I'm out of luck.\" Your hope dropped. \"You've not seen Apollo?\" Loki sighed. \"Listen, I like to get wrapped up in a Greek tragedy at least once every century as much as the next guy, but when you guys start dropping in for holidays, come on, it starts to cramp my style.\" You tucked your bow back into it's satchel and turned to leave. But he grabbed your shoulder before you could. \"Arty...\" He cood. \"What's happened?\" You shook your head. \"I'm sure nothing. You know how he is.\" \"Let me suggest two things.\" He held up a finger. \"First, get a beeper for that kid. Second.\" He pulled a card out of thin air. \"Maybe it's time to call in a favor from your patron saints...\" You took the card. Eyeing it with suspicion. It was an FBI business card, with the name Agent Robert Plant and a phone number. Obviously a fake. Obviously a hunter. You looked back to Loki. \"Thanks, but I got this.\" You turned to leave again. \"By the way. It looks like you might be molting... Gabriel.\" And with that he was left in the room alone. He looked down to his feet where a few golden feathers had collected. \"Dammit!\" He cursed. *** Outside a small town in Iowa, you stayed in a rundown motel off of a dying highway route. In its glory days, southern tourists bound for Mt. Rushmore must have filled it to the brim. But now, in it's secludedness and stillness, it was the perfect place to reconvene and focus. You twirled the business card back and forth between your fingers; considering it. If these hunters had any idea who you were or half the things you've done, they wouldn't hesitating putting a stake through your chest. And Apollo... well, if they caught wind of him, there's no telling what would happen. You had arrogance, yes, but not the arrogance of other gods that would dismiss hunters as any other ape. You had to be smart, cunning, to treat them with respect, or your fate could easily end up as any other monster on their hit list. Finally, you worked through your hesitation and dialed the number, faking the best damsel in distress act as you could. You simply needed to keep him on the line long enough to triangulate his position, then you could go to him, gauging his usefulness, if he proved otherwise, you could easily slip away with your presence going entirely unnoticed. \"Hello.\" A strong, deep voice answered. \"Uh... hello, um Agent Plant?\" You stuttered, voice a few octaves higher than usual. \"Yes?\" His confusion quickly grew. \"I um, I got your number from a friend, Sally Hanson, I'm not sure if you remember, she says you helped her a few years back on a case...\" You fabricated, but intently kept an eye on your laptop as the tracking software was running. There was a pause as he tried to recall. \"Oh, right, of course... Sally.\" Even though there was confidence in his voice, you could tell it was complete bullshit. \"Well, what seems to be troubling you.\" You sighed. \"You see... it's my brother, he's been missing near two weeks. I haven't been able to contact him.\" \"Have you filed a missing persons report?\" He asked, trying to fish out details of the case. \"Of course, but the local police haven't been too helpful... Unfortunately, my brother has a bit of a reputation around here.\" Actually the story came easier than you thought. \"And uh, what makes you think he simply hasn't started fresh somewhere else?\" \"Well, that does seem like him, but we've always been so close. He would never leave and not tell me.\" You explained, heart hurting more and more as you began to diverge the truth. \"Well...\" He chewed on it. \"I'm not sure it's exactly my type of case, I got a few things lined up, but if I have any openings....\" Shit. You needed a few more minutes. \"I'm just so worried about him.\" You interrupted. \"There's been other missing people too. With the police not helping I've tried to do my own investigation you know. And I started at this old hangout of his. And it's just like creepy you know. I know I must be imagining things but there is just this chill that comes over you as...:\" Bingo. You pinned him nearby Lebanon, Kansas. He assumed you had stopped unable to continue from sadness or fear. \"Okay sweetheart, just calm down. I'll run the details by my partner and we'll try to be out in a couple days. Where are you at anyways.\" \"Oh...\" You chuckled. \"This is so embarrassing. He's uh calling me right now. I'll give you a call back if we need anything.\" And you abruptly hung up, quickly switching off your phone so he couldn't track you. After taking a minute to breathe, you shook of any remainder of the act, for a damsel in distress you were surely not. You pack your things and checked out of the motel, heading for Lebanon. *** Lebanon. It was a extremely small town. To say it was a one-horse town would be a vast understatement. But that made your hunt all the more easy. You set up shop at the only food market in town and waited. It was two days before he showed up. His car stood out like a sore thumb. It was old enough to be handed down through the generations, taken well care of, countless of miles put on it, and modifications to the trunk. You expected a hunter, but the man not who stepped out of the car. Your heart dropped. Instantly recognizing him from the security footage you reviewed time and time again in Vegas. But the fear was instantly replaced by boiling anger. Apollo wasn't dead, yet. You could feel it. He couldn't be. And not from the hands of this hunter. As he lazily strenched, you jolted from your car catching him by surprise. You grabbed his wrist, using the force to push him up against the car. He struggled a bit but you had him pinned. \"Where is he?!\" You demanded. Dean pondered trying to catch up. \"Listen, sweetheart..\" He started. You cut him off, shoving him hard against the car. \"Call me that one more time.\" You warmed. \"Where is my brother?\" \"Why don't you just calm down and we can find him together.\" Dean attempted to de-escalate your anger. \"I'm not taking your bullshit hunter.\" You spat. \"You were there. In Las Vegas. When he disappeared.\" Tears threatened to spill over. It took him a second, but then it clicked. \"I might know where he is. How about all three of us meet up tonight...\" He stopped when he felt his hands being tied together. \"You will take me to him now.\" You took the keys from his pocket, opened the door and shoved him inside. You slid into the driver's seat, next to him. \"Oh hell no.\" He protested as you started up the car. Just by briefly looking around it was easy to see the car was occupied usually by three. \"Don't bother trying to notify your partners.\" You noticed he already seemed to be looking for a knife to pry out of the ropes. \"The more you resist the restraints the tighter they become.\" \"What are you?\" Dean huffed as you pulled out of the parking lot. \"Witches, demons.\" You lightly chuckled but did not grant him the satisfaction of an answer. *** It took a while to find his location, he not being the most helpful or willing subject. But his emotions became easier to read the more time spent with him. The subtle gritting of teeth or sighs of relief each correct or incorrect turn you made, it led you closer to the destination until you finally arrived. You led Dean through the entrance, dagger at his back to hinder him or his partners from trying anything. The door swung open with a heavy creak leading into the hideout below. To be honest, you were impressed with the space. \"Dean?\" Someone called from below. His younger brother. Taller, longer hair, but still a touch of youthfulness that Dean lacked. \"Hiya Sammy.\" Dean drearily greeted. Sam reached for the gun in his back pocket, but your second dagger buzzed threw the air dislodging it before it was even pointed at you. \"What's going on?\" Sam asked through the shock. \"She's a lot stronger than she looks.\" Dean scoffed. \"I'm strong because I had to be.\" You explained as Dean felt the dagger press harder against his back. \"Born into a world of vengeful and sex crazed gods, I didn't have any other choice. Now, I will take back what is mine and give nothing in return.\" Sam still had confusion plastered across his face, attempting to work out what Dean already had. Everyone's attention broke at the sound of a coffee mug shattering against the floor. You turned to the sound, expecting their third partner but instead finding your fool of a brother in a bathrobe. \"Arty?\" He sheepishly asked. \"Apollo.\" You sighed a breath of relief and released Dean, running towards him. \"Are you okay? Did they hurt you?\" You checked him over. He rolled his eyes. \"Arty you are embarrassing me.\" When all seemed right, you punched him square in the shoulder. \"What the hell? You can't just disappear on me like that.\" \"Ow.\" He moaned and rubbed the spot on impact. \"Can you blame me? They're cute.\" He defended. \"I didn't need you up in my business ruining everything. You're kinda a cock blocker.\" As you argued back and forth, Dean made his way slowly down the stairs and joined Sam, marvelling in wonderment. \"Turns out we've had a god living with us, right under our noses.\" Dean commented. Apollo's argument sounded over them. \"Besides, anytime there was a successful hunt, I burnt offerings of incense to you.\" \"Like that matters!\" You spat. \"For a whole month....\" Sam added to his and Dean's side conversation. \"We must be losing our touch.\"",

    "text": "Dionysus is passion, I think as his breath ghosts over my thighs. Passion and madness and thrill. Sin trapped in the skin of a god. His entire being is the energy of life, the hum of adrenalin alive in the ichor in his veins. It is a strange kind of contradiction to be loved by him. This man who is madness -- feared by so many among us for the stories of insanity, murderous trances, uncontrolled debauchery -- yet who is so unspeakably adoring. His touch is almost reverent. The caresses of his fingers feel like worship, and under his hands it is impossible to believe I am anything less than a goddess. He grips the curve of my hip and I am brighter than the dawn's golden bloom as it spills across the night-inked sea beside us. The sun kisses my face, bathes his back in warm orange and he glows. Looking down at him now it is easy to see him as the god he is: dark skin lit up gold, wine-rich eyes heavy with desire. He meets my gaze, my heart still caught in my chest at the image of him, and I almost weep. His stare is worried. It is safe and loving and wonderful with worry and I feel tears prickle my waterline. \"'Adne?\" he asks, voice like a velvet embrace, \"are you okay? Is this okay?\" I nod frantically, a lump in my throat and a smile pulling irrepressible over my lips. \"Yes.\" I reach down and cup his face, tug him up towards me, whisper against his mouth like a prayer. \"Yes, yes.\" I feel his grin and taste the grapes on his breath as he cradles my back. \"I love you. Gods, I love you.\" This is what it is to love -- to live. I could laugh, remembering how I once hoped an Athenian prince could hold me, could love me. With Dionysus I am incandescent. I am ecstasy itself, under the touch of madness. I lay back on the sand, still bathed in the golden fire of dawn, and pull him down over me. \"Show me?\" He laughs, deep and husky with promise, then kisses me again. It's tender and perfect and all I can think is gods, this is love-- before his lips are moving and I'm gasping--",

    "text": "Summer that year was soft as silk, gentle with a sunshine that sank into the skin like a kiss. The hazy sky seemed somehow to cast everything in a yellow-edged glaze, steeped sweet with the laughter of children playing in the wash of warm gold. He leant heavy against the sun soaked brick as the breeze danced across his cheeks. It was delicate with the scent of pomegranate and lily, and cool on his pale fingers, curved over his guitar's strings. Plucked notes sang into the perfumed air. His voice was deep and velvety, shaping lyrics with a tenderness ill-befitting the sharp lines of his shirt. \"How are you still wearing a button-down in this weather?\" The chords paused, and he glanced up from the frets, a smile playing over his lips. She was there, with messy curls tumbling from the haphazard bun atop her head, beaming and radiant in a dirtied green apron. A single asphodel hung carefully in her fingertips, white petals tipped towards the ground, blooming beautiful from her touch. \"You cut off the chorus,\" he said. She laughed. \"Sorry.\" The summer light made her glow, all warm like a drop of sun. Behind her was a sea of flowers climbing abundant from their carefully shelved pots - roses and daffodils, sunflowers and violets, hyacinths and crocuses. Trails of purple wisteria curled from the trellis above her head, as if reaching for her. The array of colour and vine nearly obscured the swirling green letters painted above the shop's front - Demeter's Garden Nook. She flopped cross-legged onto the pavement in front of him, close enough to press the toes of her shoes against his. \"Sing to me, lover.\" So he did, crooning out a melancholy melody and picking at the strings until they hummed out starlight and bone. She closed her eyes and let the music blanket her. She wanted to wrap herself in it, melt into it until she was warm and comfortable and safe. It felt like home. The home she missed terribly. It was wonderful up here of course, bathed in the buttery sunlight of summer and wreathed in her mother's nature, but she missed- oh, how she missed. After a time, she would miss the dark; miss the dead. The flowers and fields lost their appeal once she craved the touch of her lover's hand. While her soul ached for the balm of his voice, the summer months would continue on, bright as their riches below. It was difficult to be so torn between two worlds. The petals and buds called to the Goddess of Spring, but the beneath beckoned to the Queen of the Dead. As much as her mother liked to pretend she was still Kore, pretend like her kingdom was a burden, Persephone loved the Underworld. She loved her husband. His song came to an end, embroidered with a gentle lilt that unravelled her insides. Persephone opened her eyes. Hades's gaze was soft and honeyed on her. Smiling, she reached forward and tucked the asphodel into his hair. The flower seemed rejuvenated by the spell of his voice - blooming brighter than it ever had in the sun - and framed against his mop of black waves, the white petals looked even paler. \"You'll get caught one day,\" she said, playing with a lock of his hair. \"Can't imagine your brother will be all too happy to find Hades Hades-less.\" Her husband lay his guitar to the side and gestured for Persephone to scoot forward between his knees. She did, flipping her legs out so her thighs rested comfortably on top of his. He tangled their fingers together idly. \"What my little brother doesn't know won't hurt him.\" It was good here, in this bubble of them. He made it easy to be Persephone: there was no expectation, no pre-conceived idea of who she should be - only who she was. It was shelter from a storm, she thought, an island at sea. \"You're pushing your luck,\" she told him, though her words were fond. \"You know my mother would tattle on you in a heartbeat if she found us.\" A small smile danced at the corners of his lips. \"Lucky for me she hasn't then.\" \"Incorrigible, that's what you are.\" For a moment he made no reply, dark eyes simply drinking in the sight of her. He raised a hand and brushed an errant curl gently behind her ear. \"Six months always feels so long,\" he said at last. \"I missed you.\" Heart soft, she rested her forehead against her lover's chest and breathed him in deep. Light, musky, faintly sweet with pomegranate - the same as always. \"I missed you too.\"",

      "Smiling, she reached forward and tucked the asphodel into his hair.",
      "The flower seemed rejuvenated by the spell of his voice - blooming brighter than it ever had in the sun - and framed against his mop of black waves, the white petals looked even paler.",
      "\"You'll get caught one day,\" she said, playing with a lock of his hair.",
      "\"Can't imagine your brother will be all too happy to find Hades Hades-less.\"",
      "Her husband lay his guitar to the side and gestured for Persephone to scoot forward between his knees.",

      "\"What my little brother doesn't know won't hurt him.\"",

      "It was shelter from a storm, she thought, an island at sea.",

      "A small smile danced at the corners of his lips.",
      "\"Lucky for me she hasn't then.\"",
      "\"Incorrigible, that's what you are.\"",
      "For a moment he made no reply, dark eyes simply drinking in the sight of her.",
      "He raised a hand and brushed an errant curl gently behind her ear.",
      "\"Six months always feels so long,\" he said at last.",
      "\"I missed you.\"",
      "Heart soft, she rested her forehead against her lover's chest and breathed him in deep.",
      "Light, musky, faintly sweet with pomegranate - the same as always.",
      "\"I missed you too.\""

    "text": "It's only been, what, two weeks? a month? since Alex told Apollo to get out of their (well, it's not theirs anymore, it's back to being just Alex's again) apartment, but never in his interminable life has such a short amount of time felt so long. It feels like it's been forever since that argument. It hurts like it's been that long, too. Part of Apollo is infuriated about-- especially the fact that Alex kicked him out-- but mostly he's just... sad. Deep down sad, right in the centre of his chest where it all hurts and throbs and reminds him of just how badly he fucked this up. Apollo's called him four times now. He doesn't want to be overbearing and drive Alex away even more by calling several times every day, but he can't just sit around doing nothing to try and fix this. It's his fault, after all, so it's up to him to do something about it. The first three times he called, Apollo was met with only the answering machine saying \"leave a message after the beep\" in that achingly familiar voice that he misses and yearns after, and he was grateful that he neglected to change the answering machine to something that showed he lived there too despite always saying that he was going to (however, he never once left a message after the beep-- Apollo is much too proud for that). The fourth and final time he called, though, he was met with the real thing, the real Alex and not just the automated version, telling him to stop fucking calling him and go to hell. Even though the statement sent daggers through his veins, Apollo smiled just the tiniest bit when he'd hung up that time because at least Alex had actually answered. But merely calling every few days has gotten him nowhere, and the amount of guilt weighing on his chest is driving Apollo positively insane. So insane, in fact, that he finds himself standing outside of Alex's apartment one night, a bouquet of roses in one hand, determined to make all of his wrongs right, his fist hovering in front of the door, hesitant, too afraid to actually knock. Apollo has debated doing this for a while. He doesn't think this is going to go well-- he's expecting them to fight again, truth be told-- but he's willing to take that chance. If he doesn't, he runs the risk of losing Alex forever, and that thought keeps him awake at night, tossing and turning and staring at the ceiling until the sun inevitably rises again. With his heart pounding uncomfortably in his throat, he finally sucks up every ounce of courage he possesses in his 6'7 frame and knocks on the door. Apollo clasps his hands behind his back after he knocks, rocking back and forth on the balls of his feet together to distract himself from the bundle of nerves twisting and untwisting in the pit of his gut. He hopes that Alex comes to the door, but he also kind of half-hopes that he doesn't, if for no reason other than it would soothe the stress currently compounding in his bones. The sound of footsteps padding towards the door causes the ball of nerves to shoot up into his throat, right around where he can also feel his heartbeat threatening to strangle him. Alex calling out a simple \"coming\" only causes the ball to harden into a knot that Apollo knows he won't be able to swallow back down again. At this point, all the courage he sucked up before has abandoned him in blind panic. Alex opens the door with a neutral expression that quickly turns sour just as soon as he sees Apollo standing there. With a hard frown, he tries to slam the door in his face, but Apollo holds his hand up and catches the door before Alex can get it closed. \"Go away,\" Alex shoots at him, tone as angry as the look on his face. \"Wait, Alex--\" \"I said go away, David,\" Alex interrupts through gritted teeth. \"It's, ah... My name isn't David, it's-- it's Apollo,\" Apollo corrects softly. \"Right. Sorry. Apollo. I forgot.\" Alex pushes harder against the door, almost desperate to get it closed and keep Apollo out of his apartment and his life. \"Leave me alone. I don't want to talk to you. Goodbye.\" Apollo, much stronger than Alex could possibly ever dream of being, effortlessly resists his attempts to get the door closed. In a small panic, he offers Alex the bouquet in his hand. \"Wait-- I brought you roses--\" \"I don't want your stupid fucking flowers. Leave me alone.\" \"Alex,\" Apollo tries again, \"please, just-- can we talk?\" \"No, we most definitely cannot. Goodbye Dav-- Apollo.\" Once more, Alex tries to shut the door. He puts more force in this time, to show that he means it, that he wants Apollo to leave his front stoop and leave him alone forever while he's at it, but his efforts are just as fruitless now as they were before. \"Alex.\" The unusually desperate nature of Apollo's voice gets Alex to look up at him with narrow eyes. Apollo can feel his heart in his throat again, and he swallows uneasily around it as he tries to remember how to speak. Finally, he manages a small, \"Please.\" The word comes out as a whisper, but maybe that was for the best. Alex's steely resolve seems much weaker than it was two minutes ago. He opens the door rather than trying to close it again and steps aside, jerking his head towards the interior of the apartment. \"Fine,\" he concedes. His brows are furrowed as he casts another angry glance up at Apollo. \"You can stay and we can talk for ten minutes, but then I want you gone. You got that?\" \"Yeah, I-- I got that,\" Apollo says as he steps inside; he can feel Alex's eyes on his back, but he doesn't entirely mind it. This is the most interaction Apollo has had with him in gods know how long-- he'll take anything he can get. \"Thank you.\" \"Whatever,\" Alex mutters as he closes and bolts the door. Apollo stands in the centre of the small living room and looks around. A weird feeling creeps up his spine as he looks around the apartment they once shared. Some of his things are still scattered about, probably exactly where he left them when Alex told him to leave. He wants to smile at the fact that Alex kept his things and didn't throw them out, but he doesn't think that such a gesture would sit too well with Alex if he did. Apollo offers the roses to Alex again as the pink haired boy moves around him to get to the kitchen, and Alex hesitates before he finally takes them, frowning and his eyes narrowed slightly. Alex doesn't thank him. Apollo watches Alex lay the bouquet on the small kitchen table before he begins to make tea, despite the fact that neither of them like tea very much. The silence makes his throat burn. \"I've missed-- I miss you,\" Apollo finally says, biting the inside of his cheek as soon as the words leave his mouth. He needed to say something to keep this entire visit from being a waste, but in hindsight, maybe picking that to start with wasn't the smartest decision he's ever made. Alex snorts, and Apollo's pretty sure he rolls his eyes too, but he doesn't say anything in response. He just continues watching the water boil, visibly annoyed and frustrated, most likely at the fact that he somehow let Apollo convince him to let him inside. \"Well, I do,\" Apollo forges on. He's already said it, he might as well stick with it. Besides, it's true, and he's nothing if not honest. \"I miss you a lot-- all the time, and I--\" \"And that's your own fucking fault,\" Alex says darkly. His gaze finally flickers towards Apollo, just as hard as it had been at the door. \"You created the problem, and now you're stuck dealing with the consequences, no matter how unpleasant you may find them. And that's not my problem, so please, do me a favour and shut the fuck up about it.\" Apollo stops himself from making a strangled noise in the back of his throat. Alex opens one of the cupboards and begins looking for a cup to make tea in when the water finishes boiling. Things grow quiet; Apollo can hear their breathing underneath the ticking of the clock on the wall and the occasional sound of traffic whirring by outside. The tea kettle whistles. Alex removes a mug from the cupboard. Apollo decides to take a different approach. \"I know I fucked up--\" \"Damn right you fucked up,\" Alex quips as he pours the hot water into a mug (the one that Apollo got him for Christmas, he can't help but notice). Apollo's lips harden into a thin line at Alex's words, but he ignores it. He doesn't want to fight again. He takes a half step towards Alex, who turns to glare at him until he stands still again. Apollo hesitates, then adds, \"I fucked up, and I'm sorry about that, but I want to fix us--\" \"There's nothing to fix, don't you understand that? You lied to me, and--\" \"I never once lied to you,\" Apollo interjects angrily. \"I can't lie to you, I've told you that-- I've only ever told you the truth--\" \"Then why did you tell me your name was David?\" Alex sneers. \"Why lie and not just give me your real name? Are you really so fucking full of yourself that you think you're the only guy on the planet named Apollo?\" \"I thought it would be less suspicious to use David!\" Apollo snaps. Admittedly, he sounded much harsher than he originally intended to, but he isn't about to apologise for that, even if he feels that he should. He closes his eyes and exhales slowly before continuing. \"Look, I'll admit, I did... keep things from you, about myself and my family and whatnot, but I had reasons for that, I told you that, and-- and things changed, Alex, I--\" \"It doesn't fucking matter that things changed, David!\" Alex spits without even bothering to correct himself. Apollo doubts he even noticed his error. Alex turns to glare at him, his eyes burning with a fury Apollo doesn't think he's ever seen in him before now. \"Don't you understand that? It doesn't matter!\" \"Well it should!\" Apollo spits back. He fights the urge to cringe a small bit at the way his voice rises and warps. Gods, he didn't want to argue, yet here he is and here they are, doing exactly that. He fights to keep his voice level as he says, \"It should matter that things changed-- that I changed--\" Alex slams his mug onto the kitchen counter with enough force to send some of its contents sloshing over the rim and onto the fake linoleum. \"It fucking doesn't!\" His voice is high pitched and angry when he speaks next. \"You were using me! You led me on with the intentions to just-- to just drop me once I wasn't useful to you anymore!\" Apollo's nostrils flare in growing frustration. He didn't want this to happen. \"Alex, I've repeatedly said that I'm sorry--\" \"Sorry isn't going to change a fucking thing David-- Apollo, God, whatever the fuck your real name is!\" Alex shouts. \"You used me, and-- and you treated me like shit, and you--\" \"So, what, people can't change? Is that what you're saying?\" Apollo fires off, temples throbbing as his eye no doubt begins burning red. \"So you've obviously never changed from the way you used to be in the past, right? You're still a cheating bitch and a felon-- a murderer nonetheless, according to you, anyway--\" As soon as the words leave his mouth, Apollo immediately regrets it; he knows he crossed several lines in saying that, and he just wants to scoop the words up and swallow them back down. Alex's expression shifts from just pissed off to enraged and hurt. \"Fuck you,\" he hisses. \"God, fuck you! You're such a fucking asshole!\" Apollo takes another step towards Alex as guilt crashes against his chest. \"I'm sorry--\" \"Shut up! Just shut up! I don't want to hear it!\" \"Alex--\" \"Jesus Christ, I told you to shut the fuck up!\" Alex punctuates his statement by throwing his mug directly at Apollo's head. Apollo ducks, just barely missing it, but scalding tea drenches his arm. Luckily he hadn't taken his coat off when he came inside, so it didn't really burn him as much as it just got him wet. The fact that it happened is enough to piss Apollo off, though. Apollo teleports directly in front of Alex, startling him and causing him to curse under his breath. He grabs Alex's wrist and pins it against the wall behind him, and Alex pulls on his wrist. He hits Apollo's chest with his free hand; Apollo grabs his other wrist and pins it beside his head in partnership with the other as a response. Alex glances up at Apollo with hard and angry eyes. \"Let go of me,\" he spits through his teeth. \"Not until I know you won't try to throw shit at me and hit me again,\" Apollo growls back. They're so close together like this, close enough for Apollo to feel Alex's breath when he exhales and smell the fading yet all too familiar scent of lavender soap coming from his skin, and he catches himself staring directly at Alex's mouth. Apollo subconsciously outlines the familiar curve of his lips before he drags his gaze back up to meet Alex's eyes. \"What are you staring at?\" Alex mutters. He still sounds pissed off. It hits Apollo like a truck just how much he wants to kiss Alex. He doesn't think he should want to, considering the fact that Alex just threw a ceramic mug at him-- at his head, no less-- but he does. They've been apart for so long, and he's missed him so much, and now he's got Alex pinned to the wall, hovering over him with their lips less than inches apart. \"Goddammit, answer me, you fucking dick,\" Alex snaps as he once again tries to pry himself from Apollo's grip, and it draws Apollo's gaze from his lips back to his eyes again. \"I'm so sick of you doing this shit.\" It wouldn't be hard for Apollo to kiss Alex. All he would need to do is duck down and close the gap between them to press their lips together. He leans in to do so, but he stops short, hesitant, with his mouth less than inches from Alex's, lips slightly parted. They both go silent, save for the sound of their breathing. Alex finally breaks the silence. \"What are you doing?\" he whispers. Apollo gently squeezes Alex's wrists. \"I was going to-- I wanted to--\" He stops short with his heart beating in his throat. He doesn't know what to say next. \"What?\" Alex sounds exasperated. Apollo can't blame him. \"I... can I kiss you?\" Apollo finally asks in a soft, yet very strained voice. \"Please?\" The question surprises Alex; that much is evident in the way confusion glosses over the anger in his eyes as he glances between Apollo's mouth and his eyes. He wasn't expecting him to ask, and why should he? Apollo hasn't asked to kiss him since their second or third date, which was sometime last year. Hell, Apollo even surprised himself by asking. He's starting to regret asking, though. He can't read Alex's face to figure out what he's thinking. After the initial change from indignation to bewilderment, Alex's expression went back to being guarded, and Apollo has this sinking feeling in his gut telling him that this is Alex's way of saying no. It's disappointing-- to be so close like this only to be rejected-- but there's nothing Apollo can do about it. He starts to let go of Alex's wrists so he can leave before he causes any more trouble, but before he can, he feels a pair of lips press against his own. The suddenness of Alex's kiss surprises Apollo enough to render him incapable of kissing back for several short moments. He certainly wasn't expecting Alex to kiss him, but he's not complaining in the least. The kiss is awkward, uncomfortable, and tense for several long moments. Alex's lips are plush and soft like they've always been, but they're not as inviting as Apollo is used to. It's like he's being apprehensive-- like Alex isn't sure if he wants to kiss him or not. Apollo squeezes his wrists (while his grip is considerably looser, his hand still remains clasped around Alex's wrists, holding him against the wall), digging his fingers gently but firmly into his skin. For some reason, it works. The tension melts away almost entirely, and Alex parts his lips ever so slightly. Apollo hesitantly runs his tongue along the seam of his lips; when he gets a soft sigh in response, he takes advantage of the opportunity being presented to him to tilt his head to the side just enough for him to easily slide his tongue into Alex's mouth. The action earns him a pleased little noise-- Apollo relishes in it, mostly because he was afraid that he would never get to hear it again. He lets go of one of Alex's wrists. He reaches down with his now-free hand to trace his fingertips along Alex's jaw as he kisses him. Apollo gently brushes the pad of his thumb over Alex's chin, the tip of his thumb lightly brushing against the edge of Alex's bottom lip, and tilts his chin up so he can kiss him better. They easily find their rhythm, one they've spent a year perfecting, with lips slotting together effortlessly and turning their kiss from gentle to desperate in a short matter of minutes. \"God--\" Alex breaks the kiss with a soft gasp. Their lips brush together as he speaks, and it takes all of Apollo's self restraint not to close the gap between them again and kiss Alex until he really can't breathe anymore. He watches as Alex's lips form the words, \"You're so fucking stupid, you know that?\" \"I know, Alexander, I know,\" Apollo whispers back. \"And I'm so sorry--\" Alex cuts him off like he isn't even listening to him speak. \"You're so stupid and-- and-- and insensitive and goddammit, you're such an asshole-- but fuck, I--\" Alex's lips return to his again, kissing him almost hungrily this time. Apollo feels Alex grab his collar and pull him closer to him. He slides his own hand from Alex's chin to his hip, and he pulls him closer as he kisses him harder than he was before. He nips his teeth at his bottom lip; the pink haired boy lets out a weak, indiscernible sound before he pulls away again, breathless. \"But I don't hate you,\" Alex pants, picking up where his previous statement left off. \"I know you think I do, and trust me, I want to hate you-- with every fibre of my being I really do want to hate your guts, but I don't --\" He interrupts himself to press their lips together once more, but he doesn't keep his mouth against Apollo's for long. \"And I missed you, so incredibly much-- and I hate that I did, but I-- I fucking missed you, Davey.\" Alex's words halt with a gasp after Apollo dips his head down to press open-mouthed kisses along his jaw, tongue swirling over the dark red mark he sucks into his skin. He's met with a soft moan-like noise as Alex moves his hand from his collar to his neck. He feels Alex's nails scrape over the back of his neck, and Apollo can't help but notice the way Alex's head falls back against the wall to expose more of his throat. He finally releases Alex's other wrist and moves his hand to his other hip as well, gently squeezing as soon as his fingers curl around his waist. \"I missed you too bubblegum,\" Apollo whispers. He drags his teeth over his throat, and he can feel Alex's pulse jump under his tongue when he does. \"Gods, I missed you.\" Neither say another word, so Apollo sets about creating another mark to decorate his neck, taking his time in doing so just to be able to listen to all the pretty noises Alex makes. He pulls Alex's hips towards him to press them closer to one another because they're not close enough, there's too much space between their bodies after being apart for so long and it's driving Apollo insane-- he craves feeling Alex pressed against him. Apollo just barely finishes the hickey before Alex knots his fingers in Apollo's hair and pulls his head back from his neck. Apollo looks up to meet his eyes, and his breath stutters when he notices how blown Alex's pupils are. Alex leans forward and brushes their lips together without kissing him. \"Please-- my room--\" As if he needs to be told twice. Apollo slides his hands from Alex's hips to the back of his thighs, and his fingers hook around his legs. He lifts Alex up rather easily and closes the gap between their mouths once more. Alex wraps his legs around his waist and secures his ankles together as Apollo carries him down the short hallway leading to his room, squeezing his thighs against Apollo's sides and grinding against him rather needily as the god bites down on his lip. Apollo smirks a little bit at how hard Alex already feels. When they get to the little bedroom at the end of the hall, Apollo wastes no time in laying Alex down and pressing him against the mattress. They kiss for a while, but Apollo eventually leans up to take his coat off before he moves his lips to Alex's throat. He kisses over the marks he had made earlier, lips light as a feather as they ghost over Alex's skin. Alex moans weakly beneath him. Apollo smiles at the sound and pushes his hands under the shirt Alex wears, fingers splayed over his skin. His fingers roam over Alex's chest and stomach as he goes lower, kissing down, down, down until his lips meet metal and he's mouthing at the buckle on Alex's belt. Alex inhales sharply. Apollo looks up when he notices the way that Alex's chest sort of stutters under his hand, a grin splitting across his lips. He inches down even further, mouth level with his crotch, and he presses an open-mouthed kiss against the fabric of Alex's jeans with a soft hum. Alex softly gasps, breath stuttering again, his hand going to Apollo's shoulder. His fingers dig in, grip weak, as he pushes his hips up. \"God-- Apollo-- b-blow me?\" Alex's whisper echoes in the room, the words phrased as a question, hesitant and uncertain. Alex knows very well how much of a tease his (ex?)boyfriend can be, and Apollo picks up on his unsure tone-- but for once, he decides to give Alex what he asks for without making him beg for ages to get it. Apollo doesn't say anything in response; he only removes his hands from Alex's shirt and unbuckles his belt, fingers fumbling slightly. As he does, Apollo scatters kisses along Alex's hips and waist like afterthoughts, small and gentle, yet they still make Alex whine loud enough to disturb the people in the neighbouring apartments. Eventually, Apollo gets the belt loose. He has less trouble popping the button, taking the little clasp of the zipper into his mouth afterwards and slowly-- because he is still an incessant tease at heart-- pulling it down with his teeth. Alex mumbles some weak noise at the minute vibration the zipper causes against him, but Apollo doesn't hear him. He's too busy with yanking Alex's jeans down. He presses a wet, open-mouthed kiss to the fabric of Alex's boxer-briefs covering his dick, eliciting a moan from the other, before stripping him of those as well, and he runs his fingers along Alex's legs as he moves his hands back up to his hips to secure them in place against the mattress. Apollo bites his lip and glances up at Alex. He's always thought that Alex is stunning from this angle-- chest and stomach on display, both heaving as he pants to breathe, and it's so pretty, so delicious, even, that Apollo licks his lips and-- \"Oh my God --\" Alex gasps when he feels Apollo's mouth close around the tip of his dick. Apollo's fingers tighten on his hips as Alex tries to push them up, holding him firmly in place against the mattress. He feels Alex's fingers squeeze harder at his shoulder in response before moving into his hair as Apollo sinks down, cheeks hollowed out, tongue pressed against him. He doesn't stop until his nose presses against the skin of Alex's groin; he stays still for a long moment, breathing slowly and closing his eyes before he begins to bob his head (slowly, always slowly). Alex cries out when he starts, pulling Apollo's hair and straining uselessly against the god's hands. Apollo moans softly, and the gentle vibrations he creates cause Alex to whimper, the noise almost embarrassingly loud in the small room. Apollo opens his eyes again and directs his gaze upwards. As he had hoped, Alex is watching him-- eyes hooded, mouth slightly ajar-- and he groans when their eyes meet. \"Ah-- fuck, God, ohhhh my God -- babe-- just-- please-- \" Alex cuts himself off with a throaty whine, desperate and needy, as he once again tries unsuccessfully to push his hips up. Apollo hums in response to the pink haired boy's cry. He pulls back, sucking on the head of Alex's cock, swirling his tongue for good measure, before pulling off completely. \"What?\" Apollo asks. His voice is soft, almost innocent-- he's good at this, and he knows it. He repositions his hand to press his thumb in the crease between Alex's thigh and hip, dipping his head down to lick teasingly at his dick. \"What do you want?\" Alex groans his name, and the sound of it makes Apollo grin, his body tingling and warm with something that isn't necessarily arousal. It's something just as pleasant, though, kind of like l-- He pushes the thought way, way down before it has time to fully form, and Alex tightens the already steel-like grip he has on Apollo's hair. \"Want-- want you,\" comes his whimpered reply. \"Want you to fuck me, hard, please-- God, make me scream, I-- ohh-- \" Apollo swallows him back down again before he can finish his sentence. This time, however, the god wastes no time in immediately taking Alex to the back of his throat and keeping him there. He closes his eyes as he listens to the quick breaths Alex pants out. Apollo swallows around him, and Alex blurts out some warbled expletive, louder than the immortal thinks he meant to, and arches his back. If Apollo could smile, he would. He's always loved that, thought it was hot as hell when Alex got loud-- and Apollo knows that Alex is only going to get louder from here out, because he has absolutely no concept of volume control. Apollo stays still for several more moments. Alex breathes out little moans, his fingers loose and then tight and then loose again, alternating, in his hair. Apollo starts to pull off again at the boy's insistence for him to \"move, fuck-- please.\" He moves slow and makes damn sure that his tongue is pressed hard against the underside of Alex's cock, putting pressure on a vein that's going to make Alex choke on his air. Sure enough, Alex's head falls back against the mattress again with a strangled noise half trapped in his throat, desperately attempting to claw its way out. Apollo moans, more for Alex's benefit than anything, sucking lazily as he finishes coming up, far too vulgar to be allowed. After what feels like years but is more like a matter of minutes, Apollo pulls off once and for all. The wet pop reverberates in the bedroom. Alex looks down again (he always looks down, he loves to watch), just in time to watch Apollo press a gentle kiss against the tip, and the god smirks at his breathless gasp. \"Whatever you want bubblegum,\" he rasps. Apollo shifts and leans up to mouth at Alex's hip. He sucks a light red mark into his skin, and the red mark turns into a line of gentle kisses spanning across Alex's waist to his other hip. With each kiss, Alex emits a soft whimper, the sound a muted one that lets Apollo know that Alex is biting his lip in an attempt to keep quiet. That's not going to work for long, Apollo thinks to himself as his mouth moves from Alex's hip to the skin directly above his belly button. Alex pulls at Apollo's hair, almost pulling him upwards, like he's urging him to hurry up and reach his mouth so that they can kiss again. Apollo obliges easily. As their lips meet, he adds to his thought: you never can keep quiet, no matter what you do. But then they're kissing, and all of Apollo's thoughts on Alex's inability to remain quiet dissipate. He can't focus on them, not when he can focus instead on the way Alex slides his hands under his shirt, fingers grabbing at his shoulders after pulling the shirt over his head and tossing it somewhere across the room. It's when Alex digs his nails into his ribs that it registers in Apollo's brain that they're both wearing too much clothes-- he's still in his jeans, and Alex is still in his shirt. Apollo pushes the hem of the other boy's shirt up again, grinning at the startled gasp Alex gives him when he brushes the pads of his thumbs over the boy's nipples before Apollo pulls his shirt off of him. \"That's better,\" Apollo mumbles, almost absentmindedly, into his mouth when their lips meet again. \"Almost,\" Alex corrects, rapid fire. He breaks from the kiss again, eyes trained on Apollo's lips for a few moments, and his hands go to the immortal's belt. Alex pulls on the buckle. \"You're still in these. Take 'em off. Now.\" \"Someone's awfully demanding,\" Apollo teases, and Alex whines for him to \"hurry up so you can fuck me,\" but he's already gotten his pants off by then. Apollo kicks his jeans off of the edge of the bed to land on top of the ones he'd stripped Alex of earlier, and Alex's legs encircle his waist once they're both naked. Alex wraps his arms around Apollo's back to grab more firmly at his shoulders and grinds his hips up now that there's nothing holding him down. Apollo, who had ducked his head down to kiss Alex's neck some more, groans at the way their cocks slide against each other. Alex's nails dig into his skin, pulling him down more. Apollo kisses him, and Alex bites greedily at Apollo's lip, sucking it into his mouth to hide his own moan. Alex's neediness makes Apollo's head spin. They're skin on skin with no room between them, and all Apollo can think while they're close together like this is how he was afraid that he would never get this again-- never again get to feel Alex rutting his hips up against him, desperate for even the smallest of touches; never again get to hear Alex moan his name (and he certainly never thought he would get to hear Alex moan his real name); never again get to-- Alex groaning in frustration cuts through his thoughts. \"God, Apollo, just-- just fuck me already,\" he pants, whiny, desperate. \"It's been weeks-- now isn't the time for you to be an eternal goddamn tease--\" Although Apollo laughs softly at his words, he can't deny the way his dick had throbbed at Alex's tone of voice, especially when Alex had said his name. The throbbing sensation travels upwards to settle in his pelvis, and he grinds his hips down, drawing a moan from Alex's mouth, before Apollo slides his hands along his sides until they reach his hips. One hand creeps lower, between Alex's legs, to press his fingers against his perineum briefly (but it's still enough to make Alex's breath catch completely in his throat) before finding way to his hole. Before Apollo can push a finger in, though, Alex stops him. At first, he's confused as to why, then he assumes it's because he forgot the lube. Again. Apollo has a bad habit of that. Mumbling, the god apologises, \"Right, sorry bubblegum--\" Apollo leans over to open the nightstand drawer he knows the lube is stashed away in, but Alex grabs his wrist before he can reach it. Apollo stops and looks down at him, brows knitted together, confused. Alex stares back up at him with wide and innocently sinful eyes. There's a churn in Apollo's gut that crashes against his abdomen, multiplying with the sensation from before, and he inhales deep through his nose to keep from groaning. \"No,\" Alex whispers. He guides Apollo's hand back between his legs, and he directs his gaze downwards for a moment. He pushes his hips up, rubbing their cocks together again with a little whimper, desperate for friction, then looks back up at Apollo. \"Don't waste your time with prep. I don't need lube-- don't even need a condom-- just need you, inside of me. Now. Please. \" Apollo's breath catches in his throat. \"But I have to prep--\" \"I don't need it,\" Alex whines, careful to enunciate his words clearly, each one grating against his throat in a way that makes Apollo dizzy, \"I just need you, now-- please Dav-- Apollo, fuck. Me. Fuck me.\" His voice drops to a whiny yet seductive whisper. \"Fuck me, now.\" Apollo blinks, speechless, unsure what to say or do. They've never skipped prep in the past, nor have they neglected to use lube and protection; Alex was pretty insistent that they use it all, actually, because it made him feel better, safer, when they had sex-- sometimes even for oral. So this is... new, coming from Alex. But the way he's looking at Apollo, his eyes dark, even darker than usual, with want-- with need, even-- and the way he grinds his hips up again, grunting \"please, please-- fuck, \" quickly makes Apollo's mind up for him. Once again, Apollo declares \"whatever you want bubblegum\" before he uses the grip he has on Alex's hips to angle him better, to make it easier to go in. The little smile that Alex gives him after he repositions him sends butterflies shooting into Apollo's chest, and he smiles back while simultaneously trying to squash down the fluttering in his ribcage. That's the last thing he needs right now; he doesn't want-- doesn't need to think about the implications of what that might mean-- which is nothing, because that's exactly what it means. It doesn't mean anything... maybe. No, fuck, it doesn't. Definitely not. Not again. Apollo growls softly at his own swirling train of thought and leans down to kiss him again. Alex makes a soft noise in response to the low rumble that emits from the back of Apollo's throat, and it's a noise that quickly multiplies in volume when Apollo sucks his lip into his mouth. He knows Alex has a thing for lip biting-- sucking too-- and has known for months now, so he decides to capitalise on that. He bites down hard, hard, harder, until Alex can't breathe without making some kind of throaty noise, each one tripping over the one before it to tumble into Apollo's mouth. Apollo takes advantage of his distraction to line himself up with Alex's hole. Alex lets out a shuddering little breath when he feels the head of Apollo's cock brush against him, almost like he's testing the waters, to see if this is really what Alex wants. When nothing else happens, he huffs against the god's mouth. \"Goddammit Apollo, if you don't hurry the fuck up I'm going to flip us and ri--\" The rest of Alex's sentence is swallowed whole by a sharp, choked off gasp from the back of his throat as Apollo pushes in. \"Oh fuck-- oh fuck-- oh fuck-- \" The words come out in a pain-drenched moan, but they don't stop there. Alex spits a string of vulgarities through his teeth and arches his back up off the mattress, his nails digging almost painfully into Apollo's shoulders. He scrunches his face up and sucks his stomach in. His actions are a concentrated effort to draw himself up and away from the pain; it's hard for Apollo not to notice it. The immortal fits his mouth against the curve of Alex's neck, sucking on it to distract him, and he gently caresses his thumb over Alex's hips, so he can sap as much pain from him as he possibly can. Apollo reaches down between them, wraps his hand around Alex's dick to lazily jerk him off with the hopes that it forces his body to focus on the pleasure and not the pain, and continues pushing in until their skin is flush against one another-- and then he stops. Alex is still but not silent as his body gets used to the way Apollo feels inside of him. His breaths come out short and jagged, broken up only by long drawn out moans that send tingling sensations rippling down Apollo's spine. But Alex doesn't stay still for long; he groans and wraps his leg around the back of Apollo's thigh, then shoves him closer and deeper inside of himself with a short gasp. \" Move, \" he chokes, broken, a soft groan on the edge of his lips. \"Please-- need-- \" Instead of words, what comes out of Alex's mouth next is a filthy whimper. Apollo moves, slow and gentle so he doesn't hurt the pink haired boy underneath him. The resulting moans Alex makes are uncomfortable-sounding on some level or another. Apollo almost feels bad for him, since he knows this isn't the most... pleasant feeling in the world (not yet, anyway). He holds his breath, waiting for Alex to tell him to stop, that it hurts, because Alex is whining like it's too painful to deal with, but no such statement ever interrupts the steady flow of whimpers coming from his mouth. Apollo breathes out a small sigh of relief after several minutes and dips his head down to kiss between Alex's collarbones. Apollo presses his tongue against the flat, smooth plane of Alex's skin as he very hesitantly increases the speed of his thrusts. Alex mewls; Apollo notices that the discomfort in his voice is slowly melting away. Alex relaxes even more, which makes it easier for the both of them to actually enjoy the sex they're having. Apollo doesn't try to go faster or harder, though, at least not yet. This is still their first time bareback together-- he doesn't want to push Alex's limits too far too soon. Sticking to what he knows works, Apollo drops his mouth lower on Alex's chest, littering kisses from his collarbone downwards before finally attaching his mouth to one of Alex's nipples. Alex gasps a weak \" fuck \" at the contact, the sound soft and wispy, but still audible nonetheless. Apollo sucks on his nipple, his mouth and tongue cold, eyes closed while Alex suffocates the room with a chorus of porn-worthy moans. The hand not on Alex's hip reaches up to tweak his other nipple, and Alex chokes on the neediest sound Apollo has ever heard him make whilst digging his heels into the mattress and arching his hips into Apollo's. Apollo opens his eyes to gaze up at Alex then; he has his head to the side, teeth bared against the moans he's expelling and nose scrunched up in that (really really cute) way he sometimes scrunches his nose up when they have sex. Apollo makes a soft noise at the sight of him before he pulls his mouth off of Alex's chest. Alex whines unhappily at the loss, his mouth opening slightly and his fingernails digging into Apollo's back, while the god drags his lips, teeth, and tongue along the column of his throat before detaching them from his lover's skin altogether. Apollo guides his hand from Alex's chest to his throat, fingers pressing firmly against soft flesh there immediately as they come into contact with it, his thumb hooked under the outline of his jaw. He pushes against the side of his jaw to force Alex to look up at him. Apollo leans in to kiss Alex, his hand still (more or less) wrapped around his throat. He pushes their tongues against one another and graciously swallows the muffled set of moans that Alex starts to feed into his mouth as soon as their lips touch. Alex moves his hand from Apollo's shoulder to his hair, and he twists strands of the immortal's hair around his fingers. He pulls on Apollo's hair to make him break away and stop kissing him. \"More,\" Alex groans. Their lips brush together as he speaks. He rocks his hips down just a little to meet Apollo mid-thrust, adding, \"Moremoremore, please, I need more, I need you, need it fff-- fuck me, oh my Godddhngh-- faster and harder and-- and--\" before his voice catches mid-sentence and tapers off into a moan. \"Is that really what you want?\" Apollo asks through his teeth, his lips now pressed to Alex's ear, voice strained, a slight growl peeking through the edges of his words. Alex whines loudly and shivers ever so slightly at the feeling of Apollo's breath against his skin. \"Yes,\" he pants. \"Apollo-- yes-- fuck-- yes--\" He keeps chanting \"yesfuckyesfuck -- don't stop \" through a plethora of pleasured cries, his chest arching upwards into Apollo's as he's given exactly what he asked for. Apollo slides his hand from Alex's neck to his other hip. With fingers pressed into Alex's skin hard enough to leave bruises blooming against the sweaty paleness of his flesh, Apollo pulls Alex towards him each time he snaps his hips forward. Alex mewls pathetically before he begins to curl his hips into Apollo's on his own; after that, each noise that grates past Alex's lips is in sync with the rhythm of their hips. Alex untangles his fingers from Apollo's hair with a desperate moan of his name, and he shifts one of his legs upwards to wrap around Apollo's waist. As he does, he wraps his free hand around his own dick. Apollo feels him dig his nails into his shoulder and pull him closer to him as he sloppily starts to jerk himself off. Alex whimpers, desperate and craving something, anything that will send him over the edge. While Alex chokes on his air, garbled words and various noises clogging his throat as he fists his cock, Apollo attaches his mouth to the pink haired boy's jaw, his tongue pressed against sweaty skin as he bites down, sucking and leaving behind a bright red blossom on the underside of his jaw. Alex groans, needy and much louder than he should be, considering how late it is, and Apollo laughs softly against the hickey. \"And to think, I had almost forgotten how much of a loud little bitch you are, bubblegum,\" he teases. His voice is dark and sultry, and he revels in the whorish moan that bypasses Alex's lips. \"Fuck you-- God, fuck you, you're not off the hook yet you bastard, I'm still so fucking mad at you, y'know, I--\" Alex stops mid-sentence with a sharp inhale as Apollo rams deeper inside of him. \"I'm pretty sure I can get you to forgive me, sweet thing.\" \"You-- you're-- fucking-- fuck-- fuck, David--\" \"That's not my real name, sweetheart,\" Apollo murmurs. Alex groans. \"God-- I don't fucking care what your real name is, just, please-- please, don't stop, don't stop -- need-- you, I need you --\" Alex tosses his head back and his hips up with a shaky moan. A shudder slowly works its way through his muscles, and he clenches his jaw, but not so much so that he's unable to cry out for Apollo anymore. Apollo hungrily darts his tongue over his grinning, swollen lips as he eyes the exposed skin of Alex's throat. He brings his mouth to hover over Alex's pulse, yet not once looking away from his face. His mouth lingers there for a few moments, his breath washing over Alex's throat, before he finally bites down, hard, harder than he has any time before. Alex yelps. The sound warps in his mouth, morphing into a noisy groan before it becomes Apollo's name, drawn out and sticky against his teeth. Apollo squeezes his hips in response. He growls against his skin, eyes closed, tongue pressed hard against the salty sweat he tastes. Alex flicks his wrist-- whether or not it was unintentional or on purpose is unknown-- and twists his hand. He groans again. \"David,\" Alex whimpers. Apollo lets it slide this time without correcting him. \"Please, I need-- please --\" \"What?\" Apollo pulls back, a thin line of spit delicately connecting his lips and Alex's neck. \"What do you need?\" Alex doesn't respond. He's far too busy meeting Apollo's hips and jerking off to try and form a coherent thought, let alone voice a clear answer. Apollo hums. He noses along Alex's jaw, kisses the side of his mouth before he pulls away completely to hover over and stare down at him. Alex catches and returns his gaze, hooded eyes almost entirely black with arousal, his irises swallowed by his pupils, which are blown wide, ink against chocolate. Apollo's voice drops impossibly low, his words merely a low rumble echoing from the back of his throat. \"Pretty boy needs to come? Is that what you need?\" Another full body shudder racks Alex as he nods frantically, and it makes Apollo feel hot all over, burning coils settling in his pelvis at the knowledge of the effect he has on his boy. \"Yes-- p-please,\" Alex stutters. His voice is high pitched, almost splintered. \"Please, I--\" He's shushed by several kisses pressing against his lips. Despite the kisses moving behind his ear, his broken pleas still come in spades. Alex mewls, keening into the soft touch of the god's lips on his skin, his muscles tensing up. Apollo picks up his pace, and he shoves in deeper, much faster than he had been a few minutes prior. Alex cries out for him repeatedly, the breaths he's gasping into his lungs becoming shorter and choppier with each passing moment. He digs his nails into Apollo's shoulder. Apollo groans; his fingers tighten on Alex's hips and he pins them back down against the mattress before he speaks. \"Then why,\" he purrs darkly, and Alex whimpers, squeezing his dick in his hand, \"don't you come for me, Alexander?\" Apollo grins, and Alex grunts a sharp expletive through his teeth. Apollo breathes out a soft groan and hides his face in the boy's neck as, with an explosive whine, Alex arches his back and comes, weakly rutting his hips up into his hand and Apollo's hips as well, heels scraping against the sheets as he screws his eyes shut tight. All of his muscles slowly unlock themselves one by one. He moans as he jerks himself through his orgasm, muttering things ranging from his god's name to various expletives; to muffle the cries coming from his parted lips, Alex bites hard on his lip. His nails drag down Apollo's shoulder blade, and several angry red lines welt up on Apollo's skin in their wake. Apollo doesn't even notice them. Alex slowly relaxes, and he finally sinks back down into the mattress, loose and pliable. When Alex pulls his lip from his teeth, Apollo sees blood glistening on his skin in the faint moonlight that's streaming in from the window above their bed. He leans down to suck on the wound; Alex whimpers softly as Apollo presses his tongue to his lip to heal the tear in his skin. Alex's hand goes from his dick to the sheets, first to shakily wipe it clean and then, as the immortal starts grinding his hips into him again-- Apollo had decided to stop moving while Alex came, but now that he's finished, there's no reason for him to remain still anymore-- to grip the sheets so tight that his knuckles turn white. Apollo picks up right where he had left off, with deep and hard thrusts into Alex's arching hips, making the pink haired boy whine. Alex lets his head falls to the side, his lips parted so that his grunted noises easily leave him, and an all-too-familiar light pink blush dusts his cheeks, as it always does when they fuck. Apollo slides his hand from Alex's hip to wrap around his thigh, grip firm, prying his legs further apart than they previously were; spreading his legs even more presents Apollo with the opportunity to press in deeper. He doesn't stop pushing in until he's sure that Alex can feel the gentle sloping curve of his hip bones against the soft flesh of his ass. Alex whimpers not so softly, and Apollo digs his fingers into his skin and snaps his hips forward with a grin. Alex cries out and squirms every time Apollo moves inside of him, hypersensitive, his fingers twitching against the god's back and his legs spasming. Apollo can feel his thighs shaking a little at his side and in his hand. His fingernails prick Alex's skin, and he knows that there are going to be bruises in the shape of his fingers to spring up on Alex's thighs as well as on his hips once they've finished fucking. He likes that, and he doubts the boy will mind-- Alex has always liked the physical markers of their sex; this should be no different. Alex groans not so softly, and he pulls hard at the sheets, which are twisted tight around his fist. His nails bite into Apollo's back; he pulls him closer. Apollo hisses quietly by the edge of the boy's jaw, his teeth knocking against flesh stretched tight over bone. He runs his hand from Alex's hip and over his ribs to stop by his shoulder. He pushes himself up, poised above him. Alex turns to look up at him-- his eyes are hooded and slightly unfocused. He unravels the sheets wound up in his fist, and he moves his arm to halo his head, hand laid near where Apollo's hand also rests in the pillows. Apollo smiles down at him a little bit. His eyes flicker over the way Alex looks with his sweaty, bright pink bangs plastered to his forehead, the rest of his hair sticking up in all directions from the amount of thrashing he's doing. His mouth hangs open in a small, silent 'O'; the 'O' grows wider when Alex throws his head back and arches up against Apollo's hips, a loud moan breaking from the centre of his chest to beat back at them. Apollo allows his gaze to sink lower, over the boy's heaving red chest and sticky white stomach, to Alex's hips. They're slick and glisten with the mix of their sweat when the light catches his skin. Pretty, Apollo thinks. His eyes return to Alex's face and neck-- especially neck. The shadows make the hickies and bite marks look darker than they really are, appearing more purplish than red, but Apollo likes that. The whole point of sucking and biting Alex's throat like that was to bruise him, after all. While the immortal admires him, Alex clenches the hand above his head into a fist, and his nails dig into his palm; his eyes roll back into his head for a few short seconds. He bites his lip again, his tongue pressed against the spot where Apollo had healed him. He's already semi-hard again, something that Apollo can feel as their bodies slide against one another each time he moves. \"You're hot when you're like this, you know that?\" Apollo groans softly. \"Like what?\" Alex finally pants. \"Like, y'know--\" Apollo stops to punctuate his grunted \"-- this\" with a sharp snap of his hips. Alex yelps at the sudden sharpness of the thrust. \"Being fucked.\" Alex closes his eyes and tilts his head back, the yelp from a few seconds earlier melting into a groan at the immortal's words. The thrust was hard enough to push him up in the pillows; his head had almost knocked against the headboard, and Apollo used his tight grip on his leg to pull Alex back towards him after he noticed it. \"Yeah?\" Alex whines, high in his throat. When he opens his eyes again, he catches Apollo's gaze and holds it as he speaks. \"You really-- hnnnnghgnfuck -- y'really think so?\" Apollo grins. He squeezes Alex's thigh, and his smile widens at the soft noise that Alex makes in response. \"Mm, of course I do Alex-- I can't lie to you, remember?\" he murmurs. \"You're always hot when you're taking dick, pretty boy. Especially mine.\" Alex groans again. He turns his head to the side, pushing his hips up off of the mattress as he does. Despite him turning away, Apollo can still see the way Alex's cheeks shift from flushing pale pink to burning a bright hot scarlet in the dark, obviously flustered at the god's words-- as he usually is when Apollo starts talking dirty-filthy like this. Alex's semi becomes a full hard on. The friction of their bodies pries another deep moan up from the depths of Alex's chest and out into the room, where it curls around them like smoke. \"Oh,\" Alex whimpers simply. \"I-- thank you-- hhnnnnhhfghfh --\" He sounds breathless, and it isn't like Apollo can blame him-- he's very aware of the fact that he's a good fuck (better than just good, actually, but he doesn't want to sound too full of himself), and it's not unusual for Apollo to leave his partners breathless. Alex is no exception-- that's what 3000-plus years of practice in the fine art of intercourse does for a guy. But that's not the point. The point is that Alex is breathless, and he's gasping out Apollo's name every time he draws in a breath; his teeth are clenched against his broken words, as if he's trying to keep how wrecked he sounds locked tight inside of his mouth. It doesn't work in the least. Alex looks and sounds like he's shattering. Apollo finds it beautiful. Alex's voice is more splintered than it was five minutes ago. Tears form in the corners of his eyes, and they threaten to spill over and onto his cheeks every time their bodies meet in a collision of skin and faint slapping sounds. Alex blinks a few times to try and rid himself of the tears, but it doesn't work, and he settles on closing his eyes once more to combat the urge to cry from all the stimulation-- it's so much, probably more than he's ever felt in his life, and the burn of Apollo moving inside of him hurts but it's so good, God it's such a good burn and he can't get enough of it (at least, that's what Apollo picks up in the tone of the whimpered mewls that slide from between Alex's teeth every other minute or so). Alex's hand unclenches and inches towards his scalp. He twists strands of his own hair around his fingers, but he doesn't pull. Instead, he just lets his hand sit there, fingers tight, until Apollo thrusts slow and he practically stops. Alex opens his eyes again; his hand goes limp against the top of his head. \"N-no, don't-- don't stop,\" he groans. Apollo feels the hand on his back traverse his skin to grab at his lower back as Alex speaks. \"Babe-- don't stop, please, A-- ah--\" Alex's statement erupts into a sob. Apollo digs his hips in deep, almost like he's trying to carve parts of Alex's body out one little piece at a time so that they fit together even more perfectly, and Alex's cry breaks from him in the form of a choked plea for something unintelligible. He grips his hair again and pulls, hard. The tears welling in Alex's eyes finally spill over, sliding down the sides of his face at the same time that his cock begins leaking precome. There's a weak sting that stretches from the base of Apollo's spine to his left hip, and he can only assume that it's due to Alex dragging his nails through his skin again. The sobs coming from Alex's lips die off after a few minutes. They turn into obscenely loud moans instead, and Alex shifts to wrap his legs around Apollo's abdomen, ankles locked together at his back. His muscles tense again. Apollo's hand glides over his skin, his nails lightly scraping against the pink haired boy's flesh as he makes his way to Alex's dick. Apollo wraps his fingers around him; his hand is cold, and Alex gasps in surprise, an expletive tangled up on his tongue, and arches his chest up into the god above him in response. Apollo smirks as he slowly jerks Alex off. Alex stutters out several moans in a row as Apollo pumps him, and he lets his head fall to the side, fingers tight in his hair again. Apollo makes out a few more tears sliding down the side of his face in the silvery wisps of light streaming in from the window. They compliment the way Alex's chest heaves as he starts to cry again. This time, the tears last for a while. Each time Apollo snaps his hips forward, Alex makes some pathetic whimpery noise from the back of his throat and a few more tears slide out, only they trace the curve of his nose instead of leaving glistening tracks from his eyes to his hairline. When Alex turns back to face Apollo, they go back to disappearing in his hair again. Apollo leans down and presses a gentle kiss to the side of Alex's left eye. \"I've never seen you cry during sex before, bubblegum,\" he whispers, his breath hot. His lips brush against Alex's wet skin as he speaks. \"It's kinda hot, y'know.\" Alex whimpers and keens up into Apollo's hand. \"Yeah, well you-- fuck, hnnnnghgGod-- you've never fucked me quite like this before e-either,\" he pants. \"God Apollo, it's-- it's so fucking much, and-- and it feels so g-- ah-- ah --\" Apollo cuts Alex off by brushing his thumb over the slit in the head of his cock, and he twists his wrist while he's at it. Alex chokes on his breath as he bucks his hips up. When Apollo moves his thumb, more precome dribbles out and over his fingers. He looks down, his eyes lingering for a few seconds before he looks back up at Alex, whose face is contorted in pleasure, and then down at his dick again. Apollo grins. Apollo releases Alex's dick only to reach up and grab his chin. He stops moving; Alex whines and pushes his hips down, desperate for some kind of stimulation. The movement causes Apollo to groan softly as Alex lets go of his hair to grab Apollo's shoulder. \"Apollo,\" Alex whines pathetically. \"Move--\" Apollo cuts him off by shoving his thumb into Alex's mouth. \"Shhhhhh,\" he whispers, pushing down on Alex's tongue. Alex makes a small noise and his eyelids droop. \"No more talking, baby. Just watch me. I know you like to.\" Apollo pulls out in a single swift movement, and Alex whimpers quietly, unhappy at the empty feeling settling hollowly in his chest. Regardless, he begins sucking on Apollo's thumb as the god kisses down his body. Apollo feels the bed shift ever so slightly; he feels the hand on his shoulder disappear moments later. He glances up to meet Alex's gaze in the dark so that he knows Alex is watching him and finds that Alex had pushed himself up onto his elbows so that it would be easier to watch Apollo. When their eyes meet, Alex whimpers softly. Without any warning and without breaking eye contact, Apollo pulls his thumb out of Alex's mouth the very moment he takes Alex's cock into his mouth. Alex gasps, jumbling different expletives up in his mouth, and pushes his hips up. The action forces more of his dick into Apollo's mouth, and he gladly takes it. As Apollo begins to bob his head, Alex moans, letting his head fall to the side. Apollo stops bobbing just as quickly as he'd started. He reaches up and grabs Alex's chin again. Apollo forces the boy to look at him, and he says, \"I told you to watch me, so I expect you to watch me, Alexander.\" \"'M sorry Apollo, I--\" Apollo pushes two of his fingers into Alex's mouth. \"I also told you to stop talking.\" When Alex offers only a small moan in response, Apollo hums. He dips his head down to give a teasing lick along the shaft of Alex's dick. Alex pushes his hips up with a straining whine, but he doesn't look away. The god smiles. \"Good boy,\" he praises. \"Now watch me. And don't stop watching me.\" Apollo takes Alex's cock back into his mouth to the sound of Alex groaning quietly around his fingers. He reaches up to wrap his free hand around Alex's thigh to hold him in place while he blows him, and Alex hooks his knees over Apollo's shoulders. Apollo feels Alex's heels digging into his back, right under his shoulder blades. He pays it no mind. Instead, he swallows around Alex's cock and sinks down until he feels him hit the back of his throat. Apollo pauses long enough to breathe before he begins to bob his head again. Alex chokes on a groan, the sound muffled in his mouth. His head falls back on his shoulders, and he curls his hands into fists by his side. Apollo pushes down on Alex's tongue. Alex gags just a little, and Apollo forces him to tilt his chin back down and look him in the eyes again. He stops and digs his fingernails into Alex's thigh, a warning for Alex to keep his eyes on him. Alex whimpers out a noise of submission, and Apollo moans in response. The vibrations travel from Alex's dick to spread through the rest of his bones. Alex groans softly; Apollo feels Alex's heels dig into his back as he pushes his hips up again. Apollo takes it with another moan, this time of appreciation. A hissed curse slips past Alex's lips into the room, getting lost in the moonlight and the sucking sound coming from between the boy's legs. Apollo pulls back and swirls his tongue around the head of Alex's cock to clear it of all the precome. Alex bucks his hips up in an effort to force his dick back in Apollo's mouth like it was before and receives an admonishing smack against his thigh in return. He yelps in pain-- as much as he can, anyway, with two fingers halfway down his throat, gagging him. Apollo presses his tongue against the slit in Alex's cock before he pulls his fingers out of the pink haired boy's mouth. Alex barely has time to miss them before Apollo shoves them inside of his ass. They slide in easily thanks to the coating of spit that came from being in Alex's mouth. \"Oh, fuck-- my God, Apollo --\" Apollo exhales slowly when he feels Alex grab a fistful of his hair and yank on it. A quick glance up shows him that Alex once again let his head fall back onto his shoulders, and he slaps Alex's thigh again as a final warning to watch. When Alex looks back down again, Apollo sinks back down on his cock, not stopping until his nose presses against Alex's skin. He waits a few seconds before swallowing, and when he swallows, Apollo's mouth goes cold. Alex groans, loud and filthy, his eyelids fluttering for a few seconds. Apollo stays still and focuses his attention on fingering the boy in his mouth. He thrusts his fingers in deep, scissoring them apart and twisting them as he does, watching as Alex squirms and bites his lip to stifle all the whorish moans escaping him. Apollo makes a beckoning motion with his fingers, and he adds a third when he elicits a groan from the boy. Alex gasps and arches up. The arch of his hips nearly causes Apollo to gag on him, since he wasn't expecting it, and he chokes-- entirely for Alex's pleasure, though, and nothing more-- before recovering. Apollo pushes his fingers in deeper, thrusting until Alex chokes and spits \"God-- God right there right there, fuck --\" through his teeth. Apollo hums triumphantly at having found Alex's prostate, and he starts to bob his head. He matches his bobs with the speed of his fingers. In a mere matter of minutes, Apollo manages to reduce Alex to a whiny, begging mess (again), one who's pulling on Apollo's hair like it's the only thing tying him down and being so loud that Apollo genuinely fears they'll get a noise complaint the next morning (it wouldn't be the first time they'd gotten in trouble for fucking too loud). Apollo makes out little diamonds glistening on the corners of Alex's eyes at some point. If he could smirk, he would. Apollo had no idea would like seeing Alex cry when he fucked him this much. \"Apollo,\" Alex gasps, his voice raspy. His eyelids droop to cover his eyes, which are half hidden by the mess of sweaty pink hair in his face. \"Apollo-- fuck-- please --\" Apollo moans, and he thrusts his fingers in as deep as he can. He beckons upwards. Alex yanks on Apollo's hair hard enough to hurt and groans, pushing his hips down into the immortal's hand, an attempt to get more of what he wants. Apollo can see his eyes roll back a little bit, so he makes the motion again, just to see Alex's eyes roll back-- this time all the way back-- again. Alex lets out a guttural curse, one of his legs sliding off of Apollo's back to press flat against the mattress. He pushes his hips up with a pant of moans. \"Fuck,\" Alex manages to get out. He squeezes his eyes shut and repeats himself. His chest heaves with silent, pleasured sobs before he opens his eyes again, looking back down at Apollo. With his teeth bared, he groans, \"Babe-- Apollo, I-- 'm gonna-- fuck-- come --\" Apollo moans (Alex gasps and cries out) and kicks what he's doing into overdrive. He repeats the same series of motions with his fingers-- thrusting deep and then curling upwards-- only this time he adds to it by pressing his thumb against Alex's perineum, knowing that his perineum is basically another G-spot for him. Apollo revels in the wheezy, whiny sobs Alex lets out, and the way his thighs shake every time Apollo moves, and the way he can feel Alex's other hand in his hair now, trying to force him down on his cock with as much strength as he can manage as he leans back against the pillows. Alex whines, the sound needy and desperate. Apollo looks up at him, and he digs his nails into Alex's thigh as they make eye contact. He tries to convey come for me with his eyes as he slowly comes up on Alex's dick and then sharply back down. Alex chokes, a cry caught in his chest, a few tears rolling down his cheeks. His grip on Apollo's hair tightens to the point where it actually makes the god wince a little bit. Apollo flutters his lashes and moans, his tongue pressed against the underside of Alex's cock and his fingers curled up inside of him. Alex cries out, loud, and more tears stream down his face. Once again, Apollo tries to get Alex to understand the message behind his eyes, only this time it works. \"God--\" Alex's voice is strained, and he's panting like he can't get enough air into his lungs (and truthfully, maybe he can't). \"Apollo...\" Apollo's name trails off into a high pitched moan. Alex's mouth hangs open, his shoulders hunched in, and he eyes flutter before snapping completely shut. Alex ruts his hips one last time, and then he comes, straight down Apollo's throat, with a strangled, wavering cry. He pulls hard on Apollo's hair, forcing him down. Apollo nearly chokes, for real this time, as he swallows, but he does swallow-- spitters are quitters, and besides, he likes how Alex tastes. Apollo squeezes Alex's thigh once he's swallowed. Alex responds with a loud whine. The whine ends with a grunt caused by Apollo pulling his fingers out of Alex's ass and wrapping his hand around his other thigh. Apollo doesn't pull off of his cock immediately after Alex comes. He waits until he feels him start getting soft before sitting up, his eyes still trained hard on Alex. Alex has collapsed against the bed by that point, emitting gentle moans and noises periodically, his chest and stomach heaving in unison as he tries to remember how to think and breathe properly again. Apollo wipes the drool and come that had dribbled down his chin off on the sheets crumpled up beside of him. Once he's clean, he presses a kiss against Alex's inner thigh, then his hip, then his stomach, steadily moving upwards until he reaches his mouth. \"How was that bubblegum?\" Apollo asks, hints of a smirk on the corners of his mouth. Alex doesn't offer a worded reply. All he does is whimper and shakily reach up to grab Apollo's shoulder. \"I'll take that it was good, then,\" Apollo murmurs in response to himself. He kisses Alex again-- Alex feeds a pathetic moan into Apollo's mouth at the lingering taste of his own come, but that's all he really offers the immortal, and Apollo quickly bores of kissing someone who can't kiss back. He pulls back and moves to mouth at his neck instead. As he gently kisses Alex's throat, Apollo reaches down between them and starts to sloppily jerk himself off. He'd gone a bit soft while he was sucking Alex off. Once he grows back to full hardness, Apollo lets go of his dick and uses his hands to spread Alex's legs again, lining himself up. They'd wobbled kind of closed once Apollo had moved from between them. Alex, who's fucked out and oblivious, pays Apollo's actions no mind-- that is, until he feels a push, and suddenly Apollo's dick is inside of him again, unmoving. \"Oh fucking-- fuck-- \" Alex groans and his back rises off the mattress at the sudden intrusion. \"David-- Apollo-- \" Apollo cuts him off by biting his throat, and hard, which earns him a choked yelp of pain and pleasure. \"What? Did you think that we were finished?\" Alex nods, and Apollo chuckles softly. \"I haven't even come yet, Alexander.\" \"Fucking-- goddammit--\" Alex's mouth falls open with a sharp, high pitched whine that breaks as he cries out, loud and through clenched teeth, as Apollo starts grinding into him once again. His nails bite hard into the flesh of Apollo's shoulder, and he arches his torso up against the god above him. Apollo cages him in with his arms, one on either side of his head. He uses his own body to force Alex down, back flat against the mattress. The room fills with every kind of sound imaginable to man. Alex, super hypersensitive after coming twice in a row, can't keep quiet, with needy moans and desperate, whorish whines bypassing his open mouth, and he certainly can't keep still either. Every time Apollo moves, he spasms; his thighs shake and his hips twitch into Apollo's thrusts. It's a system that feeds itself and results in Alex crying-- and really crying this time, with sobs intermingled between the moans and tears making his face catch the moonlight more than the sweat does. Apollo doesn't care how sensitive Alex is, though. Sure, his pace is even and calculated, but it's hard and rough and fast, and it's no wonder Alex is holding onto him so tight he's sure to leave a few bruises in the morning (and maybe that's exactly what Apollo wants). Apollo dips his head down and presses their lips together. Kissing Alex distracts Apollo enough to slow him down a small bit; his hips stutter, but he keeps going, only it's slow enough for Alex to handle without crying. He kisses Apollo back, his hands going from the immortal's shoulders to his face, holding him there. It's sloppy-- teeth knock together and they bite lips more than they kiss them-- but it's good enough for them. \"I missed you,\" Apollo whispers into Alex's mouth. He thrusts hard after he says it, and Alex accidentally and unknowingly bites Apollo's lip. The pain makes him groan as he repeats, \"I missed you-- so-- fucking-- much.\" Apollo punctuates each word with a sharp snap of his hips. Alex can't speak for gasping for a few moments, and he's still so breathless that his reply is raspy. \"Missed you too,\" Alex whimpers. \"So much. So much-- hhhnhhnnggn -- God, fuck-- fuck, Apollo --\" Apollo cuts him off by kissing him one last time before he pushes in deep and then deeper still. Alex gets progressively louder as he squirms underneath him. He starts crying again, harder than he was before, messy sobs ricocheting around the room to squeeze back down his throat as he gasps for air. He gets half-hard again. The only word that leaves Alex's lips is Apollo's name, but it's broken, reduced to the single-syllable \"Pol\"-- that's all his brain can come up with. That's all he remembers how to say. Apollo pulls out for a brief moment-- Alex grunts and whines, his eyes opening the slightest bit to glance down to try to see what the hell his sex god is doing. He looks down just in time to watch Apollo line up and ram into him again, and this time he hits Alex's prostate head on and the boy's brain explodes into static-- all he can focus on is the feeling of Apollo inside of him and all around him, trapping him in and holding him there so he can't get away. \"Pol-- oh my God, fuck-- fuck me --\" Alex's voice rises with every syllable, but it's strained, as if he's holding back. Apollo leans down to press their lips together in another extremely sloppy kiss. \"C'mon bubblegum-- be loud for me, you know I like when you're loud,\" he urges against the boy's lips. Ever the obedient one, the next time Alex cries, \"Apollo--\" his pitch is higher and his broken little voice echoes back at them from the thin walls. Apollo half grins, half smirks at him. \"Good,\" he groans. Apollo snaps his hips forward hard enough to make Alex choke on his air. \"But I want you to be louder pretty boy-- I don't think the neighbours can hear you.\" Apollo pauses long enough to readjust to a new position, and when he does, he rams into the pink haired boy squirming under him. Alex finally lets loose with the scream that's been hovering in the back of his throat, probably since Apollo started fucking him again. The scream starts in his chest and breaks outwards, splintered and visceral and oh, so loud. The god grins and pushes his hips in deeper. \"Yeah-- that's my good boy-- scream for me Alexander-- my loud little bitch,\" Apollo growls darkly against Alex's cheek Alex claws along the length of Apollo's spine, and although Apollo can feel blood bubbling to the surface of his skin, he pays it no mind. He doesn't care if he's bleeding. He cares about the way that Alex is screaming his name and crying \"fuck-- fuck, fuck me Pol right there right there God please right there fuck -- fuckmedon'tstopdon'tstopdon'tstopfuckplease--\" so guttural and rough and loud that his voice finally shatters and he's left choking on pathetic, wheezy sobs. Apollo cares that Alex's fingers ache on his hips, so much so that Apollo thinks Alex is trying to pull him inside of him entirely, but he doesn't mind. He wants it-- craves it, actually. Anything to be closer to Alex is great by him. Alex arches his hips up. His eyes are squeezed shut and he's shaking so much it would be frightening under any other circumstance. His cock twitches-- Apollo feels it against his stomach. Apollo reaches up and wraps his fingers around Alex's throat. He squeezes, and if Alex could make any sort of noise besides the wheezing sob he's been stuck on for several minutes, Apollo's sure he would moan for him again. Alex tilts his head back and Apollo seizes his opportunity to attach his mouth to the exposed skin of his jaw. He bites him, hard; there's a painful burning on his shoulder blades. He's positive that Alex has scratched him in response. \"Come,\" Apollo grunts against his skin. A choked moan vibrates against his palm as Alex wheezes, trying to communicate back with him. He squeezes tighter. \" Come -- fuck-- Alex --\" Alex whimpers and digs his nails into Apollo's skin. His back arches. If he could moan-- or make any sort of noise, for that matter-- he would, but all Alex is able to manage with a wrecked voice is a few breathless puffs of air. Apollo can feel his chest heave, and he feels him go completely tense for a few seconds before his hips push down, desperate to take as much of Apollo's cock as possible. Alex comes, somehow for a third time, toes curled into the sheets and fingers digging into Apollo's skin. Apollo feels Alex get tight, so fucking tight, around his dick as the boy comes. It feels-- he can't describe how it feels. It feels like everything he could ever want. It's tight and hot and so much friction he hadn't noticed before and so purely Alex that it doesn't feel possible. It only takes a series of sharp, sloppy thrusts for Apollo to come as well, his teeth sunk deep into the flesh of Alex's right shoulder to muffle the groan scraping past his throat. Alex whimpers softly, fingernails dug weakly into Apollo's biceps, his hips raising ever so slightly as the immortal fills him up. Apollo weakly ruts his hips forward a few times, each movement met with an equally as pathetic moan from Alex, before he stops. He waits for his brain to reconnect to the rest of his nervous system before he finally pulls out. Alex whines quietly as Apollo pulls out and rolls off of him, but other than that, the pink haired boy is silent. They both are, actually, as they stare at the ceiling and listen to one another gasp for air, too afraid to actually initiate any more contact with one another, verbal or physical, in case it blows up in their face. Alex is the first to move. He hesitantly slides closer to Apollo after wiping his face free of the tear tracks, and he presses himself against the god's side. He rests his head against Apollo's shoulder. It's a while longer before they speak-- they still have to catch their breath first, after all-- and once again, it's Alex who breaks the silence. \"'M still so incredibly pissed off at you, y'know,\" he mumbles. His voice is scratchy and hoarse, but he doesn't exactly sound angry. He sounds the opposite of it, actually. It's enough to make Apollo smile, tired. \"Damn,\" he says quietly back. \"I was hoping that I could somehow get you to forgive me through good sex.\" \"Mm, not quite. I'm not that easy, asshole. I'm still really upset at how much of an insensitive fucking tool you are.\" Alex makes a soft sound and rolls over so that he's laying with his head on Apollo's chest. He places his ear right over the god's heart to listen to it beat. Apollo feels Alex's hand seeking his out in the dim light of the room, and the pink haired boy threads their fingers together as soon as he finds Apollo's hand. Alex pulls their entwined hands to his mouth and presses his lips against their knuckles. The gesture makes Apollo's chest flutter. He ignores it, chalking it up as some post-sex sensation he's too tired to comprehend (but that's not at all what it is), and distracts himself by running his fingers through Alex's hair. \"Besides,\" Alex adds, his eyes closing tiredly against the gentle scrape of Apollo's nails against his scalp, \"the sex wasn't good.\" \"Oh?\" Apollo grimaces subtly at the disappointment that creeps into his voice. \"It was great sex, Apollo,\" Alex murmurs with a sore-sounding little chuckle. He very faintly squeezes Apollo's hand in his. \"We always have great sex, you know that. Dumbass.\" \"Oh.\" This time, Apollo says it with a smile. Alex laughs softly one last time before he readjusts the way he's laying on Apollo's chest, snuggling closer to him-- no doubt to sap as much of his body heat as he can. After that, they're silent for a long time. Apollo listens as Alex's breathing evens out while he himself stares at the ceiling. He can't find sleep as easily as Alex appears to; his brain won't shut off. It keeps swirling, a hazy mess of escaping euphoria being chased by a small spark of dread. Apollo bites the inside of his cheek. \"Hey, Alex?\" He's afraid that Alex won't answer, that he's already asleep, but to his surprise, the pink haired boy in his arms responds. \"Hmm?\" Alex hums. He sounds sleepy. \"I-- I'm really sorry to keep you awake, but I want to-- I don't know. Talk to you. For just a second, anyway,\" Apollo whispers, and he sounds nervous and almost scared even to his own ears. Alex pushes himself up to look at Apollo, having picked up on his tone. He hovers over Apollo and looks down at him with his brows knitted together. \"What's on your mind, my darling?\" he asks gently and quietly. Apollo hesitates; he spends too long staring up into Alex's eyes, almost wishing he could crawl inside of them and stay there forever. When Alex raises one of his eyebrows, Apollo forces himself to focus again. \"I-- I-- I--\" Apollo's voice breaks on the last one, and he stops with a soft, annoyed sigh. He mentally curses himself for stuttering so goddamn much. \"I'm... sorry.\" Alex tilts his head to the side just a small bit and runs his hand over Apollo's chest, stopping when he reaches his shoulder. \"I know you are, love.\" \"No, Alex, I'm really really sorry-- about everything-- about using you, and keeping information about myself from you, about treating you like shit in the beginning, about absolutely everything I may have done against you, including the shit I said to you earlier today, and I-- I wasn't-- I wasn't--\" He stops and takes a short breath. Alex waits, his fingers gently tracing over Apollo's skin as the god recomposes himself. Apollo swallows around the lump in his throat. \"I'm sorry. I was wrong to do all of that. And... I wasn't joking earlier when I said I wanted to fix us.\" \"I know you weren't, D-- Apollo,\" Alex repeats as his gaze flickers from Apollo's biceps to his mismatched eyes. \"Sorry. I'm still not entirely used to your name.\" \"It's alright, I don't mind it.\" He pauses. \"Look Alex, I... I know a guy,\" Apollo says. Alex's expression changes in a way that he doesn't like, and Apollo rushes out, \"I know a guy who-- who works in couples counselling, and I-- we could get an appointment and he can help us, like, really help us Alex, and I want to do that, I really do--\" His voice drops to something less than a breath. \"But only if it's something you want to do too.\" They fall silent again. Apollo can feel his pulse pounding in his throat and his ears as Alex lightly drags his nails over his biceps. He's so goddamn scared that Alex is going to say no. If he does, Apollo has no fucking clue what he'll do then, he really doesn't. It feels like centuries before Alex finally speaks. He doesn't whisper, and his voice is serious. \"You said you couldn't lie, right?\" Although confused as to what this has to do with anything, Apollo nods. \"Yeah. And I know when people are lying to me, too.\" \"Do you really want to fix our relationship?\" \"Yes,\" Apollo breathes. \"Gods, yes, I do.\" \"Why?\" Alex sounds so small, and it makes Apollo feel a multitude of things. He feels guilty that Alex even feels the need to ask. It's his fault, and Apollo knows it. But he also feels a rush of something else-- something that makes him want to protect Alex. Something that makes him want to hold Alex and never let go of him again. \"Because I want to be with you, Alexander William Gaskarth.\" Alex stares at him for a while. Apollo stares back at him and holds his breath, anxious to see what Alex has to say next. Neither of them speak or move until finally, Alex half smiles. \"Okay.\" He smiles a little bit wider. \"Okay. We'll talk about making an appointment with this guy of yours when we wake up tomorrow morning. Right now, though, I just want to sleep, because I'm tired and so so so sore and you're warm and comfortable and I want you to hold me because I missed you.\" \"Okay,\" Apollo echoes, also mirroring the little smile that's perched prettily on Alex's lips. \"Go to sleep bubblegum.\" \"I'm going to-- and you better go to sleep too.\" Alex leans down and very gently presses his lips against Apollo's. The kiss only lasts for a few short seconds before Alex pulls back some few inches. \"Goodnight.\" Apollo places his hand on Alex's cheek and leans up to close the rest of the distance between them. He makes this kiss last a fair bit longer than the one previous, but not so long that it loses its sweetness as a goodnight kiss. Apollo pulls back and gently bumps their noses together before he settles back against the pillow. He had hoped it would make Alex smile, and to his pleasure, it does. \"Goodnight my love,\" Apollo murmurs, stroking his thumb over Alex's cheek. \"Goodnight my darling.\" Alex bites his lip. \"I love you.\" Apollo's smile falters. \"Alex--\" Alex turns his head to kiss Apollo's palm. \"It's fine-- for tonight, it's fine. Just know that I love you. And... and that I'm glad you came back. I'm glad I let you in.\" \"As am I,\" Apollo says. Relief spreads through his bones, replacing the guilt that had filled the marrow when Alex had told him he loved him, as he watches the boy settle back against his chest. \"Goodnight. Again. Sleep well, bubblegum.\" \"I will. You're here-- I'll sleep great. Goodnight, Apollo. I love you.\" Alex falls asleep not long after that. Apollo, however, stays awake just a little bit longer and resumes staring at the ceiling. He doesn't think about anything in particular as he follows the familiar popcorn pattern above him with his eyes. His brain fleets from thought to thought: he thinks about how happy he is that he decided to come over; and how hopeful he feels about their future together; and what kind of future they'll even have together; and then, finally, right before he falls asleep, about how he's not at all looking forward to calling Eros's office in the morning. -fin-",

      "Apollo hesitates, then adds, \"I fucked up, and I'm sorry about that, but I want to fix us--\" \"There's nothing to fix, don't you understand that?",
      "You lied to me, and--\" \"I never once lied to you,\" Apollo interjects angrily.",
      "\"I can't lie to you, I've told you that-- I've only ever told you the truth--\" \"Then why did you tell me your name was David?\" Alex sneers.",
      "\"Why lie and not just give me your real name?",
      "Are you really so fucking full of yourself that you think you're the only guy on the planet named Apollo?\"",
      "\"I thought it would be less suspicious to use David!\"",
      "Apollo snaps.",
      "Admittedly, he sounded much harsher than he originally intended to, but he isn't about to apologise for that, even if he feels that he should.",
      "He closes his eyes and exhales slowly before continuing.",
      "\"Look, I'll admit, I did... keep things from you, about myself and my family and whatnot, but I had reasons for that, I told you that, and-- and things changed, Alex, I--\" \"It doesn't fucking matter that things changed, David!\"",
      "Alex spits without even bothering to correct himself.",
      "Apollo doubts he even noticed his error.",
      "Alex turns to glare at him, his eyes burning with a fury Apollo doesn't think he's ever seen in him before now.",
      "\"Don't you understand that?",
      "It doesn't matter!\"",
      "\"Well it should!\"",
      "Apollo spits back.",
      "He fights the urge to cringe a small bit at the way his voice rises and warps.",
      "Gods, he didn't want to argue, yet here he is and here they are, doing exactly that.",
      "He fights to keep his voice level as he says, \"It should matter that things changed-- that I changed--\" Alex slams his mug onto the kitchen counter with enough force to send some of its contents sloshing over the rim and onto the fake linoleum.",
      "\"It fucking doesn't!\"",
      "His voice is high pitched and angry when he speaks next.",
      "\"You were using me!",
      "You led me on with the intentions to just-- to just drop me once I wasn't useful to you anymore!\"",
      "Apollo's nostrils flare in growing frustration.",
      "He didn't want this to happen.",
      "\"Alex, I've repeatedly said that I'm sorry--\" \"Sorry isn't going to change a fucking thing David--",
      "Apollo, God, whatever the fuck your real name is!\"",
      "Alex shouts.",
      "\"You used me, and-- and you treated me like shit, and you--\" \"So, what, people can't change?",
      "Is that what you're saying?\"",
      "Apollo fires off, temples throbbing as his eye no doubt begins burning red.",
      "\"So you've obviously never changed from the way you used to be in the past, right?",
      "You're still a cheating bitch and a felon-- a murderer nonetheless, according to you, anyway--\" As soon as the words leave his mouth, Apollo immediately regrets it; he knows he crossed several lines in saying that, and he just wants to scoop the words up and swallow them back down.",
      "Alex's expression shifts from just pissed off to enraged and hurt.",
      "\"Fuck you,\" he hisses.",
      "\"God, fuck you!",
      "You're such a fucking asshole!\"",
      "Apollo takes another step towards Alex as guilt crashes against his chest.",
      "\"I'm sorry--\" \"Shut up!",
      "Just shut up!",
      "I don't want to hear it!\"",
      "\"Alex--\" \"Jesus Christ, I told you to shut the fuck up!\"",
      "Alex punctuates his statement by throwing his mug directly at Apollo's head.",
      "Apollo ducks, just barely missing it, but scalding tea drenches his arm.",
      "Luckily he hadn't taken his coat off when he came inside, so it didn't really burn him as much as it just got him wet.",
      "The fact that it happened is enough to piss Apollo off, though.",
      "Apollo teleports directly in front of Alex, startling him and causing him to curse under his breath.",
      "He grabs Alex's wrist and pins it against the wall behind him, and Alex pulls on his wrist.",
      "He hits Apollo's chest with his free hand; Apollo grabs his other wrist and pins it beside his head in partnership with the other as a response.",
      "Alex glances up at Apollo with hard and angry eyes.",
      "\"Let go of me,\" he spits through his teeth.",
      "\"Not until I know you won't try to throw shit at me and hit me again,\" Apollo growls back.",
      "They're so close together like this, close enough for Apollo to feel Alex's breath when he exhales and smell the fading yet all too familiar scent of lavender soap coming from his skin, and he catches himself staring directly at Alex's mouth.",
      "Apollo subconsciously outlines the familiar curve of his lips before he drags his gaze back up to meet Alex's eyes.",
      "\"What are you staring at?\" Alex mutters.",
      "He still sounds pissed off.",
      "It hits Apollo like a truck just how much he wants to kiss Alex.",
      "He doesn't think he should want to, considering the fact that Alex just threw a ceramic mug at him-- at his head, no less-- but he does.",
      "They've been apart for so long, and he's missed him so much, and now he's got Alex pinned to the wall, hovering over him with their lips less than inches apart.",
      "\"Goddammit, answer me, you fucking dick,\" Alex snaps as he once again tries to pry himself from Apollo's grip, and it draws Apollo's gaze from his lips back to his eyes again.",
      "\"I'm so sick of you doing this shit.\"",
      "It wouldn't be hard for Apollo to kiss Alex.",
      "All he would need to do is duck down and close the gap between them to press their lips together.",
      "He leans in to do so, but he stops short, hesitant, with his mouth less than inches from Alex's, lips slightly parted.",
      "They both go silent, save for the sound of their breathing.",
      "Alex finally breaks the silence.",
      "\"What are you doing?\" he whispers.",
      "Apollo gently squeezes Alex's wrists.",
      "\"I was going to-- I wanted to--\" He stops short with his heart beating in his throat.",
      "He doesn't know what to say next.",
      "\"What?\" Alex sounds exasperated.",
      "Apollo can't blame him.",
      "\"I... can I kiss you?\"",
      "Apollo finally asks in a soft, yet very strained voice.",
      "\"Please?\"",
      "The question surprises Alex; that much is evident in the way confusion glosses over the anger in his eyes as he glances between Apollo's mouth and his eyes.",
      "He wasn't expecting him to ask, and why should he?",
      "Apollo hasn't asked to kiss him since their second or third date, which was sometime last year.",
      "Hell, Apollo even surprised himself by asking.",
      "He's starting to regret asking, though.",
      "He can't read Alex's face to figure out what he's thinking.",
      "After the initial change from indignation to bewilderment, Alex's expression went back to being guarded, and Apollo has this sinking feeling in his gut telling him that this is Alex's way of saying no.",
      "It's disappointing-- to be so close like this only to be rejected-- but there's nothing Apollo can do about it.",
      "He starts to let go of Alex's wrists so he can leave before he causes any more trouble, but before he can, he feels a pair of lips press against his own.",
      "The suddenness of Alex's kiss surprises Apollo enough to render him incapable of kissing back for several short moments.",
      "He certainly wasn't expecting Alex to kiss him, but he's not complaining in the least.",
      "The kiss is awkward, uncomfortable, and tense for several long moments.",
      "Alex's lips are plush and soft like they've always been, but they're not as inviting as Apollo is used to.",
      "It's like he's being apprehensive-- like Alex isn't sure if he wants to kiss him or not.",
      "Apollo squeezes his wrists (while his grip is considerably looser, his hand still remains clasped around Alex's wrists, holding him against the wall), digging his fingers gently but firmly into his skin.",
      "For some reason, it works.",
      "The tension melts away almost entirely, and Alex parts his lips ever so slightly.",
      "Apollo hesitantly runs his tongue along the seam of his lips; when he gets a soft sigh in response, he takes advantage of the opportunity being presented to him to tilt his head to the side just enough for him to easily slide his tongue into Alex's mouth.",
      "The action earns him a pleased little noise-- Apollo relishes in it, mostly because he was afraid that he would never get to hear it again.",
      "He lets go of one of Alex's wrists.",
      "He reaches down with his now-free hand to trace his fingertips along Alex's jaw as he kisses him.",
      "Apollo gently brushes the pad of his thumb over Alex's chin, the tip of his thumb lightly brushing against the edge of Alex's bottom lip, and tilts his chin up so he can kiss him better.",
      "They easily find their rhythm, one they've spent a year perfecting, with lips slotting together effortlessly and turning their kiss from gentle to desperate in a short matter of minutes.",
      "\"God--\" Alex breaks the kiss with a soft gasp.",
      "Their lips brush together as he speaks, and it takes all of Apollo's self restraint not to close the gap between them again and kiss Alex until he really can't breathe anymore.",
      "He watches as Alex's lips form the words, \"You're so fucking stupid, you know that?\"",
      "\"I know, Alexander, I know,\" Apollo whispers back.",
      "\"And I'm so sorry--\" Alex cuts him off like he isn't even listening to him speak.",
      "\"You're so stupid and-- and-- and insensitive and goddammit, you're such an asshole-- but fuck, I--\" Alex's lips return to his again, kissing him almost hungrily this time.",
      "Apollo feels Alex grab his collar and pull him closer to him.",
      "He slides his own hand from Alex's chin to his hip, and he pulls him closer as he kisses him harder than he was before.",
      "He nips his teeth at his bottom lip; the pink haired boy lets out a weak, indiscernible sound before he pulls away again, breathless.",
      "\"But I don't hate you,\" Alex pants, picking up where his previous statement left off.",
      "\"I know you think I do, and trust me, I want to hate you-- with every fibre of my being I really do want to hate your guts, but I don't --\" He interrupts himself to press their lips together once more, but he doesn't keep his mouth against Apollo's for long.",
      "\"And I missed you, so incredibly much-- and I hate that I did, but I-- I fucking missed you, Davey.\"",
      "Alex's words halt with a gasp after Apollo dips his head down to press open-mouthed kisses along his jaw, tongue swirling over the dark red mark he sucks into his skin.",
      "He's met with a soft moan-like noise as Alex moves his hand from his collar to his neck.",
      "He feels Alex's nails scrape over the back of his neck, and Apollo can't help but notice the way Alex's head falls back against the wall to expose more of his throat.",
      "He finally releases Alex's other wrist and moves his hand to his other hip as well, gently squeezing as soon as his fingers curl around his waist.",
      "\"I missed you too bubblegum,\" Apollo whispers.",
      "He drags his teeth over his throat, and he can feel Alex's pulse jump under his tongue when he does.",
      "\"Gods, I missed you.\"",
      "Neither say another word, so Apollo sets about creating another mark to decorate his neck, taking his time in doing so just to be able to listen to all the pretty noises Alex makes.",
      "He pulls Alex's hips towards him to press them closer to one another because they're not close enough, there's too much space between their bodies after being apart for so long and it's driving Apollo insane-- he craves feeling Alex pressed against him.",
      "Apollo just barely finishes the hickey before Alex knots his fingers in Apollo's hair and pulls his head back from his neck.",
      "Apollo looks up to meet his eyes, and his breath stutters when he notices how blown Alex's pupils are.",
      "Alex leans forward and brushes their lips together without kissing him.",
      "\"Please-- my room--\" As if he needs to be told twice.",
      "Apollo slides his hands from Alex's hips to the back of his thighs, and his fingers hook around his legs.",
      "He lifts Alex up rather easily and closes the gap between their mouths once more.",
      "Alex wraps his legs around his waist and secures his ankles together as Apollo carries him down the short hallway leading to his room, squeezing his thighs against Apollo's sides and grinding against him rather needily as the god bites down on his lip.",
      "Apollo smirks a little bit at how hard Alex already feels.",
      "When they get to the little bedroom at the end of the hall, Apollo wastes no time in laying Alex down and pressing him against the mattress.",
      "They kiss for a while, but Apollo eventually leans up to take his coat off before he moves his lips to Alex's throat.",
      "He kisses over the marks he had made earlier, lips light as a feather as they ghost over Alex's skin.",
      "Alex moans weakly beneath him.",
      "Apollo smiles at the sound and pushes his hands under the shirt Alex wears, fingers splayed over his skin.",
      "His fingers roam over Alex's chest and stomach as he goes lower, kissing down, down, down until his lips meet metal and he's mouthing at the buckle on Alex's belt.",
      "Alex inhales sharply.",
      "Apollo looks up when he notices the way that Alex's chest sort of stutters under his hand, a grin splitting across his lips.",
      "He inches down even further, mouth level with his crotch, and he presses an open-mouthed kiss against the fabric of Alex's jeans with a soft hum.",
      "Alex softly gasps, breath stuttering again, his hand going to Apollo's shoulder.",
      "His fingers dig in, grip weak, as he pushes his hips up.",
      "\"God--",
      "Apollo-- b-blow me?\" Alex's whisper echoes in the room, the words phrased as a question, hesitant and uncertain.",
      "Alex knows very well how much of a tease his (ex?)boyfriend can be, and Apollo picks up on his unsure tone-- but for once, he decides to give Alex what he asks for without making him beg for ages to get it.",
      "Apollo doesn't say anything in response; he only removes his hands from Alex's shirt and unbuckles his belt, fingers fumbling slightly.",
      "As he does, Apollo scatters kisses along Alex's hips and waist like afterthoughts, small and gentle, yet they still make Alex whine loud enough to disturb the people in the neighbouring apartments.",
      "Eventually, Apollo gets the belt loose.",
      "He has less trouble popping the button, taking the little clasp of the zipper into his mouth afterwards and slowly-- because he is still an incessant tease at heart-- pulling it down with his teeth.",
      "Alex mumbles some weak noise at the minute vibration the zipper causes against him, but Apollo doesn't hear him.",
      "He's too busy with yanking Alex's jeans down.",
      "He presses a wet, open-mouthed kiss to the fabric of Alex's boxer-briefs covering his dick, eliciting a moan from the other, before stripping him of those as well, and he runs his fingers along Alex's legs as he moves his hands back up to his hips to secure them in place against the mattress.",
      "Apollo bites his lip and glances up at Alex.",
      "He's always thought that Alex is stunning from this angle-- chest and stomach on display, both heaving as he pants to breathe, and it's so pretty, so delicious, even, that Apollo licks his lips and-- \"Oh my God --\" Alex gasps when he feels Apollo's mouth close around the tip of his dick.",
      "Apollo's fingers tighten on his hips as Alex tries to push them up, holding him firmly in place against the mattress.",
      "He feels Alex's fingers squeeze harder at his shoulder in response before moving into his hair as Apollo sinks down, cheeks hollowed out, tongue pressed against him.",
      "He doesn't stop until his nose presses against the skin of Alex's groin; he stays still for a long moment, breathing slowly and closing his eyes before he begins to bob his head (slowly, always slowly).",
      "Alex cries out when he starts, pulling Apollo's hair and straining uselessly against the god's hands.",
      "Apollo moans softly, and the gentle vibrations he creates cause Alex to whimper, the noise almost embarrassingly loud in the small room.",
      "Apollo opens his eyes again and directs his gaze upwards.",
      "As he had hoped, Alex is watching him-- eyes hooded, mouth slightly ajar-- and he groans when their eyes meet.",
      "\"Ah-- fuck, God, ohhhh my God -- babe-- just-- please-- \" Alex cuts himself off with a throaty whine, desperate and needy, as he once again tries unsuccessfully to push his hips up.",
      "Apollo hums in response to the pink haired boy's cry.",
      "He pulls back, sucking on the head of Alex's cock, swirling his tongue for good measure, before pulling off completely.",
      "\"What?\" Apollo asks.",
      "His voice is soft, almost innocent-- he's good at this, and he knows it.",
      "He repositions his hand to press his thumb in the crease between Alex's thigh and hip, dipping his head down to lick teasingly at his dick.",
      "\"What do you want?\" Alex groans his name, and the sound of it makes Apollo grin, his body tingling and warm with something that isn't necessarily arousal.",
      "It's something just as pleasant, though, kind of like l-- He pushes the thought way, way down before it has time to fully form, and Alex tightens the already steel-like grip he has on Apollo's hair.",
      "\"Want-- want you,\" comes his whimpered reply.",
      "\"Want you to fuck me, hard, please-- God, make me scream, I-- ohh-- \" Apollo swallows him back down again before he can finish his sentence.",
      "This time, however, the god wastes no time in immediately taking Alex to the back of his throat and keeping him there.",
      "He closes his eyes as he listens to the quick breaths Alex pants out.",
      "Apollo swallows around him, and Alex blurts out some warbled expletive, louder than the immortal thinks he meant to, and arches his back.",
      "If Apollo could smile, he would.",
      "He's always loved that, thought it was hot as hell when Alex got loud-- and Apollo knows that Alex is only going to get louder from here out, because he has absolutely no concept of volume control.",
      "Apollo stays still for several more moments.",
      "Alex breathes out little moans, his fingers loose and then tight and then loose again, alternating, in his hair.",
      "Apollo starts to pull off again at the boy's insistence for him to \"move, fuck-- please.\"",
      "He moves slow and makes damn sure that his tongue is pressed hard against the underside of Alex's cock, putting pressure on a vein that's going to make Alex choke on his air.",
      "Sure enough, Alex's head falls back against the mattress again with a strangled noise half trapped in his throat, desperately attempting to claw its way out.",
      "Apollo moans, more for Alex's benefit than anything, sucking lazily as he finishes coming up, far too vulgar to be allowed.",
      "After what feels like years but is more like a matter of minutes, Apollo pulls off once and for all.",
      "The wet pop reverberates in the bedroom.",
      "Alex looks down again (he always looks down, he loves to watch), just in time to watch Apollo press a gentle kiss against the tip, and the god smirks at his breathless gasp.",
      "\"Whatever you want bubblegum,\" he rasps.",
      "Apollo shifts and leans up to mouth at Alex's hip.",
      "He sucks a light red mark into his skin, and the red mark turns into a line of gentle kisses spanning across Alex's waist to his other hip.",
      "With each kiss, Alex emits a soft whimper, the sound a muted one that lets Apollo know that Alex is biting his lip in an attempt to keep quiet.",
      "That's not going to work for long, Apollo thinks to himself as his mouth moves from Alex's hip to the skin directly above his belly button.",
      "Alex pulls at Apollo's hair, almost pulling him upwards, like he's urging him to hurry up and reach his mouth so that they can kiss again.",
      "Apollo obliges easily.",
      "As their lips meet, he adds to his thought: you never can keep quiet, no matter what you do.",
      "But then they're kissing, and all of Apollo's thoughts on Alex's inability to remain quiet dissipate.",
      "He can't focus on them, not when he can focus instead on the way Alex slides his hands under his shirt, fingers grabbing at his shoulders after pulling the shirt over his head and tossing it somewhere across the room.",
      "It's when Alex digs his nails into his ribs that it registers in Apollo's brain that they're both wearing too much clothes-- he's still in his jeans, and Alex is still in his shirt.",
      "Apollo pushes the hem of the other boy's shirt up again, grinning at the startled gasp Alex gives him when he brushes the pads of his thumbs over the boy's nipples before Apollo pulls his shirt off of him.",
      "\"That's better,\" Apollo mumbles, almost absentmindedly, into his mouth when their lips meet again.",
      "\"Almost,\" Alex corrects, rapid fire.",
      "He breaks from the kiss again, eyes trained on Apollo's lips for a few moments, and his hands go to the immortal's belt.",
      "Alex pulls on the buckle.",
      "\"You're still in these.",
      "Take 'em off.",
      "Now.\"",
      "\"Someone's awfully demanding,\" Apollo teases, and Alex whines for him to \"hurry up so you can fuck me,\" but he's already gotten his pants off by then.",
      "Apollo kicks his jeans off of the edge of the bed to land on top of the ones he'd stripped Alex of earlier, and Alex's legs encircle his waist once they're both naked.",
      "Alex wraps his arms around Apollo's back to grab more firmly at his shoulders and grinds his hips up now that there's nothing holding him down.",
      "Apollo, who had ducked his head down to kiss Alex's neck some more, groans at the way their cocks slide against each other.",
      "Alex's nails dig into his skin, pulling him down more.",
      "Apollo kisses him, and Alex bites greedily at Apollo's lip, sucking it into his mouth to hide his own moan.",
      "Alex's neediness makes Apollo's head spin.",
      "They're skin on skin with no room between them, and all Apollo can think while they're close together like this is how he was afraid that he would never get this again-- never again get to feel Alex rutting his hips up against him, desperate for even the smallest of touches; never again get to hear Alex moan his name (and he certainly never thought he would get to hear Alex moan his real name); never again get to-- Alex groaning in frustration cuts through his thoughts.",
      "\"God, Apollo, just-- just fuck me already,\" he pants, whiny, desperate.",
      "\"It's been weeks-- now isn't the time for you to be an eternal goddamn tease--\" Although Apollo laughs softly at his words, he can't deny the way his dick had throbbed at Alex's tone of voice, especially when Alex had said his name.",
      "The throbbing sensation travels upwards to settle in his pelvis, and he grinds his hips down, drawing a moan from Alex's mouth, before Apollo slides his hands along his sides until they reach his hips.",
      "One hand creeps lower, between Alex's legs, to press his fingers against his perineum briefly (but it's still enough to make Alex's breath catch completely in his throat) before finding way to his hole.",
      "Before Apollo can push a finger in, though, Alex stops him.",
      "At first, he's confused as to why, then he assumes it's because he forgot the lube.",
      "Again.",
      "Apollo has a bad habit of that.",
      "Mumbling, the god apologises, \"Right, sorry bubblegum--\" Apollo leans over to open the nightstand drawer he knows the lube is stashed away in, but Alex grabs his wrist before he can reach it.",
      "Apollo stops and looks down at him, brows knitted together, confused.",
      "Alex stares back up at him with wide and innocently sinful eyes.",
      "There's a churn in Apollo's gut that crashes against his abdomen, multiplying with the sensation from before, and he inhales deep through his nose to keep from groaning.",
      "\"No,\" Alex whispers.",
      "He guides Apollo's hand back between his legs, and he directs his gaze downwards for a moment.",
      "He pushes his hips up, rubbing their cocks together again with a little whimper, desperate for friction, then looks back up at Apollo.",
      "\"Don't waste your time with prep.",
      "I don't need lube-- don't even need a condom-- just need you, inside of me.",
      "Now.",
      "Please. \"",
      "Apollo's breath catches in his throat.",
      "\"But I have to prep--\" \"I don't need it,\" Alex whines, careful to enunciate his words clearly, each one grating against his throat in a way that makes Apollo dizzy, \"I just need you, now-- please Dav-- Apollo, fuck.",
      "Me.",
      "Fuck me.\"",
      "His voice drops to a whiny yet seductive whisper.",
      "\"Fuck me, now.\"",
      "Apollo blinks, speechless, unsure what to say or do.",
      "They've never skipped prep in the past, nor have they neglected to use lube and protection; Alex was pretty insistent that they use it all, actually, because it made him feel better, safer, when they had sex-- sometimes even for oral.",
      "So this is... new, coming from Alex.",
      "But the way he's looking at Apollo, his eyes dark, even darker than usual, with want-- with need, even-- and the way he grinds his hips up again, grunting \"please, please-- fuck, \" quickly makes Apollo's mind up for him.",
      "Once again, Apollo declares \"whatever you want bubblegum\" before he uses the grip he has on Alex's hips to angle him better, to make it easier to go in.",
      "The little smile that Alex gives him after he repositions him sends butterflies shooting into Apollo's chest, and he smiles back while simultaneously trying to squash down the fluttering in his ribcage.",
      "That's the last thing he needs right now; he doesn't want-- doesn't need to think about the implications of what that might mean-- which is nothing, because that's exactly what it means.",
      "It doesn't mean anything... maybe.",
      "No, fuck, it doesn't.",
      "Definitely not.",
      "Not again.",
      "Apollo growls softly at his own swirling train of thought and leans down to kiss him again.",
      "Alex makes a soft noise in response to the low rumble that emits from the back of Apollo's throat, and it's a noise that quickly multiplies in volume when Apollo sucks his lip into his mouth.",
      "He knows Alex has a thing for lip biting-- sucking too-- and has known for months now, so he decides to capitalise on that.",
      "He bites down hard, hard, harder, until Alex can't breathe without making some kind of throaty noise, each one tripping over the one before it to tumble into Apollo's mouth.",
      "Apollo takes advantage of his distraction to line himself up with Alex's hole.",
      "Alex lets out a shuddering little breath when he feels the head of Apollo's cock brush against him, almost like he's testing the waters, to see if this is really what Alex wants.",
      "When nothing else happens, he huffs against the god's mouth.",
      "\"Goddammit Apollo, if you don't hurry the fuck up I'm going to flip us and ri--\" The rest of Alex's sentence is swallowed whole by a sharp, choked off gasp from the back of his throat as Apollo pushes in.",
      "\"Oh fuck-- oh fuck-- oh fuck-- \" The words come out in a pain-drenched moan, but they don't stop there.",
      "Alex spits a string of vulgarities through his teeth and arches his back up off the mattress, his nails digging almost painfully into Apollo's shoulders.",
      "He scrunches his face up and sucks his stomach in.",
      "His actions are a concentrated effort to draw himself up and away from the pain; it's hard for Apollo not to notice it.",
      "The immortal fits his mouth against the curve of Alex's neck, sucking on it to distract him, and he gently caresses his thumb over Alex's hips, so he can sap as much pain from him as he possibly can.",
      "Apollo reaches down between them, wraps his hand around Alex's dick to lazily jerk him off with the hopes that it forces his body to focus on the pleasure and not the pain, and continues pushing in until their skin is flush against one another-- and then he stops.",
      "Alex is still but not silent as his body gets used to the way Apollo feels inside of him.",
      "His breaths come out short and jagged, broken up only by long drawn out moans that send tingling sensations rippling down Apollo's spine.",
      "But Alex doesn't stay still for long; he groans and wraps his leg around the back of Apollo's thigh, then shoves him closer and deeper inside of himself with a short gasp. \"",
      "Move, \" he chokes, broken, a soft groan on the edge of his lips.",
      "\"Please-- need-- \" Instead of words, what comes out of Alex's mouth next is a filthy whimper.",
      "Apollo moves, slow and gentle so he doesn't hurt the pink haired boy underneath him.",
      "The resulting moans Alex makes are uncomfortable-sounding on some level or another.",
      "Apollo almost feels bad for him, since he knows this isn't the most... pleasant feeling in the world (not yet, anyway).",
      "He holds his breath, waiting for Alex to tell him to stop, that it hurts, because Alex is whining like it's too painful to deal with, but no such statement ever interrupts the steady flow of whimpers coming from his mouth.",
      "Apollo breathes out a small sigh of relief after several minutes and dips his head down to kiss between Alex's collarbones.",
      "Apollo presses his tongue against the flat, smooth plane of Alex's skin as he very hesitantly increases the speed of his thrusts.",
      "Alex mewls; Apollo notices that the discomfort in his voice is slowly melting away.",
      "Alex relaxes even more, which makes it easier for the both of them to actually enjoy the sex they're having.",
      "Apollo doesn't try to go faster or harder, though, at least not yet.",
      "This is still their first time bareback together-- he doesn't want to push Alex's limits too far too soon.",
      "Sticking to what he knows works, Apollo drops his mouth lower on Alex's chest, littering kisses from his collarbone downwards before finally attaching his mouth to one of Alex's nipples.",
      "Alex gasps a weak \" fuck \" at the contact, the sound soft and wispy, but still audible nonetheless.",
      "Apollo sucks on his nipple, his mouth and tongue cold, eyes closed while Alex suffocates the room with a chorus of porn-worthy moans.",
      "The hand not on Alex's hip reaches up to tweak his other nipple, and Alex chokes on the neediest sound Apollo has ever heard him make whilst digging his heels into the mattress and arching his hips into Apollo's.",
      "Apollo opens his eyes to gaze up at Alex then; he has his head to the side, teeth bared against the moans he's expelling and nose scrunched up in that (really really cute) way he sometimes scrunches his nose up when they have sex.",
      "Apollo makes a soft noise at the sight of him before he pulls his mouth off of Alex's chest.",
      "Alex whines unhappily at the loss, his mouth opening slightly and his fingernails digging into Apollo's back, while the god drags his lips, teeth, and tongue along the column of his throat before detaching them from his lover's skin altogether.",
      "Apollo guides his hand from Alex's chest to his throat, fingers pressing firmly against soft flesh there immediately as they come into contact with it, his thumb hooked under the outline of his jaw.",
      "He pushes against the side of his jaw to force Alex to look up at him.",
      "Apollo leans in to kiss Alex, his hand still (more or less) wrapped around his throat.",
      "He pushes their tongues against one another and graciously swallows the muffled set of moans that Alex starts to feed into his mouth as soon as their lips touch.",
      "Alex moves his hand from Apollo's shoulder to his hair, and he twists strands of the immortal's hair around his fingers.",
      "He pulls on Apollo's hair to make him break away and stop kissing him.",
      "\"More,\" Alex groans.",
      "Their lips brush together as he speaks.",
      "He rocks his hips down just a little to meet Apollo mid-thrust, adding, \"Moremoremore, please, I need more, I need you, need it fff-- fuck me, oh my Godddhngh-- faster and harder and-- and--\" before his voice catches mid-sentence and tapers off into a moan.",
      "\"Is that really what you want?\"",
      "Apollo asks through his teeth, his lips now pressed to Alex's ear, voice strained, a slight growl peeking through the edges of his words.",
      "Alex whines loudly and shivers ever so slightly at the feeling of Apollo's breath against his skin.",
      "\"Yes,\" he pants.",
      "\"Apollo-- yes-- fuck-- yes--\" He keeps chanting \"yesfuckyesfuck -- don't stop \" through a plethora of pleasured cries, his chest arching upwards into Apollo's as he's given exactly what he asked for.",
      "Apollo slides his hand from Alex's neck to his other hip.",
      "With fingers pressed into Alex's skin hard enough to leave bruises blooming against the sweaty paleness of his flesh, Apollo pulls Alex towards him each time he snaps his hips forward.",
      "Alex mewls pathetically before he begins to curl his hips into Apollo's on his own; after that, each noise that grates past Alex's lips is in sync with the rhythm of their hips.",
      "Alex untangles his fingers from Apollo's hair with a desperate moan of his name, and he shifts one of his legs upwards to wrap around Apollo's waist.",
      "As he does, he wraps his free hand around his own dick.",
      "Apollo feels him dig his nails into his shoulder and pull him closer to him as he sloppily starts to jerk himself off.",
      "Alex whimpers, desperate and craving something, anything that will send him over the edge.",
      "While Alex chokes on his air, garbled words and various noises clogging his throat as he fists his cock, Apollo attaches his mouth to the pink haired boy's jaw, his tongue pressed against sweaty skin as he bites down, sucking and leaving behind a bright red blossom on the underside of his jaw.",
      "Alex groans, needy and much louder than he should be, considering how late it is, and Apollo laughs softly against the hickey.",
      "\"And to think, I had almost forgotten how much of a loud little bitch you are, bubblegum,\" he teases.",
      "His voice is dark and sultry, and he revels in the whorish moan that bypasses Alex's lips.",
      "\"Fuck you-- God, fuck you, you're not off the hook yet you bastard, I'm still so fucking mad at you, y'know, I--\" Alex stops mid-sentence with a sharp inhale as Apollo rams deeper inside of him.",
      "\"I'm pretty sure I can get you to forgive me, sweet thing.\"",
      "\"You-- you're-- fucking-- fuck-- fuck, David--\" \"That's not my real name, sweetheart,\" Apollo murmurs.",
      "Alex groans.",
      "\"God--",
      "I don't fucking care what your real name is, just, please-- please, don't stop, don't stop -- need-- you, I need you --\" Alex tosses his head back and his hips up with a shaky moan.",
      "A shudder slowly works its way through his muscles, and he clenches his jaw, but not so much so that he's unable to cry out for Apollo anymore.",
      "Apollo hungrily darts his tongue over his grinning, swollen lips as he eyes the exposed skin of Alex's throat.",
      "He brings his mouth to hover over Alex's pulse, yet not once looking away from his face.",
      "His mouth lingers there for a few moments, his breath washing over Alex's throat, before he finally bites down, hard, harder than he has any time before.",
      "Alex yelps.",
      "The sound warps in his mouth, morphing into a noisy groan before it becomes Apollo's name, drawn out and sticky against his teeth.",
      "Apollo squeezes his hips in response.",
      "He growls against his skin, eyes closed, tongue pressed hard against the salty sweat he tastes.",
      "Alex flicks his wrist-- whether or not it was unintentional or on purpose is unknown-- and twists his hand.",
      "He groans again.",
      "\"David,\" Alex whimpers.",
      "Apollo lets it slide this time without correcting him.",
      "\"Please, I need-- please --\" \"What?\"",
      "Apollo pulls back, a thin line of spit delicately connecting his lips and Alex's neck.",
      "\"What do you need?\" Alex doesn't respond.",
      "He's far too busy meeting Apollo's hips and jerking off to try and form a coherent thought, let alone voice a clear answer.",
      "Apollo hums.",
      "He noses along Alex's jaw, kisses the side of his mouth before he pulls away completely to hover over and stare down at him.",
      "Alex catches and returns his gaze, hooded eyes almost entirely black with arousal, his irises swallowed by his pupils, which are blown wide, ink against chocolate.",
      "Apollo's voice drops impossibly low, his words merely a low rumble echoing from the back of his throat.",
      "\"Pretty boy needs to come?",
      "Is that what you need?\"",
      "Another full body shudder racks Alex as he nods frantically, and it makes Apollo feel hot all over, burning coils settling in his pelvis at the knowledge of the effect he has on his boy.",
      "\"Yes-- p-please,\" Alex stutters.",
      "His voice is high pitched, almost splintered.",
      "\"Please, I--\" He's shushed by several kisses pressing against his lips.",
      "Despite the kisses moving behind his ear, his broken pleas still come in spades.",
      "Alex mewls, keening into the soft touch of the god's lips on his skin, his muscles tensing up.",
      "Apollo picks up his pace, and he shoves in deeper, much faster than he had been a few minutes prior.",
      "Alex cries out for him repeatedly, the breaths he's gasping into his lungs becoming shorter and choppier with each passing moment.",
      "He digs his nails into Apollo's shoulder.",
      "Apollo groans; his fingers tighten on Alex's hips and he pins them back down against the mattress before he speaks.",
      "\"Then why,\" he purrs darkly, and Alex whimpers, squeezing his dick in his hand, \"don't you come for me, Alexander?\"",
      "Apollo grins, and Alex grunts a sharp expletive through his teeth.",
      "Apollo breathes out a soft groan and hides his face in the boy's neck as, with an explosive whine, Alex arches his back and comes, weakly rutting his hips up into his hand and Apollo's hips as well, heels scraping against the sheets as he screws his eyes shut tight.",
      "All of his muscles slowly unlock themselves one by one.",
      "He moans as he jerks himself through his orgasm, muttering things ranging from his god's name to various expletives; to muffle the cries coming from his parted lips, Alex bites hard on his lip.",
      "His nails drag down Apollo's shoulder blade, and several angry red lines welt up on Apollo's skin in their wake.",
      "Apollo doesn't even notice them.",
      "Alex slowly relaxes, and he finally sinks back down into the mattress, loose and pliable.",
      "When Alex pulls his lip from his teeth, Apollo sees blood glistening on his skin in the faint moonlight that's streaming in from the window above their bed.",
      "He leans down to suck on the wound; Alex whimpers softly as Apollo presses his tongue to his lip to heal the tear in his skin.",
      "Alex's hand goes from his dick to the sheets, first to shakily wipe it clean and then, as the immortal starts grinding his hips into him again-- Apollo had decided to stop moving while Alex came, but now that he's finished, there's no reason for him to remain still anymore-- to grip the sheets so tight that his knuckles turn white.",
      "Apollo picks up right where he had left off, with deep and hard thrusts into Alex's arching hips, making the pink haired boy whine.",
      "Alex lets his head falls to the side, his lips parted so that his grunted noises easily leave him, and an all-too-familiar light pink blush dusts his cheeks, as it always does when they fuck.",
      "Apollo slides his hand from Alex's hip to wrap around his thigh, grip firm, prying his legs further apart than they previously were; spreading his legs even more presents Apollo with the opportunity to press in deeper.",
      "He doesn't stop pushing in until he's sure that Alex can feel the gentle sloping curve of his hip bones against the soft flesh of his ass.",
      "Alex whimpers not so softly, and Apollo digs his fingers into his skin and snaps his hips forward with a grin.",
      "Alex cries out and squirms every time Apollo moves inside of him, hypersensitive, his fingers twitching against the god's back and his legs spasming.",
      "Apollo can feel his thighs shaking a little at his side and in his hand.",
      "His fingernails prick Alex's skin, and he knows that there are going to be bruises in the shape of his fingers to spring up on Alex's thighs as well as on his hips once they've finished fucking.",
      "He likes that, and he doubts the boy will mind-- Alex has always liked the physical markers of their sex; this should be no different.",
      "Alex groans not so softly, and he pulls hard at the sheets, which are twisted tight around his fist.",
      "His nails bite into Apollo's back; he pulls him closer.",
      "Apollo hisses quietly by the edge of the boy's jaw, his teeth knocking against flesh stretched tight over bone.",
      "He runs his hand from Alex's hip and over his ribs to stop by his shoulder.",
      "He pushes himself up, poised above him.",
      "Alex turns to look up at him-- his eyes are hooded and slightly unfocused.",
      "He unravels the sheets wound up in his fist, and he moves his arm to halo his head, hand laid near where Apollo's hand also rests in the pillows.",
      "Apollo smiles down at him a little bit.",
      "His eyes flicker over the way Alex looks with his sweaty, bright pink bangs plastered to his forehead, the rest of his hair sticking up in all directions from the amount of thrashing he's doing.",
      "His mouth hangs open in a small, silent 'O'; the 'O' grows wider when Alex throws his head back and arches up against Apollo's hips, a loud moan breaking from the centre of his chest to beat back at them.",
      "Apollo allows his gaze to sink lower, over the boy's heaving red chest and sticky white stomach, to Alex's hips.",
      "They're slick and glisten with the mix of their sweat when the light catches his skin.",
      "Pretty, Apollo thinks.",
      "His eyes return to Alex's face and neck-- especially neck.",
      "The shadows make the hickies and bite marks look darker than they really are, appearing more purplish than red, but Apollo likes that.",
      "The whole point of sucking and biting Alex's throat like that was to bruise him, after all.",
      "While the immortal admires him, Alex clenches the hand above his head into a fist, and his nails dig into his palm; his eyes roll back into his head for a few short seconds.",
      "He bites his lip again, his tongue pressed against the spot where Apollo had healed him.",
      "He's already semi-hard again, something that Apollo can feel as their bodies slide against one another each time he moves.",
      "\"You're hot when you're like this, you know that?\"",
      "Apollo groans softly.",
      "\"Like what?\" Alex finally pants.",
      "\"Like, y'know--\" Apollo stops to punctuate his grunted \"-- this\" with a sharp snap of his hips.",
      "Alex yelps at the sudden sharpness of the thrust.",
      "\"Being fucked.\"",
      "Alex closes his eyes and tilts his head back, the yelp from a few seconds earlier melting into a groan at the immortal's words.",
      "The thrust was hard enough to push him up in the pillows; his head had almost knocked against the headboard, and Apollo used his tight grip on his leg to pull Alex back towards him after he noticed it.",
      "\"Yeah?\" Alex whines, high in his throat.",
      "When he opens his eyes again, he catches Apollo's gaze and holds it as he speaks.",
      "\"You really-- hnnnnghgnfuck -- y'really think so?\" Apollo grins.",
      "He squeezes Alex's thigh, and his smile widens at the soft noise that Alex makes in response.",
      "\"Mm, of course I do Alex-- I can't lie to you, remember?\" he murmurs.",
      "\"You're always hot when you're taking dick, pretty boy.",
      "Especially mine.\"",
      "Alex groans again.",
      "He turns his head to the side, pushing his hips up off of the mattress as he does.",
      "Despite him turning away, Apollo can still see the way Alex's cheeks shift from flushing pale pink to burning a bright hot scarlet in the dark, obviously flustered at the god's words-- as he usually is when Apollo starts talking dirty-filthy like this.",
      "Alex's semi becomes a full hard on.",
      "The friction of their bodies pries another deep moan up from the depths of Alex's chest and out into the room, where it curls around them like smoke.",
      "\"Oh,\" Alex whimpers simply.",
      "\"I-- thank you-- hhnnnnhhfghfh --\" He sounds breathless, and it isn't like Apollo can blame him-- he's very aware of the fact that he's a good fuck (better than just good, actually, but he doesn't want to sound too full of himself), and it's not unusual for Apollo to leave his partners breathless.",
      "Alex is no exception-- that's what 3000-plus years of practice in the fine art of intercourse does for a guy.",
      "But that's not the point.",
      "The point is that Alex is breathless, and he's gasping out Apollo's name every time he draws in a breath; his teeth are clenched against his broken words, as if he's trying to keep how wrecked he sounds locked tight inside of his mouth.",
      "It doesn't work in the least.",
      "Alex looks and sounds like he's shattering.",
      "Apollo finds it beautiful.",
      "Alex's voice is more splintered than it was five minutes ago.",
      "Tears form in the corners of his eyes, and they threaten to spill over and onto his cheeks every time their bodies meet in a collision of skin and faint slapping sounds.",
      "Alex blinks a few times to try and rid himself of the tears, but it doesn't work, and he settles on closing his eyes once more to combat the urge to cry from all the stimulation-- it's so much, probably more than he's ever felt in his life, and the burn of Apollo moving inside of him hurts but it's so good, God it's such a good burn and he can't get enough of it (at least, that's what Apollo picks up in the tone of the whimpered mewls that slide from between Alex's teeth every other minute or so).",
      "Alex's hand unclenches and inches towards his scalp.",
      "He twists strands of his own hair around his fingers, but he doesn't pull.",
      "Instead, he just lets his hand sit there, fingers tight, until Apollo thrusts slow and he practically stops.",
      "Alex opens his eyes again; his hand goes limp against the top of his head.",
      "\"N-no, don't-- don't stop,\" he groans.",
      "Apollo feels the hand on his back traverse his skin to grab at his lower back as Alex speaks.",
      "\"Babe-- don't stop, please, A-- ah--\" Alex's statement erupts into a sob.",
      "Apollo digs his hips in deep, almost like he's trying to carve parts of Alex's body out one little piece at a time so that they fit together even more perfectly, and Alex's cry breaks from him in the form of a choked plea for something unintelligible.",
      "He grips his hair again and pulls, hard.",
      "The tears welling in Alex's eyes finally spill over, sliding down the sides of his face at the same time that his cock begins leaking precome.",
      "There's a weak sting that stretches from the base of Apollo's spine to his left hip, and he can only assume that it's due to Alex dragging his nails through his skin again.",
      "The sobs coming from Alex's lips die off after a few minutes.",
      "They turn into obscenely loud moans instead, and Alex shifts to wrap his legs around Apollo's abdomen, ankles locked together at his back.",
      "His muscles tense again.",
      "Apollo's hand glides over his skin, his nails lightly scraping against the pink haired boy's flesh as he makes his way to Alex's dick.",
      "Apollo wraps his fingers around him; his hand is cold, and Alex gasps in surprise, an expletive tangled up on his tongue, and arches his chest up into the god above him in response.",
      "Apollo smirks as he slowly jerks Alex off.",
      "Alex stutters out several moans in a row as Apollo pumps him, and he lets his head fall to the side, fingers tight in his hair again.",
      "Apollo makes out a few more tears sliding down the side of his face in the silvery wisps of light streaming in from the window.",
      "They compliment the way Alex's chest heaves as he starts to cry again.",
      "This time, the tears last for a while.",
      "Each time Apollo snaps his hips forward, Alex makes some pathetic whimpery noise from the back of his throat and a few more tears slide out, only they trace the curve of his nose instead of leaving glistening tracks from his eyes to his hairline.",
      "When Alex turns back to face Apollo, they go back to disappearing in his hair again.",
      "Apollo leans down and presses a gentle kiss to the side of Alex's left eye.",
      "\"I've never seen you cry during sex before, bubblegum,\" he whispers, his breath hot.",
      "His lips brush against Alex's wet skin as he speaks.",
      "\"It's kinda hot, y'know.\"",
      "Alex whimpers and keens up into Apollo's hand.",
      "\"Yeah, well you-- fuck, hnnnnghgGod-- you've never fucked me quite like this before e-either,\" he pants.",
      "\"God Apollo, it's-- it's so fucking much, and-- and it feels so g-- ah-- ah --\" Apollo cuts Alex off by brushing his thumb over the slit in the head of his cock, and he twists his wrist while he's at it.",
      "Alex chokes on his breath as he bucks his hips up.",
      "When Apollo moves his thumb, more precome dribbles out and over his fingers.",
      "He looks down, his eyes lingering for a few seconds before he looks back up at Alex, whose face is contorted in pleasure, and then down at his dick again.",
      "Apollo grins.",
      "Apollo releases Alex's dick only to reach up and grab his chin.",
      "He stops moving; Alex whines and pushes his hips down, desperate for some kind of stimulation.",
      "The movement causes Apollo to groan softly as Alex lets go of his hair to grab Apollo's shoulder.",
      "\"Apollo,\" Alex whines pathetically.",
      "\"Move--\" Apollo cuts him off by shoving his thumb into Alex's mouth.",
      "\"Shhhhhh,\" he whispers, pushing down on Alex's tongue.",
      "Alex makes a small noise and his eyelids droop.",
      "\"No more talking, baby.",
      "Just watch me.",
      "I know you like to.\"",
      "Apollo pulls out in a single swift movement, and Alex whimpers quietly, unhappy at the empty feeling settling hollowly in his chest.",
      "Regardless, he begins sucking on Apollo's thumb as the god kisses down his body.",
      "Apollo feels the bed shift ever so slightly; he feels the hand on his shoulder disappear moments later.",
      "He glances up to meet Alex's gaze in the dark so that he knows Alex is watching him and finds that Alex had pushed himself up onto his elbows so that it would be easier to watch Apollo.",
      "When their eyes meet, Alex whimpers softly.",
      "Without any warning and without breaking eye contact, Apollo pulls his thumb out of Alex's mouth the very moment he takes Alex's cock into his mouth.",
      "Alex gasps, jumbling different expletives up in his mouth, and pushes his hips up.",
      "The action forces more of his dick into Apollo's mouth, and he gladly takes it.",
      "As Apollo begins to bob his head, Alex moans, letting his head fall to the side.",
      "Apollo stops bobbing just as quickly as he'd started.",
      "He reaches up and grabs Alex's chin again.",
      "Apollo forces the boy to look at him, and he says, \"I told you to watch me, so I expect you to watch me, Alexander.\"",
      "\"'M sorry Apollo, I--\" Apollo pushes two of his fingers into Alex's mouth.",
      "\"I also told you to stop talking.\"",
      "When Alex offers only a small moan in response, Apollo hums.",
      "He dips his head down to give a teasing lick along the shaft of Alex's dick.",
      "Alex pushes his hips up with a straining whine, but he doesn't look away.",
      "The god smiles.",
      "\"Good boy,\" he praises.",
      "\"Now watch me.",
      "And don't stop watching me.\"",
      "Apollo takes Alex's cock back into his mouth to the sound of Alex groaning quietly around his fingers.",
      "He reaches up to wrap his free hand around Alex's thigh to hold him in place while he blows him, and Alex hooks his knees over Apollo's shoulders.",
      "Apollo feels Alex's heels digging into his back, right under his shoulder blades.",
      "He pays it no mind.",
      "Instead, he swallows around Alex's cock and sinks down until he feels him hit the back of his throat.",
      "Apollo pauses long enough to breathe before he begins to bob his head again.",
      "Alex chokes on a groan, the sound muffled in his mouth.",
      "His head falls back on his shoulders, and he curls his hands into fists by his side.",
      "Apollo pushes down on Alex's tongue.",
      "Alex gags just a little, and Apollo forces him to tilt his chin back down and look him in the eyes again.",
      "He stops and digs his fingernails into Alex's thigh, a warning for Alex to keep his eyes on him.",
      "Alex whimpers out a noise of submission, and Apollo moans in response.",
      "The vibrations travel from Alex's dick to spread through the rest of his bones.",
      "Alex groans softly; Apollo feels Alex's heels dig into his back as he pushes his hips up again.",
      "Apollo takes it with another moan, this time of appreciation.",
      "A hissed curse slips past Alex's lips into the room, getting lost in the moonlight and the sucking sound coming from between the boy's legs.",
      "Apollo pulls back and swirls his tongue around the head of Alex's cock to clear it of all the precome.",
      "Alex bucks his hips up in an effort to force his dick back in Apollo's mouth like it was before and receives an admonishing smack against his thigh in return.",
      "He yelps in pain-- as much as he can, anyway, with two fingers halfway down his throat, gagging him.",
      "Apollo presses his tongue against the slit in Alex's cock before he pulls his fingers out of the pink haired boy's mouth.",
      "Alex barely has time to miss them before Apollo shoves them inside of his ass.",
      "They slide in easily thanks to the coating of spit that came from being in Alex's mouth.",
      "\"Oh, fuck-- my God, Apollo --\" Apollo exhales slowly when he feels Alex grab a fistful of his hair and yank on it.",
      "A quick glance up shows him that Alex once again let his head fall back onto his shoulders, and he slaps Alex's thigh again as a final warning to watch.",
      "When Alex looks back down again, Apollo sinks back down on his cock, not stopping until his nose presses against Alex's skin.",
      "He waits a few seconds before swallowing, and when he swallows, Apollo's mouth goes cold.",
      "Alex groans, loud and filthy, his eyelids fluttering for a few seconds.",
      "Apollo stays still and focuses his attention on fingering the boy in his mouth.",
      "He thrusts his fingers in deep, scissoring them apart and twisting them as he does, watching as Alex squirms and bites his lip to stifle all the whorish moans escaping him.",
      "Apollo makes a beckoning motion with his fingers, and he adds a third when he elicits a groan from the boy.",
      "Alex gasps and arches up.",
      "The arch of his hips nearly causes Apollo to gag on him, since he wasn't expecting it, and he chokes-- entirely for Alex's pleasure, though, and nothing more-- before recovering.",
      "Apollo pushes his fingers in deeper, thrusting until Alex chokes and spits \"God--",
      "God right there right there, fuck --\" through his teeth.",
      "Apollo hums triumphantly at having found Alex's prostate, and he starts to bob his head.",
      "He matches his bobs with the speed of his fingers.",
      "In a mere matter of minutes, Apollo manages to reduce Alex to a whiny, begging mess (again), one who's pulling on Apollo's hair like it's the only thing tying him down and being so loud that Apollo genuinely fears they'll get a noise complaint the next morning (it wouldn't be the first time they'd gotten in trouble for fucking too loud).",
      "Apollo makes out little diamonds glistening on the corners of Alex's eyes at some point.",
      "If he could smirk, he would.",
      "Apollo had no idea would like seeing Alex cry when he fucked him this much.",
      "\"Apollo,\" Alex gasps, his voice raspy.",
      "His eyelids droop to cover his eyes, which are half hidden by the mess of sweaty pink hair in his face.",
      "\"Apollo-- fuck-- please --\" Apollo moans, and he thrusts his fingers in as deep as he can.",
      "He beckons upwards.",
      "Alex yanks on Apollo's hair hard enough to hurt and groans, pushing his hips down into the immortal's hand, an attempt to get more of what he wants.",
      "Apollo can see his eyes roll back a little bit, so he makes the motion again, just to see Alex's eyes roll back-- this time all the way back-- again.",
      "Alex lets out a guttural curse, one of his legs sliding off of Apollo's back to press flat against the mattress.",
      "He pushes his hips up with a pant of moans.",
      "\"Fuck,\" Alex manages to get out.",
      "He squeezes his eyes shut and repeats himself.",
      "His chest heaves with silent, pleasured sobs before he opens his eyes again, looking back down at Apollo.",
      "With his teeth bared, he groans, \"Babe-- Apollo, I-- 'm gonna-- fuck-- come --\" Apollo moans (Alex gasps and cries out) and kicks what he's doing into overdrive.",
      "He repeats the same series of motions with his fingers-- thrusting deep and then curling upwards-- only this time he adds to it by pressing his thumb against Alex's perineum, knowing that his perineum is basically another G-spot for him.",
      "Apollo revels in the wheezy, whiny sobs Alex lets out, and the way his thighs shake every time Apollo moves, and the way he can feel Alex's other hand in his hair now, trying to force him down on his cock with as much strength as he can manage as he leans back against the pillows.",
      "Alex whines, the sound needy and desperate.",
      "Apollo looks up at him, and he digs his nails into Alex's thigh as they make eye contact.",
      "He tries to convey come for me with his eyes as he slowly comes up on Alex's dick and then sharply back down.",
      "Alex chokes, a cry caught in his chest, a few tears rolling down his cheeks.",
      "His grip on Apollo's hair tightens to the point where it actually makes the god wince a little bit.",
      "Apollo flutters his lashes and moans, his tongue pressed against the underside of Alex's cock and his fingers curled up inside of him.",
      "Alex cries out, loud, and more tears stream down his face.",
      "Once again, Apollo tries to get Alex to understand the message behind his eyes, only this time it works.",
      "\"God--\" Alex's voice is strained, and he's panting like he can't get enough air into his lungs (and truthfully, maybe he can't).",
      "\"Apollo...\" Apollo's name trails off into a high pitched moan.",
      "Alex's mouth hangs open, his shoulders hunched in, and he eyes flutter before snapping completely shut.",
      "Alex ruts his hips one last time, and then he comes, straight down Apollo's throat, with a strangled, wavering cry.",
      "He pulls hard on Apollo's hair, forcing him down.",
      "Apollo nearly chokes, for real this time, as he swallows, but he does swallow-- spitters are quitters, and besides, he likes how Alex tastes.",
      "Apollo squeezes Alex's thigh once he's swallowed.",
      "Alex responds with a loud whine.",
      "The whine ends with a grunt caused by Apollo pulling his fingers out of Alex's ass and wrapping his hand around his other thigh.",
      "Apollo doesn't pull off of his cock immediately after Alex comes.",
      "He waits until he feels him start getting soft before sitting up, his eyes still trained hard on Alex. Alex has collapsed against the bed by that point, emitting gentle moans and noises periodically, his chest and stomach heaving in unison as he tries to remember how to think and breathe properly again.",
      "Apollo wipes the drool and come that had dribbled down his chin off on the sheets crumpled up beside of him.",
      "Once he's clean, he presses a kiss against Alex's inner thigh, then his hip, then his stomach, steadily moving upwards until he reaches his mouth.",
      "\"How was that bubblegum?\"",
      "Apollo asks, hints of a smirk on the corners of his mouth.",
      "Alex doesn't offer a worded reply.",
      "All he does is whimper and shakily reach up to grab Apollo's shoulder.",
      "\"I'll take that it was good, then,\" Apollo murmurs in response to himself.",
      "He kisses Alex again-- Alex feeds a pathetic moan into Apollo's mouth at the lingering taste of his own come, but that's all he really offers the immortal, and Apollo quickly bores of kissing someone who can't kiss back.",
      "He pulls back and moves to mouth at his neck instead.",
      "As he gently kisses Alex's throat, Apollo reaches down between them and starts to sloppily jerk himself off.",
      "He'd gone a bit soft while he was sucking Alex off.",
      "Once he grows back to full hardness, Apollo lets go of his dick and uses his hands to spread Alex's legs again, lining himself up.",
      "They'd wobbled kind of closed once Apollo had moved from between them.",
      "Alex, who's fucked out and oblivious, pays Apollo's actions no mind-- that is, until he feels a push, and suddenly Apollo's dick is inside of him again, unmoving.",
      "\"Oh fucking-- fuck-- \" Alex groans and his back rises off the mattress at the sudden intrusion.",
      "\"David-- Apollo-- \" Apollo cuts him off by biting his throat, and hard, which earns him a choked yelp of pain and pleasure.",
      "\"What?",
      "Did you think that we were finished?\" Alex nods, and Apollo chuckles softly.",
      "\"I haven't even come yet, Alexander.\"",
      "\"Fucking-- goddammit--\" Alex's mouth falls open with a sharp, high pitched whine that breaks as he cries out, loud and through clenched teeth, as Apollo starts grinding into him once again.",
      "His nails bite hard into the flesh of Apollo's shoulder, and he arches his torso up against the god above him.",
      "Apollo cages him in with his arms, one on either side of his head.",
      "He uses his own body to force Alex down, back flat against the mattress.",
      "The room fills with every kind of sound imaginable to man.",
      "Alex, super hypersensitive after coming twice in a row, can't keep quiet, with needy moans and desperate, whorish whines bypassing his open mouth, and he certainly can't keep still either.",
      "Every time Apollo moves, he spasms; his thighs shake and his hips twitch into Apollo's thrusts.",
      "It's a system that feeds itself and results in Alex crying-- and really crying this time, with sobs intermingled between the moans and tears making his face catch the moonlight more than the sweat does.",
      "Apollo doesn't care how sensitive Alex is, though.",
      "Sure, his pace is even and calculated, but it's hard and rough and fast, and it's no wonder Alex is holding onto him so tight he's sure to leave a few bruises in the morning (and maybe that's exactly what Apollo wants).",
      "Apollo dips his head down and presses their lips together.",
      "Kissing Alex distracts Apollo enough to slow him down a small bit; his hips stutter, but he keeps going, only it's slow enough for Alex to handle without crying.",
      "He kisses Apollo back, his hands going from the immortal's shoulders to his face, holding him there.",
      "It's sloppy-- teeth knock together and they bite lips more than they kiss them-- but it's good enough for them.",
      "\"I missed you,\" Apollo whispers into Alex's mouth.",
      "He thrusts hard after he says it, and Alex accidentally and unknowingly bites Apollo's lip.",
      "The pain makes him groan as he repeats, \"I missed you-- so-- fucking-- much.\"",
      "Apollo punctuates each word with a sharp snap of his hips.",
      "Alex can't speak for gasping for a few moments, and he's still so breathless that his reply is raspy.",
      "\"Missed you too,\" Alex whimpers.",
      "\"So much.",
      "So much-- hhhnhhnnggn -- God, fuck-- fuck, Apollo --\" Apollo cuts him off by kissing him one last time before he pushes in deep and then deeper still.",
      "Alex gets progressively louder as he squirms underneath him.",
      "He starts crying again, harder than he was before, messy sobs ricocheting around the room to squeeze back down his throat as he gasps for air.",
      "He gets half-hard again.",
      "The only word that leaves Alex's lips is Apollo's name, but it's broken, reduced to the single-syllable \"Pol\"-- that's all his brain can come up with.",
      "That's all he remembers how to say.",
      "Apollo pulls out for a brief moment-- Alex grunts and whines, his eyes opening the slightest bit to glance down to try to see what the hell his sex god is doing.",
      "He looks down just in time to watch Apollo line up and ram into him again, and this time he hits Alex's prostate head on and the boy's brain explodes into static-- all he can focus on is the feeling of Apollo inside of him and all around him, trapping him in and holding him there so he can't get away.",
      "\"Pol-- oh my God, fuck-- fuck me --\" Alex's voice rises with every syllable, but it's strained, as if he's holding back.",
      "Apollo leans down to press their lips together in another extremely sloppy kiss.",
      "\"C'mon bubblegum-- be loud for me, you know I like when you're loud,\" he urges against the boy's lips.",
      "Ever the obedient one, the next time Alex cries, \"Apollo--\" his pitch is higher and his broken little voice echoes back at them from the thin walls.",
      "Apollo half grins, half smirks at him.",
      "\"Good,\" he groans.",
      "Apollo snaps his hips forward hard enough to make Alex choke on his air.",
      "\"But I want you to be louder pretty boy-- I don't think the neighbours can hear you.\"",
      "Apollo pauses long enough to readjust to a new position, and when he does, he rams into the pink haired boy squirming under him.",
      "Alex finally lets loose with the scream that's been hovering in the back of his throat, probably since Apollo started fucking him again.",
      "The scream starts in his chest and breaks outwards, splintered and visceral and oh, so loud.",
      "The god grins and pushes his hips in deeper.",
      "\"Yeah-- that's my good boy-- scream for me Alexander-- my loud little bitch,\" Apollo growls darkly against Alex's cheek Alex claws along the length of Apollo's spine, and although Apollo can feel blood bubbling to the surface of his skin, he pays it no mind.",
      "He doesn't care if he's bleeding.",
      "He cares about the way that Alex is screaming his name and crying \"fuck-- fuck, fuck me Pol right there right there God please right there fuck -- fuckmedon'tstopdon'tstopdon'tstopfuckplease--\" so guttural and rough and loud that his voice finally shatters and he's left choking on pathetic, wheezy sobs.",
      "Apollo cares that Alex's fingers ache on his hips, so much so that Apollo thinks Alex is trying to pull him inside of him entirely, but he doesn't mind.",
      "He wants it-- craves it, actually.",
      "Anything to be closer to Alex is great by him.",
      "Alex arches his hips up.",
      "His eyes are squeezed shut and he's shaking so much it would be frightening under any other circumstance.",
      "His cock twitches-- Apollo feels it against his stomach.",
      "Apollo reaches up and wraps his fingers around Alex's throat.",
      "He squeezes, and if Alex could make any sort of noise besides the wheezing sob he's been stuck on for several minutes, Apollo's sure he would moan for him again.",
      "Alex tilts his head back and Apollo seizes his opportunity to attach his mouth to the exposed skin of his jaw.",
      "He bites him, hard; there's a painful burning on his shoulder blades.",
      "He's positive that Alex has scratched him in response.",
      "\"Come,\" Apollo grunts against his skin.",
      "A choked moan vibrates against his palm as Alex wheezes, trying to communicate back with him.",
      "He squeezes tighter. \"",
      "Come -- fuck-- Alex --\" Alex whimpers and digs his nails into Apollo's skin.",
      "His back arches.",
      "If he could moan-- or make any sort of noise, for that matter-- he would, but all Alex is able to manage with a wrecked voice is a few breathless puffs of air.",
      "Apollo can feel his chest heave, and he feels him go completely tense for a few seconds before his hips push down, desperate to take as much of Apollo's cock as possible.",
      "Alex comes, somehow for a third time, toes curled into the sheets and fingers digging into Apollo's skin.",
      "Apollo feels Alex get tight, so fucking tight, around his dick as the boy comes.",
      "It feels-- he can't describe how it feels.",
      "It feels like everything he could ever want.",
      "It's tight and hot and so much friction he hadn't noticed before and so purely Alex that it doesn't feel possible.",
      "It only takes a series of sharp, sloppy thrusts for Apollo to come as well, his teeth sunk deep into the flesh of Alex's right shoulder to muffle the groan scraping past his throat.",
      "Alex whimpers softly, fingernails dug weakly into Apollo's biceps, his hips raising ever so slightly as the immortal fills him up.",
      "Apollo weakly ruts his hips forward a few times, each movement met with an equally as pathetic moan from Alex, before he stops.",
      "He waits for his brain to reconnect to the rest of his nervous system before he finally pulls out.",
      "Alex whines quietly as Apollo pulls out and rolls off of him, but other than that, the pink haired boy is silent.",
      "They both are, actually, as they stare at the ceiling and listen to one another gasp for air, too afraid to actually initiate any more contact with one another, verbal or physical, in case it blows up in their face.",
      "Alex is the first to move.",
      "He hesitantly slides closer to Apollo after wiping his face free of the tear tracks, and he presses himself against the god's side.",
      "He rests his head against Apollo's shoulder.",
      "It's a while longer before they speak-- they still have to catch their breath first, after all-- and once again, it's Alex who breaks the silence.",
      "\"'M still so incredibly pissed off at you, y'know,\" he mumbles.",
      "His voice is scratchy and hoarse, but he doesn't exactly sound angry.",
      "He sounds the opposite of it, actually.",
      "It's enough to make Apollo smile, tired.",
      "\"Damn,\" he says quietly back.",
      "\"I was hoping that I could somehow get you to forgive me through good sex.\"",
      "\"Mm, not quite.",
      "I'm not that easy, asshole.",
      "I'm still really upset at how much of an insensitive fucking tool you are.\"",
      "Alex makes a soft sound and rolls over so that he's laying with his head on Apollo's chest.",
      "He places his ear right over the god's heart to listen to it beat.",
      "Apollo feels Alex's hand seeking his out in the dim light of the room, and the pink haired boy threads their fingers together as soon as he finds Apollo's hand.",
      "Alex pulls their entwined hands to his mouth and presses his lips against their knuckles.",
      "The gesture makes Apollo's chest flutter.",
      "He ignores it, chalking it up as some post-sex sensation he's too tired to comprehend (but that's not at all what it is), and distracts himself by running his fingers through Alex's hair.",
      "\"Besides,\" Alex adds, his eyes closing tiredly against the gentle scrape of Apollo's nails against his scalp, \"the sex wasn't good.\"",
      "\"Oh?\"",
      "Apollo grimaces subtly at the disappointment that creeps into his voice.",
      "\"It was great sex, Apollo,\" Alex murmurs with a sore-sounding little chuckle.",
      "He very faintly squeezes Apollo's hand in his.",
      "\"We always have great sex, you know that.",
      "Dumbass.\"",
      "\"Oh.\"",
      "This time, Apollo says it with a smile.",
      "Alex laughs softly one last time before he readjusts the way he's laying on Apollo's chest, snuggling closer to him-- no doubt to sap as much of his body heat as he can.",
      "After that, they're silent for a long time.",
      "Apollo listens as Alex's breathing evens out while he himself stares at the ceiling.",
      "He can't find sleep as easily as Alex appears to; his brain won't shut off.",
      "It keeps swirling, a hazy mess of escaping euphoria being chased by a small spark of dread.",
      "Apollo bites the inside of his cheek.",
      "\"Hey, Alex?\"",
      "He's afraid that Alex won't answer, that he's already asleep, but to his surprise, the pink haired boy in his arms responds.",
      "\"Hmm?\" Alex hums.",
      "He sounds sleepy.",
      "\"I-- I'm really sorry to keep you awake, but I want to-- I don't know.",
      "Talk to you.",
      "For just a second, anyway,\" Apollo whispers, and he sounds nervous and almost scared even to his own ears.",
      "Alex pushes himself up to look at Apollo, having picked up on his tone.",
      "He hovers over Apollo and looks down at him with his brows knitted together.",
      "\"What's on your mind, my darling?\" he asks gently and quietly.",
      "Apollo hesitates; he spends too long staring up into Alex's eyes, almost wishing he could crawl inside of them and stay there forever.",
      "When Alex raises one of his eyebrows, Apollo forces himself to focus again.",
      "\"I-- I-- I--\" Apollo's voice breaks on the last one, and he stops with a soft, annoyed sigh.",
      "He mentally curses himself for stuttering so goddamn much.",
      "\"I'm... sorry.\"",
      "Alex tilts his head to the side just a small bit and runs his hand over Apollo's chest, stopping when he reaches his shoulder.",
      "\"I know you are, love.\"",
      "\"No, Alex, I'm really really sorry-- about everything-- about using you, and keeping information about myself from you, about treating you like shit in the beginning, about absolutely everything I may have done against you, including the shit I said to you earlier today, and I-- I wasn't-- I wasn't--\" He stops and takes a short breath.",
      "Alex waits, his fingers gently tracing over Apollo's skin as the god recomposes himself.",
      "Apollo swallows around the lump in his throat.",
      "\"I'm sorry.",
      "I was wrong to do all of that.",
      "And...",
      "I wasn't joking earlier when I said I wanted to fix us.\"",
      "\"I know you weren't, D-- Apollo,\" Alex repeats as his gaze flickers from Apollo's biceps to his mismatched eyes.",
      "\"Sorry.",
      "I'm still not entirely used to your name.\"",
      "\"It's alright, I don't mind it.\"",
      "He pauses.",
      "\"Look Alex, I...",
      "I know a guy,\" Apollo says.",
      "Alex's expression changes in a way that he doesn't like, and Apollo rushes out, \"I know a guy who-- who works in couples counselling, and I-- we could get an appointment and he can help us, like, really help us Alex, and I want to do that, I really do--\" His voice drops to something less than a breath.",
      "\"But only if it's something you want to do too.\"",
      "They fall silent again.",
      "Apollo can feel his pulse pounding in his throat and his ears as Alex lightly drags his nails over his biceps.",
      "He's so goddamn scared that Alex is going to say no.",
      "If he does, Apollo has no fucking clue what he'll do then, he really doesn't.",
      "It feels like centuries before Alex finally speaks.",
      "He doesn't whisper, and his voice is serious.",
      "\"You said you couldn't lie, right?\"",
      "Although confused as to what this has to do with anything, Apollo nods.",
      "\"Yeah.",
      "And I know when people are lying to me, too.\"",
      "\"Do you really want to fix our relationship?\"",
      "\"Yes,\" Apollo breathes.",
      "\"Gods, yes, I do.\"",
      "\"Why?\" Alex sounds so small, and it makes Apollo feel a multitude of things.",
      "He feels guilty that Alex even feels the need to ask.",
      "It's his fault, and Apollo knows it.",
      "But he also feels a rush of something else-- something that makes him want to protect Alex.",
      "Something that makes him want to hold Alex and never let go of him again.",
      "\"Because I want to be with you, Alexander William Gaskarth.\"",
      "Alex stares at him for a while.",
      "Apollo stares back at him and holds his breath, anxious to see what Alex has to say next.",
      "Neither of them speak or move until finally, Alex half smiles.",
      "\"Okay.\"",
      "He smiles a little bit wider.",
      "\"Okay.",
      "We'll talk about making an appointment with this guy of yours when we wake up tomorrow morning.",
      "Right now, though, I just want to sleep, because I'm tired and so so so sore and you're warm and comfortable and I want you to hold me because I missed you.\"",
      "\"Okay,\" Apollo echoes, also mirroring the little smile that's perched prettily on Alex's lips.",
      "\"Go to sleep bubblegum.\"",
      "\"I'm going to-- and you better go to sleep too.\"",
      "Alex leans down and very gently presses his lips against Apollo's.",
      "The kiss only lasts for a few short seconds before Alex pulls back some few inches.",
      "\"Goodnight.\"",
      "Apollo places his hand on Alex's cheek and leans up to close the rest of the distance between them.",
      "He makes this kiss last a fair bit longer than the one previous, but not so long that it loses its sweetness as a goodnight kiss.",
      "Apollo pulls back and gently bumps their noses together before he settles back against the pillow.",
      "He had hoped it would make Alex smile, and to his pleasure, it does.",
      "\"Goodnight my love,\" Apollo murmurs, stroking his thumb over Alex's cheek.",
      "\"Goodnight my darling.\"",
      "Alex bites his lip.",
      "\"I love you.\"",
      "Apollo's smile falters.",
      "\"Alex--\" Alex turns his head to kiss Apollo's palm.",
      "\"It's fine-- for tonight, it's fine.",
      "Just know that I love you.",
      "And... and that I'm glad you came back.",
      "I'm glad I let you in.\"",
      "\"As am I,\" Apollo says.",
      "Relief spreads through his bones, replacing the guilt that had filled the marrow when Alex had told him he loved him, as he watches the boy settle back against his chest.",
      "\"Goodnight.",
      "Again.",
      "Sleep well, bubblegum.\"",
      "\"I will.",
      "You're here-- I'll sleep great.",
      "Goodnight, Apollo.",
      "I love you.\"",
      "Alex falls asleep not long after that.",
      "Apollo, however, stays awake just a little bit longer and resumes staring at the ceiling.",
      "He doesn't think about anything in particular as he follows the familiar popcorn pattern above him with his eyes.",
      "His brain fleets from thought to thought: he thinks about how happy he is that he decided to come over; and how hopeful he feels about their future together; and what kind of future they'll even have together; and then, finally, right before he falls asleep, about how he's not at all looking forward to calling Eros's office in the morning. -fin-"

    "text": "There was dust on her hand, etching it's way between the crevices: coating her nails. Gold for the sunflowers she adored, gold for her hair in soft light, gold for tint of her cheeks. She rubbed the dust within her palm absentmindedly. Her hands were dry. There wasn't much to do about that she decided - she had much to do, too much to do. There were preparations to be made, people to talk to - mothers to comfort. An empty bed to lay beside. No. This was her job. She could fix this, make it better - rid her dry, dry hands of this putrid dust. She recalled the moment it happened. The slow decline of the flower her lover had held. Her sharp features, softer as they collapsed under a wave of gold. A hand reaching for her, eyes desperate, mouth - No. There was too much to do. She couldn't. She didn't have time to think; to cry, to mourn, to plead. She rubbed at her palm again and looked up in contemplation. She had a plan - a solid plan, she thought. It would fix this. All of this. It had to. As she scraped her thumb against her palm for the third time, she stood up and began to jog along the barren corridors. There would be no more 'dust'. Everything would go back to normal. Her heels bellowed along the marble that adorned floor, a chill residing from them that coated her bones. As her destination rose in her peripheral vision, feet rouge from the force exerted, she curled up her hair - the black locks tightly forming a braided crown. Yes, she thought, this would do nicely. Her hands flung up but this time to meet the harsh jutting rocks she was quickly approaching. They scraped harshly against the sides, rocks digging their way into her palm. Her dust coated hands now torn at the edges. She lifted a hand up - -and began to climb. Continued to climb, even as her thighs burned, even as sweat dripped down her eyes, even as the skin on her feet cracked: until she could see the top. Until jagged stone turned to long forgotten fields of cracked wheat, until the blackened landscape turned a dirty blue mulled with dull greys. When her now bloodied hands felt that dry crackle of yellowed grass oppose to jagged rock, she cried a breath, arms straining under the weight of pulling herself up, collapsing underneath her and she slowly found the energy to turn when a voice above made itself known. \"Who the fuck are you and what are you doing in my blasted field?\" She looked up and noted a man drawn with wrinkles around each corner with hair as grey as the clouds gathering above. Still laying on the ground - rubbing her palm absentmindedly with her ring finger, she looked up and met the man's gaze - \"They call me Hades. I've come to save my wife\" The old man, who later introduced himself half reluctantly as Henry, somehow affectionately short for Harold he grumbled - had clearly taken pity on her, Hades thought as they slowly trekked through acres of dry dust. Her foot shuffled and kicked up dust - she watched as it halfheartedly flew away with child-like effort as the faint breeze grasped desperately for it like a mother and an escaping toddler. Why? Hades pondered - perhaps it was because of the state of her hair? the rips in her dress? Maybe the sheer lack of shoes took him by surprise? \"Where are you taking me?\" Hades inquired, curiosity crawling out of her tightly locked lips. \"Home. To my wife.\" \"Why? Why with me?\" \"Why?\", Henry scoffed, \"Because I just met a batshit crazy lady out in my bleeding field claiming to be the God of death and dressed to the bloody nines as my late grandma would've - bless her soul. If my wife would've find out an' I didn't help yah? I'd be in the doghouse.\" Hades paused for half a step and frowned. She wasn't particularly dressed any differently than how she did last time she was on this plane - she had kept up with the height of fashion then. A blue ankle-length dress, tightly upkept hair: nothing excessive. But then, Hades supposed - rubbing her palm, mortals do have an exceptionally short life-time; more often than not fleeting and unused. She would know best after all. She remembered the stacks of death records piled up, the ink still present and smudged on the edge of her hand even now. She tilted her head in inclination of a nod but then noted the emphasis Henry had put on the word 'God'. \"Why does everyone assume I am a male?\" She asked, a hint of bitterness poisoning her words and relying her thoughts on the, if she did say so, rather sexist presumption. \"You mean why does everyone assume the Greek god of death in mythology is a guy?\" \"That's exactly what I said\" Hades puzzled. She drew in half a breath and reluctantly with a wince and her hand half held out in a reassuring position questioned, \"Do you perhaps need hearing aids? Forgive me for asking of course\". \"Jesus fucking Christ\" \"I...think you'd find that to be rather impossible considering Jesus and Christ are in fact, the same person\" Henry sighed. \"Look kid, you really wanna know? It's just how it is, I don't know why okay?\" Hades grumbled, \"that doesn't seem very fair\" \"Yeah life isn't kid.\" She supposed that was fair. Life was cruel in a way no one would ever claim had they not seen the serenity of death. Life was awfully lonely, Hades thought. \"What you doing here anyway?\" \"I told you. I'm here to save my wife.\" \"Yeah? Course you are. Bet she's Persephone too eh?\" Hades frowned, mortals often didn't know them - perhaps this man was a deity in disguise? a demi-god perhaps? The days the Hellenic ruled were long gone. Her brothers and sisters left to merely grasp on the edges of their domains, to cry only a whisper of power. She began to study the man more in-depth - a microscopic focus. His veins red apparent with blood, different from the ichor gold within her own. He was aged and whilst kind-looking, not in an overly graceful manor thanks to the perpetual frown painted on the corner of his lips. No. This man was no God, no higher power. \"How did you know?\" She quizzed. \"Don't take a genius does it?\" How awfully vague. \"Look up ahead kid. That's my house.\" In line with where Henry pointed and buried beneath rows of corn, with a half-caved roof was indeed, a quaint little house. A cottage really, if Hades was to be pedantic. It had faint walls, stripped and deprived of any colour thanks to the iron regime of the molten heat and a little weather vane stationary and much too heavy for what little breeze there was outside. Once inside, Hades found the outside had little reflection on the interior - the walls painted in a multitude of colours ranging from green and blue to yellow; the carpets thick and full, and the atmosphere warm but in a kindly way that was barren and devoid in the heat outside. \"Henry?\" the voice was squeaked and nasally in that way only a southern American accent could achieve. When the voice emerged it came from a woman - small and hunched with tightly permed dark locks and dressed in bright pink loose garments. \"We've got a guest. Said she's called Hades - three guesses as to what her wife's called?\" \"Henry!\" the woman reprimanded as she walked closer. She held out a hand, \"You can call me Lisa dear. What can we do for?\" \"I - I came to - to err\" Hades coughed, the shock and novelty wearing off of the petite woman's hand outstretched before her nose, \"I came to find a way to help my wife\" \"What's wrong with her dear?\" She wasn't sure what to say. The dealings of the God's were not the concern of mortals. But, Hades thought, there was no one else. What good were the dealings of the God's staying separate from those of mortals when there were a lack of God's to have said dealings? \"I don't know\" she whispered rubbing her palm, \"she turned to dust\". \"Dust?\" Henry cut in, \"How can a -\" he sighed between words, \"- a god, of all things, turn to dust?\" She hesitantly sat down on the loved blue sofa, opposite from where Henry and Lisa sat - slouched and leaned forward respectively. \"There are...not many things that can fell one of our calibre. Many have tried, and all have failed - from Kronus, to Death, to even one another. But one thing that we are all mortal to: is belief.\" \"Belief?\" \"It is the one thing that holds us together - it was belief that created us, and belief that shall end us. It is the rising waves, the oppressive heat, the dawn of a new day and the dusk of another. It will outlive us all - including immortals.\" \"So belief? That's what's wrong with your wife - err Persephone?\" \"The days of the Hellenic are long gone\" Hades shrugged, \"too few know and invoke her name. She has been...replaced by others.\" \"Yeah - there's a reason it's mythology\" Henry scoffed. Lisa swatted her hand at his chest and glared. \"Fine. If you're really Hades then lass, then how - how are you not, what was it? Dust?\" \"Whilst we are all privy to the ebb and flow of belief, there are - things that cannot die. Time, death, war - all are forever. We are the past, present and we will be the future. There is something - wrong, with this world. Mortals have begun to play our role, to play God. They control weather - springtime is no longer present; crops fail to harvest; the stars lack their shine and bright glow. Love is seen as a burden; this world is built on the ideals of success being the only thing worthwhile. When I talk about belief, on one hand, I do indeed mean, the worship invoked in our names - the candles lit for our sakes. But, a name forgotten is quickly traded for another. Our domains? What we control? That is where the belief needs to be centred. If there is no belief in love - where does that go? Love must disappear.\" Silence knelt its presence in their conversation, all that could be heard was the slow battering of dust against the panels of the house. \"So, let me get this straight dear,\" Lisa began, her eyes darting slighting towards her husband but a smile in the direction of Hades, \"It's not the belief in - in your wife, Persephone that is - that presumably killed her is it? It's the belief in - what is she the Goddess of again dear?\" \"err springtime?\" Henry questioned in response. \"Yes. It's that the belief in springtime is gone?\" \"In a way\" Hades sighed, \"It's - springtime is deemed a fact of this world. It cannot be believed in or against, it just is. It's that springtime has seized to exist in a way,\" she rubbed her palm, \"Humans, they - I don't, don't know the term for it - global warming I think? They have done something, none the less, and - springtime, autumn - fall whatever you call it, it is no more.\" \"Global warming - killed a Goddess?\" Henry stated incredulously. \"Global warming, killed springtime and with it - \" Hades retorted, \"my wife. Yes.\" Silence had now begun to stand, looming over the group and pulling itself up by grasping on their tongues. Lisa coughed, quickly biting the hand that restricted her and forcing the silence to retreat. \"Would you - would anyone like any tea?\". Hades smiled up at her and nodded, \"Please\" \"Right we go then dear, I'll be right back\" She said, smiling back with cracked lips tinted a pale crimson. \"So what was your grand plan then lass?\" Henry questioned, \"You said you'd come to save your wife. How you gonna do that? Fight fist the God of Global warming?\" \"There is no God of Global warming\" \"No -\" Henry said in an odd voice that Hades couldn't discern, \"Just one of Death\" Hades frowned, not in response to his statement but rather to his question. \"I don't know in all honesty. I - I thought maybe I'd go around, try to reinforce belief, rally whatever of us there are left together for one cause.\" \"So you're becoming an environmental activist?\" Henry drawled. \"What's this?\" Lisa cut in, precariously balancing a tray of overflowing mugs - milky tea tracing the sides as she shuffled slowly forward. Hades stood up to help but was quickly shot down with mutterings of \"No no no dear - you just stay there.\" \"Hades here wants to become an environmental activist\" \"That's not what I said\" Hades frowned, \"I want to rally the troops so to speak, inspire belief- see who's left. Thought I'd take a car and drive, it can't be that difficult can it?\" \"What rallying the troops?\" \"No. Driving\" \"Your whole plan resides on you driving around and you don't even know how?\" Henry questioned incredulously \"Well then, isn't it lucky you do dear\" Lisa stated, with a pointed smile towards Henry. They participated in a staring match for what seemed like hours, neither folding nor laying their cards down on the rickety table in front. \"Guess it's a good thing you got a taxi driver then kid,\" Henry drawled bitterly, running a thumb around the rim of his mug, \"where's the first stop?\" Hades brought her own cracked mug to her honey-stained lips and took a sip, tasting the bitter tea swirling with thick milk. She didn't know who was alive, still around even. But she was death, riches, the underworld - if she was still around, what were the chances he would be? They had to go to the most vile, black-hearted place around; if he was to be anywhere - if he was even alive, it would be there. \"Vinton, Iowa\" The first thought Hades had when she saw Henry stutter the mangled car from the worn garage was, \"this is how an immortal dies\". It was a pale blue, perhaps once a rich cobalt now whitened with sun damage and scabbed at every nook and cranny. It groaned a pitiful noise when Henry drifted towards Hades - or at least attempted to. The car seemed to miss its mark by about 5 meters, leaving Hades to half jog towards the passenger door. \"I think this is older then I am\" she said, ducking her head hesitantly in the car to sit down. Henry snorted, \"Bessie's perfectly well and fit, don't be a wimp lass\". Hades turned to him, looking sceptical. \"She looks like she'd fall apart going below the speed limit\" Henry glared at her in response and was quick to remind her just who it was who was driving her \"ass around\". Naturally with that reminder, she shut up and instead turned to the battered radio player and began fiddling with its knobs. Henry slapped her hand away. \"If you gonna be annoying, you can get out right now\" \"So you want to sit in silence with nothing but my company for hours?\" Henry seemed to think better on this and whilst still glaring at her lifted his own hand to the radio, turning to the first station that didn't bellow out an ear-splitting crackle. As they drove through the fields of wheat and grass, Hades mind was stuck on Persephone. She knew she was doing the right thing but in all honesty, she had no idea if it would work or not. She - she just didn't know. What if she failed? What if - Her thoughts were disturbed by Henry turning down the radio to a silent whisper and asking, \"So why Iowa of all places?\" \"If I truly want to rally the troops so to speak, I need a leader. I'm all well and good but - I'm not exactly known for my social skills, so to speak that is\" \"Can't see why\" Henry cut in, his tone sarcastic and as dry as the river of heat embracing the car. Hades glared at him, she may not have much interaction with mortals - that was more Thanatos' realm, but she occasionally still knew sarcasm when it hit her. \"Yes well, the fact stands, I'm not the best person for this job.\" \"So who is?\" \"Who better to lead troops then the God of war. I want Ares.\" \"Ares. You think you're gonna find Ares, the God of war of all things, in an unremarkable little town in Iowa\" \"It is more often than not, the unremarkable that is the remarkable. You just have to remember to look. You can find the most brutal anger in the plainest of people, the most embracing love in the ordinary. The extraordinary are only that because that is all they have. The ordinary? The unremarkable as you say? In my experience, they have always been the jack of all trades, skilled in a multitude of ways that extraordinary simply cannot comprehend.\" \"Some would say the Gods, if they were real that is, were extraordinary. How you feel about that?\" \"Immortals are not without their flaws\" Hades scoffed, \"my brother Zeus is cruel. Does horrible things to those around him; Poseidon with a temper that can fell cities to their knees - myself even, an apathy at times that scares even my wife. No one is exempt - even the Gods.\" Silence once again made itself know - how kind of their old friend Hades thought. Henry coughed, apparently unsure of what to say. \"Neat\". Hades snorted, an ugly coughing escaped Henry is response. \"Is that what your laugh sounds like?\" Her eyes widened, and her hand shot up towards her mouth as her cheeks blushed a deep crimson. \"Shut up\" Henry laughed, his own laugh a loud, racketing bellow that came deep from within. \"No no no, I didn't mean it like that lass. It's perfectly fine. It's just you don't tend to think of the so-called deity of death laughing\" \"I mean technically, Thanatos is the God of death - I'm just - I just have the underworld.\" Hades stuttered out \"Oh and - and money\" Henry's laugh continued as the landscape blurred past them - yellow turning green with pine, the road now a grey tarmac rather than dusty paths. When they finally reached Iowa, they were greeted by a titled sign and clear skies - silence befell them. \"What are you doing?\" Hades asked as Henry indicated to turn into a half-empty car park lined with blocked, grey scale buildings. \"You can't go out or around like that lass\" \"Like what?\" \"Like you been holed up all your life in a tower with your grandmother as your only company\" Henry scoffed. \"I like these clothes\" Hades said, running her hand down the bottom of her dress, feeling the scruff of the blue linen on her hand. \"And you'll find more clothes you like\" \"You don't have to do this\" she said as he chugged the car to a stop after taking what she could only assume was five hours to park. \"Oh I'm not doing this for you lass,\" Henry laughed before putting on a mimicry of a higher pitched voice, \"I refuse to be seen in public with you looking like that\" \"I don't - I don't understand\" He sighed getting out of the car, \"Doesn't matter anyway lass. Come on - any thoughts on what you'd like?\" \"Clothes\" she dragged out, still largely unsure as to what exactly was happening. \"Oh fucking hell - no shit sherlock\" Henry replied, more to himself then to her. \"Who is sherlock? Do we need him? Can he help?\" As they walked into the store, limonium flooring slapped underneath her heels and reflected the clinical bright lights. \"Go nuts kid, I'll out here if you wanna show off your outfits\" \"What do I pick?\" \"Whatever you think is neat\" Naturally, this was a horrible idea. The first look Hades picked was an attack of colour - a pastel ankle length skirt paired with a purple flower blouse and black Velcro trainers. She thought it looked great; the first out of Henry's mouth however was a harsh, \"No\". The next outfit was potentially a bit blander, she thought. A blue strappy shirt with flared trousers and a dull green cloak. One again however, she was rejected with a quick \"no\" and an incredulous \"How did you even find that?!\". Finally, disheartened and frustrated with the constant rejections, she decided to simply copy what she did last time she was on this plane and mimick others. The girl to her left was wearing an oversized beige jacket, a jumper and what appeared to be rolled up trousers accompanied with boots. That would do nicely, Hades thought. As she slowly drew back the changing room curtain once again, she carefully watched Henry's features and was relieved to be met with an, admittedly, disinterested thumbs up. Once they left it was back on the road to Vinton, Iowa. Well no, first they stopped at the drive through starbucks but then - it was back on the road to Vinton, Iowa. As Henry parked the car in a barren car park, Hades watched the town - the people who turned their heads towards the car and greeted them with stares cased in fire and masked with southern hospitality. \"Quaint\" Henry mummered under his breath, \"So where exactly do we find the God of war?\" Hades frowned, sniffing the air as they stepped out of the car before pointing due east. \"That way\". \"You sure?\" She glared back at Henry who like a solider on a battlefield, held up his hands in surrender. As they walked towards their destination, Hades found herself remiss in the fact there was no dirt to kick up. The tarmac coated in a thin layer of dirty water instead and she found herself in response watching the puddles cling to Henry's shoe like a dribble of spit as he walked in front of her. \"Turn left\" Hades said to Henry who was a few steps ahead of her and they soon found themselves face to face with a suburban estate, doors and walls the same colour - the same lawn repeated again and again. \"The God of war is in a suburban estate?\" Henry dragged out. \"They have a lot of pent of anger\" Hades responded. As they walked to a nondescript doorstep, Hades peaked inside the window and noted how the regimented white yellowed into sepia tones - giving way to the apparent secrets hidden behind a pure facade. She slowly pressed a hand towards the door and with a creek it opened, revealing blood stained wall paper pealing at the edges and an isolated sofa chair with its back to the door illuminated by only a faint glow of the tv screen in front. \"Ares\" Hades began \"Been awhile\" the figure replied, smoke misting from the corners of his lips and drenching the room in thick tobacco. Hades hummed in response, it had been a while she supposed but in regards to the life span of an immortal? \"Only a century or so\" she mollified, her tone gentle yet hesitant in nature. In the dim light, she could see Ares draw in another breath of smoke and exhale slowly - his brown hair, once the rival of Adonis now drooping and low, cutting into his cheekbones as he did so. \"I remember,\" he responded scornfully, \"in any place there is enough war, there is death walking alongside him\" Henry, who had been silent until now chose this moment to speak up - \"I thought you were saying you two were friendly?\" Hades opened her mouth to respond but Ares quickly beat her to the punch, \"War and death are always friendly -\" he tilted his head as if in contemplation before quickly huffing out a laugh, \"as are riches and war. Always have been. Always will be.\" Hades took a step forward, her boot crunching over the rotted floorboards below. \"We need your help\" she sighed, cutting straight to the point. \"Help?\" Ares huffed, \"the fuck you want me for?\" \"Look at the place Ares\", she snorted, making a move to turn on the light and in doing so, allowing it to become apparent to the trio just how desolate the place was. As she slowly ran her fingers over the coarse fabric of his chair she whispered, \"What is war without love? What's the point?\", until she was squatting, face to face against Ares. \"We can help you. We can bring her back.\" \"Yeah? Why should I believe you? After last time and what happened?\" he huffed before continuing, \"I never got that weapon back\" \"Because Persephone is gone\". It was the first time she'd ever said it aloud. Aloud and with clarity. Amidst the fire and smoke wrapping itself around her throat, a deep chill made itself known in her bones, tracing the insides of skin and curling along her veins. \"Really gone huh?\" Hades nodded, rubbing her palms on her knees and revelling in the sweat that dampened them. She had never sweat before, and she thought absentmindedly 'what did that mean for her?' \"You got a plan?\" She smirked, meeting his gunpowder dark eyes, \"Don't I always?\"",

      "When the voice emerged it came from a woman - small and hunched with tightly permed dark locks and dressed in bright pink loose garments.",
      "\"We've got a guest.",
      "Said she's called Hades - three guesses as to what her wife's called?\" \"Henry!\"",
      "the woman reprimanded as she walked closer.",
      "She held out a hand, \"You can call me Lisa dear.",
      "What can we do for?\"",
      "\"I - I came to - to err\" Hades coughed, the shock and novelty wearing off of the petite woman's hand outstretched before her nose, \"I came to find a way to help my wife\" \"What's wrong with her dear?\"",
      "She wasn't sure what to say.",
      "The dealings of the God's were not the concern of mortals.",
      "But, Hades thought, there was no one else.",
      "What good were the dealings of the God's staying separate from those of mortals when there were a lack of God's to have said dealings?",
      "\"I don't know\" she whispered rubbing her palm, \"she turned to dust\".",
      "\"Dust?\"",
      "Henry cut in, \"How can a -\" he sighed between words, \"- a god, of all things, turn to dust?\"",
      "She hesitantly sat down on the loved blue sofa, opposite from where Henry and Lisa sat - slouched and leaned forward respectively.",
      "\"There are...not many things that can fell one of our calibre.",
      "Many have tried, and all have failed - from Kronus, to Death, to even one another.",
      "But one thing that we are all mortal to: is belief.\"",
      "\"Belief?\"",
      "\"It is the one thing that holds us together - it was belief that created us, and belief that shall end us.",
      "It is the rising waves, the oppressive heat, the dawn of a new day and the dusk of another.",
      "It will outlive us all - including immortals.\"",
      "\"So belief?",
      "That's what's wrong with your wife - err Persephone?\"",
      "\"The days of the Hellenic are long gone\" Hades shrugged, \"too few know and invoke her name.",
      "She has been...replaced by others.\"",
      "\"Yeah - there's a reason it's mythology\" Henry scoffed.",
      "Lisa swatted her hand at his chest and glared.",
      "\"Fine.",
      "If you're really Hades then lass, then how - how are you not, what was it?",
      "Dust?\"",
      "\"Whilst we are all privy to the ebb and flow of belief, there are - things that cannot die.",
      "Time, death, war - all are forever.",
      "We are the past, present and we will be the future.",
      "There is something - wrong, with this world.",
      "Mortals have begun to play our role, to play God.",
      "They control weather - springtime is no longer present; crops fail to harvest; the stars lack their shine and bright glow.",
      "Love is seen as a burden; this world is built on the ideals of success being the only thing worthwhile.",
      "When I talk about belief, on one hand, I do indeed mean, the worship invoked in our names - the candles lit for our sakes.",
      "But, a name forgotten is quickly traded for another.",
      "Our domains?",
      "What we control?",
      "That is where the belief needs to be centred.",
      "If there is no belief in love - where does that go?",
      "Love must disappear.\"",
      "Silence knelt its presence in their conversation, all that could be heard was the slow battering of dust against the panels of the house.",
      "\"So, let me get this straight dear,\" Lisa began, her eyes darting slighting towards her husband but a smile in the direction of Hades, \"It's not the belief in - in your wife, Persephone that is - that presumably killed her is it?",
      "It's the belief in - what is she the Goddess of again dear?\"",
      "\"err springtime?\"",
      "Henry questioned in response.",
      "\"Yes.",
      "It's that the belief in springtime is gone?\"",
      "\"In a way\" Hades sighed, \"It's - springtime is deemed a fact of this world.",
      "It cannot be believed in or against, it just is.",
      "It's that springtime has seized to exist in a way,\" she rubbed her palm, \"Humans, they - I don't, don't know the term for it - global warming I think?",
      "They have done something, none the less, and - springtime, autumn - fall whatever you call it, it is no more.\"",
      "\"Global warming - killed a Goddess?\"",
      "Henry stated incredulously.",
      "\"Global warming, killed springtime and with it - \" Hades retorted, \"my wife.",
      "Yes.\"",
      "Silence had now begun to stand, looming over the group and pulling itself up by grasping on their tongues.",
      "Lisa coughed, quickly biting the hand that restricted her and forcing the silence to retreat.",
      "\"Would you - would anyone like any tea?\".",
      "Hades smiled up at her and nodded, \"Please\" \"Right we go then dear, I'll be right back\" She said, smiling back with cracked lips tinted a pale crimson.",
      "\"So what was your grand plan then lass?\"",
      "Henry questioned, \"You said you'd come to save your wife.",
      "How you gonna do that?",
      "Fight fist the God of Global warming?\"",
      "\"There is no God of Global warming\" \"No -\" Henry said in an odd voice that Hades couldn't discern, \"Just one of Death\" Hades frowned, not in response to his statement but rather to his question.",
      "\"I don't know in all honesty.",
      "I - I thought maybe I'd go around, try to reinforce belief, rally whatever of us there are left together for one cause.\"",
      "\"So you're becoming an environmental activist?\" Henry drawled.",
      "\"What's this?\"",
      "Lisa cut in, precariously balancing a tray of overflowing mugs - milky tea tracing the sides as she shuffled slowly forward.",
      "Hades stood up to help but was quickly shot down with mutterings of \"No no no dear - you just stay there.\"",
      "\"Hades here wants to become an environmental activist\" \"That's not what I said\" Hades frowned, \"I want to rally the troops so to speak, inspire belief- see who's left.",
      "Thought I'd take a car and drive, it can't be that difficult can it?\"",
      "\"What rallying the troops?\" \"No. Driving\" \"Your whole plan resides on you driving around and you don't even know how?\"",
      "Henry questioned incredulously \"Well then, isn't it lucky you do dear\" Lisa stated, with a pointed smile towards Henry.",
      "They participated in a staring match for what seemed like hours, neither folding nor laying their cards down on the rickety table in front.",
      "\"Guess it's a good thing you got a taxi driver then kid,\" Henry drawled bitterly, running a thumb around the rim of his mug, \"where's the first stop?\"",
      "Hades brought her own cracked mug to her honey-stained lips and took a sip, tasting the bitter tea swirling with thick milk.",
      "She didn't know who was alive, still around even.",
      "But she was death, riches, the underworld - if she was still around, what were the chances he would be?",
      "They had to go to the most vile, black-hearted place around; if he was to be anywhere - if he was even alive, it would be there.",
      "\"Vinton, Iowa\" The first thought Hades had when she saw Henry stutter the mangled car from the worn garage was, \"this is how an immortal dies\".",
      "It was a pale blue, perhaps once a rich cobalt now whitened with sun damage and scabbed at every nook and cranny.",
      "It groaned a pitiful noise when Henry drifted towards Hades - or at least attempted to.",
      "The car seemed to miss its mark by about 5 meters, leaving Hades to half jog towards the passenger door.",
      "\"I think this is older then I am\" she said, ducking her head hesitantly in the car to sit down.",
      "Henry snorted, \"Bessie's perfectly well and fit, don't be a wimp lass\".",
      "Hades turned to him, looking sceptical.",
      "\"She looks like she'd fall apart going below the speed limit\" Henry glared at her in response and was quick to remind her just who it was who was driving her \"ass around\".",
      "Naturally with that reminder, she shut up and instead turned to the battered radio player and began fiddling with its knobs.",
      "Henry slapped her hand away.",
      "\"If you gonna be annoying, you can get out right now\" \"So you want to sit in silence with nothing but my company for hours?\"",
      "Henry seemed to think better on this and whilst still glaring at her lifted his own hand to the radio, turning to the first station that didn't bellow out an ear-splitting crackle.",
      "As they drove through the fields of wheat and grass, Hades mind was stuck on Persephone.",
      "She knew she was doing the right thing but in all honesty, she had no idea if it would work or not.",
      "She - she just didn't know.",
      "What if she failed?",
      "What if - Her thoughts were disturbed by Henry turning down the radio to a silent whisper and asking, \"So why Iowa of all places?\"",
      "\"If I truly want to rally the troops so to speak, I need a leader.",
      "I'm all well and good but - I'm not exactly known for my social skills, so to speak that is\" \"Can't see why\" Henry cut in, his tone sarcastic and as dry as the river of heat embracing the car.",
      "Hades glared at him, she may not have much interaction with mortals - that was more Thanatos' realm, but she occasionally still knew sarcasm when it hit her.",
      "\"Yes well, the fact stands, I'm not the best person for this job.\"",
      "\"So who is?\"",
      "\"Who better to lead troops then the God of war.",
      "I want Ares.\"",
      "\"Ares.",
      "You think you're gonna find Ares, the God of war of all things, in an unremarkable little town in Iowa\" \"It is more often than not, the unremarkable that is the remarkable.",
      "You just have to remember to look.",
      "You can find the most brutal anger in the plainest of people, the most embracing love in the ordinary.",
      "The extraordinary are only that because that is all they have.",
      "The ordinary?",
      "The unremarkable as you say?",
      "In my experience, they have always been the jack of all trades, skilled in a multitude of ways that extraordinary simply cannot comprehend.\"",
      "\"Some would say the Gods, if they were real that is, were extraordinary.",
      "How you feel about that?\"",
      "\"Immortals are not without their flaws\" Hades scoffed, \"my brother Zeus is cruel.",
      "Does horrible things to those around him; Poseidon with a temper that can fell cities to their knees - myself even, an apathy at times that scares even my wife.",
      "No one is exempt - even the Gods.\"",
      "Silence once again made itself know - how kind of their old friend Hades thought.",
      "Henry coughed, apparently unsure of what to say.",
      "\"Neat\".",
      "Hades snorted, an ugly coughing escaped Henry is response.",
      "\"Is that what your laugh sounds like?\" Her eyes widened, and her hand shot up towards her mouth as her cheeks blushed a deep crimson.",
      "\"Shut up\" Henry laughed, his own laugh a loud, racketing bellow that came deep from within.",
      "\"No no no, I didn't mean it like that lass.",
      "It's perfectly fine.",
      "It's just you don't tend to think of the so-called deity of death laughing\" \"I mean technically, Thanatos is the God of death - I'm just - I just have the underworld.\"",
      "Hades stuttered out \"Oh and - and money\" Henry's laugh continued as the landscape blurred past them - yellow turning green with pine, the road now a grey tarmac rather than dusty paths.",
      "When they finally reached Iowa, they were greeted by a titled sign and clear skies - silence befell them.",
      "\"What are you doing?\" Hades asked as Henry indicated to turn into a half-empty car park lined with blocked, grey scale buildings.",
      "\"You can't go out or around like that lass\" \"Like what?\"",
      "\"Like you been holed up all your life in a tower with your grandmother as your only company\" Henry scoffed.",
      "\"I like these clothes\" Hades said, running her hand down the bottom of her dress, feeling the scruff of the blue linen on her hand.",
      "\"And you'll find more clothes you like\" \"You don't have to do this\" she said as he chugged the car to a stop after taking what she could only assume was five hours to park.",
      "\"Oh I'm not doing this for you lass,\" Henry laughed before putting on a mimicry of a higher pitched voice, \"I refuse to be seen in public with you looking like that\" \"I don't - I don't understand\" He sighed getting out of the car, \"Doesn't matter anyway lass.",
      "Come on - any thoughts on what you'd like?\"",
      "\"Clothes\" she dragged out, still largely unsure as to what exactly was happening.",
      "\"Oh fucking hell - no shit sherlock\" Henry replied, more to himself then to her.",
      "\"Who is sherlock?",
      "Do we need him?",
      "Can he help?\"",
      "As they walked into the store, limonium flooring slapped underneath her heels and reflected the clinical bright lights.",
      "\"Go nuts kid, I'll out here if you wanna show off your outfits\" \"What do I pick?\"",
      "\"Whatever you think is neat\" Naturally, this was a horrible idea.",
      "The first look Hades picked was an attack of colour - a pastel ankle length skirt paired with a purple flower blouse and black Velcro trainers.",
      "She thought it looked great; the first out of Henry's mouth however was a harsh, \"No\".",
      "The next outfit was potentially a bit blander, she thought.",
      "A blue strappy shirt with flared trousers and a dull green cloak.",
      "One again however, she was rejected with a quick \"no\" and an incredulous \"How did you even find that?!\".",
      "Finally, disheartened and frustrated with the constant rejections, she decided to simply copy what she did last time she was on this plane and mimick others.",
      "The girl to her left was wearing an oversized beige jacket, a jumper and what appeared to be rolled up trousers accompanied with boots.",
      "That would do nicely, Hades thought.",
      "As she slowly drew back the changing room curtain once again, she carefully watched Henry's features and was relieved to be met with an, admittedly, disinterested thumbs up.",
      "Once they left it was back on the road to Vinton, Iowa.",
      "Well no, first they stopped at the drive through starbucks but then - it was back on the road to Vinton, Iowa.",
      "As Henry parked the car in a barren car park, Hades watched the town - the people who turned their heads towards the car and greeted them with stares cased in fire and masked with southern hospitality.",
      "\"Quaint\" Henry mummered under his breath, \"So where exactly do we find the God of war?\" Hades frowned, sniffing the air as they stepped out of the car before pointing due east.",
      "\"That way\".",
      "\"You sure?\"",
      "She glared back at Henry who like a solider on a battlefield, held up his hands in surrender.",
      "As they walked towards their destination, Hades found herself remiss in the fact there was no dirt to kick up.",
      "The tarmac coated in a thin layer of dirty water instead and she found herself in response watching the puddles cling to Henry's shoe like a dribble of spit as he walked in front of her.",
      "\"Turn left\" Hades said to Henry who was a few steps ahead of her and they soon found themselves face to face with a suburban estate, doors and walls the same colour - the same lawn repeated again and again.",
      "\"The God of war is in a suburban estate?\"",
      "Henry dragged out.",
      "\"They have a lot of pent of anger\" Hades responded.",
      "As they walked to a nondescript doorstep, Hades peaked inside the window and noted how the regimented white yellowed into sepia tones - giving way to the apparent secrets hidden behind a pure facade.",
      "She slowly pressed a hand towards the door and with a creek it opened, revealing blood stained wall paper pealing at the edges and an isolated sofa chair with its back to the door illuminated by only a faint glow of the tv screen in front.",
      "\"Ares\" Hades began \"Been awhile\" the figure replied, smoke misting from the corners of his lips and drenching the room in thick tobacco.",
      "Hades hummed in response, it had been a while she supposed but in regards to the life span of an immortal?",
      "\"Only a century or so\" she mollified, her tone gentle yet hesitant in nature.",
      "In the dim light, she could see Ares draw in another breath of smoke and exhale slowly - his brown hair, once the rival of Adonis now drooping and low, cutting into his cheekbones as he did so.",
      "\"I remember,\" he responded scornfully, \"in any place there is enough war, there is death walking alongside him\" Henry, who had been silent until now chose this moment to speak up - \"I thought you were saying you two were friendly?\" Hades opened her mouth to respond but Ares quickly beat her to the punch, \"War and death are always friendly -\" he tilted his head as if in contemplation before quickly huffing out a laugh, \"as are riches and war.",
      "Always have been.",
      "Always will be.\"",
      "Hades took a step forward, her boot crunching over the rotted floorboards below.",
      "\"We need your help\" she sighed, cutting straight to the point.",
      "\"Help?\" Ares huffed, \"the fuck you want me for?\"",
      "\"Look at the place Ares\", she snorted, making a move to turn on the light and in doing so, allowing it to become apparent to the trio just how desolate the place was.",
      "As she slowly ran her fingers over the coarse fabric of his chair she whispered, \"What is war without love?",
      "What's the point?\", until she was squatting, face to face against Ares.",
      "\"We can help you.",
      "We can bring her back.\"",
      "\"Yeah?",
      "Why should I believe you?",
      "After last time and what happened?\" he huffed before continuing, \"I never got that weapon back\" \"Because Persephone is gone\".",
      "It was the first time she'd ever said it aloud.",
      "Aloud and with clarity.",
      "Amidst the fire and smoke wrapping itself around her throat, a deep chill made itself known in her bones, tracing the insides of skin and curling along her veins.",
      "\"Really gone huh?\" Hades nodded, rubbing her palms on her knees and revelling in the sweat that dampened them.",
      "She had never sweat before, and she thought absentmindedly 'what did that mean for her?' \"You got a plan?\"",
      "She smirked, meeting his gunpowder dark eyes, \"Don't I always?\""

    "text": "Persephone was a botanist, not a maiden. She had been conducting research in that meadow. Everyone knew who Ada was. In that cold castle, she was in charge. Every coming and going was authorized by her. She ruled her realm by birthright, or at least by the vicissitudes of family politics, not with an iron fist but with compassion. Her charges were stuck here, and her task was to care for them with a gentle hand. She dedicated herself to this task. Light radiated from her eyes alone, and with it, comfort. When Ada came to recruit her, she knew why. There was a garden there, or at least there used to be: yew, cypress, juniper. Gnarled stumps stuck jaggedly out of the dark grey earth. She was to be its cultivator. She used to cry herself to sleep at night. At first glance, the place seemed designed to inhibit growth, to frustrate her efforts. But over time she learned that nothing could be further from the truth. This cavernous dusty castle was in fact a nurturing ground, mobilizing the staidest of traditions in service of upholding memory. It was, paradoxically, full of life. Things began to grow again: at first wispy grey things, and then, as she watched in wonder, things with an abundance of thick, dark, shining leaves. Beautiful things, like hope. She grew to love the quiet stone corridors, the chill darkness, the ghosts of knowledge that inhabited these stone walls. Seated at her right hand, she grew to love Ada herself. They reigned together as darkness and light, balance in microcosm. Every now and then, she returned to the field and the meadows, to collect specimens that refused to grow in the hardened soil of the castle grounds. When she was gone, winter settled over the castle. Ada always picked her up. Day 30 of the Winter Fluff Event: Carriage Ride. By now it was a ritual she looked forward to. The first time had been frightening. Ada had picked her up personally, from her home, in a black carriage. They rolled silently along, and she found herself desperate to look back. Desperate, but unable, and very, very lonely. She had been unsure what to expect, leaving behind her home and her ecosystem, her vibrant outdoor laboratory, for the dark, barren castle. At Cackle's there would be seagrasses and dried herbs, to use in any potion or elixir her powers could concoct, but there would be no fresh flowers, no unknown species, no wilderness. And no contact with the outside world. But that didn't bother her. There was no one left for her to miss. And so the first time she asked to leave, Ada was perplexed: didn't Cackle's have everything she needed? Almost, and no. Ada agreed to let her go, and summer bloomed in her meadow. But Ada came for her again. There was work to do. It became their habit, their annual pattern. Every year, she would leave and return to her beloved wilderness. In time, Ada would roll up in her slick black carriage to fetch her. To whisk her back. Their relationship shifted on those long rides back. Out of the first awkward silences grew long discussions about learning, memory, tradition. They were both firm believers in tradition. Ada knew little about plants, but she observed enough to give a report on the gardens and grounds. It was comfortable, companionable. Intimate. She found that she had missed Ada.",

    "text": "Arachne was a proud weaver in her town. She often proclaimed that she was \"Better than Athena herself!\" when it came to weaving. One day in the marketplace, Athena, the goddess of wisdom and crafts herself, took the appearance of an old crone and heard Arachne's hubristic words. \"Be humble, as there are always those greater than yourself.\" She warned the young woman. But Arachne was too proud to see her faults. \"What is there to be humble about when I truly am the greatest weaver in the world? Get out of my sight, you hag, and take your impeding words to someone more foolish than I!\" She demanded haughtily. \"You should watch your words, Arachne,\" Athena chastised, transforming back into a goddess. \"You never know who might be listening!\" Arachne shrunk away slightly, then frowned as though annoyed at her own actions, and stood her ground. Athena arched an eyebrow at her actions, then continued to speak. \"Earlier you said that you were a greater weaver than even myself, the goddess of crafts. I would like to test that claim. We will each weave a tapestry that depicts the gods. Whoever's is best will be proclaimed the best weaver in the world.\" Arachne, in her arrogance, agreed to the goddess' challenge, and the test began. Athena wove a tapestry depicting the best of the gods. Their creations, conquests, and greatest achievements. Arachne's, however, depicted not the good of the gods, but their faults and flaws. innocents struck down by a clumsy hand, masterpieces ruined, and oaths broken. But that was not all. While Athena's tapestry looked gorgeous, beautiful beyond belief, it still looked like just that, a tapestry. Arachne's, however. Arachne's tapestry looked alive. The waters seemed to ripple in the light of endless sunbeams. Limbs seemed to move, faces held love, lust and horror so real it seemed as though some of them would scream any second, and and the goddesses and gods seemed to glow with horrible power, greed, and otherworldliness. The judge was in a horrible place by the time it came for her to chose one. On one hand, it was clear to her that Arachne's was the best, on the other, to say so was to evoke the wrath of the goddess of war. Which to choose, which to choose?! Athena, impatient with judges nervous back-and-forth stares at their artworks, snapped at the poor girl, \"I demand to know your choice! Who has won?\" In a moment of shock and fear, she blurted out the truth; \"Arachne has!\" she instantly clapped a hand over her mouth afterward as her face turned an ashen gray. Athena, furious that she had been not only been beaten, but bested in her own area of expertise, turned to the weaver, and in her anger turned Arachne into a huge spider. Since then, she has been known as the Mother of Spiders, and her tale is told as a warning against hubris to all people throughout the world.",

The sound of the waves beating at the shore steadied my heart during Telegonus' wretched days. I was never meant for Helios' dim, suffocating halls. Grass beneath my feet, rocks chipping away at my sturdy skin. My home was never cold, my skin never chilled. Her smile was testimony that my place was on Aiaia. Penelope's skin was not divine; worry lines etched her smooth face. Her eyes sat nicely in her face, and in a way they reminded me of him, but they were hers, undeniably. I would lie with her amongst the sheets of my golden bed, stroking her hair back from her face. The weight of her years, infantile compared to mine, were washed away by Death's Brother. She was beautiful and would have a place amongst us nymphs, if not for how sharp she was. Penelope was the best of mortal women, and would be the best out of all the women I knew: Madea, my sister, and perhaps the only one who could compete was Adriane. I did not lie with her as I did Penelope. My heart, however slow beating it was, sped when we met, lips chapped and melded to one another. I could see how he fell for her. Her wit was unparalleled; the arch of her neck bent delicately, hands firm where she gripped me. She was a woman who knew herself, confident in what she wanted as she emerged from the veil of mourning, less time bent at the loom, more time with my herbs and I.",

    "text": "There is no softness left inside of him. All of the parts love had smoothed, rubbed over with sandpaper to make him worthy of love, have been wrapped in barbs. Now that Patroclus is gone, Achilles has hardened. He doesn't put his armor on- nobody can do it right, nobody but Patroclus. Nobody dares question his decisions- who are they to challenge a God? A God on Earth, brought down to burn everything he touched. He is naive, was naive, but no longer. He steps out onto the battlefield with nothing but a sword in hand, and he feels made of stone. He mows through squadrons of men, not caring if his feet squelch in his sandals from the blood. He could win this war alone, but for what? For what does the sun rise now that all of the light is gone from the earth? For a woman? A princess? She is nothing, a speck of dust, a dying star in a universe only built for the two of them- for Achilles and Patroclus, Patroclus and Achilles. His chest aches at the name, at the thought of being remembered alone. He lays awake all night and feels every ounce of blood in his body and how heavy it all is. For the first time in his life he knows true exhaustion. He steps onto the battlefield time and time again and his leaden body overtakes his brain, shutting it off as he advances ever forward, terrified of looking back. Who is he killing? Brothers, husbands, lovers- no one of importance. No one matters, not even him. The one right thing in this world has been slain, and the rest of the world has ceased to exist in any meaningful way. He collapses in his tent from the strain and yet he still cannot sleep, forced to simply lay motionless for a time and try not to hear the phantom snores that flood his consciousness and ring in time with his barely there heartbeat. When Achilles dies, his first emotion is relief. It is the first thing he has felt in... how long, again? No matter, it is of no consequence now. He will see his love once more, hold him in his arms, allow himself to be polished and smoothed over once more, allow him to dress his wounds and kiss each pad of his murderous fingertips. He will sweep him into his arms as Achilles screams, beating on his chest in anger, in passion, in grief, in joy at their reunification. He is dead, and in that moment he has never been happier When he steps into the Elysium fields, his heart constricts. There is nothing, no one. He stumbles to the ground, tears crowding his vision for the first time since he was but a boy. He is alone- alone for the first time in his life, save for the spectres of those he cut down in his haze of reddened mourning. All alone, save for the stalks of golden wheat and ceaseless cool sunlight. In that moment of solitude, he understands the choice he should have made- imagines Patroclus and him curled up by the hearth together, safe, and growing old together. Feeding each other figs and licking the excess juice off one another's fingers. It is a hero's end, to stew in regret and longing for eternity.",

      "Nobody dares question his decisions- who are they to challenge a God?",
      "A God on Earth, brought down to burn everything he touched.",
      "He is naive, was naive, but no longer.",
      "He steps out onto the battlefield with nothing but a sword in hand, and he feels made of stone.",
      "He mows through squadrons of men, not caring if his feet squelch in his sandals from the blood.",
      "He could win this war alone, but for what?",
      "For what does the sun rise now that all of the light is gone from the earth?",
      "For a woman?",
      "A princess?",
      "She is nothing, a speck of dust, a dying star in a universe only built for the two of them- for Achilles and Patroclus, Patroclus and Achilles.",
      "His chest aches at the name, at the thought of being remembered alone.",
      "He lays awake all night and feels every ounce of blood in his body and how heavy it all is.",
      "For the first time in his life he knows true exhaustion.",
      "He steps onto the battlefield time and time again and his leaden body overtakes his brain, shutting it off as he advances ever forward, terrified of looking back.",
      "Who is he killing?",
      "Brothers, husbands, lovers- no one of importance.",
      "No one matters, not even him.",
      "The one right thing in this world has been slain, and the rest of the world has ceased to exist in any meaningful way.",
      "He collapses in his tent from the strain and yet he still cannot sleep, forced to simply lay motionless for a time and try not to hear the phantom snores that flood his consciousness and ring in time with his barely there heartbeat.",
      "When Achilles dies, his first emotion is relief.",
      "It is the first thing he has felt in... how long, again?",
      "No matter, it is of no consequence now.",
      "He will see his love once more, hold him in his arms, allow himself to be polished and smoothed over once more, allow him to dress his wounds and kiss each pad of his murderous fingertips.",
      "He will sweep him into his arms as Achilles screams, beating on his chest in anger, in passion, in grief, in joy at their reunification.",
      "He is dead, and in that moment he has never been happier When he steps into the Elysium fields, his heart constricts.",
      "There is nothing, no one.",
      "He stumbles to the ground, tears crowding his vision for the first time since he was but a boy.",
      "He is alone- alone for the first time in his life, save for the spectres of those he cut down in his haze of reddened mourning.",
      "All alone, save for the stalks of golden wheat and ceaseless cool sunlight.",
      "In that moment of solitude, he understands the choice he should have made- imagines Patroclus and him curled up by the hearth together, safe, and growing old together.",
      "Feeding each other figs and licking the excess juice off one another's fingers.",
      "It is a hero's end, to stew in regret and longing for eternity."

    "text": "Any word is the right word. Any word is the right word. ANY word is the RIGHT word. This was a mantra that was drilled into the minds of every Elect. From the very beginning of their Arrival, that mantra was repeated day and night. It was a protection and a reminder that Prayers are always perfect, no matter who spoke them and how. Medina had gone through her daily prayers zealously. Three times a day, seven days a week, three hundred and sixty-five days a year. Always. And even though her prayers were more conversational than worshipful, she'd always felt connected to the Great Lady, perhaps even more connected because of it. Prayers, gifts, love; she gave her all to the Great Goddess who'd saved her time and time again. She sincerely hoped that her Goddess would intervene once more. \"Great Goddess,\" She whispered almost silently, peeking out through the tiny crack in the door. She could just barely hear the screams and the crackle of flames and the clattering of armour. \"Great Goddess, please hear my plea. We are your Elected, and they have come for us. Please. Please! Help us! Grant me some means of protecting my Brothers and Sisters and the people we have taken under our care!\" Silence except for the sounds of the massacre occurring outside her door. A soft whine left her throat as she pressed herself more closely to the stone wall adjacent to the door, one green eye peeking out through the space to watch as the flames got higher, hotter, and closer. \"My Lady,\" She whimpered. \"Please.\" Thin fingers dug gouges into the skin of her arms bared by the plain red dress all female Elect of the Great Goddess wore. Another high pained scream sounded making her flinch back against the cold stone. \"I heard you, my Elect,\" A warm voice murmured from beside her, causing her head to whip around to look at the speaker. There she stood, the Great Goddess. All around golden; hair, skin, amber eyes, clothes, armour. The only other color was the fresh blood red of her lips, the red matched by the clothes of her Elect. All beautiful and all powerful. She was an imposing figure; tall, clear-skinned, a soft golden glow. This was the Patroness. \"Great Mother,\" Medina whispered, shocked and thankful that she was here before her. A tear spilled down her cheek, opalescent sheen spilling down dark skin towards her chin. \"Shh,\" The Great Goddess soothed, a slightly calloused hand coming out to cup her cheek. \"I heard you, my Elect. I will grant you your wish.\" She crouched down before her, golden hair spilling down across her shoulders from the half-tail it was pulled into. \"I will be honest, it will not be pleasant, nor will it be the end. You will be the protector of my Elects. You will be my Champion.\" The golden glow brightened, moving like water down to Medina. Gold soon overtaking her until nothing but gold and red was visible. Like fire, like fire. Until nothing. Nothing... except the red spilled across the floor like the blood spilling outside this haven. The Great Goddess smiled, pleased by the outcome of this interference. Gone was the girl, and in place was the woman-warrior that was needed this night and in the future. The red began to move, one long sinuous body shifting. Medina groaned quietly, pressing her hands against the stone floor and shoving herself up to sit. She stretched before uprighting herself, stretching some more before turning her attention down to the changes made by her Patroness. Red, was the first thing she noticed. Red scales below her waist and up her arms. A heavier weight on her head. A weight on her back. Her dress changed for a shorter red shirt with a dark-coloured breastplate over it, engraved with the Goddess' items; Raven, bow, scroll. Gauntlets engraved the same up her forearms. A belt with a hip quiver next to her with a heavy carved blackwood bow sat next to it. \"Rise my Champion. Rise, my Queen. Rise, my Medusa. Protect your brethren.\" The Great Goddess held out a hand to her Champion, a bloodthirsty grin crossing both women's faces as the newly named Medusa clasped her forearm and rose onto her new appendage, the other hand clasping bow and quiver. \"Go. Protect.\" Medusa gave her Patroness another sharp-toothed grin, threw the door open and shot off into the flame and darkness outside. Fin.",

    "text": "\"You have disobeyed me for the last time!\" \"Don't do this! Please!\" \"Silence!\" \"She is no longer yours.\" \"No!\" \"Pandora...\" **** (Y/n) set up with a gasp, a cold sweat breaking out on her skin. She ran a hand down her face, catching her breath. This dream had been happening more and more frequently. She couldn't explain it. Neither could Sam or Dean. She was just thankful that they were out of town, hunting a vampire nest in Texas. She set in bed for a second, just taking in the silence of the room. This dream was almost too real. Sometimes, she actually thought she was there. She couldn't really see much; it was too blurry. The voices were clearly male though, this Pandora or whatever not having a say in what was going on. (Y/n) finally pulled herself out of bed and made her way to the bathroom. She was in desperate need of a shower before work. No one was going to give tips to a sweaty mess. The warm water rushed over her, waking her up and loosening the tight muscles. She didn't sleep great when Dean wasn't next to her, but here lately, she had been waking him up one too many times with the hyper realistic voices talking to her. She knew he didn't mind; he had been there too, waking her up with his visions of hell and such. But she just felt bad doing it to him all the same. He was too good for her, despite what he told her and even himself. \"Do I really have to go to work?\" (Y/n) asked herself as she got dressed. She didn't have a uniform like most traditional diners that they had been to, but she still had to have an apron and she still had to look presentable. So no Lynyrd Skynyrd t-shirts and blood stained jeans. She was the only one out of the three of them that still had a wholesome record. She just had a few little tickets here and there for speeding and such, but didn't everyone? Well, obviously not Sam and Dean, but that was a totally different story. She brushed her hair and teeth before heading out to work. She was going to be there all day, but the first half of the day was just taking inventory and ordering whatever was needed. Her boss trusted her more than he trusted his other employees and often left her to run it while he went out and about. Today was no different, but that's how she made the big bucks. Out of habit, (Y/n) quietly left the bunker, making sure the door didn't slam. No one else was home, but she was just so used to doing it. She hated to wake the boys up so early, even though Dean was usually up not even five seconds of her leaving. **** The day had flown by. Inventory had been quick, so (Y/n) got to go back home for a couple hours and get some things done around the bunker before heading back into work. She knew that was usually a mistake because she wouldn't want to leave, but Sam and Dean still weren't back yet. It was cold and quiet without them around to liven the place up, even when they weren't talking to each other. So she headed back to work, taking orders and ringing up meals. It wasn't a horribly busy night due to it being the middle of the week. But this weekend would be a lot busier, and as the head manager, she would have her work cut out for her. That is, if she had to work this weekend. Thankfully, she had requested a weekend off. She deserved it. Soon, the restaurant closed for the night and (Y/n) stayed behind to lock up the drawer and clean everything up. She was about to throw away what was left of the day's pie when she heard an all too familiar rumble pull up outside. She turned to look as Dean appeared in front of the door, knocking lightly. (Y/n) smiled and unlocked the door, letting Dean in. \"Why, hello there handsome.\" (Y/n) laughed. Dean just smiled and pulled her to him, kissing her deeply. \"Mmmmm Dean.\" \"I missed you.\" He said. \"I missed you too honey.\" (Y/n) said, taking his hand and leading him to a table to sit down. \"I'm taking it that the hunt went well?\" \"Sammy got a little banged up, but that hair protected him.\" Dean joked. (Y/n) took the pie and set it on the table in front of Dean with a fork. He looked up at her, a little confused. \"If you don't eat it, it's gonna be thrown away.\" (Y/n) explained. \"Well, we can't let that happen.\" Dean laughed. He took a bite and smiled. \"God (Y/n), you're the best.\" (Y/n) smiled. \"Well, I'm glad you think so babe.\" She kissed his cheek while he munched on his pie then went to fill any salt shakers that were low. \"I'm just glad that everything went okay for the two of you. But are Sam's injuries that need stitched up kind or the just an ice pack kind?\" \"Just an ice pack kind.\" Dean mumbled around a mouthful of pie. (Y/n) put the salt refill away and went over to him, wrapping her arms around him. Dean scooted back from the table and pulled (Y/n) into his lap and burying his nose into her neck. \"I probably should've called before I showed up, but I wanted to surprise you.\" \"But if you would've called, I could've been at home waiting in your favorite outfit.\" (Y/n) whispered into his ear, making the hunter shiver some. \"Maybe I should've called then.\" Dean said, placing kisses on (Y/n)'s neck. \"Could've told Sam to go to a motel for the night.\" (Y/n) blushed a little and was about to kiss Dean when the door opened and someone walked in. (Y/n) turned to look. \"Hey, we're closed.\" Dean commented. But the man did not seem to listen. \"Fainesai omorfi se afti ti zoi opos sto parelthon.\" The man said. \"You look as beautiful in this life as in the past.\" Dean moved (Y/n) off of his lap and stood up. The man didn't seem to be taking the hint. \"We have money. Just take it and go.\" (Y/n) said, a small hint of fear in her voice. Monsters she could handle. People? They were unpredictable. \"I do not want money.\" The man said, stalking closer to her and Dean. \"I just want you my darling Pandora.\" (Y/n) froze. Pandora? Was she in her dream again? Has she never woken up? \"There's no one named Pandora here,\" Dean grabbed the gun that he carried on him at all times. \"Now why don't you just get out of here before things get ugly?\" \"Really now?\" The man laughed, a smile on his face. \"You modern men and your guns. Flash a pistol and you bring the world to your feet. Personally, I think they are just overcompensating for something you're lacking.\" He cleared his throat. \"Now, I'm not leaving here without her. So just step aside.\" \"Over my dead body.\" Dean snapped back. The man pulled a knife out from an inside pocket in his jacket. \"That can be arranged.\" The man said, a little too gleeful. He looked past Dean towards (Y/n). \"You do blend in quite nicely this time around. Really immersing yourself in this time period.\" Dean stepped into his line of sight. \"Give her to me and I'll make your death fast and honorable.\" \"Not a chance.\" Dean growled. He aimed his gun and fired a couple shots. But the man just smiled and waved his hand, turning the bullets to dust in midair. \"Oh my god.\" (Y/n) gasped. \"What the hell are you?\" Dean asked. The man just raised his arm to throw the knife in Dean's direction. \"Hey!\" Another voice said. The man turned as Cas appeared behind him. \"I think you're done here.\" \"So is he.\" The man chucked the knife at Dean then, barely missing him as (Y/n) pushed him to the ground and Cas used his grace to stop it. \"Where did he go?\" Dean asked, sitting up and looking at (Y/n) to make sure she was okay. Cas looked around, not seeing the man anywhere. \"And it took you long enough to get here.\" \"I was busy.\" Cas grumbled. The knife clattered to the floor in front of (Y/n) and Dean. She crawled forward and picked it up, staring at it. Cas walked over to her as Dean stood up and offered his hand to her. \"I think we should get back to the bunker.\" Cas said, looking around. \"Are you okay?\" Dean asked, helping (Y/n) to her feet and taking the knife from her. \"Let's get out of here.\" (Y/n) said. \"I drove here though.\" \"Cas?\" Dean asked, looking at his friend. The angel nodded and held out his hand for (Y/n)'s keys. Dean wasn't about to let her out of his sight, not after everything. Dean helped (Y/n) lock up the restaurant and they headed out to Baby. (Y/n) just wasn't sure how to handle all of this. \"We'll figure this out.\" Dean assured her, driving back towards the bunker. (Y/n) nodded, but somewhere deep down, she wasn't so sure. \"Sam!\" Dean called out as they walked into the bunker. Sam was in the kitchen, fixing himself something to eat. \"Sammy!\" \"What?\" Sam asked, a yogurt cup in hand. He looked at (Y/n) and Dean. \"Oh come on, I don't wanna get kicked out for the night.\" (Y/n) had to laugh a bit, despite everything that was happening. \"No one is getting kicked out for the night.\" Dean explained. He laid the knife down on one of the tables and slid it towards Sam. Sam sat down his yogurt and picked up the knife. \"Uh, thanks?\" Sam said. \"This is exactly what I...wanted?\" \"Some guy just attacked us at the restaurant with this knife.\" Dean explained. He glanced over at (Y/n). \"He was after her.\" \"Wait, really?\" Sam asked, examining the knife. \"Let me go grab the knife index.\" Sam quickly headed towards the library. Dean turned his attention back to (Y/n). \"Are you okay?\" He asked her again. \"Yeah.\" She said. \"I'm just trying to catch up with everything.\" Dean nodded, understanding how that went. He pulled her close to his side and rubbed her back gently. Cas excused himself to the kitchen and returned with a glass of water for (Y/n). \"Thanks Cas.\" \"Here.\" Sam said, laying the heavy book on the table. \"Damn, we really need to make this all electronic.\" Dean said. \"Make it a lot easier to search.\" Sam didn't respond though. Once you got Sam in research mode, very little could pull him away from it. He looked at the markings on the blade and handle, defining features and anything that could help him figure out where this knife came from. \"I think I got it.\" Sam finally said after a few minutes of scanning. It was early in the file, which meant it had to be old. \"Looks like it's...ancient Greek?\" \"You're kidding.\" (Y/n) said. \"Like how ancient is ancient?\" Dean asked. \"It's hard to tell, but it's definitely this.\" Sam turned the file to show a picture that had been taken by a former Man of Letters. \"This was found back in the early 1900's in the Yucatan Peninsula.\" \"This is a lot.\" (Y/n) said, finally sitting down. She hadn't even realized she had been standing this whole time, waiting with baited breath to hear what Sam had to say. \"What exactly did he say to you two?\" Cas asked. \"I dunno. Some random Greek junk and how he wasn't leaving there without her.\" Dean explained. (Y/n) stared down at her hands. \"Fainesai omorfi se afti ti zoi opos sto parelthon.\" (Y/n) said in perfect Greek, making all three of the guys look at her. She looked up at them. \"I don't know how I could remember that.\" \"There's something going on here and I don't like it.\" Dean grumbled. He put a hand on her shoulder. \"But we're going to figure it out, okay?\" She nodded slowly. \"He thinks my name is Pandora.\" She said then, figuring that Cas and Sam needed all the details. \"Like Pandora's Box?\" Sam asked. \"No, this guy probably thinks she's an online radio provider.\" Dean smarted back. He turned his attention back to (Y/n). \"Had you seen him at the restaurant before? Or the off chance you've ever been to Greece?\" \"I've never left the US.\" (Y/n) explained. \"I've been back and forth across the country several times and maybe I've eaten at a Greek restaurant or been to Little Greece somewhere, but I've never been to the country.\" Dean nodded. \"Hey Dean, can I talk to you for a second?\" Sam asked. Dean was about to tell him no, when (Y/n) interrupted. \"Go on.\" She said. \"I'm a big girl and I know you and Sam have things that you want to talk about without me getting all worked up.\" \"I'll be right back.\" Dean kissed the top of her forehead then followed Sam out of the library towards the war room. \"So?\" \"I think we should call them.\" Sam said. Dean's eyes darkened some. He knew exactly who the \"them\" in this situation was. \"No, no way. Absolutely not.\" Dean growled. \"Dean, they might have more information about whoever this is.\" Sam knew that the information might be in the bunker, but if no Men of Letters had been in here since Abbadon, what was the likelihood that it was easy to find, if it was even here. \"They tortured you Sam. Tortured you.\" \"Mom didn't.\" Sam pointed out. \"Yeah well Mom abandoned us.\" Dean snapped. \"I don't care if she said she loves (Y/n) and she's happy to be back. If she shows back up suddenly and wants to help on her own, fine. But until then, we can handle this ourselves. We have Cas. We can call Crowley. We don't need them.\" \"Okay, fine.\" Sam sighed. \"I was just exploring our options.\" \"That was never an option.\" Dean turned around and left Sam standing there. He went back to (Y/n) and Cas. (Y/n) was holding the knife in her hand, examining it some more. She looked up when Dean came back in. \"Everything okay?\" She asked, even though she knew that she probably wouldn't get the truth. She had just come to accept that the Winchester's were going to have secrets. \"As okay as anything can be right now.\" He patted her shoulder. \"You must be tired after everything today. Why don't we head to bed?\" \"I'm fine.\" (Y/n) lied, trying to hold back a yawn. Dean couldn't help but smirk a little at her. \"Yeah, sure you are. Come on.\" He took her hands and gently pulled her to her feet. \"If you guys figure anything out, just let me know. I'm taking her to bed.\" Sam and Cas nodded and started to work on some research. Cas watched to make sure that (Y/n) and Dean would be out of earshot. \"Did you talk to him about contacting the British Men of Letters?\" Cas asked. Sam sighed. \"Yeah, and he gave me the response I thought he would.\" Sam explained. Cas nodded. \"Well, I guess I'll pool my resources and see what I can figure out.\" Cas told Sam. \"Maybe call Crowley?\" Sam suggested, trying to hide the smile on his face. \"Oh goody. I can hardly wait.\" Cas couldn't even mask the sass that was seeping into his words, it was so thick. \"You just stay here and study the books. I'm going to go do my own research.\" With that, Cas disappeared, leaving Sam alone with a table of books. **** The halls were quiet except for the echoing of Oxford's against the cold tile floor. A man in a very nicely tailored suit knocked on the heavy door, waiting for access. \"Enter.\" Mick said. Working the midnight shift like always. \"Sir.\" The man said, stepping into Mick's temporary office. \"I have something you might want to see.\" He placed a black and white surveillance photo on the desk. Mick leaned forward and examined it. It was the man from the restaurant. This was a photo of him going in, captured by a CCTV camera across the street. \"Well, I'll be damned.\" Mick laughed. \"My father told me stories about this, but I didn't believe him.\" He looked up at the man. \"Owen, how familiar are you on Greek mythology?\" \"I believe I took a course on it at the academy...\" Owen said. \"Why?\" \"This man,\" He pointed at the picture. \"According to my father, has lived several lifetimes with the same face. And it all ties back to Ancient Greece.\" Mick couldn't help but smile. \"And I'm finally going to catch him. Contact Mary.\" \"But sir, she was a little...upset the last time we were in contact with her.\" Owen pointed out. \"Where was this photo taken?\" Mick asked, sidestepping the comment. \"Lebanon, Kansas sir.\" Owen informed him. \"If he is in Lebanon, then Mary will most likely want to help with this. Because her sons might very well be in danger.\" Mick set up straight. \"Wherever this man goes, there is usually another man and a woman not far away. And they cause so much havoc. I think Mary would just hate it if her boys were caught in the crossfire.\" \"Okay sir. I will get in contact with Mary.\" With that, Owen left. Mick picked up the photo from his desk. \"Up until his death, my father was obsessed with finding you.\" Mick spoke to no one but the photo. \"After your encounter with him in Berlin, he was never the same. He was a man on a mission.\" A smile spread across Mick's face. \"And now, I can finally bring him the closure that he craved for so long, Epimetheus.\" \"Pandora, come back to me...\" (Y/n) awoke like she did almost every morning for the past few months. This time, she didn't almost scream like she did in the past. Maybe it was because he knew Dean was right beside her. But for some reason, this voice didn't seem as threatening as it did in the past. She just couldn't explain it. She quietly got out of bed and wrapped her favorite blanket from the foot of the bed around her. Dean was still fast asleep, his head pushed into the pillow and one hand resting under it. Just like old times, when he was stressed and on alert. She made her way out of their bedroom, quietly shutting the door, and made her way to the kitchen. She passed by the library and peeked in to see Sam asleep at the table, books around him and a puddle of drool by his open mouth. More and more, he seemed to be sleeping in the library than his own bedroom. (Y/n) was really amazed that he didn't have a stiff neck from all these times. She headed towards the kitchen to start making breakfast. As soon as that bacon started frying, the boys seemed to spring to life. \"Good morning boys.\" (Y/n) said, not even turning around from the stove. \"There's coffee in the pot. Eggs and bacon will be done soon and the biscuits just came out of the oven.\" \"You do way too much for us.\" Dean said, wrapping his arms around her waist and resting his chin on her shoulder. \"You're too good to us.\" \"You're my boys.\" She laughed. She worked a job that actually paid money so they wouldn't have to rely on credit card scams and hustling anymore. The world had changed a lot, and credit cards were harder to grab on to. Not that Sam had a problem with finding them fake everything. But companies were catching on. Thankfully, (Y/n) was there to save the day, just like always. \"Can we do anything for you today?\" Dean murmured against her skin. \"As much as I would love to take you up on that offer, I do have to go to work today.\" She felt Dean frown against her skin. \"Vivian's son is sick. She asked me if I could cover. I'll be in overtime and the extra money will be nice.\" \"(Y/n), I don't think that's a good idea.\" Sam said. \"But...\" \"Sam's right.\" Dean said, letting go of her so she could plate the bacon and eggs. \"There's a man out there trying to get you.\" \"I can't just quit my job because of this.\" (Y/n) said. \"No one is asking you to quit,\" Dean told her. \"But we are asking you to just lay low for a little bit.\" \"I would be working in the morning to afternoon. So I won't be alone. There will be other waiters and stuff. And plenty of customers.\" (Y/n) told them. \"Do you have Wi-Fi there?\" Sam asked. \"Yeah, why?\" (Y/n) asked. Dean looked over at Sam, who had a smile on his face. Dean groaned and pinched the bridge of his nose. \"You two are way too much sometimes, you know that?\" **** Dean sat at a table by a window that didn't get filled very often. Sam was more towards the back with his laptop up and going. They both took turns ordering things so that they wouldn't be asked to leave, but with the boss out on vacation and (Y/n) being a big shot around here, no one was going to ask them. Sam was doing some research with bits and pieces of information he had found in the books at home. Cas still hadn't come back yet, but they were counting on him to be back soon. (Y/n) was standing at the counter, watching everything. Finally, after a minute, she made her way over to Dean. \"I don't think he's coming.\" She told him. He looked up at her over the milkshake glass on his table. \"Why don't you go get us a movie and some pizzas for tonight? I think the store down the road has the frozen ones on sale.\" \"I'm not leaving until your shift is over.\" Dean leaned back in his chair slightly. (Y/n) raised an eyebrow. \"Really? Because isn't that like the fourth milkshake you've had and how many coffees has that been? And I haven't seen you go to the bathroom once.\" Dean groaned some. \"Go on. I don't want to deal with you if you get a bladder infection.\" \"Okay, I'll be right back. Sam is right there if you need anything.\" With that, he jumped up and ran to the bathroom. (Y/n) couldn't help but laugh a little as she cleaned up some of the dishes on his table. She glanced up at Sam, who was typing away at his laptop. The sound of the door opening then. (Y/n) was ready to greet and set the new customer, but instead gasped and dropped a coffee cup, causing it to shatter. That got Sam's attention. \"You.\" (Y/n) said. The restaurant was silent as he made his way to (Y/n). \"Hello Pandora.\" He said with a soft smile. (Y/n) had to admit, he was a pretty good looking guy. If she wasn't with Dean and this man was crazy, she might give him a shot. Thankfully, she had her Dean. And with Dean came Sam, who was currently stepping in-between the man and his target. \"Move.\" \"Yeah, not happening.\" Sam said. \"When Epimetheus commands you to do something, you listen.\" The man growled. Sam shook his head. Epimetheus touched the middle of Sam's chest, sending flying back into a wall and away from his precious girl. \"So, that's your name?\" (Y/n) asked. Epimetheus turned his attention to her. \"You don't remember?\" He asked. \"What happened to you while I was away my darling Pandora?\" He started to walk towards you, the anger with Sam being replaced with a gentleness that (Y/n) saw in Dean's eyes when it was just him and her. She slowly backed away from Epimetheus though; not out of fear of him hurting her, but fear of him taking her away from her boys. But soon, she hit the wall. Epimetheus gently touched her cheek. \"Hey!\" Dean called out, running towards them as Sam got to his feet. Several customers had their phones out, ready to call the police. Dean tackled Epimetheus to the ground, getting a few good punches in before Epimetheus tossed him off of him. \"(Y/n), come on.\" Sam said, pulling her through the kitchen and out the back. They raced outside, watching for anyone that might be there to jump them. Seeing no one, Sam led (Y/n) to the Impala. He knew she would be safer there. \"We can't leave Dean!\" (Y/n) called out. \"We're not. But I gotta keep you safe.\" Sam pointed out. Just then, Dean came out the front door, looking around. \"Where'd he go?\" Dean asked. Sam shrugged. \"I was just fighting him and then he was gone.\" \"Are you okay?\" (Y/n) asked, more worried about Dean than herself. That's how she always was. \"Yeah, I'm fine. What about you?\" He looked around to make sure that Epimetheus wasn't lurking. \"Shaken but fine.\" (Y/n) said. \"He acted like he didn't want to hurt me.\" \"Yeah, well I'll sure as hell hurt him if I see his face again.\" Dean growled. \"Come on, let's get home before the cops show up.\" (Y/n) sighed. \"Does this mean I'll have to quit my job?\" She asked. \"We'll figure it out later.\" Dean said, rubbing her back. \"Come on.\" He finally got her to get in the Impala. They headed back to the bunker, silence echoing in the Impala. \"He told me his name.\" (Y/n) finally said as they pulled up to the bunker. Sam turned around and looked at her. \"He did?\" He asked. \"Yeah. Right after he threw you. His name is Epimetheus.\" She told them. Sam set there for a second. \"Why does that sound so familiar?\" He asked himself. Dean pulled the Impala into the garage. They all piled out and went to change clothes and relax a little bit before meeting back in the library. Sam got back to work with the books, letting Dean do some electronic research for once. (Y/n) was pacing. That's what she did when she was trying to think. \"So, his name is Epimetheus?\" Dean finally said. \"Coming up with anything over there Sam?\" \"Just a whole lot of Greek mythology. What about you?\" Sam asked. \"Same.\" Dean sighed. He shut the laptop lid. \"There has to be some explanation.\" \"He called me Pandora again.\" (Y/n) said, seeming to be in her own world. \"He acted like I should know him. He asked me what had happened to me.\" She started to bite her nails, a habit that she had done when she was little that helped her deal with anxiety. Dean stood up and gently pulled her hand away from her mouth then pulled her to him. She clung to him, resting her head on his chest. \"I promise we're going to figure this out.\" He assured her. \"You're not alone. We're here for you.\" He kissed the top of her head. \"But until we get this figured out, I think it's best if you stay here. He hasn't shown up here yet, so I'm not sure if he can track you here.\" (Y/n) nodded. \"I think I want to get a shower and just kinda relax in our room for a little bit.\" (Y/n) told Dean. She kissed Dean before turning away and heading to their bedroom. Dean watched her walk away and felt his heart drop. He hated that there was something going on that he couldn't fix quickly. Sam watched his brother, seeming to know exactly what was going through his head. \"We're going to figure this out Dean. There has to be an answer out there somewhere.\" Sam assured Dean. Dean turned to look at him. \"We have to find something Sammy. We have to help her.\" Sam nodded and bent back over his books, trying to find an answer for her. **** (Y/n) left the shower, wrapped in just a fluffy towel Dean had snagged from a nice hotel they had went to a few months ago. She went into their bedroom and found her favorite white babydoll that she had bought when they first moved into the bunker and she didn't have to worry about nasty motels ruining her good clothes. She dried off her hair and skin before slipping into the baby doll and turning to the mirror that hung on the closet door. She started to brush her hair when a voice from the chair in the corner of their room that Dean normally threw his clothes on, echoed. \"It is you.\" (Y/n) froze and slowly turned, expecting to see Epimetheus standing there, but instead, she found a man that looked more like Dean. \"I was waiting for you in New York, just like we planned.\" \"Who are you?\" (Y/n) asked. He stood from the chair and walked to her, hands grazing on her arms and his lips close to hers. \"Who did this to you?\" He asked quietly. (Y/n) couldn't respond, to taken aback by his glittering green eyes. That's when the bedroom door opened and Dean came in. \"Hey (Y/n), I just wanted to check on...\" He froze when he saw the man that had his girlfriend a little too close. He reached over to the table by the door and pulled out a knife. He wished he had a gun on him, but the knife would have to do for now. \"Who are you?\" The man just smiled at Dean before turning his attention back to (Y/n). \"Shhh, just relax.\" He said before touching her forehead. (Y/n) fell bonelessly, her eyes closing. The man caught her easily and smirked at Dean before disappearing with her in a burst of flames. \"No!\" Dean screamed, turning around to see if he was somewhere close. \"Sam! Sam!\" Dean screamed. Sam came running. \"Dean?! What's wrong?\" Sam asked. \"(Y/n) was just taken!\" Dean called to him. \"By Epimetheus?\" Sam asked. Dean shook his head. \"No, but I think by someone who is involved with this.\" Dean said. He hauled off and punched the stone wall then. Sam was sure that, if he hadn't broken a knuckle, he had probably dislocated one. \"Dean...\" Sam started, but Dean cut him off. \"As much as I hate to say this, I think it's time we got in contact with them.\" Dean finally said. Sam's eyes widened. \"Are you sure about this?\" Sam asked. \"No, but we need to.\" Dean sighed. \"Call her, because I can't.\" I may have cried while writing part of this chapter.... There weren't any voices waking her this time. When (Y/n) woke up, it wasn't with a gasp and a cold sweat. She actually felt rested. She blinked a couple times, expecting to find one of two options: Dean towering over her with worry written all over his face, or tied up someplace by the man from her bedroom. Instead, she found neither. She was in the middle of a king sized bed all by herself. A soft light filled the room, showing off the white marble and white bedding. Everything was so clean and pristine. (Y/n) set up slowly, looking around the room. The bedroom where she was sleeping was simply, but elegantly decorated. A white settee set at the foot of the bed, white curtains hung on the window, and a white canopy surrounded the bed. There were blue accents here and there, but for the most part, it was white everywhere. (Y/n)'s feet touched cool wooden planks as she climbed out of the warm covers. She shivered some, since she was still wearing her babydoll. She felt that she blended in a little too well with the rest of the room. \"Where am I?\" (Y/n) asked herself softly. She knew Dean wasn't here. She could just feel it. She made her way to the window, pulling back the curtains. She thought maybe if she could see out, she could figure out where she was and try to contact someone for help. But as she opened the curtains, she couldn't see anything outside. The window was dark, no light from the outside coming in. She looked down at the window sill to see an all too familiar angel sigil carved into the wood. \"Well, that's just great.\" She murmured to herself. She let the curtains fall closed and made her way to the heavy, wooden door that she assumed led out of the room. She placed her ear against the door, trying to see if she could hear anything. And she did hear something. She heard soft music playing on the other side. Ignoring almost every rule she had that was running through her head, she carefully opened the door and made her way out into what she assumed was the living room. It was just as clean as the bedroom was, with just a little more furniture and a TV hanging on the wall. But that's not where the music was coming from. She could see into the kitchen, where someone was standing with their back to her. She glanced around the room and her eyes fell on a record player and suddenly, she found it hard to move. Instead, she just focused on the music playing. We'll meet again, don't know where, don't know when... **** But I know we'll meet again some sunny day. The Vera Lynn song was being sung by a young girl on stage. She was probably ready to join the USO, to entertain the troops and keep up their morale over in Europe. Pandora looked around the room, her dark hair let loose to run down her back. She had on a black velvet, Sophie dress. She wanted to look beautiful for him. \"Excuse me ma'am, are you waiting for someone?\" A man asked. Pandora turned around and her red lips split into a smile. \"Prometheus!\" She said, throwing her arms around him. \"Or should I use your current name?\" \"Prometheus is just fine my love.\" He took off his dress hat and held it under his arm. Pandora took in his look. Army dress. Somehow he got drafted. At least, she hoped he got drafted and he didn't enlist. \"Shall we dance?\" He offered out a hand to her. She smiled and took it as he replaced his hat on his head. Pandora let Prometheus lead her out onto the dance floor, where other couples were holding onto each other. He had one hand holding hers, the other wrapped around her back while she rested her free hand on his shoulder. After a moment, she rested her head on his chest, able to hear his strong heartbeat. As they moved around the room, she could see others doing the same thing. All the men in this room would soon be off to war, or at least most of them would be. The women in their arms would be taking up their roles in the factories and helping out in the hospitals. She was the latter. But just like all those girls, her man was leaving her here. \"I don't understand.\" Pandora finally said. Prometheus looked down at her. \"You don't understand what my love?\" He asked. She looked up at him, her eyes shining with unshed tears. \"This is the first time in so many years that it's just you and me. Epimetheus has yet to come back into our lives. Why can't we just be happy together for once?\" A tear finally fell down her cheek. Prometheus wiped it away. \"My dear, do not cry. You know why I have to do this.\" He told her. \"My main goal is keeping you safe. Nothing is more important than that to me. If I have to face another reincarnation to do that, then so be it.\" \"But let's just be immortal together. We will never age. We will never be hurt and we will never be apart.\" Prometheus shook his head. \"What if something happens while you're gone? What if I don't reincarnate?\" \"We have this talk every time.\" Prometheus couldn't help but smile. \"You will always come back to me, just like I always come back to you. We just have to be patient while waiting for each other.\" He held her close to him. \"I will always wait for you. I will always find you. I love you.\" \"I love you too.\" She whispered. They danced for a little more before heading out of the party. A light snow was falling around them as Prometheus looked to the dark sky. \"We'll meet again, don't know where, don't know when. But I know we'll meet again some sunny day.\" Prometheus sang to Pandora. She couldn't help but smile at him. He held her hand, playing with the ring on her finger. \"Someday, it can be just you and me. No wars, no separation, no death. If I don't make it home from Europe, when I'm reborn, I will find you.\" He placed a soft kiss upon her lips. \"I will come home to you.\" \"I know you will.\" She moved so he wrapped her in his arms and he deepened the kiss. A deep and longing kiss that he had wanted for so long, but couldn't. Epimetheus was always around. But not this time. For this night, it was just her and him. Together, as it should be. As they broke apart, he rested his forehead on hers. \"I'll find you. I promise.\" **** \"Pandora?\" A soft voice broke through the vision she was having. (Y/n) didn't realize she had sunk to the cold floor or that a tear was falling down her face. She looked up at the man, staring down at her with those green eyes that she just saw in the vision. \"Your name...your name is Prometheus.\" (Y/n) said. He carefully helped her to her feet and looked over her, a smile on his face. \"You remember?\" He asked. She shook her head. \"I just saw you in a vision.\" She explained. \"Because of that song.\" Another tear fell down her face. \"You didn't come back from Europe, did you?\" His smile fell and he turned away from her. He had been so happy, thinking he had gotten his Pandora back. \"I died in France, on a beach. I was so close to getting home.\" He explained. \"We were supposed to meet in New York. That was our city. But something must have happened between my death and rebirth.\" He turned back to look at her. \"Something happened to you.\" Something deep inside (Y/n) was telling her to go to him, to hold him and comfort him. But something else, a stronger voice, was telling her to run. So she listened to the stronger voice and slipped away from Prometheus and headed towards what she hoped was the front door. \"Pandora! Wait!\" Prometheus called out, but (Y/n) didn't listen to him. She ran out of what was a townhouse in just her nightgown and bare feet. She wasn't sure where she was, but she could see light. The windows were blacked out, not allowing her to see out. She still didn't know where she was, but she could feel a change, not being surrounded by the magic. \"Cas!\" (Y/n) cried out. \"Castiel! Dean! Sam! Somebody help me!\" \"Pandora, come back inside!\" Prometheus said, hurrying over to her. But before he could get to her, an angel with two angry hunters appeared, stopping his path. Dean quickly pulled (Y/n) to him, wrapping his jacket around her as she shivered. \"Pandora, please.\" \"Her name is (Y/n).\" Dean hissed at him. Prometheus shook his head. \"That's not true. Her name is Pandora. My name is Prometheus.\" \"Like the titan?\" Cas asked, staring at him. \"Yes, exactly.\" Prometheus told them. \"That's impossible.\" Sam said. Prometheus shook his head. \"There are many things that I have to tell you. All of you. So why don't we all go in and talk about this. I can even remove the sigils.\" Prometheus said. Dean was about to tell him to go screw himself, but (Y/n) spoke up first. \"Our home, not yours.\" She said. She wanted answers. She wanted to know why this was all happening to her. She felt a stronger connection to Prometheus than to Epimetheus. There was a draw to him that she only ever felt from Dean. \"You don't love California anymore?\" Prometheus asked, earning a confused look from (Y/n). \"Hermes said that you enjoyed it here while I was gone. I just thought that it would help you to be in a place you loved.\" He sighed when he figured out that (Y/n) had no idea what he was talking about. \"Fine, back to that moldy hole in the ground.\" \"Hey!\" Dean said. Prometheus ignored him. \"I'll let you lead the way.\" Prometheus said, bowing slightly. Cas looked at Sam, Dean, and Nicole, teleporting them back home. Prometheus followed not long after, arriving in a show of flames like he had earlier. It took Dean a moment to get his bearings, but when he did, he saw Prometheus gazing longingly at (Y/n). \"Okay, we're here. So spill.\" Dean said, pulling her close to him. Prometheus took a seat at the table to his left, waving his hand for the others to settle in. Everyone took a seat and looked at the Titan, awaiting what he had to say. \"I don't know how familiar you are with Greek myths,\" He started. \"But most of them aren't true, or they are overexpanded to be these epic tales or merciless gods and their constant exploits.\" He looked at everyone. \"The story of Pandora was a lot more detailed than any myth you might have been told.\" \"Well, just get on with it then.\" Dean grumbled. Sam kicked him under the table and gave him a look. A look that Dean was quite familiar with but still chose to ignore. (Y/n) leaned forward in her seat some, ready to hear what Prometheus had to say. \"Cronus was locked away by Zeus and his siblings,\" Prometheus began. \"The world had once been in chaos. So Zeus used some of godly powers and created some gods and goddesses to help balance out the world. And among some of his creations was the most beautiful woman I had ever laid my eyes on...\" \"Pandora?\" Sam asked. Prometheus nodded. \"I fell in love with her at first sight.\" He smiled slightly at the memory. \"So I volunteered to watch over this new world. I created the first humans out of clay while Zeus's children started to grow and develop their talents. But then my pride started to get the best of me. The Titan side of me wanted their loyalty, their worship. So I stole the sacred fire of the gods and gave it to them to win their favor.\" He looked down in shame then. \"So Zeus punished me.\" \"Wouldn't let you play with your toys?\" Dean said sarcastically. Prometheus glared at him. \"He stole my love away from me and forced her into a marriage with my brother, Epimetheus.\" (Y/n) looked at him, seeing the pain in his eyes. \"Epimetheus is your brother?\" Sam asked. \"Yes.\" He said with a soft voice. \"I was forced to attend their wedding. I watched as he kissed my true love. They were showered with gifts and praises. But then Zeus, that egotistical bastard, pushed a jar containing the horrors of the universe in it. He knew her curiosity would get the best of her. And Deimos didn't help much. He convinced her to just take a peek. And when she did, we were all cursed to live for eternity.\" \"Wait a minute.\" Sam said, pausing him. \"Dean, we knew this.\" \"We did?\" Sam nodded. \"How?\" \"Artemis.\" Sam told him. Prometheus flinched some. \"Yeah, yeah. I remember that now.\" Dean looked at Prometheus. \"In fact, we already met a Prometheus.\" \"That is hard to explain.\" Prometheus said. \"I might have created a new body in case I was to ever need it. And he became sentient.\" He growled some. \"But that's not the point of this story. Because of what Zeus did to Pandora, we can die, but we come back to life. Sometimes it's days, sometimes it can be years. When I was killed on Normandy Beach, it took years for my body to come back to life.\" \"Aren't you usually supposed to remember things?\" Dean asked. \"Yes. So that's why something had to have happened to Pandora while I was gone. Because the only times that memories don't transfer is magical interference, and the very rare occasions that we don't come back to life.\" Prometheus looked over at (Y/n), who was playing with the necklace around her neck. \"Only Pandora would have that necklace.\" \"This?\" She asked, playing with it. \"My grandmother gave it to me. She collected costume jewelry back in her youth and she found this in her jewelry box.\" \"That was a gift from Athena.\" Prometheus said. \"On your wedding. She gave it to you right before Zeus gave you that horrid jar.\" (Y/n) looked down at the old, coin looking object with an owl pressed onto it. (Y/n) stood up. \"I don't care if I am this Pandora or not,\" She stated. \"I'm not going anywhere. This is my home.\" She watched as Prometheus's skin glowed some. \"Were you really that mad at me that you decided to do this?\" He asked. \"I had to keep you safe! That is the only thing I cared about! Do you think I would've gone to France on June 6, 1944 if I didn't want to keep you safe?\" \"I think it's time you leave.\" Cas said, standing up. Dean and Sam followed suite. \"You did something to her, didn't you?\" Prometheus asked, looking right at Dean. \"That's why she's so loyal to you, isn't it?\" He held his hand out, a fireball appearing in it. \"I might not be Hephaestus, but I think I can control this just fine.\" (Y/n)'s eyes widened. \"Prometheus...\" She said, but he shook his head. \"He did something to you. It only seems right that I do something to him.\" With that, Prometheus threw the fireball straight at Dean. Dean was quick though, his reflexes not dulled by age. Cas, Sam, and Dean dived for cover while (Y/n) stood and stared at Prometheus, her mouth opened slightly in a surprised look. \"Son of a bitch!\" Dean growled, pulling (Y/n) from her frozen state. She dropped to the floor him him while he unholstered the gun that he kept hidden under the table. It might be home, but you still had to be prepared for anything. \"What are you doing?\" (Y/n) asked. Dean looked over at her. \"He's asking for a fight, so he's got one.\" He growled. \"No one tries to blow me up in my own freakin' house!\" \"Dean, don't do anything stupid.\" Sam said, but it was too late. Dean was already standing, ready to fire. **** Mary had been staying at the compound for a while. She didn't want to go back to the bunker. There were too many things she wanted to see and she could feel a bit of a hostility between her and her oldest. And everytime she looked at her youngest, all she could see what that little baby that she greedily brought into this life. She didn't regret having Sam, that wasn't it. She regretted the pain she brought upon him. But he had called, asking for her help. And as she set in her room with the military style mattress and blanket, she stared down at her phone. Should she call him? Should she go over there? Should she hope that he could figure out whatever the problem was without her? She looked up at her door again, partly because she was debating on if she should go and partly because of the noise outside of it. Then there was a knock. \"Come in.\" Mary said. The door swung open and Mick walked in. \"I didn't see you for dinner.\" He said, watching her body language. \"And Ketch said he didn't see you for lunch either.\" \"I ate in my room.\" Mary said. \"Sam called and I've been weighing my options.\" \"You're still hiding from them?\" Mick asked with a bit of a laugh. \"What does Sam need anyway?\" \"Somethings wrong with Dean's girlfriend,\" She explained. \"So Sam wanted information on Greek gods or something like that.\" Mick just stared at her. \"Mick?\" \"Does it have something to do with someone named Epimetheus?\" Mick asked. \"Uh, yeah. How did you know?\" She asked. \"My father, a former member of the Men of Letters, was part of an operation many years ago called Operation Roundup.\" He started. \"Come with me. I think you'll want to see all the information he gathered.\" Mary stood up. \"I'll send plenty of information to the boys, but right now, I think that that you need to see it first.\" \"Well, okay then.\" Mary said, following Mick out of the room and to his office. (See the end of the chapter for notes.) \"Stop this!\" (Y/n) called out as a fireball flew past her head. Sam quickly snagged her hand and pulled her down under the table while Dean fired a full clip at Prometheus. Cas launched himself at the Titan, only to be tossed into the wall like he was nothing. He crashed against a bookcase, burying himself in books. \"Guys!\" \"I'm not stopping anything until this human is dead.\" Prometheus hissed. \"Apparently you're exactly like your brother.\" Dean taunted, which really wasn't a good idea. \"I am nothing like my brother!\" Prometheus roared. He launched more fireballs at Dean, who dropped to the ground and hid by (Y/n). \"Of course, the one time that we need the Colt.\" (Y/n) looked over at Dean. \"Dean, bullets obviously aren't working and he has fire. We need to stop.\" She said. Dean shook his head. \"He's trying to take you away from me.\" Dean said, cupping her cheek. Sam cleared his throat. \"As much as I love hiding under this table, we can't stay here.\" Sam said. \"We have to get to the garage or something.\" Dean and (Y/n) nodded, trying to think of their escape plan. But as they thought of what their next move was, the table they were hiding under was lifted and thrown away from them. (Y/n) looked at the pair of boots that stood right in front of them as she heard Prometheus groan in pain. \"Epimetheus.\" (Y/n) whispered as she looked up at him. He grabbed her arm and pulled her up, making her squeal. \"Let go of her Epimetheus.\" Prometheus groaned as he got to his feet, holding onto the wall for support. Epimetheus laughed. \"You speak like she's your betrothed.\" He said, holding (Y/n) close to him. \"I'm taking her away and helping her remember what she has forgotten.\" Cas appeared behind him then, grabbing him back the back of his neck and throwing him away from (Y/n). \"Cas, get her out of here!\" Dean called out. Cas headed towards (Y/n), ready to teleport her out of danger, but Prometheus and Epimetheus both were not going to let that happen. \"I don't have time for you, pathetic angel.\" Epimetheus hissed punching Cas in the face and causing him to stagger away from (Y/n). \"You're interfering in everything, just like your kind always does.\" He kept punching Cas, who was dodging as much as he could. \"Stop!\" (Y/n) cried out at everything going on around her. It was all becoming way too much. Epimetheus dropped Cas and went to her, cupping her face. \"Don't worry my darling Pandora. We'll get out of here and go someplace safe so you can heal.\" He said with gentleness in his voice. \"My name is (Y/n).\" She said, tears streaming down her face. \"Why can't you just leave me alone?\" \"Because you're my wife and I love you.\" He said, leaning in and kissing her, hoping that it would do something. And it did. It pissed Dean Winchester off to no end. He ran at Epimetheus, hoping to get him away from (Y/n), but the Titan was ready. Mumbling some words of Greek, a gust of wind filled the bunker, knocking Dean, Sam, Prometheus, and Cas to the ground. \"Just let me go.\" (Y/n) whispered. \"I've lost you too many times. I won't lose you again.\" He said, holding her arms. Something changed then. Her eyes darkened some and she looked straight into Epimetheus's eyes. \"You lost me the moment you agreed with Zeus and made me marry you.\" She growled. She swung her arm, knocking Epimetheus away from her. He landed on the table that he had thrown not long before. The others stood there, watching her. She turned to looked at Prometheus, tears on the brim of falling. \"Why couldn't you just leave me alone? I was happy here.\" \"Pandora...\" \"Don't.\" She said, raising her hand. \"Don't you dare say my name every again.\" She held the side of her head then. The memories she had created for herself were starting to collide with her real ones. She wasn't sure what to do next, so she did the only thing she could think of. She ran. \"(Y/n)!\" Dean called out as she disappeared in front of them. He turned around, looking at the destroyed room. \"(Y/n)!\" **** Mary set back in her chair, taking in all the information that Mick had told her. Everything he had on the Greek gods that his father had spent years chasing. She thought he was crazy at first, but after everything that she had seen in her lifetime, she had to believe him. \"So, you think that these gods are after Dean's girlfriend?\" Mary asked. Mick nodded. \"But why did your father care so much about this?\" Mick went to his safe and unlocked it, pulling out what looked like an old Greek vase to Mary. \"What's that?\" \"This, my dear, is Pandora's box.\" Mick explained. Mary was about to say something, but he stopped her. \"I know, it's a jar, but translations and such labeled it as a box.\" \"I remember reading about Pandora's Box.\" Mary told Mick. \"She opened it and released the evil inside on the world, but left hope inside.\" \"Exactly.\" Mick said, setting the jar on his desk. \"She's the only one who can open it. If we follow these gods, we can find her. If we can find her, we can get her to open it.\" \"And release hope onto the Earth.\" Mary finished. Mick smiled. \"Exactly.\" He set down. \"Maybe a little hope is what we need to rid the world of monsters.\" Mary nodded. That was a pretty good plan. And if these gods thought Dean's girlfriend was this Pandora, it was a good place to start. \"So, what do you need from me?\" Mary asked. \"Take Ketch. There's a girl in Garden City that will be hard to miss. She might be able to help you lure some of these gods out, and soon, we'll be able to find Pandora.\" **** (Y/n) set at a bar, staring at her phone. She had tried calling people of her family, but all the numbers were dead end or the people had never heard of her before. Had could she be so stupid? She thought this had been her life and she was wrong. She had more questions than answers and her head hurt. But right then, she just wanted to drink it all away. She just hoped that she could get a little drunk before anyone showed up to take her back to the bunker, but so far, nothing was working. That's when a woman set down next to her. \"It's been a long time Pandora.\" The woman said. (Y/n) looked over at the woman and flashes of memories sped through her head. She groaned. \"That happens when your memories try to come back, especially after so many years.\" \"Hera.\" (Y/n) said. \"How did you find me?\" \"A god coming out of hiding is a pretty big beacon.\" She explained. \"Just be glad I'm the one who found you.\" (Y/n) looked away from her. \"I bet you're going through a rough patch right now. I can just offer you a little advice.\" \"Oh yeah, what's that?\" (Y/n) asked. \"Amsterdam is beautiful this time of year.\" Hera said, a smile spreading on her face. (Y/n) turned to look at her. \"Then let's go.\" She said. Hera nodded and touched her shoulder. When the bartender turned around to give (Y/n) her drink, the stool was empty with a pile of coins laying there, to pay for what she had already drunk.

    "text": "Iphigenia cared for no man, so she cried in the dead of night to the moon, to Artemis, offering herself, naked and the color of fawn skin. Artemis found the human lovely; the way her heart beat beneath her arrowhead as she had asked her name, the way the shaft nestled between her breasts, the strain of her neck as she looked to Artemis for favor, the muscles of her thighs as she stretched up onto her toes. Artemis crafted a clever lie to steal her away. She insisted Agamemnon had killed one of her deer, her most beloved. Therefore, she wanted the same of him, of his Iphigenia. There was to be blood, as there was with all girls. He had harmed no such thing, but she forced him to believe it and would soon make it true all the same. The night before Iphigenia was to be sacrificed, she had long been replaced with one of the deer Artemis insisted her father had already killed. The deer had been turned into a human and the poor thing had went to its slaughter the same way it would have gone with her bow, swift and over before it realized what had happened. People thought to pity Iphigenia, but none knew of her blessings. Iphigenia was given moonlight to soak into her skin, hair from a goddess practically being braided into her own as she worked her tongue between her thighs. How far from Artemis' touch it was, how it made her body tremble, her fingers warm and practiced, tugging at her insides like a bow. She never snapped, only released all over the goddesses fingers. Iphigenia was taught to hunt; to pull her wrist back, to remember to breathe, to let go, to feel comfortable in what she had done. She was taught to bathe in blood of what she had killed, relished the thing beneath her, waste not a drop. This was a hunt that did not require a weapon. Artemis would after welcome her to her new death, naked, knee propped up the way her opposing elbow was to rest under her chin, lazy, dripping, and open like the rest of her posture. Her breasts were to be held like fragile offerings, her body was covered in its own pelt, the heady smell of women making Iphigenia dizzy. She offered herself up night after night to the goddess, letting herself be devoured as an offering, her alter a bed of lavish flora. Fingers would gently brush her lips, the wet muscle of her tongue pressing against them, drawing them back into her mouth to suck on. Her eyes would flicker to Artemis, a promise, a gentle haze of desire, a gentle moment before the draw string was tense once more. She would pull her fingers from her mouth, slowly, wet and glistening. They would vanish between her legs and she would cry out for her, fawning over Artemis' touch. She would never go back to the realm of men.",

    "text": "Zagreus did not remember when he started to try escaping the Underworld. Time down here was fuzzy anyway, and a long time ago his frustration had made way to something else. Routine. He wasn't stuck, no, he was making slow progress, but progress nonetheless. Every day he learned something new, how to dodge, how to fight, how to make it just that bit closer to the top. Until he died, that was. A big part of that routine was Achilles. Every time Zagreus died his feet made their way towards his friend, discussing his latest encounters. Often it meant, a little while later, they found themselves in their sparring area, broken and bruised from centuries of fighting, but repaired and cleaned by loyal Dursa who adored the prince. So really who else could he give Ambrosia to, when he found it? Achilles had been loyal to him for so long, working hard to train Zagreus, but also being an open ear whenever he needed it. Somehow Achilles always knew whether he just needed to listen or seriously draw up a new battle plan for him. Zagreus had stopped going to him just for help to get out of the Underworld a long time ago. They were friends. It wasn't a rare sight to see them in a corner of the lounge, enjoying a bit of wine, or even ambrosia when Zagreus could get it, and chat. Today he was telling Achilles about a large demon like creature he had encountered in Asphodel, covered mostly in fire and wielding a large burning club. \"See, I had Aphrodite's blessing this time and I could make it weaker, so it was also slower and I just shot a volley at it from afar!,\" he was explaining excitedly, gesturing wildly. \"But it had thick skin, or something of the sort, so I figure fire isn't the worst thing I encountered. While it was still dazed I ran up to it, and on it! And when I shot an arrow point blank, it just exploded!\" Achilles was listening intently, sipping on his wine and giving him a gentle smile. \"That sounds quite impressive, young prince. Wish I could have been there to witness it.\" \"Well, after that a witch I didn't see shot me from behind and I landed back here so that was most likely not the most graceful exit I've ever made.\" Achilles chuckled softly, and clinked his golden goblet against Zagreus'. \"Still, that was quite impressive. It gladdens me to hear of your improvements.\" \"All thanks to you... and repeatedly dying. It's all practice, I suppose.\" He didn't feel down today, though he could not really tell why. Maybe it was the wine. He took another sip, still smiling. Suddenly Achilles seemed a little sombre, his smile faded. Zagreus looked around, had someone he didn't like come in? But there was no one else here aside from some shades, most likely it was late at night. Not that that had ever counted for anything in the House of Hades. \"Achilles?,\" he asked. \"Is something the matter?\" \"I merely realised you hadn't gone out all day,\" he replied, focusing on him again. \"Do you not wish to try again?\" \"Oh, of course I do,\" Zagreus said, making no move to get up. \"But there is hardly a rush, is there? I make slow progress, and I will get out of here eventually. So I may as well take a break every now and then, besides... I like spending time with you.\" \"So do I, young prince,\" Achilles said softly. He was smiling again and the look in his eyes had changed somewhat. Suddenly he realised how close their hands were, Achilles' shining softly with an ethereal glow. It hit Zagreus like a bomb from one of those shades that had killed him many times before. He wanted to reach out. He knew what his hand felt like, it had been on him many times, steadying him after a sparring match, greeting him, on rare occasions on his shoulder or the small of his back for encouragement. But the way Zagreus wanted to reach out for it now was different. How, in all his time down here, had he never realised that he could fall in love? Abruptly he got up, his chair screeching on the floor as he pushed it back. \"I need to go, I'm really tired I'll talk to you soon Achilles,\" he blurted out and off he went. Was this how Dursa felt when she talked to him? She was always so nervous around him, and blushed in this cute way. Was he blushing? A look into the mirror gifted by Nyx told him yes, yes he was. Prince of the Underworld. He felt that somehow he should be more dignified about this whole thing. Be bold and confident, tell Achilles he wanted to be with him! But as he rolled up into a little ball under the blanket of his bed, he felt it to be impossible. He had too much energy now, and his thoughts went round in a spiral that threatened to overwhelm him, so he did finally brave the outside again. Tartarus was familiar to him now and the lesser enemies here hardly gave him any trouble. But it distracted his mind and he was pretty sure that he finally wasn't blushing anymore. Panting a little he stepped through another door and walked up the stairs to see the room widen, a familiar view in front of him. Charon was waiting here, a small chest by his side and at the docks: His boat. \"Hey, mate, good to see you,\" he said with a wave of his hand as he walked around to see if anyone had hidden any gold in the pots near the corner. The typical long, drawn out sigh came from Charon in reply. Zagreus smiled to himself. Classic Charon. \"So what do you have this time hm...,\" he trailed off when he saw the bottle of ambrosia in the midst of some armour, an amulet, and a lot of coin. His thoughts drifted again. To that smile. Achilles' smile when he gave him that gift. He loved seeing that smile, and he tried not to blush again when he dropped his coin in Charon's chest before taking the small bottle. Somehow he had the feeling that despite not being able to say anything, he knew exactly who Zagreus would give this too. He couldn't help himself. This time when he walked out of the River Styx, pushing himself up and feeling the blood drop off his body, a hand was held in front of him. He took it, watched the rest of the blood fade off his hand, and looked into the eyes of Achilles. He had never greeted him here before. \"Hello, Achilles.\" He pretended to adjust his robe, making sure that all the blood was gone so he didn't have to meet his eyes right away. \"Zagreus. You left so suddenly, I wished to meet you here. Is everything alright?\" There was such concern in his voice, of course there was. He had been quite rude to him. \"Oh I merely...,\" he sighed and shook his head. He was acting like a silly boy. \"I have something for you, would you care to sit with me a little bit?\" \"Always.\" Zagreus led the way in silence, and to his credit Achilles didn't say anything when he walked past the lounge all the way to his room, in the back of his father's house. He didn't have much in the way of comfortable sitting arrangements, and so he sat down on his large bed. Achilles put his spear to lean against the wall and followed suit, both of them sitting cross legged near one another. \"Here,\" Zagreus said, holding out the bottle of ambrosia. \"Another one?,\" Achilles asked, reaching out. His fingers brushed against Zagreus'. \"You spoil me rotten.\" \"Well, maybe I like to,\" he replied, shrugging. He couldn't help but glance at Achilles' arms again, so strong, and wondered what they would feel like wrapped around him. \"How else does one show another one's affection.\" \"By simply telling them about it,\" Achilles replied, leaning in with a sparkle in his eye. Zagreus chuckled in reply. \"Now that would be far too easy.\" Zagreus watched as Achilles uncorked the bottle and took a first sip. He closed his eyes then and Zagreus imagined the drop of golden liquid running down his neck, to which he had to lick his lips. As he watched the shimmer around Achilles almost seemed to lessen, and before his eyes he appeared more solid. More... here. He had never realised this until now, but Achilles had been so much more of a shade when they had first met. Now he could... Zagreus glanced down at their hands resting on the bed, how close they were again, and he slid his hand a little closer. His pinky could now touch Achilles' hand, and it did. His heart thumping in his chest, Zagreus looked up again. Achilles met his eyes and smiled. As he shifted, he came closer, and as if it was an instinct born into Zagreus, he leaned into his presence. There was a warmth there. The warmth of another person. He had never felt it come from any other shade. Slowly, Achilles took his hand. \"Does this have anything to do with your sudden disappearance?,\" he asked softly. \"I... yes. It seems so foolish now. With trying so hard to find my mother, I forgot there were other things.\" He paused for a moment, looking down at their intertwined hands. \"Like love.\" He felt a warm, calloused hand on his cheek that made him look up. There was nothing but love in Achilles' eyes and at the sight, Zagreus sighed. It was like something was constricting around his heart. \"That is quite endearing, do you know that?,\" Achilles chuckled softly. \"Is that your confession?\" \"I think it is,\" Zagreus admitted. \"But I understand if... You mentioned, a long time ago, someone else.\" \"Yes, a long time ago.\" Achilles sighed and squeezed his hand. \"That love will remain with me always, but we are both dead and there is no way towards one another. I know that he wants me to love again as much as I wish this for him to come to pass as well.\" Zagreus' heart skipped a beat. Did this mean? \"Do you love me?,\" he blurted out before he could stop himself. Then he added lamely: \"Mate?\" Achilles chuckled again, and suddenly kissed him. Zagreus was so surprised he wasn't quite sure what to do in this moment. Technically he knew how to kiss, although it had been a while, only suddenly he was overwhelmed. Achilles' hands slowly rubbed his back, coming to rest there and pull him closer. Finally he could relax into the kiss, and even return it. \"I loved you ever since the moment you were born,\" he said against his lips. Zagreus' heart threatened to burst. \"You grew and my love changed. Now you have your own mind, your own heart and it's so... so wonderful. So yes, I do love you, my prince.\" \"I think I loved you for a very long time,\" Zagreus said, allowing himself to sit in Achilles' lap when he pulled him even closer. \"I... never noticed. If that makes sense.\" \"The House of Hades is not the most nurturing of environments,\" Achilles replied. Zagreus reached out and brushed a steak of his hair so it fell behind his shoulder, freeing his face from it. It was so soft, and his fingertips gently rested on his cheek. Warm, and soft. Achilles just watched him as his exploration of him continued, his hand resting on the arm he had been wondering about earlier. Achilles was so strong. \"Am I to your liking, my prince?\" His cheeks flushed with warmth as he realised he had been groping Achilles a little, feeling the strong muscle underneath. \"I apologise,\" he said quickly. \"No need to. Do you wish to see more?,\" he asked, and when Zagreus nodded he removed his clothing so he had a view of his naked torso. Suddenly it got even hotter in the room. \"Go ahead.\" Zagreus reached out, carefully touching his pecs, his abs, all the while with wide eyes. He had never gotten the opportunity to touch someone else this freely. He had to admit that he liked doing this very much. \"May I see you as well?,\" Achilles asked. He stopped in his tracks and looked into his eyes. \"Only if you are comfortable,\" he continued. \"Yes, I hadn't considered- Of course!\" They shuffled around a little until they were both comfortable. And naked. Somehow just undressing half of them simply hadn't worked out. Zagreus wanted more. He wasn't sure where that need or desire had suddenly come from, but it was here and he was brave enough to ask for it. \"Kiss me again, Achilles,\" he said, already leaning in when Achilles happily complied with his request. The covers were pushed aside, just warming their feet a little as they sat on the bed and started making out. Zagreus just could not get enough of it, inching closer and closer, wanting to feel Achilles' tongue against his again and again. He had to pull away for breath, pushing against Achilles' chest. \"One moment,\" he said, panting, before leaning in again. \"I have not breathed in centuries. Apologies.\" \"No, no apologies,\" Zagreus breathed against his lips, kissing him again. A hand found its way on Zagreus' thigh, and simply feeling it there fanned the heat he felt inside him with every kiss and every touch. It slowly moved further up, fingertips caressing gently, over his thigh, towards his ass. Achilles' squeezed and Zagreus smiled into the kiss for a moment, then felt a finger dip between his cheeks. \"I want it,\" Zagreus was panting again from pulling back too late. \"I want to do this, Achilles.\" \"Are you sure? If I am being too bold, simply say the word and I will stop.\" \"No, no I don't want to stop,\" he said quickly. \"Tell me what to do. What do we need?\" \"Is this your first time?\" Zagreus blushed, feeling this different kind of heat in his cheeks. Achilles caressed it again, smiling gently. \"It is,\" he admitted. \"But I want this, I really do.\" \"I am honoured,\" Achilles said, just before kissing him again. \"I will do my best to make this memorable for you.\" \"Oh it will be,\" he replied, grinning. \"It's you.\" \"Sweet prince...\" Achilles trailed off and brushed his nose against his, then kissed the tip of it. Smiling and kissing they got lost in each other for a moment longer, then Zagreus finally looked for the oil from his bedside table. It would be enough, according to Achilles, and he was directed to lie down, helped along with so many kisses and still Zagreus could not get enough of them. \"Turn around for me,\" Achilles whispered to him. \"But I want to see you,\" he replied softly, a little confused by the request. \"I just want to make it as comfortable for you as possible,\" he explained. \"I promise it will feel good.\" \"It's not going to hurt, is it?,\" he asked, then quickly added. \"I mean I can take it of course.\" Achilles softly chuckled, and kissed his cheek when Zagreus had turned around like instructed. \"It won't. Lift your hips a little.\" And Achilles put a pillow under his hips, raising his ass. He felt a little exposed like this but with Achilles he also felt safe. Looking back over his shoulder, Achilles leaned over him again, hands by the side of his shoulders, leaning in for another kiss. \"You are stunning, my prince.\" \"So are you,\" he replied softly, but closed his eyes when he felt Achilles' hand caress his back. Slowly he felt nimble, gentle fingers trace the line of his spine, explore him freely. The warmth of it made Zagreus shudder, he felt himself grow hard when that finger dipped between his cheeks again, rubbing against his hole. Achilles pulled back then and he felt him shifting behind him, guiding Zagreus to spread his legs wider. Then a wetness pushed into him and it took a moment for him to realise that it was his tongue. He shuddered again, fingers curling in the sheets of his bed, when a gasp escaped his lips. \"Oh that feels good,\" he blurted out. \"That feels really good, ahh-\" An oiled finger pushed into him along with the tongue, going deeper than it could previously. Zagreus had never done this with himself, or even thought about it if he was honest - he had always seemed so busy. But wow, wow, this, this he could really love. \"You're doing well,\" Achilles said. \"Stay relaxed and I'll take care of you.\" Zagreus took a deep breath in, let it slowly come out between his parted lips. Achilles kept pushing his finger deeper inside and when he brushed against something in him, Zagreus had to moan. He had never heard himself like this. \"That, I need to hear more,\" he could practically hear the smile in Achilles' voice, and when he kept teasing that spot inside him, Zagreus did not hold back. He didn't care if anyone could hear him, wondered even, if anyone would be listening in, getting as turned on as he was. The thought got him harder, and his hips rutted involuntarily against the pillow. The little bit of friction felt so good, but it wasn't enough. \"I need more,\" he said, half moaning it. \"I need you, Achilles.\" He felt a kiss pressed to the small of his back, silky hair tickling his sides. Another kiss, a little higher up, and so Achilles worked his way along his spine once more, making Zagreus shudder with the anticipation of having him inside him soon. But the way Achilles took his time - it felt like worship. \"I'll go slow,\" Achilles' voice was suddenly close, right by his ear, and he nipped his lobe, lightly, but with the promise of more. \"You don't have to,\" Zagreus turned his head as much as he could to look at Achilles. He felt so hot, so turned on, he didn't want to wait any longer. \"I know you're eager,\" Achilles leaned down again to kiss him again, a kiss he could barely return. \"But trust me, I don't wish to hurt you.\" \"Okay. I trust you.\" He settled into a comfortable position again, closing his eyes when he felt Achilles' cock slide between his cheeks. Feeling the size of it he felt a little anxious, but Achilles had promised that it wouldn't hurt. And there was no one else he trusted as much as him. Achilles whispered into his ear, warning him that he would push into him now and Zagreus took a shaky breath. Achilles felt even bigger when he slowly pushed into him, Zagreus could feel every inch of hard, hot cock inside him. He tried to keep his breathing steady but the sensation was incredible, overwhelming, and as Achilles slid deeper inside him, more moans tumbled from his lips. \"By the gods,\" he moaned. His fingers had found another pillow, holding onto it tightly. \"You feel- You feel incredible!\" \"So do you,\" Achilles replied, and there was a kiss to the back of his neck. \"I have not felt such pleasure in centuries. I did not think I could again. It is all thanks to you.\" The two of them moved in sync as they went for another kiss, a deep one that left Zagreus panting again for a short moment, before Achilles claimed another one. He started to feel a little light headed, but then, suddenly, Achilles started to move. Slow, shallow thrusts at first, then he felt him almost pull all the way out, just to let Zagreus feel every inch sliding in once more. The slow pace almost drove him crazy, and he was quite sure that his moans reflected that. He had gotten loud. But Achilles did not seem to mind, only pushed in deeper once more until Zagreus could feel his hips against his ass. This was all of Achilles inside him, and he knew that he would want more of this. \"I feel so full,\" he blurted out, half moaning it. \"Please, please can you go a bit faster. I need- I need-\" The sudden, hard thrust into him caught him by surprise, and he heard Achilles chuckle above him when his yelp turned into a moan. He pushed back his ass, wanting to feel more, faster, but Achilles held him in place, such a strong hand on the small of his back, pushing him down. Thinking about that strength of his, knowing just how hard he could hit, how steadily he could hold him down, turned him on even more. He was an absolute mess. Achilles thrust into him harder and faster, and with the way he held him down, all Zagreus really could do was take it. In his pleasure riddled mind he imagined other scenarios, of Achilles fucking him against the wall, displaying that famous strength to anyone who would walk by. Gods, he felt perverted at the thought. \"Prince,\" Achilles' voice tore him from those fantasies. \"You wished to turn around, did you not?\" \"Uh-huh,\" was all he managed to bring out, finding it hard to form an entire sentence. Achilles slowly pulled out of him, and Zagreus gasped at the sensation. He didn't want to stop, and quickly turned around, spreading his legs wide so that Achilles could settle between them again. Now he finally saw him again in all his glory. His long hair was dishevelled, his lips slightly parted although there was no rise or fall of his chest. His cock was hard, pointing at him, the oil making it glisten. Zagreus felt other urges, to touch and lick but he also wanted him inside again. Good thing they had all the time in the world. \"You're-,\" the both started at the same time, then stopped abruptly to grin at each other. \"You're too far away,\" Zagreus said softly. \"I had to admire you,\" Achilles replied, but quickly closed the distance between them again. As they kissed, Zagreus felt his cock press against his own, much bigger as he now realised. Not that he minded. \"I love you,\" he whispered against his lips. \"Love me, Achilles. Show me.\" Achilles pushed inside him easily now, and Zagreus arched his back at the new sensation, the pleasure rocking through his entire body once more. Achilles did show him then, with his kisses, gentle but possessive, the marks he left on Zagreus' neck, the light and sweet pain that came along with them, and the way he made love to him. He liked this much better, being able to look at Achilles, touch him, kiss him. His cheeks were a little flushed, and Achilles pressed kisses to them. \"May I come inside?,\" Achilles asked, leaning in to whisper it into his ear, then kissed the spot just below it. For some reason, it felt damn good to Zagreus. When he moaned, Achilles kept kissing that spot, letting his teeth drag over the skin there, and Zagreus' pleasure threatened to overwhelm him. \"Yes, yes please,\" he blurted out between moans. His fingers were digging into Achilles' shoulders, but he didn't give a sign that this bothered him. \"I think- I think I'm gonna come.\" He said this just as Achilles kissed him again, stealing his breath while still thrusting into him. As Achilles pushed the kiss to be deeper, more intense, and he started to feel light headed again, his cock hit that particular spot inside him. Suddenly that red hot pleasure overwhelmed his senses and everything - his own come hitting his chest, Achilles coming inside him - became one confusing, overwhelming and beautiful swirl. Finally, Achilles let him go, moans and catching his breath fought for one another, and he whimpered, drawing in that precious air. His vision needed a moment to clear again, and he was greeted with that lovely smile. Still feeling a little overwhelmed, he nevertheless returned it. Achilles was still inside him, and he didn't want him to pull out. He drew him closer, into a hug, one that Achilles eagerly returned. Rolling on their sides, Zagreus was held this way, still resenting the loss somewhat when Achilles did finally pull out. \"Thank you, Achilles,\" he mumbled, feeling so content in this warm afterglow. Right now, he didn't want to be anywhere else. \"I should be thanking you,\" Achilles replied, and he pulled back a little so Zagreus could see his lovely face. He reached out to trace Achilles' lips. \"Why?\" \"Why? With you, young prince, death is not so bad.\" Grinning, the two kissed again, settling in Zagreus' big bed to not go anywhere for a while. The world above, it could wait. Surely it would not be bad thing to take what good he could find in the House of Hades.",

      "Tartarus was familiar to him now and the lesser enemies here hardly gave him any trouble.",
      "But it distracted his mind and he was pretty sure that he finally wasn't blushing anymore.",
      "Panting a little he stepped through another door and walked up the stairs to see the room widen, a familiar view in front of him.",
      "Charon was waiting here, a small chest by his side and at the docks: His boat.",
      "\"Hey, mate, good to see you,\" he said with a wave of his hand as he walked around to see if anyone had hidden any gold in the pots near the corner.",
      "The typical long, drawn out sigh came from Charon in reply.",
      "Zagreus smiled to himself.",
      "Classic Charon.",
      "\"So what do you have this time hm...,\" he trailed off when he saw the bottle of ambrosia in the midst of some armour, an amulet, and a lot of coin.",
      "His thoughts drifted again.",
      "To that smile.",
      "Achilles' smile when he gave him that gift.",
      "He loved seeing that smile, and he tried not to blush again when he dropped his coin in Charon's chest before taking the small bottle.",
      "Somehow he had the feeling that despite not being able to say anything, he knew exactly who Zagreus would give this too.",
      "He couldn't help himself.",
      "This time when he walked out of the River Styx, pushing himself up and feeling the blood drop off his body, a hand was held in front of him.",
      "He took it, watched the rest of the blood fade off his hand, and looked into the eyes of Achilles.",
      "He had never greeted him here before.",
      "\"Hello, Achilles.\"",
      "He pretended to adjust his robe, making sure that all the blood was gone so he didn't have to meet his eyes right away.",
      "\"Zagreus.",
      "You left so suddenly, I wished to meet you here.",
      "Is everything alright?\"",
      "There was such concern in his voice, of course there was.",
      "He had been quite rude to him.",
      "\"Oh I merely...,\" he sighed and shook his head.",
      "He was acting like a silly boy.",
      "\"I have something for you, would you care to sit with me a little bit?\" \"Always.\"",
      "Zagreus led the way in silence, and to his credit Achilles didn't say anything when he walked past the lounge all the way to his room, in the back of his father's house.",
      "He didn't have much in the way of comfortable sitting arrangements, and so he sat down on his large bed.",
      "Achilles put his spear to lean against the wall and followed suit, both of them sitting cross legged near one another.",
      "\"Here,\" Zagreus said, holding out the bottle of ambrosia.",
      "\"Another one?,\" Achilles asked, reaching out.",
      "His fingers brushed against Zagreus'.",
      "\"You spoil me rotten.\"",
      "\"Well, maybe I like to,\" he replied, shrugging.",
      "He couldn't help but glance at Achilles' arms again, so strong, and wondered what they would feel like wrapped around him.",
      "\"How else does one show another one's affection.\"",
      "\"By simply telling them about it,\" Achilles replied, leaning in with a sparkle in his eye.",
      "Zagreus chuckled in reply.",
      "\"Now that would be far too easy.\"",
      "Zagreus watched as Achilles uncorked the bottle and took a first sip.",
      "He closed his eyes then and Zagreus imagined the drop of golden liquid running down his neck, to which he had to lick his lips.",
      "As he watched the shimmer around Achilles almost seemed to lessen, and before his eyes he appeared more solid.",
      "More... here.",
      "He had never realised this until now, but Achilles had been so much more of a shade when they had first met.",
      "Now he could...",
      "Zagreus glanced down at their hands resting on the bed, how close they were again, and he slid his hand a little closer.",
      "His pinky could now touch Achilles' hand, and it did.",
      "His heart thumping in his chest, Zagreus looked up again.",
      "Achilles met his eyes and smiled.",
      "As he shifted, he came closer, and as if it was an instinct born into Zagreus, he leaned into his presence.",
      "There was a warmth there.",
      "The warmth of another person.",
      "He had never felt it come from any other shade.",
      "Slowly, Achilles took his hand.",
      "\"Does this have anything to do with your sudden disappearance?,\" he asked softly.",
      "\"I... yes.",
      "It seems so foolish now.",
      "With trying so hard to find my mother, I forgot there were other things.\"",
      "He paused for a moment, looking down at their intertwined hands.",
      "\"Like love.\"",
      "He felt a warm, calloused hand on his cheek that made him look up.",
      "There was nothing but love in Achilles' eyes and at the sight, Zagreus sighed.",
      "It was like something was constricting around his heart.",
      "\"That is quite endearing, do you know that?,\" Achilles chuckled softly.",
      "\"Is that your confession?\"",
      "\"I think it is,\" Zagreus admitted.",
      "\"But I understand if...",
      "You mentioned, a long time ago, someone else.\"",
      "\"Yes, a long time ago.\"",
      "Achilles sighed and squeezed his hand.",
      "\"That love will remain with me always, but we are both dead and there is no way towards one another.",
      "I know that he wants me to love again as much as I wish this for him to come to pass as well.\"",
      "Zagreus' heart skipped a beat.",
      "Did this mean?",
      "\"Do you love me?,\" he blurted out before he could stop himself.",
      "Then he added lamely: \"Mate?\" Achilles chuckled again, and suddenly kissed him.",
      "Zagreus was so surprised he wasn't quite sure what to do in this moment.",
      "Technically he knew how to kiss, although it had been a while, only suddenly he was overwhelmed.",
      "Achilles' hands slowly rubbed his back, coming to rest there and pull him closer.",
      "Finally he could relax into the kiss, and even return it.",
      "\"I loved you ever since the moment you were born,\" he said against his lips.",
      "Zagreus' heart threatened to burst.",
      "\"You grew and my love changed.",
      "Now you have your own mind, your own heart and it's so... so wonderful.",
      "So yes, I do love you, my prince.\"",
      "\"I think I loved you for a very long time,\" Zagreus said, allowing himself to sit in Achilles' lap when he pulled him even closer.",
      "\"I... never noticed.",
      "If that makes sense.\"",
      "\"The House of Hades is not the most nurturing of environments,\" Achilles replied.",
      "Zagreus reached out and brushed a steak of his hair so it fell behind his shoulder, freeing his face from it.",
      "It was so soft, and his fingertips gently rested on his cheek.",
      "Warm, and soft.",
      "Achilles just watched him as his exploration of him continued, his hand resting on the arm he had been wondering about earlier.",
      "Achilles was so strong.",
      "\"Am I to your liking, my prince?\"",
      "His cheeks flushed with warmth as he realised he had been groping Achilles a little, feeling the strong muscle underneath.",
      "\"I apologise,\" he said quickly.",
      "\"No need to.",
      "Do you wish to see more?,\" he asked, and when Zagreus nodded he removed his clothing so he had a view of his naked torso.",
      "Suddenly it got even hotter in the room.",
      "\"Go ahead.\"",
      "Zagreus reached out, carefully touching his pecs, his abs, all the while with wide eyes.",
      "He had never gotten the opportunity to touch someone else this freely.",
      "He had to admit that he liked doing this very much.",
      "\"May I see you as well?,\" Achilles asked.",
      "He stopped in his tracks and looked into his eyes.",
      "\"Only if you are comfortable,\" he continued.",
      "\"Yes, I hadn't considered- Of course!\"",
      "They shuffled around a little until they were both comfortable.",
      "And naked.",
      "Somehow just undressing half of them simply hadn't worked out.",
      "Zagreus wanted more.",
      "He wasn't sure where that need or desire had suddenly come from, but it was here and he was brave enough to ask for it.",
      "\"Kiss me again, Achilles,\" he said, already leaning in when Achilles happily complied with his request.",
      "The covers were pushed aside, just warming their feet a little as they sat on the bed and started making out.",
      "Zagreus just could not get enough of it, inching closer and closer, wanting to feel Achilles' tongue against his again and again.",
      "He had to pull away for breath, pushing against Achilles' chest.",
      "\"One moment,\" he said, panting, before leaning in again.",
      "\"I have not breathed in centuries.",
      "Apologies.\"",
      "\"No, no apologies,\" Zagreus breathed against his lips, kissing him again.",
      "A hand found its way on Zagreus' thigh, and simply feeling it there fanned the heat he felt inside him with every kiss and every touch.",
      "It slowly moved further up, fingertips caressing gently, over his thigh, towards his ass.",
      "Achilles' squeezed and Zagreus smiled into the kiss for a moment, then felt a finger dip between his cheeks.",
      "\"I want it,\" Zagreus was panting again from pulling back too late.",
      "\"I want to do this, Achilles.\"",
      "\"Are you sure?",
      "If I am being too bold, simply say the word and I will stop.\"",
      "\"No, no I don't want to stop,\" he said quickly.",
      "\"Tell me what to do.",
      "What do we need?\"",
      "\"Is this your first time?\"",
      "Zagreus blushed, feeling this different kind of heat in his cheeks.",
      "Achilles caressed it again, smiling gently.",
      "\"It is,\" he admitted.",
      "\"But I want this, I really do.\"",
      "\"I am honoured,\" Achilles said, just before kissing him again.",
      "\"I will do my best to make this memorable for you.\"",
      "\"Oh it will be,\" he replied, grinning.",
      "\"It's you.\"",
      "\"Sweet prince...\" Achilles trailed off and brushed his nose against his, then kissed the tip of it.",
      "Smiling and kissing they got lost in each other for a moment longer, then Zagreus finally looked for the oil from his bedside table.",
      "It would be enough, according to Achilles, and he was directed to lie down, helped along with so many kisses and still Zagreus could not get enough of them.",
      "\"Turn around for me,\" Achilles whispered to him.",
      "\"But I want to see you,\" he replied softly, a little confused by the request.",
      "\"I just want to make it as comfortable for you as possible,\" he explained.",
      "\"I promise it will feel good.\"",
      "\"It's not going to hurt, is it?,\" he asked, then quickly added.",
      "\"I mean I can take it of course.\"",
      "Achilles softly chuckled, and kissed his cheek when Zagreus had turned around like instructed.",
      "\"It won't.",
      "Lift your hips a little.\"",
      "And Achilles put a pillow under his hips, raising his ass.",
      "He felt a little exposed like this but with Achilles he also felt safe.",
      "Looking back over his shoulder, Achilles leaned over him again, hands by the side of his shoulders, leaning in for another kiss.",
      "\"You are stunning, my prince.\"",
      "\"So are you,\" he replied softly, but closed his eyes when he felt Achilles' hand caress his back.",
      "Slowly he felt nimble, gentle fingers trace the line of his spine, explore him freely.",
      "The warmth of it made Zagreus shudder, he felt himself grow hard when that finger dipped between his cheeks again, rubbing against his hole.",
      "Achilles pulled back then and he felt him shifting behind him, guiding Zagreus to spread his legs wider.",
      "Then a wetness pushed into him and it took a moment for him to realise that it was his tongue.",
      "He shuddered again, fingers curling in the sheets of his bed, when a gasp escaped his lips.",
      "\"Oh that feels good,\" he blurted out.",
      "\"That feels really good, ahh-\" An oiled finger pushed into him along with the tongue, going deeper than it could previously.",
      "Zagreus had never done this with himself, or even thought about it if he was honest - he had always seemed so busy.",
      "But wow, wow, this, this he could really love.",
      "\"You're doing well,\" Achilles said.",
      "\"Stay relaxed and I'll take care of you.\"",
      "Zagreus took a deep breath in, let it slowly come out between his parted lips.",
      "Achilles kept pushing his finger deeper inside and when he brushed against something in him, Zagreus had to moan.",
      "He had never heard himself like this.",
      "\"That, I need to hear more,\" he could practically hear the smile in Achilles' voice, and when he kept teasing that spot inside him, Zagreus did not hold back.",
      "He didn't care if anyone could hear him, wondered even, if anyone would be listening in, getting as turned on as he was.",
      "The thought got him harder, and his hips rutted involuntarily against the pillow.",
      "The little bit of friction felt so good, but it wasn't enough.",
      "\"I need more,\" he said, half moaning it.",
      "\"I need you, Achilles.\"",
      "He felt a kiss pressed to the small of his back, silky hair tickling his sides.",
      "Another kiss, a little higher up, and so Achilles worked his way along his spine once more, making Zagreus shudder with the anticipation of having him inside him soon.",
      "But the way Achilles took his time - it felt like worship.",
      "\"I'll go slow,\" Achilles' voice was suddenly close, right by his ear, and he nipped his lobe, lightly, but with the promise of more.",
      "\"You don't have to,\" Zagreus turned his head as much as he could to look at Achilles.",
      "He felt so hot, so turned on, he didn't want to wait any longer.",
      "\"I know you're eager,\" Achilles leaned down again to kiss him again, a kiss he could barely return.",
      "\"But trust me, I don't wish to hurt you.\"",
      "\"Okay.",
      "I trust you.\"",
      "He settled into a comfortable position again, closing his eyes when he felt Achilles' cock slide between his cheeks.",
      "Feeling the size of it he felt a little anxious, but Achilles had promised that it wouldn't hurt.",
      "And there was no one else he trusted as much as him.",
      "Achilles whispered into his ear, warning him that he would push into him now and Zagreus took a shaky breath.",
      "Achilles felt even bigger when he slowly pushed into him, Zagreus could feel every inch of hard, hot cock inside him.",
      "He tried to keep his breathing steady but the sensation was incredible, overwhelming, and as Achilles slid deeper inside him, more moans tumbled from his lips.",
      "\"By the gods,\" he moaned.",
      "His fingers had found another pillow, holding onto it tightly.",
      "\"You feel- You feel incredible!\"",
      "\"So do you,\" Achilles replied, and there was a kiss to the back of his neck.",
      "\"I have not felt such pleasure in centuries.",
      "I did not think I could again.",
      "It is all thanks to you.\"",
      "The two of them moved in sync as they went for another kiss, a deep one that left Zagreus panting again for a short moment, before Achilles claimed another one.",
      "He started to feel a little light headed, but then, suddenly, Achilles started to move.",
      "Slow, shallow thrusts at first, then he felt him almost pull all the way out, just to let Zagreus feel every inch sliding in once more.",
      "The slow pace almost drove him crazy, and he was quite sure that his moans reflected that.",
      "He had gotten loud.",
      "But Achilles did not seem to mind, only pushed in deeper once more until Zagreus could feel his hips against his ass.",
      "This was all of Achilles inside him, and he knew that he would want more of this.",
      "\"I feel so full,\" he blurted out, half moaning it.",
      "\"Please, please can you go a bit faster.",
      "I need- I need-\" The sudden, hard thrust into him caught him by surprise, and he heard Achilles chuckle above him when his yelp turned into a moan.",
      "He pushed back his ass, wanting to feel more, faster, but Achilles held him in place, such a strong hand on the small of his back, pushing him down.",
      "Thinking about that strength of his, knowing just how hard he could hit, how steadily he could hold him down, turned him on even more.",
      "He was an absolute mess.",
      "Achilles thrust into him harder and faster, and with the way he held him down, all Zagreus really could do was take it.",
      "In his pleasure riddled mind he imagined other scenarios, of Achilles fucking him against the wall, displaying that famous strength to anyone who would walk by.",
      "Gods, he felt perverted at the thought.",
      "\"Prince,\" Achilles' voice tore him from those fantasies.",
      "\"You wished to turn around, did you not?\" \"Uh",
      "-",
      "huh,\" was all he managed to bring out, finding it hard to form an entire sentence.",
      "Achilles slowly pulled out of him, and Zagreus gasped at the sensation.",
      "He didn't want to stop, and quickly turned around, spreading his legs wide so that Achilles could settle between them again.",
      "Now he finally saw him again in all his glory.",
      "His long hair was dishevelled, his lips slightly parted although there was no rise or fall of his chest.",
      "His cock was hard, pointing at him, the oil making it glisten.",
      "Zagreus felt other urges, to touch and lick but he also wanted him inside again.",
      "Good thing they had all the time in the world.",
      "\"You're-,\" the both started at the same time, then stopped abruptly to grin at each other.",
      "\"You're too far away,\" Zagreus said softly.",
      "\"I had to admire you,\" Achilles replied, but quickly closed the distance between them again.",
      "As they kissed, Zagreus felt his cock press against his own, much bigger as he now realised.",
      "Not that he minded.",
      "\"I love you,\" he whispered against his lips.",
      "\"Love me, Achilles.",
      "Show me.\"",
      "Achilles pushed inside him easily now, and Zagreus arched his back at the new sensation, the pleasure rocking through his entire body once more.",
      "Achilles did show him then, with his kisses, gentle but possessive, the marks he left on Zagreus' neck, the light and sweet pain that came along with them, and the way he made love to him.",
      "He liked this much better, being able to look at Achilles, touch him, kiss him.",
      "His cheeks were a little flushed, and Achilles pressed kisses to them.",
      "\"May I come inside?,\" Achilles asked, leaning in to whisper it into his ear, then kissed the spot just below it.",
      "For some reason, it felt damn good to Zagreus.",
      "When he moaned, Achilles kept kissing that spot, letting his teeth drag over the skin there, and Zagreus' pleasure threatened to overwhelm him.",
      "\"Yes, yes please,\" he blurted out between moans.",
      "His fingers were digging into Achilles' shoulders, but he didn't give a sign that this bothered him.",
      "\"I think- I think I'm gonna come.\"",
      "He said this just as Achilles kissed him again, stealing his breath while still thrusting into him.",
      "As Achilles pushed the kiss to be deeper, more intense, and he started to feel light headed again, his cock hit that particular spot inside him.",
      "Suddenly that red hot pleasure overwhelmed his senses and everything - his own come hitting his chest, Achilles coming inside him - became one confusing, overwhelming and beautiful swirl.",
      "Finally, Achilles let him go, moans and catching his breath fought for one another, and he whimpered, drawing in that precious air.",
      "His vision needed a moment to clear again, and he was greeted with that lovely smile.",
      "Still feeling a little overwhelmed, he nevertheless returned it.",
      "Achilles was still inside him, and he didn't want him to pull out.",
      "He drew him closer, into a hug, one that Achilles eagerly returned.",
      "Rolling on their sides, Zagreus was held this way, still resenting the loss somewhat when Achilles did finally pull out.",
      "\"Thank you, Achilles,\" he mumbled, feeling so content in this warm afterglow.",
      "Right now, he didn't want to be anywhere else.",
      "\"I should be thanking you,\" Achilles replied, and he pulled back a little so Zagreus could see his lovely face.",
      "He reached out to trace Achilles' lips.",
      "\"Why?\" \"Why?",
      "With you, young prince, death is not so bad.\"",
      "Grinning, the two kissed again, settling in Zagreus' big bed to not go anywhere for a while.",
      "The world above, it could wait.",
      "Surely it would not be bad thing to take what good he could find in the House of Hades."

    "text": "Water hung in the air in a fine mist, turning the landscape into a hazy forest of shadows. The leaves fell in lazy spirals to the forest floor, mottled green and brown and red, on the bed of needles that covered the dirt. It was rocky dirt. Not good for planting. Of course, nobody farmed this land. It was cursed, the locals said, keeping their voices low and casting nervous glances towards the craggy mountain peaks, as if afraid of what they might call down by speaking its name too loudly. He'd heard the stories, of course. They'd traveled as far as Phocis, to the bed he'd slept in as a child, to his mother's whispered tales on nights he was deemed old enough to hear. Some monster dwelt in Delphi, she told him, some horror beyond comprehension. People only went there in times of direst need, and if they returned, they didn't come back the same. Years later, his father told him the truth of things - the oracle at Delphi was divine, chosen by the god Apollo to speak his truth on Earth, only to be consulted at his own risk. Hearing the truth, Pylades couldn't help finding he preferred his mother's version of things, and supposed he'd always been more her son. They even looked the same, the same dark, curling hair, the same pointed nose and dark complexion and questioning eyes. Maybe that was why his father couldn't look him in the eye anymore. Maybe the reminder was too much for him, now that she was gone. She'd died when he was nearly ten, in childbirth with what should have been his younger brother. He'd watched from the doorway, too terrified to come in and say a proper goodbye, even when she reached out for him, face twisted in pain, a sheen of sweat on her forehead. The day after they finished the burial rites for mother and child, the boy from Argos arrived. *** He stopped midday to rest. The trees and the mist provided some respite from the mist, but it was still sweltering, and the climb up the mountain was grueling. Every joint ached, the sensation like a bell ringing against his skull, every wave of it echoing and reverberating down through his bones. Why had he thought this was a good idea, again? Any of this? He took a long gulp of water from the skin and closed his eyes against the sun, tipping his face up to it. He'd done this because it was his fault. That was why. He was here because he'd pushed, and now the gods were out for blood, and if he didn't try to fix it, nobody would. So he had to keep going, keep climbing this interminable mountain, no matter how much he didn't want to. In the end, his goals were simple enough. Find the oracle. Beg for help. Pray it didn't see fit to kill him on the spot. Chase the rumors all the way back to Phocis if he had to. Try to find a way to make things alright again. Put like that, it didn't seem undoable. The only food left at the bottom of the bag was a stale crust of bread, hard and starting to mold. He considered it for a moment, then flicked it onto the ground. There. A sacrifice for Apollo. There was a part of him that hoped the god would see fit to choke on it. *** The boy from Argos was quiet, always looking down at his sandals instead of whoever was speaking to him. Pylades supposed he had a right to be suspicious of them. His father hadn't told him why this boy was here, but earlier in the day, sitting outside the washroom with a book, he'd overheard the women talking. \"Terrible, isn't it?\" That was Alcestis, the oldest of them. Her back was hunched, her knuckles always swollen and her hands red with the sting of soap day in and out. But she was kind, he knew. After his mother's death, she'd washed the bodies for the funeral rites even when no one had asked her to. \"I can't imagine - a woman like that, killing her own husband?\" His ears perk up, and he looks up from the book just as Nephele's tinkling laughter fills the room. She snorts, the indelicacy of the sound miles away from the coquettish looks she'd worn when the soldiers from Ithaca had been here, looking for tribute. Hunting for a husband, his father had said. By all appearances, she hadn't managed to catch one. \"Can't you? With a husband like that? He was here last year, you know. He tried to take me to his bed with a wife waiting for him at home.\" Her voice softens, and he has to strain to hear. \"And after what he did to their daughter -\" \"You shouldn't speak of such things -\" \"What if she comes back to take her son back? They say he favors his father -\" \"Hush, Nephele.\" Alcestis's voice is sharp. \"Work, for once. It might do you good.\" *** The air got cooler the farther he got up the mountain. The sword knocked against his knee with every step, until he gave up and strapped it to his back instead. More unwieldy if it came to a fight, but really, it wasn't as if having it within easier reach might improve his odds all that much. He'd trained to fight, like any firstborn son. No one could say his father hadn't tried to make a hero out of him. Besides, Orestes was always much better at those kinds of things. He could take care of it. Once he found him. If he found him. *** No one could say his father didn't try to do his best for the son of his friend. The king of Argos was gone to Troy to fight, along with every other ruler worth his salt. As far as Pylades could see, the only reason his father didn't go with was to keep an eye on this boy. Or maybe he was just a coward. Maybe that was it. They shared a tutor for months before they every spoke to one another. His name was Orestes. They were of an age, and he was maddeningly, infuriatingly quiet. The most Pylades ever heard of him was low hum of his voice as he answered the tutor's questions in a whisper. He'd catch Orestes watching, sometimes. Never when he'd think anyone would be paying attention. Across the room at the table for a moment, before he'd cast his eyes down to his plate. At the river, flicking stones into the water. In the orchard, once, from below, while he was sneaking figs from his father's trees. *** The sun was setting when he made it to the mouth of the cave, casting long shadows. It had cooled considerably, the unbearable humidity thickening back into mist that swathed the darkness inside. The cold dampness of it prickled at his skin, and he couldn't suppress a shiver. Whoever lived here certainly seemed to have a flair for the dramatic. Who seeks the oracle? The voice slithered into his ear as he took the first step into the cave. Somehow, it battered against the inside of his skull, painful and overwhelming. All the stories rushed back into his mind, travelers returning home after consulting the oracle and killing their families, prophecies gone terribly wrong, a man who had ignored the oracle's words and ended up committing unspeakable crimes before gouging out his own eyes. Who was to say that this would work at all? But there was no turning back now, because somewhere out there, Orestes needed to be found. There was no turning back because if it was him, he was sure Orestes wouldn't even think twice. He took a deep breath. \"I'm not seeking the oracle,\" he said. In the gloom, his own voice sounded - not small. Calm. Just human. \"I'm just asking for directions.\" *** His father's land wasn't renowned for its warriors, which was something that could have brought them fame, or cunning, or even good musicians. What they had instead were figs, some of the best figs in the world. Traders flocked to their island every fall, their boats filled with wares, and during those few weeks, the streets and farmlands were bustling and colorful. The weeks before harvest were much quieter. If you were looking to steal some of the early ones, that was the best time to do it. At the age of fourteen, frustrated with the sword, and wanting things he couldn't have, looking for trouble seemed like the best solution. The younger trees had the sweetest fruit. The older they got, the tougher the figs were, but the easier they were to climb. Higher risk, sweeter reward. And he'd always been a good climber. Falling was a surprise, and so was the sudden, painful crunch in his arm. It cracked against a rock, the pain white hot and choking off his throat so he couldn't breathe, couldn't move, couldn't speak. The orchard wasn't far from the house, but it could be hours before anyone thought to look at all, before anyone even noticed his absence, and it was getting to be dusk. Wide gray eyes stared down at him. Orestes was holding a fig in his hand, he noticed. He lifted it and bit into it like he wasn't sure what else to do with his hands. The juice stained his fingertips dark purple, tinted his mouth a little darker. \"Can you stand?\" Pylades stared up at him, the pain buzzing in his ears. The question didn't make sense, but he tried anyway, managing to sit up at least before his eyes started clouding with dark spots. \"I don't think so.\" He held out his hand, warm and a little sticky, and hauled Pylades to his feet, and they made their way back together, slow and unsteady, holding tight like children, like the last time they'd known fear. *** He follows the oracle's instructions towards the swamps on Phocis. The familiar landscape feels right, and on the high cliffs, he can see the rough edges of the stone battlements. His father's idea. What reason was there to attack a place like this? The whole island was desolate, apart from the orchards. South, the oracle had said. So he went south. South took him towards the most deserted part of the island, the pine forests. There, the trees were thick and old, taller than anything he'd ever seen. As he walked, listening for telltale snaps in the underbrush, he tried to estimate how many people it would take, arms outstretched, to span the base. Three, possibly, and maybe more. He has to be getting closer. If he goes much farther, he'll reach the other end of the island, the orchard. The orchard. He runs the whole way. *** He remembers the day things went bad with perfect clarity, considering it was nearly a month ago now. He'd been walking out towards the fields - figs were good enough for import, but you couldn't expect a whole population to live on them year round, and he was going to have to know these things one day if he wanted to be any kind of king. Orestes hurried towards him, a wild look in his eyes, clearly close to bubbling over about something. \"Pylades! It's Apollo! He wants me to--\" He stopped short in front of him, taking a few gasping breaths. Had he run here? \"What is it? What does he want?\" He kept his eyes on the book, voice dry. It had to be a joke, didn't it? The gods didn't just tell boys like them what to do, hand out divine decrees like they were commonplace. He thought of Orestes' family, of Agamemnon, dead for years now, of the curse on that family, now only spoken of in hushed rumor, and felt sick to his stomach. Divine decrees might not happen to boys like him, but Orestes was a different breed altogether. Families like that had divinity running through their veins, and that never came without pain. But it was a joke. It had to be. He wasn't going to let himself think anything else of it. Orestes took a deep breath. \"He wants me to kill my mother.\" *** It hasn't been long since they've been away. A month, maybe. Still, returning to the orchard has the sickly feeling of inevitability he experiences whenever he picks up a sword. No matter how hard he tries, it's not going to sit right in his hands. Some things, he just isn't made for. The trees are overgrown and unattended, the figs, overripe, falling from the branches and creating a sticky layer of mulch under his feet. The whole place smells of decay, saccharine sweet and oozing into his mouth. Underneath that is the iron tang of blood, so that's what he follows. They're steeped in blood, both of them, and it's his fault, his fault, his. The tree. It's still there, the figs just starting to ripen, like a blessing. Like an omen. Pylades hurries forward, follows the scent of blood straight to him. There's blood all over, crusting and grimy on his hands, smeared across his face. More blood than the last time he saw him, when Orestes had spit his mother's body on the end of a sword in his father's house, looking more like a frightened child than the last of the family of heroes he's supposed to have become. Clytemnestra had fallen, body sprawling against the tiles, now slick with her blood. The blood was everywhere, painting them both red. Then the humming had started, a buzzing that seemed to come from nowhere. Orestes dropped the sword, hair whipping in an invisible wind, eyes focused on something only he could see. His voice broke on a high, keening scream, and then, just as suddenly he was gone, out the door and into the night. Pylades felt them more than saw them, heard the raspy drag of a tail across the floor, felt something like talons scratch across the back of his neck. He knew enough to know what they were, and not to look. Furies. Bringers of vengeance. Murder, matricide - those were the kinds of things they dealt in. And like a fool, he'd thought Orestes would be protected, thought that Apollo would see to it that they came through alright. It's his fault, all of this. He pushed. When Orestes faltered, when he hesitated, Pylades had been right there, telling him that it had to be done, that his mother's death was nothing less than what the gods were demanding. It had been an impossible choice, and between the gods to repay and the unknown terrors to come if Apollo were disobeyed, he'd urged the former. Of course he had. Whatever horrors would be visited on them later were nothing to the threat of Apollo's fury. He hadn't thought it could get so bad. He hadn't known how bad it would get until getting here. Orestes looked up, blood-smeared hands shaking. He looked frail, skeletal. Like a man bracing for the end. His eyes were wide and wild. For a moment, he thought there was nothing human in there at all. Carefully, hesitantly, he crouched in front of Orestes. Moved a strand of blood-crusted hair out of his face. \"I didn't think you were coming.\" His voice was raw. Pylades paused. Swallowed. \"I was looking for you.\" This might have been his fault, but that didn't mean he was going to stop trying now. He owed them better than that. He knew the stories, knew what happened to people the gods want for their own. There's no happy ending for them. Orestes met his eyes, smiled that crooked smile he'd been half in love with since the age of fourteen. \"You found me.\" If he can, he'll make sure they get a better ending.",

    "text": "Narcissus' face was way too pink for someone who had dark brown skin. \"Look\", he said. Icarus tried not to sigh as he filled a bowl with water and reached up in a cupboard for a cloth. \"I know I'm sick.\" \"An astounding conclusion.\" \"And I also know you're the kind of asshole who will blame yourself for it.\" \"Amazing, really.\" \"So could you do both of us a favor and wait until I feel better before you start to shut me out? Thanks.\" He accepted the wet cloth with a relieved sigh and let it drop on his forehead. A drop of water trailed down his face. \"I won't shut you out.\" Icarus racked his brain for which symptoms of magical exhaustion induced sickness he hadn't addressed yet. Fever, okay, he was already working on it, weakness- that's why he had made Narcissus lie down on the couch... \"Says you.\" \"Yeah. Says me. The person you talked to. Who else would have said it?\" \"I was rather hoping for a little less of sarcasm while I'm sick. Be nice to me, sunshine.\" \"Call me sunshine one more time and I swear to Persephone, Dandelion-\" \"Alright, alright. Shutting up, angel.\" Icarus' expression softened. He leaned over the counter and over the back of their couch to check Narcissus' temperature by pressing his hand against the heated cheek. \"You're still feverish. Flor, I'm gonna try and see if I find some of the medication you keep here.\" \"Cabinet in the bathroom, in a small red box.\" \"Right, thanks.\" It was there. It always was- Narcissus was pretty particular about easy access to medication and first aid kit. Justified, considering how often Icarus got himself in fights. He flexed his hands, feeling the pull and soreness of his bruised knuckles, and came back with a pill and a cup of water. Narcissus still seemed too weak to sit alone, so Icarus put an arm around his back to help him sit up. The boy was really warm. \"Thanks\", Narcissus croaked again, giving the cup back. Icarus set it on the floor and kicked his own socks out, sitting in the couch. \"No problem. Next time I tell you to slow down, though, you gotta listen. This happens more often than it should.\" Narcissus grimaced. He didn't need a reminder. It wasn't that he was naturally a careless person, he just tended to use up too much magic by healing Icarus' battle wounds instead of doing the sensible thing- aka, dragging him to the medical wing and letting Healer Auburn, an adult who had actually finished her education and had her magic stabilized with age, have a go at it. It wouldn't be to bad if he wasn't studying both Magical Healing and Warding at the University, both courses being magically exhausting even without extra work. It was kind of fun to see Icarus that worried, though. He was usually pretty good at hiding it. \"Aw, but that would mean you wouldn't have a chance to become a mother hen around my sick self\", he grinned. \"Mom would be proud.\" \"Mom would smack you over the head with a ruler if I told her.\" He said with a serious expression. \"She'd never.\" \"No\", Icarus admitted. \"But she'd want to, and I'd be right by her side with that. By the way, hope you're happy, I'm gonna have to call her this week since your croaky voice would just worry her, you dumbass.\" \"She misses you too. It's been, what, four, five years since she basically adopted you-\" \"She did not-\", Icarus groaned. That was a very old fight. The fact that there hadn't been any legal change of custody didn't seem to stop Narcissus, and it was unlikely that it ever would. \"-And you became her favorite child-\" \"Floxglove, I swear to Persephone-\" \"You can't just make her deal with me all the time. She likes to bond with you over... I don't know, what do you even bond over?\" Icarus sighed and looked away as Narcissus gave him a shit-eating grin. How could such an irritating human being come from that woman? \"Knitting. Being done with you. Worrying. Brazilian soap operas.\" \"You're a softie, angel.\" \"My knuckles are literally still bruised from when I sent that transphobe little fucker to the medical wing.\" \"You exclusively wear pastel colors.\" \"And black\", Icarus felt the need to defend himself. \"It's pastel punk. Look it up, bitch.\" \"Oh yeah, I forgot. You have a ear piercing and everything. Soooo scary\", Narcissus snickered, resting his head on Icarus' shoulder. \"How ever will I be able to sleep tonight.\" \"Clinging to me, if we look at past evidence.\" \"The past is in the past.\" \"Wow. Really? I'm shocked.\" Icarus deadpanned, slipping an arm around Narcissus shoulders and making himself comfortable in the couch. \"Have you ever considered writing a book about your pearls of wisdom?\" \"Stop bullying me, I'm sick.\" \"If I couldn't tease you whenever your own stupidity made you sick, I'd never- okay, that's a bit of an exaggeration, but still, I'm starting to think you're doing it to get my attention.\" \"Oh, geez\", Narcissus mumbled against Icarus' shoulder. \"You got me. The fever is a trap. You're stuck being nice to your best friend. What a sick plan.\" \"Sick plan\", Icarus snickered. \"I will actually kill you.\" \"Nah. You know damn well your mom would avenge me if you did\", he grinned, pressing his forehead against his friend's. Narcissus still felt warmer than he should, but his temperature seemed to be slowly getting lower. \"And I have an army of allies too.\" \"Please just say they're your friends.\" \"I mean, I have like, three friends, the rest is just in so that I can punch their enemies.\" \"Ariadne, Sam, Aracne\", Narcissus counted and raised a brow. \"And who am I, you idiot?' \"You obviously don't count, you're my best friend.\" \"... I should count more than anyone else\", he said offended. Icarus laughed. \"Alright, don't be jealous.\" \"I am not.\" \"Suuuure.\"",

    "text": "Shall I tell you a story, child? Your Mamae will be gone for some time. Let me tell you a tale that you may not recognise. Once upon a time there were two lovers. They lived with not much, but what they had, they cherished. It was a time of Spring and when they were laid down, one would weave those spring flowers in the others hair. Our pair was called Bucky and Steve, and their Spring was before the War. They would work and fight and live and laugh and flirt and scream and cry like humans, but these two, this fated pair were meant for more than just one mortal life, as you shall see. Steve was small and sickly, for it takes time to birth a godly form and his body was not ready; but what he lacked in stature, he made up for in ichorious spirit: bright and bold and too big for his boots, Steve could let no injustice pass him without relentless inspection, and more often than not he found them wanting by his fists. He was a vision in red streaks and rasping lungs. He was beautiful and Bucky loved him.Bucky was a true spring child, adored by all, happy and hardworking and charm enough for any situation he could find. He was a popularity contest and a poster child, he was The Boy, and Steve loved him. Then came the war. The dogs of war came thundering, and Bucky was swept up in their call. It did not take long for Steve to shed the last of his mortal skin and catch up, but by then, the sword had lost its shine, and Bucky, the spring child had not smiles enough, only shouldered glances and bitter tears.But, I hear you cry, they still had each other, no? What is war, to a pair of lovers reunited? All true, I say. They were together, even Aphrodite herself could not drive a wedge between our pair in fierce spirit and painted lips, no, they had each other and their war band and they were glorious.But not for long. When they excel, the gods take notice, and one particular god had his eyes firmly stuck to fair bucky's visage. It did not take long before he had to steal bucky away down to his bower in the earth. Bucky screamed as it happened, arms reaching for his pair, who watched in anguish as his bucky was stolen from him, disappearing down below. For steve, and for bucky, nothing would ever be the same again, and whilst Steve set his war band roaming, and took down War with his red face and screaming hands, Bucky dreamed of summer days and seeds of red fruit. And all was Winter and all was ice. It was Hephaistos that caught Steve a-slumber in the end. It was Zeus's thunder that shocked him back to this autumn-land with no pair and no hope, a new war band and no War to wage.It was Artemis's arrows that made him weep with familiarity. It was Hestia, green and large, but also pink and small, who talked to him of home. But none of this could give Steve what he needed. It wasn't until Hermes came to his door that the Fate's wheel turned and Spring returned.Bucky had eaten the seeds, drunk of Lethe and knew nothing of his pair, nothing but that of the ache in his soul every time Hades bid him out into the world. It was red-haired Athena who spoke to Steve of his pair's new form, and it was winged Hermes who helped Steve recover him whilst Olympus burned around them. For Hades and Zeus were mirrors of the same, it was discovered, and one could not trust either to be true to themselves.So it was not with the explosion of life or death that the pair became again, but with the slow thaw, and heat of puffed cheeks, and that, my little flower, is a tale all of its own.",

    "text": "Spring Her first day back into the world, the air is exactly the way it should be - cold and alive. It will change soon. Spring will turn it chilly, summer warm, warmer, suffocating, like a tedious lover's embrace. And then it will be fall again. Persephone doesn't just know the cycle of the seasons, she feels it, deep down in her gut. In her bones. How could she not? She's been observing it all since before mankind even had a word for \"spring\". Back when the only two seasons were the one she spent with her lover, and the one she spent missing him. And even later, much later, when the clusters hung ripe and heavy from the grapevine and Persephone's heart grew heavier still at the sight, because she knew her freedom was coming to an end. That it would be six long months of dark loneliness before she could taste the sweet juice of those grapes. She thinks of Hades, careful arms around her as they danced, shy like he hadn't been since that first day in her mother's garden, and wonders if she'll feel the same dread this fall. Her first day back into the world, the air is exactly the way it should be - cold and alive. Everything else is off, though. There is no crowd to welcome her back, no laughter, no wine. No music. She might as well have stepped into the gloom of the deepest day of winter. \"Where is he?\" she asks Hermes, because there's only one mortal whose heartbreak could make even the birds stop singing. Hermes smiles, in that way of his that betrays his sorrow more than tears ever could. \"Where is he, where is he. He's where he always is these days,\" he mutters, and his eyes fly to the railroad like a bird pushed by a wind much stronger than its wings. \"I'm afraid your young protege didn't just lose his heart this past winter. He lost his mind, too.\" Persephone can picture him, bursting with music and life. Campfire light dancing on his skin, his fingers dancing on the lyre's strings. People dancing all around him. She can picture it all perfectly because she's done it so many times, during the winter. It's the only way she can get through it. And now she's lost that too. \"But that's not possible!\" she protests, not really to Hermes but to... she isn't even sure. Her husband. Fate. The frailty of men. \"Oh, it ain't just possible, it's also true,\" Hermes says. \"Go see for yourself if you don't believe me.\" She believes him. That's why she has to go see for herself. He's where he always is these days - right at the mouth of hell. He's dirty, and his clothes are faded. He could almost disappear against the dull gray of the cave. He still has his lyre. That's what Persephone finds most striking for some reason. After coming home to deafening silence, after Hermes' words, she thought for sure the lyre had been destroyed. Or retired, at least, left in a forgotten corner of the house with only dust to cover its strings. Instead it's at its usual place against the player's chest, and it sings under his touch. It was foolish of her to think that way. Orpheus couldn't throw his lyre away in a burst of emotion any more than Persephone could cut off her own leg. His music is a part of him - but as such, it changes with him. Where it was bold, now it's rueful. Where it was lively, it's mournful. It doesn't flicker like flames, doesn't surge like the sunrise. It grieves, and it grieves, and nothing else. \"I don't know why,\" Persephone says, \"but I was expecting this place to be the same.\" Orpheus keeps playing, keeps staring into the depths of the cave. Is he thinking of Eurydice's embrace, forever lost in the darkness ahead of him? Or of her last desperate breath, the way it reverberated across the stones so they could hear it all the way to Hadestown? A smile brushes his lips. Like Hermes', it speaks of sorrow and loss. Unlike Hermes', it doesn't try to hide any of it. \"Even after everything?\" he asks. \"Yes,\" she admits. That's the way her world works - no endings without new beginnings. Endless sorrow tangled with endless joy. She doesn't know what to make of this mortal suffering, of the way it cripples even the strongest of men and never promises to heal. Maybe if she were Orpheus she'd try to understand it with a song. A rhythm so intoxicating that you'd wish to dance to it forever. A melody so complicated that no poet could ever play it to the end. But she is not Orpheus, she doesn't understand anything about music other than the way it makes her feel alive like only love and wine can. It dawns on her that there is no reason why it should be this way. \"Will you teach me?\" Orpheus looks at her - the first time since she came to find him - and he doesn't understand. Persephone's hand finds a soft place to land on the strings of his lyre, and for a moment the music dies. Everything around them is silence. Silence and the wind - a song of loneliness. \"Teach me how to play,\" she says. The first thing Persephone learns about music is that it is hard work. She feels almost betrayed by the realization. She's seen hard work, down in Hades, and it always comes with sweat and quick tempers. It's dirty, and messy, and all-consuming, and it twists humans into a blasphemy of themselves, worn out creatures that follow the cycle of their own seasons - work and sleep and work and sleep. And she's seen Orpheus play, drunk out of his mind and tired after a long summer day, and still wanting to play more, and not getting a single chord wrong. She's seen him give his music to old wanderers and pretty girls, to raucous drunks and hardened kings, and never ask for anything in return but that they should sing along with him. How could she imagine that it takes as much work to play his notes as it does to keep Hades' cursed machinery working in the Underworld? Orpheus laughs when she tells him - the first time since last winter. \"The difference,\" he explains, \"is that this is worth the labor.\" And Persephone knows he's right. She can feel it, deep and instinctive as she feels the seasons changing, and with no practice at all this time. She thought she loved music before, and she did in a way, but with every hesitant chord that comes out right, with every beautiful sound that she brings to life only with her hands and effort, she learns that the love she knew was only a muddy pool and there's a whole deep ocean out there. It's as if she'd been admiring a breathtaking painting for years, and suddenly realized she can step in it. Flowers bloom, the days grow longer and warmer, and Persephone and Orpheus play and play and they don't talk about the winter. She gets better, and so does he. At least Persephone thinks so. He starts bathing again, in a meander of the river just behind the cave. He lets Persephone bring him fresh clothes. And sometimes, sometimes when they're playing he forgets his sorrow for a moment, and his fingers run wild on the lyre's strings, horses capering in the fields after the first snowfall. Then he remembers he isn't supposed to ever be happy again, and he reins them in. Every day someone comes from the town and leaves a basket for the poet - bread, wine and cheese. \"They've been doing it all spring,\" Orpheus says when Persephone asks him about it. \"They still take care of me. Even though I have no more songs to gift them.\" Persephone thinks of Hadestown, of the way the workers have to earn their bread and cot with every second of their eternity, and her heart aches with pride. \"That's how life should be,\" she says, and they toast. Summer \"Let's write a new song,\" Persephone says. They're in Orpheus' old home - or his house, at least. He moved back a few days ago without telling anyone why. Maybe he felt bad about forcing the villagers to walk all the way to the mouth of hell and back every day just so he wouldn't starve. Maybe he can't see the shape of his lover in the darkness of the cave anymore, and he went to look for it in the bed they once shared. Either way, they're in Orpheus' old house, and it's pouring outside, the wind strong and warm and carrying the scent of summer and life, and Persephone opened the window so she could feel it and she felt like writing a brand new song. But Orpheus shakes his head. \"You should do it. I have nothing left to write about.\" Persephone looks out the window, at the trees shaking in the wind like they're at the party of a lifetime, and tries not to admit how annoyed she is. \"You know, just because she isn't here it doesn't mean she never existed.\" He comes to sit with her by the window. Hair ruffled by the wind, little drops of rain sprinkling his cheeks. He hasn't looked so delicately human since he turned around that winter day. \"Do you like the rain?\" he asks. Persephone thinks about it. \"I don't like getting my clothes all wet and sticky and cold.\" \"That's not what I asked.\" \"Yes,\" she says. \"I love the rain.\" Its scent, its music. The way it changes the world around it - nourishing. Destroying. Making life possible again and again. The way it makes Persephone feel, like the world is bigger and more magical than even a goddess could ever fathom. Like it's okay to feel a little sad sometimes. The way it makes her heart long for something and doesn't bother to tell her what it is. The way it makes her hair, her clothes all wet and sticky and cold. All of it, she loves all of it. \"Do you think it would still rain if there was no life on earth?\" Orpheus asks after a while. \"I think so,\" Persephone says. \"But it wouldn't be the same.\" \"I feel the same about my music,\" he admits. \"Without her it's not the same.\" The storm is dying down, the wild impetus of the rain fading to a pizzicato cadence. \"Does it have to be the same?\" Persephone asks. \"Maybe it's like the seasons. Maybe some things are meant to change.\" \"Not this one,\" Orpheus says. They don't play any more songs that day. She starts playing for the village folk, the way he used to. Well, not the same way - she might be a goddess, and she might be practicing a lot, but she knows she will never understand music the way Orpheus does. She will never write songs that melt the hearts of kings and make flowers bloom in the dead of winter. Seeing how that ended, maybe it's for the best. But she plays for the village folk, and while it's not like it used to be, it brings back music and laughter. It's the blazing days of the second half of summer, when the world feels like a dream and life seems kinder and mortals dare to hope in spite of it all. There's wine and campfires, and Persephone plays Orpheus' old songs and some new ones, and they drink and they dance. It's not like it used to be, but it's the closest it's ever been. And maybe seasons are the same, and Persephone just didn't notice. Maybe their endless cycle doesn't mean that things never change, it just highlights when they do. She isn't sure she likes this theory better. Orpheus never joins in. Doesn't sing, doesn't play, doesn't dance, doesn't even listen. Doesn't come out of the house at all, in fact. His fellow mortals have given up on him. They still bring him food, and cheer louder, toast more tearfully, when Persephone plays his songs, but they don't try to change his mind anymore. It feels disrespectful to his grief, they say. Persephone thinks it's bullshit. What's it to Eurydice if he spends the rest of his life hiding from the world? She isn't here, she can't see him laughing and living without her. She can't get her heart broken by him again. \"You're taking away the only chance she has to be in the world again,\" Persephone tells him, and he flinches, because he's done that before and he's still paying the price. \"That's not fair,\" he says. \"It's true.\" \"Music won't bring her back.\" \"I know,\" Persephone says. \"But at least it won't let her die a second time.\" \"Do you think I don't want to sing about her? That I wouldn't do anything to make her immortal with my words?\" Orpheus' voice trembles, delicate and stubborn like a petal that won't let the wind tear it from its string. \"I can't. I tried.\" And Persephone is a goddess, immortal and powerful, and she's never been afraid, not even when Hades brought her down to the Underworld for the first time and she saw it all, the monstrous hound and the river of stones and the desperate, lonely souls, but she's terrified when she asks: \"Is this it, then? No more new songs?\" \"No more new songs,\" Orpheus confirms. Something breaks inside her, and Persephone storms out of the house. She thinks she finally understands grief. She plays for the villagers that night, like she's always done this summer. But for the first time they seem too loud, too carefree. For the first time she doesn't feel like playing the kind of music they feel like listening to. So she promises that she will play more tomorrow, and sends them on their way. There's an aching inside her that she's never felt before. It's a little like love but stronger, sadder, and more beautiful because of it. Persephone hates it. It's longing and loss at the same time. The really heartbreaking part is that she doesn't know how to put it into music. She tries. All night she sits around the smoky remnants of the campfire and sings and plays without an audience. She sings of spring and wine, of music, of Orpheus. Of Eurydice and snakes. Of hard choices and tears. Of her mother. Of her husband. Of birds and stars and the winter. It's not enough. Maybe Orpheus was right, maybe all the music in the world can't bring back what you love. Not when the love was so familiar, so intimate that every attempt at recapturing it only feels like a violence to its memory. She sings about that. She sings her apology to Orpheus, because she didn't get it but she gets it now - every new spring is just a reminder of the ones you lost, and just because there are fresh leaves on the trees it doesn't mean that last year's aren't rotting in the ground. Because Persephone can play his songs but they mean something completely different to her than they did to him. She's all but tearing up when she finishes, and she hugs her lyre close for comfort. A hand snakes around her shoulders and pulls her close, her head resting against a heartbeat. She thinks Orpheus is crying. \"You were right,\" he says after a while. She looks at him, and yes, even in the darkness his eyes are red with sorrow. \"Didn't you hear the song? I wasn't right. You were.\" Gently, Orpheus takes the lyre from Persephone's hands and plays a chord on it. A new one. \"I can't write songs about Eurydice,\" he says, \"but I can write songs for her. The way you sang this one for me.\" \"I didn't know you were listening.\" Orpheus laughs, embarrassed. \"Who were you singing it for, then?\" Persephone thinks about it. \"... you.\" Who else? They both laugh this time. \"I can play them to her,\" Persephone says. \"All the songs you write. We can't bring her back here, but I can bring your words down there.\" Orpheus hugs her, tighter than he ever has before, and for the first time since he came back from Hades he feels like himself again.",

      "But Orpheus shakes his head.",
      "\"You should do it.",
      "I have nothing left to write about.\"",
      "Persephone looks out the window, at the trees shaking in the wind like they're at the party of a lifetime, and tries not to admit how annoyed she is.",
      "\"You know, just because she isn't here it doesn't mean she never existed.\"",
      "He comes to sit with her by the window.",
      "Hair ruffled by the wind, little drops of rain sprinkling his cheeks.",
      "He hasn't looked so delicately human since he turned around that winter day.",
      "\"Do you like the rain?\" he asks.",
      "Persephone thinks about it.",

      "\"That's not what I asked.\"",
      "\"Yes,\" she says.",
      "\"I love the rain.\"",
      "Its scent, its music.",
      "The way it changes the world around it - nourishing.",
      "Destroying.",
      "Making life possible again and again.",
      "The way it makes Persephone feel, like the world is bigger and more magical than even a goddess could ever fathom.",
      "Like it's okay to feel a little sad sometimes.",
      "The way it makes her heart long for something and doesn't bother to tell her what it is.",
      "The way it makes her hair, her clothes all wet and sticky and cold.",
      "All of it, she loves all of it.",
      "\"Do you think it would still rain if there was no life on earth?\" Orpheus asks after a while.",
      "\"I think so,\" Persephone says.",
      "\"But it wouldn't be the same.\"",
      "\"I feel the same about my music,\" he admits.",
      "\"Without her it's not the same.\"",
      "The storm is dying down, the wild impetus of the rain fading to a pizzicato cadence.",
      "\"Does it have to be the same?\" Persephone asks.",
      "\"Maybe it's like the seasons.",
      "Maybe some things are meant to change.\"",
      "\"Not this one,\" Orpheus says.",
      "They don't play any more songs that day.",
      "She starts playing for the village folk, the way he used to.",
      "Well, not the same way - she might be a goddess, and she might be practicing a lot, but she knows she will never understand music the way Orpheus does.",
      "She will never write songs that melt the hearts of kings and make flowers bloom in the dead of winter.",
      "Seeing how that ended, maybe it's for the best.",
      "But she plays for the village folk, and while it's not like it used to be, it brings back music and laughter.",
      "It's the blazing days of the second half of summer, when the world feels like a dream and life seems kinder and mortals dare to hope in spite of it all.",
      "There's wine and campfires, and Persephone plays Orpheus' old songs and some new ones, and they drink and they dance.",
      "It's not like it used to be, but it's the closest it's ever been.",
      "And maybe seasons are the same, and Persephone just didn't notice.",
      "Maybe their endless cycle doesn't mean that things never change, it just highlights when they do.",
      "She isn't sure she likes this theory better.",
      "Orpheus never joins in.",
      "Doesn't sing, doesn't play, doesn't dance, doesn't even listen.",
      "Doesn't come out of the house at all, in fact.",
      "His fellow mortals have given up on him.",
      "They still bring him food, and cheer louder, toast more tearfully, when Persephone plays his songs, but they don't try to change his mind anymore.",
      "It feels disrespectful to his grief, they say.",
      "Persephone thinks it's bullshit.",
      "What's it to Eurydice if he spends the rest of his life hiding from the world?",
      "She isn't here, she can't see him laughing and living without her.",
      "She can't get her heart broken by him again.",
      "\"You're taking away the only chance she has to be in the world again,\" Persephone tells him, and he flinches, because he's done that before and he's still paying the price.",
      "\"That's not fair,\" he says.",
      "\"It's true.\"",
      "\"Music won't bring her back.\"",
      "\"I know,\" Persephone says.",
      "\"But at least it won't let her die a second time.\"",
      "\"Do you think I don't want to sing about her?",
      "That I wouldn't do anything to make her immortal with my words?\" Orpheus' voice trembles, delicate and stubborn like a petal that won't let the wind tear it from its string.",
      "\"I can't.",
      "I tried.\"",
      "And Persephone is a goddess, immortal and powerful, and she's never been afraid, not even when Hades brought her down to the Underworld for the first time and she saw it all, the monstrous hound and the river of stones and the desperate, lonely souls, but she's terrified when she asks: \"Is this it, then?",
      "No more new songs?\"",
      "\"No more new songs,\" Orpheus confirms.",
      "Something breaks inside her, and Persephone storms out of the house.",
      "She thinks she finally understands grief.",
      "She plays for the villagers that night, like she's always done this summer.",
      "But for the first time they seem too loud, too carefree.",
      "For the first time she doesn't feel like playing the kind of music they feel like listening to.",
      "So she promises that she will play more tomorrow, and sends them on their way.",
      "There's an aching inside her that she's never felt before.",
      "It's a little like love but stronger, sadder, and more beautiful because of it.",
      "Persephone hates it.",
      "It's longing and loss at the same time.",
      "The really heartbreaking part is that she doesn't know how to put it into music.",
      "She tries.",
      "All night she sits around the smoky remnants of the campfire and sings and plays without an audience.",
      "She sings of spring and wine, of music, of Orpheus.",
      "Of Eurydice and snakes.",
      "Of hard choices and tears.",
      "Of her mother.",
      "Of her husband.",
      "Of birds and stars and the winter.",
      "It's not enough.",
      "Maybe Orpheus was right, maybe all the music in the world can't bring back what you love.",
      "Not when the love was so familiar, so intimate that every attempt at recapturing it only feels like a violence to its memory.",
      "She sings about that.",
      "She sings her apology to Orpheus, because she didn't get it but she gets it now - every new spring is just a reminder of the ones you lost, and just because there are fresh leaves on the trees it doesn't mean that last year's aren't rotting in the ground.",
      "Because Persephone can play his songs but they mean something completely different to her than they did to him.",
      "She's all but tearing up when she finishes, and she hugs her lyre close for comfort.",
      "A hand snakes around her shoulders and pulls her close, her head resting against a heartbeat.",
      "She thinks Orpheus is crying.",
      "\"You were right,\" he says after a while.",
      "She looks at him, and yes, even in the darkness his eyes are red with sorrow.",
      "\"Didn't you hear the song?",
      "I wasn't right.",
      "You were.\"",
      "Gently, Orpheus takes the lyre from Persephone's hands and plays a chord on it.",
      "A new one.",
      "\"I can't write songs about Eurydice,\" he says, \"but I can write songs for her.",
      "The way you sang this one for me.\"",
      "\"I didn't know you were listening.\"",
      "Orpheus laughs, embarrassed.",
      "\"Who were you singing it for, then?\" Persephone thinks about it.",
      "\"... you.\"",
      "Who else?",
      "They both laugh this time.",
      "\"I can play them to her,\" Persephone says.",
      "\"All the songs you write.",
      "We can't bring her back here, but I can bring your words down there.\"",
      "Orpheus hugs her, tighter than he ever has before, and for the first time since he came back from Hades he feels like himself again."

    "text": "The girl crept into the depths of the cavern, the dark enveloping her like a cloak. She was familiar with the darkness, embraced it like an old friend, although she had never met this particular darkness before. On the surface, she was known only as the young girl, and her only friend had been the night. She knew the night intimately, and it had always welcomed her with open arms. It was the darkness she knew best.Beyond the earth was the void, an endless darkness that encompassed the universe. It was so very large, and also very cold. Even so, she befriended it, for beyond the earth she was also large, though still much smaller than the void. On the surface, she was worshiped as a goddess, but the people did not know that the goddess and the young girl were one and the same. A girl who loved the darkness, and befriended it.This darkness, the one of a separate realm, did not know her. It only sensed the presence of darkness on her, the presence of the night and of the void, and so it responded to her touch. It welcomed her into it's realm. It protected her from suspicious eyes and alerted her of wandering senses. It protected her from the Keeper of Shadows, protecting her until she no longer wanted protection. Her mother was beautiful, tall and brown haired, with a piercing gaze and steady hands. She loved the light, and it loved her as well, helping her with her life's work, giving life to her creations. On the surface, she was referred to as the woman who baked the best bread, or planted the sweetest tomatoes. None thought it strange that she had no name. She had befriended the sunlight, and knew it intimately, and it embraced her. It was the light she loved most.Beyond the earth there was only the light of nebulae and distant stars. It could not help her with her work, and it was to distant from fertile ground, so she could not bear to love it. Even so, she was worshiped, nobody connecting the goddess of harvests to the nameless woman at the farmer's market week after week. A woman who loved the light, and collaborated with it.The girl flowed down the steps and into the realm beneath the earth. The darkness she found there was not the night, nor the void. It was a shadow, the smallest dark she knew, and the easiest to befriend. It was not like the other darks, for it was warm, and happy. The void was apathetic, and the night was gloomy. It also had a keeper, the Keeper of Shadows, a king that lived in its vastness, a king which she was here to meet, a king from which the shadows were protecting her. She met the Keeper of Shadows as a god, and he was kind, and gave her a place to stay when she did not want to be with her mother, and also did not want to be a goddess. She met the Keeper of Shadows as a nameless boy, and they snuck through the night together, the light of nebulae and distant stars shining on his raven dark hair. She met the Keeper of Shadows as something in between, and her heart beat twice the speed.Her mother did not approve of her friendship with the Keeper of Shadows. She dealt in light, but the two children dealt in darkness, in the night, in the void, in the shadows. She did not understand the darkness, for she was not a part of it, and her daughter, who was of the darkness, did not understand the light. But it was her mother, and the girl her daughter, so they loved what they could not understand, and in an effort to make her mother understand, the girl went into the realm of shadows, and she made a promise.Her mother did not understand.She had eaten a part of a pomegranate, a fruit of the darkness, a fruit with blood red juice and seeds like rubies. She had eaten, and had promised the Keeper of Shadows that she would stay. And besides, she had really always loved the taste of pomegranate. Her mother was, understandably, furious. She went to the girl's father, who went to his sister, who was also the mother's sister. The sister was very wise, and she saw the fury of the mother who wished only to protect her daughter from what she did not understand. She saw the love of the girl for the Keeper of Shadows, and her wish for her mother to accept even where she could not understand. She saw the incapability for the mother to accept. She could not make a decision, and the mother was furious beyond reason, and the father was an idiot whose only good choice was coming to her for help, so she went to the girl.She presented the girl with two choices. The first was to go with the Keeper of Shadows and never see her mother again, knowing that she would never accept her choices but also knowing that the world would know the truth. She pondered, waited, and talked things out with the boy that she loved. She came back to the sister, and chose the second choice.The sister spread a lie, saying that the Keeper of Shadows had kidnapped the girl, and forced her to make the promise. A lie that the girl did not love the boy. A lie that he had forced her to make the promise, that she was not the one who had forced him to let her. A lie that allowed the mother to continue loving the girl.A deal had been made, since she the promise that she had made could not be broken, lie or not. A single pomegranate seed was enough to seal her word, but she had eaten a third of it. She had really always loved the taste of pomegranate. Nonetheless, the third was relevant. A third of the pomegranate had been eaten, and so a third of the year would be spent with her now husband. The other two thirds would be spent as they had been; above ground and in the village with her mother, or in the void trying to help her mother love the light of nebulae and distant stars, or baking bread, or loving the night.When she was with her mother, the crops around the world flourished with the help of her mother and her mother's friend, the light. Her mother continued to bake the best bread and set up her stall at the farmer's market. When she was with the Keeper of Shadows, her mother grew cold and angry, and the light no longer gave life to her creations.",

    "text": "He loved him as Icarus loved the sun - too close, too much; But godling, will you be there when he takes the fall? He's standing in a field. The grass is soft under his feet. The sun is warm on his face. A gentle breeze weaves through his hair and pushes softly against his wings - -And he's falling, unforgiving winds ripping at his feathers and the merciless sun beating down on his torn skin, the churning sea beneath him reaching up to grasp at him as he tumbles from the sky. A scream tears from his throat, loud and high and pained. The blue sky reflects in his eyes and he can just barely see the outline of another being, falling after him with their arms outstretched - \"Icarus.\" The sky calls. Icarus turns. \"Yes?\" \"There's someone here to see you, child.\" Icarus nods and makes the climb back up to the temple, the rocks digging into his hands, and gently touches the keystone on his way inside. Smoke burns in his lungs- -Melting feathers are sticking to his arms, to his torso, to his face, coating the inside of his mouth with the sickening taste of burning. His wings are melting like they are waxen, filling his mind until the only thing he can remember is pain. The ground had never seemed so far away. The figure grows closer. He can see the fear in their eyes. He reaches out for them - The person sitting on the other side of the chair sparks something in his mind. Memories of laughter, of running through golden-gilded halls, of sparring and of training, of trading injuries and kisses under the burning summer sun, their skin soaked in sweat and weapons discarded around their feet, his hands slowly moving down his arms- -And they grab him by the hand. Pulls him close to their body, their arms around his torso. Feathers trail in their wake, and fabric whips in the wind rushing around them. Eyes the color of the dawn stare down at him, full of fear and yet so much warmer than the Eden summer- Golden eyes stare at him from across the table. Icarus stares back. \"Do you remember me?\" The man with the golden eyes asks, a small smile played across his lips. \"Yes,\" Icarus breathes, and his heart is burning against his ribcage, crawling up his throat, \"Apollo.\" Apollo stands from his chair, and Icarus moves to stand by his side. Then Apollo's hands are on his body, in his hair, clutching at his face, his skin as warm as the sun he governs, and then his lips are on Apollo's, and they are so close and there is no distinction between who is godly and who is mortal - - Their skin burns against his, burns worse than the harness kissing scars into his back, and he wraps his arms around them and throws his head back in a screaming laugh. Wax and blood run rivulets down his skin, painted golden in the burning of the sun. The being holding him in their arms beats their wings furiously, but the sky is unforgiving and they have to let him go. He plummets though the sky laughing, reaching out for the gods above, but no one reaches back, and he is left grasping at the thinning air- Apollo pulls away first, fire burning in his sun-golden eyes. And Icarus feels fear, terror shooting through his veins like the arrows of Apollo's bow, when he looks into the eyes of the god he loves. But he loves Apollo, and there is no going back once you love something that will never die. \"Icarus,\" Apollo says, his warm hands against his face, \"I am sorry.\" \"There was nothing you could do, Apollo,\" He lies, and he can see the pain in the set of Apollo's jaw. The look in the god's eyes rivals the emotions of the sea- -The ocean steals away his breath when his back hits the surface, and the unforgiving sea sucks him beneath the cold waves. He tries to call out for Poseidon, but the god does not answer; they never answer. Salt burns in his lungs and in his eyes, and he can feel the blood in his veins mixing with the currents wrapping around his body. He gasps for the breath he no longer needs, limbs churning through blood no longer his own. For he loves a god, and that alone keeps him from dying. What pain there is, to love a man you cannot have- Apollo slowly backs away, his skin radiating, and Icarus does not look away when the god disappears in a flash of heavenly light. Tears sting in his eyes, but he has long since learned that you do not cry over the being who will forget you. Apollo will move on, but Icarus will not- -His heart hammers in his chest. Water pushes against his lungs, pressing down on his organs, as he sinks to the bottom of the sea. Sunbeams cut through the water at the surface, painting it gold. This, he knows, is his punishment for loving something so much brighter than himself, for loving a thing that cannot die with him. He opens his mouth and stares up at the sunbeams that cut through the water, and he screams for the god he will never hold in his arms- There is a bitter sense of glee in drowning when you should be flying, Icarus",

      "A gentle breeze weaves through his hair and pushes softly against his wings - -And he's falling, unforgiving winds ripping at his feathers and the merciless sun beating down on his torn skin, the churning sea beneath him reaching up to grasp at him as he tumbles from the sky.",
      "A scream tears from his throat, loud and high and pained.",
      "The blue sky reflects in his eyes and he can just barely see the outline of another being, falling after him with their arms outstretched - \"Icarus.\"",
      "The sky calls.",
      "Icarus turns.",
      "\"Yes?\"",
      "\"There's someone here to see you, child.\"",
      "Icarus nods and makes the climb back up to the temple, the rocks digging into his hands, and gently touches the keystone on his way inside.",
      "Smoke burns in his lungs- -Melting feathers are sticking to his arms, to his torso, to his face, coating the inside of his mouth with the sickening taste of burning.",
      "His wings are melting like they are waxen, filling his mind until the only thing he can remember is pain.",
      "The ground had never seemed so far away.",
      "The figure grows closer.",
      "He can see the fear in their eyes.",
      "He reaches out for them - The person sitting on the other side of the chair sparks something in his mind.",
      "Memories of laughter, of running through golden-gilded halls, of sparring and of training, of trading injuries and kisses under the burning summer sun, their skin soaked in sweat and weapons discarded around their feet, his hands slowly moving down his arms- -And they grab him by the hand.",
      "Pulls him close to their body, their arms around his torso.",
      "Feathers trail in their wake, and fabric whips in the wind rushing around them.",
      "Eyes the color of the dawn stare down at him, full of fear and yet so much warmer than the Eden summer- Golden eyes stare at him from across the table.",
      "Icarus stares back.",
      "\"Do you remember me?\"",
      "The man with the golden eyes asks, a small smile played across his lips.",
      "\"Yes,\" Icarus breathes, and his heart is burning against his ribcage, crawling up his throat, \"Apollo.\"",
      "Apollo stands from his chair, and Icarus moves to stand by his side.",
      "Then Apollo's hands are on his body, in his hair, clutching at his face, his skin as warm as the sun he governs, and then his lips are on Apollo's, and they are so close and there is no distinction between who is godly and who is mortal - - Their skin burns against his, burns worse than the harness kissing scars into his back, and he wraps his arms around them and throws his head back in a screaming laugh.",
      "Wax and blood run rivulets down his skin, painted golden in the burning of the sun.",
      "The being holding him in their arms beats their wings furiously, but the sky is unforgiving and they have to let him go.",
      "He plummets though the sky laughing, reaching out for the gods above, but no one reaches back, and he is left grasping at the thinning air-",
      "Apollo pulls away first, fire burning in his sun-golden eyes.",
      "And Icarus feels fear, terror shooting through his veins like the arrows of Apollo's bow, when he looks into the eyes of the god he loves.",
      "But he loves Apollo, and there is no going back once you love something that will never die.",
      "\"Icarus,\" Apollo says, his warm hands against his face, \"I am sorry.\"",
      "\"There was nothing you could do, Apollo,\" He lies, and he can see the pain in the set of Apollo's jaw.",
      "The look in the god's eyes rivals the emotions of the sea- -The ocean steals away his breath when his back hits the surface, and the unforgiving sea sucks him beneath the cold waves.",
      "He tries to call out for Poseidon, but the god does not answer; they never answer.",
      "Salt burns in his lungs and in his eyes, and he can feel the blood in his veins mixing with the currents wrapping around his body.",
      "He gasps for the breath he no longer needs, limbs churning through blood no longer his own.",
      "For he loves a god, and that alone keeps him from dying.",
      "What pain there is, to love a man you cannot have-",
      "Apollo slowly backs away, his skin radiating, and Icarus does not look away when the god disappears in a flash of heavenly light.",
      "Tears sting in his eyes, but he has long since learned that you do not cry over the being who will forget you.",
      "Apollo will move on, but Icarus will not-",
      "-His heart hammers in his chest.",
      "Water pushes against his lungs, pressing down on his organs, as he sinks to the bottom of the sea.",
      "Sunbeams cut through the water at the surface, painting it gold.",
      "This, he knows, is his punishment for loving something so much brighter than himself, for loving a thing that cannot die with him.",
      "He opens his mouth and stares up at the sunbeams that cut through the water, and he screams for the god he will never hold in his arms- There is a bitter sense of glee in drowning when you should be flying, Icarus"

    "text": "x Hades is busy with a very heated internal argument when he is disturbed by insistent tugging on the back of his robes. He growls and then turns to meet a small girl staring up at him, a large flower crown in her tiny hands. His gaze softens as he cleared his throat. He wasn't supposed to be here- if his brothers just did their jobs he wouldn't have to be in this goddamned sunny place. Oh, it was disgusting. \"Turn your eyes away, child.\" he commanded thickly. The girl quickly lowered her head but to his surprise rose it again to gawk at him. Her eyes brightened, the image of him flashing in her wide grey eyes; tall and dark with robes of black ink flowing around him and a blueish-raven curtain of hair framing his ash coloured face. As the dark stranger tilted his head downwards, his midnight hair fell along the sharp edges of his cheekbones and his silvery orbs framed with black glared at her from beneath thick lashes no man should possess. She was utterly transfixed at his deathly beauty and the way her heart hammered against her small chest. \"A mortal should not gaze upon a god so casually.\" Hades raised an eyebrow. She couldn't turn away from him. Was he the man from her dreams? Perhaps a previous life? \"You are not listening.\" He said. \"For... For you!\" she stammered. She stepped forward, hands nervously clutching at the enterwined flowers before she lift them up and offered them to him. \"I... I cannot accept.\" he said awkwardly. She frowned, looking down at the flowers and then up at him. \"Are they not worthy of a god?\" She asked softly, her eyes glistening. Hades stared down at the tiny mortal, baffled by her. He was briefly reminded of a similar person from his past; with a fiery soul and flowers braided in between the silken strands of her hair. \"They are.\" he tried. \"Then why won't you take them? Is.. Am I not worthy?\" He had to resist the stupid urge to snort at her question. \"I cannot touch them. They will die. \" Hades muttered. She frowned, biting her lip and trailing her eyes up the length of his towering body. \"Will you bend down?\" \"I beg your pardon?\" Hades stuttered. \"Bend.\" she demonstrated by bending her short legs. How in the world could such a little creature exist. No fear. Reluctantly he kneeled down, adjusting his dark robes as he did so. She beamed up at him, standing on her tippy toes to ungracefuly shove the crown onto his head. He winced internally as his neatly combed hair were shoved into a messy raven nest; he really ought to cut it some time. Hades scoffed, moving to adjust it but she caught his wrist. She had no strength to actually stop him yet he allowed her to. \"They'll die.\" she reminded him and climbed into his lap to reach the top of his head. He muttered a soft yes, stunned into silence at her boldness, his slender hands holding her small sides to support her unbalanced body while she wiggled around in his lap. When he moved his arms, the mortal caught both his hands and gave him a shy smile; quickly pulling away again and putting her hands behind her back as her cheeks lit up. If his icy skin burned her, she did not show it. \"Pretty.\" She broke into a smile as she stepped back onto the grass to admire her handywork. Very pretty indeed. When he returned to the underworld later that night, he quickly pulled the flowery thing off his head and dropped it onto a small shelf in his quarters. Unconsciously he traced the flowers, petals turning black under his touch. Pretty. And familiar. x",

    "text": "When Akakios has been with them only a month, Ganymede catches ill and becomes feverish. He lies in bed, eyes closed but unable to sleep, eating almost nothing, speaking nonsense if he finds the energy to speak at all. The healers, who have seen such before, do what they can to make the boy comfortable but do not hold much hope. And yet.. all at once, the fever leaves him. King Tros comes in one morning to bathe his dying son's forehead, and finds him sitting up in bed, pale and tired but cheerful and demanding honey bread with figs. The household praises Apollo, thanking him for sparing their sweetest boy, and carry on. Akakios has been with them a full season when the boy is gored by one of the king's bulls. A poultice is made, without much hope, because the horn went deep into his thigh and much blood was spilled. He recovers. Thanks are given, but uneasily now. It is known that to be lucky too often, will catch up to a person before the end. Akakios has been with them half a year when Ganymede is tossed from a boat by unruly waves, and swept out to sea. He is found, wobbly and confused but unharmed, on the beach not far from Troy. This beach is guarded by sharp rocks positioned in such a way that brings a deathly current. Ganymede can offer no explanation for how he swam to safety - he sounds as doubtful as the rest of them when he says the sea foam carried him. By now, everyone is afraid, though no one speaks of it to Ganymede. Fate must be closing in on him. The forces of the universe have fixed on him. King Tros watches his youngest son with an aching heart, and thinks, perhaps it is kinder this way. Ganymede is unusually polite and sweet-natured. Some have remarked - not unkindly, but still, the truth stings - that he is almost like a child in his innocence. He has no head for politics and no heart for fighting. He is happy enough to serve his community, participating in civic events and assisting in the fields - but he isn't skilled at it. He prefers to spend his days, well, playing. Dancing and singing and running and playing. Tros has worried about Ganymede before. His older brothers take on the duties of king and warrior, so there isn't a practical NEED for Ganymede to step up and be a man... but he should. He can't stay a child forever. And yet, what would he do, as a man? He has no innate leadership qualities. He hasn't the sternness of character to fight. He might marry some foreign princess one day... but Tros cannot imagine the boy running his own household. And perhaps he never will. He is clearly marked for early death. Ganymede will surely die young, before the world has had its chance to make him old and weary and bitter. Ganymede will die and be frozen forever in this time, innocent and bold and happy. And unsuspecting, Ganymede goes through his days cheerful and kind as always, thinking nothing of what it means to elude fate for so long. He races his horses, plays with his dogs, wrestles with his tutor Akakios. He sings songs with Akakios, too, and they compose poetry and entertain each other with wild tales of adventure, and kiss often, if they think they can't be seen. The people of Troy say, quietly, that there's no telling if King Tros or Akakios the foreign tutor will be more heartbroken when fate finally catches up to the young prince. -------------- ~The mortal boy Ganymede will not live to become a man.~ Zeus surveys the situation grimly. He's made the same error that many other gods have made before him: he has seen the boy's fate in the Moirae's cloth, and chosen to fight it, even knowing the futility of it. And it IS futile. The universe conspires to keep fate on track. It WILL keep fate on track. Now the elements are building multiple failsafes to ensure Ganymede's death. Bandits roam the fields Ganymede is tasked to guard, where bandits had never been so bold before. Pirates lurk the coast where the prince likes to fish - rarely did they dare before, so close to the spears of Troy. Ganymede's brothers struggle in their diplomacies; war may break out, and the youngest son of the king will make a fine ransom. Hell, even lions have been spotted moving further north and west than they ever have before; while the bears move south and east. Ganymede is nearly old enough now that he will be considered a man by the world. He hasn't much time left. Zeus can plainly see the universe converging on the sweet, handsome, spoiled, naive, kind, wonderful young man he loves. Something will kill him, and soon. And Zeus must allow it. The longer he delays, the more Ganymede will suffer. And yet... when he thinks of Ganymede dying... In his bed, ill and miserable, purging his stomach of its contents and not in possession of his own mind... In pain, weeping and bleeding in the dust before the stables... Sinking to the depths of Poseidon's domain, water filling his lungs as he struggles to stay afloat... or dashed against the sharp rocks, turned to a bloody pulp... Zeus is ancient. He has seen humans die beyond counting. Young, old, in pain, in peace. He should be used to this. But Ganymede is different... Ganymede, with his beauty and kindness and affection, has taken hold of his heart like no other, and the thought of him in pain or terror, makes Zeus want to weep. If Zeus was kind, he would finish Ganymede now, swiftly, with a lightning bolt. Fulfill his fate with minimal cruelty. He goes back to the Fates, flinching at the sight of their cloth. \"Oh, you're back,\" Clotho observes dryly. \"Looking no older nor wiser,\" chimes in Lachesis. \"The weaving has been getting exciting.\" Atropos gestures towards the cruel cloth they are working on. They are not cruel, not really. It always seems that way, at first. But the Moirae are the only ones to see the full pattern of the universe all at once. Even Zeus is only privy to bits and pieces of it at any given time. The ancient women here see it all and accept it all without flinching - the beautiful and the sorrowful. \"I submit,\" he says. \"As you warned - it is futile and foolish, and only prolongs the sorrow. I wish to end his life as mercifully as can be allowed. Peer into your pattern and tell me if -\" They all scoff at once. \"Poor Zeus.\" \"Full points for making the attempt, in any case.\" \"But you didn't listen so closely as you might have.\" Zeus says nothing, blinking at them. It's testament to the respect he has for them that he only waits in silence - his sorrows often tend to display explosively in other audiences. \"The mortal boy Ganymede will not live to become a man,\" Lachesis says again, slowly, as though to an idiot. Zeus' eye twitches but he only frowns, not comprehending. The crones all sigh. \"Think on it,\" Clotho advises. \"And stop fretting so much, as to the interpretation of the weaving,\" says Atropos. \"It will be as fated. Accept that, and you will find that all that leads up to the end is negotiable.\" Confused and troubled, Zeus leaves. --------- It is about two weeks later that the insight comes to him, as he sees the bandits hired by the enemies of Troy. The men approach by night, going to where the youngest prince is guarding sheep. King Tros has sent him there much for the same reason Zeus keeps intervening - they both want Ganymede to know nothing but peace and happiness. Tros wants to spare his son the ugliness of war, as long as possible, preferring to see his charming boy playing music in the fields and flirting with passing travelers and smiling in the sunlight. Regrettably, this makes him an easy target for the kidnappers... and, Zeus has seen the cloth. The kidnappers will likely end up being murderers. It's as he's watching them, broken-hearted, that the words come to him: \"The mortal boy Ganymede will not live to become a man.\" The mortal boy will not become a man. The mortal boy. Mortal. ------- The fields are dark; the moon behind a covering of clouds. There is nothing to see in the dark; only the nervous bleating of the sheep to let him know they are there at all. He is wide awake and alert, straining to hear, all attention on the far end of the field. The monstrous bird, when it comes, catches him entirely by surprise - scaly talons as thick as his torso, that wrap around his entire body and lift him up. His feet leave the ground, his head dangling down. He hears the bleating swell in volume and then recede. His dogs, too, are baying, the sound fading below him. Did he cry out, or struggle? Perhaps. But his shock and total bewilderment are so great that he mostly just - shakes, and breathes raggedly, and wonders if he is dreaming. The moon comes out from behind the clouds, finally, and he sees two things: the first, below him, is water. Endless water, stretching in all directions. He is being carried over the sea, moving fast. He cranes his head up and sees the second thing. An impossible thing. A bird - an eagle. Large as the front hall of his father's palace. Holding him in its talons. Staring ahead, eyes fixed on something Ganymede cannot see. He must be dreaming. Has to be. But the eagle looks down at him then, past a beak sharp and curved and as long as he is tall. The eagle's eyes are bigger than Ganymede's skull, and they stare down at him gravely, conveying emotions beyond fathoming. \"Sleep, boy.\" The voice is everywhere, vast as the sky, and rolls through him: his mind and entire body. He does sleep, instantly, as commanded, and knows no more.",

      "Tros wants to spare his son the ugliness of war, as long as possible, preferring to see his charming boy playing music in the fields and flirting with passing travelers and smiling in the sunlight.",
      "Regrettably, this makes him an easy target for the kidnappers... and, Zeus has seen the cloth.",
      "The kidnappers will likely end up being murderers.",
      "It's as he's watching them, broken-hearted, that the words come to him: \"The mortal boy Ganymede will not live to become a man.\"",
      "The mortal boy will not become a man.",
      "The mortal boy.",
      "Mortal.",
      "------- The fields are dark; the moon behind a covering of clouds.",
      "There is nothing to see in the dark; only the nervous bleating of the sheep to let him know they are there at all.",
      "He is wide awake and alert, straining to hear, all attention on the far end of the field.",
      "The monstrous bird, when it comes, catches him entirely by surprise - scaly talons as thick as his torso, that wrap around his entire body and lift him up.",
      "His feet leave the ground, his head dangling down.",
      "He hears the bleating swell in volume and then recede.",
      "His dogs, too, are baying, the sound fading below him.",
      "Did he cry out, or struggle?",
      "Perhaps.",
      "But his shock and total bewilderment are so great that he mostly just - shakes, and breathes raggedly, and wonders if he is dreaming.",
      "The moon comes out from behind the clouds, finally, and he sees two things: the first, below him, is water.",
      "Endless water, stretching in all directions.",
      "He is being carried over the sea, moving fast.",
      "He cranes his head up and sees the second thing.",
      "An impossible thing.",
      "A bird - an eagle.",
      "Large as the front hall of his father's palace.",
      "Holding him in its talons.",
      "Staring ahead, eyes fixed on something Ganymede cannot see.",
      "He must be dreaming.",
      "Has to be.",
      "But the eagle looks down at him then, past a beak sharp and curved and as long as he is tall.",
      "The eagle's eyes are bigger than Ganymede's skull, and they stare down at him gravely, conveying emotions beyond fathoming.",
      "\"Sleep, boy.\"",
      "The voice is everywhere, vast as the sky, and rolls through him: his mind and entire body.",
      "He does sleep, instantly, as commanded, and knows no more."

    "text": "Artemis straightens and gazes, over the fields and rolling hills, towards the setting sun. The wind rustles her hair - already getting long enough to need to braid it back, to keep it out of the way. Her bow is clutched in one bruised fist - the bow is crude and flimsy, and looks exactly like what it is: a bow made by a child with limited resources but preternatural skill. It's served her well, in fighting the beasts sent to torment Artemis and her family. She narrows her eyes as she surveys the land. I have to be strong in this, she thinks. Mother isn't here now, and Apollo doesn't have the strength yet. Behind her, her idiot brother is still cooing excitedly. \"Ohhhhh Artemis, look at his tail - it's just a short little bit of fluff!!! Look, it's so short - I bet it's soft too - ahh, but it's probably wrong to just pet someone's tail, isn't it...\" Artemis breathes in deeply and counts to five before answering. \"It's not a someone, 'Pollo, it's a something. A centaur. You've seen them before, they're nasty, savage brutes!\" \"This one's different, though! You can tell by looking at him.\" She really doesn't get it. It's a centaur. Yeah, it's a baby, and yeah, it's cute. Most baby animals are cute, and then they grow up to be bears and wolves and centaurs. Currently, it's standing on wobbly legs, and hiding behind a tree. Well, \"hiding.\" It hasn't figured out yet that it's too long to hide completely behind the tree trunk, so it's peering out at them and its entire horsey rear end is sticking out. As Apollo has noted, its tail is that of a foal's - short and fluffy and flicking nervously fast. \"All I can tell is that it's not big enough to cause damage yet. Apollo, it's gonna just be a matter of time before this one's snarling and trying to shove a spear down your throat. Like the ones we ran into three days ago.\" Apollo's developed a talent for guessing the future, but he's apparently not much use for learning from the past. \"Ahh, Artemis, you'll see.\" Ugh, he's getting that look on his face - faraway and placid. He's having a \"vision\". She isn't totally convinced yet that it's real, and that he isn't just trying to make himself look smarter, but she has to admit he's starting to be right more often than not. Apollo continues talking in that soft, knowing voice, as he holds out a hand to the baby centaur. \"He'll be a wonder. There will be no one who doesn't know his name; no one who doesn't adore him.\" \"Just like you, right?\" Artemis asks sarcastically. He's made that prediction about himself,too. \"Nothing nearly as powerful as we'll be, sister; but well-known. A wise teacher, he'll be, respected and beloved by heroes and gods alike.\" The centaur is emerging from behind the tree. Now that she can see the human half of his body better, it's hard to deny that he's a cute little fellow. He has a soft tummy, a chubby round babyish face, topped with curly black hair. Two pointed ears poke out of the curly locks. His eyes are warm and dark brown and enormous, flicking between the two of them. He's different in other ways as well - he's built differently. Even though he has a foal's body - long skinny legs, short fluffy tail, knobbly knees - he's visibly stockier than most other centaurs she's seen, and taller. His body is a lovely dark bay color, highlighted red where the sun shines on it, and he has white feathers at the hooves. His mannerisms are shy, a little skittish, but more - more calmly so. He has far less nervous energy than a typical centaur. He seems inclined to stay still and observe... and release all of his nervous energy via his madly-twitching tail. She hates to admit it (and certainly won't admit it out loud), but Apollo was right - you can tell just by looking at him. There's a certain intelligence to his warm eyes, a certain consideration to the way he takes his steps, even though he's still a child - little more than a baby, really. \"I wonder what happened to the rest of his family,\" she says, not quite conceding the point to Apollo, but grudgingly going along with it. \"There's no tracks of any others, and they're pack creatures.\" \"Not this one. He's -an entirely different species, I think.\" \"Two different species of half-man, half-horse?\" Artemis doesn't bother to keep the cynicism out of her voice. \"Why not? There's more than one species of fish or bird.\" She feels like this is a non sequitur reply, but she doesn't have an argument for that, so she leaves it be. The centaur has tiptoed closer to Apollo, who reaches into his pack and pulls out an apple. \"You're feeding him, now?\" \"He's hungry - oh!\" The centaur baby has snatched the apple and is indeed eating it hungrily. Apollo laughs where he crouches, watching. \"What a charming little fellow.\" \"Charming or not - different or not, we don't really need a pet right now, Apollo.\" Her brother looks over at her with a familiar look of mildly condescending annoyance. As much as this expression gets on her nerves, she still prefers it over the distant expression he gets when he's in a vision. \"He won't be a pet, Artemis, don't be rude.\" She gets a sinking feeling, tempered with preemptive resignation. She may not be able to seethe future as often or as precisely as Apollo, but she can see as clearly as she sees Lord Helios in the sky, that they're about to be saddled with a clever and lonely baby centaur. Sure enough: \"...He'll be... my son,\" Apollo declares. Artemis groans. \"Come on, 'Pollo-!\" But it's too late. Apollo's holding his arms out for the centaur. The centaur takes a moment to wipe his apple-smeared face with a leaf (and Artemis knows that little fussy detail is making her fussy brother's heart do flips), and then the centaur steps over to grasp Apollo's hand. Apollo hugs the boy/foal and the centaur starts crying, burying his face into Apollo's perfect hair as Apollo's hand rubs his back. \"Shh, shh, little one. It's all right. You'll be with us, now.\" Artemis slouches over to the sentimental scene. \"Well, what's his name, then?\" \"Hmm.\" Apollo pulls away a little and smiles at the solemn-faced centaur, tidying his curly hair as he thinks. \"I like the sound of...Chiron.\" \"Chiron?\" Artemis and the centaur say in unison. The centaur's voice is youthful and childish and uncertain. \"Chiron,\" Apollo repeats, booping the kid's nose as he says it. He points at himself next. \"And you can call me... Papa.\" \"Papa,\" says the centaur - Chiron. He boops Apollo's nose; Apollo laughs again. Artemis sighs and fiddles with her bow. Her brother is a soft-hearted fool - but then again, she's putting up with this nonsense just because she can't say no to the smile on her brother's face, so perhaps she's no better. ----------- Leto loves him, of course, immediately. She's the entity of motherhood and adores the lost child who's found a home with her children. Artemis accepts Chiron as her nephew, but remains distant from him for a while. The archery lessons he receives from her are kind but standoffish, at least at first. She finally warms up to him all at once, one day, when she catches Chiron spying on her at practice. Little Chiron is determined to do his utmost to excel in all the things his foster parents can do. He's already learned some basic medical and lyre skills from Apollo, and archery and tracking from Artemis... but now he wants to master gymnastics, too, it seems. From where he's \"hidden\" behind a tree - still completely visible - she spots him attempting to imitate her front handspring-to-somersault move. Something complicated happens when he does this and the boy lands in a heap, long horse legs sticking straight up in the air as his human half remains lodged upside-down in a bush. She bursts into laughter at the sight and goes to help him, finally letting down the walls in her heart. -------------- Apollo's actual children, by the way such things are traditionally accounted, come later - after Python, after the twins have taken their thrones on Olympus, after the terrible rise and eventual fall ofTyphon. After all this, there is leisure time enough for Apollo to charm and dazzle his way into the beds of many goddesses, nymphs, and mortal women alike. There are numerous descendants of Apollo, and he is pleased with all ofthem. But the first child, by the way Apollo accounts such things (and Artemis too, for that matter), had arrived years before all of the rest. Eventually, through Rhea, they learn the truth of the matter - Chiron is Apollo's uncle - but this is only an interesting bit of trivia at this point. Apollo has many children, but Chiron is Apollo's first child in the only way that matters.",

      "Currently, it's standing on wobbly legs, and hiding behind a tree.",
      "Well, \"hiding.\"",
      "It hasn't figured out yet that it's too long to hide completely behind the tree trunk, so it's peering out at them and its entire horsey rear end is sticking out.",
      "As Apollo has noted, its tail is that of a foal's - short and fluffy and flicking nervously fast.",
      "\"All I can tell is that it's not big enough to cause damage yet.",

      "Two pointed ears poke out of the curly locks.",
      "His eyes are warm and dark brown and enormous, flicking between the two of them.",
      "He's different in other ways as well - he's built differently.",
      "Even though he has a foal's body - long skinny legs, short fluffy tail, knobbly knees - he's visibly stockier than most other centaurs she's seen, and taller.",
      "His body is a lovely dark bay color, highlighted red where the sun shines on it, and he has white feathers at the hooves.",
      "His mannerisms are shy, a little skittish, but more - more calmly so.",
      "He has far less nervous energy than a typical centaur.",
      "He seems inclined to stay still and observe... and release all of his nervous energy via his madly-twitching tail.",

    "text": "It's something around five or six hundred years after she marries her husband, that she hears of Pericles' famous funeral oration. It's a pretty enough speech; inspiring in many ways and always eloquent. His speech is intended to embolden the audience, and stir up patriotism and pride in their great city of Athens, by describing all the ways in which Athens is the best society. As such, it's not especially factually describing Athens, so much as it is describing the ideal that Athens strives for. So, not strictly accurate, nor is it especially meant to be. Still, she has to chuckle a bit at his inclusion of the ideal Athenian woman: \"A woman's reputation is highest when men say little about her, whether it be good or evil.\" The implication being, of course, that she led an unremarkable life of quiet obedience to her father and her husband - no wicked deeds, of course; nor any eye-catching noble deeds. Naive little fool! All it means, when no one speaks of a woman for good or ill, is that she never got caught. And no one speaks of Hebe, hardly at all. ------------------------- The myths about Hebe are sparse - Pericles would surely approve. You'd think it would be difficult to be this invisible, given that she is the daughter of the King and Queen of Olympus, and Zeus and Hera have quite the flair for the dramatic, to put it mildly. Her big brother, Ares, is a regular source of excitement as well; and her aunts and uncles and all her half-brothers and half-sisters complement the full circus. Lots of myths about them. But since the whole lot of them seem to have claimed all the fuss and commotion, leaving none left for Hebe. Hebe is a calm and pleasant baby from the start. The novelty of such a creature born on Olympus makes her adored even more than she already is as a princess. When she is presented to her family, upon her birth and joyful acceptance by Zeus and Hera, the gifts are piled high upon tables. Astonishing paintings and mosaics and special songs, composed for her alone, come from Apollo; a collection of shiny coins from all over the world, and a carefully carved bird that whistles when you blow into it, from Hermes; soft-woven clothes for herself and her dolls, from Athena; toys made of beaten metal that wind up and move about, created by Hephaestus. And so many more! Hebe's birth is a rare occasion that brings only happiness to Olympus. It's this that shapes her role as the goddess of youth. Everyone forever wants to preserve this; to give her presents and play games and never, never get caught up in the worries and drama that await an adult. Particularly Zeus and Hera, who have more than enough tensions of their own at home, and don't want to lose this one beautiful thing they've created together. So Hebe stays young - generally, taking the appearance of a nine- or ten-year-old for most of her charmed existence, and behaving the same. Papa Zeus laughs and tosses her into the air when he sees her; Mama Hera smiles and brings her to sit in her lap and talk about the adventures her dolls have been having. Hebe's life is pleasant and unchallenging. She brings laughter and gaiety to all who see her... but when they leave the room, her childish ways are quickly forgotten. No one speaks ill of Hebe, certainly. How could they? But her stalled childhood prevents them from having anything good or interesting to say about her either. And they all make the mistake of assuming that because she looks and acts like a child, that she must possess the brain of a child as well. Which often (unfairly) means they think of her as a sweet simpleton. But Hebe is clever and mature and extraordinarily self-possessed, child or not. And eventually, Hebe grows bored. --------------- Her first rebellion is so small and insignificant that it isn't even perceived as rebellion. Hebe envies the other gods their purposes. Papa is the king, and makes stormclouds. Mama is the queen and blesses marriages. Hermes delivers messages and steals things and tells funny jokes. Aunt Demeter makes plants grow. Grandpa Helios is the sun; he gives light and warmth to the whole world every day. And all the others have important jobs to do as well. What is there for Hebe to do? She doesn't want to be the goddess of playing with dolls all day, even if it is fun. So she creates a job for herself, getting the idea after she watches enough of the councils, spying upon them from a secret place behind a pillar. She has her dolls with her as props, in case she gets caught, she can look like she's just playing. No one notices her, though, except for Aunt Hess, who catches her eye and winks. Come to think of it, there aren't many myths about Aunt Hess, either... Hebe goes to Mama and Papa when they're both in a good mood at the same time and in the same place, which means waiting a while. Even luckier, they happen to be mostly alone: only Aunt Hestia and Hermes are nearby, and they're speaking at Auntie's Hearth, while Mama and Papa sit on a bench overlooking the clouds. Papa's slightly out of sorts - one of his favorite heroes isn't doing well at the moment - but Hebe bets she can cheer him up the rest of the way with a winning grin, throwing herself at him so he has to catch her. She's right, and his booming laughter fills the hall as he tosses her into the air and then hugs her tightly, and his broad smile matches Mama's. \"What trouble is my little ducky getting into today?\" he teases her, using the nickname they've all used lately, stemming from a game where she'd pretended to be all the animals. Everyone had fallen in love with her duck impression. Hebe knows how to work a crowd. She sticks her tongue out at him, making him and Mama both laugh at her impertinence. \"I don't get into trouble hardly at all anymore, Papa, but if you're worried about it, I have an idea.\" They laugh again, amused. This is the face they usually present to her, but she's seen them strained, furious, heartbroken. She likes to see them happy, smiling. \"A plan to keep you out of trouble? You must have stayed up all night with Athena to cook up such an idea!\" Now Mama's teasing. Of course Hebe doesn't get into trouble. \"I did not ask Athena for any help! This is my own idea!\" she hmphs, crossing her arms. Papa and Mama pretend to wither at her stern look. \"Of course, my darling, Athena is not the only one with clever ideas,\" Mama soothes. \"So what is this great plan?\" Papa coaxes. She drops the offended look at once. \"You need a cupbearer!\" she declares. They both raise their eyebrows in surprise! \"A cupbearer?\" \"Right! To take your drinks to you when you're at council, so that you don't need to interrupt to get up.\" At present, at feasts or at councils, the gods serve themselves the nectar they drink. It's a minor enough inconvenience. But at feasts, they have often complained of going thirsty in order not to miss a song from Apollo or a dance from his Muses; and in councils it can be worse, with no one wishing to absent themselves during an important discussion point. Aunt Hestia has offered to serve the gods and this was shot down immediately. It was beneath her to serve them; she is the firstborn of the Olympians and it is beneath her to serve them. There is no one, anywhere in the world, who wishes to see Aunt Hestia demean herself... even if she herself doesn't care. It is technically beneath Hebe, too, as the Princess of Olympus, and she can see it in her parents' faces. Particularly Mama's - she won't like the idea of her precious daughter serving those other children of Papa's. The bastard children. Hebe heads off this dangerous line of thought before it can even be formed completely. She takes an earnest posture, hands clasped on Papa's knee and looking up into his face. Papa's a soft heart, when it comes to his daughters and especially little girls. She glances often over at her mother, though - the petition has to be run by Papa, he is the King and would make the formal pronouncement, but Hebe knows the real approval needs to come from Mama. \"I want to help, to be useful! It isn't right that all I do is play all day, while everyone else is working!\" Papa makes a slightly pained expression. \"My sweet girl, that's all we want for you - we work hard so you won't have to. There's no one on Olympus, or anywhere else in the world, who thinks ill of you for it.\" \"But I do, Papa,\" says Hebe, biting her lip. \"I want to do more.\" She's trying not to be dramatic about it - Mama and Papa do not need more drama - but she really hates being the cute decorative girl-child, forever sitting around playing dress-up. It's not that she doesn't have fun doing that, but she doesn't like it being her only future. Mama understands this part - Hebe doesn't know all of the adults' problems, but she has overheard Mama say more than once that she doesn't intend for her life to be over just because she's married now. She says she's the Queen and by Ouranos' balls, she's going to be part of running this damned cosmos, come hell or high water. She looks over at Mama, now. \"I want to be helpful. I want to be part of Olympus, even if it's just a little bit. I can bring everyone their drinks so they don't have to get up, and stand out of the way once I'm done. If everyone drinks slowly, I can even still practice writing or sew a little while I wait.\" They both settle visibly at this. They're running it through in their heads, and picturing something cute - a little girl, pretending to be part of the grown-ups' affairs, running to her brothers and sisters and aunts and uncle to carefully pour their cups, having to be called over from playing with her toys in order to attend to them. And, honestly, that will probably happen at least a couple of times. Sometimes the council topics are exciting but sometimes they're so boring that probably getting up to refill your cup is a blessed break, a chance to excuse yourself for a moment. Too bad, gods! They'll have to find a different excuse now; Hebe's got a job. Papa smiles and looks to Mama. \"Well, what about it, wife? Do you think our daughter can handle this great responsibility?\" Mama pretends to think. \"Hmm, it's difficult to say. We shall have to give her a chance to prove herself, I suppose. It would certainly be a helpful person to have around, a cupbearer.\" \"Very well.\" Papa sits upright very seriously, and Mama does too, holding her staff regally as Papa places his hand solemnly on Hebe's head. This part is serious, not silly and pretend. The job may be minor, but when a god or goddess is appointed a duty, it is a serious event. It makes Hebe shiver a little. \"As the Lord of Olympus, Ruler of all the Cosmos, and the power that comes with my burden and duty, I declare that Hebe, daughter of Hera and Zeus, will henceforth be the appointed cupbearer of the gods - to keep their cups filled, at feasts or councils. Gladdened Princess, do you accept this charge?\" Gladdened Princess is the only epithet she's earned - yet. Hebe bows her head solemnly. \"I swear upon the Styx to uphold my duties until released from this oath by Zeus the king or Hera the Queen,\" she recites. Papa's face splits open into a grin yet again, and he crushes her to him in a hug that makes her laugh when his beard tickles her neck. \"Excellent! A cupbearer at last!\" he cries, delighted with her. \"Our little baby girl, with her first domain,\" Mama says, stroking Hebe's hair. They play a quick game of hoops, to celebrate, and then Hebe excuses herself from their presence. She walks past Hermes and Auntie Hestia, who are still reclined near the Hearth and grinning at Hebe and not even pretending they hadn't been eavesdropping. \"Well, well! A cupbearer on Olympus! How very exciting!\" Auntie Hess congratulates her. \"I was getting so tired of always having to get up for my own drink!\" Hermes makes a gesture of exhaustion. \"It will be wonderful to have you be part of the council, even if only peripherally. I'm glad Zeus and Hera agreed.\" \"Oh yes, and very masterfully played, by the way,\" Hermes says with a wink. Hebe attempts to frown at Hermes, which is hard - it's difficult to say which of her brothers she likes the most, but Hermes is certainly the most fun. \"Oh, Hermes, don't be a pest,\" Hestia scolds him on Hebe's behalf, but she's smiling too. \"Look, it takes a thief to catch a thief, and I made my great debut on Olympus by overwhelming the mighty Zeus with my irresistible cuteness. Which I still retain to this day.\" Hermes is floating a couple feet in the air, ankle wings fluttering fast as he gestures grandly. He turns to Hebe again, pressing a finger alongside his nose with another exaggerated conspiratorial wink. \"Nothing wrong with using your cuteness as a weapon! I mean, it's worked great for me! - \" Hermes ignores Auntie Hestia's amused scoff. \"... but you can't fool me, kiddo!\" Well, if anyone were to figure it out, these two are probably the safest. Hebe rolls her eyes at her silly brother and stands haughtily, arms crossed. \"I'm gonna spike your drink with bitterwort,\" she informs him loftily. \"Your face is gonna go like this - \" she scrunches up her face in an impression of Hermes drinking the foul-tasting beverage, and then laughs as he scoops her up in the air and dangles her over the brook nearby, playfully growling threats to dunk her under. -------------------- In short order, Hebe is given another duty - as Mama's attendant. She is there to assist Mama getting in and out of her chariot, when she goes afield: harnessing the gold-bridled horses and yoking them to the chariot, and watching in fascination as the gold-and-silver car races off, a wonder to behold. She assists Mama in dressing - mainly by fetching the prettiest baubles to decorate her lovely hands and neck - and brushes her hair. Mama returns this favor to her, brushing Hebe's hair 100 times until it's smooth and soft. Hebe stands by Mama's side in a formal court, along with her friend Iris, to fetch and retrieve anything Mama asks for, or to help her in any other way. This is something Hebe has always wanted to do also; but when the time comes and she is appointed, it's more out of necessity than because Hebe asked. Hebe is not, in fact, the only daughter of Zeus and Hera. But her sister, Eileithyia, is fading out of consciousness quite inconveniently early, and is not around to attend to Mama. The process isn't complete yet, but it's clear that Eileithyia is planning to do it. Anytime Hebe visits her sister's rooms, assuming Eileithyia is there at all, she can be found sitting in a misty, wavering form, in a kind of trance. She's attending to her duties metaphysically, which all of the gods and goddesses do - even Hebe, who certainly doesn't show up in person every time someone is feeling youthful. But Eileithyia has recently opted to conduct her business almost entirely metaphysically, and hasn't been socially available for quite some time. She got the idea from their Grandmama Rhea, who announced that she was leaving the conscious running of the universe to the younger generation, and began fading out. She embraced her eternal concept of motherhood and does not choose to wear her personality often anymore. Eileithyia thinks that's incredibly deep and meaningful and began doing the same thing, abandoning her personality and consciousness in favor of floating in her room. It's not like she's gone - you can even have a conversation with her if you're patient enough to wait three months for her to notice you've been greeting her. But she never has much to say, since she hasn't been doing anything in so long, so Hebe rarely bothers. \"You'll see, sweet little Hebe,\" she'd said last time, in a conversation that had taken nearly six hours to complete in spite of the lack of content. \"You'll get tired of all the drama, all the arguing, all the betrayals. You'll be right here with me where there's peace and silence.\" Very tiresome. Hebe thinks all the dramatics are exciting; and even if it's hard sometimes, it's all proof of how much her family really cares about things, about each other. This is a lesson that Auntie Hess imparted to her. Though she is Mama's attendant, Hebe spends more of her time at Auntie Hess' hearth than anywhere else. Auntie Hess, like Hebe, sees value in helping others, even if it's technically beneath her. Hebe, as a cupbearer and all-around welcome face on Olympus, is privy to many more secrets than the Olympians think they're letting on, and Aunt Hestia has told her that it's a great privilege and burden to be the secret-bearer, and that she must never use her knowledge to hurt her family. She even cautions her against using it for good, at least not overtly, in case she misreads a situation and makes it worse. Subtlety and kindness will help their family to stay together in spite of their willfulness and passion, says Aunt Hestia. \"Subtlety\" seems to be the key word, and Hebe doesn't mind being discreet and sneaky, but she isn't terribly impressed with the fact that it all amounts to being a sweet, well-behaved girl. Perhaps Hebe did inherit a tiny thirst for dramatics and excitement after all. -------------- Her next great act of rebellion is also passed off as a childish game; though it's increasingly a difficult concept to sell on her parents... or, more particularly, to Mama. \"But that's her greatest domain!\" Hebe pleads. \"She spends all her time with young girls, and has adventures with them!\" \"She spends all her time in the wilderness hunting bears and boars and fighting giants; and the girls tag along,\" Mama corrects, looking stern. Mama really doesn't like Artemis, and Artemis really doesn't like Mama. They've reached a sort of truce by way of Artemis staying in her wilds and rarely interacting with Mama; but if they spend any great amount of time together, the truce falls apart. It's a shame. Hebe loves Mama, but she likes Artemis a lot, too. She wants desperately to join the virgin goddess' band of girls, going out running around and hunting and playing, and if Hermes is to be believed (a great risk), there's wrestling and swearing!! Because they don't have to be ladies, if there aren't any boys around! Obviously, Hebe has responsibilities here on Olympus. She's the cupbearer, and after only a few short years on the job, everyone's already deemed the position as indispensable! And she's still Mama's main attendant, along with Iris. She needs to be able to help Mama with her chariot and her hair and jewelry. But she longs for the ability to run around, fastfastfast, surrounded by other girls her age, independent and wild and making noise. At least just once in a while! \"It might not be a bad idea, though,\" Papa says. \"Eileithyia doesn't look like she's going to be over this phase anytime soon, and Hebe needs other girls to play with. I know you don't... approve of Artemis, but after all, that's the domain she chose, and she takes it very seriously.\" Mama sighs, rubbing her temple. \"Oh, let me consider it a little longer.\" Papa looks at Hebe, quirks his mouth and shrugs. Hebe knows. After Kore - Queen Persephone, now - Papa has decided it's not in his best interest to call all the shots on his daughters' decisions. Particularly since Mama is considerably quicker to anger than even Aunt Demeter. But Hebe has been weaponizing her cuteness for a while now. Before she even spoke to Mama and Papa today, she approached Artemis with her plan, begging her to stay on the downlow for a while so Mama wouldn't have any hard reasons to disallow Hebe to join her. Artemis was amused but agreed. After all, she said, Zeus' daughters had to stick together. \"You should just threaten to rip out his chest hair if you don't get what you want, like I did!\" she adds. Hebe giggles. It takes Hera another year or so to make up her mind, but by the time Kore is back above the ground, Hebe is there to greet her, running with the nymphs Nephele and Siproites and Hyacinthia, shouting and whooping. -------------------- Hebe is a cheerful and happy girl. She loves her Mama and Papa. She loves her Aunts Demeter and Hestia; she loves her Uncle Poseidon and she likes writing letters to Uncle Hades, though she hasn't met him yet. She loves all her brothers and sisters, no matter which one or how they get along with each other. She loves Hephaestus' forge and his big, scary, friendly Cyclopes helpers and his pretty wife Aglaia. She loves Apollo and how he brings her paintings and sings songs with her and plays duck-duck-goose with the Muses. She loves playing dress-up with Aphrodite and her naughty, silly son Eros, and the mischief they make together. She loves playing trivia games with Athena and playing with her owl friend Bubo. She loves putting on makeup with Dionysus and teasing Pan together with him. She loves racing Hermes and jumping out to scare him. She loves Artemis and the nymphs, who are like her second, part-time family. She loves them all, and would not ever pick a favorite. But she does have to admit that she has a certain special closeness to her big brother Ares. They've all sort of learned to not call too much attention to the question of whose parents they have. Most of them are some combination of Papa - that is, Zeus, plus 'someone else.' Athena was born only of Papa; Hephy was born only of Mama. But Ares is the only other one who is the child of the King and Queen both. They are the royal children (well, and Eileithyia, but she's too busy being Wise and One With The Cosmos in her room. Hopeless.). Hebe and Ares don't have much else directly in common with each other. Ares is the god of war, courage, and manliness. He's argumentative and brash; noisy and prone to fighting. He's always caught up in drama - mostly, fighting with Athena and Hephaestus and Apollo and Papa and Mama... and, well, he definitely isn't the Joy of Olympus. Hebe and Ares both have the unenviable position no one else has, of being caught exactly in the middle of Mama and Papa. Mama and Papa both equally expect Hebe and Ares to take their side when they argue; a pressure that no one else has hanging over their heads. She knows that's at least part the reason Eileithyia chose to shut down. It's a very strained sort of loneliness. Hebe endures it because all of Olympus endeavors to keep her out of it; to keep her a happy child forever. She still feels the responsibility, though. Ares feels it, too, but his flat and brusque manner, combined with his total clumsy inability to read the emotions of a room, only serves to make everyone angry with him. Ares does not have what would be his rightful place as a Prince of Olympus. Hebe isn't sure she's ever heard anyone refer to him by the title. He's gone for a long time, often; off overseeing wars and uprisings and other occasions where men and women need him to bolster their resolve. When he returns, Hebe has drawn his bath. This is their routine. It probably is a little weird, and perhaps others would deem it inappropriate. But Olympus is fueled by unseemly behavior, and Hebe herself expresses her thoughts on the matter once: \"You really shouldn't be in here when I'm taking a bath,\" Ares says, keeping a cloth around him until he sinks beneath the sudsy water, heated courtesy of a few borrowed coals from Auntie's Hearth. Hebe shrugs. She's seen him naked before; the way the gods of Olympus strut around, it's impossible to avoid. A bit of a double standard, but the reality is no one really cares if they see a man's privates. A girl learns to roll her eyes and look the other way until they manage to find an improvised chlamys for modesty's sake. \"It's not like I'm looking, brother,\" she chides, pouring water over his head. \"And I'm afraid if I leave, you'll fall asleep in the tub and drown.\" He wasn't quite ready for the water on his head, and sputters before fixing her with a stinkeye which she ignores. His hair is... well, gross. Sweaty and dirty and with more than a little blood in it. She sighs and presses a small vial of scented oil into his hand. \"Use that on your nasty hair.\" He chuckles slightly. \"Nasty, eh? Yeah, I guess that's the word for it.\" In spite of his objection, he seems too tired to really care what she's doing or where she's standing. He leans back into the tub and half-heartedly works the oil into his hair. Hebe goes to the table where she's kept his clean clothes and waits there, eyes politely looking to the window where she can see Selene and Artemis in the night sky. \"You look beat to hell, brother,\" she says, striving to always speak honestly. He laughs again, a bit louder and more sincere this time. \"Do I? Where'd you learn to talk like that, kid?\" \"I've learned a lot from Artemis' nymphs. Words like fuck, shit, bugger, cunt - \" she recites proudly. \"Okay, okay! Cut it out! People will think I've been teaching you that shit!\" Ares is still laughing to himself. \"Sheesh. One season with Arty and you're already swearing like an Amazon.\" \"She says once in a while you two hunt together. Invite me along next time?\" He's quiet for a while, and Hebe wonders if he's fallen asleep. He really does look beat to hell. He'd shuffled into the bath like an old man with all his aches; begrimed and cut up and tired. There's an unguent from Apollo's stock here in this room; maybe she can try to apply it to some of the uglier-looking bruises and swellings and cuts before he puts on his clean chiton and cloak. Ares finally answers. \"Yeah, maybe. Might be nice having another sister tagging along.\" ----------------------------- There's a certain equilibrium she's managed to achieve, and for the most part she's satisfied. She's still everyone's favorite child-princess; the delight of Olympus and the innocent playmate who stays removed from the drama. But she's apprenticed to Hestia, and knows the gossip and how to gently steer her hotheaded family away from dangerous situations and conversations. And she's gained employment, as a cupbearer and as Mama's attendant and one of Artemis' part-time virgin retinue. It's not quite as spectacular as her brothers or sisters' roles; but she isn't really ambitious. She's managed to sneak her way out of the vapid part everyone wanted her to play, and did so in a way that left no one with any major words to remark upon. No one speaks poorly of her, of course; but her domains and accomplishments are so subtle that no one thinks to praise them either. Pericles, had he been born yet, would surely approve. And she might have been content with this forever, had she not strayed a little further from Artemis' party than she meant to, one day. It's a fine, sunny day and Hebe hears the sound of a lyre on the wind. Curious, she follows the sound - maybe it's Apollo? But, Apollo's music is generally so beautiful that her feet begin dancing all of their own will. This music isn't Apollo-class. To be completely honest, it's really bad. She comes across a man who appears to be in his late twenties or early thirties, sitting atop a rock overseeing a large herd of cattle and plucking idly at a lyre. He's... not particularly beautiful. Not the way her brothers are... he's one of the biggest men she's ever seen, nearly as large as her brother Ares when he takes mortal form. Just this huge, plain-looking man sitting on a rock, watching a lot of cows, and playing the lyre badly. She really can't place what it is that intrigues her, only that... he seems interesting, somehow. His face looks kind. And he looks.... Fun. Her curiosity finally compels her to step forward and shout to catch his attention. \"Hey there! You, man! What do you call yourself?\" He looks up, unsurprised to see her - he must have known she was hiding all along. Normally this would annoy her very much. But the easy grin on his face settles any injury to her pride. \"Hey there, yourself! I call myself Alcides, thank you for your interest!\" he calls back. \"And if I may ask, what do you call yourself?\" \"You may not ask! It's a secret!\" she informs him, having the sense not to give her name away to strange men. He only laughs, unoffended. \"Very well. May I call you Lion Princess for now? Since you roar so fiercely, yet have such a regal bearing?\" She tries not to show how pleased she is. \"I suppose it will do.\" She comes closer still. \"What are you doing out here?\" \"I'm watching my father Amphitryon's cattle and killing time with a lyre.\" \"Killing music in general with that lyre!\" He laughs again. \"Harsh little Lion Princess! Well, you may be right, I'm not very good at it yet, am I? I was always getting beaten by my music master about it.\" \"That's too bad. He probably wasn't a good teacher.\" Alcides shrugs. \"I think my talents lie elsewhere than music. But it's fun to play anyway, sometimes, don't you think, Lion Princess? Even if I'm not the best at it.\" He likes fun for its own sake. Hebe grins back at him. \"I do think so! And I'm glad you're enjoying yourself, even if you're a terrible musician! But Alcides, what are your talents, then? Looking at cows?\" \"I'm great at looking at cows! No one's better!\" he puts his chest out exaggeratedly as he boasts, making her laugh. \"But actually, I think my greatest talent might be... discus. Do you play, Lion Princess?\" She claps her hands excitedly. \"Yes! Have you got one on you now? Throw it here!\" He softballs it, of course, but she'll let it slide for now. Hebe's only excited to be playing the game. She races across the lawn, dodging stray cows and catching the discus triumphantly while Alcides cheers. Hebe flings it back at him. He catches it - but pretends that the force of her throw knocked him backwards, clear off the rock. She laughs again and runs over to see where he's fallen - only to shriek in surprise as he jumps out from behind the rock to scare her. Alcides laughs along with her, not unkindly - just as though he's sharing the joke with her, and he graciously accepts it when she flings a fistful of weeds at him. \"You - you rascal!\" she scolds around her mirth. Alcides bows deeply. \"Guilty as charged, Lion Princess.\" They throw the discus back and forth a few times, and Hebe teaches him the simple notes to a song she likes - a little composition about a bee and a bear. Alcides teaches her a joke about a man who was outwitted by his donkey. They formally exchange gifts - he gives her a shiny pebble, in an unusual color of green; she gives him a chain of clovers. Grandpa Helios is nearly done with his voyage across the sky, so Hebe takes her leave of the funny man, who bows again and bids farewell to the Lion Princess. She's skipping back to Artemis' camp, happy and in fine spirits, and won't find out the scope of the drama she's landed herself in until later.",

      "\"Oh yes, and very masterfully played, by the way,\" Hermes says with a wink.",

      "\"Oh, Hermes, don't be a pest,\" Hestia scolds him on Hebe's behalf, but she's smiling too.",
      "\"Look, it takes a thief to catch a thief, and I made my great debut on Olympus by overwhelming the mighty Zeus with my irresistible cuteness.",

      "Well, if anyone were to figure it out, these two are probably the safest.",

      "\"I'm gonna spike your drink with bitterwort,\" she informs him loftily.",
      "\"Your face is gonna go like this - \" she scrunches up her face in an impression of Hermes drinking the foul-tasting beverage, and then laughs as he scoops her up in the air and dangles her over the brook nearby, playfully growling threats to dunk her under.",
      "--------------------",
      "In short order, Hebe is given another duty - as Mama's attendant.",
      "She is there to assist Mama getting in and out of her chariot, when she goes afield: harnessing the gold-bridled horses and yoking them to the chariot, and watching in fascination as the gold-and-silver car races off, a wonder to behold.",
      "She assists Mama in dressing - mainly by fetching the prettiest baubles to decorate her lovely hands and neck - and brushes her hair.",
      "Mama returns this favor to her, brushing Hebe's hair 100 times until it's smooth and soft.",
      "Hebe stands by Mama's side in a formal court, along with her friend Iris, to fetch and retrieve anything Mama asks for, or to help her in any other way.",
      "This is something Hebe has always wanted to do also; but when the time comes and she is appointed, it's more out of necessity than because Hebe asked.",
      "Hebe is not, in fact, the only daughter of Zeus and Hera.",
      "But her sister, Eileithyia, is fading out of consciousness quite inconveniently early, and is not around to attend to Mama.",
      "The process isn't complete yet, but it's clear that Eileithyia is planning to do it.",
      "Anytime Hebe visits her sister's rooms, assuming Eileithyia is there at all, she can be found sitting in a misty, wavering form, in a kind of trance.",
      "She's attending to her duties metaphysically, which all of the gods and goddesses do - even Hebe, who certainly doesn't show up in person every time someone is feeling youthful.",
      "But Eileithyia has recently opted to conduct her business almost entirely metaphysically, and hasn't been socially available for quite some time.",
      "She got the idea from their Grandmama Rhea, who announced that she was leaving the conscious running of the universe to the younger generation, and began fading out.",
      "She embraced her eternal concept of motherhood and does not choose to wear her personality often anymore.",
      "Eileithyia thinks that's incredibly deep and meaningful and began doing the same thing, abandoning her personality and consciousness in favor of floating in her room.",
      "It's not like she's gone - you can even have a conversation with her if you're patient enough to wait three months for her to notice you've been greeting her.",
      "But she never has much to say, since she hasn't been doing anything in so long, so Hebe rarely bothers.",
      "\"You'll see, sweet little Hebe,\" she'd said last time, in a conversation that had taken nearly six hours to complete in spite of the lack of content.",
      "\"You'll get tired of all the drama, all the arguing, all the betrayals.",
      "You'll be right here with me where there's peace and silence.\"",
      "Very tiresome.",
      "Hebe thinks all the dramatics are exciting; and even if it's hard sometimes, it's all proof of how much her family really cares about things, about each other.",
      "This is a lesson that Auntie Hess imparted to her.",
      "Though she is Mama's attendant, Hebe spends more of her time at Auntie Hess' hearth than anywhere else.",
      "Auntie Hess, like Hebe, sees value in helping others, even if it's technically beneath her.",
      "Hebe, as a cupbearer and all-around welcome face on Olympus, is privy to many more secrets than the Olympians think they're letting on, and Aunt Hestia has told her that it's a great privilege and burden to be the secret-bearer, and that she must never use her knowledge to hurt her family.",
      "She even cautions her against using it for good, at least not overtly, in case she misreads a situation and makes it worse.",
      "Subtlety and kindness will help their family to stay together in spite of their willfulness and passion, says Aunt Hestia.",
      "\"Subtlety\" seems to be the key word, and Hebe doesn't mind being discreet and sneaky, but she isn't terribly impressed with the fact that it all amounts to being a sweet, well-behaved girl.",
      "Perhaps Hebe did inherit a tiny thirst for dramatics and excitement after all.",
      "-------------- Her next great act of rebellion is also passed off as a childish game; though it's increasingly a difficult concept to sell on her parents... or, more particularly, to Mama.",
      "\"But that's her greatest domain!\"",
      "Hebe pleads.",
      "\"She spends all her time with young girls, and has adventures with them!\"",
      "\"She spends all her time in the wilderness hunting bears and boars and fighting giants; and the girls tag along,\" Mama corrects, looking stern.",
      "Mama really doesn't like Artemis, and Artemis really doesn't like Mama.",
      "They've reached a sort of truce by way of Artemis staying in her wilds and rarely interacting with Mama; but if they spend any great amount of time together, the truce falls apart.",
      "It's a shame.",
      "Hebe loves Mama, but she likes Artemis a lot, too.",
      "She wants desperately to join the virgin goddess' band of girls, going out running around and hunting and playing, and if Hermes is to be believed (a great risk), there's wrestling and swearing!!",
      "Because they don't have to be ladies, if there aren't any boys around!",
      "Obviously, Hebe has responsibilities here on Olympus.",
      "She's the cupbearer, and after only a few short years on the job, everyone's already deemed the position as indispensable!",
      "And she's still Mama's main attendant, along with Iris.",
      "She needs to be able to help Mama with her chariot and her hair and jewelry.",
      "But she longs for the ability to run around, fastfastfast, surrounded by other girls her age, independent and wild and making noise.",
      "At least just once in a while!",
      "\"It might not be a bad idea, though,\" Papa says.",
      "\"Eileithyia doesn't look like she's going to be over this phase anytime soon, and Hebe needs other girls to play with.",
      "I know you don't... approve of Artemis, but after all, that's the domain she chose, and she takes it very seriously.\"",
      "Mama sighs, rubbing her temple.",
      "\"Oh, let me consider it a little longer.\"",
      "Papa looks at Hebe, quirks his mouth and shrugs.",
      "Hebe knows.",
      "After Kore - Queen Persephone, now - Papa has decided it's not in his best interest to call all the shots on his daughters' decisions.",
      "Particularly since Mama is considerably quicker to anger than even Aunt Demeter.",
      "But Hebe has been weaponizing her cuteness for a while now.",
      "Before she even spoke to Mama and Papa today, she approached Artemis with her plan, begging her to stay on the downlow for a while so Mama wouldn't have any hard reasons to disallow Hebe to join her.",
      "Artemis was amused but agreed.",
      "After all, she said, Zeus' daughters had to stick together.",
      "\"You should just threaten to rip out his chest hair if you don't get what you want, like I did!\"",
      "she adds.",
      "Hebe giggles.",
      "It takes Hera another year or so to make up her mind, but by the time Kore is back above the ground, Hebe is there to greet her, running with the nymphs Nephele and Siproites and Hyacinthia, shouting and whooping.",
      "-------------------- Hebe is a cheerful and happy girl.",
      "She loves her Mama and Papa.",
      "She loves her Aunts Demeter and Hestia; she loves her Uncle Poseidon and she likes writing letters to Uncle Hades, though she hasn't met him yet.",
      "She loves all her brothers and sisters, no matter which one or how they get along with each other.",
      "She loves Hephaestus' forge and his big, scary, friendly Cyclopes helpers and his pretty wife Aglaia.",
      "She loves Apollo and how he brings her paintings and sings songs with her and plays duck-duck-goose with the Muses.",
      "She loves playing dress-up with Aphrodite and her naughty, silly son Eros, and the mischief they make together.",
      "She loves playing trivia games with Athena and playing with her owl friend Bubo.",
      "She loves putting on makeup with Dionysus and teasing Pan together with him.",
      "She loves racing Hermes and jumping out to scare him.",
      "She loves Artemis and the nymphs, who are like her second, part-time family.",
      "She loves them all, and would not ever pick a favorite.",
      "But she does have to admit that she has a certain special closeness to her big brother Ares.",
      "They've all sort of learned to not call too much attention to the question of whose parents they have.",
      "Most of them are some combination of Papa - that is, Zeus, plus 'someone else.'",
      "Athena was born only of Papa; Hephy was born only of Mama.",
      "But Ares is the only other one who is the child of the King and Queen both.",
      "They are the royal children (well, and Eileithyia, but she's too busy being Wise and One With The Cosmos in her room.",
      "Hopeless.).",
      "Hebe and Ares don't have much else directly in common with each other.",
      "Ares is the god of war, courage, and manliness.",
      "He's argumentative and brash; noisy and prone to fighting.",
      "He's always caught up in drama - mostly, fighting with Athena and Hephaestus and Apollo and Papa and Mama... and, well, he definitely isn't the Joy of Olympus.",
      "Hebe and Ares both have the unenviable position no one else has, of being caught exactly in the middle of Mama and Papa.",
      "Mama and Papa both equally expect Hebe and Ares to take their side when they argue; a pressure that no one else has hanging over their heads.",
      "She knows that's at least part the reason Eileithyia chose to shut down.",
      "It's a very strained sort of loneliness.",
      "Hebe endures it because all of Olympus endeavors to keep her out of it; to keep her a happy child forever.",
      "She still feels the responsibility, though.",
      "Ares feels it, too, but his flat and brusque manner, combined with his total clumsy inability to read the emotions of a room, only serves to make everyone angry with him.",
      "Ares does not have what would be his rightful place as a Prince of Olympus.",
      "Hebe isn't sure she's ever heard anyone refer to him by the title.",
      "He's gone for a long time, often; off overseeing wars and uprisings and other occasions where men and women need him to bolster their resolve.",
      "When he returns, Hebe has drawn his bath.",
      "This is their routine.",
      "It probably is a little weird, and perhaps others would deem it inappropriate.",
      "But Olympus is fueled by unseemly behavior, and Hebe herself expresses her thoughts on the matter once: \"You really shouldn't be in here when I'm taking a bath,\" Ares says, keeping a cloth around him until he sinks beneath the sudsy water, heated courtesy of a few borrowed coals from Auntie's Hearth.",
      "Hebe shrugs.",
      "She's seen him naked before; the way the gods of Olympus strut around, it's impossible to avoid.",
      "A bit of a double standard, but the reality is no one really cares if they see a man's privates.",
      "A girl learns to roll her eyes and look the other way until they manage to find an improvised chlamys for modesty's sake.",
      "\"It's not like I'm looking, brother,\" she chides, pouring water over his head.",
      "\"And I'm afraid if I leave, you'll fall asleep in the tub and drown.\"",
      "He wasn't quite ready for the water on his head, and sputters before fixing her with a stinkeye which she ignores.",
      "His hair is... well, gross.",
      "Sweaty and dirty and with more than a little blood in it.",
      "She sighs and presses a small vial of scented oil into his hand.",
      "\"Use that on your nasty hair.\"",
      "He chuckles slightly.",
      "\"Nasty, eh?",
      "Yeah, I guess that's the word for it.\"",
      "In spite of his objection, he seems too tired to really care what she's doing or where she's standing.",
      "He leans back into the tub and half-heartedly works the oil into his hair.",
      "Hebe goes to the table where she's kept his clean clothes and waits there, eyes politely looking to the window where she can see Selene and Artemis in the night sky.",
      "\"You look beat to hell, brother,\" she says, striving to always speak honestly.",
      "He laughs again, a bit louder and more sincere this time.",
      "\"Do I?",
      "Where'd you learn to talk like that, kid?\"",
      "\"I've learned a lot from Artemis' nymphs.",
      "Words like fuck, shit, bugger, cunt - \" she recites proudly.",
      "\"Okay, okay!",
      "Cut it out!",
      "People will think I've been teaching you that shit!\"",
      "Ares is still laughing to himself.",
      "\"Sheesh.",
      "One season with Arty and you're already swearing like an Amazon.\"",
      "\"She says once in a while you two hunt together.",
      "Invite me along next time?\"",
      "He's quiet for a while, and Hebe wonders if he's fallen asleep.",
      "He really does look beat to hell.",
      "He'd shuffled into the bath like an old man with all his aches; begrimed and cut up and tired.",
      "There's an unguent from Apollo's stock here in this room; maybe she can try to apply it to some of the uglier-looking bruises and swellings and cuts before he puts on his clean chiton and cloak.",
      "Ares finally answers.",
      "\"Yeah, maybe.",
      "Might be nice having another sister tagging along.\"",
      "----------------------------- There's a certain equilibrium she's managed to achieve, and for the most part she's satisfied.",
      "She's still everyone's favorite child-princess; the delight of Olympus and the innocent playmate who stays removed from the drama.",
      "But she's apprenticed to Hestia, and knows the gossip and how to gently steer her hotheaded family away from dangerous situations and conversations.",
      "And she's gained employment, as a cupbearer and as Mama's attendant and one of Artemis' part-time virgin retinue.",
      "It's not quite as spectacular as her brothers or sisters' roles; but she isn't really ambitious.",
      "She's managed to sneak her way out of the vapid part everyone wanted her to play, and did so in a way that left no one with any major words to remark upon.",
      "No one speaks poorly of her, of course; but her domains and accomplishments are so subtle that no one thinks to praise them either.",
      "Pericles, had he been born yet, would surely approve.",
      "And she might have been content with this forever, had she not strayed a little further from Artemis' party than she meant to, one day.",
      "It's a fine, sunny day and Hebe hears the sound of a lyre on the wind.",
      "Curious, she follows the sound - maybe it's Apollo?",
      "But, Apollo's music is generally so beautiful that her feet begin dancing all of their own will.",
      "This music isn't Apollo-class.",
      "To be completely honest, it's really bad.",
      "She comes across a man who appears to be in his late twenties or early thirties, sitting atop a rock overseeing a large herd of cattle and plucking idly at a lyre.",
      "He's... not particularly beautiful.",
      "Not the way her brothers are... he's one of the biggest men she's ever seen, nearly as large as her brother Ares when he takes mortal form.",
      "Just this huge, plain-looking man sitting on a rock, watching a lot of cows, and playing the lyre badly.",
      "She really can't place what it is that intrigues her, only that... he seems interesting, somehow.",
      "His face looks kind.",
      "And he looks.... Fun.",
      "Her curiosity finally compels her to step forward and shout to catch his attention.",
      "\"Hey there!",
      "You, man!",
      "What do you call yourself?\"",
      "He looks up, unsurprised to see her - he must have known she was hiding all along.",
      "Normally this would annoy her very much.",
      "But the easy grin on his face settles any injury to her pride.",
      "\"Hey there, yourself!",
      "I call myself Alcides, thank you for your interest!\"",
      "he calls back.",
      "\"And if I may ask, what do you call yourself?\"",
      "\"You may not ask!",
      "It's a secret!\"",
      "she informs him, having the sense not to give her name away to strange men.",
      "He only laughs, unoffended.",
      "\"Very well.",
      "May I call you Lion Princess for now?",
      "Since you roar so fiercely, yet have such a regal bearing?\"",
      "She tries not to show how pleased she is.",
      "\"I suppose it will do.\"",
      "She comes closer still.",
      "\"What are you doing out here?\"",
      "\"I'm watching my father Amphitryon's cattle and killing time with a lyre.\"",
      "\"Killing music in general with that lyre!\"",
      "He laughs again.",
      "\"Harsh little Lion Princess!",
      "Well, you may be right, I'm not very good at it yet, am I?",
      "I was always getting beaten by my music master about it.\"",
      "\"That's too bad.",
      "He probably wasn't a good teacher.\"",
      "Alcides shrugs.",
      "\"I think my talents lie elsewhere than music.",
      "But it's fun to play anyway, sometimes, don't you think, Lion Princess?",
      "Even if I'm not the best at it.\"",
      "He likes fun for its own sake.",
      "Hebe grins back at him.",
      "\"I do think so!",
      "And I'm glad you're enjoying yourself, even if you're a terrible musician!",
      "But Alcides, what are your talents, then?",
      "Looking at cows?\"",
      "\"I'm great at looking at cows!",
      "No one's better!\"",
      "he puts his chest out exaggeratedly as he boasts, making her laugh.",
      "\"But actually, I think my greatest talent might be... discus.",
      "Do you play, Lion Princess?\"",
      "She claps her hands excitedly.",
      "\"Yes!",
      "Have you got one on you now?",
      "Throw it here!\"",
      "He softballs it, of course, but she'll let it slide for now.",
      "Hebe's only excited to be playing the game.",
      "She races across the lawn, dodging stray cows and catching the discus triumphantly while Alcides cheers.",
      "Hebe flings it back at him.",
      "He catches it - but pretends that the force of her throw knocked him backwards, clear off the rock.",
      "She laughs again and runs over to see where he's fallen - only to shriek in surprise as he jumps out from behind the rock to scare her.",
      "Alcides laughs along with her, not unkindly - just as though he's sharing the joke with her, and he graciously accepts it when she flings a fistful of weeds at him.",
      "\"You - you rascal!\"",
      "she scolds around her mirth.",
      "Alcides bows deeply.",
      "\"Guilty as charged, Lion Princess.\"",
      "They throw the discus back and forth a few times, and Hebe teaches him the simple notes to a song she likes - a little composition about a bee and a bear.",
      "Alcides teaches her a joke about a man who was outwitted by his donkey.",
      "They formally exchange gifts - he gives her a shiny pebble, in an unusual color of green; she gives him a chain of clovers.",
      "Grandpa Helios is nearly done with his voyage across the sky, so Hebe takes her leave of the funny man, who bows again and bids farewell to the Lion Princess.",
      "She's skipping back to Artemis' camp, happy and in fine spirits, and won't find out the scope of the drama she's landed herself in until later."

    "text": "The following day is overcast, as it has been for days now. The journey from Limnos to Mount Olympus is a long one - at least, it is for two outcast gods, who have to travel the tedious way, by boat and by foot. No flying chariots for them. The journey takes several days... long enough for several gods to notice them, including Hermes, who has certainly gone back to report to Zeus. \"I hate him,\" Hephaestus mutters defiantly, referring to the quick-flashing form of Hermes as he vanishes towards the mountain. \"Smooth-talking asshole who thinks he can just tell a few jokes and make it like nothing ever happened.\" Dionysus adores Hermes, personally; but he can see why Hephaestus might not. \"I know, darling,\" he says, pouring another cup of wine and offering it. In the sky, the clouds grow darker, and a low rumble of thunder can be heard, even from this distance. It's a long enough journey that Hephaestus could lose his nerve easily, especially with the ominous brontide for ambiance. Dionysus produces wine more or less continuously to keep Heph on track - the mood is no longer as buoyant as it was in the grotto, but for the first couple of days, it's still good-ish, flavored with a lot of gallows humor. \"I guess I'll be in good company in Tartarus, right?\" Hephaestus will say. \"Finally get to meet some family there.\" Or, \"Maybe they haven't even seen an ugly person before. Up on their ivory tower. They'll be so confused that they won't even know how to react.\" Dionysus counters these with some jokes about how after it's all finally over, he and Heph can celebrate with a real party, complete with sexy satyrs and rowdy maenads, and Dionysus can finally show him how it's really done. Maybe some of the other gods will even beg to join them, and Dionysus will let Heph make the call. Mount Olympus is visible long before they even reach shore, looming over all the surrounding land, and the peaks are shrouded in dark stormclouds. It's here that Hephaestus' nerve finally starts to fail him. \"This is really bad,\" he says, as Dionysus helps him across the sand. He's stumbling a little, still drunk. He says it as though he hadn't really realized, in spite of all their talk before, and it's possible he didn't. He's been locked up in that grotto, making jewelry and living metal assistants and hasn't ever taken an action before that had consequences to anyone. \"It's not great,\" Dionysus says, leading him to where his donkey waiting. \"But honestly, from what I can tell, this is just another bump in the road for the Olympians. They're always at each other's throats.\" He thinks this might be true, but he also doesn't know if he's ever heard of such a successful attack on an Olympian before. And on Queen Hera herself, from within their stronghold in Zeus' palace! Without question, Zeus is Not Happy. Regardless, it won't help the situation at large or Hephaestus in particular to dwell on how he's attacked the queen and enraged the king. Dionysus wrestles Hephaestus atop the donkey, and they head out towards the mountain. It's now as dark as though it's night, and it stays that way for the entire duration of the climb. It takes two full days. On the night when they stop to allow the donkey to rest, it begins raining, and Hephaestus finally confesses it: \"I really don't want to go,\" he says quietly. He's been fidgeting with the head of his cane obsessively for the last few hours. \"I know, darling,\" Dionysus says, sitting beside him. He's no longer feeding Hephaestus wine; Heph is going to need to be sober when he enters the palace. With no more liquid courage to fuel him, all he has is a vague sense that he needs to fix this before Zeus decides to fix it for him... that, and the smoldering coals of the anger that drove him to do it in the first place. Dionysus suspects that those coals will flare up on their own during the confrontation; no need to tend to those. Nor is it the right time anymore, for a joke about a bracing blowjob before they head up; or a celebratory fuck afterwards. So he holds Hephaestus' hand instead. \"You're doing what needs to be done, Heph. You wanted this; you wanted to make them take notice of you. Now it's just a matter of following through on your resolve. I get it; I'm pretty much doing the same thing. We'll see it done. I'm with you.\" Hephaestus keeps his face away, leaning his forehead against the donkey's shoulder, but tightens his grip on Dionysus' hand. The thunder rolls overhead, no longer in the distance but dangerously close.",

    "text": "Hermes ties the knots on the soft hemp rope that criss-crosses Ares' naked torso. This particular experiment has turned out to be a lot of effort. Ares has been kneeling there for a while now, alternating between watching Hermes carefully, and sitting with his eyes closed and breathing deeply. The thing is, shibari requires so much patience. Hermes is substantially more patient than people give him credit for, but Ares... well, Hermes is amazed at how long he's been kneeling there quietly. He's held perfectly still for at least fifteen minutes now, while Hermes passes the rope over and around, checking it's not too snug or too loose, constantly narrating the process to himself. It's not that Hermes needs to hear his own voice; but it seems to put Ares more at ease. The Aloadai and their jar left their mark on Ares; and after the public humiliation of Hephaestus and the invisible chains, Ares now has a Problem with being restrained. He's doing well for the moment though. And, while Hermes absolutely meant it that he would undo them at the first sign Ares wanted out... he's glad Ares hasn't given the word. This is more than a little hot. The ropes loop over Ares' shoulders, forming a kind of a V-shape as it knots in the center of his chest and also in the center of his back, perfectly framed between the powerfully defined shoulder blades. The ropes span out across the muscles of his chest, meeting again just under his armpits, where they encircle and knot around his upper arms, binding them to his sides. Hermes is actually an old pro at Shibari, but it's taking him forever this time because he wants Ares to be able to observe the whole process.... and, well, because it's so distracting. Ares is gorgeous. Hermes finds himself trailing off as he crouches beside the nude god. Ares never lets Hermes this close; at least, certainly not in a quiet moment like this... The feel of his rock-hard muscles, flesh hot beneath Hermes' fingers. The sight of the knot in the center of his back, highlighting the perfect inverted triangle of Ares' torso. The way he holds himself like a perfect statue... back straight, still as stone... Hermes moves around back, then slyly gives Ares' flawless butt a little pinch. This breaks the statue look, finally, as Ares jumps a little. \"Ow! Hey!\" He finally scowls over his shoulder at Hermes. The annoyance is familiar and endearing, and far preferable to that stoic nervousness. Hermes grins winningly. \"Cmon, Ares, you think I can keep my hands off a butt like that?\" It works; Ares scoffs and some of the tension goes out of his back. \"Now you mention it. Hard to believe you went so long without being a pest.\" Hermes could have gone a lot longer without being a pest - he knows how to dial it back when the sexy mood requires it. But he suspects that in Ares' case, a little levity would make him feel more at ease. The next \"layer\" of the ropework involves creating a belt of sorts - knotted over Ares' lower back, and looping around to form another knot directly over his belly button. Hermes pokes his finger into the shallow well a couple of times, giving Ares a wide-eyed \"who, me?\" look at the squirm and glare that result. The knotwork completes by braiding a little chain of sorts, of the knot over Ares' back, allowing some length for comfort before binding Ares' wrists together. The end result... is breathtaking. Ares, god of war, kneels naked on the rug in his room, trussed in the soft rope that forms a harness around his chest, arms and back. Hermes knows very well that Ares would find it difficult to break out if these ropes - perhaps he can't break out at all, for all the god's strength. Ares surely knows it too. He looks a little bit shaky... but he's still kneeling before Hermes, quietly and submissively. That total implied trust humbles Hermes. Ares sat patiently and allowed Hermes to do this: to render him helpless. Hermes knows the fears tumbling in the back of Ares' brain - the awareness that Hermes could harm or humiliate him. And yet Ares sat patiently, of his own accord, and submitted to being here, tied up under Hermes' hands. \"All done,\" Hermes says, only a little bit hoarsely. Ares tests the ropes. His muscles strain very enticingly - but they don't yield at all. \"Took you long enough,\" he mutters. Hermes kneels behind Ares, hands on his shoulders. \"Yeah... I underestimated the difficulty in tying a billion knots when the person underneath me is so physically perfect....that I wanted the knots to be done already, so I could just touch him... stroke his skin, kiss it, worship it...\" Ares' breathing has is getting deep and shaky, though it's unclear if that's one of his aroused tells, or nerves. Or maybe he's doing it on purpose because he knows taking a deeper breath strains at the ropes and is making Hermes go nearly faint at the sight of it. \"Ares,\" he says softly, whispering into his friend's ear. \"You're doing so great, I hope you know that.\" He doesn't elaborate on how proud he is... it's for the best not to mention the shadows of the jar and chains. Plus, Ares doesn't know how to handle compliments very well in any situation. True to form, Ares scoffs and looks away. \"Whatever. I know it's dumb.\" \"Ahaha, no. Not dumb. That's not the word I'd choose.\" Hermes slides his hands a little lower down, fingers catching on the knots as they trail down to play at Ares hips. Ares twitches, breathing harder. Hermes murmurs again: \"I know this is your thing, you're trying to get used to it, and I don't want to steal your moment. But Ares, buddy, if you feel up to it, I want your dick in my mouth so bad right now.\" This startles Ares into a bark of laughter. \"You're such a pervy little shit!\" \"I don't know what you want me to tell you, man. I got this amazingly hot guy here, all tied up and I've had my hands on his skin for the last half hour without allowing myself to cop a feel-\" \"You totally copped a feel! More than once!\" Ares is almost genuinely relaxed now - still a bit jittery, though; but Hermes knows a way to deal with that. He plays his fingers a little lower; over Ares' bare thighs. \"What do you say? Want me to add a little zest to the experience?\" Ares snorts, then pauses, considering. Hermes waits. \".... I guess... that would make this seem... better...\" he offers hesitantly, and even through his ramping arousal Hermes can feel his heart swell at the vulnerability. \"Oh, I'll make a positive memory out of this, you bet,\" he promises, easing Ares carefully down to the rug.",
