    "text": "Hey you guys, this is an epilogue about how Thanatos and Melody meet. It's a one shot and I'm rating it T for sexual content, but it might be M. I'm not the best judge when it comes to stuff like this. But I hope you guys enjoy. -Marty *********************************************************************************************************************************************************** My eyes bounced back and forth, grasping everything in my sight. It was dark and cold, but my skin couldn't help but tingle at the thought of the mysteries ahead of me. \"So this is the Underworld,\" I asked my teacher Lily. Some of Lily's dark red hair fell in front of her, as she turned to look at me. \"Yes, but don't get to excited Melody. It's a fairly basic job, were servants to the dead and their rulers.\" I rolled my eyes, how could she be so bland about the Underworld! It's so different and magical, I love it, why doesn't she? After a few more turns and long narrow halls, we ended up going through a died jet black oak door, that led to the kitchen. \"Can you cook,\" Lilly called over her shoulder. \"No, my servants did that for me,\" I replied while spinning on my toes, letting my blonde curls fly about me. Wow this kitchen is huge, how many people are here? I leaped with excitement; I always wanted to try cooking! Then as I leaped again, my body hit a hard cold figure. My knees fall onto the stone ground, and I look up to find Lily's aggravated face staring down at me. \"I don't get it, you were better than all of us, but for some reason instead of choosing the Elysium Fields you decided you wanted to partake in servant work,\" she questioned me with eyes hardening at each word she spoke. I pressed my palms against the stone and stood up straight and tall, almost making myself bigger than Lily. \"I wanted to help. My past life was short; I was spoiled and had no real life. Now I want to change that, by becoming a servant and tending for others.\" It was now her turn to roll her eyes at me, \"Whatever, just start chopping those onions.\" Someone's misses happy-go-lucky. *********************************************************************************************************************************************************** I glanced up at the clock, 8:02p.m. \"Megan we have the chicken ready,\" I called to my server. I loved being assistant chef, it only took a few weeks to make it here, and every day I felt as if I was helping more and more, than I ever did on solid land above. I handed the dish to her, not before noticing the new purplish blue mark on the new server's neck. Men, always breaking the woman's souls, I thought bitterly. \"Hey Melody can you grab some more tarragon from the pantry,\" called Sam who was the head chef of the kitchen. \"Of course,\" I called, not before giving the old plump man a smile. As I headed down the hall with my uniform of navy, I waved to everyone single person that strolled by. I knew everyone and was friends with about everyone, I couldn't have asked for a better after life. But as soon as I ran into him, I knew everything would change. I pulled the jar of tarragon from his shelf and right as I turned around I hit something hard like stone. My neck slowly went up, until I finally saw the deathening faced man in front of me. His face though gorgeous with well-rounded features and deep dimples, I still got an uncomfortable vibe from him. \"I'm very sorry Sir,\" I replied apologetically, as my legs bent into a curtsy. \"No need to apologize, so who are you,\" he asked in his rugged voice. That's when I knew I was a goner. I loved everything about being a helper of the Underworld, except I despised helping in this area, the area of the needs of lustful men. \"Melody, and you Sir?\" Sweat began to form on my body and my heart raced so fast that I was sure he could hear it. \"I'm Thanatos, God of the Dead, you are a servant I presume,\" he replied while lightly pulling up the shoulder of my uniform. \"Yes my Lord,\" I answered. He gave me a crooked smile and then before my eyes could even blink he closed the pantry door. \"So you're a dead servant, who works for Hades and specializes in the kitchen, am I correct Melody?\" I crossed my arms over my body and tried my hardest not to swallow my saliva, since it was the only thing keeping my mouth dry. \"Correct my Lord,\" I practically whispered. He knelt before me and began sliding his way up my leg, until he hit my thigh, \"May I,\" he surprisingly asked me. I felt my body twist with horror, I should have known that I wouldn't have stayed a virgin down here forever. My body shook as I questioned him with, \"What happens if I say no?\" \"Then I stop.\" I searched the eyes below me, finding truth wrapped in them. \"But if you say no remember this, there will be others who will come along and ask you for the same thing. But they won't ask, they will steal,\" he inserted. \"Then what benefit do I get if I accept you?\" He let out a snicker and cooed, \"I could get people to believe that you're some property, then no man or God would dare touch you, how does that sound?\" I thought back to the staff, I remembered the marks on each ones neck, and how some disappeared for a while. I knew he was telling the truth, but could he really save me from beginning a toy to all. I guess that's a risk I'll have to take. \"I accept you offer,\" I nearly cried. He gave me a satisfied smile and pulled me down so I was to my knees with him. Then he pressed his body and put his full lips to my ear and whispered, \"Don't worry I'll make it worth your while.\" Before I could even ask him what he was referring to, he had already pressed his smooth lips to mine. I felt like I needed to scream and run away, but I had made my choice, now I had to lay in it. As he stuck his tongue down further into my throat, he began then to pull off my underwear. When it was finally around my ankles he pressed my back to the floor and finally undid his pants and stripped himself of his underwear. Before he entered me, he explored every single part of my body; squeezing my butt, playing with my perky breasts, and lastly inserting his fingers in and out of my womanhood, making me squirm with discomfort. Finally after what felt like a lifetime he created a new game that involved the loss of my virginity. As he plunged himself further in, it made me get a need to puke. So to keep myself from vomiting all over the God of Death, I started to think of the rhythm, up down, up down, just like a horse in full gallop. \"One last thing,\" he more whispered to my covered breast, then me. He brought my collar down and pressed his mouth right where the rising of my breast lay. He pulled his manhood out of me and drug his body off of mine, so he could throw back on his clothes. While he changed, I just laid there half-naked on the floor. I so badly wished he would disappear and let me cry my river of despair and shame. \"Come Melody, we must both go,\" he instated, while hauling me to my feet. \"I will have one of my servant's reward you tonight with a token of my gratitude, and of my protection.\" I only nodded; for I was too crushed and humiliated to do or say anything. Sure I might have saved my skin, but was this shame worth it? Which is better, to be with one and have a choice? Or to be caught off guard and be known as a slut for all? *********************************************************************************************************************************************************** That night a servant came into the cook's chambers and presented me with a ruby necklace, that had an engraving T in the center ruby. As I wore it, I noticed the stares changed, now it wasn't a glance of lust, but now a glance of fear. I was free of being stuck in another man's bed, but being the stupid girl I was I didn't think of the cost this necklace really was. For weeks I would be visited by him, bed by him, loved by him, and gifted by him. After each time he came I began to grow more enchanted by the desires and techniques of loving. Each time he came was some new treasure for me. Each better than the first, till finally one day I received the one thing I wasn't expecting. I diced up the tomatoes for the salad that night. As I was dicing I felt a quick surge of pleasure as Thanatos shoved his fingers up my hole. \"Thanatos,\" I purred in pleasure. \"Melody I'm glad to have found you here,\" he cooed, then he drew his fingers out so he could taste the liquid I released. \"I bet you are, now are you here for the usual,\" I ask seductively. He gave me a devious smile that reached his dark golden eyes, and he slid his arm behind my back so he could press our chests together. \"Actually I'm here to ask you something.\" My eyebrows came together in confusion, and I gave him an unsure face. \"What do you have to ask me, Thanatos? He lifted open his black cape that matched his floor length toga, and he unwrapped his arm from my back and reached his hand into it, to pull out two unique necklaces. One had white pearls and some type of light purple gems attached to it. Then the other was a long silver chain that at the end held an iron key. Out of human reaction, I tilted my head to stare at it in wonder. \"Why thank you my Lord, but what is the key for?\" \"The key is for your new private chambers, and so you can enter my room whenever you please, the other one is accept or decline necklace,\" he replied with a hint of excitement in his voice. \"So what am I accepting,\" I piped with enthusiasm. \"Well would you being willing to accept becoming my one and only mistress,\" he asked with a bit of edge. My body hardened at his words. A few months ago I would have accepted out of the want to only be touched and harmed by one person, but I now I wanted to accept so I could become all his, so I could be the leading mistress who brought him pleasure, that only I was able to create. \"I gladly accept the title,\" I chirped with glee. His dark eyes brightened at my words, and his smile grew. He attached the pearled choker necklace to my neck, and then draped the key around my neck, letting it go high enough so it gently made a thud against my new velvet navy uniform, that contained crystal designs. \"My Mistress Melody, I'm glad you have accepted my offer, now I will have the usual,\" he purred. As he did me in the kitchen, I knew my life was going to change even more. Now I was Thanatos's mistress and lover. And I wouldn't say it out loud, but I knew I was madly in love with this energetic, hilarious man. Who will one day forever be mine? *********************************************************************************************************************************************************** Well that was my one shot and keep on looking out for new one shots, and hopefully next week I'll have a new chapter for you guys! Also I got the idea from SweetSacrifice1421, check out her work! Please comment, and keep on reading fan fiction!",

      "I only nodded; for I was too crushed and humiliated to do or say anything.",
      "Sure I might have saved my skin, but was this shame worth it?",
      "Which is better, to be with one and have a choice?",
      "Or to be caught off guard and be known as a slut for all?",

      "I was free of being stuck in another man's bed, but being the stupid girl I was I didn't think of the cost this necklace really was.",
      "For weeks I would be visited by him, bed by him, loved by him, and gifted by him.",
      "After each time he came I began to grow more enchanted by the desires and techniques of loving.",
      "Each time he came was some new treasure for me.",

      "He gave me a devious smile that reached his dark golden eyes, and he slid his arm behind my back so he could press our chests together.",

      "My eyebrows came together in confusion, and I gave him an unsure face.",
      "\"What do you have to ask me, Thanatos?",
      "He lifted open his black cape that matched his floor length toga, and he unwrapped his arm from my back and reached his hand into it, to pull out two unique necklaces.",
      "One had white pearls and some type of light purple gems attached to it.",
      "Then the other was a long silver chain that at the end held an iron key.",
      "Out of human reaction, I tilted my head to stare at it in wonder.",
      "\"Why thank you my Lord, but what is the key for?\"",
      "\"The key is for your new private chambers, and so you can enter my room whenever you please, the other one is accept or decline necklace,\" he replied with a hint of excitement in his voice.",
      "\"So what am I accepting,\" I piped with enthusiasm.",
      "\"Well would you being willing to accept becoming my one and only mistress,\" he asked with a bit of edge.",
      "My body hardened at his words.",
      "A few months ago I would have accepted out of the want to only be touched and harmed by one person, but I now I wanted to accept so I could become all his, so I could be the leading mistress who brought him pleasure, that only I was able to create.",
      "\"I gladly accept the title,\" I chirped with glee.",
      "His dark eyes brightened at my words, and his smile grew.",
      "He attached the pearled choker necklace to my neck, and then draped the key around my neck, letting it go high enough so it gently made a thud against my new velvet navy uniform, that contained crystal designs.",
      "\"My Mistress Melody, I'm glad you have accepted my offer, now I will have the usual,\" he purred.",
      "As he did me in the kitchen, I knew my life was going to change even more.",
      "Now I was Thanatos's mistress and lover.",

    "text": "Hey you guys, this is another one shot on Aphrodite's and Hephaestus, and it's based after a guest's request, so here is you answer to the request! So I hope you people enjoy another cute one shot of them! -Marty *********************************************************************************************************************************************************** I thought ignoring him would be easy, like ignoring the words to a truthful poem, a poem that you know is being told of you, but you just throw it away, so you don't have to think of the right or wrong. But who knew you couldn't just throw the poem into a fire and think all the words and marks would disappear, once the words are down in black ink, there forever written. My problems started with our marriage, I had always been free, never bound or tied to anything, especially holy words. But even with the binding, I still broke free, unknowing that it would break him, for he loved me, somehow despite my faults. But these moments only brought guilty, it wasn't till I had my husband's, brother's, son Eros did I feel truly guilty. \"Eros,\" I called from my lover Ares temple. Today was my son's first lesson on shooting his love arrow, even though he was young, it couldn't help but get him started off early. \"Who are you calling for,\" a husky voice asked from behind me. I gracefully turned around to find Ares in an unkept state; his hair was unbrushed, his toga hanging terribly on him, and finally his yellowed teeth, that were reeking of alcohol. \"Well our son Eros,\" I replied in annoyance. I told him I would come by today twenty times for the last two weeks, how could he forget so easily? \"Oh, Eros isn't here,\" he said frankly. \"Why?\" Ares began rubbing his behind his neck, and he gave me an apologetic face. \"What did you do,\" I spat bitterly. \"Well I was trying to show Eros war strategies and give him combat practice, but... He kept on complaining about wanting to make something or go for a walk in the fresh air. It's just I try to bond with him and he makes it so difficult so I...\" My hands clenched together and my teeth set straight, I tried my hardest to control my bubbling temper. \"So you did what?!\" \"I yelled at him, and called him a pathetic woos, and then I threw a vase at his arm,\" he mumbled. My eyes began to water, and I burned with rage, how dare he hurt my son like that. \"You bitter monster, how dare you do that to my son,\" I scream. His head snapped up and fire burned through his eyes, \"He's our son!\" \"No, he is mine, you ever go near him again, and I swear you will regret it.\" I turned away from Ares and called over my shoulder, \"If he forgives and wants to see you then fine, but for now, leave my son alone.\" *********************************************************************************************************************************************************** I head back to my temple to grab some stuff before looking for my son, but when I get there, I hear my husband Hephaestus gently speaking with someone. \"One more wrap around should do the work,\" he commented. I turned the corner that lead to the garden, and saw husband with white gnaws, that he was wrapped carefully around Eros. \"There we go,\" he finished wrapping my sons arm up and chirped, \"give it a week and your arm with be good as new.\" Eros cubby baby face was lite up and he wrapped his twig like arms around Hephaestus sturdy structure. The next words Eros said were very faint, but clear of enough to understand, \"Thank you Dad, you're the best.\" Hephaestus face had a hint of shock mixed into it, and mine tripled the shock of his. I watched closely as Eros realized his mistake, and he quickly pulled his head away from my husband's cheat and began to stutter, \"I'm sorry, I meant...\" Before Eros could even finish, Hephaestus interjected, \"its ok Eros, I love as if you were my own son.\" My son's already wet, golden eyes began to water again with tears of love and acceptance. At the sight of them; as father and son, it even made me break down into silent tears. I felt glad and guilty; I wanted Eros to have a father he loved, but I felt guilty that the father he chose was the one I cheated on every single day. It wasn't till I felt a hot breath on my bare neck did I realize someone was there. I glance up to find my husband holding my little eight year old boy in his sturdy arms. They both had concern written on their faces, and I tried my best to hold back the tears that still wanted to pour out. \"Are you ok mom?\" \"Of course, it's just one of those moments where I'm being silly,\" I cooed. I reached out for my son and Hephaestus carefully handed him over without question. \"So are you ready for your arrow lessons?\" Eros glanced back at Hephaestus and when he turned back around he had his lower lip sticking out and his eyes big to make him appear as a puppy dog. \"Can I please do it tomorrow? Dad said I could help him make a sword in his workshop. Please can I do that instead,\" he pleads. I glanced at my husband to see his eyes shine bright at his new title as a father. \"Fine, but tomorrow were going to have your bow and arrow lessons, got it,\" I stated. \"Got it,\" he purred. He wriggled out of my arms and pulled Hephaestus with him, towards his workshop. \"Thanks mom!\" A light smile pranced across my face, and watched them hand in hand, as any father and son would. After they disappear behind a marble column, I turn on the balls of my feet, and head for our guest room, so I can make Eros a room of his own. *********************************************************************************************************************************************************** A few weeks passed since my son Eros moved in with my husband and me. I love him staying with us, being able to kiss my son goodnight and keep him safe, it's every mothers dream to keep their child safe and have them grow up to become something incredible. Of course with everything, there's always some type of price to pay, my price was that I couldn't disappear as much as I use to, especially after the first week of my sons staying. I ran my soft delicate hands through my lightly blonde hair. I watched in the mirror as my curls fell down my back and bounced in a perfect form. Tonight was just like any other night; I was heading out to a party, where I hoped to get drunk and dirty for a few hours. I could already feel the poison run down my throat, and feel the grabby hands of men trying to spend the night with me, the Goddess of love. Right as I put just a few more touched on my flawless skin; I heard the usual faint knock at the door. \"Hephaestus,\" I called. The door squeaked open and in came my giant of a husband. \"Are you going out tonight,\" he asked carelessly. \"Yes,\" I answered from my golden vanity. I turned my head to my husband and rested my chin on the top of my hand crafted chair. \"You do realize that this is your room and that you don't need to knock every single time you need to come in?\" \"I just want to give you respect and privacy,\" he commented. A light-heated laugh escaped my mouth, and I slowly got up and strode towards my husband. \"Hephaestus I am the Goddess of love after all, do you really think I care when others see me naked.\" I pulled of the shoulders to my toga and let the fabric all to my stomach, showing off my perky full breast. He lifted his gaze and tried to keep his eyes off my chest. \"You know you can look.\" His eyes hovered at my neck and finally he took a swift glance at them. \"Their very nice,\" he replied uncomfortably. Hephaestus and I had only had sex on our wedding night, and that was a quickie, in and out. But it wasn't until now that I realized how much I liked a man more when he was squirming. \"You know Hephaestus, I can go tomorrow night if you want,\" I purred at him while sliding my hands down the inside of his pants. I felt the sweat drip onto my hands making me even more excited. But in one quick motion he pulled away from me, leaving me in shock. \"I'm sorry I can't Aphrodite,\" he muttered. My body froze there for a few moments, then when some of the shock vanished I began pulling up my toga and fixing my damp hair. How dare he reject me, I'm his wife. I turned away from him hoping he would leave to let me cry in humiliation alone. \"Aphrodite, I'm sorry it's just...\" His words were cut off when Eros came flying into the room crying. Both my husband and I pouched to my son to comfort him. \"What's' wrong,\" we ask simultaneously. Through a load of sobs Eros cried out, \"I had a nightmare where everyone was mad at me for having Hades steal the goddess of the harvest's daughter. Demeter doesn't even have a daughter, but everyone said it was my fault that the earth went cold since I shot Hades in the heart making him fall for some Demeter's daughter. There were just all so mean!\" Both Hephaestus and I eyes connect, since Demeter did just have a daughter named Persephone, but this was just a dream after all so it probably isn't ever going to be real. \"Also she snapped at me for calling her name stupid, I mean what person names their kid Persephone,\" he whined. Oh Fates you are cruel. Both my husband and I gave the face like just go along with it. \"Honey it was just a dream, I mean you would never do something like that, and besides Demeter doesn't have a daughter silly,\" I softly replied. Oh Demeter's going to skin him alive. \"It was just a dream my son.\" Eros golden eyes looked up at Hephaestus and he asked, \"You promise.\" Hephaestus gave him a smile and ran his worn fingers through his curly straw berry blonde hair. \"I promise, and if you want to you can spend the night in my room just in case you have another nightmare, sound good?\" \"Yeah, I like the sound of that, are you going to stay with us mom,\" he asked with hope shinning in his eyes. \"Yeah, of course, just let me get ready. While I'm getting ready you two can go and pick out a story to read.\" \"Awesome,\" my son piped. As my son raced out Hephaestus called out to him, \"I'll be there in a minute.\" After he closed the door, he turned and faced me. \"Aphrodite I'm...\" \"It's ok, really I'm fine,\" I replied while trying to hold back my tears of humiliation. I glanced at the ground hoping again that he would disappear, but he did something that caught even me off guard. He came over and pulled my chin up so I could face him square in the eyes. His dark brown eyes were guarded but his emotions showed when he brought my lips to his. We stayed like that for a good minute till he pulled away. \"Hephaestus,\" he nodded his head at the call of his name, \"let me have you.\" With that he pressed my face harder into his making me lose my breath. We kissed with passion and during our kiss we began removing each others clothes till we were down to nothing. He picked me up and brought me to the bed where he accidentally threw me too hard on cause of excitement, but I didn't care. He got on top of me and began entering me with quick painless thrusts. I was drowning in his touch and caressing that made my head spin like a top. It felt so good; it even felt better than his brother Ares. He was stronger and more lost it the matter, which made even me lost, making me loves this even more with him. Who knew Hephaestus had this in him. Out loving making broke when we heard Eros voice call from the other side of the door, \"Are you guys ready yet?\" We both threw ourselves off the bed and to where our clothes lay, we quickly threw them on ourselves and we both called out, \"Were ready!\" Eros bounced in and he asked, \"What took you guys so long, you were in here for five minutes.\" I quickly answered with, \"Fixing up my hair and Hephaestus was shaving.\" He looked us up and down and frankly said, \"You guys didn't do a very good job at it.\" Lucky he only asked that, making our five minutes an easy secret to keep. After that night, I never left in the middle of the night for a party; I always stayed in bed waiting Hephaestus to come in, so we could have a little fun for ourselves. I still cheated on him, but not as much as I use to. But when I did it was usually with Hermes or Apollo, use to be Ares but when he hurt my son I ended all ties with him. *********************************************************************************************************************************************************** It was three months later since Eros has his nightmare, and in those three months I had gained some weight. I tried my hardest to slide my tight tunic over my stomach, but I just ended up ripping it from the effort. I let out a wine of frustration and cried out, \"Seriously, this was my favorite tunic! Stupid weight gain!\" \"What's wrong,\" a voice behind me asked. I turn to see my husband giving me a worried look, while he held a new piece of oak wood for another dresser, that he was creating for me. \"I gained some weight and now I can't fit into my favorite tunic, actually scratch that, I can't ever wear my favorite tunic again since I ripped it.\" He examined me up and down and then replied with, \"You don't look like you have gained weight, except for maybe a little bit in your chest and stomach area.\" I let out a gasp of horror, \"Are you saying I'm fat?!\" He shook his head frantically and inserted, \"No, No! It's just you look kind of...\" \"Kind of what?!\" \"Umm, what's the word I'm looking for... you have an egg in the nest.\" My mouth gaped open and my eyes went bug-eyed. \"Excuse me?\" He twisted his fingers and mumbled, \"Your um... it looks like you pregnant. With someone's child.\" I pull and mess with my stomach skin, and try to remember what being pregnant felt like the last time. \"No that can't be, I don't feel nauseous and I always have protected sex. There was only one time when I didn't and that was...\" I stop dead in my sentence and remember that night three months ago, where I had forgotten to have him or I, put any protection. \"I know who the father is.\" His face twisted in pain at the thought of what the answer might be, \"Who?\" My tongue began to swell and sweat began to form on my silky skin, from unknown nervousness. Why is this so hard? Telling Ares was easy, why isn't this as simple? \"You,\" I state. There was pause, and I observed his body's tenseness at my answer. \"I understand if you have an abortion, you know, so you don't have a deformed child and all,\" he stammered while twisting his thumb. For some reason at that moment the truth finally hit me; Hephaestus was barley to never loved, he was the freak, the monster, the deformation, the joke of our society. Only his best friend Apollo cared and watched over him. But when I was forced to marry him, all I did was complain and cheat on him because he wasn't good-looking or powerful; I am the Goddess of Love and I failed my title, and I felt bitterly ashamed. Apollo, Eros, and now me; we all love him. But I still go out now and again to fool around, even though I love him, and break his heart, and with that it just shows him that if I love him and still cheat on him, then why would I treat our child any better. As tears began to race down my face, I tried my hardest to say this in my clearest voice, \"Hephaestus, I love you and I'm so sorry. I've been so heartless and self-centered, I never meant to hurt you, and I'm sorry I did. I know I can't fix the past but I can at least help the future, I swear I'll never cheat on you again, and I'll never hurt our child whether it is deformed or has any type of flaws.\" The silence stayed for about a minute then he finally replied, \"Say it again.\" \"I love you Hephaestus, and I will love our baby just like a I love Eros.\" He finally made eye contact with me and when we did, I thought my heart was going to melt. He glided over to where I stood and wrapped his strong arms me, and kissed me deeply. When we finally broke, he purred softly in my ear, \"I love you, Goddess of Love, I always have and I always will.\" *********************************************************************************************************************************************************** After that day I forever kept my word. I never cheated on him again, and I loved our gorgeous daughter Lila from the moment she kicked her little feet in my stomach. The best part of my birth to Lila was that it made us a family, also Eros loved her to death, that perfect little flawless girl with dark brown hair, and deep blue eyes won us all over, and won what's now our small family over. I realized love is tricky, first you're blinded, and you needed others to show you and guide you, but when you get past the confusion, love can be a marvelous ride. *********************************************************************************************************************************************************** I hope everyone enjoyed it, I might go back and add more to the ending, but I'm not sure. Since I finished it late at night, so I feel like it needs a tad more, but keep on reading and my next chapter for Crossing Paths should come out soon! -Marty",

    "text": "Hey you guys! Sorry I took so long to post a story, I just got huge writer's block for this ship. So I wanted to finish this ship, so I swear I rewrote this like 3 times in different styles until I decided on this one. There is no fan fiction for this so it was a challenge. Sorry about the wait, hope you guys enjoy! -Marty XOX *********************************************************************************************************************************************************** Remember as a kid, the feeling of innocence and pure joy of being clueless to what's around you? Smiling when your father throws you high above the ground, or when your mother singing's that peaceful lyric to you as you drift off to a world of magic and make-believe. But do also remember the moment when that dream of child play and fantasies ended? Where your parents told you of the bitter truth of the world? Where even as a child, some would stare at you with lustful interest? I remember that day, not perfectly, but perfect enough to know my days of being a child where over. That day where I learned that most would either want to become me or be bedded by me. That moment of recollection of dark filth brought in the world. That precious knowledge of knowing I would be wedded and bedded at the age of 16, by the God of Death, creating fear to indulge me. For I was the Goddess of Death, having a path chosen for me before I was even created to become the God of Death's bride. I mean who wouldn't be afraid? Not of marrying the dead, since I practically already was, but having a fate just like the rest of my family. Partners cheating on their spouse, and love being irrelevant to the powerful. Sure my parents loved each other, but at the being my mother hated my father, since he rapped her. I haven't once seen love work out the way it's said to work, why should I not keep my distance? At first I thought all hope was lost, that I was forced into a cruel fate. Later when I was a rebellious young teen, I found my father to be a selfish jack-ass and my mother a weak pathetic bitch. I regretted calling them those heartless words, but I was a teenager, foolish in all ways. Finally when it was a year before my marriage, my view-point changed... *********************************************************************************************************************************************************** \"Macaria,\" called my mother. I walked into the judgment room to find my Father and Mother on their thrones judging a young man. \"Yes Mother,\" I asked while letting my eyes hover above the stone floor. \"Macaria my dear, would you please grab Thanatos? He forgot to give us this mortal's past info and you know it's wrong to judge based on appearances.\" My throat went dry and my stomach twisted in ways I didn't even know possible. \"Mother,\" I wined. My Mother just batted her long lashes and planted a sweet begging smile on her face, making almost anyone give into her wants and desires. \"Fine,\" I nearly whispered, as I strolled out of the room. After asking around, I learned that my dearest fiance was busy batheing in the hot springs. As I was heading down hall towards the springs, I felt my bodies' temperature rise from the heat of the spring. When I finally arrived I was soaked in my sweat that made my black strapless gown stick to my body in an odd way. I pulled at the cloth to fix the uneven fabric, but my thoughts were broken before I could fix it. \"My bride of Death, what brings you and your disformed friend here,\" he playfully teased, while most of his body was engulfed in the steamy water. I scrunched up my narrow nose and rolled my amber eyes at my future husband, who for some reason loved reminding me that we were betrothed. \"You forgot to give my parents the info for one of the mortal's, dimwit,\" I snapped. He puckered up his lips and over dramatically pressed his eyebrows together. \"Fine, I'll head up right now. But let me just say \"sticks and stones may break my bones, but words will never hurt me\" is a lie.\" \"Oh my Zeus, how am I supposed to marry you, when you act like a 5-year-old? I mean the only one who should be acting like a child is me because... THANATOS!\" As I went into my fit, I didn't realize Thanatos came out of the water, naked. \"Thanatos put some clothes on or something,\" I cried in horror from seeing my first naked man. \"Oh come on Macaria I'm just going to be pressing my naked body up to yours in a year from now anyways.\" Before I could even rant on about anything, he interjected with, \"Stop Macaria. I don't see what the big deal is anyways; were both friends, were both decent people, and we both love the dead. I know I'm immature at times and I tend to be careless about most of the small things, but I still try. We all have our flaws, even you. So am I really that bad? Especially compared to the other Gods who cheat, lie, and steal?\" I had felt regretful before, but never like this. I turned my face away from his hurt felt eyes and wiped the hot tears that race down my cheeks. \"You know I never meant any of it towards you. I've just been so afraid, and hurt, and unsure. Thanatos I'm just so scared,\" I choked out. I heard his feet slide against the dirt floor as he approached me, to rest his hand on my shoulder. \"There's nothing to be afraid of,\" he replied with confidence. \"Yes there is. What isn't there to fear in marriage? You said it yourself, there's cheating, lying, stealing, and a bunch of other things I don't even want to think of.\" He gently took his hand and pulled my face to meet his, he pressed his hot marbled forehead to mine, creating a barrier with our abnormally long black hair. \"What are you really afraid of,\" he whispered. I pressed my eyes shut for a moment, trying to contemplate in my head what to say, a lie or the truth. I opened back up my amber eyes, to see his still, well-defined face, patiently waiting for an answer. \"Honestly, I know I could easily fall in love with you.\" Confusion swirled in his eyes, while his head swayed a little back and forth. \"But...\" \"But,\" I interjected, \"I'm afraid that you will never fall in love with me. Because out of who knows how many married Gods and Goddess, only about 1% both loves each other.\" He lightly pulled his head back and let out a chuckle of amusement. My body began to hurt more, forcing my heart beat to increase. \"Macaria I already love you as a friend and teammate in the field of death. It wouldn't be much harder to love you as a partner as well.\" I noticed the truth in his eyes; he meant it, producing my heart to melt into warm mush. Our amber eyes held each other for a moment, and then he drew away, not before tenderly pressing his lips to mine. As he walked away, I now knew in my heart that I wanted to be wed fully to Death. For I was already in love with death itself, now I would be in love with its other master as well. *********************************************************************************************************************************************************** FYI, I will be doing an OTP challenge so keep a look out for it!",

    "text": "Hey you guys, this is a one-shot over Aphrodite and Hephaestus! I hope you guys enjoy the sweet, lovableness of it! -Marty *********************************************************************************************************************************************************** I examined my husband while he crafted another one of my fine gifts. Crippled, tall, and unappealing, that was how I first described him. But now he appeared different, if such a matter could happen. He seemed more strong than weak, and more handsome than ugly. With his dark brown tousled hair, deep-set hazel eyes, and muscular body, that made me feel over whelmed with lust. I was the Goddess of Love after all, so I must have some love for my own husband. \"Aphrodite, may you please hand me my rag, so I may wipe my sweat away,\" kindly asked Hephaestus. My eyes glanced at the filthy darkened rage, then to my husband's body that faced away from me. \"Of course,\" I replied. I pulled my legs, off the small cream couch and stood up, to grab the rag. I went over to slide my body under his arm, so I could stand before him. \"What do you wish for Aphrodite?\" A smirk danced across my face and I began carefully blotting my husband's face, to wipe away all evidence of his hard work. \"I want attention,\" I purred. He shook his head and let out a grunt of some sort. \"You always want attention,\" he replied. I stuck my lower lip out and crossed my arms over my chest. \"But I want to play,\" I whined. \"Aphrodite, you have tons of other who would love bedding you, why don't you go get some attention from them,\" he suggested. For some reason his words brought me shocked. Did he truly know I bedded various men? Was my love-making that obvious? I pushed the thought aside and began kissing his warm neck. When I pulled away I insisted again, \"But I want attention from you.\" I excepted want, yearning, or something in his eyes to show he need me in this moment, just like I needed him. But all I saw was hurt and pain. \"I don't want you, if I know you're going to just crush my heart and cheat on me afterwards.\" I let go of him, surprised at his comment. Every man desired to make love to me; no one had ever rejected me, and for some reason this rejection made my heart-break a little. \"I just thought you loved me enough to get past that flaw,\" I commented with hurt in my voice. \"I love you Aphrodite, but I love myself more. I'm not going to hurt myself just to satisfy your thirst.\" For some reason water began forming in my eyes, and my heart made a crack, that I hoped only I could hear. For some reason the true that I didn't even know was real, came spilling out, \"But I love you, not them. I'm with them out of fun; I'm with you out of love.\" He eyed me to see if I had lied, but somehow I knew in my heart that I didn't lie. I loved him, and now guilt filled me for hurting him so. My thoughts broke when he turned away from me and headed out the room, into his study. I stayed perfectly in place and waited for him to return minutes later. When he came back he held a small wood craved box in his large, calloused hands. He came before me and opened the small box to reveal a large dazzling diamond ring. It had a gold band, and around the band held tiny ruby stones that made it even more extravagant. \"If you truly love, then you will forever wear this ring as a sign of our bond in marriage, as husband and wife. You will only sleep with me and never cheat on me again, as will I never cheat on you. You do this and you may have me for the rest of my existence, but if you don't or you break the rules I lay out before you, then the deal is off. After that we will just be friends that are bond by false, useless words. Do you understand?\" I thought the offer over in my head, years ago I would have laughed in his face for even suggesting it, but now, now I wanted him. I wished him to only be mine, and I wished to only stay in his bed. \"Yes,\" I reply with all certainty. \"Good, now what is your answer,\" he asked. I took a step towards his closing off the gap between us and I was barely able to whispered, \"That was my answer. Yes, I will wear this ring as a sign that I am eternally bond to you.\" I slid on the ring and I wrap my arms around him and pulled him closer to me. \"And I'm not just saying yes because I see this as some sort of game that I'll cheat on tomorrow. I ended it with your brother a few months ago and since then I have just been carelessly playing around. I swear by the river of Styx to be loyal to you, and to love you till the ends of my time and beyond that.\" I just made the most power oath, and I regretted none of it. My eyes were locked with his, and I waited for some emotion to poor through them. After a few moments, he closed his eyes and reopened them a moment later to hold love and joy. He brought my lips to his and in that moment I knew this was all I would ever want from life. He pulled away just for a moment. He took my whole self in and then lightly purred in my ear, \"I love you Aphrodite.\" We both smiled pure glee, and then we went back to where we left off, my lips on his. That night he brought me to his bed just like the others, he took his time and care, but when the next night came, I was there, unlike usually, and we made love again. We did this for a week, then a month, and finally we lost track of the time. Now when we can, we will just lay there wrapped in each other's arms, and have our love stay there for the rest of time. *********************************************************************************************************************************************************** I hoped you guys enjoyed it!

He should know, too: you don't make deals with shadows in the dark land under the land, and you can't cheat death out of what is its by right. Some of them tried, the cleverest and most cunning among the shadows, the ones who once were heroes and kings and wise men. But Orpheus doesn't know, or perhaps he pretends he doesn't know, as if pretending could make it real. He seems about to take her small fair hand in his own, but then he just turns around, iron and fire in his eyes, and leads the pale ghost he came for towards the distant light. He is a man in love. Many of the shadows were men and women in love, once. They can't say they aren't sorry for him - for the kind poet with his warm, soothing voice and merry songs to play on his lyre with long, nimble fingers; for the naive young man who thought he could end their pain and even managed to do it, for a little while. But Orpheus' kindness is just a short passing thing, a quick flash of light in the everlasting darkness, and it won't take long for them to forget it, to lose it in pain and torment and oblivion. Besides, he can't hold their interest for long, as they all know how it will end. Their King and Queen know it, too. It's in the cool, hard calm painted on their King's pale features, it's in their Queen's eyes - an old crone's deep eyes in a maiden's fresh face. Sometimes, they can still see something hot and alive, in those eyes, a brief flicker of the girl she must be when she breathes in the scent of her mother's spring flowers and sunny days. That very spark was there in the Queen's eyes as she listened to Orpheus' songs, and yet the shadows are not sure it has been kindness or mercy, or anything human at all, that made her lips move as she begged her husband. The shadows are not surprised when they see Eurydice come to them again, face and hands pale as they've always seen them, her eyes dry and her mouth set in a tight line - of course, she's not surprised, either. Though maybe, if she were still alive, she'd cry. The shadows are not surprised when they see him cross the river again, his eyes already searching for her and a scar running across his neck, thin and red against his white skin. He still sings, Orpheus. Low, mournful songs that would make the shadows' blood run cold and bring tears to their eyes, if they still had any. When he eventually finds Euridyce again, he smiles and he never stops looking at her. The shadows sometimes wonder if he's ever stopped, if he still looked back even in the light and the warmth of the land of the living. But, after all, they do know the answer.",

    "text": "It wasn't like he was just doing it for Derek. He wasn't- he wasn't, goddammit, Scott. It was just that he needed a difficult journey to test his mage powers so he could complete his apprenticeship to Deaton, and, well, what better place than the Underworld? It was a crazy coincidence that all of Derek's family was chilling there for the rest of eternity. Yeah....Okay, so it wasn't a completely random happenstance- he couldn't even lie to himself about that. He had chosen his journey with the idea of returning the poor guy's family to him. He even had a contact waiting in the wings with new identities for whomever he saved. Hell, Deaton had given him copies of journals of people who had done the same shit- usually for just one or two people, but still. He was pulling an Orpheus. But it wasn't just because he wanted Derek to pound him into the mattress. He wanted cuddles and domesticity, too, dammit. Plus, even if the guy didn't return his feelings, they were still friends. Friends that pushed each other to their limits, but friends none the less, and Derek didn't deserve to feel guilty because he wasn't. He had been fifteen, young and in love, and Kate had taken advantage of it, and that shit wasn't going to fly with him. Derek was kind and well-meaning, if a bit rough around the edges, and he deserved good things. All the good things. Stiles reminded himself of that as he laid down on his mentor's office couch. His heart was pounding, bruising the inside of his chest, and he breathed out slow in an attempt to calm his nerves. It was difficult. He was essentially putting himself in a magical fucking coma until he either completed the journey or died, and that would scare even the bravest of people. Worth it, though, so worth it if he brought even one person back. \"Ready?\" Deaton questioned. The man's face was serene as always, but Stiles thought he could see a fierce kind of pride in his dark eyes. Derek hadn't been the only person to lose someone in the fire, after all, and it was the duty of the pack's emissary to care for each and every one of the people within the territory. Stiles nodded, amber eyes fluttering closed, and the vet sighed. \"Good. Remember your lessons, and do not lose sight of why you're doing this.\" \"Good luck, buddy,\" he heard Scott whisper from beside him, a warm hand running down his arm. Then he felt the pinch of a needle sliding into the flesh of his neck, the burn of the magic infused potion as it was pushed into his bloodstream, and everything went blank.... Stiles snapped awake to growling- low and deep, but more curious than malicious. He was on his feet, standing in the middle of a grey granite room before twin steel doors. Guarding them was the thing making the growls. Cerberus, the Hell-Hound, his mind supplied, remembering the journals he had devoured for weeks before. They had been descriptive, some even had drawings, but none had captured the sheer size of the thing. It was as large as, if not bigger than, Derek in full Alpha form, the three heads equivalent to beach balls. Its paws, too, were larger than belief, but the odd thing was its body structure. The hound was almost skeletal, the muscles it had lean and long. Still, the thing thrummed with magical energy, and he knew it could and would overpower him if he made one wrong move. \"Why are you here?\" it hissed, all three jaws snapping. At the sight of its multiple rows of teeth, he had to withhold a flinch. He had faced freakier and more murderous things, goddammit. He wasn't going to fear a pup. \"You are not of the dead. Be gone, childe, for you cannot enter here.\" Stiles straightened his spine, threw back his shoulders. He would not give the hound the satisfaction of seeing him afraid. He couldn't afford to. \"Hell-Hound, I seek audience with your king. I have a grievance that needs to be addressed.\" The formal speech was stilted on his tongue, but the tone was sure. None of the others had really used such language, but he felt it suited. When in Rome and all that. Or Greece, rather. The Hell-Hound's heads bobbed in time with each other, understanding lighting their madder eyes. \"Allowed,\" it spoke, tone gleeful. It was either really nice or plotting, Stiles decided. Cerberus' teeth clacked together again, muzzles curling up in canine grins. \"It has been so long since someone came to seek recompense. Forthward, childe, and bring back light to those unwarrantedly lost. However, be warned: not all is as it seems, and it is all too easy to become one of the mindless. Remember what it was that brought you to our domain. Go.\" Nice, Stiles decided, he was nice. The heavy looking doors swung out and open. Brightness flooded the room, and he brushed a long-fingered hand against the beast's side as he ambled past, entering the gold light.... Scott fidgeted on the couch Derek had bought last week, his heart beating a bit quicker than normal. It was comfy, the couch; an L-shaped black leather six or seven seater Stiles had bullied their Alpha into buying. It matched the warm ambiance Isaac and Lydia had decided on during renovations. The reminder of his best friend- his brother- forced his mind to what he was doing. Jesus H. Christ, Stiles was crazy, doing what he was doing, and just because it was the right thing, too! Oh, sure, he knew his brother wanted to marry Derek and have his babies or whatever, but like he had said, it went beyond that. He was in fucking Hell, attempting to petition Hades and Persephone into returning Derek's poor family because they had died without true reason and before their time. Jesus. H. Christ. He shifted again, restless. He would have been beside him if Derek hadn't have called and informed him of the date. June third. The day they came together, last year, to form a real pack. The day they all agreed would be sacred. The day they decided to celebrate annually, midnight to midnight. Dammit. Stiles knew, had to have known. It made sense, too, Scott supposed, held a kind of poetic symbolism. Saving their Alpha's old pack on the day his new one formed. Still, it looked like the bastard had bailed, and Derek seemed pissed. Or disappointed, maybe, if he was reading the twitching of his eyebrows right. He wasn't quite sure- he didn't speak 'brow like Stiles. \"And where is Stiles?\" Derek growled the question. Yeah, he was disappointed, not angry. That was good....Right? The man's hazel eyes roamed over each of his pack's upturned faces before settling on Scott's, where they stayed and started burning red. Not right. \"Well?\" \"I- he- er, well,\" the teen stumbled over his words. Stiles had told him not to tell, and he wouldn't break his word. \"He- uh- there was this-.\" Derek began a low rumble, a warning that he was entering dangerous ground and that talking would be in his best interest. Oh, damn. It wasn't like it was a big secret, right? Stiles hadn't even told him why he shouldn't tell. Scott cast a glance towards an amused Peter before turning back to his Alpha and closing his eyes in resignation. \"He's in Deaton's office in a magical coma, completing his apprenticeship by going into the Underworld and saving your family. He'll either die or wake up when he's finished the journey.\" The rumble became a roar, and he heard Peter flail off his chair and thud onto the floor. Scott cursed and kept his eyes closed- he didn't even want to see the two remaining Hales' faces. He shouldn't have told them, but he had, and now he had to deal with Derek's love-hate and Peter's joke-tease thing for his brother while worrying his own ass off. It was going to be a long day. Jesus H. Christ.... The room Stiles entered was bright, and he was forced to shield his amber eyes against the glare. When he adjusted to the light, he took in the area with a gasp. Holy shit. Holy shit. The ceiling was high, tens of dark metal chandeliers holding giant candles the source of the blinding light, and the walls and floor appeared to be made of polished gold. Smack dab in the middle of the room was the single largest table he had ever seen, and every inch of it was covered in food. Here and there, a person or group of people sat, eating in near silence, the only noise being the smacking of lips or clacking of teeth. It was beautiful and disgusting, and he was struck with the imaginary image of old knights and Vikings and others feasting in celebration. The young mage forced his legs to move, bringing him to the end of the table and the closest person. The smell of roasted turkey and fresh baked bread wafted up from the tabletop, and he couldn't resist the urge to lean forward. His stomach gurgled. God, when had he last eaten? He had already been through six rooms, all empty and at least an acre in size each. He deserved a little rest, didn't he? Besides, he needed to be in tip-top condition to... Why was he there, again? There was a reason, he knew, a damn good one, but he couldn't seem to remember why beyond that it had something to do with a day of celebration and saving people. Stiles' stomach rumbled again, louder, and he gave a mental shrug. It probably wasn't important anyway, not like the need to sate his hunger. He leaned forward in order to snag a bite of the feast, a slender hand reaching out, but he paused before touching anything. Something was wrong, bad wrong, and a memory was niggling in the corner of his mind. He retracted his arm, feeling dazed. What was going on? \"It's not right. The food's wrong. Don't eat it, stop eating it,\" he slurred, turning to look at the person beside him. It was a woman, pretty and young. She had long blond hair and was tall, almost a full foot taller than him, and his sluggish mind registered her strange garb. Heavy furs were sewn into what resembled a dress. Struggling to remember why it seemed familiar, he turned his attention to her eyes. They were beautiful, or they would have been if the dark blue irises had been lit by any sign of intelligence or even awareness. Instead, they were glassy and dulled by mindlessness....Mindlessness. Mindless. 'Not all is as it seems, and it is all too easy to become one of the mindless. Remember what it was that brought you to our domain.' The Cerberus' words roared into his conscious mind, and his whole body flinched back from the set up. His mind sped back up, and his breathing deepened as his heart raced a pounding tattoo against his ribs. He had almost doomed Derek's family. He had almost become lost to Hades' realm. Holy shit. Now that the haze was broken, he could feel the tainted magic saturating the room. Compulsion spells interwoven with binding charms, if he had to hazard a guess, all powerful and all created to tempt a living person into staying an eternity in the Underworld. He shuddered and glanced again at the poor soul beside him, finally remembering why she had struck him as familiar- she had the stereotypical look of a female in the Viking era and area. She had probably been there for centuries, her bones just as gone as her mind. Stiles shuddered again, and he distanced himself from the table before he started walking forward again. He was almost done, if the journals were to be believed. Just a few more rooms left until he entered the room in the exact middle of the Underworld- the throne room.... Derek sucked in a sharp breath and staggered to his knees beside Deaton's couch. His boy was so pale, the chocolate brown of his moles standing out even more starkly against his skin. The Alpha's large hands grasped at one of the boy's, and he whimpered. His boy was cold to the touch, too, freezing his own werewolf-warm body. He wanted to curse, but his mind was stuck on loop. His mate was in danger. His mate was in danger he couldn't save him from. His mate was in danger for him. His stomach clenched, and he felt dizzy as he butted his head against Stiles' side. Guilt clawed at his insides, making the older man even more nauseous. If he hadn't been a stoic bastard, would his Stiles still have done it? If he had reassured Stiles he was happy, would he still have left? If he had shown Stiles how much he loved and needed him, would his boy still have tried to save his family? He choked back a hysteric laugh. Of course he still would have. His mate had the biggest heart of anyone he had ever met and was amongst the most stubborn of them, too, and that was including his mom. He would have done the same thing because of the guilt that Derek felt about it, just to prove his innocence and to make him happy. No more, he promised himself. When Stiles got back, Derek was going to shower him in affection. He was going to court the kid, show him how much he meant to him.... Stiles entered the room with his back tall and straight and his face averted. With slow steps, he approached the obsidian thrones, and three steps away, he stopped and knelt on his knees. \"Lord Hades, Lady Persephone,\" he greeted, voice clear and respectful. Truthfully, keeping his head tilted downwards and to the side should have been enough of a gesture of respect, but he had come so far. He was not going to fuck it all up just because he couldn't keep his mouth shut. \"Why have you come to my kingdom, childe?\" The voice was smooth, silky, and dark with seductive knowledge. It made him want to look up, to see what the god looked like, to sit in his lap and beg for entrance to his bed. He shivered and forced the feeling back- he loved Derek more than he loved his own life, and not even this god was worth abandoning that for. The voice continued, considering and amused and proud as if he knew what Stiles was thinking, \"You belong amongst the living, not here with the cold and dead.\" Stiles took a deep breath, and letting it out in a soft stream, he considered his word choice. There was much he had to say, and he had little time to say it. He could feel the cold creeping into his extremities, indicating he was starting to overstay his welcome. \"My lord, I come to you in grievance. The Hale family of Beacon Hills, California, in the United States of America was wrongfully killed seven years ago. A conniving shrew of a woman used their unwitting son to gain information on them, and then she burned them alive while the son and a daughter watched in horror and a burned uncle crawled away. Because of her actions, innocent children and adults were sent here before their time. Because of her actions, Peter Hale went insane and murdered the daughter that lived. I beg for recompense, my lord, as none of the surviving family deserves the guilt she saddled them with. I beg you to give those wrongfully murdered Hales back. I beg you to accept my sacrificial gift and consider my request.\" With that, he dug the index finger of his right hand into the palm of his left, and he bit back a pained noise as the tore open the skin with a ragged nail. Ignoring the sharp stab of pain, he focused his magic on the blood welling up from the wound, and with a thought, the thick crimson liquid gathered and hardened into an unpolished gemstone. \"So you may use it as you will, my lord,\" he mumbled, leaving the cut to bleed. Footsteps echoed around the room, halting just before him. The god's magic was almost oppressive so close, and Stiles felt himself struggling to breathe as a warm hand gently pried the gem from his hand. When it left his palm, the footsteps sounded again, and the magic lessened until it was as before. Silence reigned for several moments before that silky voice spoke again, this time quiet and decisive. \"Request and gift accepted, childe. The Hale family members killed as a result of Kathrine Argent's actions will be sent back with you, bodies new- and Talia Hale's power lessened- but otherwise as they were the day they died. I hope the other half of your soul realizes what a gift you have given to him, little mage.\" \"Thank you, my lord,\" Stiles had just enough time to whisper, relief flooding his every pore, before his mind went blank.... Talia Hale blinked away the dark spots dancing in her vision and ignored the chill lingering on her skin- she had far more important things to worry about. A raised hand stopped her revived pack from stepping forward and making noise. The boy from Hades' throne room was lying on a couch in front of her, and kneeling beside him, holding onto one of his hands, was her baby boy. Her Derek. Oh, he had aged well. He had been such an awkward child, tall and bulky and unsure of himself even at fifteen. He had grown into his ears, she noted, and his teeth. He seemed so much more confident now, at the side of the boy that saved them, despite the drying streaks of tears. \"Come back to me, baby,\" he muttered, bringing the boy's hand up to his cheek. He nuzzled it, scent marking him, before he laid his head down on the boy's chest. He sighed out a shaky breath. When he next spoke, his voice broke. \"Please come back to me, Stiles. I need you. I'm sorry I didn't tell you. You're the only one I'll ever need again.\" He had found his mate, too, it seemed, in this Stiles. Talia bit back a smile. She wanted to speak to her son, but she chose instead to relish in the ability to simply feel her own heartbeat. They had time, and she didn't know when she'd get another chance to observe her baby boy so open and raw again. Looking back at Laura and seeing her amused awe, she knew the rest of her pack felt the same, even the children clinging to their parents' hands. Seconds after that decision, the boy gasped and jerked up, his breathing frantic. He grasped at Derek's short dark hair and pulled him up to face him, the boy's startling amber eyes searching his. \"Tell me it worked,\" he begged. His voice was rough but higher than she would have thought. \"Tell me, Derek, please. I need you to be happy.\" \"Am happy,\" her son whispered, pulling the boy to his chest. His large hands cupped Stiles' face and lifted it closer to his own. \"Always happy with you.\" And then he lowered his lips to brush against the other's. It was chaste and probably their first, if Stiles' startled gasp was any indication. Still, it was more than Talia wanted to see, and she cleared her throat. The two's heads swiveled in her direction, making her grin. Oh, to be alive.",

      "He was not going to fuck it all up just because he couldn't keep his mouth shut.",
      "\"Why have you come to my kingdom, childe?\"",
      "The voice was smooth, silky, and dark with seductive knowledge.",
      "It made him want to look up, to see what the god looked like, to sit in his lap and beg for entrance to his bed.",
      "He shivered and forced the feeling back- he loved Derek more than he loved his own life, and not even this god was worth abandoning that for.",
      "The voice continued, considering and amused and proud as if he knew what Stiles was thinking, \"You belong amongst the living, not here with the cold and dead.\"",
      "Stiles took a deep breath, and letting it out in a soft stream, he considered his word choice.",
      "There was much he had to say, and he had little time to say it.",
      "He could feel the cold creeping into his extremities, indicating he was starting to overstay his welcome.",
      "\"My lord, I come to you in grievance.",
      "The Hale family of Beacon Hills, California, in the United States of America was wrongfully killed seven years ago.",
      "A conniving shrew of a woman used their unwitting son to gain information on them, and then she burned them alive while the son and a daughter watched in horror and a burned uncle crawled away.",
      "Because of her actions, innocent children and adults were sent here before their time.",
      "Because of her actions, Peter Hale went insane and murdered the daughter that lived.",
      "I beg for recompense, my lord, as none of the surviving family deserves the guilt she saddled them with.",
      "I beg you to give those wrongfully murdered Hales back.",
      "I beg you to accept my sacrificial gift and consider my request.\"",
      "With that, he dug the index finger of his right hand into the palm of his left, and he bit back a pained noise as the tore open the skin with a ragged nail.",
      "Ignoring the sharp stab of pain, he focused his magic on the blood welling up from the wound, and with a thought, the thick crimson liquid gathered and hardened into an unpolished gemstone.",
      "\"So you may use it as you will, my lord,\" he mumbled, leaving the cut to bleed.",
      "Footsteps echoed around the room, halting just before him.",
      "The god's magic was almost oppressive so close, and Stiles felt himself struggling to breathe as a warm hand gently pried the gem from his hand.",
      "When it left his palm, the footsteps sounded again, and the magic lessened until it was as before.",
      "Silence reigned for several moments before that silky voice spoke again, this time quiet and decisive.",
      "\"Request and gift accepted, childe.",
      "The Hale family members killed as a result of Kathrine Argent's actions will be sent back with you, bodies new- and Talia Hale's power lessened- but otherwise as they were the day they died.",
      "I hope the other half of your soul realizes what a gift you have given to him, little mage.\"",
      "\"Thank you, my lord,\" Stiles had just enough time to whisper, relief flooding his every pore, before his mind went blank....",
      "Talia Hale blinked away the dark spots dancing in her vision and ignored the chill lingering on her skin- she had far more important things to worry about.",
      "A raised hand stopped her revived pack from stepping forward and making noise.",
      "The boy from Hades' throne room was lying on a couch in front of her, and kneeling beside him, holding onto one of his hands, was her baby boy.",
      "Her Derek.",
      "Oh, he had aged well.",
      "He had been such an awkward child, tall and bulky and unsure of himself even at fifteen.",
      "He had grown into his ears, she noted, and his teeth.",
      "He seemed so much more confident now, at the side of the boy that saved them, despite the drying streaks of tears.",
      "\"Come back to me, baby,\" he muttered, bringing the boy's hand up to his cheek.",
      "He nuzzled it, scent marking him, before he laid his head down on the boy's chest.",
      "He sighed out a shaky breath.",
      "When he next spoke, his voice broke.",
      "\"Please come back to me, Stiles.",
      "I need you.",
      "I'm sorry I didn't tell you.",
      "You're the only one I'll ever need again.\"",
      "He had found his mate, too, it seemed, in this Stiles.",
      "Talia bit back a smile.",
      "She wanted to speak to her son, but she chose instead to relish in the ability to simply feel her own heartbeat.",
      "They had time, and she didn't know when she'd get another chance to observe her baby boy so open and raw again.",
      "Looking back at Laura and seeing her amused awe, she knew the rest of her pack felt the same, even the children clinging to their parents' hands.",
      "Seconds after that decision, the boy gasped and jerked up, his breathing frantic.",
      "He grasped at Derek's short dark hair and pulled him up to face him, the boy's startling amber eyes searching his.",
      "\"Tell me it worked,\" he begged.",
      "His voice was rough but higher than she would have thought.",
      "\"Tell me, Derek, please.",
      "I need you to be happy.\"",
      "\"Am happy,\" her son whispered, pulling the boy to his chest.",
      "His large hands cupped Stiles' face and lifted it closer to his own.",
      "\"Always happy with you.\"",
      "And then he lowered his lips to brush against the other's.",
      "It was chaste and probably their first, if Stiles' startled gasp was any indication.",
      "Still, it was more than Talia wanted to see, and she cleared her throat.",
      "The two's heads swiveled in her direction, making her grin.",
      "Oh, to be alive."

    "text": "\"I'm not responsible for this foolishness, Shawn!\" \"Cheer up, my sweet little stick of chocolate fondue.\" Shawn tossed two now-empty bottles of syrup over his shoulders, one chocolate and one strawberry, and took a look at his best friend. Gus' chest had been dotted with melting globs of mint-chocolate chip ice cream, and these and every other exposed inch of flesh now dripped with syrup. \"It's still missing something,\" he said, leaping off the bed. \"That's racist, I'm freezing cold and I think your bandana's cutting off the circulation to my right hand!\" Gus gave a tug to the bonds pinioning him to Shawn's four-poster bed - the same one where they had played with action figures and read comics books as children. He bit his bottom lip as Shawn plunked two cherries down upon his nipples - the last thing he wanted was for Mister Spencer to barge in and catch them in the act. Shawn stepped back from the bed, his yellow smiley-face covered black boxers glimmering in the early morning light saturating the room. He framed his eye and peered at the picture before him and reached for the bedside table, picking up a large red can. Gus' response was a squirm, an attempted crossing of his legs. \"Oh hell no! You'd better not be squirting whipped cream all over Mister Snuffleupagus!\" \"You're killing my childhood here.\" \"Can you not talk about childhood while we're doing this?\" Shawn paused. \"Not helping, Gus.\" He started shaking the can vigorously. \"The third leading cause of bladder infections is sugar,\" Gus replied primly. \"And I don't want to go to the doctor's office two days before we go to MegaCon!\" He cringed. \"It'll probably fall off!\" \"Gus, don't be Ron Jeremy standing next to Jenna Jameson. You and Mister Snuffleupagus are going to be happy together for years to come, and your junk really likes what I'm doing.\" He added a few squirts of cool cream down the sides of Gus' dick. \"Look! Racing stripes.\" \"HE doesn't have a brain!\" Gus growled. But it was true. Gus 'junk' responded by quivering but remaining erect. Shawn then gestured emphatically at his best friend's erection like a desperate magician. \"Hurry up, Shawn! The rabbit's going back into the hat.\" Had he really said that aloud? Yes he had, judging from the glimmer in his friend's eyes. \"All right,\" Shawn said, eyes glimmering, tilting back the can and shotgunning half of it before wiping his lips and adding it to the pile of dessert topping containers behind him. \"Let's do this.\" Then he shouted, \"BREAKFAST TIME!\" and leapt toward Gus, his mouth level to the syrupy, creamy tangle of his friend's groin. The whimper Gus made was the first of many given that morning, half-comprised of passion, part of fear - and the rest of hunger. Even in bed, she's still the boss Juliet is the boss. Shawn's completely cool with that, mostly because he worships her like the milky lady-shaped goddess she is. So if she wants more of the covers after they've finished making vigorous love with Gus, she gets most of the covers. He always has the combined heat of his lovers to keep his frozen buns warm. Gus is the one who can't stand the cold. He's been known to use Shawn's armpits as tiny furnaces in which to warm his fingertips. And Shawn shrieks and rolls away, but Gus knows from experience that nothing excites Shawn more than a little shock. He's the big cuddler, even when Gus wants his privacy and Juliet has files to get through. Sometimes, they lie in a pile of sleepy, heavy limbs, Juliet's ponytail plastered to Shawn's splayed lips with sweat and his open palm spread like a sunburst against Gus' bare belly. He giggles into Shawn's neck and Juliet frowns and pulls them closer. Even asleep, she's still the boss. Grier's enthusiasm is appreciated, but the Snow Queen has no idea how they'll consummate their love. She's prepared herself for a long, long winter of solitude, and a spring that might never come. She doesn't anticipate seeing Grier again; there will be another mercenary with a harsher approach, and she will endure in the hope of fostering life. The months peel back into oblivion, turning blue with snow and brown-black with melting mud. Soon April arrives, and she knows by the clamor at her door that the villagers below desire a thaw. She prepares herself for the clumsiness ahead with a lock of her teeth and a groan of dismay. But not one unfamiliar hand touches her before a whoop fills the air and she feels the earthquake of her front door shuddering open. She opens one pale eye and there's Grier, stomping the snow from her boots. She's tried to conjure the right words but they're buried in a squeak of pleasure as Grier pulls her against the rabbit fur jacket. She's soft on the outside, warm deep within, and she can feel the heavy pooling of her own arousal drift from her belly to the knot between her thighs. Her savior speaks. \"Are you all right?\" There's a bob of silky, chilled hair. \"I didn't think you'd be back. Grier.\" \"Shhh!\" \"I just wish I could REALLY touch you,\" she admits. A giggle spills from her lips, her cheeks turning pink, as the mercenary hazarded a quick kiss to her cheek. \"Your enthusiasm is appreciated, but how will we...?\" Grier mumbles something, a request for silence, a plea, before her well-prepared, fur-covered fingers slide over the trembling rise of her lover's thigh. Then the queen is melting. She's sticky, she's falling apart, warm and sweet under the layers of ice, like a slippery bit of frozen fruit coming to thaw before the rush of the melting floe carries her off to the black rush of peace. The little princess doesn't have much to say, but she's a smiler.... The little red haired princess doesn't have much to say, but she's a smiler, and Jasmine has never been the sort of woman to halt a good time just for a lack of words. Her prince brought her to Agrabah as a form of therapy, to erase memories of an unpleasant and traumatic event that he won't share with the Sultan and Ariel cannot bring herself to mention to Jasmine. It's Jasmine's idea to ride down to the shore on Carpet, to take her to the shoreline, where the warm water's healing propensity is legendary. Ariel perks right up at the suggestion, and when they land she hops off of Carpet's back and walks toward the ocean as if magnetized to it. Jasmine watches her strip off her finery, the hoops and petticoats that have trapped her in stifling heat for hours and hours of court-dictated events. Ariel spins away, giggling, from her host and runs toward the ocean, then dives in, her milky skin lined over with streaks of gold and the light that catch in fiery waves in her red hair. Jasmine crosses her arms over her breast, laughing softly at the girl's antics. It's as if something major had been sliced out of girls' soul, and meeting with the ocean had revived it and turned her back into her true self. The princess swam like a seal and had the lung space of a whale; she surfaced from the chill blue ocean after minutes of submersion still laughing. \"Come swim with me!\" she waved her fingers, her toes, as she cut expertly through the waves. Jasmine - never one for modesty herself -just strips away her gauzy blue outfit and joins the girl in the frothy waves. It would be bad form to deny the princess something that clearly makes her so happy, and Jasmine was never one to deny destiny, either. And so they splash and paddle, squealing at the icy pelting of the waves, trying to stay afloat in the churning current. Jasmine's hair drifts like seaweed across the surface of the water, unbound and adrift, tangling with the red of Ariel's, oil meeting blood. Somehow, in the middle of it all, the flow of their movement changed. Their legs tangled, their arms wrapped 'round each other. It was natural to slip down in that grip, the texture of the flesh of the other a tease, a silent hope for more. Jasmine didn't need to consider her next move. She opens her mouth over the princess' shell-colored sex, and tastes the salt of the ocean. Barney and Robin, half-awake after a night of drunken debauchery, discuss the traditional hangover cures of the Stinson clan. \"Uhnnngh?\" \"BARNEY.\" \"But mommy, I already had my Yoo-Hoo....Oh...Robin! Why are you bugging me? It's 2 am...OW!\" \"If you EVER mistake me for your mother again...\" \"I was tired...and really hung over...eww, why am I sticky?\" \"You don't remember the maple syrup luge? I spent half the night trying to lick you clean.\" \"It finally happened, Robin. The other curse of the Stinsons set in! I experienced the most awesome time in the history of humankind...and I can't remember it!\" \"There's only one way to fix that. And it involves you, me and this waterbed.\" \"....Here's to breaking this curse!\" Baby trusts him to hold her like this... This is the only place he's willing to let her lead. His hand tight upon her hip and loose upon the back of her head, trying to tame two sets of unruly locks with his expert timing, his adventurous tongue and stabilizing touch. Baby is whipcord-tight, her muscles having lost their spaghetti-like looseness minutes ago. She can't hold her frame, can't stay still, can only follow the persistent beat of Johnny's tongue, the determination of his lust. She arches, her toes pointed, and jerks hard to the melody before falling backward, sideways, into the solid wall of his chest. They've gotta go... \"Honey, it's almost five. We gotta get home.\" Angel's half asleep in Tom's arms as they spin across the floor, an old Tom Waits song moaning from the dusty speakers of the coffeehouse's jukebox. There's the slightest trace of their midnight mischief in the powdered set of her features; something's been hastily wiped away. \"One more song,\" she demands. \"Then we'll go home, just you and me.\" Tom's the one who tilts up her chin and feels the press of two stocking-clad thighs against his own, the waxen silk of lipstick. The kiss is all salt, all brass - Angel encapsulated. Can the wear him out? Naveen - self-satisfied but silent for once - lies in comfort between his wife and her best friend, who have played willing party to his seduction and are now relaxed, nude and happy. This, he thinks, is the life - but he's wise enough not to get too cocky, or else he'll pay the price of Tiana's wise sarcasm. He lets out a soft hiss as Lottie's curious hand explores his limp cock in the moonlight. \"Aww, it's all floppy again. I didn't think this thing ever gets tired.\" He wiggles his brows. \"Shall we find out if we can wake it?\" Tiana slaps his chest. \"Wait your turn,\" she says, tackling a giggling Lottie and pinning her to the mattress. There must be a way to shut his mouth! The key to dating Steven Hyde was a simple one - to ensure harmony between them, she needed to keep his mouth occupied and keep his hands moving. A tongue teasing along the edge of his lips tended to keep his opinions mute. A nipple jammed between his teeth easily stemmed the flow of his bitter comments. And silencing his latest rant about 'the man' was as simple as straddling his face. Their relationship had turned Jackie into the queen of the cowgirls, kept her riding Steven's mouth in his back seat, her thighs tight against his ears, her red nails stroking along his blood bright cock. It was much more fun than buying earplugs. The drift suits her. The Drift suits her greatly. In the intense pulse of light and affinity, she is in her element, a tuning fork, the conductor of motion, half of his mind and half of his nerve endings. Mako, as a sexual being, is similar to the person she is as his Drift partner. She is all force and boldness in the heat of the battle, all gravity beforehand. Her nails make slick tracks down his back and her lipstick stains the lee of his neck. She tries to consume him whole within her as they grapple against the soaked brick walls outside their lodging, laughing, kissing, and grunting as buckles fall open and zippers part. She is direct and quiet but gives him enough room to move, trusts him enough to allow him to pick her up and to ply her nipples with kisses and her belly with bites. The soft, wet pull of Mako's sex and the screams trapped within her consume Raleigh's attention, his lust. He only wants to pay worship to her, but Mako is no carved idol; she won't hold anything back from him. Raleigh's eyes squeeze shut and he comes seeing the same flashes of light he gets in the drift, white, green, gray, blue. Can they help Sam decide between suits? \"Okay guys, help me out here.\" Sam held up a white silk dress shirt in one hand, a blue silk dress shirt in the other. \"Are we a bunch of high-class robin hoods or are we a band of thugs?\" Fiona already had her hand around a cock. \"Michael.\" She cradled his name upon her tongue, her fingers stroking his flesh. \"We're a band. Isn't that adorable?\" \"Hey, you wouldn't treat Frank Sinatra this way!\" She grabbed Sam by his belt loop and yanked his hips against her chest. \"I also wouldn't suck his cock.\" Sam wisely kept his mouth shut. She's a total babe but he's not having it... The thing about Amy is that she's really, really hot. Under those boxy suit coats and that ponytail and those glasses and her carefulness she's nuclear. Baberaham Lincoln. Totally smoking. And Jake knows this, and has to pretend his mind doesn't wander, that he has to force himself to stop imagining what she'd be like if they went horizontal her desk (right between her old school trophy and her commendation from the state), what her lips would feel like around his cock, if she'd come when he yanked her against him by that damn ponytail. She would probably make him pay for her cleaning after, but it would be worth it. Rosa's got a bet, and Amy's the blushing quarry. \"Hey,\" Rosa said, \"Oh, hi Rosa! We're meeting with the Captain in a minute...\" Amy's statement was swallowed up by Rosa's tongue, her complaints mollified and silenced with a quick sweep and a tangling of fingers in hair. She responded out of habit, with a little groan, by pulling on Rosa's curly hair and getting her arm around the woman's neck. Her disarrayed thoughts scattered like ashes to the wind when Rosa pulled away from her and whisked away a streak of her lipstick from Amy's mouth. \"Cool. Peralta owes me ten bucks. You do blush when you get kissed.\" Until the children come she can pretend she's Jayne Mansfield. Audrey's learned one thing about being married so far - when you're a newlywed the whole wide world will forgive you a little naughtiness. Until the children come she can pretend she's Jayne Mansfield. She can wear a pink bikini and burn little, shrieking Twoey sproutlings in slacks. And she can make love to her husband in the big, beautiful backyard they bought with the insurance money from Mushnick's. Seymour's no sheik, but he loves her so utterly that Audrey's insides melt whenever he looks at her funny. All of his gentle kisses on her vulnerable, pink parts make her quiver. She bites her bottom lip before she bites his bottom. He likes her on top of him, because he likes admiring her long, pale form as much as when he'd enjoyed it back when they were cooped up in that dusty flower shop all day. In the duel reflection of his glasses, Audrey sees herself, shining and golden, the clouds gathering behind them. The rain licks her elbow, the hem of her hiked-up dress, the cuff of Seymour's new Dockers. Around them, everything grows. Within Audrey, something too, takes root, though she won't know for sure for another two months. She could listen to her husband speak for ages. Daphne could listen to her husband speak for ages. Especially after his heart attack, and especially after the birth of their son - she nearly demanded his voice in her ear at every crucial moment, grounding her like one of Granny Moon's old stories. His long, white fingers are elegant, yet gentle vessels - they drag her toward rapture as they delve through the wet folds of her sex and teases her until she must use his tie as a ballast and pull him nearer, so close. But it's his voice, her name on his lips, which has true meaning to her, which brings her back to herself when she shakes and moans and flies among the stars under the shimmering carpet that is the sound of him. Sometimes, she makes him wear the apron Sometimes she makes him wear the apron. It's convenient to have something to hold onto, she tells him, poker-faced. Something to flip up over his face when he makes that disgusting expression just as he comes. He suggests they make love as the dogs do. He'd rather stare at her dye job than see the face SHE makes when SHE comes. She slaps him for that - just once, on the ass. It's enough to earn her a yank of the hair and a passionate kiss. This time against the baker's rack in the kitchen, leaning into his back, making sure it's his weight warping the iron. Let him take the fall, just once. She favors small trinkets. She has a taste for small trinkets. It's something he figured out fairly quickly. So he brings her rubies and bright citrus. Snowflakes from a mountaintop. Volcanic rocks. Figures of ivory carved by Venus for her pleasure. She prefers to use his weapons against him. To slather his skin in ambrosia and lick it off. To taste the salt of his shaft in tandem with a fine wine. To loop her diamonds around his wrist and hold him down. She has engineered this, this disaster. The firelight shows her triumph, her sex a vice, her womb a cauldron of creation. She walks away whole. She has enough limbs for all of them. She offers herself up - three holes, two hands, eyes shut, head spinning. She knows them, tells them apart through beardy kisses or forceful nips, tries to keep ahead of them in pace and rhythm, and pulls herself away from hands that tear at her hair and uses hips and fists for balance. Her lips sour, bruised. Control is a matter of self-perception. AJ thinks she has it, in the end; is in control of her own destiny, body and soul. They can reduce her to her parts, but she walks away whole. The hair pulling contest afterward almost feels like a relief. WARNING: contains dubious consent. They've had another fight, another stupid disagreement about pay-offs and flights and scheduled pay-offs. If Shawn was expecting Bret to nearly bite his face off he didn't show it; they were naked, angry, and a little drunk on their own self-importance and aggression. The kisses that followed were mutually shocking, adding another level to their aggression. Each would silently blame the rough friction on the other man; the wall-eyed climaxes a mutual forgotten memory. The hair-pulling contest afterward feels like a relief, because it's familiar territory. Shawn lies on the floor of the locker room, scalp stinging, convincing himself to forget. Shouldn't she give him this? WARNINGS: Beast/Werewolf Sex Hunger is the name of the game tonight. Sharp, flashing teeth of a predator sinking down into the dark soft flesh of her inner thigh; practiced trembling turning to genuine, rolling ejaculations of terror - lust. His fur is a sweat-matted thatch upon his chest and her fingers sink through it, scraping, scraping, like a fox running for its burrow. She opens and sweats, dripping, dripping down into his gaping mouth. The tongue flicks like a serpent's tail as he crawls over the terrain on his belly for her. He's such a good puppy. Why shouldn't she give him this? Leslie knows three things about life... Leslie Knope knows three things about her life for sure: positivity can accomplish anything, waffles are nature's most perfect food, and she has the best husband ever. She bets that other women don't have guys in their lives willing to go the distance and wake up at three in the morning to drive through a blizzard just to try a brand-new waffle joint that opened down the block. So even though she knows nothing about DC canon (as Ben calls it), she dresses up as Batgirl and they go to Ann's Halloween party together as a totally awesome crimefighting duo. And then she rides him, cowgirl-style in her office chair, while still wearing most of that Batgirl costume and he does his Christian Bale voice. Even though the mock-pleather squeaks loudly and Jerry keeps knocking on the door every five minutes, it's the best Halloween she's had since the year that Hershey Syrup truck overtuned on route ten. She sleeps naked? She sleeps naked? Of course she sleeps naked. She sleeps naked in the sunshine with Pascal tucked into her shorn, dark hair, arms crossed behind her head and her thigh drifting back and forth against the warm, sweet-smelling grass. She hides herself away from them, from the duty pitched upon her shoulders, by running to the deepest field and lying among the cattails. He watches her from a distance, protective of her, of his glib belief in goodness. Wanting her. Refusing to ever force her. That sort of love - rich and true - will keep his thoughts dirty and his hands clean. Gabrielle gets an \"a\" for effort. Her hands are slim and white and they smell of ink and freshly stretched parchment. Xena kisses each finger, finding the newborn calluses that have developed over the past few weeks, as sign of Gabrielle's relentless weapons training. She so wanted to impress the woman she had deemed her friend, her soulmate. Gabrielle's hands gave away her patrician upbringing - white on Xena's bare, toned belly, white against the jet black of her best friend's hair. White and glistening after delivering mind-blowing pleasure to her lover, and curled like soft, wilting flowers against the bedroll, shaking slightly after a sweet orgasm. Domestic bliss doesn't suit them. Michael has an eye for detail. He knows exactly when Fiona's reached her breaking point - though even the most inobservant man would be blistered by a stream of squealed Gaelic curses and feel the stinging strike of her nails, and drawn a conclusion. She has brought him to this fairytale wilderness, this place where neither of them rest easy in the blue-burred pines. When Charlie sleeps, the sex is more desperate, less romantic than it was back in Miami. His keen eyes tell him she's settling with every squeal and spank. A new red dress hangs in the closet. She ordered it from an outlet store at fifty percent off, using a proxy and a drop-box in town under another assumed name. It's too big for her small, birdy body, but when he looks at her, sees her covered in cookie dough or Charlie's puke or mud from the washed-out drive and he closes his eyes and sees her straddling his hips in the loft in her sweats, or walking toward him in that perfect red dress, her perfect red heels. Maybe someday she'll be that woman again. Gaston doesn't want to brag, but... Marriage comes with its own special annoyances and advantages. In Belle and Gaston's case, it was her insatiable curiosity and her incredibly formidable intelligence. For all of his vows of dominance, he could not gainsay the slippery miss who was his wife. As for life in their marriage bed...well, Gaston didn't want to brag........Of her amazing, mind-blowing skills. She was no whimperer, his Belle; she'd taken quite well to the task of creating an heir and made it an art. But here was the tricky part - Gaston couldn't convince himself that he was actually in charge of their marital congress. For she had finessed him with her book learning; bewitched him with it. Each night provided a brand-new erotic delight, carefully learned from one of Belle's voluminous library volumes. The latest diversion had been from chapter five. Bondage...for Gaston, and a thin leather flogger for Belle, of course. Gaston had trembled eagerly under her light blows, had even lain still and taken her teasing with good humor. She smothered him with her juicy sex and he lapped her to a contented orgasm before she relieved his desire with a handjob. \"And that concludes tonight's lesson,\" she said, wiping her palms on a handkerchief, tucking the trappings of her mistresshood away before rejoining him in bed. \"But wait!\" he gasped, shaking off the ropes binding him to the bed. \"What's in chapter six?\" \"No skipping ahead,\" Belle said primly, then rolled over, curled up and fell into a perfect and dreamless sleep. Scarlett owns Tara, lock stock and barrel. But she can't own Rhett... WARNING: Contains rough sex. Tara is Scarlett's private domain, down to the last nail. Her bedroom is largely unchanged in its girlish sterility; Rhett almost expects Gerald to burst through the bedroom door waving his cane and threatening to horsewhip the thief of his daughter's virtue. She thinks Rhett ought to be honored that she chooses to even look at him within its bounds, much less make love to him there. Which is why he's been so damnably charming; he's bound and determined to make her claw him, make her scream her delight. He knows Scarlett's greatest loyalty is to herself, and so he works twice as hard to make her moan and writhe for him. Bruises and kittenish smiles mark each victory. In which negotiating sex in a cramped bed in an Ewok village leaves something to be desired. \"I should've guessed that the beds would be this small. Are you okay, Leia?\" \"Sure, Han. It's every girl's dream to have her first time flat on her back on a strange Ewok's bed.\" \"Ouch. Leave the sarcasm to me from now on, Princess. It's kind of my thing.\" \"And honesty isn't your thing, which is why, as you said, I keep giving you the third degree.\" \"Come on, sweetheart...\" \"Han. Was I really fine?\" \"Couldn't you tell? You were amazing.\" \"Judging from what we just did you'd say a tube sock was amazing.\" \"Just take my word for it. Unless you'd rather take my...\" \"Nerf Header.\" \"Music to my ears. Do you have enough blanket?\" \"Mmm...you should take more of it. You aren't still cold from the carbonite?\" \"It's been days! Quit fussing over me, you're worse than Chewie!\" \"It's hard for me not to fuss. You didn't see yourself...\" \"Shh. Hey, it's all right. We're both all right....well, hello, little miss Uh...are you trying to keep me warm?\" \"Shh. I'm going to show you I'm better than a sock.\" \"But you....Princess, I don't know how they taught anatomy back on Alderaan, but that's not how you keep a guy warm.\" \"Is it?\" \"....I take it back. This is lot better than the fire.\" \"...Okay. Okay, wow. Woah. Your elbow's in my....my knee...ooh, okay...Han! Yes.\" \"Just like this....too much?\" \"No, damn it!\" \"Ow!\" \"Han?\" \"Leia!\" \"...This blanket's making me too hot. Have it burned by morning.\" \"There's my princess. Are you sorry you didn't wait?\" \"No, and I wouldn't change a thing. I...\" \"Yeah, me too. I know.\" \"I know. Goodnight.\" One day, she'd be able to fly... Worshipping a woman up-close is quite a different from lusting after her from afar, or puppy-loving her as a teenybopper teenage fan. AJ's fingers examine the broad curves of Lita's sleeping body as she imagines the evening to come. One day, she decides, she's going to be just like this woman, this imposing, perfect redhead who cries over bulldogs and knows how to play three different instruments, who's chronicled her entire life on her skin and knows how to make a woman's eyes roll all the way back in their skull. AJ would absorb these skills, make them hers, improve and evolve and become the sort of woman women and men would want to have a beer with.She would have to be patient - but spiders were hatched to wait. One day she'd be able and ready. The search for the elusive g-spot commences... Some men spend their whole sexual lives on one struggle: finding the clitoris. Some treated it like a fabled, holy bit f flesh that no mortal person could possibly possess. And they spend their entire lives looking for it, just to make their women happy. In Lita and Trish's relationship, replace 'clitoris' with g-spot. And it's not as if they weren't trying to find the stupid lump of tissue hidden deep within them. They bought vibrators and wands and things with curved heads that looked like dolphins. They sat upon a Sybian and clung to each other and tried to distinguish between different kinds of orgasms as they ran together. Manuals were bought and consulted the way their colleagues studied dirt sheets. Neither of them managed to ejaculate, but having shared countless orgasms, neither cared. High above the Silk Road, Ping and Jasmine come to an understanding. The trip was an endless, dusty one over miles of unfamiliar land. Fortunately, the Emperor had sent his royal guard to guide the recently-engaged Agrabahian princess over the mountains to a trade talk. After days of dust and slow progress, Mulan suggested her personal guard, Ping, take a break and go for a short flight on her fiance's flying carpet. After Ping was assured of the vehicle's safety, the two boarded and sored to the head of the caravan, keeping at a good distance from the crowd without losing track of them. Harmless diversions, in Jasmine's youthful opine, were good for the soul. \"This is so much better. We should have flown from first light,\" Jasmine observed, crossing her legs against Carpet's back as the wind brushed back her hair. She noticed suddenly that her companion stared openly at her face, as if he couldn't quite hear what was being said. \"Do you like the view, Ping?\" Ping's eyes shot away from Jasmine's face and he flushed. \"Uh- er, yes, Sultana Jasmine. It's lovely.\" She grinned. \"You don't have to flatter me.\" \"It's not flattery - you're really beautiful!\" Ping's voice cracked. \"As your Serene Highness.\" Leaning over, Jasmine pecked the soldier upon her cheek. \"Ping, have you ever made out while flying over the Silk Road?\" \"No, Sultana.\" Ping's eyes scrambled over Carpet's elaborate design, searching for a reason why not, as Jasmine crawled toward him. \"Just Jasmine,\" she said, cupping the youth's cheek. \"And you're about to.\" Nina's a total bitch when she's all wound up... WARNING: Contains drunken sex. Nina's a total bitch when she's wound up. She won't even smoke a cigarette or pop a Percocet or anything. It's such a drag on Lily's nerves that she spends more time trying to figure out how to fix Nina's attitude than how to transition from hold to point to plie. Lily figures her out, and then figures out how much booze it takes to make Nina lose her tight-assed grip on the world. A little necking in a club, a little time in a tattoo parlor getting a 'bestie's' tattoo, and a quick fuck in the building's elevator. Lily licks along the edge of the tattoo as she finger-fucks the cute brunette, making her bit her lip til she tastes blood, feeling the raised contours of the freshly-injected ink under her own tongue. Lily's not bothered by Nina's shrieking; she knows a little bit of pain just heightens the orgasm. She bites down and thumbs Nina's clit and she shatters just like a mirror. Roger and Stan get a little caught up in their play-acting. WARNING: Contains canon-typical gross-out humor and alien biology. Stan violently rustled the pink pages clutched in his grip, ruffling the rim of the straw hat perched on his head. He knelt between Roger's thighs and on the fetching plaid dress he'd spent HOURS hand-stitching. It was a miracle that the two of them had been asked back to participate in a reading at the community playhouse, but they were extremely short-handed down there. Thanks to a reckless limo driver. And his goldfish sidekick. \"Okay! I'm a farmer,\" Stan said. \"You're my wife, we're celebrating the end of a drought and...go!\" \"Oh Jim,\" Roger said, artificially pitching his voice higher. \"Hold me in the rain! Love me in the rain!\" \"Bertha! Wash my sins away! Wash me like a laundry washes the blue jeans!\" Stan was getting into it - really into it. Something in Roger responded with equal fervor and he reached for the collar of his dress. He tore at the edgepiece, ripping it open at several strategically pre-torn junctures which had been sealed with Velcro closures. And Stan threw himself onto Roger's belly and well...the tongue and every other organ wanted what it wanted. The next ten minutes were a total blur to Roger - the ecstasy he'd taken in the bathroom was terrible for his concentration - but when he snapped back to attention he was on his knees, in the middle of one hell of an orgasm and wedged against the bedframe under Stan's weight. Stan was a wheezing, moaning lump pressed against Roger's rear end. \"Roger. Don't tell. Francine. We just...performed anal coitus.\" Roger took a moment to analyze the sensations \"Uh, Stan. That's not my ass.\" Stan stopped moving. \"Yeah. Yeahhh, you just splooged in my fourth belly button. Yeah, that's definitely a belly-button. Don't do anything. Shh! Savor the moment...oh...\" They were both abruptly inundated with a flood of thick yellow liquid. \"Just like a car wash.\" Roger said neutrally. Fred sticks to his promises... Fred's never going to tell Daphne this. Nope, he's totally going to his grave with it. Okay, that hour he spent alone with Velma in a gas station bathroom between hunts happened, but it's a total secret. He made Velma swear on a stack of Nerd Bibles that she'd never talk about the time he went down on her kneeling against the cold tile floor. That stack of Doctor Who graphic novels were a promise that she'd never tell anyone that she jerked him off, spattering her glasses with a stream of his come. The tricky part - the deep, secret, hidden part - was that he sometimes watches her do brainy stuff, or weaving nets, or just laugh while brushing back a hank of her dark hair, Fred wished that it wasn't such a secret. But they'd promised, and until she changed her mind he was bound to stick to it. They have drunken sex in the nearest and most convenient place. WARNING: Contains drunken sex Pink - up against the wall, down against the closet. Becca is loud and nervous, biting down on the inside of her cheek as she loses ground in her tiny heels, her nails are still slick with polish Rita'd helped her apply a second before. She doesn't seem to remember that her sons are downstairs from the sounds she's making. Becca inhales the scent of hairspray and cheap wine and grunts again as a slick thumb finds her clitoris. \"Look at you blushing,\" Rita chants, and laughs, her middle finger teasing toward Becca's ass. She tastes mojito lipgloss as she comes. Life goes on, long after the thrill of living is gone She remembers the first time she saw him. He was a senior and she was a freshman, and he told her that she looked great - that her jeans were out of sight. The next five years of her life were all parties and backseats, hickies and spin-the-bottle and making love in the woods. Her whole life was a Van Morrison song, and she was the original brown-eyed girl. They were supposed to get out, somehow. One day, when the time was right, she'd break her piggy bank and Jackie would cash in all the war bonds his grandpa kept hidden under the floorboards of the old farm house. They'd go to Omaha; they'd get a room at the Omni and make love on satin sheets. She could already feel the heat of his breath on the back of his her neck; she could feel his long fingers exploring her body with practiced familiarity. Then the big a came to sweep them both away - adulthood, the bugaboo that arrives for every man and woman. They graduated with promises and deathless cries of passion on their tongue, but it was harder to write about what they felt than to neck in the tall grass. Diane took college courses in North Dakota; Jackie hung around his dad's filling station. He was there the night the place was robbed. Two bullets ended all of Diane's dreams of a thrilling life. Diane moved to Wichita, entered the secretarial pool and soon became a housewife. Three children later, her husband took a promotion and the entire family moved back to where it all began. Time had chosen to stand still in Diane's little hometown hamlet. The realization comes on her while she's waiting at the bus stop for her daughter: no matter where she goes Cutter's Gap will always be the same. The Tastee Freeze will always have five-cent vanilla cones on Saturday nights, and the Foreign Legion will always hold bingo on Sundays and dances on Fridays and have a manger filled with baby pigs and a plastic Jesus on the front lawn on Christmas Eve. She wonders what Jack would make of it all. She can't bring herself to go to his grave, to acknowledge his death as a permanent separation. She still has his class ring somewhere in the back of her closet, inside of a shoebox with her homecoming queen sash. She takes it out when she feels dead inside, remembers Jack doing his terrible James Dean impression, and laugh again at the weird, magnetic, healing grip of her sixteenth year. Rosa and Jake have differing POVs on their first encounter back in the academy. This is how Jake's story. It's all about how he met Rosa, and he tries to avoid telling it until, gosh darn, he's forced into it. Most of the people at the 99th believe it's true, and he'd swear on a stack of moldy New Yorkers that he's not lying but only the very, very brave have asked Rosa to verify the claim. He sets the scene like Sophia Petrilo on Spanish fly: picture it: The Brooklyn Police Academy, 2003-ish. They were in the locker room after target practice and he asked her what all the leather she was donning was about. Then he asked if she had a Fonzie fetish and then she said something kind of rude that he swears he can't remember, and she pushed up against a bench and stuck her tongue down his throat, her hand ripping at his fly. And then there was, in Jake's words, sex stuff. It's so like Rosa that no one questions his story, though when he tells it Santiago rolls her eyes and walks off. Rosa doesn't deny it when the braver ones ask. She just says, \"it's what Brando would've done,\" then goes back to polishing her gun. Ann comes to Leslie's for a sleepover. Their eventual tipsiness takes them to unusual places. WARNING: Contains drunken sex Only Leslie Knope would bring wine coolers, a box of waffle mix and a stack of delivery menus to a sleepover. She wanted everything to be just like it was when she was a teenager, she insisted, before drinking half the carton, braiding Ann's hair, putting on a terrible horror movie, painting her nails and crank-calling Jerry, all in a swift hour. \"You got drunk in high school?\" \"Oh Ann, you beautiful, innocent otter.\" Leslie pecked her on the cheek and ran off to pop more popcorn. Left behind, Ann kept chugging her passion fruit and kiwi mixer - and when Leslie didn't pop up, she crept down to the kitchen, calling her name. She'd been hiding behind the oven and as she burst forth to scare Ann her best friend noticed that somehow - for some reason - she'd doffed her blouse and bra. \"...Leslie?\" Ann's brain refused to work. But Leslie immediately volunteered the information she sought. \"I froze my own bra!\" she shouted. Ann shook her head. \"That's not funny!\" Ann giggled into her fist. \"It's slumber party tradition!\" She started belly laughing and Leslie, with a perfectly serious expression upon her face, said, \"Ann, give me your bra.\" Leslie tackled her, and both women rolled around the floor, squeaking unto laughter. The rolling ended with tickling, the tickling ended with kissing, and the kissing soon moved toward portions of their anatomies other than their lips. Her breasts tasted of straight sugar. Ann licked and nibbled at Leslie's pink nipples and absently thought about asking her what sort of lotion she's using. Then she was flat on her back and Leslie was clumsily straddling her face and then falling nose-down into Ann's sex. Going down on Leslie was harder than she'd anticipated - the girl was a mover and a moaner and she kept falling sideways out of the reach of Ann's tongue and fingers. Once she anchored Leslie down, Ann replicated on her all of the things she loved having done to her - all of the things she'd asked for from her boyfriends but never received with proper respect or fervor. She moaned at Leslie's own fumbling exploration and concentrated, concentrated, until Leslie's throaty groans teased Ann's clit and made her twitch and scream. Somewhere over her head, Leslie was moving, speaking, rolling onto her side. \"I need a stack of waffles and a pepperoni pizza,\" Leslie moaned. \"Oh Ann! Did you see where I left the number?\" Ann had no idea, but Leslie was drifting off into pantsless unconsciousness and she had no way of telling her. This is the easiest resolution to their longing. It was an easy, quick, and smart solution. Shawn's rent had run out, and Topanga was in the eighth month of her pregnancy. Cory and Topanga hadn't spoken to each other for three days; he had called her a beautiful balloon and she had frozen him out for weeks on end. It was up to Shawn to solve the problem. He made them dinner. The sex was not planned; it had been the result of Topanga's swollen feet and Cory's lonely desire to talk to her and Shawn's rootless ramblings colliding. It was more of a long cuddle than a race toward orgasm; Shawn didn't even get off that night, not once. But it was the best time he'd ever had with a woman...and a man. They gave him a spare room and, when they moved, an entire attic. He never slept there. The master bedroom was his from day one. The kids never noticed, never cared: this was their family. It was an elegant resolution. Soon there are two kids, two dads and one mom. They were one big, happy family. Even without the sex they are, through and through, inside and outside of the bedroom, a true unit. Joey and Chandler make a game of watching scrambled Cinnemax. It was just an experiment. They were out of food, one of them needed to go shopping, but Joey had gone floppy with hunger, and Chandler didn't have enough money left to properly fill the cupboard. When Joey gets hungry, Joey gets tired. When Joey gets tired, Joey gets horny. When Joey gets horny, he shrugs and asks Chandler if their Cinemax is still scrambled. It's become something of a game between them. They pull it out, jerk it off, and make a game of it. Who can come first, last, furthest? Kari Whurr or Shannon Tweed? Count the sax solos! Just don't admit what you're feeling. Or look in the other guy's eyes. He takes her soaring...and he's also good at other things... Sheila. What was it about that name that always reminded him of her? It was probably the sex. The really incredible, ridiculously great sex with all of the nibbling and the sucking and the moaning and squeezing. He was in love with an incomparable commander and an amazingly sweet piece of booty and he was incredibly proud of each and every one of her special skills. Sheila's point of view differs. Malcom reminds her of flying. He takes her overground, into the blue-black realm of total ecstasy on the wings of a butterfly. And he's also pretty good at Scrabble. SO worth it. [WARNING: spoilers for the past few episodes of season 5 and Archer being Archer]. Archer's only suggestion to Ray is that they shouldn't make this weird. They're just meeting up for occasional quickies in the underground catacombs of Cheryl's family's mansion while avoiding the rest of their pissed-off co-workers and; normal, everyday hookup stuff. It wasn't like they were being watched; no, it was that Archer didn't want to explain it to his mother. But in Archer's opinion (the one Ray's willing to tolerate), it was totally worth it. Something about Ray's mustache just did it for him, and his arm strength was, like twice that of a normal man. So worth it. The girl gives him a headache. This girl makes his head ache. Other parts of his body, too, but mostly his head. She reminds him of Annie - bright as hell, obsessed with book learning, but totally clueless about the effect she has on the rest of the world. And it was all her fault. She was the one who had said the words, sucked him through time and demanded he help her. He give her credit for one thing. She was great with a hatchet. *** \"So where's my reward?\" He's standing on top of a pile of Deadites, former villagers who had turned on her beloved and brought his life to an end, cleaning off the blade of his chainsaw. She crosses her arms and glares at him, unaware of the visceral goo dripping from her pinafore and house dress. \"You weren't the only one helping out, Monsieur Ash!\" She gestures to the crowd of animate objects surrounding her, who defended the castle within an inch of their lives. They were in the process of polishing and cleansing each other. \"Yeah yeah...thanks for doing stuff and not...standing around laughing.\" His comment wins him an odd look from Belle. The candlestick hops toward him and Ash instinctively flinches away. \"Maybe you would like to stay for a petit bite before Belle sends you back to your world?\" \"Yeah, great, thanks. I'm starving,\" he adds, then stomps off to his borrowed guest room to clean up. *** By the time he's called down for dinner, the servants have cleaned the ballroom and crafted an elegant repast. Belle has changed into a slightly less bloody day dress and cleansed her hair; she almost lives up to her name, all clean and sweet like that. Ash has donned one of her old man's old suit coats over his torn but freshly laundered shirt, and he swaggers down and into the dining room as if he owns the entire place. He's only a little freaked out about the pre-meal song-and-dance routine from the the silverwear. Dinner passes uneventfully, and once the table's clear Belle suggests they have an evening entertainment in the solar. Ash has no idea what a solar is, but when she drags him there he figures out it's apparently old-timey French for 'big ass ballroom.' The old cellos and violins strike up a melody, and she leads him down the grand staircase into a dance. It turns into something of a mixture of modern waltz and old country reel, with Ash trying to draw Belle closer to him. She finally permits his dipping her, and he does it with as much flourish as possible. Their eyes meet. He gives her a bashful grin. \"So...how about a blowjob?\" Her slap knocks him into next week. **** The following day, she conjures the porthole with more finesse than he'd expected her to possess. He shrugs and accepts the favor, feeling the wind pick him up in that stomach-churningly familiar way. As he swirls by her well-braced body, far out of reach of her hands he shouts, \"I'd settle for a handjob!\" He never sees her bend over, but that pitcher's wrist is unmistakable. He knows it's Belle's doing when one fifteenth century French slipper follows Ash into the future and plops upon the top of his head when he lands on his couch. \"That's one hell of a girl,\" he declares, stowing it among his many souvenirs. \"And one hell of a primitive freak.\" Coming from Ash, it's a compliment. Robin and Barney help Ted get over Tracy's death. Accidentally canon compliant. The funeral is hell. Ted holds onto himself, onto his composure, until he's finally alone, and then he breaks quietly, grieving until Luke's forced to call up his Uncle Barney and his Aunt Robin. The wait is endless; he's so distraught that he spends hours telling his kids all about how he met their mother. The whole thing, winding from the time he first spotted Aunt Robin to the second he saw their mother at a rain-soaked train station. Then the story ends and Aunt Robin and Uncle Barney are ushering them out of their dad's study. There's muffled shouting, muffled laughter, muffled tears. Then there are sounds that make Luke blush and turn away from the door. He and his sister text and blast music until the three adults emerge, slightly disheveled, with glazed eyes and small smiles. Luke and his sister escort them to a movie, an eight minute walk to the center of town and then back. His dad insists on taking a walk afterward, and then the heavy, gray skies open up. Luke trails behind them as they huddle up under his mother's yellow umbrella, letting the rain wash over their designer clothing, cleansing their tears. It takes Tracy awhile to grasp the way the group works, but once she catches onto the dynamic, she's a natural. It's quite an adjustment. She has to learn how the dynamics of the group work, which doesn't take her very long but feels like a crash course in civics. Knowing about Marshall and Lily's marital issues and too much about how Barney and Robin work is uncomfortable, to say the least. They're so intimately acquainted that it's like living in a little pocket universe that revolves around Ted. She feels like one little planet in a galaxy of many sometimes. But she and Robin develop a real bond that helps her adjust. She and Ted are the ones who console Robin when Barney's away and she's stuck home. Her hands and her lips soothe Robin's brow when it's wrinkling; Ted's mouth ease the knots of stress in her spine. Together, they rid her of her loneliness in this long midnight hour. She presumed it an unspoken, secret thing, this kissing and entering and riding, these orgasms, these tears, this love. Later on, Robin thanks them for the 'sandwiches' and the 'bagpipes session' at Sunday brunch. Ted and Robin share a chuckle and move on with the day: no big deal, just a lark. It's like learning an entirely new language, but she'll crack the code one day. One day Robin will comfort her, she'll speak it with eloquence, the mother tongue of their love. It will double in her own, and she'll shine in their arms. You don't want to live with it, but you can bop to it all the same. It was inevitable. Even she knew it would happen, that she and Tom would break the friendship barrier and, as he put it, 'get on with our bad selves'. Donna figures out quickly that sex with Tom is way too much fun - kind of like a Kanye West song. You don't want to live it, but bopping along's all right. Their relationship teaches her how to Livetweet an entire sexual act in emoticons -which, for some reason, gains her enormous amount of followers. They're the Brangelina of Twitter, she tells him - almost as famous and PewDiePie and Martzia, but not quite as cool as Hanna Hart and her girlfriend whatsherface. Tom only sees dollar signs, of course. The tee-shirts that follow are a bit much, but she'll deal, and Livetweet that too. It's not exactly the way Zoe imagined it would be... [Warning: zombie!sex and all of its biologically gross implications.] This isn't anything like the fairytales Zoe read as a little girl. Not like those old black and white movies she used to watch as a kid, either. Frankenstein never got the girl, The Mummy never got to grope the starlet, and The Wolfman was shot through the heart with a silver bullet. Lying in bed with Kyle, she sees a lifetime of old lies falling away. Love isn't Romeo and Juliet seeing one another through a plate-glass aquarium - it's wiping up puddles of somebody's drool. It's sitting for hours on the floor making flash cards to help them re-learn speech. It's teaching them how to walk and talk again. He's been good, Madison says, rolling her eyes, puffing her cigarette. He's earned some alone time with widdle Zoe (she pronounces it just that way when they argue over which of them gets to play with him for the night - widdle Zoe, with a little curl of her upper lip). She won't interfere. She curls up in her princess bed and faces the wall, having the grace to feign sleep. Zoe shrugs, hauls her nightgown off and unbuttons Kyle's pants. The blowjob comes first. Sucking him down her throat, her eyes rolling back into her head, his flesh warms in the heart of her. She lets him go with a wet slurp and he springs free of her lips - rigger mortised to erection. Kyle lets out grumbly sounds of approval, a caveman's warble of pleasure, and clumsily pats Zoe's red hair. She pushes him back and straddles his hips, reassured by his grunts and moans that she's pleased him. Her own relief is secondary and so Zoe ignores the slightly dry drag of her own tissue over his bulging, scarred cock. Riding him, making his moans of distress rise from his throat into frantic animal cries, Zoe thinks about her lot. She thinks of the handsome, smart boy she met at the party, the one she fell in loe with. He'll come back, she promises herself - he just needs more time, more work. She doesn't wait for her own pleasure and hurries her hips along when he starts awkwardly thrusting up into hers. Orgasms have been a non-issue for her, anyway, ever since she accidentally killed her first boyfriend; she can't kill Kyle, but her mental block is so great that she can't get off unless Madison's there to help her. Much to her disgust. Kyle screams like a dying horse and bucks wildly upward before falling to his back with another moan. She feels a sudden ejection of icy fluid jetting into her sex and scrambles backward with a squawk, letting the rest of it ooze onto his belly. Zoe grabs a hunk of Kleenex and jams it between her thighs, letting it flow out of her body. \"Eww,\" she mumbles under her breath, carefully wiping away the gray-green gunk he'd ejaculated from her pubic hair and off of her vulva. When it's done she disposes of the tissue and crawls weakly back into bed. He bear hugs her from behind and pats her head. \"Zoe good,\" he says, and takes an audible sniff of her hair before dropping off. Zoe just faces the wall and breathes, breathes, reminding herself of her pumping blood, her survival, her eyes burning. Pam tries to help Lana work off her pregnancy hormones. Pregnancy hormones sucked the big one. Lana hated them; they had a way of making them cry when she didn't want to, her body ache in ridiculous ways and her libido rev at the worst possible times. Which was why she threw herself at Pam. They had complimentary problems - Pam had a coke high she couldn't fuck away and Lana's perpetual horniness. A little bit of fisting late at night seemed like a great idea. Which was why Pam was on her knees, minus her skirt and with her ass hanging in the air while Lana put a tube of Crisco to work. \"Yeah, get those big ass hands up there,\" encouraged Pam. Lana smacked her on the rear end. \"I'm concentrating. No speaky when I concentrate!\" She wiggled a finger against Pam's anus and earned herself a whoop. \"Hey, Timmy Big Hands - wanna learn what I can do with pool balls?\" Lana groans and thrusts. \"Nooope.\" \"Keep diggin',\" she encourages. \"You're bound to find some gold. Rolled Gold...hey, would you like some pretz-ACK! EASY!\" Lana tried for easy, but it was beyond her. They shared orgasms on the pool table, then spent hours looking for the missing 8 ball. a drunken interlude. They're just drunk enough for this to make sense to their booze-and-coke-fueled brains. They stagger up to the quiet peace of Fiona's rooms and run smack into chests of drawers until they roll onto the bed, cackling like fools. They fuck sloppily, half-dressed and halfway off the bed, and when Fiona's wig comes tumbling off her head in mid-scissor they both shriek and laugh, the belly laughs commanding their bodies more strongly than their orgasms. Afterward, they lounge on the counterpane. \"Don't tell anyone I stuck my tongue into your white-trash cunt,\" says Marie. \"As long as you don't tell anyone I'm a soulless harpy,\" says Fiona. And then they laugh together, as if they are whole once more. When Myrtle was young, she worshipped Fiona, too. [Warning: Underage] At fifteen, Myrtle Snow wanted to be Fiona Goode. She wanted the power she knew, the friends she kept, the cool blonde body in her hot red dress. Her mind orgiastically poured over the teen's frame, touching herself under the table. She learned quickly enough that Fiona wasn't a dream. Straight poison was more like it, dressed up in black pumps and wielding itself cruelly in the name of selfishness and death; heliotrope and nightshade with curves. At seventeen, Myrtle's fantasies of Fiona had died and fallen away. Now when she touched herself, she imagined a fully-stocked Bergdorf Goodman store. \"Think it would hurt?\" \"Not as much as hitting the damn floor does!\" Contains body horror, sex between two eternally decomposing divas, and mild violence. And so they went on like this, rotting at the knees, their joints popping out of place and their heads rolling across marble floors at odd intervals. Madeline takes it quite seriously when Helen suggests they staple them back onto their necks. \"Think it would hurt?\" \"Not as much as hitting the damn floor does!\" But there are positive points to living eternally. They travel the world in semi-luxury (all right, they actually have to stay at one-star resorts so that certain ~unfortunate smells aren't noticed) and at night, they drink a little wine and get frisky with their paintbrushes. Another positive thing about their eternal, rotting, pullapart life is that it's much easier to give head when you can detach yours. A misadventure with Monarch-engineered sex pollen leaves Rusty in Orpheus' debt. \"Oh COME ON!\" Doctor Venture's whine pierced the air as he gestured toward the erection gently straining the front of his speed suit. \"This is asinine!\" \"Hmmm...\" Orpheus took a look at him, raised an eyebrow, rubbed his chin. \"Have you been visited by Dean's pants-haunting chums?\" Venture gasped and crossed his arms across his chest. \"What?! NO! That idiot The Monarch sprayed aphrodisiac all over the hedges out front. Brock and I just got finished hosing them down. Thankfully the boys didn't get into it but, well - BOOM!\" He pointed at his crotch. \"Brock ran off to a whore house and left me sitting here without a ride to the Ginger Rhino.\" \"I see. Did you think I might?\" \"No, I was just...warning you!\" More arm crossing. \"Well?! Do you have any ideas? And forget masturbation! I had a terrible experience with Lubriderm when I was a teenager and I'm not trying it again!\" Orpheus abandoned his half-made quiche \"Are you suggesting I help you relieve THE STRESS IMPOSED BY THE HORROR OF THE MONARCH'S DEVOLITRY!?!\" \"NO! Rusty Venture is strictly for the ladies! All of this will one day by the property of Mrs. Doctor Thaddeus Venture!\" \"Then why are you standing in my kitchen!\" \"Don't you have some sort of spell that would get rid of this?!\" \"YES! It's called GOOD OLD FASHIONED ELBOW GREASE!\" \"Oh God. Is there...actual grease involved?\" Orpheus twiddled his index finger and gestured toward the kitchen counter. \"Sit.\" Rusty did so, to his amazement. \"When did you start doing mind control?\" \"It's one of the SEVEN wonders!\" \"...Soooo are you the next Supreme? 'Cause I don't want to be drowned in the bath tub...woah!\" Orpheus knelt before Rusty and tugged open his speed suit. \"Follow your instincts! ALLOW THE ECSTASY TO FLOW THROUGH YOU!\" \"THIS IS A LITTLE BIT FORWARD!\" he squeaked. Orpheus spat onto his palms and reached into the suit. The last coherent words Rusty heard for the next fifteen minutes were Orpheus shouting, \"MY GOD! IT'S A FIVE POUNDER!\" Andy and April's bi-continent sexy Skype chat gets complicated. \"So are the handcuffs cutting off the circulation to your wrist?\" April peered into the camera and added, \"that would be super-hot.\" \"I can feel my other hand and it's on my junk!\" Andy grinned. \"Right, so take it out and feast your eyes on these babies!\" April had apparently unbuttoned her sweater, but the camera showed nothing lower on her body than her shoulders. \"Oh baby. Your neck is so sweaty!\" \"No, I have my top off!\" she reached for the camera and pulled it downward. \"Andy, did you mess with this before you went back to London?\" \"Only a little bit?\" She glared. The camera died. \"Can I take off the cuffs?\" Andy asked the silence. It takes him an hour to find the keys, and a day before April's willing to talk to him. Madison gives herself to Misty, crashing and screaming. [WARNING: Contains Mild Dubcon] Madison didn't peg Misty for the rough and tumble type. She supposed that whole dying a million times thing was a drag on her sweet nature. Nearly beating the shit out of Madison afterward just confirmed Madison's opinion that Misty was dumb, possibly the dumbest bitch she'd ever met. When the sex happens it's a surprise, but thankfully a consensual one. Madison swallows her down. Misty still tastes like the sweat, of the earth, and Madison is compelled to give herself over to Misty, clawing and screaming all the way, but feeling more alive than she has since her stabbing. \"wait, wait...PAM'S the best sex ever?\" Archer pouted from Cheryl's ancestral couch, enduring the complaints of his bored ex-lovers by zoning out. \"You're turning this into the worst Saturday night I've ever had.\" \"Wait, wait,\" Lana cackled. \"Repeat that. PAM's the best sex ever?\" Pam, who had occupied the couch between them, lifted her eyes from her bucket of fried chicken. \"Hey, what's so hard to believe about that?\" \"No offense...\" Lana began. \"...Too late,\" Pam said. \"...But Archer and I had an actual relationship. With emotions and commitment,\" said Lana. \"Why would a bathroom quickie with you be better than the sex we've had over a gazillion dates?\" Archer stared at her blankly. \"Uh...you don't do that thing with your finger? Pam does that and it's AWESOME. MAJOR sploosh, am I right?\" \"I don't friggin' believe you!\" Lana said. Archer, to his credit, didn't shrink back. \"Look, if you're both going to be bitchy about this...\" \"HEY!\" \"...Then why don't you settle it in the Ring Of Combat?\" \"Archer, we don't have time for the Ring of Combat.\" But Archer had gotten to his feet and begun to re-arrange chairs and tables to form a ring around Pam and Lana's sitting place. \"Don't you both want to fight for my affection?\" Silence. \"You know, this would hurt if one of you'd actually say something...\" More silence. \"Anything?\" Pam eyed Lana. She shrugged. \"How do you feel about it?\" \"Eh. Might be fun - but be careful with those baseball mitts of yours! I need to be able to walk!\" \"Yeahh, now I don't know if I...\" Pam was done with hesitation. She grabbed Lana by the collar of her sweater and yanked her in for a kiss. Archer let out a 'whoo hoo!' that went ignored...until Lana and Pam's hands simultaneously reached up for him and pulled him to the ground by his dickey. Lana and Archer go undercover with a couple of swinging Hollywood stars - and then have to quickly improvise. This, in Archer's opinion, wasn't what his mother meant when she told him and Lana to go out with their new clients dressed up to 'entice' them. Lana looked great, but he wasn't exactly sure about the whole booty short/Spencers Gifts tee shirt/dyed red hair combo. Then their hosts started kissing their butler. Lana grabbed Archer's wrist before he could reach the couple and their servants. \"Just shut up,\" she said, grabbing him by his bleached locks. \"And follow my lead.\" If it meant having sex with Lana again (and again. And maybe again) then he would do just that. As long as she can keep Hope's lips on her clit, she'll be fine. WARNING: Contains Incest Hope runs away after a year of watching Liam flirt with Aly. Steffy knows she's end up in Paris, knows she'd try to find her - because she's the only Forrester Hope knows in Paris, and because - no matter what the DNA says - she's Ridge's little girl and Thorne believes in loyalty. They're incredibly drunk the first time they fuck, in Steffy's office, against her plate glass floor-to-ceiling window. The revelation is a bigger lightning bolt to her brain than her orgasm. Steffy doesn't need Liam's dick anymore. She doesn't even want a baby. As long as she can keep Hope's lips on her clit, she'll be happy. They'll go on living for the night. Angela tells her work friends she's ended up with a 'cool guy' like Shawn for one and one reason only: he's a great hugger. She doesn't mention that they mostly hug horizontally between shifts and midnight painting sessions, gallery openings and shopping trips. It's nobody's business whose hand she's holding, whose ear she's nuzzling, whose smile she misses when she's stuck running an endless tour for a group of snot-nosed teenagers and he's home trying to run their household. She'll miss his catering mouth as much as he misses her firm touch, and they'll go on living for the night. Fuck War. There's pie and coffee before they go upstairs, hands folded together and feet slow upon the stairwell. He runs his fingers through her growing hair and kisses her callused fingers before she can find the wounds on his body, the corresponding cuts made by rock and shrapnel. \"Fuckin' war,\" she says into his collarbone. \"Piece of shit war,\" he corrects her hair. \"Mother fuckin' damned war,\" she replies. The four letter words pile up in the air between them until they laugh at the pain, holding tightly to what they've preserved of the goodness and decency in their living years.

And Stacey loves uncomplicated more than anything right now, with the move's difficulty and Gavin's distance and her missing home so much. It's fun to go on a lark: to pose as nude models for an anatomy class, or try a few hours of clumsy rope bondage, or paint her whole body with bronze paint and pose like a statue for change at Piccadilly Circus. This is mostly because dour, sweet Nessa makes it fun and takes her mind out, makes it go pink with giddiness. Just one sentence from Nessa is all she needs. A \"yo, Stace, let's split.\" And she's packing her suitcase for a day trip, fully ready to run away together. AJ Lee owns a pink glitter Hello Kitty strap-on. AJ Lee owns a pink glitter gel Hello Kitty strap-on. Wouldn't Meltzer just love to have that headline? It's one little bit of information Steph's going to keep in her breast pocket for the moment, though. There's no need to let anyone else know that the broom closets at Titan Towers function as perfectly serviceable lovenests, and that kissing's a great way to muffle nervous giggling. It's a very cute strap-on, and AJ looks very cute while wearing it, especially when she really gets into it and her pigtails start swaying back and forth. She won't let Steph use them as handles, but she can grab her by the belt and yank her to and fro into and out of her soft, quivering center. As good as AJ is with it, Stephanie envies her for it. Maybe she'll ask her where she picked it up. Or maybe AJ will let ask her to wear it someday. AJ negotiates a compromise. \"Okay, boys. We can be mature about this.\" Cynical laughter from Punk made her cross her arms protectively over her bare breasts. She looked as cartoonishly upset as a hamster. \"Sorry, you said mature. YOU, mature. C'mon.\" \"Dude, shut up,\" John hissed, elbowing Punk's side. \"Dude,\" mocked Punk, \"there's no way she'll share us. Remember what happened to her last boyfriend?\" Cena glanced about himself, at the spare motel bedroom. \"Did somebody grab a priest or something while I was in the john?\" \"Why are you being literal when we're stuck in our underwear in this room? I showed up for a little bit of the old hot stuff and now we're gonna have our damn heads cut off by Psychobitch!\" She wasn't about to sit still and take that. AJ skipped toward the bed and pressed an index finger to their lips. Once silence had been achieved, that finger ran gently down their chins and throats, to their chests and their bellies, the rest of her falling to a kneeling position as it descended. AJ rolled took their throbbing cocks in her hands. She watched their dismay turn to rapt interest and smiled as she started rapidly fisting their growing hard-ons. \"If you're both good,\" she whispered, \"I'll suck on these beautiful, juicy cocks.\" Then she let them go and they bobbed. \"But if you're both bad, I'm going to go find Daniel and Brie and we're going to go find a comic book shop and have some real fun together, and then, gee, I guess you'll have to satisfy yourselves. Now do we have a deal boys?\" Two heads bobbed in concert to two much smaller ones. She smiled and leaned in. Cena is an annoyingly chipper morning person. Punk tries to distract him. Newsflash: John Cena is an impossibly chipper morning person. And he gets that way without coffee, which is all the more annoying. Punk squints against the bright fluorescent lighting of the motel gym they're stuck using and does deadlifts while listening to John do curls and sing Macklemore at the top of his lungs. After ten minutes, concentration becomes completely impossible. Punk drops the bellbars and gets off the bench, then approaches John and without another word pulls down his shorts and starts jerking his cock. It takes about a minute for it to be sufficiently hard enough for Punk's mouth, but once it is he sucks it down and starts blowing John, caring not if anyone else walks into the gym or if they were being watched. After a good ten minutes of hand and mouth play, Punk looks into his lover's face, hoping for some hint of sheepish embarrassment. Cena doesn't even look down. The idiot just keeps pumping his weights and singing, though now he has a dimpled grin on his face. Pissed off, Punk doubles down on the intensity of the blowjob, mentally calling him an annoying, smug piece of shit with every lick and hollowing of his cheeks. The singing changes pitch and tone as he comes and finally dies on a moan, and Punk feels the spasm, tastes the bittersweet slipperiness that equals orgasm. Punk finally lets go of John's dick and looks back up into his beloved, stupid face. Cena grins and pushes back his Patriots hat. \"...that was fucking awesome,\" he flat lines, dropping the bells. \"At least it shut you up,\" Punk says, and mops the come from the tip of his nose. \"Anything for a fan,\" Cena grins. \"Wanna do some deep bends?\" He wiggles his eyebrow and cocks his head toward the sign a few feet behind him pointing the way to the shower room. \"Is that what they call it on planet Fruit Loops?\" Punk asks. He turns his iPod off before getting a kiss. \"Yep. That's how we say thank you in my strange, alien language.\" John doesn't even bother tucking his dick back into his shorts as he grabs his duffle and towel and splits. Punk quietly stockpiles a few witty rejoinders as he eagerly follows. Stephanie tries to figure out of Nattie really IS read to ride... [NOTE: includes Total Divas canon but is, obviously, utterly fictional.] Nattie cringed as she walked into Stephanie's office. Getting called up was never a good sign, especially this close to Raw, and she was fully prepared to be sent back to Florida in total disgrace. \"Hi, Steph, I hope everything's all right....\" She trailed off as Stephanie spun her chair about. Her boss wore a see-through black lace bra...and a black harness and dildo. Nattie stood back and blinked, wondering if she'd somehow interrupted something major, but Stephanie swooped in to rescue her. \"I've been thinking a lot about what you said in your message, Nattie. You seemed kind of eager to have a little fun. Am I right?\" \"Yes, Ms McMahon...\" \"I assure you I'll be discreet. We wouldn't want TJ to find out, would we?\" She shook her head. \"So,\" Stephanie said, pulling out a large tube of Wet from the top drawer of her desk before rubbing a handful of it down the shaft of the dildo. \"Are you still ready to ride?\" Nattie just smirked and pulled down her panties. You try to tell him without trying... It's never as simple as saying 'I love you' to somebody who knows how big of a shit you can be but will still fly all the way to Texas to slow-dance with you and then make love out in the wilderness on your birthday. He's a city boy - back home he has more ties and tangles than you alone possess, with your legends contract, your almost-tween children, your hunting dogs and your fresh-killed deer in the garage freezer. But you both still make time, and he's licking your skin, kissing your cock, telling you all about love without trying. The ballet of their union, the beat of a heart keeping time. They move without thinking, without considering it, without even asking questions. Their hands are eager to be discovering, to be rid of the propriety of public mores. They are hands that know the roughness of plaid and the creamy ease of silk before discovering the rough edges of surgical scars, the tufts of graying hair, stretch marks that cut white lines through spray tans. Here's a thinning patch of hair; there's an eye that won't twinkle just the way it used to. Their hearts still remember how they were and don't care. The hands see the differences in the ballet, but the heart keeps its tempo. Rapunzel is rescued by Merida, but both find the elements a little rougher than they anticipated. Merida knew she would get away someday. It had been virtually guaranteed by the force of her will, a will that would not be bent when she turned eighteen and sailed away with a merchant trader to the far off sun kingdom of the Danes. She learns quickly to lie to her mum in her letters home. Merida's accommodations are less than genteel. She lives over an inn among rough tradesmen and soldiers of fortune, and holds her own with fists of iron and a dagger at her belt. She and Angus race over the waving grass, going from helpless citizen to helpless citizen, taking on the mightiest challenges thrown her way. When she finds the long-abandoned tower with its missing stairs, she expects to find a plot of jewels, hidden in some lost crevice under a rotting floorboard or in a forgotten cupboard. But in the highest room, she finds a blonde girl with very long hair and a chameleon on her shoulder instead of gold, a girl so manipulated by mother that the idea of leaving home panics her. Merida's no fool; she's heard often about the missing princess. One and one makes one girl who's been pent up for too long. It takes a long time for her to work her way into the girls' good graces. She can hang her hat anywhere, but the girl needs all of the confidence she can scrape up. Eventually, she learns her name - Rapunzel. And she and the chameleon leave the tower with Merida for longer and longer intervals, until soon the tower is a blurry object in the far distance. Their first night alone in the forest it rains. Wide-eyed, Rapunzel backs up against a cedar tree and shivers her fear, her loneliness, pinking her skin. Merida brings a spare blanket, sheltering Angus and Pascal before slipping beneath it the opposite end. \"If you're a wee bit cold,\" she says merrily, \"you should say so. It'd be a fair bit better than freezing.\" Rapunzel frowns and pulls the blankets higher, but Merida grins. She kisses the girl beneath her earlobe. \"I'll keep you warm, princess,\" she promises. After another hour, Rapunzel cuddles against Merida's side, the rough warmth of her cloak, and drifts away with her nails digging into Merida's side. \"Are you climbing rocks?\" she asks the breeze. Only Angus is there to nicker a response before she, too, is claimed by sleep. They're one hell of a dynamite couple - which makes him feel like a third wheel.. Sheila is loud when she wants action. EXTREMELY loud, like, stereophonic. She literally calls him twenty-one in bed, and he half-wonders if the boss can hear her. She totally ripped the collar of his shirt during that kiss. Not that ol' Malc has any idea what he's doing at the moment. His knee is pressed into Gary's face, and his fist is somewhere against his buttocks. No one warned him how difficult dping a gal would be - he's holding the both of them up, and for a couple of skinny idiots they're making his arm and his cock quiver about equally. They're one hell of a dynamite combo, but he already knows that they won't let anyone stay with them, not permanently, for risk that somebody else might latch onto the core of them, their true selves. He holds on and back by thinking of the future, with her breast in his mouth and Monarch's hand on his ass. Even as they come together, he's thinking of ways to tear them apart. Rapunzel finds a way to communicate with the mute guest of the Prince. Rapunzel took the first opportunity she had and ran, her bare feet blistering and her hair bleaching in the sunlight. She followed the coastline, past the village with its beautiful, hauntingly familiar palace to another palace on the sea, where her shivering body is warmed, her empty stomach filled, and her tired feet soothed. The queen of the household sat beside her for hours, talking excitedly, concerned about her feet, about what must have driven her from what was a comfortable place. Rapunzel could not bring herself to speak of Gothel, and so she said that her father had treated her cruelly, and she'd run off with her pet to find a new start. It was the queens' idea to take her to the water, for them to swim, to soothe her aching feet. Every morning, every day, she exercises her blistered, bruised limbs, until she finds strength, the princess providing a guiding hand, guiding feet. She was so pretty, so elegant, that Rapunzel wished she could be more like her. She loved her more than any woman she'd ever been close to, but talking around her was hard. \"You must really like the water,\" she observed. The queen got a far-off look in her eyes, and \"I used to,\" she said. \"I don't think you should give up something you love,\" said Rapunzel, paddling slowly. \"Not for an instant.\" The Queen bent to kiss her cheek as she passed by. \"Thank you for being sweet,\" she said. Rapunzel dunked herself underwater, trying to flush the heat out of her cheeks before climbing back onshore. The morning after, there are memories. And dress-up games! \"Oh my! Just LOOK at these darling little shoes!\" Tiana raises an eyebrow and tries to figure out how Lottie can be so blessedly casual about her own nudity. She watches Lottie's bare bottom wiggle in the air as she reaches deeper into the old costume trunk where her nanny stored their play costumes so long ago. A gal goes to sleep for two seconds and she gets replaced by a bunch of old memories. Lottie lets out a shriek when Tiana gently whacks her on the bottom. \"Youscaredmehalftodeathtia!\" She clutches her bosom, her peachlike skin a torch in the low light of the bedroom. \"Come back to bed,\" she urges, cocking her head, tickling Tiana's bared nipple. \"I'm getting lonely just watching you go.\" \"I need my slippers!\" She sashays back to the bed, sighing, the perfect halves of her bottom swaying as she goes, \"I'll catch my death like this.\" \"Then get back under the covers.\" Tiana says, bouncing along behind her. Lottie turns, grinning as she flops into bed. \"You're so good at persuadin',\" she says. Tia shrugs, joins her. \"It's a gift.\" She begs him, eventually. [WARNING: Incest] He still doesn't know how she got him out of the woods. Time slams by in enormous chunks, and suddenly he's back at the apartment with a broken collarbone and a criminal record. They still think he did it. Mia is the one who should be a fucking wreck, but instead she's completely calm no matter what the world throws at them. She doesn't even smoke anymore. Instead, she sits in a rocking chair and draws, waiting for a new foray out of the world. She doesn't even have nightmares like his, about shooting Eric, dismembering Natalie, burning Olivia. He wakes up screaming and she's there to kiss his forehead and sing him to sleep. Baby, little baby... One night he thrashes so violently that he rolls out of bed and onto his injured arm. Mia comes running, purring comfort, soothing him. When he rolls back into bed, she follows. The desperation in her embrace belies that cool phisod she's displayed for so long. \"Don't leave me tonight,\" she says into his neck. \"Please? David? Please?\" Then, into his ear, a siren's whisper, \"you need me, don't you?\" He kisses her then - her smoke-scented head, her eyelids, the corners of her once-scorched mouth, her chin, her chest, her round breasts and the firm, dark-rose nipples. \"Oh God don't stop. Don't...Don't stop.\" He pushes and pushes, down the ivory body, to her navel, shivers and kisses her thigh, again and again and again. She screams just like she did when she tried to stab him. David is worried about Mia. But he's ALWAYS worried about Mia. Warning: Contains Incest. David's worried about Mia. Of course. Hey, Eric only survived being possessed, having his lung punctured and losing half of his spleen, but Mia stabbed the stupid dog so of COURSE she was freaked and the whole world had to stop for her. Eric was surprised, even now, by his own selfishness. It was what had doomed the girls back at the cabin, but it still clung to him like a rotten smell, keeping him bitter and angry. Because David was the one working to support the two of them while they healed, he turned it on Mia. He had always been there for her, babying her, trying to support her, dragging her from rehab to rehab. His tolerance had finally run thin. She needed to get up and stop smoking, staring out the window and scribbling in that pad of hers. Now. He finally approached her, glaring her down, and she lifted her eyes and raised an eyebrow at him. \"Y'know, it was my idea to bury you.\" He gestured with his broken hand. \"Grateful. C'mon and get up off your butt.\" She smiles and spreads her legs. \"C'mon, Eric. I'm bored as hell.\" She waves her stump at him. \"And I'm still all phantom-handsy. Give me a little break.\" \"A break will make you think. Not-thinking isn't your friend.\" He pulled Mia to her feet. \" She grinned and wrapped an arm around his neck, kissing him. Eric pulled away after she wrapped his tongue around his. \"Well...this is refreshing.\" She gave him a crooked smile. \"I don't know what I'm going to do - or where this is going to go. I just don't want to be alone anymore.\" By the time David arrived, they were vigorously fucking cowgirl-style on the couch. \"Gaah! What the hell are you doing?\" She sprawled out over the cushions, firmly in full-on sarcasm mode. \"Fucking. Come on, David, join in!\" \"Right,\" David sat at the edge of the bed, morosely. \"I hope you're on six different pills because wow.\" \"Are you jealous?\" Mia chuckled, brushing him with the healed end of her stump. \"Ooooh!\" she cackled when he dodged her. \"You are soooo jealous!\" \"Mi, quit it,\" he growled. \"Nut up,\" she said, \"or shut up, baby.\" David stood still, watching Mia, watching her move. His cock was in her mouth before the sun set. Did this one reach for the gun? \"So then,\" Mary asked, her fingers rushing up and down his shaft, \"what does Kitty have to say to her public? Does she regret the wickedness she wrought upon her husband on that cold Chicago night?\" Billy tried to calm his choppy breathing enough to squeeze out words, feeling a momentary shock of amazement that Mary was paying attention to anything. She slid his prick between her breasts and started rising and falling, sliding it against her softness, her expression eager. \"Young girls should stay away from liquor and from the temptations of sex.\" Saying the word made him blow like Vesuvius all over her pancake makeup. She sat back, plucked a handkerchief from her purse, and mopped her face and chin. Then she calmly powdered her face. \"Did this one reach for the gun?\" You'd kill for anything, but I'd kill for you... Little Miss Bonnie Parker. What am I gonna do with you? You're a star, baby. I watch you make your face up before you come to my bed like it's nothing, then roll your stockings up and slide off the bed to spark more mayhem. You make love like an angel and you talk about being in the movies. You have a think for Jean Harlow, and you pretend you're her when you're tickling my pecker. But baby, there ain't anyone who looks like you when you're riding me raw, your eyes closed tight. Then you look away and say you want the stars to line your pocket. You wanna have so much money it'll never run out. We kill for each other. You kill for the power. You keep looking for stars, but that's all I see when I catch sight of you. Born to kill Maybe they were both born to kill. They had sprung, grown, with meat teeth and sharp wits, their senses honed for the vicious art of battle and conquest. High atop Olympus they clash and separate, clash and separate, their skin stinging from the impact, his cock aflame in the surcease of her ass, her sex, her mouth, his tongue licking flame streaks against her clit. In this biting, ripping, pleasure-pain filled world, there is no victor, no conquered victim; just two bodies trailing smoke along the beautiful night sky, their anger extinguished by the cool waters of their mutual release. Hannibal and Madeline's shared teenage years, bittersweetly told from his POV. The first time he saw her, she was six years old, and he was barely five. She had a tricycle and he had a daisy, and when she fell off of it crying he was there to wipe her eyes, then make her smile with the flower. It became something of a pattern. From upset stomachs and bad report cards to bad dates and flat tires, he was always there, trying to make her laugh, mopping up her messes. All through highschool - while he plotted his escape - she plotted a marriage with Westen. He had bad feelings about the guy, but she was stubborn about it, so they talked about anything else that came to mind. When they were together, it was as if that Westen guy didn't exist. It's her fault he loves a good Cubana because she had a habit of stealing her father's best cigars and smoking them on the roof early in the morning. He'd see her shining in the moonlight, her white nightgown fanned out about her bare feet, and climb outside to join her and talk about nothing. The summer after they finally graduated high school she told him that she wanted him to be the one, the 'first'. Her fiance didn't want to deal with the hassle. Even if Frank Westen hadn't been disinclined to cherry picking, Hannibal had a feeling Maddie just wanted to get the ordeal over with. He nonetheless gave his best to her, and she was properly appreciative of his tenderness and his passion. She came back to him the night after, and almost every day until his number came up in the draft and he was shipped off to Vietnam. He has fond memories of a girl with platinum hair and a farmer's tan, just over nineteen years old, lying sprawled on the tall grass out behind the football stadium with the neck of her shirt opened and her blouse untucked, reaching for his cock with two eager hands. All of her wanting, her emotion, meant nothing in the face of the tide of time and her commitment to Frank. On the road with his boys, far from the comfort of a woman's companionship, he wondered if she still kept Reds in her purse, if she still smells like dime store baby powder, if she still scowls when she comes. No matter how she's changed he sees her the way she was years ago. Still remembers her now, running through the fog-shrouded summer lawn, his flower tucked in her hair. Seducing Madison is an easy affair. Seducing Madison is an easy affair. The girl is undernourished in spirit as she is in body, and for all of her cynicism praise seems to be the one motivating factor in her life. So Fiona moans and rolls and squeaks and spasms and makes her believe herself indispensable, perfection, a sexual goddess. Surviving Madison is an even easier affair. Flies are much easier to draw with honey than vinegar, and there are quieter methods of murder than a quick slitting of the throat. And honey covers up the taste of pureed hemlock poured into a cup of post-coital lemonade. Madison's willing to share. Just a bit. \"Do you want to play rock, paper, scissors for his cock?\" Zoe cringes. \"Cut it out.\" She frowns at Kyle. \"Do you think he can consent to this?\" Madison raises an eyebrow. \"Uh. Hello? Do you think I can?\" Zoe shrugs awkwardly. \"You could probably learn?\" \"How cute. Are you trainable, Zoe?\" her blush made Madison grin. \"This is going to be so much fun...\" It's not an ideal situation, but it's the best either of them could hope for, and so they settled in, one hand upon his chilled cock, one foot cocked to the crook of his knee. Madison helps Misty after they get back to the Academy after the events of the house party. WARNING: Rape Recovery/Mentions non-con Zoe finds her crying in the shower but she never finds out why. Madison tells her to shut up, pushes her back against the cold tiles, and shoves her tongue into Zoe's mouth. She's all underwater tastes and desperation; her nails pull and knead and cut the vulnerable parts of Zoe, as strongly as the pity that lashes away at her heart. There's nothing specifically SEXY about the sex; it's about pain management, palliative care. Washing the blood away alongside their cares. They scrub each other clean before leaving the room, but Zoe can still smell the animal on them. Eponine disappears, only to be followed by Cosette. Nobody goes looks for Eponine when she leaves Paris. She finds a ship willing to sponsor a hard-working deckhand, and manages to convince them to teach her how to write in English. It's a pleasant trip, as far as she's concerned. It becomes far less pleasant when they find a fair-haired stowaway in a pair of castoff pants hiding among tangles of rope below deck. When Eponine vouches for Cosette she's put to work in the kitchens, scrubbing and chopping for the deck hands, growing lean and wary in her work. It's a long time before they meet and speak and At the prow of the boat they stand and watch the water slap against the figurehead. \"Why did you come?\" Eponine asks. \"It was lonely without Marius,\" she confesses. And then, quietly, \"I missed you.\" Eponine doesn't flinch when Cosette's newly-tanned fingers wrap round the span of her wrist. There was a world across the warm, blue ocean that they would soon find and claim for their own. It was the wrong death. She had a hard whiskey smile, teeth that sunk heavily into her bottom lip and eyes that flashed whenever she laughed. She'd spent half of her life running off to fight - first it was her father and his bullshit rules, then it was the people in the group home. She got sick of trying to do right but doing wrong hurt more than she'd planned. So she eked out a life from robberies and trailer park living, socializing with anyone and anyone she pleased to. She was a hell of a lover, and she didn't make a big deal out of sex when it happened. She was skilled, adept, shameless. When she'd come she'd bellow like a wounded tiger and throw her arms into the air, free as girl printed on a block of acid-blotter. She was their guru and giving her a child was a high gift indeed. But there was so much more to her than her sex. Anyone that pure was bound to be tainted, and her insouciance was only a front, anyway. In Dakota they shot her down, but in the deep south she'll lie, a little blond spit of a girl. She was wearing her old Sunday Meeting dress and a crown of crushed flowers. They outta give her a Viking funeral but death had finally healed the gap in the family; she lay with her mother's people instead, in the swampy earth. It was the wrong death. She should have gone down in a warm wreath of flames. Her prince does not share easily... Her prince does not share easily. Belle battles his possessiveness in playful ways. Teasing the Princess of Corona is one of them. The girl calls so many old memories to Belle's mind; her cloistered state early in their relationship, her ability to entertain herself with so little. She wants to pay tribute to that bravery, and so she talks her prince into sharing their chamber for just one night. They call her into the privacy of their chamber after supper, and she hovers tentatively by the doorway soon after they themselves had left the ball. Belle smiles and sits up, straddling his lap, burnished upon the burnished fur of her husband. \"Come on,\" Belle says, \"don't' be shy.\" Rapunzel, they discover, is never entirely immodest - but she does have a way of inspiring bravery in others. \"Ted, you've been a very naughty boy..\" It's Christmas time, and the snow's a sheet of blessed white purity outside their window. Ted knows what Robin likes with her cocoa - a shot of whiskey and a backrub. Then he nibbles his way down the back of her neck and across, rolling her over for a kiss, then burying his face between her breasts. He's about to tell her that he's hot for her, that he's ready to ram his candy cane into her warm stocking. Then her Mrs. Claus voice bursts forth in a plummy gout and extinguishes the mood. \"Ted, you've been a very naughty boy.\" He finds her shivering. He finds her shivering in an alley after the fireworks have ended. So much like Marius in her total vulnerability, and yet he's known this child for so many years that his heart aches to shelter her. No...she is no child now. And she watches him move with a newborn curiosity that cannot be anything but satiated by the morning light. She remarks upon the silkiness of the sheets before she does anything more. Then he kisses her fingertips as a gentleman should, her neck, her breasts, her waif-thin body. Her protests, his demons, flow away, fleeting like morning birds. The guy knows how to treat his gal. The guy knows how to treat his gal. It's the whole can-do attitude, the will-fix-or-bust ways. He'll study a problem, talk it out with her - and bring her scotch and cigars after a long day. She'd chosen well, quite well. Felix is an attentive, intelligent and intuitive lover. Whoever schooled that boy before she got to him deserved a medal of honor. His passion had bred passion in her, and he received every ounce of her passion in return. If she has a single complaint, it would be about that hammer of his. She knows he loves it, but wearing it to bed was a little bit much. He must love her, he's built a fire. He must love her. He's built a fire. Built a fire completely naked, mind you. She knows how he feels about getting \"Sir Happy\" so close to an open flame, but he's cursing at the spitting coals and rubbing his metal fingers against his bare left hand. She sighs at his antics and parts the sheets for him as he rolls into bed and presses himself, steamy, hairy, and grinning, against her bare, pale belly. \"Where's my reward?\" She rolls her eyes and kisses his lips anyway. He's loved. \"I'M the asshole?\" \"Asshole? Really? I'M the asshole?\" Ash's eyebrow bobbled heavenward but he was a littleebusy cleaning his chainsaw, too busy to fight off her accusations. Mia stomped over the bloody, mud-covered ground in her borrowed hiking boots, glaring murderously and trying to balance her shotgun on her shoulder. \"I had the guy! He was right in my sights and you stuck your nose in!\" \"I was trying to stop you from blowing your own head off!\" The glare grew sharper. \"The angle was all off! A little more to the right and you would've got him.\" \"Whatever. I'm soaked, covered in blood and I've got a piece of thigh bone stuck behind my ear. I wanna go home.\" \"And I wanna be under a Playboy Bunny,\" Ash replied. \"But we're goin' nowhere til this is over.\" Mia glared. \"A Playboy Bunny?\" HE squirmed. \"I didn't mean anything by it...\" \"...How much have I sacrificed for you since YOU pulled me through that stupid time loop? And you'd rather get fucked by a Playboy Bunny?\" \"Geez, pipe the hell down, they'll send scouts to find us!\" He pulled her around a stone wall for protection. \"PIPE. DOWN,\" she growled. \"Do you want me to be quiet, Ash? Do you really?\" \"Uhh....\" He began, but was silenced by her quickly pinning him to the wall. With her free hand, she grabbed him by the fly and zipped him down. \"Are you gonna check your frame?\" She rolled her eyes and pulled out his cock. \"Bullseye.\"",

      "Jasmine - never one for modesty herself -just strips away her gauzy blue outfit and joins the girl in the frothy waves.",
      "It would be bad form to deny the princess something that clearly makes her so happy, and Jasmine was never one to deny destiny, either.",
      "And so they splash and paddle, squealing at the icy pelting of the waves, trying to stay afloat in the churning current.",

      "And silencing his latest rant about 'the man' was as simple as straddling his face.",
      "Their relationship had turned Jackie into the queen of the cowgirls, kept her riding Steven's mouth in his back seat, her thighs tight against his ears, her red nails stroking along his blood bright cock.",

      "She is direct and quiet but gives him enough room to move, trusts him enough to allow him to pick her up and to ply her nipples with kisses and her belly with bites.",
      "The soft, wet pull of Mako's sex and the screams trapped within her consume Raleigh's attention, his lust.",

Sales Demo Phil O. <phil@sales.olympus> To: Aphrodite <aphrodite@olympus>Attachment--Presentation 3-06.ppt Aphrodite, One of our sales team, Psyche K., presented the attached PowerPoint at a sales demo today. It went over well. The client asked us to draw up a bid before we even left their offices. I think we should look into standardizing the sales demos in the section and patterning them after this one. Psyche is the same employee we discussed in the last quarterly sales meeting. Thanks, Phil RE: Sales Demo Aphrodite <aphrodite@olympus> To: Phil O. <phil@sales.olympus> Phil, We will talk about this in the next meeting.

Sales Visit Eros <eros@olympus> To: Nicippe <nicippe@thespiae> Good morning, You're scheduled for a demonstration of one of our products on the 23rd of this month. I wanted to inquire about the possibility of sitting in on your demonstration. As a matter of quality control, we occasionally like to sit in on our sales representative's demonstrations. This helps us to determine if they are upholding the values and service expected of an Olympus Corporation employee. Let me know if this would be a possibility. Eros Olympus Corp. Re: Olympus Corp.

Psyche_K: Not sure why there would be onePsyche_K: Evals were just two months agoIno_B: What makes you think there was an observerPsyche_K: He was just sort of out of place. He was wearing a suit and asking more complex questions than everyone else.Psyche_K: He was also really hot.Ino_B: I'm sure it's fine. You should tell Phil thoughIno_B: Not the part about the observer being hot, the part where there was onePsyche_K: I'll send him an email.

Thank you for telling me. Phil Whirlwind Sorry, no outfit post this week. I had my first major solo sales demo at work. I've spent most of my waking hours prepping for it. It's over now. I'm hoping things turn out well, but you never can tell. P. Transfer Eros <eros@olympus> To: HR <hr@olympus> I'd like to get one of the staff members from the sales group transferred over to a special project. Could you send me the paperwork? Eros Re: Transfer Demeter <demeter@hr.olympus> To: Eros <eros@olympus> Which staff member would you like to transfer? I'll need their full name and current title to draw up the paperwork. Warm Wishes, Demeter Re: Transfer Eros <eros@olympus> To: Demeter <demeter@hr.olympus> I'd like to transfer Psyche Kore. She's currently a sales specialist. Please keep this discreet. I'd like to have the transfer finalized before it is announced. Eros Re: Transfer Demeter <demeter@hr.olympus> To: Eros <eros@olympus>Attachment-- The paperwork for the transfer is attached. Let me know if you have any questions. Once you return the forms and we process them, I'll let Psyche and her manager know that she's being transferred to the Bay Office.

I'll IM her. We might not get a lot more chances. Welcome to the Bay Office Manager <bay.office@olympus> To: Psyche K. <psyche@sales.olympus> Welcome to the office. I am glad to hear you will be joining the team. The Bay Office is still in the early stages of being established. You'll find that I have a few projects already lined up for you when you arrive, but you have some flexibility on when you complete them. Take your time settling in. The Bay Office is an experimental project for Olympus Corp. It is important that you be extremely discreet about the operations of the Bay Office. Please do not discuss your work assignments with others, even inside of the company. I will be out of the office on business until further notice. If you need to reach me, I'm available by email. I look forward to working with you. - E Re: Welcome to the Bay Office Psyche K. <psyche@sales.olympus> To: Manager <bay.office@olympus> Thank you for your email. I look forward to working with you as well. Psyche Kore Psyche_K: Do you know who runs the Bay Office?Aminta_M: No clue. You don't know?Psyche_K: I got an email from my new boss, but they signed it EPsyche_K: The address doesn't help. It's generic.Aminta_M: Mystery... Exciting News People who follow me on twitter already know, but my company has transferred me to a new office in the same city. I'm sad to say goodbye to all of my coworkers (a few of whom are loyal readers), but I'm on to bigger better things. I think... The transfer was a bit of a surprise, but I'm still in the same city so it shouldn't interrupt my posting schedule. It looks like I'm going to get to helm more of my own projects (yay). Beyond that, I don't really know much. Surprises are fun, right? Okay, career talk over. Click the link below to see this week's round up. P. Comments - 15 Farewell for Psyche Phil O. <phil@sales.olympus> To: Sales team <sales@listserv.olympus> As everyone knows by now, Psyche's last day with us is Friday. I'd like to invite everyone to join us in the break room on Friday for cake and goodbyes. Phil O. Contact: Psyche Could you bring tissues to the break room Why do you need tissues Everyone is crying Send help I'm coming with a full box Aminta is bringing a box too Thanks. Hurry Contact: Psyche Help. I can't get into my new building What do you mean you can't get in??? I mean it is locked and the lights are off Wtf do people even work here? If they were going to fire me, they should have just fired me Keep me updated Did you get in? I gave up and went for coffee I found a door with card access I'm in! And I'm the only person here??? Maybe they are all on a business trip? There are no name plates on any of the office doors except mine. Creepy... I turned on all the lights so it is a little less creepy Someone just knocked on the front doors. I'm scared to go look. Just a flower delivery guy. My new boss sent flowers? This is so weird. You know that right? First day Psyche K. <psyche@sales.olympus> To: Manager <bay.office@olympus> Thank you for the flowers. They're absolutely beautiful. I've looked over all of the projects that were on my desk. I didn't get very far on any of them, although I have started to brainstorm about how to approach some of the issues we're sure to encounter as we move forward. Will you or someone else be around tomorrow so I can bounce a few ideas off of you? I find it helps to have additional perspectives. Psyche K. Re: First day Manager <bay.office@olympus> To: Psyche K. <psyche@sales.olympus> Welcome to the office. Unfortunately, I do not have an anticipated return date. I'm doing some work on-site for an internal client. Please feel free to email me any questions you have. If you need anything, email Services@olympus. They should be able to arrange for anything you desire. - E First Today was my first day in the new office. As you can see from the picture at the top of today's post, I suited up. Best to go to battle in armor. Turns out there wasn't much need. I'm sort of an army of one at the moment. The new job looks like it will be really interesting. I'm going to be building on the skills I gained in my previous position in the company, but with more room to experiment. I posted a picture on [Instagram] of the flowers he (?) sent me to congratulate me on my first day. Good things? Good things. P. Comments - 17 Questions Re: Cyllene Proposal Psyche K. <psyche@sales.olympus> To: Manager <bay.office@olympus> I had a few questions about the proposal to Cyllene that I'm working on. Is there a number where I can reach you? I think that my questions could be better explained over the phone. Psyche K. Re: Questions Re: Cyllene Proposal Manager <bay.office@olympus> To: Psyche K. <psyche@sales.olympus> Cell coverage is terrible here. You can try calling me at 555-0915. I am in meetings most of the time, but I'll answer if I'm available. -E Notes on Cyllene Proposal Re: Questions Re: Cyllene Proposal Psyche K. <psyche@sales.olympus> To: Manager <bay.office@olympus> Thank you for answering my questions. It was nice to speak with you. Psyche K. Winds It has been ridiculously cold in the city lately. My walk from my stop to my office is longer now that I've changed offices. At some point professional, warm, and stylish just don't mesh. Obviously, I went for professional and warm. If it gets any colder, I'm just going to wear yoga pants and a hoodie all the time or maybe some footie pajamas. Also, we have confirmation: my boss is a he. P. Comments - 8 Bay Office? Aphrodite <aphrodite@olympus> To: Eros <eros@olympus> What is this about a Bay Office? Mom Re:Bay Office? Eros <eros@olympus> To: Aphrodite <aphrodite@olympus> It's an experiment. Eros Contact: Eros An experiment? Testing new sales techniques Why was this a secret Ino_B: It's been a week. How is the new job?Psyche_K: Ok Psyche_K: I'm still the only one who works herePsyche_K: Except my boss. I still haven't actually met himIno_B: Really?Psyche_K: We talked on the phone a few days ago. We email all the timeIno_B: OooohhhPsyche_K: Nothing like thatIno_B: Ummhmm... sure Crunch time I'm afraid it is going to be bathroom selfies for the next few days. You can tell that I'm approaching a deadline at work when I start posting selfies from the ladies. I love my job, so I'm not complaining. P. Comments - 5 Contact: 555-2947 I hope you don't mind that I'm texting you. This is Psyche Kore. I'm on my site visit to Cyllene. They wanted to know when we plan to push the next release. That's fine. I would have to check with the programmers. It was expected in Q3. Thanks! Cyllene On-SitePsyche K. <psyche@sales.olympus> To: Manager <bay.office@olympus> The on-site presentation I did seems to have gone okay. The client did not seem particularly enthusiastic about it. I learned from talking to them that this was their 5th on-site visit from a bidder on the contract in three days, so they were all understandably worn out. I will let you know if I hear anything back from the company. I wanted to work on the Mantineia Industries project next, but if you want me to work on the Delphi project instead, I could do a little shuffling. Psyche K. Re: Cyllene On-Site Manager <bay.office@olympus> To: Psyche K. <psyche@sales.olympus> It must have gone very well. I've got an email from Telamon at Cyllene asking for a first round estimate. Could you work on Delphi next? - E Update on Delphi Psyche K.<psyche@sales.olympus> To: Manager <bay.office@olympus>Attachment--Delphi Project - updated.ppt;Delphi.xlsx It took a few late nights, but I got most of the presentation together. Please take a look at it when you get the chance and see if you have any comments. I got the package from Singapore this morning. How is Singapore? You're still there, right? Do you know when you might be back in the office? Psyche Re: Update on Delphi Manager <bay.office@olympus> To: Psyche K. <psyche@sales.olympus>Attachment--Delphi Project - updated again.ppt I made a few comments on the PowerPoint. You'll find them in the comments section for the slides. It may be some time before we meet in person. My position keeps me on the road most of the time. The secret nature of the Bay Office operations also mean that I can't be publicly connected to the project at this point. Maybe at some point down the line. But not now. I hope you understand. - E Contact: Psyche Did you order something? I had to let in a bunch of delivery guys with crates Yes. Could you open them for me? Is there a crowbar in the office? No. You might have to buy one. Went to the hardware store There are statues? Souvenirs. Could you put them in my office? Attachment--IMG 00238.JPG??? They're abstract. Black and White and Busy All Over The new boss and new job are still working well for me. I had enough energy to run errands this weekend. There's a cute little boutique in my neighborhood. It's been open for a few weeks now, but I've been too tired from my new job to get up and go. I stopped in this weekend and walked out with this scarf. P. Contact: Psyche What are you doing for lunch? I brought some soup Why? Aminta and I are near the bay for a meeting. Want to meet for lunch Yes. Got any ideas Idk Can we pick you up at your office? I want to see it It is nice but not v exciting. You are welcome to come It is on the 300 block of Shore? There is a good bibimbap place near there Sounds delicious. I haven't tried anywhere since I'm all alone Still no sign of your boss? No Weird He is super nice? And maybe a figment of my imagination? I sort of like him that way. lol We'll be there around 12 I can't even My boss is so weird -- [Instagram] P. Comments - 11 I stand by that statement I told him I was working late. He sent me enough Indian delivery to feed an army. I haven't gotten to know him very well, but he seems to be a really nice guy. He's definitely a nice guy if you're going by the amount of palak paneer delivered to my office. P. Comments - 4 So far Manager <bay.office@olympus> To: Psyche K. <psyche@sales.olympus> You've been in the office for a little over a month at this point. What do you think we can do to improve the environment? I'm looking for any recommendations, so don't feel like you need to hold back. - E Re: So far Psyche K. <psyche@sales.olympus> To: Manager <bay.office@olympus> My major recommendation is more staff interaction. I'm the only one here at the moment and it gets to be quite lonely. I'd like to have coworkers to bounce ideas off of. Sometimes the best solutions are found by just talking things out with another person. I would also like it if you were able to be present in the office more often. Having you more accessible would improve communication. I feel confident about what I'm doing, but having to wait on word from you can bring projects to a screeching halt. I hope that these were the kinds of suggestions you were looking for. I'm very pleased with the facilities and the workload. I would like a new chair. Some of the casters on this one are broken and I feel bad about taking your chair. Psyche K. Re: So far Manager <bay.office@olympus> To: Psyche K. <psyche@sales.olympus> I don't think we are ready to add more staff at the moment. The office is just an experiment. I would need approval and additional funding from the main office before expanding. There have been some conversations about it, but there is considerable resistance from the top. If you want, maybe I can set up time for you to visit the sales department at the main office. No one there is doing the same things as you, but they still might have some valuable feedback. Due to some of the same resistance from the top, I can't be around more often. The executives keep me busy and on the road most of the time. If I have the opportunity to be around, I will. Maybe once the office has a proven track record of success and more staff, I'll be able to step away from some of my other projects to spend more time on this. At the moment, I'm simply not allowed to be more involved. There's a great deal of secrecy about this project. If some of the investors knew about this office and my involvement, it might shake their confidence. This is why it is paramount that you exercise the utmost discretion and don't pry too far into the business of this office. Go ahead and take my chair. - E Re: So far Psyche K. <psyche@sales.olympus> To: Manager <bay.office@olympus> If there's anything I can do to improve the chances of the office expanding, please let me know. I think that some of the things we're doing could improve sales and customer satisfaction if they were rolled out to more sales offices. The flexibility I have in working with clients has led to higher sales and word-of-mouth referrals. It would be a lot of work to implement this model in other offices, but I think it would ultimately be beneficial. Thank you for the chair. I've put a note on my old chair just to remind you that the casters are broken. Psyche K. Candela I've been listening to jazz in Spanish while I work on my latest project. It is good upbeat background music, but my Spanish is almost non-existent, so the lyrics don't distract me. The mood has obviously rubbed off on me a little. Things are going good. I even got a new chair that the office! All of those people who made fun of me on Instagram for being so excited over a chair should hush. I spend 8 to 12 hours a day in that chair. Comfort and working casters are important when you're spending that much time on your rear. P. Q2 Manager <bay.office@olympus> To: Psyche K. <psyche@sales.olympus>Attachment--Bay Adjusted Figures Q2.xlsx Congratulations, the experiment so far is a success. The file I attached are our figures for the second quarter. They are pretty impressive considering we haven't even been operating for the whole quarter. Let me know if you have any questions about what you see. I credit our success so far to you. I owe you. - E Re: Q2 Psyche K. <psyche@sales.olympus> To: Manager <bay.office@olympus> I didn't get to see the sales figures in the main office, so I don't really have much to compare these to. I'm pleased if you're pleased. Does this mean I get a favor? Psyche K. Re: Q2 Manager <bay.office@olympus> To: Psyche K. <psyche@sales.olympus> It depends on what the favor is. - E Re: Q2 Psyche K. <psyche@sales.olympus> To: Manager <bay.office@olympus> Could we have dinner the next time you're in town? We could arrange it secretly. It wouldn't need to be anything having to do with the office. I really would just like to meet you. Psyche K. Re: Q2 Manager <bay.office@olympus> To: Psyche K. <psyche@sales.olympus> I'll think about it. - E Rays My boss is gone pretty much all of the time on various business trips. He sent me a sort of goody package earlier this week. One of the things in it was this scarf, which I absolutely love. It looks to be hand painted silk. I'm not sure where it's from since the things in the package were sort of a mishmosh of things from different countries. I'll be sure to ask him when I see him. P. Comments - 8 Contact: Psyche Thank you for the gifts. I thought you might like them This doesn't count for the favor I didn't think it did The coconut cookies were fantastic. Could you send more please? I'll send some more the next time I'm there. And the next time you're here? Don't push your luck I'm still thinking Mantineia Industries Psyche K. <psyche@sales.olympus> To: Manager <bay.office@olympus> The meeting today went well. It might take a little bit more work to get the contract in order than with previous sales. They're interested in some of the features we've got slated for development, but don't have in production yet. Implementing now would allow them to build a good basis in the main functions so that they are ready to implement the new features as they get pushed. Mantineia Industries, however, understandably wants some guarantee that the features aren't going to be abandoned. What's your advice? Psyche K. Re: Mantineia Industries Manager <bay.office@olympus> To: Psyche K. <psyche@sales.olympus> Go ahead and forward all of the relevant documentation to Legal. Anything we've talked about is a confirmed expansion of the program. They may have to be flexible on the deadlines, but it does sound like something we could do. - E All Work And no play is pretty much where I am in life right now. I'm spending most of my days at my desk, toiling away. If my boss keeps sending me fancy chocolates and cookies like he has been (see the picture above), I'm going to be round before the quarter is up. I had some successes with a few clients recently. I can't talk about them, of course, but one was big enough that I treated myself to the suit I'm wearing in today's picture. Yes, I treated myself to a suit. P. Mantineia Industries On-Site Psyche K. <psyche@sales.olympus> To: Manager <bay.office@olympus> I got the paperwork back from legal. They made a few notes of where you will need to sign the originals.

Re: Mantineia Industries On-Site Manager <bay.office@olympus> To: Psyche K. <psyche@sales.olympus> I can stop by the office and sign them when I get in from Vancouver tonight. Unfortunately, I've got to catch a red eye to Cleveland. Just leave them on my desk. - E Psyche_K: My boss is actually going to come into workAminta_M:???Psyche_K: Sometime late tonight. He has to sign some paperwork.Aminta_M: Why don't you work latePsyche_K: Why?Aminta_M: Don't you want to know what he looks like?Aminta_M: Ino agrees with mePsyche_K: Idk, he doesn't seem to want me to know who he isAminta_M: That is weird. There is nothing wrong with working a little over timePsyche_K: I'll think about it.Ino_B: DO ITPsyche_K:? Ino_B: The overtimeIno_B: Your bossPsyche_K: IdkIno_B: What is he going to do? Fire you? Contact: Psyche Aphrodite's son works for Olympus right? Yeah. Why? Is he tallish w slightly curly light brown hair? Yes. And v hot I am totally fired.??? Eros is my boss. Or was my boss. He was also that observer back before I got transferred What happened I stayed late to work on a project like I said. He came in around 9:30 I peeked into his office and freaked him out. He was very tense. He def was not expecting me Have you heard anything? No. I tried to make small talk. He seemed pissed. I'm at home updating LinkedIn and drinking wine. Hiatus I need to take some time off to figure out work stuff. I hope to be back soon. - P Comments - 20 Contact: Eros I thought about what we talked about last night. I'm not going to close the office. I may not have been clear. You do not have a choice. The bay office is closed. I am being merciful in not firing the girl. She didn't know what she was doing. Do not call or email her. If I find out that you have contacted her, there will be consequences. She betrayed your trust. I am doing what is best. Bay Office Closing Manager <bay.office@olympus> To: Psyche K. <psyche@sales.olympus> Unfortunately, Olympus Corp. will be closing the Bay Office. HR should get in touch with you soon about transferring back to the Business District Office. - E Re: Bay Office Closing Psyche K. <psyche@sales.olympus> To: Manager <bay.office@olympus> I am sorry to hear it. It has been a pleasure working with you. I appreciate the experiences that I have had here. I hope that we get the opportunity to work together again in the future. Psyche K.

If you require assistance, please contact Customer Service at our main branch. Thank you, Olympus Corp. Team Old Haunts Recognize this bathroom? I'm back in my old office. It was a sudden change, but I'm ready to jump back in head first. P. Comments - 5 New Friends I made a new friend today - a feathered friend I doubt I'm going to see again. Somehow a wren got into the lobby at work. It was freaking out and everyone was hesitant to touch it, so I caught it and set it free. One of the women from HR held the lobby doors with for me as I rushed to get it back outside. I still can't quite believe I caught it. P. Nauplius & Sons Demo Lead Phil O. <phil@sales.olympus> To: Psyche K. <psyche@sales.olympus> I know that I asked you to take the lead on this, but I'm going to have to ask you to step down and let Helle take over. This is a demand coming from higher up. I don't know who or why, but I'm trying to find out. I think there might be a mix-up in HR relating to your transfer back to main office. Phil Re: Nauplius & Sons Demo Lead Psyche K. <psyche@sales.olympus> To: Phil O. <phil@sales.olympus> I understand. I'll pass my notes and files to Helle. Psyche Ino_B: What the hell? Why is Helle leading the team meeting? Psyche_K: I got taken off Ino_B: Why??? Psyche_K: Phil isn't sure. He thinks it has something to do with HR Ino_B: How bad did you piss off Eros? Psyche_K: I don't know. Psyche_K: Pretty bad? He won't respond to my emails. Psyche_K: I'm going to contact HR. Transfer Issue Psyche K. <psyche@sales.olympus> To: HR <hr@olympus> Good Afternoon, It seems that there is an issue with my transfer to the main office. I was previously posted in the Bay Office for several months. My transfer back to the main office was effective a few weeks ago. I understood that when I transferred back, my job responsibilities would not be reduced. Is there some issue I don't know about? My former supervisor has been unresponsive to emails, so there may be paperwork that he has not yet completed. Thank you, Psyche Kore Re: Transfer Issue Demeter <demeter@hr.olympus> To: Psyche K. <psyche@sales.olympus> Good afternoon, Eros completed all of the necessary paperwork. We received a directive from Aphrodite to reduce your responsibilities within the office. If you would like to appeal this, it will need to go through her. Best of luck, Demeter Meeting Request Psyche K.<psyche@sales.olympus> To: Aphrodite <aphrodite@olympus> Good morning, My name is Psyche Kore. I am currently assigned to the sales department in the main branch office. I was previously assigned to the Bay Office, which has since closed. My job duties have been downgraded since I returned to the main office. Would you have some time to speak with me about this? HR said that I should contact you regarding this issue. Thank you, Psyche Kore Re: Meeting Request Aphrodite <aphrodite@olympus> To: Psyche K. <psyche@sales.olympus> I do not have time. The Bay Office was never an approved project. You should have never been transferred there. You were asked to keep the operations of the Bay Office secret, but broke your agreement to do so by inviting staff members from other offices into the branch. You also betrayed the trust of my son. It is only by his request that you still have a place at Olympus Corp. If you continue to be a nuisance and a threat to the integrity of the company, I may have to revisit this decision. Aphrodite Re: Meeting Request Psyche K.<psyche@sales.olympus> To: Aphrodite <aphrodite@olympus> I am sorry to hear that I have caused trouble. I value Eros's expertise as a co-worker and appreciated working with him. I had no idea that I had disappointed him or broken company policy. I apologize for my actions. If I had known the implications of what I was doing, you can be sure that I would not have done so. Is there any way for me to make amends? I appreciate still having a position at Olympus Corp, but I feel that I have more to contribute that my current restrictions allow. I would also like the opportunity to apologize to Eros directly. Psyche K. Re: Meeting Request Aphrodite <aphrodite@olympus> To: Psyche K. <psyche@sales.olympus> You will never regain my trust, but you might be able to have some of your privileges restored if you prove yourself faithful. Go to my secretary and ask her to take you to the filing room. There is a backlog of contracts that need to be coded in the system, digitized, and the originals filed. I want the backlog cleared by Friday. Aphrodite Contact: Eros Are you relaxing Sort of hard to relax when I have to work Do you want me to send you somewhere? Eros: Could you do me a favor? Baucis: What is it? Eros: My mom is making Psyche Kore from sales clear the contract backlog. Could you and some of the people in your office help her out if you get a chance? Baucis: She pissed Aphrodite off bad. Eros: Can you help? Baucis: Sure Baucis: I'll send a few up to help after we finish the daily report. Re: Meeting Request Psyche K.<psyche@sales.olympus> To: Aphrodite <aphrodite@olympus> The contracts that were in the room have been sorted, coded, and filed. If you have any more, please let me know. I hope that this demonstrates my commitment to the company. Psyche K. Re: Meeting Request Aphrodite <aphrodite@olympus> To: Psyche K. <psyche@sales.olympus> It will require more than a little filing to redeem you. I will contact you again when I have another task for you. Aphrodite Sprint Not a work outfit, I know. It is a workout outfit, though. I've been getting out and running more now that I'm back in my old office. Less responsibility, more time to do other things, like wind myself three blocks into my morning run. P. Comments - 2 Fleece Resources Aphrodite <aphrodite@olympus> To: Psyche K. <psyche@sales.olympus> I have scheduled a demo at Fleece Resources. We have been trying to get a contract with them for many years. They invite us to provide a demo every time they are looking to upgrade systems, but have yet to ever sign with us. Phrixus has been working on their account for many years. You'll need to get him to agree to hand the account over to you, then convince Fleece Resources to sign with us. Aphrodite Eros: I need a favor Phil_O: what is it Eros: Give Psyche the account for Fleece Resources. Put Phrixus on something else until after the next pitch Phil_O: He's been on that account forever Eros: Tell him that it needs new blood. He can have it back if Psyche doesn't succeed Phil_O: I think I can do that. He won't be pleased Eros: I owe you See me Phil O.<phil@sales.olympus> To: Psyche K. <psyche@sales.olympus> Can I see you in my office? Phil O. (Day) Trip For the past few weeks I've been working on an account that my company has been trying to get for years. I had to go on a day trip to their offices as part of the presentation. They took me out to lunch at a beautiful restaurant. I had to take a few pictures of the view out over the water. It turned out to be a great trip - I think I even might have convinced them to sign with us. P. Tartarus Aphrodite <aphrodite@olympus> To: Psyche K. <psyche@sales.olympus> Persephone of Tartarus has mocked up a few new possible designs for the promotional materials for our expansion into foreign markets. You will work with her on the designs to refine them. Bring the designs back to me. I have the rights to final approval. I will not tolerate you wasting my time or money. Aphrodite Re: Tartarus Psyche K. <psyche@sales.olympus> To: Aphrodite <aphrodite@olympus> I understand. I will be quick. Psyche K. Olympus Corp. Designs Psyche K.<psyche@sales.olympus> To: Persephone <persephone@tartarus> Hi, Aphrodite has asked me to work with you on the designs for promotional materials. Please let me know when you're available for a meeting so we can discuss your work so far. Thanks, Psyche Kore Re: Olympus Corp. Designs Persephone.<persephone@tartarus> To: Psyche K. <psyche@sales.olympus> I have some ideas, but I would like to know what you would like to see. It would probably be best if you came to visit our office. Let me know when you're available to meet.

Otherwise you'll never see Persephone. Take what Persephone offers you. Don't make any changes. Who is this? Someone who wants to see you succeed. Thank You Psyche K.<psyche@sales.olympus> To: Manager <bay.office@olympus> I don't know if you'll ever see this, but I'm sending it anyhow. I've been getting help from some anonymous guardian. My suspicions lead me to believe that this person was you. Thank you. I'm trying to redeem myself. I don't know if I'll ever win your mother over, but I hope at least that I'm proving myself to you. I value your trust. I'm sorry that things ended the way they did. If I had known what I was doing, I would have handled things differently. Thank you. Not sure that I can say that enough. You don't have to claim it, but I wanted you to know just how thankful I am. Psyche K. Ino_B: How did the visit to the graphic designer go? Psyche_K: Okay Psyche_K: Lots of black. Psyche_K: I'm tweaking the colors a little bit. Some of the slides are hard to read. Ino_B: When do you present it to Aphrodite? Psyche_K: This afternoon. Wish me luck! Ino_B: Good luck Tartarus Aphrodite <aphrodite@olympus> To: Psyche K. <psyche@sales.olympus> You did not follow directions. The design you presented deviated from our branding so much as to be unusable. You've wasted company time and resources. Get your files in order and talk to Phil about transitioning your projects to other staff members. HR will contact you about severance. Aphrodite What happened Phil O.<phil@sales.olympus> To: Psyche K. <psyche@sales.olympus> Can we talk? I'm in my office when you're ready. Phil O. Contact: Psyche Do you need anything? A new job? Besides that I've got LinkedIn I'm okay for now I'm sorry Its probably for the best. She was just going to sabotage me Maybe now Eros will pick up his phone. I really need a reference. Farewell for Psyche Phil O. <phil@sales.olympus> To: Sales team <sales@listserv.olympus> Please join us in the break room at 3:00 pm to say goodbye to Psyche Kore. There will be cake and refreshments. Phil O. Contact: Psyche What just happened? I just got recruited for a new job? During my going away party? I didn't think Eros was that good looking.

    "text": "He remembers. He remembers everything so clearly; as though it were only yesterday that he and his love had been standing at the edges of Olympus, looking out towards the Aegean sea. From their vantage point, it glitters like the clearest blue crystals. Zeus whispers to him, however, that the colour is not a match for the sparkling blue of his cup bearer's eyes. He can remember the days - and nights - spent on the warm sands, kissing the salt from his lover's lips and letting the water wash over their feet. The words sit on the tip of his tongue as Zeus... no, as Arthur, approaches him from the seemingly ruined castle of Avalon. The water here is cold, and the shore is more rocky than sandy. He can't imagine kissing the salt from Arthur's lips, can't imagine letting the water wash over them. When a large, warm hand closes on his shoulder, Merlin-Ganymede-Merlin, turns to face the God who rescued him, who loved him; the words freeze and he can't bring himself to tell any of them, least of all Arthur, that his memories are returning like the waves that lap against the stony shores of Avalon. He greets Arthur with a smile and a small bow of his head. The power that radiates from the God before him, is enough to warm his bones. It makes up for the lack of the warm, Greek sunshine of their former home and he pulls Arthur close with a gentle tug of his wrist. No, Arthur and the others do not need to know. He remembers Olympus and Athens, he remembers Delphi and Thebes, and he remembers the day he'd been whisked to the mountain by the wings of a giant eagle with eyes as blue as the sea that stretched out before them. He remembers, and that is enough for now.",

    "text": "I spit a mouthful of blood onto the boy's shiny brown boots and started to laugh; I couldn't help myself. Someone yanked the metal chain that wrapped around my neck with a quick jerk and I choked. The boy looked down at me with the same expression I longed to show him, but it's hard to seem haughty when you're kneeling on the floor with bound hands and a chain around your throat. He grabbed me by the shoulder and pushed back. My hair fell away from my face as I looked up at him. I could feel blood trickling across my skin, from my temple and mouth, primarily, to drip down my neck. \"Are you ready to talk now?\" I accidentally swallowed blood as I smiled, but there was still plenty in my mouth, the cuts refusing to heal even as I attempted to channel my almost nonexistent energy reserves into their repair. But I didn't aim for his boots this time. He let out a cry and slapped me across the face, moving quickly backward. I let my head hang forward, unmoving, staring at the floor to my left and breathed slowly. Magic is a funny thing, you know. Taking it for granted is one thing I've had the luxury of doing for all my life. Now that it's gone, I'm almost surprised (almost) at how much I miss it. My tongue felt heavy in my mouth, coated with sticky, cloying blood. I've never tasted that much iron before, nor have I again. It clung to my tongue, like sucking on old coins. I spit out another clot of blood. Some days just end up being worse than others. The boy laughed but he was most obviously perplexed beneath his facade. He pulled out a silken handkerchief from his pocket to wipe away the blood and saliva on his cheek. I would have smiled, but at that point it hurt too much to move my lips--one of them was slit through from the slap and was still bleeding onto my face and chest. Whoever claimed there was a difference between Dark and Light elves was lying through their teeth when they said it. Their sadism just takes different forms, if you're asking me, and I've never liked either kind. Of course, neither kind has never much liked me, but that has little to do with my opinion of them. Ragnarok came and went, but here I am. The world ended three hundred years ago, but they still can't seem to get over it. You might say, as immortals, that it doesn't matter when our grudge matches take place, as we have all the time in the world. That, too, is a lie. I've died before, and so has my entire family. We were sent back to Asgard. (But that's another story.) The elves, however, are not immortal. They long outlast Midgardians, or humans, but die they do. Nor were they much pleased with our return. There are many reasons they claim for their particular displeasure, but we all know the truth. All they wanted from us was our death, so they, in a mad exercise in futility, could attempt to claim Asgard's throne and halls for themselves. 'Tis my belief the only thing that undid them long enough for our return was the disheveled, dismantled state of my brother's palace. As I spat another glob of blood at the boy, I realized that some of them could also be particularly germophobic. I'm not sure why it was so funny, but I laughed. He sneered at me and I sighed. The things I do for my brother. I owed him, but I am highly doubtful of the fact that I owed him that much. He never took my protests into account before dangling me out as bait, though. I cleared my throat and tried to pass the time. \"See here, I'm sure in general you're a fairly pleasant kid, and all, but I don't much care what any of your superiors told you--this is going to get you no favors.\" That seemed to offend him. \"I'm not a kid! I'm a hundred years old!\" (To you Midgardians, that'd be about eighteen.) \"Is that supposed to impress me, boy? I'm nearly as old as all the realms.\" Oh gods, he's a whiner. The elf seemed as if he were trying to keep from stamping his foot in a tantrum, resorting to childish complaints. The fights these days, I swear. I've never been that much of a warrior, but honestly. The caliber of antagonist in day-to-day life seems to have sloped far downhill. Restlessly, I clattered the chains again. It was useless, just like the first twelve times. I wanted my magic so badly. \"But you have no power, oh ancient lord,\" he replied derisively. \"I have plenty of power.\" What I didn't have was magic, nor the ability to use it. Semantics tend to work in my favor--it's the only way that I've ever been lucky. And speaking of luck... Odin was late. I had been there for several hours, but he was just now banging on the door, attempting to break it in. A few of the excuses that he might attempt, or ones that were perhaps the truth, came to mind, but none of them made me particularly happy. One: They had gotten lost. Not likely. Two: The elves gave them trouble. More plausible. But it doubted that one even as it came to mind. Also, it didn't make me feel all that comfortable in his abilities (to lie, that is). Even with one eye, he could kill off a pack of Elven guards with ease... Three: They didn't start out as early as they had intended. (Read; as they told me they would.) Most likely excuse, least likely to be said to me. Four: They didn't start out as early as they had intended because they got drunk. Again. That one scared me, just slightly, and not because that would mean a group of drunken men were fighting for my life. All right, I know that none of them were fighting to save my life. But they were fighting for honor, so on my more self-satisfied days I could usually transfer over for my life. But this wasn't one of them and the thought they would gladly let me die, just for another, unnecessary, I might even add, reason to slaughter the Light elves was... unpleasant. There was another crash and I tried not to roll my eyes--they were rescuing me, after all. But honestly. The way the Aesir act sometimes is frankly barbaric. I can't say that I've been disappointed to be a Jotnar. At least I have some different blood in me than the lot of them... The elf boy stared at the door as it bulged beneath the gods' weight. They were probably attacking it with axes and swords and, if Thor were there, a hammer. (I doubted he was there. There was a probability that he disliked me enough even to avoid a battle if I were the intended prize at the end. Not that anyone would give me up as a prize if they were in their right mind, but that's Thor for you... I think all the electricity in the lighting has addled his brains over time.) A crack began to appear in the wood, but not at the seam where the two panels met--either the locks were heroically strong or the other Asgardians just thought that was too easy. Either way, they were almost in. There was a reason I tried to avoid paneling in my doorways, though, proven case and point. Those things were just too damn easy to smash through. The crack widened to show a quarter each of two mildly recognizable faces as well as several helmets and some weapon edges. Something I knew well peeked through the gap and I dove to the floor, just in time. (Like I said, no one in Asgard likes me very much.) An arrow streaked through the air just through where my head had been and skewered the second of my two most immediate captors in the forehead. I figured no one else would be coming to any more immediate form of aid, so I rolled to my side and wriggled back into a sitting position to work on freeing the chain from my floor and/or (preferably not the or of only the first option) my neck from the chain.People call me a trickster, but I'm hardly that without my magic. I have no tricks when I it. Elves and Asgardians fought around me as I struggled to loosen the chain. With magic it would have been a snap of the fingers to free me, before I stood, wiped the blood away with a wave of my hand, and a single step to return me to the palace halls. Now I was stuck in bloody clothes, entirely dependent on Odin and company, while I struggled to wedge my fingers through the chain links and free myself. There was a sword flash and I gasped throwing one arm up to protect my head, but it clanged as it smashed against and then sliced through the metal. I nodded to my savior, but he had already turned away to meet blows with the next elf, surprisingly a woman, her golden hair tied back in a multitude of snaking braids. I twisted and turned my wrists until they slid free of the chains. After much practice, to this day I'm still not entirely certain how I managed to pull it off. Regardless of how, they did come off, falling to the floor with a jingling clank. That left both hands free to scramble at the ones around my neck. I choked again as someone grabbed me from behind, lifting me dangerously to my feet by the throat. My fingers scrambled at my neck, but it was over as quickly as it had started. I gulped, trying not to gag on the blood that went down. The chain came off in a single tug from my rescuer. \"Hello, Odin. Long time no see, hm?\" \"Save it, Loki.\" \"I'm not the one who was two hours late to my rescue.\" \"You shouldn't have taken such a long time to be caught, then! It took far longer than predicted for them to regain their sense of security. You're much too tricky, Loki.\" \"Well, then. I do apologize for my very basest of natures, brother. I pray that you may someday forgive me.\" \"Shut up and keep out of my way.\" I'm not sure how he did it, but he saw an elf with a rather large blade coming towards him even from the side that had no eye. I flinched at the blood splatter and for once kept my tongue. \"Yes, sir.\" Standing against the wall had never looked neither so safe nor so appealing in my life. The chaos reminded me a bit of a party I had once dared to crash. The chaos that had ensued then had been a mite more appealing than what I witnessed then, but the results had not been the most pleasant. I hope that these would not end so bloody or painful for me. Although, I mused as I wiped up my face with a scrap of cloth I found on the floor, cleanly severed from the hem of another's cape, I already had a head start on the bloody portion of the matter.",

    "text": "Richard had been stabbed in the shower. It wasn't surprising, really, given that Richard was...Richard. He could be a sweet talker, but he'd never managed the effort that sweet-talking everyone would take, never seen the bother. He always ended up pissing off someone off. It didn't have to be a shiv in the shower, but it was going to be something. Nathan sat on the bed. He wasn't shaking. He had been, when he'd first started believing--not when he'd first seen, but when he'd touched the blood. It wasn't so much that it surprised Nathan that Richard could get himself killed, but this seemed so...ordinary. He'd assumed Richard would have some control over his death, if only to make it dramatic. But then, Richard had had the chance for his dramatic death. Hanged for murdering a child, and pulling an 'innocent' into it besides, a thrilling tale of corruption...he'd had his chance, and he'd picked prison. It wasn't surprising. It wasn't surprising that Richard was dead. If anything, it was surprising it had taken this long. If Nathan repeated that thought enough times, maybe he'd start believing it had happened. The door opened. Or it must have, since someone was standing there. Nathan had been enough out of it that is wasn't surprising he hadn't noticed. He turned his head to see who his new cellmate was going to be. \"Hello.\" Nathan blinked. This didn't look like anyone who would get himself locked up here. He didn't look entirely like he belonged outside of someone's dream, actually. Nathan couldn't place why. He just looked like he was about to walk through a wall or something. \"Will you be wanting him back?\" \"Wanting who?\" He stood up. \"Richard?\" \"Of course.\" The man spit. \"Tradition, isn't it? Or close enough.\" The way he said the last reminded Nathan of a few troublemakers he'd run into when he was younger--the branch who said things like, 'Well, the rules don't say...' Nathan stared a moment, then decided to go with it. There were worse places to end up, but he couldn't think of any at the moment. \"Yeah. Yes. I, yes. Of course.\" The man nodded, then walked off in a direction, walking further than the cell should have let him. Nathan followed. It didn't make sense in the strictest sense, but it was also perfectly sensible that this sort of person should have a way out of here. And Nathan should be able to follow him, of course, because as long as there existed a way, Nathan could walk it. He tried to remember the way, but found his mind wouldn't focus the right way. It was an uncomfortable sensation, so he gave up on it. \"My name's Nathan,\" he said, aware even before he said it that this was unnecessary. \"Yeah.\" The man shrugged his arms in a way that suggested he was used to holding something, wasn't entirely comfortable without it. \"Mine's Charon.\" \"Sharon? Oh,\" said Nathan, remembering. \"Charon. The ferryman.\" Charon nodded, not looking back. It seemed the proper way to travel through this tunnel, for whatever reason. Nathan wasn't the best at reading cues, but this one was clear enough, and seemed to pulse from every wall. Don't look behind you. You won't like what happens. They reached a river. \"Styx,\" Charon said. He climbed into the boat and picked up the oar immediately. \"Got to pay to cross, and no one crosses back unless the boss says so.\" \"I don't have any money.\" Charon looked him over. \"What's something you'd pay with, where you just came from?\" Nathan paused. He reached into his pocket and took out a pack of cigarettes. He tapped out a pair and offered them. Charon took both, then lit one and started smoking. \"That'll do nicely.\" They pushed off from shore. It was quiet. Nathan wasn't sure how that worked--Charon was the ferryman, note singular, and there must have been at least a few hundred who died in the time it took them to cross, and Charon seemed in no hurry to get back. Nathan decided not to question it. When he got there, Richard was having a conversation with a man on a throne, whom Nathan guessed was Hades. The woman on the other throne saw Nathan and smiled a little sadly. The sadness might have been directed at him, but she didn't look like it would be very easy to get a simple smile out of her. She looked...old. Older than the man next to her, in some ways. She had an air of acceptance, of seeing the world as it was, rather than as she would it were. She looked very odd next to Richard, in short. Nathan shook his head and broke eye contact with her. \"He will,\" Richard said, wrapped up in himself and his argument, unmoveable. \"No one does,\" Hades said, annoyed and trying to be dignified. \"Not without help. And he has no divine relatives, unless you feel the need to tell me something exceptionally interesting.\" Persephone said, softly, \"Would you let him try, if he did find a way?\" Perhaps something danced in her eyes, not mirth, but a contentedness at a story well told. Hades shared a look with her, then closed his eyes and breathed very deeply. He looked back at Richard, who looked ready to argue for a week. \"Yes. Fine. If he finds his way down here, he may try to lead you back up.\" Richard drew breath, as if about to gloat or ask for it in writing, neither of which struck Nathan as good ideas. \"That's nice of you,\" Nathan said. Persephone's mouth twitched, so little that Nathan would not have noticed had he not been looking for it. Richard turned, brightening. Still exhausted, still scared, but brighter. Not like after a good robbery, but like when they'd gotten life plus 99 years instead of death. \"Babe! What took you?\" he said, moving to put his hands on Nathan's shoulders. He cupped Nathan's face and kissed it, then moved away, but kept contact, held his hand. Nathan nearly heard him say, Don'tleavemedon'tleavemedon'tleaveme, clear as he'd heard it when Richard had kissed him in the precinct office. Hades' mouth was a firm line. He ground his teeth for a few moments longer, then said. \"Fine.\" Nathan was reminded of a teacher in his junior year of high school, who had caught him and Richard, but who knew punishing them and the other kids Richard had talked into it would be more trouble than it was worth. \"You.\" Hades jabbed a finger in Nathan's direction. \"Walk up the path, the way you came. If you look back before both of you reach the top, he\"--he jabbed the same finger in Richard's direction--\"comes back down here; you live without him.\" Hades gestured at them to leave as if swatting a fly. \"Go.\" Richard squeezed his hand one last time, and they set off. It was awfully...easy. Nathan supposed it was because he'd managed to be Eurydice, even though Richard had died first. Charon had led him down here, and Richard would lead him out. \"I'm right here, Babe. I knew you'd come.\" And he did, didn't he? Because didn't Nathan always come, whether Richard called or not, no matter how many times Richard stood him up. He'd always come. Certain as the turn of the seasons. \"No.\" Nathan jerked out of his reverie and looked next to him. \"What? Oh.\" He inclined his head toward Persephone, whom he had apparently ignored. \"I'm sorry, miss. I mean, your majesty. Or, um--\" She smiled and shook her head. \"You intended respect. That is all I mind.\" They walked a few more steps in silence, Richard having gone quiet when Persephone's slow, steady, and long footsteps had caught up to them. After a moment, Nathan asked, \"What did you mean, no?\" \"You are not nearly as certain a thing as the turn of the seasons. Trust me.\" \"...I suppose you know the seasons better than anyone else,\" he said, which was not a lie, because Nathan had made no comment on how well he thought Persephone knew him. \"And I know people. No one is as constant as that. One may be forced to it, but even those who are bound to fates have room to move.\" Nathan could see their cell at the top of the tunnel now, coming closer with each step. He wondered why Orpheus had found this so hard. Yes, he wanted to see Richard's face, but not so much that he would risk losing him for a glance. They reached the top, and Persephone put her hand on Nathan's arm. Richard made a sound, but Persephone spared a look back and Richard shut up. Impressive, Nathan thought, and he did not look back, but nor did he try to push past her. When she spoke, she spoke in a voice so gentle it could bring down mountains. \"You were never bound to him.\" She held his eyes for just a moment, then nodded and returned the way they'd just come. Nathan stared straight ahead, at the beds in the cell, at the bars, at the walls. He thought of Bobby Franks, and wondered whether this meant the boy would get to see his parents again, eventually. He wondered if the thought had occurred to Richard. \"Babe?\" Nathan stared at the wall for a moment longer, thinking of a child's eyes, then thinking of the oldest eyes he'd ever seen. He turned around. \"Don't call me that, Richard.\" Richard froze. Charon was there, quick as light, smoking the end of the cigarette. He nodded companionably to Nathan, then pulled Richard back down.

      "Richard had been stabbed in the shower.",

      "He could be a sweet talker, but he'd never managed the effort that sweet-talking everyone would take, never seen the bother.",
      "He always ended up pissing off someone off.",
      "It didn't have to be a shiv in the shower, but it was going to be something.",
      "Nathan sat on the bed.",
      "He wasn't shaking.",
      "He had been, when he'd first started believing--not when he'd first seen, but when he'd touched the blood.",
      "It wasn't so much that it surprised Nathan that Richard could get himself killed, but this seemed so...ordinary.",
      "He'd assumed Richard would have some control over his death, if only to make it dramatic.",
      "But then, Richard had had the chance for his dramatic death.",
      "Hanged for murdering a child, and pulling an 'innocent' into it besides, a thrilling tale of corruption...he'd had his chance, and he'd picked prison.",
      "It wasn't surprising.",
      "It wasn't surprising that Richard was dead.",
      "If anything, it was surprising it had taken this long.",

      "\"Hello.\"",
      "Nathan blinked.",
      "This didn't look like anyone who would get himself locked up here.",
      "He didn't look entirely like he belonged outside of someone's dream, actually.",
      "Nathan couldn't place why.",
      "He just looked like he was about to walk through a wall or something.",

      "\"Of course.\"",
      "The man spit.",
      "\"Tradition, isn't it?",
      "Or close enough.\"",
      "The way he said the last reminded Nathan of a few troublemakers he'd run into when he was younger--the branch who said things like, 'Well, the rules don't say...' Nathan stared a moment, then decided to go with it.",
      "There were worse places to end up, but he couldn't think of any at the moment.",
      "\"Yeah.",
      "Yes.",
      "I, yes.",
      "Of course.\"",
      "The man nodded, then walked off in a direction, walking further than the cell should have let him.",
      "Nathan followed.",
      "It didn't make sense in the strictest sense, but it was also perfectly sensible that this sort of person should have a way out of here.",
      "And Nathan should be able to follow him, of course, because as long as there existed a way, Nathan could walk it.",
      "He tried to remember the way, but found his mind wouldn't focus the right way.",
      "It was an uncomfortable sensation, so he gave up on it.",
      "\"My name's Nathan,\" he said, aware even before he said it that this was unnecessary.",
      "\"Yeah.\"",
      "The man shrugged his arms in a way that suggested he was used to holding something, wasn't entirely comfortable without it.",
      "\"Mine's Charon.\"",
      "\"Sharon?",
      "Oh,\" said Nathan, remembering.",
      "\"Charon.",
      "The ferryman.\"",
      "Charon nodded, not looking back.",
      "It seemed the proper way to travel through this tunnel, for whatever reason.",
      "Nathan wasn't the best at reading cues, but this one was clear enough, and seemed to pulse from every wall.",
      "Don't look behind you.",
      "You won't like what happens.",
      "They reached a river.",
      "\"Styx,\" Charon said.",
      "He climbed into the boat and picked up the oar immediately.",
      "\"Got to pay to cross, and no one crosses back unless the boss says so.\"",
      "\"I don't have any money.\"",
      "Charon looked him over.",
      "\"What's something you'd pay with, where you just came from?\" Nathan paused.",
      "He reached into his pocket and took out a pack of cigarettes.",
      "He tapped out a pair and offered them.",
      "Charon took both, then lit one and started smoking.",
      "\"That'll do nicely.\"",
      "They pushed off from shore.",
      "It was quiet.",
      "Nathan wasn't sure how that worked--Charon was the ferryman, note singular, and there must have been at least a few hundred who died in the time it took them to cross, and Charon seemed in no hurry to get back.",
      "Nathan decided not to question it.",
      "When he got there, Richard was having a conversation with a man on a throne, whom Nathan guessed was Hades.",
      "The woman on the other throne saw Nathan and smiled a little sadly.",
      "The sadness might have been directed at him, but she didn't look like it would be very easy to get a simple smile out of her.",
      "She looked...old.",
      "Older than the man next to her, in some ways.",
      "She had an air of acceptance, of seeing the world as it was, rather than as she would it were.",
      "She looked very odd next to Richard, in short.",
      "Nathan shook his head and broke eye contact with her.",
      "\"He will,\" Richard said, wrapped up in himself and his argument, unmoveable.",
      "\"No one does,\" Hades said, annoyed and trying to be dignified.",
      "\"Not without help.",
      "And he has no divine relatives, unless you feel the need to tell me something exceptionally interesting.\"",
      "Persephone said, softly, \"Would you let him try, if he did find a way?\"",
      "Perhaps something danced in her eyes, not mirth, but a contentedness at a story well told.",
      "Hades shared a look with her, then closed his eyes and breathed very deeply.",
      "He looked back at Richard, who looked ready to argue for a week.",
      "\"Yes. Fine.",
      "If he finds his way down here, he may try to lead you back up.\"",
      "Richard drew breath, as if about to gloat or ask for it in writing, neither of which struck Nathan as good ideas.",
      "\"That's nice of you,\" Nathan said.",
      "Persephone's mouth twitched, so little that Nathan would not have noticed had he not been looking for it.",
      "Richard turned, brightening.",
      "Still exhausted, still scared, but brighter.",
      "Not like after a good robbery, but like when they'd gotten life plus 99 years instead of death.",
      "\"Babe!",
      "What took you?\" he said, moving to put his hands on Nathan's shoulders.",
      "He cupped Nathan's face and kissed it, then moved away, but kept contact, held his hand.",
      "Nathan nearly heard him say, Don'tleavemedon'tleavemedon'tleaveme, clear as he'd heard it when Richard had kissed him in the precinct office.",
      "Hades' mouth was a firm line.",
      "He ground his teeth for a few moments longer, then said.",
      "\"Fine.\"",
      "Nathan was reminded of a teacher in his junior year of high school, who had caught him and Richard, but who knew punishing them and the other kids Richard had talked into it would be more trouble than it was worth.",
      "\"You.\"",
      "Hades jabbed a finger in Nathan's direction.",
      "\"Walk up the path, the way you came.",
      "If you look back before both of you reach the top, he\"--he jabbed the same finger in Richard's direction--\"comes back down here; you live without him.\"",
      "Hades gestured at them to leave as if swatting a fly.",
      "\"Go.\"",
      "Richard squeezed his hand one last time, and they set off.",
      "It was awfully...easy.",
      "Nathan supposed it was because he'd managed to be Eurydice, even though Richard had died first.",
      "Charon had led him down here, and Richard would lead him out.",
      "\"I'm right here, Babe.",
      "I knew you'd come.\"",
      "And he did, didn't he?",
      "Because didn't Nathan always come, whether Richard called or not, no matter how many times Richard stood him up.",
      "He'd always come.",
      "Certain as the turn of the seasons.",
      "\"No.\"",
      "Nathan jerked out of his reverie and looked next to him.",
      "\"What?",
      "Oh.\"",
      "He inclined his head toward Persephone, whom he had apparently ignored.",
      "\"I'm sorry, miss.",
      "I mean, your majesty.",
      "Or, um--\" She smiled and shook her head.",
      "\"You intended respect.",
      "That is all I mind.\"",
      "They walked a few more steps in silence, Richard having gone quiet when Persephone's slow, steady, and long footsteps had caught up to them.",
      "After a moment, Nathan asked, \"What did you mean, no?\"",
      "\"You are not nearly as certain a thing as the turn of the seasons.",
      "Trust me.\"",
      "\"...I suppose you know the seasons better than anyone else,\" he said, which was not a lie, because Nathan had made no comment on how well he thought Persephone knew him.",
      "\"And I know people.",
      "No one is as constant as that.",
      "One may be forced to it, but even those who are bound to fates have room to move.\"",
      "Nathan could see their cell at the top of the tunnel now, coming closer with each step.",
      "He wondered why Orpheus had found this so hard.",
      "Yes, he wanted to see Richard's face, but not so much that he would risk losing him for a glance.",
      "They reached the top, and Persephone put her hand on Nathan's arm.",
      "Richard made a sound, but Persephone spared a look back and Richard shut up.",
      "Impressive, Nathan thought, and he did not look back, but nor did he try to push past her.",
      "When she spoke, she spoke in a voice so gentle it could bring down mountains.",
      "\"You were never bound to him.\"",
      "She held his eyes for just a moment, then nodded and returned the way they'd just come.",
      "Nathan stared straight ahead, at the beds in the cell, at the bars, at the walls.",
      "He thought of Bobby Franks, and wondered whether this meant the boy would get to see his parents again, eventually.",
      "He wondered if the thought had occurred to Richard.",
      "\"Babe?\" Nathan stared at the wall for a moment longer, thinking of a child's eyes, then thinking of the oldest eyes he'd ever seen.",
      "He turned around.",
      "\"Don't call me that, Richard.\"",
      "Richard froze.",
      "Charon was there, quick as light, smoking the end of the cigarette.",
      "He nodded companionably to Nathan, then pulled Richard back down.",
      "Nathan watched.",
      "He didn't owe Richard that, but he owed himself.",
      "\"You were never worth it,\" Nathan said, not sure whether it was true, but certain it was the right thing to say."

    "text": "It was hard being a freshman and the younger cousin of the school quarterback, the golden godlike Achilles of the Athens-Clarke Achaeans. It wasn't supposed to be easy, being high school and all, but everyone expected him to be a certain way and as much as he tried, he wasn't. He hadn't finished his growth spurt yet, although he matched Axel egg for egg at breakfast, and he wasn't exactly fantastic at sports, although he did okay at track back in West Virginia, before his mom died and he had to move to Georgia. Axel tried, too, and what they got up to in the room they shared was none of anyone's business, but at school they didn't even share lunch. So, it was hard. He learned to respond when the teachers called him Axel and to ignore the whispers from the pretty girls who never spoke directly to him, and did his best as equipment manager for the football team. He didn't know whether they gave that to him because he missed tryouts, or because of Axel, but he didn't mind so much; he got to stick around after school when Axel did, so he never had to walk home alone, and in between lugging ball bags and filling the water cooler he got to learn the plays. But Axel made it easy to smile at the end, when the sun was going down and they were walking home; he'd sling an arm over his shoulders and pull him in so their shadows were linked in front of them. \"I'm glad you're here, Pat,\" he'd say, and that would be that. He knew people talked, but it wasn't a big deal; he was the new boy, and people always talked about the new boy, even when he wasn't exactly new anymore. People even talked about Axel, about Adam and Manny, but it was just talk. His mom always told him to ignore that kind of thing, so he kept his nose in his books and pretended that there was another Patrick out there. If he did well, he could follow Axel to any college in the country, and they could be anything they wanted. \"Don't let them get to you,\" Axel said, as they walked home one day. \"They don't know anything.\" But they do, Patrick wanted to say, they know the things we don't say. The pep rally before the biggest game of the season was the worst Patrick had ever been to. The rivalry between the Achaeans and the Ila High Trojans was beyond anything he'd experienced back home; someone threw a doll dressed in Trojan colours on the bonfire and it made the smoke smell acrid. His eyes were watering and his stomach was painfully flip-flopping like he'd eaten something bad. Adam and Manny were laughing, surrounded by the team and the cheerleaders, and it seemed like the night before a war; everyone was high on the idea that this year they were blessed, this year they would win, and Patrick wanted to be up there with them with the school screaming for him instead of at him, just to know what it would feel like. There was even a spot up there, right between Chrystal and Adam, where he would fit. \"Ready to go, Pat?\" Axel appeared from nowhere, like an apparition in the smoke, or something from a dream; the flames lit his hair from behind and made him look like an angel. There was nothing in the world, not even dreams of glory or acceptance, that would have made him stay; he let Axel take his arm in front of everyone and followed him into the dark. \"I'm not going,\" said Axel, when Patrick tried to wake him up for the game. They had a routine, clockwork to the point of superstition, and this was not it. It was cereal and bacon and eggs, bags by the door for when Axel's dad got out the shower and was ready to drop them at the school on his way to work. Axel not getting out of bed at sunrise to do sprints in the yard was not part of that at all. \"But Coach Noone said there would be a scout from Cal State,\" Patrick said, even though San Francisco was pretty much a done deal but for signatures and an under-the-table signing bonus. \"Is it about Brynna? Are you sick?\" \"I'm not playing,\" said Axel again, and he pulled the covers up over his face. Patrick couldn't even tickle him, let alone try anything else, and he figured it would pass. Axel could be stubborn, but he loved to play. But Axel didn't come down to breakfast; Patrick left a plate in the microwave and let Axel's dad drive him to the school without even a word. \"He'll come round,\" he said before he drove off, but Patrick wasn't sure. The locker room seemed bigger without Axel there, though just as loud and dirty. Patrick got out the helmets and changed the studs on cleats but nobody asked him where Axel was; it was like they didn't even notice. They didn't notice at all when Patrick slipped into his cousin's pads and jersey, and into the huddle with paint on his face and helmet in his hand. \"Will your baby cuz suck you off when we win, oh fleet-footed Achilles?\" Adam said, smacking him on the back and ducking off to laugh with Manny. Patrick blushed under the paint, but he said nothing; Axel would have said nothing, and his mom always told him to ignore that kind of talk. \"Let them choose whether to receive, we want the north end,\" Coach Noone said; Patrick ran out to the toss as if he was in a dream, and the roar of the crowd deafened him to anything else. Axel must feel like this all the time, he thought, and then I can't let him down. He couldn't let them think their words hurt Axel at all, not golden boy untouchable Axel who carried the team on his back, and he couldn't let the team suffer for it. But still, this was big, and the Trojans were even bigger. Coach Noone was yelling at him and he could see Acton by the water table, Brynna and Chrystal in their sun-coloured dresses, but he could only hear the sound of blood rushing in his ears, like adrenaline taking over everything to leave him only with instinct. \"Myrmidon Sixteen,\" he called, reading the signal from Coach Noone the way he'd seen Axel do, and he caught the ball; he stepped back and threw it towards someone in gold, running, and then he felt something across his neck and in his chest, and his head hit the ground before his body did. He woke up in a room that was white, and he couldn't feel anything at all. \"Tell him I died,\" he said, because Axel would be outside, and he didn't want to be seen like this. \"Tell him,\" he said, and he died.",

    "text": "The Furies' Bar and Grill is not the most reputable place. It smells consistently of smoke and spilled alcohol and is managed by a hateful old woman named Magaera, who hates literally everyone that isn't her two sisters. But The Furies' Bar was the only place that would hire an eighteen year old girl with no work experience, and even that was only because Hyacinthus put in a good word for her. It doesn't matter how she got the job, however, as long as she has one and it pays. Artemis had been starting to feel like a bum, just lying around on the couch in Hyacinthus's apartment, not contributing at all aside from making dinner and breakfast for her brother and his boyfriend. Granted, Apollo doesn't do much either, but at least he brings in some money with the band. It was a good thing Artemis and Apollo were both receiving scholarships to college, because otherwise they'd be SOL, as Hera made sure to cut off all funds to them after making it clear that as long as Apollo was dating Hyacinthus and Artemis was supporting him they were not welcome back in the house. Hyacinthus welcomed them into his crappy little apartment with open arms, however. They moved in quickly, returning once during the day when Zeus and Hera were both out of the house in order to collect their things. Thankfully Hera had chosen a good time to kick them out; summer gave them time to establish themselves in the apartment and get everything needed for freshmen year at the local college. Artemis tugs her tight black tank top down, somewhat annoyed by the bright yellow lettering that states, \"You'll have a hell of a time!\" surrounded by three devil pin up girls posed suggestively. But whatever, it's a paying job so she can't really complain about anything. It was somewhat slow that night as there were no big sports games on. Artemis doesn't see anything that she direly needs to attend to at any of her tables, so she makes her way to the bar under the guise of fetching a beer for the guy at table fifteen, hoping for someone to talk to. Ganymede has several people at the bar however, so she peeps into the kitchen, looking for Odysseus. He and the cook Polyphemus are arguing over something, Polyphemus's finger jabbing Odysseus in his chest, right above his Finding Nemo name tag. Artemis briefly debates going over and breaking it up before Odysseus throws a punch and winds up hitting Polyphemus's good eye again, but the other cooks beat her to it. Odysseus shoots her a wink and makes his way out of the room, meeting her at the entrance. \"That was a bit of an overreaction on his part,\" he says with a lopsided grin, adjusting his shirt collar where it had become wrinkled. \"What did you even do?\" Artemis asks, grabbing a beer and replacing table fifteen's empty bottle with it, returning to the bar to chat with Odysseus and Ganymede. The flow of customers has slowed enough to allow Ganymede time to talk. There are only two customers at the bar, a man and a woman that appear to be attached at the lips. Artemis shoots them a somewhat disgusted look and rolls her eyes. Ganymede huffs and leans on the bar, saying, \"I swear to God, if they don't stop making out, I will spray them all over with Budweiser.\" Odysseus lets out a sharp, barking laugh, shifting on his barstool in an attempt to get more comfortable. Magaera would probably go into convulsions if she saw them relaxing on the job, but she's out of town so they pretty much have free rein, as Odysseus is the manager. \"Hey, Ganymede, do you know those two over there? The guy and the girl at table three. I think they're arguing over something,\" Artemis asks. Ganymede narrows his eyes, focusing on the couple. They are very well dressed to go to a bar, the girl in a tight red dress and the man in a black suit. As they all three watch, the man stands and tosses his drink in the girl's lap. Artemis gasps and hops off the barstool, brushing off Odysseus's hand on her arm and ignoring Ganymede saying, \"Artemis, this isn't a good idea.\" Shoving her way past a group of frat boys, Artemis calls after the man, who is making his way to the door, yelling, \"Hey! Douchebag! You wanna come over here and pay for that drink?\" The man stops and whirls around; Artemis almost crashes into him she was walking so quickly. \"What the fuck did you just say about me?\" the man says in an angry almost shout, advancing into her personal space. Artemis stands her ground, shifting slightly into a fighting position. \"I said,\" she hisses, stressing the last syllable, \"that you need to get back and pay for that drink that you spilled all over that lady.\" The man grins, a cruel gesture that brings to mind nature documentaries with chimps grinning in order to intimidate, \"And what if I don't want to?\" Artemis honestly can not think of a good comeback to that, and does what she does in uncomfortable situations. Her fight or flight reflex kicks in, and she punches the man in the nose as hard as she can. Bellowing, he lunges for her, but she darts to the side and stomps hard on his instep, following it with a kick to his crotch. The man drops to the ground, gagging slightly as he struggles to regain his composure. Having a sudden moment of realization at what she had just done and the fact that she probably just lost her job, Artemis spins on her heel and walks briskly to the door. It is very, very cold outside, especially in a tank top and jeans. Artemis rubs up and down her arms, cursing her stupid damn brother and his stupid damn band gig and his stupid damn boyfriend for being at the stupid damn band gig and leaving her with no ride home. The bell above the door jingles and she turns, expecting Odysseus. It's the girl that had had the drink poured on her, her red dress colored a dark maroon by the alcohol. She smells strongly of whiskey, but was still beautiful under the light. She walks up beside Artemis where we is sitting on the curb and drapes a woolen black peacoat over her arms. Artemis accepts it gratefully and wraps it around her more securely. \"What you did in there, thanks,\" the girl says, pulling her curly black hair into a ponytail. Artemis shakes her hair out of her face and smiles. \"It was no problem. I did what needed to be done. Was that your boyfriend?\" she asks, studying the girl's face. She has warm, olive brown skin and brown eyes, with a few freckles under them. \"Uh, yeah, he is- well, was now, my fiance,\" the girl says, glancing back to the bar. \"I'm Hecate, by the way. College student and future major in Women's Studies and Occult Studies,\" Hecate grins, offering a hand to Artemis. \"I'm Artemis. Lonely college student and future veterinary technician,\" Artemis shakes her hand, marveling for a few seconds over how soft it is before mentally shaking herself, remembering all the straight girls she had had her heart broken by over the years. \"Do you have a ride home? I would hate for my knight in shining armor to be stranded out here,\" Hecate smiles helpfully, adding, \"I drove my car here tonight, so I could take you home if you want.\" \"Uh, if you don't mind, then that'd be great. I live in the apartments on the corner of Laurens and Hamilton.\" Hecate stands, offering a hand to Artemis, who accepts it and follows her to her car. \"Great! If you don't mind, I'm going to stop by my- well technically his, apartment so I can grab some stuff. Well, as much stuff as I can grab tonight. I hope he's too drunk to throw any of it away,\" Hecate distractedly digs through her bag for her keys, which she then unlocks the door with and slides into the driver's seat. \"Hey, do you need somewhere to stay? My brother and his boyfriend won't be home until later, and our couch is free. You could also shower if you wanted to get that whiskey off of you,\" Artemis says from her position in the passenger seat, shifting her weight somewhat uncomfortably. \"Really? Thanks, that'll save me a lot of money because otherwise I'd have to rent a hotel room.\" The other girl turns around in her seat as she backs out of the parking lot, her bracelets reflecting the yellow glow of the streetlights. They ride in silence for a short while before stopping in front of a nice apartment building. \"Do you mind to help me? I just need to grab some stuff and throw it into some bags before he gets home,\" Hecate says as she hops out of the car, Artemis following. They make it up the steps and Hecate unlocks the door, jingling the keys triumphantly. \"The bastard better regret giving me a set of keys,\" she smirks triumphantly as she swings open the door. A small black cat greets them with a chirp, nuzzling Hecate's legs. \"Hello, Jinx,\" she says with a smile, picking up the cat and setting it on her shoulder, where it seems content to perch as she pushes through the cluttered apartment to a bedroom. \"Just grab anything that looks feminine,\" Hecate says to Artemis, \"My clothes are in the top drawer, I'll be in the bathroom grabbing my things.\" Artemis scoops up the clothes in the front drawer and shoves them into a dark grey backpack that Hecate had offered her. Hecate emerges from the bathroom with a small bag of toiletries and makeup, which she places in the backpack as well. \"Okay, I think that's all I need for tonight. I can come back for everything else later,\" she says, pushing back strands of her hair and setting down Jinx, who looks at her balefully and stalks off. Hecate smiles at Artemis softly; the smile drops as a light shines through the blinds and they hear a loud, drunken shout. \"Shit, I wasn't expecting him to be here so soon,\" Hecate hisses, grabbing the backpack and slinging it over her shoulders. Artemis hears huge, lumbering steps coming from the steps outside; and soon after, the clanking of the key in the lock. Hecate is wide eyed in fear, looking at the door for a few moments before shaking out of it and running to the window and throwing it open. She climbs out of it and hisses, \"Use the fire escape, he'll kill us if he catches us here.\" Artemis hops out of the window behind her, running down the stairs and practically flying to the car and jumping into the passenger seat. Hecate speeds out of the driveway and didn't slow down until she gets on the main road. \"Feel my hand dude, it's shaking like crazy,\" she says, extending her right hand to Artemis, who takes it and puts it between her own. \"That was insane. Can we not do that again?\" she says with a smile, looking up through her eyelashes at Hecate. Hecate grins wildly, retrieving her hand and running it through her now wild black hair. Noticing Artemis's somewhat put out expression, Hecate returns her hand tentatively to its former position on top of Artemis's own on her lap. Artemis flushes slightly, but doesn't protest. They arrive at her apartment relatively soon, where Artemis unlocks the door with somewhat shaky hands and led Hecate inside. She starts to say something about the couch or the shower or something when Hecate's mouth was on hers and her hands were on her face. Hecate backs off quickly, saying, \"Shit shit shit I'm so sorry I didn't mean to screw this up I'll just go now,\" when Artemis grabs her shoulders and pulls her closer, kissing her deeply. \"No, no. Don't apologize. It was nice. You're nice,\" Artemis smiles at Hecate and brushes a few stray pieces of hair from her face. \"Can, uh, we do more of that? Maybe not tonight but like later?\" Hecate asks, shifting her weight and hearing the wooden flooring creak. \"Uh yeah, sure. If you still want to tomorrow, I mean,\" the other girl brushes her bangs back from her forehead and sighs, \"right now I'm just really fucking tired, so I kinda want to go to bed, if that's okay. You can join me, if you want.\" Hecate's eyes light up and she grabs the bag from where she had dropped it. Slinging it over her shoulders, she says, \"Lead the way,\" and strikes a pose that is vaguely reminiscent of Road to El Dorado. Artemis grins fondly and leads her to her bedroom; a rather small room that is primarily occupied by a queen sized bed and numerous posters. \"I have some pajamas in here that you can borrow, they'll be too long on you, but that doesn't really matter,\" Artemis says as she digs through her cluttered drawers and yanks out a pair of plaid pants that have seen better days. She then moves to the closet and pulls down a black tee shirt and tosses both to Hecate. \"The bathroom is just down the hall, you can change and shower there.\" Hecate balls the clothes up and says, \"Thanks again, Artemis, for this.\" \"No problem dude, we girls gotta stick together,\" is Artemis's reply as she turns around and begins undressing, pulling off her tank top and uncomfortably skinny jeans in order to pull on an oversized band tee and sweat pants. Hecate hurriedly excuses herself to the bathroom. Fifteen minutes and one shower later, she walks into Artemis's room, where the other girl is curled up under two comforters on the side of the bed closest to the wall. Hecate crawls onto the bed and under the covers, huffing a laugh when Artemis sleepily moves towards her, draping an arm over her waist and tangling their legs. \"Who knew you'd be a cuddler?\" she says with a smile, running a hand through Artemis's thick black hair. Artemis mumbles something inaudible in reply followed by a more audible, \"Go to sleep.\" Hecate decides to do just that.",

    "text": "Warnings: the shadowfox is a creepy dude. Shades of implied non-con. You can taste it, can't you? the fox whispers, teeth glinting in the moonlight, drool trailing down the shell of Stiles' ear. \"This is a dream,\" Stiles mumbles into the dirt, rotting leaves and mud in his mouth. \"A dream, just a dream, wake up, wake up!\" The fox laughs, chest against Stiles' back. Are you? No, no, you're not, boy of mine. We're together forever now, and their blood - their blood on our hands. Their blood on our teeth! The fox snaps his fangs, breath gusting against the side of Stiles' head. \"No,\" Stiles mutters. \"No, no, no!\" Oh, yes, the fox laughs. We're awake, Stiles. Can't you feel me inside you? We, us - together, together! And suddenly, the fox is gone. Nothing on his back but the tattered remains of his shirt. He's awake. No, he can't be awake. He can't be awake, sprawled on the ground beside the nemeton, tears in his eyes, blood on his hands. It's a dream. It's a nightmare. (Whose is the face in the mask? Whose is the blood staining the skin? Wake up, Stiles - wake up!) The fox laughs but Stiles doesn't react, doesn't move. He'll wake up. He will. Warnings: mentions of multiple canon character deaths. AU. Flames flicker in his memory even though the fire was only smoldering when he got there. He remembers screaming, men holding him back - and he let them. He had felt his pack die. They were dead when he got there. He sat in silence until the sheriff (an old man whose name he still can't remember) escorted Laura in. Laura, halfway through her first semester at Stanford and newly an alpha. Neither of them spoke as they wrapped around each other, Laura in sweats and Derek still swaddled by a shock blanket given by a kind deputy who smelled like loss of his own. \"Derek, Derek,\" Laura crooned into his hair. \"I've got you, Derek.\" Derek didn't make a sound then; while flames flicker in his memory, he still doesn't. He hasn't spoken since that day, or whimpered, or cried. Laura is dead, torn in two by the werewolf that killed her, trying to frame hunters. (If it had been hunters, Derek would be an alpha now.) There's a baby beta running around cluelessly, Argents in town, and an alpha without a trace. Derek stands in front of his old house and sees fire licking up it, reaching for the sky. His pack is dead. Derek's omega now because he'll never follow or trust the werewolf who killed Laura. And he might be able to kill the alpha (he has the will, but not the strength - Laura was always the fighter, and Cora) but it's more likely he'll be killed by overeager hunters who preach about their precious code while pissing all over it. No. There's nothing in Beacon Hills but ghosts and the stench of fire. So Derek climbs back into his sister's car and drives and drives and drives until California is in his rearview. He doesn't talk, and he tries not to think, and it's not really living - but it's what he has. It's what he has and it'll do until he decides to do better. (In Beacon Hills, the Argents kill Peter Hale and Sheriff Stilinski follows an anonymous tip - three guns in Kate Argent's possession solve half a dozen cold cases. He also catches Chris Argent holding a loaded gun on Scott McCall. All the way across the country, Derek Hale wakes up with red eyes - then he rolls over and goes back to sleep. In Beacon Hills, Allison Argent breaks up with Scott, her aunt Kate is extradited to Oregon (four states are fighting over her), and Gerard Argent shows up to throw his weight around. (Another anonymous tip provides cause for the police to search Gerard Argent's possessions, and he owns a sword - custom made, so pretty damned unique - that solves another dozen cold cases. Eight states fight over him but Utah wins. Because of the seriousness of his family's crimes, Chris Argent is sentenced to the fullest extent possible while Victoria leaves Beacon Hills with her daughter. Sheriff Stilinski goes home and pokes his head into his son's room. \"Not with Scott tonight?\" he asks with a small bit of concern. The boys have been cold to each other lately. He's pretty sure it's because the Argent girl blames Stiles for all the arrests, and Scott does, too, in his pining way, sure that Stiles is the reason Allison left. Stiles shrugs without glancing up from the battered old book he's pretending to read. \"You know - what is that, Latin? - Latin now, kid?\" he asks dubiously, though it really wouldn't surprise him. Stiles shrugs again. Sheriff Stilinski sighs. \"Don't stay up too late. You have school tomorrow.\" As he turns to head to his room for a hot shower, he pauses to say, \"Thanks for the tips, son. I hope you'll be able to tell me one day how you knew.\" Stiles still doesn't talk, but Sheriff Stilinski didn't expect he would.) Warnings: canon character death; grief Stiles is pretty sure there's never been a day he wasn't afraid of something. As a kid, it was the monster in the corner (not the closet 'cause that was his secret fortress, and not under the bed 'cause that was his tunnel to the center of the earth; no, his monsters always lived in the shadowy corners where no light went) and then his constant, ever-present fear that he'd do something to make his mom worse. Mom began getting confused and forgetting things when Stiles was still Allie, her little Allandros. He can't remember her any other way. But it got really bad not long after his seventh birthday, and Daddy put her in the hospital just before Allie turned eight. Mama couldn't be trusted to take care of herself or Allie anymore, and some days she didn't even know Allie was her son. Some days, she thought she was dreaming and would hurt herself to wake up. (Stiles had a panic attack during Inception and Dad stayed with him for the rest of the night.) After Mama died, Allie became Stiles and constantly feared his dad would die or forget him or go away and never come back. So Stiles spent every second he could with his dad, going straight from school to the station. The Hale fire happened half a year after Mama died. Dad was called into work and Stiles spent the next two days with Miss Hallie from across the street, absolutely sure he'd never see Dad again. That's when he had his first panic attack. Fear has been Stiles' constant companion. He can't remember when he wasn't afraid. Fear was faceless, nameless, the shadow in the corner. And then it had a face (snarling, red eyed) and a name (alpha, Peter) and it was physical - it had a body he lit on fire. And then the kanima and Gerard, and then the alphas and the darach. Fear never left but he could fight it. He fought it and he won. He won. But the shadow's in him now. The shadow is him. It's his body and his mind, and there's nothing to fight, no way to win. Lying still for the MRI is the scaredest he's ever felt in his life. He's been losing time, never knows if he's awake, forgets things. He's deadweight and useless. The monster in the corner is in his mind and asking him riddles like it's Gollum and he's Bilbo, but Bilbo knew all the answers and Stiles has nothing in his pocket. The shadow has his face, and it smiles and smiles, mouth opening wide to swallow him whole. Warnings: crossover with multiple mythologies; canon character death Note: I wrote this the day after Insatiable aired. Allison gasped as her eyes opened to a bright blue sky. Her hands went to her belly and found nothing - no wound, no blood, no cloth. \"Scott?\" she called, sitting up. \"Dad? Lydia?\" No one was in sight, she was completely naked, without her bow or a knife, and she didn't recognize anything she could see. She scanned the ground for anything suitable as a weapon, but there was only grass. Comfortable enough to sit or lie on, but useless without more tools. There were trees, though, a little ways off, so she got to her feet. Nothing hurt, not an even an ache. \"Dad!\" she shouted. \"Scott! Lydia!\" She waited, silent and still. Then she shouted again, \"Dad! Isaac! Scott! Lydia, Stiles! DAD!\" She waited for a few more minutes and when no answer came, set off for the trees at a light jog. She kept her gaze between her surroundings and obstacles on the ground, her hearing focused, and her mind clear. (Thoughts of \"The Most Dangerous Game\" and The Hunger Games kept trying to intrude, but she refused to let them.) The first step was to find water, then fashion a weapon, and find food. Except - she noticed that she wasn't hungry. Or thirsty. She hadn't eaten anything but a granola bar while she made her arrowheads, and then grabbed an apple on the way to Oak Creek. She should be famished. And while some water might be nice, it didn't feel like she needed it. \"Am I awake?\" she asked the empty air, glancing up at the trees. \"Dad!\" she shouted again out of shear frustration. If this was someone's idea of a sick game - \"Peace, daughter,\" a soft voice said. She spun to face the speaker as the woman continued, \"and welcome.\" The woman was tall, taller than Isaac, with dark hair, tan skin, and silver eyes. (Allison blinked, looked again, and decided to accept it because the woman's eyes were still silver.) She wore a tan tunic that fell to her mid-thigh with a knife belt across her waist, a quiver on her back, and a bow in her hand. A silent pack of hounds, half a dozen kinds, ranged around her, though none came in reach of Allison. \"Who are you?\" Allison demanded, standing to her full height. \"Where am I?\" The woman smiled. \"This is where decisions are made, huntress,\" she said. She gestured with the bow. \"Through those trees is eternal peace, sunlight, and music. You'll never want, never hunger, never tire, never miss anything again. With me, there is hunting, always a battle - one day, a war.\" She shrugged elegantly. \"We do have days of rest, luxurious baths, laughter. You'll not be alone.\" Allison listened to her own breath for a moment. The woman just waited, her free hand stroking the ears of the giant wolfhound sitting placidly at her side. \"Will I see my family again?\" she asked. \"Or my friends?\" \"Your mother is with me,\" the woman answered. \"Your father will be offered the same choice. One of my sisters will meet your banshee on her day, and the trickster's son will greet your wolves. As to the shadow-touched...\" the woman shrugged again. \"The trickster himself may come for that one. And I'm not as familiar with the fox's pantheon; they do so like to keep apart, however small the world grows.\" Allison wasn't sure what to say, so she just stared at the dogs. Finally, the woman told her, \"You have until dawn.\" The dogs took off, back into the field. \"Allison Argent,\" the woman said as she turned to go, pausing to meet Allison's eyes. \"I promise you, there is no wrong choice. You deserve your rest; you deserve peace. But I think that you'd tired of it, one day.\" Allison lifted her chin. \"And if I choose the hunt? What will we be hunting?\" The woman laughed, as clear as a bell and just as loud. \"Nothing we hunt has not earned it. Your conscience would always be eased.\" She smiled once more. \"Be sure in your choice, daughter. At first light, it must be made.\" She whistled, high and sharp, as she strode from the trees. Allison watched her go. After a moment, she moved a little further into the woods, searching for somewhere just a little comfortable to bed down. She had to think, had so many pros and cons to weigh, so much to consider. She didn't plan to fall asleep, but she woke with a fluffy dog curled up beside her. She laughed, patting the dog's shoulder. \"I guess you know my decision, then.\" She rolled to her feet, watching the dog. \"Can you take me to Artemis?\" The dog bounded off through the trees. Allison followed, feeling awake and young and alive. Warnings: mentions of canon character death; mind games; ambiguous ending He dreams in shades of blue, in the after. He remembers it from his mother's death; all the shades, he's seen before. At first, he's glad because if he's seeing blue, he knows it's a dream. And he can sleep again because of that. At first, it's a relief. But then he hears the laughter, and his waking world has a blue tint. And then, and then -- \"Are you so sure, little fox, that you ever woke?\" His eyes open to Scott's panicked face, to his dad, and he knows he's awake. He knows it. Because if he's not - he grips Scott tightly enough to hurt, and he's awake, he is, he has to be. The fox laughs, but he ignores it because he's awake. Warnings: mentions of child death; bad decisions due to grief; a history of family dying young; AU during Insatiable; possibly AUish for Supernatural (I really have no idea); also, when it comes to the shadowfox, I reject canon's reality and substitute my own. Still - unreliable narrator. Claudia Stilinski could've been somebody extraordinary, someone remembered by more people than her childhood friends, her husband, and her son. She could've gone anywhere and done anything, could've left her mark on the world. Instead, she chose to take a break from being a journalist when she got too pregnant to move around easily, and she took longer than her maternity leave to stay with her son. She could've been famous the world over, a household name, in any field she chose. Her mother made a deal to insure she lived and prospered - Claudia Abigail May had been stillborn. Anaka wanted her daughter to flourish and be happy, and her gift took her life when Claudia was barely ten years old. Her father, Oniofrio, remarried soon after, to a woman Claudia did eventually come to love. She grew up driven and passionate, determined to prove to herself and the world that she was worth the price of her life. She forgot, as had her mother, that there is always a punchline to the trick. Anaka had a decade with the girl who should not have been. Claudia didn't even get that. Her last month was spent half in her head as she tried to warn her little boy - and she told him, clutching him close and waiting for Alex, trying to hold on just long enough, she told her little Frio, \"Remember tricksters always have something hidden, don't ever trust what you see, and never tell them your true name, your mother-given name, promise me, baby, remember, I love you so much.\" She cried, pulling him as close as she could. \"Remember, be as clever as a fox,\" she mumbled, feeling the last of her strength fade away. \"Mama?\" her son asked, leaning back to look at her. \"Mama, wait!\" His eyes were so wide, his face so pale, and she tried to smile - Oniofrio Aleksander Stilinski died with his mother. He remembered with perfect clarity every single word his mother had said and so he stopped using the name his mother had given him. He even stopped thinking it. And he learned everything he could so that nothing would be hidden from him. Claudia Abigail May was stillborn, the only child of Oniofrio and Anaka May. She married Alex Stilinski on the coldest day of her twenty-fourth year and gave birth to her son, Oniofrio Aleksander Stilinski, ten months later. She died three weeks before her son's eighth birthday. When he sacrifices himself for his father, a door in Stiles' mind opens just a crack. Nothing would've slipped through (nothing could've slipped through) if he hadn't taken the first step while his own subconscious told him to leave it alone. But Stiles went through the door and left it open behind him. A crafty old fox was presented with the choice of a hunter, a wolf, or a boy who should never have been. What else could any self-respecting trickster do? Chaos, strife, pain - these are trickster tools and trickster weapons. And everyone is so busy with those Winchester boys, with Heaven and Hell and Purgatory... a little nothing town with a mostly-dead nemeton goes unnoticed. But there's always a punchline to the trick. And when the fox has Stiles' friends and family battle the oni, he senses the newcomer a moment too late. \"Be a dear, little fox,\" the King of Hell says, \"and get out of my investment, yeah?\" \"Your investment?\" the fox demands while fucking Crowley dissipates the oni with a dismissive wave of his hand. \"I made the deal with his grandmother,\" Crowley says. \"I collected both her and her daughter's souls.\" He spreads his hands and grins. \"That boy is mine, bought and paid for, so be quick about it and leave. I've places to be and things to do.\" The boy is stone silent and still in the back of his own mind but the fox can feel the burn of their shared fury rising. Outside, a multitude of voices start shouting - most everyone the boy cares about is present. He wants to use you up and spit you out, the fox says. And you don't? the demands, hard and cold at his core. This is why you chose me, isn't it? What he said about, about Mama and her mom? Yes, the fox admits. There's a fire in you, Stiles. A spark. It wouldn't have been half as much fun in the hunter or the wolf. \"Tick tock, fox,\" Crowley calls, throwing one of the wolves into the wall. \"Get out of the boy or I'll tear you out.\" A huff and a puff, the boy laughs nervously. He made the deal with Anaka May decades ago, the fox says. I'll make a deal with you today. One of the wolves roars; everyone is shouting. Stiles is still and silent, body crouched down, eyes closed, at the center of the storm. There's always a punchline to the trick, the fox says. He'll burn you and carve you out, use you till there's nothing left but grief and fear. But me - I like you, Stiles. I like you like you're a part of me, and I'm offering you a trade. What? the boy asks. Howling and shouting, brimstone and flame, and no one notices when the eyes blink open, when the lips turn upwards in a smirk. The fox says, A name for a name. And then? the boy asks softly. Chaos and strife and pain? The fox hesitates, using the boy's eyes to watch the fight. Your father, Stiles, he murmurs, your wolves. Your banshee and your hunter - you think the King of Hell, Lord of the Crossroads cares anything for them? His game is a bit more bloody than mine. I'll leave them all alive. The boy watches his father fall, watches Scott try to catch him, watches Crowley laugh and glare; it's obvious the demon is playing with them. He's cold, the boy, so cold, so deep inside. My mother-given name, he says, for yours. What happens then? The fox laughs. There's fire in you, boy who shouldn't be. I'll light the spark. Okay, the boy says. Let's do it. The world is so quiet, in the center of a soul, when two names are whispered in tandem, and two spirits become one. Outside, the King of Hell shouts, \"What?\" whirling to watch the boy's body rise. \"Fox!\" Crowley snarls. \"I've prior claim - that soul is mine, that destiny is MINE to write as I will!\" The sheriff isn't moving, Scott crouched in front of him, teeth bared at Crowley, while Allison checks him over. Argent and Derek pace on Crowley's other side, and only Crowley is looking at the boy. \"The son of a woman who should never have grown to have a child,\" the boy's body says. \"What tricks could such a man play once grown himself?\" He laughs, eyes never leaving Crowley. \"Your investment is null, little dealmaker, all agreements rendered invalid.\" Crowley shakes his head, sputtering, \"You have no authority! I am - \" \"King of Hell, yes, we know,\" the boy says, rolling his eyes. \"And we don't care. Don't you have important duties you should be attending to, Your Low Unholiness?\" He laughs again. \"We're just a little bit of chaos, a touch of strife, a slice of pain.\" He smiles and his teeth are too sharp, too bright. \"This city is our territory and we'll burn anything that dares intrude.\" \"Stiles?\" Scott whispers. No one answers. Crowley huffs but vanishes as suddenly as he'd appeared. The boy (the fox) laughs, clapping his hands together. \"Well now,\" he says, \"time for some fun.\" Warnings: major (non-canonical) character death; grief Purple is the color of royalty, he thinks inanely, face against his son's shoulder. He buried his wife in purple. Bruises turn purple. Flames can be purple. Claudia had loved it - she wore lavender at their wedding, painted their bedroom walls it. Their son's baby blanket was deep purple. He sobs into his son's shoulder, ignoring the roars and shouts around him. He's going to bury their son in purple, and forever after, he'll taste bile any time he sees it.",

Here is a hole, there a gap; it is not done while there is a gap. The wall must be built up, twenty courses without a flaw, before the work will be done. There was life, there was a future; it was never done while they were together. The life they built together, twenty years without a flaw, nowhere close to done. Turning and fumbling, fitting brick to brick, block to block. His hammer rings like a bell as it taps the bricks down. Three courses done and they shatter like a pot in a kiln. The sudden thunder. Her fear, her courage; the ring like a bell as his hammer strikes the hand that reaches for her and shatters like a pot in a kiln. The wall is gone, the bricks remain; the blocks remain. She is gone, he remains; the god's anger remains. Brick after brick, block after block, Tetris labours without end to quell the limitless rage of a thwarted god.",

    "text": "\"Four...\" Hecate counts, voice ever a low gentle hum, and currently just out of reach of the dark lord's ears. But not Persephone's. The goddess of spring and queen of the Underworld spares a glance over her shoulder. \"Hmm?\" Hecate clicks her tongue, gently guiding Persephone's head back into position. \"Don't move, please. Braiding.\" She admonishes, lithe fingers expertly working Persephone's honey curls into a dainty chignon. A few moments later, and Hecate snorts out a soft laugh. \"Five...\" Persephone purses her lips, confusion tugging at her ageless features as she inquires, \"What is it that you're counting? It certainly couldn't be the strands of hair on my head!\" \"I'm surprised you haven't taken notice, my lady.\" Hecate chuckles and without releasing the braid within her grasp, she turned Persephone's head gently into her line of vision. \"Lord Hades is moping again. He has paced past us about five times now.\" At the mere mention of her elusive husband's name, Persephone's heart skipped a beat. Swallowing the sudden nerves that threatened to burst forth, she cast her gaze upon him across the way. She had taken notice of him when he had emerged from the palace and into the gardens, she and Hecate nearly bursting into laughter at his surprise of finding them there. She could still see his expression in her face now, how he had seemed to be debating internally with himself as to whether or not he should race back inside or simply go about his business. He had chosen something in between, considering the fact that he had wandered the gardens with an invisible storm cloud over his head, seeming to have no purpose or reasoning for being there, and yet no reason to pull him away. Busy as he should be, he had seemed content to pace, and Persephone would have been lying had she said she hadn't noticed, despite her best efforts. Even now, she can't help but follow him, catching a glimpse of his silvery eyes as he looks briefly in her direction before looking away. \"Moping?\" She scoffs slightly. \"W-why would he do that?\" Hecate turns Persephone's head back into position, continuing her work. \"Sweet girl, why do you think?\" She croons. \"He's moping over you, of course.\" Persephone feels her face break out into a flush, and she can't help but chew her lower lip nervously. \"There's no reason for him to...erm...mope. Not over me.\" \"I would say there's reason, my lady.\" Hecate hums knowingly, expertly pinning the braids into place. \"You've bound yourself to the Underworld for six months out of every year. Of your own volition did you eat of the pomegranate tree, without thinking twice about it.\" She reminds her, hands moving to Persephone's shoulders to gently turn her around. \"He had every intention of wooing you himself, properly. That's why he brought you here in the first place.\" \"Tell that to the Olympians.\" Persephone drawls, rolling her eyes. \"Tell that to my mother.\" Hecate smiles. \"He did try to.\" She quirks a brow. \"We all saw how well that went.\" Persephone giggles softly, nodding in agreement. \"She would have made it impossible for him to come near me, let alone woo me and marry me.\" Her cheeks grew warm once more. \"Though why he chose me...when there are no doubt so many others much stronger than I...far more beautiful and-\" \"Believe me, my lady...there's never been anyone else for him. And there never will be.\" Hecate's ancient gaze grew soft. \"He just never meant for you to eat the fruit of his land. The severity of such-\" \"I knew what I was doing.\" Her lips curve into a smile, one most who knew her would find to be a little too mischievous for her. Persephone lowers her lilac gaze to her fingers in her lap as Hecate's words weighed heavily upon her. \"I still do.\" Hecate returned her smile with one just as teasing. \"Yes, but he doesn't know your reasons, sweet girl. He does not know how you feel about him. You two barely had time to get to know each other for your mother stopped summer and you ate the seeds for him to actually-\" Persephone's brow furrows. \"I wanted to be free, Hecate. I love my mother, you know I do, and I shall see her again, but she would have kept me from everyone and everything if I had stayed her compliant, sweet little Kore. This...this is better.\" She smiles blissfully, her gaze focusing now on the dark lord as he circled around the tree again, muttering to himself. \"It is not so bad here. The stories my mother...the nymphs...what they said about this place and Hades...are all so laughable to me now.\" A laugh bubbles out of her, and Hades looks up in surprise from the sound, despite the distance between them. Her heart skips a beat, overflowing with something she can't name as she gasps out, \"I...I believe I was always meant to be here, Hecate. Does that sound mad? I'm happy here. I feel...I feel as if I have a purpose now.\" \"It's not mad at all. Anyone can see that you're free here, my lady, to be exactly what you were always meant to be.\" Hecate gives another knowing smile before she rises from the divan. \"You've gotten just what you wanted.\" \"I suppose I have.\" Persephone smiles, tearing her lilac eyes away to look up at Hecate's proffered hand. Hecate helped Persephone up as well, reaching out to give her shoulders a gentle squeeze. \"Then please, my lady, if I can request anything of you, perhaps you would like to ease some of my lord's pain? If he mopes over dinner again I daresay I will lose my mind.\" Persephone's stomach instantly fills with butterflies, and she casts a nervous glance towards her husband. Her husband whom she hardly knows, who she wishes so desperately to know. Mad as it was, she knew it was the same feeling for her that it was for him. That there would never be another soul meant for her, and if Hecate was right, which she always was, then it was how he felt too. Little as she knew, Persephone was certain in her role here, as queen, but ultimately, as Hades' wife. \"I shall try,\" Persephone murmurs. \"But what shall I say? How can I show him what I feel?\" Hecate gave a loose shrug, chuckling lowly. \"I assure you, he has no idea what to say either. If you two would simply...speak from the heart...you might find the results you are looking for.\" Cool fingers tip Persephone's cheek to the side, and Hecate's dark gaze scans the young queen's face. \"There is nothing to fear, my lady. He is not like the others above. He would not be moping, trying to conjure up ideas on how to truly win the heart of his wife if he were.\" \"I know.\" Persephone murmurs. \"I know that more than anything.\" He would have violated her and left her, had he been like the others that her mother had fought so hard to protect her from. He wouldn't have batted an eyelash. If he was truly as terrible as mortals believed, he would have devoured her whole the moment he stole her away, without any qualms or regrets. He was powerful, just, and strong. He was the brother of Poseidon, and her father Zeus. Should he wish to take her, he could, by force, and there would be nothing done about it. But instead, he had been attentive, kind, and so very warm for a man who outwardly seemed so cold. His respect for her was unlike anything she had ever experienced before, and the fact that he truly saw her as his equal and not an underling made him all the more...handsome. Smiling, Persephone brushes her fingers against Hecate's cheek before she turns her attention back toward her husband. Hecate hums and gives a slight incline of her head before drifting away. Hades had made his way around the tree he had been circling, and would not notice her approach right away. Gathering her courage, Persephone brushes her fingers over the faint rose colored fabrics of her chiton before moving down the steps of the small patio and onto the grass. Instantly, she could feel the earth react to her touch, even so far below it's surface. Once, she had longed for fresh air, for the world above. But now, she never wished to be parted from this place. As she moves through the garden, she quickly gathers asphodel blooms and places them in her hair, coaxing the blossoms to curl their way through the intricate twists and braids done by Hecate. Persephone smiles brightly as he comes around the tree, his jaw dropping slightly at her sudden appearance. He halts his steps, silvery eyes meeting hers instantly. For a moment, all either of them can do is simply stare at each other. The air grows still and sharp, a sudden warmth passing between them. Husband and Wife. King and Queen. Shy and demure as they stand before each other in the garden of the dead. \"Good day, my lord.\" She murmurs, breaking the silence with a voice as soft and sweet as a spring melody. Her gentle tone surprises him for some reason, and yet, he cannot help the smile that crosses his lips. \"Good day to you, sweet Persephone. You are a vision.\" She blushes at his choice of words, her heart trembling within her chest, but she does not recoil. \"Does something trouble you today, my lord? I would wager this tree has not had this much attention in decades.\" Her voice is curious and innocent, but her eyes hold a teasing gleam. \"I...\" He begins doing his best not to sputter as he draws a hand up to scratch along his dark beard. \"Forgive me for disturbing you, my lady. There's...merely matters of business that have...addled me greatly.\" \"You could never disturb me,\" She says quickly, giving him a sweet smile when he looks back at her anxiously. Her heart squeezes with longing to ease him, and before she even realizes what she's doing, Persephone moves to his side and slips her hand through his arm. \"P-perhaps I may help you take your mind off of such things.\" She's distracted by the strength and warmth of his body, the heady musk of him, the gentility of him as his free hand moves to drop against hers as though on reflex. Her heart is pounding wildly, echoing loudly in her ears and she's almost positive he can hear it. Calm yourself, she chides inwardly. She has held onto his arm before, has stood at his side, but for some reason, it's different today. Everything about him is suddenly so distracting, she almost forgets herself. \"O-oh?\" He breathes, his brows raising in surprise. \"I...would hate to monopolize your time-\" \"I only have six months.\" She can't help but laugh, though the sound is slightly bitter and off putting. \"I...I would hate to waste what precious little time we do have together.\" Persephone chews on her lip, a soft, shuddering breath escaping her as his warm fingers press against hers in an almost soothing manner. She shyly lifts her violet gaze to meet his, hoping the smile she bore was encouragement enough. \"Yes...\" He murmurs, silvery eyes alight with something like hope. \"If that is what you wish, my lady.\" \"And what do you wish?\" She can't help but ask, a stuttering little laugh escaping her. \"Only your happiness, sweet Persephone.\" He says without hesitation. Persephone holds his gaze, her breath catching in her throat as the truth of his words washed over her. Hades lifts his hand from hers, hesitating briefly before his fingertips brush lightly over her jaw. \"And...how you could find it here...at my side...still seems so...impossible to me.\" Even after he had stolen her away from everything she had known, only yearning to know her, yearning to love her, she chose to stay. She did not run away from him in fear like so many others would have. She ate of the fruit of his land, she chose him. Even as innocent Kore, the fire of Persephone had appeared in her sparkling violet eyes nearly the moment she arrived in his kingdom. Persephone stares up at him now, her hand slowly lifting to catch his before he could drop it from her face, to hold him in place and lock this moment away within her heart and soul for the rest of their days. Yes, she belongs here, to this kingdom, to him. She always had, long before she ever even was born. \"It would seem, my dear husband, that the impossible is quite possible when it comes to the two of us.\" She murmurs. \"Yes,\" He breathes. \"Then...it would please me greatly if you would join me in a stroll about the gardens. That we would not...waste anymore precious time.\" Persephone gives his hand a gentle squeeze. \"Would that please you, my lord?\" \"It would please me greatly, sweet Persephone.\"",

      "\"Then please, my lady, if I can request anything of you, perhaps you would like to ease some of my lord's pain?",
      "If he mopes over dinner again I daresay I will lose my mind.\"",
      "Persephone's stomach instantly fills with butterflies, and she casts a nervous glance towards her husband.",
      "Her husband whom she hardly knows, who she wishes so desperately to know.",
      "Mad as it was, she knew it was the same feeling for her that it was for him.",
      "That there would never be another soul meant for her, and if Hecate was right, which she always was, then it was how he felt too.",
      "Little as she knew, Persephone was certain in her role here, as queen, but ultimately, as Hades' wife.",
      "\"I shall try,\" Persephone murmurs.",
      "\"But what shall I say?",
      "How can I show him what I feel?\" Hecate gave a loose shrug, chuckling lowly.",
      "\"I assure you, he has no idea what to say either.",
      "If you two would simply...speak from the heart...you might find the results you are looking for.\"",
      "Cool fingers tip Persephone's cheek to the side, and Hecate's dark gaze scans the young queen's face.",
      "\"There is nothing to fear, my lady.",
      "He is not like the others above.",
      "He would not be moping, trying to conjure up ideas on how to truly win the heart of his wife if he were.\"",
      "\"I know.\"",
      "Persephone murmurs.",
      "\"I know that more than anything.\"",
      "He would have violated her and left her, had he been like the others that her mother had fought so hard to protect her from.",
      "He wouldn't have batted an eyelash.",
      "If he was truly as terrible as mortals believed, he would have devoured her whole the moment he stole her away, without any qualms or regrets.",
      "He was powerful, just, and strong.",
      "He was the brother of Poseidon, and her father Zeus.",
      "Should he wish to take her, he could, by force, and there would be nothing done about it.",
      "But instead, he had been attentive, kind, and so very warm for a man who outwardly seemed so cold.",
      "His respect for her was unlike anything she had ever experienced before, and the fact that he truly saw her as his equal and not an underling made him all the more...handsome.",
      "Smiling, Persephone brushes her fingers against Hecate's cheek before she turns her attention back toward her husband.",
      "Hecate hums and gives a slight incline of her head before drifting away.",
      "Hades had made his way around the tree he had been circling, and would not notice her approach right away.",
      "Gathering her courage, Persephone brushes her fingers over the faint rose colored fabrics of her chiton before moving down the steps of the small patio and onto the grass.",
      "Instantly, she could feel the earth react to her touch, even so far below it's surface.",
      "Once, she had longed for fresh air, for the world above.",
      "But now, she never wished to be parted from this place.",
      "As she moves through the garden, she quickly gathers asphodel blooms and places them in her hair, coaxing the blossoms to curl their way through the intricate twists and braids done by Hecate.",
      "Persephone smiles brightly as he comes around the tree, his jaw dropping slightly at her sudden appearance.",
      "He halts his steps, silvery eyes meeting hers instantly.",
      "For a moment, all either of them can do is simply stare at each other.",
      "The air grows still and sharp, a sudden warmth passing between them.",
      "Husband and Wife.",
      "King and Queen.",
      "Shy and demure as they stand before each other in the garden of the dead.",
      "\"Good day, my lord.\"",
      "She murmurs, breaking the silence with a voice as soft and sweet as a spring melody.",
      "Her gentle tone surprises him for some reason, and yet, he cannot help the smile that crosses his lips.",
      "\"Good day to you, sweet Persephone.",
      "You are a vision.\"",
      "She blushes at his choice of words, her heart trembling within her chest, but she does not recoil.",
      "\"Does something trouble you today, my lord?",
      "I would wager this tree has not had this much attention in decades.\"",
      "Her voice is curious and innocent, but her eyes hold a teasing gleam.",
      "\"I...\" He begins doing his best not to sputter as he draws a hand up to scratch along his dark beard.",
      "\"Forgive me for disturbing you, my lady.",
      "There's...merely matters of business that have...addled me greatly.\"",
      "\"You could never disturb me,\" She says quickly, giving him a sweet smile when he looks back at her anxiously.",
      "Her heart squeezes with longing to ease him, and before she even realizes what she's doing, Persephone moves to his side and slips her hand through his arm.",
      "\"P-perhaps I may help you take your mind off of such things.\"",
      "She's distracted by the strength and warmth of his body, the heady musk of him, the gentility of him as his free hand moves to drop against hers as though on reflex.",
      "Her heart is pounding wildly, echoing loudly in her ears and she's almost positive he can hear it.",
      "Calm yourself, she chides inwardly.",
      "She has held onto his arm before, has stood at his side, but for some reason, it's different today.",
      "Everything about him is suddenly so distracting, she almost forgets herself.",
      "\"O-oh?\"",
      "He breathes, his brows raising in surprise.",
      "\"I...would hate to monopolize your time-\" \"I only have six months.\"",
      "She can't help but laugh, though the sound is slightly bitter and off putting.",
      "\"I...I would hate to waste what precious little time we do have together.\"",
      "Persephone chews on her lip, a soft, shuddering breath escaping her as his warm fingers press against hers in an almost soothing manner.",
      "She shyly lifts her violet gaze to meet his, hoping the smile she bore was encouragement enough.",
      "\"Yes...\" He murmurs, silvery eyes alight with something like hope.",
      "\"If that is what you wish, my lady.\"",
      "\"And what do you wish?\"",
      "She can't help but ask, a stuttering little laugh escaping her.",
      "\"Only your happiness, sweet Persephone.\"",
      "He says without hesitation.",
      "Persephone holds his gaze, her breath catching in her throat as the truth of his words washed over her.",
      "Hades lifts his hand from hers, hesitating briefly before his fingertips brush lightly over her jaw.",
      "\"And...how you could find it here...at my side...still seems so...impossible to me.\"",
      "Even after he had stolen her away from everything she had known, only yearning to know her, yearning to love her, she chose to stay.",
      "She did not run away from him in fear like so many others would have.",
      "She ate of the fruit of his land, she chose him.",
      "Even as innocent Kore, the fire of Persephone had appeared in her sparkling violet eyes nearly the moment she arrived in his kingdom.",
      "Persephone stares up at him now, her hand slowly lifting to catch his before he could drop it from her face, to hold him in place and lock this moment away within her heart and soul for the rest of their days.",
      "Yes, she belongs here, to this kingdom, to him.",
      "She always had, long before she ever even was born.",
      "\"It would seem, my dear husband, that the impossible is quite possible when it comes to the two of us.\"",
      "She murmurs.",
      "\"Yes,\" He breathes.",
      "\"Then...it would please me greatly if you would join me in a stroll about the gardens.",
      "That we would not...waste anymore precious time.\"",
      "Persephone gives his hand a gentle squeeze.",
      "\"Would that please you, my lord?\"",
      "\"It would please me greatly, sweet Persephone.\""

    "text": "There was a shadow. When had Patroclus arrived to this moonless sea? The familiar idyllic skin of Achilles that lit up his world went so briskly as the final thoughts of Hector standing above him faded away. His golden skin could not compare to the shadow of this death. Where had Achilles been? Was he lost among the other souls that dwelled in the laps of black water against the rocky shore? Maybe it was Patroclus' torment. A nightmare where Achilles would walk alongside him from one sea to the next, and they could not see or hear each other's presence. The absolute indefatigability of this realm was hopeful. Patroclus could not stride for long without his heels being cut from the sharp stones of this dingy sea. When he grew tired, he grew restless. Patroclus continued to feel Achilles and all his strength. He could taste the movement of Achilles' sweat on his lips as he fought for him. The quick draw of breath as he ran down to siege Troy. The work of this demigod, Aristos Achaion. Would this name still sustain even in the afterlife? These words were forgotten to Patroclus. All the time he had been walking, who knew what waves he had seen without Achilles. The breeze was sharp and cold and stung with epiphany of a living world. A world that forgot one's name and story. Achilles would not be burdened, the stories of his fighting would thrive and inspire. Achilles would be name everyone will know and sacrifice to. A name to present to those who prove themselves better than the rest. A divine blood. Maybe blood that had once been in Achilles. Would Patroclus' blood be so bold? The blood that had marked his trail to the underworld? Patroclus would watch the moon rise each night, only to remember it was not the moon. It was a white vision. One that contrasted the dark tumbling tides it floated on. Colossal, vague. Achilles would stand before him, skin so white it was bone. The hero's eyes closed in a daydream, he would never know of the scraps of armor he was adorned in. These dreams would depict Achilles in a brawl that was slowed immensely. They could go on for hours, or minutes. Patroclus would take these moments to rest and admire that expressionless warrior that he had slept beside every night. The bulge of Achilles' deltoids or the curve of his abdominals made the man weep. The dusty shade of his skin that no longer gleamed. Patroclus remembered when it was the same color as the sun. It had been so just before Patroclus took his place on Achilles' chariot. It had been so, just before Patroclus died. These nightmares would fall and the moon would disappear again. All Patroclus could hear were the waves. One evening this performance came again. It was unlike previous viewings. Achilles had a spear, and would thrust to let it go. Right before the shaft slipped through his palms... Achilles was gone. There wasn't a sign of Achilles for nights afterwards. The ocean was blissful. Memories of Thetis would stir and cause Patroclus to become shaky. He thought it ironic he was constantly by the sea, Thetis' domain. The tides would freeze then and Patroclus was forced to stand back from the shoreline. Once settled onto the soaked stones of the only ground he knew he tried to imagine Achilles next to him. The aroma of the sea that flowed with him or the deep breaths of solitude they would share together. During one of these endless nights while waiting for the moon - for Achilles, death became darker. The splash of the waves were not seen and the only sense of water Patroclus had was the sound of the sea trickling beneath his feet. A voice came. It was a long note that changed pitches slightly, a female voice. Multiple voices came, all singing a distinct pitch of their own, sounding eerie and turning to a shrill as the moon finally rose. It was Achilles, this spectrum of a warrior. Muscles moved with a fiery eagerness no man could posses. It would move in time and Patroclus' eyes could not keep up. Once it decelerated to the speed to which Patroclus could see Achilles' veins pulsing, something had gone wrong. He stood with no breath escaping his mouth and all in Hades had done the same. If there was time, Patroclus could not sense it now, if there was a light nearby, Patroclus would not see it. He was focused on this one man, before an arrow had entered the picture and struck him in the back. The man fell and his body became so white it caused the other dead souls to scream until it had burst into darkness. Leaving the millions of dead souls to reminisce and scorn at the light they had long been without. Patroclus was convinced this was a work of his subconscious. It had to be the darkness playing these tricks on his eyes. Where else would I find the light if not from Achilles? Patroclus thought, crouching down to his knees. If the manifestation was possible here, he had wept. The press of his wrists into his stomach would have bruised, and his fingernails would have scratched the skin from his legs. Would he be a coward? Even in death? Was the standard of a companion the same here? It had to be, Patroclus promised that he would not let Achilles down, even if in the living world he felt like he had. The tides became softer and his loneliness became subtle. He would still wait for the moon, the next evening he had expected nothing and nothing arrived. The night after he gave the idea of sleep an attempt. Hades, he had assumed, would not give him this relief. Once he closed his eyes a burning touch would sweep over his skin. This sensation would remind him of Achilles' warm embrace and then he could not sleep. The touch became more apparent and then he realized it was not a trick of Hades. A mass was beginning to form and Patroclus stood in distress. He could sense this unknown phantom in front of him. He could tell it was watching him. Patroclus reached out and felt a limb, his hands triggering a light that did not blind him but yet he saw nothing when he peered into its depths. It was soft and felt alive. There was a heat coming from this sun and Patroclus' withered hand dropped when he saw the cuts of his fingers glowing like a mass against this white light, and a palm reaching out to grasp his own. \"Patroclus? Is that you?\" Patroclus looked into the head of this fire, a body standing before him. The heat protruding from it calming him as he felt himself wrapped in the arms of the man who held that kind of warmth. The chorus of shrills echoing behind as he came into view. \"Achilles?\" Patroclus released his hands from the form to grasp its cheeks, his thumb gliding against bones that pierced again its lifeless skin. A ray of clouds and sun clenched to Achilles' silhouette as he nodded and his face became clear. His soul had found its way through the earth to appear at Patroclus' side. There was a glow in the godly contours of his face. Achilles was dead. No more would the nightmares of a pale hero, doomed to fail, fog Patroclus' mind. He did not know how death had changed himself. He assumed he was still not strong, or notable. Yet Achilles' spirit was more than before. A radiance that held its own would single him out in this gloomy underworld. With endless wandering and sleepless nights, Patroclus had never been able to approach this soul. He only had to reach out and find the light that was trailing in the darkness behind him. The shadow of his loneliness had faded and a new one grew from the golden smile Achilles had beaming across his face.",

    "text": "The world seemed hazy. Like he was in the space between sleeping and waking. Everything was moving slowly, he was aware of people coming in. people touching his shoulder and telling him to rest. To eat. To bury the man. But he couldn't move. He couldn't bring himself to take his eyes from the face he knew so well. It felt as though he were stuck in molasses, drifting so slowly as the world moved around him. He looked down at the man before him and closed his eyes. \"Please. Please please please. Wake up. Just wake up. Please. Please. I'll do anything. I'll do anything.\" He gripped the cold hand and prayed for those fingers to curl around his. \"I'm begging you. Please open your eyes.\" He opened his own slowly and brought the hand to his lips, \"Please don't leave me.\" The night stretched on for what felt like years. The sounds outside the tent fell quiet and eventually the world was silent. Achilles brushed the hair from Patroclus' face. \"Still look well. You do.\" He trailed his fingers down his cheek and smiled sadly, \"How am I ever going to do this without you?\" He lay down and pressed his face into the man's neck. \"I don't want to be here without you.\" He gave into the tears that were pushing up through his throat; gripping g the blanket that had been wrapped around his love. \"Please wake up. Please.\" He was met with the same silence that had met him every day since Patroclus was brought back. He shook his head and pressed a kiss to the point where he had felt the strong beat of his heart so many times. \"I want you back. Gods how I want you back. You're the only person I want. I'd give all of them up for one more moment with you. One more.\" He sat up and looked down at the man, \"Just one more word. One more smile. One more kiss. Just one more. Patroclus...please.\" Met with silence again he nodded, \"It's okay.\" He ran his fingers through Patroclus' hair, \"You can take your time. I'm not going anywhere.\" The nights turned -as they always did- to day and he remained in the same spot; only giving in to sleep when it took over him, but always waking up shouting the same name- only to curl up against him once more and breathe shallowly into the crook of his neck once more. It was one afternoon that he sat on the floor opposite the bed; hugging his knees to his chest and staring at the hand that lay on the edge of the bed, \"I don't want to be a god Patroclus. Not anymore. I thought I knew what my fate was but if this is it....I want no part of it. I was a god anyway wasn't I? In your eyes. I always was. That should have been enough. If only it was enough. I'm sorry.\" He ran his hands through his hair and sighed heavily, \"I don't care anymore Patroclus. I don't care.\" He sniffed and looked up at him. \"Tell me what to do. Please.\" He nodded at the silence, \"It's alright. I already know.\" He climbed from the floor and settled into the bed next to him. He pulled the blanket over them both and kissed his cheek, \"Do you think it'd matter if I didn't become what I'm destined to be? Do you think the world will end? That the seas will boil and birds will fall from the sky? Or do you think I'd be forgotten and the world won't suffer? I don't think the world can suffer more than I am right now.\" He wrapped his arms around the man and pulled him close. \"I think we could live well. Away from here. Start over. A new day with us both. Do you remember how we were those years ago? With Chiron? That's where we'd go. We'd find him and live out our days. Wake together. Sleep together. I'd take care of you I promise. For all eternity I'd take care of you.\" He kissed Patroclus' head, \"I'd take care of you the way you've taken care of me. Because you have. Better than anyone.\" He stared up at the ceiling of their tent; his fingers running slowly through Patroclus' hair. The tent was growing dark when the idea came to him. He paused for a moment then smiled to himself, \"I'm gonna make this right. We're gonna have that life. The one we were meant to have. I promise.\" He kissed his head once more and laced their fingers together. \"Good night. At first light he took one last look at Patroclus and opened the door of the tent. \"You there.\" The soldier turned and stood to attention. \"No one goes near this tent you understand?\" \"Yes...but shouldn't we...I mean it's been five days.\" \"No one goes near the tent.\" The man paused before nodding. \"I'll be back soon.\" \"Sir.\" Achilles took a moment to look back at the tent before heading from the camp to the beach. He stood at the shore and looked out at the ocean, the wind blew into his tired face and he closed his eyes; he listened to the sound of the water and tried to feel something that wasn't just the emptiness inside his heart. He opened his eyes again and took a breath before standing straighter, \"I'm here. Where are you?\" He waited a moment before clenching his fists, \"I said I'm here. Now WHERE ARE YOU?\" He was met with the sound of the waves and huffed in annoyance. \"So now you ignore me? I come to you every time you call. Every time and the moment I need you, the one time I need you you're not here.\" He grabbed a rock from the shore and threw it as hard as he could at the water. It landed with a splash and he roared in anger, \"MOTHER. ANSWER ME. IM HERE.\" He stood shakily and looked out to the sea. His anger began to turn to despair and he clutched his head, \"I need you. I need you NOW.\" \"Achilles.\" He turned and dropped his hands at the sight of his mother; for a split moment he felt afraid, he wanted to run into her arms and scream. He wanted her to hold him like a child and tell him everything would be alright. Instead he clenched his fists and stood straight again, \"Bring him back.\" Thetis watched him for a moment, \"Bring who-\" \"PATROCLUS. Bring....bring him back.\" \"I can't do that. He's gone.\" \"YOURE A GOD. BRING HIM BACK.\" His legs gave out and he fell to his knees, \"Please. Please I need him. Please.\" The tears were coming thick and fast and Thetis stepped closer, \"My son, you're destiny is to-\" \"I don't care about my destiny. My destiny was to die on those fields but I'm dead already. Without him I am dead. I need him. I need him. Please. Please bring him back.\" \"No. You don't need him. You never needed him. You're destined to be a god. He is a mortal. And a poor one at that.\" Achilles looked up at her, his fists clenching in anger, \"You dare speak of him in that manner.\" \"You dare speak to me in that manner.\" \"Bring. Him. Back.\" \"No.\" Achilles nodded and stood slowly before grabbing the knife strapped to his leg and pressing it to his own throat. Thetis made the tiniest movement toward him before stopping herself, \"You bring him back or I go to him. Either way we're to be together.\" \"You'd kill yourself to be with him?\" He pressed the blade into his flesh; sending a trickle of blood down his throat onto his tunic. \"Bring him back or I swear-\" \"Then do it Achilles.\" He was shocked. He looked at his mother and sobbed before dropping the knife and falling to his knees. He screamed into his hands as the grief tore through him once more. Thetis reached forward to touch him before changing her mind and stepping back. \"I'm sorry you're hurting.\" And with that she was gone and Achilles was alone once more. He sobbed into his hands until he couldn't anymore. He fell back and hugged his knees to his chest. The blood on his neck had dried and was sticking his clothing to his skin. He stared out into the ocean for hours. No one came to find him and his mother did not return. He stared out at the sunlight on the water and planned how long he would have to swim before exhaustion took over and he would sink under. He thought about it; would it hurt to drown? It would hurt less than Patroclus' final moments. The thought alone made him feel sick and he shook his head. He looked up at the horizon and though about Patroclus. He thought of the times when they swam together. The fight they had to prove who could jump higher. Who could dive deeper? Achilles. He thought about the forest. The way Patroclus smiled at him, he thought of the taste of his skin; the way he shuddered when kissed in certain places, the way- \"Achilles!\" He turned his head and looked at the man panting heavily beside him. \"What? What do you want?\" \"It's your friend. He calls for you.\" \"My friend?\" \"Patroclus sir. He wants you.\" Achilles looked back at the ocean, \"You're mistaken. Patroclus is gone.\" \"No sir he's not. He refuses to see a doctor he's just shouting for you. Some of the men are...afraid. He's here.\" Achilles looked at the man and stood slowly; grabbing the knife as he went. \"If you're lying to me.\" \"I'm not. I'm not I swear. Please sir.\" Achilles strapped the knife to himself again and began to run. \"Please calm down. Just calm down.\" \"Where is he? Is he alive? Tell me where he-\" Achilles burst into the tent and stopped at the sight of Patroclus. The man was stood beside the bed looking as healthy as any of the others. A doctor had one hand on his arm and was trying to calm him down. Achilles stepped in closer; pushing the doctor away and lifting a hand, \"Patroclus.\" The men looked at each other for a moment before embracing. The doctor stepped back and dropped his head as the men hugged. Achilles pulled back and took Patroclus' face in his hands; \"How is this possible? How are you...here?\" \"I don't know. I don't know. I woke up and you weren't here.\" \"I'm sorry. I'm sorry I wasn't here.\" \"You are now its fine.\" \"But you're okay? You feel okay?\" \"I feel fine.\" Achilles moved his fingers to the spot he knew Patroclus' pulse laid and waited. The steady beating against his fingers made his eyes fill with tears again, \"You're here. You're really here.\" Patroclus nodded, \"I'm here.\" Achilles pulled him in and hugged him again. \"You're so warm.\" Patroclus laughed and gripped him tightly; burying his face into Achilles shoulder as the smile stretched across his lips. \"You're okay. It's healed well. No infection. I have....no explanation. This is down to the gods I would expect.\" \"But he's okay? He'll survive?\" \"I wouldn't suggest going straight out to battle again but yes. He will be fine.\" Patroclus smiled at the doctor and stood up, \"I feel fine.\" Achilles grinned at him and turned to the doctor. \"Thank you doctor.\" \"Get some rest. Both of you.\" They nodded and watched as the man left the tent. Achilles waited a moment before turning to Patroclus, \"You really feel okay?\" \"Yes. Except....why am I here Achilles? What did you do?\" \"I didn't do anything....I mean I asked my mother for help.\" \"Your mother? Then there's a catch. There always is with her.\" \"Maybe not, maybe....maybe she just...loves me enough.\" \"Really? She must want something in return.\" Achilles shook his head, \"I don't know. I don't care. You're here. You're really here.\" He stepped closer and took Patroclus' hand. \"You've no idea how much I missed you. How dead I felt.\" \"How about how dead I felt?\" Achilles smiled and shook his head, \"Not funny.\" \"Come here.\" Achilles threw a glance at the tent door before stepping closer still and pressing a kiss to Patroclus' lips. \"I don't know why I'm here Achilles.\" Achilles pressed two fingers to his lips, \"It doesn't matter. We have time to figure it out. Figure all of it out. Together now.\" Patroclus nodded, \"I'm tired.\" Achilles smiled and caressed his cheek gently, \"Let's rest.\" Patroclus lay down first; Achilles lay next to him and rolled over to rest his head on Patroclus' chest. He closed his eyes and listened to the steady beating of his heart. \"I'm glad I'm here. I'm glad I have you again.\" \"You do. Forever you do.\" Patroclus nodded, \"Good.\" Achilles didn't sleep; every move that Patroclus made kept him up. He sat up and watched the man as he slept. Watched the steady rise and fall of his chest. He ached to reach out and rub his hands over the warm skin. Ached to press kisses everywhere he could reach. He settled for taking the man's hand and holding it gently. Patroclus muttered in his sleep and Achilles smiled. He watched as the man covered his face with his other arm and whined quietly. His eyes ran down his body and landed on the scars on his stomach. He felt his chest clench painfully at the sight and reached out to touch one gently. His finger trailed over the raised skin and Patroclus shifted and Achilles took his hand away. He lay back down and pressed the gentlest of kisses against hi shoulder before looking at the ceiling until Patroclus woke up. \"We should leave.\" Patroclus looked up from his breakfast, \"Leave?\" \"Yeah. Leave. Here. We can sail first thing. Head toward home.\" \"Been at the wine have you?\" \"Sorry?\" \"We can't leave Achilles. There's a war on.\" Achilles knelt in front of Patroclus and took his hands, \"A war that we don't need to be part of.\" \"The people here need us.\" \"Patroclus-\" \"No. The people need us. We can still fight.\" Achilles shook his head, \"Listen to me.\" Patroclus opened his mouth and Achilles covered it with a hand, \"Listen to me. You...you died. I let you die. I will not have that happen again. This war is basically won. Let's face it. If we aren't here nothing will be different. I cannot lose you. Can you lose me?\" Patroclus put a hand to Achilles face and shook his head. \"I will never forgive myself if you get hurt again. Never. I would rather die forgotten than let you get hurt again.\" Patroclus watched him for a moment before stroking his thumb against Achilles cheek. \"If you're worried about that I mean. I will give up my name. My future. My...I'd give up everything for you. I want you. I want you safe. I want you...please leave with me. Please live...with me.\" Patroclus swallowed and took Achilles hand from across his mouth. \"Achilles...\" \"Please.\" Patroclus closed his eyes and nodded, \"Okay.\" \"Really? You will?\" \"I will. For you. I will. Of course I will. Wherever you go I'll follow. You know that it's just....people are dying Achilles. Good people. Our people.\" Achilles pressed their foreheads together, \"You're too good. I love...I love you for that. But I've lost you once. And somehow. I don't know how...somehow I got you back. And I'm sorry, but not one of those lives is worth yours. Not one.\" \"Achilles...we can't-\" \"No. I'm not losing you again.\" Patroclus smiled, \"I was going to say...we can't sail until you do one thing for me.\" \"Oh....what?\" Patroclus pulled back and held Achilles face in his hands. \"Rest for me.\" \"I am rested.\" \"Don't lie. Look at you. You can't command a ship in this state. You can barely walk. Rest. And then we can sail.\" \"I can't...I can't go to sleep I need to keep watch.\" \"Keep watch for what?\" Achilles dropped his gaze, \"Watch for you. Every second I get with you is precious. I don't want to sleep and...I don't want to risk you going when I'm sleeping.\" \"I'm not going anywhere. Not for a long time. You on the other hand are going to fade away if you don't rest.\" Achilles nodded, \"Rest with me?\" \"Of course. I'll keep an eye on you and then you can keep an eye on me.\" Achilles smiled at him before leaning in for a kiss. Achilles opened his eyes suddenly and sat up, \"Patroclus!\" He looked around at the empty tent and began to panic, \"No no no no no.\" He flew from the bed and out of the tent. He looked around the camp and began to breathe heavily, \"Patroclus!\" He looked around for a moment before grabbing a soldier, \"Patroclus, where is he?\" \"Beach I think. Headed there about an hour ago.\" Achilles dropped his hand and began to run. When he got to the shore he stopped and looked around again. He caught sight of a figure in the sand and ran over to him, \"Patroclus!\" The man looked up at him, \"Hello.\" Achilles dropped to his knees and picked up Patroclus' head to search his face, \"Are you okay?\" \"I'm fine.\" \"Why are you here?\" Patroclus looked over Achilles shoulder and the man turned around, \"Mother.\" Thetis stood before them, \"I love you Achilles. You're my son and I love you. You're destined for greatness and it pains me that you disregard that in favour of...him.\" Patroclus blushed deeply and looked at the ground. \"You'll be forgotten. Is that what you want?\" Achilles stood and looked down at Patroclus, \"I want him. Mother.\" Thetis watched him for a moment before stepping back. \"Then he is yours. And you are no longer mine.\" \"I'm okay with that.\" Patroclus looked up at Thetis for a moment. \"We're leaving in the morning. Away from here. Away from all this.\" Thetis looked at Patroclus for a long moment, \"This is your plan?\" \"N-no.\" \"But you want it too?\" \"Yes. Yes I do.\" She sneered at him and turned back to Achilles, \"I have no part of this. Goodbye. Achilles.\" Achilles nodded and Thetis turned back to the water. Patroclus stood and gripped Achilles arm, \"Thetis wait.\" She turned to face him and Patroclus gripped Achilles tighter, \"I just wanted to say....thank you.\" She looked him up and down for a moment before disappearing back into the sea. \"It was her. She brought me back. For you.\" \"Guess she did love me.\" \"Not enough.\" Achilles looked at him for a moment and Patroclus smiled, \"I loved you more.\" \"No. Not possible. I love you the most.\" \"Always a competition with you.\" Achilles laughed and embraced him, \"Let's go home.\" \"Are you alright?\" \"Hmm? Yes. Yes I'm okay.\" \"Not long now.\" Patroclus looked back out at the water and sighed, \"I feel guilty. Leaving them.\" \"Don't. Don't feel guilty.\" He looked up at Achilles and couldn't help but smile. \"Not long now.\" Achilles looked down at him and touched his shoulder. \"Not long.\" Chiron recognised them at once. All of a sudden they were 15 once more and were stumbling into another life. He examined Patroclus and proclaimed him healthy. They sat around the fire and told Chiron of the war, of the plan, of the time when Patroclus was gone, and of Thetis. Chiron listened patiently and asked questions when the time called for it. \"And your plan now?\" Achilles shrugged his shoulders, \"We came here. We're safe here. Do you mind?\" \"Not at all. Company at this age is always welcome, but is it enough for you both?\" Achilles looked at Patroclus. \"Yes. It is.\" Patroclus smiled and looked up at the sky, \"Stars are bright.\" Chiron nodded and settled down into the earth. \"Mm and I am weary.\" Achilles stood, \"We will leave you to your sleep.\" \"The cots are as you left them.\" \"Thank you Chiron. For everything.\" \"You are welcome Achilles. Patroclus.\" The two men nodded on acknowledgment, \"Good night.\" They walked into the cave; memories flooding back to both of them as they undressed and washed before climbing into the bed. They lay staring at the constellations in the ceiling. \"Patroclus?\" \"Yes?\" \"Guess what I'm thinking.\" \"I don't know. What are you thinking?\" Achilles looked at him for a moment, \"I'm thinking that we made the right decision.\" Patroclus reached over and touched Achilles face, \"Me too.\" They reached for each other and fell into the familiar routine they had perfected in their years together in the cave. Patroclus woke first. He looked at the ceiling for a long time before turning to Achilles. He moved closer and brushed their noses together. His finger trailed over the barely there scratch left from the knife. \"I thought you wanted me to rest?\" \"Sorry. Couldn't help it.\" Achilles opened his eyes and Patroclus was struck with a rush of love toward him. He surged forward and kissed him. \"Never stop doing that.\" Achilles smiled and kissed him again before rolling over and stretching. \"Come on. We should help Chiron.\" They spent the morning helping as much as they could before the sun made it too hot. They headed to the lake and dove in. Patroclus watched Achilles dive in with a grin. The man swam toward him and splashed him, \"Are you happy?\" Achilles dipped his head back into the cool water, \"What?\" \"Happy. Are you happy?\" He lifted his head and looked at Patroclus, \"I am. Why?\" Patroclus smiled, \"Because you were right. You are the first hero to be happy.\" Achilles took a moment before breaking into a grin. \"I am.\" He swam toward Patroclus and pressed a quick kiss to his lips before moving toward the shore and climbing from the water. \"Are you coming?\" Patroclus swam toward him, \"Where?\" Achilles pulled his tunic on, \"Anywhere you want.\" Patroclus stepped from the water and reached for his own clothes, \"For how long?\" Achilles took a long moment to look at him before smiling, \"Forever.\" Patroclus pulled his tunic on before grasping his hand and following him to their forever.",

    "text": "The sun comes out for the funeral. It's been raining for weeks, and the air is still heavy with the smell of wet pavements, but on the morning of the funeral the sun shines fiercely onto their shoulders and catches in the leaves on the trees, bringing the streets back to life. It is the kind of day Patroclus would have loved, Achilles thinks, on the drive to the crematorium, and feels a little sick. His father sits beside him, hands clenched tight in his lap. Achilles heard him crying, the night Patroclus' body was found, gunshot neat in the centre of his stomach, but didn't say anything. He didn't know what to say - he still doesn't know, he just slumps silently against the window and watches the road flash by. Tact was Patroclus' forte, not his. The collar of his shirt rubs uncomfortably against his throat. He feels trapped by the tie and the jacket, the shoes polished a bright black, all too formal to honour Patroclus properly in. He can't remember Patroclus ever wearing a suit, not even to their school dance; Patroclus always looked more at home in worn jeans and Achilles' favourite hoodie. But he was wearing that hoodie the night he died. Achilles can still picture the dark stains left behind on the familiar material - bloodstains, death stains, black smudges marring the brightness. He used the hood of that hoodie to pull Patroclus in for a kiss before he went out, fists clenched tight around the fleece, laughing into Patroclus' mouth. Patroclus has fallen asleep in his lap in that hoodie, has weaved his fingers into Achilles' hair while Achilles blew him in that hoodie, has leaned against Achilles and waxed lyrical about countless novels in that hoodies - but all Achilles can see, now, is blood and guts and frayed edges. And Patroclus' face, white as snow without blood pumping under the skin, except for the mess of red-brown around his mouth. (The bullet was meant for him. No one says it, no one voices the thought, but it's there in their eyes, a dirty accusation - it should be you. They thought they were killing you.) Achilles had cried too, pressed the heel of his hand to his mouth and wept over Patroclus' body in the police morgue, his tears burning hot in his eyes and on his cheeks, and then again at home, sat on the edge of the bed that was Patroclus' as much as his own, staring numbly at the wall as his eyes spilt over again. The room was so full of Patroclus that it choked Achilles, caught in his throat and blocked his breathing until everything narrowed down to the image of the body seared onto his memory. \"Fuck,\" he'd muttered, because Patroclus was the wordsmith, Patroclus was the poet, Patroclus was the one who'd always know exactly what to say. All he had was fuck. It's all he has now, too - just fuck, running through his head like a prayer as they pull up outside a dull grey building and climb out. The concrete blocks the sun, casting the small crowd waiting by the doors into shadow. Achilles doesn't know whether that makes him want to laugh or cry. Briseis steps up with a tight smile, her eyes red beneath the tasteful makeup, and takes Peleus' arm. She trails her fingers along Achilles' arm as she passes him, her eyes soft, and he nods his gratitude. They were never quite as close to each other as they each were to Patroclus, but now Patroclus is gone and they're both aching from the same blows, and there is a solidarity in that that comforts Achilles, at least a little. He hovers by the car as she leads Peleus away towards the crematorium, his chest too tight to cope with the fake smiles and pitying eyes he'll meet if he follows. The weight of it all starts pressing harder, his blood rushing under his skin - he can hear it in his ears, a dizzying pounding - and everything seems too close and impossibly far away at the same time. His throat closes, his mouth goes dry, it gets harder to swallow, harder to breathe, and- And a hand presses against his cheek, lifts his head so he can meet steady blue eyes, and Hephaestion inhales and exhales carefully in front of him until Achilles' breathing matches his own. \"Sorry,\" Achilles mutters, when he can shape the word properly, and Hephaestion smiles sadly, stepping back to give Achilles space to fix his outfit back up. \"Don't be an idiot,\" he replies, forcibly light to hide the worry there, and Achilles avoids his eyes, and Alex's too, hovering behind Hephaestion, for fear of what he'll see there. Much as he loves his friends - and he does, with a terrible, blinding loyalty that Patroclus always said would get him killed one day, Achilles' stomach turns at the irony - he doesn't want them now. (He wants Patroclus, needs Patroclus, misses Patroclus so badly it hurts like a fire blazing through his veins, and it's not fair that Patroclus is gone when it was always supposed to be Achilles who died first, Achilles who took risks and made enemies and laughed at the men with bigger gangs and better than him.) \"C'mon,\" he says, his voice rough, and pushes past the two of them to join his father in the crowd. (Patroclus always said he wanted his body burnt. \"I don't want to rot,\" he told Achilles once, at the top of the hill they always climbed when they wanted to be alone. \"I don't want my body to waste away underground. I want to be cremated, and then I want you to scatter my ashes right here, into the wind so I end up everywhere.\" Achilles had laughed and dragged him down into a kiss, tangling his hands in Patroclus' hair and holding him close enough that they swapped air instead of breathing.) The hill feels smaller when Achilles makes his way up it, after the funeral is over. Briseis had offered to come with him, and Alexander and Hephaestion, and his father, but this is something he needs to do himself. One last promise he has to keep. The wind picks up as he reaches the top, almost as though the world knows that Patroclus deserves a proper goodbye. It blows Achilles' hair into his eyes, catches hold of his jacket and his tie and tosses them around him, and when Achilles opens the urn and tips the ashes out they dance through the air like stars in the night sky, like they're alive again. Some twirl back into Achilles' face, stroking over his cheeks and his lips like kisses, and he's crying, he's sobbing, he's screaming all his anger and his sorrow and his burning, aching love into the wind. Later, when the wind dies down and the ashes have disappeared into the sky, he collapses to the ground with wet cheeks and a hoarse throat, buries his face in his arms and whispers, \"Goodbye,\" until the word stops making sense.",

      "I want to be cremated, and then I want you to scatter my ashes right here, into the wind so I end up everywhere.\"",
      "Achilles had laughed and dragged him down into a kiss, tangling his hands in Patroclus' hair and holding him close enough that they swapped air instead of breathing.)",
      "The hill feels smaller when Achilles makes his way up it, after the funeral is over.",
      "Briseis had offered to come with him, and Alexander and Hephaestion, and his father, but this is something he needs to do himself.",
      "One last promise he has to keep.",
      "The wind picks up as he reaches the top, almost as though the world knows that Patroclus deserves a proper goodbye.",
      "It blows Achilles' hair into his eyes, catches hold of his jacket and his tie and tosses them around him, and when Achilles opens the urn and tips the ashes out they dance through the air like stars in the night sky, like they're alive again.",
      "Some twirl back into Achilles' face, stroking over his cheeks and his lips like kisses, and he's crying, he's sobbing, he's screaming all his anger and his sorrow and his burning, aching love into the wind.",
      "Later, when the wind dies down and the ashes have disappeared into the sky, he collapses to the ground with wet cheeks and a hoarse throat, buries his face in his arms and whispers, \"Goodbye,\" until the word stops making sense."

    "text": "Poseidon was confident the city that resided on the land of Attica would be named after him. Men feared him. They were in awe whenever he created storms on the sea and earthquakes on land. Athena, in comparison, was a mere warrior and craftswoman. She could never compete with him. In front of a party that included the rest of the Olympians as well as the citizens of Attica, Poseidon stood in front of the snake-king of Athens, Cecrops. Cecrops' tail was curled around his throne. \"Poseidon, what have you brought my city?\" Cecrops asked. \"This is my gift to you, King Cecrops.\" Poseidon stuck his trident in the ground. Water came out spurting of it. \"A spring! This is for you and your people. You can drink it. It should be enough to sustain a city here. \" Cecrops slithered his way to the spring. He summoned some of the Attican people to come to the spring. Poseidon was never a god of the rivers of Greece. Achelous was. If Achelous made the spring, the water from it would be drinkable. But since Poseidon made the spring, the water from it was salty, making it hard to drink. Cecrops and the people who tasted the spring spat the water out as soon as they drank it. Cecrops slithered back to his throne as his subjects resumed their places. He coughed. \"Thank you, Poseidon.\" He gestured towards Athena, wearing her usual suit of armor. \"Athena, what have you brought the people of this city?\" Athena walked towards the king. She was silent. Poseidon watched her. He noticed something off about her walk. It was a slow walk, the walk of someone that walked among humans, not of a divinity used to divine palaces. But Athena wasn't a human in disguise as Athena, so he shook off his suspicion. Athena drove her spear into the ground. A tree came out of it. It was gnarled and twisted. Its branches bore fruit and leaves. Cecrops slithered over to the tree. \"What is this?\" \"It is an olive tree, King.\" Athena's voice sounded more jovial and less stern than usual. But Poseidon shook it off again. \"You can do many things with it. Have one of its fruits.\" \"An olive?\" \"Yes. It is called an olive.\" Cecrops tried the olive. \"Delicious!\" \"You can eat the olive by itself or make oil from it. And the oil can be used for many things: to cook your foods with, to heal the sick, to light your lamps...Demeter can teach you how to do these things.\" \"She can?\" \"In the affairs of growing things and their many uses, she is far more experienced than I am. But that is not all you can do with this tree. You can use the wood from it and build your homes and boats with it. I, of course, can help you with your homes and boats.\" Cecrops nodded. \"Thank you, Goddess.\" Athena, with her unusual walk, walked back to her starting position. \"Poseidon, Athena, thank you. I now leave the choosing of the patron of this city in the hands of your fellow Olympians.\" It was when Athena stood up straighter that Poseidon noticed a flash in her green eyes. Wait, Poseidon thought. Athena doesn't have green eyes. He looked closer at Athena, under her helmet. He was right; it wasn't Athena at all. It was Demeter. Poseidon looked out at the audience viewing the contest. He noticed a black horse in the crowd looking at him and...laughing. \"Mother has waited so long to avenge you,\" the horse whispered. Only Poseidon could hear him talking. \"Today is that day.\" Poseidon realized the horse was his son, Arion, the child he had with Demeter while she was looking for her daughter Persephone. And he knew how he had taken advantage of Demeter while she was grieving for her loss. Poseidon looked at the Olympians. Sure enough, Demeter had blue eyes, not her usual green eyes. And it felt like Poseidon was the only person noticing these things in Attica. Hermes relayed the decision to Cecrops when the Olympians had finished their vote. Cecrops nodded when he received the message. He stood out of his throne. \"The Olympians have decided their winner. By a vote of 10-0, they have decided that Athena will be the patron of our city. From now on, the city's name is Athens, and our city's defender will be known as 'Athena of the City.'\" The crowd cheered. The Olympians clapped. But Poseidon was furious. \"I was cheated! I was cheated! Demeter tricked me!\" His voice was drowned out by the crowd cheering. Poseidon raised a wave over the city, silencing the cheer. \"Because of my loss and the way I was cheated out of my city, I shall flood it.\" Hermes flew over to Poseidon. He was able to talk Poseidon out of flooding Athens. But trickery or no trickery, Poseidon still lost. After Athena and Demeter had a \"private conference,\" Demeter walked to Poseidon. \"I am sorry you lost this contest. I was certain the people of Athens would accept your spring.\" \"You won, Demeter. I have accepted defeat. Athens has its patron, and you have righted my wrong I committed against you. Leave me alone.\" \"You still have your shrines across this nation, and you'll have other cities you can be a patron of--\" \"Go away.\" Poseidon couldn't resist. He had to look up. He saw Demeter smiling at him as she left his side--a sly smile, a victorious smile. He wanted to retaliate against both Demeter and Athena. But since he was forbidden to destroy Athens as he saw fit, he had to live with not trusting his instincts and revealing Athena and Demeter's ruse before he ended up losing what he thought was his city. Demeter's machinations would be forgotten by later writers who wrote about the history of Athens and Greece. And even though today Greece, let alone Athens, is not as mighty as it once was, Demeter's grudge against one of her brothers helped make Athens into the city it is today.",

    "text": "It's the first day of spring and the face on him would curdle cream. What's new? they ask but they know. They know. She stands tall, at once golden and shades of midnight skies. To him, Persephone is the northern lights; despite the prior claims of Astraeus and Eos. (He admits this to no one; Hades has no poetic inclinations and he would be a laughing stock, oh.) \"He'll pine without you,\" he says. She smiles at him, brisk like winter. \"It is no reason to stay.\" \"Your mother has been in foul humour,\" he says, sourly. It's true. There's been talk of a polar vortex. The Niagara Falls froze and his halls have been thronging. \"That is her prerogative,\" she says. She crouches before Cerberus. All three heads try to lick her face and she laughs. Spring and summer will be dull without her laughter.. One more night. He can often coax one more night from her. He tells her how Cerberus will miss her and the Judges will frown, their brows heavy and black with consternation. Charon may sulk, which is always unseemly and it scares the new arrivals, who are already at odds with their existence. There is no cellphone coverage in the Underworld and Charon does not accept credit cards and the souls are in disarray and denial. Charon is never impressed when Hermes tells him there is an app for that; Am I Dead Yet?. It's a top seller, Hermes says, and Charon is missing a whole corner of the market. The rivers will sigh, or scream, as is their wont, and he thinks of all the oaths he might swear on the Styx. There is a wizened, blackened tree stump by the banks of Acheron and Hades knows better than to mention dead Leuce. Your children, he tells her, ill-begotten though two of them are. They will miss you. She cups his face in her perfect hands and tells him to grow a pair. He does not enjoy the idiom she acquires when she is away from home. (She stays another night.). It is the second day of spring. Demeter is threatening an Ice Age and Persephone laughs. She pulls on thigh-high leather boots and wears a long leather coat. \"You look like something out of The Matrix,\" says Hermes, as he comes to escort her away and Hades scowls. He does not know what Hermes means and he is jealous of Persephone's smiles when they are meant for another. Hades is a miser for his wife's smiles. Cerberus nudges his leg and whines; a requiem in three parts. She is going, he seems to say. She is going she is going somewhere we can't follow. Hades knows exactly how he feels.. He watches her, sometimes, from shadows, under New York bridges, like a particularly recalcitrant troll. \"He pines without you,\" he hears Hermes say. \"Who?\" asks Persephone, archly. Her heels click-clack on Manhattan's sidewalks. \"The dog or my king?\" Hermes laughs and Persephone's gaze flickers towards Hades' shadows. She smiles. \"He knows I am not gone far.\". \"It's Stockholm Syndrome,\" says Demeter, swirling her cocktail. \"You mark my words.\" \"It was long before Stockholm, Mother, and I made my choice. The place needed a woman's touch.\" Demeter looks unimpressed. For once, Hades is in accordance with his sister.. She walks through Central Park and Cerberus rushes towards her. The mortals, still encased in flesh and blood, cannot see Cerberus' three heads. Hades thinks they only see a stubby-legged Corgi. Persephone is delighted and she looks around for Hades. He is adept at hiding, even in summer time. She crooks her finger. \"Come to me.\" This is her kingdom come and he is little more than a vassal. \"Come,\" she says. She laughs when she sees him, her hands on her hips. \"You are a hipster, my husband,\" she says, regarding him critically. \"The plaid is a bit much.\" He is confused. Fashions pass him by and all of his mortal clothes are ill-fitting. He wears glasses to obscure his eyes, a little. (It is hard to hide the depths of hell in his black eyes.) \"Let me guess.\" Persephone is rubbing Cerberus' belly and his leg is thumping and he is, quite frankly, an embarrassment to the Underworld. (Hades knows that he is no better.) \"He was pining and so you sallied forth from your cave in the height of summer.\" \"Something like that.\" Hades' lips quirk into an unfamiliar shape; a smile, or near enough. He squints at the sky. \"It is overly warm.\" She bares her arms to the sunshine. \"Yes and it is glorious.\" She stands up and takes his arm. \"Come with me, dread lord, and we'll find a coffee shop, with air-conditioning.\" He snorts. Even if the sky is too blue and the sun is too bright; even if he is in danger of perspiring (and he can hear the roll of thunder of Zeus' amusement), she can coax a smile out of him, just as he can coax an extra night from her. Persephone whistles sharply and Cerberus sheepishly lowers his leg, poised as he was against a low railing.. \"Summer in New York,\" she says. \"Maybe you might grow to love it.\" \"And maybe Apollo will learn that turning women into trees is not an appropriate response to spurned love,\" he says. There is a peal of laughter and she holds his arm tighter. \"No one believes me when I say you have a sense of humour, you know.\" \"As no one believes me when I say that you have me wrapped around your little finger.\" Cerberus yelps and his tongue hangs out in an approximation of a laugh. \"Oh,\" Persephone. \"My lord. Everyone knows that. Come, let's get you inside before you get sunstroke.\" \"I think I already have it,\" says Hades, faintly. There really are too many heartbeats and too much breathing-breathing life and no one respects his personal space. His nose twitches. The pollen count is too high, too. \"I'll be home to you soon,\" says Persephone and she inhales all the life around them as though it is something joyous, to be savoured.. He retreats to the Underworld, where it is blessedly cool and dark and the souls have the good grace to be terrified of him, and where asphodel does not make him sneeze. Cerberus still pines. Perhaps Hades does too, a little.. It is the first day of fall. He taps his foot and everyone holds their breath. Winter breathes out and she returns, barefoot and laughing.",

I understand why she bit me: I've taken her from everything she's ever known. I'm quite selfish with her -- while she is here, no one but me is allowed to see her, let alone touch her or speak with her. I know that she must be lonely, but she is mine. Her own mother isn't allowed to see her. Her mother! How had I forgotten? I look out upon the earth. Barren...cold...deadly. I smile -- more souls for me. But my prisoner must not know of her mother's breakdown. She is crying now, weeping really. I wish that I could go to her and hold her. But I know that she will only bite me, and I rather like my hands. Where did this go wrong? All I've ever done is love her.She asks for food and water, but I cannot grant her wish. If I allow her to eat without telling her the consequences of her actions, she might hate me more for ensuring that she cannot leave me. I do send some food from above to her, though. I wish I could give her the food myself, but I know if she pleads me to let her go I will break and release her with the most humble of apologies. But as I have stated, I am selfish with her. I don't want to lose seeing her beautiful face, and I know that if her mother gets her back she would never be seen again. Though she does not know this yet, we will be wed at the next new moon. When we join in matrimony, she will be mine...but they could still take her from me if I don't get her to eat. I don't wish to deceive her: she must eat it of her own free will. I wish to speak with her, but find it a better idea to let her wander the gardens. She seems to cheer a little around the half-dead flowers and so do they. I wish that she would be that cheerful around me. Yes, I kidnapped her and yes, I plan on keeping her eternally, but I could make her happy. When I go up to the world, I could bring back little gifts like plants and flowers. One day I hope to bring her with me up there without the fear that she will run. But, for now, I watch as she gets her hands on a pomegranate, coaxes it to split in half for her, and begins to eat it. I smile. She is mine. Persephone...",

    "text": "Eros is older than any of them. He doesn't look it--doesn't want to look it--and instead retains the appearance of a young man with a high brow and a nose that curves just barely upwards and lips that might resemble his bow but are, more often than not, drawn tight with teeth digging into the flesh. His hair curls in ringlets, and his wings tuck themselves tight against his back. Dionysus thinks that he has a terrible desire to consume the older god. They run into each other frequently, facilitating each others' functions (does desire and love have anything to do with pleasure? Dionysus argues 'yes'), and each time, Dionysus is left wondering what it is he could do differently so as not to end up alone. (Not--alone, that is, but without Eros, and as fun as fucking mortals is, it is not the same, not when the fire burns harshly within his chest and demands he take take take.) Eros must know--he has a feel for these things--but so far has said nothing, and nothing has prompted Dionysus to bring it up. Except--and this is where things are beginning to get muddled, as they do in his festivals--Dionysus wants and needs and it will express itself in one way. He has a terrible cannibalistic streak, he fears, inherited from his grandfather. His beard itches and he tugs at it to try to keep his fingers otherwise occupied. Better say something before the maddening lust consumes him. Better say something before he rips Eros's wings apart without even knowing himself. So he waits, as long as possible, until they meet again at a party. \"We should talk,\" he says, and Eros nods his head, lips parted and eyes round and wide. \"You've wanted to talk for a while. Why now?\" They're making their way away from the party, towards a secluded courtyard, and Dionysus regrets making a decision to do anything at all. Eros smells good enough to eat. What a rotten, rotten thought, but it crosses Dionysus's mind anyways, and he tries to push it away (though he has always had an issue ignoring his gut). \"I will explode,\" Dionysus says, and Eros regards him with a raised eyebrow. \"I will. You should not like to be around for the result.\" \"I would not,\" Eros says, and he licks his lips. His eyes are dark. \"Dionysus,\" he says, and he leans in close, presses his body against Dionysus's, has to tilt his head up to see his face, \"I can destroy you now, if I wanted to.\" \"You already have,\" Dionysus answers, and it's true because his heart feels as though it is being torn apart by tiny hands and he is hard and he wants and he wants more than he ever has in his life and there is a stabbing pain in his shoulder that makes him wonder if maybe Eros had planned for this all along, had been the one to strike first with his golden arrows, and he wonders if maybe the warmth in his back is blood. He is destroyed. All he can think is how much he wants to possess. It is desperation and he does not like it. Eros presses even closer, as if trying to sink physically under Dionysus's skin, and Dionysus cries out. \"Have I?\" Eros asks, and no, he hasn't, and doesn't the fact that he could make things even worse change anything? No--no, it doesn't. Dionysus wants to beg, but he cannot find the language. They speak different tongues at times, and he is not sure what would properly express what he needs in the words of the cosmos. He doesn't bother trying, instead kissing Eros and hoping--hoping, hoping, hoping--that he does not get pushed away. (He doesn't, of course, because part of this had been Eros's want all along, and if he hadn't wanted Dionysus, the other god wouldn't have been able to get close to him. But Dionysus doesn't know that, won't know that.) Eros kisses back, demanding, requiring more than Dionysus knew he had to give, and he claims all of it in the same way Dionysus's fingers scratching the skin between Eros's wings mark a claim on him. \"This is not my real body,\" Eros says, and he cries out. \"I am not nearly this beautiful.\" \"I do not care. I am a goat.\" Dionysus bites Eros's neck and sucks on the space, and if this were to happen again years later down the line, men would call him a vampire. He is harsh with his kisses and his hands would leave bruises on anyone else. He needs. He needs he needs he needs and the repetition of the thought fills him until Eros's fingers come to the side of his face and he has a momentary respite. The clarity fills him like an ocean and he sees Eros--sees him, and he was telling the truth. It was not his real body, but a faint mimicry of what Eros actually is, and Dionysus feels tears start to flow at the sight. If he were human, if he were mortal, he'd be gone. (There is a reason, then, that Psyche was not permitted to look upon Eros's face.) Even as he is, Dionysus feels stunned and takes a moment to regain any kind of thought. When he comes back to himself, he is on his back, and Eros straddles him, waiting. His hands are soft and Dionysus tilts his head to bite at fingers lingering on his face. \"I told you that this is not my real body. I am a monster. I will destroy you. I'll understand if you want to leave.\" And Eros is sad. He is miserable and terrified and he is the most splendid creature Dionysus has ever seen, and Dionysus knows that he does not like the way Eros cries. \"I am here. Allow me to devour you.\" The real monster here, Dionysus feels, is himself.",

    "text": "A spy's life is never stable. Unless you have a team of people you know in and out, you can never be sure of what to expect from anyone you meet. Fi, Sam and I met Alexander, our client, at Carlito's. Sam had his usual beers and Fi was drinking tonic water. Meanwhile, I was watching Alexander fidgeting around in his chair. \"There's a guy after me,\" Alexander said. He had a thick Greek accent. \"He's going to kill me this year. I used to be a Spartan.\" \"You mean, like Michigan State?\" Sam interrupted. \"I'm from Michigan...\" \"No, an actual Spartan. I was a priest of Ares. I was supposed to sacrifice a youth years ago.\" Fi gave me a wide-eyed look. I think she was telling me she thought Alexander was crazy. \"How long ago?\" I asked. Alexander's story was bizarre, but one of our clients believed there were aliens on Earth. An actual Spartan priest wasn't too far off from our alien-believing client. Or so I thought. Alexander paused. \"Over 1000 years ago? I think. It's been so long. Ares needed a sacrifice for a Spartan war against Macedon. It's the area where Macedonia is now. He wanted a boy who he thought was a coward sacrificed. I let him go and sacrificed a pig instead. Ares wasn't pleased. Sparta lost against Macedon. But Ares still wasn't satisfied. He wanted me to sacrifice that youth to appease him. I refused. Then he wanted any youth to replace that youth when that youth grew into manhood in Athens. He's been keeping me alive ever since.\" I couldn't believe what I was hearing, but I went along with it anyway. \"You're staying with Fi until this Ares thing blows over.\" Fi's jaw dropped. \"She's the best driver out of all of us. If Ares shows up, she'll be able to outrun him.\" \"You don't understand,\" Alexander said. \"Ares is a god. You can't go up to him and expect to live. We need something else, like another god or some force of nature. I was hoping you'd all help me call one here.\" \"We can handle a god,\" I said, still not believing that the god Ares was going to enter in our lives. But he did. The Ares thing made Fi punch me several times in the ribs after it was over. This is the reason why. Fi was setting out a bed for Alexander when she heard a car pull up at her apartment. Fi looked out the window. The man was getting out of a Ford Mustang with flames painted on the sides. He was wearing a black shirt with a yellow shield on it and jeans. \"I have a question,\" Fi asked Alexander. \"Does your Ares wear what appears to be a soccer jersey these days?\" \"Yeah. He wears a soccer jersey bearing his image on it. Well, an image of him as a sculpture. He's that vain.\" That's how Fi and Alexander stumbled upon Ares, Greek god of war who likes wearing soccer jerseys bearing his image on it. \"How do you feel about islands?\" \"I've got no problem with islands.\" \"I'm going to take you to one.\" Fi took Alexander's hand. The two ran out the back of her apartment and slid into her car. Ares heard her speed off in her car and followed her. In Greek mythology Ares was an easy character to outwit. That is, if you were a god or a demigod. But even if you're a mortal, you can always your knowledge of your home terrain to your advantage. That's what Fi did--she led Ares on a chase up and down the streets of Miami. Ares ended up stopping his car somewhere in the middle of Biscayne Boulevard. Of course, everyone in that part of Biscayne Boulevard, including Fi, was confused when Ares' car disappeared from the middle of the street without notice. Fi called me from our island hideout. \"Michael, we have a problem.\" \"Yeah?\" \"I chased Ares around Miami until he gave up.\" \"You're joking.\" \"No, I'm not joking. We're actually living among the gods. Or at least one angry Greek one.\" \"I don't know what to do, Fi.\" \"You'd better come up with something soon. And bring Sam. I'd like to live another 40 years or so and preferably without an angry god on my tail.\" And then it came to me. But I needed to pick up a few things first. Fi gave me a panicked look when we all met at our island hideout. We had an enclosed space in the hideout where we could block out most of the light if we needed to. Not only was could we hide Alexander in the space, we could lure and trap Ares in it as well. I was carrying grocery bags with the stuff we needed to defeat Ares. Sam was carrying a smoke machine with the liquid it needed to fog up our space. \"Michael, I said 'bring Sam,' not 'go to Jo-Ann's.'\" \"I've got a way to stop Ares and prevent him from killing Alexander and you.\" \"I'm guessing you've turned into a god.\" \"No, I'm not a god. But I need you to pretend to be a god.\" \"Wait, what?\" \"Did you study Greek mythology in Ireland, Fi?\" Fi sighed. \"Of course. You think we only study bombs, soccer and math over there?\" \"Who was the one goddess who was able to hurt Ares enough to make him retreat in battle?\" \"The goddess you're making up right now?\" \"I'm serious.\" \"Oh, all right. I'm guessing you mean Athena.\" I nodded. \"No, Michael. I'm not playing Athena in front of a god.\" She pointed at her eyes. \"Have you not seen these before? Do they look grey to you?\" \"I know. I have a way to get over that.\" \"At least now I know I won't be recreating a rave with Sam. There wouldn't be any alcohol left if we were having one.\" Sam pointed at Fi. \"Hey...\" Depending on who you talk to, summoning a god requires a complex ritual. That ritual varies from person to person. It might be saying a prayer or giving something in tribute, like wine or a sacrifice of some sort. Of course, you would want the sacrifice to legal by today's standards. Alexander told us that Athena required a human sacrifice. Even if the quickest solution was \"sacrifice a human to bring a god to earth,\" a human sacrifice was out of the cards. The next best thing to summoning a god is to become a god. When you don't live in a world where you're either born with superpowers or you're given the superpowers, you have to fake having these superpowers and hope they fool a god. Place a couple of dim white LED lights on a pair of goggles and they can simulate the effect of glowing grey eyes. They're also more comfortable and convenient than putting on glow in the dark contacts. And unlike uncomfortable contacts or sunglasses, the goggles will allow you to fight in hand to hand combat. If you don't have a spear and a shield, a switchblade knife taped around a piece of metal pipe and a solid hubcap taped around your arm will do. A ski mask doesn't require papier-mache and time like a lot of cheap Greek helmet replicas. And a smoke machine can hide everything you can't hide in near darkness. After that, you can only hope that the god is too stupid to see through your ruse. While we waited for the smoke to fill the hideout on the island, I taped the hubcap to Fi's arms. Fi didn't like the hubcap. She stomped on my right foot. I ended up soaking it in ice when this job was done. Sam made the makeshift spear for Fi. He gave it to her when he was done. \"Remind me not to bump into you in a dark alley dressed like this.\" \"Don't worry, Sam. I won't.\" I walked over to Alexander. \"I need you to help me lure Ares in the hideout.\" \"This isn't going to work, Michael.\" \"It's worth a try. Can you go outside for me and stand until Ares gets here?\" Alexander nodded. Alexander was one of the few clients we ever had that listened to us instead of running away from the situation or trying to take matters into his old hands. Then again, he was so scared of his god destroying him. I don't think he had it in him to run away or rebel. When Alexander saw Ares, he ran into our hideout and hid behind some crates. Sam and I were already hiding behind the crates. Sam pulled him down and I gagged him with my hand. Ares walked into the hideout. He saw Fi dressed as our idea of Athena. \"Hello, dog-fly. We meet again.\" He bought it. \"You ready to get your ass kicked again?\" \"I'll win this time. The spirit of war shall triumph.\" \"You can't win a war if you don't know how.\" Ares charged at Fi. But Fi was able to knock Ares out with the hubcap. Then she stabbed Ares upwards in his shoulder, tearing through his beloved soccer jersey, and his upper thigh. Ares howled in pain. He was bleeding ichor, the gold blood of the Greek gods. It was shining through the hideout. \"You know what I want you to do? I want you to leave Alexander alone. I don't know why you need a sacrifice for a war held years ago. But it's over. There's always a war somewhere. Go look for another war. \" \"Damn you!\" Ares hobbled to his car. Both of them disappeared in thin air. Alexander stood up after Ares left. \"Am I really free?\" \"Yes, you're free,\" I said. \"What's going to happen to me now?\" I shook my head. \"I don't know. But you're free of Ares now, thanks to three mortals.\" A couple of days later, there was an obituary in the Miami Chronicle for Alexander. He was able to die in his sleep thanks to Ares' curse being lifted. His years of suffering for saving a sacrifice were over. There are some things a spy will never be able to explain to civilians. Missions gone wrong, deaths in the field and other strange occurrences are going to fly over the heads of most people. After the Alexander job, I ended up taking Fi to my mom's house so I could spray WD-40 on her arm to remove the duct tape. My mom heard me spraying the WD-40 and Fi yelling various obscenities to me in her garage. \"Michael, what the hell is going on?\" She walked into the garage and froze at the sight of Fi and me. \"It's a long, crazy story, Ma.\"",

    "text": "It has taken years but Hermione is finally ticking off a huge item on her bucket list. She's bought a house in a little village near where she grew up. While the house itself is neither large nor ostentatious, it does have one glorious feature: a library. Hermione's new library has high windows and floor-to-ceiling bookshelves, all open and freshly polished, longing to be occupied. She sits in a cosy chair that she's just Transfigured, countless boxes of books piled all over the floor, and lets her mind wander, trying to decide how best to organise her collection, dreaming of future days spent curled up in here, sipping a glass of French wine, losing herself in new worlds and brilliant ideas. A plainly wrapped package sits by her feet and she picks it up. It had arrived while she was eating dinner and she'd nearly forgotten about it. Sturdy brown paper with neat corners and heavily penned lettering make her smile. Her favourite pen pal. A well-worn collection of myths from around the world peeks up at her and she smiles. He's always had the best taste. She cracks open the leather binding and sees a note nestled between the cover and the first page. Dear Hermione, Welcome home. I hope you are enjoying your library. Here is an old favourite of mind for you to add to your shelves. I cannot wait to see them myself. Yours Always, Viktor He's coming back to England. Ostensibly, he's moving here for work--he's part of a team that is rewriting the International Quidditch Rulebook. Hermione can't be sure, but she thinks there's more to his relocation than a new job. Or perhaps she just hopes... In the past year, their letters have become more frequent and more intimate. Hermione tells Viktor everything, even things she's not comfortable sharing with her closest friends. They've started meeting up for dinner once every few months, usually choosing somewhere in the middle--Paris, Zagreb, Milan. Although their meetings are technically as friends, Hermione feels the slow shift. There are hints of something hiding behind his dark, serious eyes, though she can't quite be sure. His smiles appear more often now, brighter, wider, happier. She can't be imagining the electric charge that courses through her whenever his hand innocently brushes against hers. She bites her lip and takes a deep breath. He's due to arrive in London in just two days' time and then she'll be able to get to the bottom of this. She's waited years--what are a few more days? For now, all she can do is relax in her library, enjoy her wine, and read her new book.",

    "text": "\"Okay, is everybody here?\" A frumpy middle-aged man in a sky-blue dress shirt stood on a small platform in front of a small crowd of his employees. Through his horn rimmed glasses, he looked across the room where they were all held. Everyone, except him, were in clad in shorts, sneakers and the same bright yellow t-shirts with the company logo emblazoned on the front and the words '2014 Indoor Inter-Office Olympics' in the back. The words in the back were in all-caps and in comic sans, a design choice that could have only been made by committee. \"I said, is everybody here?\" There was a murmur of general approval in the crowd, some shifting of feet and the sound of a few conversations being cut short as their boss asked for their attention. \"I think Jeff's still changing, Mr. Pierce,\" one human woman replied. \"Yeah, I think I saw him just coming out of the locker rooms,\" added one of the satyrs, adjusting his shorts to ride just under his short tuft of a tail. The door behind the crowd swung open. Jeff strode in the room, his hoofs clopping noisily on the titled floor of the room, still trying to cover his belly with a shirt that was a little too small for him. \"Sorry guys,\" he stammered, \"I got one of the last shirts, and my horns kept getting stuck.\" The frumpy middle-aged man sighed and silently rolled his eyes a little, and reassessed the situation. \"Okay, now that everyone is here, I'm going to hand the reins over -- no offense, Deeds, (A centaur near the middle of the crowd whinnied noncommittally.) -- to the team leaders of this group, while I go back to the office and get some work done before the next week's audit.\" Mr. Pierce walked off to a side door and disappeared from the crowd's view, while another satyr and a female cyclops, clad in tee-shirts and shorts like the rest of the staff, took to the stage from either side, almost leaping to meet in the center with a high-five. \"Hey guys!\" announced the cyclops. \"We're your team leaders today, and in this leg of the IntelleCorp's 2014 Indoor Inter-Office Olympics, we're playing--\" \"-- LAZER TAG!\" finished the satyr, placing an extra emphasis on the \"Z\" so as not to confuse anyone between this and the less extreme version of the sport spelled with just the letter \"S.\" The crowd of employees in front of them stared. The satyr continued. \"Uh...just so you know, the format of the game is Red versus Blue, and the team with the most points at the end of three rounds gets a Poppa Paolo's Pizza pizza party on the company, alcoholic drinks included!\" The crowd murmured with general approval. Nothing motivates a room of twenty-somethings like company-sponsored booze and pizza. \"And remember: the person with the highest total point tally at the end of the entire game wins a PS4! You each have been assigned to teams in the packet you got earlier this morning, and the corresponding exits lead to your team's changing rooms. You've all got a few minutes to suit up for the first round. Let's get excited y'all, this is going to be fun!\" finished the cyclops with a fervor. The crowd started to move towards the doors that would lead in their respective teams. \"All right, remember the rules...\" drifted the voice of the cyclops. In the hubbub of people moving about, Jeff the Minotaur could only think back to his childhood days of playing tag in the alleyways of his home city and the weekends of laser-tag with his high-school buddies, just like this. It was something he just knew he was good at that didn't involve sitting awkwardly at a desk two sizes too small for him, punching numbers into cells on a keyboard that his slightly larger hands couldn't really handle. He would finally be in his element. He walked through the exits, and donned the familiar padded vests (created to simulate knock-back where the lasers 'hit' you) and wrapped his fingers around the chunky plastic rifles with the grip of an expert marksman. A timer on the wall counted down until the arena was open for the first round, and instructions to keep behind a certain yellow line before said counter counted down were placed just underneath it. The other employees and the staff of the UltraZone Lazer Tag Arena were already milling about near the entrance to the arena, either helping people get fitted in similar laser tag gear or directing them to the starting zone. \"The first round will start in thirty seconds,\" rang the referee over the PA system, just barely audible against the dubstep echoing in the arena. People were lining up for the round, but only Jeff was in a runner's starting position behind the yellow line. Like the professional all-minotaur laser-tag teams he idolized throughout his life, he tensed the muscles around his hocks in anticipation of the game. \"...three! Two! One! ENGAGE!\" ------ \"Okay. Run this by me again, kid: one minotaur did all of this...all by himself?!\" The screens were flashing the CCTV feeds of the past hour and a half, where it was almost possible to see a large, furry blur weave past people in varying degrees of shock and confusion and disappointment. Every time a screen flashed, a new angle depicting similar scenes played, while a counter on a different screen kept track of a number that rose with every flash. An employee of the UltraZone Lazer Tag Arena at the control console tried to search his mind for an answer while the simulated carnage played on nine different screens in front of him. \"I don't know, sir, but I do know that he scored the most out of both teams by a landslide. And he only got hit once when took on a squad of five people from the opposite team!\" \"That's amazing! What's his name?\" \"According to the records, Jeff Rushbull, sir,\" he stuttered as he pushed a few buttons on the console to enlarge the scoreboard. \"As soon as I saw the footage myself, I thought I would call you and show you how he did. He even out paced some of our regulars.\" Atop the table of numbers, Jeff's name sat on the very top. The scores underneath his numbered in the dozens or so, but only Jeff's cracked triple digits. The light from the screens reflected against the mirrored sunglasses resting on a wrinkled old face. He leaned in and kept watching Jeff pick off people from a vantage point. He's seen scores and moves like that before, but only in some of the better minor leagues teams, maybe some of the major leagues. He's never seen someone this good since...since that day he found the Ironhoof brothers. His old skin contorted into a grin. The man leaned back into his chair as he continued to watch Jeff flank his opponents. \"Well kiddo, you've witnessed something great today.\" \"What, sir?\" His grin widened. \"The beginnings of a legend.\"",

    "text": "He's been waiting in Chinatown for what seems forever. Of course the god of fucking sunshine has no concept of punctuality, he doesn't know why he still shows up in time, after all these years. Apollo turns the corner just as the sun dunks red behind the skyscrapers, as though he were afraid of his namesake. Which wouldn't be all that surprising, really - he does the weirdest shit for the sake of his penniless artist cred. \"Sorry,\" he breathes, looking impossibly gorgeous in the red-gold light dust. \"Artemis was taking forever in the shower. You know my sister.\" Hermes winces. He's always followed Aphrodite's advice when it comes to the twins - don't dig too deep; you wouldn't like what you'd find. \"I didn't ask,\" he mumbles, trying to sound annoyed. Which is useless, in any case: it's impossible to stay mad at Apollo for more than five minutes. Apollo beams, throwing his head back in laugher. \"Aw, don't be grouchy, Herm. How 'bout some dim sum? I'll buy your forgiveness.\" Hermes nods wordlessly, slanting a look at Apollo while he isn't looking. Sometimes he can't think why he still answers his calls, why he doesn't untag himself from all the Facebook photos from the twins' Saturday night parties and disappear into the woodwork. Lack of self-preservation instinct, probably. It does run in the family. \"Sure,\" he gives up, shoving his hands into his pockets. \"Lead the way.\" + The thing about Apollo is that he's not someone you can pin down. Except for his morning routine - getting up at the crack of dawn to hop back to Olympus and take his chariot stroll with Ra - there's no way to tell where he'll be at any given moment, what - or who - he'll be doing; it's just as likely that he's roaming the dingy art galleries in the West End than that he's squirreled his way into an Upper East Side brunch and is chatting up socialites over mimosas. Once he disappeared for five days only to be found sitting at the very back row of a Wicked performance, which he'd apparently been watching for twenty times straight. Artemis probably knows the secrets to deciphering him, but if she does there's no getting them out of her - at best her relationship with Apollo is scary co-dependency, and at worst she's lugging plates at him and locking him out of their apartment for weeks on end. She does like Hermes, in the sort of absent-minded way she reserves for anyone not her own sex; sometimes he gets the impression she pities him slightly, thinks of him as that poor sucker taken in by her brother's charms. Which, to be fair, isn't really that far off. Truth be told, there was no resisting him. Like all the gods his generation, Hermes spent his childhood mostly on mount Etna, which at the time looked a bit like a communal nursery. He was ten when Apollo decided to adopt him as his best friend, and even if he hadn't wanted to, he would have been bound to spend enough time with him to become more than acquaintances, what with his job lugging messages back and forth between all the Olympus VIPs. Which, Hermes hopes Zeus never discovers Twitter, otherwise he's going to become superfluous real quick. Not that he would mind a little bit more free time, but he actually likes his job. Go figure. So Apollo - Apollo's there, and Hermes comes when he calls and sure, it's pathetic, but it's what it is. Sometimes when he gets drunk and prophetic Apollo sprawls on Hermes's ratty couch and he dangles his fingers on the edge of Hermes's jaw, and Hermes holds his breath, waiting for something that never comes. \"You're a good friend,\" Apollo sometimes tells him, slurring and smelling of vodka - and then it's back to business, and Hermes gets his notebook out from under the cushions and jots down Apollo's inscrutable mumblings to pass out to Pythia, the beggar lady on Fifth. + This isn't going to end well. in fact, there is a 90% chance that this is going to end up spectacularly wrong. Hermes isn't sure what possessed him to agree to go out to a club with Apollo; maybe it was his friends and siblings, crowding Apollo like a halo, urging him on, and maybe it was Apollo himself, his crooked grin and the enthralling smell of his cologne. Or maybe it was Hermes's poor decision-making. He did keep the secret about Aphrodite and Mars for nearly a year, after all, and look how that ended. So now he's in The Lethe, the most sulfurous club Eros, Aphrodite's seventeen-year-old son, could find; the music is pounding and everything around him is glitter and stroboscopic lights. From the corner of his eye Hermes spies athena dancing with a boy he recognizes as Odysseus, one of the students in the law course she teaches at NYU, to whom she's taken a shine; a girl with dark eyes is watching them from the bar, sucking on a pink drink with a ridiculous umbrella. Behind the bar Ismene is working steadily, keeping her head down, the light making her more beautiful than she is. Hermes wonders what kind of trouble her sister is in this time - Ismene is always taking odd jobs to bail her out of jail, try and keep her away from the countless protests Antigone breaks her voice in, since their uncle cut them off. Hermes likes those girls, especially Antigone; the rumors of the trouble she gets into inevitably reach him and he sometimes visit her in their crappy apartment in Hoboken, despite the sun and the sour smell of failure. She makes eggs and Bloody Marys and laughs and he sometimes wishes he could be in love with her, instead. It would be trouble, but he was always destined to fall in love with trouble, his mother used to tell him that - you're too quiet not to. At least it wouldn't be Apollo. A hand touches his elbow and he whirls around, convinced for some reason that Antigone is going to be the one he's looking at in the half-darkness. He sucks in breath when he finds Apollo instead. \"Hey,\" Apollo says, his eyes dark. \"Where've you been?\" He's not asking about geography, but Hermes ignores it. He shrugs. \"Couldn't find someone pretty enough?\" he asks with a half-hearted leer. It's protocol on night like those; Apollo slides near some pretty girl or boy and sets a hand on their shoulder, offers them a drink or a dance, though sometimes a grin would have done the trick; and Hermes watches as their pupils melt and expand and they recline into Apollo's embrace, ready to be swallowed up. Hermes would pity them, but he's pretty sure he would be the exact same given half a chance. \"Nah,\" Apollo says. his throat is golden, glistening with sweat, and Hermes can't take his eyes away. \"I wanted to dance with you.\" No thank you is what Hermes should say - would say, if he were in his right mind and hadn't had one beer too many before starting on the shots. He would invent some excuse and make his way to the bathroom, rest his back against the door, take a breath, splash some water on his face. Instead he just inclines his head and it means yes, of course it means yes, and Apollo takes his hand, skin burning like he's absorbed the heat of everybody in the room, plasters himself against Hermes, too close. The music is easy to move to, some modern pop garble about dancing 'til you drop. Hermes would do just that, if it wasn't Apollo pressed against him, breathing in his neck. When Apollo kisses him he isn't really surprised; he yields obediently, opens his mouth under Apollo's and ignores the odd feeling in his chest, like heartburn. Besides, with the light shimmering all around them he can almost pretend it's a dream, one of his aunt Persephone's gentler drug-induced trips, lighted to the tune of the black underground sun. + New York burns with early morning light and Hermes blinks, his mind suddenly full of all the messages he's ever passed - declarations of war, confessions of love, inane requests and shopping lists, and Apollo's fucking sibylline revelations. Pythia always smiles at him when she gets them, like she understands what Apollo's saying - the same look he's seen on Athena after Zeus talks to her, a soldier look, I'll do what you want me to do. But she's mortal. How could she understand - how could she understand, and not him? He's still drunk - the cold wind hits him and he staggers, looking out into the bustling street. Life never stops here in the Big Apple; that's why they chose it to live, because they never stop either. They don't sleep. They eat, sometimes, when they remember to: but what they really need to do is live, live the thousand lives that are what makes gods, what builds them up into divinities. Hermes stumbles forward, lips still seared with Apollo's kiss. He really should get used to it. An old lady sitting on a bench darts a look at him, scandalized and maybe a little worried. Hermes wonders what he looks like, still in clubbing gear, his lips branded and red, hair messed up. How human. He takes a deep breath, counting in his head. Tomorrow he'll go back to Olympus, gather up his next round of messages. he'll talk to Aphrodite - she'll know what to do. And now... now there's no time to worry. He takes a step forward. The old lady's gasp when he steps into traffic, into the relentless ocean of lights and noises, is faint but clearly audible. Hermes turns around to smile at her. Don't worry, he mouths just before a truck hurls its headlights against his side, gods never die.",

    "text": "A long time ago, when mermaids were as real as you, one mermaid wished to be human, to experience the joy of walking, running, dancing and making love. Her father, the great ruler of the seas and oceans, could not grant her that wish- he just didn't have such a power. One person though- or, I should say, a witch mermaid- did. Most of the people would say that she was evil and ugly but she was far more beautiful than you'd ever imagine with her flowing black hair and glittering green eyes. The Little Mermaid asked the witch to change her, if possible. The witch did and The Little Mermaid became a lovely pale blonde- blonde so pale it looked like sea foam- with big cerulean eyes and perky breasts and hourglass figuring. The Little Mermaid gave herself a name- Thetis- and on the shore she met a handsome fisherman, his hair brown and merry, eyes deep, warm, chocolate brown. They talked for a long time, since the sky turned pink when the sun rose to the orange when the sun set. Thetis was enamored with the man- Peleus- very much. When they finally kissed, Thetis felt a tide of passion and lust wash over her, pull her under. In his strong arms, she lost herself. Peleus layed Thetis down on the warm sand and trailed his hands over her body, caressing and memorizing the feel of her smooth, tanned skin. Thetis was trembling and moaning when his warm mouth kissed her nether lips the same way he kissed her mouth. Her slim fingers were tangled in his hair, trying to pull him closer,to feel more. She moaned his name when his fingers entered her thight cavern, her back arching in ecstasy. Thetis chanted his name over and over, nearly screaming when the orgasm hit her. Peleus pulled up over her sweat covered body, kissing as he went, then kissed her and let her taste herself on his lips. Peleus entered her pussy and her breathing hitched when he started to move inside of her, his dick hard and warm and it felt oh-so-good. Peleus stared into her eyes as he moved, building a steady rhythm. Their moans echoed on the shore, sand stuck to their skin. He quickened his thrusting when Thetis clenched around him, her orgasm making her thoughts disappear, before freezing above her and grunting as he spilled himself inside of her. Peleus collapsed and quickly rolled off of her, gathering Thetis in his arms. She placed her hand on his rapidly beating heart and sighed as she stared at the sea. She had to come back to the salty waters and swim- her tail long and the same color as the sea weed. The moment Peleus fell asleep, Thetis rose on her elbow and gazed down at his smiling face. She pressed a gentle kiss to his lips and brow before rising and walking towards the water. She walked until she was neck-deep in the slightly cold waters and closed her eyes as the magic turned her back into her true form. She swished her tail and turned to look at Peleus one last time. Her eyes widened as he smiled at her sadly and mouthed 'I love you'. Thetis waved and blew him a kiss. That was the first and only time they have ever seen each other. Thetis died three hundred years after, turning to sea foam. Peleus, a long time before her, walked into the deep sea- mad with heartbreak- and drowned, wanting to meet his love again.",

    "text": "She came to be in a dark and harsh realm. She pushed and kicked herself out of the bowels of the earth. Around her everything was harsh, cold and dark. She spit and stood on shaky legs and started walking. She stumbled about, tearing her skin open on the rocks of the ground. She fell often and every time she pushed herself up. She didn't know what she was looking for in the perpetual darkness of her realm, but deep down she knew she couldn't - wouldn't stop until she found it. After falling down a deep slope peppered with sharp rocks, she stayed down for a while, crying softly. She pushed herself up once again. Everything hurt, but she had to find...The first thing she noticed was the change in smell. For the first time her nose got a scent and it was warm and inviting. Then came sound, very faint at first, but growing louder with each step. And suddenly she saw something in her dark realm. Two long and dark shadows cut on the already dark and shadowy world. Between the long things hung something. For a moment she was scared and didn't dare take another step. From behind the hanging something came the smell and noise. She licked her lips and started walking once again, her curiosity winning over her fear. The hanging thing was soft against her hand. She wanted nothing more than put it around her aching body. There was a sort of sense of doom on the back of her head, but she wanted the sounds and smells. She pushed the soft thing aside and was assaulted by something white that hit her squarely in the eyes. She stumbled back, covering her eyes, a pitiful sound escaping her lips. After a few minutes the white thing stopped hurting so badly and she could see. She was in a large room with soft floors and a roof hiding the sky from her. There were other creatures, standing on two and four legs, breathing and looking at her with big eyes. They were gathered in groups, looking at her with mouths agape. She swallowed a lump in her throat and took a few steps closer to the gathered group. The sense of doom in the back of her head was now accompanied with a sense of happiness, for she had been looking for these creatures since her birth. The creatures started making noises she didn't understand, moving quickly from one place to another. A small roundish creature stepped towards her. He touched his chest and said with deep rumbling voice and a bright smile on his red face \"Bor\". She smiled back and out of her mouth came her first word and her name \"Gaia\".Other creatures stepped closer. A tall female with dark skin and even darker hair, sparkling eyes and a beautiful smile willed with shining white teeth put her hand on Gaia's shoulder. The next thing she knew is, she understood all the creatures around her. The female - woman - was called Vac and she caressed her head before making room so that others could approach her. \"We are gods\", one of them explained. \"And we have been waiting for you\". They took her to a long thing standing on four legs - a table - and sat her on another, smaller thing - chair. A small fat man with bright red face called Bacco presented her with a glass of red liquid called wine. It was hot and cold at the same time and sent a tingling sensation down her aching limbs. She kissed Bacco's head in thanks and the man walked away very satisfied for, if Vac's gift of speech had been her first present, the glass of wine would be for ever her second. Soon after other gods came to her with presents.One covered her in war skins, another gave her cotton flowers that turned into soft skirts around her legs, another came by with meat to fill her stomach, another with juicy fruits that were sweet and sour and made her happy. A thin, sad-looking man washed her feed in a basin, smiling back at her with his sad eyes. It was nice to sit in a warm place for the first time, surrounded by friends and as one of the gods gave her music, another gave her sleep and she had still to decide which was better.",

    "text": "Eris pouted at her reflection in her mirror; by the Fates she looked good, how in Hades was mischief himself ever going to resist her? She thought. She finished admiring her reflection and walked over to the casting circle she had drawn on the marble flooring. It was becoming a bit of a habit, these conjugal visits. Not that they had a schedule worked out, that would be too organised and structured for them. Eris just appeared whenever she was bored which was becoming a more frequent occurrence. Eris stepped into the circle's center; she closed her eyes and raised her outward. Softly she began chanting her transportation spell. She felt her world melt away for a moment only to be replaced by another. - She opened her eyes to greet her lover. \"Did you miss me darl-?\" She stopped dead, any thoughts of a quick shag completely evaporated. Loki's face was slick with tears and sweat, his skin was blotched. His expression was warped by anger and pain. \"What are you doing here?\" he snarled. Eris stared at him in shock. His intense glare pierced through her. \"Well...\" he viciously prompted. \"I came to see you.\" She told him, there was no way she was going to let him speak to her like this regardless of what had happened. \"Oh, that's why!\" he exclaimed. He eyes widened in mockery. \"Well, you've seen me now. And I am afraid I do not feel scratch that itch for you right now!\" \"Clearly.\" She muttered. Loki stared at her in disgusted disbelief. \"Can I ask what has turned you into this?\" Eris gestured at him. Loki laughed manically. \"Oh, everything my love! Everything!\" Eris felt a stab of despair as she looked at him. \"Tell me, Loki.\" He laughed. \"Why?\" he cocked his head, \"you come here for a shag, not to share feelings.\" This hurt more that Eris thought it would have. \"Loki-,\" she began. \"Just leave!\" He screamed, picking up a chair in his left hand, he hurdled it at her. Quickly Eris threw up a force field and the chair harmlessly bounced off it and that was when she noticed it. All the blood, splattered and smeared across the white floor. \"What the in Hades have you done!?\" she exclaimed, her anger quickly overcoming her original fear and shock she marched forward and seized Loki's right wrist. She inspected it, the blood seemed to be coming from a gash in his hand. Without hesitating she tore a strip from her dress and wrapped around the cut and held it in place. She looked up at him. \"Why?\" He looked at her, he moved his lip, silently trying to form words. \"Loki.\" She murmured, gently touching his face with her free hand. \"Why?\" He looked down at her, her worry was clear on her face which only served to make his feel worse. He should have, could have done something. He remembered the last words he had spoken to Frigga and he felt sick to his stomach. Loki reached his arms around Eris and crushed her against him, he just wanted someone to hold, some physical contact to try and make him feel whole again. He felt Eris's slender arms wrap around him. He let out a sob and buried his face in her hair, breathing in the scent of her musky perfume between sobs. He feet soon give out from under him and the two of them sank to the floor, clutching each other. - Eris didn't know how long they had been there, sat there clutching each other as Loki sobbed. Her limbs began to ache and cramp and Loki seemed to have stopped sobbing. She leaned back; Loki loosened his embrace to let her do so but not letting go of her entirely. She reached out and lifted his chin off his chest, cradling his face in her hands. He looked at her, his puffy, red rimmed eyes, no longer seemed wild and crazed, now they just looked full of pain. His right hand curled around hers and he looked into her eyes, ignoring the stabbing in his hand he entwined his fingers through hers. \"Eris,\" He murmured. Eris stayed silent, waiting for him to carry on. He sighed. \"I will break free from this place.\" He was talking more to himself than to her. \"I know.\" She said softly. \"I will not be a prisoner,\" his voice became louder and more confident. She noted to determined edge in his words so she leaned forward and asked. \"How?\" Loki smiled a humorless smile. \"Here is chaos incarnate asking me if I have a plan. It's enough to make anyone laugh.\" His words lacked the seductive edge they normally did and instead they just hurt. \"You are such as mewling quib, sometimes. It makes me pity you.\" Eris untangled her fingers from his. \"Sometimes chaos needs to know what its doing in order to achieve it.\" She leaned back on her hand and something sharp drive its way into her hand. \"Ouch!\" she exclaimed. She looked at her hand, a large sliver of glass stuck out from the palm of her hand. She looked behind her to see the remains of some elaborate glass ordainment. She remembered the cut on Loki's hand. As she pulled the glass shard out of her hand she asked him. \"Was that how you did it?\" Loki didn't reply. \"Your hand?\" she said gently, repeating herself as if he didn't hear or understand her. \"Was that how you cut it?\" \"I believe you should be out growing some more of your shiny apples.\" He told her. \"You should clean it up before you hurt yourself more seriously.\" She told him bitterly. She knew he'd done it to himself deliberately and it had her feel sick to the stomach. \"Yes I should, shouldn't I?\" He looked at her flatly. \"You can leave now, consider your conscience clean. If you have one that is.\" \"Do try and not injure yourself again, it may make it harder to escape that way.\" She rose to her feet, carefully avoiding the glass. \"Since you're not going to be a prisoner anymore.\" Loki didn't move, he stayed there, his shoulders slumped forward as he stared into nothingness. She couldn't help him if he wouldn't let her and she wasn't going to be his punchbag. \"I wish you all the best in your little endeavours.\" She told his before she closed her eyes and chanted the spell. - As soon as Eris felt herself return to her home she slumped into the nearest chair. She wasn't going to stay where was clearly wasn't wanted. She wasn't going to sit there and be insulted and by the Fates she was not going to watch the sadist injure himself to make him feel better. Or that what she told herself. She caught a glimpse of herself in her mirror, the reflection she had previously thought was the image of beauty was crumpled, ruined and smeared in Loki's blood. She turned away from it in disgust. She shouldn't have left Loki in that state, no matter what he bile he was spewing at her, no matter how many pieces of furniture he threw at her. He shouldn't have been left alone. But she couldn't go back, she physically wouldn't. Maybe it was her pride, vanity or whatever else they could call it, she wasn't going back. Loki would just have to cope. She smiled bitterly to herself. She never did find out what had happened. - Loki leaned back against the wall of his cell and sighed. He had successfully managed to push her away, just like he had done with his mother. He wondered why he kept doing it, but he was too mentally exhausted to ponder it. He had lost the two women in his left he probably cared about the most within a short few hours. He looked at the makeshift bandage Eris had tied around his cut and kissed it. She did care for him, despite the facade she always wore. And now it was over, he was sure she'd never return now. Which was good in one way. He stretched out his legs. He felt a shard of glass cut his foot. He didn't even flinch. It occurred to him that he hadn't told Eris what had happened, would it have really made any difference? Would her pitying him have made everything better?",

    "text": "Hades sat quietly, back against the ridge throne and legs stretched out in front of him as he waited. Demeter had requested to see her daughter and while it was his season, so here he sat alone while Persephone had gone to grant that request. \"Do not look so ill tempered, Hades.\" Amusement colored Persephone's voice as she entered the throne room. He didn't answer for a moment, instead just taking her in. Her black cloak was speckled with snow, as was her blonde hair that glittered more than showed it, and her normally pale skin blossomed with a rosey color from the chill of the winter air up top. \"I spend enough time without you, Persephone, I do not like having to do so when it's my season.\" A soft tsking sound slipped from her, though she brushed off his mood as easy as the frozen water that continued to try and cling to her. \"She merely wanted to give me something.\" Slipping up to their thrones, Persephone ignored her own in favor of settling in Hades' lap. It's automatic that his arms slip around her, making sure she won't fall from where she's perched but also to draw her closer. \"And what did she need to give you?\" He didn't wait for an answer from her though before his mouth found her chilled one and he stole the taste of winter off her lips. Persephone's hand slipped along his cheek as she kissed him back with a soft sound. \"Patience, my Lord. You will see in time.\" She nipped at his lip, chuckling softly at the soft rumbled growl from him for her answer. Pulling back, she slipped from his lap and settled on her knees in front of him. \"You've wanted me here, have you not?\" The darkening of his eyes gives his answer away before he says anything. \"And were it any other day, I would let you stay down there.\" Standing, he drew her up gently before pushing her to sit back on his throne, his cloak resting against the stone to help keep the chill from her skin. He dropped to his knees and pushed her legs apart gently. \"I want to be here today.\" Wiggling, Persephone parted her legs and tugged her dress up for him. \"Here in the throne room, my Lord?\" Her question is breathy with anticipation and her hand slipped down to curl in his hair. \"Here in the throne room, my Queen.\" He dipped, tongue sliding along her slowly as he savored the taste with a smile. No more words are needed though, as he gets to work worshiping her slowly. Every little sound she makes as her fingers tighten in his hair encourage him to work her faster, tongue plunging into her to drive her pleasure higher as she bucks between his unrelenting mouth and the unyielding throne under her. It's only when she's right on the edge, close to tipping into climax that he pulls his head up and earns a soft whine. \"Hades...\" Hades licked his lips and offered a smirk to her, hands opening his pants and pulling himself out. He strokes himself a couple times just for show, loving the way she shudders at the sight of him hard and curved for her. \"Patience, my Queen.\" Eyes darken as he offered the words back to her and she opened her mouth to answer him, but he didn't give her much time to say anything. Standing, he pulled her up and out of the throne gently before he settled into it himself. Lips curled, she moved and straddled his lap, though her movements were jerky from the pleasure she's been stopped from having. \"You owe me, husband,\" she whispered as she kissed him. Hands on her hips, he pulled her down onto him fast and sank into her in one go while he kissed her back. \"Then take your pleasure, Persephone.\" Crying out, Persephone arched as her body stretched to accommodate him. \"Hades.\" The word was panted as she rolled her hips before she raises herself to start a fast pace. She didn't want to wait, no, he made her wait long enough and she can tell from the way he followed her pace he won't be far behind her. Hades arched to give her the pace she seeked and pushed it just a little faster, something about the way she sounded pushed his pleasure higher without much help, and coupled with her body quivering around him now, he knew he wouldn't take long. His hands slid up her back, hugging her to him some as he kissed her deeply. \"Let me hear you,\" he murmured against her lips as his hips rocked up sharply. Nails dug into Hade's shoulder as Persephone followed his command, crying out again, louder, as her body locked around him and white hot pleasure coursed through her veins. Her body didn't stop moving though, she continued to buck down on him, continued to take each thrust as he pushed her pleasure higher and sought his own. One hand supported her as he continued to piston into her. Sometimes they were able to cum closer together, but he'd brought her to the edge already when he hadn't been given pleasure to get there with her so it took more this time. Finally, as her voice grew hoarse from pleasure, he pulled her hips down tightly against his own as he gave one last thrust. The cry from his throat was more roar as he filled her with his seed, hands keeping her body tight to him. Slumped after he's done, Persephone rested her head on his shoulder as little aftershocks wracked her body. \"Maybe I should make you worship me... before every admittance to my body...\" \"I would be a happy husband to be allowed that, my love,\" he murmured quietly into her hair. Currently, he had no interest in moving, though truthfully, he wasn't sure his legs would hold himself, let alone allow him to carry her back to their rooms. So for the moment, he just enjoyed the feel of her body burrowed against his, and the way she still occasionally tightened around his softened cock as it rested inside her.",

      "Currently, he had no interest in moving, though truthfully, he wasn't sure his legs would hold himself, let alone allow him to carry her back to their rooms.",
      "So for the moment, he just enjoyed the feel of her body burrowed against his, and the way she still occasionally tightened around his softened cock as it rested inside her."

    "text": "She's such a lovely scared little thing. Barely a woman, almost a child still, with thin white arms and small white hands, and innocent blue eyes so wide with awe and fear. Her unripe breast rises in quick, shallow breaths, like she's afraid that if she stops breathing for just a moment, then she'll stop forever, and this time no one will be there to save her. Good old Thanatos - mortals are just so obsessed with him, aren't they? He thanks him silently. She clings to life so beautifully, his little Iphigenia with her eyes so big and blue and bright with this desperate, hungry light. In truth, he expects fear and a maiden's shame from her, maybe even disgust, a struggle - all those things that make a hunt worth it, at least until he gets a flute instead of the soft, pliant flesh of a nymph - as he grips her slim shoulders and pushes her down and rips her pretty dress from her graceful, pale body. Instead, he only gets the gratitude she owes her god, her saviour. He kisses her small, pink mouth, and she immediately gives in under his tongue and teeth, so inexperienced and frail that he could break her with just a touch. She lays down quietly and spreads her legs wide, grits her teeth and shuts her eyes close as he enters her roughly and his fingers search for her small breasts and pinch and tease her nipples until she bites her lip. She tries not to let any noise escape her mouth - she's the daughter of a king, so proud and strong, even if that very king was the one who vowed to kill her - and so she swallows every little cry down, chokes on every tiny moan stuck in her throat. But he can feel her smooth legs trembling as they brush the coarse hair on his, can feel her short nails digging into his back and the slick warmth of her flesh clenching around him, and he can see the long dishevelled locks of dark gold dancing on her shoulders as her back arches begging silently for more. He can see little drops of red and white on her thighs when he lets her rise to her feet, pain and confusion grazing the delicate lines of her face under the calm composure she's trying so hard to maintain. She thanks him, her shoulders shaking lightly, and he smiles as he promises he will always be there to save her.",

    "text": "She's the new bride, consecrated for her husband's use. All her expectations -- of being made ready, dressed and decorated, of observing pious rites and going into her husband's house -- are cast into confusion when her husband's house is wherever his procession ceases. Her bridal chamber is made of more flowers than she can name, her attendants are barefoot dusty maenads with gentle hands and wreaths of thorn-stripped roses. Nectar and milk flow freely, and the wedding dances are wild. A rite of love, love from all comers, love without faithlessness, love without bonds, love without bounds. Dionysus catches her up in the middle of the dance, matching her pace and cleaving close against the lines of her body, minding the unsteady placement of her feet. He bears her up when she nearly swoons from the unfamiliar strength of the song -- the blood rhythm of strange voices, walled in by arms and hands, and the whirl of circling dancers. She recovers her footing by kissing him, kissing his wide wine-red mouth, and a cheer goes up from the barefoot maenads. Looking out among them she sees old women and young, dark and fair, even some who could be her unhappy sisters. All are beautiful, transfigured by strange ecstasies into women of the woods -- bloody-kneed, ungirdled. Here and there are satyrs, too awestruck by their leader to be menacing; some have love-mad maidens hanging around their necks, or wreathing them with flowers. Something surges from her, pours from her in good will; she looks out at the throng and sees friendly faces. Her bridegroom's face is lit with love, lovelier than any man. It's not pity that shines from his eyes, but a sort of mercy that transforms everything it touches. The crowd parts for his passing, and he lies down beneath her amid the throng, with a fawn skin and a purple robe folded up for his couch, and with perfect clarity she slips in close atop him, brushes a stray red-gold curl from his brow only to tousle loose three more such knotted locks. She leans down to kiss him, uncertain in her movements and self-conscious of her peplos falling loose. He lifts his hips against her, sleek like a dancer. \"If you'd like,\" he says, and she knows what she would like. The god is at once soft beneath her hands and a creature all muscles and sinews, fully flesh and fully real. All the dishonesty of mortal men has been winnowed away. He kisses her hair where it's fallen loose from her wedding crown, catching a snaky loop of it and pressing it in his fingers against her shoulders. \"Perfect,\" he says, \"lovely,\" and in his saying them the words lose the sting of previous falsehoods. He stirs under her and she straightens her spine, already overbrimming, electrified. She shuts her eyes and still sees the colors pressed against her fragile eyelids -- green wreaths, golden flesh, wine-dark cloth. Opening them again she sees with vision more fitting to an immortal queen than a dazzled girl. She is wreathed in the girl-soft arms of a boy who adores her and that's enough. Against the purple field of cloth he is entirely golden from head to foot, Dionysus smells like twisted grape-stems and the torn bark of trees, but he's a real creature -- with a stray freckle in the bow of his lips and a straight flaring nose and more eyelashes than she's ever seen on a man. Kissing him -- in the ebb of bodies around them, their neighbors trailing hands over to bless their union -- is a lovely thing. She wants to look him in the face when he's inside her. He fits into her well, the first flicker of pain giving way to pleasure; there's a pleasant soreness as he moves in her and she sinks down to draw him deeper. The god's supple fingers are on her waist, his mouth against her throat, another mouth moving at her bare breast from beneath and a bearded chin scratching at her ankle. Vine-branches are heaped around them, she twists off the leaves in her fingers and can smell the bright burst of scent even among some dozen bodies, perfumed by the earth. Girls and women kiss the wine from her lips; satyrs stroke the god's thighs, rendered pacific by his proximity, now all warm and snug and half-exhausted. Ariadne is cast adrift among adoring bodies and she has never felt more at home. Nothing is being taken from her, nothing is bargained away or lost.",

    "text": "This is the story you think you know. Only I am here, naturally, to dispel the myth. But the myth is old and you have heard it countless times, for centuries many have repeated the words of the master, so why would you believe me, now? After all... their story adds up. Except think back to your own life, does everything that has ever happened make perfect sense? Were there no coincidences? No accidents? No mistakes? But that is too vague, you say. Very well, it is Achilles I speak of, the one born of a goddess and promised great glory by prophecy. The story goes that Achilles loved his childhood companion, and that much I will not deny. Patroclus was his name and Achilles loved him better than any man, woman or god. But back in Greece not even gods were perfect and Achilles was no god. He loved one thing more than his beloved, and that was his fame. One might not want to fault him for this, as his own name was to be paid for in the young blood of his veins, spilled too soon and for a purpose not his own in the battlefields of Troy. A choice, yes, but what is a choice between death real and death imagined? Dead the limbs or dead the spirit, is it truly difficult to imagine a young man with dreams of glory choosing the one over the other? Achilles heart beats no more, but his name is on my lips and known to all, so who can say the price he paid was too dear? Of course, the second name on my lips is Patroclus, and you might think Patroclus was but what Achilles felt for him. But it is Patroclus who asks Achilles to return to the Troyan battlefield and aid their fellow Greeks and Patroclus to whom Achilles promised anything but that. His word given Patroclus subsequent request was to be granted, to be sure. Patroclus asked for Achilles armour and the reputation he could not put to use himself for fear of destroying. But, I say, is not even a hero allowed to change his mind? After all, the first request was the one favoured by the one doing the asking, if Achilles could not bear to send that one so dear to what was to be clearly his end. The man in the armour, despite showing unparalleled skill, died after hard battle at the hands of the Troyan Prince and heir, Hector, said to be Achilles only competition in the battlefield. Naturally, Hector could kill Patroclus, but, it is forgotten, that before it ever crossed any mind that he could break Achilles' soul, it was Achilles all he was hoped to destroy. The man left behind puts on new armour and faces this warrior wearing the bloodied one, taken from the corpse of his beloved. He fights with such hatred, he pursues with such bloodthirstiness that brave Hector cowers, knowing his fate sealed the moment he is in range of the sword of the soul whose blood he wears. The man is confronted by the god of the river, who favours his enemy, and despite all reason and fairness it is the man who is victorious over the god. They say the man is half god himself but it is not his flesh but his heart that beats strong the blood that rages for revenge at any cost. Many say it is only the gods that feel that deep but you and I, human ourselves, know better than to believe. Hector knows his fate and sees the hand that will end it all, he uses his tongue once more to ask for piety for his soul. The man refuses this and all, as he would refuse his very existence were it possible at all. Hector falls to never rise, but the journey is not over for his body, to become in his killer's hand a brush for his blood to paint the grounds of his domains. I put it to you, imagine now: All your world destroyed, gone the one who understands even when you do not understand yourself that you are worthy of your very great name. And imagine too, the kind of love it takes for a person to see beyond not only so enormous a name but also the inevitable pride of a man who knows himself to be great; I ask you, which love is best? Which love sees no rest? Well, it is both, I say! Patroclus asks for the armour and Achilles gives himself instead, dons the metal forged for him, charges the enemies, but leaves his heart behind. Uncertain of the righteousness of his quest and so, for all his skill, in the end, when faced with determined Hector, Achilles sword rings false. It is only Patroclus left behind, no hero to aid the Greeks. Patroclus only, heartbroken with guilt. And it is then, too late for peace, that bitter Thethis comes to him. Dresses him in her son's fame, gives him armour worthy of the man to be made immortal in death. Patroclus buries the body that is more his than the flesh of his steps, dons the clothes and cries bitterly over his own name. It is him, after all, who is left. The time for hesitation is gone, for there is nothing to lose. The once prince knows little of battle but has watched his hero with the fascination of a lover, his eyes have traced the clenching of each muscle, the flight of every spear, his own hands disappear in the desperate reach of his soul for the one most dear. And now, more gods than one perhaps aid him. But with his lover's killer dead, Patroclus discovers that to his torment there is no end. He is to set all of Troy afire, he confronts Apollo, chances are dire, and little does he care. The world itself ceased to be the very instant Achilles was last to see. The god begotten arrow flies swift and finds flesh, a heel, they say, but if the flesh is human could it not be anything else as well? You know the rest, the body falling, the poison running through the hero's veins. It is truly such a stretch to tell you that the hero is already dead?",

    "text": "\"See, I told you that bringing women on the ship was a bad idea!\" The captain sighed, running his hands over his face. \"It's murder we're talking about here. There must be another way.\" \"If there was another way, do you think I would be talking about this? I'm talking about my wife here. But you know the folklore; they bring bad luck. And everything that's happened...the first day out, Michael died on a routine round and then just yesterday Henry died of food poisoning. And have you seen those storm clouds coming? We need to get rid of them all, now.\" The captain's second-in-command, James Worley, stopped talking and put his hands together, seemingly begging God for mercy. \"If you think we don't have another choice, James, then I believe you. We will... put the women to rest tomorrow morning. Oh, and James?\" The captain gave him a hard stare. \"Make sure none of the ladies know about this. That could cost us more lives. But tonight, when they're all sleeping, bind their legs together and... put a sack over each head. There are some sacks left from the potatoes we finished off a few nights ago.\" James could only nod solemnly. The next morning, everyone was up on the deck, many with tears in their eyes. The six women were crying, with the potato sacks over their heads. Some were calling out to their loved ones to save them. James heard one voice incredibly loudly; his wife's. He had gotten absolutely no sleep the previous night, knowing that the next day he would murder his own wife. He had to physically resist the urge to rush over to her, tear off the potato sack and hold her tight. One woman wouldn't hurt, right? Even as he thought this, he knew he could never endanger the rest of the crew for one woman. There were more women where she came from, right? \"J-James, p-p-please! James, don't d-do this!\" There she was. His beautiful, amazing Renee. He knew he wouldn't be able to resist much longer. \"We need to do this now, boys! Say your prayers quickly, because the storms a-brewin' and we need these ladies in the water before it hits!\" James yelled over the women's terrified moaning and the wind that seemed to echo them. \"You heard 'im! Into the water!\" The captain screamed, trying (and failing) to keep his face emotionless. Six men, all unrelated to the women, lifted them up, while the women were flailing around, and dropped them into the sea. \"Now, boys, we must pray for the six forsaken souls, and also for Henry and Michael. Dear God, please accept into your arms...\" The women, as they sunk down, held their breaths as long as they could. They wanted to scream, to curse their husbands and fathers and every person on that ship. There could have been another way; there must have been another way. One by one, they couldn't hold their breath any longer. As they sucked in the salt-water, their throats stung and they only had one thought on their mind, as if they were thinking in unison: Revenge. Revenge. Revenge. Suddenly, Renee felt air rush into her lungs. She looked around at all the other women to make sure they were having the same experience; it wasn't just a near-death hallucination. The other women- Janelle, Amelia, Sarah, Hannah, and Grace- looked back at her with just as wide of eyes as her own. She tried speaking, \"Are... Are we dead? This doesn't feel or look what I imagined heaven would be...\" Her voice was raspy and deeper than before due to, she assumed, the salt water she breathed in. She looked at the rest of their faces, but they didn't seem to be looking at her face. They seemed...they seemed to be looking at her legs and then back to their own. She looked at their legs and realized why. Where their legs had previously been bound together by rope were... fish tails. \"Why us?\" Grace asked, flicking her green tail around nervously. \"Why did God choose to save us and turn us into... sirens?\" They all had deeper voices than before. \"Isn't it obvious?\" Hannah retorted. \"He wants us to avenge all of those women shit sailors like the ones on the boat throw overboard.\" Her new tail, which was silver with hints of green, sparkled in the sunshine that hit the water. They had all been experimenting with their new-found anatomy, but now they were back to business. \"Well, I agree that we should get revenge somehow, but the question is how could we do it? How could we make them pay?\" Amelia piped up. She was only 19, the youngest of them all, and she swished her golden tail, which complemented her red hair, around angrily. \"Wait a second, girls.\" Renee exclaimed, \"I have an idea. I was looking at my husband's maps and saw a shallow but very rocky and dangerous area about 5 miles ahead along the route that the ship was taking. What if, somehow, we could lure the boat over to the rocky area; then the ship will sink, killing everyone on board. It's a pretty frequent trade route, too. We can show those men how it feels to drown, to feel terror as deep as our own. Except no one will be there to save them.\" Renee finished triumphantly, her dark blue tail reflecting her mood. \"But... but how do we lure them? Over to the rocky shore, that is?\" Sarah, the quietest of them all, had a pale, peach-colored tail. \"I don't think talking will work. I mean, our voices won't carry that far. Maybe we could try singing. Like we did to entertain the sailors at supper. Maybe that will stand out...\" She trailed off and the rest of the girls looked at her in stunned silence. Then they exclaimed, almost as one: \"PERFECT!\" Swimming, after getting used to their tails, went quite a bit faster than that blasted ship could have ever gone. They reached the bay with over a half hour to spare, passing the ship en route. \"How can we make sure they hear us?\" Amelia asked, looking around. \"Oh, look!\" She pointed excitedly to a rock emerging from the surface. \"We can all fit on there. Come on girls!\" They quickly climbed up (they could still breath out of the water as well), and waited for their prey to arrive. James looked out to sea, still wiping tears from his eyes. She's in a better place, he told himself. Almost like magic, the storm they had seen earlier went in a different direction, saving them from the fate his wife and the 5 others had met. He shook himself and moved away from the edge, telling himself that he was second-in-command and, as second-in-command, he had work to do. \"Hey, Frank,\" he yelled up to the helmsman, \"be careful! We're coming up to the bay with all of the rocks.\" \"Will do, James. Just hang in there, okay?\" Frank was one of the lucky ones. He didn't lose one of his loved ones. James was lucky too, in a way. Nathan, the Quartermaster, lost both his wife, Hannah, and his daughter Amelia. \"You... you betcha. Thanks Frank.\" He was about to go down to the hull, but then he heard something. It sounded like Renee. Stop it James. You're hallucinating. Now the bay was almost directly next to them. She's singing? Why is she singing? Is this normal? Wait... are there more voices? It seemed he wasn't hallucinating. Either that, or the whole crew was hallucinating too. Frank was the only one sane enough to keep at the wheel, but it seemed that even he wanted to get closer to the source of the singing. No one thought to question him. As they got closer, the words became clearer. The voices, while still definitely the women's voices, were deeper and raspier, as if they had swallowed the salt water and it dissolved into their vocal chords. Many sailors were physically resisting the urge to jump over the edge of the ship as the words rushed over them. \"This way, O turn your bows; Achaia's glory; As all the world allows; Moor and be merry Sweet couple aires we sing; No lonely seafarer; Holds clear of entering; Our green mirror.\" Coming around the corner, they saw six figures sitting on a rock. They looked identical to the women they had thrown into the water, except these women had fish tails. James saw the siren version of his wife, and he couldn't help but scream out, \"RENEE!\" She looked at him, and he didn't see any of that sweet, loving kindness in her anymore. All of it was replaced by malice, malevolence, and what looked like an urge for revenge. He snapped out of the spell, but not before he heard a sickening CRACK as the boat hit the deadly rocks. The other men, however, were still engrossed. So, he was the only one to hear the women cackling to themselves as he sunk to the sea floor, getting scraped and poked and stabbed by the rocks on the way down. All of the other men, it seemed, got it easy. They were dying happy, in love with the music. Wait. No. That wasn't true. He saw four others trying to get a grip and swim up. They were the men whose wives and daughters were tossed into the sea. Their final revenge was James' last thought as he gagged on the saltwater and slipped into blessed unconsciousness. He could still hear the women laughing above the surface.",

    "text": "She stripped bare to race him. He'd known she would, had seen her let her linen gown fall, disregarding Timon's hopeful gaze and availing herself of the athlete's privilege of nudity. She'd barely had to walk to beat Timon, who went to his death with his eyes still full of her glory. Melanion was hardly in a better state, his mind recalling every rosy curve, when he begged a boon from Aphrodite. The next day, apples tucked underneath his cloak, he issued his challenge, and a thousand pitying smiles answered him while Atalanta's raised eyebrow questioned his sincerity. * For speed, he could not match her. But no one dared say he had not won, not when the apples he had cast as temptation had been divinely sanctioned. * Atalanta was no blushing bride. She was naked - contemptuously naked, somehow - when he entered her chamber. She had not prepared herself with oils and perfumes, as he had, but the scent of her was still intoxicating to him. He breathed deep, belatedly realizing that her skin was cool, unflushed, unaroused. He'd wanted her rosy as the dawn. But this was what he got. Perhaps this was what he deserved. \"Curious,\" she said, and her voice was unpracticed, a low rumbling sweetness that had never been trained to propriety, \"that you were able to cast the golden apples away, when everyone else who has seen them has succumbed to greed for them.\" He stayed silent, lingering still by the door; she had not invited him closer. \"Well?\" she asked. \"Have you no words, no charms, but this wondrous fruit?\" \"Lady,\" he said, \"I asked for a boon to win your love, and did not question what I was granted.\" \"Have it back again,\" she cried, and threw, with all the strength and skill of a huntress, one of the apples at his chest. He felt like dough under a baker's fist. \"My love is not yours after all.\" \"No,\" he agreed, rubbing the bruising skin, \"only your body and your name and your very life.\" \"You could not best my body without a trick in our race,\" she said, her fists clenching at her sides. Her hands, he saw, were calloused from years of archery, and her thighs were the color of honey. \"Truly, I have never seen beauty like you before. When you ran, you were lovelier even than Pegasus in full flight -\" \"You make mock of me, the bear-child. I am but an animal to you, to be broken and tamed.\" \"No!\" he insisted, dismayed. He had forgotten her history, that she'd been left to die as a babe on an unforgiving mountain. How had she ever brought herself to forgive her father? \"I wanted only to stand before you and sing your praises.\" She shrugged one shoulder, still hurt, and turned away. \"I have no wish to hear your song.\" The apple she'd thrown at him had shattered against the floor. He stepped over the shards and took up a second one; stuffing it in his mouth, gagging himself, he waited. Still, she did not move, and her spine was eloquent. He crossed his wrists in further humility, and her head turned to verify the gesture. Atalanta was imbued with grace, so light were her footfalls against the cold floor. She stood in front of him for uncounted moments, then lifted a hand to free the second apple. It, too, splintered when she threw it to one side. \"Speak, husband, or touch,\" she said, like a naiad whose voice bubbled up like a brook. He had no words. He stretched his hand out instead, letting his fingertips rest at the indentation of her waist. He stopped his mouth against her grass-scented skin, and felt her grow warm against him. Or was that him, his own blood rising and singing with joy of her, at the tremble of her chin as he raised his head from her breast to take her sweet mouth? Was it her hand or his that first clutched fervently, her teeth or his that first bit down on a plump lip? Clutching each other, they weaved their way to the bed. He tossed the last apple away and fell back on the blankets, pulling her down on top of him.",

    "text": "The door swung open, creaking on its hinges. \"Aidon?\" He didn't have to turn around to know who it was. Aidoneus' intuition told him who had been making her way up the steps, and who would be standing there in their antechamber. That, and these were their private rooms. \"Does something require my attention downstairs?\" His stylus scratched across a scroll of papyrus, writing a missive to Hermes, or Mercury, as he preferred to be called these days. He clenched his jaw at the thought of that, betraying his distaste at how rapidly things were changing. It was a different Olympus when he'd visited at midsummer. Persephone sat down at the opposite end of the divan. \"A mortal crossed the Styx...\" The point of the stylus came to a stop and he sighed. \"Damnation, Charon...\" he said under his breath. \"You'd think that after he ferried those two idiots across last time, he would have learned. But every hero has a story to tell and coin for passage, it seems.\" He started writing again. \"She's waiting in the throne room.\" Hades dropped the reed in the ink pot and raised his eyebrows, giving his wife his full attention. \"She?\" \"Her name is Psyche. She says Venus sent her.\" \"For what?\" \"That's... what I need to ask you about.\" She settled in the seat and crossed her legs. Aidon glanced briefly at her exposed ankle and then looked back at her questioning eyes. \"Why, pray tell, husband, would Aphrodite think that there is a box of beauty that I keep at my bedside?\" He thought for a moment. Aidon sat up a little straighter when it dawned on him, then pursed his lips sheepishly. \"No reason.\" She smirked, his fib obvious, and scooted closer to him on the divan. \"At midsummer when you were talking to her, you... wouldn't have happened to have said something like that, hmm? And had her take you seriously?\" \"...Maybe.\" The corner of his mouth twitched up. \"Hades Aidoneus!\" Persephone tried to stifle a laugh and look serious again, ultimately failing when she saw the mischievous sparkle in his eyes. \"What?\" he said in mock innocence. \"It was the only way to stop her from pestering me!\" The dam burst and Persephone doubled over laughing. \"Aidon, please tell me,\" she managed through her mirth, \"what would possess you to tell a tale like that?!\" He sighed and pulled her close to him with one arm, chuckling low. \"Aphrodite approached me uninvited while you were talking with your mother, and asked me how it was that I was able to find such a pretty wife.\" \"What did you say?\" \"That I abducted you,\" he growled. \"Did you say it like that?\" \"Likely. I was too irritated to care.\" Persephone shook her head. \"And she still didn't leave you alone?\" \"No. She kept hovering around me like a gnat. Then she had the gall to ask if we, after a millennium and a half of marriage are still... intimate.\" Persephone giggled as his cheeks reddened. \"Well, I didn't think it was funny...\" he mumbled. \"So I told her politely to shove off. Then she tossed out some back-handed compliment about how surprised she was that you could stay so beautiful whilst having to live in a place like this...\" She shook her head again, then leaned against Aidon's shoulder. \"I may have gotten more offended by that than I should have, and... may have made something up.\" \"That I keep a 'box of beauty' at my bedside?\" \"I didn't think she'd be stupid enough to believe it,\" he said incredulously. \"You said...\" She laughed, cupping her hand over her mouth and fruitlessly trying to muffle it. She was afraid Psyche could hear them all the way downstairs. \"At my bedside...\" she guffawed, wiping a tear from her eye. \"In an ebony box!\" \"Oh no, don't tell me...\" \"Yes!\" Persephone blurted out. His answering laugh rumbled beside her ear. \"This poor mortal girl is here to retrieve it, isn't she?\" \"Yes!\" she managed, another tear leaking out her eye and her face turning red. He pulled her close and leaned his forehead down, their noses pressed together, both still laughing too hard to manage a kiss. When their shared laughter finally subsided, Aidon took swift advantage of the moment, his lips capturing hers as he pulled her into his embrace. She melted, her hand caressing his shoulder and sliding up until her fingers looped around her favorite stray curl at the nape of his neck. \"You really are cruel, Aidoneus,\" she said when she finally pulled away, her pupils wide. She brushed her hand over his cheek. \"Sometimes,\" he said wickedly, \"but everyone above says that anyway, no?\" \"What do you suggest we do about this?\" \"Well, we have to give her something...\" \"...or Venus will punish her. And if we send her on her way with an empty box,\" she thought aloud, \"that will ensure her demise.\" \"Inevitable though it is,\" he muttered. Mortals lives were brief, the folly of youth briefer still. \"Why is this Psyche running errands to the Underworld for Aphrodite?\" \"Eros.\" Hades jaw clenched momentarily, remembering the golden arrow and all the trouble it had caused early in their marriage. \"Who did he make her fall in love with such that she would be forced to strike a bargain with the self-proclaimed Goddess of Love?\" \"Eros.\" His eyes widened. \"She fell in love with the son of...\" \"It was the other way around, actually,\" she said, resting her chin in her hand. \"She told me that he married her in secret. And his mother just couldn't give him up. Especially to a girl whose beauty, mortals say, rivals her own.\" Aidoneus thought grimly about his own everlasting trouble with Demeter. He shook his head. This girl was willing to descend amongst the dead, traveling between realms on foot to prove herself, and it was his fault. \"What about that jewelry box I carved for you?\" \"I love that box, Aidon; it comes with me every time I go back above,\" she said with a slight whine. Hearing her own voice clearly, Persephone grimaced. What was a trinket compared to this poor girl's life? \"I suppose that would work, much as I'd hate to give it up.\" \"I have a feeling it will find its way back to you.\" \"And what shall we put in it?\" \"Nothing that can satisfy Aphrodite, I fear.\" Aidon chewed on his lip for a moment. \"Hypnos' poppies.\" \"And that will put to sleep whoever opens the box.\" She knew as well as he from their sad experience with Orpheus that humans always succumbed to temptation. \"Eros will miss her long before Aphrodite does,\" Aidoneus said. \"And her loving and valiant husband,\" she said, squeezing his hand playfully, \"will find her before his mother can exact a deadly punishment on his beloved wife for failing to bring her the fabled vessel...\" \"...thus saving her life,\" he finished triumphantly. Persephone nodded, pleased. She stood and placed her hands on her hips, looking down at Aidon. \"Just one more thing, husband.\" \"What would that be?\" \"You're going to be the one to get my jewelry box back,\" she said. He sighed and lolled his head back, staring up at the ceiling. \"Fates, wife, I would rather carve you a new one out of solid diamond than have to deal with Aphrodite again!\" She said nothing. Persephone folded her arms and cocked her head to the side. Aidoneus stood up, looming over her, his lips curving up into a smile. He threw an arm around her and kissed her head. \"Alright, my love. I will.\" \"Thank you,\" she said softly. He gave her a small squeeze, then offered his arm. \"Well, my queen. Shall we go downstairs and tell poor Psyche that we will do as she requests and give her your box of beauty?\" She placed her hand in the crook of her husband's arm. \"A fine idea, my lord.\"",

    "text": "Iphigenia For the longest time she insisted to her mother and sisters that she hated the war. Every war but especially this war. Her mother tried to soothe her first, brushing her hair at night while Iphigenia watched her distorted yellow reflection in the bronze. Later Klytaimnestra was angry, pulling at the braids cruelly, snapping at her insolent daughter she should be proud to have a father so valiant and strong, and an uncle so fierce who loved her father so. But she knew Menelaos did not love her father. He had always hated his brother, and he had always hated his wife, and he had always hated the Trojans, and he had always hated peace. What she hated, she told herself silently at night, massaging her scalp to soothe the pain her mother had inflicted on her, was men who mistook hate for love. Even worse, those who mistook cruelty for honour. Her father was the more valiant of the two, but also the more capable. She hoped he would not forget his family, so far away, in such a different land. When word arrived that she was to help the Achaians by marrying Achilleus, she felt conflicted. From what she knew of the skilled warrior, he could well be exactly like her uncle; a dumb brute who did not know for what to live and therefore followed an uninspected path carved by tradition. Yet she went. Because she trusted her father. Her head hurt. Agamemnoon When she was a child he had often put his hands on her neck when she was restless. The pressure of his heavy fingers on her pulse made her relax and sleep. She was a thinking child; he often found it slightly improper for a girl, but somehow in spite of himself he liked her seriousness, the way she could come to him late at night and ask him questions that he himself had never before considered. He understood little of her but he knew she was a treasure. He was a father and a fighter at at last he could no longer prevent the two from meeting. So here he was, with his hands on his daughter's blushing neck again, again, for the last time an act that she had always read as kindness. He had to harden now, conflate his routinely bloodstained killing hands with his secretly tender parenting ones, and push at her pulse point, which was so weak, so easy to break. He had to make her loving words falter to a panicked pleading spitting, watch her radiant eyes turn dark with a deep knowledge of him, of his utter betrayal that could not be washed away by his tears that fell onto her open-mouthed face. The o of her lips that described her shock and, worse, her I knew it. She tore her bridal chiton clawing at his hands, went tense and then with an almost watery sigh went limp, as she had so often before, drifting off to sleep under the same-different hands. As she burned and the winds picked up, cruelly, softly, like laughter, his confused hands plucked at his body like birds, like they didn't know whose they were anymore. Klytaimnestra The house held its breath. The flames in the hearth were stifled and choked into obedient embers that flared up now and then. The gauzes in the doorways didn't flutter, never, not once, almost marble-like with Elektra's equally frozen outline on the other side, curved like a question mark. It was noon but the house was dark. Klytaimnestra felt fear and hatred fighting for a place in her throat, and she was both moved and enraged by the way her stupid, silent daughter managed to make her question a plan years in the making, a plan approved by all laws of men if not by the gods themselves. Just by standing there in the doorway, not uttering a word into the growing stillness of the air around them. She was still a mother despite the hole left by Iphigenia, which could only be filled by revenge, white-hot and murderous, and she sensed the question mark growing stronger. The growing confusion of her normally so windswept daughter, who liked chitons that bounced as she ran and secretly unbraided her hair to feel it against her cheeks. Who even as a child slept the most soundly in a storm. When Elektra eventually slipped past the lank curtain into the clamminess, the growing darkness around Klytaimnestra, her hair was lank on her head and there was water on her cheeks, although she could not know. Orestes hung to her sweaty hand like a puppet. When their mother opened her mouth to speak she found she had no air left in her lungs to say anything at all, and she could only wait for the heavy footsteps of her husband returning, which would bring the winds. Orestes Sometime he felt like two people. At day, wandering the island that changed every day under his feet and the winds, he felt almost shocked, like the small child he was when he was brought here, bloodstained in a way that would never wash off. Barefoot, with hardened heels and heart, he sought tall rocks and stood on them, stretching his body, young, lean, to the heavens and tried to not feel pliable anymore. To create a body of bronze with a heart of quicksand. At day, sun-baked, he burned for revenge. At night he felt soft, exposed, blurred at the edges. He sought his sisters' hands to hold in his dreams but found nothing, only a strange stillness, a clammy space. He cried for his mother in his sleep. It was impossible for him to want to kill his mother by day yet want her to hold him at night. To dispel his growing sense of doubleness he tried to stop sleeping. When sleep did claim him, as sleep like a sneaking thief unchangeably does, his dreams were of his family's bodies smothering him in excessive love; his mother pressing him to her breast like an infant, his sisters tearing out their hair and letting it fall on him like grim feathers. They screamed at their mother. Hot tears falling onto his closed eyelids. That's when he knew that in his dreams, he was his father's corpse. And that's when he knew he was ready. Elektra There is nothing more bitter than being left alone. Under the trees, which she has always loved, she hates everything, especially how an honourable life is elusive. And how nothing is believed that is true, and how everything of beauty is cut down. The bark cuts into her back. The sky overhead wheels on, indifferent.",

    "text": "Her vows come to her a mind as her husband holds her hand and pushes it under the soft, refined cloth to make her touch his chest - hers. Hers, now. Ianthe thinks of the smile on her father's face and the tears that filled Iphis' mother's eyes. She knew, just as Iphis always knew and told her nothing. Iphis' flesh is soft and smooth and Ianthe can feel her shivering where her fingertips caress her slowly, barely touching her. She looks up: the lines of Iphis' face are still as sharp and as handsome as she's always known them, her jaw strong and her brow high and her skin darkened by the Sun. Iphis' dark eyes won't meet her gaze, even as her long fingers clutch her hand firmly. They've held hands before - just quick stolen moments, after making sure no-one was watching. Ianthe would always think of her wedding day, of their fingers entwined and Iphis' slightly chapped lips pressing on hers. - I'll let you run away, if you wish. With a man you will be able to fall in love with - says her husband, startling her, her cold, distant voice breaking through the mist of memories and broken dreams. - It is the right thing to do. - Iphis' eyes are not really looking at her, veiled as they are with sorrow, or perhaps guilt. There was a time when those eyes looked at her with only love in their dark depths, love and devotion and a strange shyness Ianthe could never really understand. Those times are gone, it seems, and yet Ianthe can't help but still look back at her. - Why? - she asks, and she's surprised at how hoarse and tired her voice sounds. - Mares do not burn with love for mares - Iphis says. The thin smile on her treacherous husband's thin lips isn't even as sad as it ought to be, if it is true that she's ever loved her, behind all the lies and the disguises. She's already given up, she has just given up. Earlier that day, Ianthe's breast had burned with joy and with love, and she had almost choked on laughter and song. Now, it is pure fire that burns her, coiling in her stomach and coursing through her veins, piercing the back of her eyes with tears she won't shed and bursting in tiny sparks where her fingers still brush Iphis' breast. - I am no mare. - Iphis - her wife, it hits her now and she thinks of a maiden's old dreams and foolish hopes as she grips her flesh tight - takes a sharp intake of breath and finally, finally looks at her. She tries to say something, but her mouth opens and closes wordlessly as Ianthe's hand begins to move up and down, massaging her lightly, shy and determined. - Stop it. This is not right - she begs her. But Ianthe does not stop. - Was your heart true, if not your body? - she asks instead, her other hand rising to cup the nape of Iphis' neck, her fingers tangling in short, dark hair. For a moment, Iphis looks like she's about to push her away, but then she just closes her eyes and nods. - Is it still true? - And Ianthe doesn't even know what she's doing, because Iphis' perfume fills her nostrils and her own heartbeat pounds in her ear and she's confused and shaking, but she gets closer anyway, presses their bodies together. - Yes - is the only word that comes out of Iphis' mouth, in a sigh of both pain and pleasure. - Then, this is right. - Her wife's lips are softer than she expected, yielding so swiftly under the pressure of her own, and that's the first thing that truly feels right on this surprising wedding night of hers.",

    "text": "I heard the faint thrum of the arrow seconds before it reached the flesh of my body. I believed that my muscles would betray me again and move me from the path of the arrow; in defiance of my bleeding heart and bloodied soul, my body refused to let me die. My feet remained swift and my legs strong. I had grown accustomed to them working independent of my wishes. But I did not move. I turned my head toward the thrum, hardly daring to hope. I felt the sharp point of the arrow part the skin of my back. Thick muscle and slick bone greeted the shaft as it passed through my chest. My body spilled its blood in welcome, in tribute, like oil from an urn. I closed my eyes. Thank the gods, I thought. Finally. For the first time since I failed Patroclus, I felt something other than wild oscillations of rage and despair. I felt relief. As I fell forward, arrow through my heart, I smiled. My last thought was: Patroclus. I awoke in Elysium. I awoke in a nightmare. I could not find Patroclus. Darkness of the texture one finds in the depths of a cave or the bottom of the sea ran unbroken in all directions. My skill with a spear was useless, the grace of my former body laughable. The relief I had felt as my blood pooled onto hot dirt mocked me. I could not find him. Heroes wandered around me, through me, their souls idle with death. Heracles appeared in the swirling dark, and Perseus, fellow students of Chiron. I howled into the ether, a wounded animal. No one heard me. Patroclus. I repeated his name, over and over. Patroclus. Patroclus. Eternities passed and time stood still. Nothing held meaning, not in this thrice-cursed dark. Not without Patroclus. Alone, I raged. Where was he? He had promised to wait for me among the shades. For one shameful moment, I wondered if perhaps this was his punishment for me. I had refused to fight. I had chosen my pride, my hubris, over my love for him. I had sent him to his death. I had strapped him into the armor myself. Then I remembered how Patroclus' large, dark eyes had shone brighter than the hammered gold of my helm. The determined clench of his jaw. His rough hand gripping mine from the back of the chariot. I thought we had time, but that was no excuse. No. Patroclus was kind and loyal. He was not me. I could not imagine a world where he would abandon me. If he was not in the underworld, it was because he could not travel to the underworld. I raged anew. I felt cheated. Powerless. Empty. I knew I could not face death on my own, anymore than I could face life. I had not the strength. There had to be another way. As I quieted, I sat on the banks of the River Lethe and let my hand trail through oblivion. The river's black water was sluggish and brittle and so cold that fat disks of ice bobbed in the ebb and flow of the river's current. Perhaps this was our chance. If Patroclus could not come to me, I would go to him. I would drink the water of the River Lethe and be reincarnated. To drink the water of the River Lethe was to forget your past life, but I was certain that I would not forget Patroclus. If I knew nothing else, I knew that my soul would always know his. When I was born again, I would return to Troy. I would make sure our ashes rested together. I would make things right. I could do it. I knew I could do it. Besides, a timeless forever of waiting was beyond me. I sat on the river bank, my legs folded beneath me, my hand moving through the water. Years passed in aching darkness. I would find Patroclus. I swore it to myself. I would find him. There was nothing else. I shaped my hands into a loose bowl and let the river's water fill them. The water burned as it touched my lips, though I knew the burn was not real, for my lips were not real. I was a shade. I swallowed down the icy water, determined to start again. Immediately, golden light cleaved the air around me. The dark cracked in two, like an egg, and out of the void stepped a man. Shining brown hair fell in waves to his broad shoulders and brushed the top of the bow slung across his chest. The man had smooth, golden skin. Black eyes. A beauty so radiant it stole my breath. The depth of my desire was such that I believed, for one wild moment, that Patroclus had come to me. Then the man smiled, and in his smile I saw my mother. I saw a god. Everything I had wanted to be. A destroyer of lives. I let my phantom lips curl. This one would receive no deference from me. \"Apollo.\" Apollo's black eyes flattened and his smile turned stale, hard as old bread. My mother had taught me early that there were consequences to angering a god. I cared not. I had nothing left to lose. \"Why are you drinking from the Lethe, Pelides?\" Apollo asked. \"Are you missing something, perhaps?\" My hand grasped for a spear that was not there. \"You have brought this on yourself,\" Apollo said, off-handed, as if speaking to a slave or a child that he did not have time for. \"You burned my temples. You desecrated the body of my chosen. You go against me still. Your crimes cannot go unpunished.\" The light around Apollo increased steadily, like dawn breaking over the ocean. I had seen nothing but the dark for so long. I could not look away. \"Where is Patroclus?\" I demanded. Why was he not waiting amongst the shades? \"To learn that, you must speak with your kin.\" Apollo's light continued to grow. He was a terrible sight. \"Your mother and son would not have your monument dishonored with his name. That, however, is not my concern.\" I staggered back in the face of Apollo's revelation. Not Agamemnon, then. Not Menelaus, not Odysseus. The betrayal had come from my mother and my son. Apollo called them my kin, but they were not my kin. Patroclus was my only kin. My feet hit the river. \"I know what it is to lose a lover,\" Apollo said, his words falling from his beautiful lips like notes from a lyre. The lyre was the instrument of Apollo. To think, I had once believed my skill at playing would be enough to keep Patroclus at my side. \"I would not allow Hades to claim the soul of Hyacinth. I kept him for myself, because I would not be parted from him. That is to be your punishment. You will never forget. You will never be reborn. You will remain here, alone, without your philtatos, until the stars fall from the heavens.\" Panic coursed through me, chilling my blood to the same temperature as the river swirling around my ankles. No. I had to get to Patroclus. He needed me. Apollo could not trap me here. I would fight him. I lifted my hands and dropped into a crouch. Apollo smiled benevolently and lifted his hands, a shining reflection of my own stance. Then he flung his arms wide and the brilliant light that had been collecting around him burst in all directions. My back hit the water. The air rushed from my lungs, only to be replaced with frigid water. My ribs squeezed together like two hands crushing a beetle. My hands clawed for purchase, and my legs flicked like a dolphin's tail. I was powerless. I sank like a stone thrown into a still pond, the violence of my intrusion rippling out in every direction. I could not breathe. I was drowning. I felt myself hit the river bed and immediately gathered myself for a push to the surface, but I could not. The water above me was freezing now in cascading patterns of ice crystals that fanned across my field of vision. Then the ice reached my body, pressing hard against my eyes, my chest, my thighs. I could not see. I could not move. The light faded, but the ice remained. I waited for something, anything, to shift, but nothing did. I was trapped. I had never been one for thinking - of the two of us, Patroclus was the thoughtful one; he was my balance in that way - but once my shade was banished to the bottom of the River Lethe, I had nothing to do but think. Even if Patroclus made his way to the underworld, to Elysium, he would not find me. Apollo had made sure of it. I was the ghost of a ghost, and for the next infinity, all I did was think. And think. And think. And think. Patroclus. Time did not exist under the ice. I was always aware, always present; there was no before or after, only now. It was torture for one who had lived his entire life in service to a future he would never see. I was a fly trapped in amber, perfectly preserved in the moment of my imprisonment. That was why I did not realize something was changing until I was already moving. I heard great booms, reminiscent of the sounds siege stones made as they crashed into the walls of cities. The vibrations that followed flowed through me, rattling my shade within my tomb of ice. As soon as the booms died, I dismissed them. But the booms only grew louder. Louder and closer. Then, with one last, great vibration, the ice around me broke apart. I gasped as liquid touched my skin. Disoriented, I followed my instincts, which had always been excellent. I turned my body until the river bed was beneath my feet and pushed. I did not question. Movement. Oh, to move, even as a shade, was pure bliss. I wanted to laugh. I wanted to laugh the way I used to laugh. I swept my arms in front of me, careful not to scrape myself against the large chunks of ice still floating in the river. With steady movements, I dragged myself forward until my hand touched a surface that was not water. Worryingly, the surface also was not air. I kicked slowly, keeping myself in place as I felt along the strange surface. The River Lethe had acquired a ceiling, apparently. A ceiling made of...I scratch my fingers along the surface and felt something go under my nails. Dirt. There was dirt above me. I swam along the dirt ceiling, searching for a clear path out of the river. Nothing. I kept swimming and wished for Patroclus. He was clever, more so than I. I created problems, he solved them. He would know. But I did not have Patroclus, only myself. My heart was a hummingbird in my chest, fluttering madly, yearning for escape. Desperate, I decided to walk the only road available to me; rather than simply run my hands along the dirt ceiling, I thrust my fist deep into the soil and pulled. At first, the dirt simply rained into the water. Soon, though, I had torn enough of the dirt away to make an opening large enough for my head. For the first time in a very long time, I felt air. I breathed. Unsure of how much dirt lay above me, I started to climb. I wedge myself into the densely packed soil, my fingers seeking crevasses and pockets of air. I struggled and climbed, the dirt choking me, filling my mouth, nose, ears. As far as I climbed, there was only more dirt. That is, until there wasn't. With one last thrust of my hand, I broke through. I had reached the top. I hooked my hands into the soft soil, and hauled myself out of the ground and into another world. At first it was painful. I was surrounded by hideously bright light. Even closed, the brilliance pierced my eyes like daggers. This must have been Apollo's doing. My punishment began with his light. This felt the same. I clasped my hands tightly over my eyes. \"Apollo!\" I called the god's name, reckless. Calling on the gods was always reckless. \"Apollo!\" There was no answer. I forced myself into calm as I lay on the ground, palms pressed into my eyes. Adjust, I told myself. Let it come. I breathed. As I breathed, other sensations made themselves known. Warmth, for one. Actual warmth, as I had not felt since I last held Patroclus. He had been nothing but warmth. But also, there were smells. Sweet, green grass. Disturbed earth. And, wafting on the soft breeze that danced through the hair across my forehead, something gritty and harsh. Something I had never smelled before. When I could stand it, I opened my eyes. One glance confirmed that this was not Elysium. This was not the underworld at all. I saw tall, straight trees covered in needles swaying in the wind. A river, a true river, ran broad and tranquil to my left. I tilted my head to the sky and saw puffy white clouds wandering through a field of deep blue. With no little trepidation, I looked down. I was naked. I shook my head. Dirt flew in all directions as my hair whipped around my head. I lifted my hands. I touched myself: my cheeks, my shoulders, my belly. My feet. I placed a finger against my neck and felt the blood pulsing underneath like a war drum. I had sprung fully formed from the earth like Athena from the head of Zeus. I lived again. I was also confused. None of this was familiar. The plants, the mountains in the distance, the smell of the air - I had encountered none of them before. This place was not Troy. It was not even Greece. And, of course, I was still alone. I lay back in the dirt, eyes closed, and let the sun wash over my skin. When I could stand it, I decided to call on the gods. Apollo had not answered, perhaps another would. I called on all I knew that might be sympathetic to my cause, or to Patroclus: Artemis, Athena, Hera. There was no answer. Aphrodite, Zeus himself. Nothing. Perhaps the gods ignored me. I had nothing to offer them, after all, nothing to sacrifice, although I did hope my name would count for something. Perhaps they did not hear. Finally, my options run dry, I called to my mother. The words were ashes on my mouth, but I would see her again if it meant I could help Patroclus. I called out to her, even going so far as to step into the river. It was not salt, not sea, but it was better than dry land. Silence. I sat on the ground near the river and gathered myself. The demands of my body were making themselves known. Hunger. Thirst. I needed to find others. I trailed my hands through damp river gravel absentmindedly, my fingers encountering small, smooth stones. I plucked three, four, five stones from the gravel and set to juggling. The simple activity was as easy as it had ever been. My grace, at least, had not deserted me. Then the thought struck me: Patroclus loved to watch me juggle. I let the stones fall at my feet. His absence was a pit in my soul. The abyss called to me as I had called to the gods, urging me to plunge back into darkness. I could not allow myself to answer its call. I sighed. Then I climbed to my feet and started to run. I would run back to Troy, gods be damned. I ran through the woods. Blood coursed through me and air flooded my lungs. Sharp stones and twigs dug into my feet. I heard noises in the distance, strange sounds. I angled my body toward them and continued. Finally, I reached a clearing filled with people. They milled around in strange clothing, held strange objects, and spoke a language I had never heard before. I stopped dead, unsure. Was there danger here? How could I tell? I wondered exactly how much time had passed in the world of the living while I lay trapped in the underworld. An old woman turned away from her group and saw me where I lurked at the edge of the wood. Without thought, I shifted my weight to both feet equally. Muscles coiled in my legs. I did not need a spear to defeat these people, whoever they were. Like a rabbit recognizing the shadow of a hawk, the woman froze, a large platter of food held in her hands. Her eyes traveled down from my dirt-streaked face to my naked hips to my bloody feet. She dropped the platter to the ground and screamed. The others stopped and turned. They came for me. I fought, and brought a few of them down, but they had weapons I had never seen. One man pointed a black object at me, and I fell as if hit with lightning. I was wrong. I could defeat no one. More than three years have passed since I clawed my way out of the underworld. 1144 days. 27465 hours. 1647902 minutes. I know this in the same way I know that 3200 years have passed since my death, give or take a few decades - the people in this age are obsessed with time. Timekeeping tools are everywhere. The people now do not use the contraptions we used in Greece, the clepsydrae; the timekeepers of today, clocks, are eerily accurate and ubiquitous. They tick on every wall. They chime in city squares. They glow brightly from the inside of cars - fascinating, dangerous machines that have taken the place of horses. People carry clocks in their bags, in their pockets, even strapped to their wrists. The result is that, unlike the timeless torment of my tomb in the Lethe, I am now aware of every second that passes. I am painfully, excruciatingly aware. I always know the time. There are other things I know now. I know, for instance, that the old gods - my gods - are gone. No one knows exactly when it happened. Somewhere along the line humanity had stopped believing. With no one to worship in their temples or sacrifice in their name, the gods had simply disappeared. Good riddance to them, I think. Another god has risen in their place. A God. A nameless, unknowable being, far above the squabbling and petty politics the old gods had engaged in. The old gods were so incredibly human in that way. The new God is not. But it is still not enough. From what I understand of such things, the new God is also fading. Humanity does not need him anymore. We do not need any gods now, if we ever did. I see that now. The gods made me - made us mortals - believe that if we could do great deeds in life and gain enough honor, that we would receive a place in the heavens. We would blaze across the night sky, our images etched in light, eternal. I believed that, before I knew what a star truly was. And that would be a third thing I know now. Science. When I first encountered the people of this time, I did not understand how to move through this new world. I had to learn what others had known since early childhood. How to turn on a light. How to go up an escalator. How to buckle a seat belt. Patroclus would have laughed to see me humbled so. I was the greatest warrior of our generation, feared and respected by nations, and I did not know how to tie the laces of my shoes. All of this was made more difficult by the fact that I spoke a language as dead as the gods. Ancient Greek, the people now called it. It took me years to learn a few modern tongues, the Greek of today and English. Once I could communicate with the people around me, it became clear they believed me insane. They told me that I had suffered a psychotic break. I spoke of Patroclus, and they told me I was delusional. I cried my grief at our separation, and they told me I had depression. At first, I tried to prove myself by demonstrating my skill with the blade and spear. My keepers were not impressed. I learned quickly that people no longer cared for warriors. The number of enemies you had killed on the field of battle is not what people sing about anymore. Instead, creativity is valued. Writers, singers, and players are the new heroes. Intelligence is valued as well, and kindness. Doctors are heroes too. Patroclus, my love, I think often. You were born ahead of your time. Aristos Achaion, indeed. And beauty, of course, still holds great power. I have always understood in an abstract way that my looks are pleasing - Patroclus had often told me as much - but my other gifts were great enough that I had never had to rely on my beauty. I rely on it now. People are more patient with me if I arch my back where they can see. They are more generous if I let my hair fall across my eyes. I believe this is why I was finally released from the institution where I was kept. I pretended that my name was not Achilles. I pretended like I had never fought in Troy, like I had never killed, like my mother was not a long-dead sea-nymph, like the other half of my soul wasn't wandering alone in a place now called Turkey. I pretended, and the psychiatrist took in my tight jeans, my thin shirt stretched tight across the muscles of my chest, my sharp cheek bones, my slanted eyes, and my soft blond hair. He said, \"Well, you look good.\" Then I was free. I was so much less than I had been, but I was free. And now I am in Troy. Finding my way here was difficult. Nothing looks as it did, and the landscape has changed dramatically. I do not know where my people erected my monument after my death, but wherever they built it, it is gone now. I had hoped that once I arrived I would know what to do. That I would feel Patroclus, or that his spirit would be waiting. I do not feel him. No one waits for me. For want of something better to do, I sit in the ruins of what was once Troy and survey the city. Only orderly piles of sun-bleached stone remain. I see the foundation of a dwelling here, the remnants of a well there. I linger among the ruins, as broken as the smooth stone. I lie back and look up at the night sky. I know what a star is now: a huge ball of hot, luminous gas located impossibly far from Earth. There are far fewer stars visible now than there had been in my time, but I know that even the number I could see then was the smallest slice of what actually existed. Someone had told me once, after I had learned modern Greek, of a machine that circled our planet. The machine was like a looking glass but far more powerful. Modern scientists had pointed the machine at a tiny piece of dark space between two stars. What had they found? Whole other galaxies. They found thousands upon thousands of galaxies in the tiny piece of darkness between two stars. I turn away from the sky and press my cheek into the cool stone beneath me. What a fool I had been. An arrogant, blind, proud fool. I had actually believed that I could live forever. My mother had whispered to me of honor, godhood, immortality, and I had believed her. I had sent Patroclus to his death, sentenced us both to misery without end, in pursuit of something that I now know is impossible. Forget gods and heroes. Immortality is the real myth. In the face of the vast and untouchable universe, I can finally admit that. I can finally feel how small I really am. My hands curl tightly and I shove them into the pockets of my jacket. I sit up, the wind blowing my hair as wild as Medusa's. I remember something Odysseus once told me. We cannot say who will survive the holocaust of memory. It pains me to admit that he was right. My name is still spoken by people today, but in just the way Patroclus had feared. People speak of my rage. They speak of how I desecrated the body of Hector. They speak of my weakness, and my ignoble death. And worse, far worse - they do not speak of Patroclus at all. He was the true Aristos Achaion, and I am the only one who remembers. I return to the ruins often. I do not know what else to do. Others visit the ruins, people called tourists. They come from all over the world to gawk at a history they do not understand. Sometimes they try to talk to me. I shrug my shoulders and walk away. Most days I also do physical labor in exchange for money. My beauty and my strength are all I have left. I do not wish to sell myself, so I work. It is tedious, but necessary. There is not one moment that I do not miss Patroclus. Little distinguishes one day from the next, other than the ticking of the clocks. After a while, I save enough to buy a guitar. I had tried to find a lyre, but they are no longer a fashionable instrument; no one sells them anymore. The guitar suits me nicely, however. It is similar to the lyre, and I have always had a gift for music. After that, I take my guitar to the ruins. I sit in the grass, hands caressing the polished neck of my instrument, and make believe that Patroclus sits across from me. My hands move across strings made of some new synthetic rather than gut. My fingers strum half-remembered tunes, and I sing. The tourists throw money into the guitar case at my side. I take little notice. I decide to write a new song in the modern style. I sit at my usual spot in the ruins and pull the guitar in my lap. I begin to play. The words take flight from my mouth, gliding low and soft. I made the wrong decision Blinded by my pride Drawing blood and giving blood I drove you from my side Each day fades into the next Dead in all but name A debate between my sorrow And my tolerance for pain Oh, my love, you have to know It's not the fight I miss Come back to me I'll prove to you This and this and this I remember all of you Your body next to mine I dream of lips upon my lips Like crushing grapes to wine I swear to you, I'd beg the gods Leave my honor at their shrine To erase my name from history And see you one last time Oh, my love, you have to know It's not the fight I miss Come back to me I'll prove to you This and this and this This and this and this The melody wells from the depths of my soul and spills onto the sun-drenched ground at my feet. My eyes are downcast as I play, fixed on the point where my fingers meet string. This and this and this, I sing. This and this and this. After I finish, I do not look up right away. I cannot. My breath comes quickly and my chest heaves, as if I have just run a great distance. My heart stampedes like a stallion. I feel as if it will burst out of me. Finally, I lift my eyes. I blink hard as I do, for there, sitting across from me, is Patroclus. His dark hair is wild and untamable, the only outward indication of the tempest within. The long line of his throat plunges into the delicate rise of his collar bones. The rest of him is hidden beneath clothes quite similar to my own, but there is no mistaking him. I smile, the song lingering on my tongue like honeyed wine. I adore the sweetness. How can I not, when it has brought me this vision? I imagine Patroclus often, but my imaginings are usually not so vivid as this. Patroclus smiles back. Kindness and love shine in his eyes, as bright as any light Apollo ever gave. \"Achilles,\" he says. \"I've found you.\" I grip my guitar tighter to my chest. He leans forward, closing the distance between us. \"You look different,\" he says. Then he touches my leg. I jerk backwards. I felt that touch. I felt that touch. \"But you're a shade,\" I breathe. \"As are you,\" he replies. He is even closer now, on his knees. His hands move from my leg to the exposed skin of my arms. I jerk again. My hands move of their own accord to hold his face. I hold him steady and peer into his eyes. \"What trickery is this?\" \"No trickery,\" he says. I feel his breath across my face. \"Persephone told me of Apollo's wrath, and how he trapped you in the River Lethe. When Apollo faded, you were released. I made a bargain with Hades long ago that if you were released, I would be released. But the world is not what it used to be. I am sorry that it took me this long to find you.\" \"You were in the underworld?\" I ask. I want to say so many other things, but I cannot find the words. Patroclus was always better with words than I. \"For almost as long as you.\" \"Hades has not faded?\" The question is meaningless, but to speak it gives me time. I need time. Time to brush my fingers over Patroclus' brow, the ridge of his nose, the fat curves of his lips. I need this to be real. Patroclus is doing the same to me. He smooths his hands over my shoulders and says, \"The new God rules the heaven and earth, but he needed a partner to run the underworld. You've heard of the devil? That is Hades. Only, he is not what they say. He is much the same as always.\" I nearly choke on my laugh. The length of time since I'd last laughed is so great that I have forgotten how it's done. \"How did you find me?\" I ask. Patroclus leans his forehead against mine. He is trembling in my arms. When I put my hand to the ground to steady myself, I realize that I am trembling too. This is real. Gods, this is real. \"I followed your song,\" he says. I nod dumbly. It makes sense. Patroclus found me in Phthia, after all. He found me on Pelion and Scyros. What is one more miracle to a man whose existence is miraculous? He pulls the guitar from my lap, sets it on the yellow grass beside us, and moves into the empty space. Tourist flow around us. From the corner of my eye, I can see them look. I care not. \"We shall never be parted,\" I manage. I whisper the words into his ear, a sacred vow. It is the only divinity I need. \"From this day forward. I swear it.\" \"The last time you swore that to me, I did not believe you,\" Patroclus answered. \"And I was right. Our words did not save us.\" \"Then what is different this time?\" I could feel Patroclus smile against my cheek before he spoke. \"Only two things allow mortals to transcend their fate: great suffering and great love. Now, we know both. From this moment on, we write our own futures. I swear it.\" I wrap my arms around Patroclus for the first time in eternity, and I feel peace.",

      "I felt the sharp point of the arrow part the skin of my back.",
      "Thick muscle and slick bone greeted the shaft as it passed through my chest.",
      "My body spilled its blood in welcome, in tribute, like oil from an urn.",
      "I closed my eyes.",
      "Thank the gods, I thought.",
      "Finally.",
      "For the first time since I failed Patroclus, I felt something other than wild oscillations of rage and despair.",
      "I felt relief.",
      "As I fell forward, arrow through my heart, I smiled.",
      "My last thought was: Patroclus.",
      "I awoke in Elysium.",
      "I awoke in a nightmare.",
      "I could not find Patroclus.",
      "Darkness of the texture one finds in the depths of a cave or the bottom of the sea ran unbroken in all directions.",
      "My skill with a spear was useless, the grace of my former body laughable.",
      "The relief I had felt as my blood pooled onto hot dirt mocked me.",
      "I could not find him.",
      "Heroes wandered around me, through me, their souls idle with death.",
      "Heracles appeared in the swirling dark, and Perseus, fellow students of Chiron.",
      "I howled into the ether, a wounded animal.",
      "No one heard me.",
      "Patroclus.",
      "I repeated his name, over and over.",
      "Patroclus.",
      "Patroclus.",
      "Eternities passed and time stood still.",
      "Nothing held meaning, not in this thrice-cursed dark.",
      "Not without Patroclus.",
      "Alone, I raged.",
      "Where was he?",
      "He had promised to wait for me among the shades.",
      "For one shameful moment, I wondered if perhaps this was his punishment for me.",
      "I had refused to fight.",
      "I had chosen my pride, my hubris, over my love for him.",
      "I had sent him to his death.",
      "I had strapped him into the armor myself.",
      "Then I remembered how Patroclus' large, dark eyes had shone brighter than the hammered gold of my helm.",
      "The determined clench of his jaw.",
      "His rough hand gripping mine from the back of the chariot.",
      "I thought we had time, but that was no excuse.",
      "No",
      ". Patroclus was kind and loyal.",
      "He was not me.",
      "I could not imagine a world where he would abandon me.",
      "If he was not in the underworld, it was because he could not travel to the underworld.",
      "I raged anew.",
      "I felt cheated.",
      "Powerless.",
      "Empty.",
      "I knew I could not face death on my own, anymore than I could face life.",
      "I had not the strength.",
      "There had to be another way.",
      "As I quieted, I sat on the banks of the River Lethe and let my hand trail through oblivion.",
      "The river's black water was sluggish and brittle and so cold that fat disks of ice bobbed in the ebb and flow of the river's current.",
      "Perhaps this was our chance.",
      "If Patroclus could not come to me, I would go to him.",
      "I would drink the water of the River Lethe and be reincarnated.",
      "To drink the water of the River Lethe was to forget your past life, but I was certain that I would not forget Patroclus.",
      "If I knew nothing else, I knew that my soul would always know his.",
      "When I was born again, I would return to Troy.",
      "I would make sure our ashes rested together.",
      "I would make things right.",
      "I could do it.",
      "I knew I could do it.",
      "Besides, a timeless forever of waiting was beyond me.",
      "I sat on the river bank, my legs folded beneath me, my hand moving through the water.",
      "Years passed in aching darkness.",
      "I would find Patroclus.",
      "I swore it to myself.",
      "I would find him.",
      "There was nothing else.",
      "I shaped my hands into a loose bowl and let the river's water fill them.",
      "The water burned as it touched my lips, though I knew the burn was not real, for my lips were not real.",
      "I was a shade.",
      "I swallowed down the icy water, determined to start again.",
      "Immediately, golden light cleaved the air around me.",
      "The dark cracked in two, like an egg, and out of the void stepped a man.",
      "Shining brown hair fell in waves to his broad shoulders and brushed the top of the bow slung across his chest.",
      "The man had smooth, golden skin.",
      "Black eyes.",
      "A beauty so radiant it stole my breath.",
      "The depth of my desire was such that I believed, for one wild moment, that Patroclus had come to me.",
      "Then the man smiled, and in his smile I saw my mother.",
      "I saw a god.",
      "Everything I had wanted to be.",
      "A destroyer of lives.",
      "I let my phantom lips curl.",
      "This one would receive no deference from me.",
      "\"Apollo.\"",
      "Apollo's black eyes flattened and his smile turned stale, hard as old bread.",
      "My mother had taught me early that there were consequences to angering a god.",
      "I cared not.",
      "I had nothing left to lose.",
      "\"Why are you drinking from the Lethe, Pelides?\" Apollo asked.",
      "\"Are you missing something, perhaps?\"",
      "My hand grasped for a spear that was not there.",
      "\"You have brought this on yourself,\" Apollo said, off-handed, as if speaking to a slave or a child that he did not have time for.",
      "\"You burned my temples.",
      "You desecrated the body of my chosen.",
      "You go against me still.",
      "Your crimes cannot go unpunished.\"",
      "The light around Apollo increased steadily, like dawn breaking over the ocean.",
      "I had seen nothing but the dark for so long.",
      "I could not look away.",
      "\"Where is Patroclus?\" I demanded.",
      "Why was he not waiting amongst the shades?",
      "\"To learn that, you must speak with your kin.\"",
      "Apollo's light continued to grow.",
      "He was a terrible sight.",
      "\"Your mother and son would not have your monument dishonored with his name.",
      "That, however, is not my concern.\"",
      "I staggered back in the face of Apollo's revelation.",
      "Not Agamemnon, then.",
      "Not Menelaus, not Odysseus.",
      "The betrayal had come from my mother and my son.",
      "Apollo called them my kin, but they were not my kin.",
      "Patroclus was my only kin.",
      "My feet hit the river.",
      "\"I know what it is to lose a lover,\" Apollo said, his words falling from his beautiful lips like notes from a lyre.",
      "The lyre was the instrument of Apollo.",
      "To think, I had once believed my skill at playing would be enough to keep Patroclus at my side.",
      "\"I would not allow Hades to claim the soul of Hyacinth.",
      "I kept him for myself, because I would not be parted from him.",
      "That is to be your punishment.",
      "You will never forget.",
      "You will never be reborn.",
      "You will remain here, alone, without your philtatos, until the stars fall from the heavens.\"",
      "Panic coursed through me, chilling my blood to the same temperature as the river swirling around my ankles.",
      "No",
      ". I had to get to Patroclus.",
      "He needed me.",
      "Apollo could not trap me here.",
      "I would fight him.",
      "I lifted my hands and dropped into a crouch.",
      "Apollo smiled benevolently and lifted his hands, a shining reflection of my own stance.",
      "Then he flung his arms wide and the brilliant light that had been collecting around him burst in all directions.",
      "My back hit the water.",
      "The air rushed from my lungs, only to be replaced with frigid water.",
      "My ribs squeezed together like two hands crushing a beetle.",
      "My hands clawed for purchase, and my legs flicked like a dolphin's tail.",
      "I was powerless.",
      "I sank like a stone thrown into a still pond, the violence of my intrusion rippling out in every direction.",
      "I could not breathe.",
      "I was drowning.",
      "I felt myself hit the river bed and immediately gathered myself for a push to the surface, but I could not.",
      "The water above me was freezing now in cascading patterns of ice crystals that fanned across my field of vision.",
      "Then the ice reached my body, pressing hard against my eyes, my chest, my thighs.",
      "I could not see.",
      "I could not move.",
      "The light faded, but the ice remained.",
      "I waited for something, anything, to shift, but nothing did.",
      "I was trapped.",
      "I had never been one for thinking - of the two of us, Patroclus was the thoughtful one; he was my balance in that way - but once my shade was banished to the bottom of the River Lethe, I had nothing to do but think.",
      "Even if Patroclus made his way to the underworld, to Elysium, he would not find me.",
      "Apollo had made sure of it.",
      "I was the ghost of a ghost, and for the next infinity, all I did was think.",
      "And think.",
      "And think.",
      "And think.",
      "Patroclus.",
      "Time did not exist under the ice.",
      "I was always aware, always present; there was no before or after, only now.",
      "It was torture for one who had lived his entire life in service to a future he would never see.",
      "I was a fly trapped in amber, perfectly preserved in the moment of my imprisonment.",
      "That was why I did not realize something was changing until I was already moving.",
      "I heard great booms, reminiscent of the sounds siege stones made as they crashed into the walls of cities.",
      "The vibrations that followed flowed through me, rattling my shade within my tomb of ice.",
      "As soon as the booms died, I dismissed them.",
      "But the booms only grew louder.",
      "Louder and closer.",
      "Then, with one last, great vibration, the ice around me broke apart.",
      "I gasped as liquid touched my skin.",
      "Disoriented, I followed my instincts, which had always been excellent.",
      "I turned my body until the river bed was beneath my feet and pushed.",
      "I did not question.",
      "Movement.",
      "Oh, to move, even as a shade, was pure bliss.",
      "I wanted to laugh.",
      "I wanted to laugh the way I used to laugh.",
      "I swept my arms in front of me, careful not to scrape myself against the large chunks of ice still floating in the river.",
      "With steady movements, I dragged myself forward until my hand touched a surface that was not water.",
      "Worryingly, the surface also was not air.",
      "I kicked slowly, keeping myself in place as I felt along the strange surface.",
      "The River Lethe had acquired a ceiling, apparently.",
      "A ceiling made of...I scratch my fingers along the surface and felt something go under my nails.",
      "Dirt.",
      "There was dirt above me.",
      "I swam along the dirt ceiling, searching for a clear path out of the river.",
      "Nothing.",
      "I kept swimming and wished for Patroclus.",
      "He was clever, more so than I. I created problems, he solved them.",
      "He would know.",
      "But I did not have Patroclus, only myself.",
      "My heart was a hummingbird in my chest, fluttering madly, yearning for escape.",
      "Desperate, I decided to walk the only road available to me; rather than simply run my hands along the dirt ceiling, I thrust my fist deep into the soil and pulled.",
      "At first, the dirt simply rained into the water.",
      "Soon, though, I had torn enough of the dirt away to make an opening large enough for my head.",
      "For the first time in a very long time, I felt air.",
      "I breathed.",
      "Unsure of how much dirt lay above me, I started to climb.",
      "I wedge myself into the densely packed soil, my fingers seeking crevasses and pockets of air.",
      "I struggled and climbed, the dirt choking me, filling my mouth, nose, ears.",
      "As far as I climbed, there was only more dirt.",
      "That is, until there wasn't.",
      "With one last thrust of my hand, I broke through.",
      "I had reached the top.",
      "I hooked my hands into the soft soil, and hauled myself out of the ground and into another world.",
      "At first it was painful.",
      "I was surrounded by hideously bright light.",
      "Even closed, the brilliance pierced my eyes like daggers.",
      "This must have been Apollo's doing.",
      "My punishment began with his light.",
      "This felt the same.",
      "I clasped my hands tightly over my eyes.",
      "\"Apollo!\"",
      "I called the god's name, reckless.",
      "Calling on the gods was always reckless.",
      "\"Apollo!\"",
      "There was no answer.",
      "I forced myself into calm as I lay on the ground, palms pressed into my eyes.",
      "Adjust, I told myself.",
      "Let it come.",
      "I breathed.",
      "As I breathed, other sensations made themselves known.",
      "Warmth, for one.",
      "Actual warmth, as I had not felt since I last held Patroclus.",
      "He had been nothing but warmth.",
      "But also, there were smells.",
      "Sweet, green grass.",
      "Disturbed earth.",
      "And, wafting on the soft breeze that danced through the hair across my forehead, something gritty and harsh.",
      "Something I had never smelled before.",
      "When I could stand it, I opened my eyes.",
      "One glance confirmed that this was not Elysium.",
      "This was not the underworld at all.",
      "I saw tall, straight trees covered in needles swaying in the wind.",
      "A river, a true river, ran broad and tranquil to my left.",
      "I tilted my head to the sky and saw puffy white clouds wandering through a field of deep blue.",
      "With no little trepidation, I looked down.",
      "I was naked.",
      "I shook my head.",
      "Dirt flew in all directions as my hair whipped around my head.",
      "I lifted my hands.",
      "I touched myself: my cheeks, my shoulders, my belly.",
      "My feet.",
      "I placed a finger against my neck and felt the blood pulsing underneath like a war drum.",
      "I had sprung fully formed from the earth like Athena from the head of Zeus.",
      "I lived again.",
      "I was also confused.",
      "None of this was familiar.",
      "The plants, the mountains in the distance, the smell of the air - I had encountered none of them before.",
      "This place was not Troy.",
      "It was not even Greece.",
      "And, of course, I was still alone.",
      "I lay back in the dirt, eyes closed, and let the sun wash over my skin.",
      "When I could stand it, I decided to call on the gods.",
      "Apollo had not answered, perhaps another would.",
      "I called on all I knew that might be sympathetic to my cause, or to Patroclus: Artemis, Athena, Hera.",
      "There was no answer.",
      "Aphrodite, Zeus himself.",
      "Nothing.",
      "Perhaps the gods ignored me.",
      "I had nothing to offer them, after all, nothing to sacrifice, although I did hope my name would count for something.",
      "Perhaps they did not hear.",
      "Finally, my options run dry, I called to my mother.",
      "The words were ashes on my mouth, but I would see her again if it meant I could help Patroclus.",
      "I called out to her, even going so far as to step into the river.",
      "It was not salt, not sea, but it was better than dry land.",
      "Silence.",
      "I sat on the ground near the river and gathered myself.",
      "The demands of my body were making themselves known.",
      "Hunger.",
      "Thirst.",
      "I needed to find others.",
      "I trailed my hands through damp river gravel absentmindedly, my fingers encountering small, smooth stones.",
      "I plucked three, four, five stones from the gravel and set to juggling.",
      "The simple activity was as easy as it had ever been.",
      "My grace, at least, had not deserted me.",
      "Then the thought struck me: Patroclus loved to watch me juggle.",
      "I let the stones fall at my feet.",
      "His absence was a pit in my soul.",
      "The abyss called to me as I had called to the gods, urging me to plunge back into darkness.",
      "I could not allow myself to answer its call.",
      "I sighed.",
      "Then I climbed to my feet and started to run.",
      "I would run back to Troy, gods be damned.",
      "I ran through the woods.",
      "Blood coursed through me and air flooded my lungs.",
      "Sharp stones and twigs dug into my feet.",
      "I heard noises in the distance, strange sounds.",
      "I angled my body toward them and continued.",
      "Finally, I reached a clearing filled with people.",
      "They milled around in strange clothing, held strange objects, and spoke a language I had never heard before.",
      "I stopped dead, unsure.",
      "Was there danger here?",
      "How could I tell?",
      "I wondered exactly how much time had passed in the world of the living while I lay trapped in the underworld.",
      "An old woman turned away from her group and saw me where I lurked at the edge of the wood.",
      "Without thought, I shifted my weight to both feet equally.",
      "Muscles coiled in my legs.",
      "I did not need a spear to defeat these people, whoever they were.",
      "Like a rabbit recognizing the shadow of a hawk, the woman froze, a large platter of food held in her hands.",
      "Her eyes traveled down from my dirt-streaked face to my naked hips to my bloody feet.",
      "She dropped the platter to the ground and screamed.",
      "The others stopped and turned.",
      "They came for me.",
      "I fought, and brought a few of them down, but they had weapons I had never seen.",
      "One man pointed a black object at me, and I fell as if hit with lightning.",
      "I was wrong.",
      "I could defeat no one.",
      "More than three years have passed since I clawed my way out of the underworld.",
      "1144 days.",
      "27465 hours.",
      "1647902 minutes.",
      "I know this in the same way I know that 3200 years have passed since my death, give or take a few decades - the people in this age are obsessed with time.",
      "Timekeeping tools are everywhere.",
      "The people now do not use the contraptions we used in Greece, the clepsydrae; the timekeepers of today, clocks, are eerily accurate and ubiquitous.",
      "They tick on every wall.",
      "They chime in city squares.",
      "They glow brightly from the inside of cars - fascinating, dangerous machines that have taken the place of horses.",
      "People carry clocks in their bags, in their pockets, even strapped to their wrists.",
      "The result is that, unlike the timeless torment of my tomb in the Lethe, I am now aware of every second that passes.",
      "I am painfully, excruciatingly aware.",
      "I always know the time.",
      "There are other things I know now.",
      "I know, for instance, that the old gods - my gods - are gone.",
      "No one knows exactly when it happened.",
      "Somewhere along the line humanity had stopped believing.",
      "With no one to worship in their temples or sacrifice in their name, the gods had simply disappeared.",
      "Good riddance to them, I think.",
      "Another god has risen in their place.",
      "A God.",
      "A nameless, unknowable being, far above the squabbling and petty politics the old gods had engaged in.",
      "The old gods were so incredibly human in that way.",
      "The new God is not.",
      "But it is still not enough.",
      "From what I understand of such things, the new God is also fading.",
      "Humanity does not need him anymore.",
      "We do not need any gods now, if we ever did.",
      "I see that now.",
      "The gods made me - made us mortals - believe that if we could do great deeds in life and gain enough honor, that we would receive a place in the heavens.",
      "We would blaze across the night sky, our images etched in light, eternal.",
      "I believed that, before I knew what a star truly was.",
      "And that would be a third thing I know now.",
      "Science.",
      "When I first encountered the people of this time, I did not understand how to move through this new world.",
      "I had to learn what others had known since early childhood.",
      "How to turn on a light.",
      "How to go up an escalator.",
      "How to buckle a seat belt.",
      "Patroclus would have laughed to see me humbled so.",
      "I was the greatest warrior of our generation, feared and respected by nations, and I did not know how to tie the laces of my shoes.",
      "All of this was made more difficult by the fact that I spoke a language as dead as the gods.",
      "Ancient Greek, the people now called it.",
      "It took me years to learn a few modern tongues, the Greek of today and English.",
      "Once I could communicate with the people around me, it became clear they believed me insane.",
      "They told me that I had suffered a psychotic break.",
      "I spoke of Patroclus, and they told me I was delusional.",
      "I cried my grief at our separation, and they told me I had depression.",
      "At first, I tried to prove myself by demonstrating my skill with the blade and spear.",
      "My keepers were not impressed.",
      "I learned quickly that people no longer cared for warriors.",
      "The number of enemies you had killed on the field of battle is not what people sing about anymore.",
      "Instead, creativity is valued.",
      "Writers, singers, and players are the new heroes.",
      "Intelligence is valued as well, and kindness.",
      "Doctors are heroes too.",
      "Patroclus, my love, I think often.",
      "You were born ahead of your time.",
      "Aristos Achaion, indeed.",
      "And beauty, of course, still holds great power.",
      "I have always understood in an abstract way that my looks are pleasing - Patroclus had often told me as much - but my other gifts were great enough that I had never had to rely on my beauty.",
      "I rely on it now.",
      "People are more patient with me if I arch my back where they can see.",
      "They are more generous if I let my hair fall across my eyes.",
      "I believe this is why I was finally released from the institution where I was kept.",
      "I pretended that my name was not Achilles.",
      "I pretended like I had never fought in Troy, like I had never killed, like my mother was not a long-dead sea-nymph, like the other half of my soul wasn't wandering alone in a place now called Turkey.",
      "I pretended, and the psychiatrist took in my tight jeans, my thin shirt stretched tight across the muscles of my chest, my sharp cheek bones, my slanted eyes, and my soft blond hair.",
      "He said, \"Well, you look good.\"",
      "Then I was free.",
      "I was so much less than I had been, but I was free.",
      "And now I am in Troy.",
      "Finding my way here was difficult.",
      "Nothing looks as it did, and the landscape has changed dramatically.",
      "I do not know where my people erected my monument after my death, but wherever they built it, it is gone now.",
      "I had hoped that once I arrived I would know what to do.",
      "That I would feel Patroclus, or that his spirit would be waiting.",
      "I do not feel him.",
      "No one waits for me.",
      "For want of something better to do, I sit in the ruins of what was once Troy and survey the city.",
      "Only orderly piles of sun-bleached stone remain.",
      "I see the foundation of a dwelling here, the remnants of a well there.",
      "I linger among the ruins, as broken as the smooth stone.",
      "I lie back and look up at the night sky.",
      "I know what a star is now: a huge ball of hot, luminous gas located impossibly far from Earth.",
      "There are far fewer stars visible now than there had been in my time, but I know that even the number I could see then was the smallest slice of what actually existed.",
      "Someone had told me once, after I had learned modern Greek, of a machine that circled our planet.",
      "The machine was like a looking glass but far more powerful.",
      "Modern scientists had pointed the machine at a tiny piece of dark space between two stars.",
      "What had they found?",
      "Whole other galaxies.",
      "They found thousands upon thousands of galaxies in the tiny piece of darkness between two stars.",
      "I turn away from the sky and press my cheek into the cool stone beneath me.",
      "What a fool I had been.",
      "An arrogant, blind, proud fool.",
      "I had actually believed that I could live forever.",
      "My mother had whispered to me of honor, godhood, immortality, and I had believed her.",
      "I had sent Patroclus to his death, sentenced us both to misery without end, in pursuit of something that I now know is impossible.",

    "text": "This is a story about Persephone - but to understand Persephone, you have to start with her mother. Demeter was an Olympian, and the word on the street puts her as the nicest of a nasty lot. Vicious and ruthless, of course, but only when she had to be. Demeter didn't go in for vices the same way the other Olympians did, and why bother with the lower levels at all if you're not going to have any fun there? Besides, it's easy to be well-liked when you conduct most of your business off-world - and Demeter did. She made her fortune from the colonised planets which fed the City, a loose cluster of terraformed rocks where you'd find nothing but grain and harvesting drones. Sole control of the food supply might be a thankless job, but it's one that pays well. So when Demeter decided she wanted a daughter of her own - all of her own - well, anything is possible with enough time, money and genetic material. Demeter was rich in all three. Persephone was born. She was beautiful of course - skin as gold as honey, and a long, loose tumble of dark curls. She had everything she wanted at her fingertips - the latest technology, the rarest delicacies, a whole crowd of nymphs to keep her company. In time, she took over a small corner of her mother's business. Genetics was her speciality - optimising yields, creating hardier strains of wheat and barley for each new barely-habitable world the City's influence spread to. She started a neat sideline in flowers, developing exotic new species and selling them at top premium to be the centrepiece at Dionysus's next party. Gorgeous, immortal and brilliant - she was the perfect daughter, and she led the perfect life. What more could any girl want? If you have to ask, then perhaps what happened next will surprise you as much as it did Demeter. But there's another player in this story. Hades had never lived in the towers of Olympus - the Acheron was buried deep in the heart of the city, away from the light. But they were still an Olympian, and conferences were occasionally necessary. \"If I can't rely on your computing power -\" Demeter began, at one such meeting. \"You can rely on it.\" \"If you're raising prices -\" the volume rose. \"We need the Acheron.\" Hades didn't look impressed. \"Everyone needs the Acheron.\" \"Mother?\" Persephone's appearance interrupted the argument. Of course, it wasn't unusual for people to fall silent when she entered the room. Barely a century old, she still looked twenty-one, and wore blossoms woven into her hair where it tumbled over a dress of white silk. As soon as she noticed Hades, Persephone could not draw her eyes away. She had never met them before, but she knew the reputation. Everyone did. \"Nothing to be concerned about, dearest,\" Demeter told her with a humourless smile. \"We're simply negotiating.\" \"There's nothing to negotiate,\" Hades told her. \"The Acheron can only do so much. The new prices are what the processing time is worth, and it's only going to get more expensive - unless you have some way of making a mind think faster.\" They turned to leave, their eyes flickering to Persephone again. \"Nice meeting you.\" Persephone smiled. \"Likewise.\" A month later, the girl disappeared. Demeter was furious. She declared her company closed for business. No food would be imported into the City until Persephone was safely returned. There were riots in the streets, and starvation loomed. In the lower levels, the bodies began to pile up. The Metropolitan Power Company were working triple shifts. Brains were coming in at five times the usual rate, most of them damaged and barely-functional from the pain of a lingering death. And in the midst of all this, three minds disappeared. Now, people vanished in the city all the time, and there were a lot of places they might end up that weren't inside the Acheron - at least, immediately speaking. But, while you could vanish from nearly everyone, the Underworld network knew where you were. Or at least, it knew what had happened to that precious grey matter in your skull. Hades didn't care where you went or what you did, but the Acheron kept tabs on everyone. Of course, occasionally a mind would slip through the net. Some people were good at disappearing, sometimes the program forgot to carry a one and things wouldn't quite add up. It was rare, but it happened. Sometimes things had to be tracked down by hand. Every once in a while. Three in a week was something else entirely. Even in the midst of all the chaos of the lower levels tearing themselves to pieces in the fight for food, that got noticed. Thalia stumbled as she followed the stranger down a narrow alleyway. She had drunk a lot, in spite of the high prices, trying to dull the aching pangs in her stomach and the sharp fear of what was to come in the morning. There was nothing else for it, though. She had made it by for the first week after Demeter threw her little hissy fit, but her money had run out. She was going to die. So why not volunteer, and trade in those last few days of starvation for the faint hope of a pleasant afterlife? But she hadn't been able to face it sober. And then the stranger in the red dress, the beautiful woman who had introduced herself as Kore - well, why not make one last happy memory? \"Where did you say you lived?\" she slurred out. Kore turned, peering through short-cropped black curls to smile back at her. She took Thalia's hand. \"Not far,\" she promised. Her voice sent a thrill down Thalia's spine, just as it had back in the bar. \"I can't believe I'm doing this,\" she said, half to herself. \"I don't know the first thing about you.\" Kore laughed. \"Well, we can't have that. What would you like to know?\" \"I don't know, everything.\" The stranger's laugher was light and musical. \"What do you do?\" \"I like to think of myself as an artist.\" Thalia nodded. This part of the City was full of artists, starving and otherwise. Mostly the former. \"You have a patron, then?\" \"Not yet.\" She'd be the starving kind then. \"But I have plans to get one.\" \"Ambitious?\" Thalia laughed. \"Going to see you on Mount Olympus one day, am I?\" For a moment, Kore's smile faltered. \"Perhaps not.\" Thalia tugged her to a halt. \"Hey.\" She wrapped one hand around Kore's honey-gold cheek, feeling the softness of the skin there. \"Tell me about your art.\" \"Actually.\" Kore bit her lip, hiding a smile. \"I was hoping you'd help me with a project.\" \"I'm not much of an artist.\" \"You don't have to be.\" Kore's eyes were lit up with passion. \"You see, I have this theory - do you know anything about plants?\" Thalia shook her head. \"Do you?\" \"My mother knew a little about biology,\" Kore explained. \"The amazing part of a plant is how it reproduces. They produce thousands of seeds, sometimes even millions of potential offspring. In the wild, most of them die off before reaching adulthood.\" \"Sounds like a few people I know.\" Kore smiled. \"But you see, given the right environment, every single seed can grow into a healthy adult plant. From one parent, a whole generation can be born. Given the right circumstances for growth.\" Thalia blinked. \"Great.\" \"I have a theory,\" Kore murmured, making Thalia lean in close to hear until their noses almost touched. \"That thoughts work the same way.\" \"And what's the right environment for an idea to grow in?\" Thalia asked. Kore's laughter reverberated through the tiny gap between them. \"Other ideas.\" Thalia leaned forward, expecting a kiss, but Kore pulled away, looking regretful. \"My studio is just down here,\" she insisted, leading Thalia deeper into the dark alleyway. Sure enough, they came to a door. \"What do you say?\" Kore asked as she entered the passcode. \"Do you want to help me grow some new thoughts?\" \"Inspiration,\" Thalia mused. \"I think I can do that.\" \"Then why don't you take a look?\" Thalia stepped through the door and froze, horrified by the sight which greeted her. But before she could open her mouth to scream, Persephone's knife was at her throat. When they tracked down Persephone's workroom, nearly two weeks after she had left her mother's home, they found a masterpiece. Five brains pressed together, bulging against one another under the thick ruby sheen of blood and electrolytes which nourished the system. Each mind wired into the next, connected and rerouted to work in concert, one giant super-computer with another half a dozen empty ports. And in the midst of it all, Persephone herself, the gore running in rivulets down her honey-gold arms as she wired the sixth brain into place, its owner already rotting on the floor. She turned as the door slid open, her eyes settling on the intruder. Then she smiled, brilliant even through the bloodstains. \"Oh good,\" she said. \"You're here.\" Hades took in the scene. \"You know,\" they said. \"There were easier ways to get my attention.\"",

    "text": "\"You will always love the wrong men,\" Cassandra breathes. \"And that will bring you nothing but sorrow.\" It's Helen's oldest darkest fear, and as Cassandra's words draw it into the sunlight it melts away like smoke. The corner of Cassandra's mouth crooks up, a bittersweet struggle of a smile. Cassandra is not beautiful--Cassandra might have been beautiful, before. But the smile she tries to form is kind, the effort in it kinder still, and Helen values kindness so much more than beauty. Aphrodite is beautiful. Only Hector and Priam and now Cassandra are kind. \"And you?\" Helen asks. \"No.\" Cassandra will never speak of herself. The war drags on, one year, three, five. Cassandra clings to Helen and tells her terrible things--Hector slain, his body stolen; Priam killed; little Astyanax killed; Hecuba and Andromache taken. Helen wraps her arms tighter around Cassandra's shaking body and tries not to take comfort in Cassandra's terror, in the things that sound so deadly possible until spoken. But-- \"Does it help?\" Cassandra asks, turning her fear-bright face up to Helen. \"You never call me only mad, or mock me; does it help you to hear what I have to say?\" Helen closes her eyes. \"Yes.\" \"It helps to say it,\" Cassandra says, and lets her head settle again on Helen's shoulder. \"It helps to be listened to.\" \"And you? What will happen to you?\" Cassandra never answers, but Helen keeps asking. She imagines Cassandra promising her that no harm will come to her, and wonders if that reassurance would be as terrifying as every tale of death is not. \"That won't help.\" Cassandra's voice is very soft and very clear. Helen thinks of the day's last gleam of sunlight almost disappearing below the sea, and the stillness of the night following. \"And me?\" Cassandra shakes her head. Her hair, wind-rough, drags across Helen's throat. Helen buys sweet things in the market (the whispers follow her there, words that bite into her spirit like poison) and brings them to Cassandra, who is scoured pale and thin with worry. Her screams wake the whole palace some nights, and Helen abandons diplomacy to defend her. \"I'm not hungry,\" Cassandra says. \"Just a bite,\" Helen says. She'd traded a bracelet for the little box of honey-drenched fruit. Even in wartime luxuries can be had, for a price; Paris taught her that. For herself Helen doesn't care, but she will trade away all her jewels in turn if it tempts Cassandra to eat. She'd trade more, and count it cheap, to relieve Cassandra's mind as Cassandra relieves hers. Cassandra reaches out and takes a piece of fruit. The honey clings, sticky and golden, to her fingers, and Helen watches her lick them clean and tries not to care. \"Helen.\" Helen turns, quickly, but the unevenness in Cassandra's voice seems more likely to have been laughter than dismay. Cassandra's eyes are luminous, unshadowed. \"Shall I tell you how Achilles will die?\" She hates Achilles almost as much as she hates herself, for the destruction they have both brought on the people of Troy. How will he die? How can she hope? What use will whatever Cassandra tells her be, unless Cassandra means to promise her that Achilles will die at a great age, happily, in bed--which is impossible, surely. If the gods have any kindness at all, surely. But the light in Cassandra's eyes has spread across her face, and the line of her mouth holds like the string of a drawn bow, ready to move. \"How?\" Helen asks. \"Paris will kill him,\" Cassandra says. It takes Helen a moment, and then she laughs, really laughs, the sound wrenched from the knot of worry in her belly to spill into the air. As if she'd just been waiting for--needing--this, Cassandra's expression cracks open into a smile of her own, softer and less wild than the mirth that is emptying Helen out, leaving her light and giddy; the tears that stream down her cheeks seem to wash her clean. Paris will kill Achilles? Paris who has half-tired of Helen now and never cared to defend her? Paris, selfish and vain and cowardly? That Paris, kill the most fearsome of the Achaeans--the most fearsome warrior that Troy has ever faced? Cassandra steadies Helen when her laughter unbalances her, holds her once the storm has died down to tired giggling. She looks happier than Helen has ever seen her, tender and proud. \"I would like to tell you,\" Cassandra begins, and stops. The sun catches in her hair, bringing deep gleams of midnight blue and darkest wine out of the coiled mass of black. The sharp lines of her nose and cheek are outlined in gold. \"Tell me.\" Helen means it as a question, an encouragement, but it isn't one; gentle as it is, it's a plea. She wants to know Cassandra as clearly as Cassandra knows her. \"When I was just grown to womanhood I caught the eye of Apollo himself,\" Cassandra says, very slowly, as if she has to drag each word to her lips. It would be easy to dismiss this as more madness, but Helen, god-bartered herself, cannot. Something in Cassandra's voice evokes the unforgettable weight of Aphrodite's eyes on her. \"He offered me prophecy, if I would be his lover. I could know everything that came to pass, and guide the kings of Troy in their actions so that Troy might be the glory of this age of men. I was tempted, I--I did not discourage him.\" Her voice breaks, and she looks away. Helen reaches out, helplessly, and Cassandra leans into her and draws a deep shaking breath. And goes on, as if somehow Helen still has strength to offer her. \"I should have, from the start. I have never had any desire for men. I thought--I hoped it would be different, with a god, or for such a gift. But gods in the shape of men are not that different from men, I found. I changed my mind, I was terrified, I--he released me. He said...\" It does no good to curse the gods, but Helen, soundless and raging, does. Cassandra trembles against her, the catch of her breath each time she inhales like a sob. Shadows move across the stone under their feet. Finally Cassandra says, \"He said I could have his curse instead of his blessing, for teasing him. Since I had wanted the gift so much.\" She is silent, then. Helen wonders at the courage it must have taken Cassandra, when the things that might have been prophecy are nothing but a tangle of impossibilities and madness, to tell how it all began. How easy it would be to doubt her. \"I believe you,\" she says, and Cassandra goes even more still. Tension and hope seem almost to leak from her into Helen where they touch. \"I believe it, Cassandra, that everything happened just as you said.\" Cassandra draws back, entirely away. The air is sharp between them, but Cassandra's gaze burns when it meets Helen's: frantic, yearning, desperate and despairing. \"I believe you.\" Cassandra says, \"I would tell you your future, if telling you would help.\" Helen has been in Troy for almost nine years. She wishes it were more, she wishes it were all her life. She wishes she had been a maiden of Troy and not a wife brought to it. She could love Troy, if things had been different. \"What do you mean?\" she asks. Cassandra's smile is sad, and Helen wonders if it's vanity or a fool's hope to think that Cassandra might manage a smile at all only because it's for Helen. \"It would bring you grief if I told you, from now until it comes to pass.\" There are so many awful fates--Helen's mind whirls between them, tortures, deaths, despair, and finally drops, weary of spinning, and she thinks of none of them at all. She imagines that the Achaeans might give up and leave her be, and Paris without his war might let her go entirely, and she might then be able to piece together a quiet life made of the reparations she owes everyone who has not thrown her over the walls these nine long years. There is a change in the air, like storms just over the horizon. Helen stops Cassandra at twilight with a hand to her wrist, and Cassandra stays, though the air is growing cold around them. \"When you said you had no desire for men,\" Helen says carefully, \"did you mean--women? or no one at all?\" Her heart thuds drumlike in her ears. Five beats, before Cassandra answers, but it seems much longer. \"Women,\" Cassandra says. \"Sometimes.\" And Helen could leave it at that, Helen perhaps should leave it at that, while it still might be a question asked from nothing but curiosity. Helen's love is tragedy and war and death, and Cassandra is already even more broken than she is. Cassandra should have someone pure and strong, not Helen who has come to Troy like a plague and has no strength left in her. It is selfish to want Cassandra, when Helen has done nothing for her, can do nothing for her. And it is frightening to think that perhaps Cassandra is so glad to have her as a friend that Cassandra might want nothing else, might be horrified at the idea of anything else. Maybe if they lived in peacetime she might have left it after all. But Troy could fall the next day. Priam's patience with Helen could prove less than endless after all, and he could turn her back over to Menelaus (and Agamemnon and all their armies) in exchange for peace. There are too many ways she might never see Cassandra again for her to stay silent. She thinks about asking Cassandra whether they will grow old together, and doesn't: whatever the answer, she has no wish to hear it, not from Cassandra, not in words that can only ever comfort one of them. (Helen thinks she knows the answer anyway; she hugs it to herself, a shadow she dares not let any light banish.) So instead she says, \"Do you think...could you care for me?\" Cassandra's eyes focus through Helen on the far distance, a frightening look even though Helen has seen it before. \"They will leave so much out of you when they speak of your beauty--they will praise the shape of your mouth but not the words it spoke in defense of a mad prophetess, or the cruelties it never said to her; they will praise the whiteness of your arms and never mention how gold they burned in the sun of your city and the time we spent on the walls; they will praise the color of your eyes and forget entirely that you saw me, you saw me. They will misjudge you entirely, you who are nothing but heart, they will call you heartless, they will forget everything.\" The words wash through Helen, and the bitter sweep past and are gone, leaving her with only the sweet. \"I will remember,\" Cassandra says, urgent as a vow. She is here again, not the elsewhen of her madness. \"I'll remember who you are, Helen. You asked if I could care for you--I always have.\" She leans forward and kisses Helen, fierce and sharp, nothing that Helen had expected from her. It's quick and brilliant and searing as lightning, and then over, and Cassandra whispers into the air between them, soft as she'd first said it all those years ago, \"I told you you would always love the wrong men, and it would only ever bring you sorrow. That was true, and so is this--I am not a man.\" Helen breathes the words in, tastes them like dawn without any smoke in the wind. \"Nor wrong,\" she says, kissing Cassandra again, gentler this time, and Cassandra sighs against her mouth in what feels like relief and kisses back.",

      "But-- \"Does it help?\" Cassandra asks, turning her fear-bright face up to Helen.",
      "\"You never call me only mad, or mock me; does it help you to hear what I have to say?\"",
      "Helen closes her eyes.",
      "\"Yes.\"",
      "\"It helps to say it,\" Cassandra says, and lets her head settle again on Helen's shoulder.",

      "\"I'm not hungry,\" Cassandra says.",
      "\"Just a bite,\" Helen says.",
      "She'd traded a bracelet for the little box of honey-drenched fruit.",
      "Even in wartime luxuries can be had, for a price; Paris taught her that.",
      "For herself Helen doesn't care, but she will trade away all her jewels in turn if it tempts Cassandra to eat.",
      "She'd trade more, and count it cheap, to relieve Cassandra's mind as Cassandra relieves hers.",
      "Cassandra reaches out and takes a piece of fruit.",

      "How can she hope?",

      "If the gods have any kindness at all, surely.",
      "But the light in Cassandra's eyes has spread across her face, and the line of her mouth holds like the string of a drawn bow, ready to move.",
      "\"How?\" Helen asks.",
      "\"Paris will kill him,\" Cassandra says.",
      "It takes Helen a moment, and then she laughs, really laughs, the sound wrenched from the knot of worry in her belly to spill into the air.",
      "As if she'd just been waiting for--needing--this, Cassandra's expression cracks open into a smile of her own, softer and less wild than the mirth that is emptying Helen out, leaving her light and giddy; the tears that stream down her cheeks seem to wash her clean.",
      "Paris will kill Achilles?",
      "Paris who has half-tired of Helen now and never cared to defend her?",
      "Paris, selfish and vain and cowardly?",
      "That Paris, kill the most fearsome of the Achaeans--the most fearsome warrior that Troy has ever faced?",
      "Cassandra steadies Helen when her laughter unbalances her, holds her once the storm has died down to tired giggling.",

      "\"When I was just grown to womanhood I caught the eye of Apollo himself,\" Cassandra says, very slowly, as if she has to drag each word to her lips.",

    "text": "Imagine yourself where I am. Living in some stuffy neighborhood surrounded by equally stuffy people. All with tons of cash to burn and two point three kids to burn it on. Imagine being an only child in the loudest house on the block. Having no parent at home that gives a shit enough to check in except to say the bills were paid. Sounded pretty sweet to me, at the time. Oh, by the way, the name's Kara. Short for Makaria. My mom, before I was born, was obsessed with the occult. Like, worshiping the Greek gods. Anyway, I would totally consider myself a bit of a party-girl. Nothing makes me feel more alive that drinking Blue Waves until I pass out on the floor. Or grinding up against any girl or guy with their partner standing close by. Anyway, I pretty much look like every cheerleader you've ever seen. But, the kicker, I'm not a cheerleader. My amazing shiny brown hair, tone dancer's body, and the best looking--- My gray Siberian Husky jumped up onto the couch, knocking my laptop out of my hands. \"Dammit, Cerberus!\" Again, my mother's doing, not mine. He looked up at me with those big ol' eyes and licked my neck. I pushed him away as my phone buzzed next to me. \"What up?\" I said. \"It's Mom, Kara,\" she responded. \"Oh. What is it, Riley?\" She sighed. \"Why don't you call me 'Mom'?\" Silence as I fought down my angry retort. \"Just wanted to let you know the bills were paid today. There should be around $500 in the account.\" \"Yeah, thanks.\" I turned on the speaker and started to braid my hair. \"So, Kara, how-how are things back home?\" I was the one that sighed now. \"What difference does it make? I'm not starving and not sick.\" \"I know, Kara. I just wanted to check on you. I am still your mother, after all.\" \"Yeah, for about another year.\" The doorbell then rang, and Cerberus barked loudly. \"Listen, Riley, I'm gonna go now. Guess I'll talk to you next month.\" I hung up and walked over. I looked through the peep-hole and saw one of my closest friends, Kyra Michals. \"Hey, loser girl,\" I taunted. Unlike myself, Kyra was pretty boring. She never partied and she never drank. Basically, she just stayed locked in my room until after midnight. \"Thanks for the warm welcome, Kara. I really appreciate that,\" she sighed. \"So, Riley just called me.\" \"Oh, what did she say this time?\" \"Askin' me how I was. Whatever.\" I walked to the kitchen, and she followed. \"You wanna drink?\" \"Tea, please.\" I grabbed her drink and a beer for myself. \"I'm having a little get together tonight. You wanna sit in my bathroom this time?\" \"Whatever. I'll just look up the symptoms of alcoholic cardiomyopathy.\" One other thing, Kyra was a real nerd. Knew everything that involved everything. \"Whatever, Michals.\" I picked up my phone and called everyone. Starting with my current summer fling, Stallings. I paced around the kitchen, having called all 45 of my \"closest friends\", listening to Stallings' phone ring. I was trying him for the second time now, not having a clue what he could be doing that would make him ignore me. \"So... have you completed the Homer report yet?\" Kyra, my best friend and total opposite, asked me. She seemed to not be asking me, but reminding me of what I failed to do. Again. I stopped and covered the speaker of my phone with my hand. \"What report, Ky?\" I asked, pissed that she would remind me of my unworthiness. \"The book report where we had to read on of Homer's classics, either The Iliad or The Oddessy. You want me to sum them up for you?\" I was totally positive that she had both giant books memorized word for word. Handing her a piece of paper and a pen, I paced again as Stallings answered his phone. Finally, I thought. \"Hey, Kara,\" he said. I smirked and waved to Kyra, hinting that she better get to writing. \"Hey. Listen, I'm having another party... \" I began. \"You cut to the chase, don't you Willis?\" \"That's the only way I can get what I want these days.\" Kyra tapped the paper and walked over to the stove as the tea kettle whistled. I turned it around and peered at it through my thick fake eyelashes. The Iliad - Nine years after the Trojan War. There is a huge fight. The gods are separated into two sides, those with the Trojans (people who live in Troy) and Achilles (think Achilles Heel) and those with the Greek army. I would also explain the Oddessy, but I know it's way to complex for you. So I'll be in your sitting area typing your report if you need me. I silently thanked God for Kyra. Though she was a total head-case and not as popular as me, I always could count on her to do whatever I needed. She was very loyal. As she poured the hot water into her cup and walked into the den, I listened to Stallings breathing on the other line. \"So, are you coming or not?\" A pause. \"Sure. I'll be there.\" I smiled and hung up. \"Ky! What am I gonna wear?\" I walked into the den and watched her typing quickly on the laptop. She looked up out of the corner of her eye, but quickly did a double take. Her eyes were wide and she was looking over the top of my head. I lifted my head and saw a freaky looking ancient hat floating above me. I couldn't believe it. I figured I was crazy drunk. \"Oh-my-gods...\" Kyra whispered. She stood up and walked over to me, lightly placing her hands on my upper arms. I suddenly got confused and that made me very angry. \"What the hell is going on, Kyra?!\" I demanded. \"You've been claimed, Kara. Your father has admitted you as his own. Oh, this is bad. Honey, you're in a shitload of danger. Pardon my language.\" \"Wait, what? Father? You know better than to-\" \"You've just gotta trust me, Makaria. I'm gonna do my best to get you somewhere... um, safe.\" \"And where is that?!\" \"A camp for special kids like us.\" I was not in the mood for some cryptic words of wisdom from Kyra. Especially after she just watched my plan a huge party and then saw freaky fireworks appear over my head. Kyra went over to the front windows, watching as the sun slowly set. I continued to stand there, fuming. \"Kara, I'm afraid your party is going to have to be...postponed,\" she said softly. \"Postponed?!\" I yelled, watching her flinch. \"What the hell do you mean postponed?!\" \"Shh!\" She turned back to me, fear in her dark blue eyes. \"Please, Makaria, I don't have any time for this kind of nonsense.\" I could feel my anger rising inside of me and I had to force myself to not explode. She turned back to the window, still watching the sun. I could hear her mumbling to herself. I looked down at my feet in anger and saw Cerberus looking at me with a lopsided grin. That made me a bit happier. A bit. Then I thought about it. Kyra had said some special camp. What the hell was that all about? I suddenly got this crazy flash of blackness, like when the lights go out in a place. It really tripped me out. Cerberus started whimpering, but I waved my hand. Then it happened again. This time, the blackness lasted for a bit longer. Kyra was still staring out that window. I started to get a bit freaked out when I stopped blinking and the blackness happened anyways. \"K-kyra---\" ~~~~ I had not expected this. Normally, the Big Three wait a while before openly claiming their children. What was Hades thinking? If he was watching, which I'm sure he was, he knew we were way farther away from Camp Half-Blood than we needed to be. I think Kara continued to fume about having to miss her party. Things were much bigger than she could ever imagine. I watched the sun setting in the western sky, hoping to carch my father's eye in the most subtly way possible. Kyra, my ray of light. He said in my head. I could almost feel his eyes on me from so far away. What's wrong? Oh, my father, Kara has been claimed. I admitted, trying not to let my emotions get the better of me. I know, my sweet. What do you need of me? Even though it was a well-known rule our parents were forbidden from interfering with our lives as demi-gods, my father preferred me over my other siblings. That's how it was, though no God was willing to admit it. They preferred one child over the others they had sired and would break the rules for them if needed. I'm too far from Camp and there's no way for me to keep her safe long enough to get there. I need...safe and speedy travel. He sighed as though her were right there with me. He knew exactly who I needed help from. That is your favor to him, then? Yes, Father. Oh! And, may I ask something of you directly? Anything, my sweet. You know how volatile Kara can be, especially being Hades' claimed heir... Of course, Kyra. \"K-kyra---\" I heard behind me, followed by a thump. \"Kara?\" I asked, knowing very well she was passed out. Sometimes it paid to have the God of Prophecy as a father. Hermes has sent someone to your aid, my sweet. Thank you, Father. Expect my visit in a day's time so that we may discuss this new piece of information. Yes? Yes, sir. May your journey be blessed with smooth roads. \"Easier said than done,\" I said to myself. Once I turned around, I did indeed see Kara passed out on the floor, probably with a concussion the way the table had moved from it's original spot. Cerberus looked up to me, confused. I sat back on my knees and he trotted over. I rubbed his big head sadly. \"I'm afraid we can't take you with us this time, Cerberus. But, don't worry, I'll protect Kara.\" There was a sharp knock at the door and I panicked, my heart thundering in my chest. I peeked out the window and saw a taxi. I reached up and opened the door. The driver looked down at me, then over at Kara, then back at me. \"You call a cab?\" he asked. I nodded slowly. He coughed into his sleeve as he walked over, grabbing Kara into his arms. Cerberus started to growl, but I held his collar fast. When they passed the threshold, I grabbed his leash and led him to the neighbor's house. The young boy of about eight was playing outside, and now stood still as I approached him. \"Promise you'll take good care of Cerberus for us?\" I asked him bluntly. \"Sure thing!\" he replied, burying his head into Cerberus' thick fur. With someone new to play with, Cerberus stopped growling and licked the boy's face. \"Alright.\" I turned back to the Willis household and sighed. The taxi door slammed as Kara was set up in the back seat. The driver opened the passenger door for me from the inside. My heartbeat didn't slow as darkness descended upon us. I repeated the prayer my father had said earlier as I got in. For now, all we could hope is that Hades was otherwise preoccupied and wouldn't attack us. But, it was his daughter we were talking about.",

      "What is it, Riley?\"",
      "She sighed.",
      "\"Why don't you call me 'Mom'?\" Silence as I fought down my angry retort.",
      "\"Just wanted to let you know the bills were paid today.",
      "There should be around $500 in the account.\"",
      "\"Yeah, thanks.\"",
      "I turned on the speaker and started to braid my hair.",
      "\"So, Kara, how-how are things back home?\"",
      "I was the one that sighed now.",
      "\"What difference does it make?",
      "I'm not starving and not sick.\"",
      "\"I know, Kara.",
      "I just wanted to check on you.",
      "I am still your mother, after all.\"",
      "\"Yeah, for about another year.\"",
      "The doorbell then rang, and Cerberus barked loudly.",
      "\"Listen, Riley, I'm gonna go now.",
      "Guess I'll talk to you next month.\"",
      "I hung up and walked over.",
      "I looked through the peep-hole and saw one of my closest friends, Kyra Michals.",
      "\"Hey, loser girl,\" I taunted.",
      "Unlike myself, Kyra was pretty boring.",
      "She never partied and she never drank.",
      "Basically, she just stayed locked in my room until after midnight.",
      "\"Thanks for the warm welcome, Kara.",
      "I really appreciate that,\" she sighed.",
      "\"So, Riley just called me.\"",
      "\"Oh, what did she say this time?\" \"Askin' me how I was.",
      "Whatever.\"",
      "I walked to the kitchen, and she followed.",
      "\"You wanna drink?\" \"Tea, please.\"",
      "I grabbed her drink and a beer for myself.",
      "\"I'm having a little get together tonight.",
      "You wanna sit in my bathroom this time?\" \"Whatever.",
      "I'll just look up the symptoms of alcoholic cardiomyopathy.\"",
      "One other thing, Kyra was a real nerd.",
      "Knew everything that involved everything.",
      "\"Whatever, Michals.\"",
      "I picked up my phone and called everyone.",
      "Starting with my current summer fling, Stallings.",
      "I paced around the kitchen, having called all 45 of my \"closest friends\", listening to Stallings' phone ring.",
      "I was trying him for the second time now, not having a clue what he could be doing that would make him ignore me.",
      "\"So... have you completed the Homer report yet?\" Kyra, my best friend and total opposite, asked me.",
      "She seemed to not be asking me, but reminding me of what I failed to do.",
      "Again.",
      "I stopped and covered the speaker of my phone with my hand.",
      "\"What report, Ky?\" I asked, pissed that she would remind me of my unworthiness.",
      "\"The book report where we had to read on of Homer's classics, either The Iliad or The Oddessy.",
      "You want me to sum them up for you?\" I was totally positive that she had both giant books memorized word for word.",
      "Handing her a piece of paper and a pen, I paced again as Stallings answered his phone.",
      "Finally, I thought.",
      "\"Hey, Kara,\" he said.",
      "I smirked and waved to Kyra, hinting that she better get to writing.",
      "\"Hey.",
      "Listen, I'm having another party... \" I began.",
      "\"You cut to the chase, don't you Willis?\"",
      "\"That's the only way I can get what I want these days.\"",
      "Kyra tapped the paper and walked over to the stove as the tea kettle whistled.",
      "I turned it around and peered at it through my thick fake eyelashes.",
      "The Iliad - Nine years after the Trojan War.",
      "There is a huge fight.",
      "The gods are separated into two sides, those with the Trojans (people who live in Troy) and Achilles (think Achilles Heel) and those with the Greek army.",
      "I would also explain the Oddessy, but I know it's way to complex for you.",
      "So I'll be in your sitting area typing your report if you need me.",
      "I silently thanked God for Kyra.",
      "Though she was a total head-case and not as popular as me, I always could count on her to do whatever I needed.",
      "She was very loyal.",
      "As she poured the hot water into her cup and walked into the den, I listened to Stallings breathing on the other line.",
      "\"So, are you coming or not?\"",
      "A pause.",
      "\"Sure.",
      "I'll be there.\"",
      "I smiled and hung up.",
      "\"Ky!",
      "What am I gonna wear?\" I walked into the den and watched her typing quickly on the laptop.",
      "She looked up out of the corner of her eye, but quickly did a double take.",
      "Her eyes were wide and she was looking over the top of my head.",
      "I lifted my head and saw a freaky looking ancient hat floating above me.",
      "I couldn't believe it.",
      "I figured I was crazy drunk.",
      "\"Oh-my-gods...\" Kyra whispered.",
      "She stood up and walked over to me, lightly placing her hands on my upper arms.",
      "I suddenly got confused and that made me very angry.",
      "\"What the hell is going on, Kyra?!\"",
      "I demanded.",
      "\"You've been claimed, Kara.",
      "Your father has admitted you as his own.",
      "Oh, this is bad.",
      "Honey, you're in a shitload of danger.",
      "Pardon my language.\"",
      "\"Wait, what?",
      "Father?",
      "You know better than to-\" \"You've just gotta trust me, Makaria.",
      "I'm gonna do my best to get you somewhere... um, safe.\"",
      "\"And where is that?!\"",
      "\"A camp for special kids like us.\"",
      "I was not in the mood for some cryptic words of wisdom from Kyra.",
      "Especially after she just watched my plan a huge party and then saw freaky fireworks appear over my head.",
      "Kyra went over to the front windows, watching as the sun slowly set.",
      "I continued to stand there, fuming.",
      "\"Kara, I'm afraid your party is going to have to be...postponed,\" she said softly.",
      "\"Postponed?!\"",
      "I yelled, watching her flinch.",
      "\"What the hell do you mean postponed?!\"",
      "\"Shh!\"",
      "She turned back to me, fear in her dark blue eyes.",
      "\"Please, Makaria, I don't have any time for this kind of nonsense.\"",
      "I could feel my anger rising inside of me and I had to force myself to not explode.",
      "She turned back to the window, still watching the sun.",
      "I could hear her mumbling to herself.",
      "I looked down at my feet in anger and saw Cerberus looking at me with a lopsided grin.",
      "That made me a bit happier.",
      "A bit.",
      "Then I thought about it.",
      "Kyra had said some special camp.",
      "What the hell was that all about?",
      "I suddenly got this crazy flash of blackness, like when the lights go out in a place.",
      "It really tripped me out.",
      "Cerberus started whimpering, but I waved my hand.",
      "Then it happened again.",
      "This time, the blackness lasted for a bit longer.",
      "Kyra was still staring out that window.",
      "I started to get a bit freaked out when I stopped blinking and the blackness happened anyways.",
      "\"K-kyra---\" ~~~~ I had not expected this.",
      "Normally, the Big Three wait a while before openly claiming their children.",
      "What was Hades thinking?",
      "If he was watching, which I'm sure he was, he knew we were way farther away from Camp Half-Blood than we needed to be.",
      "I think Kara continued to fume about having to miss her party.",
      "Things were much bigger than she could ever imagine.",
      "I watched the sun setting in the western sky, hoping to carch my father's eye in the most subtly way possible.",
      "Kyra, my ray of light.",
      "He said in my head.",
      "I could almost feel his eyes on me from so far away.",
      "What's wrong?",
      "Oh, my father, Kara has been claimed.",
      "I admitted, trying not to let my emotions get the better of me.",
      "I know, my sweet.",
      "What do you need of me?",
      "Even though it was a well-known rule our parents were forbidden from interfering with our lives as demi-gods, my father preferred me over my other siblings.",
      "That's how it was, though no God was willing to admit it.",
      "They preferred one child over the others they had sired and would break the rules for them if needed.",
      "I'm too far from Camp and there's no way for me to keep her safe long enough to get there.",
      "I need...safe and speedy travel.",
      "He sighed as though her were right there with me.",
      "He knew exactly who I needed help from.",
      "That is your favor to him, then?",
      "Yes, Father.",
      "Oh!",
      "And, may I ask something of you directly?",
      "Anything, my sweet.",
      "You know how volatile Kara can be, especially being Hades' claimed heir...",
      "Of course, Kyra.",
      "\"K-kyra---\" I heard behind me, followed by a thump.",
      "\"Kara?\" I asked, knowing very well she was passed out.",
      "Sometimes it paid to have the God of Prophecy as a father.",
      "Hermes has sent someone to your aid, my sweet.",
      "Thank you, Father.",
      "Expect my visit in a day's time so that we may discuss this new piece of information.",
      "Yes?",
      "Yes, sir.",
      "May your journey be blessed with smooth roads.",
      "\"Easier said than done,\" I said to myself.",
      "Once I turned around, I did indeed see Kara passed out on the floor, probably with a concussion the way the table had moved from it's original spot.",
      "Cerberus looked up to me, confused.",
      "I sat back on my knees and he trotted over.",
      "I rubbed his big head sadly.",
      "\"I'm afraid we can't take you with us this time, Cerberus.",
      "But, don't worry, I'll protect Kara.\"",
      "There was a sharp knock at the door and I panicked, my heart thundering in my chest.",
      "I peeked out the window and saw a taxi.",
      "I reached up and opened the door.",
      "The driver looked down at me, then over at Kara, then back at me.",
      "\"You call a cab?\" he asked.",
      "I nodded slowly.",
      "He coughed into his sleeve as he walked over, grabbing Kara into his arms.",
      "Cerberus started to growl, but I held his collar fast.",
      "When they passed the threshold, I grabbed his leash and led him to the neighbor's house.",
      "The young boy of about eight was playing outside, and now stood still as I approached him.",
      "\"Promise you'll take good care of Cerberus for us?\" I asked him bluntly.",
      "\"Sure thing!\"",
      "he replied, burying his head into Cerberus' thick fur.",
      "With someone new to play with, Cerberus stopped growling and licked the boy's face.",
      "\"Alright.\"",
      "I turned back to the Willis household and sighed.",
      "The taxi door slammed as Kara was set up in the back seat.",
      "The driver opened the passenger door for me from the inside.",
      "My heartbeat didn't slow as darkness descended upon us.",
      "I repeated the prayer my father had said earlier as I got in.",
      "For now, all we could hope is that Hades was otherwise preoccupied and wouldn't attack us.",
      "But, it was his daughter we were talking about."

    "text": "Hecate walked down the dark hall towards her rooms, pulling the pins from her hair one by one as she went. She was exhausted, but her footsteps were surprisingly light. Her polecat trailed along at her heels, looking incredibly pleased with herself. Hecate's hair fell down her back freely with the removal of the final pin. She pushed open the door to her rooms, fiddling with knots and clasps in a great desire to be free of her clothing soon. A long soak in the tub sounded like heaven. A massage sounded even better, but she wanted to be alone just now. Still, she had some lotions that would have nearly the same effect. Any relaxation would be temporary, but that didn't mean she hadn't earned the right to it. The Underworld was a complete mess, and a lot of the burden of holding it all together had fallen on her shoulders. Some of that was gone now that Thanatos was back, thank the stars, but it would still be some time before things were really back to normal--especially with his lordship and his better half so discombobulated. Once the former was capable of signing off on it, she was going to demand a bonus. \"No--Gale, no.\" Her flatulent polecat had made herself comfortable on Hecate's pillow. \"Get down! You are not sleeping in my bed tonight.\" There was a light knock at her door, which she'd left mostly open. \"You're not sleeping in my bed tonight either, Thanat--oh.\" When she turned, she found herself facing not her favorite winged sourpuss but his lordship himself. He looked stable for the moment--Roman, but stable. His mouth was slightly open, like he wanted to speak but the words wouldn't come. Normally Hecate would take the opportunity to tell him he looked like a fairly unattractive fish, but for once she took pity on him. Now was not the time. She knew what he wanted to say, and knew that if she waited for him to actually say it, they would be standing there staring at one another all night--and the tub was calling her name. So instead she said, \"You should be very proud.\" There was an almost imperceptible exhalation, and an even more subtle quirking up of the corners of his mouth. \"So...\" \"She was brilliant. Almost as brilliant as me. She and her friends are all alive and well and ready for the home stretch.\" His smile broadened into what on most faces could be properly termed a grin. \"Whoa, rein it in,\" Hecate teased, holding her hands up as if to ward him off. \"These overt displays of joyful emotion are starting to weird me out.\" He rolled his eyes and turned to leave, but hesitated. \"Really... thank you.\" She smiled at him. \"Just remember your gratitude next time salary negotiations come around.\" He shook his head and left in earnest this time, pulling the door shut behind him. Hecate shrugged and went back to undressing. She had gotten pretty good at forging his signature by now anyway.",

Oh youth, how foolishly brave you are in the prime of your years. You think the world cradles you, that nothing can harm your strength. Even as you look upon my aged and crumpled form it does not strike your thoughts that one day you shall be as I. You shout to the world in loud tones, a challenge to all. My whispering does not reach your ears. Or rather you will not listen to my words of caution and restraint. Carefully I pour the wax on each joint. Making our escape plans while you dream only of freedom. Not for you the details of how we shall go. No, you do not see the rocks below, only the sky. And I, I cannot force you down from the clouds. Although I may warn you of the dangers, even my aged heart yearns for such thoughts. And so my words are not backed with intent. We must wait, I tell you, for each feather to be placed and molded together. But you are all impatient energy. Father, you call me, yet my caution is the iron on your limbs. I see the desire in your eyes as you whisper promises to the sky. And finally, finally the day arrives when all is finished. Icarus, I warn, we must wait for the sun too take it's nightly journey. But it is too late and you have grasped the false wings and thrown yourself out of the window. I must follow the young, as is always the case. I catch the wind, trying to reach him. But he is flying higher and higher, straining to reach new heights. Icarus remember, I shout, though you have the wings of a young hawk, keep in mind that they are made from chicken feathers. You ignore me. The foolish tones of an old man are beneath your notice. Now, you think, you can reach the sun. I look up at your wings. Watching them as one by one the feathers begin to fall. And you, my only son, you strain to continue higher until it is only your arms reaching out. You flew too close to the sun, I mourn as I drop down to close the eyes of the broken body on the rocks. My son, I pray Zeus will make you a hawk in the next life.",

    "text": "1) \"Firefly\" Inspired \"Take the bridge\" Artemis told Atalanta. The pilot rolled her eyes before heading back to take the wheel. \"Opis!\" Artemis called to her lieutenant,busy shining a gun. \"We need to land and get passengers.\" Opis smirked.\"Maybe if we hadn't kicked Callisto out for being a companion -\" Artemis's eyes narrowed. \"There's a reason I named this ship 'Huntress'. We follow the rules of nature. Not the laws of man. Which means I'm not letting some prostitute legitimize us just because the government says so.\" She turned to head down to the cargo hold. \"Yet Hippolytus is on board. And you used the exact same reasoning once for why we couldn't have men on the ship. Said it made us look like we needed protection or something.\" \"...he's different.\" Opis knew better than to point how being gay didn't exactly make Hippolytus a woman. But Artemis's logic was still seriously flawed.\"We need a mechanic - what if a man's the best one for the job?\" Artemis set her mouth in a firm line. \"He Won't be.\" ___________________________________________________________________ Unfortunately \"Orion\" was the best for the job. At least on 3 planets. And they didn't have time to stop off on any more border planets without taking on a decent job. Not with far too many people watching their tail. And he just had to be handsome too. Now she had to watch the girls. ___________________________________________________________________ Reavers. Oh, dear god. And everything was in chaos - and how was she going to protect her crew (No longer \"her girls\", when did that happen?) Atalanta flew them through - faster than anything she'd ever done before - a tactical maneuver that involved her hiding behind three moons (It would get named after her one day). Orion got injured. Why was she the only one who cared? It was like it happened in slow motion - a stray harpoon jettisoning through the window when they landed. It scraped his side, but they didn't have time to stop long. \"If you die on me - \" she warned, eyes narrowing fiercely on the man in the medical bed, \" I'll give you the worst eulogy ever.\" \"Not going to happen.\" He whispered, and squeezed her hand. It was only when a drop of water fell on his cheek that she realized she was crying. 2) I Spy Working for Zeus, of O.L.Y.M.P.U.S. was great fun, if you got past the every day unloading of misogyny from the higher ups. Which might be why she sometimes did her own work. There was something soothing in vigilantism. The feel of a repellar gun tight in her hand (only $1000 on the black market, and boy was she lucky for it) and the fact that she wore white and those freaking rapists were scared for it. She thought of leaving an A in fire behind when she bashed their faces in and left them for the \"rightful authorities\". But she was better than that. Good enough to wear white, tie them up, and not get caught. Be a legend that wasn't a legend. Which was why the man known only as \"The Hunter\", getting more press and imitating her style, was becoming a threat. And why her brother had been urged to take him down. \"You're the best marksman, Apollo.\" Zeus had said, and she'd seethed. It was too bad. She was even beginning to like the guy. He paid a weird, sweet, kind of tribute with every hit. Writing \"FOR HER\" in red spray paint over each group of tied up thugs. Too bad he didn't understand \"not interested\". As in, 'chaste due to chosen profession, thanks'. \"You're late.\" He said when she finally found him. \"I'm never late.\" Her boots clanked hard when she jumped off the roof top to land behind him in the alley. \"You're in trouble.\" \"Just 'cuz I'm not in your special CIA group?\" His eyebrow quirked. \"Please.\" \"No. You'd get in though.\" He ducked his head, with the blush reserved only for her as decoration. \"You're just sloppy.\" \"How else was I supposed to get your attention?\" Artemis rolled her eyes. Of course she had to save him now. 3) The Coffee Shop Artemis would rather work at Dick's sporting goods. She considered writing that on her name tag, but apparently Starbucks didn't think its baristas should speak their minds along with their names. She got the job from her brother (of course) because...well... \"OHMIGODIGOTTHENIGHTSHIFT, WHATARETHEYCRAZY? ITOOK10CUPSOFCOFFEEBUTISTILLFEELREALLY -\" and then Apollo cut off. Largely because he went unconscious due a little something called \"adrenal exhaustion\". And so she ended up working the night shift to cover for him. That didn't mean she actually had to write her real name on her tag, though. \"KILLYOUNOW\" worked just as well. And that typically meant any potential customers - typically drunk off their rocker kids once the shift was toward ending - instead turned their heads toward Selene and asked very quietly for their Mocha Lattes. This guy, though? He seemed a little too preoccupied to even notice her name tag foreshadowed his imminent demise. He didn't even order a caffeine product with a nigh unpronounceable name. \"Have you ever just, questioned your life?\" He ran a hand through shaggy dark hair and then focused on her, \"What you've done for the past 5 years of your life?\" Artemis blinked. \"About as much as I think about the taser my apron's front pocket.\" She smiled at him. \" It would take me less than 2.5 seconds to shock you through your skull and dump your body in the trash outside\". To his credit, he laughed in a way that wasn't patronizing. \"Sorry. It's just...\" he trailed off. After a pause, he looked up at her again, \"Good reflexes.\" \"It's what I do.\" He smiled and this time, it reached his eyes. \"What's your real name?\" He asked. \"Yours first.\" \"Orion.\" She gave him a cup of coffee on the house. Now) \"Sun, Moon, Stars, Rain\" The 1960's were not a good time. First of all, free love was probably the worst thing to happen to feminism while at it's final, glorious, onset and secondly, people were planning to land on the moon. Her moon. The stars were clouding from so much pollution. Artemis was angry. \"Oh, Artemis, darling!\" Great. What now? \"Aphrodite.\" \"Aren't these a wondrous times? The whole place just zings of rebirth - oh, did I tell you?\" Artemis began tuning her out. Stopping only when she heard \"Orion\". \"What?\" \"Oh, dear, your brother found him,\" Aphrodite lightly touched her arm. She didn't even shrug her off in her shock. \"Wanted to be an astronaut, the crazy man.\" The goddess of love's eyes slightly softened, momentarily bringing her to her former glory. ___________________________________________________________________ \"You're not growing old, you know.\" She informed him. \"That a fact, my lady?\" He looked different now. His skin was a few shades darker, for one. His hair a bit curlier. But his eyes were the exact same shade of brown. She fell back into their old arguments. It was easy. \"I'm not your lady.\" \"Never were.\" Gods, he was beautiful. There was a lump in her throat. \"I'm sorry.\" He blinked, startled. Kissed her brief, hard, still tasting the same. \"Too bad,\" He murmured into her mouth, \"You're beautiful when you're unapologetic.\" \"I love you.\" Artemis mumbled back. \"But you're crazy.\" \"Ah, there she is...\"",

    "text": "The sun was high up in the sky on that fateful day. It wasn't any different to the previous days; the heat still bore down on the mortals making it unbearable to walk outside for the fear of suffering heat stroke and sunburn. But for the Gods and Goddesses of Mount Olympus the sun was reason to relax, to waste away a lazy summers day bathing themselves in it's golden light. One of these Goddesses was the young Persephone, daughter of Zeus, king of the Gods, and Demeter, Goddess of grain and fertility. Persephone's mother was extremely protective of her; she was rarely permitted to visit Mount Olympus and many of the Grecian cities. Instead Persephone was kept out of both eyes of Mortals and Immortals. She lived in the forests, her company mostly consisted of nymphs. On this fateful day however Persephone had abondoned company, preferring to enjoy the sun and it's warmth by herself. *** Persephone sat beside a small river, a waterfall a little to her left sent rippling motions across the water's surface and for a a while she simply sat there admiring the effect. She was dressed in a simple white silk toga that draped over her left shoulder leaving her right one bare. Her midnight black hair was pinned up in an elegant bun secured with a golden circlet, to a mortal the gold was unbendable, to a god it was like mere elastic. She had discarded her sandals earlier preparing to walk barefoot when in the forest. A small sigh escaped the young goddess's rose coloured lips, she was fed up of being alone. She had no real companions, the nymphs were friendly and fun...but they lacked adventure and a sense of humour. They spent most days sitting around gossiping, the most adventure Persephone had was to collect flowers. She enjoyed doing this, she admired their beauty and their delicious scents...but it was hardly something that sent adrenaline pumping. She craved new surroundings. New companions. Instead she was confined to the forest to keep her out of sight of males, her mother was too protective and didn't want her daughter getting a reputation of any sort! As if I cannot look after myself, Persephone thought bitterly. I'm eighteen! I'm a goddess! I'm hardly a defenceless damsel in distress! She had long ago stopped rebelling against her mother's over-protectiveness, she knew a lost battle when she saw one. And this had been one of them. Standing up Persephone looked around to make sure the area really was empty, she was hot and longed to cool down - the clear water of the river was too tempting and she was going to give in to it's calling. She slipped her toga off, placed her golden bracelets and choker on top of it and carefully stepped into the water, soon she was submerged so that only her chin upwards was free of the water. She laughed and swam a few lengths back and forth, enjoying the cool water and imagining her troubled thoughts flowing away with the current. She became so absorbed in swimming she didn't notice the slow change in the weather, how the clouds seemed to appear from nowhere sending a slow and steady darkness across the land. Hades had no purpose for leaving the Underworld that day; he had merely grown bored with the Underworld setting. Of being constantly pestered by souls who begged for their lives back, for one more chance to prove that they were worthy of life. It got tiresome after a while. Occasionally it was nice to get above ground, Olympus was too bright and he found the gossip of his fellows Gods and Goddesses tiresome. Unlike them he had a full-time job and didn't have the luxury of lounging around Olympus all day and night! The sound of splashing caught his attention; a grin twisted his surprisingly handsome features. For a God who spent so much time in the Underworld he was surprisingly tanned. His hair was a deep jet black, his eyes were just as black and some would say emotionless. People could stare for centuries into those bottomless orbs and not see a glimmer of emotion. That was if they dared. Not many people were brave enough to look Hades in the eyes; he wasn't one for tolerating defiance. He was clothed in a pair of black trousers and a black shirt, keeping to the shadows his dark figure was easily hidden as he spied the beauty swimming in the lake. He was expecting to find a mortal, or maybe even a nymph. He wasn't expecting to see the beautiful Persephone, nor was he expecting to find her swimming bare. He turned away surprised at himself, it wasn't his fault if the young woman had chosen to swim naked where anyone could spy on her! Still...he felt as if watching her would spoil something...but what he had no idea. A small plot was forming in his mind; he was lonely in the Underworld and female companionship would make things better. Of course she probably wouldn't be willing, not at first anyway. He turned away and walked deeper into the shadows, purposely stepping on dry twigs so that they crunched under his feet. As he walked he focused on the change of weather, it would be best if the residents of Mount Olympus did not witness this. *** Persephone looked up startled at the sound of cracking twigs and crunching leaves, someone was nearby! She swam towards the back of the river and leapt out, her skin drying almost instantly. It wasn't until she turned her face to look at the sun that she realised the sky had changed from a brilliant azure blue to steel grey, the ground was covered in shadows and the still air was beginning to pick up into a strong wind. This can't be a sign of good things to come, Persephone thought a sensation of fear creeping into the pit of her stomach. There was an unnatural feel to the air; this was no ordinary change in the weather. Her mind turned back to the sound of snapping twigs and she walked closer towards the trees, peering into the darkness to see if she could spot whoever had been there. It might not have even been a person; she tried to tell herself that it could have been a rabbit or a deer. But she knew it had to be a person. The urge to call out was strong but she kept quiet, she didn't know whether this person was friend or foe and she didn't want to put herself in unnecessary danger. She was more than capable of looking after herself, she was a goddess after all, but she didn't like hurting people. Besides...what if whoever was making all that noise was connected to the on-coming storm? She looked down at her feet, a small bundle of flowers lay blooming, their petals wide open and they seemed to mourn for the sun that had disappeared behind the clouds. She leant down and picked one up, she lifted it from the ground but instead of dying the flower seemed to move towards her. The petals moved gently as if in a wave and Persephone lowered her nose to breathe in the calming sweet scent. She often picked flowers; they comforted her and soothed her worried nerves as this flower was doing right now. It gave her the strength to walk deeper into the forest. *** Hades grinned as he watched Persephone drawing closer to where he was hiding; well hiding wasn't really the word for it. More waiting. As she drew closer to him he slipped behind a tree and approached her from behind. He wasn't worried about her recognising him; they had never met face to face. Of course Hades had seen her; sometimes the coming and goings of his fellow deities could affect the population of his Underworld. However Persephone had never added to it, in fact Hades had noticed she was often kept away from any kind of civilisation. \"Is it safe for someone as beautiful as yourself to be wandering the forests unescorted?\" He almost laughed as the young goddess jumped. \"Forgive me I didn't mean to startle you,\" he leant forward in a light bow. \"Allow me to introduce myself, my name is Damien.\" He held out his hand. \"Persephone,\" the young goddess replied taking his almost shyly, her eyes looking him up and down discreetly. Hades brought her hand to his lips and brushed them along it gently. He could smell roses radiating from her skin, she smelt like summer and spring...she smelt of life, warm, fragrant and sweet. She would certainly brighten up the Underworld. \"May I be permitted to ask as to why you are wandering alone?\" \"I felt like a walk, some fresh air to clear my head.\" He noticed her casual reply, he could tell she was silently judging whether she should trust him or not. He was going to have to work fast. His chariot was nearby, close to the clearing that led towards the city of Athens, if he could get her close to it... \"Please, allow me to accompany you - it is not safe for you to be wandering around on your own.\" He could see she wanted to refuse, that she was opening her mouth to that very thing. Quickly Hades acted on his feet, he knew little about Persephone - but he knew she was kind. And kind people did not generally like to offend. \"I would never forgive myself if you refused and something was to happen to you, please permit me to walk you to the clearing at least.\" He could see her battling against the decision, but soon a small nervous smile broke out on her face and she nodded in acceptance. *** Persephone was careful to keep a slight distance between herself and Damien, she didn't know why she didn't trust him...she just had a feeling. You're being paranoid, she scolded herself, he's done nothing to harm you - made no movements or given you any indication that he has intentions of hurting you. Mentally she shook her head; her mother's paranoia of someone violating her daughter was beginning to rub off on her. As they neared the clearing a small splash of colour caught her eye. Smiling she paused walking and knelt down to pick up the blood red flower that grew out of the ground, it seemed lonely and she thought it strange that it was the only one there. She plucked it from the ground intending it as a gift to thank Damien for walking her this far. Yet when she picked it the ground beneath her opened up, strong arms encircled her waist and she felt herself thrown into a carriage she sworn had not been there only a moment ago. It had been too easy. The flower had been one of the trick ones he had carefully lying around, they were spelled so that only people he wished to see them would see them. At that moment Persephone had been one of them, in her moment of confusion when the ground split open he had acted. His right arm had snaked around her slender waist; the feeling of her warm body against his gave him a sense of pleasure - when had been the last time he'd held a woman close? Although this wasn't quite the same, holding a kicking woman was quite different to holding a lover. He threw her into the carriage, a little more forcefully than he wished but the force of collision momentarily stunned her giving him time to climb into the carriage and get it in motion. \"Who are you?!\" Persephone cried as the carriage lurched forward, the horse like creatures that pulled it in motion leapt into the air and dived into the trench she had created. Hades looked at her, for a moment he felt a flicker of pity - she looked scared and betrayed. \"If you spent time on Olympus you would know me by sight. But I'm sure you know my name,\" he took his time to speak waiting for the chariot to land in the Underworld before giving her a full explanation. He pulled her up gently and helped her from the chariot. \"My name is Hades,\" he said as a loud rumbling noise filled the air. He watched as Persephone looked around, only at the last second did her eyes tilt upwards to the ceiling where she witnessed the edges of the ground above them moving closer together. Slowly darkness descended upon them, a chill swept through them - there would be no sun down here to keep her warm. \"Hades?\" She whispered the name questioningly as her eyes turned from the ceiling back towards him. \"Lord of the Underworld?\" He nodded and plucked the blood red flower from her fingertips placing it in the centre of her bun. The flower she had picked at first was clutched in her left hand, her knuckles white with terror. Yet this was the only sign of fear she showed. Her body didn't tremble, her eyes betrayed no flicker of fear and her voice was sturdy as she spoke. \"Why did you bring me here?\" \"Isn't it obvious?\" Persephone stared at him openly shocked - what sort of question was that to ask? How was the purpose of any abduction obvious?! Before she could voice an angry opinion Hades explained. \"I know that your mother keeps you away from prying eyes, secludes you from all company except for that of Nymphs and woodland creatures -\" \"I can see why if this is what would happen if I were to mingle openly!\" She snapped. Hades carried on as if he had not been interrupted. \"You're lonely; you long for conversation - for intelligent conversation, not just the mindless natter of the Nymphs.\" He took a step closer to her, his hand cupping her chin holding her head firmly so she couldn't look away from him. \"I crave company, we are in similar positions. I am trapped, charged with a duty I didn't wish to have. Kept away from all kinds of company, the only companionship I have is begging souls - mindlessly pleading for something I cannot grant them.\" \"So you abduct me? What do you hope to gain?\" She tried to shake her head free from his grip but he held her firmly. \"True companionship, a wife.\" He ignored her scoff, in time she'd accept that this was meant to be. Gently he released her face and she tore the flower from her hair throwing it at him angrily. The gold band holding her bun in place came free with the flower and her midnight black hair tumbled around her, cascading down her shoulders and waist in a silky river. Hades was mesmerised, she was beautiful... He reached for her suddenly, ensnaring her in an unbreakable grip, his lips descended onto hers. She was losing control of her fear, he could taste it on her lips as he kissed her, he could feel her breaking out in a cold sweat and he couldn't help the cruel grin as he broke the kiss but kept hold of her. \"You should just accept this Persephone,\" he whispered lowering his lips to hers once more. He stopped barely a centimetre away from her mouth, leaving her in fear of another kiss. \"You cannot fight me, here your powers are worthless - and the more you use them the more they'll drain from you. A little precaution to stop souls escaping, only the Lord of the Underworld has use of his full powers. You may as well be mortal.\" If she behaved perhaps he would tell her about the Olympus stone, the stone that protected Gods and Goddesses from the draining power of the Underworld. When he could trust her he would go and fetch it for her, but only when he could trust she would not try to escape. \"You're lying.\" She knew she was clinging to a false hope, she could feel herself weakening slowly. She stepped away from him and looked up at the ceiling, even if she wasn't being drained of her powers she didn't really have the power to open the ceiling. She was a goddess of spring, of living things...of beauty. Her powers here would have been useless anyway. She stepped over to a wall and rested her hand on it, concentrating on a small spot of the rock she willed a flower to grow. Normally this would happen in the blink of an eye, now it seemed to take an age. The flower seemed hesitant, as if it didn't want to grow - something Persephone couldn't blame it for. Who'd want to grow here? After an age the flower finally finished blooming, for a moment Hades found himself admiring the rose. But then the Underworlds own magic took hold. The flower wilted and crumbled to ash on the floor at the young goddess's feet. \"Your powers will adapt.\" \"When?\" That was a question Hades didn't want to answer right now. \"When?\" \"Only the Lord of the Underworld has full powers in the Underworld, as is his right. If he wishes his wife may have full control over her full powers, or a portion of them.\" He watched as the words took meaning to Persephone. Her flawless creamy skin drained of all colour, she looked as if she had been confronted by the Gorgon sister Medusa. \"Wife?\" She whispered her sapphire eyes slowly looking into his, searching his face for the smallest trace that would confirm this as a lie. \"No. I won't marry you!\" Hades laughed cruelly, he didn't even try to bite it back. \"Do you really think you have a choice in this? Do you think I would bring you down here just for you to say no and go back above?\" He shook his head and reached out to grab her once more. \"You can lie to me, tell me you were happy being forced to stay hidden - but we both know it is nothing more than a lie. Besides, why should I be the only one forced to live down here? Do you really think I enjoy being surrounded by death constantly? Do you think I enjoy spending an eternity by myself?\" \"You can't force me to marry you!\" \"I can force you to do pretty much anything I want.\" Hades hissed at her, his black eyes blazing angrily. How dare she try and defy him? She was in his domain! Roughly he pushed her against the wall and began ripping at her toga, ignoring her screams of protest and pleading he didn't stop until it was shredded and she was left clutching desperately at the fabric to cover herself. \"I can claim you right here, I can take you right now - or any time I wish. Never forget that Persephone.\" His anger was clear, the young goddess was truly terrified now. Blinking back tears she nodded faintly once. The sight of her eyes shining seemed to calm Hades down, he found himself in admiration of her. Any mortal damsel would be sobbing at his feet pleading for mercy, yet here she was...scared witless yet still trying to remain in control of herself. As quickly as it had come his anger subsided. Sighing he tugged off his black shirt and held it out to her. \"The only thing I cannot force you to do is love me.\" He said quietly as she took the offered shirt and pulled it over her head. He was so much taller than her the shirt stopped halfway above her knees, and although it was a short-sleeve shirt on him it went past her elbows almost. \"But I hope that is something you can learn to do in time.\" The look in her eyes told him she doubted this would happen, he didn't blame her but he could always help. \"Come. Let me show you to your room.\" He held out his hand for her to take, instead she scooped up the shredded toga and clutched it tightly. Sighing Hades turned and hoped that she would at least follow. Persephone followed him reluctantly, she didn't want to be shown to any rooms - she wanted to go home. How could she have been angry at her mother when at least she was kept confined to beautiful areas? There was nothing beautiful about the Underworld! She tugged the shirt self-consciously and continued clutching her torn toga, why was she holding onto it? He'd shredded it beyond repair, yet she didn't want to let go. It was as if the toga symbolised her freedom...let go of the toga and she would let go of her freedom. \"For now these will be your rooms.\" Hades gently guided her into a large room and Persephone looked around. It was depressing. The walls were stone. The floors were stone. She wandered over to the double bed and tapped it gently with her feet. Stone. She sat down on it and back a sigh - the mattress was feather soft and seemed immune to the feeling of stone beneath it. \"What do you think?\" Persephone looked at him bitterly thinking it best not to answer. \"What do you mean these are my rooms 'for now'?\" \"When we're married -\" \"We're not going to be married.\" She flinched as Hades looked at her with menacing eyes, she looked down at the shredded toga and decided to keep her mouth shut from now on. \"When we're married,\" he continued in a low and dangerous voice - daring her to interrupt him once more. \"You will obviously sleep with me in my quarters. The move won't be too far,\" he smiled and Persephone could have sworn his eyes glittered cruelly. He walked over to the wall to the left side of the door; it was now she noticed the black door. He opened it to give her a glimpse of what was beyond it. \"I want to be close, in case you get scared.\" Persephone didn't believe him - she knew she wasn't meant to believe him either. Bowing mockingly Hades stepped into his own rooms and shut the door behind him. Persephone stood up and wandered around the room. It was neither large nor small, it was just...reasonable was the only word she could think to describe it. He didn't want to keep her locked up like a prisoner, but he didn't want to spoil her with luxuries. Maybe he thought if she saw how much more luxurious his rooms were he thought he'd win her over? Fat chance. There was a small en-suite and she was half tempted to run a bath and just drown herself. Until she remembered she was a goddess and couldn't die...still a hot bath was tempting. She studied the decor of the bathroom, once again it was stone. Everything was depressing grey stone... Trudging back into the bedroom Persephone couldn't hold back the emotion she'd tried so hard to conceal from Hades. Bursting into tears she collapsed onto the bed and buried her face into the black silk pillow to muffle her sobs. *** Hades could hear the muffled sobs in his room, he felt pity for the young goddess - even though it was his fault she was in that state. If only she'd seen things from his perspective! They were two of a kind, both confined to areas although she did have the more luxurious setting. Sighing Hades pulled on a fresh shirt and rubbed his face wearily. He was going to have to think of a way to keep her down in the Underworld. Her disappearance would soon be noticed, it was only a matter of time before it was discovered he'd abducted her. Then what? Eventually he'd have to give in and return her, he knew that. Unless he found a way that bound her to the Underworld. Marriage would bind her to him, but it wouldn't mean she'd have to stay in the Underworld by law. Think, he told himself sternly. He knew the answer; he was just lacking the concentration to think of it right now! He strolled down to the kitchens where various minions were beginning to prepare dinner. \"There'll be an extra person dining tonight.\" He barked at them, suppressing a grin as they all jumped surprised and frightened by his presence. It was here he had an idea. Pomegranates. The seeds of the fruit bound anyone to the Underworld...if only he could get her to eat some he could bind her here forever. But was that fair? If she ate twelve she'd never be allowed to leave...would she ever love him if he trapped her here for eternity? He could lie and say he hadn't known the seeds were being added to the food...and why shouldn't she believe him? If he went back to her now she couldn't accuse him of slipping them into the food. Smiling grimly he relayed his orders and departed for Persephone's rooms. *** \"You shouldn't be so sad.\" Persephone leapt up from the bed hurriedly wiping away the tears, she would not act like some helpless damsel in distress when he was around! She would not show any weakness! \"Don't you knock?\" She snapped at him angrily crossing her arms over her chest, her hands still clutching the destroyed toga. She saw Hades look towards the toga and he shook his head sighing. \"Not in my own domain, why should I? Are you going to throw that thing away? You're sensible enough to know it's destroyed.\" Persephone had no reply for this - what could she say? She didn't want to throw away the remnants of her freedom? \"Persephone please, I want you to be happy here. I truly do.\" He walked towards her and cupped her chin gently. \"You're not trapped...not really. Yes you're confined to the Underworld, but above your mother kept you confined to forests and areas with no human contact. Here you're free to speak to whoever you wish.\" He neglected to mention she would have very few people to talk to. He walked closer to her and placed his hands on her slender waist. Her hips felt so gloriously soft, they seemed to mould themselves to his hands perfectly. Mentally he cursed the fabric of the shirt that stood between his hands and her hips acting as some sort of protective barrier. Before she could protest his lips descended onto hers and he kissed her hungrily. His right hand slipped around and rested on her lower back, gently pushing her against him he deepened the kiss and studied her face intently. What he saw gave him a small triumphant feeling. There was conflict in her eyes. It would be easy to surrender to him, give in to the kiss and accept this new life. But how could she accept this life? A life of darkness? A life of...death? She pushed away at last and looked up at him. \"I -\" \"Accept this life Persephone.\" She heard the pleading in his voice. \"I can't.\" She said quietly biting back tears once more. \"Please...Hades just...go away. Please.\" She was thankful he did. What had just happened? How could she have so easily given into a kiss? What was wrong with her?! She sat on the bed and wiped her eyes angrily. It was just a momentary lapse of weakness. Nothing more. Time passed slowly in the Underworld. Persephone wasn't sure how long she'd been in the bedroom, she had curled up into a small tight ball and stared at the wall ahead blankly. The sound of soft knocking didn't register, she didn't even blink in acknowledgement. \"Persephone?\" She heard Hades step into the room softly. \"Dinner is ready.\" \"I'm not hungry.\" She said quietly. \"You have to eat.\" \"Why?\" For the first time in hours she moved, her head turned to look at Hades a dark look on her face. \"I won't die, I won't starve to death or suffer from malnutrition. So why do I have to eat?\" She bit back a grim smile at the surprised look on Hades face, obviously he hadn't expected her to argue back over a simple matter as food. \"I know you're angry,\" he walked over to her and gently wrapped his hands around her wrist. Carefully he pulled her up so she was standing upright. \"But why stay here staring at the wall? Come to the dining room at least, you might change your mind when you see what we have.\" Silently she followed him, keeping a few paces behind and staring at the ground mutinously. Hades pulled out a chair for her, for a split second she thought about refusing and taking another chair. Except there were none. The only other chair was at the opposite end of the table and it was clearly a throne - she dared not sit there. She took the seat wordlessly; she couldn't even bring herself to look at her captor. She realised now this was what she saw him as. As he took the throne like chair opposite her servants began bringing in food. The servants reminded her of nymphs except less...lively. Their skin was a dull grey, they had deep black hair all the same shoulder length and cut in the same straight plain style. The nymphs Persephone had mixed with had prided themselves on their appearances; they were beautiful and exotic creatures. The nymphs...they were plain, she felt sorry for them. Was it living in the Underworld that did this? Would she turn into something like this? \"These are the shadows of former nymphs.\" Hades explained seeing the look in her eyes as Persephone stared at the empty plate in front of her. The table was by now full of delicious smelling foods; fish, beef, pork, duck and wild board let of an attempting aroma. Salads, rice, bread, butter and cheese were all spread along the table. Persephone could feel her stomach beginning to growl - she was hungry. Hades stood up as she remained motionless and began to put a sample of each of the dishes onto her plate, her poured a liberal amount of sauce and salad onto the plate. \"What harm can one bite do? You know better than to fear poisoning.\" \"I've not forgotten what I am - do you think I could forget I will never die?\" She asked him sourly, she was beginning to resent her Goddess status. If she was truly stuck here...it would be forever. Sighing she stabbed a piece of pork covered in the sauce and added some salad to it. She looked at the food suspiciously, in with the sauce and with the salad were small seeds. \"What's it made of?\" She asked Hades not really caring as she brought the fork to her mouth. Her tongue was almost tasting the morsel when he replied. \"Pomegranates.\" \"What?!\" Hades sighed as the fork was thrown onto the plate - he'd been so close. It wasn't tricking exactly, he had told her honestly what was in it when she had asked. It was her fault she'd asked too late. Except she hadn't asked too late. But he had given his answer a split second too soon. She was halfway standing up before Hades had seized her wrist keeping her in place. \"I am not stupid,\" she hissed at him, \"I know what happens if I eat those seeds! Do you think you can trick me like that?\" \"It's not tricking - pomegranate seeds are the food of the Underworld, I thought you'd know that.\" It wasn't completely a lie. He had thought she'd known that, he was just hoping she'd have forgotten to even think about it. Persephone shook her head at him in disgust and Hades tightened his grip slightly on her wrist. \"I wasn't tricking you! But do you not realise how easy this would be for you? You cannot leave the Underworld anyway -\" \"So you permanently try to bind me to it?\" He had no reply for that. \"I want to go home.\" \"Well you can't.\" Hades snapped at her coldly his eyes blazing. \"This is your home now. Whether or not you eat the pomegranate seeds you're still staying here.\" He dropped her wrist roughly so it thudded against her side. \"The next full moon we will be wed.\" \"No.\" Persephone shook her head stubbornly. \"You don't have a choice in this. Even on Olympus your powers are nothing compared to mine. You're a goddess yes, but a young one.\" Persephone scowled - she heard the hidden meaning in his phrase 'young one'. He meant lesser. She spat on the stone floor close to his feet to show her anger and stormed from the room. Hades watched in silence as she left and rubbed his forehead wearily. He was going the wrong way about this he knew, but the damage was done...he'd have to win her over somehow. Feeling rejected he ate his dinner alone, the nymphs had left him in silence knowing he preferred to eat alone. But he had thought it would be different with Persephone. She was beautiful and there was something different about her compared to the other goddesses. Perhaps it was because she rarely spent time on Mount Olympus. He didn't know what was different or why she was, but she was. Finishing his dinner Hades left his plate and went in search of Persephone. He didn't need to look around, she didn't know her way around the Underworld so there was really only one place she'd be. \"Persephone, can I come in?\" He asked knocking on her door softly. He waited for an answer and knocked again but when he got no reply a second time he opened the door and peered in. He felt his heart twist (an unusual feeling for him) at the sight that greeted him. Persephone lay curled up in a tight ball on her bed, her knees were drawn up to her chest and her forehead rested on them. Her waist length midnight black hair was splayed around her, covering her like some sort of blanket and helping her to blend in with the black bedding. As he moved closer he could see her shoulders moving up and down rapidly, his heart twisted even tighter and a pang of guilt struck him like lightning. What was wrong with him? \"Persephone.\" He said sitting beside her and reaching out to squeeze her shoulder gently. \"Please just leave me alone,\" she whispered in a defeated voice. \"You've got what you wanted.\" He wanted to contradict her, to tell her that this was far from what he wanted. Centuries of being alone, of having a heart encased in stone prevented him from opening up. Sighing he leant over and brushed her hair away from her face softly, he kissed her cheek trying his best to ignore the way her body tensed up at the contact. Without another word he stood up and crossed short distance towards his own chambers. He hoped she would be more willing to accept these circumstances by their wedding. He didn't want anything to tarnish the day, or the night. He consulted the lunar chart on his wall to see when the next full moon was, he realised he'd not given himself much time. According to the chart the wedding was to take place in five days time. Had a month really passed already? When you were a god time had no importance, it just passed to them like a second did to a mortal. Perhaps it was better that it was so soon though, soon Demeter would realise her daughter was missing. He gave himself another two days at the most, but by then surely someone would have noticed Persephone's disappearance. Shaking his head as he lost himself deep in thought Hades entered his private study and sat down at the desk. Five days was a short time, he'd best begin the preparations now. *** Persephone woke up the next morning with sore damp eyes, her hair clung to her face in patches and she grimaced. She didn't need to look in the mirror to know what sight would greet her. Red and puffy sapphire blue eyes, a tear streaked face that was deathly pale and covered in splotches, straggled midnight black hair that looked as if it'd not been brushed in weeks. She was hardly beautiful now. If Hades could see her now maybe he would be repulsed, maybe he would let her go home! She quickly shoved that thought aside, the thought of anyone seeing her this way, seeing her so weak and pathetic was sickening. It'd been bad enough that he had witnessed her crying last night, but it had been too much. He really meant to keep her here; binding her with pomegranate seeds had shown her he was serious. This was not some whim where he would simply release her a century later, he wanted her for keeps. Trying to forget about the events that would unfold she bathed and washed her hair and face vigorously. She longed for her magic so she could dry and style her hair but the Underworld had by now truly sapped her powers. She may as well be mortal. Wrapping a towel around herself securely she closed the door leading to the en-suite behind her and lay down on the bed. Everything here was so dark and depressing...maybe if she had some colour, something pretty to look at she wouldn't feel so...well dead inside. She barely had time to think about this before a soft tapping at the door snapped her from her thoughts. \"Go away Hades!\" She yelled debating whether or not to find something she could hurl at him if he dared enter. Just as last night though he ignored her wishes to be alone and simply opened the door. She blushed furiously as he entered followed once more by the dull, grey, lost looking nymphs. She could see the smirk on his face as he looked her up and down, taking in every detail of her exposed body that wasn't protected by the towel. \"Time seems to escape me,\" he said bowing almost mockingly to her. \"The full moon is now four days away - this gives us very little time to prepare.\" \"So call the wedding off.\" Persephone hissed holding her chin high as he continued to look her up and down. \"My dear don't be so silly, I've waited long enough for a companion I don't see any reason to wait any longer. We simply need to start the preparations early,\" he indicated to the nymphs who all looked down at the floor. It was now Persephone noticed that each nymph was holding something; scissors, measuring tape, fabric and sewing equipment. \"I want you out.\" Persephone ordered Hades; she could see no point in arguing about this and making him angry. \"I will not have you eyeing me up.\" \"I would never do such a thing; I did not watch you bathe yesterday.\" Persephone's blood ran cold, so someone had been watching her while she swam! \"I do not want anything to spoil our wedding night,\" Hades whispered crossing the room to stand beside her. \"I want it to be special,\" he whispered in her ear resting one hand on the small of her back. \"For the best of us.\" For a moment she thought he was going to kiss her. One hand was on the back of her neck while the other remained on the small of her back, her skin tingled on her neck was his hand rested and even through the towel she was uncomfortably aware of the closeness of his hand to her bare skin. His lips descended, almost meeting hers but stopping barely a millimetre away. He smiled mockingly, bowing once more he turned to the nymphs and gave them instructions of how he wanted the dress to resemble, waving his hand rolled up pieces of scrolls appeared and he handed them to the nearest one. Without so much as a glance at Persephone he left. Persephone remained unusually silent as the nymphs swarmed around her draping the measuring tape across her body and recording the measurements. Normally she'd be in deep conversation with nymphs, but these were strange ones...they were like... Dead, she realised shocked. It was now she realised that these were the spirits of dead nymphs, spending an eternity of servitude to Hades. She suppressed a shudder at the thought. Was this how her life was to be? A life of serving Hades, although rather than making him meals and cleaning up after him she was to lay down with him at night, kiss him and bear his children? It wasn't exactly the most appealing of eternities. She didn't even care that no one was asking her opinion of the dress, she just watched in helpless silence as they draped the fabric around her and slowly moulded it into a dress. When she felt as if she might scream from frustration the nymphs deftly removed a number of pins and took the now dress-like fabric from her. They left as they had come - in silence. Throwing on a toga she made her bed and sat on the edge, it was so uncomfortable it was driving her crazy. She could feel the stone under the mattress; it was hard on her back and made her feel like she was sleeping on rocks. Four days, she thought not realising that tears were once more trickling down her face. I have to get out of here. She told herself, I'm not bound to the Underworld...not yet. But in four days time...who's to say I won't be? Maybe I won't need pomegranate seeds to bind me here once I'm married to him. I have to get out...and soon. It was two days before the wedding. Hades sat across the dining table studying his young bride-to-be as she simply stared at the plate in front of her. She refused to eat; she knew that he was hiding pomegranate seeds in her food. It wasn't so much he was hiding them; they were a common part of Underworld dining. \"You need to eat.\" He said softly. \"No I don't.\" Was the stony reply, sapphire eyes flicked up from the plate to glare at him. \"I'm a goddess; I can't die or get sick. So don't think you can force me to eat with idle threats about my health.\" Hades shook his head and continued his own meal; there was no point in arguing with her. She was right; starving herself would do nothing to her. The only damage it would do, would be making her weak, and since she couldn't use her powers anyway that would have no lasting damage on her. \"I've heard myths,\" she said suddenly out of the blue. \"Of mortals, mortals that are still alive coming into the Underworld.\" Hades looked back up at her, he could see where this was going and he couldn't help but feel a little relieved. \"It occasionally happens, mortals find it hard to accept the loss of someone close to them. Even when their loved one is murdered they still protest it was wrongful, they will not accept that it was that person's fate. They hope to bargain for them.\" \"And you coldly send them on their way.\" She replied bitterly. \"If I felt sympathy for every mortal who passed through here I would have been driven insane by now. It's not my job to feel sympathy for these people, I only rule the Underworld - I have nothing to do with the deaths of these people. That's the responsibility of another God.\" He waited for a cutting reply and when he never received one he continued. \"Why do want to know about these mortals?\" He had an idea of what she was getting at; of course he wouldn't let her know he was suspicious. \"How do they get here? You made a crack in the earth to bring me here,\" as she spoke her cheeks reddened and her eyes blazed with anger. Hades knew he'd have to be careful of how he spoke in the next few minutes. \"There are various entrances that are...easy for mortals to gain access too. They're hidden so as not to make it too easy. I don't want just anyone wandering down here, only those who are truly determined to find me or my...helpers,\" he wasn't sure he should mention to her about those who sold their souls to him. \"The more determined they are the more likely they are to find one of these entrances. Why do you ask?\" \"I was just curious.\" She said quietly as if lost in thought, Hades bit back a smirk and took a sip of wine from his goblet. He'd known from the moment he took her she would attempt an escape, he'd constantly been alert. He needed to be there when she tried to break free. \"Will you excuse me?\" She murmured rising from the table, Hades simply nodded not mentioning that she never asked him to excuse her. She normally just stormed from the room. He gave her a few minutes head start while he finished his wine, as he rose from the table he ordered the nymphs to keep out of Persephone's way. They didn't speak to the young goddess, it was almost as if they were mute - they rarely spoke to anyone. He made sure to keep close to her but not so close that she would grow suspicious; using his powers he subtly guided her to the nearest mortal entrance/exit. Light flooded the Underworld; it was clearly sunlight from the golden glow it threw on the stone floors and walls. He felt his heart twist at the way the young goddess picked up speed, almost breaking out into a run. Although his heart was twisting it didn't stop him from what he did next, concentrating he threw up his arms creating an invisible barrier exactly where the Underworld and Mortal world met. Her sobs tore at him, for the first time in centuries Hades felt guilt, he loathed himself for doing this to the woman he loved. If only she would just accept this! He stayed back for a few more minutes, he hated himself for doing so but she had to remain unaware that he was there, that he was the reason she couldn't cross the threshold. \"Persephone?\" He called her name softly and stepped out from the shadows; he took her gently in his arms and cradled her lovingly. \"Ssh,\" he whispered, \"what's wrong? What are you doing here?\" \"As if you don't know.\" She sobbed bitterly making no effort to free herself from the circle of his arms. \"You were trying to escape.\" Hades sighed gently leading her away from the exit and towards his throne room. He waved for a nymph to bring him a blanket, she wasn't exactly cold but she was trembling uncontrollably. \"Here, sit down.\" As he wrapped the blanket snugly around her shoulders he sat her carefully in his throne. She looked miniscule in it, almost child-like. \"Persephone...\" he started but cut himself off, he wasn't sure what to say. \"I need a bride, Aphrodite would tell you as much - its her duty to bring people together after all. If you spoke to her she'd make you see reason.\" Of course he wouldn't let anyone know of Persephone's whereabouts until after the wedding, he just hoped he could get her to see reason by mentioning Aphrodite, a goddess who had everything to do with love. \"Why me? I don't belong here!\" \"Who does? Do you really think I enjoy my work? I'm bound to the Underworld, just as you would be.\" \"You can leave.\" Persephone pointed out coldly. She had him there, sighing he smoothed her hair, caressing her cheek as his fingers trailed down to her face. \"You need to accept this. The wedding will happen. No one is going to come in and save you; no one knows where you are. They know you're missing, but as for your location...you've just vanished.\" He shrugged; he'd never had to comfort anyone before needless to say he wasn't exactly the best person to turn to. \"Perhaps it would be better to accept this now, rather than drag it out. Embrace your fate.\" By now she was no longer looking at him, her eyes were fixed on the floor in front of her. Slowly Hades reached out and tilted her chin up with his index and middle finger, forcing her to look at him. Gently he stood up taking hold of her hands and pulling her up with him. This time he didn't hold back, he lowered his face to hers and kissed her fully on the mouth. He started slowly at first, teasing her lips with the lightest of touches. His tongue darting in and out caressing hers. He could tell she was hesitating, he could almost see the battle ranging in her mind. He took advantage of that hesitance and deepened the kiss, his hands ensnaring her, pinning her arms to her sides beneath the blanket. Inwardly he was grinning, he could tell she was hesitating - there was a battle screaming in her mind, yet she put up no resistance. He was winning, he had her. Persephone woke up on the day of the wedding with a heavy heart, she wasn't even sure if it was morning. The Underworld had no concept of time, day and night were the same; indistinguishable. Hades hadn't made another move on her since the kiss only a few days ago, but she knew he'd won. He was right; no one would come for her. She was trapped. She'd just have to hope that she could gain some freedom from this awful marriage. A soft tapping at her door resulted in her pulling the duvet over her head and burrowing deeper into the bedding. She knew that wouldn't stop the nymphs coming in though, they answered to Hades only and he'd ordered them to go in her room even if she refused them. Soon enough the sound of running water could be heard and the duvet was tugged away and she was pulled to her feet. She knew that in the rooms next door Hades would be getting the same treatment from the nymphs, but she guessed that his attitude was a more upbeat one. I wonder if I could just drown myself, maybe gods do die but none have ever tried it. She sank under the water knowing it was hopeless; even if she did die she'd end up here anyway. For her there was no escaping Hades. The nymphs tugged her back to the surface and resumed washing her hair with special oils, she caught a whiff of rose scent and tears stung her eyes. It felt like it'd been months, years even, since she'd smelt a real rose or any type of flower for that matter but she knew she'd been here for only a week. The next few hours passed in a blur, she was seated in a chair where her hair and make-up was done, she wasn't sure how long the make-up took but knew it took longer than normal due to the fact tears constantly streamed down her face. All too soon she was ushered from the room and following nymphs through the Underworld. She knew better than to ask where the wedding was to be held, the nymphs never spoke. As she walked the fine silk of the dress whispered against her legs, it was beautiful - perhaps if she was marrying someone she loved she'd admire it more. The top half of the dress was made in a toga-like fashion, with one shoulder covered and remaining shoulder left bare, it hugged her figure showing off her slender curves. The dress touched the floor; a slit on the right side ran up to her thigh showing slender legs beneath the fabric. Diamonds twinkling like stars adorned her hair, ears and neck; a cluster adorned the bust of her dress drawing attention to her breasts. \"You look beautiful,\" a cool voice snapped her from her thoughts and Persephone looked up to see Hades leaning against a stone wall, his eyes taking in every detail of her appearance. She shifted uncomfortably as his eyes slowly strolled over every inch of her body, she didn't even need to look at his face to tell what he was picturing. \"Don't scowl like that,\" he smirked walking towards her as the nymphs shifted aside so he could pass through. He lowered his face down to hers and for a split second Persephone thought he would kiss her, he'd not made another move to do so since their kiss a few nights ago. Instead he pressed his nose close to her hair and took a deep breath; even if she had wanted to she couldn't have repressed the shudder that shook her body. \"May I ask who is wedding us?\" She asked trying to keep her mind clear, to keep calm. \"A temple priest.\" Persephone arched her eyebrow at this, which priest? Who would be insane enough to wed the two? Unless Hades had spun them a lie... \"Come, let's not waste anymore time.\" He bowed and kissed her cheek, resting a hand on her waist he led her into great stone room. It was almost empty, a scattering of nymphs and minions were gathered to one side, at the front of the room just in front of a stone alter covered with a black silk cloth stood an old man. He was draped in black robes, he was old and greying, his face was weathered and worn, and his eyes a steel grey looked tired and anxious. He doesn't want to do this, Persephone realised as they stopped a few feet in front of him. He bowed to them both deeply, his bow to Hades was considerably deeper and Persephone guessed that he was a priest at one of Hades' temples. \"What did you tell this man?\" She asked Hades coldly, \"I can tell he doesn't want to marry us anymore than I want to marry you!\" \"He is my priest, he must obey me.\" He never set eyes on her as he spoke; his eyes were focused intently on the priest as if daring him to speak. \"It is my pleasure to marry you both, and an honour to meet a goddess such as yourself. Your beauty is a great rival to Aphrodite herself.\" Persephone bit back a grin as she faced the man. \"I wouldn't let her hear you say that, she'll get jealous.\" She wasn't worried about him being struck down here though, no god could hear what was said in the Underworld, nor could they spy on the goings on there. It was something to do with the power; it rivalled Olympus's own power. \"But I can tell you don't want to marry us, why?\" She heard Hades givbe a slight cough. \"What did you tell him?\" \"The truth. That I've claimed you as mine brought you to my domain so you will be my co-ruler.\" Persephone was stunned; she'd not expected him to say the truth so...casually! \"It's true Goddess; my Lord Hades has no need to lie to a lowly servant such as myself. I must do as he commands.\" Persephone frowned, she knew priests were honour bound to their Gods or Goddesses, but if it would conflict with another...they had ways of objecting. This marriage would surely anger her father! She had been kidnapped and was forced to marry a man she didn't love, to rule a world that was against her very being. \"But -\" \"Persephone.\" Hades said sharply glaring at her, she flinched and for the first time she felt truly terrified. Now she got the impression that defying him was not the best of ideas. \"Please forgive my bride, she is just nervous. May we please begin?\" Persephone could see the priest was still hesitating. You're not getting out of this, a small voice in her mind told her. This is real. There's no one coming to save you, but you cannot drag this man down with you. She blinked away tears and forced a smile as she looked at the priest. \"May I?\" She asked him quietly holding out her hand for his, the priest looked at her nervously but gave her his hand. Closing her eyes Persephone took a deep breath, she pictured her thoughts as currents, her body a river. The thoughts trailed through her mind and out her fingertips leaving her mind empty. She focused now on only happy thoughts, the smell of summer - berries, wildflowers, the scent of an oncoming storm. Everything that made her, her. When she opened her eyes she let go of the priests hand and smiled faintly. A miniature rose, no bigger than her little finger, lay in the centre of his palm. The petals in full bloom were a pale pink and emitted a faint golden sparkle. \"Goddess this is a beautiful gift -\" \"Its my favour,\" Persephone explained to him glancing at Hades from the corner of her eye to study his reaction. She could see he was impressed. \"Now if a God or Goddess questions you about this you can show them that you performed this ceremony with my blessing.\" Hades looked genuinely shocked and opened his mouth to say something. \"I don't want to marry you.\" She said sharply unable to look at him, \"but this man shouldn't be held responsible and punished for your cruelty. Please...may we just do this?\" *** Hades swept Persephone off her feet as soon as they stepped outside; he carried her bridal style to his bedchambers not caring if he was practically running. Persephone didn't protest, she couldn't speak. Tears stung her eyes and fear gripped her immortal heart. All too soon he was gracefully laying her on the bed, his lips pressed against hers, his body heavy on top of hers. \"Do we have to do this now?\" She pleaded in a whispery voice as his hands all but tore the dress off her. \"Our marriage is only official if we consummate it now,\" he whispered trailing kisses from her lips to hear ears. \"I promise you I'll be gentle,\" Persephone flinched. Her mother had kept her shut away in forests for just this reason - she wanted her daughter to remain pure, an innocent maiden. She knew about sex, Aphrodite had schooled the young goddess in it when she had reached her 'teens'. She knew that it would most likely hurt for the first time, but Hades words just heightened her fear. \"Ssh,\" he smoothed her hair from her face as he lay atop of her now fully naked. For the first time Persephone let herself study Hades' appearance. She had noticed he had a handsome face, tanned with deep dark eyes that you could just lose yourself in. His hair looked soft and luxurious, like velvet, she refused to let her hands roam through his hair - she didn't want him to think she was enjoying this. She would not accept this fate. Her eyes trailed down, taking in the muscular arms which circled her body, the heavily muscled chest and toned stomach inches above her own smooth, flat stomach. Finally her eyes rested on his manhood, her cheeks burned crimson and she let out a small cry. She closed her eyes and turned her head, she could feel his hands rubbing her stomach, massaging her shoulders and breasts. His movements distracted her from the swell below his abdomen. They were moving in rhythm together, thighs grinding together slowly at first but gradually picking up speed. Persephone could feel her breath quickening, she held onto his shoulders and as he slowly entered her she let out a small gasp. He whispered in her ear, kissed her gently and held onto her. Persephone lay in his arms after, he was still whispering in her ear; empty promises and meaningless words. Tears trickled down her cheeks and she turned her back to him. He'd won. She was now his wife and bound to the Underworld. She'd given herself to him willingly, or as good as. She'd not fought him - she'd almost enjoyed it, she'd been attracted to him! Squeezing her eyes tightly shut she pulled the black silk duvet up to her shoulders tightly and tried to sleep. But sleep would not welcome her. Tears trickled down her cheeks as she listened to Hades murmuring softly and eventually snoring softly, a hand still resting on her stomach, caressing it lovingly even in his sleep. Hades was awake earlier than usual the next morning, Persephone still in his arms. Her skin felt soft against his own. He began tracing patterns lightly on her stomach with his fingertips, she stirred under the movement and Hades silently cursed himself. He knew she'd not have gotten much sleep last night, how long had she lain awake while he slept peacefully with his beloved in his arms? \"Forgive me my queen,\" he whispered into her ear, \"I did not mean to wake you.\" \"Please don't call me that.\" She begged him shrinking away from his touch only to find her back pressed close to his chest as she moved. Hades sighed and sat up gently pulling her with him, she quickly rearranged the duvet to keep herself covered from the shoulders down. \"Why not? You are my Queen. Like it or not you're now Queen of the Underworld.\" He gently wiped a tear from her cheek and kissed her softly. \"Can I please go back to my own rooms now? I'm tired.\" She pleaded with him; he could see she was exhausted. Her pale skin was almost grey from exhaustion, her sapphire eyes were hidden beneath heavy lidded eyelids and covered by bags, her once rose coloured lips were now almost the same shade of her skin. \"No.\" He shook his head after the barest of hesitance. \"You're my wife, these are your rooms now. You share my bed with me, every night without fail.\" \"You can't force me to -\" \"I can.\" Hades said coldly, \"I could force you to join with me now if I wished. However I don't want to take you that way, if you don't wish to join with me then fine. But you shall sleep in these rooms from now on.\" His tone had started as harsh, but as he continued to speak it grew gentle. \"I would never take you by force, rest assured.\" Softly he lowered his head to her lips and kissed her tenderly. \"If you wish to sleep you may do so, I shall leave you in peace.\" As he stood up to dress he could see Persephone lie back down with the duvet tightly pulled over her head. He watched as the duvet trembled, his heart twisting as he realised she was quietly sobbing. He closed the door quietly behind him and was instantly swarmed by his minions. \"Can I not have five minutes of peace before you all start pestering me?\" He shouted hurling fire at the nearest minion to show his anger. \"My lord forgive us, we thought you would want to know of this straight away.\" A small minion squeaked. \"Know what?\" Hades bellowed as he followed them to the entrance of the Underworld, the entrance that departed souls from the Mortal world were destined to use. All too soon he saw the problem. Usually the souls came in at a steady trickle, like a river leisurely running over rocks to join a stream. Very rarely did they push through as they were now, like rapids tumbling towards a waterfall. \"It's Demeter,\" the minion continued, \"she's neglected her duties - ever since she realised her daughter was missing she's done nought but search for her. The crops have gone bad; the harvests have failed - all over Greece people are beginning to starve to death. They grow ill from malnutrition.\" Hades rubbed his forehead wearily; he should have guessed this would happen. He would have to reveal the whereabouts of his queen now; they couldn't take her from him. Still he'd have to endure lectures, and most likely constant nagging from Demeter. \"Leave me. I will deal with this.\" He ordered the minions; of course there was nothing he could do now to stop the flow of incoming souls. He'd have to talk to Zeus to get the woman back to her work; Hades did not want to endure overtime because Demeter was getting sentimental! She'd had centuries to enjoy the girls company and she'd not bothered, Hades would not neglect his wife as Demeter had her daughter. \"Persephone?\" He opened the door to their bedroom and saw she was still in bed, walking closer to her he saw she'd finally fallen into a deep sleep. He bent down and kissed her cheek softly thankful she didn't even stir. He didn't want to explain to her what was happening; he didn't think it'd help their situation. *** Olympus was hotter than he liked. He was so used to the cool temperatures of the Underworld that the sun was much too like a sauna for him. \"Zeus!\" He called striding into the Great Hall where most of the gods and goddesses just to laze about during their spare time. He was surprised to see the Great Hall so empty, only Hera and Zeus were there.\"Where is everyone?\" He asked not even trying to mask his surprise. \"Out looking for young Persephone.\" Hera replied sadly. \"Ah.\" \"Ah?\" Hera looked up at him sharply and saw the sheepish look on his face. \"Hades do you know anything of her whereabouts? Kidnapping a goddess is a serious crime! We must find the mortal or the being who has her.\" \"Now Hera e don't even know she's been kidnapped, she's young. She's a going through a bit of a rebellion stage; you know she doesn't like to be cooped up as Demeter does to her.\" \"Hades, do you know of her whereabouts?\" Hera asked as if she'd not even heard Zeus. She tossed her golden hair away from her eyes and scrutinised him intently. Hades bowed and sighed. \"Persephone is in the Underworld, as my Queen.\" He couldn't help grinning, he didn't have to tell them it was kidnap, and how she'd cried herself into a fitful sleep on their wedding night. He could spin them anything; they'd not go down there to check. \"Queen?\" Zeus asked and grinned. \"That's fabulous Hades!\" He jumped from the throne and shook his hand. \"A fine match for the girl! I was worried about who she'd choose to marry, but you a fine God! Outstanding!\" Hades pretended to care what Zeus thought - it was hard to take 'outstanding' as a compliment from the god who sat around all day lazing in the sun. Hades was the only one who did any real work! Well...maybe Apollo and Poseidon too, but they were rarities, mostly gods just meddled in mortal affairs. \"We should tell Demeter at once,\" Hera said smiling faintly, \"she will want to know that her daughter is safe and well.\" Not one of them asked what happened, as Olympus began to fill up all anyone could do was congratulate him. The few who asked why she'd not come with him to Olympus were easily thrown off by a lie. \"She's resting; she wants to adjust to her new home before she faces everyone.\" He told a god for what felt like the thousandth time. \"Zeus, Hera, brothers and sisters, I'm afraid I must bid you farewell.\" He turned and bowed to them all. \"My young wife must be worried sick about me. Please tell Demeter to stop worrying, once Persephone is settled she will see her. But right now she's not making any of our lives easier by neglecting her own duties.\" Draining the rest of his champagne he returned to the Underworld. All he could do now was wait, he doubted he would be left in peace with Persephone. He expected some protest from Demeter - but hopefully by then he'd have Persephone wrapped around his little finger. Persephone was sat in Hades' throne room, she felt drained and exhausted. Her black dress did nothing to lighten her mood, all her clothes were black. She was kneeling on the floor, a scroll in one hand, her eyes weren't moving as she couldn't concentrate on the words. All she could think about was home, the warm forests of Greece with their fresh scents and beautiful wildlife. Footsteps echoing down the halls made her look up and she was greeted by the sight of Hades walking into the throne room looking unusually happy with himself. \"You're up!\" He grinned sweeping her off the floor and planting kisses on her forehead, nose, cheeks and lips. Persephone was too tired to fight him off, she endured the kisses with gritted teeth, trying her best to not clench her hands so she'd not destroy the scroll in her hands. \"Where did you go?\" She asked as he released her and took his seat on his throne. \"Olympus.\" \"Without me!?\" Persephone cried angrily, \"why didn't you take me! You told me I'd be bound to the Underworld once I married you, surely that means I can go to Olympus and visit the mortal world!\" Hades shook his head. \"Why?\" \"I want you to be happy first, I don't want you running to your mother. You're married to me, there's no getting out of that. But I want a wife who is here with me. Not one who I never see because she hides herself either in the mortal world or Olympus! When you're happy then of course I'll let you visit your mother.\" \"Hades I...\" Persephone trailed off and shook her head, \"never mind.\" She sighed. \"No, what?\" Hades concern was genuine; he reached out to squeeze catch her hand and squeeze it comfortingly but stopped himself. His touch never did seem to comfort her; in fact it seemed to worsen whatever mood she tended to be in at that time. This was the first time he'd seen her look this way, truly defeated and distraught. \"Persephone, please tell me what's wrong.\" \"I - I don't love you, I don't even like you. I'm sorry but I don't, I won't ever be happy. How can I be? You kidnapped me and forced me to marry you.\" Tears were in her eyes, but like all the other times he'd seen these tears she blinked them away rapidly determined not to let him see her cry. Hades could feel his shoulders slumping and he rested his elbows on his knees as he looked up at her. \"I'm sorry you feel that way. But you're not the only woman who's ever been forced into wedlock, all over Greece, all over the world people are forced into marriage. Whether by their fathers to benefit them financially, or their lovers just because they can. Just for the power. Persephone, I genuinely love you. I'm sorry for how I've treated you, how I've acted but...\" He shook his head and decided to try another angle. \"Do you really think you'd have been free to choose? Your mother would have kept you away from all men; your father Zeus would have wanted you to marry a great God. Do you know how happy he is that you're married to him? Do you know how relieved he is?\" \"Would he be relieved if he saw me like this?\" \"Yes.\" Hades said sharply, \"you're married to an 'outstanding god' his own words.\" Standing up he took her upper arms in his hands gently and forced her to face him. \"How many fathers do you think care about the happiness of their daughters?\" \"All of them!\" Hades shook his head sadly amazed at her ignorance. \"Hardly any, not in this day and age. All they care about is their daughter making a good marriage, not bringing shame upon their family. You may be a goddess, but you know yourself you're a lesser one. Marriage to me makes you more known, when word spreads in the mortal world how do you think they'll react? They'll see you as the warmth to my coldness, the forgiveness to my judgement.\" Persephone bit her lip, she could see what he meant but she still didn't want anything to do with this world. \"What you want doesn't matter, not in the higher scale of things.\" Hades told her comfortingly as if reading her mind. He sat her on the throne and knelt on the highest stair leading to it so he was kneeling before her. \"What do you expect me to do? Smile and pretend I'm in love with you? That I'm devoted to you?\" \"I should,\" Hades said firmly, \"but I want you to be happy, I just want you to give it time. You can't tell me you're not at least a little bit attracted to me. I saw it in your eyes last night, and you didn't protest - you wanted to have sex with me.\" \"I never -\" Persephone began to protest horrified. \"I saw it in your eyes; you didn't protest or put up a fight. And when you weren't fighting with yourself I could see you were enjoying it. Why be ashamed?\" He pressed her, \"we're married there's nothing wrong with it. Why shouldn't you be attracted to me? Why not has sex with me?\" Persephone had no argument for that, she could feel her cheeks burning with embarrassment. Was she that easy to read? \"Come on, let's get something to eat.\" \"No.\" She said shaking her head, \"I'm sorry...I'll try to settle in but I will not eat.\" She held the scroll up, \"You go eat...I'll just sit here and read for a while longer.\" She could see Hades wanted to argue with her and she couldn't help grinning. \"Fine.\" He sighed rising to his feet; the grin was wiped off Persephone's face as she saw the look of hurt on his face. She opened her mouth to apologise but kept it tightly shut, she didn't have anything to apologise for. As soon as he was out of sight she was out of his throne and leaning against a wall lost in the scroll once more. *** That night Persephone lay awake once more, her head was resting on Hades chest his arms wrapped around her waist holding her in a gentle grip. She'd not protested, he'd not even hinted for anything sexual to happen. He'd simply held her in his arms and drifted off to sleep, leaving her wide awake with her thoughts. She closed her eyes and took a deep breath trying to think what life would be like if she just accepted this. It was hard though, every time she envisioned how it would be she thought of how she had come to be here. Opening her eyes she looked up at Hades' sleeping face, tears pricking her eyes. How could he sleep so peacefully? How could he hold her in his arms like this? As if they were a happily married couple, was he really happy living a farce? No matter how hard she tried, she just couldn't bring herself to allow herself to fall in love with this man. No matter how tender his kisses, how lightly he cradled her in his arms...nothing could make up for what he had done. He was a kidnapper, her captor and her jailor...he'd never be anything more than that to her. How could he? Hades was exhausted. Despite now knowing her daughters whereabouts Demeter had still not returned to her duties. In fact she seemed to be neglecting them all together, Zeus had promised he'd talk Demeter around but so far nothing had come from it. In the meantime Hades was spending more and more time sorting through the dead, making sure no one attempted an escape and generally keeping order in the Underworld. Some ghosts were extremely feisty; they refused to believe they were dead making it all the more worse for everyone. He barely saw Persephone, although in a way he found this a blessing. He'd not told her of what was going on; she just assumed he was giving her space to think things over. It didn't occur to her that he had too much work to do. Although that had been far from his intentions it was working, she was gradually warming up to him, they'd not shared anything more than kisses but she willingly climbed into bed with him at night and curled up beside him. That had to be a start. However she still refused to eat, a thought that secretly made him feel ill. If Demeter got her way and Persephone was returned to her, Hades knew he'd lose her forever. Demeter could demand their marriage be annulled, but if Persephone ate the pomegranate seeds she'd be bound to the Underworld. And that would be irreversible. \"Hades?\" Persephone stood by the entrance of his throne room snapping him from his thoughts. Hurriedly he rolled the scroll he'd been using to make sure that no one who shouldn't be in the Underworld was living. \"Are you alright, you seem a bit...distant.\" He smiled faintly as he noticed her biting her lower lip nervously, her hands clasped lightly in front of her. He was winning her over, it was a slow victory but it was happening. \"I'm fine,\" he said gesturing for her to come forward. He took her hand and lightly brushed his lips along it. \"Just work,\" he shrugged knowing she'd not ask anymore. \"I don't suppose I can tempt you to dine with me?\" \"No,\" Persephone shook her head, \"I'll sit with you but I won't eat.\" \"You realise I could force you to eat?\" \"Yes. But that would be breaking your word; you promised you wouldn't force me to do anything.\" Hades grinned in spite of himself, they both knew he'd not break his word - no matter how tempted he got. Rising to his feet he drew Persephone closer and tilted her chin up. \"If I kissed you now would you protest?\" He whispered with his lips barely a centimetre away from her own. His heart actually skipped a beat as she blushed and shook her head timidly. She was still shy; timid to make the first move yet at times he knew she craved his touch. He brushed his lips against hers, softly at first and softly began to grow more tender and passionate with each passing moment. He slowly rested one hand on her hip and the other on the small of her back drawing her closer to him. Before he could begin to crave more than the kiss he pulled back and smiled faintly at her. \"See, I'm not that bad.\" Persephone rolled her eyes and turned to walk off. \"It's strange,\" she said her voice sounding as if she was deep in thought. \"What's strange?\" Hades asked as she sunk into silence for five minutes. \"Before you took me all I wanted was to be free of my mother, well not free but...have some space.\" \"Which you have now,\" Hades reminded her hoping that she was finally thinking more positively. \"I know but...I still don't have my freedom. I'm still bound to one place; it's just a different place. And I miss her...I never thought I'd miss her like this.\" Hades felt his heart twist painfully; he was doing to her exactly what her mother did. \"Persephone I...\" He shook his head, \"go read. Let me eat my dinner in peace, I'll come find you after to talk.\" He kissed her cheek gently, squeezed her shoulder and departed. He found that his appetite had disappeared by the time he reached the dining room; he merely pushed his food around with his fork rearranging it into patterns as he thought about what he would say to her. He was beginning to think part of the truth was a good idea, but how much? He forced himself to eat a little food, needing something to settle the twisting knots in his stomach. He had to get her to eat somehow; if he could slip just a few pomegranate seeds between those luscious lips then she'd be bound to him. He wouldn't have to worry about losing her, he could own up to where she was without fear. Surely Zeus would be glad - and who cared what Demeter thought? Zeus was the God of Gods - what he said was law. If he agreed that this marriage was a good thing then Demeter would have no choice but to release her daughter. But then if he disagreed the marriage would be declared void, Hades would be separated from her - he'd most likely never see her again! He'd be banished to the Underworld for a few millenniums, and when he was finally released she'd be kept from his sight. No. He would never risk that. So what if a few more humans were brought to his domain, the more souls here meant more power for him. He would learn to cope with the workload, and once Persephone had accepted her place as Queen she could help ease the burden. *** \"What would make you happy?\" Hades asked as he sat in his throne massaging his forehead wearily, at his feet knelt Persephone poring over a scroll. The image to an outsider would look more like a servant/master scene - not a husband and wife, it tore at his heart. \"Freedom.\" \"You are free -\" \"No I'm not! I have you keeping me locked away down here or my mother keeping me hidden in forests -\" \"Then let me rephrase my question.\" Hades snapped more harshly than he had intended. \"What would make you happy here?\" Persephone shot him a glare, he could read the look plainly in her eyes. Nothing. He stared back determined not to back down, he was rewarded as she glanced back down at the scroll. \"Warmth. Life.\" She said quietly. \"It's too cold and dark down here, I miss the sun! I miss flowers, trees...\" Tears trickled down her cheeks and she pushed herself up from the floor turning her back to him so he wouldn't see the tears. \"I can give you that.\" Hades said quietly. \"And you could have the power to maintain it - Persephone...you could have the power to transform the Underworld, within reason.\" This wasn't a holiday for mortals after all, it was the afterlife. They weren't here to enjoy the scenery - only those who had performed great deeds were given that luxury. \"And all I have to do in return is accept my fate as your wife?\" She said in a bitter voice. \"I thought you were trying to settle in?\" Hades pointed out standing up and reaching out to take her hand. \"I'm trying! But this isn't my home!\" \"Then let me make it your home!\" Hades turned her around and dropped to his knees. \"Persephone I am your husband - your king, your loyal servant! Please, let me make my kingdom your home. Rule by my side.\" He searched her eyes imploringly; several times she opened and closed her mouth. Finally all she could do was nod in a defeated way. Hades bit back a sigh; it was a start at least. Persephone sat beside a small river, a waterfall a little to her left sent rippling motions across the water's surface and for a a while she simply sat there admiring the effect. A feeling of deja vu swept through her and she thought of a day when she had sat just like this. In a setting exactly like this. The only difference was that the sun was fake, if she looked up there was no brilliant blue sky or golden sun beating down its rays. There was a blue tint and golden light - but the eyes of a goddess were not to be fooled, Hades had tried his best to recreate the world above but he had little experience of the sun. To him it was distant memory, so distant that beyond the blue tint she could make out the cavernous stone ceiling of the Underworld. He had promised her that once she was a true Queen of the Underworld then she could perfect it...but she still wasn't sure. Could she really accept a life here? She'd spoken to Hades about it several times, and he had admitted one small detail that changed everything. She'd never be allowed to leave. She'd be bound permanently to the Underworld. On the ground beside her lay a pomegranate, its smooth surface looked tender and deliciously inviting. After starving herself for so long Persephone was close to conceding defeat. Her mother clearly didn't care - no one had been to search for her! Surely if they had looked all over Earth they'd have realised that she had to be here. So that left only one option - no one cared. Yet Hades did... \"May I?\" Persephone looked up startled to see Hades standing over her; she nodded and turned to look back into the watery depths of the river. She felt grass blades tickle her palm as they were disturbed by Hades movement. When she turned to look back at him she found him staring intently into her eyes. Slowly he picked up the pomegranate and bit into it, the fruit was so tender the juices dribbled down his chin but he ignored it and continued staring. Slowly leant over and pressed his lips to Persephone. \"It would be easy Persephone.\" He whispered softly, \"it could end now...\" It dawned on her what he meant, she could feel his tongue creeping over her lips, trying to ease them apart and slide a seed into her mouth. \"No.\" She withdrew slowly and shook her head licking her lips. They tasted sweet and she looked at the fruit in his hand longingly. She was hungry - she didn't have to eat but she enjoyed it. The textures and different tastes of all the food...she missed experiencing though. \"Not like this. Not now.\" \"When?\" \"I don't know.\" She answered after a long silence. She watched as Hades bit into the pomegranate once more, her lips parted slightly as she looked at it hungrily. \"Why can you eat pomegranate seeds and yet not be bound to this place?\" \"I am bound to this place but by duties.\" Hades shrugged and looked at Persephone. His lips glistened with the juices from the fruit and he saw the look of her hunger in her eyes. Leaning over he pressed his lips to hers, kissing her in a slow yet passionate way. He tossed the pomegranate aside and pulled her towards him. Persephone put up no resistance, even as he lowered her onto the ground and began slowly undressing her. Persephone felt her eyes flutter shut; the sun beat down on Hades back making him warm to the touch, for a moment the atmosphere changed. The air felt real, the smells smelt real. With her eyes closed it almost felt like she was back on earth. A cry of ecstasy passed her lips and she felt her nails digging into Hades's back. \"It could be like this,\" Hades whispered into her ear his body weight pressing against her. \"Why fight it?\" \"I don't want to fight it.\" Persephone gasped as ripples of ecstasy shot through her body making her jolt as if shocked with each ripple. Her lips found His and she pressed her body as close to him as physically possible. When she fell back her chest was rising and falling in wild motions. She looked around and blushed - what had they just done? She sat up and grabbed her dress which had been thrown off in the passion; she held it close to cover herself up. \"Persephone - there's no one around.\" Hades reminded her sitting up and kissing her neck. He held out his hand and a pomegranate appeared. Persephone took it wordlessly and raised it to her lips. It felt smooth as it connected with her lips, her tongue rolling along the smooth curved surface. She had almost taken a bite when her eyes looked up at the sky. \"No.\" She said quietly throwing the fruit into the water. \"I'm sorry but I can't bind myself permanently - I don't belong here Hades.\" \"Excuse me, my Lord?\" Persephone gasped as a voice rang through the ear and she quickly covered herself up more securely with the dress. Looking up she saw a grey nymph with long white hair and clothed fully in black staring with a lost expression at Hades. \"Hermes is hear to see you - he says it is urgent.\" With a small bow the nymph turned and sloped off. \"I can't end up like that.\" Persephone whispered feeling tears prick her eyes. \"You won't - she's a nymph, a dead one. She's just a soul - a shadow of her former self. You'll be alive and healthy.\" Hades said in a stiff voice, Persephone couldn't help but the notice the glinting panic look in his eyes. \"I will see you at dinner. I hope you will join me.\" Kissing her swiftly on the lips Hades departed leaving Persephone alone with nothing but her thoughts. How close had she been to eating those seeds? Was it a sign? Did she deep down actually want to be bound to this place? Sighing Persephone quickly dressed herself and thought everything over. Could she give up earth forever? Never see her mother again?! Three weeks to the day had passed since their wedding; Persephone was strolling through the Underworld alone. Hades now trusted that she at least wouldn't try to break free, she didn't have the energy. He was right when he'd said her power would return to her a little when she was bound to him through marriage. Still he'd neglected to tell her that using it would drain her, and that it would be pointless to do so as her powers were useless here. There was no need to heal, to plant seeds and give them life in the Underworld. The dead did not need healing, and the plants wouldn't thrive in the Underworld as they did the mortal. It wasn't fair to give them life in so cold and dark a kingdom. Still she refused to eat, a month had passed since her abduction and she'd not eaten once - she didn't dare. She held onto the smallest hope that their marriage could be made void, even though she knew deep down it was impossible. The three weeks hadn't been that bad, Hades made regular attempts to claim her in his bed but she nearly always resisted. And much to her surprise he let her be, he was content with a few tender or passionate kisses, she found herself enjoying them sometimes - until she reminded herself of whom he was. Maybe he's right, she thought biting her lip and picking up a lone pebble from the ground. Maybe if I accepted this it would all be easier, I'm attracted to him...I can't deny that any longer, he never lets me forget it. But is really enough to just find someone attractive? She sighed and tossed the rock as far as she could throw it, she heard it echoing as it bounced along the stone floor. Turning she decided that perhaps it'd be best to talk to Hades; he seemed to be easy enough to talk to. Their marriage was problematic, and he was always willing to fix it. And she was beginning to think that there was something there to fix, could she possibly be falling in love with him? She would have prayed for an answer but it was worthless for two reasons; here in the Underworld the only person to pray too was Hades. And secondly...she was a goddess, who was there to answer her prayers? \"She won't have it Hades. Zeus has had enough; Demeter won't go back to her work until her daughter is returned to her side!\" Persephone recognised Hermes voice and her heart froze, she hid around the corner making sure she was out of sight. What was Hermes doing back here? Hades had said nothing of his first visit when the nymph had announced him and she'd thought nothing of it - until now. While Hades was good to talk too she knew he kept things from her, this conversation would be one of those things. \"His people are dying; he cannot get five minutes to do other work -\" \"You mean he cannot find five minutes alone to sunbathe, to drink ambrosia or guzzle some wine! He is not the only one working overtime, where do you think the dead go when they die?! Hawaii? Look around you Hermes! Can you not see I know well enough people are dying because of that insane woman?\" \"Be that as it may, you must return Persephone to her mother. Zeus will not stand for you keeping her here any longer.\" \"She is my wife! You expect me to be parted from my only companion!\" \"Yes.\" Persephone flinched at the coldness in Hermes voice - never had she heard him speak in such an emotionless tone. \"Helios has come forth; he has told us of how you abducted Persephone. Took her unwillingly into your realm. Whether or not she married you willing is unknown to us, we've so far been unable to detect the priest who wed you both.\" \"Give me...give me time.\" \"No! Persephone must return now.\" \"I will go and find her then.\" Persephone felt tears pricking her eyes, never before had she heard Hades sound so defeated. Quickly she turned and ran; she couldn't let him know she'd overheard what had been said. I'm going home. She thought coming to a stop in their bedroom, she sat on the edge of the bed and stared at her hands in shock. Hermes had come to get her...to set her free! So why wasn't she happy? Hadn't she just moments ago been wishing for a way home? No. She realised feeling her heart twist painfully in her chest. She had been almost praying for an answer to her question; could she really love Hades? Now she was getting her answer...and she was wishing for the opposite now. \"Persephone?\" Hades poked his head around the door and smiled in a forced-cheery way as he laid eyes upon her. \"I have good news...for you.\" \"Oh?\" \"Hermes is here...he's come to take you home.\" Persephone raised her eyes to his and smiled, like his it was forced. \"Hades -\" \"He can't wait around, he's here to take you now. He's in the throne room...will you go there now but wait just a moment before you leave? I - I need to...\" Persephone felt her heart twist once more and tears dropped down her cheeks. Was this how she had looked to him? Lost, distant and just...depressed? She stood up and kissed him softly on the lips. \"Of course I will wait.\" She said hugging him lightly, she turned and walked from the room. She didn't dawdle but neither did she rush to the throne room. She was torn, if she went home she'd be free from Hades - but she was growing attached to him. She loved him. Did she really want their marriage annulled? \"Persephone!\" Hermes rushed forward and swept her into a tight embrace. \"You must be so relieved! I don't know how you've coped been down here all this time! I've been here for ten minutes and already I feel like a mortal!\" Persephone forced a weak smile and shrugged her shoulders as she freed herself from his tight embrace. \"I - I don't know...I guess it's something you just get used to.\" She said although now he mentioned it she did feel weak; perhaps it was because soon she knew she'd be able to use her powers again. She was beginning to feel excitement; all the things she'd missed would once again be within her reach! But Hades was at the back of her mind tugging at the happiness of the thought of returning home; how could she leave him? \"Your mother has been beside herself with worry - we've searched everywhere for you! We came down here, well I did, to see if Hades had known of your whereabouts but he said he didn't. The amount of mortals who've...\" \"Who've what?\" Persephone said sharply. She remembered what Hades had told her about the sudden influx of mortal souls entering the Underworld. He had said it was because gods and goddesses were neglecting their duties - he'd never mentioned her mother. Would her mother really do that? \"Persephone you mustn't be angry with Demeter, she was concerned for you - all she could think about was finding you!\" \"So it's my fault all these people have died?\" Persephone gasped horrified. \"No! No! Of course not! None of this is your fault!\" Hermes tried to soothe Persephone. \"If Hades had been open and told us the truth instead of stalling none of this would have happened! But don't worry your mother is going to make sure this doesn't happen again - I doubt she'll let you out of her sight for a minute!\" Hermes clearly thought this was what Persephone wanted to hear, but it was in fact the complete opposite! Anger bubbled inside of her stomach, spreading through her veins like wildfire. Did no one care about what she wanted?! All she wanted was space! Some privacy and the choice to go where she please! She was about to voice this when footsteps sounded and she turned to see Hades walking behind her, his hands held behind his back. Reaching out with one hand he took her and kissed her on the lips, his tongue urgently pushing her lips apart and darting into her mouth. As he deepened the kiss Persephone couldn't help but respond, her hands went around his back, she found one of his own still behind him holding something. Still deep in the kiss her hands searched his hidden one curiously and she broke apart as she touched something moist. She looked at Hades horrified as she realised what he had done, she could feel them now - pomegranate seeds. They rested on the back of her tongue, she moved to cough - to spit them out but as she opened her mouth she drew in a breath by accident and three seeds slipped down her throat. \"How could you?\" She whispered in horror as he held out the pomegranate he'd been hiding behind his back. Looking at him closely she could see the tell-tale red stain on his lips and the spots of juice around his mouth from where he'd bitten into the fruit. \"Persephone!\" Hades cried out in horror as her knees gave way beneath her, before she hit the ground he swept her into his arms and held her securely. \"I'm sorry but I can't lose you, I can't let them annul our marriage.\" He whispered into her ear kissing it softly. \"She has eaten pomegranate seeds - you know the law Hermes. She is bound here.\" Persephone bit back a sob and shoved Hades away, her pity for him had evaporated. How could he do that!? \"How many?\" Hermes asked in an emotionless voice and Persephone looked up at him - was this it then? Was there no hope? \"Three.\" Hermes nodded and for a moment was silent. \"You had best come with me Hades...and bring Persephone.\" \"She has consumed pomegranate seeds!\" \"She has had only three. She is bound here yes, but there is nothing that says she is bound here permanently for she did not consume them all. Bring her. Zeus will make the decision of what is to be her fate.\" And with that Hermes disappeared, leaving husband and wife alone in the bitter cold throne room of the Underworld. It couldn't have been more than an hour later when Persephone found herself sitting in the gloriously bright golden throne room of Mount Olympus. Her eyes were dazzled by the colours and brightness; she had forgotten how overwhelming the home of the gods could be. She closed her eyes and buried her face in her hands, behind her, her mother clucked and ordered people to leave her be and give her some space. \"Mother please, I'm fine!\" She insisted fed up already of her mother watching over her constantly. \"Demeter! Give the girl some space.\" A thunderous voice roared making everyone jump to their feet. Somehow Persephone managed to stand up and curtsey to her father, King of the Gods, Zeus. \"Persephone.\" He took her hand and kissed her forehead. \"What's this I hear about you running away to the Underworld and marrying Hades?\" He smiled at her and Persephone frowned. \"I did not run away father, he kidnapped me!\" She looked around the room trying to locate Hades and found him standing beside a golden pillar looking lost. Her heart twisted at the sight of him looking so pitiful, so defeated. But only a little. She would not forget the misery he put her through, what he had forced her to do. She looked back at her father and blinked away tears. \"I made it clear to him I did not want to marry him, I told him all I wanted was to come home!\" Tears blurred her eyes but she blinked them back, she was standing in a room full of the greatest gods and goddesses and she could tell they would pass judgment not only on this matter but on her. They were judging whether she was worthy or just some lesser god barely better than a mortal. She would not cry and let them see her weakness. \"You see Zeus! She was forced! Annul the marriage!\" \"It's not as simple as that Demeter. The marriage may have been forced but it was carried out, and knowing Hades - consummated.\" Persephone blushed but stared at Zeus as the others in the room looked between her and Hades. She felt violated at the thought that most of them were right now picturing her slender naked body beneath his much heavier muscled one. \"I want the priest who wed them! I want him here right now!\" Demeter shrieked making Persephone flinch. \"Mother please, calm down - you know that is not possible. My head feels as if it might explode from being here, a mortals certainly would.\" She wasn't exaggerating when she said this, her head pounded from the dazzling colours that assaulted her vision. A human would not be able to look upon this without suffering such a severe headache, their head would literally combust. The thought made her shudder. \"Blindfold him then! It has been done before, I demand it done now!\" \"Just give her what she wants Zeus, bring the priest.\" Hades said coldly glaring at Demeter. \"She will not like what he has to say - his words will only confirm my marriage to Persephone, and then there is the matter of the pomegranate seeds.\" There was a hushed silence as Hades made this announcement, every eye in the room turned to look at Persephone. \"You ate?\" Zeus asked horrified. \"No I -\" Persephone shook her head and looked at Hermes for help. \"Does it count?\" \"I'm afraid it does...you did swallow the seeds after all.\" There was a silence where no one dared look anywhere but at Persephone. \"You ate food in the Underworld?\" Demeter whispered horrified dropping the hand that had been holding her daughter's shoulder in support. \"How could you be so foolish?!\" \"Summon the priest; I will hear what he has to say first although...with this new information Persephone...\" Zeus looked at her sadly and she could guess what was coming. She would have to go back to the Underworld, but would it be as Hades' wife? What would the point in going back be if I am not? She looked at Hades and bit her lip, she had been falling in love with him...but how could he have done this to her? \"Sit daughter, relax.\" Easier said than done. Persephone thought but she obeyed and sat down obediently. She looked down at her black clothing and shuddered; only she and Hades wore black. Her mother wore a deep forest green, Poseidon a toga of shimmering green and blue made to imitate his domain the ocean. Within minutes Hermes returned with two woodland nymphs leading the blindfolded priest who had performed the marriage. Persephone was suddenly thankful that she had given this man her blessing - for although it would condemn her it would at least protect him. She looked down at the floor torn between blocking out the questioning and listening, she didn't want to hear her fate - but she couldn't run from it. Not now. Zeus questioned the priest vigorously; as did Demeter who got a little too carried away sending the poor mortal into a frenzied panic. \"Mother! Leave him be!\" Persephone cried jumping to her feet. \"This was Hades doing - the man is a priest at one of his own temples, of course he had to obey what his God said!\" \"The goddess Persephone is indeed a great lady,\" the priest stammered. \"She saw the predicament I was in even then, she gave me her favour.\" Persephone flinched as the priest held out his hand sending the familiar smell of berries and a summer night's storm. A golden rose glimmered above the priest's hand and began to fade until it had disappeared once more, taking the scent of summer with it. \"Very well...you may take the priest back.\" Zeus dismissed the nymphs and they led the still blindfolded priest from Olympus back to earth. Persephone met her father's gaze squarely as he looked down at her. \"You claimed this marriage was forced...yet you gave the priest your blessing, and you consumed food? Not just any food but the seeds of a pomegranate!\" Persephone bit her lip; she desperately wanted to protest but could see how childish her argument would appear. 'Hades made me do it'? Although true she didn't think it would go down too well. \"I wanted none of this father, please do not send me back there - I cannot possibly spend an eternity in the Underworld. It may not kill me but...I think I would rather die.\" She couldn't look at Hades when she spoke. \"Do you love him?\" \"What?\" The question caught her off-guard that she wasn't sure who Zeus referred too. \"Hades.\" Her father said impatiently. \"Do you love him?\" Persephone bit her lip in thought, which was clearly answer enough for him. \"If you have to think about your answer then you must feel something for him. Persephone I'm sorry but I have no choice, you must return to the Underworld. Your marriage is legal and you are now bound there. However,\" Persephone looked up in hope as she heard that one word. \"As you only ate three seeds I am willing to compromise...you will spend half the year with your mother, you can spend the summer months with her. But as soon as the first leaf falls you must return to the Underworld where you will stay until the first bloom.\" \"NO!\" Demeter cried in anguish. \"She cannot return!\" \"It is law Demeter; your daughter is not exempt because of her status.\" Hades growled an ugly expression etched onto his normally handsome features. Persephone was glad that at least she would not have to return with him today - a fight would surely ensue. \"My word is final Demeter - be thankful she only ate three, any more and she could have been bound there permanently.\" With an angry curse Demeter left the mountain to one of her secluded spots. Persephone rolled her eyes feeling a wave of anger wash over her, how could her mother be angry when it was she who was being forced back to the Underworld? \"Does no one care what I think?\" She asked bitterly standing up. \"For a month I have been forced to do what someone else wants me to do, and now you're deciding where I shall spend my time? What about what I want?\" \"What you want is irrelevant my dear.\" Zeus said looking exhausted and Persephone came to realise her father had known her whereabouts for quite some time. \"I have made my decision and it is final.\" She looked over at Hades who looked a little pleased with himself, some of his smug arrogance was beginning to creep back into his personality. He had gotten what he wanted - partly, but she could tell he was pleased at not having lost her completely. Like it or not she would be going back to his domain. \"I shall never forgive you for this!\" She said to him and stormed from Mount Olympus back to her quaint cottage in the woodlands where she cried herself to sleep. Never before had Persephone both dreaded and anticipated the falling of the first leaf. The assumption she had, had in the Underworld about her mother becoming overbearing should she ever get free was true. Her first night back had been her only one alone so far, her mother had not believed that Hades would be content at having his wife beside him during the winter months and had set up escorts for wherever Persephone should go. She sometimes found herself longing to be back in the Underworld, at least Hades would leave her be - even if he did restrict where she could go sometimes. But it wasn't just her overbearing mother that made her anticipate her return to the Underworld. She missed Hades. As furious as she was with him for what he had done, she found that she did love him. Her father had been right - she'd had to think about her answer. If she hadn't loved him then surely she'd have been able to say no straight away? Of course her mother argued that if she did love him she'd have been able to answer yes, but too much had happened for her to allow herself to love Hades completely. How could you love the man who had kidnapped you and forced you into a marriage? To live in a world of death when she thrived among the living. Maybe it wasn't love, but there was certainly something there. Persephone groaned and pulled the bed cover over her head as her mother banged the door to her small cottage open. It was rude for gods to just materialise in another's dwelling, but her mother (or any of the others for that matter) didn't seem to comprehend that banging the door down and waltzing in was the same thing. \"What do you think you are doing here? You're not safe Persephone!\" Her mother scolded and yanked the covers off her daughter frowning in annoyance at the tell-tale tear stains on her daughter's face. \"Why are you moping over that despicable god? Do you think he is in the Underworld moping after you? No! He is going around his daily business and frolicking with nymphs.\" \"Hades doesn't 'frolic'.\" Persephone jumped to her husband's defence. As angry as she was with him she couldn't help defend him whenever her mother began verbally attacking him. She could say nothing about his activities with nymphs though, who was to say he wasn't taking one, or more, to his bed? He had six months without her, and while she would live the celibate life she found it hard thinking he would follow the same path. \"It doesn't matter what he does or does not do. What are you doing here? You know I do not want you out of my sight! Get up at once and come to Olympus.\" \"Mother -\" \"Now Persephone! Do as I say! I am your mother, you must obey me - goddess or not.\" Persephone glared at her mother but did as she bid. She had been right all along - she had escaped from one prison into another, she just wasn't sure which prison she would rather be free off yet. *** Persephone had been right in thinking Hades would take another to his bed, he had done so almost every night since her return to the world above. But he hadn't done it out of spite. He had enjoyed the companionship. Unlike the other Gods, namely Zeus, it had been rare for him to find a bed-partner. Mortals especially were less willing to go to bed with the God of the Underworld. They never quite grasped that an invitation from Zeus was a death sentence with the jealous Hera constantly smiting them, just look at poor Semele. He smiled thinking of how she had pleaded with him to let her go back to the Mortal world. How she would do anything. His eyes focused on the naked nymph below him, her expressionless face staring blankly up at him. Sighing he rolled off her and onto his back where he stared up at the stone ceiling of his bedchamber. \"Go.\" He commanded the nymph feeling the anger fire up inside of him. It was just like he had told Persephone, the nymphs here were mere shadows of their former selves. They felt nothing. They were cold, horrifyingly boring and possessed no sex drive. He was better off lying alone hugging the pillow that was smothered in Persephone's scent than resting beside one of those pitiful creatures. Rising from the bed he paced around the room not caring about his state of undress, those that served him were by now over the shock of seeing him bare. He had been restless ever since Persephone had been granted those six months of freedom. The thought he would have to spend half the year alone once more, without his beloved wife by his side, was torment. For the first few days he had drunk himself silly on ambrosia, not caring that his work had been neglected. However Zeus had been quick to pick him up on this, if only he had been as stern with Demeter as he had been with him! I have to do something for her, something she will love. He told himself, but what? He could make glorious meadows for her to visit, but he knew what she would think - nothing would compare to the world above. Where she could enjoy the real sun beating down on her skin. But maybe it would be something? He looked at the door of his bedchamber that led to his private bathing room and smiled. He knew what he could do, she may not be overjoyed with it - but it would be a start. *** The turning of the first leaf was fast approaching and Hades was becoming more excitable as the days faded past. He was almost like a mortal child except he remembered to keep his dignity in check, but only just. He knew that people realising Persephone was his weakness would lead to trouble, he would not allow them to take advantage of him - or endanger Persephone. He tuned his senses in carefully to the plantlife of the mortal world. Normally he didn't monitor such things, the death of a plant meant nothing to him - what should he care if a tree was felled? But now he took a keen interest in their lives, or at least until he had what he wanted. He smiled as he felt his powers spring out, seeking out death. Persephone was lounging next to a golden pool on Mount Olympus, the water was pleasantly warm and her right foot was nudging the surface, gently tracing patterns. She had long since given up on trying to find some privacy within the mortal realm. Instead she'd spent the best part of the six months on Mount Olympus or accompanying her mother to festivals held in the goddess' honour. \"Persephone?\" Guiltily she sat up and quickly placed the ambrosia she'd been about to drink behind her. It was normal for the gods to drink themselves into a stupor from the golden liquid, but she had always abstained from such behaviour. \"I'm sorry for disturbing you, especially since I'm not sure whether this news will bring you relief or grief...\" Persephone smiled weakly at Hermes, guessing what he was about to tell her. \"The leaves are turning aren't they?\" Hermes nodded and she quickly rose to her feet. \"Does my mother wish to see me?\" \"Yes...but I should warn you, she's not in the best of moods - she's been to your father several times in petition for you to remain.\" Persephone closed her eyes to stop herself from rolling them, she should have guessed her mother would not take this well. \"Zeus has tried consolidating her, reminding that it is only for six months and that Hades could easily petition you to stay down there for longer.\" \"He what?\" Persephone followed Hermes looking confused. \"You ate the seeds of a pomegranate. Technically you never should have left the Underworld, the law states you ate the fruit of the Underworld and you are in fact bound to it. However Hades was persuaded to release you for six months, Zeus pointed out to him privately the extra work that would be involved in keeping you down there the full year. Demeter would ignore her duties completely, more people would die - he'd hardly have time to look at you let alone spend time with you. Your father decided to remind Demeter that by kicking up a fuss about letting you return to the Underworld Hades might feel inclined to push the fact you should never have been allowed to leave.\" Persephone nodded feeling fear well up inside, would this never go away? Fear of being under the control of others, never being able to live the life she wanted. Hermes paused in front of the door to her mother's chambers and looked at her with concern. \"I appreciate this must be hard for you, Pers.\" She smiled at the use of his nickname for her, he hadn't used it in so long she'd forgotten the use of it. \"As impossible as this advice may seem...just don't argue with her. Nod, smile and agree...just be careful not to commit yourself to a promise you can't keep. Hopefully she'd have gotten the rant over with by now.\" Knocking Hermes waited for an answer before opening the door and bowing Persephone through. \"Good luck.\" He murmured to her before shutting the door quietly and leaving her alone with her mother. \"Mother,\" Persephone crossed the room and embraced her mother kissing her on the cheek and kneeling before her. \"Hermes has told you?\" Never before had she heard her mother sound so cold, it was as if a winter frost had bitten into her skin. She shivered and withdrew slightly answering with a small nod. \"How could you have been so foolish Persephone? You knew not to eat anything from that awful place, and yet you did! How could you?\" Persephone looked down at the golden tiled floor and said nothing, she blinked back tears. She'd foolishly hoped the parting would go better than this, that her mother wouldn't be too upset knowing she would be back after six months. \"All I can do is apologise mother. I did not do it maliciously, I was miserable down there! I had not eaten once! When I heard the news I would be coming home I got excited, it is no excuse but it is the truth. And I apologise profusely if my foolishness has offended you.\" Rising to her feet Persephone looked at her mother. \"Now if you will excuse me, I am sure my husband is waiting for me...I think it unwise to keep him waiting too long.\" She kissed her mother farewell and turned to leave, Hermes waited outside for her. \"It could have gone worse I suppose.\" He smiled reassuringly at her and Persephone nodded. She would have liked a more touching, less harsh goodbye...but at least her mother did not go off into a rant. \"Hades is waiting for you at the entrance to the Underworld. I will escort you there.\" \"Thank you Hermes.\" \"Persephone!\" A small cry of shock escaped Persephone's lips as Hades enveloped her in a bone crushing hug. For a fleeting second she felt her face press itself into his shoulder and her arms reach up to hug him back. But as she breathed in his scent she snapped to her senses. She pushed away and turned to thank Hermes, only to find him gone and the sunlight she had momentarily been standing in had changed into solid rock, sighing she turned back to face Hades. \"I missed you.\" He whispered taking her hand and gripping it tightly. \"Really? I heard you had company.\" There had been a few whispered rumours, all meant to be kept away from the young goddess's ears. Hades face said it all and she shook her head blinking back tears. \"How could you? You said you loved me, you forced me down here and then forced me into a marriage with you! And when I'm granted a glimmer of hope, that I can go home for half the year...you show this love by cheating on me as soon as I am gone? How can I believe a single word you say to me Hades? How can I ever trust you?\" \"It was a mistake.\" \"Of course. She fell into bed - she fell into our room no doubt! And you just happened to stumble on top -\" \"Persephone don't be crass.\" Hades said sharply. \"I'm sorry I hurt you but I was grief stricken, I missed you and I wanted you beside me. It was a foolish moment, and one I can promise you I have not, nor will I ever repeat it.\" Seeing no point in arguing Persephone merely nodded. She was too tired to argue, was that how it would be from now on? Arguing with Hades and her mother when she returned to each world at the end of her time? \"Come, I've prepared a feast.\" \"Hades...can I...can I eat here now?\" Persephone stopped him midstep and looked up at him. \"If I eat am I bound here for eternity? Or will I still be allowed home for half the year?\" Hades sighed and paused before answering her, cupping her face in one hand he kissed her softly. \"Hermes told you I could petition you remain here for eternity already, has he not?\" Persephone nodded not sure if she would like where this was going. \"Yes Persephone you can eat, technically you should be bound here for eternity already however due to a small technicality you have been released from the bond. This leaves you free to eat, your mother and I both signed a contract that your father created. It states that while you are down here within the six months you can eat and drink as you please. You can dedicate yourself to the Underworld wholly without repercussions. However.\" Persephone flinched at the tone of his voice. \"If you eat outside of the time you are meant to be here...then you are bound forever, and nothing your mother or Zeus say or do can change that. That means if you stay an hour later, or arrive an hour early, and happen to eat something...\" He held up his hands in a helpless gesture and Persephone nodded. \"Thank you.\" She said quietly, \"I appreciate you telling me that, I know you could have kept it to yourself and detained me for an hour - just for a quick goodbye dinner.\" Hades smiled at her and wrapped an arm around her waist. \"If I am honest the thought crossed my mind...several times. In fact it has never left it; I thought it best to warn you...just in case I do try.\" Persephone smiled slightly and allowed him to guide her to the dining room. She pushed his affair to the back of her mind, she wanted to scream and rage at him but she knew deep down it would do no good. She was stuck here until the earth came back to life for the spring and summer months. After dinner Hades gave Persephone no opportunity to decide what to do. Slipping behind her chair he began kissing the back of her neck, gathering her hair and wrapping it around his hand luxuriously. \"Come to bed with me?\" He whispered huskily in her ear. Persephone bit her lip nervously and stared at the wall ahead until it blurred. Carefully, her head feeling as if it were made of stone, she nodded. Gently Hades pulled her up from her seat and gathered her up into his arms. \"I've missed you.\" He breathed laying her on the bed; he laid on top of her and kissed her gently. Persephone surprised herself by responding to the kiss, her hands ran through his hair and down his back. She slipped his toga from his shoulders unclasping buckles that kept his clothing as a barrier to her. Her own clothes soon joined his on the floor and within seconds the pair were a tangle of arms and legs, exploring each and every part of each other's bodies. Persephone bit back a cry as Hades pushed inside her and arched her back trying to bring him closer. \"Don't.\" He whispered in her ear. \"Don't be quiet.\" That was all the encouragement she needed, cries of ecstasy passed through her lips and she felt Hades pulsing with pleasure as each one burst forth from her. After what felt like hours Hades collapsed onto his back beside Persephone, one arm resting behind his head the other slipping around her smooth waist pulling her close. \"I've missed you.\" He murmured nibbling her earlobe gently, the sensation sent fresh pulses of pleasure coursing through her body and she let out a moan. \"I've missed you too...\" Persephone said and realised it was true. She draped a blanket over them both and rested against his broad chest which still heaved from his earlier excursions. Closing her eyes Persephone allowed herself to drift off to sleep, the most peaceful one since Hades had first taken her. The months had turned into years, the years into centuries and soon Persephone had begun to settle into her strange routine. During her six months above the Underworld, Persephone witnessed the change the mortals brought upon the world. She witnessed the destruction of the old temples and several civilisations; she roamed the globe and witnessed monarchies put to death and new governments established. The old gods were forgotten and new ones were worshipped in their place. Yet the Underworld never changed. She became thankful for the consistency she found in Hades' domain. While the world above became a world filled of jealousy, weapons and war the Underworld remained quiet although it still depressed her to be down there. Persephone was sitting on a grassy patch in the middle of a bustling city, the leaves were a rich and vibrant green but there was a definite chill to air. She leant back and ran a hand through her silky midnight black hair. She was able to blend with mortals with ease now, no one believed in the Greek gods so who did she have to fear of discovering her identity? She was dressed in black jeans and a black vest. She closed her eyes and took in a deep breath, it was no longer as fresh and crisp as it had been in the ties of Ancient Greece. Now she could taste the fumes of cars, the electric tang from the phone masts which cluttered the once beautiful countryside. It was strange, over two thousand years ago she would have longed for companionship. To be closer to mortals, but her mother had forbidden it. Now she could walk beside a mortal and share a smile, a quick glance, without even a tremor that her mother would find out. She could be in the heart of a city. And all she wanted was peace and quiet, the lush green grass of a field. Something scraped across the back of her hand and she looked down in shock, a once green and lush leaf was steadily crisping and turning golden before her eyes. A smile twisted her lips upwards but it was tinged with sadness. Autumn. She looked down to her right and found a beautiful flower with petals as red as blood stroking against her thumb. She plucked the flower gently from the ground and stood up as the earth cracked and opened. Looking over her shoulder she saw a crowd of people looking at the growing hole, with a laugh she turned and stepped backwards plunging into the hole. She heard the screams of terror from the mortals, the shouts for help for the girl who'd fallen. But the hole was gone as quickly as it appeared with no trace of the dark haired girl. In six months time these mortals would have forgotten her, the whole episode would be seen as a dream. Hades caught his wife swiftly and set her on her feet, before she could greet him, his mouth was upon hers and he was crushing her against the wall. For Hades the six months Persephone spent free from the Underworld were too long, for Persephone it was a conflict of emotions. The six months with mortals went too quick. As Hades presented her with a pomegranate she bit down into the fruit greedily, as she chewed the seeds she met Hades' eyes and smiled at him thoughtfully. Both were in silent agreement, her six months in the Underworld passed too quickly. As much as she loathed the darkness, Persephone was overcome with love for her husband and missed him when she was above ground.",

      "And this had been one of them.",
      "Standing up Persephone looked around to make sure the area really was empty, she was hot and longed to cool down - the clear water of the river was too tempting and she was going to give in to it's calling.",
      "She slipped her toga off, placed her golden bracelets and choker on top of it and carefully stepped into the water, soon she was submerged so that only her chin upwards was free of the water.",
      "She laughed and swam a few lengths back and forth, enjoying the cool water and imagining her troubled thoughts flowing away with the current.",
      "She became so absorbed in swimming she didn't notice the slow change in the weather, how the clouds seemed to appear from nowhere sending a slow and steady darkness across the land.",
      "Hades had no purpose for leaving the Underworld that day; he had merely grown bored with the Underworld setting.",
      "Of being constantly pestered by souls who begged for their lives back, for one more chance to prove that they were worthy of life.",
      "It got tiresome after a while.",
      "Occasionally it was nice to get above ground, Olympus was too bright and he found the gossip of his fellows Gods and Goddesses tiresome.",
      "Unlike them he had a full-time job and didn't have the luxury of lounging around Olympus all day and night!",
      "The sound of splashing caught his attention; a grin twisted his surprisingly handsome features.",
      "For a God who spent so much time in the Underworld he was surprisingly tanned.",
      "His hair was a deep jet black, his eyes were just as black and some would say emotionless.",
      "People could stare for centuries into those bottomless orbs and not see a glimmer of emotion.",
      "That was if they dared.",
      "Not many people were brave enough to look Hades in the eyes; he wasn't one for tolerating defiance.",
      "He was clothed in a pair of black trousers and a black shirt, keeping to the shadows his dark figure was easily hidden as he spied the beauty swimming in the lake.",
      "He was expecting to find a mortal, or maybe even a nymph.",
      "He wasn't expecting to see the beautiful Persephone, nor was he expecting to find her swimming bare.",
      "He turned away surprised at himself, it wasn't his fault if the young woman had chosen to swim naked where anyone could spy on her!",
      "Still...he felt as if watching her would spoil something...but what he had no idea.",
      "A small plot was forming in his mind; he was lonely in the Underworld and female companionship would make things better.",
      "Of course she probably wouldn't be willing, not at first anyway.",
      "He turned away and walked deeper into the shadows, purposely stepping on dry twigs so that they crunched under his feet.",

      "** Persephone looked up startled at the sound of cracking twigs and crunching leaves, someone was nearby!",
      "She swam towards the back of the river and leapt out, her skin drying almost instantly.",
      "It wasn't until she turned her face to look at the sun that she realised the sky had changed from a brilliant azure blue to steel grey, the ground was covered in shadows and the still air was beginning to pick up into a strong wind.",
      "This can't be a sign of good things to come, Persephone thought a sensation of fear creeping into the pit of her stomach.",
      "There was an unnatural feel to the air; this was no ordinary change in the weather.",
      "Her mind turned back to the sound of snapping twigs and she walked closer towards the trees, peering into the darkness to see if she could spot whoever had been there.",
      "It might not have even been a person; she tried to tell herself that it could have been a rabbit or a deer.",
      "But she knew it had to be a person.",
      "The urge to call out was strong but she kept quiet, she didn't know whether this person was friend or foe and she didn't want to put herself in unnecessary danger.",
      "She was more than capable of looking after herself, she was a goddess after all, but she didn't like hurting people.",
      "Besides...what if whoever was making all that noise was connected to the on-coming storm?",
      "She looked down at her feet, a small bundle of flowers lay blooming, their petals wide open and they seemed to mourn for the sun that had disappeared behind the clouds.",
      "She leant down and picked one up, she lifted it from the ground but instead of dying the flower seemed to move towards her.",
      "The petals moved gently as if in a wave and Persephone lowered her nose to breathe in the calming sweet scent.",
      "She often picked flowers; they comforted her and soothed her worried nerves as this flower was doing right now.",
      "It gave her the strength to walk deeper into the forest.",
      "*",
      "** Hades grinned as he watched Persephone drawing closer to where he was hiding; well hiding wasn't really the word for it.",
      "More waiting.",
      "As she drew closer to him he slipped behind a tree and approached her from behind.",
      "He wasn't worried about her recognising him; they had never met face to face.",
      "Of course Hades had seen her; sometimes the coming and goings of his fellow deities could affect the population of his Underworld.",
      "However Persephone had never added to it, in fact Hades had noticed she was often kept away from any kind of civilisation.",
      "\"Is it safe for someone as beautiful as yourself to be wandering the forests unescorted?\"",
      "He almost laughed as the young goddess jumped.",
      "\"Forgive me I didn't mean to startle you,\" he leant forward in a light bow.",
      "\"Allow me to introduce myself, my name is Damien.\"",
      "He held out his hand.",
      "\"Persephone,\" the young goddess replied taking his almost shyly, her eyes looking him up and down discreetly.",
      "Hades brought her hand to his lips and brushed them along it gently.",
      "He could smell roses radiating from her skin, she smelt like summer and spring...she smelt of life, warm, fragrant and sweet.",

      "His chariot was nearby, close to the clearing that led towards the city of Athens, if he could get her close to it...",
      "\"Please, allow me to accompany you - it is not safe for you to be wandering around on your own.\"",
      "He could see she wanted to refuse, that she was opening her mouth to that very thing.",
      "Quickly Hades acted on his feet, he knew little about Persephone - but he knew she was kind.",
      "And kind people did not generally like to offend.",
      "\"I would never forgive myself if you refused and something was to happen to you, please permit me to walk you to the clearing at least.\"",
      "He could see her battling against the decision, but soon a small nervous smile broke out on her face and she nodded in acceptance.",
      "*",
      "** Persephone was careful to keep a slight distance between herself and Damien, she didn't know why she didn't trust him...she just had a feeling.",
      "You're being paranoid, she scolded herself, he's done nothing to harm you - made no movements or given you any indication that he has intentions of hurting you.",
      "Mentally she shook her head; her mother's paranoia of someone violating her daughter was beginning to rub off on her.",
      "As they neared the clearing a small splash of colour caught her eye.",
      "Smiling she paused walking and knelt down to pick up the blood red flower that grew out of the ground, it seemed lonely and she thought it strange that it was the only one there.",
      "She plucked it from the ground intending it as a gift to thank Damien for walking her this far.",
      "Yet when she picked it the ground beneath her opened up, strong arms encircled her waist and she felt herself thrown into a carriage she sworn had not been there only a moment ago.",
      "It had been too easy.",
      "The flower had been one of the trick ones he had carefully lying around, they were spelled so that only people he wished to see them would see them.",
      "At that moment Persephone had been one of them, in her moment of confusion when the ground split open he had acted.",
      "His right arm had snaked around her slender waist; the feeling of her warm body against his gave him a sense of pleasure - when had been the last time he'd held a woman close?",
      "Although this wasn't quite the same, holding a kicking woman was quite different to holding a lover.",
      "He threw her into the carriage, a little more forcefully than he wished but the force of collision momentarily stunned her giving him time to climb into the carriage and get it in motion.",
      "\"Who are you?!\"",
      "Persephone cried as the carriage lurched forward, the horse like creatures that pulled it in motion leapt into the air and dived into the trench she had created.",
      "Hades looked at her, for a moment he felt a flicker of pity - she looked scared and betrayed.",
      "\"If you spent time on Olympus you would know me by sight.",
      "But I'm sure you know my name,\" he took his time to speak waiting for the chariot to land in the Underworld before giving her a full explanation.",
      "He pulled her up gently and helped her from the chariot.",
      "\"My name is Hades,\" he said as a loud rumbling noise filled the air.",
      "He watched as Persephone looked around, only at the last second did her eyes tilt upwards to the ceiling where she witnessed the edges of the ground above them moving closer together.",
      "Slowly darkness descended upon them, a chill swept through them - there would be no sun down here to keep her warm.",
      "\"Hades?\"",
      "She whispered the name questioningly as her eyes turned from the ceiling back towards him.",
      "\"Lord of the Underworld?\"",
      "He nodded and plucked the blood red flower from her fingertips placing it in the centre of her bun.",
      "The flower she had picked at first was clutched in her left hand, her knuckles white with terror.",
      "Yet this was the only sign of fear she showed.",
      "Her body didn't tremble, her eyes betrayed no flicker of fear and her voice was sturdy as she spoke.",
      "\"Why did you bring me here?\"",
      "\"Isn't it obvious?\" Persephone stared at him openly shocked - what sort of question was that to ask?",
      "How was the purpose of any abduction obvious?!",
      "Before she could voice an angry opinion Hades explained.",
      "\"I know that your mother keeps you away from prying eyes, secludes you from all company except for that of Nymphs and woodland creatures -\" \"I can see why if this is what would happen if I were to mingle openly!\"",
      "She snapped.",
      "Hades carried on as if he had not been interrupted.",
      "\"You're lonely; you long for conversation - for intelligent conversation, not just the mindless natter of the Nymphs.\"",
      "He took a step closer to her, his hand cupping her chin holding her head firmly so she couldn't look away from him.",
      "\"I crave company, we are in similar positions.",
      "I am trapped, charged with a duty I didn't wish to have.",
      "Kept away from all kinds of company, the only companionship I have is begging souls - mindlessly pleading for something I cannot grant them.\"",
      "\"So you abduct me?",
      "What do you hope to gain?\"",
      "She tried to shake her head free from his grip but he held her firmly.",
      "\"True companionship, a wife.\"",
      "He ignored her scoff, in time she'd accept that this was meant to be.",
      "Gently he released her face and she tore the flower from her hair throwing it at him angrily.",
      "The gold band holding her bun in place came free with the flower and her midnight black hair tumbled around her, cascading down her shoulders and waist in a silky river.",
      "Hades was mesmerised, she was beautiful...",
      "He reached for her suddenly, ensnaring her in an unbreakable grip, his lips descended onto hers.",
      "She was losing control of her fear, he could taste it on her lips as he kissed her, he could feel her breaking out in a cold sweat and he couldn't help the cruel grin as he broke the kiss but kept hold of her.",
      "\"You should just accept this Persephone,\" he whispered lowering his lips to hers once more.",
      "He stopped barely a centimetre away from her mouth, leaving her in fear of another kiss.",
      "\"You cannot fight me, here your powers are worthless - and the more you use them the more they'll drain from you.",
      "A little precaution to stop souls escaping, only the Lord of the Underworld has use of his full powers.",
      "You may as well be mortal.\"",
      "If she behaved perhaps he would tell her about the Olympus stone, the stone that protected Gods and Goddesses from the draining power of the Underworld.",
      "When he could trust her he would go and fetch it for her, but only when he could trust she would not try to escape.",
      "\"You're lying.\"",
      "She knew she was clinging to a false hope, she could feel herself weakening slowly.",
      "She stepped away from him and looked up at the ceiling, even if she wasn't being drained of her powers she didn't really have the power to open the ceiling.",
      "She was a goddess of spring, of living things...of beauty.",
      "Her powers here would have been useless anyway.",
      "She stepped over to a wall and rested her hand on it, concentrating on a small spot of the rock she willed a flower to grow.",
      "Normally this would happen in the blink of an eye, now it seemed to take an age.",
      "The flower seemed hesitant, as if it didn't want to grow - something Persephone couldn't blame it for.",
      "Who'd want to grow here?",
      "After an age the flower finally finished blooming, for a moment Hades found himself admiring the rose.",
      "But then the Underworlds own magic took hold.",
      "The flower wilted and crumbled to ash on the floor at the young goddess's feet.",
      "\"Your powers will adapt.\"",
      "\"When?\"",
      "That was a question Hades didn't want to answer right now.",
      "\"When?\"",
      "\"Only the Lord of the Underworld has full powers in the Underworld, as is his right.",
      "If he wishes his wife may have full control over her full powers, or a portion of them.\"",
      "He watched as the words took meaning to Persephone.",
      "Her flawless creamy skin drained of all colour, she looked as if she had been confronted by the Gorgon sister Medusa.",
      "\"Wife?\"",
      "She whispered her sapphire eyes slowly looking into his, searching his face for the smallest trace that would confirm this as a lie.",
      "\"No. I won't marry you!\"",
      "Hades laughed cruelly, he didn't even try to bite it back.",
      "\"Do you really think you have a choice in this?",
      "Do you think I would bring you down here just for you to say no and go back above?\"",
      "He shook his head and reached out to grab her once more.",
      "\"You can lie to me, tell me you were happy being forced to stay hidden - but we both know it is nothing more than a lie.",
      "Besides, why should I be the only one forced to live down here?",
      "Do you really think I enjoy being surrounded by death constantly?",
      "Do you think I enjoy spending an eternity by myself?\"",
      "\"You can't force me to marry you!\"",
      "\"I can force you to do pretty much anything I want.\"",

      "How dare she try and defy him?",
      "She was in his domain!",
      "Roughly he pushed her against the wall and began ripping at her toga, ignoring her screams of protest and pleading he didn't stop until it was shredded and she was left clutching desperately at the fabric to cover herself.",
      "\"I can claim you right here, I can take you right now - or any time I wish.",
      "Never forget that Persephone.\"",
      "His anger was clear, the young goddess was truly terrified now.",
      "Blinking back tears she nodded faintly once.",
      "The sight of her eyes shining seemed to calm Hades down, he found himself in admiration of her.",
      "Any mortal damsel would be sobbing at his feet pleading for mercy, yet here she was...scared witless yet still trying to remain in control of herself.",
      "As quickly as it had come his anger subsided.",
      "Sighing he tugged off his black shirt and held it out to her.",
      "\"The only thing I cannot force you to do is love me.\"",
      "He said quietly as she took the offered shirt and pulled it over her head.",
      "He was so much taller than her the shirt stopped halfway above her knees, and although it was a short-sleeve shirt on him it went past her elbows almost.",
      "\"But I hope that is something you can learn to do in time.\"",
      "The look in her eyes told him she doubted this would happen, he didn't blame her but he could always help.",
      "\"Come.",
      "Let me show you to your room.\"",
      "He held out his hand for her to take, instead she scooped up the shredded toga and clutched it tightly.",
      "Sighing Hades turned and hoped that she would at least follow.",
      "Persephone followed him reluctantly, she didn't want to be shown to any rooms - she wanted to go home.",
      "How could she have been angry at her mother when at least she was kept confined to beautiful areas?",
      "There was nothing beautiful about the Underworld!",
      "She tugged the shirt self-consciously and continued clutching her torn toga, why was she holding onto it?",
      "He'd shredded it beyond repair, yet she didn't want to let go.",
      "It was as if the toga symbolised her freedom...let go of the toga and she would let go of her freedom.",
      "\"For now these will be your rooms.\"",
      "Hades gently guided her into a large room and Persephone looked around.",
      "It was depressing.",
      "The walls were stone.",
      "The floors were stone.",
      "She wandered over to the double bed and tapped it gently with her feet.",
      "Stone.",
      "She sat down on it and back a sigh - the mattress was feather soft and seemed immune to the feeling of stone beneath it.",
      "\"What do you think?\" Persephone looked at him bitterly thinking it best not to answer.",
      "\"What do you mean these are my rooms 'for now'?\"",
      "\"When we're married -\" \"We're not going to be married.\"",
      "She flinched as Hades looked at her with menacing eyes, she looked down at the shredded toga and decided to keep her mouth shut from now on.",

      "\"You will obviously sleep with me in my quarters.",
      "The move won't be too far,\" he smiled and Persephone could have sworn his eyes glittered cruelly.",
      "He walked over to the wall to the left side of the door; it was now she noticed the black door.",

      "Hades stood up as she remained motionless and began to put a sample of each of the dishes onto her plate, her poured a liberal amount of sauce and salad onto the plate.",
      "\"What harm can one bite do?",
      "You know better than to fear poisoning.\"",
      "\"I've not forgotten what I am - do you think I could forget I will never die?\"",
      "She asked him sourly, she was beginning to resent her Goddess status.",
      "If she was truly stuck here...it would be forever.",
      "Sighing she stabbed a piece of pork covered in the sauce and added some salad to it.",
      "She looked at the food suspiciously, in with the sauce and with the salad were small seeds.",
      "\"What's it made of?\"",
      "She asked Hades not really caring as she brought the fork to her mouth.",
      "Her tongue was almost tasting the morsel when he replied.",
      "\"Pomegranates.\"",
      "\"What?!\"",
      "Hades sighed as the fork was thrown onto the plate - he'd been so close.",
      "It wasn't tricking exactly, he had told her honestly what was in it when she had asked.",
      "It was her fault she'd asked too late.",
      "Except she hadn't asked too late.",
      "But he had given his answer a split second too soon.",
      "She was halfway standing up before Hades had seized her wrist keeping her in place.",
      "\"I am not stupid,\" she hissed at him, \"I know what happens if I eat those seeds!",
      "Do you think you can trick me like that?\"",
      "\"It's not tricking - pomegranate seeds are the food of the Underworld, I thought you'd know that.\"",
      "It wasn't completely a lie.",
      "He had thought she'd known that, he was just hoping she'd have forgotten to even think about it.",
      "Persephone shook her head at him in disgust and Hades tightened his grip slightly on her wrist.",
      "\"I wasn't tricking you!",
      "But do you not realise how easy this would be for you?",
      "You cannot leave the Underworld anyway -\" \"So you permanently try to bind me to it?\"",
      "He had no reply for that.",
      "\"I want to go home.\"",
      "\"Well you can't.\"",
      "Hades snapped at her coldly his eyes blazing.",
      "\"This is your home now.",
      "Whether or not you eat the pomegranate seeds you're still staying here.\"",
      "He dropped her wrist roughly so it thudded against her side.",
      "\"The next full moon we will be wed.\" \"No.\"",
      "Persephone shook her head stubbornly.",
      "\"You don't have a choice in this.",
      "Even on Olympus your powers are nothing compared to mine.",
      "You're a goddess yes, but a young one.\"",
      "Persephone scowled - she heard the hidden meaning in his phrase 'young one'.",
      "He meant lesser.",
      "She spat on the stone floor close to his feet to show her anger and stormed from the room.",
      "Hades watched in silence as she left and rubbed his forehead wearily.",
      "He was going the wrong way about this he knew, but the damage was done...he'd have to win her over somehow.",
      "Feeling rejected he ate his dinner alone, the nymphs had left him in silence knowing he preferred to eat alone.",
      "But he had thought it would be different with Persephone.",
      "She was beautiful and there was something different about her compared to the other goddesses.",
      "Perhaps it was because she rarely spent time on Mount Olympus.",
      "He didn't know what was different or why she was, but she was.",
      "Finishing his dinner Hades left his plate and went in search of Persephone.",
      "He didn't need to look around, she didn't know her way around the Underworld so there was really only one place she'd be.",
      "\"Persephone, can I come in?\"",
      "He asked knocking on her door softly.",
      "He waited for an answer and knocked again but when he got no reply a second time he opened the door and peered in.",
      "He felt his heart twist (an unusual feeling for him) at the sight that greeted him.",
      "Persephone lay curled up in a tight ball on her bed, her knees were drawn up to her chest and her forehead rested on them.",
      "Her waist length midnight black hair was splayed around her, covering her like some sort of blanket and helping her to blend in with the black bedding.",
      "As he moved closer he could see her shoulders moving up and down rapidly, his heart twisted even tighter and a pang of guilt struck him like lightning.",
      "What was wrong with him?",
      "\"Persephone.\"",
      "He said sitting beside her and reaching out to squeeze her shoulder gently.",
      "\"Please just leave me alone,\" she whispered in a defeated voice.",
      "\"You've got what you wanted.\"",
      "He wanted to contradict her, to tell her that this was far from what he wanted.",
      "Centuries of being alone, of having a heart encased in stone prevented him from opening up.",
      "Sighing he leant over and brushed her hair away from her face softly, he kissed her cheek trying his best to ignore the way her body tensed up at the contact.",
      "Without another word he stood up and crossed short distance towards his own chambers.",
      "He hoped she would be more willing to accept these circumstances by their wedding.",
      "He didn't want anything to tarnish the day, or the night.",
      "He consulted the lunar chart on his wall to see when the next full moon was, he realised he'd not given himself much time.",
      "According to the chart the wedding was to take place in five days time.",
      "Had a month really passed already?",
      "When you were a god time had no importance, it just passed to them like a second did to a mortal.",
      "Perhaps it was better that it was so soon though, soon Demeter would realise her daughter was missing.",
      "He gave himself another two days at the most, but by then surely someone would have noticed Persephone's disappearance.",
      "Shaking his head as he lost himself deep in thought Hades entered his private study and sat down at the desk.",
      "Five days was a short time, he'd best begin the preparations now.",
      "*",
      "** Persephone woke up the next morning with sore damp eyes, her hair clung to her face in patches and she grimaced.",
      "She didn't need to look in the mirror to know what sight would greet her.",
      "Red and puffy sapphire blue eyes, a tear streaked face that was deathly pale and covered in splotches, straggled midnight black hair that looked as if it'd not been brushed in weeks.",
      "She was hardly beautiful now.",
      "If Hades could see her now maybe he would be repulsed, maybe he would let her go home!",
      "She quickly shoved that thought aside, the thought of anyone seeing her this way, seeing her so weak and pathetic was sickening.",
      "It'd been bad enough that he had witnessed her crying last night, but it had been too much.",
      "He really meant to keep her here; binding her with pomegranate seeds had shown her he was serious.",
      "This was not some whim where he would simply release her a century later, he wanted her for keeps.",
      "Trying to forget about the events that would unfold she bathed and washed her hair and face vigorously.",
      "She longed for her magic so she could dry and style her hair but the Underworld had by now truly sapped her powers.",
      "She may as well be mortal.",
      "Wrapping a towel around herself securely she closed the door leading to the en-suite behind her and lay down on the bed.",
      "Everything here was so dark and depressing...maybe if she had some colour, something pretty to look at she wouldn't feel so...well dead inside.",
      "She barely had time to think about this before a soft tapping at the door snapped her from her thoughts.",
      "\"Go away Hades!\"",
      "She yelled debating whether or not to find something she could hurl at him if he dared enter.",
      "Just as last night though he ignored her wishes to be alone and simply opened the door.",
      "She blushed furiously as he entered followed once more by the dull, grey, lost looking nymphs.",
      "She could see the smirk on his face as he looked her up and down, taking in every detail of her exposed body that wasn't protected by the towel.",
      "\"Time seems to escape me,\" he said bowing almost mockingly to her.",
      "\"The full moon is now four days away - this gives us very little time to prepare.\"",
      "\"So call the wedding off.\"",
      "Persephone hissed holding her chin high as he continued to look her up and down.",
      "\"My dear don't be so silly, I've waited long enough for a companion I don't see any reason to wait any longer.",
      "We simply need to start the preparations early,\" he indicated to the nymphs who all looked down at the floor.",
      "It was now Persephone noticed that each nymph was holding something; scissors, measuring tape, fabric and sewing equipment.",
      "\"I want you out.\"",
      "Persephone ordered Hades; she could see no point in arguing about this and making him angry.",
      "\"I will not have you eyeing me up.\"",
      "\"I would never do such a thing; I did not watch you bathe yesterday.\"",
      "Persephone's blood ran cold, so someone had been watching her while she swam!",
      "\"I do not want anything to spoil our wedding night,\" Hades whispered crossing the room to stand beside her.",
      "\"I want it to be special,\" he whispered in her ear resting one hand on the small of her back.",
      "\"For the best of us.\"",
      "For a moment she thought he was going to kiss her.",
      "One hand was on the back of her neck while the other remained on the small of her back, her skin tingled on her neck was his hand rested and even through the towel she was uncomfortably aware of the closeness of his hand to her bare skin.",
      "His lips descended, almost meeting hers but stopping barely a millimetre away.",
      "He smiled mockingly, bowing once more he turned to the nymphs and gave them instructions of how he wanted the dress to resemble, waving his hand rolled up pieces of scrolls appeared and he handed them to the nearest one.",
      "Without so much as a glance at Persephone he left.",
      "Persephone remained unusually silent as the nymphs swarmed around her draping the measuring tape across her body and recording the measurements.",
      "Normally she'd be in deep conversation with nymphs, but these were strange ones...they were like...",
      "Dead, she realised shocked.",
      "It was now she realised that these were the spirits of dead nymphs, spending an eternity of servitude to Hades.",
      "She suppressed a shudder at the thought.",
      "Was this how her life was to be?",
      "A life of serving Hades, although rather than making him meals and cleaning up after him she was to lay down with him at night, kiss him and bear his children?",
      "It wasn't exactly the most appealing of eternities.",
      "She didn't even care that no one was asking her opinion of the dress, she just watched in helpless silence as they draped the fabric around her and slowly moulded it into a dress.",
      "When she felt as if she might scream from frustration the nymphs deftly removed a number of pins and took the now dress-like fabric from her.",
      "They left as they had come - in silence.",
      "Throwing on a toga she made her bed and sat on the edge, it was so uncomfortable it was driving her crazy.",
      "She could feel the stone under the mattress; it was hard on her back and made her feel like she was sleeping on rocks.",
      "Four days, she thought not realising that tears were once more trickling down her face.",
      "I have to get out of here.",
      "She told herself, I'm not bound to the Underworld...not yet.",
      "But in four days time...who's to say I won't be?",
      "Maybe I won't need pomegranate seeds to bind me here once I'm married to him.",
      "I have to get out...and soon.",
      "It was two days before the wedding.",
      "Hades sat across the dining table studying his young bride-to-be as she simply stared at the plate in front of her.",
      "She refused to eat; she knew that he was hiding pomegranate seeds in her food.",
      "It wasn't so much he was hiding them; they were a common part of Underworld dining.",
      "\"You need to eat.\"",
      "He said softly.",
      "\"No I don't.\"",
      "Was the stony reply, sapphire eyes flicked up from the plate to glare at him.",
      "\"I'm a goddess; I can't die or get sick.",
      "So don't think you can force me to eat with idle threats about my health.\"",
      "Hades shook his head and continued his own meal; there was no point in arguing with her.",
      "She was right; starving herself would do nothing to her.",
      "The only damage it would do, would be making her weak, and since she couldn't use her powers anyway that would have no lasting damage on her.",
      "\"I've heard myths,\" she said suddenly out of the blue.",
      "\"Of mortals, mortals that are still alive coming into the Underworld.\"",
      "Hades looked back up at her, he could see where this was going and he couldn't help but feel a little relieved.",
      "\"It occasionally happens, mortals find it hard to accept the loss of someone close to them.",
      "Even when their loved one is murdered they still protest it was wrongful, they will not accept that it was that person's fate.",
      "They hope to bargain for them.\"",
      "\"And you coldly send them on their way.\"",
      "She replied bitterly.",
      "\"If I felt sympathy for every mortal who passed through here I would have been driven insane by now.",
      "It's not my job to feel sympathy for these people, I only rule the Underworld - I have nothing to do with the deaths of these people.",
      "That's the responsibility of another God.\"",
      "He waited for a cutting reply and when he never received one he continued.",
      "\"Why do want to know about these mortals?\"",
      "He had an idea of what she was getting at; of course he wouldn't let her know he was suspicious.",
      "\"How do they get here?",
      "You made a crack in the earth to bring me here,\" as she spoke her cheeks reddened and her eyes blazed with anger.",
      "Hades knew he'd have to be careful of how he spoke in the next few minutes.",
      "\"There are various entrances that are...easy for mortals to gain access too.",
      "They're hidden so as not to make it too easy.",
      "I don't want just anyone wandering down here, only those who are truly determined to find me or my...helpers,\" he wasn't sure he should mention to her about those who sold their souls to him.",
      "\"The more determined they are the more likely they are to find one of these entrances.",
      "Why do you ask?\"",
      "\"I was just curious.\"",
      "She said quietly as if lost in thought, Hades bit back a smirk and took a sip of wine from his goblet.",
      "He'd known from the moment he took her she would attempt an escape, he'd constantly been alert.",
      "He needed to be there when she tried to break free.",
      "\"Will you excuse me?\"",
      "She murmured rising from the table, Hades simply nodded not mentioning that she never asked him to excuse her.",
      "She normally just stormed from the room.",
      "He gave her a few minutes head start while he finished his wine, as he rose from the table he ordered the nymphs to keep out of Persephone's way.",
      "They didn't speak to the young goddess, it was almost as if they were mute - they rarely spoke to anyone.",
      "He made sure to keep close to her but not so close that she would grow suspicious; using his powers he subtly guided her to the nearest mortal entrance/exit.",
      "Light flooded the Underworld; it was clearly sunlight from the golden glow it threw on the stone floors and walls.",
      "He felt his heart twist at the way the young goddess picked up speed, almost breaking out into a run.",
      "Although his heart was twisting it didn't stop him from what he did next, concentrating he threw up his arms creating an invisible barrier exactly where the Underworld and Mortal world met.",
      "Her sobs tore at him, for the first time in centuries Hades felt guilt, he loathed himself for doing this to the woman he loved.",
      "If only she would just accept this!",
      "He stayed back for a few more minutes, he hated himself for doing so but she had to remain unaware that he was there, that he was the reason she couldn't cross the threshold.",
      "\"Persephone?\"",
      "He called her name softly and stepped out from the shadows; he took her gently in his arms and cradled her lovingly.",
      "\"Ssh,\" he whispered, \"what's wrong?",
      "What are you doing here?\"",
      "\"As if you don't know.\"",
      "She sobbed bitterly making no effort to free herself from the circle of his arms.",
      "\"You were trying to escape.\"",
      "Hades sighed gently leading her away from the exit and towards his throne room.",
      "He waved for a nymph to bring him a blanket, she wasn't exactly cold but she was trembling uncontrollably.",
      "\"Here, sit down.\"",
      "As he wrapped the blanket snugly around her shoulders he sat her carefully in his throne.",
      "She looked miniscule in it, almost child-like.",
      "\"Persephone...\" he started but cut himself off, he wasn't sure what to say.",
      "\"I need a bride, Aphrodite would tell you as much - its her duty to bring people together after all.",
      "If you spoke to her she'd make you see reason.\"",
      "Of course he wouldn't let anyone know of Persephone's whereabouts until after the wedding, he just hoped he could get her to see reason by mentioning Aphrodite, a goddess who had everything to do with love.",
      "\"Why me?",
      "I don't belong here!\"",
      "\"Who does?",
      "Do you really think I enjoy my work?",
      "I'm bound to the Underworld, just as you would be.\"",
      "\"You can leave.\"",
      "Persephone pointed out coldly.",
      "She had him there, sighing he smoothed her hair, caressing her cheek as his fingers trailed down to her face.",
      "\"You need to accept this.",
      "The wedding will happen.",
      "No one is going to come in and save you; no one knows where you are.",
      "They know you're missing, but as for your location...you've just vanished.\"",
      "He shrugged; he'd never had to comfort anyone before needless to say he wasn't exactly the best person to turn to.",
      "\"Perhaps it would be better to accept this now, rather than drag it out.",
      "Embrace your fate.\"",
      "By now she was no longer looking at him, her eyes were fixed on the floor in front of her.",
      "Slowly Hades reached out and tilted her chin up with his index and middle finger, forcing her to look at him.",
      "Gently he stood up taking hold of her hands and pulling her up with him.",
      "This time he didn't hold back, he lowered his face to hers and kissed her fully on the mouth.",
      "He started slowly at first, teasing her lips with the lightest of touches.",
      "His tongue darting in and out caressing hers.",
      "He could tell she was hesitating, he could almost see the battle ranging in her mind.",
      "He took advantage of that hesitance and deepened the kiss, his hands ensnaring her, pinning her arms to her sides beneath the blanket.",
      "Inwardly he was grinning, he could tell she was hesitating - there was a battle screaming in her mind, yet she put up no resistance.",
      "He was winning, he had her.",
      "Persephone woke up on the day of the wedding with a heavy heart, she wasn't even sure if it was morning.",
      "The Underworld had no concept of time, day and night were the same; indistinguishable.",
      "Hades hadn't made another move on her since the kiss only a few days ago, but she knew he'd won.",
      "He was right; no one would come for her.",
      "She was trapped.",
      "She'd just have to hope that she could gain some freedom from this awful marriage.",
      "A soft tapping at her door resulted in her pulling the duvet over her head and burrowing deeper into the bedding.",
      "She knew that wouldn't stop the nymphs coming in though, they answered to Hades only and he'd ordered them to go in her room even if she refused them.",
      "Soon enough the sound of running water could be heard and the duvet was tugged away and she was pulled to her feet.",
      "She knew that in the rooms next door Hades would be getting the same treatment from the nymphs, but she guessed that his attitude was a more upbeat one.",
      "I wonder if I could just drown myself, maybe gods do die but none have ever tried it.",
      "She sank under the water knowing it was hopeless; even if she did die she'd end up here anyway.",
      "For her there was no escaping Hades.",
      "The nymphs tugged her back to the surface and resumed washing her hair with special oils, she caught a whiff of rose scent and tears stung her eyes.",
      "It felt like it'd been months, years even, since she'd smelt a real rose or any type of flower for that matter but she knew she'd been here for only a week.",
      "The next few hours passed in a blur, she was seated in a chair where her hair and make-up was done, she wasn't sure how long the make-up took but knew it took longer than normal due to the fact tears constantly streamed down her face.",
      "All too soon she was ushered from the room and following nymphs through the Underworld.",
      "She knew better than to ask where the wedding was to be held, the nymphs never spoke.",
      "As she walked the fine silk of the dress whispered against her legs, it was beautiful - perhaps if she was marrying someone she loved she'd admire it more.",
      "The top half of the dress was made in a toga-like fashion, with one shoulder covered and remaining shoulder left bare, it hugged her figure showing off her slender curves.",
      "The dress touched the floor; a slit on the right side ran up to her thigh showing slender legs beneath the fabric.",
      "Diamonds twinkling like stars adorned her hair, ears and neck; a cluster adorned the bust of her dress drawing attention to her breasts.",
      "\"You look beautiful,\" a cool voice snapped her from her thoughts and Persephone looked up to see Hades leaning against a stone wall, his eyes taking in every detail of her appearance.",
      "She shifted uncomfortably as his eyes slowly strolled over every inch of her body, she didn't even need to look at his face to tell what he was picturing.",
      "\"Don't scowl like that,\" he smirked walking towards her as the nymphs shifted aside so he could pass through.",
      "He lowered his face down to hers and for a split second Persephone thought he would kiss her, he'd not made another move to do so since their kiss a few nights ago.",
      "Instead he pressed his nose close to her hair and took a deep breath; even if she had wanted to she couldn't have repressed the shudder that shook her body.",
      "\"May I ask who is wedding us?\"",
      "She asked trying to keep her mind clear, to keep calm.",
      "\"A temple priest.\"",
      "Persephone arched her eyebrow at this, which priest?",
      "Who would be insane enough to wed the two?",
      "Unless Hades had spun them a lie...",
      "\"Come, let's not waste anymore time.\"",
      "He bowed and kissed her cheek, resting a hand on her waist he led her into great stone room.",
      "It was almost empty, a scattering of nymphs and minions were gathered to one side, at the front of the room just in front of a stone alter covered with a black silk cloth stood an old man.",
      "He was draped in black robes, he was old and greying, his face was weathered and worn, and his eyes a steel grey looked tired and anxious.",
      "He doesn't want to do this, Persephone realised as they stopped a few feet in front of him.",
      "He bowed to them both deeply, his bow to Hades was considerably deeper and Persephone guessed that he was a priest at one of Hades' temples.",
      "\"What did you tell this man?\"",
      "She asked Hades coldly, \"I can tell he doesn't want to marry us anymore than I want to marry you!\"",
      "\"He is my priest, he must obey me.\"",
      "He never set eyes on her as he spoke; his eyes were focused intently on the priest as if daring him to speak.",
      "\"It is my pleasure to marry you both, and an honour to meet a goddess such as yourself.",
      "Your beauty is a great rival to Aphrodite herself.\"",
      "Persephone bit back a grin as she faced the man.",
      "\"I wouldn't let her hear you say that, she'll get jealous.\"",
      "She wasn't worried about him being struck down here though, no god could hear what was said in the Underworld, nor could they spy on the goings on there.",
      "It was something to do with the power; it rivalled Olympus's own power.",
      "\"But I can tell you don't want to marry us, why?\"",
      "She heard Hades givbe a slight cough.",
      "\"What did you tell him?\"",
      "\"The truth.",
      "That I've claimed you as mine brought you to my domain so you will be my co-ruler.\"",
      "Persephone was stunned; she'd not expected him to say the truth so...casually!",
      "\"It's true Goddess; my Lord Hades has no need to lie to a lowly servant such as myself.",
      "I must do as he commands.\"",
      "Persephone frowned, she knew priests were honour bound to their Gods or Goddesses, but if it would conflict with another...they had ways of objecting.",
      "This marriage would surely anger her father!",
      "She had been kidnapped and was forced to marry a man she didn't love, to rule a world that was against her very being.",
      "\"But -\" \"Persephone.\"",
      "Hades said sharply glaring at her, she flinched and for the first time she felt truly terrified.",
      "Now she got the impression that defying him was not the best of ideas.",
      "\"Please forgive my bride, she is just nervous.",
      "May we please begin?\" Persephone could see the priest was still hesitating.",
      "You're not getting out of this, a small voice in her mind told her.",
      "This is real.",
      "There's no one coming to save you, but you cannot drag this man down with you.",
      "She blinked away tears and forced a smile as she looked at the priest.",
      "\"May I?\"",
      "She asked him quietly holding out her hand for his, the priest looked at her nervously but gave her his hand.",
      "Closing her eyes Persephone took a deep breath, she pictured her thoughts as currents, her body a river.",
      "The thoughts trailed through her mind and out her fingertips leaving her mind empty.",
      "She focused now on only happy thoughts, the smell of summer - berries, wildflowers, the scent of an oncoming storm.",
      "Everything that made her, her.",
      "When she opened her eyes she let go of the priests hand and smiled faintly.",
      "A miniature rose, no bigger than her little finger, lay in the centre of his palm.",
      "The petals in full bloom were a pale pink and emitted a faint golden sparkle.",
      "\"Goddess this is a beautiful gift -\" \"Its my favour,\" Persephone explained to him glancing at Hades from the corner of her eye to study his reaction.",
      "She could see he was impressed.",
      "\"Now if a God or Goddess questions you about this you can show them that you performed this ceremony with my blessing.\"",

      "\"I don't want to marry you.\"",
      "She said sharply unable to look at him, \"but this man shouldn't be held responsible and punished for your cruelty.",
      "Please...may we just do this?\"",
      "*** Hades swept Persephone off her feet as soon as they stepped outside; he carried her bridal style to his bedchambers not caring if he was practically running.",
      "Persephone didn't protest, she couldn't speak.",
      "Tears stung her eyes and fear gripped her immortal heart.",
      "All too soon he was gracefully laying her on the bed, his lips pressed against hers, his body heavy on top of hers.",
      "\"Do we have to do this now?\"",
      "She pleaded in a whispery voice as his hands all but tore the dress off her.",
      "\"Our marriage is only official if we consummate it now,\" he whispered trailing kisses from her lips to hear ears.",
      "\"I promise you I'll be gentle,\" Persephone flinched.",
      "Her mother had kept her shut away in forests for just this reason - she wanted her daughter to remain pure, an innocent maiden.",
      "She knew about sex, Aphrodite had schooled the young goddess in it when she had reached her 'teens'.",
      "She knew that it would most likely hurt for the first time, but Hades words just heightened her fear.",
      "\"Ssh,\" he smoothed her hair from her face as he lay atop of her now fully naked.",
      "For the first time Persephone let herself study Hades' appearance.",
      "She had noticed he had a handsome face, tanned with deep dark eyes that you could just lose yourself in.",
      "His hair looked soft and luxurious, like velvet, she refused to let her hands roam through his hair - she didn't want him to think she was enjoying this.",
      "She would not accept this fate.",
      "Her eyes trailed down, taking in the muscular arms which circled her body, the heavily muscled chest and toned stomach inches above her own smooth, flat stomach.",
      "Finally her eyes rested on his manhood, her cheeks burned crimson and she let out a small cry.",
      "She closed her eyes and turned her head, she could feel his hands rubbing her stomach, massaging her shoulders and breasts.",
      "His movements distracted her from the swell below his abdomen.",
      "They were moving in rhythm together, thighs grinding together slowly at first but gradually picking up speed.",
      "Persephone could feel her breath quickening, she held onto his shoulders and as he slowly entered her she let out a small gasp.",
      "He whispered in her ear, kissed her gently and held onto her.",
      "Persephone lay in his arms after, he was still whispering in her ear; empty promises and meaningless words.",
      "Tears trickled down her cheeks and she turned her back to him.",
      "He'd won.",
      "She was now his wife and bound to the Underworld.",
      "She'd given herself to him willingly, or as good as.",
      "She'd not fought him - she'd almost enjoyed it, she'd been attracted to him!",
      "Squeezing her eyes tightly shut she pulled the black silk duvet up to her shoulders tightly and tried to sleep.",
      "But sleep would not welcome her.",
      "Tears trickled down her cheeks as she listened to Hades murmuring softly and eventually snoring softly, a hand still resting on her stomach, caressing it lovingly even in his sleep.",
      "Hades was awake earlier than usual the next morning, Persephone still in his arms.",
      "Her skin felt soft against his own.",
      "He began tracing patterns lightly on her stomach with his fingertips, she stirred under the movement and Hades silently cursed himself.",
      "He knew she'd not have gotten much sleep last night, how long had she lain awake while he slept peacefully with his beloved in his arms?",
      "\"Forgive me my queen,\" he whispered into her ear, \"I did not mean to wake you.\"",
      "\"Please don't call me that.\"",
      "She begged him shrinking away from his touch only to find her back pressed close to his chest as she moved.",
      "Hades sighed and sat up gently pulling her with him, she quickly rearranged the duvet to keep herself covered from the shoulders down.",
      "\"Why not?",
      "You are my Queen.",
      "Like it or not you're now Queen of the Underworld.\"",
      "He gently wiped a tear from her cheek and kissed her softly.",
      "\"Can I please go back to my own rooms now?",
      "I'm tired.\"",
      "She pleaded with him; he could see she was exhausted.",
      "Her pale skin was almost grey from exhaustion, her sapphire eyes were hidden beneath heavy lidded eyelids and covered by bags, her once rose coloured lips were now almost the same shade of her skin.",
      "\"No.\"",
      "He shook his head after the barest of hesitance.",
      "\"You're my wife, these are your rooms now.",
      "You share my bed with me, every night without fail.\"",
      "\"You can't force me to -\" \"I can.\"",

      "However I don't want to take you that way, if you don't wish to join with me then fine.",
      "But you shall sleep in these rooms from now on.\"",
      "His tone had started as harsh, but as he continued to speak it grew gentle.",
      "\"I would never take you by force, rest assured.\"",
      "Softly he lowered his head to her lips and kissed her tenderly.",
      "\"If you wish to sleep you may do so, I shall leave you in peace.\"",
      "As he stood up to dress he could see Persephone lie back down with the duvet tightly pulled over her head.",
      "He watched as the duvet trembled, his heart twisting as he realised she was quietly sobbing.",
      "He closed the door quietly behind him and was instantly swarmed by his minions.",
      "\"Can I not have five minutes of peace before you all start pestering me?\"",
      "He shouted hurling fire at the nearest minion to show his anger.",
      "\"My lord forgive us, we thought you would want to know of this straight away.\"",
      "A small minion squeaked.",
      "\"Know what?\" Hades bellowed as he followed them to the entrance of the Underworld, the entrance that departed souls from the Mortal world were destined to use.",
      "All too soon he saw the problem.",
      "Usually the souls came in at a steady trickle, like a river leisurely running over rocks to join a stream.",
      "Very rarely did they push through as they were now, like rapids tumbling towards a waterfall.",
      "\"It's Demeter,\" the minion continued, \"she's neglected her duties - ever since she realised her daughter was missing she's done nought but search for her.",
      "The crops have gone bad; the harvests have failed - all over Greece people are beginning to starve to death.",
      "They grow ill from malnutrition.\"",
      "Hades rubbed his forehead wearily; he should have guessed this would happen.",
      "He would have to reveal the whereabouts of his queen now; they couldn't take her from him.",
      "Still he'd have to endure lectures, and most likely constant nagging from Demeter.",
      "\"Leave me.",
      "I will deal with this.\"",
      "He ordered the minions; of course there was nothing he could do now to stop the flow of incoming souls.",
      "He'd have to talk to Zeus to get the woman back to her work; Hades did not want to endure overtime because Demeter was getting sentimental!",
      "She'd had centuries to enjoy the girls company and she'd not bothered, Hades would not neglect his wife as Demeter had her daughter.",
      "\"Persephone?\"",
      "He opened the door to their bedroom and saw she was still in bed, walking closer to her he saw she'd finally fallen into a deep sleep.",
      "He bent down and kissed her cheek softly thankful she didn't even stir.",
      "He didn't want to explain to her what was happening; he didn't think it'd help their situation.",
      "*",
      "** Olympus was hotter than he liked.",
      "He was so used to the cool temperatures of the Underworld that the sun was much too like a sauna for him.",
      "\"Zeus!\"",
      "He called striding into the Great Hall where most of the gods and goddesses just to laze about during their spare time.",
      "He was surprised to see the Great Hall so empty, only Hera and Zeus were there.\"Where",
      "is everyone?\"",
      "He asked not even trying to mask his surprise.",
      "\"Out looking for young Persephone.\"",
      "Hera replied sadly.",
      "\"Ah.\"",
      "\"Ah?\"",
      "Hera looked up at him sharply and saw the sheepish look on his face.",
      "\"Hades do you know anything of her whereabouts?",
      "Kidnapping a goddess is a serious crime!",
      "We must find the mortal or the being who has her.\"",
      "\"Now Hera e don't even know she's been kidnapped, she's young.",
      "She's a going through a bit of a rebellion stage; you know she doesn't like to be cooped up as Demeter does to her.\"",
      "\"Hades, do you know of her whereabouts?\"",
      "Hera asked as if she'd not even heard Zeus.",
      "She tossed her golden hair away from her eyes and scrutinised him intently.",
      "Hades bowed and sighed.",
      "\"Persephone is in the Underworld, as my Queen.\"",
      "He couldn't help grinning, he didn't have to tell them it was kidnap, and how she'd cried herself into a fitful sleep on their wedding night.",
      "He could spin them anything; they'd not go down there to check.",
      "\"Queen?\" Zeus asked and grinned.",
      "\"That's fabulous Hades!\"",
      "He jumped from the throne and shook his hand.",
      "\"A fine match for the girl!",
      "I was worried about who she'd choose to marry, but you a fine God!",
      "Outstanding!\"",
      "Hades pretended to care what Zeus thought - it was hard to take 'outstanding' as a compliment from the god who sat around all day lazing in the sun.",
      "Hades was the only one who did any real work!",
      "Well...maybe Apollo and Poseidon too, but they were rarities, mostly gods just meddled in mortal affairs.",
      "\"We should tell Demeter at once,\" Hera said smiling faintly, \"she will want to know that her daughter is safe and well.\"",
      "Not one of them asked what happened, as Olympus began to fill up all anyone could do was congratulate him.",
      "The few who asked why she'd not come with him to Olympus were easily thrown off by a lie.",
      "\"She's resting; she wants to adjust to her new home before she faces everyone.\"",
      "He told a god for what felt like the thousandth time.",
      "\"Zeus, Hera, brothers and sisters, I'm afraid I must bid you farewell.\"",
      "He turned and bowed to them all.",
      "\"My young wife must be worried sick about me.",
      "Please tell Demeter to stop worrying, once Persephone is settled she will see her.",
      "But right now she's not making any of our lives easier by neglecting her own duties.\"",
      "Draining the rest of his champagne he returned to the Underworld.",
      "All he could do now was wait, he doubted he would be left in peace with Persephone.",
      "He expected some protest from Demeter - but hopefully by then he'd have Persephone wrapped around his little finger.",
      "Persephone was sat in Hades' throne room, she felt drained and exhausted.",
      "Her black dress did nothing to lighten her mood, all her clothes were black.",
      "She was kneeling on the floor, a scroll in one hand, her eyes weren't moving as she couldn't concentrate on the words.",
      "All she could think about was home, the warm forests of Greece with their fresh scents and beautiful wildlife.",
      "Footsteps echoing down the halls made her look up and she was greeted by the sight of Hades walking into the throne room looking unusually happy with himself.",
      "\"You're up!\"",
      "He grinned sweeping her off the floor and planting kisses on her forehead, nose, cheeks and lips.",
      "Persephone was too tired to fight him off, she endured the kisses with gritted teeth, trying her best to not clench her hands so she'd not destroy the scroll in her hands.",
      "\"Where did you go?\"",
      "She asked as he released her and took his seat on his throne.",
      "\"Olympus.\"",
      "\"Without me!?\" Persephone cried angrily, \"why didn't you take me!",
      "You told me I'd be bound to the Underworld once I married you, surely that means I can go to Olympus and visit the mortal world!\"",
      "Hades shook his head.",
      "\"Why?\"",
      "\"I want you to be happy first, I don't want you running to your mother.",
      "You're married to me, there's no getting out of that.",
      "But I want a wife who is here with me.",
      "Not one who I never see because she hides herself either in the mortal world or Olympus!",
      "When you're happy then of course I'll let you visit your mother.\"",
      "\"Hades I...\" Persephone trailed off and shook her head, \"never mind.\"",
      "She sighed.",
      "\"No, what?\" Hades concern was genuine; he reached out to squeeze catch her hand and squeeze it comfortingly but stopped himself.",
      "His touch never did seem to comfort her; in fact it seemed to worsen whatever mood she tended to be in at that time.",
      "This was the first time he'd seen her look this way, truly defeated and distraught.",
      "\"Persephone, please tell me what's wrong.\"",
      "\"I - I don't love you, I don't even like you.",
      "I'm sorry but I don't, I won't ever be happy.",
      "How can I be?",
      "You kidnapped me and forced me to marry you.\"",
      "Tears were in her eyes, but like all the other times he'd seen these tears she blinked them away rapidly determined not to let him see her cry.",
      "Hades could feel his shoulders slumping and he rested his elbows on his knees as he looked up at her.",
      "\"I'm sorry you feel that way.",
      "But you're not the only woman who's ever been forced into wedlock, all over Greece, all over the world people are forced into marriage.",
      "Whether by their fathers to benefit them financially, or their lovers just because they can.",
      "Just for the power.",
      "Persephone, I genuinely love you.",
      "I'm sorry for how I've treated you, how I've acted but...\" He shook his head and decided to try another angle.",
      "\"Do you really think you'd have been free to choose?",
      "Your mother would have kept you away from all men; your father Zeus would have wanted you to marry a great God.",
      "Do you know how happy he is that you're married to him?",
      "Do you know how relieved he is?\"",
      "\"Would he be relieved if he saw me like this?\"",
      "\"Yes.\"",
      "Hades said sharply, \"you're married to an 'outstanding god' his own words.\"",

      "\"How many fathers do you think care about the happiness of their daughters?\"",
      "\"All of them!\"",
      "Hades shook his head sadly amazed at her ignorance.",
      "\"Hardly any, not in this day and age.",
      "All they care about is their daughter making a good marriage, not bringing shame upon their family.",
      "You may be a goddess, but you know yourself you're a lesser one.",
      "Marriage to me makes you more known, when word spreads in the mortal world how do you think they'll react?",
      "They'll see you as the warmth to my coldness, the forgiveness to my judgement.\"",
      "Persephone bit her lip, she could see what he meant but she still didn't want anything to do with this world.",
      "\"What you want doesn't matter, not in the higher scale of things.\"",
      "Hades told her comfortingly as if reading her mind.",
      "He sat her on the throne and knelt on the highest stair leading to it so he was kneeling before her.",
      "\"What do you expect me to do?",
      "Smile and pretend I'm in love with you?",
      "That I'm devoted to you?\"",
      "\"I should,\" Hades said firmly, \"but I want you to be happy, I just want you to give it time.",
      "You can't tell me you're not at least a little bit attracted to me.",
      "I saw it in your eyes last night, and you didn't protest - you wanted to have sex with me.\"",
      "\"I never -\" Persephone began to protest horrified.",
      "\"I saw it in your eyes; you didn't protest or put up a fight.",
      "And when you weren't fighting with yourself I could see you were enjoying it.",
      "Why be ashamed?\"",
      "He pressed her, \"we're married there's nothing wrong with it.",
      "Why shouldn't you be attracted to me?",
      "Why not has sex with me?\" Persephone had no argument for that, she could feel her cheeks burning with embarrassment.",

      "\"Come on, let's get something to eat.\"",
      "\"No.\"",
      "She said shaking her head, \"I'm sorry...I'll try to settle in but I will not eat.\"",

      "In the meantime Hades was spending more and more time sorting through the dead, making sure no one attempted an escape and generally keeping order in the Underworld.",
      "Some ghosts were extremely feisty; they refused to believe they were dead making it all the more worse for everyone.",
      "He barely saw Persephone, although in a way he found this a blessing.",
      "He'd not told her of what was going on; she just assumed he was giving her space to think things over.",
      "It didn't occur to her that he had too much work to do.",
      "Although that had been far from his intentions it was working, she was gradually warming up to him, they'd not shared anything more than kisses but she willingly climbed into bed with him at night and curled up beside him.",
      "That had to be a start.",
      "However she still refused to eat, a thought that secretly made him feel ill.",
      "If Demeter got her way and Persephone was returned to her, Hades knew he'd lose her forever.",

      "A feeling of deja vu swept through her and she thought of a day when she had sat just like this.",
      "In a setting exactly like this.",
      "The only difference was that the sun was fake, if she looked up there was no brilliant blue sky or golden sun beating down its rays.",
      "There was a blue tint and golden light - but the eyes of a goddess were not to be fooled, Hades had tried his best to recreate the world above but he had little experience of the sun.",
      "To him it was distant memory, so distant that beyond the blue tint she could make out the cavernous stone ceiling of the Underworld.",
      "He had promised her that once she was a true Queen of the Underworld then she could perfect it...but she still wasn't sure.",
      "Could she really accept a life here?",
      "She'd spoken to Hades about it several times, and he had admitted one small detail that changed everything.",
      "She'd never be allowed to leave.",
      "She'd be bound permanently to the Underworld.",
      "On the ground beside her lay a pomegranate, its smooth surface looked tender and deliciously inviting.",
      "After starving herself for so long Persephone was close to conceding defeat.",
      "Her mother clearly didn't care - no one had been to search for her!",
      "Surely if they had looked all over Earth they'd have realised that she had to be here.",
      "So that left only one option - no one cared.",
      "Yet Hades did...",
      "\"May I?\" Persephone looked up startled to see Hades standing over her; she nodded and turned to look back into the watery depths of the river.",
      "She felt grass blades tickle her palm as they were disturbed by Hades movement.",
      "When she turned to look back at him she found him staring intently into her eyes.",
      "Slowly he picked up the pomegranate and bit into it, the fruit was so tender the juices dribbled down his chin but he ignored it and continued staring.",
      "Slowly leant over and pressed his lips to Persephone.",
      "\"It would be easy Persephone.\"",
      "He whispered softly, \"it could end now...\" It dawned on her what he meant, she could feel his tongue creeping over her lips, trying to ease them apart and slide a seed into her mouth.",
      "\"No.\"",
      "She withdrew slowly and shook her head licking her lips.",
      "They tasted sweet and she looked at the fruit in his hand longingly.",
      "She was hungry - she didn't have to eat but she enjoyed it.",
      "The textures and different tastes of all the food...she missed experiencing though.",
      "\"Not like this.",
      "Not now.\"",
      "\"When?\"",
      "\"I don't know.\"",
      "She answered after a long silence.",
      "She watched as Hades bit into the pomegranate once more, her lips parted slightly as she looked at it hungrily.",
      "\"Why can you eat pomegranate seeds and yet not be bound to this place?\"",
      "\"I am bound to this place but by duties.\"",
      "Hades shrugged and looked at Persephone.",
      "His lips glistened with the juices from the fruit and he saw the look of her hunger in her eyes.",
      "Leaning over he pressed his lips to hers, kissing her in a slow yet passionate way.",
      "He tossed the pomegranate aside and pulled her towards him.",
      "Persephone put up no resistance, even as he lowered her onto the ground and began slowly undressing her.",
      "Persephone felt her eyes flutter shut; the sun beat down on Hades back making him warm to the touch, for a moment the atmosphere changed.",
      "The air felt real, the smells smelt real.",
      "With her eyes closed it almost felt like she was back on earth.",
      "A cry of ecstasy passed her lips and she felt her nails digging into Hades's back.",
      "\"It could be like this,\" Hades whispered into her ear his body weight pressing against her.",
      "\"Why fight it?\"",
      "\"I don't want to fight it.\"",
      "Persephone gasped as ripples of ecstasy shot through her body making her jolt as if shocked with each ripple.",
      "Her lips found His and she pressed her body as close to him as physically possible.",
      "When she fell back her chest was rising and falling in wild motions.",
      "She looked around and blushed - what had they just done?",
      "She sat up and grabbed her dress which had been thrown off in the passion; she held it close to cover herself up.",
      "\"Persephone - there's no one around.\"",
      "Hades reminded her sitting up and kissing her neck.",
      "He held out his hand and a pomegranate appeared.",
      "Persephone took it wordlessly and raised it to her lips.",
      "It felt smooth as it connected with her lips, her tongue rolling along the smooth curved surface.",
      "She had almost taken a bite when her eyes looked up at the sky.",
      "\"No.\"",
      "She said quietly throwing the fruit into the water.",
      "\"I'm sorry but I can't bind myself permanently - I don't belong here Hades.\"",
      "\"Excuse me, my Lord?\" Persephone gasped as a voice rang through the ear and she quickly covered herself up more securely with the dress.",
      "Looking up she saw a grey nymph with long white hair and clothed fully in black staring with a lost expression at Hades.",
      "\"Hermes is hear to see you - he says it is urgent.\"",
      "With a small bow the nymph turned and sloped off.",
      "\"I can't end up like that.\"",
      "Persephone whispered feeling tears prick her eyes.",
      "\"You won't - she's a nymph, a dead one.",
      "She's just a soul - a shadow of her former self.",
      "You'll be alive and healthy.\"",
      "Hades said in a stiff voice, Persephone couldn't help but the notice the glinting panic look in his eyes.",
      "\"I will see you at dinner.",
      "I hope you will join me.\"",
      "Kissing her swiftly on the lips Hades departed leaving Persephone alone with nothing but her thoughts.",
      "How close had she been to eating those seeds?",
      "Was it a sign?",
      "Did she deep down actually want to be bound to this place?",
      "Sighing Persephone quickly dressed herself and thought everything over.",
      "Could she give up earth forever?",
      "Never see her mother again?!",
      "Three weeks to the day had passed since their wedding; Persephone was strolling through the Underworld alone.",
      "Hades now trusted that she at least wouldn't try to break free, she didn't have the energy.",
      "He was right when he'd said her power would return to her a little when she was bound to him through marriage.",
      "Still he'd neglected to tell her that using it would drain her, and that it would be pointless to do so as her powers were useless here.",
      "There was no need to heal, to plant seeds and give them life in the Underworld.",
      "The dead did not need healing, and the plants wouldn't thrive in the Underworld as they did the mortal.",
      "It wasn't fair to give them life in so cold and dark a kingdom.",
      "Still she refused to eat, a month had passed since her abduction and she'd not eaten once - she didn't dare.",
      "She held onto the smallest hope that their marriage could be made void, even though she knew deep down it was impossible.",
      "The three weeks hadn't been that bad, Hades made regular attempts to claim her in his bed but she nearly always resisted.",
      "And much to her surprise he let her be, he was content with a few tender or passionate kisses, she found herself enjoying them sometimes - until she reminded herself of whom he was.",
      "Maybe he's right, she thought biting her lip and picking up a lone pebble from the ground.",
      "Maybe if I accepted this it would all be easier, I'm attracted to him...I can't deny that any longer, he never lets me forget it.",
      "But is really enough to just find someone attractive?",
      "She sighed and tossed the rock as far as she could throw it, she heard it echoing as it bounced along the stone floor.",
      "Turning she decided that perhaps it'd be best to talk to Hades; he seemed to be easy enough to talk to.",
      "Their marriage was problematic, and he was always willing to fix it.",
      "And she was beginning to think that there was something there to fix, could she possibly be falling in love with him?",
      "She would have prayed for an answer but it was worthless for two reasons; here in the Underworld the only person to pray too was Hades.",
      "And secondly...she was a goddess, who was there to answer her prayers?",
      "\"She won't have it Hades.",
      "Zeus has had enough; Demeter won't go back to her work until her daughter is returned to her side!\"",
      "Persephone recognised Hermes voice and her heart froze, she hid around the corner making sure she was out of sight.",
      "What was Hermes doing back here?",
      "Hades had said nothing of his first visit when the nymph had announced him and she'd thought nothing of it - until now.",
      "While Hades was good to talk too she knew he kept things from her, this conversation would be one of those things.",
      "\"His people are dying; he cannot get five minutes to do other work -\" \"You mean he cannot find five minutes alone to sunbathe, to drink ambrosia or guzzle some wine!",
      "He is not the only one working overtime, where do you think the dead go when they die?!",
      "Hawaii?",
      "Look around you Hermes!",
      "Can you not see I know well enough people are dying because of that insane woman?\"",
      "\"Be that as it may, you must return Persephone to her mother.",
      "Zeus will not stand for you keeping her here any longer.\"",
      "\"She is my wife!",
      "You expect me to be parted from my only companion!\"",
      "\"Yes.\"",
      "Persephone flinched at the coldness in Hermes voice - never had she heard him speak in such an emotionless tone.",
      "\"Helios has come forth; he has told us of how you abducted Persephone.",
      "Took her unwillingly into your realm.",
      "Whether or not she married you willing is unknown to us, we've so far been unable to detect the priest who wed you both.\"",
      "\"Give me...give me time.\"",
      "\"No! Persephone must return now.\"",
      "\"I will go and find her then.\"",
      "Persephone felt tears pricking her eyes, never before had she heard Hades sound so defeated.",
      "Quickly she turned and ran; she couldn't let him know she'd overheard what had been said.",
      "I'm going home.",
      "She thought coming to a stop in their bedroom, she sat on the edge of the bed and stared at her hands in shock.",
      "Hermes had come to get her...to set her free!",
      "So why wasn't she happy?",
      "Hadn't she just moments ago been wishing for a way home?",
      "No",
      ".",
      "She realised feeling her heart twist painfully in her chest.",
      "She had been almost praying for an answer to her question; could she really love Hades?",
      "Now she was getting her answer...and she was wishing for the opposite now.",
      "\"Persephone?\" Hades poked his head around the door and smiled in a forced-cheery way as he laid eyes upon her.",
      "\"I have good news...for you.\"",
      "\"Oh?\"",
      "\"Hermes is here...he's come to take you home.\"",
      "Persephone raised her eyes to his and smiled, like his it was forced.",
      "\"Hades -\" \"He can't wait around, he's here to take you now.",
      "He's in the throne room...will you go there now but wait just a moment before you leave?",
      "I - I need to...\" Persephone felt her heart twist once more and tears dropped down her cheeks.",
      "Was this how she had looked to him?",
      "Lost, distant and just...depressed?",
      "She stood up and kissed him softly on the lips.",
      "\"Of course I will wait.\"",
      "She said hugging him lightly, she turned and walked from the room.",
      "She didn't dawdle but neither did she rush to the throne room.",
      "She was torn, if she went home she'd be free from Hades - but she was growing attached to him.",
      "She loved him.",
      "Did she really want their marriage annulled?",
      "\"Persephone!\"",
      "Hermes rushed forward and swept her into a tight embrace.",
      "\"You must be so relieved!",
      "I don't know how you've coped been down here all this time!",
      "I've been here for ten minutes and already I feel like a mortal!\"",
      "Persephone forced a weak smile and shrugged her shoulders as she freed herself from his tight embrace.",
      "\"I - I don't know...I guess it's something you just get used to.\"",
      "She said although now he mentioned it she did feel weak; perhaps it was because soon she knew she'd be able to use her powers again.",
      "She was beginning to feel excitement; all the things she'd missed would once again be within her reach!",
      "But Hades was at the back of her mind tugging at the happiness of the thought of returning home; how could she leave him?",
      "\"Your mother has been beside herself with worry - we've searched everywhere for you!",
      "We came down here, well I did, to see if Hades had known of your whereabouts but he said he didn't.",
      "The amount of mortals who've...\" \"Who've what?\" Persephone said sharply.",
      "She remembered what Hades had told her about the sudden influx of mortal souls entering the Underworld.",
      "He had said it was because gods and goddesses were neglecting their duties - he'd never mentioned her mother.",
      "Would her mother really do that?",
      "\"Persephone you mustn't be angry with Demeter, she was concerned for you - all she could think about was finding you!\"",
      "\"So it's my fault all these people have died?\" Persephone gasped horrified.",
      "\"No!",
      "No",
      "!",
      "Of course not!",
      "None of this is your fault!\"",
      "Hermes tried to soothe Persephone.",
      "\"If Hades had been open and told us the truth instead of stalling none of this would have happened!",
      "But don't worry your mother is going to make sure this doesn't happen again - I doubt she'll let you out of her sight for a minute!\"",
      "Hermes clearly thought this was what Persephone wanted to hear, but it was in fact the complete opposite!",
      "Anger bubbled inside of her stomach, spreading through her veins like wildfire.",
      "Did no one care about what she wanted?!",
      "All she wanted was space!",
      "Some privacy and the choice to go where she please!",
      "She was about to voice this when footsteps sounded and she turned to see Hades walking behind her, his hands held behind his back.",
      "Reaching out with one hand he took her and kissed her on the lips, his tongue urgently pushing her lips apart and darting into her mouth.",
      "As he deepened the kiss Persephone couldn't help but respond, her hands went around his back, she found one of his own still behind him holding something.",
      "Still deep in the kiss her hands searched his hidden one curiously and she broke apart as she touched something moist.",
      "She looked at Hades horrified as she realised what he had done, she could feel them now - pomegranate seeds.",
      "They rested on the back of her tongue, she moved to cough - to spit them out but as she opened her mouth she drew in a breath by accident and three seeds slipped down her throat.",
      "\"How could you?\"",
      "She whispered in horror as he held out the pomegranate he'd been hiding behind his back.",
      "Looking at him closely she could see the tell-tale red stain on his lips and the spots of juice around his mouth from where he'd bitten into the fruit.",
      "\"Persephone!\"",
      "Hades cried out in horror as her knees gave way beneath her, before she hit the ground he swept her into his arms and held her securely.",
      "\"I'm sorry but I can't lose you, I can't let them annul our marriage.\"",
      "He whispered into her ear kissing it softly.",
      "\"She has eaten pomegranate seeds - you know the law Hermes.",
      "She is bound here.\"",
      "Persephone bit back a sob and shoved Hades away, her pity for him had evaporated.",
      "How could he do that!?",
      "\"How many?\" Hermes asked in an emotionless voice and Persephone looked up at him - was this it then?",
      "Was there no hope?",
      "\"Three.\"",
      "Hermes nodded and for a moment was silent.",
      "\"You had best come with me Hades...and bring Persephone.\"",
      "\"She has consumed pomegranate seeds!\"",
      "\"She has had only three.",
      "She is bound here yes, but there is nothing that says she is bound here permanently for she did not consume them all.",
      "Bring her.",
      "Zeus will make the decision of what is to be her fate.\"",
      "And with that Hermes disappeared, leaving husband and wife alone in the bitter cold throne room of the Underworld.",
      "It couldn't have been more than an hour later when Persephone found herself sitting in the gloriously bright golden throne room of Mount Olympus.",
      "Her eyes were dazzled by the colours and brightness; she had forgotten how overwhelming the home of the gods could be.",
      "She closed her eyes and buried her face in her hands, behind her, her mother clucked and ordered people to leave her be and give her some space.",
      "\"Mother please, I'm fine!\"",
      "She insisted fed up already of her mother watching over her constantly.",
      "\"Demeter!",
      "Give the girl some space.\"",
      "A thunderous voice roared making everyone jump to their feet.",
      "Somehow Persephone managed to stand up and curtsey to her father, King of the Gods, Zeus.",
      "\"Persephone.\"",
      "He took her hand and kissed her forehead.",
      "\"What's this I hear about you running away to the Underworld and marrying Hades?\"",
      "He smiled at her and Persephone frowned.",
      "\"I did not run away father, he kidnapped me!\"",
      "She looked around the room trying to locate Hades and found him standing beside a golden pillar looking lost.",
      "Her heart twisted at the sight of him looking so pitiful, so defeated.",
      "But only a little.",
      "She would not forget the misery he put her through, what he had forced her to do.",
      "She looked back at her father and blinked away tears.",
      "\"I made it clear to him I did not want to marry him, I told him all I wanted was to come home!\"",
      "Tears blurred her eyes but she blinked them back, she was standing in a room full of the greatest gods and goddesses and she could tell they would pass judgment not only on this matter but on her.",
      "They were judging whether she was worthy or just some lesser god barely better than a mortal.",
      "She would not cry and let them see her weakness.",
      "\"You see Zeus!",
      "She was forced!",
      "Annul the marriage!\"",
      "\"It's not as simple as that Demeter.",
      "The marriage may have been forced but it was carried out, and knowing Hades - consummated.\"",
      "Persephone blushed but stared at Zeus as the others in the room looked between her and Hades.",
      "She felt violated at the thought that most of them were right now picturing her slender naked body beneath his much heavier muscled one.",
      "\"I want the priest who wed them!",
      "I want him here right now!\"",
      "Demeter shrieked making Persephone flinch.",
      "\"Mother please, calm down - you know that is not possible.",
      "My head feels as if it might explode from being here, a mortals certainly would.\"",
      "She wasn't exaggerating when she said this, her head pounded from the dazzling colours that assaulted her vision.",
      "A human would not be able to look upon this without suffering such a severe headache, their head would literally combust.",
      "The thought made her shudder.",
      "\"Blindfold him then!",
      "It has been done before, I demand it done now!\"",
      "\"Just give her what she wants Zeus, bring the priest.\"",
      "Hades said coldly glaring at Demeter.",
      "\"She will not like what he has to say - his words will only confirm my marriage to Persephone, and then there is the matter of the pomegranate seeds.\"",
      "There was a hushed silence as Hades made this announcement, every eye in the room turned to look at Persephone.",
      "\"You ate?\" Zeus asked horrified.",
      "\"No I -\" Persephone shook her head and looked at Hermes for help.",
      "\"Does it count?\"",
      "\"I'm afraid it does...you did swallow the seeds after all.\"",
      "There was a silence where no one dared look anywhere but at Persephone.",
      "\"You ate food in the Underworld?\" Demeter whispered horrified dropping the hand that had been holding her daughter's shoulder in support.",
      "\"How could you be so foolish?!\"",
      "\"Summon the priest; I will hear what he has to say first although...with this new information Persephone...\" Zeus looked at her sadly and she could guess what was coming.",
      "She would have to go back to the Underworld, but would it be as Hades' wife?",
      "What would the point in going back be if I am not?",
      "She looked at Hades and bit her lip, she had been falling in love with him...but how could he have done this to her?",
      "\"Sit daughter, relax.\"",
      "Easier said than done.",
      "Persephone thought but she obeyed and sat down obediently.",
      "She looked down at her black clothing and shuddered; only she and Hades wore black.",
      "Her mother wore a deep forest green, Poseidon a toga of shimmering green and blue made to imitate his domain the ocean.",
      "Within minutes Hermes returned with two woodland nymphs leading the blindfolded priest who had performed the marriage.",
      "Persephone was suddenly thankful that she had given this man her blessing - for although it would condemn her it would at least protect him.",
      "She looked down at the floor torn between blocking out the questioning and listening, she didn't want to hear her fate - but she couldn't run from it.",
      "Not now.",
      "Zeus questioned the priest vigorously; as did Demeter who got a little too carried away sending the poor mortal into a frenzied panic.",
      "\"Mother!",
      "Leave him be!\"",
      "Persephone cried jumping to her feet.",
      "\"This was Hades doing - the man is a priest at one of his own temples, of course he had to obey what his God said!\"",
      "\"The goddess Persephone is indeed a great lady,\" the priest stammered.",
      "\"She saw the predicament I was in even then, she gave me her favour.\"",
      "Persephone flinched as the priest held out his hand sending the familiar smell of berries and a summer night's storm.",
      "A golden rose glimmered above the priest's hand and began to fade until it had disappeared once more, taking the scent of summer with it.",
      "\"Very well...you may take the priest back.\"",
      "Zeus dismissed the nymphs and they led the still blindfolded priest from Olympus back to earth.",
      "Persephone met her father's gaze squarely as he looked down at her.",
      "\"You claimed this marriage was forced...yet you gave the priest your blessing, and you consumed food?",
      "Not just any food but the seeds of a pomegranate!\"",
      "Persephone bit her lip; she desperately wanted to protest but could see how childish her argument would appear. 'Hades made me do it'?",
      "Although true she didn't think it would go down too well.",
      "\"I wanted none of this father, please do not send me back there - I cannot possibly spend an eternity in the Underworld.",
      "It may not kill me but...I think I would rather die.\"",
      "She couldn't look at Hades when she spoke.",
      "\"Do you love him?\" \"What?\"",
      "The question caught her off-guard that she wasn't sure who Zeus referred too.",
      "\"Hades.\"",
      "Her father said impatiently.",
      "\"Do you love him?\" Persephone bit her lip in thought, which was clearly answer enough for him.",
      "\"If you have to think about your answer then you must feel something for him.",
      "Persephone I'm sorry but I have no choice, you must return to the Underworld.",
      "Your marriage is legal and you are now bound there.",
      "However,\" Persephone looked up in hope as she heard that one word.",
      "\"As you only ate three seeds I am willing to compromise...you will spend half the year with your mother, you can spend the summer months with her.",
      "But as soon as the first leaf falls you must return to the Underworld where you will stay until the first bloom.\"",
      "\"NO!\"",
      "Demeter cried in anguish.",
      "\"She cannot return!\"",
      "\"It is law Demeter; your daughter is not exempt because of her status.\"",
      "Hades growled an ugly expression etched onto his normally handsome features.",
      "Persephone was glad that at least she would not have to return with him today - a fight would surely ensue.",
      "\"My word is final Demeter - be thankful she only ate three, any more and she could have been bound there permanently.\"",
      "With an angry curse Demeter left the mountain to one of her secluded spots.",
      "Persephone rolled her eyes feeling a wave of anger wash over her, how could her mother be angry when it was she who was being forced back to the Underworld?",
      "\"Does no one care what I think?\"",
      "She asked bitterly standing up.",
      "\"For a month I have been forced to do what someone else wants me to do, and now you're deciding where I shall spend my time?",
      "What about what I want?\"",
      "\"What you want is irrelevant my dear.\"",
      "Zeus said looking exhausted and Persephone came to realise her father had known her whereabouts for quite some time.",
      "\"I have made my decision and it is final.\"",
      "She looked over at Hades who looked a little pleased with himself, some of his smug arrogance was beginning to creep back into his personality.",
      "He had gotten what he wanted - partly, but she could tell he was pleased at not having lost her completely.",
      "Like it or not she would be going back to his domain.",
      "\"I shall never forgive you for this!\"",
      "She said to him and stormed from Mount Olympus back to her quaint cottage in the woodlands where she cried herself to sleep.",
      "Never before had Persephone both dreaded and anticipated the falling of the first leaf.",
      "The assumption she had, had in the Underworld about her mother becoming overbearing should she ever get free was true.",
      "Her first night back had been her only one alone so far, her mother had not believed that Hades would be content at having his wife beside him during the winter months and had set up escorts for wherever Persephone should go.",
      "She sometimes found herself longing to be back in the Underworld, at least Hades would leave her be - even if he did restrict where she could go sometimes.",
      "But it wasn't just her overbearing mother that made her anticipate her return to the Underworld.",
      "She missed Hades.",
      "As furious as she was with him for what he had done, she found that she did love him.",

      "If she hadn't loved him then surely she'd have been able to say no straight away?",
      "Of course her mother argued that if she did love him she'd have been able to answer yes, but too much had happened for her to allow herself to love Hades completely.",
      "How could you love the man who had kidnapped you and forced you into a marriage?",
      "To live in a world of death when she thrived among the living.",
      "Maybe it wasn't love, but there was certainly something there.",
      "Persephone groaned and pulled the bed cover over her head as her mother banged the door to her small cottage open.",
      "It was rude for gods to just materialise in another's dwelling, but her mother (or any of the others for that matter) didn't seem to comprehend that banging the door down and waltzing in was the same thing.",
      "\"What do you think you are doing here?",
      "You're not safe Persephone!\"",

      "She could say nothing about his activities with nymphs though, who was to say he wasn't taking one, or more, to his bed?",
      "He had six months without her, and while she would live the celibate life she found it hard thinking he would follow the same path.",
      "\"It doesn't matter what he does or does not do.",

      "*",
      "** Persephone had been right in thinking Hades would take another to his bed, he had done so almost every night since her return to the world above.",
      "But he hadn't done it out of spite.",
      "He had enjoyed the companionship.",
      "Unlike the other Gods, namely Zeus, it had been rare for him to find a bed-partner.",
      "Mortals especially were less willing to go to bed with the God of the Underworld.",
      "They never quite grasped that an invitation from Zeus was a death sentence with the jealous Hera constantly smiting them, just look at poor Semele.",
      "He smiled thinking of how she had pleaded with him to let her go back to the Mortal world.",
      "How she would do anything.",
      "His eyes focused on the naked nymph below him, her expressionless face staring blankly up at him.",
      "Sighing he rolled off her and onto his back where he stared up at the stone ceiling of his bedchamber.",

      "He commanded the nymph feeling the anger fire up inside of him.",
      "It was just like he had told Persephone, the nymphs here were mere shadows of their former selves.",
      "They felt nothing.",
      "They were cold, horrifyingly boring and possessed no sex drive.",
      "He was better off lying alone hugging the pillow that was smothered in Persephone's scent than resting beside one of those pitiful creatures.",
      "Rising from the bed he paced around the room not caring about his state of undress, those that served him were by now over the shock of seeing him bare.",
      "He had been restless ever since Persephone had been granted those six months of freedom.",
      "The thought he would have to spend half the year alone once more, without his beloved wife by his side, was torment.",
      "For the first few days he had drunk himself silly on ambrosia, not caring that his work had been neglected.",
      "However Zeus had been quick to pick him up on this, if only he had been as stern with Demeter as he had been with him!",
      "I have to do something for her, something she will love.",
      "He told himself, but what?",
      "He could make glorious meadows for her to visit, but he knew what she would think - nothing would compare to the world above.",

      "But maybe it would be something?",

      "*",
      "** The turning of the first leaf was fast approaching and Hades was becoming more excitable as the days faded past.",
      "He was almost like a mortal child except he remembered to keep his dignity in check, but only just.",
      "He knew that people realising Persephone was his weakness would lead to trouble, he would not allow them to take advantage of him - or endanger Persephone.",
      "He tuned his senses in carefully to the plantlife of the mortal world.",
      "Normally he didn't monitor such things, the death of a plant meant nothing to him - what should he care if a tree was felled?",
      "But now he took a keen interest in their lives, or at least until he had what he wanted.",
      "He smiled as he felt his powers spring out, seeking out death.",
      "Persephone was lounging next to a golden pool on Mount Olympus, the water was pleasantly warm and her right foot was nudging the surface, gently tracing patterns.",
      "She had long since given up on trying to find some privacy within the mortal realm.",
      "Instead she'd spent the best part of the six months on Mount Olympus or accompanying her mother to festivals held in the goddess' honour.",
      "\"Persephone?\"",
      "Guiltily she sat up and quickly placed the ambrosia she'd been about to drink behind her.",
      "It was normal for the gods to drink themselves into a stupor from the golden liquid, but she had always abstained from such behaviour.",
      "\"I'm sorry for disturbing you, especially since I'm not sure whether this news will bring you relief or grief...\" Persephone smiled weakly at Hermes, guessing what he was about to tell her.",
      "\"The leaves are turning aren't they?\" Hermes nodded and she quickly rose to her feet.",
      "\"Does my mother wish to see me?\"",
      "\"Yes...but I should warn you, she's not in the best of moods - she's been to your father several times in petition for you to remain.\"",
      "Persephone closed her eyes to stop herself from rolling them, she should have guessed her mother would not take this well.",
      "\"Zeus has tried consolidating her, reminding that it is only for six months and that Hades could easily petition you to stay down there for longer.\"",
      "\"He what?\" Persephone followed Hermes looking confused.",
      "\"You ate the seeds of a pomegranate.",
      "Technically you never should have left the Underworld, the law states you ate the fruit of the Underworld and you are in fact bound to it.",
      "However Hades was persuaded to release you for six months, Zeus pointed out to him privately the extra work that would be involved in keeping you down there the full year.",
      "Demeter would ignore her duties completely, more people would die - he'd hardly have time to look at you let alone spend time with you.",
      "Your father decided to remind Demeter that by kicking up a fuss about letting you return to the Underworld Hades might feel inclined to push the fact you should never have been allowed to leave.\"",
      "Persephone nodded feeling fear well up inside, would this never go away?",
      "Fear of being under the control of others, never being able to live the life she wanted.",
      "Hermes paused in front of the door to her mother's chambers and looked at her with concern.",
      "\"I appreciate this must be hard for you, Pers.\"",
      "She smiled at the use of his nickname for her, he hadn't used it in so long she'd forgotten the use of it.",
      "\"As impossible as this advice may seem...just don't argue with her.",
      "Nod, smile and agree...just be careful not to commit yourself to a promise you can't keep.",
      "Hopefully she'd have gotten the rant over with by now.\"",
      "Knocking Hermes waited for an answer before opening the door and bowing Persephone through.",
      "\"Good luck.\"",
      "He murmured to her before shutting the door quietly and leaving her alone with her mother.",
      "\"Mother,\" Persephone crossed the room and embraced her mother kissing her on the cheek and kneeling before her.",
      "\"Hermes has told you?\" Never before had she heard her mother sound so cold, it was as if a winter frost had bitten into her skin.",
      "She shivered and withdrew slightly answering with a small nod.",
      "\"How could you have been so foolish Persephone?",
      "You knew not to eat anything from that awful place, and yet you did!",
      "How could you?\" Persephone looked down at the golden tiled floor and said nothing, she blinked back tears.",
      "She'd foolishly hoped the parting would go better than this, that her mother wouldn't be too upset knowing she would be back after six months.",
      "\"All I can do is apologise mother.",
      "I did not do it maliciously, I was miserable down there!",
      "I had not eaten once!",
      "When I heard the news I would be coming home I got excited, it is no excuse but it is the truth.",
      "And I apologise profusely if my foolishness has offended you.\"",
      "Rising to her feet Persephone looked at her mother.",
      "\"Now if you will excuse me, I am sure my husband is waiting for me...I think it unwise to keep him waiting too long.\"",
      "She kissed her mother farewell and turned to leave, Hermes waited outside for her.",
      "\"It could have gone worse I suppose.\"",
      "He smiled reassuringly at her and Persephone nodded.",
      "She would have liked a more touching, less harsh goodbye...but at least her mother did not go off into a rant.",
      "\"Hades is waiting for you at the entrance to the Underworld.",
      "I will escort you there.\"",
      "\"Thank you Hermes.\"",
      "\"Persephone!\"",
      "A small cry of shock escaped Persephone's lips as Hades enveloped her in a bone crushing hug.",
      "For a fleeting second she felt her face press itself into his shoulder and her arms reach up to hug him back.",
      "But as she breathed in his scent she snapped to her senses.",
      "She pushed away and turned to thank Hermes, only to find him gone and the sunlight she had momentarily been standing in had changed into solid rock, sighing she turned back to face Hades.",
      "\"I missed you.\"",
      "He whispered taking her hand and gripping it tightly.",
      "\"Really?",
      "I heard you had company.\"",
      "There had been a few whispered rumours, all meant to be kept away from the young goddess's ears.",
      "Hades face said it all and she shook her head blinking back tears.",
      "\"How could you?",
      "You said you loved me, you forced me down here and then forced me into a marriage with you!",
      "And when I'm granted a glimmer of hope, that I can go home for half the year...you show this love by cheating on me as soon as I am gone?",
      "How can I believe a single word you say to me Hades?",
      "How can I ever trust you?\"",
      "\"It was a mistake.\"",
      "\"Of course.",
      "She fell into bed - she fell into our room no doubt!",
      "And you just happened to stumble on top -\" \"Persephone don't be crass.\"",
      "Hades said sharply.",
      "\"I'm sorry I hurt you but I was grief stricken, I missed you and I wanted you beside me.",
      "It was a foolish moment, and one I can promise you I have not, nor will I ever repeat it.\"",
      "Seeing no point in arguing Persephone merely nodded.",
      "She was too tired to argue, was that how it would be from now on?",
      "Arguing with Hades and her mother when she returned to each world at the end of her time?",
      "\"Come, I've prepared a feast.\"",
      "\"Hades...can I...can I eat here now?\" Persephone stopped him midstep and looked up at him.",
      "\"If I eat am I bound here for eternity?",
      "Or will I still be allowed home for half the year?\" Hades sighed and paused before answering her, cupping her face in one hand he kissed her softly.",
      "\"Hermes told you I could petition you remain here for eternity already, has he not?\" Persephone nodded not sure if she would like where this was going.",
      "\"Yes Persephone you can eat, technically you should be bound here for eternity already however due to a small technicality you have been released from the bond.",
      "This leaves you free to eat, your mother and I both signed a contract that your father created.",
      "It states that while you are down here within the six months you can eat and drink as you please.",
      "You can dedicate yourself to the Underworld wholly without repercussions.",
      "However.\"",
      "Persephone flinched at the tone of his voice.",
      "\"If you eat outside of the time you are meant to be here...then you are bound forever, and nothing your mother or Zeus say or do can change that.",
      "That means if you stay an hour later, or arrive an hour early, and happen to eat something...\" He held up his hands in a helpless gesture and Persephone nodded.",
      "\"Thank you.\"",
      "She said quietly, \"I appreciate you telling me that, I know you could have kept it to yourself and detained me for an hour - just for a quick goodbye dinner.\"",
      "Hades smiled at her and wrapped an arm around her waist.",
      "\"If I am honest the thought crossed my mind...several times.",
      "In fact it has never left it; I thought it best to warn you...just in case I do try.\"",
      "Persephone smiled slightly and allowed him to guide her to the dining room.",
      "She pushed his affair to the back of her mind, she wanted to scream and rage at him but she knew deep down it would do no good.",
      "She was stuck here until the earth came back to life for the spring and summer months.",
      "After dinner Hades gave Persephone no opportunity to decide what to do.",
      "Slipping behind her chair he began kissing the back of her neck, gathering her hair and wrapping it around his hand luxuriously.",
      "\"Come to bed with me?\"",
      "He whispered huskily in her ear.",
      "Persephone bit her lip nervously and stared at the wall ahead until it blurred.",
      "Carefully, her head feeling as if it were made of stone, she nodded.",
      "Gently Hades pulled her up from her seat and gathered her up into his arms.",
      "\"I've missed you.\"",
      "He breathed laying her on the bed; he laid on top of her and kissed her gently.",
      "Persephone surprised herself by responding to the kiss, her hands ran through his hair and down his back.",
      "She slipped his toga from his shoulders unclasping buckles that kept his clothing as a barrier to her.",
      "Her own clothes soon joined his on the floor and within seconds the pair were a tangle of arms and legs, exploring each and every part of each other's bodies.",
      "Persephone bit back a cry as Hades pushed inside her and arched her back trying to bring him closer.",
      "\"Don't.\"",
      "He whispered in her ear.",
      "\"Don't be quiet.\"",
      "That was all the encouragement she needed, cries of ecstasy passed through her lips and she felt Hades pulsing with pleasure as each one burst forth from her.",
      "After what felt like hours Hades collapsed onto his back beside Persephone, one arm resting behind his head the other slipping around her smooth waist pulling her close.",
      "\"I've missed you.\"",
      "He murmured nibbling her earlobe gently, the sensation sent fresh pulses of pleasure coursing through her body and she let out a moan.",
      "\"I've missed you too...\" Persephone said and realised it was true.",
      "She draped a blanket over them both and rested against his broad chest which still heaved from his earlier excursions.",
      "Closing her eyes Persephone allowed herself to drift off to sleep, the most peaceful one since Hades had first taken her.",
      "The months had turned into years, the years into centuries and soon Persephone had begun to settle into her strange routine.",
      "During her six months above the Underworld, Persephone witnessed the change the mortals brought upon the world.",
      "She witnessed the destruction of the old temples and several civilisations; she roamed the globe and witnessed monarchies put to death and new governments established.",
      "The old gods were forgotten and new ones were worshipped in their place.",
      "Yet the Underworld never changed.",
      "She became thankful for the consistency she found in Hades' domain.",
      "While the world above became a world filled of jealousy, weapons and war the Underworld remained quiet although it still depressed her to be down there.",
      "Persephone was sitting on a grassy patch in the middle of a bustling city, the leaves were a rich and vibrant green but there was a definite chill to air.",
      "She leant back and ran a hand through her silky midnight black hair.",
      "She was able to blend with mortals with ease now, no one believed in the Greek gods so who did she have to fear of discovering her identity?",
      "She was dressed in black jeans and a black vest.",
      "She closed her eyes and took in a deep breath, it was no longer as fresh and crisp as it had been in the ties of Ancient Greece.",
      "Now she could taste the fumes of cars, the electric tang from the phone masts which cluttered the once beautiful countryside.",
      "It was strange, over two thousand years ago she would have longed for companionship.",
      "To be closer to mortals, but her mother had forbidden it.",
      "Now she could walk beside a mortal and share a smile, a quick glance, without even a tremor that her mother would find out.",
      "She could be in the heart of a city.",
      "And all she wanted was peace and quiet, the lush green grass of a field.",
      "Something scraped across the back of her hand and she looked down in shock, a once green and lush leaf was steadily crisping and turning golden before her eyes.",
      "A smile twisted her lips upwards but it was tinged with sadness.",
      "Autumn.",
      "She looked down to her right and found a beautiful flower with petals as red as blood stroking against her thumb.",
      "She plucked the flower gently from the ground and stood up as the earth cracked and opened.",
      "Looking over her shoulder she saw a crowd of people looking at the growing hole, with a laugh she turned and stepped backwards plunging into the hole.",
      "She heard the screams of terror from the mortals, the shouts for help for the girl who'd fallen.",
      "But the hole was gone as quickly as it appeared with no trace of the dark haired girl.",
      "In six months time these mortals would have forgotten her, the whole episode would be seen as a dream.",
      "Hades caught his wife swiftly and set her on her feet, before she could greet him, his mouth was upon hers and he was crushing her against the wall.",
      "For Hades the six months Persephone spent free from the Underworld were too long, for Persephone it was a conflict of emotions.",
      "The six months with mortals went too quick.",
      "As Hades presented her with a pomegranate she bit down into the fruit greedily, as she chewed the seeds she met Hades' eyes and smiled at him thoughtfully.",
      "Both were in silent agreement, her six months in the Underworld passed too quickly.",
      "As much as she loathed the darkness, Persephone was overcome with love for her husband and missed him when she was above ground."

    "text": "It really was the worst wedding ever. Thebes was in Ohio, far from the metropolises the Theodoridis had made their homes in. The wedding was held in a church that was packed with 500 people, and the reception was held in a large barn that was also an eyesore. The bride was Harmonia Theodoridou, daughter of Aphrodite Theodoridou and Ares Theodoridis, stepdaughter to Aphrodite's long-suffering husband Hephaestus Theodoridis. All night he watched the bride and groom with a scowl on his face, tapping his hands on a long, white box with a bow on it. Some of the wedding guests asked Hephaestus what was in the box. \"Oh, it's a very special necklace,\" he told the other guests. \"I hope Harmonia enjoys it for years to come.\" The groom was Cadmus Tyrovolas. There were whispers that the marriage was and would be loveless. Known philanderer Zeus Theodoridis took Cadmus' sister Europa away for a fling to some Caribbean island. Since Cadmus could never find Europa, finding and getting engaged to Harmonia felt like Cadmus claiming an unethical consolation prize. Even the ceremony was awkward. The Tyrovolas didn't spend enough on the wedding to cover the costs of the meals and wine for all the family Theodoridis and their associates. The most important members of the family Theodoridis, known as the \"Olympians,\" were fed well, but anyone who was a friend of a friend of a friend of an Olympian had to find a way to sneak McDonalds or a Lunchable in. One after one, the music acts had technical trouble. A guitar broke in half. Someone accidentally kicked in the ceremony's only drum set. The computer the DJ used to program the songs, mostly a rotating group of songs from past Greek Eurovision winners, got the Blue Screen of Death in the middle of songs. It was enough to bore Iasion Theodoridis to tears. He was only there because his father, Zeus, was the guest of honor. He wanted to go home to Samothrace. Sure, it might be cold in Samothrace at the moment, but at least in Samothrace, there were beaches, oceans and actual signs of life. So when a woman who looked old enough to be his mother slid beside him at his table drinking mead wine out of a champagne flute, she caught his eye. \"This wedding is awful, isn't it?\" \"Yeah. I've never seen a family make such a mess over a wedding.\" \"It's only going to get worse. I hear Hephaestus is going to give Cadmus this necklace, and it has a curse on it.\" The woman chuckled. \"I had no part in it. I don't even care.\" Iasion looked at the people awkwardly dancing to \"Alcohol Is Free.\" \"You know, I don't get a chance to go outside to play in the elements.\" Iasion shrugged. \"Why would you want to play around in the elements, anyway? It's nasty outside. I can tell. Dad's in one of his moods.\" \"Why wouldn't you? Don't you like the feel of rain hitting your skin, the squishiness of mud between your toes?\" \"No.\" \"Let me put it another way. You hate this wedding. I hate this wedding. What do you think about letting nature take its course?\" Iasion blinked, still watching people dancing. \"Nature is on a course?\" \"I guess I'll have to show you.\" The woman grabbed Iasion's hand. \"Come with me.\" The woman took Iasion to a field. Nothing was growing on it yet; it had been plowed, just in time for the rains that day. The woman got on top of Iasion and started kissing and humping him. Iasion grinned. \"I need you to make the ultimate sacrifice for me.\" \"Okay.\" \"You may not recover. But your sacrifice will be a good thing.\" \"Oh, I know a sacrifice is a good thing.\" Iasion thought the woman meant he needed to have an orgasm. He didn't think too much into what the woman was saying. \"Let's make this quick,\" Iasion said. \"We don't want to miss when Harmonia gets her gifts from her family. People will notice.\" \"I don't know if you can make it back. I know I can.\" Iasion laughed. \"Don't be silly. I only need a few minutes.\" A few minutes kissing and groping each other later and Iasion was on top of the woman, thrusting as hard and fast as he could. Four minutes later, the woman came, followed by Iasion. Iasion pulled out of the woman. \"Shit. I didn't bring a rubber.\" \"I didn't want you to bring a rubber. You're fortunate. I'm going to bring fortune to you, you know.\" \"Can I take a little break? I'm tired.\" \"Oh, of course you can. It's what I wanted you to do.\" Iasion lay down beside the woman, his arms and legs outstretched and his pants still down. He looked up at the sky. \"We've got to be getting in. Look at the lighting in the distance.\" Iasion felt the ground getting softer and softer. \"But this is really comfortable dirt. I can stay in it forever.\" The woman stood up. \"It's what I wanted you to do.\" It wasn't until Iasion saw his feet go under the ground that he realized the earth was swallowing him up. \"Wait a minute. What are you doing?\" \"This is your sacrifice. You're to make sure the crops in Thebes grow.\" \"Crops...crops? I know you. But why are you doing this to me?\" His legs were submerged. \"It's been a while since I've received a pig from this area.\" \"I'm not a pig. And you are a horrible aunt, De--\" Iasion disappeared into the ground. The woman rubbed her stomach. \"Don't worry. I can keep our little ones safe.\" A lightning bolt struck the ground where Iasion was buried. When the woman went back to the wedding ceremony without Iasion, mud on her back, Zeus asked her, \"Demeter, where have you been?\" \"It was fun. And it's none of your business.\" Months later Demeter Theodoridou gave birth to Iasion's children, Plutus and Philomelus. When he was about two years old, Philomenlus asked Demeter where his father was. \"He made the ultimate sacrifice for his country,\" Demeter said, and that was all she would say on the matter.",

    "text": "He called her Persephone. She didn't know why, and she hated the way he laughed when she asked him to explain. He never called her anything else though, and so she adopted the unusual word as a title of sorts. When enough years had passed for her to forget her real name, Persephone became her sole identifier. It was a good name, she decided. She liked the way he murmured it into her ear as his fingers ran up her thighs. His tongue always caught at the beginning of the second syllable, drawing out a hiss that made her shiver. It coiled around her body like a snake, squeezing so slowly that she never noticed how thoroughly trapped she was until it became difficult to breathe. When he was angry, the name became venomous fangs that sank into her skin. He shouted it in short, sharp bites, and the closest thing they came to a hiss was the sigh she gave in reply. She might have sobbed once. She probably had. She probably trembled under the weight of his voice and begged for forgiveness. She didn't remember doing so; eternity had a way of dulling the edges of both memory and fear. He sometimes asked her if she missed the world she left behind. It was a polite enquiry only, small-talk to pass the time in between overseeing the parades of the dead. She never gave him a straight answer. He would smile, as though he understood, and then order the next soul forward. She missed the idea of the world above. She barely remembered it, but there were books where she was, thousands of them, and they told of a burning sun and a luminous moon and how they shone on the fields and oceans below. As far as she could tell, the real treasures were the stars. She traced their illustrations and memorised their stories, carefully ensuring that the soft pad of her fingertip never rubbed away the ink. She mentioned the stars to him once, a brief lamentation that she could not see their beauty, and the next day he had lanterns installed into the ceilings of the caverns. There had been many nights spent spread out on the ground just staring up, granting the 'stars' names and inventing constellations. He did not join her and she did not ask him to. She did not want anything to break the spell her nightly stargazing cast over her, and his flat way of viewing the world would certainly ruin things. He only permitted her her fancies when she did not include him in them, and even then it was clear that he indulged her as he would a child who was convinced that fairies lived in the garden. (She had read about fairies, too. She wanted to ask him if they existed in other realms but she valued her daydreams far too highly to spoil them with truth.) He had already reminded her that time was irrelevant to them. It both amused and bewildered him that she should cling to the mortal concept of capturing time and placing it in firm categories. They were no longer part of a realm which needed such distinctions. There was no sun to signal day, there was no moon to welcome in night. There was nothing celestial at all, except the constant presence of 'stars'. It didn't seem right to her, even after all this time. Things needed distinction and balance. It was why she was here, after all. A gentle touch to try and soothe the harsh judgements he passed. It wasn't as though they were unaware, or even subtle, about it. The thrones they sat on were carved from ivory and obsidian respectively, and it was rarely something the souls who stood in front of them failed to notice. They would appeal to her sense of justice and mercy, pleading with her as though she could not read every sin they had committed written in the blood of those they had wronged. If she condemned them, betrayal and confusion flitted across their features before they were dragged away. They so often mistook her capacity for mercy as meekness and saw fit to lie to her and offer her empty promises. She could feel the pleasure radiating from him every time she sentenced someone to the flames. He would tell her how proud he was that she had chosen damnation, and while he said it with some semblance of affection, there was always a note of bitterness to accompany it. Sometimes the bitterness outweighed the affection, and he would demand to know if she still thought she was better than him. As if she ever had. Perhaps he disliked the roles they had been cast into as much as she did. She never bothered to ask. It was always easy to tell when there was conflict in the world above. There would be an influx of souls with stains which spread like poison across their bodies. Their darkness was the same regardless of if they had killed one person or a thousand, and their defiance was born of the belief that their cause was worth dying for. They never seemed to notice how the echoes of screaming children clung to them like a shroud. She no longer felt horror or outrage, although in the most extreme circumstances a small voice nagged at the back of her mind that she should feel something. She heeded this little voice as best she could; her condemnations reflected the emotions she could not feel. He regarded every soul with the same impassivity. His readiness to damn petty thieves and murderers alike was a source of endless aggravation to her, just as her tight contradictions infuriated him. Together they managed a conclusion of sorts, be it eternal peace or eternal unrest. She doubted he had ever had a conscience, whereas hers had simply worn away over time. He loved her, she recognised with a sense of detachment. Sometimes, like when he brought her 'stars' and books and held her as they slept, she thought she could love him back.",

    "text": "Things didn't appear out of thin air in Eleusis, Oklahoma, not back in 1933. Things hadn't appeared there in months. The population was only 200 people, and most people had fled for cleaner skies elsewhere in all directions: California, Canada, the East Coast. The only person in the town was Triptolemus Celeus, or \"Trip\" for short. But there was a reason why Trip was still there. Years ago, an old woman came to town. She called herself \"Doso.\" Doso was looking for her daughter. Someone had kidnapped her, but the woman didn't know where. She found her way to the house of King Celeus, the mayor of Eleusis, and his wife, Metanira. Between Trip and his brother, Demophon, Trip was the luckier of the two. Doso suckled Trip, who was near death, and, according to local legend, he became a man that same day. Metanira thought her son was a guest of Doso's and let him be, not realizing the young man was her son. Demophon wasn't so lucky. While Trip obeyed Doso's orders and kept quiet while his brother was sitting on the hearth in King's living room, his mortal soul burning away, Metanira walked in to the living room to see Demophon on the fire. And she screamed. Doso was actually the spirit known as Demeter. Demeter was said to make the things on the earth grow. Few people saw her, but most farmers in rural counties were convinced she existed. Metanira was one of those people that knew Demeter existed after seeing Trip become a man in a day and Demophon perish in the hearth fire. Metanira pleaded for Demeter to spare her son. Demeter agreed, as long as Demeter was allowed to collect the man to teach him the arts of agriculture when the time came. And that was why Trip was still in the ghost town of Eleusis, even as his parents fled for California after the town's collapse: holding his promise, making sure he wouldn't miss Demeter. Trip read the news from the Oklahoman that the Agricultural Adjustment Act had passed. He read the article and then packed his few possessions from his childhood home. When Trip saw Demeter and Persephone in Demeter's green Duesenberg Model J, a vehicle she proudly called \"The Dragon,\" floating on to what was Eleusis' main street he knew the time had come. Demeter had business in New York with her relatives, the Theoi, so Demeter dropped Trip off in Scythia, North Carolina, with the instruction of teaching the mayor how to farm. Scythia was almost a ghost town like Eleusis. Because it was the East Coast, it wasn't as dusty as Eleusis. That and the town's population of 75 people were its only redeeming points. The mayor of Scythia was also a King like Trip's father, but his last name was Lyncus. Lyncus knew everyone in Scythia, so when he saw Trip walk up to the door in overalls and a derby, he knew something was off. Trip rang the doorbell. Lyncus answered it. \"You King Lyncus?\" Trip asked. \"Yes, I am, boy.\" \"I'm Trip. Under the orders of the US Government and my patron, Demeter Olympios, I'm here to teach you how to farm under the Agricultural Adjustment Act so you can teach your town how to farm under it. In return, the government will pay you.\" Lyncus stared at Trip. \"You know the Demeter Olympios.\" \"She breastfed me herself, sir.\" Lyncus laughed. \"Oh, I gotta hear this one. Come in. I want to learn how you're going to teach me how to farm.\"",

    "text": "Artemis examined him with narrowed eyes. He was fairly certain he wasn't imagining the glint in them, though, so Dionysus summoned his best smile. He liked Artemis, but one of the things he liked about her was the fact that she could probably snap him over her knee, if she wanted to. \"What makes you think I would even be interested?\" she said, after a long silence. \"You're male. That is usually fairly prohibitory.\" \"Well,\" Dionysus said, \"nominally.\" When Artemis raised her eyebrows at him, he added, \"more of an accident of birth than anything, and I've always found it rather peculiar that gods should need to hew to such restrictive mortal notions...\" \"Hm,\" Artemis said. Her eyes narrowed again. \"You know the rules.\" \"Sister,\" Dionysus said, and when Artemis shot him a bit of a look, he amended, \"or cousin, if that makes you feel better. The rules are why I came to you.\" Artemis's mouth ticked up at the corner, very slightly. \"Is that so?\" Dionysus waggled his eyebrows. \"What can I say? I'm an infamous reprobate. And I always did want to be a nymph.\" \"If I thought you could behave, I might even let you,\" Artemis said, sounding faintly amused. He definitely wasn't imagining the glint in her eye now. \"Your place or mine?\" Dionysus asked, somewhat archly. \"Do you have a place?\" Artemis asked, with just a bit of an edge. Dionysus pressed a hand to his chest, affecting a wound. \"And do you, lady of the woods?\" A sly smile spread across her face that Dionysus decided he liked. Even if it made his skin crawl a little. Maybe because it made his skin crawl a little. \"Oh,\" she said, \"I have one we can borrow.\" Dionysus would have asked what Apollo had done wrong this time except that (a) he could guess and (b) the idea that he was going to get himself fucked by Apollo's (technically virgin) sister on Apollo's bed was enough to make his breath come a little short. Also, Apollo's rooms were nice. \"Strip,\" Artemis said, once the door was closed behind them. \"And get on the bed.\" \"So authoritative,\" Dionysus said, feeling a pleased little shiver roll down his spine. The look Artemis gave him could have shot arrows. \"Expecting something else?\" she said, with a faintly deadly tone in her voice that suggested she was anticipating an answer that would land Dionysus with a non-fatal but decidedly unpleasant knife in the bowels. Or perhaps somewhere a little lower. Ever contrary, Dionysus felt his cock twitch. \"Just appreciative,\" Dionysus said, with a smile. \"One can only take so many fawning sycophants, you know. I like to...change things around.\" Artemis eyed him a moment longer, and then cocked her head. \"That is what you do, isn't it?\" she said, a little wry, and then waved her hand. \"Go on. If you wanted to bandy words you should have propositioned my brother.\" Dionysus smirked. \"Maybe if we do this again I can invite him?\" Artemis laughed. It was quiet and low and a little wicked and Dionysus decided that he liked that sound, too. He stripped and climbed onto the bed, lay back and stretched out on his elbows. Artemis had shed her light clothing and had her back to him, and Dionysus let his eyes linger just for a little while on the muscular curve of her buttocks. She turned around, and Dionysus let his eyes go from the straps of dark leather cutting across her skin to the perfectly modeled cock jutting from between her legs. His eyebrows went up as his mouth went a little (pleasantly) dry. \"And where were you keeping that?\" \"Don't ask questions you don't want the answers to,\" Artemis said, and if that didn't give him all kinds of interesting ideas that he was going to have to keep from voicing, because he wanted to leave this room able to walk. Probably. Although if she had other ideas... Dionysus started to push himself up off the bed, only to end up right back down on it again, blinking up at Artemis and simultaneously alarmed and stirred by the predatory gleam of her eyes. \"So,\" she said, almost conversationally. \"Shall I assume that you have done this before?\" \"Maybe once or twice,\" Dionysus said lightly. He let his legs fall open on either side of her, though she was too far away for him to push up against her, and he didn't quite dare trying to pull her down. \"And you-\" Artemis snorted. \"Whoever thought that a general lack of fondness for men meant I must be eternally celibate must have an appalling lack of imagination,\" she said, and then moved, her teeth sinking deeply into his lower lip as her hand moved past his cock to grab his balls. The little thrill of terror that went through him was positively delectable, his whole body twitching violently and a moan escaping his lips. Her hands were callused - from the archery, he supposed, and Dionysus wondered what it would be like to have a female body and feel those powerful fingers stroking along slippery folds. He squirmed, violently, cock growing hard against her hip. He could feel Artemis's phallus pressing into his stomach, hard and unyielding. She rolled his balls between her fingers and Dionysus arched off Apollo's bed, toes curling. \"Ah-!\" Dionysus tried to worm his hand between them, to touch her, but her fingers locked around his wrist and shoved it back to the bed as she pulled back and gave him a hard look. \"Turn over,\" she said. Dionysus swallowed. \"Not much of one for the niceties, are you?\" Artemis's eyes narrowed. \"If I weren't being nice you would know.\" Oh. Oh. Dionysus summoned a grin, this one the one that had gotten him in trouble more times than he could count. \"Is that a promise?\" Artemis's fingers, still wrapped around rather delicate bits of his anatomy, gave him a squeeze and a tug, and Dionysus yelped. \"Bit - bit much,\" he said, a little breathlessly, and she smiled at him. Dangerous. Predatory. If lionesses could smile, Dionysus thought vaguely, it might look a little like that. \"Turn over,\" she repeated, and this time he obeyed, flipping to his stomach. Artemis straddled his hips, her fingers running over the muscles of his back. More appraising than caressing, though. A moment later she draped over him, her hips grinding down so her phallus rubbed over the crack of his ass, and bit down on his shoulder. Dionysus gasped, rutting down into the soft, plush covers of Apollo's bed. Apollo's bed that he was going to come all over, and wasn't that an enticing thought. \"Are you - so mouthy with all you take to your bower?\" he asked, voice a little thick. \"You are mouthy,\" Artemis corrected. \"I bite.\" And did so again, hard enough that there was going to be a mark. Dionysus moaned into the bed. She pulled back and sat up, and Dionysus helpfully lifted his hips, bringing his knees up the bed. Her fingers pushed the pucker of his asshole and he let out a quiet grunt but relaxed, letting his body open for her. She wasn't gentle, or slow - her fingers were as demanding as her mouth had been, but the ache and burn had him gasping too, hips moving in little jerks. When she added a second finger, without warning, he yelped. \"Ah - perhaps a little bit of something - to ease-\" \"You could very well see to that if you wanted to,\" Artemis accused. \"Can I help it if I'm enjoying the attention?\" The twist of Artemis's fingers, even as she added a generous amount of oil, he did not think was unintentional, but it sent a spike of pleasure all the way up his spine that had his cock leaking generously, and he wormed a hand under himself to wrap his fist around it, to hold himself from spilling already. She worked him open until he was gasping and muttering barely coherent half sentences into the bed under him, and then pulled her fingers out and wiped them on his hip. He was gratified to hear her voice sounding a little thick as well, the head of her false cock nudging at his rear. \"My plan,\" she said, \"is to fuck you through this bed until you scream loud enough to bring Apollo running.\" Oh dear, Dionysus thought, a little vaguely. It was possible that he had - gotten in the middle of something. Well, that was all right. \"Objections?\" Artemis panted. \"None at the moment,\" Dionysus mumbled, tightening his grip on his own cock, and Artemis lined up hers and thrust in. The phallus she was using was relatively slender - he had certainly taken more - but he still felt himself stretch to accommodate it and a muffled moan burst from his lips as she drove deep in and he could feel every inch of her along his insides. Spitted on Artemis's cock, he thought a little dazedly, and his body gave a hungry throb. \"Ah - Artemis,\" he pushed out. \"If this is one of the privileges of being a nymph of yours-\" She withdrew and thrust again, her hips snapping out and in. He could feel her muscular thighs pressed against his body, and as she shifted angles her cock moved as well and his toes curled, a short, muffled yell bursting from his throat. And then she really got going. Artemis had promised to fuck him through the bed, and Dionysus had assumed that was exaggeration. In retrospect, probably a foolish assumption. She drove into him over and over, perfectly and gloriously tireless (of course, she was a goddess, and one orgasm wouldn't stop her as it might a man). Her hands went to his shoulders and pushed his face down into the bed, and he was fairly certain he had not been so vigorously used - possibly in his whole life. His determination not to come gave out before she did, and he spilled with a loud and strangled yell on his stomach and the bed (Apollo's bed), but Artemis fucked him mercilessly through it, hand planted between his shoulder blades so she could keep that merciless angle that had him hard again almost before he had recovered. He had long since lost track of what he was saying - or screaming - except that it was a mixture of garbled pleas and praise and sometimes just wordless yelling, when he heard the door bang open. \"Artemis?\" He heard, somewhere through the dazed fog of need and lust that had become most of his world. \"What are you - is that -\" Dionysus tried to lift his head so he could get a look at Apollo's face - maybe invite him to join - but a sharp thrust of Artemis's hips had him flopping limply back to the bed, fingers curling in the covers as he slid through his own wet spot. \"Yes,\" she said, sounding almost convincingly casual. \"We're borrowing your room.\" \"Get out,\" Apollo said, sounding like he was trying not to scream. \"Get - you barbarian harlot, you are defiling my innocent sister-\" Actually, Dionysus would have objected, if he could get his breath, I think she might be defiling me, technically speaking. Artemis snorted. \"I'm older than you, if you've forgotten,\" she said. \"And I thought maybe you'd - uhn - forgotten what consensual sex looked like, considering how you keep acting around my - my nymphs-\" She shifted her hips, and Dionysus let out a delighted howl that he didn't even attempt to muffle. Enjoy your soiled bedding, he thought a little viciously. \"Stop - stop this right now,\" Apollo hissed, but Artemis just laughed and quickened her pace again. \"I'm - ah - do you think he wants to watch me finish?\" Dionysus managed to push out, and Artemis grabbed him by the hair and hauled him upright so he was leaning back against her, upright, the new position pushing her deeper than ever. \"We'll talk about this later,\" Apollo said, before Dionysus could get his eyes open, and just as Artemis's other hand wrapped around his cock, and fled. Dionysus came laughing, and he could hear Artemis laughing too, through her nose. He wondered how she would take to an offer of his tongue. Very well, it turned out.",

      "\"Sister,\" Dionysus said, and when Artemis shot him a bit of a look, he amended, \"or cousin, if that makes you feel better.",
      "The rules are why I came to you.\"",
      "Artemis's mouth ticked up at the corner, very slightly.",
      "\"Is that so?\" Dionysus waggled his eyebrows.",
      "\"What can I say?",
      "I'm an infamous reprobate.",
      "And I always did want to be a nymph.\"",
      "\"If I thought you could behave, I might even let you,\" Artemis said, sounding faintly amused.",
      "He definitely wasn't imagining the glint in her eye now.",
      "\"Your place or mine?\" Dionysus asked, somewhat archly.",
      "\"Do you have a place?\"",
      "Artemis asked, with just a bit of an edge.",
      "Dionysus pressed a hand to his chest, affecting a wound.",
      "\"And do you, lady of the woods?\"",
      "A sly smile spread across her face that Dionysus decided he liked.",
      "Even if it made his skin crawl a little.",
      "Maybe because it made his skin crawl a little.",
      "\"Oh,\" she said, \"I have one we can borrow.\"",
      "Dionysus would have asked what Apollo had done wrong this time except that (a) he could guess and (b) the idea that he was going to get himself fucked by Apollo's (technically virgin) sister on Apollo's bed was enough to make his breath come a little short.",
      "Also, Apollo's rooms were nice.",
      "\"Strip,\" Artemis said, once the door was closed behind them.",
      "\"And get on the bed.\"",
      "\"So authoritative,\" Dionysus said, feeling a pleased little shiver roll down his spine.",
      "The look Artemis gave him could have shot arrows.",
      "\"Expecting something else?\" she said, with a faintly deadly tone in her voice that suggested she was anticipating an answer that would land Dionysus with a non-fatal but decidedly unpleasant knife in the bowels.",
      "Or perhaps somewhere a little lower.",
      "Ever contrary, Dionysus felt his cock twitch.",
      "\"Just appreciative,\" Dionysus said, with a smile.",
      "\"One can only take so many fawning sycophants, you know.",
      "I like to...change things around.\"",
      "Artemis eyed him a moment longer, and then cocked her head.",
      "\"That is what you do, isn't it?\" she said, a little wry, and then waved her hand.",
      "\"Go on.",
      "If you wanted to bandy words you should have propositioned my brother.\"",
      "Dionysus smirked.",
      "\"Maybe if we do this again I can invite him?\" Artemis laughed.",
      "It was quiet and low and a little wicked and Dionysus decided that he liked that sound, too.",
      "He stripped and climbed onto the bed, lay back and stretched out on his elbows.",
      "Artemis had shed her light clothing and had her back to him, and Dionysus let his eyes linger just for a little while on the muscular curve of her buttocks.",
      "She turned around, and Dionysus let his eyes go from the straps of dark leather cutting across her skin to the perfectly modeled cock jutting from between her legs.",
      "His eyebrows went up as his mouth went a little (pleasantly) dry.",
      "\"And where were you keeping that?\" \"Don't ask questions you don't want the answers to,\" Artemis said, and if that didn't give him all kinds of interesting ideas that he was going to have to keep from voicing, because he wanted to leave this room able to walk.",
      "Probably.",
      "Although if she had other ideas...",
      "Dionysus started to push himself up off the bed, only to end up right back down on it again, blinking up at Artemis and simultaneously alarmed and stirred by the predatory gleam of her eyes.",
      "\"So,\" she said, almost conversationally.",
      "\"Shall I assume that you have done this before?\"",
      "\"Maybe once or twice,\" Dionysus said lightly.",
      "He let his legs fall open on either side of her, though she was too far away for him to push up against her, and he didn't quite dare trying to pull her down.",
      "\"And you-\" Artemis snorted.",
      "\"Whoever thought that a general lack of fondness for men meant I must be eternally celibate must have an appalling lack of imagination,\" she said, and then moved, her teeth sinking deeply into his lower lip as her hand moved past his cock to grab his balls.",
      "The little thrill of terror that went through him was positively delectable, his whole body twitching violently and a moan escaping his lips.",
      "Her hands were callused - from the archery, he supposed, and Dionysus wondered what it would be like to have a female body and feel those powerful fingers stroking along slippery folds.",
      "He squirmed, violently, cock growing hard against her hip.",
      "He could feel Artemis's phallus pressing into his stomach, hard and unyielding.",
      "She rolled his balls between her fingers and Dionysus arched off Apollo's bed, toes curling.",
      "\"Ah-!\"",
      "Dionysus tried to worm his hand between them, to touch her, but her fingers locked around his wrist and shoved it back to the bed as she pulled back and gave him a hard look.",
      "\"Turn over,\" she said.",
      "Dionysus swallowed.",
      "\"Not much of one for the niceties, are you?\" Artemis's eyes narrowed.",
      "\"If I weren't being nice you would know.\"",
      "Oh.",
      "Oh.",
      "Dionysus summoned a grin, this one the one that had gotten him in trouble more times than he could count.",
      "\"Is that a promise?\" Artemis's fingers, still wrapped around rather delicate bits of his anatomy, gave him a squeeze and a tug, and Dionysus yelped.",
      "\"Bit - bit much,\" he said, a little breathlessly, and she smiled at him.",
      "Dangerous.",
      "Predatory.",
      "If lionesses could smile, Dionysus thought vaguely, it might look a little like that.",
      "\"Turn over,\" she repeated, and this time he obeyed, flipping to his stomach.",
      "Artemis straddled his hips, her fingers running over the muscles of his back.",
      "More appraising than caressing, though.",
      "A moment later she draped over him, her hips grinding down so her phallus rubbed over the crack of his ass, and bit down on his shoulder.",
      "Dionysus gasped, rutting down into the soft, plush covers of Apollo's bed.",
      "Apollo's bed that he was going to come all over, and wasn't that an enticing thought.",
      "\"Are you - so mouthy with all you take to your bower?\" he asked, voice a little thick.",
      "\"You are mouthy,\" Artemis corrected.",
      "\"I bite.\"",
      "And did so again, hard enough that there was going to be a mark.",
      "Dionysus moaned into the bed.",
      "She pulled back and sat up, and Dionysus helpfully lifted his hips, bringing his knees up the bed.",
      "Her fingers pushed the pucker of his asshole and he let out a quiet grunt but relaxed, letting his body open for her.",
      "She wasn't gentle, or slow - her fingers were as demanding as her mouth had been, but the ache and burn had him gasping too, hips moving in little jerks.",
      "When she added a second finger, without warning, he yelped.",
      "\"Ah - perhaps a little bit of something - to ease-\" \"You could very well see to that if you wanted to,\" Artemis accused.",
      "\"Can I help it if I'm enjoying the attention?\"",
      "The twist of Artemis's fingers, even as she added a generous amount of oil, he did not think was unintentional, but it sent a spike of pleasure all the way up his spine that had his cock leaking generously, and he wormed a hand under himself to wrap his fist around it, to hold himself from spilling already.",
      "She worked him open until he was gasping and muttering barely coherent half sentences into the bed under him, and then pulled her fingers out and wiped them on his hip.",
      "He was gratified to hear her voice sounding a little thick as well, the head of her false cock nudging at his rear.",
      "\"My plan,\" she said, \"is to fuck you through this bed until you scream loud enough to bring Apollo running.\"",
      "Oh dear, Dionysus thought, a little vaguely.",
      "It was possible that he had - gotten in the middle of something.",
      "Well, that was all right.",
      "\"Objections?\" Artemis panted.",
      "\"None at the moment,\" Dionysus mumbled, tightening his grip on his own cock, and Artemis lined up hers and thrust in.",
      "The phallus she was using was relatively slender - he had certainly taken more - but he still felt himself stretch to accommodate it and a muffled moan burst from his lips as she drove deep in and he could feel every inch of her along his insides.",
      "Spitted on Artemis's cock, he thought a little dazedly, and his body gave a hungry throb.",
      "\"Ah - Artemis,\" he pushed out.",
      "\"If this is one of the privileges of being a nymph of yours-\"",
      "She withdrew and thrust again, her hips snapping out and in.",
      "He could feel her muscular thighs pressed against his body, and as she shifted angles her cock moved as well and his toes curled, a short, muffled yell bursting from his throat.",
      "And then she really got going.",
      "Artemis had promised to fuck him through the bed, and Dionysus had assumed that was exaggeration.",
      "In retrospect, probably a foolish assumption.",
      "She drove into him over and over, perfectly and gloriously tireless (of course, she was a goddess, and one orgasm wouldn't stop her as it might a man).",
      "Her hands went to his shoulders and pushed his face down into the bed, and he was fairly certain he had not been so vigorously used - possibly in his whole life.",
      "His determination not to come gave out before she did, and he spilled with a loud and strangled yell on his stomach and the bed (Apollo's bed), but Artemis fucked him mercilessly through it, hand planted between his shoulder blades so she could keep that merciless angle that had him hard again almost before he had recovered.",
      "He had long since lost track of what he was saying - or screaming - except that it was a mixture of garbled pleas and praise and sometimes just wordless yelling, when he heard the door bang open.",
      "\"Artemis?\"",
      "He heard, somewhere through the dazed fog of need and lust that had become most of his world.",
      "\"What are you - is that -\" Dionysus tried to lift his head so he could get a look at Apollo's face - maybe invite him to join - but a sharp thrust of Artemis's hips had him flopping limply back to the bed, fingers curling in the covers as he slid through his own wet spot.",
      "\"Yes,\" she said, sounding almost convincingly casual.",
      "\"We're borrowing your room.\"",
      "\"Get out,\" Apollo said, sounding like he was trying not to scream.",
      "\"Get - you barbarian harlot, you are defiling my innocent sister-\" Actually, Dionysus would have objected, if he could get his breath, I think she might be defiling me, technically speaking.",
      "Artemis snorted.",
      "\"I'm older than you, if you've forgotten,\" she said.",
      "\"And I thought maybe you'd - uhn - forgotten what consensual sex looked like, considering how you keep acting around my - my nymphs-\" She shifted her hips, and Dionysus let out a delighted howl that he didn't even attempt to muffle.",
      "Enjoy your soiled bedding, he thought a little viciously.",
      "\"Stop - stop this right now,\" Apollo hissed, but Artemis just laughed and quickened her pace again.",
      "\"I'm - ah - do you think he wants to watch me finish?\" Dionysus managed to push out, and Artemis grabbed him by the hair and hauled him upright so he was leaning back against her, upright, the new position pushing her deeper than ever.",
      "\"We'll talk about this later,\" Apollo said, before Dionysus could get his eyes open, and just as Artemis's other hand wrapped around his cock, and fled.",
      "Dionysus came laughing, and he could hear Artemis laughing too, through her nose.",
      "He wondered how she would take to an offer of his tongue.",
      "Very well, it turned out."

    "text": "He found her at table, the morning after she had returned to him. What morning could be had, at least, here beneath the Earth. He found her still and silent, her back to him as she stood beside the marble, her head bowed and her attention fixed on the object in her hand. A pomegranate, he saw, as he moved silently around to stand before her, as he moved to see her face. In her hand, the juice red against her fingers like the blood of rubies, lay a torn and opened fruit. And in her face, he thought, lay an aspect he had not seen before. No more a maiden, now, innocent and sweet as the fruits of the earth. But a queen, stern and terrible as the underworld that had become her home. In her face, he saw the future he had wrought, the bride he had bought with such red-stained trickery. \"You might have offered me all the wealth of your realm,\" she said quietly, more to the dark gleaming of seeds in torn flesh than to him. \"You might have offered me gold and rubies, all the wealth of the deepest earth. Hades, who is god of all that springs forth from the darkness below. You might have offered me riches beyond dreams. And instead, you would have a seed betray me. You would have the fruit of earth itself bring me low.\" There was pain in her, a deep and martial fury in the hard lines of her features, in the clawed curl of her fingers against the fruit. A future well wrought, a deep and terrible justice borne forth in an anguished breast. He paused for a moment at the sight of it, at the knowledge of it. Held still, a chthonic patience, before he reached out with pale, cold hands to cup the back of hers and twine their fingers in red flesh. \"There is more than cold wealth to rest beneath the earth,\" he said, very quietly. \"And there is more than riches to return to it, when they are spent. All seeds spring forth from me, in the beginning. And all seeds fall back to me, in the end. It is... the way of things.\" It was not an apology. It was never that. But she looked at him anyway, and he tried at least to explain. \"It was my wealth I offered you,\" he said. \"And my wealth that betrayed you. Not yours. It could not have bound you, were it not mine.\" And though it was not an apology, though it could not be, still he saw a strange softening of her features because of it. A glimmer once more of the maiden he had first seen. \"And what seed did you plant in me?\" she asked, almost gently as she turned to him, as she inclined herself towards him. \"What seed to return to you when it is done?\" He closed his eyes, the silence of grim caverns echoing around him, and pressed his hands close around hers, the red blood of a treacherous fruit staining and warming them both against the emptiness. In the darkness beneath the earth and behind his eyes, he saw again the queen promised in her new aspect, and held the promise close within his breast. \"A hope and a vengeance,\" he answered, opening his eyes. \"A companion... and a queen.\" She looked at him. Persephone, the maiden stolen, and the queen returned. She looked into his breast that held a cavernous heart, and smiled, raising their linked hands between them, yet bound together in ribbons of red. \"And will you taste of that seed, then?\" she murmured, gentle and cruel in equal measure. \"Will you taste of that binding, husband, and be bound to me when I spring forth, as I am bound to you when I fall back?\" Never more terrible had she looked than that moment, and never more painful had hope sprung within his breast. He trembled against the strength of her, and did not speak to answer. Could not, not then, not in the face of her. So instead, he leaned forward, and touched her stained fingers to his lips. He curled his hand through hers, the pomegranate pressed between them, and leaned in to drink red treachery down. To taste the fruit of her hands, as she had tasted the fruit of his, and bind his empty heart there to hers. A promise, a binding. A hope and a vengeance, in the darkness beneath the earth, from which all seeds sprang forth, and to which all seeds returned. He stood there as her companion. And she, forever more, as his queen.",

    "text": "Hades doesn't really leave the underworld, unless his idiot brother calls for him. Even then, he ignores him for as long as possible, uninterested in whatever petty squabbles the gods are having over who defiled whose temple or who stole whose sacred staff of whatever or who Zeus slept with again. So, no, the realm above the underworld does not have much appeal to him. He's content with sitting on his throne, receiving the dead, far away from all the complicated politics and entanglements his troublesome brothers and sisters tend to engage themselves in. There is nothing he lacks, nothing he desires that he cannot find here. \"A consort?\" Hades echoes incredulously as he stands with Charon by the river Styx, stopping for a short chat with the ferryman before the both of them have to return to their respective duties. Charon nods, his bones rattling with the movement. \"Haven't you considered it?\" A consort. He scoffs at the idea. \"I have no need for a companion,\" Hades replies, staring into the depths of the Styx. \"I rule this place on my own just fine.\" Charon bows his head as if in agreement, though Hades suspects he may just be humoring him. \"It is simply something I observed during my many years of ferrying the dead,\" he says, \"as well as my conversations with Hermes. Even the gods have their dalliances.\" \"And look where those got them.\" He scoffs again. \"Demigods who end up defying them, wreaking havoc, and sending more souls to me in their quest for recognition.\" \"Ah, but while the god have made their mistakes, you cannot deny that there have been mortals who have come,\" he pauses, then adds, \"foolishly, of course, to the underworld with the intent of reclaiming their loved ones.\" Hades hums. \"Indeed, there have been a few.\" He had turned them away, had them dragged back to the world of the living. They had no place in his domain. Charon's bones clatter quietly as he glances up the river before moving to pick up his oar. It's time for him to return to the mouth of the river. \"Doesn't it make you wonder what it is that gives these small humans the courage to venture here, to face even you, the fearsome god of the underworld himself?\" \"'Love', isn't it?\" Hades calls, almost boredly, as Charon climbs onto the boat. \"Just a weakness of the heart.\" Charon turns to him with his hollow eyes. \"Perhaps.\" \"You think otherwise?\" Charon bows his head again. \"I only think of what is in your best interest.\" He watches Charon makes his way back up the river as he muses upon Charon's words. Loneliness, love. Those words mean nothing to him. He is no stronger or weaker for feeling neither. \"Perhaps,\" Hades repeats, this time, unsure. The surface of the Styx shimmers. Silently, he turns and walks toward the stables, to his chariot. - He is used to the dark and dank, the oppressive silence and the faraway echoes of suffering and pain from Tartarus, but that doesn't necessarily mean he enjoys it. He did not ask for the underworld, after all. The world above ground is bright and colorful, an annoyance to his vision, at worst, but he can appreciate it, especially when he's not just passing through to get to an inane meeting with his brother. He does not dare touch down on the ground, not keen on causing a panic. Meeting Hades may be an inevitability for every human in the world, but he does not begrudge humanity for hoping to never see his face until their time comes. So he roams, far above the farms and small villages, temples and palaces. It's not terribly interesting, watching mortals go about their day, but it's relaxing in its mundaneness. He sets the reins down, allowing his horses to wander as they please. This is his first mistake. Eventually, his horses lead him over a vast field, lush and vibrant with plant life, almost impossibly so. It must be the work of a god, he thinks. Demeter, most likely. Not the least bit inclined to confirm if it is her doing, he allows his horses to continue their path over the field as he looks elsewhere. This is his second mistake. It's then when he notices a scent wafting in the air, sweet and alluring. Before he can do anything, his horses catch the scent as well, judging by the way they slow down, their heads turning left and right as their nostrils flare. They gradually begin to descend, toward the field and toward the scent. Picking up the reins, Hades pulls, trying to lead the chariot away, to keep from getting any closer, but the horses whinny and neigh, refusing to obey. With a short huff, he lets go of the reins. As feared as his horses are, they are still horses, in the end. Though it's unusual for them to be so stubborn, he has a more pressing matter at hand, diverting his effort to thinking of a way to get Demeter to let him be on his way as quickly as possible. The woman has a temper and knows how to nag. Touching down in a small clearing, the horses immediately set on burying their faces in whatever mysterious plant was emitting the scent. Hades, on the other hand, takes in his surroundings, noting the alarming variety of flowers. There's patches of pansies, honeysuckle and chrysanthemums, irises of all colors and orchids poking out to greet him, with a few squashes and pumpkins scattered amongst them. It's almost whimsical, the whole arrangement. There's hardly any order, much less any sense for them to be here all together. He eyes the towering sunflowers and stalks of corn surrounding him with suspicion. Now that he thinks about it, Demeter is hardly the type to grow a field like this, one that is more for aesthetics than utility. He steps off the chariot. This is his third mistake. As soon as his feet touch the ground, vines emerge from the carpet of flowers like snakes, winding around his wrists and ankles and tightening like shackles. He takes one look at the vines, pulls experimentally, and sighs, knowing better than to try to struggle. A trap. Of course. The one day he decides to go above ground on his own volition, someone is raring to catch him. The sunflowers stir. He listens to the rustling leaves, waiting for his captor to emerge. Perhaps it's a mortal who's got their hands on some magical artifact, intending to hold him hostage until he agrees to release a soul from the underworld? I have to admit, he thinks as he looks down and tugs halfheartedly at his bindings again, this is one of the more well-thought out plans. \"Wow, that actually worked!\" Hades looks up. This is his fourth and final mistake. For a moment, all he sees is a silhouette, his eyes blinded by the sunlight shining directly down at him. Blinking slowly a few more times, his vision adjusts as the silhouette steps closer, their features gradually growing clearer. Or rather, her features. He doesn't remember her, at first, - the newer gods don't mean much to him in the underworld -, until she smiles, genuine and fearless. \"Persephone.\" Persephone reaches out to pluck at the vines binding his wrist. They bend and curl around her thin dainty fingers like fawning cats. \"I caught you,\" she looks up at him through long eyelashes, her wild hair framing her rosy cheeks, glowing with pride, \"Hades.\" Persephone, the goddess of vegetation. Demeter's creation. She's just as vibrant as she was when he first saw her, when she was first created, brimming with lively radiance, impossibly brighter than everything he's seen in this world. And she is his captor. Unsure of what to think of her yet, he keeps his eyes on her as she circles him, tapping her chin with a rather smug expression. \"Very good, Persephone,\" Hades commends without sarcasm. It is a known fact that his horses are impossible to catch; but luring them to her field and then ensnaring their rider once he's close enough, it's really quite clever. \"Now, if you would kindly let me go.\" She pauses in front of him, clicking her tongue. \"Ah well, that would defeat the purpose of me capturing you, wouldn't it?\" Her lips curve into a sly smile as she taps his chest with her finger. \"I've captured you, so I get to keep you.\" Hades stares down at her, unable to respond to her bold assumption. He's quite sure she doesn't have any authority over any god - and if she did, certainly not over him - nor does she have the power to trap him here. He pulls a little harder at the vines. They pull back and go rigid in response, anchoring him in place. Well, maybe she does have the power, but not the authority, surely. \"You can't keep me here,\" he tells her as she sprinkles grass on him. She smiles wide and raises her chin, the sunlight in her eyes dancing with mischief. \"Watch me.\" - She keeps him there. He has been released from his bindings but it makes no difference; the wall of corn and sunflowers cannot be breached and it seems like the scent that had lured his horses has also weakened his own power, preventing him from returning to the underworld. He supposes he could try to threaten her, but there isn't much he can threaten her with and it's clear that she doesn't fear him. Besides, it wouldn't be a wise decision, seeing as how he is in her domain. There are worse things that could have happened. Some half-god human could have demanded that he give him Cerberus. Someone could have captured him with the intent of making a mess of the underworld while he was gone. It could have been Zeus who found him. \"You don't come around here a lot,\" Persephone points out as she digs her bare heels into the loamy ground and yanks a number of carrots out, one by one, rubbing the dirt off of them with the edge of her robes before tossing them in a basket, intending to feed his horses with them. It's really quite embarrassing, the great steeds of the underworld acting so ordinary and submissive. First, they get him into this mess and now they're snorting happily into the hand of who led them there. \"I try not to,\" Hades says bluntly as he examines a pomegranate from his own feeding basket. Persephone returns to her spot on the ground, sitting across from him. She motions for him to sit with her and he obliges, seeing no reason not to. As he settles in, Persephone produces a long stemmed lily and reaches over to place it around his neck. He tries to shrug it off but somehow it is seemingly adamant on clinging to him. \"People are afraid of you,\" she says, more a statement than a question, as she leans forward to brush stray blades of grass off his shoulders. \"I'd imagine so, seeing as how I'm the ruler of the underworld,\" he says dryly, sitting absolutely still as her hands adjust the lily before moving to straighten out his robes as well. Her hands brush against his neck. They are warm. She pauses, taking a moment to look at him. \"I've heard a lot of different stories about you.\" Ah yes. Judging by the reactions of the souls who see him in the underworld, the rumors about him are as plentiful as ever. He still receives sacrifices from those who seem to think he'll go around killing people they don't like for a sheep or two. Even his popularity among the gods is divisive, though he's quite sure it's skewed toward the negative. \"You don't believe the stories.\" Persephone shrugs. \"You're never around to set the record straight.\" Hades lets out a sardonic laugh to cover his surprise. \"Fairness, now that's something you don't see every day in a god.\" \"Well, you are different from what they say,\" she says. She doesn't sound surprised. \"You're not scary or cruel. Maybe a little gloomy and reserved, but certainly not morbid.\" A compliment, or something like it. He's never really received one of those. He doesn't quite know what to do with it. Thankfully, Persephone continues. \"Besides, it's not like you kill people.\" She frowns, more out of annoyance than sadness on his behalf. He quirks a grin. \"Not many people make that distinction.\" Persephone cocks her head, her hair tumbling down her shoulders. \"Doesn't it make you feel lonely?\" She asks suddenly, sounding genuinely curious. \"Being down there by yourself.\" There it is again. Loneliness. \"I don't have time to feel lonely,\" he replies flatly, mildly annoyed. \"I'm often busy doing my duties, which you're currently keeping me from.\" She smiles despite his grim expression. \"I'm sure everyone would be happy to hear that their punishment is postponed while you're away.\" Again, he can't really argue with that. For a while, they look at each other, Persephone watching his every move with keen interest, Hades looking back at her carefully. He has never been one to ask questions, but for the first time in a long time, he finds himself curious. \"Do you feel lonely?\" Persephone blinks, her smile faltering. For a moment, she loses a bit of her youthful exuberance, her expression suddenly a little pensive. \"I have people who rely on me,\" she answers, almost uncertainly. \"I have my plants and my fields to tend to.\" She brightens with a stilted laugh. \"I don't have the time to feel lonely either. I guess we're a little of the same.\" Maybe, he thinks. Her fingers are still curled around the edges of his robes, like she's afraid he's going to leave. - There's something about all this nature that's making him feel compliant and relaxed. He can say with absolute certainty that the lily around his neck is sentient. It would be alarming if he still had the capacity to feel panic. Hades thinks Persephone is trying to improve his mood by changing the flowers that grow around him each day. \"Could you at least give me some deathbells?\" He grunts, glaring at the cheerful daisies and lilacs sprouting around him today. \"Hydrangeas, oleander. I'll even take marigolds.\" Persephone meets his withering glare with a cheeky grin and pointedly waters all the flowers around him. They seem to grow and multiply almost immediately. His ever stalwart lily tickles his cheek, like it's teasing him. No, not trying to improve his mood, he thinks as she laughs and laughs, presumably at the displeased look that is undoubtedly on his face. This is all entertainment for her. And people call him cruel. He figures someone will come for him eventually. Hopefully. - For the most part, he is left to his own devices when she goes away to fulfill her duties, not without leaving him with a basket of fruits and vegetables and these oddly lively flowers as his companions. He wouldn't mind them so much if they didn't look like they were mocking him as they swayed in the breeze. But she is not usually gone for long, though it appears that she rushes through her duties to keep him from being alone for too long, often bursting through the wall, breathless like she ran the whole way back. \"So what's it like in the underworld?\" Hades looks up to see that Persephone has returned from a day's work in the fields, stalks of wheat and bits of hay still sticking out of her long hair, and without missing a beat, gone straight into a conversation. His horses stir upon seeing her and barely a few seconds later, bushels of hay appear before them. He feels like he should tell her to stop spoiling them but she probably wouldn't listen anyway. \"It is what it is,\" he replies as he watches Persephone try to shake everything out of her hair like a dog shaking water out of its coat. \"People tend to think that it is all darkness and suffering, but the underworld has its own sort of diversity.\" Persephone plops down on the edge of his chariot, her hair in complete disarray as she huffs and picks the bits out of her hair by hand. \"I've always wanted to go.\" \"Hmph, you may be the first god to say that.\" \"You don't like it there?\" He shrugs. \"It's better for me to be there than anyone else, as far as managing the underworld, I figure. Humankind may be fallible by nature, but I see no point in condemning all of them to eternal suffering for it, though most humans tend to think I do. Other gods probably would not see it that way.\" Persephone glances up at Hades, a small smile on her lips. \"Could you imagine Hera being put in charge of the underworld?\" \"She would send everyone to Tartarus,\" he mutters, scowling at the mere thought. He's already annoyed enough with receiving an ever-growing list of names and descriptions of punishments from Hera on an alarmingly frequent basis. \"It would be chaos. And she would be the one to send them to the underworld in the first place.\" Persephone snorts before erupting in a fit of giggles. \"Well, I hope I get to see this nice orderly underworld before something terrible happens to it,\" she says, smiling faintly, before falling silent, her fingers absently running through her hair over and over. He thinks of her and her plants, how she coaxes flowers out of the ground and greets them with a smile, how fruits and vegetables are sweeter and more plentiful when grown in her fields. He thinks of her curiosity and wonders what would grow beneath her feet if she could go to the underworld. \"You would like it there,\" he agrees, holding his hand out to a growing bunch of tulips. One rises to meet him, fitting in his palm. \"Do you miss it?\" Hades blinks before turning to look at her. Persephone is looking away from him, her hands sitting in her lap even though she still has wheat and hay in her hair. \"Do you miss the underworld?\" It has been a month since he has been away. The underworld is his home and he has ruled over it for nearly his entire existence but he doesn't miss it in the way he thinks she means. \"I am needed there, just as the underworld is needed for the rest of the world,\" he answers carefully. \"If you could,\" her voice is quiet, \"would you leave it?\" Her hair hides her face but he has spent enough time around souls to learn empathy. He moves to stand beside her, reaching out to carefully extract the remaining bits of hay and wheat from her hair. Her hair is impossibly soft. \"I suppose I am a necessary evil, just as you are a necessary good,\" he says, his fingers brushing against her warm cheek. \"My place is in the underworld, whether I like it or not, and yours is here.\" Persephone is silent for a long while, her hands clasped in her lap. Hades looks at her curiously. It's unusual for her to be so quiet. After a few passing seconds, she leans into his hand, sighing as if in defeat. \"I know.\" He thinks about his domain, the underworld where he helps every soul that passes to get to where they belong, where he makes sure that everything is in order, that the rules are followed, that the dead remain dead and the living stay out. He thinks about Persephone and hers, this plot of land where she grows foods for the people who rely on her, where she helps them not only survive but thrive, where she lies among her flowers. He thinks about necessity. He thinks about empathy. He thinks about loneliness. - Persephone tells him about her flowers and he tells her about the underworld. She tells him how they grow, what they do, how to speak with them. He tells her about the rivers and the fields (she finds them fascinating and wonders about what can grow there), about Charon and Cerberus (she is determined to meet them), about the meddling people who like to try to break the rules and take things from the underworld (she smiles at that). She is an attentive listener for someone who is so lively and energetic. He finds that he enjoys her company, even though sometimes he ends up with overzealous crocuses prodding at his face or covered with ivy. It is Hermes who arrives, two months into his imprisonment, probably tipped off by Charon about his disappearance. He makes his entrance by stumbling through the flower walls of Hades's prison, lemon blossoms and heather clinging to him, before stopping short upon seeing Persephone making flower crowns and Hades with one already on his head. \"Uh, Hades, I -,\" Hermes manages weakly after a minute of deep confusion, struggling to find the right words. \"Charon said - w-what's going on here?\" \"Persephone has imprisoned me here,\" Hades explains simply as Persephone adjusts the crown of clovers and daffodils on his head. \"I cannot escape and she will not let me go.\" Hermes seems to be at a loss. Understandable, seeing as how this field of flowers hardly looks like a prison. The jailer of said prison pays him no heed. Truthfully, Hades finds it very amusing. \"P-Persephone,\" Hermes stammers, half-baffled, half-amazed, \"you can't just capture Hades and keep him here.\" She raises an eyebrow at him, unimpressed. \"I can and I did. What are you going to do about it?\" Hades feels an unnatural warmth in his chest as Hermes fumbles with his words a little while longer, his eyes darting between the two of them, before scampering off, muttering something about consulting Zeus. When the rustling fades away, Persephone turns to look at Hades, before bursting into laughter, wiping tears from her eyes as she gasps, \"Did you - oh Hades, did you see his face?\" He smiles to himself as she regains her bearings, shaking her head with a huff of laughter before returning to her work. Persephone. She's different, he decides. Before she finishes off the crown, he hands her a gardenia. Her cheeks are bright red as she weaves it in. - \"I know that this isn't going to last forever,\" Persephone says without bitterness, lying on her back and basking in the afternoon sunlight, her hair fanned out around her. Hades looks at her from where he's taking shelter under the shade of an apple tree Persephone grew for him. \"It's unlike you to sound so pessimistic,\" Hades notes wryly. Persephone turns her head toward him, wrinkling her nose. \"I guess you're rubbing off on me.\" She sighs, holding up her hand to see the sunlight filtered through her fingers, before her lips curve in a small smile. \"You're probably going to feel lonely when you go back.\" Hades watches her. \"Do you feel lonely?\" He asks again, this time, an odd ache arising from his chest. And this time, she does not smile. \"Not since you came here,\" she finally admits quietly, her eyes fluttering closed. Persephone has taken to sleeping in his prison, now that she is sure he will be taken away soon. He doesn't do anything except sit beside her, maybe out of habit, maybe to protect her, maybe just to look at her. He never felt lonely but that doesn't mean he wasn't. Because of Persephone, he has become aware of his solitude, of his detachment, his passivity. And because of Persephone, he does not feel those things anymore. She has made him weak. This is what he would have said, months ago, before he was captured. He never understood humans and their reckless emotions and that made it easy for him to judge them in the scope of the world. A murder was a murder, even if it was done out of love. But now, he looks at her and he thinks he understands, how men and women could come before him, pale and shaking with fear, and ask in their weak voices for the chance to take back their loved ones, how men and women could come before him with blood on their hands and a love in their hearts and hope for a second chance, how men and women could come before him, having lived happy and fulfilling lives, and still ask for another lifetime. - Zeus comes for him, three months after his capture. This time, seeing Zeus is doubly unpleasant. \"Hades,\" Zeus greets, grinning at the sight of Hades surrounded by so many flowers. \"Doing well, I hope?\" Hades does not grace him with an answer, though it does little to diminish Zeus's naturally easygoing mood. \"I've been informed that you've been,\" he glances at Persephone, which startles her, \"captured.\" Hades nods. \"You'll have to negotiate for my release.\" Beside him, Persephone is gripping the mane of one of his horses tightly. Her fear is understandable; it is not every day Zeus himself makes an appearance to resolve a conflict. \"Well, that won't do.\" Zeus addresses Persephone with a stern gaze. Hades hates to admit it, but Zeus isn't the fool he always thinks he is. Philanderer or not, he is the god of the gods, the one with most all the authority and power, and can strike fear into the hearts of humans and gods alike. \"While capturing the god of the underworld is quite a feat, it is not something easily forgiven, Persephone. If you don't wish to be punished, it is best that you let him go now.\" Hades can feel her shaking beside him. Even her flowers shrink with her in anxiety. Submit, he thinks, closing his eyes. There is nothing - \"No.\" There is a brief silence before Zeus realizes what she's said. \"No?\" Zeus repeats incredulously. Hades blinks before turning to look at Persephone. She makes no effort to hide her fear, knowing that her power is nothing against Zeus, and yet even as it trembles, her chin is raised high. Her gaze is desperate, but steady. How many times has he seen that very same expression on a human, he thinks idly. \"Not without getting something in return.\" Zeus exchanges a look with Hades, intrigued. \"And what is it that you want?\" Persephone straightens, squaring her shoulders, and meets Zeus's eyes. \"I want to go to the underworld,\" her hands clench into fists, \"with Hades.\" Both Zeus and Hades stare at her before looking back at each other. Zeus looks like he wants to congratulate Hades; Hades just desperately wants him to go away. \"Well,\" Zeus clears his throat, scratching his head, suddenly looking less like a fearsome god and more like a bashful idiot, \"as much as I would like to grant you permission, Demeter wouldn't allow it, as you well know, and it certainly wouldn't be good if she were unhappy, as you also well know. People rely on her to survive, Persephone. And you're -\" \"A necessary good,\" she snaps, her voice stronger now. \"And you need Hades back in the underworld just as much as I'm needed here.\" Using his words against his brother. It's a beautiful thing. \"Isn't there any way you could let me leave?\" She beseeches. Zeus gives her a sympathetic look. \"Maybe I could reason with Demeter,\" Persephone brightens, \"but only if you let Hades go, for now.\" His voice softens. \"He's needed back in the underworld, now more than ever, at least until everything is sorted out again.\" Persephone deflates with a frown, falling silent. Hades glances down at her, wondering if he should try to comfort her. Zeus turns to Hades. \"I'll leave you to uh, 'say your goodbyes' -\" Hades glares darkly. \"Get out.\" Thankfully, Zeus complies without another word, pricking himself on several rose bushes on his way out. Sighing, Hades turns to Persephone, who's petting his horses one last time as she secures them to the chariot before turning back to him. She tugs at her robe, smiling sadly. \"I guess I really have to let you leave now.\" He raises an eyebrow. \"No more clever tricks up your sleeve?\" Persephone manages a quiet laugh. \"Not this time, unfortunately.\" The lily around his neck droops. He carefully pulls it off, holds it in his hand and tucks it away in his robe before climbing onto his chariot. His horses neigh sadly, hitting the ground with their hooves anxiously. Persephone looks up at him, her eyes bright. Her flowers grow and grow but they cannot reach him. He sighs, his hands holding the reins loosely, overwhelmed with a feeling of emptiness and immensely annoyed with it. Of course, it would be her, fair and clever Persephone with her innocent eyes and sharp smiles and incessant flower growing, who did the impossible and captured the lord of the underworld. Of course it would be her who would make him smile, feel and even do anything at all. Hades reaches down and touches her cheek. It can't be helped. \"Well, lucky for you,\" he says, tucking her hair behind her ear, \"it turns out I have a few of my own.\" With that, he rides away, leaving a carnation behind Persephone's ear and six bright red pomegranate seeds in her palm. - It goes without saying that Hades gets a visit from a frantic Hermes soon after returning to the underworld. He is called to meet with the gods to discuss the mess he made by giving Persephone those pomegranate seeds. Demeter is utterly furious at him but because he doesn't show up, Zeus is on the receiving end of her abuse, which is a win in Hades's book. But ultimately, Zeus concedes and tells Demeter that Persephone will only reside in the underworld for three months of every year, just as how Hades was imprisoned for three months by her. She agrees but she still does her part as the world's most destructively disapproving mother, leaving the earth barren for the duration of Persephone's stay. Thankfully, Persephone makes sure to help people make it through Demeter's tantrum with plentiful harvests when she is home. \"So you did go and find yourself a consort,\" Charon says as he and Hades watch Persephone play with Cerberus, who wags his tail and bows his three heads to happily greet her. Hades watches Persephone laugh, loud and carefree, with nightshade and snowdrops poking cautiously up from the barren ground around her feet. \"No,\" he says with a faint smile, as the lily she gave him blooms to life again, \"I think I went and became hers.\"",

      "He has never been one to ask questions, but for the first time in a long time, he finds himself curious.",
      "\"Do you feel lonely?\" Persephone blinks, her smile faltering.",
      "For a moment, she loses a bit of her youthful exuberance, her expression suddenly a little pensive.",
      "\"I have people who rely on me,\" she answers, almost uncertainly.",
      "\"I have my plants and my fields to tend to.\"",
      "She brightens with a stilted laugh.",
      "\"I don't have the time to feel lonely either.",
      "I guess we're a little of the same.\"",
      "Maybe, he thinks.",
      "Her fingers are still curled around the edges of his robes, like she's afraid he's going to leave.",
      "- There's something about all this nature that's making him feel compliant and relaxed.",
      "He can say with absolute certainty that the lily around his neck is sentient.",
      "It would be alarming if he still had the capacity to feel panic.",
      "Hades thinks Persephone is trying to improve his mood by changing the flowers that grow around him each day.",
      "\"Could you at least give me some deathbells?\"",
      "He grunts, glaring at the cheerful daisies and lilacs sprouting around him today.",
      "\"Hydrangeas, oleander.",
      "I'll even take marigolds.\"",
      "Persephone meets his withering glare with a cheeky grin and pointedly waters all the flowers around him.",
      "They seem to grow and multiply almost immediately.",
      "His ever stalwart lily tickles his cheek, like it's teasing him.",
      "No, not trying to improve his mood, he thinks as she laughs and laughs, presumably at the displeased look that is undoubtedly on his face.",
      "This is all entertainment for her.",
      "And people call him cruel.",
      "He figures someone will come for him eventually.",
      "Hopefully.",
      "- For the most part, he is left to his own devices when she goes away to fulfill her duties, not without leaving him with a basket of fruits and vegetables and these oddly lively flowers as his companions.",
      "He wouldn't mind them so much if they didn't look like they were mocking him as they swayed in the breeze.",
      "But she is not usually gone for long, though it appears that she rushes through her duties to keep him from being alone for too long, often bursting through the wall, breathless like she ran the whole way back.",
      "\"So what's it like in the underworld?\" Hades looks up to see that Persephone has returned from a day's work in the fields, stalks of wheat and bits of hay still sticking out of her long hair, and without missing a beat, gone straight into a conversation.",
      "His horses stir upon seeing her and barely a few seconds later, bushels of hay appear before them.",
      "He feels like he should tell her to stop spoiling them but she probably wouldn't listen anyway.",
      "\"It is what it is,\" he replies as he watches Persephone try to shake everything out of her hair like a dog shaking water out of its coat.",
      "\"People tend to think that it is all darkness and suffering, but the underworld has its own sort of diversity.\"",
      "Persephone plops down on the edge of his chariot, her hair in complete disarray as she huffs and picks the bits out of her hair by hand.",
      "\"I've always wanted to go.\"",
      "\"Hmph, you may be the first god to say that.\"",
      "\"You don't like it there?\"",
      "He shrugs.",
      "\"It's better for me to be there than anyone else, as far as managing the underworld, I figure.",
      "Humankind may be fallible by nature, but I see no point in condemning all of them to eternal suffering for it, though most humans tend to think I do.",
      "Other gods probably would not see it that way.\"",
      "Persephone glances up at Hades, a small smile on her lips.",
      "\"Could you imagine Hera being put in charge of the underworld?\"",
      "\"She would send everyone to Tartarus,\" he mutters, scowling at the mere thought.",
      "He's already annoyed enough with receiving an ever-growing list of names and descriptions of punishments from Hera on an alarmingly frequent basis.",
      "\"It would be chaos.",
      "And she would be the one to send them to the underworld in the first place.\"",
      "Persephone snorts before erupting in a fit of giggles.",
      "\"Well, I hope I get to see this nice orderly underworld before something terrible happens to it,\" she says, smiling faintly, before falling silent, her fingers absently running through her hair over and over.",
      "He thinks of her and her plants, how she coaxes flowers out of the ground and greets them with a smile, how fruits and vegetables are sweeter and more plentiful when grown in her fields.",
      "He thinks of her curiosity and wonders what would grow beneath her feet if she could go to the underworld.",
      "\"You would like it there,\" he agrees, holding his hand out to a growing bunch of tulips.",
      "One rises to meet him, fitting in his palm.",
      "\"Do you miss it?\" Hades blinks before turning to look at her.",
      "Persephone is looking away from him, her hands sitting in her lap even though she still has wheat and hay in her hair.",
      "\"Do you miss the underworld?\"",
      "It has been a month since he has been away.",
      "The underworld is his home and he has ruled over it for nearly his entire existence but he doesn't miss it in the way he thinks she means.",
      "\"I am needed there, just as the underworld is needed for the rest of the world,\" he answers carefully.",
      "\"If you could,\" her voice is quiet, \"would you leave it?\" Her hair hides her face but he has spent enough time around souls to learn empathy.",
      "He moves to stand beside her, reaching out to carefully extract the remaining bits of hay and wheat from her hair.",
      "Her hair is impossibly soft.",
      "\"I suppose I am a necessary evil, just as you are a necessary good,\" he says, his fingers brushing against her warm cheek.",
      "\"My place is in the underworld, whether I like it or not, and yours is here.\"",
      "Persephone is silent for a long while, her hands clasped in her lap.",
      "Hades looks at her curiously.",
      "It's unusual for her to be so quiet.",
      "After a few passing seconds, she leans into his hand, sighing as if in defeat.",
      "\"I know.\"",
      "He thinks about his domain, the underworld where he helps every soul that passes to get to where they belong, where he makes sure that everything is in order, that the rules are followed, that the dead remain dead and the living stay out.",
      "He thinks about Persephone and hers, this plot of land where she grows foods for the people who rely on her, where she helps them not only survive but thrive, where she lies among her flowers.",
      "He thinks about necessity.",
      "He thinks about empathy.",
      "He thinks about loneliness.",
      "- Persephone tells him about her flowers and he tells her about the underworld.",
      "She tells him how they grow, what they do, how to speak with them.",
      "He tells her about the rivers and the fields (she finds them fascinating and wonders about what can grow there), about Charon and Cerberus (she is determined to meet them), about the meddling people who like to try to break the rules and take things from the underworld (she smiles at that).",
      "She is an attentive listener for someone who is so lively and energetic.",
      "He finds that he enjoys her company, even though sometimes he ends up with overzealous crocuses prodding at his face or covered with ivy.",
      "It is Hermes who arrives, two months into his imprisonment, probably tipped off by Charon about his disappearance.",
      "He makes his entrance by stumbling through the flower walls of Hades's prison, lemon blossoms and heather clinging to him, before stopping short upon seeing Persephone making flower crowns and Hades with one already on his head.",
      "\"Uh, Hades, I -,\" Hermes manages weakly after a minute of deep confusion, struggling to find the right words.",
      "\"Charon said - w-what's going on here?\"",
      "\"Persephone has imprisoned me here,\" Hades explains simply as Persephone adjusts the crown of clovers and daffodils on his head.",
      "\"I cannot escape and she will not let me go.\"",
      "Hermes seems to be at a loss.",
      "Understandable, seeing as how this field of flowers hardly looks like a prison.",
      "The jailer of said prison pays him no heed.",
      "Truthfully, Hades finds it very amusing.",
      "\"P-Persephone,\" Hermes stammers, half-baffled, half-amazed, \"you can't just capture Hades and keep him here.\"",
      "She raises an eyebrow at him, unimpressed.",
      "\"I can and I did.",
      "What are you going to do about it?\" Hades feels an unnatural warmth in his chest as Hermes fumbles with his words a little while longer, his eyes darting between the two of them, before scampering off, muttering something about consulting Zeus.",
      "When the rustling fades away, Persephone turns to look at Hades, before bursting into laughter, wiping tears from her eyes as she gasps, \"Did you - oh Hades, did you see his face?\"",
      "He smiles to himself as she regains her bearings, shaking her head with a huff of laughter before returning to her work.",
      "Persephone.",
      "She's different, he decides.",
      "Before she finishes off the crown, he hands her a gardenia.",
      "Her cheeks are bright red as she weaves it in.",
      "- \"I know that this isn't going to last forever,\" Persephone says without bitterness, lying on her back and basking in the afternoon sunlight, her hair fanned out around her.",
      "Hades looks at her from where he's taking shelter under the shade of an apple tree Persephone grew for him.",
      "\"It's unlike you to sound so pessimistic,\" Hades notes wryly.",
      "Persephone turns her head toward him, wrinkling her nose.",
      "\"I guess you're rubbing off on me.\"",
      "She sighs, holding up her hand to see the sunlight filtered through her fingers, before her lips curve in a small smile.",
      "\"You're probably going to feel lonely when you go back.\"",
      "Hades watches her.",
      "\"Do you feel lonely?\"",
      "He asks again, this time, an odd ache arising from his chest.",
      "And this time, she does not smile.",
      "\"Not since you came here,\" she finally admits quietly, her eyes fluttering closed.",
      "Persephone has taken to sleeping in his prison, now that she is sure he will be taken away soon.",
      "He doesn't do anything except sit beside her, maybe out of habit, maybe to protect her, maybe just to look at her.",
      "He never felt lonely but that doesn't mean he wasn't.",
      "Because of Persephone, he has become aware of his solitude, of his detachment, his passivity.",
      "And because of Persephone, he does not feel those things anymore.",
      "She has made him weak.",
      "This is what he would have said, months ago, before he was captured.",
      "He never understood humans and their reckless emotions and that made it easy for him to judge them in the scope of the world.",
      "A murder was a murder, even if it was done out of love.",
      "But now, he looks at her and he thinks he understands, how men and women could come before him, pale and shaking with fear, and ask in their weak voices for the chance to take back their loved ones, how men and women could come before him with blood on their hands and a love in their hearts and hope for a second chance, how men and women could come before him, having lived happy and fulfilling lives, and still ask for another lifetime.",
      "- Zeus comes for him, three months after his capture.",
      "This time, seeing Zeus is doubly unpleasant.",
      "\"Hades,\" Zeus greets, grinning at the sight of Hades surrounded by so many flowers.",
      "\"Doing well, I hope?\" Hades does not grace him with an answer, though it does little to diminish Zeus's naturally easygoing mood.",
      "\"I've been informed that you've been,\" he glances at Persephone, which startles her, \"captured.\"",
      "Hades nods.",
      "\"You'll have to negotiate for my release.\"",
      "Beside him, Persephone is gripping the mane of one of his horses tightly.",
      "Her fear is understandable; it is not every day Zeus himself makes an appearance to resolve a conflict.",
      "\"Well, that won't do.\"",
      "Zeus addresses Persephone with a stern gaze.",
      "Hades hates to admit it, but Zeus isn't the fool he always thinks he is.",
      "Philanderer or not, he is the god of the gods, the one with most all the authority and power, and can strike fear into the hearts of humans and gods alike.",
      "\"While capturing the god of the underworld is quite a feat, it is not something easily forgiven, Persephone.",
      "If you don't wish to be punished, it is best that you let him go now.\"",
      "Hades can feel her shaking beside him.",
      "Even her flowers shrink with her in anxiety.",
      "Submit, he thinks, closing his eyes.",
      "There is nothing - \"No.\"",
      "There is a brief silence before Zeus realizes what she's said.",
      "\"No?\" Zeus repeats incredulously.",
      "Hades blinks before turning to look at Persephone.",
      "She makes no effort to hide her fear, knowing that her power is nothing against Zeus, and yet even as it trembles, her chin is raised high.",
      "Her gaze is desperate, but steady.",
      "How many times has he seen that very same expression on a human, he thinks idly.",
      "\"Not without getting something in return.\"",
      "Zeus exchanges a look with Hades, intrigued.",
      "\"And what is it that you want?\" Persephone straightens, squaring her shoulders, and meets Zeus's eyes.",
      "\"I want to go to the underworld,\" her hands clench into fists, \"with Hades.\"",
      "Both Zeus and Hades stare at her before looking back at each other.",
      "Zeus looks like he wants to congratulate Hades; Hades just desperately wants him to go away.",
      "\"Well,\" Zeus clears his throat, scratching his head, suddenly looking less like a fearsome god and more like a bashful idiot, \"as much as I would like to grant you permission, Demeter wouldn't allow it, as you well know, and it certainly wouldn't be good if she were unhappy, as you also well know.",
      "People rely on her to survive, Persephone.",
      "And you're -\" \"A necessary good,\" she snaps, her voice stronger now.",
      "\"And you need Hades back in the underworld just as much as I'm needed here.\"",
      "Using his words against his brother.",
      "It's a beautiful thing.",
      "\"Isn't there any way you could let me leave?\"",
      "She beseeches.",
      "Zeus gives her a sympathetic look.",
      "\"Maybe I could reason with Demeter,\" Persephone brightens, \"but only if you let Hades go, for now.\"",
      "His voice softens.",
      "\"He's needed back in the underworld, now more than ever, at least until everything is sorted out again.\"",
      "Persephone deflates with a frown, falling silent.",
      "Hades glances down at her, wondering if he should try to comfort her.",
      "Zeus turns to Hades.",
      "\"I'll leave you to uh, 'say your goodbyes' -\" Hades glares darkly.",
      "\"Get out.\"",
      "Thankfully, Zeus complies without another word, pricking himself on several rose bushes on his way out.",
      "Sighing, Hades turns to Persephone, who's petting his horses one last time as she secures them to the chariot before turning back to him.",
      "She tugs at her robe, smiling sadly.",
      "\"I guess I really have to let you leave now.\"",
      "He raises an eyebrow.",
      "\"No more clever tricks up your sleeve?\" Persephone manages a quiet laugh.",
      "\"Not this time, unfortunately.\"",
      "The lily around his neck droops.",
      "He carefully pulls it off, holds it in his hand and tucks it away in his robe before climbing onto his chariot.",
      "His horses neigh sadly, hitting the ground with their hooves anxiously.",
      "Persephone looks up at him, her eyes bright.",
      "Her flowers grow and grow but they cannot reach him.",
      "He sighs, his hands holding the reins loosely, overwhelmed with a feeling of emptiness and immensely annoyed with it.",
      "Of course, it would be her, fair and clever Persephone with her innocent eyes and sharp smiles and incessant flower growing, who did the impossible and captured the lord of the underworld.",
      "Of course it would be her who would make him smile, feel and even do anything at all.",
      "Hades reaches down and touches her cheek.",
      "It can't be helped.",
      "\"Well, lucky for you,\" he says, tucking her hair behind her ear, \"it turns out I have a few of my own.\"",
      "With that, he rides away, leaving a carnation behind Persephone's ear and six bright red pomegranate seeds in her palm.",
      "- It goes without saying that Hades gets a visit from a frantic Hermes soon after returning to the underworld.",
      "He is called to meet with the gods to discuss the mess he made by giving Persephone those pomegranate seeds.",
      "Demeter is utterly furious at him but because he doesn't show up, Zeus is on the receiving end of her abuse, which is a win in Hades's book.",
      "But ultimately, Zeus concedes and tells Demeter that Persephone will only reside in the underworld for three months of every year, just as how Hades was imprisoned for three months by her.",
      "She agrees but she still does her part as the world's most destructively disapproving mother, leaving the earth barren for the duration of Persephone's stay.",
      "Thankfully, Persephone makes sure to help people make it through Demeter's tantrum with plentiful harvests when she is home.",
      "\"So you did go and find yourself a consort,\" Charon says as he and Hades watch Persephone play with Cerberus, who wags his tail and bows his three heads to happily greet her.",
      "Hades watches Persephone laugh, loud and carefree, with nightshade and snowdrops poking cautiously up from the barren ground around her feet.",
      "\"No,\" he says with a faint smile, as the lily she gave him blooms to life again, \"I think I went and became hers.\""

    "text": "Parched. That was the word Eris had been searching for as her tongue pushed against the cold, metal restraint magically sealed to the lower half of her face. Her eyes squeezed shut as she tried to block out the sensation as it only made her feel weak. She'd been without the sustenance of discord and strife for so very long that she could now feel the swell of her belly as though it were aching with hunger and a dryness in her throat akin to thirst. The ambrosia that deigned her immortality left her alive but weak since she was not allowed to practice her craft. It was a slow death that she had been relegated to for a near millennia and it was just now, finally, starting to wear her down to nothing. Her prison was a frigid, crystal coffin on that lonely drifting rock known as Pluto. Her restraints kept her arms crossed at her chest while gold chains wrapped themselves down her body to shackles cinched tight around her ankles. The only company she had was the stars and a monthly visit from Nike who would swoop down to see that her bonds were still as secure as the day Hephaestus had molded them to her skin. After an inspection was completed where the two women simply stared at one another Nike would seal the barrier around Eris' coffin that warded off other beings and vanish into that dark sky above in a bolt of resplendent light. Each time she had visited Nike had never expressed any pity for her chained compatriot and if she had Eris would never stoop so low as to beg for release, even as her body fiercely ached every waking moment for the opportunity to manipulate and cloy its way into the heart of another being. She needed the emancipation that only her powers could bring, but until Zeus freed her from her imprisonment the goddess would remain in her solitude as she quietly went mad. It wasn't that the world known as Earth--her toy that she gleefully missed with all its imperfections and easy manipulations--was without discord. It's just that she could not directly feed off the burning, all consuming hatred it created amongst the people from where she was. Barred and bound within a confined sarcophagus prison, all she could do was stare listlessly into the universe from beneath the crystalline wall above her. \"So you can watch time pass, but never be a part of it,\" Zeus had said when they had sealed her inside. He'd then slain her daughters before her as part of her punishment and she had to watch as they burst apart and were absorbed by the countless stars above her. She would whisper her remorse over her children for eons even though she was the only that could hear her cries of mourning. It was as cruel as it was kind to look up at the dark landscape and be reminded of their faces in those dim silver lights above. In her exile on Pluto, after she had finally cried her last tear and was too tired to scream anymore, she had grown used to the inevitable stretches of silence wasted between Nike's visits. She'd counted the stars, the days by the rotation of the dwarf planet, and the time it took between Nike's visits. She'd held debates within herself until sleep was the only thing she could manage anymore. The attempt was to make her solitude seem like sanctuary even under the layers of metal that bit into her olive toned skin and chaffed her body when she made even a small quiver of movement. She was meticulous in her upkeep of time so that when there was the groan and pop of the barrier surrounding her prison breaking before Nike's appointed visit a chord of fear struck through her body. Nike did not deviate from her schedule and no one else knew where she was being imprisoned aside from the Greek pantheon. Perhaps Zeus has decided to kill me after all, she thought as she lolled her head to the side preparing to glare at the Olympian at his return to her eternal prison. Her bitter hatred dissipated into shock though when the tall, lithe form of Loki Odinson walking along the side of her tomb appeared. His horned helmet gleamed under the little visible light from the sun, his cape made just a whisper of a sound as it followed behind him like a green serpent, and he held a golden scepter in his left hand with a blue jewel at the top emanating an ethereal glow. He ran his fingers from the bottom of her crystalline coffin to the top where her face was and paused to look down at her. His blue eyes met her dark obsidian ones in a gleeful manner. \"Eris, you look...uncomfortable.\" He was smirking and Eris' fingers flexed into the air as she squirmed under his azure gaze. She hadn't seen Loki of the Norse Pantheon since long before her own banishment from Olympus and the meeting had not been pleasant. Their games against one another had nearly cost both of them their lives. He was, therefore, an unwelcome presence and anxiety over his renewed interest in her kept Eris vigilant as he circled around her. Her fingers curled around the fabric of her gown in tight fists in a weak attempt to steady herself and stave off the tremors of fear that ran along her body when Loki came to a stop near her face again. \"Close your eyes.\" He ordered as he brought his scepter aloft the case and pressed the tip of it over where her heart lay. Eris' eyes widened as it glowed blue and only just shut them before a loud cracking could be heard as the translucent lid fragmented and fell away from her body. She blinked up in confusion as he stepped back, satisfied with his work. \"I will release you,\" he said when she'd gotten over the apparent shock that he'd kept her alive--for the moment. \"But I require your expertise in a few matters as compensation.\" He moved his scepter over to her mouth and she flinched in pain when the metal heated above her lips before he yanked the now useless binding off her face. She shivered at the sensation of the cold wind touching her overtly sensitive lips. It felt ticklish, but in an unpleasant way as though a thousand needles were pricking her. She waited for Loki to release the rest of her shackles, but he'd set aside his scepter and helped bring her into a sitting position still completely bound. He sat aside her with one hand on her back as he held a flask to her lips. She jumped away from him until his grip on her back tightened in a silent show of dominance. \"Its ambrosia,\" he said sounding impatient with her suspicions of him. \"You'll heal faster with it.\" When she still did not open her mouth, Loki brought the flask up to his own mouth and drank. He made a sarcastic show of the gesture before holding it up to her again. \"If you'd prefer to remain in misery I'll happily leave you now, but if you want to hear my proposal you must drink this.\" Eris did not trust Loki, but as the sweet scent of ambrosia wavered up her nose she found herself relenting to his logic, albeit in a hesitant manner, as her lips parted. As the nectar poured down through her body, warming her to the core, she closed her eyes and hummed in pleasure. It did not ease the entirety of her pains, but it alleviated them for the time being and for that, she was grateful. When she had emptied the flask, Loki tossed it aside and resumed standing while Eris slurped every last drop of the remaining contents around her mouth. She stared up at him as her mind churned with questions that she knew he was patiently waiting for her to speak. \"What is it you require?\" Her voice sounded grated as the chords strained in her throat after having been in disuse for so long. \"Midgard.\" He pointed out to the faint blue orb in the distance. \"I will take it for my own and bring it's populace to their knees.\" \"Ah, so...someone didn't get the throne after all.\" Eris wheezed as she felt herself hacking into a laugh. \"I did not want the throne!\" Loki screamed in her face and she stilled at his trip-wire aggression. His nostrils flared as his breath warmed against her skin in large puffs. \"I never wanted the throne...\" The anger in his eyes churned with madness before returning to their normal, mischievous state. \"I wanted to be equals with my broth--with Thor.\" He let out a grunt as he straightened himself back up to his full height. \"Midgard has no one ruler and I have no home. We are a fate matched for one another.\" \"Why do you need me?\" Eris' and Loki's talents were not dissimilar. It was what had made their first meeting so volatile. Two artful, malicious persuaders pitted against one another never did bode well. \"I know you thirst for the kind of chaos that will befall the human race as they attempt to thwart me,\" he said walking around her coffin again as she strained to keep him in her line of vision. \"You can be the change I need to set their heroes against one another. You're talents could sway the course of victory in my favor.\" \"Yet you alone will reap all the glory?\" She raised an eyebrow at him at his idealized conquest and coughed as the dryness of her throat continued to dissipate under the healing effects of the ambrosia. \"I see no profit in it for me.\" \"The return of your powers is not enough?\" Loki smirked at her. \"I know you cannot even swat away an insect on your skin right now let alone topple the empires of Midgard as you did of old.\" \"I will have none of that if you control the entire population.\" Her gaze narrowed. \"Your stranglehold on them will douse my needs as easily as they will swell in the initial foray.\" She leaned forward even as the chains bit into her skin. \"I. Need. More.\" Loki cocked his head to the side as his smile grew wider. \"Family is a funny thing,\" he said with his gaze locked on hers. \"A pressure point whether for the good or bad.\" He stood still and looked up at the stars above them. \"Did Zeus slay your daughters before you?\" Eris took in a shuddering breath and sat up straighter, refusing to answer as the horrified faces of Dysmonia and Atio being struck through their hearts by Zeus' thunder bolts replayed again in her mind. The scorching lightning had shredded through their bodies like paper until there was nothing left of them except dust. \"I have an army at my disposal.\" Loki continued on. \"A fraction of which I'd be happy to send with you in a war against your pantheon if that is what you crave. They've left you to die out here...rot as it were for what was it, the Trojan War?\" He was smirking with mirth that stretched his pale, drawn face in an ugly manner. \"Do you crave retribution for your daughters, Eris?\" \"I crave Zeus' head on a platter!\" She seethed struggling against her bonds as the anger that had been locked away poured out of her as she found herself closer to freedom. The stopper she had placed on her emotions breaking like a dam in her body. \"He put a permanent death to my children! Ones who he had welcomed when their purposes suited his own quarrels and then scattered them like grains of sand amongst the stars so their tendrils of power could remain adrift in the universe.\" Eris looked up at the sky and felt only sadness at the sight of the winking silver specks above. She's failed them by playing a game that divided the Olympians as well as the mortals and never stopped to think for a second that they would have to pay for her crimes. She'd give anything now to take back her actions if it meant her daughters could be returned to her once again. \"Then you'll have it,\" Loki said in a whisper bringing her back to the present. \"And the mortals will bow to you as the goddess you truly are. All of that power flowing through your veins again...\" He brushed back a stray hand of her coal colored hair and the goddess willed herself not to flinch as she looked deep into his eyes to find deceit in his proposal. She found none. Only a reflection of her desires melded into his. The same thirst for more, the need to break bonds, to shatter these pathetic mortals to their very core, and to make this world-this universe-into one where they were no longer portrayed as villains but glorified as conquerors. They could be their own heroes by rewriting the story. For the need to be feared, if not adored, was the most tempting desire of all for two of the most despised beings in the entire universe. \"Release me.\" Her hoarse voice came out in a whisper. \"And I will help you plunge this world into darkness.\" Loki smirked as he backed away from her and held out his scepter to her restraints. The metal heated, burning her skin as his own magic broke through Hephaestus' and she strained to keep her mouth shut as harpy like screeches of pain threatened to spill from her lips. She focused on the thought of how her daughters' agonizing deaths had been far worse than what she was suffering to keep her from crying out as the dueling powers rippled across her body. Hephaestus' magic was unyielding in its strength, but Loki's was savage in its intent and in a burst of blue light the metal shattered like glass all the way down her body. Eris let out a cry of relief as she slowly stretched her aching limbs. I'm free, she thought feeling dizzy with the idea that this was not a dream but her waking reality. She brought her arms out before her and then drew them back towards her chest again when she noticed dark runes crossing her body where Loki's and Hephaestus' magic had burned for supremacy. She ran her fingers over the raised scars in fascination until Loki crouched before her. \"Allow me,\" He said setting aside his scepter and resting his hands upon her arms. She shivered as a chilling sensation radiated from his hands and swept over her whole body. It lasted for a mere moment in time and yet Eris felt like she had walked through the cold halls of the underworld itself when he stepped away from her. She looked down at her skin and was unsurprised to see that it had faded to its original unblemished sheen under his care. \"Come, we have much to do.\" He extended one of his hands towards her and curled his fingers around hers in a vice grip when she had accepted his invitation. It was in that moment that Eris felt a sense peace because misery loves company and there were no two souls in all of creation that held as much wretchedness in their bodies as the Goddess of Discord and the God of Lies.",

    "text": "\"Before the Eyes of Storytelling Girls\" by karrenia_rune He called her little sister even though they were not actually related by blood, and at first, it warmed her inside and out because it was an affectionate bond, a secret that they shared just between the two of them, without any oversight or expectations of favors given or received. She, in turn, thought of him as the older brother that she had never had. As a children, even though he was several times over her elder, it was a game, of sharing and laughter, and of him coaxing a shy and timid gangly young girl up onto the wall and sharing a basket of grapes and watered wine and other delicacies, along with stories of the court, some accurate, some bawdy, some that made her blush and others that drove her to tears of merriment. He had a nimble mind, a quick wit and sometimes acerbic tongue. She could still recall the one time they had been doing just that, sitting on the wall, sharing a clump of ripe purple grapes, the sky to the west darkening to the first mantling of evening, when Aeneas remarked, \"How fitting it is that your eyes just now match the color of the sky.\" Cassandra popped the last grape into her mouth and then reached for the white linen napkin that she had left folded in her lap before she replied, holding back an unlady-like belch before she replied. \"Flattery, brother, but spoken so well.\" \"I have to practice, Gods know, and it is true, you do have beautiful eyes.\" She began to laugh, but suddenly began to choke. Aeneas, becoming concerned for her, picked her up bodily and quickly clambered down from their perch, carrying her down the wall, and set her down a bench built into the base of the wall. The coughing fit soon came to an end, but her eyes did not focus on his face or on their surroundings, instead, they had rolled back until only the whites showed and it was as if her mind had ranged far afield, without taking her body along for the ride. Instead she saw the plain just outside the great hill where the city of Troy stood perched, it was dawn instead of night, and ranged far above it was the Sun God, straddling the plain with a broad smile on his face, beckoning to her. She had always known that the gods were so much more than any mere mortal, but she had never expected this.\"Come, little one, you are beautiful, and soon you will be mine.\" Cassandra shivered from head to toe, but since this was a kind of waking dream, she certainly should not have had a body to feel, except that in the silence of her mind, this vision, this dream or whatever it was, she felt simultaneously terrified and fascinated. The Sun God smiled and beckoned once more, and then the dream-vision came to an abrupt end. \"What happened? Little sister, talk to me!\" In all the years that they had known each other, he had never seen her like this, and if truth be told, it frightened him a little bit. Swords and shields, men on foot and on horseback, knifes, and maces he understood and knew how to fight; but this, this was unknown territory. Cassandra blinked and gasped, sitting up; the shivering and the apprehension that she had only felt on the edge of her own awareness suddenly much acuter now that she was back in her own body. \"Oh, Aeneas, I cannot begin to explain, not to you, not to anyone; not now.\" \"Is there anything I can do for you?\" \"Yes,\" she whispered, looking up into his face, studying its every line and angle, and then implored, \"Just hold me.\" He did so wondering what had happened, and if it might happen again. ** When she had grown out of her first maiden-hood it became apparent that she would be called to the Sun God such interludes soon became few and far between, but Aeneas still referred to her as his 'little sister. That initial episode was soon closely followed on the heels of others, some close together, some few and far between, but always they would come, and soon, it became apparent that she was marked as Apollo's own. And when she was a maiden and a girl no longer she was sent to the Temple of the Sun, and her life as she had known it, changed forever. Meanwhile Aeneas' duties to the House of Priam and the city of Troy kept his visits longer but few and far between, and still she cherished them as she would treasure a rare and splendid jewel. When she thought that the gift of foreseeing that what, where and when was more a curse than a blessing, it was something solid to which to cling in a world of shadows and incense and the close confines of the Temple of the Sun God. Over the years, when she was no longer a girl but a young woman, of long-lashes and wheat-golden hair that had rarely been cut and allowed brushed and combed until it much resembled a wheat field rippling in the wind. Cassandra believed that she had reconciled herself to her new lot, but every so often she would indulge herself in small acts of defiance. Establishing a kind of communication between herself and her best friend, and in that, she would take comfort. If the other keepers of the Temple discovered her secret communiques they either did not notice and even if they did chose to take a blind eye to it. If the God felt that it was in defiance of His Will, who was she to care? ** \"A prophetess took my hand and swore to me that we'd be true to each other, and I turn took that for truth, but now we see through as through a glass darkly, and while we are now far apart in body, we are still close in spirit. If you believe me insane to believe that, know this for a truth separate and apart from the bonds of flesh and blood; a girl of grace and beauty made that oath with me, and I shall not betray that oath.\" \"And you believe that, so strongly, do you?\" asked Hector. \"I do,\" replied Aeneas. \"Then, there is nothing more to be said about it, \" replied Hector, tapping his fingers against the polished bronze shiled that hung on the wall of his chambers, silent for a moment, before he turned back to regard his visitor once more, and then added softly, but not unkindly, \" I fear that a time may come when you will be forced to choose between what it was you want and the love and loyalty your bear our dear Cassandra.\" \"Hmmph, mayhap you may be correct in that assessment, but it does make me wonder if the gift of prophecy runs in the blood of the House Of Troy.\" \"Carfeul, man, that nimble mind and quick tongue of yours may be much admired in the councils but it could just as easily cause offense, and to your regret.\" Hector replied evenly. He knew himself for a man slow and stern, careful in his thoughts and deeds, but capable of explosive and decisive action when the situation demanded it. And it was for that very reason that he now cautioned this new ally of his beloved city to temperance where his sister was concerned. It was not as if he believed that Aeneas harbored any improper or impure thoughts towards the gril, oh, no, not noble, tall, dark and handsome Aeneas, but all the same, caution was necessary. \"Is that a threat?\" Aeneas demanded sternly. \"No, merely a friendly warning, \" replied Hector sincerely. \"And I shall take it as such,\" Aeneas replied frostily, with as much of courtesy and respect as he could manage under the circumstances, before turning on his heel and departing the prince's private chambers.",

      "It was not as if he believed that Aeneas harbored any improper or impure thoughts towards the gril, oh, no, not noble, tall, dark and handsome Aeneas, but all the same, caution was necessary.",
      "\"Is that a threat?\" Aeneas demanded sternly.",
      "\"No, merely a friendly warning, \" replied Hector sincerely.",
      "\"And I shall take it as such,\" Aeneas replied frostily, with as much of courtesy and respect as he could manage under the circumstances, before turning on his heel and departing the prince's private chambers."

    "text": "\"Where are you from?\" Cobb once asked him, in a drunken stupor a lifetime ago over an empty bottle of Patron. He thought of his mother, then. She of the golden hair and soft hands, who bore him as both her despair and her glory. He thought of his glorious temple at Delos, crumbling into dust in the hot Mediterranean sun. His priestesses, his Pythia, wailing at the bottom of dank Hades. His vast treasuries at Delphi, plundered and forgotten. He uncoiled his fingers from his glass and poured himself another shot. \"Toronto.\" __________________________ \"Did you know, now, that Arthur has quite a few tattoos himself?\" Eames sprawled over the loveseat, indolent and graceless. He tipped his beer towards Arthur, uncaring of the froth that spilt over his hand. Half-drunk, Ariadne choked on her wine and sputtered uselessly into her sleeve. \"What? No way.\" \"It's true.\" Eames stretched lazily, like a cat, like a panther. \"Now if you ask him nicely he might even show you, kitten.\" Ariadne giggled, high on the fine wine, and gave Arthur a look, \"Really.\" Arthur sat back and looked at Eames. Eames stared back, insolent and unconcerned. Then, inexplicably, it was Arthur who turned away first. \"Sure.\", he said, easy as graces. He sat up and unbuttoned his shirt, then took it off along with his undershirt. Eames laughed, \"I see you really haven't changed a bit, dear. Always showing off for the lovely ladies.\" Half-naked, Arthur was as lean as a whippet. Black ink coiled around his ribs like a dragon, like a python. Strange words are written across the fine wings of his collarbone, sharp and ominous. \"Whoa.\" Ariadne said fuzzily, impressed. She raised her glass unsteadily in a mock salute and wolf-whistled. Eames grinned, showing his sharp canines. \"Lovely. What does gnothi seauton mean?\", he asked. \"You know the answer.\" Eames sucked on the lip of his bottle briefly and smiled, seductive, \"But I like to hear it in your dulcet tones, dear.\" Ariadne snorted before Arthur could respond and threw some chips at him, \"Eames, don't be like that. I wanna know what it means.\" Eames pursed his lips, as if he was telling a great secret. \"It means 'know thyself'.\" Ariadne laughed and raised her glass for a toast, \"Strangely appropriate, I guess. What does...that other one, meden something? What does that mean?\" \"meden agan. Nothing in excess.\" Arthur answered briskly this time, flat and emotionless. He slid his shirt back on and buttoned it smoothly. Ariadne laughed again and spilt her wine on the floor, \"Oh Arthur, you're like some kind of a caricature of yourself.\" Eames laughed at that, but his eyes on Arthur were cold and menacing as a snake. __________________________ \"I forget to ask, how's your sister nowadays?\" Arthur stopped typing and looked up, \"Fine. How's your mother?\" Eames made a wounded noise, \"Touche. That's quite a low blow, duck.\" Yusef rattled a beaker at his bench, uncaring and oblivious. Saito tipped one well-groomed eyebrow at them. \"I did not know you had a sister.\" Arthur lowered his eyes and said nothing. Eames raised his index finger and made a circle in the air. \"Ah, but not just a sister, no? A twin.\" Saito narrowed his eyes; he did not know this and does not appreciate the fact that he did not know. \"Who is in the dream business also, I would presume?\" Arthur looked up then and gave Eames a hard look. He turned to Saito with his head lowered, deferential, \"No. She works in the woods. She is a hunter.\" \"A huntress.\" Eames corrected. __________________________ \"Come with me tonight.\" Eames had said. And so here he is, deep in the sea of slippery bodies clad in sequins and leather, writhing like snakes to a tribal bass. There is a vague smell of dark wine in the air, damp and cloying. The women around him gyrate wildly around each other with blown pupils, clenching their hair in ecstasy. The supernatural frenzy around him stirs something ancient in his veins, something old and half-forgotten. Bloodlust, he thought. \"Just a bit of fun, flower.\" A tattooed arm threads around his waist, and Eames presses up against him. He thought he could smell mulled wine in Eames' breath, or crushed and old grapes in fertile soil beneath rich vines of old. \"These are yours, then.\" \"In a way.\" \"I'm not in the mood to fight you, Eames.\" He twists away deftly, but Eames is quicker and catches him by the wrist to pull him closer, to laughs and whisper in his ear, \"I mean no harm, Far-Darter.\" Lightning flashes through Arthur's veins and he hisses, burned, \"Never call me that again.\" Eames placidly surrenders his wrist, a cool dark look flooding in his eyes. They stood opposite each other now, only a hand-width apart. Eames' hands are held up in a pacifying gesture, supplicant-like. The club seems muted suddenly, and someone in the distant crowd screams once in agony. A short, staccato note. \"We cannot deny who we are, Helius. Brother.\" Eames says softly, but not without venom. Arthur bows his head and looks away. The scent of blood is in the air now, raw and metallic. Sparagmos, Arthur thinks vaguely. \"Your madness shall be your downfall, Bromios.\" Eames stills at his name and lowers his hands. He smiles gently, and the crowd around him screams in both anguish and rapture. There is blood now, seeping from darker reaches of the room to pool viscous and obscene around their feet. \"I have always known that, prophete.\"",

    "text": "He explores Earth. He has no idea in retrospect what pushed him to suggest losing the tech. No conscious idea. But somewhere deep down he knows it was selfish. No tech, no comms, no way to save him, to contact him, to draw him away from this path. He's going to walk the verdant plains, stroll the dense forests, cross lines of glittering water, run run run. Alone. Because just as deep down he knew then that she was done. Her mysterious disappearance was a shock on the outside. The inside was a grim, bitter satisfaction of being right. So he goes. Far and wide. Away. With only the phantom of her presence for company. He talks to her sometimes. Only sometimes. She never answers because she isn't there but sometimes he likes to pretend she responds anyway. If only while his fingers stroke languidly up and down his cock and he imagines it's her hand instead, her mouth, the wet heat of her pussy. His imagination is good, fevered, the sound of her husky laugh egging it on, spurring it forth. \"Come on, come for me, flyboy,\" she whispers sometimes and there's soft grass below his bare skin, fiery sun above it and her nails graze down his abdomen before her palm glides to cup his balls, her fingertips resting loosely on the base of his cock. \"Come hard. Say my name.\" And that's when she wrenches \"Kara\" out of him, her slightly roughened, warm fingers wrapping around him where he needs them most, up down, up down, slip slide, \"Oh Gods.\" Sometimes her mouth follows, with firm, sweltering pressure, her tongue flicking teasingly and occasionally her teeth nipping just lightly, never to pain but always enough to remind him that she's dangerous. Not that he ever forgets that. It's rare, too too rare when she rises above him and he feels the strong, tough muscles flexing under the tender skin of her thighs and that's when he doesn't respond anymore, not with coherence, not with anything but pure animal sound because she's all around him and now he's filling her and is full himself somehow, full to the bursting. \"You like that, Apollo? Maybe I'm the real god around here,\" she teases throatily. He always comes before she goes. Before he admits again that she's not really there. Comes, his body shuddering head to toe with a fire that starts behind his closed eyelids and spreads all over in thick, winding tendrils. She says a lot of things as he comes, \"That's right. Oh yeah. Come for me, baby.\" She never says 'I love you.' But he hears it anyway. And the sky above him is blue. Blue. Kara Thrace was peaceful, accepting her fate, as she said goodbye to Lee. In a way, it felt good. Complete. That only lasted for another moment and then she was on the rocky shore of a sluggish, gray river and she was pissed. \"What the frak?\" she said and her voice echoed emptily in the air. She looked around and saw no one. The only movement was the water and... something in the distance. She leaned and squinted and the shape resolved itself into a small, wooden boat with a hooded figure inside it, steering it along. \"Hello!\" she called but the person did not respond. She took another look around and then she was sure of where she was. The river was Styx and the man in the boat was Charon. Just frakking great. Risk your life, save the fleet and get death as a reward when the whole damn thing was over? She didn't even get to see the epilogue. And the gods only knew what sort of mess Lee would get himself into without her. She tapped her foot impatiently as she tried to figure out what to do and then caught something out of the corner of her eye. Something in the water. Then she was on her hands and knees, intently watching the images that floated hazily before her. Lee. All alone. Walking walking walking. She had no idea how long she watched and no idea how long tears silently ran down her cheeks, didn't even notice them until she brushed her face and found her hand wet. He branded the Earth with her name, cried it out into the wind that spanned the continents and glided above waters, and this. was. all. wrong. She got to her feet and the boat was close now but she still greedily drank in what the river was showing her. Charon docked and waited and she hesitantly went forward but as she lifted her foot to step inside, to start that final journey, the water began to turn, smearing away Lee's face. Starbuck shook her head and decisively put her foot down. On dry land. \"No thanks,\" she said, adding, \"frak no,\" under her breath. Charon lifted his head and all she could see inside the hood were his perfectly grey eyes. His voice seemed to come from nowhere and everywhere at once. \"You can't escape the end,\" he said. She grinned. \"Watch me.\" She set her boot on the nose of the boat and shoved. Hard. It wavered for a moment then slid back. Charon only shook his head. Starbuck winked. Then she set off. The landscape was dreary, sparse grass, rough ground and a sky of indeterminable color. There were no animals and no birds. No signs of life at all. She kicked a small stone out of her way and started off on a bawdy drinking song about a man from Caprica and a girl from Picon, if only to fill the silence. She was quite sure if Lee was with her, he'd get that really faint blush on the tips of his ears and shake his head. He did the first time they went out drinking and she climbed on top of the bar and broke into the very same song. It was lucky that she knew A LOT of bawdy drinking songs because she didn't have to start repeating herself for at least four days - at least it seemed about that long and she had always had good time sense. It was helpful too that she never got hungry or sleepy, the big and only bonus of being dead. What didn't help was how boring the scenery was. Rocks and shriveled shrubs and the occasional mournful brook sliding quietly along. If she wasn't already dead, she might have just died from boredom. Between songs, she wondered how Helo was doing and what everyone was up to. She was careful not to think about Lee because it just made her madder and there was no one handy to frak up. So there she was, walking and walking and walking and never getting blisters but somehow after days or even weeks (because after a while she stopped counting) she lost her voice. She was just passing by a small lake so she sat down on the shore, swallowing harshly against her swollen glands, and braced herself for the images. When they came it wasn't Lee's face she saw. It was the Admiral, sitting next to a freshly dug grave. The Chief, his face worn, with just trees for company. Baltar and Six digging up ground to start their farm. The formerly drunk bastard Tigh surreptitiously watching Ellen the Bitch pull a child into her lap and tell the little boy a story. Helo swinging Hera on up his shoulders as Athena carried over a bowl of mush. And everyone else she ever knew and everyone she had never met. The whole goddamn fleet fractured into small settlements and it was like everything she knew was dissipating in the depths of the water... in the crisp Earth air. She smashed her fisted hand into the ground then academically examined the broken skin. Blood was seeping through, bits of dirt and small rock clinging on. She brushed herself off and was back on her feet. This time, though she couldn't sing for a while, the silence wasn't the same. There was still nothing audible but there was a weight to it, layers even, as if she was hearing echoes of echoes, tones rather than sounds, the intent of laughing and crying voices and she couldn't help but wonder if she was going insane. Could dead people even go insane? But it didn't matter because she had to get... somewhere and fix it. All of it. Styx was far, far behind her now and it could have been a Monday or a Wednesday or maybe even a day she didn't know the name of but she started to feel a subtle pull. She had picked her original direction at random and kept at it out of sheer Starbuckery and that tug was almost the same, just a few degrees to the right. It could have been a trap or a challenge or salvation but she just shrugged and adjusted her course. Whatever it was, she was going to kick its ass anyway. It was probably a good thing because soon the pull was stronger and stronger and she found herself running, booted feet thudding the ground, which was probably stupid because who in Hades knew how much farther she had to go to find whatever the frak it was. Luckily the dead don't get tired either so she ran for days, occasionally panting more for effect than out of real need. Finally the pull softened and that was lucky too or else she would have smacked right into the hill at the speed she was originally going. A hill, huh? That was different. She eyed it warily, tried to look on either side, but after a few minutes decided to do what she always did - fly by the seat of her pants and come out on top anyway. She stepped into the cave and then clapped a hand over her eyes as intense light raged out into her face. Gingerly, she spread her fingers just a tad and found it was gone and instead the cave opened onto an even dimmer world, a night with just the barest touch of starlight to illuminate her way. She let her eyes adjust and then carefully peeked around the entryway. This was definitely not the Elysian Fields. No sunlight and frolicking souls to be had anywhere in sight. In a way, she would have been kind of disappointed if it was. So... Tartarus or the Asphodel Meadows. It didn't look like a meadow of any sort either. She looked around for something to use as a weapon and picked up a sturdy branch that lay nearby. She tested it for balance, nodded and set off, careful to silence her footsteps as she entered the land of the damned, following the again strengthening pull. She missed the silence quite soon. It wasn't that the denizens screamed continuously. No, it was much worse. They uttered the occasional, completely defeated moans that she could just barely hear and it set her teeth on edge. She tried to avoid looking, only glancing long enough to take quick stock of the situation so she could avoid any potential mission mishaps but sometimes it was hard to look away. Sysiphus grunted, sweat running down the sides of his face as he maneuvered the impossible rock up the mountainside again and again. The flames of Ixion's wheel licked at the dark skies and she could smell his flesh roasting, sweet and sickening as it blackened and curled up. And water slowly trickled out of the sieves the Danaides carried, each drop plop-plopping on the ground below their feet perfectly in time with their tears. She shuddered and forged on, her grip punishingly hard on the branch. Even the air was thick with misery and she sometimes had trouble getting it down and that was the one thing the dead still had in common with the living because she gasped hard and fast to fill her lungs. Then, in the gap of gloom of the trees something white stood out in the distance. When she got closer, she discovered a small but well maintained house. Since the pull hadn't slackened, she figured that was where she needed to go and some part of her wondered if this would end up shattering her faith. Her resolve didn't falter however as she watched a young man clad in a classic chiton, the type she had only seen in history books, scurry out of the front door and then disappear into thin air. No, her resolve didn't falter but this might be just a little harder than she expected. Oh well. She waited a few minutes and saw no one go in or out so she crept from tree to tree before she had to get out into the open area in front of the house. She was almost to the door when... \"Hey! You're not supposed to be here,\" a shrill voice came from behind her and she spun around, slightly adjusting the swing of the branch so that she cracked the young woman on the side of the head. Good shot. She went down with nary a peep. And then, the Great and Fearless Starbuck went through the front door. Long blonde hair swung as its owner threw herself at the white-painted door. A vicious shoulder ram later, the entryway was empty and she was barreling right into the green-tiled bathroom that smelled faintly of mint and pomegranate. The woman soaking inside the oversized tub jerked up, toothpaste dribbling off her brush and onto her chin. Her pale gray eyes went wide and far away and then focused in. She put away the toothbrush and splashed herself clean. \"Hello Kara Thrace,\" she said in a low, melodic voice. \"Thank you for letting me know.\" The infamous Starbuck (the wilder half of Starbuck-and-Apollo) stumbled, face slacking in confusion. \"What?\" \"I must apologize. I don't perceive time quite the same way as you do and I lost track of things and missed my staff making that particular error. Though I'd appreciate it if you would refrain from knocking out any more of them,\" the other woman said, standing up, water sluicing down her body. Her dark hair stuck to her skin from her shoulders, down to her back and all the way to her feet. She stepped onto a rubber mat and wrapped herself in a big, fluffy towel. And then suddenly Starbuck found herself in a car that was familiar in some ways and yet very different than any of the cars she knew. She was strapped into the passenger seat next to the brunette, now clad in dark pants, green sweater and no shoes, who was calmly guiding the vehicle down a traffic-laden, curving road bordered by a dense thicket of ancient trees. \"...what the frak...\" \"I think better when I drive,\" the other woman explained and shot her a smile with impossibly white teeth. \"Where are we?\" Starbuck demanded. \"The future actually. The future your Lee is responsible for,\" she said. \"Looks okay to me,\" Starbuck commented. \"Maybe so... maybe so. It's a future where Cylons and humans are one and they never even knew it could be otherwise,\" the brunette said. \"Except... one of them, a long time ago from now, said that if you don't know the past, you're bound to repeat it. And they don't. Know the past I mean.\" She paused as she took a tight curve, never slowing down. \"Knowledge of your civilization died within three generations. So they don't know anything about William Adama, his broken heart and indomitable spirit. Or Laura Roslin's tireless faith and vision. Or Karl Agathon, whose ability to look past artificial differences and love a woman he should have shot on sight gave birth to their civilization. Or Felix Gaeta, who had a keen mind but whose spirit broke and whose choices brought him to a fate he couldn't have imagined.\" She continued, listing pilots, deck crew, civilians, person after person, some of whom Starbuck knew personally and some whose names she didn't even recognize. \"And they definitely don't know about fiery Starbuck and the steady Apollo, two halves of one soul, whose exploits encouraged, succored and drove the Fleet through endless space until they found sanctuary.\" \"I... don't understand.\" \"This is how the cycles repeat themselves. Ignorance may be bliss but we gave you humans free will and you can't make a choice unless you understand your options,\" the strange woman explained, an odd tone to her voice. Starbuck narrowed her eyes. \"What do you want from me?\" The woman smiled. \"The same thing you have already done for me. You must go back and guide your people, show them the way.\" \"You... what am I?\" she demanded. \"I thought that was sort of obvious really. You're the best of what humanity has. A flawed, complicated creature who came from the dark and sought the light, and danced with death again and again to save her people. That was why you were chosen and I'm sorry for what I had to do but there was no other way you could have seen what I had to show you. We can't walk amongst humans because we burn you. So you had to become the phoenix, burn and rise anew, so that you could be my avatar, my prophet. My voice.\" \"Who are you?\" She smiled again. \"Your people would call me a goddess.\" And then the world blinked and Kara Thrace was standing just behind Lee Adama as he outlined his ground-breaking idea to ditch all the technology and go back to nature. \"Oh, frak no,\" she yelled and he turned around, shielding his eyes against the sun. \"You can't be here,\" he said flatly. \"You're not here.\" She shrugged, favoring him with her best shit-eating grin, then drew back her elbow and popped him one. Sure I am, it said. Lee stumbled back, wiping his mouth with the back of his hand and coming up with blood. He studied it for a second, then looked back at her just in time to get hit again. And I'm not letting you get away with this bullshit, this one added. She didn't wait for him to figure out what was going on but spun around and went after Romo. \"No way are you chucking technology,\" she told him as if it was a direct-from-the-Gods, do-it-or-die, no-choice-all-around order. \"You want to lose everything we have and are? Be my guest. But you're not taking the fleet down with you.\" \"There is no fleet,\" Romo replied slowly, stunned. \"You're not taking down the fleet with you,\" she growled and stalked off. And before Romo could get an argument together or Lee could stop the birdies flying around his head, Kara Thrace rammed right through the crush of the survivors, every single one knowing who she was and, to most, it was as if the gods themselves walked among them. The word spread like arrows arcing in the sunlight. \"I think we lost that battle,\" Lee said with bemusement. Romo said nothing. But that was alright because everyone else had plenty to say. And so it was dusk before Lee caught up with Kara again, his fingers wrapping around her elbow and just firm enough to halt the jab she aimed at his side. He made an excuse to the civilian she was talking to, probably a pretty thin one but the man didn't get a chance to question him as he dragged her away. She could have stopped him but then she remembered and... didn't. \"You're alive,\" he said and it was still kind of a question. \"You got a problem with that?\" she challenged and shoved the vision of him in fields, forests, alongside rivers... all those visions deep down inside. Because she heard every word and it wouldn't happen. She was Starbuck and she said so. He jerked his head, forcefully shaking no. \"How... how are you alive?\" \"None of your frakking business, Apollo,\" she replied. There was no way she was going to tell him what she saw glimmering in the reflections in the River Styx, the images that started to fade when she lifted her foot to get in the boat. No way she was going to tell him where she went instead, about the roads she traveled and the small, white house she found and broke into. And no way at all was she going to share what that woman, that goddess (which goddess was she?) told her. But she was going to hold her breath while she waited for his response. It wasn't verbal, but it spoke volumes. Lee Adama crushed her in his arms, his grip bordering on painful, his breath heavy and ragged against her ear and he didn't say 'I love you,' didn't say a word, but she heard it anyway. And then he let her go and it was like it didn't even happen. Except that it did. \"I guess the Great Starbuck has some ideas on how to run civilization,\" he offered. \"You bet your ass.\" So they didn't dump all technology, and they didn't spread out in a multitude of tiny settlements, but Baltar did take up farming and Ellen was still a bitch even if she mellowed out a bit and Romo was, kind of, mostly, in charge. They built a sprawling village, log houses instead of tents and a big town square for the market and for social gatherings. They adapted what technology they could and feverishly tested everything they could find for any benefits it could hold. It wasn't the Colonies and it wasn't Kobol and it wasn't even New Caprica. They went back to metal tools and the most basic medications and a primitive government structure. They didn't have much but they did have knowledge. Knowledge they wrote down, turned into song, turned into fable. Knowledge they passed along to children and grandchildren and beyond. And most importantly, at least to Kara Thrace, was that when Lee Adama cried out her name into the clear, blue sky, she was there to hear it. And to respond. And it really was her hand stroking him to passion that flared within his open blue eyes. Thousands of years later, a brunette woman walked the streets of a city far removed from that humble beginning. Technology here was far beyond what Starbuck and Apollo had ever seen. And the culture was far different. But their spirit remained.",

      "There was still nothing audible but there was a weight to it, layers even, as if she was hearing echoes of echoes, tones rather than sounds, the intent of laughing and crying voices and she couldn't help but wonder if she was going insane.",

      "But it didn't matter because she had to get... somewhere and fix it.",

      "Luckily the dead don't get tired either so she ran for days, occasionally panting more for effect than out of real need.",
      "Finally the pull softened and that was lucky too or else she would have smacked right into the hill at the speed she was originally going.",
      "A hill, huh?",
      "That was different.",
      "She eyed it warily, tried to look on either side, but after a few minutes decided to do what she always did - fly by the seat of her pants and come out on top anyway.",

      "Gingerly, she spread her fingers just a tad and found it was gone and instead the cave opened onto an even dimmer world, a night with just the barest touch of starlight to illuminate her way.",

      "So...",
      "Tartarus or the Asphodel Meadows.",
      "It didn't look like a meadow of any sort either.",
      "She looked around for something to use as a weapon and picked up a sturdy branch that lay nearby.",
      "She tested it for balance, nodded and set off, careful to silence her footsteps as she entered the land of the damned, following the again strengthening pull.",
      "She missed the silence quite soon.",
      "It wasn't that the denizens screamed continuously.",
      "No, it was much worse.",
      "They uttered the occasional, completely defeated moans that she could just barely hear and it set her teeth on edge.",
      "She tried to avoid looking, only glancing long enough to take quick stock of the situation so she could avoid any potential mission mishaps but sometimes it was hard to look away.",
      "Sysiphus grunted, sweat running down the sides of his face as he maneuvered the impossible rock up the mountainside again and again.",
      "The flames of Ixion's wheel licked at the dark skies and she could smell his flesh roasting, sweet and sickening as it blackened and curled up.",
      "And water slowly trickled out of the sieves the Danaides carried, each drop plop-plopping on the ground below their feet perfectly in time with their tears.",
      "She shuddered and forged on, her grip punishingly hard on the branch.",
      "Even the air was thick with misery and she sometimes had trouble getting it down and that was the one thing the dead still had in common with the living because she gasped hard and fast to fill her lungs.",
      "Then, in the gap of gloom of the trees something white stood out in the distance.",
      "When she got closer, she discovered a small but well maintained house.",
      "Since the pull hadn't slackened, she figured that was where she needed to go and some part of her wondered if this would end up shattering her faith.",
      "Her resolve didn't falter however as she watched a young man clad in a classic chiton, the type she had only seen in history books, scurry out of the front door and then disappear into thin air.",
      "No, her resolve didn't falter but this might be just a little harder than she expected.",
      "Oh well.",
      "She waited a few minutes and saw no one go in or out so she crept from tree to tree before she had to get out into the open area in front of the house.",
      "She was almost to the door when...",
      "\"Hey!",
      "You're not supposed to be here,\" a shrill voice came from behind her and she spun around, slightly adjusting the swing of the branch so that she cracked the young woman on the side of the head.",
      "Good shot.",
      "She went down with nary a peep.",
      "And then, the Great and Fearless Starbuck went through the front door.",
      "Long blonde hair swung as its owner threw herself at the white-painted door.",
      "A vicious shoulder ram later, the entryway was empty and she was barreling right into the green-tiled bathroom that smelled faintly of mint and pomegranate.",
      "The woman soaking inside the oversized tub jerked up, toothpaste dribbling off her brush and onto her chin.",
      "Her pale gray eyes went wide and far away and then focused in.",

      "\"Where are we?\" Starbuck demanded.",

      "\"Looks okay to me,\" Starbuck commented.",

      "It wasn't verbal, but it spoke volumes.",
      "Lee Adama crushed her in his arms, his grip bordering on painful, his breath heavy and ragged against her ear and he didn't say 'I love you,' didn't say a word, but she heard it anyway.",
      "And then he let her go and it was like it didn't even happen.",
      "Except that it did.",

      "So they didn't dump all technology, and they didn't spread out in a multitude of tiny settlements, but Baltar did take up farming and Ellen was still a bitch even if she mellowed out a bit and Romo was, kind of, mostly, in charge.",
      "They built a sprawling village, log houses instead of tents and a big town square for the market and for social gatherings.",
      "They adapted what technology they could and feverishly tested everything they could find for any benefits it could hold.",

      "Knowledge they wrote down, turned into song, turned into fable.",
      "Knowledge they passed along to children and grandchildren and beyond.",
      "And most importantly, at least to Kara Thrace, was that when Lee Adama cried out her name into the clear, blue sky, she was there to hear it.",
      "And to respond.",
      "And it really was her hand stroking him to passion that flared within his open blue eyes.",
      "Thousands of years later, a brunette woman walked the streets of a city far removed from that humble beginning.",
      "Technology here was far beyond what Starbuck and Apollo had ever seen.",
      "And the culture was far different.",
      "But their spirit remained."

    "text": "The room was vast, no walls visible past the Persian rug hangings, just a filtered light dispersing into what seemed like eternity. It may, in fact, have been eternity. The floor was inlaid mosaic and Buffy followed the storyline laid out on it just as she followed Angel in his trek towards one of the big, dark wood tables. She would have rather held his hand but he shrugged her off, rigid and stoic in a way that was familiar and always painful. The other side was already present, just a middle-aged woman in a voluminous black robe and a young looking man in a suit that probably cost as much as Buffy's entire wardrobe. He was the lawyer. She knew that because he delivered the supernatural summons personally. She really didn't like him. Really didn't like him. She reached out and hesitantly touched Angel's elbow. He didn't react. With a sigh, she returned to looking around. Behind the big tables, the roped off seating area was beginning to fill up and she saw a mishmash of human and demonic faces displaying a myriad of expressions. Some were hopeful, other gleeful and... then Angel's lawyer appeared through a gateway. \"Buffy,\" she said as she walked up, her red heels clicking against the mosaic, and her smile lit her blue eyes. \"Don't look so glum. I've got this.\" Buffy nodded. Riana came highly recommended. Riana patted Angel's shoulder, dumped a big pile of papers on their table and yanked a pen out of her hair, undoing the knot it was in. Then the diffuse light went supernova for the briefest moment and, when it receded, the judges' podium was filled. Buffy had barely recovered from the intense assault on her eyes when a gong sounded, reverberating through the room and completely filling her ears. She may have owwed but she couldn't hear herself. Finally there was silence. \"Court is now in session. Case number A286547B12, The Hell Realm versus Angel O'Connor,\" a voice came from nowhere. As it began to name them, the judges inclined their heads. \"Honorable Judges Eunomia, Eirene, Dike,\" triplet dark haired, white clad women, \"Forseti,\" a blond man in leathers, \"Anbay, Haukim, \" two tan-skinned men in black, one slim and one built strong and solid, \"and Ma'at,\" a raven haired woman with a golden headdress. \"Seven's good,\" Riana whispered to Angel and Buffy. \"Good mystical number.\" \"Appearances!\" the voice called out. \"Josiah Westchester for the plaintiff,\" the other lawyer said calmly. \"Riana Masters for the defendant.\" She flashed a smile at the judges. \"And I move to dismiss.\" Pandemonium broke out behind them then died as Ma'at raised her hand palm-out. \"Explain, counselor,\" she said, her voice low and melodious, tinged with an odd accent Buffy didn't recognize. \"There's been a case of mistaken identity. The suit is filed against my client in name however this suit regards matters for which my client was not present.\" \"Objection,\" Josiah said. Buffy held her breath. \"Objection noted,\" Ma'at replied, \"continue, Ms. Masters.\" Buffy exhaled violently. She thought she might like this Ma'at. \"It's simple, Your Honor. My client was not in possession and control of his body through the entirety of its term of existence on the Earth plane.\" Riana bent down and checked her papers. \"He denies responsibility from 1753 to 1898, for five months in 1998 and briefly in 2003. In Earth time, of course. The periods in question, his body was being controlled by the demon Angelus. The acts alleged in the suit concern those periods of time, solely. Therefore, this suit is baseless.\" Buffy clamped her hands together, restraining the urge to applaud. \"Objection,\" Josiah said again. \"Irrelevant. He implicitly consented to becoming a vampire and his body was present. Thus the consent transfers and he is responsible.\" \"I'm afraid not,\" Riana replied. \"My client will testify that he did not give informed consent as not only did he not understand the nature of a vampire but he gave no consent at all to be Turned. Furthermore, even if we accept the consent theory, which we don't, there is a little matter we like to call mens rea.\" Buffy smiled when Angel's head whipped up and smiled again when Josiah glared at Riana. \"Actus non facit reum nisi mens sit rea,\" Riana recited. \"He had no intent to commit the acts and as such is not criminally liable.\" The judges seemed to confer silently and Ma'at smiled. \"Well done, little one. This case is dismissed.\" And this was when Buffy's patience snapped. \"I told you, I told you, I told you SO!\" she yelled at Angel who sat still and stunned. \"I told you it wasn't your fault and you weren't to blame but nooooo you had to sit around and feel guilty and bad for yourself. You left me when we defeated the Mayor because you're so unworthy and evil. And you sulked and sulked and I know cause Cordy told me. And I was right! It's not your fault. You're just...\" she paused and reached for a word she heard from Dawn, \"EMO!\" Riana laughed. Angel shook his head as if to clear the cobwebs. \"I'm... not guilty.\" \"DUH! That's what I've been trying to tell you for years!\" Buffy retorted hotly. \"I'm not guilty,\" he said it, this time firmly. And then he grinned. Buffy started to roll her eyes but got distracted. It was kind of hard not to, to be fair, since a big, sexy vampire was kissing her like he was human and she was oxygen. When the kiss was over, quite possibly a few centuries later, she found herself alone with her Angel in the middle of what looked to be a fairytale meadow, complete with bunnies and butterflies and sunshine beaming on them gently. As Angel looked around in wonder, his hand never releasing hers, she smiled. Now, it was really forever.",

    "text": "Beer and Cigarettes, or, Lestrade and his father. Dionysus had never been known for his virtue, or his healthy habits. He liked to travel, sleep around, and drink. The great thing about traveling to Europe was that he had very little power there, unlike in the U.S., so to the habitants of London he was nothing but an adventurous traveler with an encyclopedic knowledge of alcohol. He met Karen Lestrade in a bar. She spoke with a heavy French accent, and was delighted when he spoke to her in her own language. Please, it was France--he'd been a dozen times exclusively for the food. And damn, could they party. Karen said she didn't put out on the first date--he bought her more wine. Rules got more flexible with the application of alcohol and a godly deviance aura. Three months later Dionysus popped in on her again, after she hadn't shown up at the bar again and he knew why she wasn't drinking. \"Here, you'll need this.\" He handed her a glass of scotch and guided her to a seat. She took the news well, if she did drain the glass. \"What about,\" she gestured to her still flat stomach, were they both knew another person was gradually growing, \"this? Will she--he--it be in danger?\" \"No.\" He assured her. He told her to stay out of America, and the child would (probably) never be troubled by other-worldly things. He was only the god of wine, wild animals, and sexual deviance, and Karen had a steady head on her shoulders. The kid could do a lot worse by way of genetics. Fast-forward a few decades, and Greg Lestrade rubbed his forehead as he stared at a pile of paperwork. Damn, he could use a drink and a cigarette.. Platforms and Politics, or, the mind of a Meryl and Mycroft. Meryl Holmes was brilliant, intuitive, creative. She was the wife of a wealthy politician who never appreciated her talents and skills, despite the fact that Meryl was close to single-handedly keeping her husband's platform well-liked. Meryl didn't know that the grey-eyed woman who worked at the office was a goddess. She didn't know that the goddess watched her, carefully, taking in the mind hidden behind the short hair. She didn't know just how much attention her genius had gotten from Athena. Athena saw the woman, working endlessly, with a brain power unrivaled by any Athena had seen in years. She knew that Meryl was barren, and that her husband resented her for it. Athena scheduled Mrs. Holmes' doctor appointments, sitting in the rolling-chair that really wasn't much different from her own throne on Mount Olympus. Athena didn't come to Europe for the freedom, like Dionysus. She came for the minds, because genius knows no country lines and therefore neither does she. She found one in the tall, imposing politician's wife, and knew that a child here would succeed, away from the problems that made their home with the gods. Meryl never truly believed the goddess, when Athena turned up, nine months later with an infant. It didn't make sense, logically, but it also didn't matter. Even when Athena showed a small bit of her true form and said \"He's mine\" it was irrelevant to Meryl. She had a son, who was already brilliant in the purest sense of the word, snuggling in to her chest like he knew he was hers. He was hers, the office-woman-turned-goddess insisted, and Meryl agreed. College biology disagreed, but where Mycroft grew up to be logical and calculating, Meryl was more inclined to let her emotions rule, just this once. That didn't stop her from reading the DNA test her husband insisted on, because he refused to accept it. She never told Mycroft he was a demigod. She assumed he knew she didn't carry him for nine months, because he was so clever and there was never any evidence to prove she did. She let him think that he was adopted, as she was a logical woman and she was comfortable hiding secrets. Mycroft got that from her, not Athena, and just try telling Meryl otherwise.. Drawings and People, or, the work of Molly's father. It was probably around ten years later when Athena popped in again, checked on Mycroft, and went south. South to a nice man on the coast, who was nearly her opposite. He was gentle, a painter, who liked the smell of the rivers and the bustle of a small town. He was brilliant, too, in a different way. He saw a person and saw what made them human, and he saw Athena and saw what made her not one. That happened, sometimes, some people were gifted to see through the Mist, and Mr. Hooper was one of them. He accepted what he saw as miracles and magic, and drew them up for the tourists that stopped in and bought the pictures of small dancing figures and things that wove under the waves. He told Athena as much, when he saw her again. She bought a few drawings, one of them of her, and told him she was going to give him a child. He nodded sagely and thanked her politely, and at first she thought he didn't believe him, but he did. He named the small, soft baby Molly. He raised her with stories of the things he'd seen, but he always phrased them as stories. He knew the darker, more dangerous things didn't cross the ocean to come here, and Molly probably wouldn't have believed him, anyway. She was smart, like her mother, but softer, like her father. She understood humans, and people often overlooked the brain she had. But she made it through medical school with flying colors, and she knew her father was proud. When she compared Sherlock Holmes--one person her intellect had settled on, obsessed over--to her father, it was the highest compliment she could come up with... Judo and Chess, or, Hermes can't win them all. It's a bit not good to have a god have two children with the same mortal. It's even less good to have two different gods have children with the same mortal. 'Fuck it', Hermes thought. He always liked breaking rules. Meryl Holmes was sneaky, and smart, and cunning. He snuck into the office to leave a note for her from Athena concerning the political path of her son, who was ten or so, and had found himself being judo-flipped. It turned out Meryl had stayed in the office late for paperwork, had martial arts training, and he had walked right into her, and been flipped on his rear. Staring up at her stern face from the floor, upside down, with a sharp pain in his lower back, he thought he had never seen anything more beautiful. Their relationship was a month-long battle of wits. She knew who he was, even if she hadn't fully accepted the reality of gods, as he had no power in Cheshire, where she was staying. In her mind, it was a game of chess. In his, it was a game of double solitaire. In the end both of them lost--she had his son, but never became enamored with the god, and had insisted he stay away from both her sons. 'Can't win 'em all', Hermes mused. He looked like a jogger today, stopping by a crime scene to observe the police, the dead man, and the tall detective who pickpocketed the inspector... Westwood and Control, or, Eris's child. Jim Moriarty never knew his mother. To be honest, he never knew much about his father either, but he was just absent. Eris had visited England to see what the fuss was about. Discord loves company, and there were a handful of other demigods being born there. She loved her kids, she truly did, but she wasn't an ideal mom and she certainly didn't want to deal with a child. So to Europe she trotted, to a bold Scottish man who caught her eye. Here, her kid would be safe. Or, as safe as he wanted to be--Jim was a trouble maker and a little crazy, which turned into a trouble maker with a lot of crazy, as he grew. That wasn't Eris's problem, and she didn't really mind. The mortals could use a little stirring up. Moriarty stirred them up. Causing trouble, breaking rules, being the littlest (or biggest, most overwhelming) bit cruel came naturally. He liked the feeling of power, the control, and the lack of control. He read somewhere that most psychopaths think they're entirely sane. Jim was called a psychopath, and he knew he was, but bloody hell. It ran in the family.. Balance and Scales, or, someone's proud of Philip. Philip was one thing Nemesis was really, very proud of. He didn't know about who she was, of course, and that was a good thing for the both of them. She saw the way he watched, anyway, the way he balanced the good and the bad. Nemesis was the goddess of revenge, yes, but not just that--she was the goddess of balance, too, and Philip got a lot of that part of her. He went to college, got an education, helped people. He restored a little bit of balance to the teeny corner of London he worked in. Oh, he had flaws, and plenty of them, which Nemesis could say without guilt because she didn't raise him and she didn't have a lot of maternal feelings. When he made a mistake and got punished for it, like when his wife left him or when he lost his job, he took at and understood the scales had been righted. But most days, Philip Anderson returned to his apartment feeling accomplished, if frustrated. Until the day when the bad completely won over the good with no chance of return, Anderson would work to fix the scales... Needles and Handguns, or, John's another type of warrior. Ares, with all his patriotism and single-mindedness, hardly ever ventured out of America. Once or twice, and once to a little town in England. The woman he met was a strong-willed, adventurous woman who laughed when he tried to pick her up at a bar. Challenge accepted, he wooed her for weeks, found out she was going through a rough patch in her marriage. She went back to the man, then she found out she was pregnant and it was Ares's--or, Hamish's, because seriously nobody would buy his name being Ares anymore.He never told her who he was, and she didn't care. She lived outside the U.S., and while the kid may be one hell of a fighter, he'd never have to worry about the monsters and myth and shit. John Hamish Watson was a scrapper from a young age, but nice, not a nasty piece of work like most of Ares's other kids. He watched the man, his son, a couple of times on the field. Medical doctor, saw a lot of combat and injuries. A soldier, a warrior, someone everyone knew instinctively not to mess with. He could handle a needle the way most of his children handled swords--he was a dead-eye with a hand gun and never shook when it counted. He wasn't surprised when John fell in with that Sherlock fellow; even if he was taken a bit off guard when he figured out it was Hermes's brat... Doorways, or, the start of the story. In truth, the parents-in-blood-only were all surprised when their kids were drawn to each other. It really shouldn't have been surprising, argued Janus, the god of doorways and choices. They were demigods in a country fairly devoid of demigods--that drew them together, like opposite ends of a magnet or moths to a flame. They bumped heads and hashed out problems, none of them knowing the truth of parentage and why they interacted as they did. Janus smiled at his relatives, bickering worse than the children they had spawned, and across the street at his grandson, Mike Stamford, who saw and knew the truth but didn't say anything, because why bother with what wasn't hurting? Doorways and choices, indeed...",

    "text": "When the earth divided itself under her feet and she fell down, Persephone couldn't believe what was happening to her. The horses of the god of the Underworld caught her on the way down, placing her safely on the halls of the immense castle, where blue fire was burning on the candles. She wondered how her sisters were feeling now. Athena was probably furious with the fact that she didn't saw that coming. Artemis was probably thinking of how scared she must be, kidnapped and taken to a place with no sunlight. Truth was, however, that Persephone had been waiting for that for a long time. She had seen Hades only once before, and his presence fascinated her. He was nothing like the gods of Olympus. He spoke little and his face displayed almost no emotion. She figured being virtually alone in Tartarus did little to one's social skills. She wanted to meet him! She felt a strong desire to talk to him, understand whether he was alone by choice or by lack of other options. Hermes was the only god who could travel down there, and she knew the messenger was hardly the most pleasant company, especially when he had waken up on his humorous side. Hades approached her from behind, pulling her hardly against his ivory body. Of course she knew why he had kidnapped her, and she also was well aware she had provoked it all, but that didn't mean she wasn't a bit scared of what was about to happen. \"I wonder what a sunny creature like you was thinking, trying to draw my attention so shamelessly.\" He whispered on her ear, sending a shiver down her body. Yes, his whole presence was frightening, but that was what called out the most for her. \"I didn't do anything on purpose.\" She answered, her voice shaken. \"No, you sure didn't.\" His voice was as powerful as his image. Before she could answer, his hands were on her belt, destroying the leather and making her dress fall to the ground. He turned her around by the arm, forcing her to stare at him - black against limpid blue. He could see the desire and the fear, mixed on her. He groaned. With one arm, he brought her closer to him, kissing her forcefully. Before Persephone could react, Hades undid his own belt, letting his clothes fall to the ground, next to hers. Next thing she knew, her back was against the cold ivory floor. Did he really want to do that on the floor? That certainly wasn't how she had imagined the whole thing. \"Hades...\" she whispered, her tone of voice discretely complaining about the precarious situation. However, if he heard her, he pretended not to. That goddess had purposefully teased him, running down those meadows with flowers on her arms and smiles on her lips. He desired her insanely. Persephone must have some kind of dirty business with Aphrodite, there was no other explanation. When he entered her, Persephone screamed, and it wasn't for pleasure. It hurt. And it seemed like he had done it on purpose, as if he wanted to see her in pain. Tears fell from her sapphire eyes as she noticed he was punishing her for trying so hardly to seduce him. For the gods, she just wanted to get to know him a little better! Everyone was always babbling about Hades, the great silent lord of the Underworld. However, when she laid her eyes upon him, she, someway she would never understand, thought everything that was said about him wasn't true. He didn't seem cruel or mean, he just seemed... lonely. Awfully lonely. When he was done with her, he just got up, his eyes filled with anger. \"You can go back to your sunny land now and tell your nymphs about the amazing experience you just had.\" Persephone caught her dress, trying to cover herself from him. She could hear the anger on Hades' voice, but she was just sad. Sad, afraid and disappointed. \"That wasn't what I came here for.\" He straightened his eyes, staring at her as if she was some kind of perverse being, trying its best to make a fool of him. \"I thought you were different from them.\" She said, her throat feeling thick because of the tears. \"Different from whom?\" \"My brothers, Apollo, Hermes and Dionysus. And, of course, my father, Zeus. No one never speaks about the great deeds of a son of Hades, like they do about the sons of those I mentioned. Gods, even the daughters have fame. And when I saw you... I figured you were different.\" Hades chuckled bitterly. \"You're just a fool, child. Too young to understand anything.\" She tried to wipe away her tears, but they just kept coming, completely ignoring her will. \"My father will probably just marry me to some idiotic mortal, like he is planning to do to Tetis. I don't want such a sad future for me. I don't want mortal children.\" This time, Hades laughed openly. \"And you thought I would marry you?\" Persephone pretended not to be hurt by that comment. Wasn't she pretty enough? She was the daughter of proud Demeter, the goddess of harvest. She tended to all flowers and trees, making them grow more beautifully than any plant could ever expect to. She had golden hair, blue eyes and the most perfect body any god has ever had. Didn't any of that please him at all? \"You seemed so lonely... I thought I could be the one to make you some company.\" His laughs continued to echo through the walls. \"Do you really think you can live down here, child? You, who enjoy Helios the most, think you can live on a place where he never shines?\" With the little dignity she had left, Persephone raised from the floor, collecting her belt to properly hold her clothes in place. \"Well, it just seems like you are not who I thought you were. I'm sorry to have bothered you. I'm ready to leave now... And never come back.\" The more she talked, more Hades got furious. However, he was furious with her for understanding him so completely with just a single glance at his direction. Yes, he was lonely. Yes, he didn't like to fool around with mortals when he would have to deal with their souls after they were dead. In all his infinite time on the Underworld, he had seen a lot of mortals with endless resentment towards the gods, especially the objects of Zeus' desire. Those spirits went completely mad, and it was really difficult to deal with them. That was why Hades never even looked twice at a human. Getting closer to her, he held her by the chin, forcing her to look at him. \"Why would you like to stay down here?\" \"My mother would have to stop treating me like a baby. I wouldn't be forced to marry a human, or worse, Apollo, Hermes or Ares. My father won't have any control of my life. Hera would have to stop annoying me - as if I'm the only bastard child of Zeus! I would finally be treated like a real goddess, instead of being looked upon as if I'm nothing but a pretty nymph.\" \"You are not a nymph.\" \"Tell that to the twelve very important gods of Olympus.\" And that was when Hades decided Persephone was perfect to be his queen. Nothing had made him more furious than being left out of the \"Olympians\". Poseidon wasn't a god of Olympus, but he was on that ridiculous list. Letting his thumbs run across her cheeks, Hades wiped away her tears, finally feeling sorry for what he had done to her. \"I will take you as my wife, Persephone with purple garlands.\" \"Aren't you tricking me?\" she asked. He smiled at her, and she noticed how incredibly beautiful he really was. Zeus and Poseidon were nothing compared to him. \"No. And our marriage was already consummated. You can't escape me now.\" She smiled to him, finally feeling like something important had happened to her. She would make him proud, he would see. Materializing a pomegranate, he opened it for her. \"After you eat, this realm will become your home.\" But she only had time to eat three seeds before Hermes was able to grab her and take her away.",

    "text": "The walls of the labyrinth are veined with gold. The labyrinth itself has been carved out of the earth, a maze of paths hidden underground, far away from sight and sunlight, and as such, the walls of it carried the hidden riches of Crete within them. Veins of gold, ores of iron and bronze and more, each stroked lines of red and silver, gold and bronze, that broke the dark earth, providing the lone interruptions of colour amongst the dim light of the underground labyrinth. Ariadne had always been fascinated by the flickers of deep jewelled light, the sole brightness against the darkness and gloom that permeated the air there, and tried to imagine a life seeing only those colours, a life of silver and bronze and the red of human blood. But her mind saw the blue of the sky and the green of the grass instead, too full of the joys of living above the ground, with open sky, to imagine a life tinged with shadows rather than the light of the sun. All ores and deposits of wealth and metal were there through the riches of Crete itself, all but the gold, and only the line of gold ran throughout the length of the labyrinth. It had been placed there by Daedalus himself, the lines of it running as wide as a man's hand at some points, and as thin as a wisp in others, but it ran there along the wall, leading the follower deeper into the heart of the maze. The one secret of the great Cretan labyrinth, and the key to its solving; the one line of gold that etched a path from entrance to centre and then to the entrance again, from monster to home. The secret had been passed onto her by her mother, and from her mother before her, ever since the labyrinth had been carved out of the earth. Remember this always Ariadne, follow the line of gold. You will never be lost if you follow the line of gold. The secret was entrusted to the eldest daughter of Crete, for they knew that they would never leave, not while their ancestors' shame still settled on them, Pasiphae made to take to a bull to bear the punishment for Minos' own arrogance. The Gods are angry at them still, the people whispered, their words flying on the wind, for the Minotaur still yet craves human flesh to sate its hunger. But they had not seen her brother, or seen past the grotesque mix of bull and man. He is just a boy, she wanted to tell them, just a boy who has never seen sunlight or touched grass. He lives in the dark, and when strangers venture to him, they scream and scratch at him. He is just a boy. She calls him her brother, but he'd never been as such; he is vastly older than her, alive even in the times of her grandmother, but his cursed nature kept his heart beating in his chest, living as long as the shame did, or so they said. She had seen her brother only a few times, always half hidden in the shadows, eyes wary but never crazed, always prone to flight as she made the slightest move towards him. He had never attacked her, but she had never attacked him either, and that, Ariadne thought, was the difference. Who would not attack when attacked, defend their own life, no matter how little they'd lived? He's human, just as me, she thought, but the whispers of her monstrous brother continued to whirl around her. The common folk said they heard screams in the night, even when the Athenian tributes had not yet come, but when the tributes came, they saw their shades on the island shore, wailing for lives lost at the hands and horns of a beast born of a cursed union between woman and beast. She brings him goats daily, throats slit and blood drying on their stringy coat, and she brings him oats and wheat, but when she returns the next day, treading the path that is lined with gold, the goat is gone but the oats remain. He is more man than beast, she thinks, if he eats the meat. His teeth must have the sharp canines of her own human brothers, and the flesh and hair must catch in them like they do her own. If he were a beast, like they claimed, then he would take the oats, be the bull that was his father, but he takes the meat. She wants to present this truth to her mother and father, to the common folk who speak of monsters and screaming shades who stalk the nights, but they will take this truth as evidence of monstrosity. No bull would eat the flesh! they would cry, and ask for his death again, misremembering that her brother possesses human hands and a human heart, not knowing that when she ventures into the deep centre of the labyrinth, there is a haunch of goat left to await her, the one gift the boy-monster knows how to give. He is just a boy. But he is also a monster, once white horns now stained with the red of lives lost and broken bodies, and those human hands have wrung life and last breath from human lungs while that bull's mouth has eaten human flesh. He is monster and boy, both and neither, but he is not the monster that they speak of in whispers tinged with fear. He offers gifts to those who venture into his dark home and his eyes have the nature of a cow's, liquid brown that are filled with wariness and gentleness, rather than rage and terror. He is born of a cursed union, born cursed and broken by the Fates' design, but he is not a monster, never a monster. \"Will you give me the secret to the labyrinth?\" Theseus peers through the bars, flickering shadows cast over his face by the light of the torch clutched desperately in her hand. Too many times she hears of the tributes' desire to kill and slay, to rip her monstrous brother limb from limb and emerge with his body broken behind them, but Theseus has no desire to. I simply want to escape, to go home to my father, he told her when she first came close to him, clutching desperately at her wrist. Dirt marred her skin as his hand was pulled away, and Ariadne was taken by the desperation in his eyes, and she thinks she can understand; she thinks she can make him see. He wants to escape too, she wanted to tell him in those moments, before the guards dragged him to the cage where he would await his doom with the other Athenian tributes. He wants to live a life that is not full of fear; I can see it in his eyes when I venture there. He is more afraid of us, than we are of him. \"Will you save him, my brother? Lead him from the darkness as a man, but not as a monster. Do no harm to him, and I swear he will not hurt you!\" How does she convince him of this, when her own people speak of the screams of the dying that echo underneath the earth, resounding within the walls of the labyrinth? How does she make him understand that her brother is man, as well as bull, though all others have forgotten such? They view him as monstrous, a bull made to eat human flesh, a living subversion of the rightful way of things, but his hands are human too, offering her gifts in the darkness. He may be a beast, but so too is man, and their eyes contain none of the guileless quality of the beast that resides inside her brother. \"I will, I swear it. I'll save the minotaur, lead him free of the labyrinth. Tell me the secret Ariadne.\" He will free her brother, and that is all that matters. \"Follow the line of gold,\" she whispers to him, and the night air seems unnaturally chill as she imparts this coveted secret of the labyrinth to the stranger before her. Gods forgive me, I know I work against your hands, but he is a human and my brother besides. Gods above, forgive me. \"Keep it on your left when you venture in, and on your right when you venture out. Stray from it but once from the start, and you'll never find your way out; the only path to be trusted is the line of gold painted from the very start. All others are tricks that will lead you astray - but follow the line of gold and lead my brother home.\" And then she is gone, torch extinguished but the scent of its smoke clinging to her skin. Tomorrow, he shall be free, she thinks, and, for the first time, the knot of dread that comes with the arrival of the Athenian tributes eases in her gut. Theseus will free her brother from the maze that has been his prison, and with the secret of the maze, he will reach her brother before the others. He will find him, and calm him, and lead him from the darkness into the sunlight, and the Cretan monster of infamy shall be no more. There will only be her brother, half man, half beast, but freed, finally in the sunlight. Perhaps she ought to fear, Ariadne thinks as her eyes catch on the stars, finding constellations of hunters and doomed lovers, for the Gods are not kind when crossed. But for her brother, for the man-beast with human hands and an animal's guileless eyes, she will risk it. He deserves more than to live in the dark. He deserves the sunlight and the grass and the sky. Gods forgive me, he is just a boy. She dreams that night of swords and blood stained bull horns, of running frightened through the labyrinth where the walls are veined with red and silver, but no gold in sight. She dreams of a monster devouring Theseus with his dark, sincere eyes, and hears screams within her dreams. She dreams of the victims past, of Hippophorbas and Melanippe, and when she wakes, her body shakes with imagined fear. Morpheus has sent her these dreams to plague her, to punish her for her actions, Ariadne is sure, but it is too late now. The deed has been done, the secret given, and when the sun sets this day, she will be there to watch as the fourteen tributes are pushed into the labyrinth, screaming as they always do, the girls wailing with tear streaked faces, crying out to Athena and Zeus, while the boys quake and mutter their own prayers in broken voices. But the result shall be different this time, and Ariadne can feel it in her bones; this shall be the time where the fourteen deaths are not blamed on her brother, and this shall be the time that one survives, and the Cretan minotaur escapes. This will be the time that Ariadne defies the Gods. She takes her brother no food when she rises that morning, to leave him hungry and wanting the human flesh as her father desires, gut churning as she watches the passage of the sun through the sky. The common folk are quiet in the town, but there is no silence - within their cages, the tributes wail and scream and beg. \"Make them stop!\" her sister commands, and the soldiers do her bidding, and when they return, there is blood on their hands, but there is silence, broken only when the soldiers drag the tributes from their cage and towards their doom. It will not be so this time, Ariadne thinks desperately, and wishes she could clutch at the young girls and tell them so, ease the terror from their faces and tell them of the gifts of food that the minotaur has left her. He's not a monster, he's just a boy. Just afraid. Oh don't be afraid, you have nothing to fear. But she stands by her mother's side, watching the procession with her family, her eyes on Theseus and willing him to lead her brother from the dark and into the open air where she will be waiting, clad in the cover of darkness, hidden by Nyx's blessing if she be so inclined, ready to show her brother the human kindness that he has missed since being born with a bull's head in place of a man's. She feigns retirement along with her family, but when the night is completely drawn, she rises from her silks and covers and pads silently from the palace to the labyrinth where she waits. I will show him the sky, and teach him the stars. There is a heart of a man inside him, she knows it. He is a boy too, as well as a beast. But she will never know - Theseus exits the maze with his thirteen tributes behind him, and with a blade that drips with blood, one hand clutching the severed head of her brother. Anguish fills her as Ariadne watches Phaedra fly into Theseus' arms, and suddenly Ariadne knows what has occurred. You have betrayed me sister. Only Ariadne knows the secret of the maze, only she bears responsibility for it and the creature held within it, and only Phaedra knew of her affection for their brother, the one that Phaedra had always called the monstrous beast. And now both their hands have helped to slay their brother with wary brown eyes and human hands, and the rage at the act consumes her. She discards the invisibility that the night has given her to fly at Theseus, and she feels, for the first time, the power and rage that they all thought her monstrous brother must possess, for she would rend Theseus limb from limb and gouge out his lying eyes, rip out his tongue that dripped fallacies with each breath. She cares not about the blade in his hand, the blade that should not be there, and once again she thinks of Phaedra. Did you give him the weapon that cut our brother's head from his body, sister? Did you give him the instrument that killed our own blood? The legends will say that she went with him out of love, but she went with Theseus spitting and screaming, the necessary ransom needed to allow the release of him and his kind from the island that was meant to be their doom, and when they are far away from Crete and the ships of her father are smaller than specks of dust, he sets her down in Naxos and sails away, her sister on board his ship with the severed head of her brother as his trophy for his heroic deed. Her mouth is parched dry by the time the evening sun sets, and Ariadne waits on the beach for the welcome embrace of death. She is a kinslayer now, killer of an innocent thing that trusted her when it had experienced nought but hatred and violence and blind fear by all whom had ventured into the heart of the labyrinth; death, she thinks, is what she deserves. But it is not Death who comes, not Thanatos nor Nemesis, but Dionysus, shoulders draped with a fox skin and holding his staff covered with ivy, the wood of it leaking honey, and the scent that surrounds him is one of summer wine and ripe figs. \"Would you like to speak with your brother, mortal?\" Her parched lips part slightly as his hand extends down to her, and for a moment she hesitates. But the moment passes, and Ariadne slips her hand into his, and lets him lead her away from the shore to where his maenads and satyrs dance in reckless abandon. They are man and beast all at the same time, Ariadne thinks to herself as she watches in awe at them, and yet not feared. And when she joins them in the dance, the taste of Dionysus' wine still fresh on her tongue, Ariadne understands for the first time how the God before her means to let her speak with her brother.",

      "But she stands by her mother's side, watching the procession with her family, her eyes on Theseus and willing him to lead her brother from the dark and into the open air where she will be waiting, clad in the cover of darkness, hidden by Nyx's blessing if she be so inclined, ready to show her brother the human kindness that he has missed since being born with a bull's head in place of a man's.",
      "She feigns retirement along with her family, but when the night is completely drawn, she rises from her silks and covers and pads silently from the palace to the labyrinth where she waits.",
      "I will show him the sky, and teach him the stars.",
      "There is a heart of a man inside him, she knows it.",
      "He is a boy too, as well as a beast.",
      "But she will never know - Theseus exits the maze with his thirteen tributes behind him, and with a blade that drips with blood, one hand clutching the severed head of her brother.",
      "Anguish fills her as Ariadne watches Phaedra fly into Theseus' arms, and suddenly Ariadne knows what has occurred.",
      "You have betrayed me sister.",
      "Only Ariadne knows the secret of the maze, only she bears responsibility for it and the creature held within it, and only Phaedra knew of her affection for their brother, the one that Phaedra had always called the monstrous beast.",
      "And now both their hands have helped to slay their brother with wary brown eyes and human hands, and the rage at the act consumes her.",
      "She discards the invisibility that the night has given her to fly at Theseus, and she feels, for the first time, the power and rage that they all thought her monstrous brother must possess, for she would rend Theseus limb from limb and gouge out his lying eyes, rip out his tongue that dripped fallacies with each breath.",
      "She cares not about the blade in his hand, the blade that should not be there, and once again she thinks of Phaedra.",
      "Did you give him the weapon that cut our brother's head from his body, sister?",
      "Did you give him the instrument that killed our own blood?",
      "The legends will say that she went with him out of love, but she went with Theseus spitting and screaming, the necessary ransom needed to allow the release of him and his kind from the island that was meant to be their doom, and when they are far away from Crete and the ships of her father are smaller than specks of dust, he sets her down in Naxos and sails away, her sister on board his ship with the severed head of her brother as his trophy for his heroic deed.",
      "Her mouth is parched dry by the time the evening sun sets, and Ariadne waits on the beach for the welcome embrace of death.",
      "She is a kinslayer now, killer of an innocent thing that trusted her when it had experienced nought but hatred and violence and blind fear by all whom had ventured into the heart of the labyrinth; death, she thinks, is what she deserves.",
      "But it is not Death who comes, not Thanatos nor Nemesis, but Dionysus, shoulders draped with a fox skin and holding his staff covered with ivy, the wood of it leaking honey, and the scent that surrounds him is one of summer wine and ripe figs.",
      "\"Would you like to speak with your brother, mortal?\" Her parched lips part slightly as his hand extends down to her, and for a moment she hesitates.",
      "But the moment passes, and Ariadne slips her hand into his, and lets him lead her away from the shore to where his maenads and satyrs dance in reckless abandon.",
      "They are man and beast all at the same time, Ariadne thinks to herself as she watches in awe at them, and yet not feared.",
      "And when she joins them in the dance, the taste of Dionysus' wine still fresh on her tongue, Ariadne understands for the first time how the God before her means to let her speak with her brother."

    "text": "She is wrapped in gauze and silk, curls of her shining hair lying upon her breast, a sight that all men would kill for. No man, hero or villain, would remain true to their vows if Aphrodite offered them a night with her for a favour to be done. The sight of her is as the finest wine; it intoxicates with presence alone. The lesser trip over their words in her presence, stumble as they take leave of their minds and dedicate all thought and energy towards taking in the sight of her, feasting on what beauty is in front of them, but he is not a man. He is Ares, God of War, and his tongue remains smooth, even if the words that leave it are short and blunt. He is no King, but a God of blood and action, and he finds no time to flatter a goddess' beauty whilst there are warriors he must watch and battles to fight in. He is never more alive than when he is in the thick of battle, blood upon his bare skin and a sword in his hands. It calls to him like nothing else. But he is not immune to her, to her grace, to her beauty, to the sight of her breasts moving as she takes in each breath. The curve of her lips and the movement of her limbs has an unearthly grace which would see her bathing in blood on a battlefield, weaving in between each blow with movements more suited to dancing, stilling men as they drank in the sight of her. \"Does the sight please you, my lord?\" Even her voice was beautiful in its own way, soft and deep and full of the night time hours and murmurs of lovers as they lay together. \"Ask me again, my lady, once I've won this war,\" is his response, the words clipped, his eyes moving across her. Beauty is for after the war, the embrace of a woman a comfort to wash away the knowledge of mortality. But he is a God and an immortal, and war is his way; he needs no comfort, no assuaging of guilt, for it is the way of war for there to be victors and deaths, for the lesser to be speared and broken and the cowardly to run and hide with a tail between their legs. No, he doesn't need comfort after war - he needs release, a way to shake the thrum of war from his blood. For once the excitement enters him, it does not leave, not until he is bested by a worthy opponent, and there is none worthy, no match for him and his skill and energy. No man may beat a God, not at his own sport, not at his calling. War calls to him and he will answer until he is exhausted - but he is never exhausted. Her laughter rings out in the air between him. \"Then by all means, go win yourself a war. I find myself eager to hear your answer.\" And come to her he does, when the battle is won. She is draped in nothing at all, but the long locks of her hair and the glow that comes from drinking of ambrosia. She is all golden skinned and playful eyes, and again she asks if the sight is pleasing to him. He has no answer but to take her in rough hands and press her against him, to take and take and take from her mouth and the folds between her legs until she flips them over and presses him into the ground. With a leg thrown over him, she straddles him and rides him like she might a steed, and this makes him buck himself into her. He tastes defeat for the first time as she fucks him, as he feels her body control how he should move inside her, and surrenders to her will. He never knew defeat could feel so sweet, so needed. He has won wars for time beyond reckoning, and the victories are thrilling but now seem greater, after tasting what it means to lose, to surrender, to be at the mercy of another. For the first time in his long memory, he wants both - not just victory, but to lose, to forfeit to another, to her. And he does. When the battles end, he moves to her, presses his mouth against her hard and rough, but it never ends with him taking what he wants and leaving. There is no city conquered, the walls burning, smoke rising high in the sky. She is not a battlefield he can conquer, but a force he must submit against, a war he will always lose. He has never wanted defeat so much in his existence except in this one thing, when it comes from her arms and her kiss and her touch. In this alone he will accept it; in this alone, he needs it. When they leave one another, they do not leave unchanged. He places kisses against her bare flesh and nips at the skin of her breasts to leave purple bruises, and she presses her nails into his skin, sucks at the flesh of his throat to leave marks there. They carry the violence of their love upon them, each body a battlefield, a conquered city. His defences against her are nothing; they fall at the slightest provocation. Against her, he is rubble; he is ruin. She refuses to leave his mind, except when he enters the heat of battle. War and her smell fill his mind at every moment, until they begin to blend together, her beauty becoming a thing of war. She has a face that makes him think of why wars may start, of lives lost and blood spent across the ground, all for a glance from her, all for a look and a touch and a ghost of affection from her. And he is hardly better than any of the men that were driven mad by longing for her; he too, God though he was, wanted to prostrate himself across the floor in front of her, have her walk, with dainty clean feet, over his back. He wanted to wipe nations clean off maps for her, be the scourge of the world if it suited her, all for the rise of her mouth into a smile, an echo of a laugh. Beauty drives him mad, but a God of War is already half mad already - mad with blood and violence and lust. When she comes to him, he should refuse her, should think that they ought to not. For she is bound, in holy marriage, to another, but what does love and lust care for vows that are spoken but never felt? They are creatures of fire, and she will take what she desires, and he will lay himself down in front of her as a supplicant. She is the beauty of war wrapped in a woman, and oh, how he loves her for it. She is selfish and fickle and burns hotter than any fire within his blood stirred by slitting a man from throat to groin, and he feels alive again as she commands him to his knees in service to her. Yes my love, whispered on his lips, and then louder as she commands it. She is his commander, his general, and he bows at her feet to listen to her words and obey them without hesitation. There is violence in her, and the others can't see it. But he can, God of War and Violence and Blood, he can see this violence within her. And he worships it. Conquer me like a city, my love, he thinks as her nails dig hard into the skin of his shoulders. Leave me as your ruins and I shall be happy to be destroyed by your touch. He craves it, the destruction, the ruin, to be left quivering and shaking in the wake of her. He doesn't wait for the battles to finish to go to her anymore; he goes to her whenever there is a chance to. She might turn him away with a laugh that only stirs his blood more, or she might take him to her bed, but he goes to her anyway. Let me worship you, he thinks, as the men and women do. Let me be as a man whilst we share this bed, and let me worship you. He worships her as he worships the tools of his trade. The same hands that polish and sharpen his blade so carefully and attentively show the same devotion to the curves of her body, the same eyes that know how to kill a man fifty paces away with a spear are just as adept at spotting her reactions to his touch. War lends itself to lust with a finesse that cannot be denied. He was born to kill men, and born to love her in the same way - without regret, without hesitation, full of vigour and passion and breathless excitement. Let us make a war between us, and let you be my conqueror. At night, he kneels at the altar of her and speaks his prayers into her thighs. His mind is still in a fog from his release when the bronze net descends down upon him, the fine chains of it confining and burning upon his skin. He roars and thrashes against it, but the net traps them both to the bed and to each other's naked bodies. Hephaestus - the misshapen, the crippled - stares down at his wife and her lover through the gold net and there is grim satisfaction in his eyes. He has caught them now, and Ares feels anger and violence stirring within his veins. This is no submission, no defeat on the battlefield, no honour in this at all. This is trickery and lacks all honour, and the defeat he faces now makes him burn with anger. He must be defeated with honour, in a battle between two of equal skill, and this is neither. This is no battle, and this lacks all honour. But Aphrodite beside him is calm, only her downturned mouth a sign that her merriment is faded (and that too, he rages over, for the lack of shine in her eyes and the missing smile on her mouth). She is proud - and why not? Is this not her natural state, naked as the day she stepped from the foam of the waves, in the very act that she is Goddess of? She refuses to waver and bow her head with shame under the victory of her cunning husband. \"Have your no shame, wife?\" is all that Hephaestus says, and he looks not at Aphrodite's lover, but at the goddess alone. This is the indignity; not that Aphrodite sought Ares, but that she sought another at all, that she strayed from their marriage vows, but she never came to Hephaestus willing. She was a gift, a price to be paid to free one wife from another net that the smith had crafted with his nimble fingers and clever mind. \"Tell me husband, should love and sex and all things that fall in between be given to you alone?\" she asked him, and there was a light in her eyes again, the tip of her lips tipping upwards. \"For the sake of your shame, should I abandon my duties and let all living things slowly end for there is no love and pleasure to be spared? Should I cover my body with humiliation for what comes most natural to me, and bid my people that they must not allow their bulls to take cows for the indecency and shame of it? No,\" she continued, her voice carrying laughter and mirth. \"I think not. I do not think I shall burn with shame for a slight against you, when it is no slight against me. You may smith all you like, but am I not to practice my own skills and talents too, with such fervour and diligence? Come then, see what you have caught with your net, and see what rewards you reap with it.\" She reclined back then, stretching her body over the bed and closing her eyes, a hint of a smile upon her face. She remained in such a way, even as Hephaestus stormed from the room and called to the Gods so they might also witness what the smith god had caught himself. Ares bristled at this indignity, at the shame of being caught by a twisted version of a god, at the laughter that came when Zeus and Hermes and all of their god-kin entered the room to find him caught so, but her, not so. Shameless! Hephaestus declared to Zeus, a wanton, shameless thing you have given me as a bride! Did he not understand her, her with beauty and love like a war? She was not to be given, but to be courted, like death and happiness and all things, to be submitted to but not to expect submission from. And though Hephaestus could beat iron and bronze and all manner of metals into submission, craft statues of gold so well that they are brought to life through their likeness to reality, he could not do the same to her, not take his hammer and bend her to his will. They begged for scraps for her; they did not to expect her to wait for them. At length, the bronze net is lifted from them, and he leaps to his feet, lunging towards the smith god but it is her hand - slight and gentle - on his arm that holds him back. She brushes past them all, still naked and pale cheeked, and he watches her go, restless and chafing to follow her. The fire kindles in his veins, and there is no release for it for this time, no war to fight or love like a battle. His fingers itch to take a spear and sword and plunge them through Hephaestus' twisted foot. Instead, below them, a tribe of men go mad with battle lust. Blood spills, but it is not the golden ichor that Ares desires, but red, and all too mortal. She comes to him again, clothed in nothing, and his eyes feast on her hungrily. He has seen this form in his dreams, ached to touch it, mark it, be claimed by it. He knows every rise and slope of it in the same way that any warrior knows the feeling of his sword in his hand, the exact weight and balance of the weapon. And once again, he does not think that they ought not, only that he has thirsted for a taste of her and the pain of her wrapped around him so tightly that she might choke the life from him. But if he had thought of such things, even still he would have paid them no heed. She comes to him to take what she wants from him, and he? He will give them to her, give her hearts ripped from the chests of his conquests and cities dedicated to her glory, but all she asks is for his mouth and his body pressed against her. And he gives it to her, eagerly, passionately, in all the ways she desires and commands of him. \"My love is no man's,\" she tells him as her body claims him and their hips buck together. \"Love is mine and I am love, and I will not be owned by one.\" She is not his alone, but any part of her is worth more than none at all. He has turned mad for her, violent for her. Olympus may burn and crash if it wants, the gods who laughed at them, entrapped on a bed, sitting on their golden thrones as they crumbled into fragments, but he will not care at all for it whilst she lingers in his arms. Let the gods laugh - they do not have her in their arms, her taste on their tongues. She belongs to no one, but he belongs to her, if that's what she wants, for as long as she wants. It is his blessing that she returns to him, to share his bed and birth his children. The more she comes, the less she should be able to effect him, he thinks, in the same way that a trained soldier begins to see each blow before it comes as his training continues, but she destroys him every time. There is no resistance to her, no strategy to avoid her, only this, only her. Her taste, her touch, her body, her smile, her laugh and words and heat. It is bloodlust without the blood; just lust alone, in a woman's form, pressed against him. Teach me your ways, my love, and let me be your battlefield. Take me in victory, and let me taste how sweet defeat is when it comes from your tongue. If each act of their love is a battle, then he hopes that this war never ends. Let it span lifetimes and eons, til the fall of man is upon them and the world is wiped clean and resettled again by their creations - he will love her still. It is not his way to abandon his battles, but to see them through to bloody conclusion, and wars between two immortals may last until the world, at last, expires. And even beyond it.",

    "text": "The weather was growing cold. A wind had struck up from the west and now it howled down the narrow streets of downtown City, blasting pedestrians in the face and chilling every bared skin surface within moments. Hyacinthe pulled the collar of his jacket tighter around his neck. He should've brought a scarf--the weather had seemed nice enough when he left the warehouse, but he should've known better. Nothing stayed the same in the City--certainly not the capricious weather. He reached the end of the alley and squinted up at the sign high above. The guy that had pointed him in this direction had told him that his destination wouldn't be more than two streets down. Two streets down, however, had put him in between two dumpsters overfilling with trash. Two blocks down had put him here, where buildings loomed like gargoyles and winds ripped through the funnel-like alleys. He dug the piece of paper out of his pocket--it still said two streets down. He'd have to turn back--or find someone else to ask. If he could find someone else to-- \"Fuck!\" The guy leaning against the wall behind him, blocking his path, smiled--broadly. \"Did I scare you?\" For a moment, Hyacinthe couldn't tear his eyes off the seriously white, seriously pointy teeth of the guy. \"Yeah--yeah, I'm supposed to deliver this--do you know of...\" He consulted the packing label. \"Moment of Bliss? It's a coffee shop, I think.\" \"I know of it.\" The guy was still grinning--and it was starting to freak Hyacinthe out. \"What will you give me if I get you there?\" A chill that had nothing to do with the wind ran down Hyacinthe's back. \"Hey, man, if you don't have the time to show me, that's fine. I can get there by myself.\" He began to edge around the guy, hoping that he wouldn't do anything--pulling out a gun didn't seem that far off from what this guy would be capable of. \"I'll just go my merry way and you can continue...doing...what you...do...\" He froze beneath the hand settled suddenly on his shoulder. \"Oh, don't be in such a hurry! I'm not going to hurt you.\" Hyacinthe sincerely doubted that. He also sincerely doubted that it would help to tear loose and run. Something told him that this guy would...follow. He tried an awkward smile. \"Um, I really need to get going. I'm supposed to deliver this before five.\" \"Then you had better get going.\" The guy somehow managed to wrap an arm around Hyacinthe's waist and turn him around, sending them down an alley that Hyacinthe hadn't even noticed. \"I won't ask for something difficult, I promise.\" Hyacinthe would, in all honesty, prefer if the guy didn't ask him for anything. He forced a stumble, trying to get out of the guy's reach. The arm, however, didn't budge--if he didn't know better, he'd swear the arm was glued to his waist. The guy neatly guided him around a corner and onto a broader street that Hyacinthe quite frankly hadn't known was there. From the crowd on the sidewalks, plenty of other people knew however, and the arm around his waist had to let go of him. Driven by whatever self-preservation he possessed, Hyacinthe threw himself to the side, jumped a Rottweiler and crossed the street to the serenade of a choir of angry drivers. Safe on the other side of the street and staring the guy in the face across the busy traffic (the guy was smiling what the actual fuck), Hyacinthe realized that above the guy's head hung a large sign that said Moment of Bliss. \"...fuck my life.\" He stared down at the package miraculously still in his hands, weighed the penalty fees for not delivering against his admittedly meager bank account, and then crossed the street again. \"You should look before crossing the street,\" the guy tutted as soon as Hyacinthe was within hearing distance. \"It's dangerous to just jump into it like that, even if I'm quite impressed by your ability to dodge. That taxi was a hair's width away from running you over.\" Hyacinthe paid him no heed, keeping as many people between him and the guy as he made for the coffee store. The guy inexplicably didn't move, seemingly content to watch him, and Hyacinthe slipped through the door with a sigh of relief. He was totally calling a taxi to get back to the office. Totally. Checking over his shoulder to make sure the guy didn't follow him inside, Hyacinthe didn't notice the girl in the corner at first. She'd been singing when he first entered (something about... astronomy? Music these days was seriously weird), but when he stepped into her sight, she trailed off, eyes wide. Hyancinthe felt a flush creeping up his neck - the reaction wasn't unfamiliar, but it never ceased to make him want to hide under a table. He scurried past her as fast as he could, heading for the counter. The barista on duty was an unusually tall woman with a multitude of braids and a build that said she could easily throw you halfway down the street--coupled with the dress embellished with metal and the high heels, it was a decidedly odd look. Not to mention as far from regulation as you could come. Hyacinthe looked suspiciously at the cakes in the display window; he couldn't see anything sparkling. \"Oh, don't be a pussycat. I have an apron.\" As if wanting to make a point, the woman was tying on said apron when he looked up. \"So, what's your poison--Hyacinthe?\" Hyacinthe blinked at the expression on the barista's face. \"Do I know you?\" The apron went off again and the barista stalked off through the employee door. \"Hey! Supposedly all-knowing queen of heaven! Come look who stepped in--a bit of warning would've been nice!\" This was place was insane--or scratch that, considering the guy somewhere outside, the entire suburb was insane. For a moment, Hyacinthe considered simply dumping the package on the counter and taking off, then the most voluptuous woman he'd seen outside a porno stormed out of yet another door and grabbed him by the chin with sharp, strong fingers. \"Hyacinthe!\" she hissed. \"This--\" She caught something through the window over his shoulder. \"Hey! Outside--is that?\" The barista took a look, then swore in some language that Hyacinthe felt like he should know. \"I'll take care of it.\" She grabbed the formerly singing and now staring girl by the arm. \"You're coming with me--you should know what's at stake.\" Then the two of them were out the door. The quite frankly scary woman held his chin in a vice turning his head back and forth. \"Well, at least you've kept your looks,\" she said clinically. \"Quite nicely, really. You don't have a clue about anything, however, do you? Should be happy that the lout I'm married to didn't find you before this--you'd be bedded before you could say 'what'.\" Something unfamiliar--and yet not--rose inside him then. \"I would not!\" he snarled and stepped away. \"I wouldn't betray--\" The words melted away, however, as his mind caught up and whatever had prompted him to say that disappeared. \"At least you're loyal,\" the woman noted. \"Well, then, you may call me June. I'm the owner of Bliss.\" She nodded sharply towards a corner table. \"Now, sit down and tell me why you're here.\" That sparked the part of him that still was at work and he held out the package automatically. June's eyebrows rose, then a slow smile spread on her face. \"How amusing. I wouldn't have thought those three biddies would get themselves involved.\" Hyacinthe didn't want to know what she meant. \"Sign, please.\" June took both package and sign-off pad. \"Sit down. I'll make sure your report goes where it should.\" Then, without knowing exactly how it happened, Hyacinthe suddenly sat in the previously mentioned corner table and sipped on a vanilla caffe latte--which he didn't even like that much. He stirred the spoon--then dropped it and stood. \"What's going on?\" he demanded, stomping over to the counter. There was yet another woman there now--a girl looking as if she'd come straight from someone's hunting grounds. She looked at him. \"Sit.\" Hyacinthe meekly did as she said--those eyes had been scary. If he didn't know better, he'd say she hated him and he had never seen her before in his life. \"Tell me,\" the girl said, \"why are you here? Haven't you caused enough problems as is?\" \"What?\" Hyacinthe stared at her. \"I--I don't fucking know any of you! How can I have caused you problems?\" \"You're Hyacinthe!\" the girl hissed. \"You were born to be troublesome--if not for you, my brother would've--nothing would've turned out this way.\" \"I don't even know who your brother is!\" \"Then why come in with Zeph? You have to have come in to shove it in his face--what, did you expect him to be here? Your intelligence sucks in that case, he's not here.\" The front door bell rang. \"He will be soon.\" It was the braided woman again. \"We couldn't get a hold of Zeph--slippery guy. I almost caught him on top of the high rises, but I think he threw himself downtown again.\" \"Brother is coming?\" the girl demanded. \"Yes. We should get him out of here until we know what Zeph's up to.\" Hyacinthe didn't particularly like being referred to as he. \"I would've been gone long ago if I had my say, you know.\" The girl gave him a look. \"Shush.\" And, really, that was quite enough. When the braided woman and the girl got deeper into their argument, Hyacinthe quietly slid out of his chair and made for the second door at the other end of the shop. With the door safely closed behind him, he let out a sigh and ducked into the nearest alley after taking a quick look around for this Zeph guy. \"I really need to quit this work,\" he mumbled to himself. \"People are such weirdoes these days.\" Someone laughed them, a deep melodious laugh that made Hyacinthe's knees go slightly weak. \"Oh, it can't be that bad, surely.\" Somehow, for some reason, Hyacinthe couldn't bring himself to turn around and look at this person. There was something, something familiar, something--his heart pounded, it was hard to breathe. If he turned around--everything would change. \"It's been a strange morning,\" he said weakly. \"I can relate,\" the man said. \"I just got a... call from a person I don't get on with particularly well, saying that I should come downtown. Stranger things have happened, but--it concerned someone I once cared for... very much so.\" \"And you came?\" \"There's... some things you can't pass up on, no matter from whom you get the information.\" The man came closer; his feet scraping weirdly against the ground, as if he was trying to make sure that Hyacinthe heard him. \"It was repayment, he said, for... things.\" All of the sudden, a face flashed in Hyacinthe's mind, unfamiliar, but still familiar--and loved. \"Do you know me?\" Hyacinthe shouldn't have understood the question--the language was strange, far from anything he had heard before. He still did. \"Can you still tell that it's me without having to see my face? Do you still love me?\" Hyacinthe's head hurt--it felt like something was splitting it in half, trying to force itself to the surface of his mind. \"I know you.\" The words fell from his tongue without any input from his mind. \"I know you.\" \"Look at me.\" \"I'm afraid.\" When I loved you back then, I died for you. I don't want to die. The man behind him sighed. A moment later, a pair of hands landed on his shoulders, a warm body cradling him against it. \"Hyacinthe.\" Apollo. He closed his eyes, the floodgates open in his mind. \"I won't let you play me.\" \"Then don't. The games are over--they never end well. We have lost much power since you last walked among us. We're no longer at the height of our power--I can no longer have everything on a whim. Will you still love someone that can no longer give you everything?\" Hyacinthe tore himself lose, spun around--and was momentarily blind to everything but that face, those eyes, that beloved, dear... He closed his eyes. \"That is not why I loved you--and if you dare to insinuate it again, I'm going to hit you.\" \"Then why hesitate?\" Hyacinthe laughed--with enough bitterness it hurt. \"You gods--you're blind to mortal desires and needs. Zephyr killed me because I offered you unconditional love. What's to say that this won't happen again? I can't say that I don't love you, but I refuse to be a pawn.\" \"I can't promise anything--as you well know.\" And yes, Hyacinthe did know. It all came down to whether he wanted to give this a shot--whether he dared to risk his heart and life again for someone that could never fully understand a mortal. He opened his eyes, searched the face that had lingered in his heart even through death. Apollo simply looked back, open in a way that he had never been before. His godhood seemed diminished, though still there. The impulse to worship him was gone, however, as was the awe at the fact that this god could ever love a mortal. All that was left was the person with whom he had shared a bed, whom he had loved enough that he couldn't resent him for indirectly causing his own death. \"I'm a fool.\" Hyacinthe reached out to caress Apollo's cheek. \"Apparently I'm still your fool however.\" The smile he received in return was echoed by the sun as it pushed past the clouds above.",

      "Will you still love someone that can no longer give you everything?\" Hyacinthe tore himself lose, spun around--and was momentarily blind to everything but that face, those eyes, that beloved, dear...",
      "He closed his eyes.",

      "Apollo simply looked back, open in a way that he had never been before.",
      "His godhood seemed diminished, though still there.",
      "The impulse to worship him was gone, however, as was the awe at the fact that this god could ever love a mortal.",

      "\"I'm a fool.\"",

    "text": "They say, then and later, that madness and magic come in the month of Boedromion. The sea cooks and boils. The air singes and curls. In the nights, gods walk the earth beside men. The fair-haired goddess, laughter-loving Aphrodite, comes to her then, sitting in the courtyard, weaving with her hands as her mind flies free. She cannot see--the moon is thin--she does not need to. The goddess is clad in mist, but she shines with divine radiance nevertheless and her deep-folded mantle shivers with many-colored threads. \"Mistress goddess,\" Sappho says, \"well-met, though you were unlooked for.\" She creeps across the courtyard, that innermost nook of the house, and touches Sappho's chin, tilts it up so it catches in the moonlight. Sappho knows who she is; they have danced together at the festivals after many cups of wine. In the dark-silhouetting night, she whispers the words, \"This will be your portion: as long as they speak the name of Achilles, as long as they sing the songs of Hesiod, as long as the fame of Alkman burns bright, they will know your name, too, the only woman among so many men. And they will hymn you forever, speaking your words as talismans against their evils. Your words will always be well-crafted, and your lines will fall one to another. \"But, for this,\" the long-ankled goddess says, \"you will spend all your mortal days, which will seem long, though you humans are but short-lived, in heartache and alone. You will have no lover and no child worthy of you.\" \"And if I wish it otherwise? Would you let me trade all my winged words for a faithful love?\" \"You are not Achilles,\" the Cyprian goddess speaks in answer. \"You were not given a forked fate.\" \"And will I have a blooming husband and sticky-fingered children?\" Richly-throned Aphrodite holds up a finger and presses it to Sappho's lips. \"This, you must discover for yourself. Zeus, father of gods and men, has long held us in silence about the paths which mortal men walk.\" She pours down a warm tear, and the golden-haired goddess wipes it away. Sappho speaks then with honey-sweet words, \"But have I not always sacrificed choice victims upon your fragrant altars? Have I not burnt glistening fat and sent the smoky savor winging up to the heavens? And do I not sing your praises with my every word? And so will you grant me this one request?\" The wile-weaving goddess's eyes flash beneath her darkened brows. \"You, lovely Sappho, supplicate me in all matters of love, but I keep unkind to you. I will tell you one more thing, whatever you wish.\" \"And if it is a gift?\" \"That too will I grant you.\" \"A kiss,\" Sappho says, \"from your honey-sweet lips.\" The fair-haired goddess laughs. \"Even this, my Sappho,\" she says, \"I shall give you.\" She stoops down, towering above mortal men, and her radiance burns into Sappho like a fire catching a child's hand, held too close, and her immortal lips, red like finger-pricking roses curling in her sacred groves, press against Sappho's mouth, and the laughter echoes through her head. It is chaste, or it would be with a mortal woman, whose lips soon grow cold, but it runs through her like a bolt of lightning and leaves her heart loud thundering in her breast after. Sappho catches the goddess's gleaming-white hand. \"Patron goddess, will even this love of ours run its course and then run dry like a well in summer? Shall I end my days singing to the muse of empty river beds?\" She is like a whirlwind or a wild fire, but she stays still in that moment, stilled by Sappho's hand upon hers. \"Some wells run very deep, lovely Sappho,\" blessed Cyprian whispers, and she turns to go from there, covering her face in a veil like the star-strewn sky reaching toward Lydia. Her footsteps ring even up to the burning ether, and though she walks, Sappho must run to keep in step, catching at her many-folded veil. \"But do not leave me here alone so soon.\" The long-ankled goddess falters. Hers is not a silver tongue, for all she is a goddess of many twists and turns. \"Even as all others shall leave you, sailing to Lydia and Attica and lands far beyond, dear Sappho, so long as you burn myrrh upon my altars and send the savor of thigh bones soaring up, I will watch you as you weave at your loom, unloved and unkept, and you will wait like Penelope for the lover who never comes. You are mine, my Sappho, and I shall keep you.\" \"And will you ever come back to me again?\" Golden-haired Aphrodite traces the deepening lines of Sappho's face, her fingertips warm, and she says, \"Not soon, for I do not tread the earth lightly. But you will see me in the shadows of days and the faces of lovers and your own shimmering reflection upon the salt sea.\" She lays a hand upon Sappho's bare head, stroking her dark hair. \"But gods must not lie beside mortal women. This much I learned long ago and not easily.\" \"I would watch Troy burn and limp with both my legs for such a gift, blessed Aphrodite.\" \"But there will be no more Anchises, and even I must forsake you in this way: that you may weave your verses and run your fingers over the memory of my kiss but must lie upon your bed alone or comforted by some mortal breast. \"And there will be many cold and unfeeling shoulders to lay your sleeping head upon. But loneliness in company is lonelier still, lovely Sappho.\" And she is gone then, alone in the dark night, first of many. \"Not so lonely,\" Sappho says to unlistening air, \"for my verses will keep me warmer still, and the memories of loves lost are often sweeter, though they are tinged with bitterness.\" For laughter-loving Aphrodite is always bittersweet.",

      "\"And if I wish it otherwise?",
      "Would you let me trade all my winged words for a faithful love?\"",
      "\"You are not Achilles,\" the Cyprian goddess speaks in answer.",
      "\"You were not given a forked fate.\"",
      "\"And will I have a blooming husband and sticky-fingered children?\" Richly-throned Aphrodite holds up a finger and presses it to Sappho's lips.",
      "\"This, you must discover for yourself.",
      "Zeus, father of gods and men, has long held us in silence about the paths which mortal men walk.\"",
      "She pours down a warm tear, and the golden-haired goddess wipes it away.",
      "Sappho speaks then with honey-sweet words, \"But have I not always sacrificed choice victims upon your fragrant altars?",
      "Have I not burnt glistening fat and sent the smoky savor winging up to the heavens?",
      "And do I not sing your praises with my every word?",
      "And so will you grant me this one request?\"",
      "The wile-weaving goddess's eyes flash beneath her darkened brows.",
      "\"You, lovely Sappho, supplicate me in all matters of love, but I keep unkind to you.",
      "I will tell you one more thing, whatever you wish.\"",
      "\"And if it is a gift?\"",
      "\"That too will I grant you.\"",
      "\"A kiss,\" Sappho says, \"from your honey-sweet lips.\"",
      "The fair-haired goddess laughs.",
      "\"Even this, my Sappho,\" she says, \"I shall give you.\"",
      "She stoops down, towering above mortal men, and her radiance burns into Sappho like a fire catching a child's hand, held too close, and her immortal lips, red like finger-pricking roses curling in her sacred groves, press against Sappho's mouth, and the laughter echoes through her head.",
      "It is chaste, or it would be with a mortal woman, whose lips soon grow cold, but it runs through her like a bolt of lightning and leaves her heart loud thundering in her breast after.",
      "Sappho catches the goddess's gleaming-white hand.",
      "\"Patron goddess, will even this love of ours run its course and then run dry like a well in summer?",
      "Shall I end my days singing to the muse of empty river beds?\"",
      "She is like a whirlwind or a wild fire, but she stays still in that moment, stilled by Sappho's hand upon hers.",
      "\"Some wells run very deep, lovely Sappho,\" blessed Cyprian whispers, and she turns to go from there, covering her face in a veil like the star-strewn sky reaching toward Lydia.",
      "Her footsteps ring even up to the burning ether, and though she walks, Sappho must run to keep in step, catching at her many-folded veil.",
      "\"But do not leave me here alone so soon.\"",
      "The long-ankled goddess falters.",
      "Hers is not a silver tongue, for all she is a goddess of many twists and turns.",
      "\"Even as all others shall leave you, sailing to Lydia and Attica and lands far beyond, dear Sappho, so long as you burn myrrh upon my altars and send the savor of thigh bones soaring up, I will watch you as you weave at your loom, unloved and unkept, and you will wait like Penelope for the lover who never comes.",
      "You are mine, my Sappho, and I shall keep you.\"",
      "\"And will you ever come back to me again?\" Golden-haired Aphrodite traces the deepening lines of Sappho's face, her fingertips warm, and she says, \"Not soon, for I do not tread the earth lightly.",
      "But you will see me in the shadows of days and the faces of lovers and your own shimmering reflection upon the salt sea.\"",
      "She lays a hand upon Sappho's bare head, stroking her dark hair.",
      "\"But gods must not lie beside mortal women.",
      "This much I learned long ago and not easily.\"",
      "\"I would watch Troy burn and limp with both my legs for such a gift, blessed Aphrodite.\"",
      "\"But there will be no more Anchises, and even I must forsake you in this way: that you may weave your verses and run your fingers over the memory of my kiss but must lie upon your bed alone or comforted by some mortal breast.",
      "\"And there will be many cold and unfeeling shoulders to lay your sleeping head upon.",
      "But loneliness in company is lonelier still, lovely Sappho.\"",
      "And she is gone then, alone in the dark night, first of many.",
      "\"Not so lonely,\" Sappho says to unlistening air, \"for my verses will keep me warmer still, and the memories of loves lost are often sweeter, though they are tinged with bitterness.\"",
      "For laughter-loving Aphrodite is always bittersweet."

    "text": "\"Did you finally found him?\" Artemis smile was cold, but Apollo knows better; his sister would like to see him happy, and she been having her vengeance over Orion in his last romantic exploits. When you are a god, a few centuries of meddling is quite simple. \"I think so, but I'll go and look. Father gave me permission to court him.\" She smiles warmer now and squeezes his shoulder, leaving him to observe the young man in the shimmering pool. For centuries Apollo looked for his lover, watching in his premonitory basin, consulting the passages in the fates books, hearing the other gods stories, and walking among humans, trying to find the ones he once loved. Hades been furious with him for a long time, feeling his lot in the division of things was not being respected, after all, Apollo had transformed a good share of lovers into other beings, instead of letting their souls go to the Asphodel Fields. If he been wrong in transforming his beautiful lovers in equally beautiful beings, than he would pledge his good willing, trying to escape a new punishment by the father of all. He never cared if Zeus sent him to work among humans, because somehow he had a good share of good fate and met the noblest of men. Now he finally found one of them, his golden lover. This time he would be protected from the jealous and the harm, this time Apollo would bring him to his palace and take care of him. After he been good for two centuries, Apollo asked Zeus for a blessing: his word he would be able to court his lover if he found him and that Zephyrus would not intervene. Mortals told the story of Hyacinthus and Apollo, blaming the god of music and arts of killing his loved one. There was one, cleaver Syriac, that told the true. Zephyrus, cold hearted wind god, not having the love of Hyacinthus, blew the quoit away, hurting the fair skin of the Spartan prince. Apollo's heart still hurts when he sees the red marring the milky skin of his lover; every time he looks at one of the flowers the mortals now name after Hyacinthus, his eyes bleed. With Hyacinthus in his arms, Apollo didn't hesitate: he wouldn't let Hades claim Hyacinthus soul, so he transformed him in the whitest flower, simulating the fair skin and as the magic worked on it's on, the lament of the god wrote itself in red at the petals. Ai, ai, the buried youth grows into buds. \"I'll get you, little gold one.\" Apollo pulls himself off of the cliff border, he had been balancing his feet in the air and looking into the pool of ether he summoned; compressed ether is a good transmission medium of light, and therefore a fast way to reflect images from the mortal word. He could fly by himself or using the sun carriages, but he decided to use one of Hecate pathways. The goddess of magic had been creating paths from and through the mortal world, binding that world to Olympus and the godly homes. There weren't many worshipers in this time, the gods grew restless and traveled spreading knowledge, helping humans find ancient temples, giving inspiration to keep the olds ways alive. Apollo himself helped the artists and he been in love with the creation of one of his sons; humans called the seventh art, the moving pictures creating a simulacrum to real life. Traveling through magic meant he could use the accumulated power from the paths to conceal himself through this source of power and keep his own power guarded. Apollo smiles as he starts walking among the mortals, most don't notice him, only two children drop their gap-toothed mouths, as they see part of his true golden power. He smiles at them too, sending healing to the sickling and blessings to the unfortunate. Once he had been Apollo the plaguebringer, killing the Greeks in his fury, he always wished mortals could see diseases happen in measure with grace and that each fate will have ailments and good things. Fair Hyacinthus lives at a busy city, works all day and goes home at night to a neighbor that takes care of his son. That surprised Apollo the first time he seen his loved one, because humans tended to marry and be monogamous, trying to maintain the family lines. He walked around humans looking for the youth, but he didn't look close enough to the changes. Hermes has said Hera ran ragged this days, trying to fix broken family ties, reaching for the children that were left orphan, maybe Hyacinthus reflected the new wave of mortals behavior. Apollo sat at a table near the counter, letting himself watch Hyacinthus working for a few minutes. The youth moved effortless, the same grace he bared in his first life. One time he been so close to reaching Hyacinthus, but he had been in a promised life, choosing to live among priests. If Apollo had learned one thing in his very long and immortal life it was that you do not cross carelessly into other gods domain, especially when he wanted to hone his father into holding Zephyrus at bay. \"What can I get you today?\" Hyacinthus smiled at him, waiting to write his order or so Apollo thought. \"What do you recommend me,...?\" Apollo gave a long pause, waiting for the youth to give him his name. \"You can call me Jay, and we have very good chocolate and carrot muffins.\" Jay smile dimmed and Apollo looked puzzled, before he looked deep in the youth mind. He was cheating, Zeus wanted him to not use his power, but he needed some direction. He saw men approaching Hyacinthus, women trying to get his attention, because he had a beauty they didn't expect. All the suitors wanted to bed him, moving away as soon as they realized the youth had a small child at home and a hard past to go through. Apollo can see the deep melancholy in the honey eyes, how the youth struggles to feed himself and his offspring and how he doesn't want to be approached anymore. \"It is a pleasure to meet you, would please bring me two of those muffins and a cup of hot chocolate.\" Artemis had prohibited him of drinking the new beverage that mortals called coffee. His sister screamed that it made him more mischievous than Hermes under the heaviest nectar induced ecstasy. Hyacinthus or Jay as he was called now, nodded and went behind the counter, bustling to prepare the hot chocolate and getting the muffins from the display cabinet. When the youth came over, Apollo accepted one muffin and the hot chocolate, pushing the other at the youth with the mortal money to pay for what he had requested. Jay looked confused, until he got the meaning behind the gesture, and he tried to refuse, but Apollo touched his hand, holding their eyes together. \"Consider it a part of your tip.\" Jay nodded and Apollo got up, leaving the coffee shop. As he traveled back to Olympus, plotting their next encounter, Apollo could see the youth smiling at the muffin, and saving it in a piece of wrapping paper to take to his son. It clenches the gods heart, to see someone so young, without support. One thing he always appreciate in the time the gods were worshiped, was how the younglings were protected and nourished until they grew into citizens. He was not blind to the children working in the fields or the ones sold to slavery, he saw the times change and saw too, improves in the way mortals taken care of their young. Maybe he had grown old and tired, or as the old gods got sent to the corner of mortal preoccupations, Apollo grew detached. But he would ask Hermes and pay more attention, because he wished Hyacinthus of fair skin could let Apollo court him. \"Mortals believe in different things now, we older gods become legends and folder to new sagas. They called us fiction and it is hard to make any of them believe what we are, but it is possible, specially when they are open to alternative thinking.\" Hermes smiles at him, first kindly and then mischievous. \"Of course is always fun to make them think the gods they believe in are doing miracles or the other way, sending catastrophes to make them pay attention to what is happening around them.\" \"What about courting? How they act now?\" Apollo asks and he can see his brother holding his laughter. \"They say flirting or dating, courting isn't in fashion anymore. Of course there are books that still sell that bullshit.\" Hermes snarks and shoves a paper in Apollo's hand, moving to grab a cup of nectar. 1-Don't say you are courting him, he will be freaked out and think you are trying to kidnap him.2-Don't talk straight away about past lives, he will think you are crazy, is stalking and will call the hospice to intern you or the police to jail you.3- Don't take presents to his work.4- Don't stalk him home and give the presents there, he will tell you where he lives when he wants.5- Man that like man are called gay, they are often persecuted, so don't be overly affectionate. Let him chose to touch you.6- Don't talk about his son, not before he tells you. Mortals are very attached to their offspring, he will hunt you down.7-Don't talk about anything he hasn't told you. He will freak out!!!!! 8- Flowers, sweet things, dates to the movies, the park, to have lunch are all good ideas to win him over.9- Stay around and have patience.10- DON'T, IN ANY CIRCUMSTANCE, SING, RECITE POETRY OR MAKE ANY OF YOUR WEIRD POETRY. \"So you want me to not be me?\" Apollo asks raising an eyebrow in question. \"Yes, is basically what humans do, so you will fit right in.\" Hermes smiles again, as he vanishes in light. Apollo isn't sure if he should or not follow Hermes advice, but he also knows none of the other gods are good options. Ares and Aphrodite are always worried with themselves and each other, Hephaestus been hinting he wishes to separate definitely from Aphrodite and fearing his mother rage, went hiding. Artemis refuses to leave her vote of virginity, Athena had been trying to understand all the new architectural improvements and both of them continue to hover around each other. His father, Zeus, has all the worries of the world, rarely helps his children, Hera is still wounded by all the mortals marrying and divorcing, believing the family institution was running it's course to the end. Perhaps he could talk to one of his uncles, Poseidon and Hades been living closer to humans for centuries. Hades received all the souls and had to decided their punishment, which it meant he had to keep up with all the changes in morals, knowing how to judge them. Poseidon crossed the beaches, helped the fishermen and moved the sea waters as the mortals needed. He thinks he will bring a flower next time he goes to the cafe, perhaps it will remind Hyacinthus of his name.*** Hyacinthus is serving another table when Apollo arrives at the cafe, he sits himself near the counter again, this time in a table by the wall. The flower, he rests in the table; it is a white one, very beautiful and rigid, picked carefully in Persephone's spring garden. To Artemis deep fury, after Persephone was kidnapped by Hades, him and her had developed a good relationship: she let him work in her garden, bringing light to the Underworld and he had time to think away from Hera persistent malicious comments about his mother and all of his failed relationships. \"What can I bring you today?\" Hyacinthus asked in a low voice, his eyes nervously scanning the crowd.\"Hot chocolate and two pieces of that chocolate and almond pie, please.\" Apollo didn't say his name, nor he acted as if he had met the youth before. He did smile, but he tried to use Hermes' advice. Hyacinthus nodded and went behind the counter, Apollo could see his eyes roaming and stopping several times at the flower. This time, instead of leaving with his payed purchases, Apollo stayed, drinking the hot chocolate slowly, tasting the pie and observing how Hyacinthus relaxed while he worked. \"Can I get you another cup of chocolate?\" Apollo looked at the youth and smiled brighter, pulling the extra plate where the second piece of pie rested and giving it to Hyacinthus, now with the addition of the flower. Apollo felt pride after he left the stunned youth at the cafe, he didn't say any information the youth didn't share himself with him, but he still nudged the boy and surprised him. Next time, he could maybe bring another color of flower or maybe some other token of affection. He would try and talk more with the youth, perhaps asking him if he went to school, Persephone had told him young mortals passed a long time studying. He also felt graced by the magic in Hecate's ways, because he could see the tiny smile gracing Hyacinthus face when he put the pie in his backpack and how he smelled the flower deeply after putting it in a glass of water to make it live longer. In moments like this, Apollo felt twice as blessed. Hermes brought him a light orange hyacinth from one of his trips and Apollo tied with a silk red ribbon and laurel, to bless his loved one with winning omens. He could not change a mortal's fate, he new that, he learned the hard way how his prophecies could bring even more pain, because he could never undo them or cause them to not come true. The Redhead mortal came to serve him and while he made his normal request, hot chocolate and two sweets, he kept his eyes at the counter, willing Hyacinthus to appear. After several minutes, in which Apollo had consumed all of his food, the youth appeared: his head hung low and his eyes were rimmed red, the worst in his appearance was big bruise near his temple. Apollo flagged him, waiting for the boy to bring a second cup of hot chocolate and asking him to sit down. Hyacinthus shook his head, but the redhead woman that served Apollo before nodded at him, perhaps communicating he could sit for a moment. The first thing he does is to extend the flower, taking in how the youth's hand trembles when he takes it from Apollo's hand. Then, when he can see Hyacinthus relaxing, he pushes the second cup of chocolate and the scone he chose for today. Again the youth tries to say no, but Apollo holds firmly and urges him to eat, telling him sometimes people need sweet things in their life. Hyacinthus nods and starts to eat, in tiny bites, not looking at Apollo's eyes. He doesn't like how shy the boy is now, like his spirit have been crushed for many ailments; once Hyacinthus of Sparta held his head high and was to command one of the most powerful cities of his time. \"Do you want to talk about what happened?\" Apollo asks gently, letting Hyacinthus decide if he wishes or not to speak. \"I don't even know your name, I appreciate the flowers and the sweets, but I..\" Apollo cuts the youth, and he knows his eyes are pouring power out of them, he hopes Hyacinthus can't see. \"I'm Apollo and I only wish to see you happy. You don't need to say a word, I won't pry, but know I'll be here if you need me.\" The youth's eyes grow large, and Apollo knows he doesn't know how to react, so one more time he leaves the cafe, trying to give the boy space. It is not easy, he wishes to hold the youth, to shower him with blessings and bring him to Olympus, but he won't be impatience. He won't let Hyacinthus escape from his hands one more time. *** That bit of information makes Apollo very happy, it means his Hyacinthus is inside Jay somewhere, and while he is enjoying to meet the youth all over again,he is happy to have some recognition. Today he thinks Hyacinthus feels confused, trying to remember if he ever mentioned his son. He hardens his expression when he realizes he never spoke of Louis before, but Apollo doesn't let the youth's anger fester. \"I heard you talking to the redhead about calling home, I thought maybe you had someone waiting and decided to ask if you had a spouse or children.\" Apollo feels relieve when the youth nods, but it's taken by surprise when he asks about Apollo's own family. \"I have a big family, my father had different spouses, so I have many half brothers and sisters. Artemis is my twin sister and our mother lives far away, she doesn't like to see my father's current wife, too much bad blood between them.\" What he says it's true, and while he feels the youth wanting to ask more questions, he redirects the conversation, asking if they could meet somewhere else besides the cafe. It is not logical to ask for that at this moment, so soon after Hyacinthus tensed, but he is eager to know more, to spend more time than the crumbles they can get when the cafe is nearly empty. \"As in a date?\" Hyacinthus shakes his head and leaves the table, going back to work without other words. The few next times Apollo comes back to the cafe, Hyacinthus ignores him, doesn't take the flowers and advise everyone to not give him the second sweet, unless he finished the first and assures them he will eat any extra piece. The situation enrages him and he almost decides to stop the slow passing, revealing all of his power and snatching Hyacinthus once and for all. Artemis saves him, coming to the cafe at the exact moment Apollo's power starts to bleed and to his surprise, she doesn't join him, but sits in a bench at the counter. She waits for Hyacinthus to serve her, asking his name and tipping him and then she smiles in a predatory manner and Apollo wants to intervene. Only he knows he can't, because Artemis always gets what she wants, and the redhead woman is enchanted by her, helping her speak to his loved one. \"You see, my brother doesn't have much tact, I'm surprised he managed to hold for so long.\" Artemis smiles wickedly and looks at Apollo before turning back to the two mortals. \"I've always bested him in all arts, especially in letting people know of my affection, even when I had no interest in taking them to my bed.\" Hyacinthus flicks his gaze to Apollo and he tries to smile, knowing his face is more apologetic than anything else. Having Artemis as a sister can be challenging, but he appreciates her efforts, knowing is hard for her to speak of love, even after all this time. \"He doesn't mean you harm, he been looking for you for a long time and I know he grows anxious, but he will always respect you. \" She pauses and rests a hand in the one Hyacinthus has holding firmly the counter. \"He have been hurt many times, so many times something I feel sorry for him, even when he deserves for being a ass to me. But you see, brothers and sisters will always fight, and in a family like ours, we have to protect each other. Don't let an opportunity pass because someone else might have hurt you, the gods sometimes gives us second chances and we should use them, because they are never that nice to mortals.\" Artemis says more than she should and he hopes none of them will get in trouble with their father, but as Hyacinthus nods at him, he knows she had said the right things. He will have to make up to her, perhaps helping her mend her relationship with Athena, the both of them are stubborn enough to keep away from each other because of their pride. \"Your sister is weird, she speaks like those New Pagans.\" \"Our family comes from a place where these modern religions aren't the norm.\" Apollo doesn't say more, because he knows is not the time yet. \"When can we meet?\" Hyacinthus seems to be thinking hard, and Apollo has the feeling he is trying to chose a place that will be very public, as if he is afraid Apollo will try to harm him in a more secluded place. He asked his father to let him see who hurt the youth, but Zeus had told him to find out on it's own, without his godly powers or the help of any other god. Apollo's knows his father wants him to prove this time he is serious, because turning Hyacinthus into a godling will mean losing a lot of power; the gods weren't as powerful as before. \"Can we go to the Italian at the end of the street? I live near by and I can meet you there two nights from today.\" \"That seems perfect.\" Apollo gives Hyacinthus a toothy smile and gives the rose he brought this time. Today he wanted to bring a different flower, hoping maybe the youth would be surprised by the change. It's a good smile the one Apollo receives and it is wonderful to feel the relieve spreading from his chest through all his body. He starts to plan how to surprise Hyacinthus even more, because he wishes to move things faster, even against all the advice from Hermes, Artemis and his own head. He had been foolish before, Eros caught him by the throat and subjugated him, making his decisions hurt his loved ones and himself, but this time he will win and the madness will stay away. Athena stares at Artemis and Apollo chatting by the large garden of the Hesperides, she still doesn't understand how she started to prefer Artemis company to any other. The other gods don't seem to mind both of them are deviating from their pledges of maintaining a celibate life, but she thinks they are all tired of living their lives always the same way. To her surprise, Poseidon was the first one to approve of their relationship, calling to attention that Hestia had solicited many times to leave Olympus and she had devoted all her life to keep the fire burning. He said times were changing, faster than ever and perhaps they all should choose to live their lives as they wished, the only rule would be to not delve in mortals fates, because the Moiras preferred to live in the old ways and they should live as they wished. \"Will you join us, Athena? I'm asking advice for my date with my golden Hyacinthus.\" Apollo smiles at her and she smiles back, starting to descend the stairs to reach them. She liked Apollo's impulsiveness in war, because he had been inventive and not as destructive as Ares. They shared some spheres of power, both of them dealing with crafts, while she inspired the technique, he inspired the beauty, taking things to a new level. They both helped the young man to prepare themselves for war, he taught them how to excel in their speeches and she taught them the laws and the sense of citizenship. Most of the time she had been glad to have his company, his voice was one of the best among the gods and he sang to her, while she made tapestries to decorate her Mansion. Artemis had been a very different story, while both brothers hunted and used the bow and arrows well, the goddess was savage, running among the animals as if she was one of them. It is not easy to harmonize the city and the grove, but they try. \"Is he remembering his other life yet?\" Athena asks with curiosity, she doesn't walk with humans that are reborn, prefers to let them find new lives without more meddling. \"Not yet, but I like to have him with me.\" Apollo's smile is radiant and Athena wishes she could smile like that, unrestricted. \"We'll go on a date, Hermes helped me to understand and to taste the food we are going to eat and Artemis is helping me decide on a gift.\" \"He can't bring flowers, because he always take them when they see each other. A jewelry would scare the boy, he isn't used to receiving expensive gifts.\" Artemis puts a hand in Athena's back, holding her near, but not too close, they both aren't sure how to fit yet. \"You should sing to him, something he knows, let him request something. I never seen anyone that heard your voice and didn't felt content.\" Her voice is gentle, trying to not rise bad memories, she remembers too well of a girl that requested to hear the most beautiful song Apollo could make and had lost her hearing. \"That is a good idea, I think the restaurant has a piano, I could play too.\" Artemis drops a kiss in her cheek and Athena flushes, she knows is a thank you for helping Apollo, but the gesture warms her. They stay chatting, Apollo speaks the most, telling the things he learnt about his lover. Athena smiles brighter when he speaks of Hyacinthus son, if they come to live in Olympus, all the gods will pamper the child, it's been centuries since they had any children to play with. *** The restaurant is a canteen or so Hermes had told him, the light is dim and the chairs are all different, but the place is warm and non-threatening. He asks the waiter if he knows Hyacinthus and the man nods, replying the youth comes sometimes and that he will hurt Apollo if he so much tries to hurt him. It is refreshing to see people caring for the boy, he knows there aren't many people that make the effort. \"Where you asking Peter about me?\" Hyacinthus eyes him suspiciously and Apollo turns a guilty face to him. \"Just asked if he knew you, I was getting anxious waiting for you. Not that you took long, I think I may have gotten here early.\" \"Ok, I hope he didn't threatened you, Peter never likes people I bring here, except Louis.\" Apollo sends a questioning glance and Hyacinthus smiles shyly at him. \"That's my son, he is four now, so he can eat the food they serve here without any problem and I can actually pay attention to more than him.\" \"I'm not sure what I can or can't ask, so I'm here to listen?\" Apollo intones as a question, not sure how to leave Hyacinthus at easy and at the same time to know more of the youths life. \"I don't mind questions.\" The boys pauses and retracts. \"Well, I may not answer some things, but you can ask them, if you are willing to respond a few of mine.\" \"Alright, so, I'll take a big one out of the way. Where is the mother?\" Hyacinthus doesn't seem surprise, only resigned, but Apollo thinks he may answer this question. \"She was an older woman I met, married, though I didn't know at the time. She was rebelling while her husband was screwing other people around and when she got pregnant she panicked. \" The youth blurts it all at once, not stopping to look at Apollo. \"She told me, and I knew she regretted, because when I told her I would keep the kid, she went mad with rage. In the end, she managed to hide for a while, then she internet herself at a clinic for depression as a cover and when she was due, she made me sign the papers. I couldn't tell anyone about her being the mother and in return she would never try to take Louis back. \" \"Did her husband ever found out?\" The moment Apollo asks, he gets pinch in his heart, realizing the bruise Hyacinthus had a few weeks back had been from the man. \"He did and he punched me. Just my luck Peter came to see why were people yelling. He is the one that stays with Louis during the day.\" They both stay in silence for a few moments, until Peter comes to the table with wine and the menus for them to choose. Hyacinthus asks for his usual order and Apollo decides to ask the same, wanting to try a dish the other one likes. To break the ice, Apollo decides to tell more about his family and he realizes it is easy to tell his own story. \"My mother was one of my dad's slips and his wife wasn't gracious about it, anywhere my mom went, Hera would go and make her feel horrible; she spread lies and made people hate my mother, used her influence to make my mother feel unwelcome and my father let it, because he didn't want to make her madder. We were born outside a hospital and without much help, but since we were children we protected our mother. Hera still torments us, she hates that my father brings all his different children to their home, but he never wants to cast us away.\" \"Where are you from? It seems as if I heard your story before.\" Hyacinthus is frowning and Apollo deflects, telling about the time Artemis and their cousin stayed to play in the country and their uncle had taken her to his house. He says it in a roundabout way that he was born far away, in a place not many people knew now, and Hyacinthus seems to understand his reluctance to spill all of the details. Peter brings them bread and reveals their food should get to the table in twenty minutes. Hyacinthus talks about Louis and his face shines with happiness: he is a bright kid, always asking questions; he loves the orange color and insisted in buying too many clothes in that color; he loves to stay with Peter, but Hyacinthus knows he would like to see his father more. \"Haven't you dated before, maybe looked for a woman to fulfill the mother hole?I keep wondering if you like to be with me or if...\" Apollo doesn't continued, specially because Hyacinthus stops him, by holding his hand. \"I like you just fine, I just need to be careful, because people are not always what they show when they are trying to get me into their bed.\" Apollo feels guilt, but he tries to push the feeling away. \"I like both woman and man, thought after Louis was born I went out more with man than woman. Sometimes is easier to find men to have sex and don't worry about them wanting to go home with me. Other times the women think I'm looking for a mommy and they just want to have fun. With time I realized I shouldn't blame people for wanting a good time and nothing else, because I was looking in the wrong place.\" \"I looked forever in the wrong places, once or twice I managed to get close, but they seemed to be blow away. I, too, been with women and men.\" Apollo wonders if he should tell him about his children, but he stops himself. It is not the time. Their food arrives and Apollo notices they are having spaghetti, and he enjoys it without asking for more questions. His mind worries, because he is essentially lying to Hyacinthus. He needs to speak with Zeus, ask permission to reveal more, perhaps asking how long will he have to pretend when he is sure things won't work if he keeps with the evasions for long. They get ice cream after, and Apollo pays the bill, promising to let Hyacinthus pay the next time. He is happy when the youth leans against him and nods, telling him they got to a movie next. Apollo drops Hyacinthus by the cafe, letting him go with a kiss on the cheek. Maybe next time they will be able to kiss fully. Being in the room of the throne is an experience for any god, Zeus' power exudes around them, it is the place where the ancient power continues as strong as before, even if they perceive how it goes losing it's power millimetrically century by century. Olympus had always been a center of power, while Apollo never seen the mount before his father took the power, he knows the first creatures and monster to habit earth had already put offerings and sacrifices to his grandmother, Gaia. \"Father.\" Apollo bows, Zeus waves him in and he doesn't resembles the father that once would throw him in the air and wait for him to fly back to his lap. Right now, he is the king and Apollo knows he has to be careful. \"I would like to ask you for permission to advance my courting, Hyacinthus will grow suspicious if I continue to not tell him about my pass. He has been hurt and trust is something he gives freely.\" \"And do you think he is ready to know about your family? To understand he lives with a god and he less than us? His trust can be regained, but not his sanity. Dionysus is prohibited of helping you if the boy goes insane after looking into your true power. I told once, this is your own responsibility and I already turned a blind eye to your sister's meddling. \" Zeus voice echoes like thunder. \"I know that father, but I also know you told me I needed to do the right thing or I would lose him one more time and then Zephyrus would not be bound by his oath.\" Apollo puts himself in his knees and appeals to his father facet as a protector of the beggars. \"I only wish him to understand I don't hid from him, that I can't bring him forth. I haven't been paying attention to the changes of time and costumes between mortals, but I feel in my heart he won't understand why I kept the true from him for so long. I ask the king, were any time your queen let it slide a fault when you didn't bring her the true? Was there any time when Hera didn't punish harder because it took too long to pry the true from her king? Wasn't that her own prerogative?\" It is a gamble and Apollo may loose, but he knows king Zeus is hard, that he won't take matter of the heart above matters of the mind. He doesn't like to use Hera as his example, but he is willing if it will bring him closer to revealing himself to Hyacinthus. Zeus waves him to get up and Apollo obliges, moving closer to stand at his king's feet. \"Very well, Apollo, son of Leto and Zeus. Hecate will teach you how to bring his memories back, but you will be responsible by his welfare.\" What Zeus doesn't say is that there will be plenty of gods that want his downfall, Hera and Hades have a personal interest, but Demeter and Dionysus will not move themselves to interfere. The gods all feel their power encroaching and if one more share their power things can get unbalanced again. In the end, it is Apollo's choice, is his power to share and Zeus gave him permission. But he knows he has to be careful, corned powerful being never respond in a sane manner. As he leaves, Apollo can feel the power diminishing, is like his own power responds to the throne room. *** Hyacinthus leans against him, when they have a break between two of the movies, and turns his chin in his direction. The youth smiles softly and let's their cheek rub against each other, before pressing his lips to Apollo's. The kiss develops, Hyacinthus hands framing his face and their panting breaths mingling. He is the one to stop the kiss, catching his breath and asking if Hyacinthus is ok. He receives a nod and Apollo is instantly relieved. They watch another movie, hands holding the whole time and it is very nice. Again, Hyacinthus doesn't let Apollo take him home, but he kisses Apollo more in front of the cafe and his redhead co-worker, Halleigh, keeps whistling from inside. *** \"My family believes in the old ways, and they really see the newer religions as anything than strange cults.\" The boy hums and asks why his family all has greek myths names, which makes Apollo freeze. \"I just think is a bit weird, is like you live this whole separate life from everyone. I've seen witches wannabe and people that love Percy Jackson or that simply like literature, but your name is Apollo, that's...\" Hyacinthus doesn't seem to find the right words and Apollo squeezes his hand. \"Would you give me a free pass for this question? I promise to answer it, just not today?\" The youth nods and Apollo sighs, leaning to caress his face. He has Zeus permission, but he is still mindful of his father warning; Zeus words were double edged, a bit of his father, a bit of the king's words. Apollo shoves the spoon in his mouth and almost gag when he realizes it was empty, at least he wins a loud laugh. It's one of his favorites smiles, losing only for the found smile Hyacinthus get when he speaks about his son. Apollo eyes are popping from the sockets as he watches Hyacinthus and a little boy coming in his direction. They decided to walk in the park, since the Sunday morning promised to be a sunny one. Louis stops in front of him and gives him a toothy smile, before he gestures with one finger for Apollo to bend down. When the god does, Louis gives a kiss to his cheek, after saying very lowly, so his father doesn't hear: \"You hurt him, I bang you.\" The boys eyes are sparkling with mischief and Apollo sees Hermes in the boys face, if Hyacinthus accepts him, he knows his brother will love the kid. \"Cross my heart I don't want to hurt him.\" Apollo says it in a murmur, trying to avoid Hyacinthus from hearing, but when the youth looks at him, the god knows he isn't successful. Big trees surround them and give a nice shade to walk in, Apollo could redirect the sun or diminish it's rays, but he won't play with the weather for no reason. He sees that Louis is suffering with the heat, and that his steps are more sluggish after a few minutes into their walking. So he pulls him up, so rest in his shoulders and while the boy grumbles and tries to kick his face, much to Hyacinthus amusement, he keeps a firm hold, letting the wind gently brush against the boy, to ease his discomfort. \"My daddy said you went to watch his favorite movie.\" Louis asks if he liked and Apollo nods. \"Why?\" \"She loved her family very much and she wanted to take care of them, even after she wasn't with them anymore.\" Apollo doesn't say anything about death, but Louis grins at him. \"You can say she died, daddy says death is just a part of life.\" Louis says it smugly, showing his tongue, as if to say he is mature enough to know this things. Hyacinthus smiles at them both and Apollo thinks he said the right thing; the movie was quite depressing, but he could see why the boy loved the movie. It was about someone that wanted to live her life as best as she could, because she was going to die soon, but she also wanted to take care of her family and so she had left letters, found a wife to his husband, and gave some hope to her lover. Apollo could identify with her loyalty and persistence. All through the day, he keeps trying to make the boy happy, buying him sweets and playing with him. Sometimes the boy gives him a weird look and Apollo wonders if he sees the small use of power he been channelizing to make both Louis and Hyacinthus safer and happier. Kids are more sensitive, they see things adults don't and sometimes they can recognize the gods. They sit under a tree, Louis crawls in his lap, still suspicious of him. He is not surprise when Louis asks him about the glowing yellow stuff around him, but he tries to access what Hyacinthus is thinking first. The youth looks shocked, as if he receive a piece of information missing and Apollo immediately recognizes the course of memories crossing in his loved one's eyes. Afraid of making things worse, but knowing he needs to harness the power, Apollo touches the boy, pulling him close to his own body. Through this action he locks Louis between them and the boy struggles to get free and understand what is happening to his dad. Apollo raises a barrier between them and the rest of the people, not wanting to draw attention to the power he knows will start to leak. Past life magic is a powerful one, and he needs to guide Hyacinthus back to him. He chants, singing and pouring his power into the song, making his voice into a path, guiding Hyacinthus as Ariadne once guided Theseus. The light around them gets brighter and Louis silences himself, as if his own energy slowly trickles, after fighting against Apollo's chest. Hyacinthus keeps watching the same scene, over and over, his own dead imprinting in his eyes. \"Loved one, please, hear my voice.\" Apollo kisses his forehead and tries to show how it can be, pushing the image of Hyacinthus and Louis is Apollo's Mansion, the three of them playing together and the sound of laughter echoing through the halls. \"Daddy.\" Louis eyes are trickling with tears and his voice is raspy, so Apollo holds his hand, trying to comfort him. It is then that Hyacinthus opens his eyes. Louis holds his dad hand, because it is glowing. There are many people around them, and they seem to now Mr. Apollo. People in the park aren't looking at them and Louis wants to know why, after all shouldn't people be worried someone lay in the floor, sick? \"Don't worry kid, blondie knows how to heal people.\" A man with red hair smiles at Louis. \"I'm Artemis, Apollo's sister and this is Ares, our part sibling. Are you feeling alright?\" Artemis sits by his side and puts a hand in Louis shoulder, leaning against him. \"Your dad is just resting, there is a lot of power when mortals remember past lives.\" \"Huh?\" Louis looks at the lady and she smiles at him, bringing closer to her. \"Do you believe in god?\" Louis nods and Artemis continues to speak. \"A long time ago people believed in gods, plural, so there was a god to take care of each part of the world. You saw part of Apollo's power, since he takes care of the sun, his power glows bright; he can heal and he is protector of the artists.\" \"Are you crazy, Mrs. Artemis? Daddy says we can say people are crazy, but well, they teach us in church that there is just one god.\" Louis still looks confused, so Artemis calls for a deer, he leaps from inside a tree, transforming in front of Louis eyes. \"Ow.\" \"I live in the forest and all savage creatures can come to me, Ares here takes care of war and all soldiers.\" Louis looks up at the man and he can see how strong he is, so he just nods. \"What is going on with my daddy?\" \"He absorbed a lot of power, but he should wake up soon. Your dad met Apollo a long time ago, so long he had several lives until he got to this one and now my brother has permission to turn your dad an you, if you want in gods like us. You will live forever.\" \"But what will be my power? Can I be the god of candy?\" Louis smiles and then snorts. \"Dad should be the god of coffee.\" Artemis smiles at him and nods him to look at Hyacinthus looking at them. \"For Zeus, I can't believe you waited so long.\" Hyacinthus seems to finally awake, before he had opened his eyes more than once. \"Are you staying, I can't live my life and Louis, we...\" Apollo cuts him, pulling his face for a kiss, all his face expression of pure relief. \"If you accept, you will be one of us, but we can live anywhere, do whatever you and Louis decide. I just don't, ever, to lose you again.\" Hyacinthus nods, and pulls Louis to his lap. \"I know this doesn't make sense, but\" \"It's ok, Mrs. Artemis told me we can be like them and I called first to me the God of Candy.\" This time is Hyacinthus that snorts and kisses Louis head. Ares hums and they all get up, the gods eyes are fixated in a portal opening close to the barrier Apollo created. Through it pass Hera and Zeus, after them Leto, both Apollo and Artemis move to flank her, bringing Hyacinthus and his son to stand behind her. Ares sticks by his mother and when she starts to speak, he holds her arm silencing anything she would like to say to Leto and her children. Zeus approaches them, touching Hyacinthus head and then Louis, his power changing them. To Louis it feels like his whole body is being tickled, so he giggles and his dad hugs him against his body. Zeus steps away and Apollo thanks him, bowing. Hera smirks at them, but Leto snaps her finger and a muzzle appear in her face, making Zeus eyebrows go up and Ares smiles thinly, but doesn't lets go of his mother. \"I think we can all go and celebrate in your Mansion son, Hera should go and meditate, so she can clean her mind of dirty thoughts.\" Leto smiles down and turns to Louis. \"I think we can do a great party, I heard something about a god of Candy?\"Louis excited yips covers Hera's muffled curses. Zeus and Ares expertly take her, while Apollo embraces Louis and Hyacinthus. As they travel to Apollo's Mansion, Hyacinthus talks about wanting to continue living in his apartment, but his eyes bug and his mouth drops as he sees the endless fields that surround the green Mansion. He can imagine Louis running around and him reading while he watches. \"Don't worry, we can come back, it will be as if we blink an eye.\" Hyacinthus smiles as they are finally happy and together.",

      "Apollo's heart still hurts when he sees the red marring the milky skin of his lover; every time he looks at one of the flowers the mortals now name after Hyacinthus, his eyes bleed.",
      "With Hyacinthus in his arms, Apollo didn't hesitate: he wouldn't let Hades claim Hyacinthus soul, so he transformed him in the whitest flower, simulating the fair skin and as the magic worked on it's on, the lament of the god wrote itself in red at the petals.",
      "Ai, ai, the buried youth grows into buds.",
      "\"I'll get you, little gold one.\"",
      "Apollo pulls himself off of the cliff border, he had been balancing his feet in the air and looking into the pool of ether he summoned; compressed ether is a good transmission medium of light, and therefore a fast way to reflect images from the mortal word.",
      "He could fly by himself or using the sun carriages, but he decided to use one of Hecate pathways.",
      "The goddess of magic had been creating paths from and through the mortal world, binding that world to Olympus and the godly homes.",
      "There weren't many worshipers in this time, the gods grew restless and traveled spreading knowledge, helping humans find ancient temples, giving inspiration to keep the olds ways alive.",
      "Apollo himself helped the artists and he been in love with the creation of one of his sons; humans called the seventh art, the moving pictures creating a simulacrum to real life.",
      "Traveling through magic meant he could use the accumulated power from the paths to conceal himself through this source of power and keep his own power guarded.",
      "Apollo smiles as he starts walking among the mortals, most don't notice him, only two children drop their gap-toothed mouths, as they see part of his true golden power.",
      "He smiles at them too, sending healing to the sickling and blessings to the unfortunate.",
      "Once he had been Apollo the plaguebringer, killing the Greeks in his fury, he always wished mortals could see diseases happen in measure with grace and that each fate will have ailments and good things.",
      "Fair Hyacinthus lives at a busy city, works all day and goes home at night to a neighbor that takes care of his son.",
      "That surprised Apollo the first time he seen his loved one, because humans tended to marry and be monogamous, trying to maintain the family lines.",
      "He walked around humans looking for the youth, but he didn't look close enough to the changes.",
      "Hermes has said Hera ran ragged this days, trying to fix broken family ties, reaching for the children that were left orphan, maybe Hyacinthus reflected the new wave of mortals behavior.",
      "Apollo sat at a table near the counter, letting himself watch Hyacinthus working for a few minutes.",
      "The youth moved effortless, the same grace he bared in his first life.",
      "One time he been so close to reaching Hyacinthus, but he had been in a promised life, choosing to live among priests.",
      "If Apollo had learned one thing in his very long and immortal life it was that you do not cross carelessly into other gods domain, especially when he wanted to hone his father into holding Zephyrus at bay.",
      "\"What can I get you today?\"",
      "Hyacinthus smiled at him, waiting to write his order or so Apollo thought.",
      "\"What do you recommend me,...?\"",
      "Apollo gave a long pause, waiting for the youth to give him his name.",
      "\"You can call me Jay, and we have very good chocolate and carrot muffins.\"",
      "Jay smile dimmed and Apollo looked puzzled, before he looked deep in the youth mind.",
      "He was cheating, Zeus wanted him to not use his power, but he needed some direction.",
      "He saw men approaching Hyacinthus, women trying to get his attention, because he had a beauty they didn't expect.",
      "All the suitors wanted to bed him, moving away as soon as they realized the youth had a small child at home and a hard past to go through.",
      "Apollo can see the deep melancholy in the honey eyes, how the youth struggles to feed himself and his offspring and how he doesn't want to be approached anymore.",
      "\"It is a pleasure to meet you, would please bring me two of those muffins and a cup of hot chocolate.\"",
      "Artemis had prohibited him of drinking the new beverage that mortals called coffee.",
      "His sister screamed that it made him more mischievous than Hermes under the heaviest nectar induced ecstasy.",
      "Hyacinthus or Jay as he was called now, nodded and went behind the counter, bustling to prepare the hot chocolate and getting the muffins from the display cabinet.",
      "When the youth came over, Apollo accepted one muffin and the hot chocolate, pushing the other at the youth with the mortal money to pay for what he had requested.",
      "Jay looked confused, until he got the meaning behind the gesture, and he tried to refuse, but Apollo touched his hand, holding their eyes together.",
      "\"Consider it a part of your tip.\"",
      "Jay nodded and Apollo got up, leaving the coffee shop.",
      "As he traveled back to Olympus, plotting their next encounter, Apollo could see the youth smiling at the muffin, and saving it in a piece of wrapping paper to take to his son.",
      "It clenches the gods heart, to see someone so young, without support.",
      "One thing he always appreciate in the time the gods were worshiped, was how the younglings were protected and nourished until they grew into citizens.",
      "He was not blind to the children working in the fields or the ones sold to slavery, he saw the times change and saw too, improves in the way mortals taken care of their young.",
      "Maybe he had grown old and tired, or as the old gods got sent to the corner of mortal preoccupations, Apollo grew detached.",
      "But he would ask Hermes and pay more attention, because he wished Hyacinthus of fair skin could let Apollo court him.",
      "\"Mortals believe in different things now, we older gods become legends and folder to new sagas.",
      "They called us fiction and it is hard to make any of them believe what we are, but it is possible, specially when they are open to alternative thinking.\"",
      "Hermes smiles at him, first kindly and then mischievous.",
      "\"Of course is always fun to make them think the gods they believe in are doing miracles or the other way, sending catastrophes to make them pay attention to what is happening around them.\"",
      "\"What about courting?",
      "How they act now?\"",
      "Apollo asks and he can see his brother holding his laughter.",
      "\"They say flirting or dating, courting isn't in fashion anymore.",
      "Of course there are books that still sell that bullshit.\"",
      "Hermes snarks and shoves a paper in Apollo's hand, moving to grab a cup of nectar.",
      "1-Don't say you are courting him, he will be freaked out and think you are trying to kidnap him.2-Don't talk straight away about past lives, he will think you are crazy, is stalking and will call the hospice to intern you or the police to jail you.3- Don't take presents to his work.4- Don't stalk him home and give the presents there, he will tell you where he lives when he wants.5- Man that like man are called gay, they are often persecuted, so don't be overly affectionate.",
      "Let him chose to touch you.6- Don't talk about his son, not before he tells you.",

      "\"So you want me to not be me?\"",
      "Apollo asks raising an eyebrow in question.",
      "\"Yes, is basically what humans do, so you will fit right in.\"",
      "Hermes smiles again, as he vanishes in light.",
      "Apollo isn't sure if he should or not follow Hermes advice, but he also knows none of the other gods are good options.",
      "Ares and Aphrodite are always worried with themselves and each other, Hephaestus been hinting he wishes to separate definitely from Aphrodite and fearing his mother rage, went hiding.",
      "Artemis refuses to leave her vote of virginity, Athena had been trying to understand all the new architectural improvements and both of them continue to hover around each other.",
      "His father, Zeus, has all the worries of the world, rarely helps his children, Hera is still wounded by all the mortals marrying and divorcing, believing the family institution was running it's course to the end.",
      "Perhaps he could talk to one of his uncles, Poseidon and Hades been living closer to humans for centuries.",
      "Hades received all the souls and had to decided their punishment, which it meant he had to keep up with all the changes in morals, knowing how to judge them.",
      "Poseidon crossed the beaches, helped the fishermen and moved the sea waters as the mortals needed.",
      "He thinks he will bring a flower next time he goes to the cafe, perhaps it will remind Hyacinthus of his name.*",
      "** Hyacinthus is serving another table when Apollo arrives at the cafe, he sits himself near the counter again, this time in a table by the wall.",
      "The flower, he rests in the table; it is a white one, very beautiful and rigid, picked carefully in Persephone's spring garden.",
      "To Artemis deep fury, after Persephone was kidnapped by Hades, him and her had developed a good relationship: she let him work in her garden, bringing light to the Underworld and he had time to think away from Hera persistent malicious comments about his mother and all of his failed relationships.",
      "\"What can I bring you today?\" Hyacinthus asked in a low voice, his eyes nervously scanning the crowd.\"Hot chocolate and two pieces of that chocolate and almond pie, please.\"",
      "Apollo didn't say his name, nor he acted as if he had met the youth before.",
      "He did smile, but he tried to use Hermes' advice.",
      "Hyacinthus nodded and went behind the counter, Apollo could see his eyes roaming and stopping several times at the flower.",
      "This time, instead of leaving with his payed purchases, Apollo stayed, drinking the hot chocolate slowly, tasting the pie and observing how Hyacinthus relaxed while he worked.",
      "\"Can I get you another cup of chocolate?\"",
      "Apollo looked at the youth and smiled brighter, pulling the extra plate where the second piece of pie rested and giving it to Hyacinthus, now with the addition of the flower.",
      "Apollo felt pride after he left the stunned youth at the cafe, he didn't say any information the youth didn't share himself with him, but he still nudged the boy and surprised him.",
      "Next time, he could maybe bring another color of flower or maybe some other token of affection.",
      "He would try and talk more with the youth, perhaps asking him if he went to school, Persephone had told him young mortals passed a long time studying.",
      "He also felt graced by the magic in Hecate's ways, because he could see the tiny smile gracing Hyacinthus face when he put the pie in his backpack and how he smelled the flower deeply after putting it in a glass of water to make it live longer.",
      "In moments like this, Apollo felt twice as blessed.",
      "Hermes brought him a light orange hyacinth from one of his trips and Apollo tied with a silk red ribbon and laurel, to bless his loved one with winning omens.",
      "He could not change a mortal's fate, he new that, he learned the hard way how his prophecies could bring even more pain, because he could never undo them or cause them to not come true.",
      "The Redhead mortal came to serve him and while he made his normal request, hot chocolate and two sweets, he kept his eyes at the counter, willing Hyacinthus to appear.",
      "After several minutes, in which Apollo had consumed all of his food, the youth appeared: his head hung low and his eyes were rimmed red, the worst in his appearance was big bruise near his temple.",
      "Apollo flagged him, waiting for the boy to bring a second cup of hot chocolate and asking him to sit down.",
      "Hyacinthus shook his head, but the redhead woman that served Apollo before nodded at him, perhaps communicating he could sit for a moment.",
      "The first thing he does is to extend the flower, taking in how the youth's hand trembles when he takes it from Apollo's hand.",
      "Then, when he can see Hyacinthus relaxing, he pushes the second cup of chocolate and the scone he chose for today.",
      "Again the youth tries to say no, but Apollo holds firmly and urges him to eat, telling him sometimes people need sweet things in their life.",
      "Hyacinthus nods and starts to eat, in tiny bites, not looking at Apollo's eyes.",
      "He doesn't like how shy the boy is now, like his spirit have been crushed for many ailments; once Hyacinthus of Sparta held his head high and was to command one of the most powerful cities of his time.",
      "\"Do you want to talk about what happened?\"",
      "Apollo asks gently, letting Hyacinthus decide if he wishes or not to speak.",
      "\"I don't even know your name, I appreciate the flowers and the sweets, but I..\"",
      "Apollo cuts the youth, and he knows his eyes are pouring power out of them, he hopes Hyacinthus can't see.",
      "\"I'm Apollo and I only wish to see you happy.",
      "You don't need to say a word, I won't pry, but know I'll be here if you need me.\"",
      "The youth's eyes grow large, and Apollo knows he doesn't know how to react, so one more time he leaves the cafe, trying to give the boy space.",
      "It is not easy, he wishes to hold the youth, to shower him with blessings and bring him to Olympus, but he won't be impatience.",
      "He won't let Hyacinthus escape from his hands one more time.",
      "*",
      "** That bit of information makes Apollo very happy, it means his Hyacinthus is inside Jay somewhere, and while he is enjoying to meet the youth all over again,he is happy to have some recognition.",
      "Today he thinks Hyacinthus feels confused, trying to remember if he ever mentioned his son.",
      "He hardens his expression when he realizes he never spoke of Louis before, but Apollo doesn't let the youth's anger fester.",
      "\"I heard you talking to the redhead about calling home, I thought maybe you had someone waiting and decided to ask if you had a spouse or children.\"",
      "Apollo feels relieve when the youth nods, but it's taken by surprise when he asks about Apollo's own family.",
      "\"I have a big family, my father had different spouses, so I have many half brothers and sisters.",
      "Artemis is my twin sister and our mother lives far away, she doesn't like to see my father's current wife, too much bad blood between them.\"",
      "What he says it's true, and while he feels the youth wanting to ask more questions, he redirects the conversation, asking if they could meet somewhere else besides the cafe.",
      "It is not logical to ask for that at this moment, so soon after Hyacinthus tensed, but he is eager to know more, to spend more time than the crumbles they can get when the cafe is nearly empty.",
      "\"As in a date?\"",
      "Hyacinthus shakes his head and leaves the table, going back to work without other words.",
      "The few next times Apollo comes back to the cafe, Hyacinthus ignores him, doesn't take the flowers and advise everyone to not give him the second sweet, unless he finished the first and assures them he will eat any extra piece.",
      "The situation enrages him and he almost decides to stop the slow passing, revealing all of his power and snatching Hyacinthus once and for all.",
      "Artemis saves him, coming to the cafe at the exact moment Apollo's power starts to bleed and to his surprise, she doesn't join him, but sits in a bench at the counter.",
      "She waits for Hyacinthus to serve her, asking his name and tipping him and then she smiles in a predatory manner and Apollo wants to intervene.",
      "Only he knows he can't, because Artemis always gets what she wants, and the redhead woman is enchanted by her, helping her speak to his loved one.",
      "\"You see, my brother doesn't have much tact, I'm surprised he managed to hold for so long.\"",
      "Artemis smiles wickedly and looks at Apollo before turning back to the two mortals.",
      "\"I've always bested him in all arts, especially in letting people know of my affection, even when I had no interest in taking them to my bed.\"",
      "Hyacinthus flicks his gaze to Apollo and he tries to smile, knowing his face is more apologetic than anything else.",
      "Having Artemis as a sister can be challenging, but he appreciates her efforts, knowing is hard for her to speak of love, even after all this time.",
      "\"He doesn't mean you harm, he been looking for you for a long time and I know he grows anxious, but he will always respect you. \"",
      "She pauses and rests a hand in the one Hyacinthus has holding firmly the counter.",
      "\"He have been hurt many times, so many times something I feel sorry for him, even when he deserves for being a ass to me.",
      "But you see, brothers and sisters will always fight, and in a family like ours, we have to protect each other.",
      "Don't let an opportunity pass because someone else might have hurt you, the gods sometimes gives us second chances and we should use them, because they are never that nice to mortals.\"",
      "Artemis says more than she should and he hopes none of them will get in trouble with their father, but as Hyacinthus nods at him, he knows she had said the right things.",
      "He will have to make up to her, perhaps helping her mend her relationship with Athena, the both of them are stubborn enough to keep away from each other because of their pride.",
      "\"Your sister is weird, she speaks like those New Pagans.\"",
      "\"Our family comes from a place where these modern religions aren't the norm.\"",
      "Apollo doesn't say more, because he knows is not the time yet.",
      "\"When can we meet?\"",
      "Hyacinthus seems to be thinking hard, and Apollo has the feeling he is trying to chose a place that will be very public, as if he is afraid Apollo will try to harm him in a more secluded place.",
      "He asked his father to let him see who hurt the youth, but Zeus had told him to find out on it's own, without his godly powers or the help of any other god.",
      "Apollo's knows his father wants him to prove this time he is serious, because turning Hyacinthus into a godling will mean losing a lot of power; the gods weren't as powerful as before.",
      "\"Can we go to the Italian at the end of the street?",
      "I live near by and I can meet you there two nights from today.\"",
      "\"That seems perfect.\"",
      "Apollo gives Hyacinthus a toothy smile and gives the rose he brought this time.",
      "Today he wanted to bring a different flower, hoping maybe the youth would be surprised by the change.",
      "It's a good smile the one Apollo receives and it is wonderful to feel the relieve spreading from his chest through all his body.",
      "He starts to plan how to surprise Hyacinthus even more, because he wishes to move things faster, even against all the advice from Hermes, Artemis and his own head.",
      "He had been foolish before, Eros caught him by the throat and subjugated him, making his decisions hurt his loved ones and himself, but this time he will win and the madness will stay away.",
      "Athena stares at Artemis and Apollo chatting by the large garden of the Hesperides, she still doesn't understand how she started to prefer Artemis company to any other.",
      "The other gods don't seem to mind both of them are deviating from their pledges of maintaining a celibate life, but she thinks they are all tired of living their lives always the same way.",
      "To her surprise, Poseidon was the first one to approve of their relationship, calling to attention that Hestia had solicited many times to leave Olympus and she had devoted all her life to keep the fire burning.",
      "He said times were changing, faster than ever and perhaps they all should choose to live their lives as they wished, the only rule would be to not delve in mortals fates, because the Moiras preferred to live in the old ways and they should live as they wished.",
      "\"Will you join us, Athena?",
      "I'm asking advice for my date with my golden Hyacinthus.\"",
      "Apollo smiles at her and she smiles back, starting to descend the stairs to reach them.",
      "She liked Apollo's impulsiveness in war, because he had been inventive and not as destructive as Ares.",
      "They shared some spheres of power, both of them dealing with crafts, while she inspired the technique, he inspired the beauty, taking things to a new level.",
      "They both helped the young man to prepare themselves for war, he taught them how to excel in their speeches and she taught them the laws and the sense of citizenship.",
      "Most of the time she had been glad to have his company, his voice was one of the best among the gods and he sang to her, while she made tapestries to decorate her Mansion.",
      "Artemis had been a very different story, while both brothers hunted and used the bow and arrows well, the goddess was savage, running among the animals as if she was one of them.",
      "It is not easy to harmonize the city and the grove, but they try.",
      "\"Is he remembering his other life yet?\" Athena asks with curiosity, she doesn't walk with humans that are reborn, prefers to let them find new lives without more meddling.",
      "\"Not yet, but I like to have him with me.\"",
      "Apollo's smile is radiant and Athena wishes she could smile like that, unrestricted.",
      "\"We'll go on a date, Hermes helped me to understand and to taste the food we are going to eat and Artemis is helping me decide on a gift.\"",
      "\"He can't bring flowers, because he always take them when they see each other.",
      "A jewelry would scare the boy, he isn't used to receiving expensive gifts.\"",
      "Artemis puts a hand in Athena's back, holding her near, but not too close, they both aren't sure how to fit yet.",
      "\"You should sing to him, something he knows, let him request something.",
      "I never seen anyone that heard your voice and didn't felt content.\"",
      "Her voice is gentle, trying to not rise bad memories, she remembers too well of a girl that requested to hear the most beautiful song Apollo could make and had lost her hearing.",
      "\"That is a good idea, I think the restaurant has a piano, I could play too.\"",
      "Artemis drops a kiss in her cheek and Athena flushes, she knows is a thank you for helping Apollo, but the gesture warms her.",
      "They stay chatting, Apollo speaks the most, telling the things he learnt about his lover.",
      "Athena smiles brighter when he speaks of Hyacinthus son, if they come to live in Olympus, all the gods will pamper the child, it's been centuries since they had any children to play with.",
      "*",
      "** The restaurant is a canteen or so Hermes had told him, the light is dim and the chairs are all different, but the place is warm and non-threatening.",

      "It is refreshing to see people caring for the boy, he knows there aren't many people that make the effort.",
      "\"Where you asking Peter about me?\" Hyacinthus eyes him suspiciously and Apollo turns a guilty face to him.",
      "\"Just asked if he knew you, I was getting anxious waiting for you.",
      "Not that you took long, I think I may have gotten here early.\"",
      "\"Ok, I hope he didn't threatened you, Peter never likes people I bring here, except Louis.\"",

      "I couldn't tell anyone about her being the mother and in return she would never try to take Louis back. \"",
      "\"Did her husband ever found out?\"",
      "The moment Apollo asks, he gets pinch in his heart, realizing the bruise Hyacinthus had a few weeks back had been from the man.",
      "\"He did and he punched me.",
      "Just my luck Peter came to see why were people yelling.",
      "He is the one that stays with Louis during the day.\"",

      "Hyacinthus asks for his usual order and Apollo decides to ask the same, wanting to try a dish the other one likes.",
      "To break the ice, Apollo decides to tell more about his family and he realizes it is easy to tell his own story.",
      "\"My mother was one of my dad's slips and his wife wasn't gracious about it, anywhere my mom went, Hera would go and make her feel horrible; she spread lies and made people hate my mother, used her influence to make my mother feel unwelcome and my father let it, because he didn't want to make her madder.",
      "We were born outside a hospital and without much help, but since we were children we protected our mother.",

      "\"Where are you from?",
      "It seems as if I heard your story before.\"",
      "Hyacinthus is frowning and Apollo deflects, telling about the time Artemis and their cousin stayed to play in the country and their uncle had taken her to his house.",

    "text": "Peter was believed to be the most beautiful man on Earth, possibly even the most beautiful man in the universe. This was his burden, though, because no one dared think they were worthy of him, and so he was very alone. His friends, Johnny Storm and Mary Jane were lovely themselves, although they possessed nothing near Peter's beauty, and had committed relationships that Peter envied. Still, he did not hold any hard feelings toward those friends he loved, and they looked over him the best they could. They comforted him when the emotional isolation was crushing but friendship can only do so much. Despite knowing the loneliness that Peter felt, Loki was jealous of him. He thought of himself as the most beautiful man not only in the 616, but in the whole multiverse. How could everyone speak so highly of this lesser creature while he was around?! Loki set his mind to ridding the world of Peter's boyish good looks so he hired a mercenary named Domino to kidnap him and tie him to train tracks, classic evil villain style. Domino was to make sure the train had finished the job, but she couldn't stay because Cable had space worms in his brain and they had to travel to 1964 immediately for some reason, so Loki sent his son, Wade, to see the murder through. Peter laid on the tracks, immobile, crying and cursing Loki, and then cursed himself for being born so beautiful. He cried long after Domino had left and then into an exhausted sleep, which is when Wade found him and the moment his eyes fell on Peter he knew he was in love. How could Wade kill such a magnificent creature? How could he kill the man he knew now he was in love with? Wade took Peter to his home, ordered Bob (his manservant) to look after him, and never to tell him this was Wade's home, or that Wade had saved his life, or that it was Wade who joined him each night in bed. And so it was, each night in the pitch black, Wade would join his love in bed, refusing to revile himself, even as they made love. Peter was overwhelmed with gratitude for his rescue and the royal treatment showered upon him by his shadowy savior, but died to see his lovers face. It didn't matter to him who he was, because he had fallen in love with the being who held him each night, who was the only person he had ever known intimately, but he wanted to know the face in which kissed him with such passion and yet reverence. He wanted to commit it to memory that figure's details so he could imagine him with him even during the day. But Wade refused. After not too long, Peter asked his lover if he could see his friends, for he didn't know where he was and couldn't go to meet them. Wade agreed but reminded him, he couldn't see his face, so not to let Peter's friends convince him of trickery. Peter promised him he wouldn't betray his love, and Wade had Peter's friends brought to their home the next day. Johnny Storm and Mary Jane eagerly came and were astonished by the wealth in which Peter was now living, and upon hearing of his lover were beside themselves with curiosity, concern, and perhaps jealousy? Peter told them of his experience but cut himself short as he was about to admit he was suspicious that his lover wanted to remain hidden because of scars Peter had felt on his body. It didn't matter then, when they were together, but for some reason now Peter felt embarrassed to tell his beautiful friends that the man he had fallen for might be too hideous to see in the light. \"What if he is some rogue Doombot? Some sentient sex doll version?\" Johnny asked. \"I don't care, I love him. Besides, I have felt every inch of his body and there are no mechanical parts.\" Mary Jane snorted. \"You think that's all that he should worry about?\" she gave Johnny a side eye. \"You said this guy saved your life and is keeping you in this mansion, and you haven't ever SEEN him? That shit's crazy balls. This has Lifetime movie written all over it.\" Peter swallowed hard. Could she be right? He had never questioned his lover...he couldn't fathom this wonderful man was any sort of bad seed! Had love blinded him? Perhaps the scars weren't the only thing that was being hidden? \"Let's google the most wanted list, and you can find some way to see this guys face tonight. If he doesn't look like any of the criminals, alright, but if so...\" Mary Jane's voice trailed off. \"There are no lights in the bedroom, even the windows are shuttered so no moon light can come in...How can I find a way to see his face?\" Peter asked. Johnny reached into his messenger bag and pulled a flash light out, \"use this.\" \"Why do you carry a flashlight?\" Mary Jane asked. \"I can't always get my flame up...\" That night Peter waited in his bed for his lover, the photos of all the criminals running through his mind... He didn't believe his lover's face could match any of those, but his beloved friends had put too much logic into their argument... Soon he felt the familiar body slip into bed next to his, and Peter let the worries that had been plaguing him slip away as they made love. When Peter felt his love fall into a deep sleep he carefully got into the night stand and held Johnny's flashlight above the other man's head. And he turned it on. No, this wasn't one of those criminals. This was the man he was in love with. Skin gnarled from scars Peter had felt night after night but was too scared to ask about and was too selfishly embarrassed to mention to his friends. But he wasn't a monster; he was beautiful with those long eyelashes that had fluttered over Peter's sweat soaked skin, those plump lips that brought so much pleasure, and that trickling drool that was somehow simultaneously gross and very adorable. Peter was so taken by the sight of his lover that the flashlight slipped from his grasp and fell into the sleeping figure's temple, waking him immediately. \"Y-You promised!\" Wade cried, after the painful cry subsided. \"I trusted you!\" Before Peter could plead for forgiveness or convince him to over look this, his lover had taken off. Peter tried to chase after but was tangled in blankets; bound to the bed, alone once again. But Peter wasn't going to give up on the only love he had ever known, he would find him, and it wouldn't be hard...He knew who his mystery lover was. He was Deadpool. Loki's son. Wade ran from Peter, knowing that now that he had been seen, their relationship was over. He wasn't worthy of someone such as Peter, and Loki would never allow Peter to live. With no other alternative he returned to Loki and tried to cover his tracks... He told Loki Peter had died by the train and the reason for his absence was a two-for-one deal at Tacos Tacos Tacos. There was no evidence of Peter's death, he said. The train was powerful, he said. It must've been created by S.H.I.E.L.D or A.I.M or some other abbreviation, he said. Loki trusted and was thankful to his son. That was, Until Peter had come requesting a visitation with him. Loki met with Peter, who fell to his knees in tears immediately. \"Please, I know you don't like me, but please show me some mercy. I've never done anything to you, and I've fallen in love with Wade. I can't live without him and I hate being murdered; please let us be together, I beg you.\" Loki was in no way willing to let this pathetic creature have his son, but he also wasn't going to kill someone with his own hands, that was so pedestrian...so he offered a challenge, if Peter could pass a test he could have Wade. Peter agreed without hearing the conditions. \"You must bring me Thor's hammer,\" Loki said smugly, knowing that this task was impossible. Defiant, Peter said it would be done but the moment he started the quest his heart grew heavy; Loki himself had attempted to take Thor's hammer and many times and was never able, what chance did Peter have? It was well known that only the most worthy could wield the hammer and Peter in no way qualified, he literally made deals with devils, Loki being just one of them. Before Peter could send any deeper into misery, Thor appeared from the nearest Starbucks. \"Man of spiders,\" Thor greeted heartily, \"moping as usual, I see. May I assist you?\" Peter couldn't help but laugh bitterly, \"not unless I can have your hammer.\" \"Then have it you shall!\" Thor tossed his beloved hammer and Peter, almost knocked down by shock alone, somehow caught it. \"I have no need of it anymore; I've been sold to a Japanese company and they are retconning my entire persona. From now on I gain my power from pretty brunettes that shall adorn my head which will turn me into the most magical girls. Truth be told,\" Thor said conspiratorially, \"I much prefer the barrettes. Do with the hammer what you wish, it's useless now... Although it still summons lightning.\" Suddenly it did just that and Peter lost consciousness. When he opened his eyes Wade was upon him. Literally all up on him. \"Wade!\" Peter cried, sinking his head into Wade's neck. \"I' m so sorry I didn't keep my promise, I would have never done it if I knew it would take you from me! I want to make it right, I've been trying to!\" \"My sweetie Petey! Let's get married on Genosha.\" \"What about Loki?\" Peter belatedly remembered as he noticed Wade had holstered the prize hammer Peter had lucked into. Wade made a farting sound from his mouth (at least, Peter hoped it was from his mouth.) \"I don't even think he's my real father and for some reason he's a kid now. And I totally saw him fuck a horse once.\"",

    "text": "Eurydice shivered in her thin shift. Why hadn't she thought to bring something warmer? But it was warm up there where she came from, that was one thing they'd never lacked for. You could whistle in the wind for a decent wage or even a meal in your belly, sure, but heat and dust didn't cost you a penny. But now here she sat, in the back seat beside the man who'd promised her gold and all the food she could eat until her belly couldn't take any more. Down in Hadestown was the land of honey and milk, she'd heard it, and he'd said it was so, with his dark smooth voice like oil on water. And she'd been so very hungry. His coach was like him, with its black leather and gleaming metal, and she felt like it'd swallowed her whole. They sped down, down into the dark of the earth. At the gate, the growl of the watchdogs shook the air, black shapes half-glimpsed, with the ruff of their necks bristling and their eyes glinting in the light. Eurydice shrank back in the seat. The driver stopped, and the watchdogs quieted to the touch of their master's hand. Hades tweaked the ears of one. \"Good boy,\" he rumbled. The hound growled and lowered its head in submission. The wall of Hadestown stood before them, and they drove through the gates, thick and black and bristling with razor wire. People looked up as they passed, their pale faces turned up like night-blooming flowers, but the coach sped by too fast to make them out. The coach pulled up. \"Well, little songbird. This is my palace.\" Hades pointed to it with a flick of his thick fingers. But Eurydice didn't see it--she couldn't look away from him. How would the price be reckoned? She hadn't asked. Would he take her into his bed with its silken sheets and fuck her? Would he lay her there and press her down with that heavy well-fed body, taking whatever price he wanted? She shuddered. She'd done a lot to keep from starving. Stealing, sure. She'd done that plenty of times. You had to eat, and if people who had food didn't want to share it, then worse luck to them. But she hadn't never sold her body for it. Well, maybe that was just because she'd never yet been hungry enough. And maybe she wouldn't get the choice, now. And oh, Orpheus--but no use thinking of him, now. She swallowed, looking at the heavy bulk of Hades, the glint of his eyes. He seemed to know what she was thinking, because he smirked at her, one corner of his mouth lifting in a sardonic smile. \"Come on then, little bird. Come in and meet my wife.\" The breath went out of her. Not that kind of price, then. He laughed and chucked her under the chin. \"I think she'll like you.\" And oh, but his wife was beautiful. She was the most elegant thing Eurydice had ever seen: slim, but not like she'd ever known starving, with smooth olive skin that hadn't lost its color even underground. Eurydice wanted to touch her silk dress, run her fingers along it, if she hadn't been afraid she'd get it dirty. And her mouth was red, so red and full and flush with life. Hades pulled his wife in with a hand around her waist, kissed her on that red mouth. \"See what I found, my Persephone. Look at the little songbird I caught up above.\" Persephone tilted her head to one side, ran a hand down Eurydice's cheek to her neck. It raised goosebumps on her, that finger. So warm, it was, and she stood still and shivered. \"Lovely,\" Persephone said. Her voice was low and smooth like dark honey. \"But so thin. We must feed her, don't you think?\" \"I did promise her a feast,\" Hades said, sounding amused. And such a feast it was. She sat down with them at a table, with Hades at the head of it and Persephone at his right side, and Eurydice at his left. \"Now eat your fill,\" Hades said, and servants began to carry in dishes. Servants! They looked much finer than her, and they moved smooth and graceful, and did not meet her eyes. But she didn't think of that long, because before her lay the feast: olives, both black and green; soft creamy cheese; bread, not the coarse dark bread she was used to, but white bread with a golden crust, steaming and warm when she broke it. There was rich red wine. There were plump little birds, roasted whole and stuffed with grain, and pork ribs sizzling with fat. There were sweet almond cakes dripping with honey, and every kind of fruit: delicate peeled grapes, oranges that had ripened in the sun, peaches with soft rose-colored skins, and dark red pomegranate seeds. Eurydice ate. She tried not be vulgar, seeing how the lord and lady took dainty little bites. But she could not help sucking the fat and the honey from her fingers. She needed it, oh, how she needed it. \"Careful,\" Persephone murmured. \"Don't eat too much.\" But Eurydice couldn't help it--she was used to snatching all the food she could, and she wasn't about to stop now. You never knew when you'd eat again. When she couldn't eat one single thing more, she looked up to find them both looking at her, the lady no less than the lord. \"Had your fill?\" Hades said. \"Yes, my lord,\" she said. \"Thank you.\" \"Let's see if she'll sing for her supper, then,\" he said to Persephone. \"What do you say? Would you like her to...sing...for us?\" \"I don't have much of a voice,\" Eurydice said. Though it wasn't her voice they were talking about, was it? \"Oh, I think you do,\" he said. Eurydice looked at Persephone, trying to plead with her eyes. Maybe, if it'd been just the lady, she wouldn't fear it so much. But Hades, no, she couldn't bear the thought of him touching her, the darkness in his eyes, the sardonic laugh. She shivered with cold, just thinking about it. Why had she ever left the warmth of the sun? Persephone's eyes were dark, too, but it was a different darkness. Her full red lips curved upwards, and she said, \"No, I think we'll let her go. Songbirds don't sing well in cages, after all.\" \"Very well, my love,\" Hades said. Eurydice stared at him. They'd let her go? Really? \"You think her merciful,\" Hades said to Eurydice. His voice rumbled deep in his chest like gravel. \"You'll find it isn't so--she belongs to the underground as much as I do. But we'll let you go, then, and you'll pay the price another way.\" Eurydice drew in a breath. \"Yes, of course,\" he said, his smile widening, baring teeth. \"You didn't think all this would come free, would you? We're not a charity down here, after all.\" Ten minutes later, the gates of the palace shut behind her with a solid clang. It was cold and damp. Above her, a black so deep she might forget the stars were ever there, up above in the world she came from. The only light was the lamp over the gate. \"But--where do I go?\" she asked the guard who'd taken her out. \"Barracks,\" he said. \"Down the road. There's one for the women on the right hand side, and you can start work in the morning.\" \"Work?\" she asked. \"Look, girl, just go. The bosses will tell you what to do in the morning,\" he said, not unkindly. Eurydice went. Persephone had thrown her a cloak as a farewell gift, and she clutched it tightly around herself as she made her way down the road. She was barefoot, and the gravel was cold, and rough even on her toughened soles. She felt sick to her stomach with the feast she'd eaten, and she hadn't walked more than a couple of hundred feet when she was forced to bend over and hurl it all up, all the rich food her stomach couldn't take, not when she'd gone hungry for so long. The blood rushed to her head, and she panted, her stomach cramping again. She braced herself with her hands on her knees and wiped her mouth. It tasted sour. Nothing for it but to go on. There was one dim lamp outside the barracks, and Eurydice knocked on the door. A stout hard-eyed woman opened. \"Look, it's past curfew. What are you doing out?\" \"I'm new. I was told to go here?\" The woman sniffed. \"From the upside, are you? Well, we'll see if you can do any work.\" \"I can work,\" she said. It didn't sound so bad, did it? Honest work, and an honest wage at the end of the day. She'd heard this was a good place, after all, and it couldn't all be lies. \"Right, then. Go on in--there should be a spare mattress in there somewhere.\" The room was dark, and she stumbled over something first thing. \"Uh?\" a sleepy voice mumbled. \"Watch where you're going.\" She stood still while her eyes got used to the dark, with the dim light shining in through a small window. The floor was covered with sleeping figures on mattresses, and she picked her way between them until she came to an empty one. Lying there swept in the cloak Persephone had given her, she shivered a little. It was cold, and the cloak wasn't enough, not really. What had she done? There was no getting back through those gates, with the razor wire, the growling guard dogs. The massive wall. Last night she'd slept in Orpheus' arms. Slept poorly, sure, with her stomach aching with hunger, but twined together, they'd slept warm even under the stars. Laughing, carefree, happy-go-lucky Orpheus, who thought a song could fix their every problem. And yes, it was true: his voice was like nothing else she'd heard, and she couldn't keep her eyes off him when he sang. Or her hands either, afterwards. But it just wasn't enough. You couldn't live like that, from day to day, never knowing when you'd get any money or food or a roof over your head. She'd had to do it, hadn't she? Well, she'd made her bed and now she'd have to lie in it. Eurydice finally dropped off, from sheer exhaustion if nothing else, but it felt like she'd only slept a minute or two before a loud voice woke her. \"Get up, there! Time for work. Don't laze around!\" Eurydice groaned, sat up, and rubbed at eyes that felt like they had sand in them. Damn it, she was still exhausted. All around her, women were getting up, grumbling like her, but getting dressed and ready. \"You! You're the new one, right?\" Eurydice looked up to see the stout woman from yesterday. \"Yes.\" \"Well, we'll get you some gear. You'll need boots, and something more to wear. And a pick, of course.\" She blinked. \"All right.\" It struck her that she didn't know what the work would be, down here, but she supposed she'd find out. The boots she got fit all right, and seemed stout enough. Besides that, she got a pair of trousers and a shirt, both obviously worn by someone else before, but still whole, and a pick-axe. Perhaps this all came with the job--she hoped so. The woman seemed to know what she was wondering. \"Don't think you're getting this for free--it'll come out of your pay, if you don't have any money. Which your lot usually doesn't.\" She sniffed. \"Thank you, ma'am.\" It seemed best not to provoke her. \"Well, of with you now, so you don't miss the train.\" It turned out to be an actual train, with people cramming into the open train cars, men and women both, lit by lanterns, their faces shadowed. Eurydice jumped up into one car, and stood there while the train wheels squeaked to life with the sharp smell of heated metal and they were off. \"Where's the work? Where are we going?\" she asked a woman beside her. The woman raised her eyebrows at her. \"You new?\" Her clothing was worn out and torn in several places. \"Yes.\" \"Well, we're going down.\" \"We're already in the underground, aren't we?\" \"Sure. But every year it goes deeper. We follow the gold, and there's none left up here.\" \"Gold?\" She gave a sound that might have been a laugh. \"Don't you even know what we're here for? Gold. We mine the gold for Hades.\" And the train was going down, for sure. She'd lost all sense of direction but that: the brakes squealing, the hairpin turns, all going down, down, down into the darkness. The train ground to a stop, and the crammed bodies began to get out, the movement transplanting through the living crowd until it reached her, and she got out, steadying herself on the cold metal of the train car. \"Right! You fill these cars up,\" a voice shouted, and she followed the tide of people. It didn't look like gold, what they hauled back to the train cars. Not that there was much light to see by, but it just looked like rock to her. \"Is this really gold?\" she asked the man beside her. \"Sure,\" he said, wiping the sweat off his brow. \"But it's gold ore, not gold outright. You got to do something to it, melt it down, to get the gold out.\" \"Oh,\" Eurydice said. Somehow she'd imagined the gold running in butter-yellow veins through the rock, shining in the lamplight. She snorted at her own dreams. Might as well have imagined the gold coins falling right into her hands. It was back-breaking work. Before long, the skin of her hands was sore, and her shoulders ached with it. She started taking less of a load, and trying to dawdle a bit on the way back. \"Hey, you!\" a guard shouted, shoving at her. \"Do your share!\" Eurydice bit her lip. She didn't think talking back would help her, and she picked up her pace a bit. But then she saw one of the other women glaring at the guard. \"Don't let him get to you,\" the woman muttered at her when they'd gotten out of sight of the guard. Eurydice impulsively reached out to squeeze the woman's hand. \"Thanks,\" she said. Just a word of simple human decency, but it meant so much. It almost made the load lighter. Almost. On the next round, she happened to glance up, and saw, of all things, a bird cage hanging up there from the damp uneven rock. A songbird sat in it. She stopped and stared. It wasn't singing--who would, down here?--but it sat there, drab and brown and preening its feathers with its beak. The person behind her bumped into her. \"Hey, what's the hold-up?\" \"What is that? The bird? Why's it down here?\" \"Oh, that? That's to see if there's any mine gas down here. The bird would die first, if there was.\" He shrugged. \"We'd die, too, probably, but it's something.\" *** That night Eurydice was bone-tired. She ate the food that was ladled out to them (docked from their pay, of course). She supposed it was all right. A feast, she would've said, before she'd eaten at Hades and Persephone's table. She tasted bile in her mouth, thinking of that feast. She slept like the dead that night. Next morning, the boss-woman's voice woke her and she scrunched her eyes against the sudden light. It was all to do again, the back-breaking work, and this time with her whole body sore from the day before. You could do more than you thought you could, Eurydice learned. After a while the aches just seemed like the way things were. She learned the names of her bunk-mates, learned which ones would give you a helping hand and a smile, or keep a look-out for when the bosses were cracking down extra-hard, and warn you. Most were decent folks. Some were petty, or would try to get more than their share, or would tell on you if you slacked off. But not many were like that. Still, the work filled her world. There wasn't any space left to think, and Orpheus seemed so very far away. He was up in the sunshine, somewhere. She barely remembered the sunshine. \"Hey, you coming along to get some moonshine?\" one of the other women asked her, after they ate one night. \"Moonshine?\" The moon seemed very far away, too. Or maybe she meant the other kind of moonshine. Of course she did. \"I heard the Lady's setting up shop tonight. Down by one of the warehouses.\" So after lights-out they sneaked out, between the warehouses full of gold ore until they got to one where light and music stole out between the cracks. Inside it was warm and smoky, with a press of people, still grimy from the workday, but so was she, so she didn't care. And there she was, the Lady--behind the bar, handing out drinks. Eurydice couldn't take her eyes off her, she looked so fine. Hair black and glossy, cut short to end above her smooth neck. Slim, and elegant, and her mouth curved as she smiled and looked over the crowd. Eurydice held her breath, but the Lady's gaze just slid right over her. She wasn't nothing special, after all. \"Thinks she's something,\" one of the women with her muttered. \"I'm sure not turning down her drinks, though,\" one of the others said. They elbowed their way through the crowd to reach the bar. The Lady did see her, then, and she leaned in close. \"Songbird,\" she murmured. \"So you're here.\" The others looked sideways at her, and Eurydice felt herself flush. She didn't want to be singled out. But the Lady remembered her, after all. \"Today the Upside's coming Down,\" Persephone said, smiling. \"What's your poison? Sunshine or moonshine?\" \"Sunshine,\" Eurydice whispered, thinking about the summer heat, and how she missed it, after all. \"Sunshine it is,\" Persephone said, pouring something in a glass for her. \"On the house.\" She poured for the other two as well. Eurydice lowered her eyes in confusion and took a sip, just for something to do. And oh, but it was like sunshine: strong and sweet and warm. She took another sip, hungry for it, drawing it out. She looked up, to catch the Lady looking at her, something wistful in her eyes. \"Thank you,\" she said. \"You shouldn't thank me,\" Persephone said with a wry smile, and turned away to serve someone else. \"You know her?\" one of her friends said skeptically. Eurydice shook her head. \"No. I surely don't. She just...saw me when I first came in from the Upside. Didn't think she'd remember.\" Later, when they'd gone back to the barracks for some sleep before the next workday, she dreamed. She dreamed of the Lady under the sunlight, in the green grass of spring. She kissed Eurydice on the lips. The dream melted away when she woke, leaving only the sweet taste of honey in her mouth. *** There was a riot a few days after that. Eurydice didn't see it start, but she heard about it afterwards, that it began with someone being short-changed on the ore they'd brought in. The scales weren't fair, they said. She could believe that. She didn't see much of the actual fighting, either, but they called the guards away from her barracks, and she and some of the others got into the kitchen while they were gone. Eurydice went to sleep that night with a full belly, at least. The next day, she heard that someone over in the next barracks had got their arm broken in the fighting, and that he'd been taken away. Couldn't work with a broken arm. They whispered about it, when the guards didn't hear. What happened to him? Some said he got sent to the Upside again. Some whispered that he was fed to the hounds. They'd heard them howling in the night, at the gates. *** When Orpheus came, she only knew about it when they sent for her. Down in the mine, guards moved among the workers, asked people's names, made their way finally to her. \"Eurydice,\" she said warily, when they asked her. \"That's her,\" one of them said, taking hold of her arm. What did they want? \"Where are you taking her?\" one of the other workers said, taking a step closer to her. \"None of your business,\" said the guard, shoving the other woman away. \"Get back to work, now.\" They dragged her off, took her up the long way from the bottom of the mine, up to Hades' palace. And there he was: her Orpheus. Their eyes met across the wide polished floor, and she drank in the sight of him like he was the sun itself. He stared back at her, and in his eyes she saw how thin and pale and dirty she must look to him. \"Well, then,\" Hades voice rumbled behind her. She started, turned around. She'd hardly seen he was there. \"Here she is, your little songbird. Take her; she's yours,\" Hades continued with an expansive gesture. What? They were just going to let her go? Orpheus looked confused, too, but he covered it, bowing his performer's bow. \"Thank you, Lord.\" \"On one condition,\" Hades said, his voice low and smooth. \"You'll have to trust me. Don't turn to look behind you. She'll be there, but you can't look at her.\" Orpheus' brow furrowed, as Hades held out a paper and a pen. \"Sign it.\" He did, and Hades took the paper back, smirking. As if he needed a piece of paper to get what he wanted. He waved his hand at Orpheus. \"Start walking. She'll be right behind you.\" Orpheus gave her one last desperate look--they'd hadn't even talked to each other--and started walking, slowly. Hades leaned down to hiss in her ear. \"Whatever you do, don't say anything. The hounds will be there, watching. If you do...\" He let his voice trail off. Eurydice glanced around him, at the Lady, tried to plead with her with her eyes. What was going on? The Lady was watching them, her lips pressed together. \"Hades--\" she said, stepping towards them. \"You've done quite enough already,\" Hades said, his voice a warning. The Lady shut her mouth. \"Now go,\" Hades said, pushing Eurydice towards the palace door. Eurydice went. Orpheus was ahead of her, walking slowly, and she caught up, then kept carefully behind him. The guards let them through the gate in the wall, and after that, the hounds began to pace them silently. She glanced behind once, caught a glimpse of dark fur and teeth, and then turned forward again. Nobody said she couldn't look behind, but she didn't want to. \"Eurydice?\" Orpheus said. \"Are you there?\" She heard the hounds padding behind her, said nothing. \"Eurydice? He said I couldn't look, but there's nothing says I can't talk to you, right?\" No, nothing. But she couldn't talk back. Goosebumps rose on her neck, and she wanted to walk faster, except then she'd overtake him. It seemed like it took forever, that long walk up the train tracks with the hounds breathing behind her. Orpheus kept talking, and Eurydice clenched her teeth at at the way he sounded, more and more desperate with every switchback of the tracks. And he turned to look, at last. Of course he did--he'd always needed her like that, needed her to smile at him in the audience, needed her touch and her words and her reassurance. Damn him. Eurydice stared at him, at the betrayed look on his face as the hounds surged up to separate them as neatly as sheepdogs divided a flock. \"No!\" he cried. Eurydice said nothing. She thought she could almost see daylight up there, at the end of the tunnel. She almost didn't know what was hardest to lose: Orpheus, or that warm sunlight on her skin. It made her angry, that she was betraying him in her heart like that. Well, he'd betrayed her. Why couldn't he have held out just a little bit longer? Why? The walk down again was long, and her feet hurt. *** Everyone in her barracks knew what had happened, more or less. Talk got around. \"Some singer he must be, to get the boss' heart soft like that,\" one woman said to her. \"He is,\" Eurydice said. \"'Course, the boss wouldn't really let you go, would he? He rigged the game.\" Eurydice shrugged. \"I guess so.\" \"But at least you had a shot at it. I heard it was the Lady got him to do it,\" another one said. The first one scoffed. \"She's as bad as he is. What, you think just 'cause she sells us some moonshine now and then, she's on our side?\" She shook her head. \"Living it up in that palace, eating peeled grapes or something.\" There really had been peeled grapes at the feast in the palace, Eurydice remembered. \"Oh, come on. You think she has a choice, really? You think he doesn't keep her there just as surely as he's keeping us?\" \"So I'm supposed to be sorry for her, sleeping on silk sheets while we're down here working for hardly any pay?\" Eurydice shivered. She'd had that choice, and she'd said no. Of course, she hadn't known exactly what she was choosing between. She thought she'd still make that same choice, though. *** Eurydice heard about the plans for the revolt before it happened. It spread in whispers in the cover of night, in the barracks. Sometimes down in the mine during the workday, too, when the guards were away. She didn't know all of it, just bits and pieces, and she didn't know if anyone did know it all, though there must've been plans for a long time. It began with a deep, rumbling boom that shook the ground beneath them. \"Oh, the idiots,\" the woman beside her said. \"They blew the gate?\" another one said. \"Yeah, must be. Sure hope it doesn't bring the whole mine down.\" Eurydice looked up at the ceiling. She had to fight down panic before she could listen to what else was going on. \"Come on,\" someone was saying, tugging at her sleeve. And then they were all running, not towards the gate, but towards the palace. Where were the guards? Eurydice couldn't see any--maybe they'd gone to the gates, maybe someone else was fighting them somewhere. People had whispered about the palace, about all the money Hades must have there. The money that should be theirs. Eurydice agreed, sure, but she wasn't going to stick her nose out for it. Not with all the guards around. But now here she was, running with the others. The woman beside her grinned at her, looking crazy, or happy, and Eurydice felt an answering madness rise inside her. She ran, out of breath and with her heart pounding, and strangely elated. At the palace, people were already fighting with the guards. Nobody could be in charge of this chaos, not on either side: someone lying on the ground, a guard, with dark blood on his head; a man turning, too late, to meet a blow, and falling; a woman using a shovel to beat at a guard who was already down. Everything sharp and clear, in bits and pieces. \"Hades! Hades! We want Hades!\" people were shouting. There were a lot more of them than there were guards. A guard came near her; she ran. She didn't have a weapon. \"Hey, the back door is down! Come on,\" someone she half-knew shouted beside her. More confusion inside. Corridors, rooms, people running past them with loot: golden plates, velvet clothing, food, bottles of wine. Some looked like they were drunk, or maybe that was just the excitement. Some of the looters had guard uniforms on. A band of men who looked like they had a purpose strode past. \"Hades is gone!\" they said to her group. \"We can't find him anywhere!\" \"We haven't seen him either,\" one of the ones with her said. Eurydice ducked into an empty room, to catch her breath and to get away from all the noise and confusion. She leaned her forehead against the cool door, closing her eyes. A noise behind her, and she startled, her heart pounding. She'd thought the room was empty! For a long moment, Eurydice met the dark eyes of the Lady from the wardrobe where she'd been hiding, and neither of them moved. \"Are you going to turn me in?\" the Lady said at last, quietly. Eurydice opened her mouth, closed it. She thought of what people had said, about the Lady being as much to blame as Hades. Well, maybe not as much, but if Hades was gone, people might want someone else to blame, and it could turn ugly. She held the Lady's gaze, thought of the sunshine she'd swallowed down. \"No,\" she said, or tried to say. Her throat was dry, and she cleared it. \"No,\" she said again, stronger. \"But--where's Hades?\" The Lady shrugged, a small tired movement of her shoulders. \"He wasn't here when the mob came. I don't know where he is.\" She might be lying, Eurydice supposed. But she didn't want to think so. \"Doesn't he want you with him?\" The Lady shrugged again. She didn't look so fine anymore, not like a high lady. She looked like anyone, even though her clothes were still fine and her skin wasn't roughened with work. Some of the surety was gone from her face, leaving uncertainty instead. \"Come on,\" Eurydice said, without thinking too much about it. \"I'll help you out of here.\" The Lady took a breath. \"How? People will recognize me.\" \"We need to get you out of those clothes. People won't look twice at you then.\" \"All right, then.\" The Lady seemed to gather her wits. \"The servants' quarters. Maybe I could find something there.\" Eurydice remembered the fancy servants who had served at the feast. Well, she supposed there must be kitchen servants as well, and people who swept the floors, and so on. \"Stay here,\" she said. \"I'll go get some clothes.\" The Lady bit her lip and nodded. \"All right. Thank you,\" she said. Eurydice got the directions and went, dodging more looters. The servants' quarters were mostly abandoned, and nobody looked twice at her when she ran back with a bundle in her arms. She passed the kitchens, grabbed some food and a cloth to carry it in: a loaf of bread, not the fancy kind they'd eaten at the feast, but darker bread for the servants, and a round cheese, and some dried figs. The floor of the kitchen was sticky with sauce and something else, spilled on the floor. \"Here,\" she told the Lady, thrusting the bundle of clothes at her. The Lady glanced at her, then set her jaw and began to strip out of her fine clothes. Eurydice looked away, only glanced at her enough to see glimpses of her smooth olive skin. \"Ready,\" she said, straightening. In the drab clothes of a kitchen worker, she still looked like herself. \"You should cover your hair,\" Eurydice said, taking the shawl she'd brought and wrapping it around the Lady's long black hair, so that it shadowed her eyes. \"Better. Come on, let's go.\" \"Where?\" \"To the upside,\" she said, without thinking. \"I'm not staying down here--I want to see the sunshine again.\" The roof of stone weighed down on her, even inside the palace. \"I do, too,\" the Lady whispered. And they went. *** The wall wasn't just cracked, it was broken wide open, and a steady stream of people were picking their way through it. Stone rubble and razor wire were strewn around it, from the explosion she'd heard earlier. Eurydice wondered where the hounds were, if they'd been blown up, too, or if they were still here somewhere. She shivered. They started up the long track to the upside, dark now. The lights up there had blown with the explosion. But some people had torches, enough to see by, a little. It had been late when the riots started, and Eurydice was bone tired, the dregs of her earlier excitement making her feet drag like lead. She couldn't walk all the way, not like this. The Lady, beside her, was stubbornly keeping up, but Eurydice could tell she was flagging, too. Nobody had known her, not in her servants' clothes. \"Want to stop for the night?\" she asked. \"Where?\" the Lady asked. \"Just--by the roadside, I guess. I think we're pretty close to the upside, but I can't go on much longer.\" She'd taken a blanket from the palace when they left, for warmth. They found a little alcove that hadn't been taken by anyone else yet, and Eurydice spread the blanket out and lowered herself down to the rocky floor, wincing at the ache in her calf. She'd hit it somehow. There was a group a bit further up, a man and two women. They had a fire going, from railroad ties that they'd pulled out from under the tracks. The faint flickering light fell on the Lady's face. She looked drawn and tired. Eurydice got the food out, broke the bread, and they ate hungrily. The man came over, hesitated, then asked. \"You got some food to spare?\" Eurydice looked up at his face. She thought she knew him, a bit, from her shift, though she wasn't sure. She nodded, tore off half the loaf of bread. \"You got a knife, I'll cut you off some of the cheese.\" He took one out, and she did. \"Thanks,\" he said. \"You can share the fire, if you want.\" It was cold, and Eurydice did want, but--they might recognize the Lady. \"Thanks. We got blankets, though.\" \"All right.\" He went back to the other group. After they ate, they lay down to rest. The stone floor was cold and uncomfortable, though there was enough blanket to go underneath them and over them both, if they pressed close. She felt the strong beating heart of the Lady, felt her warm breath. Somehow she hadn't thought of her like this, like just another body you could touch. \"Where do you come from, Lady?\" she whispered. The Lady shifted against her. \"No, don't call me that. I'm Persephone.\" \"Persephone,\" Eurydice whispered. \"Where do you come from?\" Silence, and Eurydice thought she might not get an answer. Then, \"The Upside.\" \"So does everyone.\" \"I suppose.\" Persephone glanced over towards the fire, then came closer, put her mouth by Eurydice's ear. She could feel Persephone's breath against it as she whispered low. \"I wasn't always--his lady. My mother is a farmer. Her name is Demeter. She has a big farm, and grows things like grapes and oranges, not just grain and potatoes. She sold food to Hades.\" \"And Hades saw me in the garden, and he wanted me like he wanted the fruit. I was--young. Not that I'm old now, but this place doesn't let you stay young. And I came with him.\" Did she come of her own free will, Eurydice wondered, or not? Of course, she'd gain now by making it seem like she wasn't on his side at all and never had been. Eurydice shook her head, to try to get the thought out. This tangled suspiciousness, she didn't want it. She wanted to believe her. \"What?\" Persephone asked, at her movement. \"Did you love him?\" Eurydice whispered. Silence, again. At last, Persephone shrugged. \"What does that mean? I loved him. I didn't love him. At least I could spread a little sunshine even down here in the mine. But my mother didn't approve. She had a lot of influence, among the other farmers, and she got it so that I had to come back half of each year, or they wouldn't sell the food to him. And that half year--I needed it. It was how I stayed alive down here, how I could do even the little that I did.\" Eurydice could feel all the places that they touched. She was warm, there, like the sun was shining on her, and she didn't even mind the hard stone floor underneath her. She held her breath, curled her fingers around the curve of Persephone's waist to hold her closer. And Persephone settled into her with a sigh. \"And you?\" Persephone asked. \"How did you end up here?\" \"Maybe not so different from you, really. He talked to me, and he told me things were different down here, that it was the land of plenty. And I was hungry.\" \"Of course you were,\" Persephone whispered. \"Tell me about where you come from,\" Eurydice said, wanting to think about something else. \"Tell me about your mother's gardens.\" \"She grows grapes,\" Persephone said, her voice low in Eurydice's ear. \"They hang in dark heavy clusters when they're ripe. You can fill both hands to overflowing with them, and when you put one in your mouth they'll burst with a sweetness you can't imagine when you're down here.\" Eurydice made a small noise of longing, and her hand tightened around Persephone's waist. \"I'll take you there, when we get to the upside. The farm is in a valley, like a cup between the hills. The sun shines down on it like honey. I used to climb the fruit trees when I was a child, sitting there among the white flowers in the spring, among the fruit in the fall. The peaches ripen in the sun, blushing with the heat, and when you stroke them with your hand, they're soft and warm, like skin.\" Persephone's hand came up to touch her cheek. And Eurydice turned her head to kiss her, tasting sunshine and warmth in her mouth. They sought the warmth in each other, finding it with hands, lips. The taste of Persephone's skin was sweet and salty both, and her breasts filled Eurydice's cupped hands. The people over by the fire, she thought. They'd hear. But the fire had gone down to embers now, and it was almost dark. \"We'll be quiet,\" Persephone whispered in her ear. Making love with Persephone was like spring coming to the land, waking her to the things that she hadn't known were gone. She'd been living day to day, her body falling into numb sleep only to wake to work and more work. But now she was thawing, and it was almost painful. She moaned into Persephone's neck, shaking with her touch as it bloomed into pleasure almost too much to bear. Persephone stroked her hair, murmuring something soothing in her ear, and they lay there, clinging to each other in the darkness. Eurydice slept, and dreamed of sunny gardens. *** Eurydice woke, cold and stiff. She tugged the blanket around her and rolled over, confused, then sat up, blinking. Persephone was gone. Light filtered down the tunnel, lighting the railroad tracks and the telephone wires and the sharp edges of the rock. It was morning on the Upside, and she could see the opening up above. She hunched in on herself, pulling the blanket close. Tears stung her eyes, and she fought them back. What, she'd thought the Lady would take her along to her mother's farm where she could live in the lap of luxury, eating peaches? Right. Like that was something that happened. Well, she couldn't stay here, could she? She dragged herself up, feeling all the aches and pains from the day before. The group nearby, the ones who'd had the fire, nodded to her. She recognized one of the women now--she'd been in her barracks. \"Aren't you Eurydice?\" the woman called to her. Eurydice nodded. \"Where's your friend? The one from last night?\" Eurydice shook her head. \"She left. I didn't really know her, anyway.\" And wasn't that true. \"Well, you're welcome to stick with us, if you want.\" \"Where are you going?\" The other woman shrugged. \"We'll try to find some work, I guess. Can't get any worse than down there.\" \"I'd love to find a plot of land,\" the other woman said. \"Grow myself a garden.\" They followed the tracks out, a group of people among many others, ragged and hungry and tired. The sun was shining on the land. It was spring.",

      "People looked up as they passed, their pale faces turned up like night-blooming flowers, but the coach sped by too fast to make them out.",
      "The coach pulled up.",
      "\"Well, little songbird.",
      "This is my palace.\"",
      "Hades pointed to it with a flick of his thick fingers.",
      "But Eurydice didn't see it--she couldn't look away from him.",
      "How would the price be reckoned?",
      "She hadn't asked.",
      "Would he take her into his bed with its silken sheets and fuck her?",
      "Would he lay her there and press her down with that heavy well-fed body, taking whatever price he wanted?",
      "She shuddered.",
      "She'd done a lot to keep from starving.",
      "Stealing, sure.",
      "She'd done that plenty of times.",
      "You had to eat, and if people who had food didn't want to share it, then worse luck to them.",
      "But she hadn't never sold her body for it.",
      "Well, maybe that was just because she'd never yet been hungry enough.",
      "And maybe she wouldn't get the choice, now.",
      "And oh, Orpheus--but no use thinking of him, now.",

      "Eurydice wanted to touch her silk dress, run her fingers along it, if she hadn't been afraid she'd get it dirty.",
      "And her mouth was red, so red and full and flush with life.",

      "So warm, it was, and she stood still and shivered.",
      "\"Lovely,\" Persephone said.",
      "Her voice was low and smooth like dark honey.",
      "\"But so thin.",
      "We must feed her, don't you think?\"",
      "\"I did promise her a feast,\" Hades said, sounding amused.",
      "And such a feast it was.",
      "She sat down with them at a table, with Hades at the head of it and Persephone at his right side, and Eurydice at his left.",
      "\"Now eat your fill,\" Hades said, and servants began to carry in dishes.",
      "Servants!",
      "They looked much finer than her, and they moved smooth and graceful, and did not meet her eyes.",
      "But she didn't think of that long, because before her lay the feast: olives, both black and green; soft creamy cheese; bread, not the coarse dark bread she was used to, but white bread with a golden crust, steaming and warm when she broke it.",
      "There was rich red wine.",
      "There were plump little birds, roasted whole and stuffed with grain, and pork ribs sizzling with fat.",
      "There were sweet almond cakes dripping with honey, and every kind of fruit: delicate peeled grapes, oranges that had ripened in the sun, peaches with soft rose-colored skins, and dark red pomegranate seeds.",
      "Eurydice ate.",
      "She tried not be vulgar, seeing how the lord and lady took dainty little bites.",
      "But she could not help sucking the fat and the honey from her fingers.",
      "She needed it, oh, how she needed it.",
      "\"Careful,\" Persephone murmured.",
      "\"Don't eat too much.\"",
      "But Eurydice couldn't help it--she was used to snatching all the food she could, and she wasn't about to stop now.",
      "You never knew when you'd eat again.",
      "When she couldn't eat one single thing more, she looked up to find them both looking at her, the lady no less than the lord.",
      "\"Had your fill?\" Hades said.",
      "\"Yes, my lord,\" she said.",
      "\"Thank you.\"",
      "\"Let's see if she'll sing for her supper, then,\" he said to Persephone.",

      "\"I don't have much of a voice,\" Eurydice said.",
      "Though it wasn't her voice they were talking about, was it?",
      "\"Oh, I think you do,\" he said.",
      "Eurydice looked at Persephone, trying to plead with her eyes.",
      "Maybe, if it'd been just the lady, she wouldn't fear it so much.",
      "But Hades, no, she couldn't bear the thought of him touching her, the darkness in his eyes, the sardonic laugh.",
      "She shivered with cold, just thinking about it.",
      "Why had she ever left the warmth of the sun?",
      "Persephone's eyes were dark, too, but it was a different darkness.",
      "Her full red lips curved upwards, and she said, \"No, I think we'll let her go.",
      "Songbirds don't sing well in cages, after all.\"",
      "\"Very well, my love,\" Hades said.",
      "Eurydice stared at him.",
      "They'd let her go?",
      "Really?",
      "\"You think her merciful,\" Hades said to Eurydice.",
      "His voice rumbled deep in his chest like gravel.",
      "\"You'll find it isn't so--she belongs to the underground as much as I do.",
      "But we'll let you go, then, and you'll pay the price another way.\"",
      "Eurydice drew in a breath.",
      "\"Yes, of course,\" he said, his smile widening, baring teeth.",
      "\"You didn't think all this would come free, would you?",
      "We're not a charity down here, after all.\"",
      "Ten minutes later, the gates of the palace shut behind her with a solid clang.",
      "It was cold and damp.",
      "Above her, a black so deep she might forget the stars were ever there, up above in the world she came from.",
      "The only light was the lamp over the gate.",
      "\"But--where do I go?\" she asked the guard who'd taken her out.",
      "\"Barracks,\" he said.",
      "\"Down the road.",
      "There's one for the women on the right hand side, and you can start work in the morning.\"",
      "\"Work?\" she asked.",
      "\"Look, girl, just go.",
      "The bosses will tell you what to do in the morning,\" he said, not unkindly.",
      "Eurydice went.",
      "Persephone had thrown her a cloak as a farewell gift, and she clutched it tightly around herself as she made her way down the road.",
      "She was barefoot, and the gravel was cold, and rough even on her toughened soles.",
      "She felt sick to her stomach with the feast she'd eaten, and she hadn't walked more than a couple of hundred feet when she was forced to bend over and hurl it all up, all the rich food her stomach couldn't take, not when she'd gone hungry for so long.",
      "The blood rushed to her head, and she panted, her stomach cramping again.",
      "She braced herself with her hands on her knees and wiped her mouth.",
      "It tasted sour.",
      "Nothing for it but to go on.",
      "There was one dim lamp outside the barracks, and Eurydice knocked on the door.",
      "A stout hard-eyed woman opened.",
      "\"Look, it's past curfew.",
      "What are you doing out?\"",
      "\"I'm new.",
      "I was told to go here?\"",
      "The woman sniffed.",
      "\"From the upside, are you?",
      "Well, we'll see if you can do any work.\"",
      "\"I can work,\" she said.",
      "It didn't sound so bad, did it?",
      "Honest work, and an honest wage at the end of the day.",
      "She'd heard this was a good place, after all, and it couldn't all be lies.",
      "\"Right, then.",
      "Go on in--there should be a spare mattress in there somewhere.\"",
      "The room was dark, and she stumbled over something first thing.",
      "\"Uh?\" a sleepy voice mumbled.",
      "\"Watch where you're going.\"",
      "She stood still while her eyes got used to the dark, with the dim light shining in through a small window.",
      "The floor was covered with sleeping figures on mattresses, and she picked her way between them until she came to an empty one.",
      "Lying there swept in the cloak Persephone had given her, she shivered a little.",
      "It was cold, and the cloak wasn't enough, not really.",
      "What had she done?",
      "There was no getting back through those gates, with the razor wire, the growling guard dogs.",
      "The massive wall.",
      "Last night she'd slept in Orpheus' arms.",
      "Slept poorly, sure, with her stomach aching with hunger, but twined together, they'd slept warm even under the stars.",
      "Laughing, carefree, happy-go-lucky Orpheus, who thought a song could fix their every problem.",
      "And yes, it was true: his voice was like nothing else she'd heard, and she couldn't keep her eyes off him when he sang.",
      "Or her hands either, afterwards.",
      "But it just wasn't enough.",
      "You couldn't live like that, from day to day, never knowing when you'd get any money or food or a roof over your head.",
      "She'd had to do it, hadn't she?",
      "Well, she'd made her bed and now she'd have to lie in it.",
      "Eurydice finally dropped off, from sheer exhaustion if nothing else, but it felt like she'd only slept a minute or two before a loud voice woke her.",
      "\"Get up, there!",
      "Time for work.",
      "Don't laze around!\"",
      "Eurydice groaned, sat up, and rubbed at eyes that felt like they had sand in them.",
      "Damn it, she was still exhausted.",
      "All around her, women were getting up, grumbling like her, but getting dressed and ready.",
      "\"You!",
      "You're the new one, right?\" Eurydice looked up to see the stout woman from yesterday.",
      "\"Yes.\"",
      "\"Well, we'll get you some gear.",
      "You'll need boots, and something more to wear.",
      "And a pick, of course.\"",
      "She blinked.",
      "\"All right.\"",
      "It struck her that she didn't know what the work would be, down here, but she supposed she'd find out.",
      "The boots she got fit all right, and seemed stout enough.",
      "Besides that, she got a pair of trousers and a shirt, both obviously worn by someone else before, but still whole, and a pick-axe.",
      "Perhaps this all came with the job--she hoped so.",
      "The woman seemed to know what she was wondering.",
      "\"Don't think you're getting this for free--it'll come out of your pay, if you don't have any money.",
      "Which your lot usually doesn't.\"",
      "She sniffed.",
      "\"Thank you, ma'am.\"",
      "It seemed best not to provoke her.",
      "\"Well, of with you now, so you don't miss the train.\"",
      "It turned out to be an actual train, with people cramming into the open train cars, men and women both, lit by lanterns, their faces shadowed.",
      "Eurydice jumped up into one car, and stood there while the train wheels squeaked to life with the sharp smell of heated metal and they were off.",
      "\"Where's the work?",
      "Where are we going?\" she asked a woman beside her.",
      "The woman raised her eyebrows at her.",
      "\"You new?\"",
      "Her clothing was worn out and torn in several places.",
      "\"Yes.\"",
      "\"Well, we're going down.\"",
      "\"We're already in the underground, aren't we?\"",
      "\"Sure.",
      "But every year it goes deeper.",
      "We follow the gold, and there's none left up here.\"",
      "\"Gold?\"",
      "She gave a sound that might have been a laugh.",
      "\"Don't you even know what we're here for? Gold.",
      "We mine the gold for Hades.\"",
      "And the train was going down, for sure.",
      "She'd lost all sense of direction but that: the brakes squealing, the hairpin turns, all going down, down, down into the darkness.",
      "The train ground to a stop, and the crammed bodies began to get out, the movement transplanting through the living crowd until it reached her, and she got out, steadying herself on the cold metal of the train car.",
      "\"Right!",
      "You fill these cars up,\" a voice shouted, and she followed the tide of people.",
      "It didn't look like gold, what they hauled back to the train cars.",
      "Not that there was much light to see by, but it just looked like rock to her.",
      "\"Is this really gold?\" she asked the man beside her.",
      "\"Sure,\" he said, wiping the sweat off his brow.",
      "\"But it's gold ore, not gold outright.",
      "You got to do something to it, melt it down, to get the gold out.\"",
      "\"Oh,\" Eurydice said.",
      "Somehow she'd imagined the gold running in butter-yellow veins through the rock, shining in the lamplight.",
      "She snorted at her own dreams.",
      "Might as well have imagined the gold coins falling right into her hands.",
      "It was back-breaking work.",
      "Before long, the skin of her hands was sore, and her shoulders ached with it.",
      "She started taking less of a load, and trying to dawdle a bit on the way back.",
      "\"Hey, you!\"",
      "a guard shouted, shoving at her.",
      "\"Do your share!\"",
      "Eurydice bit her lip.",
      "She didn't think talking back would help her, and she picked up her pace a bit.",
      "But then she saw one of the other women glaring at the guard.",
      "\"Don't let him get to you,\" the woman muttered at her when they'd gotten out of sight of the guard.",
      "Eurydice impulsively reached out to squeeze the woman's hand.",
      "\"Thanks,\" she said.",
      "Just a word of simple human decency, but it meant so much.",
      "It almost made the load lighter.",
      "Almost.",
      "On the next round, she happened to glance up, and saw, of all things, a bird cage hanging up there from the damp uneven rock.",
      "A songbird sat in it.",
      "She stopped and stared.",
      "It wasn't singing--who would, down here?--but it sat there, drab and brown and preening its feathers with its beak.",
      "The person behind her bumped into her.",
      "\"Hey, what's the hold-up?\"",
      "\"What is that?",
      "The bird?",
      "Why's it down here?\"",
      "\"Oh, that?",
      "That's to see if there's any mine gas down here.",
      "The bird would die first, if there was.\"",
      "He shrugged.",
      "\"We'd die, too, probably, but it's something.\"",
      "*** That night Eurydice was bone-tired.",
      "She ate the food that was ladled out to them (docked from their pay, of course).",
      "She supposed it was all right.",
      "A feast, she would've said, before she'd eaten at Hades and Persephone's table.",
      "She tasted bile in her mouth, thinking of that feast.",
      "She slept like the dead that night.",
      "Next morning, the boss-woman's voice woke her and she scrunched her eyes against the sudden light.",
      "It was all to do again, the back-breaking work, and this time with her whole body sore from the day before.",
      "You could do more than you thought you could, Eurydice learned.",
      "After a while the aches just seemed like the way things were.",
      "She learned the names of her bunk-mates, learned which ones would give you a helping hand and a smile, or keep a look-out for when the bosses were cracking down extra-hard, and warn you.",
      "Most were decent folks.",
      "Some were petty, or would try to get more than their share, or would tell on you if you slacked off.",
      "But not many were like that.",
      "Still, the work filled her world.",
      "There wasn't any space left to think, and Orpheus seemed so very far away.",
      "He was up in the sunshine, somewhere.",
      "She barely remembered the sunshine.",
      "\"Hey, you coming along to get some moonshine?\" one of the other women asked her, after they ate one night.",
      "\"Moonshine?\"",
      "The moon seemed very far away, too.",
      "Or maybe she meant the other kind of moonshine.",
      "Of course she did.",
      "\"I heard the Lady's setting up shop tonight.",
      "Down by one of the warehouses.\"",
      "So after lights-out they sneaked out, between the warehouses full of gold ore until they got to one where light and music stole out between the cracks.",
      "Inside it was warm and smoky, with a press of people, still grimy from the workday, but so was she, so she didn't care.",
      "And there she was, the Lady--behind the bar, handing out drinks.",
      "Eurydice couldn't take her eyes off her, she looked so fine.",
      "Hair black and glossy, cut short to end above her smooth neck.",
      "Slim, and elegant, and her mouth curved as she smiled and looked over the crowd.",
      "Eurydice held her breath, but the Lady's gaze just slid right over her.",
      "She wasn't nothing special, after all.",
      "\"Thinks she's something,\" one of the women with her muttered.",
      "\"I'm sure not turning down her drinks, though,\" one of the others said.",
      "They elbowed their way through the crowd to reach the bar.",
      "The Lady did see her, then, and she leaned in close.",
      "\"Songbird,\" she murmured.",
      "\"So you're here.\"",
      "The others looked sideways at her, and Eurydice felt herself flush.",
      "She didn't want to be singled out.",
      "But the Lady remembered her, after all.",
      "\"Today the Upside's coming Down,\" Persephone said, smiling.",
      "\"What's your poison?",
      "Sunshine or moonshine?\" \"Sunshine,\" Eurydice whispered, thinking about the summer heat, and how she missed it, after all.",
      "\"Sunshine it is,\" Persephone said, pouring something in a glass for her.",
      "\"On the house.\"",
      "She poured for the other two as well.",
      "Eurydice lowered her eyes in confusion and took a sip, just for something to do.",
      "And oh, but it was like sunshine: strong and sweet and warm.",
      "She took another sip, hungry for it, drawing it out.",
      "She looked up, to catch the Lady looking at her, something wistful in her eyes.",
      "\"Thank you,\" she said.",
      "\"You shouldn't thank me,\" Persephone said with a wry smile, and turned away to serve someone else.",
      "\"You know her?\" one of her friends said skeptically.",
      "Eurydice shook her head.",
      "\"No. I surely don't.",
      "She just...saw me when I first came in from the Upside.",
      "Didn't think she'd remember.\"",
      "Later, when they'd gone back to the barracks for some sleep before the next workday, she dreamed.",

    "text": "It was a sad statement about her life that she now had a fondness for the cold. Sad because she had started out as a goddess of spring, of plants, and vegetation, and flowers. This cold, desolate place suited her, at least for the time being. She'd have to leave soon enough, when her mother realized that she'd been released from the Underworld, and came for her. She hadn't really wanted to leave the Underworld, but it always felt like a betrayal to stay longer than the required three months a year. Three months never seemed like enough time to explore areas that she hadn't seen before, or revisit her favorite places like the gardens made of every kind of precious gemstone that Hades had made for her to tempt her to stay those many, many years ago. Back then, she had yearned for the sun, for open fields, and her friends the Nymphs. Persephone wrinkled her nose thinking of all the time she'd spent weeping, and calling for her mother when, before Hades, she'd spent all her time scheming ways to escape her mother's control. Marriage had been one means of escape, but every man presented to Demeter had been summarily rejected. Only Hades had had the courage to steal Persephone out from under her mother's nose. Hades had been strangely absent this year, except for his usual greeting that he always gave when she first arrived. He'd been brief, somewhat distracted, then had left her to her own devices which had been the pattern for quite some time. She dismissed him from her thoughts, and looked around, admiring the austere landscape. The sky was slate gray, and reminded her of the dim reaches of the Underworld. The muffling silence of the snow also gave her a pang of homesickness. It was a desolate place, yet the winter sun made the snow sparkle prettily. She rounded a snow covered evergreen, and kicked something hidden in a mound of snow. It went flying, then landed in a colorful heap. \"Hey, watch it!\" It was... a doll. A small, cloth doll with orange yarn hair tied in braids, tiny freckles dotted across its cheeks, a pencil line mouth, and a blue gingham dress. It was a girl doll, standing with hands on hips, glaring at her. \"Where did you come from?\" Persephone asked. \"A factory in Wisconsin.\" \"Oh... Then how did you end up here?\" The doll's pencil line mouth frowned in quite an adorable way. \"I belong here. This is the Island of Misfit Toys. How did you get here? You're not a toy.\" \"I never know where I'm going to end up when I leave the Underworld. Am I forbidden to be here? It would be strange to end up in a place where I don't belong.\" \"Beats me. Rudolph ended up here a few years ago, but at least he was a Misfit because of his nose.\" \"Who?\" \"Never mind. I'm Trudy, by the way. You?\" \"Persephone.\" \"Okay, Steph.\" Trudy waved her cloth arm toward a high mountain peak with a castle on top. \"I better take you to King Moonracer and let him sort you out.\" The throne room was quite a let down. There were no guards at the doors, nor inside. There didn't seem to be anyone anywhere, except for a group of toys that did a peculiar song and dance routine that was probably a welcoming ceremony of some sort. Persephone had clapped politely, and nodded in her most dignified way before following Trudy to the castle. It was a good thing she was impervious to the cold because the throne room was chilly, and drafty, which made sense because of the snowy landscape, but there was no excuse for how the place lacked grandeur, and couldn't even merit a grudging pronouncement of charming. There were toys everywhere! Shouldn't the throne room be at least bright and cheerful? The king himself was much closer to what she expected of royalty, though a great, winged lion with a crown perched on his head was peculiar. She was long accustomed to gods and goddesses showing up in many different aspects, so she made a small, but correct, obeisance to show respect. \"I apologize if I'm trespassing,\" Persephone began. \"No need to apologize.\" His voice was deep, and had a pleasant resonance. \"I've long grown accustomed to visitors, though they usually only appear during the holidays. I am King Moonracer. Who are you, and why are you here?\" \"Persephone. I'm the Queen of the Underworld, and I come back to the world every spring.\" Persephone looked around. \"It doesn't appear to be spring here.\" \"No, the Island is in perpetual winter. In the outside world it would be spring.\" \"Oh, well then, I'm not too far off the mark. It's the right time of year, and the snow is nice, and my mother hasn't found me yet. May I stay for a while?\" \"I'm sorry, but the Island is only suitable for toys.\" \"I'm a goddess, I can survive here just fine.\" \"It's not a matter of your survival. There are a number of reasons I keep the toys isolated.\" \"Because there's something wrong with them?\" She heard a soft hrmph! and looked down to see Trudy walking away. She watched Trudy stomp all the way to the doors of the throne room, though it wasn't much of a stomp. It was hard to make noise with feet made of cloth. The doors shut behind Trudy with a bang. King Moonracer looked so disappointed that Persephone blushed with embarrassment. \"There is nothing wrong with Trudy,\" he said. \"But-- I thought she was a misfit.\" \"A misfit, yes. There is nothing wrong with being a misfit. It only means that it takes longer to find a place where you fit in.\" \"She doesn't look like a misfit. Trudy looks like a perfectly normal doll to me.\" It had been a long time since Persephone had felt so stupid. The kindness in King Moonracer's eyes didn't help any. \"Trudy wants to belong to a boy.\" \"A lot of boys want dolls.\" \"Most boys want action figures. The few who want real dolls, have chosen others.\" \"Maybe I could help?\" King Moonracer seemed to smile, though is muzzle couldn't quite make such an expression. It was more like an aura, a feeling of compassion and patience. He was very old, and she wondered what he might have been in a past era. \"Thank you, but Santa and Rudolph manage the Misfits just fine.\" She had no excuse to stay, but she was a goddess, and a queen, and as such she was welcome wherever she chose to go. \"I will try not to impose on your hospitality for too long, King Moonracer.\" She pretended not to hear his sigh of resignation. Persephone left the castle thinking that she would find Trudy, and apologize, maybe even make things up to her. She found her in a group with a few other toys, and asked her what would make her happier on the Island. It turned out Trudy wanted a house, and not the pink and purple cottage Persephone thought she might like. Trudy opted for a log cabin with a stone fireplace that held a real fire. Persephone was careful to make sure the fire wouldn't burn anything but the tiny logs stacked inside. The other toys had joined in, and Persephone ended up creating a village with tracks that could accommodate any train, a pond for any kind of boat, fish, or aquatic creature, and a helicopter pad. For the soldiers, she'd built a barracks, and for the stuffed animals a barn. Of course, there were Christmas lights on every building, and lampposts along every little street. When she was done, Persephone walked a short distance away so she could admire her work. It was fully dark, so the little toy town glowed brightly. She watched the toys move from place to place, chatting excitedly. \"Persephone.\" She gasped, and spun around. \"Hades! What are you doing here.\" She gathered her wits, and raised her chin. \"Did you come to take me back?\" \"No, quite the opposite.\" He reached into the inner breast pocket of his suit, and pulled out a sheaf of papers. \"I want a divorce.\" \"What?\" She must have misheard him. \"I've been thinking about it for a long time, Persephone. We should have been free of each other a long time ago.\" \"Each other?\" She glared. \"Don't you mean you should have set me free?\" \"Divorce hasn't exactly been an option for us,\" he said, stepping closer. The light from the town fell on his face revealing a deep weariness. \"Not unless you consider being turned into a bird or a tree a divorce which I doubt would work with you anyway. I've been singularly unsuccessful in changing your mind, let alone anything else.\" \"You expected me to change for you?\" She laughed, sharp and angry. It felt good. It had been a long time since she'd felt anything but a low-level discontent. \"No, but I had hoped, foolishly, that you would one day see me for who I am.\" \"I know exactly what you are: a kidnapper. You kidnapped me, and held me against my-- \" \"Enough!\" She startled badly. She'd never heard him shout before, not at her, not at anyone. That was one of the few things she'd learned to admire about him in the melodrama of Olympus, where emotions ran higher and hotter than a volcano. Hades had never been anything other than unflappable, even when provoked beyond what most could endure. \"Enough,\" he said more calmly. \"You've thrown that one act of impetuous stupidity into my face a million times. I'm done with it.\" He dropped the papers at her feet. She felt shaken to the core. \"It's impossible,\" she whispered. The papers fluttered in the light breeze. \"It's a whole new age. We've passed through at least a dozen of them since we first manifested. Things are different now. Zeus and Hera have retired to the south of France; Apollo is some kind of beach bum in Hawaii, I think he owns a surf shop. Charon owns an international shipping company, and Cerberus plays monsters in movies, mostly for the SyFy channel. \"Didn't you wonder why you're not with your mother? She's off somewhere sinking whaling ships for P.E.T.A or saving trees. I think she was saving owls the last time I talked to her.\" \"You talked to my mother?\" That was probably the most appalling revelation so far. \"Not often. We talk when we see each other.\" No, Demeter would never speak to Hades, except to possibly curse at him. She hated Hades... didn't she? Hades began to fade away. \"Wait!\" It was suddenly very important that he not leave. He solidified, one brow quirked in inquiry. She groped for something to say. \"If I sign these, I want to remain Queen of the Underworld.\" \"Of course you do,\" Hades muttered. \"What's that?\" \"Never mind. Just have your lawyer call my lawyer when you're ready to sign.\" \"Wait, you don't even want me to call you in person?\" Persephone felt more than a little hurt. \"Call me, call my lawyer, I don't care. Please just sign the papers.\" He started to fade again. \"Wait!\" She didn't know why she was so reluctant to see him go. He solidified. \"What is it now?\" \"Is there someone else?\" she blurted out. She didn't know where that idea had come from. She had no reason to think that there was-- Oh, sweet Olympus, was he in love with someone else? \"What difference does it make?\" His irritation was plain, but he shrugged anyway, and answered, \"No, there's no one else. There's never been anyone else. Even when I was trying to make you jealous, you always put a stop to it before I had to follow through with anything.\" \"But if you're not in love with someone else, then why are you doing this? I don't understand.\" He studied her for a long time, until she had to look away. When he replied, his voice was gentle. \"You've spent our entire marriage pushing me away. You finally succeeded. Good-bye, Persephone.\" This time he simply vanished. Persephone could see inside the open front of Trudy's house where she was sitting in a rocking chair next to the fireplace. She didn't want to talk to anyone, but she didn't know what else to do either. She sat down next to the doll house with the papers in her lap. \"What's up, Steph?\" \"Do you think you could be happy here if you never find a boy of your own?\" It was probably cruel to ask such a question, but she couldn't help herself. \"Santa will find a boy for me,\" Trudy said, without a hint of doubt. \"But what if he doesn't?\" Trudy rocked in her chair, thinking. \"This is a nice house, Steph. I could live here a long time, and be okay. But this isn't my home. Santa will find a boy to love me, and then I'll have a real home.\" \"Are you saying the boy will be your home?\" \"For me, yes. I guess other people have a place, but for me, and most toys, home is a person.\" The Underworld was Persephone's home, and on some level, she'd always known that. Her eagerness to go, and her reluctance to leave was the first clue. As much as she loved the sunlit world that she was born to, the realm of shadows called to the deepest part of her. But if she were truthful, it wasn't just the Underworld that spoke to her. Hades had always been a part of it, showing her the secret places that only he had ever seen before, revealing wonders. Revealing himself. She'd always kept her eyes on the world around her, never on him. Never on herself. The revelation came crashing in on her. It was him, all of it. Hades was the Underworld. She had embraced the glory and the beauty of the place, while rejecting the living part, the god. They were one and the same, yet she had kept them divided in her mind. Being a goddess herself, she should have understood right from the beginning. She was a goddess of spring, of burgeoning life, but she was also Persephone the woman. As a goddess of spring, she had to make way for summer. She had to rest after bringing forth so much new life. Perhaps that was why she had emerged in a place where only evergreens could grow. She wasn't ready. These last few years she had missed Hades, the god, the man. She could admit it now, that she'd been lonely for him, that her home didn't feel right without him by her side. \"Trudy, I'm beginning to think that a home can be both a person and a place.\" \"Sure. Why not?\" Trudy said. \"I hope you find your boy some day soon, Trudy. I'm happy you like the house.\" \"Hey, where are you going?\" \"Home.\" She wasn't surprised to find him in the throne room. It was grand, and beautiful, with columns of raw crystal towering above her. He watched as she approached, but said nothing as she mounted the stairs, then sat down in the throne next to his. She put her hand on his arms. It momentarily stiffened, then relaxed under her touch. \"My only excuse is that I'm a goddess of spring, of new life, and possibility. It took more time than usual for me to grow up.\" His breathing was soft and even. She realized she that she could spend the rest of her life listening to it. \"You're ready?\" he asked. \"I'm ready,\" she said. The End",

      "The king himself was much closer to what she expected of royalty, though a great, winged lion with a crown perched on his head was peculiar.",
      "She was long accustomed to gods and goddesses showing up in many different aspects, so she made a small, but correct, obeisance to show respect.",
      "\"I apologize if I'm trespassing,\" Persephone began.",
      "\"No need to apologize.\"",
      "His voice was deep, and had a pleasant resonance.",
      "\"I've long grown accustomed to visitors, though they usually only appear during the holidays.",
      "I am King Moonracer.",
      "Who are you, and why are you here?\" \"Persephone.",
      "I'm the Queen of the Underworld, and I come back to the world every spring.\"",
      "Persephone looked around.",
      "\"It doesn't appear to be spring here.\"",
      "\"No, the Island is in perpetual winter.",
      "In the outside world it would be spring.\"",
      "\"Oh, well then, I'm not too far off the mark.",
      "It's the right time of year, and the snow is nice, and my mother hasn't found me yet.",
      "May I stay for a while?\"",
      "\"I'm sorry, but the Island is only suitable for toys.\"",
      "\"I'm a goddess, I can survive here just fine.\"",
      "\"It's not a matter of your survival.",
      "There are a number of reasons I keep the toys isolated.\"",
      "\"Because there's something wrong with them?\"",
      "She heard a soft hrmph!",
      "and looked down to see Trudy walking away.",
      "She watched Trudy stomp all the way to the doors of the throne room, though it wasn't much of a stomp.",
      "It was hard to make noise with feet made of cloth.",
      "The doors shut behind Trudy with a bang.",
      "King Moonracer looked so disappointed that Persephone blushed with embarrassment.",
      "\"There is nothing wrong with Trudy,\" he said.",
      "\"But-- I thought she was a misfit.\"",
      "\"A misfit, yes.",
      "There is nothing wrong with being a misfit.",
      "It only means that it takes longer to find a place where you fit in.\"",
      "\"She doesn't look like a misfit.",
      "Trudy looks like a perfectly normal doll to me.\"",
      "It had been a long time since Persephone had felt so stupid.",
      "The kindness in King Moonracer's eyes didn't help any.",
      "\"Trudy wants to belong to a boy.\"",
      "\"A lot of boys want dolls.\"",
      "\"Most boys want action figures.",
      "The few who want real dolls, have chosen others.\"",
      "\"Maybe I could help?\"",
      "King Moonracer seemed to smile, though is muzzle couldn't quite make such an expression.",
      "It was more like an aura, a feeling of compassion and patience.",
      "He was very old, and she wondered what he might have been in a past era.",
      "\"Thank you, but Santa and Rudolph manage the Misfits just fine.\"",
      "She had no excuse to stay, but she was a goddess, and a queen, and as such she was welcome wherever she chose to go.",
      "\"I will try not to impose on your hospitality for too long, King Moonracer.\"",
      "She pretended not to hear his sigh of resignation.",
      "Persephone left the castle thinking that she would find Trudy, and apologize, maybe even make things up to her.",
      "She found her in a group with a few other toys, and asked her what would make her happier on the Island.",
      "It turned out Trudy wanted a house, and not the pink and purple cottage Persephone thought she might like.",
      "Trudy opted for a log cabin with a stone fireplace that held a real fire.",
      "Persephone was careful to make sure the fire wouldn't burn anything but the tiny logs stacked inside.",
      "The other toys had joined in, and Persephone ended up creating a village with tracks that could accommodate any train, a pond for any kind of boat, fish, or aquatic creature, and a helicopter pad.",
      "For the soldiers, she'd built a barracks, and for the stuffed animals a barn.",
      "Of course, there were Christmas lights on every building, and lampposts along every little street.",
      "When she was done, Persephone walked a short distance away so she could admire her work.",
      "It was fully dark, so the little toy town glowed brightly.",
      "She watched the toys move from place to place, chatting excitedly.",
      "\"Persephone.\"",
      "She gasped, and spun around.",
      "\"Hades!",
      "What are you doing here.\"",
      "She gathered her wits, and raised her chin.",
      "\"Did you come to take me back?\"",
      "\"No, quite the opposite.\"",
      "He reached into the inner breast pocket of his suit, and pulled out a sheaf of papers.",
      "\"I want a divorce.\"",
      "\"What?\"",
      "She must have misheard him.",
      "\"I've been thinking about it for a long time, Persephone.",
      "We should have been free of each other a long time ago.\"",
      "\"Each other?\"",
      "She glared.",
      "\"Don't you mean you should have set me free?\"",
      "\"Divorce hasn't exactly been an option for us,\" he said, stepping closer.",
      "The light from the town fell on his face revealing a deep weariness.",
      "\"Not unless you consider being turned into a bird or a tree a divorce which I doubt would work with you anyway.",
      "I've been singularly unsuccessful in changing your mind, let alone anything else.\"",
      "\"You expected me to change for you?\"",
      "She laughed, sharp and angry.",
      "It felt good.",
      "It had been a long time since she'd felt anything but a low-level discontent.",
      "\"No, but I had hoped, foolishly, that you would one day see me for who I am.\"",
      "\"I know exactly what you are: a kidnapper.",
      "You kidnapped me, and held me against my-- \" \"Enough!\"",
      "She startled badly.",
      "She'd never heard him shout before, not at her, not at anyone.",
      "That was one of the few things she'd learned to admire about him in the melodrama of Olympus, where emotions ran higher and hotter than a volcano.",
      "Hades had never been anything other than unflappable, even when provoked beyond what most could endure.",
      "\"Enough,\" he said more calmly.",
      "\"You've thrown that one act of impetuous stupidity into my face a million times.",
      "I'm done with it.\"",
      "He dropped the papers at her feet.",
      "She felt shaken to the core.",
      "\"It's impossible,\" she whispered.",
      "The papers fluttered in the light breeze.",
      "\"It's a whole new age.",
      "We've passed through at least a dozen of them since we first manifested.",
      "Things are different now.",
      "Zeus and Hera have retired to the south of France; Apollo is some kind of beach bum in Hawaii, I think he owns a surf shop.",
      "Charon owns an international shipping company, and Cerberus plays monsters in movies, mostly for the SyFy channel.",
      "\"Didn't you wonder why you're not with your mother?",
      "She's off somewhere sinking whaling ships for P.E.T.A or saving trees.",
      "I think she was saving owls the last time I talked to her.\"",
      "\"You talked to my mother?\"",
      "That was probably the most appalling revelation so far.",
      "\"Not often.",
      "We talk when we see each other.\"",
      "No, Demeter would never speak to Hades, except to possibly curse at him.",
      "She hated Hades... didn't she?",
      "Hades began to fade away.",
      "\"Wait!\"",
      "It was suddenly very important that he not leave.",
      "He solidified, one brow quirked in inquiry.",
      "She groped for something to say.",
      "\"If I sign these, I want to remain Queen of the Underworld.\"",
      "\"Of course you do,\" Hades muttered.",
      "\"What's that?\"",
      "\"Never mind.",
      "Just have your lawyer call my lawyer when you're ready to sign.\"",
      "\"Wait, you don't even want me to call you in person?\" Persephone felt more than a little hurt.",
      "\"Call me, call my lawyer, I don't care.",
      "Please just sign the papers.\"",
      "He started to fade again.",
      "\"Wait!\"",
      "She didn't know why she was so reluctant to see him go.",
      "He solidified.",
      "\"What is it now?\"",
      "\"Is there someone else?\" she blurted out.",
      "She didn't know where that idea had come from.",
      "She had no reason to think that there was-- Oh, sweet Olympus, was he in love with someone else?",
      "\"What difference does it make?\"",
      "His irritation was plain, but he shrugged anyway, and answered, \"No, there's no one else.",
      "There's never been anyone else.",
      "Even when I was trying to make you jealous, you always put a stop to it before I had to follow through with anything.\"",
      "\"But if you're not in love with someone else, then why are you doing this?",
      "I don't understand.\"",
      "He studied her for a long time, until she had to look away.",
      "When he replied, his voice was gentle.",
      "\"You've spent our entire marriage pushing me away.",
      "You finally succeeded.",
      "Good-bye, Persephone.\"",
      "This time he simply vanished.",
      "Persephone could see inside the open front of Trudy's house where she was sitting in a rocking chair next to the fireplace.",
      "She didn't want to talk to anyone, but she didn't know what else to do either.",
      "She sat down next to the doll house with the papers in her lap.",
      "\"What's up, Steph?\"",
      "\"Do you think you could be happy here if you never find a boy of your own?\"",
      "It was probably cruel to ask such a question, but she couldn't help herself.",
      "\"Santa will find a boy for me,\" Trudy said, without a hint of doubt.",
      "\"But what if he doesn't?\"",
      "Trudy rocked in her chair, thinking.",
      "\"This is a nice house, Steph.",
      "I could live here a long time, and be okay.",
      "But this isn't my home.",
      "Santa will find a boy to love me, and then I'll have a real home.\"",
      "\"Are you saying the boy will be your home?\"",
      "\"For me, yes.",
      "I guess other people have a place, but for me, and most toys, home is a person.\"",
      "The Underworld was Persephone's home, and on some level, she'd always known that.",
      "Her eagerness to go, and her reluctance to leave was the first clue.",
      "As much as she loved the sunlit world that she was born to, the realm of shadows called to the deepest part of her.",
      "But if she were truthful, it wasn't just the Underworld that spoke to her.",
      "Hades had always been a part of it, showing her the secret places that only he had ever seen before, revealing wonders.",
      "Revealing himself.",
      "She'd always kept her eyes on the world around her, never on him.",
      "Never on herself.",
      "The revelation came crashing in on her.",
      "It was him, all of it.",
      "Hades was the Underworld.",
      "She had embraced the glory and the beauty of the place, while rejecting the living part, the god.",
      "They were one and the same, yet she had kept them divided in her mind.",
      "Being a goddess herself, she should have understood right from the beginning.",
      "She was a goddess of spring, of burgeoning life, but she was also Persephone the woman.",
      "As a goddess of spring, she had to make way for summer.",
      "She had to rest after bringing forth so much new life.",
      "Perhaps that was why she had emerged in a place where only evergreens could grow.",
      "She wasn't ready.",
      "These last few years she had missed Hades, the god, the man.",
      "She could admit it now, that she'd been lonely for him, that her home didn't feel right without him by her side.",
      "\"Trudy, I'm beginning to think that a home can be both a person and a place.\"",
      "\"Sure.",
      "Why not?\" Trudy said.",
      "\"I hope you find your boy some day soon, Trudy.",
      "I'm happy you like the house.\"",
      "\"Hey, where are you going?\" \"Home.\"",
      "She wasn't surprised to find him in the throne room.",
      "It was grand, and beautiful, with columns of raw crystal towering above her.",
      "He watched as she approached, but said nothing as she mounted the stairs, then sat down in the throne next to his.",
      "She put her hand on his arms.",
      "It momentarily stiffened, then relaxed under her touch.",
      "\"My only excuse is that I'm a goddess of spring, of new life, and possibility.",
      "It took more time than usual for me to grow up.\"",
      "His breathing was soft and even.",
      "She realized she that she could spend the rest of her life listening to it.",
      "\"You're ready?\" he asked.",
      "\"I'm ready,\" she said.",

    "text": "When she came Below, Cassandra came with her head held high and her eyes unclouded. The shock of death had cut through worse things than curses and madness before. Cassandra stood apart from her conqueror. She looked angry, despite everything. Persephone could appreciate that. Not everyone was able to come to an understanding with their abductor as she had. Agamemnon came in still mumbling under his breath that he didn't understand what had gone wrong, and he was greeted with the honor due his role. \"Walk with me,\" Persephone said when Agamemnon had gone on his way. Cassandra started at the Queen's words, but she set her jaw and went where she was beckoned. Persephone walked quickly and Cassandra hurried to keep up, not saying anything. Persephone finally led her into a small garden. Cassandra looked around, taking in the pale flowers and dark leaves, the Elysian sun overhead. When she turned her face up, Persephone could see her confusion as she worked out why it felt different. \"There is no heat in the sun down here,\" Persephone told her. Cassandra turned her face down. Her quiet oh made Persephone shake her head. \"Talk with me,\" she said as she seated herself. She gestured for Cassandra to join her, and the shade hesitated, not sure where politeness dictated she should sit. Persephone traced the outline of the cushion next to her, and Cassandra found a comfortable place at the goddess's side. \"You know of the war,\" she began. Persphone nodded. \"I have met many who fought on both sides over the decade.\" \"Afterwards, as the city was overrun, I went to Athena's temple...\" Cassandra trailed off, and Persephone didn't push when she changed the subject. \"Agamemnon took me as his battle-prize. For my beauty.\" She all but spit the last word. \"You don't consider yourself beautiful?\" Cassandra shrugged at that. \"I've been told it many times. I was called second only to Helen more than once. But it's only brought me pain and madness.\" \"You are quite beautiful,\" Persephone acknowledged. \"But what caught my attention about you was the anger in your eyes.\" \"I'm not angry any longer, not really.\" She lapsed into silence. \"And Agamemnon?\" \"When it finally happened, it was as if I were watching actors on the stage... we all wore our masks, and the chorus in my head was shouting, but the real thing had happened to me weeks before and I thought I was already dead and burned with Troy.\" Cassandra reached across her chest and rubbed her other arm. \"I tried to warn him, but I'm sure I wasn't exactly convincing. I knew he wouldn't listen, and I was half-mad and in no position to make a rational argument.\" As she spoke, Persephone placed a hand on her knee to calm her. Cassandra laid her head on the goddess's shoulder. \"Have you heard... have you seen Creusa?\" Persephone nodded. \"She fell behind as she and her husband fled.\" They went down the list, sisters, brothers, her father, dead or alive. \"Andromache?\" \"She yet lives.\" Cassandra sighed. \"Always the better of us, Andromache.\" \"She was taken, as you were. As to whether that's better...\" Persephone stroked her knee. \"Too many people do not listen to women, mortal or immortal.\" \"I've heard the stories,\" Cassandra nodded. \"Do you-\" \"Hades and I have an understanding. We each need our space.\" Persephone smiled. \"I do not speak of myself, if that's what concerns you, dear Cassandra. Don't worry about me.\" Though Cassandra was but a shade, she was solid enough under Persephone's gentle hands. She slid her fingers beneath the hem of Cassandra's peplos and stopped when the mortal's breath hitched. \"I will go no further if you do not wish me to,\" Persephone said carefully. \"I-\" There was a hint of tears in her eyes. The goddess stroked her hair. \"You do not need to explain. Much has been taken from you.\" Cassandra leaned in, resting her head on Persephone's breast. She continued to stroke Cassandra's hair. After several minutes, Persephone felt the tension in her back shift and the mortal broke into a long, low moan and then sobs. Persephone only held her more tightly and rubbed her back, hoping to comfort the woman. She wasn't sure if she would succeed; even the gods could only do so much. Eventually, Cassandra's gasping breaths slowed as she realized she didn't really need to breathe. It was habit and nothing more, and then the reality of it came crashing down on her again. Persephone took her hand gently and walked with her out into the wilds of Hades' realm itself. Cassandra could not keep track of the distance as they walked, but she walked with just as much determination as the goddess. When the river came into view, she only nodded. On the bank, Persephone produced a small, pale green marble. Cassandra gave her a wane smile, and she dropped the marble into the water. It produced single concentric ripple that spread out across the surface, showing Cassandra herself as a youth, headstrong, proud, serving in Apollo's temple. Then it fractured into a dozen or more smaller ripples, each showing another scene from her life, flowing forward. \"It hardly seems like a life, does it?\" Cassandra said, watching the images play out in the river. Persephone reached her hand in, sending the flashes of Cassandra's life away in concentric circles. \"Each is worth something, no matter how short or how bitter.\" Cassandra didn't say anything in answer to that. \"You already know what I'm going to offer you.\" \"I do,\" Cassandra nodded. \"And I accept.\" Persephone pulled the mortal shade against her with one arm, while dipping into the water with her other. Cassandra closed her eyes and shuddered again as the goddess pressed dripping wet fingers to her lips. As the water dripped onto her tongue, she relaxed into Persephone's arms. The goddess pressed her lips to Cassandra's forehead, and then to her lips. Cassandra's eyelids fluttered and opened slowly, calm, no longer angry or haunted. \"Who?\" The shade blinked at the goddess smiling down at her. Persephone smiled. \"Go on, then. May the Fates be kinder this time.\" The shade waded across the Lethe, not sure what would happen next but unafraid.",

    "text": "Everyone knows the Big Six. Brothers. Sisters. Falsely imprisoned for a crime they didn't commit. Their mom busted them out with help from the littlest. So, yes. When her daughter is taken, Demeter is already no stranger to dank, dark places. Everyone knows that little boys are made of slugs and snails and puppy dog tails. It's a lesser-known fact that little girls are made of sugar and spice, and flowers, and Tommy guns. Demeter is not worried.. The boys hold grudges enough to bludgeon the world into submission. The girls hold grudges too, though they are more subtle. Do not mention Pyrrhos. Demeter sees your Tantalus and raises you an Aithon.. Everyone thinks that the boys run the Big Six; that the Olympian mafia belongs to Zeus. It's more of a figurehead-type position, says Demeter to a reporter, idly studying her perfectly manicured nails. He's basically just a patsy. Zeus is furious when the article is run. Demeter laughs and laughs; anger like this conceived Persephone. Hera tells her that she mustn't goad him so and Hestia hums by the fireplace. Demeter hikes up her skirt and steals a motorbike. She laughs and she doesn't wear a helmet; she leaves flowers and smog in her wake. She goes to the docks, where Poseidon has most of his dealings. She knows that his goons watch her; dressed in white with ivory boots laced up to the middle of her thighs. \"Shouldn't you be out looking for your kid?\" asks Poseidon. \"She can handle herself,\" says Demeter and she sits astride Poseidon's lap; foolish big brother, bamboozled by a pretty face. \"She is her mother's daughter.\" Poseidon lets out a low whistle. \"Poor Hades.\" So that's where Persephone is.. Demeter does not bestow favours easily. Zeus and Poseidon and Hades know this, best of all. She is no quicker to anger than they are but it is unseemly, they say. She sits on Zeus' desk and swings her feet back and forth. She is not sullen. She lifts her chin and looks from one to the other. She could suffocate them with springtime blooms, she could smother them with bay leaves and hemlock and asphodel and pitch black roses. She could upset this uneasy alliance of six with a click of her fingers and funeral wreaths and stifling, choking lilies. Askalophos, they can overlook. No one likes a snitch. Askalabos took his life in his hands when he made a mockery of Demeter's thirst. He had it coming. Anyone would have done the same. Kolontas, they cannot forgive. Oh, he probably deserved to die but arson is petty and an entire city block perished with her incandescence. Demeter smiles. She looks from one to the other. They take a step back.. There is a bar. The muses sing there, sometimes, on open mic night and it seems desperately unfair. Kleio and Calliope conspire in the corners and Calliope knows a little bit about Hades and the absurdity of love, when her sweet boy never returned. Hestia likes flaming sambuca and Hera drinks champagne and Demeter's drink of choice tonight is a mojito, fragrant and tart, and, come to think of it, no one has seen Minthe for days and days. It is probably not wise, for all these queens of this underworld to be in the same public place but they are so much more than gangsters' molls. They are the power behind the thrones. Persephone passes by and exchanges a smile with her mother. The men do well to look at their pints, the dartboard, the pool tables; at anywhere but their womenfolk, who would reign over the world if it was worth ruling.. Demeter dreams in a kaleidoscope of colour and when she wakes up, the ground is white and the people are starving. She has been underestimated. She is not a sentimental woman. She does not weep like women weep. Zeus tells her to undo it. She has never liked being told what to do. She likes the snow. It is a clean slate. Underneath, there is a riot, dampened by the white fall. The people are starving, though. She is sorry about that. They are not all Aithon. They do not all deserve it. You don't know what you have until it's gone. She chides Zeus and pats his cheek condescendingly. She knows the role he played in her daughter's disappearance. The fact that Persephone is his daughter too is meaningless. She has been underestimated. Her wrath is not hysterical; she does not turn spurning lovers to trees. Her anger is cold; it is the ice that strangles the whole world. It is the ice that seeps down through the soil and turns tree roots to spun glass. She whispers her apologies to the evergreens; they do not want to be deciduous but their leaves and needles are sloughing off and they are disconsolate and inconsolable. Hestia keeps the fire in. She understands what Demeter must do.. She plays poker with her sisters and her nieces. They trade secrets and power. They laugh at their brothers and their nephews, who are so certain that they rule the world while bending over backwards to keep their goddesses happy. Demeter knows the secret of power. It is the top button of Zeus' shirt. It is the rough denim of Poseidon's damp jeans. It is the whites of Hades' eyes. It is every winter, the harsh and the mild, and her brothers do not trust her because she is stronger than even they know. She has priests and priestesses, attendants and personal assistants. She smiles and it is enough to put fear in the hearts of her enemies. Snow falls soft and silent and Persephone is secreted in one of Hades' clubs and there is, somehow, laughter in the air and the knife-sharp sounds of ice-skates and the soft flumph of snowballs and the long-suffering sighs of her evergreens. There is a blade in her thigh-high boots and her brothers cross their legs when she walks past. Hestia keeps the fire in. Hera laughs just to see Zeus flinch. Demeter holds her chin up and dreams of peonies, sage and acorns. They are so much more than gangsters' molls.",

    "text": "The benefit to being considered the \"village idiot\" was it allowed you to meet all sorts of people. Which is why, Cassandra supposed, she currently found herself pouring tea for a dark-haired woman she had never seen, whose accent she could not quite place, and whose clothes did not quite match the village garb. Still, from before she had been banished by Apollo, her mother had instilled in her an impeccable sense of manners, so she poured this strange woman tea, and asked sweetly, \"Honey?\" \"No,\" the woman shook her head, and eyed one of the cakes Cassandra had very carefully set out, \"thank you.\" Cassandra sat back on her haunches, wary. It was not often she had guests. She had long since taken residence in the temple, for despite all she had been through, it was still the one place she felt even remotely safe. True, the villagers would occasionally come, asking her a question, only to laugh when she spoke of visions and dreams, ones she knew to be true, even if they did not believe. Apollo had taken much from her in the callous use of his curse on her, but he would not take her pride, or her will. This woman, however, was not like the others. She had a wildness about her; she smelled like the moors Cassandra had only seen in dreams. \"You think too much, child,\" the woman spoke, startling Cassandra from her thoughts. Cassandras blinked, before ducking her head. \"I am not a child, not anymore.\" The woman watched her a moment over her tea cup. \"No, I suppose you are not.\" She set her tea cup down. \"You angered a god, after all.\" \"How do you --?\" She hesitated. People talked, she knew. Her tale of woe - how Apollo had offered her his gift of prophecy, and taken it back when she had rejected his advances. She had been young, she had stupidly thought he'd be content with simple affections, rather than his purposeful chase of her womanhood. But the story told only partly the truth. She had kept her womanhood ultimately, but so had she kept the gift of Apollo's prophecy. Did this woman - \"Has the tale reached your lands too?\" \"Lands, my child?\" The woman smiled, and Cassandra shivered, for there was something chilling, but also melancholy, about her smile. \"I have no lands anymore than you any longer have people.\" She leaned forward. \"I can help you.\" \"No one can help me.\" \"Is that what they tell you? Is that what your god told you? Gods are made to anger, my dear. They are made to be fought against.\" \"How so?\" Cassandra asked, her interest piqued. \"You might say I worship gods similar to yours. We call them by different names, and attach different entities to those names. The god I worship as War, for example, we call Morrigan, and our god is a she. But the sentiments are the same. Our beliefs are as old as time. But there are those who believe, like time, our beliefs must change. They try to add new names and new meanings to our gods, calling them now the one true god, and his son and saviour. Our mother, maiden, and crone, they now call Mary.\" Her look was far away. \"The sentiments are still the same, all religions are connected, but they do not see that. Those that do not believe these new gods, are punished. I bore a son to my king and brother, born of the Mother Goddess herself, and while he is heralded as an heir-prince in my brother's kingdom, I am banished to the darker corners of the kingdom.\" She smiled then, and again, Cassandra saw something chilling and sad in her expression. She leaned forward. \"I, too, am a prophetess, my child. Would you like to know a secret?\" \"Secrets do not sit well with me, I am afraid. I know too many. I speak too many.\" \"This one I hope you will never speak.\" The woman watched her expectantly, and and finally - hesitantly - Cassandra nodded. \"My brother and my son - king and prince, father and son - will fight each other in the end. And my brother, mistrusting me for what he feels was my betrayal, will cast aside the sheath I weaved for him, threaded with magic, and love, and blood, leaving him vulnerable. He will die by his son's hand in the end, though he too will mortally wound his son. This is my curse, my child, that I will be lost to protect the one I love the most. But when he dies, I will go to him again, and at least then, he will know.\" Cassandra swallowed. For a moment, she felt compelled to tell this woman everything. How she distrusted men after Apollo's betrayal, how she mistrusted most people. How in the end, her love, too, was not enough, not wanted. How she was both the betrayer and the betrayed. How while Apollo may not have taken her womanhood, he stole her childhood all the same. How her only friend in the darker corners of the temple was Artemis, Apollo's sister, taken pity on her, her brother's cast-aside. But she said nothing. Nothing of the sweet village boy who had wooed her, only to throw her to the wolves when she had dared to step back into the sunlight. Nothing of the father and mother who had cast her aside because they no longer wanted a daughter who talked such \"nonsense\". But she said nothing. Here, in these hollows, she did not tell her secrets. She heard them, and she remembered them, and as it was needed, she spoke them, and they, like hers unspoken, went unheeded. But perhaps the woman understood. Because after a few moments, she finished her tea, and stood. Cassandra scrambled to her feet, rather ungracefully compared to the woman's. \"I thank you, my child, for the hospitality. I would offer to return your favor, but I doubt we will meet again.\" And even as the woman spoke it, Cassandra knew it to be true. \"My name is Cassandra,\" she said, and perhaps the woman knew, it was the first time since Apollo that she had given her name willingly. \"I know,\" the woman smiled. \"And mine is Morgan le Fey.\" She bowed slightly. \"Blessed be, child,\" and before Cassandra could respond, she was gone. **** It was some years yet later, an afternoon deep in the heart of a seemingly eternal winter, when Cassandra heard the news whispered. A king had fallen in a land turned to the newer gods, and the Maiden herself had met him in his passing, and had embraced him. Cassandra had bowed her head at the news, knowing, understanding. And smiling, hood pushed back, she went out to greet the awakening spring.",

    "text": "Learning to love Electra, Pylades thought, was the most dangerous adventure he'd yet embarked on. But it had the potential to be the most glorious as well. Not that glory was forthcoming at the moment, crowded into the bottom of a swift-oared ship, winging its way towards the Symplegades. It was briny, and breathless, and cramped. Not what he had been lead to believe. he had been raised on tales of the thousand ships that sailed for Helen, but if they were ships like this, and this keel had once rested on a Trojan shore, not ten years past, then he could not imagine how their proud fathers had borne it. Phocis was a country of pastoral hills, and he had never set foot on a seafaring ship before Menelaus' grudging loan had sent them off, out of Mycenae, out of Greece, as good as banished. Only Orestes believed this was anything but a voyage into exile, and Orestes - proud, principled Orestes, his cousin, the best of his friends - Orestes was mad, an inconstant murmuring shadow of the man he had grown up beside. They leaned against him, he and Electra, one on either side, keeping him warm and dry from the sea-spray, and they talked, to comfort their brother and drown his portentous muttering. Pylades recalled to him the adventures of their youth, triumphant and inglorious alike - the shared laughter of failed hunts, the gold shine of the firelight at feasts, the warmest of memories, to soothe him. Electra spoke of history and justice. \"The House of Atreus has always eaten its young,\" she said. There was a snarl in her voice that never went away. Every word she spoke had been wrought of grief and hate for so long that even when she rejoiced, there was something guttural lurking in her throat. It alarmed him, sometimes, but he didn't fear it. It was admirable. It was her determination, bright-beaten bronze and sharp as any sword. \"A curse and a sin, but not a mortal one. Our thrice-great grandfather is Kronos, who feared his children and devoured them. Even his father Ouranos tried to re-womb the Hecatonkheires, and hurled them into darkness when that failed. Great-great grandfather Zeus, who set down the laws, still permitted Zagreus to be torn to shreds and eaten, still flung Hephaestus from the heights, and himself gulped down Athena. \"But still, when Tantalus offered up Pelops as a feast to the Olympians, they despised him, mortal son of their king, and in the name of justice pieced Atreus together again and made him live. When Atreus punished the traitor Thyestes by feeding him the flesh of his sons, the son that survived sought vengeance against our father, Atreus' son, blameless Agamemnon. And even he - he, Orestes! - gave our sister Iphigenia to the gods. If they feast on the cattle we burn for them, did they not then feed on the flesh of Tantalus' line again? \"As Zeus overthrew Cronus, as kingship passes from father to son, it's the way of the world for the old to give way for the young. Their labors, their legacy, is meant to feed us, not the other way around. Even the criminals who destroy their children call it injustice! So that unnatural mother who would have had you killed in your cradle to appease the defiler of our father's bed - she deserved the fate of Tantalus, or the fate of Kronos. You did no wrong. Send the Furies back to the line of our grandfathers if you will, but be mine, be Orestes, again.\" \"What of Hermione?\" Orestes answered, and shuddered, and looked away. Pylades wrapped an arm tighter around his shoulder. \"Hermione lives,\" he said, which was truth, but he felt a guilty twinge nonetheless. Hermione lived, but her life had been the price that bought them exile, and not death. Her survival had been the first bright point amidst darkness and turmoil, a hesperine star. Some of that darkness had been passed down as a dark inheritance, as Electra described, but some of it they had wrought. No, that was not fair. There, too, Orestes was innocent. He and Electra had done that. It was Orestes, and his madness, that had saved them. *** \"The fever will break,\" Electra murmured, running the corner of her peplos over his brow, already damp with dew and sweat, impossible to tell the two apart where they sat in the hollow of an untended grove. \"The nightmare will end. Dawn will come for you as you came for me, Orestes. You don't need to fear anything, not you.\" Those were the first words Pylades heard when he returned to them, and they all but stopped his heart - not the pleasant jump he felt when Orestes called him brother, or when first Electra's downturned mouth and shadowed eyes had smiled at him, but a dull silence between beats, the end of this day prefigured. To hear Electra's growl become tender, that smoky rasp softened, was a joy, but he could hear already the catscratch her voice would become when he broke the news to her. And he had neither cause nor right to wait, not now. \"The verdict's returned,\" he said, drawing their eyes to him - wide and hopeful, and neither, perhaps, more lucid than the other. Both of them lived in other worlds, both for good reason. \"Did Menelaus' words sway our jurors to pity?\" Orestes' voice was all but indifferent. To one suffering the punishments of the gods, the verdicts of man meant little. He sounded weary, that was all, already but a shade of the Orestes Pylades had known. \"Ask rather, did they bring them to clarity?\" Electra asked, but Pylades was already shaking his head. \"Menelaus did not speak,\" he said, voice taut, trying to convey the news without trembling. \"Menelaus never showed himself. He provisions his ships, and his wife and daughter take their repose in the empty quarters most befitting their station. I pleaded, and some others... but the verdict is death. They would have come to deliver it themselves, but you have this much dignity granted: we can end things ourselves, together, rather than by their hands.\" \"Ourselves?\" Orestes' gaze sharpened, and he opened his mouth, but Electra spoke first. \"You stood no trial; you were sentenced to nothing. If the Argives condemn us rather than wreathing us in laurel, you should never suffer for it.\" It was the tenderest sentiment his betrothed had expressed, and it softened Orestes' frown, and for even that moment of surcease, Pylades was tempted. \"No. Survive the calamity that claimed my brother and my bride? I would be ashamed. I would be desolate. Tried or not, I have stood with you in every moment. Let no-one say I shied now, or feared the price, or doubt that I still believe in your rightness.\" \"The gods do not believe,\" Orestes husked. \"Apollo gave us every omen,\" Pylades countered, and looked to Electra. She could convince her brother, where he could not - perhaps because familiarity lacked authority, where memory granted it. She was still new to them both, and captivating. But it was also true that she, terrible as any Fury Pylades imagined, could brook no doubts. Whatever tormented her brother, she did not believe it was the Kindly Ones. \"You are not some Hyperborean barbarian-prince, to stand hesitating when the divine call for is clear,\" she said, leaning in near to him and nodding. \"She killed our father. Failing to avenge him would bring divine vengeance, if any action would so stir them from their complacent audience. If mere audacity roused them, if slaughter touched their hearts, we would have seen it long before.\" Pylades nodded, then blinked as she rounded on him, his heart stuttering. \"But you must live. You must. If every fruit on the tree we've watered is bitter, then someone must survive to tend it. My brother's sword will do for us, Pylades, but for you, your own sword has better purposes. Whether we slay ourselves or not, this verdict was wrong. It is no suicide, and no execution. It is murder. You must not let this verdict go unavenged.\" \"One man against a city? If there were seven of me, I could not avenge you. I can do more for you by raising the temper of Phocis against this injustice than by any act, any word, and nothing will strike them as strongly as the death of their prince. They cannot fail me. And I cannot fail you.\" \"Not the Argives,\" Electra said, tautly dismissive. \"Nor our grandfather, grieving his daughter, who drove them to it. Foolishness and spite cloud them, but they have tried to do right. It is Menelaus who has sinned against us, Menelaus who forebore to say the word that would have stayed our sentence, Menelaus whose wife and daughter now rest in our beds. He has chosen his own profit over duty to family, when his family has given all for him. Faithless, reneger of debts, he must not be allowed to forget our deaths even if all others do. \" \"What would you have me do?\" Pylades asked, stricken, rhetorical. \"What sensible course can I take to right your memory among the living? What options offer themselves, that are worth shunning death to pursue? Should I wait for some other miserable course to be plotted and laid down by Apollo? Should I kill Helen, who began Achaia's grief?\" *** He had weeks on the ship to reflect on what they had done. Electra grew more proud, Orestes more anguished, but Pylades only felt puzzled. Each of them was certain of what had befallen, and he stood between, sorting their accounts. It had been a mad plan, a bid for life that he was only too happy to embrace, watching it bring hope back into these two dear faces. Enter the palace; kill Helen, seize Hermione, threaten to kill the girl too and burn all of it down if they were not granted safe-passage and one of Menelaus' freshly provisioned ships. It was their first true battle, and truthfully, on the whole he preferred murder. The house had been in chaos. Helen's foreign armsmen had been caught off-guard, beaten back or slain with easy strokes of the sword meant for them to end their lives. Electra's eyes had kindled at it, unafraid, and he had marveled at her. They had found Hermione, but no sign of Helen, and as they split to quarter the building and secure the doors, at each new turn Orestes bore new report of the gods' will. They pressed onward. Pylades brought Hermione to the roof, where Orestes waited with a vision from Apollo - that truth-telling god whose advice had brought them only confusion and grief. But he could not say it. Not while they had purpose to hold them fast against despair. He had given the girl to Orestes, watched in fascination the shouted negotiations with baffled Menelaus. And then... *** \"I'm putting down the sword,\" Orestes said, wary-eyed, and didn't, letting the tip waver and stray like an autumn leaf trembling in the wind. Cautiously, Hermione lifted a hand to his wrist, pushing at it stiff-fingered until there was space enough for her to step away. One step, two, and then she ran, and he laughed, light-headed and nervous. \"Olympian Gods,\" Pylades breathed, gratefully. \"All alive. Alive and redeemed.\" Electra stepped up behind the pair of them, wrapping one arm around each in an embrace as tight as a serpent's coil. \"We did it,\" she said, low and fierce and satisfied. \"At last, at last we've won.\" \"Alive and victorious,\" Orestes answered them both. \"But not yet free.\" *** As they sailed, Electra let her hair grow long, leaving her mourning behind her. Her fierceness did not dim, but she smiled more often. She mapped the line past which her utterances would make the still-fragile Orestes tremble, and once mapped, she did not cross it before him. With Pylades she was bolder. She had so much to say held behind her lips, years of living with her father's killers having taught her to temper, but not silence, her opinions. He would not for the world have denied her the freedom of her tongue. Orestes still insisted this journey would carry them home, triumphant, once they had retrieved some lost image of Artemis' that had made its way to Tauris' barbarian shore. Apollo had vouched for it, he said, trusting, in those calm moments where he remembered the face of the god and forgot the whispers of the Furies that he also still heard, hounding him onward. Pylades and Electra exchanged glances over him as they played nursemaid. They would not deny him, either, held in tension of his duty for so long and now released of it. In bleaker moments, it struck Pylades as comic that Electra, who never for a moment had doubted the rightness of their cause or their course, was as skeptical as he of unseen Apollo's reassurance. But her long years of restraint had taught her to doubt the authority and the justice of the gods, and seeing Orestes now was reason enough not to regain faith with their vindication. As they approached the straits of Bosphorus, and the great dark rocks of the Symplegades, frozen now and forever but still enough to incite sailors to fear, Pylades found Electra beneath the deck, sawing through a lock of hair with a bronze dagger, and for a moment he despaired. Then she saw him, and smiled her narrow smile again, and lowered the knife. \"I have no home in which to host the feast, no father to grant me to you, no mother to prepare me, and my sisters are far away,\" she said. \"So the feast will be here, and I will prepare myself, and grant myself, and dedicate myself... at the temple in Tauris, once Orestes believes himself absolved. I have a brother, and I will have a husband, and I mean to see both well, and both mine, as you should have been long ago.\" \"You'll have everything you were denied,\" he told her \"Yes,\" she told him. \"We all will.\" He clasped her hands, and when the white-horned curve of Tauris' sandy shores rose on the edge of the world before them, he stood between, and clasped both their hands, and hoped for their hopes.",

    "text": "Do you remember, my Triptolemus, how to bring forth your crop? I've certainly showed you enough times. Seeds are tricky, after all; they take nourishing and care before you simply drop them into the ground. Dry them before Helios's rays--but not too much!--keep them safe from beady-eyed birds, and tuck them into the soil, safe and warm. That's a good lad. Well done. Arion was my first child to leave, and never did I wail for him; not even when his visits dwindled to mad dashes around our meadows, my Kore on his back, laughing. The gods had need of him, his father and his brother both, to be lent out to mortals like a common beast of burden--but though I bore him, I let him go without so much as a reproach. My brother Zeus would do well to remember that when he complains of me. Not like that, boy! Till the field straight across, with a steady hand. If you can't muster up the strength to make your mark on the earth, how can you ever expect to produce anything for you in return? Gentleness has its place, but not here; this is a battle you fight with hunger, and you must win. Keep that in mind. My Kore, now, she was a child who burned with ambition. I told her once, how weary I was, of bringing forth the fruits and plants and green things of the earth in all times of the year, in rain and summer and snow, for mortals were soft-handed and soft-headed, and if they lacked nourishment, they would perish and offer us no sacrifice. But all good things must come from Gaia, and my grandmother is nothing but stubborn, her grudge against my brother never forgotten. \"If you tire, Mother, let me bear them instead,\" said Kore with a smile, only a hair too eager, \"and I'll keep them safe.\" (She is a practical girl. All my children are practical, Plutus and Philomelus and Chrysothemis alike, always ready to squeeze out advantage where they can get it. Sometimes I indulge them, even.) I smiled, so sadly, and said: \"I would that I could, daughter; but this is my task, and my responsibility alone, and I would have you free of cares.\" I did not have to say, unlike me. I did not have to remind her that while my brothers had drawn lots for the division of the world, we sisters had not; instead we had merely been given dominions, by our brother's decree rather than that of chance. My daughter knows her history well. Kore gave me a sidelong glance, but she stayed silent. But I remembered that look, and I wasn't surprised the morning when I found her gone out dancing with her handmaidens, and the power of the earth's bounty slipped from my bedside and gone with her. Unfortunate, though, that Hades spied her with them, too, that she was still in possession of them when he dragged her down. I think-- Now don't think I miss you eyeing those flowers, young man; a sweetheart, is it? And at your age? But I can hardly speak; my brothers were barely out of our father's gullet when they began their courtships, the more elaborate, the better. We laughed well, then; Hera and Hestia and I, until Zeus's eye fell on Hera, Poseidon's on me, and Hestia, the wisest of us three, crept back into her hearth. Pick your blooms, then, any you choose. Whichever you pluck, they will be beautiful; they are my only riches now. I had a son, Plutus, born to be the master of wealth; but he lives empty-handed now, without even his brother Philomelus's innovations to sustain him. This, too, was a decree of the gods, who hated him just as they had hated--and murdered--his father. Plutus came to me, only once, to complain of his plight, and Kore wept with him. A kind-hearted girl, my daughter; and fond of her brothers. She never would forgive any slight against them. One day Kore came to me and said-- Well done, Triptolemus! Water them, just like that, and watch over them with all your care; this is the most delicate stage, where anything could mean the difference between a flourishing crop and a barren field. Put all your cunning to work, to coax the start of seedling to grow, to unfurl itself, to stretch out into what it must become. Now Kore said to me, \"Mother, why will you not put me to work?\" and I had to tell her, \"because, my daughter, there is no work for you to do.\" She scowled. \"My brothers slay monsters, win praise from mortals, and earn their places in the Elysian Fields, and I? I frolic in the meadows with my maids.\" I held my hands up, helpless. \"Your father thinks you might be well suited to the care of flowers,\" I offered. \"Flowers,\" Kore repeated flatly. \"And perhaps soon, some young man will like the sight of you,\" I went on; better to let the girl to expect her fate sooner rather than later; \"so he will ask your father for his approval and then bestow his love upon you (or bestow first and ask later) and your only care will be his pleasure.\" She pressed her lips together until they were white. \"And is such a existence all I might hope for, Mother?\" \"Yes,\" I said, gently, \"and there's no wisdom in defiance unless you could think to match your father's power--or even that of his brothers', for that matter.\" \"Hmm,\" said Kore, her mouth twisting in that particular way she had inherited from Gaia of the crafty mind. She walked alone for quite some time that night, and when she came back, \"I love you, Mother,\" was all she would say. I saw darkness in her eyes, and the smell of the Styx in her hair, but her chin was raised high and her eyes were unafraid and unremorseful. I asked no questions. I dared not. \"I love you, my darling,\" I told her instead. \"I always will.\" It is a difficult thing, planting seeds, casting them into the ground and having not a sign of how they fare until the day they peek back into the sunlight, carefully at first, and then more quickly. One day, you see, the plants you grow, will produce seeds one of their own in turn, ones more useful than you could even imagine. Why, it takes no more than six to bring all your plans to fruition, provided your use them carefully. They tell me Kore must stay back in the underworld as Queen for half the year still, despite Zeus's arbitration; and so my bounty must rest below the earth for men and women like you, Triptolemus, to bring up from the earth on your own strength. Hermes brought the news to me, ashen-faced and anxious, asking now would I bring forth harvests to the world. And I had to shrug and say: \"Tell my brother I am sorry. It is too late. They have gone with Kore.\" My rage is calmed, but I am helpless, you see, before what my daughter has done, before what has become of her. Perhaps, I added, I should have done as she asked years before, and given over my bounty to her. Perhaps then she--and more importantly to the gods, it--would still be safe. \"Yes,\" replied Hermes distractedly, \"yes. Perhaps it would.\" He told me this, too: Hades, as a gift to his bride, had given her brother Plutus lordship over wealth; and the new god's sister clasped his hands, smiling, and told him to scatter it wherever he went, to bring joy to all as she had brought joy to him. Hermes bit his lip, then, like so, as though the stirrings of guilt touched him, and asked, \"Are you not pleased now, Lady Demeter?\" \"Not now,\" I said, \"but I shall be.\" Planting-time will come soon, after all, and with it, my Kore, loathe though she will be to leave Persephone behind. The Underground might have been the least of the lots that my brothers cast, but it is one of them nonetheless, and as its queen, she stands equal to any of my brothers. But she will be happy to see me; and I will smooth her hair back, and tell her stories, and take her to see her brothers. One way or the other, we will while the days away until harvest comes and she returns underground to send up the nourishment that the mortals will need. Ah. Look now, what a fine ear of corn you've grown. Now go, lad, take what I have taught you, spread it throughout the world, and bear my blessing. But most of all, never, never forgot what I have shown you today, and never forget what I have effected. Let someone, at least, remember.",

    "text": "\"Persephone's missing,\" Artemis said, bursting into the Olympus menagerie. Athena looked up from smoothing the pinfeathers of her littlest owl. \"Are you sure?\" she asked. \"It's not like Persephone isn't known for wandering off. You remember the time she got lost in Babylon and came back absolutely covered in dirt, with petals in her hair and twigs sticking out everywhere. I'd never seen her so happy. She's probably coaxing a fruit tree to bloom somewhere somewhere as we speak. She'll be back.\" Athena stroked a finger down the owlet's chest; he chirruped with pleasure and nibbled her finger. Artemis shook her head. \"No, something doesn't feel right. She would never be gone for more than two weeks, even during bloom--not without stopping by at least once.\" She looked at Athena sharply. \"I'm going to look for her. Are you going to help me?\" Athena sighed. \"Well, of course I'll help, even if this does all sound a bit far-fetched and not at all thought through.\" She cuddled the owlet and placed him back to roost with his fellows. \"We'll need to come up with a logical plan of attack, of course. Find out where she was last, which direction she was going, who she spoke to, what she may have been doing.\" Artemis rolled her eyes. \"Please. I'm the goddess of the hunt. I can tell which direction she may be going.\" \"Well then, why do you need me along, o mighty huntress?\" Artemis scowled. \"To tell me things like 'ask who she spoke to last.'\" *** \"Now that you mention it, I haven't seen her since she asked me to carry that message to the dryads on Sparta. Pretty little things, too, if a tad too bold for my tastes. Can't say I didn't enjoy myself, though,\" Hermes said. \"You have something against bold nymphs?\" Artemis put her hand on her bow. \"Ahem, if I might put this back on track,\" Athena said. \"We're also looking for Demeter.\" She caught Artemis's surprised look. \"I'm sure Demeter knows exactly where Persephone is; those two are peas in a pod, pun intended. A girl like Persephone would never stray too far from her mother. Finding one will mean finding the other.\" \"Says the one without a mother,\" said Artemis. \"Can't have it all, I suppose. Well, Hermes, any ideas?\" \"Hmmm, you might try Hera. Last I saw, they having a friendly little chat over ambrosia and honey.\" *** Hera smiled coldly. \"If it isn't Zeus's favorite daughters. How lovely of you girls to pay me a visit.\" Athena and Artemis looked at each other. \"Shall we have some wine?\" Hera asked. \"We'll catch up, and you can tell me everything happening in those little spheres of yours.\" \"Please, Majesty,\" Athena said, mustering her courage. \"We were told Demeter had visited you recently. We're looking for her.\" \"It's Persephone,\" Artemis cut in. \"She's missing.\" \"We don't speak nearly enough at all,\" Hera continued. \"How often everyone forgets the common courtesies that make life pleasant. A shame my sister Demeter thinks she can just drop in and that I would be sentimental about some bastard child she bore while cheating with my husband.\" \"Thank you, Majesty,\" Artemis said, standing up and pushing Athena out the door. I'm sure we'll think long and carefully about what you've said. Especially Athena.\" \"Friendly, my ass,\" Athena said, once they were back on safer ground. *** \"Why you girls are asking the sea-god for his advice on a land matter makes no sense at all to me.\" Artemis glanced at Athena. \"Not to be blunt, Uncle,\" she said, \"but it's imperative that we find Demeter. Persephone is missing. I thought it might be a small matter or some late work, but now I'm convinced that something is terribly wrong. I can feel it with all of my being. And, erm, given your relationship with our aunt, we thought you might be able to tell us something. Anything. The smallest trail would be enough for me, but I need somewhere to start.\" Poseidon considered, his sea-foam robes swirling around him. His tidal horses reared their heads impatiently, eager to be on the move again. \"You might try Mount Parnassus,\" he said finally. \"I think she might be there.\" He looked sharply at them. \"Don't interfere with what you don't know, Artemis. You judge too quickly and too harshly. There are always depths to be plumbed.\" \"Why, what do you know?\" Artemis cried, but Poseidon was gone already. \"He's just a cranky old man, isn't he?\" Athena said. *** \"Do you see that?\" Artemis said, pointing. \"...what is it that I'm looking at, exactly?\" \"The grass. Don't you see how it's been touched? Somebody's walked this way.\" \"It just looks like grass to me,\" Athena said. \"It's bent! All these stems are! And judging by the smell, it was done recently. Oh, and look this way. That's a footprint, or I'll eat my sandal.\" \"I'm still not sure I see it, but I'll take your word for it.\" \"Help me look around for others. If we can find more, that's the trail. We'll find someone for sure.\" Artemis knelt, looking intently at various grasses and occasionally taking a sniff. She rubbed dirt between her fingers and sniffed that, too. Athena toed a fallen branch and tried to decide if the whorl in the bark signified anything. Artemis looked up. \"Can't you see anything? Even Persephone was able to help when we were tracking that stag.\" \"Excuse me, just because I spend most of my days thinking indoors instead of running about everywhere all the time like you two, and getting into all kinds of mud and mess while learning what every animal and grass stem thinks does not make me ineffectual. I'm sure Persephone was able to see every little difference to her flowers, but I just can't. You should know better.\" \"No, you're right. I'm sorry. I couldn't have gotten here without you, after all. I'm grateful.\" \"She's my sister, too,\" Athena said. Artemis sighed. \"I know. I just can't help feeling particularly responsible. Goddess or no, she's a maiden, and under my protection.\" Her brow darkened. \"And giving Poseidon's hints, I'm not under any illusions.\" \"We'll find her,\" Athena said quietly. \"Yes,\" Artemis said. A breeze wafted over the mountaintop, and Zeyphr gave them a friendly wave as he zipped past, taking with him various bits of green debris. Something caught Artemis's eye. \"That's different,\" she said. \"What is?\" \"That leaf. It's red.\" \"That's an odd color for a leaf,\" said Athena. \"And look at that one, all dried up. It's the strangest thing I've ever seen,\" said Artemis. One of the dried, brown things rasped against Athena's foot. She toed it gently, and it crumbled under the touch. A horror suffused her being. \"These plants...they're dying.\" \"Oh, no,\" said Artemis, her face losing all color. \"You don't think Persephone...Quickly! We need to trace those leaves!\" They set off, Artemis leaping swiftly, pausing only to check that they were on the right trail. Neither of them said aloud what was in their hearts--the dread that strikes every immortal. When they crested the peak, Athena had to grab Artemis to stop her from falling into the chasm that gaped at their feet. The dark maw lay open. Sharp spears of rock thrust through the crumbling earth as the sighs of the lost echoed around them. All around the edges, death spread, withering blooms, shriveling leaves, killing light, forcing the earth to curl back upon itself. \"Yes,\" a voice said behind them. Artemis and Athena whirled to face the new threat, an arrow already nocked in Artemis's bow. Demeter stood before them, body rigid, face cold, dress whipping in the wind, and bare feet rooted into the ground. She looked at the young goddesses. \"Yes,\" she repeated. \"Now you understand what has transpired here.\" *** \"I looked everywhere. I knew she was gone the instant I no longer felt her footsteps upon the earth, but I had no idea what could have happened,\" Demeter said, as the three goddesses sped towards Olympus. \"I've been seeking her since but, sadly, I do not travel as fast as either of you; my spirit is rather more patient than fleet-footed. I arrived at the mountain moments before you.\" Her voice, cold before, turned to pure frost. \"Hades will answer.\" At Olympus, she marched into Zeus's throne room to confront the king of the gods where he lounged, one leg thrown carelessly over the throne's armrest, goblet in hand. His eyes lit up jovially as he spied the three. \"Demeter! Baby!\" he called, pushing himself into a more upright position. \"And there are my baby girls!\" He grabbed each goddess for a smacking kiss on the lips as they approached. Demeter yielded not an inch, remaining stony and formal. \"Zeus, your brother has taken my daughter--our daughter. The land of the dead is anathema to a creature of light and youth. I demand that he return her at once. I demand that you ensure it. As king and as father, you must have her returned.\" \"Well, now, Dee, he's your brother, too. I'm sure if you asked nicely--\" \"Do not trifle with a mother's heart, Zeus, unless you would dare the consequences, for I can assure you, nothing means so much as she. I would rather leave the world a hollow shell than allow Persephone to remain a moment longer in that valley of silence and nothingness.\" Zeus frowned. \"Dee, you know our agreement. Hades has his realm as I have mine. We don't interfere with each other, and the living and the dead keep their peace.\" \"Then he can have no claim to Persephone! For she is of your realm as much as any other living being, is she not?\" Zeus's frown deepened. Artemis hesitated, and pulled out the dead leaf she had scooped up on the mountain. \"Father, look at this. The earth is dying without Persephone. The people, the living creatures, even we gods,cannot do without her. There will be famine, disease, and so much death it will blur the line between the realms.\" Athena spoke up. \"She does not deserve to be condemned to the Underworld against her will. And...she's our sister, Father. We would miss her too much.\" Artemis said, \"Please, Father. Bring her home.\" Zeus looked at them for a few long seconds, then turned his head and said to Ganymede, \"Send for Hermes.\" *** They had been closeted for ages. Hermes had brought Persephone back, but whisked her immediately into private consultation with Zeus and Demeter. Hades had promptly appeared as well, without even a puff of cloud-smoke, and shut the door firmly behind him. Artemis paced in the great hall, while Athena sat meditatively, fingers tangled in the feathers of a great tawny owl. Suddenly the doors burst open, and Persephone ran out, face beaming. She grabbed Artemis and Athena in great hugs and kissed them both. \"Oh, darlings, how happy I am to see you!\" she exclaimed. \"I'm so sorry to have worried everyone, and I'm so grateful for the time you took to look for me, even though I wasn't at all lost, you know, not even a little bit.\" \"Not...lost?\" Artemis said dazedly. \"Well, of course not, darling!\" Persephone said. \"I know it's a little hard to believe, given my, you know, track record, but I quite knew where I was going and what I was doing! Dear Hades just needed a little help, that's all, and I decided I would give him that help.\" \"Persephone,\" Athena said slowly. \"Do you mean to say that he didn't, er, kidnap you and force you into the Underworld?\" \"Why, not at all! I got tired of seeing him try to make that mountain into something nice and failing utterly. Did you see that big hole he made? Terribly ugly, and it just keeps getting worse. Oh dear, Grandmother Rhea is going to have a fit, isn't she?\" \"Why was he here, then? And why is he trying to play decorator?\" \"That's what I've been helping him with. Those poor souls in the Underworld, they don't have any beauty at all, not even in the Elysium Fields. There's nothing for them but dark, damp, and stone everywhere. It's not that Hades wants to build a bridge between the dead and the living, but he wants those spirits who want to remember the lives they led to have a way. Those who want to forget have the Lethe, but there is no touchstone for remembrance and clarity. Beauty, light, and the tiniest breath of life, that's the way.\" She blushed. \"And of course, that's why I want to help him. I want to help things grow in the Underworld, to bring a bit of life into the land of the dead. And Hades has been so helpful, too! It hasn't been the easiest challenge I've taken on; I had the hardest time growing the smallest pomegranate tree. But he's been a dear about everything, and has opened complete access for me. That's why he was here, too, you know. To be helpful, and to, well, smooth things over with Mother and Father.\" Her brow clouded. \"A bridge between the land of the dead and the living works both ways. Death will seep through here while I'm there, and it turns out that I do need to personally encourage everything to work properly. But we've worked it all out with Mother, even if she was terribly angry with me. If I don't stay away too long from either realm, we should be able to muddle through all right. \"Thank you again,\" she said softly. \"It does mean so much to me that you searched for me.\" \"You are our sister,\" Athena said bluntly. She kissed Persephone on the cheek, and replaced her owl on her shoulder. \"Take care of yourself, yes? I need to take this fellow back home, but don't forget to say goodbye before you leave again.\" She walked to the door, but turned around a final time. \"I'm glad you're all right, Persephone,\" she said. Artemis drew Persephone into a fierce hug. \"I'm glad you're all right. But I'm going to miss you terribly while you're gone. We've never been separated for so long; who's going to run all over Akaia with me? Who's going to play with the bunnies and lecture me about not stepping on saplings?\" \"Yes,\" said Persephone. \"I told Hades over dinner last night that that's what I was going to miss the most, too. But we'll still get to do that! Just not, you know, the whole year--\" \"Wait, wait, just a moment,\" Artemis said. \"Dinner? Persephone, you didn't eat anything while with Hades, did you?\" Persephone blinked. \"Well, of course, I did, darling. I was hungry.\" Artemis threw her arms into the air. \"What about everything they say about food in the Underworld?\" \"Oh, that!\" Persephone laughed. \"That's just a story they tell to deter the tourists.\" She lowered her voice. \"Hades can be such a grump sometimes, you know.\" \"Great,\" Artemis said. \"I'm glad he's so much fun. Are you sweet on him?\" \"Don't be so sad!\" Persephone said. \"Like I said, it's only for a part of the year. I'll be back before you know it, and we'll go to all our favorite places. Don't look so pale, darling, although I'm sure you can't help it. I'm sorry to make you so sad, and to make your travels longer and harder while I'm away. I'll send you all the good gossip from the Underworld, too.\" \"What would that be?\" Artemis said. \"How Charon keeps losing coins because he doesn't wear pants? We're immortal. I am going to feel your loss forever.\" She sighed and hugged Persephone closer. \"I'll adapt. All of us will. But you never answered my question: are you sweet on Hades?\" \"I'm not answering that.\" Persephone smiled. \"This time, anyway. You'll have to make that part up yourself.\"",

      "\"Now you understand what has transpired here.\"",
      "*** \"I looked everywhere.",
      "I knew she was gone the instant I no longer felt her footsteps upon the earth, but I had no idea what could have happened,\" Demeter said, as the three goddesses sped towards Olympus.",
      "\"I've been seeking her since but, sadly, I do not travel as fast as either of you; my spirit is rather more patient than fleet-footed.",
      "I arrived at the mountain moments before you.\"",
      "Her voice, cold before, turned to pure frost.",
      "\"Hades will answer.\"",
      "At Olympus, she marched into Zeus's throne room to confront the king of the gods where he lounged, one leg thrown carelessly over the throne's armrest, goblet in hand.",
      "His eyes lit up jovially as he spied the three.",
      "\"Demeter!",
      "Baby!\"",
      "he called, pushing himself into a more upright position.",
      "\"And there are my baby girls!\"",
      "He grabbed each goddess for a smacking kiss on the lips as they approached.",
      "Demeter yielded not an inch, remaining stony and formal.",
      "\"Zeus, your brother has taken my daughter--our daughter.",
      "The land of the dead is anathema to a creature of light and youth.",
      "I demand that he return her at once.",
      "I demand that you ensure it.",
      "As king and as father, you must have her returned.\"",
      "\"Well, now, Dee, he's your brother, too.",
      "I'm sure if you asked nicely--\" \"Do not trifle with a mother's heart, Zeus, unless you would dare the consequences, for I can assure you, nothing means so much as she.",
      "I would rather leave the world a hollow shell than allow Persephone to remain a moment longer in that valley of silence and nothingness.\"",
      "Zeus frowned.",
      "\"Dee, you know our agreement.",
      "Hades has his realm as I have mine.",
      "We don't interfere with each other, and the living and the dead keep their peace.\"",
      "\"Then he can have no claim to Persephone!",
      "For she is of your realm as much as any other living being, is she not?\" Zeus's frown deepened.",
      "Artemis hesitated, and pulled out the dead leaf she had scooped up on the mountain.",
      "\"Father, look at this.",
      "The earth is dying without Persephone.",
      "The people, the living creatures, even we gods,cannot do without her.",
      "There will be famine, disease, and so much death it will blur the line between the realms.\"",
      "Athena spoke up.",
      "\"She does not deserve to be condemned to the Underworld against her will.",
      "And...she's our sister, Father.",
      "We would miss her too much.\"",
      "Artemis said, \"Please, Father.",
      "Bring her home.\"",
      "Zeus looked at them for a few long seconds, then turned his head and said to Ganymede, \"Send for Hermes.\"",
      "*** They had been closeted for ages.",
      "Hermes had brought Persephone back, but whisked her immediately into private consultation with Zeus and Demeter.",
      "Hades had promptly appeared as well, without even a puff of cloud-smoke, and shut the door firmly behind him.",
      "Artemis paced in the great hall, while Athena sat meditatively, fingers tangled in the feathers of a great tawny owl.",
      "Suddenly the doors burst open, and Persephone ran out, face beaming.",
      "She grabbed Artemis and Athena in great hugs and kissed them both.",
      "\"Oh, darlings, how happy I am to see you!\"",
      "she exclaimed.",
      "\"I'm so sorry to have worried everyone, and I'm so grateful for the time you took to look for me, even though I wasn't at all lost, you know, not even a little bit.\"",
      "\"Not...lost?\"",
      "Artemis said dazedly.",
      "\"Well, of course not, darling!\"",
      "Persephone said.",
      "\"I know it's a little hard to believe, given my, you know, track record, but I quite knew where I was going and what I was doing!",
      "Dear Hades just needed a little help, that's all, and I decided I would give him that help.\"",
      "\"Persephone,\" Athena said slowly.",
      "\"Do you mean to say that he didn't, er, kidnap you and force you into the Underworld?\" \"Why, not at all!",
      "I got tired of seeing him try to make that mountain into something nice and failing utterly.",
      "Did you see that big hole he made?",
      "Terribly ugly, and it just keeps getting worse.",
      "Oh dear, Grandmother Rhea is going to have a fit, isn't she?\"",
      "\"Why was he here, then?",
      "And why is he trying to play decorator?\"",
      "\"That's what I've been helping him with.",
      "Those poor souls in the Underworld, they don't have any beauty at all, not even in the Elysium Fields.",
      "There's nothing for them but dark, damp, and stone everywhere.",
      "It's not that Hades wants to build a bridge between the dead and the living, but he wants those spirits who want to remember the lives they led to have a way.",
      "Those who want to forget have the Lethe, but there is no touchstone for remembrance and clarity.",
      "Beauty, light, and the tiniest breath of life, that's the way.\"",
      "She blushed.",
      "\"And of course, that's why I want to help him.",
      "I want to help things grow in the Underworld, to bring a bit of life into the land of the dead.",
      "And Hades has been so helpful, too!",
      "It hasn't been the easiest challenge I've taken on; I had the hardest time growing the smallest pomegranate tree.",
      "But he's been a dear about everything, and has opened complete access for me.",
      "That's why he was here, too, you know.",
      "To be helpful, and to, well, smooth things over with Mother and Father.\"",
      "Her brow clouded.",
      "\"A bridge between the land of the dead and the living works both ways.",
      "Death will seep through here while I'm there, and it turns out that I do need to personally encourage everything to work properly.",
      "But we've worked it all out with Mother, even if she was terribly angry with me.",
      "If I don't stay away too long from either realm, we should be able to muddle through all right.",
      "\"Thank you again,\" she said softly.",
      "\"It does mean so much to me that you searched for me.\"",
      "\"You are our sister,\" Athena said bluntly.",
      "She kissed Persephone on the cheek, and replaced her owl on her shoulder.",
      "\"Take care of yourself, yes?",
      "I need to take this fellow back home, but don't forget to say goodbye before you leave again.\"",
      "She walked to the door, but turned around a final time.",
      "\"I'm glad you're all right, Persephone,\" she said.",
      "Artemis drew Persephone into a fierce hug.",
      "\"I'm glad you're all right.",
      "But I'm going to miss you terribly while you're gone.",
      "We've never been separated for so long; who's going to run all over Akaia with me?",
      "Who's going to play with the bunnies and lecture me about not stepping on saplings?\"",
      "\"Yes,\" said Persephone.",
      "\"I told Hades over dinner last night that that's what I was going to miss the most, too.",
      "But we'll still get to do that!",
      "Just not, you know, the whole year--\"",
      "\"Wait, wait, just a moment,\" Artemis said.",
      "\"Dinner?",
      "Persephone, you didn't eat anything while with Hades, did you?\" Persephone blinked.",
      "\"Well, of course, I did, darling.",
      "I was hungry.\"",
      "Artemis threw her arms into the air.",
      "\"What about everything they say about food in the Underworld?\"",
      "\"Oh, that!\"",
      "Persephone laughed.",
      "\"That's just a story they tell to deter the tourists.\"",
      "She lowered her voice.",
      "\"Hades can be such a grump sometimes, you know.\"",
      "\"Great,\" Artemis said.",
      "\"I'm glad he's so much fun.",
      "Are you sweet on him?\" \"Don't be so sad!\"",
      "Persephone said.",
      "\"Like I said, it's only for a part of the year.",
      "I'll be back before you know it, and we'll go to all our favorite places.",
      "Don't look so pale, darling, although I'm sure you can't help it.",
      "I'm sorry to make you so sad, and to make your travels longer and harder while I'm away.",
      "I'll send you all the good gossip from the Underworld, too.\"",
      "\"What would that be?\" Artemis said.",
      "\"How Charon keeps losing coins because he doesn't wear pants?",
      "We're immortal.",
      "I am going to feel your loss forever.\"",
      "She sighed and hugged Persephone closer.",
      "\"I'll adapt.",
      "All of us will.",
      "But you never answered my question: are you sweet on Hades?\"",
      "\"I'm not answering that.\"",
      "Persephone smiled.",
      "\"This time, anyway.",
      "You'll have to make that part up yourself.\""

    "text": "The day her mother gives birth to a horse is the day Persephone decides that she really needs a plan. It's not that she doesn't like Arion, because of course she does. He's cute - he's a foal, of course he's cute, all gangly limbs and awkwardness - well, once the blood and slime of newborn-ness is washed off, anyway. It's not that she doesn't like her new baby brother, because she does, she really does - it's just, once Eileithyia has finished washing him and wrapping him in clean cloth, she hands the long-legged bundle to Persephone. \"Here you go. You take care of him, while I see to your mother.\" Persephone stares at the warm bundle in her arms and then at the short, wrinkled goddess currently washing blood off her hands. \"But what am I supposed to do with him?\" \"The usual - hold him, feed him, burp him. Really, Persephone, you're almost a grown woman. You should know these things already, you'll be having your own soon enough.\" \"I? What? No, I won't!\" \"Oh, don't be silly, Persephone, I really don't have time for it. Now, go ask one of the nymphs to fetch some mare's milk and stop bothering me. Your mother needs stitches and I need to get to work now, if we're not going to have to send for Asclepius.\" And off she goes, closing the door behind her, leaving Persephone alone with her newborn brother in her arms, her mother's screams of pain still echoing in her ears and an absolute and total conviction that she is not, ever, under any circumstance, going to go through that. *** On the third day she hands her baby brother off to a gaggle of nymphs - who seem perfectly happy to pet him and coo over his tiny, adorable hooves and he seems perfectly content to let them, so that's all fine - and makes her escape. Admittedly, she makes her escape by way of walking out the front door, shouting over her shoulder \"I'm going to visit Aunt Hestia. See you later\" as she goes, but that still counts as an escape in her book. Hestia's temple is small and cosy and smells like smoke and cookies. It always does. It feels like a hug to cross the threshold. Hestia's feeding the hearth fire. \"Aunt Hestia, Aunt Hestia.\" \"Now, now, girl. What's the matter with you?\" \"Oh, nothing. It's just - is it true, what Eileithyia says, that all women have babies?\" \"Well, yes, that sounds about right.\" \"But why?\" \"Really, Persephone - you're Demeter's daughter. You do know the mechanics, I'm sure.\" \"Yes, yes, stallions and mares and all that. But it's not like people go into heat or have mating seasons or anything like that, so I don't see why it should be so inevitable.\" Hestia frowns and wipes her hands on her apron before putting it away. Sits down across from Persephone at the table in her small kitchen, pushes the plate of fresh-from-the-oven-and-smelling-divine cookies at her. \"Well, not completely inevitable, I suppose. It's just, babies tend to happen after you marry. You'll see yourself soon enough.\" \"But - but why would I marry?\" she asks, because the idea that she'd ever tie herself to some man or god in that way - well, to be frank, it's never even occurred to her. \"Oh, that's what people do. I know for a fact that your parents have already been discussing who might make a suitable husband for you. I don't think they've settled on one, not yet, but I'm sure they'll pick some handsome fellow for you soon enough. Maybe Pan - now there's a strapping young fellow.\" \"But - but nobody's even asked me if I want to marry.\" \"Well, of course not. Girls tend to have all sorts of romantic notions about who they want to marry. Much better for her parents to get ahead of the curve and settle things before anything unfortunate happens.\" This conversation seems to be going in circles, Persephone decides. Time for a different approach. \"You're not married, Aunt Hestia.\" \"No. Back in the day, well, somebody had to keep the sacred fire burning. So we drew straws, to decide who had to make that sacrifice. And that ended up being me.\" \"Do you regret it?\" \"Sometimes - but that's alright. I get to see all of Olympus being happy and having families and that makes it worth it. Even though I do sometimes miss it.\" \"Miss what?\" \"Well, the sex, mostly. It would have been nice to have - but don't you mind an old goddess.\" Persephone thinks of cats, claws and teeth bared, thinks of satyrs running after nymphs, thinks of pained-sounding moans from behind garden shrubbery, and for the life of her she can't figure out why anybody would miss that. It seems such an awful lot of trouble. So she asks. \"Oh dear. You know, dear heart, I think perhaps this is a conversation you should be having with young Aphrodite.\" **** Her visit at Aphrodite's is certainly - well, enlightening. People can be amazingly creative. Like the stuff in the carefully packed basket her sister handed her as she left - smoothly carved wood and soft-as-silk skin-warm leather and tiny amphorae of glittering oil and an odd \"it's from the future - don't tell Zeus or he'll blow a gasket\" humming trinket. She spends a couple of days experimenting with her sister's gifts and they do feel very nice - especially the one from the future. Not quite nice enough for her to fully get why everybody seems to be so mad about this sex thing, but, still, they do feel very nice. Except... Except her sister had told her \"and when you do it, think of a man - if there's a particularly well-endowed satyr you like or one of your brother Ares' fine soldier boys or one of those sheepherders Dad keeps abducting - think of him, sliding his hands all over you, kneading your breasts, your buttocks, kissing you down there, sliding his tongue in and out and around and, oh, trust me, baby sis, it will make it even better.\" So, being a dutiful sort of girl, Persephone picks a man - one of those guards Ares always keeps standing outside his temple - and imagines him doing all those things. And then she stops, because instead of the pleasant tingle she's getting goose bumps. Still, Persephone isn't one to give up - she picks one of Poseidon's boys, covered in just a bit of seaweed, and tries again - imagines him kissing her breasts, her throat, her mouth, his hands... And then she stops. Again. Three more imaginary gentlemen lead to three more failed attempts before she decides that enough is enough. She washes her sister's playthings before putting them back in the basket and putting the basket into a cupboard, then curls up in her bed with a good scroll. *** The next day she goes to see her mother. \"Mum, I don't want to marry.\" \"Don't be silly, little Kore, there is absolutely nothing wrong with you.\" Persephone stops for half a second, blinks, then looks down at her mother industriously bent over the onion patch. \"No, mother, I said I don't want to marry.\" \"And I said don't be silly. You're perfect, my little girl, all the men are going to love you. Fine breasts and proper childbearing hips - you definitely get those from me - and a waist that some women would kill for.\" \"Mum, you're not listening to me.\" \"Oh, but actually, it's good that we're talking about this - I was beginning to wonder when you'd blossom properly. I mean, it's been years since you started bleeding, I was wondering when you'd take the next step. In fact - I know some parents can be so very old-fashioned, just telling the girl once all the arrangements are settled, but I've been thinking, it would be good for you to be a bit involved. Now, what do you think of Dionysus?\" *** \"She won't even listen to me!\" Artemis makes a sympathetic noise from where she's lying with her head in a nymph's lap. \"It's all Dionysus this and he's a fertility god that and you're just perfect for each other blah blah blah. It's creepy.\" A non-committal \"hmmm\" from where Athena's sitting with a scroll in her lap and a pen (\"it's from the future - don't tell Zeus\") in her hand is all that gets her. \"I don't get it. I don't get why it's so important to her that I marry. I mean, Hestia never married. Neither of you are married. It's not like I'd be the only maiden on Olympus.\" Artemis laughs - it's a bubbly sound, like a forest stream. \"Well, I wouldn't exactly call us maidens.\" \"But you're not married.\" \"Well, no - but dear, sweet baby sis, whatever gave you the idea that you need to marry to stop being a maid? Or that you need a man, for that matter?\" and she reaches up to stroke the side of the nymph's face, smiling. \"Oh.\" It's seems like these days there's no end to things that had never occurred to her. Persephone is actually beginning to get a bit annoyed at that. \"I'd like to marry.\" Heads turn to where Athena's sitting. \"So, why don't you? Everybody else seems to be in such a rush? Haven't found the right guy yet - or girl, I suppose?\" \"No,\" and Athena laughs, somewhat bitterly, and puts down her scroll. \"I've found the right guy. Trouble is, he's me.\" \"You?\" \"Yes, me. I'm a man.\" \"Uhm. I don't how to tell you this, but...\" \"Yes, yes, I know, these,\" and Athena curves her - his? - hands around his breasts. \"But that's just biology. Inside, I'm a man - but I'm not surprised you haven't heard about that sort of thing. Your mother was always pretty stuck on the gender binaries - comes from being a fertility goddess, I suppose. Almost as backwards as the mortals, sometimes.\" \"And you'd like to marry?\" \"Oh, yes - in fact, I know just the lady - a mortal, admittedly, but she's quite fantastic. An admiral, would you believe it. Trouble is, Father won't let me.\" \"Why not?\" \"Marriage is between a man and one or more women, that's what he says. And he keeps insisting that I'm a woman because my body's female.\" \"Mum turned into a mare, once. And Dad's been a bull and a swan and more things than I can count. Couldn't you just, you know - change?\" \"I could, I suppose - but why should I have to? Why should I have to change to fit his worldview? Fathers!\" \"And why should I have to marry to fit my Mum's?\" Persephone nods, decisively. \"I need a plan, I really do.\" \"Well, if a plan is what you need,\" Athena says, \"then I can probably help you. And if it has to be a sneaky plan, we'll just get Hermes involved.\" *** That night, by way of experiment, she digs out Aphrodite's basket and imagines the hands of the pretty, blue-eyed nymph who sometimes helps her mother with the roses on her. A little while later, she puts the basket back and concludes that no, that's still not her thing. *** \"You'll need to marry.\" \"Well, that's unhelpful. The whole point of this is to avoid marrying.\" \"Yes, yes, I got that bit, but think - what is it about marrying that you're objecting to? Is it sharing a house with someone? Or what?\" \"It's the sex. And the babies. But mostly the sex, I suppose.\" \"Exactly. So we just pick the right guy for you to marry, and by right guy, I mean someone you don't have to worry about that part with.\" \"And do you have someone in mind for that part?\" \"Oh, yes: Apollo. Now, I know, there's been the occasional girl, but really, they were of the more boyish type, not like you at all. So, you just marry him and he won't spare you a second glance, I promise. It's perfect.\" Hermes grins and leans back, arms spread wide as if to show off his brilliance. \"There's just one problem with that scheme, baby brother,\" Athena comments. \"In order for Apollo to marry her in the first place, there'll have to be a first glance - and last I heard, our dear brother was head over heels for some Spartan youth.\" Hermes doesn't stop grinning, just leans forward, conspiratorially. \"True, but I know exactly how to make him very, very interested in marrying our dear Persephone.\" \"And how is that, if one might enquire?\" \"Why, simplest thing in the world. I ask to marry her.\" \"And this would help how?\" Athena is surprisingly good at the fine art of the expressively arched eyebrow. \"Why, don't you know, Apollo never did forgive me for that cattle business. And that lyre business. So if we do this just right, he'll take me wanting to marry her as a challenge - and he never could resist a challenge.\" \"That's true,\" comments Artemis. \"Even had to be the first to climb out of the womb, that one.\" \"And then,\" and Persephone finds herself starting to match Hermes' grin, because this scheming business is turning out to be quite fun, \"and then, all we have to do is let him.\" *** The scheme is a resounding success - well, mostly. Right up until the end. Which comes in the form of her mother shouting at her father at the top of her lungs: \"I will not have my daughter marry either of those two sorry excuses for a god. My daughter is going to be a fertility goddess. She's going to need a proper man to see to her needs.\" And that's that. *** \"At least it shows that she cares about your future happiness.\" \"Which would be a lot more helpful if she'd just stop and listen to what I have to say about it.\" \"Well, nobody's perfect,\" and Athena shrugs. \"Guess it's back to the drawing board, then.\" \"I guess,\" but the sun is warm and Persephone can't gather much enthusiasm for anything other than settling back against a nice, sun-warmed rock and frankly, none of her three siblings seem to be in much of a mood for doing anything beyond lazing about either. The nearby brook is babbling, the bees are humming lazy honey-songs to the meadow flowers, and from far below her the earth rumbles like the purring of an enormous, contented cat. Persephone wakes, not sure how long she's been sleeping, and it takes her a moment to figure out what woke her. At the other end of the meadow a couple of nymphs and a satyr are whispering, giggling just loud enough to carry. \"Artemis.\" When her sister doesn't answer, she turns and pokes her. \"Artemis, wake up.\" \"What?\" comes the petulant voice of her sister. \"What are those nymphs up to?\" \"Which nymphs?\" and Artemis rolls over and rests her chin on her arms. \"Oh, those. They're just waiting to try and catch a ride in Hades' chariot.\" \"Is that a euphemism?\" Persephone asks, suspiciously, because she's beginning to notice that Artemis uses a lot of those. \"What? No, Hades no good for that. No, they're literally waiting to try to leap aboard the chariot when he passes. It's quite a rush, really, going all helter-skelter across the sky with him while he goes ghost hunting. He's got the fastest horses anywhere - even Helios' aren't half as fast.\" \"How do they know he's coming?\" \"Oh, you can hear it in the earth. It's starts rumbling a couple of hours before he gets to the surface. Judging by that rumble, I'd say he's almost here. Watch.\" Persephone watches as the rumbling grows loud and insistent and the earth starts to shake - and suddenly the meadow splits open, gaping like an open wound, and up comes a chariot - black as night - drawn by four huge, black horses with blazing red eyes and their reins in the hands of a tall, impossibly tall, impossibly pale man that looks vaguely familiar. She watches as the nymphs and the satyr run forward towards the chariot, and two of them falter, but one runs on, timing her leap almost right - but almost is good enough, because Hades reaches down a gauntleted hand and drags the skinny nymph the rest of the way aboard the chariot just as the huge, black horses drags it up out of the hole and into the air. \"Doesn't he mind?\" Persephone asks, while watching the nymph clinging to the edge of the chariot and letting out a whoop. \"No, not really. Honestly, I think Uncle Hades' gets a bit lonely downstairs. We never do seem to get around to visiting him - though who can blame us. It's so gloomy down there.\" \"Hmmm.\" Later, while they're walking home, she asks Athena: \"Artemis said something funny - about Hades. She said he was 'no good for that'. What's that supposed to mean?\" \"Well, he's dead. A bit of a prerequisite for being the god of the dead. It's not like he's a rotting corpse or anything, but sex and procreation and all that, those are the concerns of the living - and he's not living.\" \"But isn't that more that he can't?\" \"Not exactly. Can't just makes people creative - you wouldn't believe some of the things I've seen mortals come up with over the years. It's not that he couldn't figure out a way if he wanted to, it's just - he's dead. So he doesn't? See?\" And oh yes, Persephone sees. \"And nobody thought to mention this why?\" *** They borrow Ares' chariot to practice with - which basically means that they let Athena go and tell Ares, in no uncertain terms, that he'll be borrowing his chariot and that's that. Meanwhile, Artemis helps her practice - makes her jump and run in circles until she wants to scream from the cramps in her legs, while her sister just stands there with a peculiar gadget that can apparently tell her that Persephone's been slacking, she was faster on her last three runs than on this one (\"It's from the future - don't tell Zeus\") \"And how are you helping?\" Persephone asks Hermes as she stretches her aching muscles. \"I'm providing moral support!\" her brother smiles and pumps a fist into the air. \"Go Persephone!\" Then he closes his eyes and opens his mouth to let one of the giggling nymphs feed him a grape. \"Looks more like amoral support to me,\" Athena remarks as he passes, leading Ares' big horses over to the chariot to get ready for the next step in practice. Hermes sticks his tongue out at him, then pulls it back in along with the grape the boldest of the nymphs put on it. *** \"Now, remember. Just like we practiced,\" and Artemis is shouting to be heard over the rumbling of the earth announcing Hades' imminent arrival, but she doesn't have to, because Persephone's got this and she's got the bruises to prove it. And when the earth splits open she takes off and times her leap exactly right. Hades looks down at her in something like surprise before offering her a hand up. \"Most people don't manage to actually land in the chariot,\" he comments, then turns his focus back on his horses. Persephone looks out. Beneath them, the earth is falling away, Artemis, Athena and Hermes waving at her like mice, like ants, far, far beneath. The wind is rushing through her hair, tearing out every hairpin and dragging it out behind her like a banner, and all she can do is cling to the edge of the chariot and howl like a mad thing, as the world whirls past, faster and faster and faster. Then they are plummeting, down and down, the earth rushing towards them and Hades is picking up something that looks a bit like a shepherd's crook and a bit like a butterfly net, holding it at the ready in one hand and the reins tightly in the other. Down, he takes them, down towards a field of broken weapons, the wind howling in her ears and her heart very nearly leaps out of her throat as he turns the chariot, sharply, and they're rising, up and up and in his net are white smoke-like things, squirming and hissing like cornered cats. Eventually, Hades reins in his horses, bringing them to a smooth halt at the edge of a river. \"This is where you get off,\" he says. \"No. No, I don't\", and she squares her shoulders, because this was the bit she couldn't practice, not really, but she's not getting off. Not now, not when she's so close. Except Hades just looks at her for a moment, then shrugs and snaps the reins to get the horses moving again, faster and faster, and ahead of them, the earth yawns like a black abyss. *** The underworld is not cold. The underworld is not dark. These things surprise her. Around her light shimmers in crystals set in rocky walls, rainbows dancing across slowly flowing rivulets of water. The only noise is the sound of the hooves against rock and the great wheels of the chariot rolling and rolling, a rumbling thunder that never reaches a breaking point. Then they come to the end of the tunnel. The underworld is not quiet. This, too, surprises her. As Hades draws his chariot to a halt in front of his palace, shades gather around him, hands out-stretched, whispering petitions. He leaps from the chariot and runs up the great stairs as if fleeing from the shades, barely remembering to empty out his nets before slamming the doors behind him. Persephone follows slowly, for a moment worried that he might have locked the doors, that he might have been running from her, but they're not. In fact, he's waiting for her just inside. \"I'm sorry. That was - inhospitable of me. It's just - if I'd let them catch me, it would have been hours before I was done with even the first twenty petitioners. And it's not often I have guests\" The hall is lit by torches. In their flickering light, her uncle looks - surprisingly young. Nervous. But when she smiles at him, he smiles back. Dinner is delicious - wine and roast and pomegranates for dessert - and the room he leads her to is sumptuous and the bed is soft and huge. The next day, she watches as Hades receives petitioners, letting his guards - tall, fierce things with horns and many arms - open the doors, then immediately start pushing them closed again, groaning against the stream of shades attempting to push their way inside. When they finally manage to close and bar the doors, the audience chamber is brimming. She watches and listens, that day, as Hades beckons the shades forward, one at a time, and listens to them, sometimes leaning in to catch the fainter whispers, sometimes sitting unmoving against howling, yowling screams. She sees him pat hands and offer assurances, sees him settle disputes, sees him shout in furious anger. Watches as the guards ushers shades out by way of twenty different side entrances, nervously poking their heads out first to make sure nobody's outside waiting to try to get in. Somewhere far, far above, the sun sets. And the sun rises. And the sun sets once more. She watches as Hades grows paler, watches as he rubs his forehead between petitioners, watches him drain cup after cup of wine. Eventually, the room is empty. And honestly, as best she can tell, so is Hades. The next day he is her polite host once more, showing her the sights of his lands - gruesome and glorious, blood and fruit and venomous snakes. \"Tomorrow, I have to go hunting again. I'll take you home, then.\" \"No. No, you won't.\" \"Persephone, dear, it's not that I don't appreciate your company, because I do, but - this is no place for a young girl.\" \"And yet, I'm staying.\" \"As you wish.\" The next day, he goes hunting. Before the thunderous noise of the chariot has even faded, she gathers the guards around her. \"This is what we're going to do.\" When evening comes and Hades along with it, he finds the square in front of his palace empty. He blinks and looks around, puzzled, while she's walking down the stairs to greet him. \"Where did everybody go? Did something sneak in and eat my shades again?\" \"What? No, nothing bad. I just had the guards hand out appointment cards.\" \"Appointment cards?\" \"Yes. Colour coded per day, 50 of each colour. That way, the shades can show up on the day of their card and know that they'll be let in and be heard - and they don't have to spend all their time out here. It's much more efficient, don't you think?\" \"Well, yes. Though, I'm not here every day.\" \"I could be. You just need to teach me how.\" As they walk up to the doors, he keeps looking around, as if he can't quite believe his own eyes. *** \"So this is where you've been hiding yourself.\" Hecate's standing in the door, arms crossed and looking distinctly unimpressed. Admittedly, the latter has always seemed a pretty permanent feature of hers. \"I'm not hiding, I'm working,\" Persephone snaps from where she sits next to Hades, listening to a woman - who once upon a time was a courtesan, which is apparently relevant to the tale she's telling. \"And while you've been gallivanting about down here, your mother's been going frantic back home.\" \"I'm not gallivanting, I'm working.\" \"No, you're not. Time to go home, young missy,\" and Hecate is pushing at the shades that are blocking her way and hissing like snakes. \"I can't go home, I'm abducted,\" which makes Hecate stop pushing. Instead she raises an eyebrow - she's even better at that than Athena. \"Abducted, is it?\" \"Yes, abducted,\" and she looks at Hades, silently begging him not to gainsay her. \"Oh, yes. Certainly. Absolutely. I abducted her fair and square. You can't have her, she's mine now,\" and she could hug him, she really could, except that would probably be pushing it just a bit. \"Well, we'll just see about that,\" is Hecate's parting shot. *** They start arriving not long after. Thin. Gaunt. Starveling faces whispering songs of famine. A once-mother cries as she's reunited with the baby that died, the baby whose flesh she ate. Hades pats her shoulder, awkwardly. \"Sometimes, it's like this. When there's famine or plague or war. It'll pass, I promise. It always does in the end.\" Except it doesn't. The trickle keeps flowing, more and more shades arriving every day, and even Hades frowns. And then Hermes shows up. \"Persephone, you need to come home. Your mother's gone insane! She's killing everybody!\" \"What do you mean, she's killing everybody?\" \"Hecate told her that Hades had abducted you and were keeping you locked up in the underworld. So she went to Zeus, to get him to fetch you back, except he wouldn't and nobody can figure out why not, but -\" \"I - might have visited my brother and mentioned in passing how helpful you've been around the place.\" \"So that's why. Anyway, that's when Demeter got really mad and said that if you were going to be trapped in the gloomy, damp, dark, hellish underworld, then the rest of the world was going to join you. And then she just - stopped.\" \"Stopped what?\" \"Fertility! She stopped doing it. Completely.\" \"What do you mean, she stopped fertility? She is fertility, she can't just - not.\" \"But she did. So now there's no plants growing, anywhere, no fruit, no grain, not even fresh grass. And the animals aren't reproducing either, so no new animals and no milk. All the mortals are living off what they had in storage, and that's not enough.\" \"Do you mean to say, all the poor shades we've been getting lately - they died because of me?\" and she can feel something horrible inside of her, some horrible feeling of doom. She had been happy down her, organizing things, and now everything was turning out wrong and it was all her fault. \"Yes. Well, no, absolutely not, but you need to come home, before all the mortals die.\" \"But. But I don't want to,\" and she knows she's selfish, she does, and she feels horrible, she really does, but she can't just go, can she? Except they're dying, all these people, and it's all her fault. \"I'm sorry, Persephone. I know you don't, but you must.\" \"Perhaps,\" and Hades sounds like he's thinking as he speaks, \"perhaps there is a way to persuade Demeter to allow Persephone to stay?\" \"Last time I saw her, she was berating Zeus for not saving her from that \"disgusting old zombie\".\" \"Zombie?\" \"It's a future thing - don't tell Zeus.\" \"Demeter told Zeus,\" she points out. \"But whatever that is, Hades isn't one, and anyway, I want to stay. I'm a grown woman and I want to stay.\" \"I heard a story once,\" Hades comments, \"well, more than once. From the shades. They say that the living might visit the land of the dead and return to the land of the living afterwards, but only if they - for as long as they remain in the underworld - accept no food and no drink. If they do, if they eat or drink even a mere mouthful while down here, they can never return.\" \"And is the story true?\" she asks, thinking of every cup of wine and every apple and every piece of sweetmeat she's consumed - she's actually been gaining a bit of weight as of late. \"No, it's nonsense. But I doubt Demeter knows that.\" \"Right. Hermes, you go back up and tell people that I ate stuff and can't go home. Then Mum can stop - that is, start again, because it won't do any good to keep this up.\" He looks doubtful, but he goes. *** Her Dad is standing in Hades' audience chamber and the shades are scattering, running out the door, and part of her is thinking \"Dammit, now we're going to have to reschedule that whole bunch\". The other part is far too busy running forward and hugging him to have time for that sort of concern. After all, he is her Dad. \"Hello, little Kore,\" and he picks her up and swings her around, the way she always loved when she was still a little girl. Then he puts her down and let's her lead him to the dining room. \"Now, this is a fine mess you've made,\" he comments while chewing on some green peas. \"I know, Dad. I didn't mean to, I just - didn't want to end up having to marry Dionysus. Or anybody. I just...\" \"Hmmm. And now this story about having to stay down here because of something you ate,\" and he's raising an eyebrow at her over a leg of chicken - really, is everybody in her family an expert at that except her? She blushes and looks down. \"Anyway, I've had a talk with your mother. Well, several talks, actually. And she finally agreed that you can stay down here - on two conditions. First, you're going home to visit your mother - for a few months every year. And second, you two will have to marry.\" \"I'm sorry,\" she tells Hades. \"I'll go back.\" \"Why? I thought you liked it down here?\" \"I do. But you shouldn't be forced to marry me.\" \"If it means I can keep you around to keep the shades in line and remind me to have fresh fruit put out for Tantalus and - well. I wouldn't mind.\" \"Good, then it's settled. And just as well - Demeter has been going on and on about the pair of you living in sin.\" \"Sin?\" \"It's a future thing. Your mother really needs to start reading better books - or at least ones not about other religions.\" \"Everybody's always saying not to tell you about future things.\" \"I know,\" her Dad grins. \"Isn't it fun?\" *** Her wedding day dawns bright and sunny. Birds are singing and nymphs are circling, arranging her hair and weaving myrtles into it. Her mother waits for her outside. \"Look at you, my little Kore. You look so healthy - a bit pale, but we'll soon take care of that,\" and she hugs her and Persephone hugs back, surprised at how much she finds she's missed Demeter. Even when her mother whispers into her ear: \"If that lout does anything to hurt you, you tell me right away. I don't care what Zeus says, I'll go get you myself if I have to.\" All of Olympus is gathered - well, almost all. Dionysus has sent a card with his apologies, as he's on his own honeymoon - \"You missed my wedding, so it's only fair that I miss yours, don't you think?\" But apart from that, everybody's there. And after Zeus has dealt with the official business there's food and wine and relatives not-quite-lining-up to get their turn at offering congratulations (or, for those not in the know, barely veiled condolences) and presents. Athena smiles at her as he offers a wrapped parcel. Inside is a book - not a scroll, but an actual codex book. 'Understanding Asexuality', it says on the cover. \"I stumbled across it and thought you'd find it interesting. It's from the future, though, so don't tell Zeus.\" \"I won't,\" she promises her brother. She doesn't quite have the heart to tell him that Zeus is standing right behind him. Zeus grins as he steps forward and picks her up to kiss her on the cheek. \"You know, it's wrong of you not to let Athena marry.\" \"That Artemisia of his? Honestly, I'm just waiting for the boy to show some spirit and elope with her like a proper son of mine. It's getting embarrassing, really. Usually he's so clever, you'd think he'd be able to figure out what a Las Vegas marriage chapel is for.\" \"What's Las Vegas?\" \"It's a future thing - don't tell me,\" and her Dad winks.",

    "text": "Apollo watched his sister and her hunters, could see the way that Orion watched her. Far worse, he could see the way she watched Orion. Where his sister was usually cold and calculating, when she watched Orion, a warmth flushed her face, one that Apollo himself knew quite intimately. He wished to quell that look, or perhaps to claim it for his own. Apollo the bright sun, gleaming gold to his sister's silver, archer second only to her. They had grown up together, chasing each other across the Earth's surface. They loved each other, in the way that siblings do, and Apollo loved his sister better than any. Perhaps he loved her too much. He saw how she favored Orion, how night after night the two of them chased the deer through the woods, never tiring, never lagging, laughter bubbling between them as they reveled in the race. He saw, and he burned with jealousy. And so he devised a plot. It was frightful in its simplicity. One evening, just before dusk, he stopped Orion and bid him give chase after a beast far to the west. \"My sister said she will follow soon after,\" he said, brilliant smile guileless even as the evening waned. Not one to gainsay his gods, Orion acquiesced and sprinted west without pause. Artemis came to Apollo not long after. \"My hunter, have you seen him?\" He shook his head. \"Nay, sister mine. But there is a beast far to the west. Do you see it?\" He indicated the distant running figure of Orion. \"It moves with great speed,\" she observed. \"Aye. I tried to catch it for sport, but I fell just short.\" He smiled, and if there was a shadow to it, well, that was just the shade of twilight. \"Perhaps you would like to take your chance at it?\" Artemis smirked as she raised her bow. \"In a single shot, dear brother.\" She selected an arrow from her quiver and drew her bow. She let the arrow fly, and she never missed her mark. In the far distance, the beast fell. \"Shall we?\" she asked, turning back to Apollo. \"After you.\" It took them little time to reach the creature, and when they arrived in the glade where it fell, Artemis frowned. \"It was a man,\" she said, coming to stand over it. She turned him with her foot, rolling him onto his back. When she saw his face, she opened her mouth in a soundless wail. She fell to her knees and pressed her hand to Orion's face, checking for even the faintest breath of life. It was hopeless; she was too good, and she knew it. \"What have you done?\" she asked her brother. \"How could you do this to me?\" \"I--\" He faltered at the look of mixed horror and anger on Artemis' face. \"You have taken vows of chastity,\" he said at last. \"I only sought to help you keep them.\" She stared at him as if she could read the lie on his face. She took a deep breath and Apollo watched as the anger gave way to cold determination, her face impassive as a statue. \"My actions should be no concern of yours,\" she said as she stood. \"You would do well to remember that.\" She stalked away, her back straight as she left the glade. * Artemis went to Hades. \"What brings you here?\" \"I have come to beg a boon, Uncle.\" \"A boon? Of what sort?\" he asked, though by her drawn face he could hazard a guess. Artemis looked away. \"There is a shade here I wish to return to life.\" \"You know that I cannot grant you that, my dear niece,\" Hades rumbled. \"I know that you have granted it to mortals before,\" she returned. \"You also know very well that a mortal asking a boon of such nature is quite different from one of us asking the same.\" She glanced away. \"May I see him then? Grant me that, at least.\" Something in Hades' gaze softened. \"What was his name?\" \"Orion.\" Hades closed his eyes. \"Ah, yes. He is in the Elysian Fields. You may go to him. You may even speak to him, if you so wish.\" He indicated for one of his servants to escort Artemis to the fields. She followed the manservant, trying not to stare at the shades they passed. She had never been to the halls of Hades before; she had never had a reason to see the land of the Dead until now. It felt like Earth on a dark night, when the stars were far distant and the shadows oppressive. A grey light hung over all of it, and she briefly wondered what her brother would say of it. He would probably hate the place even more than she did. She hoped he found himself visiting soon. At last, they reached the Fields, and there was Orion, bow in hand as he stalked through the grey world, alike and yet so unlike himself. \"Orion!\" she cried, and the many shades turned as one toward her voice. Orion himself gazed steadily at her, eyes betraying no emotion, no recognition. She stepped closer to him. \"Can he speak?\" she asked the servant. \"Only if he is given a taste of life.\" She took her favorite hunting knife and sliced her thumb, offering it to Orion. He clasped her hand and pressed grey lips to her finger. Color bloomed across his face, muted, but brighter than anything else in this place. \"My lady,\" he gasped. Artemis allowed herself a smile. \"My love,\" she answered. \"How did I come to be here?\" he asked. \"You do not remember?\" Orion frowned. \"I was hunting. There was a bright pain. And then, nothing.\" Artemis looked away. \"I will not lie to you; you were killed by my hand.\" \"It was my time, then?\" Artemis shook her head vehemently. \"Apollo tricked me. You -- I did not know it was you.\" She lifted her eyes to meet his. \"I hoped to bring you back, but I cannot,\" she confessed. \"I'm sorry.\" Orion dropped his bow and took her hands in his. She tried not to shiver at their coldness. \"My lady, you know the Fates have already decided our ends.\" \"But you were mine to protect and to love.\" He smiled. \"And so I was.\" \"I'll come to you every day.\" Orion shook his head. \"My lady, you know you can't do that.\" Artemis closed her eyes against her grief. \"But what shall I do, without you by my side?\" \"What you have always done -- hunt the wild deer.\" He let her hands go and brushed a palm against her face. She leaned into the touch, wishing the chill would numb her heart as well as her cheek. On impulse, she leaned forward and pressed her lips against his, allowing her hot tears to fall against his rapidly cooling face. \"You'll forget me as soon as I leave,\" she said softly. He sighed against her mouth. \"So I will, but you will remember me. And that will be enough.\" Artemis kissed him again, until his lips had faded back to the same gray of the rest of the Land of the Dead. His face once again had the steady blankness of death. \"Goodbye, my love,\" she whispered as she stepped away.",

      "She glanced away.",
      "\"May I see him then?",
      "Grant me that, at least.\"",
      "Something in Hades' gaze softened.",
      "\"What was his name?\" \"Orion.\"",
      "Hades closed his eyes.",
      "\"Ah, yes.",
      "He is in the Elysian Fields.",
      "You may go to him.",
      "You may even speak to him, if you so wish.\"",
      "He indicated for one of his servants to escort Artemis to the fields.",
      "She followed the manservant, trying not to stare at the shades they passed.",
      "She had never been to the halls of Hades before; she had never had a reason to see the land of the Dead until now.",
      "It felt like Earth on a dark night, when the stars were far distant and the shadows oppressive.",
      "A grey light hung over all of it, and she briefly wondered what her brother would say of it.",
      "He would probably hate the place even more than she did.",
      "She hoped he found himself visiting soon.",
      "At last, they reached the Fields, and there was Orion, bow in hand as he stalked through the grey world, alike and yet so unlike himself.",
      "\"Orion!\"",
      "she cried, and the many shades turned as one toward her voice.",
      "Orion himself gazed steadily at her, eyes betraying no emotion, no recognition.",
      "She stepped closer to him.",
      "\"Can he speak?\" she asked the servant.",
      "\"Only if he is given a taste of life.\"",
      "She took her favorite hunting knife and sliced her thumb, offering it to Orion.",
      "He clasped her hand and pressed grey lips to her finger.",
      "Color bloomed across his face, muted, but brighter than anything else in this place.",
      "\"My lady,\" he gasped.",
      "Artemis allowed herself a smile.",
      "\"My love,\" she answered.",
      "\"How did I come to be here?\" he asked.",
      "\"You do not remember?\" Orion frowned.",
      "\"I was hunting.",
      "There was a bright pain.",
      "And then, nothing.\"",
      "Artemis looked away.",
      "\"I will not lie to you; you were killed by my hand.\"",
      "\"It was my time, then?\"",
      "Artemis shook her head vehemently.",
      "\"Apollo tricked me.",
      "You -- I did not know it was you.\"",
      "She lifted her eyes to meet his.",
      "\"I hoped to bring you back, but I cannot,\" she confessed.",
      "\"I'm sorry.\"",
      "Orion dropped his bow and took her hands in his.",
      "She tried not to shiver at their coldness.",
      "\"My lady, you know the Fates have already decided our ends.\"",
      "\"But you were mine to protect and to love.\"",
      "He smiled.",
      "\"And so I was.\"",
      "\"I'll come to you every day.\"",
      "Orion shook his head.",
      "\"My lady, you know you can't do that.\"",
      "Artemis closed her eyes against her grief.",
      "\"But what shall I do, without you by my side?\"",
      "\"What you have always done -- hunt the wild deer.\"",
      "He let her hands go and brushed a palm against her face.",
      "She leaned into the touch, wishing the chill would numb her heart as well as her cheek.",
      "On impulse, she leaned forward and pressed her lips against his, allowing her hot tears to fall against his rapidly cooling face.",
      "\"You'll forget me as soon as I leave,\" she said softly.",
      "He sighed against her mouth.",
      "\"So I will, but you will remember me.",
      "And that will be enough.\"",
      "Artemis kissed him again, until his lips had faded back to the same gray of the rest of the Land of the Dead.",
      "His face once again had the steady blankness of death.",
      "\"Goodbye, my love,\" she whispered as she stepped away."

    "text": "We are the Mechanisms, a band of immortal space pirates roaming through the universe on the starship Aurora. The crew consists of Gunpowder Tim, the master-at-arms; Ashes O'Reilly, the quartermaster; Drumbot Brian, the pilot; Baron Marius von Raum, ship's doctor; Raphaella la Cognizi, science officer; Ivy Alexandria, archivist and navigator; Nastya Rasputina, ship's engineer;... the Toy Soldier; and myself, Jonny d'Ville, your Captain. [First Mate! -- Ivy] Today we'll be weaving you a tale of warfare and weaponry -- well, actually, it's mostly about computer security, but that doesn't alliterate as well, now, does it? In any case, it features grenades. What, you didn't know that explosives were named for pomegranates? Well, now you do. Shall we begin...? Even immortality is relative. None of these kids, old as sin as they are, can remember a time without Hades. Their parents, older still, have already begun to forget: because even if you've worked out how to halt cell senescence, persuading the brain to store more data is a completely different matter - and a problem the Olympians hadn't cracked. Of course, we weren't inclined to share, but I'm getting ahead of myself. See, Nastya doesn't much care where we go, as long as she can stay with the ship. Ashes, though - Ashes has opinions. And that's how this guy, name of Prometheus, ends up hitching a lift: getting stranded in between stars happens more often than you might think, and every now and again we pick up a stray in the hopes of picking up a story to go with them, and -- well. By the time we came across him he'd been on the run long enough it had started to show. Didn't even bother with a cover story -- he was tired enough and desperate enough to tell us straight-out he'd got the tech to grant eternal life, and he'd give us a cut if we'd give him a ride. Anyone else -- they'd have shoved the body out the airlock on the bet that they could find someone willing to buy even if they did have to do the legwork themselves. But us... well, Prometheus got lucky, didn't he. It wasn't until later we found out who the ideological bastard had stolen it from, and where he was after getting it to. Some backwater planet his own family owned -- high-minded nonsense about overthrowing the oppressor. Nice thematic fit, really, with one of the idealists we'll introduce you to later on in this particular tale. You know us: we were only in it for the happy-ever-after. So he hands the coordinates over to Ashes, and then we don't see him again til we're pulling into orbit -- probably the most sensible thing he ever did. When it comes to deciding who was going to do what - well, Nastya stays with the ship, like I said, but if you'd been paying attention then you'd know that, wouldn't you. Me, I'm a people person; the Toy Soldier does its... thing -- and Ashes? Well, if there's one thing Ashes hates, it's leaving jobs half-finished -- so they declared they were going downside with Prometheus to see things through, though first they had to scrape him back out of the hold. Doesn't take long before the entire planet's under attack, of course. We might have helped things along -- what's a breadcrumb trail and a little agitation between friends, I ask you? -- but it was pretty much inevitable: Prometheus' family work out what's happened, and are they pissed. Next thing we know someone suspiciously familiar is heading up Labyrinth's computing infrastructure and not returning calls. I'd tell you we were hurt, but I suspect you know us a touch better than that already. Anyway, turns out that the way Ashes swung this gig is that Daedalus got a little distracted. If you've got a side business in the arms trade, a war on the horizon, and some new tech to play with... well, you might just be grateful enough to the person who delivered the goods to let them have some fun. Especially if the land-grab they're making maps neatly onto territory you'd rather be clean of - because it's all very well to design complicated infrastructure, but there's some logistical nightmares so tangled that even the most power-hungry don't dare touch, and that can make them very difficult indeed to escape. Oh, and Prometheus? Well, we never quite worked out why, but he'd got the impression that the new lot were better than the old. Course, by the time the Olympians had set up shop (with the Titans out of the way, it didn't take long for the city Prometheus'd landed in to decide they wanted the rest of the planet) he'd been thoroughly disabused of the notion; rumour is he's the only embodied brain hooked up to the Acheron, spreadeagled and screaming, eyes staring into somewhere no-one else can see. I hear tell that a team of the finiest doctors in the City visits daily, to poke and to prod and to probe at the limits, and to bring the composition of his cerebral and spinal fluids in line with the calculated optimum for the computer's purposes. It's a lot of trouble to go to, just to make sure no-one else thinks of trying his game, but hey, it kept the medics off the street. We're pretty sure Ashes was also behind Thanatos, the clean-up branch of the operation. Changed the name eventually, of course, to the Metropolitan Power Company -- you got to move with the times -- but that's how the ferrymen started. Every one of the sorry low-paid sods was mortal, and every one of them was hated by everyone who couldn't afford to ignore them. Their reputation wasn't helped by the persistent rumblings that in slow weeks they weren't above administering a hypnogogue and claiming death in order to make quota. It probably won't surprise you to learn they're the group of workers with the highest volunteer rate for early entry to the Acheron, and the demographic with the highest rate of attempted suicide. You'd think they'd know better, but as it turns out, people are people everywhere, and mostly they're just not very bright. Around now I think it's time we introduced you to another player in this game. Lady by the name of Demeter: before the war, she ran the biggest agrifertiliser business on the planet, so when immortality of a kind came on the market, she could afford it -- and oh, but did she jump at the chance. The growth of the City -- and of the Acheron -- didn't bother her a bit: automated plants in the distant dark still need raw material, and the culture medium for the Acheron has to come from somewhere. One deal with Hades later she was sitting pretty, with a steady stream of Thanatos' leftovers into her warehouses for dispatch to processing. Actually, let's give you a little more detail on how the Acheron works. If you've been keeping up, you'll recall that there's no processor more powerful than the human brain; and that keeping this wretched whittled-out planet running takes an awful lot of energy. You might also remember that people will do a very great deal to stay out of the Acheron, and that those as get rebrained by people desperate enough and rich enough come back wrong. There's reasons for that, and they include this: Ashes likes efficiency, and individual storage is anything but. No, optimisation favours the vats: no pissing about with piddling jars, just hook up some wires, slosh in the culture, add nutrients a couple of times a week, and add brains til full. Neurons that fire together wire together: grow-your-own glistening, gelatinous supercomputer. Things didn't start out that way, or so Ashes tells us: no matter how good you are, there's going to be bugs you can't quite squash in your first few rounds of prototyping. When Hades inherited the Acheron, everything was individual jars and temperature sensors, even for the scraps scraped up after accidents. Making the switch to batch processing... well, there's infrastructure and start-up costs, and it never quite seemed worth the hassle until Proserpine started causing trouble. But after that -- oh, after that it was vats for everyone, apart from a few exceptionally talented volunteers, and believe you me when I tell you the qualifying tests were brutal. Now Proserpine was Demeter's daughter, one and only, and of Zeus, from before he developed his taste for fucking with the lower classes. Even then, of course, he didn't stick around, so Proserpine was brought up entirely by her mother, trained for the family business, and oh did she hate it: her dull grey mother and the dull grey corpses, and most of all the fertiliser. Demeter, you see, was much like the rest of the Olympians: trusted none of 'em further than she could throw them, and certainly wasn't willing to have anyone she wasn't tied to by blood as her second-in-command. What Proserpine was really after was unfettered access to the Acheron's computing power... so she resented her mother's simpering about trust and keeping it in the family and but you're the only one, darling all the more for that her credentials only bought her limited time, limited power, because the Olympians... well, a resource like the Acheron, the only people who got to make full use of it were those as Daedalus owed favours to, from back in the day. Ah, but access to the Acheron... we know that down here you still rely on entering sigils by hand. Nothing that primitive for Daedalus: in a network made up of brains, the key -- the identifier -- is a secret thought. Of course, this doesn't work so well if -- like Demeter -- you're both uncreative and predictable, so it didn't take long before a bored and belligerent Proserpine was running around bits of the Acheron she shouldn't ever have been able to, and she even got away with it for a while. We found out about all this when Nastya got around to passing on a message from the Toy Soldier. Seems these... nymphs were all chattering away with each other, all the time -- system they called Fama. But to find out Hades was spending a lot of time with the offspring of an Olympian... well, it was just a touch unexpected. Destruction and mayhem we're used to, and even alliances of a sort, but rumours of marriage? Turns out it things were a little bit more complicated than that. Proserpine was young - at least by Olympian standards - brilliant, and very, very bored. Once she'd guessed her mother's passphrase, it didn't take long to hit the limits of what even Olympians were permitted to do - so she started to get creative. Working out how to bypass first-line security, the waking volunteer brains, didn't stretch her much: disguise your activity patterns right and you could walk right in unnoticed. But after that... well, that's when she came to Hecate's attention. Now Demeter did not get on with Hecate, and it all boiled down to petty jealousy: Hecate headed up the division responsible for rebodyings, which meant she got the highest bidders and thus the pick of the cadavers, and if your mother spends long enough complaining about someone talented and dedicated and downright glamorous, can you really blame Proserpine for having her interest piqued? Ashes will tell you to this day that they never could quite work out whether Proserpine tripped the second-line security, the seeds, deliberately. See, a girl could get bored, just dealing with bodies, so Hecate'd also staked a major claim in the security sector. With her skillset and Ashes running the joint she'd ended up developing a warning system of her very own: anything that got past the perimeter of waking brains then had to avoid her home-brew pseudo-brains, which sent up very noticeable, very bloody explosions when triggered. Set off one, you'll probably get away with it: they're not very stable. Set off two near anything sensitive, you bring down the wrath of the gods. But setting off four, in a very obvious pattern? That gets attention. Demeter is off at a function far too important to risk taking Proserpine to when the Carians showed up on the doorstep. It's Hecate who emerges from their midst, smiling wolfishly, and taking Proserpine's arm took her entire into the carriage waiting in the passageway: big, black, drawn by mechanical horses, and powered by a sense of the dramatic. Hades was waiting inside, of course. All they'll tell us about that conversation is that it lasted hours and ended with the decision that summary execution would be too messy; instead they agreed to exchange passage off-planet for getting Proserpine out of their way. It took cashing in a favour with Zeus, but - so Ashes says - Hecate was very persuasive about the advantages to be gained in any subsequent political manoeuvering. Fact is, it took Demeter a little while to notice anything amiss: she'd never been the most attentive of parents. But when she did, oh, the City knew: Olympians might be back-stabbing traitors, the lot of them, but that doesn't mean they enjoy it when it's done to them; and when it's your main competitor, your ex, and someone of decidedly dubious pedigree... The long and the short of it is that Demeter stopped providing culture medium. Fine, shrugged Hades, and started the efficiency drive: between that and stockpiles, the place kept ticking over nicely for quite a while, give or take a little public outcry about brains growing together and dreaming together, no matter how whole or damaged they started. But while public outcry tends to die down after a decade or so, one can only, after all, economise so far, and wetware doesn't take kindly to being taken offline and put in no-maintenance storage. Eventually, Ashes tells us, Hecate volunteered to be the person to fetch the brat back, and there was no-one else interested - or at least, no-one powerful enough to take precedence. No need to examine motives too closely - most people wanted off-planet at least occasionally, and anyway it was a move guaranteed to get Demeter's back up - but the rest of the Olympians had their hands full subduing the populace during the famine the denizens were not unfairly blaming them for. The horse-trading on their return made the politics in bloody Camelot look like a picnic, though. Even down where I was I couldn't avoid hearing about it, even if the Toy Soldier hadn't insisted on sending disgustingly chirpy updates via the ship. Demeter wanted Proserpine back; Proserpine had gone and fallen in love with Hecate, in large part to spite her mother; Hecate, to her own surprise, had fallen in love back, or at least had enough respect for Proserpine's understanding of the Acheron to want to keep her around. The agreement ended up being as Demeter would restore supply lines provided Proserpine lived with her; Proserpine, for her part, only acceded in exchange for a job with Hades and spending half the year off planet. Threatening to bring down the computing power behind the planet had made Demeter unpopular enough that when Proserpine turned out to spend most of her time downside at Hecate's estate or the warrens Dionysus' empire, there wasn't a whole lot she could do about it. And as for what happened next...... well, we've told you all the interesting stuff already. Why'd Ashes agree to source grunts for a job that could bring down the Acheron they'd built up? Well, we'd been downside for a while, and we were starting to think about moving on. And that means it was time to shop for presents: Nastya sulks if we don't bring her pretty things for the Aurora, and if Nastya sulks so does the fucking ship. But really, what it comes down to - never mind favours to Daedalus - is that Ashes thought it would probably turn out interesting. Can't say they were wrong... 'course, when we packed up, there was only one person with the background to take over running the planet-wide supercomputer (and she'd worked quite hard to keep it that way). Ashes sent 'em postcards for a while - never did understand it - and even something a little bigger and a little bit more vicious for the wedding, and wasn't that a bugger to ship. Which brings us to the end of this particular winding tale. Stick around and you might get another, but for now-- -- go get drunk.",

    "text": "\"Pan?\" \"Huh\" Pan grunted The young man looked tired. Not physically, but spiritually. He looked as if he'd been around for many life times. The dark circles confirmed he was tired, and the lack of serotonin showed he was also more than likely depressed. His hair was that of a snow storm. He was peacefully gazing into the sky. \"Yeah? What do you want?\" Pan yawned. The dark man with a slick bicycle mustache reached his hand out to Pan. \"Nice boat you have there, made out of gopherwood?\" \"Let me guess... You're the christian god? An angel? I looked into this once.\" \"Well, I've looked into it a lot actually... All religions really. It's not like I'm going anywhere anytime soon.. Or ever.\" \"Do you know where you are, Pan?\" the man spoke calmly. \"Currently.. I'm thinking maybe the tropics.\" \"No.\" he smiled briefly. \"Excuse you? I'm the God of nature, I think I know.\" \"My name is Jesus Christ. JC for short. And you are in Eden. Well, not the Eden you've probably heard of. The other one. The one I visit from time to time, it's pretty nice, right?\" \"My dad lets me stay here and bring friends whenever I feel like it.\" \".....\" Pan was so confused. \"You are not all like you were in the book.\" \"Oh, that. People change over time, you of all people should know that.\" \"I'm just keeping up with how people speak to each other nowadays. Which is, like SO different from when I was a kid.\" He took off his bulky white robe tossing into the tall grass revealing his skin tight purple v-neck, cut off shorts and shoes that read \"TOM'S\" on the heel. \"What are you wearing?\" Pan seemed baffled by Jesus' attire. \"Like it? The humans sure do. That ugly robe was so B.C.\" \"Now I'm stylish,\" He pauses for a moment while checking out Pan, \"You should do the same...\" Pan looked at his physical characteristics. He had the lower body of a goat, red long scraggly hair and beard. Dear Zeus he smelled absolutely awful. \"...Are you suggesting I conform, like you?\" Pan crossed his arms in confusion. \"Exactly. You look like a medieval satyr.\" JC scoffed. \"Let me help you out, I'll give you a complete makeover. You'll look fab.\" \"....\" Pan thought about it, \"I don't know...\" \"PllleASSSSSSSSEEEE PANNNNNN,\" JC pathetically pleaded. \"Well... Alright, lets just see what you can do...\" pan agreed reluctantly. JC was excited and interested in getting to know Pan on a personal level. He didn't want to admit it, but he had been isolated for a while after losing his mortal friends. Sure he could visit them. Sometimes... this all depended on if they had \"crossed over\" or not. Jesus wanted someone he could adventure with that won't grow old and frail. \"Super! Lets get right to it!\" Jesus exclaimed gleefully. \"Watch this\" He snapped his fingers. In the same scenery, yet there was now a VERY tall wide house, Pan thought. Jesus jumped up and down, \"Yay!! The mall!\" Mall? Pan thought. \"What's a 'mall'?\" He looked overwhelmed. Being isolated for centuries and refusing to step foot into any place that was once green and beautiful. \"I'll show you, let's go!\" JC grabbed Pan's hand and took off. I swear I closed my eyes for a second, Pan thought looking around fascinated. \"Let's do something with that hair, you did right by bringing him in JC\" A beautiful glowing man startled Pan. \"Oh hey Uriel\" Jesus half smiled. \"N-not too short okay?\" Pan was suddenly very nervous. \"I'll make you look gorgeous, I swear on my rank as archangel\" Clean shaven, beautifully trimmed snow white locks. \"How do I look?\" Both Uriel and JC were in awe. \"I'm so good at my job\" Uriel wiped away a tear. \"I'd head over to Raphael so he can heal your tragic attire\" Uriel strongly suggested. As they headed out the door Uriel gave Jesus a grim look and whispered. \"Just leave it alone\" Walking into a very pungent room. Not at all bad though, it smelled like all the beautiful smells of nature. \"Ah hello Jesus, and Pan\" a graceful man turned around with a soft smile. Such beautiful eyes. \"This is Raphael, archangel of Healing. He's okay\" JC said unenthusiastically. \"And Uriel, archangel of Justice\" Raphael snapped his fingers. Pan smelled of roses, wore a sweater vest, nicely fitting dress pants and shoes. \"WHERE ARE MY HOOVES?!\" Pan was having a panic attack. Mortified, Jesus immediately held Pan to calm him. \"There\" Jesus sighed relieved. Pan stopped at his break down and breathed normally. He tore off his Doc Martins and smiled when he saw his hooves. \"Alright, lets get going\" Jesus looked like he might cry. Pan took his hand, and as they walked, the mall had ceased its existence. The archangels followed them. They stumbled upon a stair case up into a beautiful treehouse within a redwood. \"Pan!\" a beautiful, familiar voice called out. I need to go up there, Pan thought. He tried to bring Jesus with him but, Jesus stay planted at the steps. \"I can't go with you...but I'll wait here for you\" He smiled half-heartedly. Pan was confused, but just nodded his head and ran up the stairs. Jesus continued to look up at the treehouse. He knew Pan would never leave now that he was with the ones he loved. He swallowed the tears as he turned away to let Pan live in his own heaven, \"Thanks for being my friend.\" Hours after Jesus left, Pan came out excitedly. \"Jesus! You wouldn't belie-\" Pan looked around confused. He said he would wait, Pan whispered to himself. What only felt like hours to him, was years in heaven. He had just said his goodbyes to his loved ones that had long been dead and gone. Pan had returned to be with Jesus. As he waited on the steps of the staircase, Pan's facial hair was growing as the moments past. The dark circles returned under his eyes, and he sat in the pose of the famous \"thinker\". Soon he looked like the old scruffy Pan before the makeover. He didn't move the slightest as the days passed. Soon it was weeks, then months. When years began to pass, Pan was no longer warm flesh. He was cold stone, merely a statue eternally waiting.",

      "\"Let's do something with that hair, you did right by bringing him in JC\" A beautiful glowing man startled Pan.",
      "\"Oh hey Uriel\" Jesus half smiled.",
      "\"N-not too short okay?\" Pan was suddenly very nervous.",
      "\"I'll make you look gorgeous, I swear on my rank as archangel\" Clean shaven, beautifully trimmed snow white locks.",
      "\"How do I look?\"",
      "Both Uriel and JC were in awe.",
      "\"I'm so good at my job\" Uriel wiped away a tear.",
      "\"I'd head over to Raphael so he can heal your tragic attire\" Uriel strongly suggested.",
      "As they headed out the door Uriel gave Jesus a grim look and whispered.",
      "\"Just leave it alone\" Walking into a very pungent room.",
      "Not at all bad though, it smelled like all the beautiful smells of nature.",
      "\"Ah hello Jesus, and Pan\" a graceful man turned around with a soft smile.",
      "Such beautiful eyes.",
      "\"This is Raphael, archangel of Healing.",
      "He's okay\" JC said unenthusiastically.",
      "\"And Uriel, archangel of Justice\" Raphael snapped his fingers.",
      "Pan smelled of roses, wore a sweater vest, nicely fitting dress pants and shoes.",
      "\"WHERE ARE MY HOOVES?!\"",
      "Pan was having a panic attack.",
      "Mortified, Jesus immediately held Pan to calm him.",
      "\"There\" Jesus sighed relieved.",
      "Pan stopped at his break down and breathed normally.",
      "He tore off his Doc Martins and smiled when he saw his hooves.",
      "\"Alright, lets get going\" Jesus looked like he might cry.",
      "Pan took his hand, and as they walked, the mall had ceased its existence.",
      "The archangels followed them.",
      "They stumbled upon a stair case up into a beautiful treehouse within a redwood.",
      "\"Pan!\"",
      "a beautiful, familiar voice called out.",
      "I need to go up there, Pan thought.",
      "He tried to bring Jesus with him but, Jesus stay planted at the steps.",
      "\"I can't go with you...but I'll wait here for you\" He smiled half-heartedly.",
      "Pan was confused, but just nodded his head and ran up the stairs.",
      "Jesus continued to look up at the treehouse.",
      "He knew Pan would never leave now that he was with the ones he loved.",
      "He swallowed the tears as he turned away to let Pan live in his own heaven, \"Thanks for being my friend.\"",
      "Hours after Jesus left, Pan came out excitedly.",
      "\"Jesus!",
      "You wouldn't belie-\" Pan looked around confused.",
      "He said he would wait, Pan whispered to himself.",
      "What only felt like hours to him, was years in heaven.",
      "He had just said his goodbyes to his loved ones that had long been dead and gone.",
      "Pan had returned to be with Jesus.",
      "As he waited on the steps of the staircase, Pan's facial hair was growing as the moments past.",
      "The dark circles returned under his eyes, and he sat in the pose of the famous \"thinker\".",
      "Soon he looked like the old scruffy Pan before the makeover.",
      "He didn't move the slightest as the days passed.",
      "Soon it was weeks, then months.",
      "When years began to pass, Pan was no longer warm flesh.",
      "He was cold stone, merely a statue eternally waiting."

    "text": "She never really considered herself beautiful. Even as she stared at her reflection in the pond outside her home, Medusa didn't see what her mother kept bragging about. She wasn't ugly, that could be plainly seen, but she wasn't the most stunning woman ever created. Her blond hair was softer than most and her skin was a soft peach color that was smooth to the touch. Many a man had asked for her hand, but she turned them down one by one, knowing that it was her beauty she was to be married for and nothing more. Her mother would sometimes, in hushed tones, praise her by saying that she rivaled the beauty of the nymphs and even Aphrodite herself. In response, Medusa would blush, say nothing, but would then go to the temple of Aphrodite and pray that the goddess would restrain her wrath for the day. Every night, she would return and pray again, thanking the goddess for not striking down her mother. Many people had seen Medusa enter the temple alone and believed that she was praying the Aphrodite to enhance her beauty. They were nothing but rumors, but many of the common folk ended up believing them. Today, though, Medusa was visiting another goddess; Athena, Goddess of Wisdom. Medusa's mother had bid her to take the offerings to the temple and thank the goddess for blessing them. The best of her father's crops were divided among sacrifices for Athena and Demeter and while her mother prayed to Demeter for the harvest, Medusa prayed to Athena. Medusa bowed deeply to the idol of Athena, laying down her family's sacrifice for the month; the finest wheat her father had harvested, the first batch of milk the family goat had made, the first figs harvested. The gifts were simple, yet Medusa knew that they pleased the goddess. Making sure that the gifts were arranged perfectly at the foot of the statue, she called out to one of the priestesses to let her know that her family made a sacrifice. \"May Athena's blessings come to you,\" the priestess replied. Medusa bowed again and prostrated herself before the idol, praying for Athena's blessing on her family in the days ahead. \"Why dost thou bow?\" a deep voice said from behind her, \"Thou art matched with the beauty of this goddess.\" Medusa got up from her position and turned to face the one who spoke. The man standing behind her was attractive, to say the least. He was tall and broad shouldered, a small beard adorning his angular face. His deep blue eyes were looking her over as though she was something to be devoured. \"I would not be so vain as to compare myself to the gods,\" she replied. \"But what if I was a god?\" the man asked, stepping closer to her, \"What if I truly believed that thou hast a beauty to rival that of Athena herself?\" Medusa shuffled back. \"I would think that you were foolish and should not speak of such things in a goddess's temple.\" \"Then let me discuss it another way with thy beautiful form.\" The man moved forward and pulled himself onto Medusa's body. Her eyes widened and she began to scream as the world faded around her, leaving just herself and the man. Medusa's knew nothing but water. Deep blue filled her vision as waves lapped at her exposed flesh. She writhed as the waves rocked her and screamed again, not caring if the water surrounding her filled her lungs and drowned her. That would be a just punishment for what she was doing. As suddenly as it happened, it was done. Medusa opened her eyes, the man nowhere in sight. \"Thy punishment is decided,\" a loud voice echoed through the temple, \"Thy once beloved beauty is gone. All who look upon thee now shall be so disgusted that they shall turn to stone.\" Then, the voice was gone and Medusa found herself alone next to the idol, bruised and afraid. \"Lady Medusa, are you alright?\" the soft voice of a priestess called out, \"The goddess has inflicted her wrath upon someone in the temple and I-\" Medusa raised her head and the priestess stopped speaking. The other woman's mouth opened into a large 'O' and she stepped backwards, her eyes wide in fear. Medusa scowled and a soft hissing noise filled her ears. The priestess stopped her backwards retreat, her feet seemingly rooted to the ground. There was a soft clicking as the silk slippers she wore seemed to harden and turn a soft shade of grey. Then, her ankles began the strange transformation, then her calves and her thighs. Medusa saw the girl struggle, but she noticed how the priestess's eyes remained on her at all times. The priestess's whole body turned grey and Medusa watched as one of the priestess's veins pulsed slowly through its alabaster prison. She watched with her own horror as it slowed to a stop, the priestess now a sister to the idol standing next to her. Medusa wanted to cry, wanted to scream, but she couldn't bring herself to. The power she had felt ending the priestess's life was...intoxicating. She absentmindedly licked her lips, a small part of her mind wondering if this was to be part of her punishment. _____________________ The man looked no different from the others; same weapons, same arrogant nature about him, the same intent to kill her. Medusa had killed hundreds of men with a single glance; this newcomer was nothing but another nameless body to be added to the list of deceased. No one who met her gaze ever breathed again. Medusa couldn't help the feral grin that graced her lips. That's why she had been placed on this cursed spit of rock with her 'sisters', the Gorgans. Her gaze had ended many a life on the mainland and, Posiden, the god whose actions had caused this curse to come upon her, had ferried her away to the Island of the Gorgans so that she would not harm another mortal. Yet, every man that set foot on the island was added to her collection of statues. She had hundreds hoarded in her own little corner of the island. Every day, she would gaze at the statues, caressing their faces and kissing their frozen lips, wondering if this would be as close as she would ever get to truly kissing a man. Posiden's rape was still etched into her body as though her own had been made of stone that day, but she wanted a true love instead of a god's affection. Even the pleasure of turning men into stone was beginning to bore her. The man that was approaching her now was still no different than all the others. He was young; too young to be out hunting dangerous things like her. His eyes were bright with youth, but Medusa could see age beginning to find its way into his strong face. Unlike the other men, she noted, he moved slowly, holding up a golden shield instead of a sword. He was moving the shield around him, scrutinizing it with determination. \"You're a smart one,\" she said aloud, making the young man stop in his tracks, \"Using a mirror to figure out my location. I must say that I am impressed.\" The man closed his eyes as she finished speaking, raising the shield so that it was angled away from his body. Medusa licked her lips. Yes, this was turning out to be very interesting. \"What are you called, boy?\" she asked, moving closer to him. She relished the feeling of power as the man's body tensed. \"Perseus,\" he replied. Medusa reached out and caressed his cheek, loving the feel of warm flesh against her fingers. She could feel Perseus's pulse increase as her finger lingered. \"And why have you come?\" she whispered, \"It must have something to do with me. Everyone who steps foot on this island wants to kill me for one reason or another.\" Perseus bit his lip, almost debating whether or not he should reveal his quest to the thing that could end his life as soon as he let his guard down. He let his lip go, resolve urging him on. \"I have come for the head of the ugly Medusa to kill the man who is going to marry my mother.\" Medusa snatched her hand away. \"'Ugly?'\", she repeated, \"There is nothing ugly about me. Years ago, I was adored by many, most of them saying that my beauty rivaled the gods. Athena's curse couldn't have affect that much...\" Looking back on the years she spent before she was sentenced to life on the island, she had never thought of looking in a reflective surface. She stayed as far away from water as she could, ever afraid that Posiden would come for her again. Perseus hesitated. \"You don't know?\" he asked, his eyes still screwed shut. His arm moved slowly, bringing the shield he held closer to her. Its surface glinted in the dim light and Medusa came face to face with her reflection. Medusa stared at herself in horror as she gazed at her reflection. The form of her body hadn't changed much, but she noticed several changes to the contents of her once desired body. Her smooth skin was cracked and looked almost scaly in some places. Her now snake-like eyes widened as she stared at her face, old age and the spell taking its toll in the form of craggy wrinkles and sagging flesh. Medusa almost cried out in shock when she saw that her beautiful golden hair was now a pile of snakes attached to her scalp. They hissed in distress as she reached for them, wanting to tear them out of her and throw them in the dust. They coiled themselves gently around her wrists, their hisses turned soothing as they rubbed their ugly heads against her skin, trying to soothe her. \"I never realized...\" she murmured, the horror gone from her face, but her serpent eyes still gazed at her reflection. \"I guess I am no longer beautiful now.\" And then she heard the sound of steel slicing through flesh and she saw the sky for a moment before everything went black.",

      "The gifts were simple, yet Medusa knew that they pleased the goddess.",
      "Making sure that the gifts were arranged perfectly at the foot of the statue, she called out to one of the priestesses to let her know that her family made a sacrifice.",
      "\"May Athena's blessings come to you,\" the priestess replied.",

      "\"I would not be so vain as to compare myself to the gods,\" she replied.",
      "\"But what if I was a god?\" the man asked, stepping closer to her, \"What if I truly believed that thou hast a beauty to rival that of Athena herself?\"",
      "Medusa shuffled back.",
      "\"I would think that you were foolish and should not speak of such things in a goddess's temple.\"",
      "\"Then let me discuss it another way with thy beautiful form.\"",

      "That would be a just punishment for what she was doing.",
      "As suddenly as it happened, it was done.",
      "Medusa opened her eyes, the man nowhere in sight.",
      "\"Thy punishment is decided,\" a loud voice echoed through the temple, \"Thy once beloved beauty is gone.",
      "All who look upon thee now shall be so disgusted that they shall turn to stone.\"",
      "Then, the voice was gone and Medusa found herself alone next to the idol, bruised and afraid.",
      "\"Lady Medusa, are you alright?\" the soft voice of a priestess called out, \"The goddess has inflicted her wrath upon someone in the temple and I-\" Medusa raised her head and the priestess stopped speaking.",
      "The other woman's mouth opened into a large 'O' and she stepped backwards, her eyes wide in fear.",
      "Medusa scowled and a soft hissing noise filled her ears.",
      "The priestess stopped her backwards retreat, her feet seemingly rooted to the ground.",
      "There was a soft clicking as the silk slippers she wore seemed to harden and turn a soft shade of grey.",
      "Then, her ankles began the strange transformation, then her calves and her thighs.",
      "Medusa saw the girl struggle, but she noticed how the priestess's eyes remained on her at all times.",
      "The priestess's whole body turned grey and Medusa watched as one of the priestess's veins pulsed slowly through its alabaster prison.",
      "She watched with her own horror as it slowed to a stop, the priestess now a sister to the idol standing next to her.",
      "Medusa wanted to cry, wanted to scream, but she couldn't bring herself to.",
      "The power she had felt ending the priestess's life was...intoxicating.",
      "She absentmindedly licked her lips, a small part of her mind wondering if this was to be part of her punishment. _____________________",
      "The man looked no different from the others; same weapons, same arrogant nature about him, the same intent to kill her.",
      "Medusa had killed hundreds of men with a single glance; this newcomer was nothing but another nameless body to be added to the list of deceased.",
      "No one who met her gaze ever breathed again.",
      "Medusa couldn't help the feral grin that graced her lips.",
      "That's why she had been placed on this cursed spit of rock with her 'sisters', the Gorgans.",
      "Her gaze had ended many a life on the mainland and, Posiden, the god whose actions had caused this curse to come upon her, had ferried her away to the Island of the Gorgans so that she would not harm another mortal.",
      "Yet, every man that set foot on the island was added to her collection of statues.",
      "She had hundreds hoarded in her own little corner of the island.",
      "Every day, she would gaze at the statues, caressing their faces and kissing their frozen lips, wondering if this would be as close as she would ever get to truly kissing a man.",
      "Posiden's rape was still etched into her body as though her own had been made of stone that day, but she wanted a true love instead of a god's affection.",
      "Even the pleasure of turning men into stone was beginning to bore her.",
      "The man that was approaching her now was still no different than all the others.",
      "He was young; too young to be out hunting dangerous things like her.",
      "His eyes were bright with youth, but Medusa could see age beginning to find its way into his strong face.",
      "Unlike the other men, she noted, he moved slowly, holding up a golden shield instead of a sword.",
      "He was moving the shield around him, scrutinizing it with determination.",
      "\"You're a smart one,\" she said aloud, making the young man stop in his tracks, \"Using a mirror to figure out my location.",

Where she has capacity, where she IS I would give her a voice. I would gift her words. And the first thing I would have her say is: \"No.\" \"I will not. I, by and of myself, refuse. I am. I can. I decide. I choose. I decline. I don't even like pomegranates.\"",

    "text": "They were nearly done with tea when Persephone shook the cake crumbs from her fingers and said, \"It's nearly time for me to go, you know.\" \"Rude,\" Hel said. She squatted in her chair as she always did, her chin resting on her flesh hand resting on her flesh knee while the bones of her other hand dangled her empty tea cup from her pinky. \"You're one to talk of rudeness.\" Persephone smiled as she said it. When she smiled, flowers bloomed, clouds parted, life began. It was that smile that was the problem. When Hel smiled, and part of her always smiled, people who saw found their jaws locked tight with their returning grins. \"Is it rude that I am leaving or that I am telling you about it.\" \"I know you're leaving. There's no reason to ruining lunch by bringing it up.\" \"Should I have just slipped away without a word?\" \"Rude. You're doing it again. Talking about it. Didn't they teach you not to speak of ugly subjects at the table?\" Persephone sipped her tea through her light little smile. \"They?\" The bones wrapped around the tea cup extended one cold, white digit upwards. \"Them.\" \"If you mean my mother and aunts and uncles,\" Persephone said with the tilt of her head that she did because she was too well-reared to toss it, \"they taught me to speak on flowers and sunlight and long sleeping seeds. Do those subjects belong at your table?\" Hel shivered and sneered. She distrusted things in the ground that wormed their way out. Persephone smiled again, a dimmer smile if not yet a dark one. \"I thought not. You've a taste for the ugly.\" \"You've a taste for pomegranate,\" Hel said, \"but I don't force it down your throat.\" \"I do nothing of the sort now. I merely remind you--it is almost time.\" Hel tossed the tea cup. Some monster scooped it up before it hit the ground and disappeared back into the dust. \"My people come from a harsher land than yours. The frozen children with bloody feet come staggering into my home, and you think I do not know that winter must end.\" \"I never knew you to mourn.\" The flesh of Hel's mouth curved up. \"I miss the summer deaths. A little variety keeps the soul young.\" Persephone finished her drink and rested her mug on the table with a delicate clink. Everything she did, she did delicately. \"Then you don't mind that I go.\" \"I rage every day until you are back. Then I rage a while longer.\" Persephone lowered her eyes as she wrapped her shawl tighter around her. Hades had given it to her two hundred seventy-six winters ago. He'd commissioned it from the Fates themselves, and they'd woven a story into the threads that not even the gods could read. Hela knew that, though Hades and Persephone had told no one. Hela may reign in a darker world than that of Asgard, but she sat on a throne of her own, and she saw such sights as Odin never cast his eye upon. \"We do what we must, Hel,\" Persephone said softly. Hel sighed through the empty hollow of her cheek. \"With bitter hearts to bitter tasks. Isn't that what it means to be a god?\" She stretched and straightened as best she could and slid out of her chair to Persephone's side. \"Come.\" She rested her bone hand on Persephone's forearm and smiled at the familiar shiver. \"I'll show you out.\" Arm in arm, they walked in the tunnels that wound the dark, secret places in the earth and sky. This was Hel's slice of the underworld. Only Hel knew the paths, and the paths knew only Hel. Persephone clung close as they wound and curved through the dark. They made a good pair. Persephone was small enough to fit into the crook of Hel's bones. Hel was tall enough to grate her head against the rock ceiling. She'd be taller still if she stood up straight, but she'd crouched and scuttled and slunk too long for her spine to uncurve. She kept her chin high though. No crowned head may droop. Her crown, her hollow ring of rusted metal from the breast armor of a long dead hero whose name no one alive remembered except herself and you could hardly say she counted. Her crown did not glint. Her crown did not shine. It dug a bloody wound into her flesh. It scraped a regal groove into her bone. Persephone wore no crown. In the spring, she wove flowers in her hair, and in the winter they clung to her still and rotted. Soon the blossoms shook apart when you touched them, and Hel tangled the stinking petals into Persephone's long red hair until the flower queen could not move without shedding crinkled death behind her. Hel knew it was time for winter to end. Persephone's flowers were almost gone. \"Your husband's left you to me,\" Hel said as the tunnel started its final slope up. \"We said our goodbyes last night,\" Persephone replied. \"And he may visit me in the sun if he truly wished. Will you?\" Hel said nothing. \"I thought not. You seem to need the final goodbye more.\" \"You flatter yourself.\" \"Am I wrong? What happened to your rage?\" \"It comes and goes much as you do.\" \"And yet when the first snows of winter come, I hear you calling out my name throughout the entire underworld.\" \"When the first snows of winter come, you send me bodies by the score. Why should I not want to thank you for breaking the monotony of the summer deaths?\" \"You thank me as no one else does.\" \"Not even your husband?\" \"Not even he. My lord's bite is far sweeter than yours.\" \"Then what good is it as a bite?\" They'd nearly reached the surface. The circle of light blazed before them. They halted before the sun could hit Hel's skin and skeleton, and Persephone grabbed Hel's flesh arm. \"Truly, Hel, will you miss me?\" Persephone asked with more innocence than she had ever possessed. Hel's laugh scraped as rough as the rocks of the tunnel. \"You know the answer.\" \"Say it to me anyway.\" Hel grazed her skeleton finger down Persephone's warm, pink cheek. \"If I had stolen you from the field that day, I would not have waited for you to be tempted by seeds. I would have borrowed my dear brother Fenrir's fetters and chained you to my throne for all your days.\" When Persephone smiled, flowers wilted, clouds gathered, life choked. Persephone rewarded Hel with that smile now, and it felt like a stranger's cold hand scratching against the back of her neck. Persephone rested one delicate hand on Hel's face and turned it to look at the bone side. And then, on raised toes, Persephone pressed her lips to Hel's exposed teeth. \"I'll see you at the first snowfall,\" she whispered into Hel's cheek, into the hollow of Hel's skull. \"When you can hold a frozen babe to your rotting breast, you will know that I am come home.\" With that, Persephone slipped free and without one backward look skipped into the sunlight. Hel, alone, shivered in the tunnel, in the dark, in the blessed dark, and began the long count until the Earth became once again as cold as Persephone's beautiful heart.",

      "\"I'll see you at the first snowfall,\" she whispered into Hel's cheek, into the hollow of Hel's skull.",
      "\"When you can hold a frozen babe to your rotting breast, you will know that I am come home.\"",
      "With that, Persephone slipped free and without one backward look skipped into the sunlight.",
      "Hel, alone, shivered in the tunnel, in the dark, in the blessed dark, and began the long count until the Earth became once again as cold as Persephone's beautiful heart."

    "text": "Hestia watched dispassionately as the other Goddesses dove for the apple of discord. By its very nature, the prize would not be worth winning, and the battle over it would also tear Olympus apart. Hestia was not a seer, beyond her divine foresight, but she had watched thousands of lives through thousands of fires, and she could predict the current chain of events with great certainty. Eris's 'gift' would come close to destroying Hestia's gleaming home with fighting and strife. However, it also might provide a rare opportunity for herself, if she laid the proper foundation. Hestia began to plan. *** Eris was cunning, and the effects of her discord would not end with the awarding of the Apple. Olympus would continue to suffer for it. As usual, Hestia would remain out of the fight, but that did not mean that she would remain out of the lives of the mortals who worshiped her. Every sacrifice to her siblings in the coming battles would also sustain her, and Hestia would use their added tributes as she forged her great enterprise. Hestia had no temples of her own, but the honor bestowed upon her by her siblings' supplicants would be enough. For now. *** She was young, true, but as Hestia watched her speak the words of supplication and praise, Hestia knew the girl would try her hardest to carry out her duties. Keeping the flames alight was an important task, and if this child could succeed, she would truly be worthy of Hestia's patronage. As the men rushed down the craggy path to the fleet and the sacrificial flames died down, most looked to the sea, to watch the armada sail. Two young boys spared one glance back at their sister and their home before turning forward to their destiny. Little Hermione, however, continued to watch the dancing flames before her, oblivious to her brothers' last expression. Her entire being was focused on the fire that was now in her keeping, and the chore that lay ahead of her. Pleased, Hestia allowed a little of her essence to leak through the fire, appearing to the girl and granting her blessing. Hermione's eyes widened and Hestia knew that the girl had seen her veiled aspect in the pyre. The young girl gulped, and then ducked her head in respect. Extraordinarily pleased, Hestia nodded before withdrawing. Yes, this child would do well. *** As Hestia had predicted, Olympian was fighting Olympian, as they never had before, and it was frankly a bit unbecoming to see them scuffing around in the dirt and blood like a bunch of mortals. Of course, the war, and her sibling's involvement, were key cornerstones in her building plot, so Hestia couldn't be too upset at their predicted behaviors. Whenever her siblings and their children took a break, Hestia would turn her gaze back to Sparta, to the quickly growing Hermione. She never ignored her other sacred fires and new flame keepers, but Hermione was her favorite to watch. Despite having older relatives and advisors, Hermione had taken on the care and keeping of the Prytaneum herself, and had never once let it die. Hestia could not say the same of many new brides with twice her years, and it pleased the Goddess that her young acolyte was doing so well. The ritualistic words never tangled on her tongue, and the sacrifices she chose were always fresh and fitting to honor her goddess. Hestia could not ask for a better servant. Hermione lit regular sacrifices for the welfare of her brothers and parents, and Hestia would often grant her visions in the fires. Sometimes it was the Goddess's own image, sometimes they were of the battered walls of Troy or the face of one of her distant family. Occasionally Hestia would show her a distant land by the sea, lush and plentiful. Waves lapped gently at the sloped shore, and sea life thrived along the strand. Strong trees and abundant fields dotted the landscape, and sloped hills overlooked it all. This sight initially confused the girl, but soon she took comfort in the spectacle. Sparta was a harsh land, and the city proper was far from the beaches, where the waves crashed into the craggy cliffs. More importantly, its welfare was buttressed on the back of this young child; but the land Hestia showed her was that of a relative paradise, where she would be free of responsibility. Once Hermione realized that, she began to appreciate the vision, and eventually long for it. *** Her looks did little to faze the blithe goddess, but Hestia knew that the others noticed. And later, when the plan she was building came to fruition, Hestia's disapproval of Aphrodite would be a chink in the other's wall of power, just as would Demeter's rage, and Poseidon's backing of the Spartans. Hestia would not make her stance on the whole debacle so obvious, but she knew that her silence would say more, in the longer course. Late at night, however, when the other Olympians slept or tended to their baser needs, Hestia smirked, and planned, and appeared to Hermione. The girl had grown into a young woman, with suitors of her own, but Hermione held them all at arm's length. She who had run a kingdom at seven could not be easily wooed by a man older yet less mature than her. Hestia approved, in principle, though she did intend for the girl to eventually bear heirs. Hermione had been betrothed at her birth by her grandfather, and Hestia knew it, but in the stupor of war, her father had promised her to another. Hermione confided this to Hestia's flame as she tended it late at night, as well as her indifference about marrying either man. She admitted her confused feelings about the return of her mother - a mere ghost of the memory that Hermione had cherished in this lonely interval. She declared her love of the land she had tended these long years, and the pain of being put aside in the returned presence of her father and brothers - war heroes that they were. She confessed her longing for the land she saw in the sacred fire, and how she wished to run away from Sparta and retreat there, creating her own colony that she could call a home. Hestia was pleased that her chosen had matured so perfectly according to plan, and she granted her supplicant an answer, of sorts, in the dancing flames. She showed Hermione the new suitor's visage, and then once again the land of her dreams. The message was clear; the first would lead to the second. The new suitor was not Hestia's true choice, but other events needed to happen in a certain order for her plans to come to fruition, and the relationship with Neoptolemos would keep Hermione safely occupied until she was needed. They would not necessarily be happy years for Hermione, but then one could hardly say that the last ten years had been particularly pleasant for her, and Hestia needed her strong, not content. *** Little Herakles was a swaddling babe, but his birth had been the final tinder on Hestia's planned pyre. The Dryopian king wooed Hermione, and she wearily accepted. Pleased, Hestia blessed her with fruitful loins, painless childbirth, and a comfortable home. After all, her favorite supplicant deserved the best for now. With a strong son named Menelaus after his grandfather, and five lovely daughters, Hermione was allowed at last to relax and take her ease. However, as Hestia knew she would, the wise mother continued to tend to the sacred fires of her home and her husband's Prytaneum, never abdicating that duty to another. Hestia had been her patron mother for far too long for Hermione to renounce that task. And Hestia continued to reward her, with glimpses of her other, grown child, and her patroness's pleased visage. And always, always, the town on the seaside, in its Elysian splendor. For as long as that vision appeared in the flames, Hestia knew that Hermione would never truly be content. The years flew by, and Hermione's husband eventually died, making her son the King of the Dryopes. This was the moment Hestia had been waiting for, and she began to whisper in his ear at night. Little sighs, hidden in the crackling of the flames that warmed his bedchambers. Little murmurs, asking why so many rich travelers passed through his lands without paying him anything for the privilege. Certainly, he controlled the easiest pass through the mountains to the Temple at Delphi, and surely his good graces were worth something to the pilgrims he supported thusly. Fair Apollo was always in the Underworld, making his long return trip, and so never heard Hestia's whispers. Artemis caught them, but still upset with her brother's attack on Orion, she allowed her aunt her little trick. Hestia had long supported the younger Goddess, taking her side against Zeus when the child swore off marriage, and the huntress knew it well. Within a few mortal months, Menelaus of Dryope was accosting the pilgrims headed for Delphi, and Apollo had taken notice. When Zeus ignored his pleas, he appealed to his half-brother, Herakles, who would soon be passing through the area in disguise. As Hestia had planned, Menelaus's men accosted the young Olympian, assuming him to be a rich pilgrim. Her nephew slew them easily, and each ensuing wave of Dryopian warriors. Soon, young, cocky, Menelaus and his army were dead, and the remaining Dryopians were banished from their lands. They were directed south, to the rocky shores far from their fertile homes. So the aged Hermione led her people steadily onwards, with her grandchildren at her side. And Hestia led Hermione, offering direction in the fires of local shepherds, and at each Prytaneum they passed through. They were always greeted courteously by the village leaders, but it was clear that they were not welcome to stay, and the vision of her promised land prompted Hermione to continue, driving her people along Hestia's carefully laid path. Hermione had entrusted her oldest granddaughter with the sacred flame from Dryope, which they would use to establish a new Prytaneum once they found a suitable spot. Pleased with this forethought, and with the efforts of the proud girl who so resembled her favored grandmother, Hestia continued to ease their route as she lead them ever onwards. Until, at long last, they arrived at Hermione's seaside dreamland. *** Her pragmatic granddaughter immediately took charge, commanding first and foremost that the Prytaneum be built for the fire that she still carried, and then the town around it. Well pleased, Hestia withdrew from the watchful flames to observe the chaos that would once again descend on Olympus. As she had predicted so many years ago, and as had happened so often, each of her family was arguing the new town as their own, desperately trying to lay claim to some descendent or favored petitioner among the Dryopians. If they could only convince the others, any one could have a prosperous new field of strong, hard-working, supplicants. Finally, when the quarreling grew so loud and heated that the wind from their speech threatened her flame, Hestia rose. It took mere moments - more by mortal standards - for the others to notice, but soon the gleaming halls of Olympus fell silent. \"If I may,\" Hestia began quietly, politely, demurely. \"These mortals were chased from their home by Herakles. Perhaps they would be uncomfortable worshiping his parents,\" she nodded to her siblings, \"or one of his brothers or sisters.\" She sat again, and allowed the others to resume their debate. Apollo was immediately rejected by the others, since he was not pleased with the Dryopian siege on Delphi. Athena was also rejected, due to her patronage of the prosperous Athens. Soon, as Hestia had suggested, Herakles's other siblings dropped from contention, followed by Zeus and Hera, both already more than satisfied with their large numbers of worshipers. Dionysus soon followed suit, worn out from the bickering and in need of a strong drink to lift his spirits. Hestia allowed the arguments to continue, this time centered around Demeter, Poseidon, and Aphrodite. The goddess of love was quickly overruled once Hermione's history was discovered, and Aphrodite's hand in ripping apart her family was gleefully pointed out by Demeter. She had never quite forgiven Aphrodite for her part in Persephone's situation, and Hestia had been counting on her younger sister to bring up the lamentable tale of Helen. And at last she was left with her two siblings, each with valid claim. Since the town was on the seashore, it could reasonably be said to follow Poseidon, who had already lost out on the patronage of Athens in his earlier suit. However, due to its plentiful crops, Demeter also had fair claim, and she knew that Zeus was still paying her penance for his inaction during Persephone's abduction. Demeter could just as easily win this argument. However, Hestia had been preparing for this moment for years, laying the foundation work so subtly that none of the others would notice until the building was completed. After days of battle between Poseidon and Demeter, Hestia judged that the time was right. Standing once again, she quickly attracted the attention of the crowd, who had become content to sit on their own thrones and watch the sparks fly. \"If I may,\" she offered courteously to Zeus once the hall was quiet, \"I dislike seeing such discord among my siblings. I have no throne to give up this time, but perhaps I have another solution. To keep my honorable siblings from fighting so, perhaps the patronage of this new town could be laden upon me? I would take on the task of guarding and guiding these displaced souls so that harmony could return to these halls.\" Her logic was sound, and her offer generous, and furthermore it was her due, as she had no temples or towns to her name, as each other Olympian already had. Demeter and Poseidon fell silent, and Hestia knew that they were trying to figure out a way to overcome her suggestion and still win this battle. However, she knew she had already won. She had won when Aphrodite promised Helen to Paris. She had won when Poseidon lost Athens to her niece. She had won all those centuries ago when she had given up her uncomfortable throne to the brazen young god of drink. ***",

    "text": "NYMPH.... Apollo sighed. He was confused, that was the second time he heard somebody calling Dio as if he were a woman, the first time was his own lover who said that. He knew that there was something shady about the past of the God of the Wine and Ecstasy, who was sleeping very peacefully next to him. Apollo smiled and caressed the terse waterfall of blond hair resting on the white silk that covered the bed they both shared. He barely touched with his fingertips, the profile of the other God; really, Dio had very feminine factions but the God of the Sun was certainly sure, that his little brother, as stubborn as he was, will never talk. Heavily he left the bed and touched his own naked body, feeling--more than his own nudity--Dionysus' scent impregnated on his skin. After dressing up, he kissed his brother's forehead, who will not wake up 'till a couple of hours later. Making love five times in a night, after drinking a little, always made Dio feel tired. Apollo wore his sandals with gold ties and took a thin layer; he decided that he needed to find the nymphs. Only they knew where to find the person who knows the information he needs. And he will find them... they had to talk, by the good way or bad way.... The path he took was a little confusing and long, every time he arrived where Pan must be, he wasn't there. Of course, the nymphs told him where to go, but it was always the same. Then, during his walk through the forest, he stumbled with something; thanks to Zeus his face didn't hit the floor and thanks, too, to his agility that he could put his hands between him and the rocky soil in time. A complaint could be heard, and Apollo turned angrily to saw him. Lying on the floor, drunk and sleeping. With all his elegance, Apollo stood and kicked Pan's stomach; and the son of Hermes woke up cursing in name of Zeus, but he felt silent the moment he looked up and saw those angry green eyes. Pan gulped and tried to smile. The satyr was nasty, in the opinion of Apollo. \"May I help you?\" \"Sit down and start talking.\" The young satyr obeyed him and sat next to the God, and Apollo almost yelled. \"No next to me, you--\" If Pan saw or not the grimace on Apollo's face, Apollo couldn't care less; with his hands in his head Pan sat leaning against a rock, whilst Apollo was sitting on one. \"Now, I want to know about Dionysus.\" \"W-what do you need to k-know?\" \"Everything, so start now.\" \"Sure?\" \"Speak it out!\" Pan shivered, and thought how Dionysus would torture him if he ever found out; but really, he was most scared of Apollo, his best friend's lover/brother. After a deep sigh, the satyr began to talk. He said everything he knew, since Dionysus' premature birth due to his mom's death by Zeus's own hand, and caused by Hera.... \"Dio was born... Ummm... sexless. And your daddy Zeus... I mean, the almighty Zeus kept him on his thigh. \"Time passed, and Dionysus demanded to get out of there, but if he did, your stepmother would have killed him. Hence, due to Dio's androgynous nature; Zeus gave Dionysus to the nymphs of the North; he asked them to hide him... and, Hera sought for him; but--this was, supposed to be only the nymphs' knowledge. \"Dio knew how to change himself at his desire... I mean; he knows how to change his sexuality. \" Clarified Pan, at Apollo's confused gaze. \"Dionysus can be a man or a woman, whatever he wants, the fact that he was born with pe-... manhood, his body and face were--and still are--pretty feminine. \"And he used to take it in on his own favor, he lived like a woman till he turned 13.\" Apollo nodded and gestured with one hand. \"At the same time I, one year older, was looking for the kind of pleasures that the north could offer to me, and we met. \"It was near a lake. The cold embraced my entire being. But for her, it was so natural, the cold couldn't touch her; her blond hair fell on her shoulders. And she took it off her forehead with a ribbon. Her body was thin but it had a nice curvy shape--if I may say--, her big and blue eyes, and her naked white. \"I couldn't believe that she was a simple nymph.\" Pan looked at Apollo, waiting for any kind of sign that could put his life at risk. \"When I met her, her cheeks were flushed and her eyes were glassy; she smiled at me and called me while she laughed. \" Pan doubted, he didn't want to die, just because he admitted that the simple sight of her aroused him. In the end, the satyr decided that he appreciated his manliness more than honesty. The satyr just kept that little detail. The serious--and suprised--green glance commanded him to continue. \"Well! She called out to me and told me that she opened a cellar to steal some grapes, but they were no longer to eat; she put up one of her feet on my face; it was stained and soaked. They dripped a pinkish liquid that, after a while, she gave me to taste; she forced me to drink her new 'accidental' invention. \"We drank it all. When our elixir was gone, there was no more cold, and I could feel heat running through my whole body. I looked up, and saw how she got naked and stood on a little wood bucket; I heard the tune of fruits being smashed. \"I'm a curious satyr, so I got closer and looked what she was squelching. Grapevines! The flavor was amazing. \" The satyr shut up suddenly. He recalled how he cleaned the 'nymph's' feet with his tongue. He remembered how that night he made her his, and the next morning they woke up with a horrible headache and sickness, and he discovered she wasn't a virgin nymph. \"Together we suffered the pain of the day after drunkenness. She introduced herself as Dionysus, thing that made me doubt. She was a nymph with a male name! \"After two nights, obviously drinking, I got to know her better; the fact she was SON of Zeus, and she was a GOD. Male, a dude hidden among women, dressed as one. That was a shock. \"When I met Dio, he was a merry-maker, knew how to seduce and please men and women alike. So young! \" Apollo's eyes shone with anger. He was processing all that was said to him. Now there was only something left. \"Now, tell me when you took his purity.\" \"I did not!\" Pan yelled scared. He stood quickly, the satyr was ready to run. \"Dionysus wasn't-- I've never.... I don't know who was the first... I swear! \" Apollo stood and clicked his tongue, no need to know more, he already got what he wanted, the other part of the story. He ignored Pan, but the satyr was not done yet, he wanted to say 'that'. So when the God turned to go, Pan called out for him. \"What everybody ignores about Dio is... he is hermaphrodite. And he can bear children. \" Pan raised his eyebrows mischievously. \"Of course he can,\" growled the God of the Sun. \"If he couldn't then all those bast-- Did you say bear children?\" Apollo's face was priceless. In the end, he smirked. \"You know? I'm starting to like you. \" Saying that, Apollo went away with a big smile on his face; Pan let his body crash against the floor and slept. And Dionysus, well he couldn't even imagine what was going to come to him.",

    "text": "Possession.... It was an easy situation, deep inside, he was burning. His heart was pounding and the wrath was eating his senses. He is a really passive and pacific man --God--; he likes to play the lyre and watch how the nymphs dance with the music around the fields; but that moment, just was that right moment when he wishes to take Ares' spear and nail it in the blond's forehead. He doesn't know why, but only seeing him makes he feel angry, only he can take all his dignity away. Seeing him with that smile on his face, with that bright in his blue eyes, with that soft blush on his cheeks. He hates it all! But what he hated the most was no being he who had the attention of the youngest of all the Zeus' sons. He knew the reason of his happiness. He was with that stupid faun. That son of Mercury! He hates him. He hates him more than anyone; more than he could hate Hephaestos' aspect; and he cannot understand how beautiful things could relate with the bestiality. He cannot understand how Dio could look at him. And not conformable with that, they used to drunk together, they went out together, laughed together, chatted for hours and the damned Pan touched him. He dares to touch with his filthy hands the white and soft skin of the other God, he has no right to do that! And if someone thought that the things couldn't be more fucked up, his little brother enjoyed to going to the mortal's land with the... freak and listened it playing the flute. Apollo desired that flute, but he... it...--whatever that Pan was--dared to deny it to him; he took a posture of dignity, like if he was someone who deserves dignity. And he, Apollo, is a God and Pan, he is not more than a crafty satyr with the worst instincts ever known. That was one of the reason why he couldn't understand why Dionysus, HIS DIO! Likes to be next to it. Being with that creepy creation instead of being with him. He chose ugliness instead the beauty, the mundane instead the sacred. When he arrived, he did it with a wide smile and a bit drunk, his hair was a mess, a beautiful mess. Because Dionysus is beautiful and he, as the God who loves the beauty, he loves Dionysus, he wants him. \"Nice time, isn't it?\" \"Of course dad!... Oh! I forgot!\" the blond got closer to Hermes and punched him right in the back. \"Pan said you deserved this\". Zeus started to laugh loudly, and his stepmother rolled her eyes, same did Athena and Artemis, Apollo felt outraged and the other Gods and Goddess laugh of the messenger's pain. Aphrodite got closer to the young God and hugged him, and Apollo wished went to Ares and reclaimed him about calming his lover-slut. The sensual Goddess gently collected the fines and golden hairs and her smirk got bigger. And this wasn't good news for the God of the Sun. \"I can guess you had a really~ good time, Dio~!\" \"Are you a gipsy?\" \"Your neck tells me so~...\" Dionysus laughed nervously and the deep green eyes of Apollo looked at his brother's neck. The last thing that the Gods heard was the crash of a flagon. Everybody in the Olympus noticed it, all the looks watched the back of the brightness god, with head up, and his fists were so tight that his muscles were more marked, and his veins stood out more than Heracles'. The blond God lowered his head; letting his blonde bangs hid his blue eyes and his smile disappeared. Aphrodite noticed, so did Zeus. The woman approached to his older brother and let her thin fingers lay down on the shoulders of the God father. \"Little~ brother~\" Zeus sighed. \"Do whatever you want\" Dio hid with his hand the hickey on his neck and left the Olympus, going to shelter to his temple.... His quarters were a mess, and not because he wasn't organized. That mess was the result of his crescent wrath. Since the moment he crossed the doors of his temple he threw everything that he has near to him. At the end he lied on the divan, after threw all the pillows, of course. \"The perfect son losing his mind, that's not cute~ your pucker frown ruins your beauty face~\" \"Get outta here!\" \"How rude~! Where's the helpfully, reserved and neutral Apollo? \"I cannot recall having any kind of relation with you in my whole life, neither I want it now\" \"But if I were Dio~....\" Apollo stood and looked at her straight in her teal eyes, and he puckered more his frown. What kind of privileges has she to call in that way his God of the Wine? His--young--aunt raised her eyebrow and took off her long hair to her back, and when he less expected, she was onto him. The young Apollo did not have enough time to push her away when a couple of steps took his attention. His eyes widened looking at his brother staring at them with a big jar on hands. \"I--I am so sorry for... interrupting you\" Dionysus looked away clearly sad. \"My dad asked me to bring you this. So.... Excuse me\" The blond left the wine jar on the floor and turned around, leaving the temple as fast as he could. Apollo blinked and wished sought for his brother, but an extra weight guard against him. He remembered that he was with his nymphomaniac aunt. But before he could do nothing, Aphrodite smiled and kissed him to leave running singing an anthem. His bowels were burning and now, in fact. He not only wanted to kill Pan--and Hermes for giving birth to a monster like that--, but also, he would love to scarify Aphrodite; the world could survive without Goddess of Beauty and Love. He felt like a lion inside a cage. He couldn't take the things easy. He'd never felt that way before, neither when Artemis persisted in foolishness with Orion. Apollo was aware that jealousies were killing him; he admitted being a jealous man--God--, jealous and possessive. And now, he will show it to Dionysus by the good way or bad way; and of course he will show it to the satyr too.... Dionysus changed his direction without realizing it, he arrived to a wedding and 'play' with the bride and her friends, maybe in three trimesters he will be father again, couldn't care less. Dio took two jars of wine and walked into the forest. The sweet melody of a flute and the nymph's laughs guided him through the forest to his destiny. A beautiful lake surrounded by mountains, the place where the river rest and where the nymphs play and dance only wetting the tip of their feet. Wait. He just waited until his inseparable friend end with his music; when it happened the blond had put the jar on the floor and smiled sadly to Pan, and Pan got it. \"Well beauties, it's time for your nap\" The nymphs argued, but with a gaze of the satyr were enough to keep them quiet and made their understood that he wanted that they get out. \"We will play tomorrow sweeties.\" Every one began to disappear. One nymph flew with the wind, some of them ran with the river and the other just became one with the earth and the flowers. When Pan stood he fell down again with an extra weight, and very hungry lips on his; he kissed back and hugged the thin body over him. \"You drank without me!\" \"Yeah~! It was a wedding.\" \"That means.... I'll be uncle... again!\" \"Of cooooursee~ heehe. I always do a good job,\" he laughed and kissed him again before to stand up and apologize because of his effusively. They sat leaning against the trunk of a leafy tree and they began to drink, laugh, teased and caressed awhile. The time passed with jokes and the sky gradually stained in a pretty orange color. Pan was drunk and his eyes show it; and Dio... well his blush could make competition with Antares. Strong steps could be heard whilst they broke leaves and branches, but the God and his friend thought that it could be a doe looking for a place to spend the night. The degree of intoxication in their blood, the lust, the Dionysus' broken heart and the very aphrodisiac scene that they stared at, made they kiss again while Pan caressed one of the white thighs of the young God. The ceramic cups were poured wetting their bodies and making the sweet scent of the wine gets impregnated onto them. The kiss was cut, and no because they wanted, but for a strongest force that pulled of the God out of Pan's range. Pulling he so hard that the touch on his skin became a bloody scratch. Dionysus staggered quite dizzy but he never fell down, because a strong chest kept him; he looked up and met with the angrily eyes of the God of the Sun, he shivered and tried to walk away. Apollo did not give his 'enemy' time to react when he sinks his fist in Pan's stomach. That was the first time Apollo hit anyone. And it feels so damn good! With a smile he took his brother's wrist and walked away with him. They continued walking along the river, but Dio couldn't walk more and fell down, he was no more drunk, but now he's scared and his legs were affected due to the alcohol that he had drank. He sat over the grass and touched his hurt thigh; he realizes then that his robe was dyed with red. He is close to touch the three scratches on his skin when a soft hand stopped him. Apollo was sitting with his legs on the sides of the other God; he caresses the bloody thigh and laid his forehead in the blond's crook between the neck and shoulder. With his hands he covers the blood. Apollo's strong hands made force on Dionysus and made him lay. Then they looked at each other. Green wrath and blue sadness meet. The pupils do not stop looking, neither when Apollo looked for the other lips, whose denied the kiss, but when Apollo's tongue started to draw their form, they agreed. It was a very, very weird kiss, and Dio takes it as a mock, due the excess of visual contact; slowly he poses his hands on his old brother's arms, trying to keep him away. His eyes filled with tears but Apollo couldn't care less, he only kisses him harder and Dionysus couldn't keep the rhythm. Dionysus moans when felt his brother's pelvis against him with the proof of what Apollo desired. When he broke the kiss, he didn't let him go. His tongues licked the neck and naked chest and.... Stop! Apollo's pucker frown cannot be more... pucker. \"You smell like him\" \"Eh?\" He never got an answer, instead he flew direct to the river, when he reacted he spites out water and waves his long hair to remove the excess of water, ready to yell at his brother, he saw him totally naked entering in to the river. And the blush replaced the embarrassment that the wine had produced. Both chests collided when Apollo took Dionysus sharply, action that Dionysus felt a bit painful. The embrace was possessive and rude, like the way they kissed. For first time in his bender life, Dio did not know how to respond, that was the most passionate he tasted ever, neither his satiric friend kissed like that. Less Eros, his cousin cannot emanate too much passion as his brother does. He shivers. Apollo's hands down his back and posed in his hips helping-forcing him to open his legs. In that moment Dionysus realizes his own excitation. Because he knows that the love that he professed to his older brother couldn't be as he desires, but just sex was fine to him, sex instead the hater of the favorite of his siblings. In that way, he could say that he loved him a little. Instinctively he wrapped his legs around the athletic waist. The water, cold at the beginning, became warm; the sky was dyed with an orange shade that made the illusion of fire in the water. Helios was tired, but Apollo was not too interested in doing his duty; for him, his only duty is with the other God; to kiss him, lick him, suck his skin and bite that little purple stain in his neck, that mark that he never made. Apollo wants erase all the marks that were done before him; and there was only one way to do it. He did it in one movement; shushed the scream-moan of the younger with a deep kiss; put one hand in his hips and the right behind his head. \"Open your eyes.\"... \"Please, open your eyes\" kisses his cheek. \"I want to see you whilst you look at me melted in pleasure\". The blue constellations widened slowly, they were crystalline, tearful and overflowing a lot of feelings at the same time. The movement their hips marked was fast and deep, rhythmic, though, no matter how athletic and agile was the God of the sun, he wasn't made of rock. Even with the body over him, he went to the edge of the river and recharges his brother's body there. The access was easily, the thrusts increased their speed and in the whole wide forest the moans of the two immortal siblings were the only thing that could be heard. Dio clung to the strong back and buries his nails into Apollo's skin from time to time. His mouth, before denied to talk now could gesturing only moans. The nature was in a peaceful silence, only the siblings disturbed that peace that must be night, but that still with soft red lights. At the beginning, when Dionysus was thrown to water it dyed red, now the predominant color in the water was represented by thin whitish brands that floated to the surface. The lips looked for each other, and when they met they kissed in a passionate, sweet and paused way; they have no more forces, but they still cling on each other. Apollo wants to never let him go, and Dionysus was scared of lossing his 'secret love'. Both's soaked hair stuck in their faces and necks. \"What a beautiful scene~. You two look so tender together~\" Dionysus startled at the call of his aunt, and he pulled apart--without wishing it--the other body. Apollo looked at her with his most terrifying glance, letting her know that she was interfering. \"Uuuu~! No, no, no~, that gaze isn't as chilling as your father's\" \"Is dad angry? Why?\" The blonde took out his head of the water. \"Mmmm lemme see... Oh! I remember~! The night must fell down two hours ago~ hehehe and my precious little brother really wanna make you bu~rn.\" Apollo sighed and rolled his eyes getting out of the water. Aphrodite did not miss the opportunity to appreciate him, she bites her lower lip in a signal of desire; but she suddenly yelled angrily when the water went to her face and wetted her. So, she disappeared. The God of the Sun 'gets dressed' and starts his walk to his labor, that fucking labor that keeps him away from Dio. Dionysus lowered his face, in the end he knew that it will happen.... 'Hey! It's a nice memory!' He thought.... For the moon's position he wondered that it was past the midnight; a grape fell and rolled form his throne, but he hadn't enough forces and his mood was the worst; his hips hurt to die. He was resigned to sleep there; because never in his entire life, nobody fucked him as hard as Apollo did during the strange dusk. He sighs again and takes another grape from the golden recipient next to him, tosses it to his lips and bites it how juicy it was. The sweet fluid slipped through his lips and gets lost in his chin. He licked all he could. \"That's a very filthy way to being resting,\" Dionysus looks up and sees his brother standing with a grape in his fingers, Apollo licks it and then eats it. \"You really don't know how that teases me\". Careful not to do too much effort, Dio sat in a 'correct' way. He crossed his legs very slowly, but he let Apollo saw the naked of his body under the robes. The God got excited. \"And... how did it go with dad?\" \"It does not matter now\". He gets closer, face to face with the God of the Wine. \"It is you, oh great God of wines and ecstasy what I want!\" Dio laughs and blushes, the older one took his chin and forced him to look at him. \"Now tell me, my dear little brother. How many sluts you fucked?\" The blond blinked and laughed. \"More than you can count.\" \"And... For how many bastards have you opened your legs?\" \"I won't tell you that!\" And the grip gets stronger. \"Anyway, why do you want to know it?\" \"I will caponize all of them, one by one.\" \"....\" \"... And your satiric friend is the number one, on my list.\" \"Pan's not to blame to have met me as a 'nymph' and not as a God.\" \"Pardon? You? A nymph?\" \"Long story.\" Dionysus rolled his eyes blushing, Apollo stopped the grip and caresses the blond's hair. \"We have a lot of life, but, before...\" Apollo acts faster that Dionysus' thoughts and got him naked in seconds. \"I have to clean your skin of the filthy and mundane scent that those depreciable beings left on your body.\" \"You are...\" \"... I have always been a jealous person\" the chat ended when Apollo kissed him.... OMAKE. \"C'mon Dio! Give me more wine\" \"Hahahahahaha ok ok, but before... I challenge you to...\" \"I'm not scared of you or your challenges.\" \"So, if you are pretty sure...\" Dio gets closer to his friend's ear, but he couldn't whisper nothing when a very familiar scene repeats. He was pulled into strong arms and was jailed in a warm chest. \"Get. Away!\" A loud voice threatened. \"He is mine\". \"You know Dio. I am not afraid of you, but... I kept respect, loyalty and precaution of your brother\" saying it, Pan disappeared.",

    "text": "In a word, Apollo was pissed. Not just annoyed or missed or even angry, but pissed. And for him, that was one step away from furious. Now, Apollo was normally a very sunny guy. Literally and figuratively. Sure, the sun god was prone to jealous fits, dark spells and being a downright pain, but he was usually very happy and that was why all the gods and goddesses (Except Hera) liked him. But today they stayed far away from him. That's how angry he was. For one thing, he was having the worst week ever. On Sunday Artemis stood him up for stupid Orion (for the fiftieth time!). On Monday a wood nymph rejected him. Wood nymphs were known for being rather loose and would seduce anyone, but apparently, Apollo wasn't good enough. On Tuesday he tried to talk to Artemis about spending more time together, but she accidentally shot him in the foot. On Wednesday he went back to talk to Artemis but saw her making out with Orion. That pretty much ruined the rest of his week. So to make himself feel better, on Thursday he tried to get a date with a human girl. But the girl rejected him so he turned her into a tree. That made him feel a little better, so he went home on Thursday almost back to his usual happy self. But it was Friday today, and he was mad again. He had woken up, feeling great, to find all of his cows MISSING! \"UGH!\" Apollo screamed at the sky, half hoping that his father would hear him. \"How could this get any worse?\" It started to rain. \"Oh great.\" Apollo looked around the pasture for signs of his cattle, but all he found was mud. And cow poop. His clothes were getting wet, he was getting angry and his cows would never be found. Just as he started to go in, he found small baby footprints on the ground. They looked as if they were moving very fast. He stopped to think, wiping the rain off his brow. \"Hmm...it would have taken someone really fast to make these footprints. Who do I know who's really fast?\" After a few minutes of thinking, he had it. \"HERMES!\" That dumb baby had taken his cows. Apollo, the charming and powerful god of the sun, had been robbed by a baby! Apollo stomped all the way back to his house and grabbed his coat. \"I'm going to show that brat places the sun don't shine!\" He hissed through gritted, chattering teeth, as he was soaked to the bone from the rain. After drying himself off, he went out to his stable. \"At least my horses weren't stolen.\" He quickly mounted his horses and sped off to the house of Maia, Herme's mother. However, Apollo was about to learn an important lesson. Gold, even special god gold, rusts really quickly under magic rain. The wheels ground to a halt and Apollo went flying from his chariot. The horses seized the opportunity and ran away. Apollo lay on the ground, blond hair covered in dirt. His hands and knees were scraped and he had broken a toe. \"For the second time this week, too.\" Muttered Apollo as he got up and dusted himself off. He looked up. \"At least the rain stopped.\" Apollo limped down the road, pain lacing his every step. \"I don't know how this could get any worse!\" He exclaimed, stomping the ground. Which was a bad idea, because it sent pain straight up through his leg. And then it started to rain harder. \"Great.\" Muttered Apollo, limping down the road. \"This is going to be a long day.\" Meanwhile, Maia was unaware of anything going on. She simply sat at her table, making sure the house was clean. After all, you never know when Zeus could stop by. She hummed a spring song to herself as she wiped off the table. \"Perfect. Now, where is my little boy Hermes?\" As if answering her call, Hermes walked into the house at that very moment. Maia ran to him and scooped him up into her arms. \"My baby! You were out so long in the rain! What were you doing out in the fields?\" \"Nothing.\" Lied the young boy. \"What's for dinner, mom?\" \"Always eating, you're going to be a big strong man someday.\" She gently kissed his nose. \"I have some bread in the cupboard. Do you want me to put some cheese on it?\" \"Yes please!\" Hermes sat down at the table, wide youthful eyes glowing at his mother. He loved her dearly, even if she was very naive. Just then, there was a knock at the door. \"I'll get it, dear!\" Maia rushed to open the door, hoping to see Zeus. Instead, she saw a very wet and angry Apollo, clothes dripping and hair in his face. She frowned. \"You're not here from Zeus, are you?\" \"No,\" growled Apollo. \"I am not here from MY father.\" \"Okay. Do you want to take a message from me to Zeus?\" \"No.\" \"Maybe some fruit?\" \"Look nymph,\" yelled Apollo, dangerously close to losing his temper. \"I am NOT here for Zeus, okay? I am here for your son.\" \"My son? Does Zeus want to see him?\" \"UGH!\" Apollo pushed past Maia into the kitchen, where Hermes was trying to hide, look innocent, and look smug all at the same time. \"OKAY, YOU LITTLE THIEF! I WANT TO KNOW WHERE MY COWS ARE, AND I WANT TO KNOW NOW!\" \"I don't know what you're talking about,\" Hermes replied, ignoring the angry sun god's eyes. Maia looked shocked. \"My son couldn't have taken your cows, he's barely a day old.\" \"And he's walking! Is stealing too far off?\" Apollo looked deep into the kid's eyes, looking for some acknowledgement or at least some guilt. But there was none. Apollo threw his hands up in anger. \"I HATE THIS! MY WEEK SUCKS AND NOW MY COWS ARE IN THE HANDS OF A BABY!\" He grabbed Hermes by his small tunic collar. \"Look, kid, if you don't take me to my cows right now, I'm going to make you wish you were dead.\" \"Then I'll tell dad.\" The child responded haughtily. Apollo grinned slightly. \"DAD doesn't look kindly on thieves.\" Apollo gave Hermes his most dangerous look. The child sighed. \"Fine, they're out in the fields. But I like the cows, I want to keep them!\" Hermes whined. \"So? They're my cows, I bought them fair and square.\" Apollo dropped the kid and went to the door. \"Wait!\" Yelled Hermes. \"What?\" \"What if we do a trade? I got something I think you'll like a lot better.\" Hermes smirked at the older god, who turned away from the door. \"Oh really? And what is this thing?\" Apollo asked. Hermes ran out of the room and grabbed a small tortoiseshell with sinew strings attached to it. \"I made this yesterday. If you do this,\" He pulled one of the strings, \"It makes a pretty noise.\" Apollo smiled and relaxed. Something about the sound made him so...happy. \"Let me try it!\" Apollo grabbed the shell and began to strum. The music sounded beautiful, the best he'd ever heard. And just like that, the sun god was in love. \"I'll take it!\" \"Great!\" Hermes flung his arms around his half-brother. \"I'm sure you'll make good use out of it.\" \"Oh, I'm so glad you're getting along!\" Maia squealed. \"I'll make you both some cheese bread!\" Apollo smiled as he glanced down at his newfound friend and his new love. Maybe this week wasn't so bad after all.",

    "text": "It was just an ordinary day for king Midas, he woke up in his golden bed under his golden sheets and he tried not to touch anything. When he asked the god of wine, Dionysus, the power to turn everything he touched into gold, his life changed dramatically. He couldn't eat anything, he couldn't grab anything, he wasn't able to do anything because he would accidentally turn it into gold. After his servants fed him, a man came into his home. He told king Midas about a woman who lived on the top of a mountain, a group of men climbed the mountain a few days back, but only one returned. That one man told about Medusa, the woman on the mountain, told terrifying things, he said that she had snakes on her head instead of hair and if she looked you in your eyes, you'd turn into stone. \"Would you climb the mountain to kill this evil woman?\" the stranger asked \"Well, I don't know if I can, ever since my wish came true I've been useless\" \"Your talent makes you the most perfect man in Greece to do the job! You can just climb the mountain with you eyes closed and touch her! She'd turn into gold and the problem would be solved!\" \"You do make a great point there, my friend. I'll take this challenge! What do I have to lose?\" And so king Midas started his journey, he took his most loyal servants, Atalo, with him and began his quest. Atalo fed king Midas when he was hungry and after one day and one night they were close to the top of the mountain. \"You should go back now\" king Midas ordered Atalo. \"But I can't leave you now! If I go back, who will feed you after you killed Medusa?\" \"I'm not sure if I can kill her, I am king in a city of peace, I've never killed anyone! That's why I want you to go back, there is a big chance that I won't make it, but that does not mean that you have to go down with me!\" \"But I can't leave you now, if I go back you'll certainly die!\" \"Then I will.\" \"Please come back with me! We could say that Medusa send us back as a warning, that she doesn't want anybody to climb the mountain ever again and she just wants to be left alone!\" \"What kind of life would that be? I don't want to live this life anymore! I need your help for everything!\" \"But I love helping you! I... I love you.\" King Midas was stunned by this statement, he didn't know what to say. He never expected this! How could he? He never thought about Atalo in that way, he was just his servant, his friend maybe, but nothing more! After a nerve-wracking moment king Midas broke the silence \"I'm sorry but I don't share your feelings, I'm afraid that I just don't feel about you in that way. I am more like Zeus than Apollo when it comes to romantic love, and you know as well as I do that I'm not like Zeus at all. I don't know if I'm making sense here, I really hope that I am because I wouldn't want to hurt you in any way!\" While king Midas spoke, the mind of Atalo drove off more and more. He couldn't handle the refusal of his first and only love! Tears appeared in the corners of his eyes, Atalo didn't want king Midas to see him like this so he ran away and kept running. King Midas tried to follow him, but couldn't run as fast as his servant. King Midas was just about to give up the chase when he heard a horrifying scream. Midas followed the sound and found Atalo, lying on the hard, dry ground. He was bitten by a poisonous snake and the venom was slowly making way through his body. Midas could was clearly see the pain in his face when he cried out \"Midas please, please make the pain stop, touch me and turn me into gold. I'd rather have a quick death than die from this slow, harsh poison.\" Midas didn't know what to do, he wanted to help Atalo, he really did! But kill him? Midas had never killed anyone on purpose, only before he realized how terrible his 'gift' really was. He saw how badly his friend was acing so he decided that he should help him. When his hand came closer Atalo whispered his last words: \"Midas, I love you.\" Midas meets Medusa Midas sat down next to his golden servant. His loyal servant! He did not love him like a lover, but he certainly loved him as a friend. \"What should I do now?\" Midas wondered. He knew that he had to go on, if he'd go back now, Atalo's death would have been for nothing. Midas didn't want anyone to find Atalo's golden body and sell it. As a last goodbye he kissed his friends forehead, he could finally touch him now, and buried him beneath the biggest tree on the mountain so he could return there and pay his respects later. Midas placed a few flowers he found nearby top of the loosened earth and continued his journey. Medusa had already seen Midas climbing. She knew what his mission was, but she'd fallen in love with him the moment she saw him. In Midas she saw a companion, she turns people into stone when they look at her, he turns people into gold when he touches them. Medusa was sure that Midas would understand her and maybe even return her quickly enlightened love. When Medusa saw Atalo's confession to Midas, she didn't like it at all! Midas would be hers and no servant would keep him away from her! In a jealous rage she send a poisonous snake to kill Atalo, she was the one who killed him. Our beloved king was almost on top on the mountain, almost by his target; Medusa. He closed his eyes because he knew she'd turn him into stone otherwise and continued walking with his hands before his body so he could feel the trees in front of him. Suddenly he heard a lovely but stern voice \"Hello Midas, I've been expecting you.\" it said. Midas was confused, is this the evil woman he was ought to kill? How could this woman, with a voice sweeter than honey and stronger than Hercules, be evil? \"Are you Medusa? The woman with snakes instead of hair who can turn men into stone?\" Midas asked, his eyes still closed.\"Yes I am, are you going to kill me now?\" she replied with a bit of an attitude.\"I am not certain yet, I was told to kill you, but now? To kill a woman with a sweet voice like yours? I don't know.\"\"I must confess something to you\" Medusa said \"I have watched you climb the mountain and I knew what you came for. I have had many chances to kill you but I decided to let you live.\" \"Why would you? If you knew what I was told to do, why let me live?\"With a trembling voice Medusa told him her reason: \"Because I also knew about the wish Dionysus made come true and I knew you might understand me...\" Medusa felt a tear appearing on face and she knew that Midas would be able to hear the hurting in her voice, but she continued talking anyway. He was her last chance! If Midas couldn't understand her, no one could! \"I can't look anyone in the eyes without turning them into stone! I never asked for this! I only am like this because I made Athena angry once, and now! Now I am a monster!\" The tears flooded Medusa's face by now, she completely broke down. Midas, who listened to what she told, couldn't help her. He couldn't touch her for comfort because she'd turn into gold. He didn't know what to do, the only thing he knew is that he wouldn't kill this woman, this poor, poor woman. Midas and Medusa have a difficult talk It had been a month since Midas met Medusa on top of the mountain, he'd stayed with her after their first conversation. It hadn't been easy, Midas had to keep his eyes closed constantly and Medusa had to watch out that he wouldn't walk into anything, especially not into her! But together they made it work, they'd build a home and lived happily together. Midas even started to have feelings for this woman, this sad woman who no one could ever love. But then, who could love him? He couldn't even give a kiss! He was curious about the looks of this woman, he'd heard that she was disgusting, with snakes instead of hear and nothing but hardness in her face, but how bad could it be? He knew Medusa as a kind woman who had a lovingly voice, she couldn't be that horrifying! Still deep in thoughts, he heard Medusa coming. \"May I see you?\" He asked \"I'd love for you to see me, but you'd turn into stone!\" \"I think that I'd only turn into stone if I'd look you into your eyes, so if you'd close your eyes I could see you!\" \"I guess that you could then... but are you really sure that it works like that? I do not want to lose you!\" \"I've heard stories about a men who saw you and ran, he survived so I believe that it's possible!\" Medusa stayed quiet, like she was thinking about it. After a short amount of time, what seemed like an eternity for Midas, she broke the silence. \"Well, if you're really sure I'll do it.\" she said a bit insecure \"I have my eyes closed, so you can open them now.\" Midas opened his eyes and blinked while they adjusted to the light. Slowly the silhouette of Medusa became visible, he looked at her bare feet and followed her legs up. She was wearing a beautiful white dress that waved in the soft breeze. His look went up even more, towards her face. It wasn't nearly as horrifying as he heard, the snakes on her head were a bit scary of course, but her face was soft and beautiful. Midas had a feeling he never felt before! Was this love? Did he love this strange woman? He slowly walked towards her, closer and closer, he wanted to touch her so bad! His hand reached slowly to her face but just before he could touch her she stepped back. \"Why the hell are you trying to touch me?!\" Medusa yelled \"You know what happens with everything you touch!\" \"I... uhmm, I don't know\" Midas stumbled \"It's just... I haven't been able to touch anyone for so long! And when I saw you... I didn't think about it, it was like my mind just blacked out or something.\" \"I'm sorry that you can't touch anyone, but there is nothing I can do to change it! I know it sucks, but it doesn't make any difference for me. Of course it would be great if we could have a normal relationship but we can't! We can't touch, we can't see each other at the same time, sometimes I wonder why we even try to be together.\" \"I know that I've made a mistake today, but I won't do it again! I've learned from it!\" Midas looked at Medusa's closed eyes and saw a small tear appear \"You know that you can't make that promise, it's just a matter of time before we look at each other or we touch.\" Her voice broke. \"But, but I love you!\" \"You wouldn't love me anymore if you'd know what I did... I am a horrible person! That is why I was cursed! I was horrible before the curse and now, now I'm even worse. If you knew what I did you'd run off as fast as you could.\" \"No, I wouldn't. I love you, I want so stay with you and there is nothing that you can say to change that. There is nothing so bad that I would leave you.\" Medusa sat down with her back against a tree, her knees pulled towards her chin. \"I... I killed the servant boy who was in love with you.\" Midas stood in total shock, his mind couldn't get around the fact that the woman he loved killed his friendly, loyal servant. after a while Medusa pulled her head up, her eyes still closed. \"I'm sorry\" she said with a soft voice. \"YOU'RE SORRY? YOU KILLED MY SERVANT, THE ONLY FRIEND I HAD IN THIS WORLD AND YOU'RE SORRY?! WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?\" Midas screamed. \"I heard how he confessed his love to you, I got so jealous that I send a snake to kill him.\" \"Why would you be jealous? You hadn't even met me!\" his voice sounded a bit less angry. \"I saw you long before you know, thanks to my snakes I know everything that happens on this mountain and I'd been spying on you ever since you started climbing. I heard every word you said, when I learned that you were in a situation like mine I started to have feelings for you. And when Atalo said that he loved you! I just couldn't handle it. Then I...\" Midas interrupted her \"But you must have heard that I told him that I didn't like him in that way!\" \"You did what? But I thought that you liked him back! I saw the way you looked at each other, that isn't the way the soldiers looked at each other when they came to kill me!\" \"That is because he wasn't just my servant, he was my lifelong friend. His father was my fathers first servant and we grew up together. Yes, I loved him, but only as a friend!\" \"I, I.. I am sorry!\" Medusa stuttered, with tears in her eyes she ran away. Aaannnd, the final chapter (See the end of the chapter for notes.) Medusa sat with her back against a tree, not just any tree, the tree under witch Atalo was buried. She could feel the tears streaming over her cheeks who were red from shame. \"Why did I do this? Why did I kill this innocent man?\" Medusa thought to herself \"Because I'm a jealous, judgmental bitch. Oh, I wish that I could just turn back the clock and stop myself from killing him, I've really hurt Midas with this!\" Medusa knew that she would go to the underworld when she'd die for killing this man, but she didn't really care about that. The main thing on her mind was one important question: \"What can I do to make Midas forgive me, if he ever can?\" Medusa had spend a whole day and night crying and thinking about that question. She couldn't think of an answer and she felt even worse about herself than she already did. \"This is enough.\" Medusa though \"I'm just going to have to face Midas about this and beg for his forgiveness, I have to take this chance otherwise I will fade away just like the nymph Echo did after Narcissus didn't return her love.\" When she made up her mind and stood up, she heard a sound behind her. Quickly she turned around, it must be another soldier who came to kill her! When she'd turned she saw who it was, Midas. He'd came to talk to her and to tell her that he would forgive her, but his eyes were open and so were Medusa's. In a quick second they both realized what happened, but before any of them could say a word, Midas was turned into stone with the expression of shock still on his face. Medusa's face who just had dried got wet again with her salty tears when she saw that she turned Midas, her beloved Midas into stone. She completely broke down and fell at his hard, gray feet. Filled with despair she embraced his legs, she did not think about his curse when she slowly stood up and kissed him while taking his hand in hers. She turned into gold. Epilogue Now, after thousands of years and many earthquakes, no one has ever found the statues of Midas and Medusa, one of stone and one of gold. People say that if you walk in the mountains you can still hear Medusa crying over all the things that happened to her and maybe, one day, somebody will find the mountain of Medusa and walks towards the largest tree there and maybe that person will trip and fall over the statues buried in time. When that day comes, we must hope that Midas and Medusa won't get separated and sold but that they get a quiet place where they can be comfortable together until the end of time. You could probably guess the end, but I just really wanted to write this",

      "He'd came to talk to her and to tell her that he would forgive her, but his eyes were open and so were Medusa's.",
      "In a quick second they both realized what happened, but before any of them could say a word, Midas was turned into stone with the expression of shock still on his face.",
      "Medusa's face who just had dried got wet again with her salty tears when she saw that she turned Midas, her beloved Midas into stone.",
      "She completely broke down and fell at his hard, gray feet.",
      "Filled with despair she embraced his legs, she did not think about his curse when she slowly stood up and kissed him while taking his hand in hers.",
      "She turned into gold.",
      "Epilogue Now, after thousands of years and many earthquakes, no one has ever found the statues of Midas and Medusa, one of stone and one of gold.",
      "People say that if you walk in the mountains you can still hear Medusa crying over all the things that happened to her and maybe, one day, somebody will find the mountain of Medusa and walks towards the largest tree there and maybe that person will trip and fall over the statues buried in time.",
      "When that day comes, we must hope that Midas and Medusa won't get separated and sold but that they get a quiet place where they can be comfortable together until the end of time.",
      "You could probably guess the end, but I just really wanted to write this"

    "text": "It was finally over, the Great Prophecy had come to pass and Olympus was saved, but the price that they had been forced to pay was terribly high. So many siblings, cousins and friends had given their lives in the Battle of Manhattan, all the grief when the bodies got recovered, broken, cold and so lifeless. There was no victory without sacrifice. The dream that will come true someday (Becomes) a mere unheard whisper That is lost within the light shone by the night Soon enough, her eyes will open if it is fate At least yes, only now... Those who had survived had returned to the camp after getting healed, well their bodies healed, their souls were another case, those wounds may become scars with time. Upon arrival were most faced with the surprise of seeing Apollo in their midst together with the mortal girl who had been with them in the battle. She was the new Oracle of Delphi. It had been two hours later, the night was slowly nearing, the time they would burn the shrouds of the fallen, hoping that they will have a shift judgment and step into Elysium and even thought some doubted it, others hoped that Lord Hades will stand to his word and let it all pass fast. A lone figure entered the hastily made tent where all the bodies rested while the cabins made some more shrouds for the fallen. He was here to make sure that everything was alright, not that the dead would have anymore needs he could attend to, their wounds didn't hurt them anymore. They were free from the agony piercing the souls of those left behind. I hang my head to the night wind, after said dream I know would never happen The tears the moonlight trickling down from my hands \"What is it that you want?\" My lips uttered in the darkness He walked over to each of the covered, still bodies, lingering only a few seconds more by those hidden by gold, his hand trembling. He had been informed just before retuning to camp that he would be the new Councillor of the Apollo Cabin. On any other day he would have felt touched by the trust of his siblings, but now he felt as if the position would bear a terrible curse. Last year had they lost the most wonderful, kind hearted, considerate and caring brother when they were invaded, some of those attackers now resting here with their family. Then they had lost another brother who had taken the post, he only held it for one year before being crushed by the cement blocks of the fallen bridge, but he didn't feel them, the rocky shore had already broken his body. A sob threatened to escape his lips as he fought the tears which tried to break free, he could not cry in front of the others, they needed him to be strong, but it was so hard. The sound of shifting fabric brought him out of his misery, making him turn around, sky blue eyes falling on the figure dressed in black, so appropriate for those he had come to visit. He looked surprised for a bit, probably not expecting any living being to be here for at least another two hours or so. It took him a few seconds to remember who he was and when he did his presence brought an ironic feeling to him......the child of the Underworld's Lord. He still remembered his arrival when everything seemed lost, the darkness of the Underworld seeming so much more inviting then the darkness Kronos had brought with him, he still remembered seeing him fight, commanding the dead like his father did. Remembered the Dark God's words, that it had been his son who had convinced him to come, to stop further blood shed. A selfish part of him wished that they would have come much sooner, but he pushed those thoughts away, they hadn't needed to come, yet they still did and for that he should be glad. \"I will leave you to saying good bye and come back later.\" it took him a few minutes to register the words and he wanted to say 'yes', but again the part of him which didn't allow him to be selfish had taken hold of him. \"Please stay, you have a right to come here like anyone else.\" he found himself saying while the other only looked at him and he understood, even after his help by the invasion were people wary of him after finding out his heritage so it was understandable that he feels wary around them. He only seemed fine in the presence of Percy and Annabeth sometimes even Thalia if not near the other Hunters when it come to demigods. Eventually he nodded his head and stepped fully inside the tent. The smile that pierced my heart when we met I want to protect it so much, I'm holding onto our fleeting promise Even if I writhe in agony \"I wont take long.\" the son of Hades said in a gentle tone as he approached the first body and gently lifted the shroud from the sickly pale face. \"What are your doing?\" he caught himself asking as he took a step forward the other who had placed his hand on the dead demigod's forehead and let his dark eyes drop. \"I wanted to give them a final blessing, it is one of the ancient rites all children of my father learn, it makes sure that the souls have a safe journey to his realm and a quick, fair judgment.\" Nico explained, even thought his eyes had closed he could feel the other's souls shake a little bit; it was not in fear, but from hope. \"So they will make it to Elysium?\" Will asked hopefully, his family and friends deserved it. \"They all will make it, some are already there and meeting up with old friends.\" Nico said before he switched over to Ancient Greek, his tone sounding like the rustling wind or the soft gliding of feathers. \"Epese o eroas mou apoteros apoteros eulogia, mporei to taxidi tes Ade na phrourountai apo emena kai sas krise bardias kai eulogese ton patera mou sten sphaira\" Will only stood there, the words easy for him to understand; 'Fallen hero receive my blessing, may your journey to Hades be guarded by me and your judgment shift and blessed in my father's realm.' They spread a type of strange warmth through him, his soul which had felt seconds ago as if it would have been frozen to ice, he watched as two drachma appeared on the fallen demigods eyes, even thought there was already one placed under the tongue, but he was sure that this would ensure the journey even more. He watched Nico repeat the same words by each of the fallen demigods no matter on which side they had stood in the war, in the end had they all fought for something they believed in......they fought for their parents, to be recogrinaised as worth existing. \"Thank you, for doing this for them.\" he found himself saying in a soft tone, as if all those around them would only merely be sleeping and not be already gone. \"As the last child of my father is it my duty to help the dead.\" he said and Will suddenly felt a pang in his heart, remembering that the other had lost his only sister on the quest to save both Annabeth and Will's aunt Lady Artemis. He felt a bitter taste in his mouth, the loss of his siblings was painful, but at least he still had a good deal of them, but the other had no one left and from his tone as he said that he was 'his father's only child' had he understood the hidden message, the King of the Dead would stay by the oath made so long ago. \"You should go back to your cabin, it will maybe help you.\" the sentence surprised him. \"What?\" he did not exactly understand what the other meant. \"As a child of Hades, I can feel when a living soul passes, even more if I knew them, but I also can feel the souls of the living and yours is trembling from pain, the tremors getting stronger the more you are in here.\" he answered back and he found himself shaking his head, his hand resting on the golden shroud covering the body beside him. \"I...I can't leave them now.\" he said finally, his voice sounding broken and hollow to his ears. \"If I would be a better healer like Lee had been I may have been able to save them, if I would have made it to them in time, showed a better skill in diagnosing what is wrong...then...then maybe they would still live.\" he said, the tears stubbornly fighting to be let free. Just being able to be close to you Just being able to spend the same time with you Would bring up distant memories, even if you can cure my sadness from it As my thoughts keep on revolving Wondering if we will ever come to a peaceful end This frequently-asked question dances up the heavens And in the dawn sky it changes into light Will almost jumped in fright when a cold hand, -almost as cold like the hands of those laying under the shrouds-, gently whipped away the tears which had finally broken free. He felt ashamed for crying, for acting so weak in front of a person he barely knew from sight only, but no matter how icy the touch was the gentleness and slight awkwardness made him lean into it. \"It is alright, allow your soul to lose some of it's burden, after that it will get better.\" Nico said gently, he had never been good with living things, he was never sure what to do, but if he only concentrated on the soul of a person, and channelled a bit of his cousin Percy was he doing fine, but he didn't expect that only a few seconds later he would hold the crying son of Apollo in his arms. \"Ca...can I...can we sta...stay like this...for a little while.\" he heard he broken voce ask and he found himself nodding as he concentrated on the trembling soul which's soft light was flickering like a candle's flame in the wind. \"Yes, we can stay.\" Nico replied gently, the other souls did not near this place of silent solitude, but he could feel their grief though he said nothing more, only held the other in his arms, allowing the calm silence to surround them, enjoying the few minutes of peace they had before the pain will return in a new war. Everything is an illusion, they go as soon as they appear My fingers that swept away evil thoughts are entwined with a colourless chain Knitting solitude all over me, I can only wriggle inside it My heels are like cutting through the wind It is too cold right now \"That's because of you\" I can't let go of those words that had fallen into the darkness It had taken him some time and some wrong turns, but he had finally found the Temple of Pluto decorated by bleached bones and he was sure that he saw diamonds on the roof, probably Hazel. He really liked the girl and was glad that Nico had finally a sister again with whom he could talk, but Hazel was at the moment busy introducing a half-to-death-scarred Frank to her father. He didn't blame the guy to be scarred by the look he was currently receiving, but he also noted the worry both father and daughter held in their eyes. Both of them were terribly worried about him. Just to be breathing Just to feel the same pain Little by little, I have come to realise About this love that can gather happiness Because in those frozen eyes that is resting on my shoulders I have found the one I want to protect At the next dawn, the fragment that has rusted to regret in my hands It changes into light Walking into the temple he saw him, sitting beside the altar on which roses with the colour of blood rested. His eyes were closed, but his breathing told him that he was still wide awake. \"Nico.\" he called gently, flinching when he saw the echo of hollowness in those dark eyes, a memory of the terrors he had faced alone in Tartaros in his search for the Doors of Death. He was so frustrated, why did he need to do this? Why had he again gone to do some stupid investigation which had asked for such a high price? He wanted to yell at him, demand answers, but he knew that without Nico, they would have lost, just like in the last war when he made Percy take up the Curse of Achilles. He hoped that Lord Hades, no all of the gods could see how much this demigod had done to contribute the success of both wars; he certainly deserved the title Hero of Olympus. \"Your soul is trembling again from pain.\" he heard Nico whisper as he touched his tear smeared cheek again, when had he reached the other? \"And it is your fault.\" Will broke out as he went to his knees and wrapped his arms around the fragile body; he was way to thin to be healthy, but still, there was some strength as he hugged him back and just like the first time they had talked to each other had he found himself crying in the others arms. In a place surrounded by death... Just to feel your touch, just to think of the joy that brings It's welling up inside Even despite a brief parting it's turning into a bond that will never disappear He did not know how long they had stayed like this, the sweet sound of music and laughter still drifted into the dark temple, being the only noise breaking the silence since his sobs had ceased, but then Nico spoke up, lifting his face to look at him. \"I don't like it when your soul trembles from grief\" he spoke in a gentle tone and for a few short seconds Will was sure that the echo of hollowness become much fainter. \"Your soul shines too bright, it carries so much warmth in it to waver and dim like that.\" even if he would have tried to, he would not have been able to hide the blush which had formed itself on his cheeks by he compliment he received before remembering his father telling him that Tartaros was always surrounded in endless darkness which freezes the soul of anyone daring to enter it. Should he dare it? He was not sure, but he wanted to help Nico deal with his pain, just like he had helped him back then. \"Then I swear on the River Styx to never again let my soul waver in pain, for I will be your light and warmth.\" the words had come easier to him then he had hoped they would and that was good like this then no more words got spoken as Nico's cold lips found his warm ones in a kiss filled with so much desperate need which he returned with gentle promises. A child of the Underworld and a child of the Sun, maybe this match had been set by the Fates themselves, for light and darkness had always shared a strong bond with another for it had been the Darkness which had sired Daylight with Night and neither had ever been without being accompanied by their counterpart. Just being able to be close to you Just being able to spend the same time with you Would bring up distant memories, even if you can cure my sadness from it If we are still led by these etched symbols And fall to it The moment we meet again shall bypass the memories of a thousand years And changes into light Owari",

    "text": "Cold, bluish light filtered in through the half-shut curtains, slowly dragging Persephone from sleep. It was what passed for dawn in the underworld, and, like many things in her new home, it had quickly gone from strange and alien to comforting. She let out a sleepy sigh and turned over so she could curl up behind Hades, who was still snoring lightly. Persephone squirmed closer, slinging an arm and a leg over his body to better press her naked front to the warm skin of his back and her face into the curve of his neck. His fine black hair smelled faintly of asphodel blossoms, and she huffed out a laugh at the memory of his slightly-constipated expression when she'd placed the flower crown on his head the day before. \"It's unkind to laugh at your husband,\" he mumbled, his already deep voice further roughened by sleep. Persephone grinned and laid a soft kiss on his shoulder. \"I'll try to remember that,\" she said. She wormed her other leg between his shins, effectively trapping his leg between both of hers, and arched against him. \"Can I make it up to you?\" she whispered, leaning in to suck his earlobe between her teeth. Hades let out a shuddering sigh as her breath stirred the hairs at the nape of his neck. \"Always bargaining with me,\" he complained, but she could hear the want in his voice. More than that, she could feel the muscles of his stomach tensing as she trailed her fingers downward into the trail of wiry hair. Persephone wrapped her hand around his cock, which was already thickening. \"I wouldn't want you to go soft on me,\" she said, punctuating her words with a gentle squeeze. \"That is not a problem,\" he said, voice shaky, as he jerked forward slightly and thrust into her hand. She grinned possessively into his neck and stroked him, savoring the way the he filled out and stiffened in response to her touch. He tried to keep quiet, but wasn't quite able to stop his low moan when she twisted her wrist just right on the upstroke. After a few moments of teasing, she released his cock and unwound her leg from his. Hades immediately turned over and pinned her beneath his weight, then leaned in. He hungrily devoured her mouth, his lips soft but insistent and tasting of ambrosia and the sweet-tart hint of pomegranate. Persephone moaned and buried her fingers in the messy spill of his black hair, arching up when he began mouthing at her neck. \"Hades, Hades, Hades,\" she chanted, her higher brain functions shorting out at the feel of her husband's teeth on her pulse point. His laugh vibrated through his chest and into hers, and dragged her out of her lust-fueled daze. She smacked him lightly on his shoulder. \"Someone once told me it was unkind to laugh at one's spouse,\" she scolded, causing him to look up and meet her gaze. A small smile danced about his lips, grey-blue eyes sparkling with mirth, and Persephone felt her chest tighten at the sight. After all they'd been through--all she'd put them through--to be able to still have this was a miracle she would not squander. Hades seemed to sense something had changed, and his expression quickly went flat. \"Don't you dare,\" she whispered, voice fierce. That shocked him into stillness, and before he could recover, she pushed him onto his back and straddled his hips. \"I can read you like a scroll, Hades,\" she said, planting one hand on his shoulder to brace herself while she wrapped the other around his cock. His breath hitched and he grabbed reflexively at her, his fingers digging into the soft curves of her hips. Persephone let her eyes flutter closed as she lowered herself onto him, canting her hips slightly to better the angle, until her thighs met his and he was fully sheathed inside her. She let out a long, shuddery breath and sat up straight, letting herself adjust to the feeling of fullness. Hades' cock was long but slender, with an upward curve near the tip that rubbed the perfect spot inside her with each thrust. She pulled her bottom lip between her teeth and rolled her hips, drawing a groan from her husband as her inner walls fluttered and her ample breasts bounced. \"Good?\" she asked. \"Very,\" he breathed, his fingers tightening around her hips. Her grin turned wicked and she raised herself up on her knees until just the head was still inside her. \"Good,\" she repeated, satisfaction thick in her voice, then sunk back down, pulling a ragged groan from Hades. She began to ride him, slowly at first, then speeding up as she found a rhythm, which stuttered when his hands migrated up from her waist to knead at her breasts, pinching and rolling her nipples between his fingers. Persephone leaned forward and clutched at his shoulders for support. He laughed and leaned up to capture her mouth in a kiss, threading his fingers through her hair to keep her from sitting back up. \"Beautiful,\" he whispered, his breath warm against her lips, \"so beautiful.\" Persephone sucked in a harsh breath before pressing her mouth to his forcefully, determined to show him how beautiful he was. She sucked his lower lip in between her teeth as she rolled her hips, her clit rubbing deliciously against the rough curls that grew at the base of his cock. She repeated the motion, then again and again, sending jolt after jolt of pleasure through her body. One of Hades' hands cupped her head while the other skated down her back to trace the curve of her ass, holding her lightly as she rutted against him, face pressed into the curve of his shoulder. \"Oh, oh, oh,\" she panted, her orgasm building low in her belly. When she came, it was with a groan of Hades' name and the taste of his skin on her tongue. She slumped into him, savoring the feel of her cunt spasming around his still-hard cock. \"Good Zeus,\" she muttered absently. Hades growled, then flipped her onto her back and sheathed himself back inside her in one smooth movement. \"Don't call on my brother when you're in my bed,\" he hissed, punctuating his order with a punishing thrust. Persephone whimpered and spread her thighs wider to accommodate him, fingers scrabbling for purchase on his sweat-slick shoulders as he caged her with his arms. \"Only you,\" she promised, wrapping her legs around his hips as he fucked into her. \"Only you,\" she repeated, canting her hips up until his cock rubbed her g-spot just right, and she hissed in pleasure. \"Oh, yes, there!\" He leaned in and bit at her neck, sucking a bruise into her skin. \"Mine,\" he growled, soothing the hurt with long swipes of his tongue, and the possessive note in his voice was enough to tip her over the edge. She came hard, arching against him and digging her fingernails into his biceps, and he followed soon after, her name a soft benediction on his lips. She caught her breath first, untangling her legs from him and stroking his hair. He tried to move, but she held him close, enjoying the press of his body on her. \"Well that was new,\" she said finally, grinning against his temple. He propped himself up on his forearms, taking the majority of his weight off of her. His softening cock slid free of her body, and she whined pathetically at the sudden emptiness. \"Did I hurt you?\" he asked, dark brow furrowed with concern, eyes tracking down her body to look for any signs of distress. \"Definitely not,\" Persephone said, leaning up to kiss him. She winced as the motion tightened the muscles under the blossoming bruise on her neck. Before Hades could say anything, she pressed a finger to his mouth. \"Okay, you did a little. But I liked it, so you can just stop brooding before you even start.\" She pressed a kiss to his lips. \"Got it?\" He finally smiled, and returned her kiss softly. \"I've got it.\" \"Good,\" she said, after a long, lazy kiss. \"Now, either let me up, or let Thanatos know we'll be pushing petitioners' hours back.\" Hades grinned down at her. \"The dead aren't exactly going anywhere,\" he said, and moved in to kiss her again.",
