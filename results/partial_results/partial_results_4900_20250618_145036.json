    "text": "Ben felt like he'd been breathing dust for days and wondered if he'd end up with a cough as bad as Dan's boy. The drought didn't look like it'd be letting up any time soon and that meant he was spending more time in Milliways as there wasn't much cause for him to be riding out if he didn't have to. As Demeter sat down, he raised his mint julep to her and smiled, \"You look like a proper summer should, Miss Demeter.\" She laughed and he felt refreshed in a way beyond what was in his drink and said, \"It's good to see you though you look dry. Is there trouble in your land?\" \"Now, you know I'm not the sort to own land,\" His voice twisted on the truth as he's seen how the drought has been making William Evans drawn and tired like his father was before him. He'd seen Dan drinking and heard the tapping of his leg every time William comes in but William hasn't asked for help, Ben'd be surprised if he did. Demeter's cool hand on his stirs him from his thoughts as she says quietly, \"What can I do?\" \"Can you make it rain?\" She went silent then answered in a voice rich with power, \"I can wet and heal the land. Show me.\" He'd meant to stop and finish his drink but he didn't want to resist the pull of her and he stood up, taking her hand and leading her out the door. Gabriel waited and Demeter sat beside him as they cut across the dry land towards the far edge of the Evans' land. It didn't feel right to speak, the air around them felt empty but as they passed, Ben could almost swear he tasted rain. When they arrived at the right place, she dismounted and pulled him to stand beside her as she knelt, her hands and feet holding the dry dirt. There wasn't a prayer he knew that would sound right, but Ben knew he was meant to do something, he'd asked and gods should be honored. Though he'd never expected a god who made love with joy and left summer behind her and began to recite from the Psalms, \"Who covereth the heaven with clouds, who prepareth rain for the earth, who maketh grass to grow upon the mountains.\" Demeter laughed and the promise of rain became truth as the ground seemed to breathe as the skies slowly darkened. In the lightly falling rain, he found it hard to see Demeter, she was a thing of green and life before kissing him and whispering, \"I won't tell.\" \"Tell what?\" \"That you prayed for another, my cowboy hero. Now come with me before I get too much mud on your nice suit.\" \"You can get all the mud you want on me, darlin',\" He held her close as her dress outlined her body and he knew, he was just keeping his word, it didn't help him any if folks were poor. Though in the newly falling rain with a goddess in his arms, it felt like being her kind of hero woudn't be too bad a thing.",

Sallie is smiling and nodding to everyone they meet and her gaze never seems to settle on anything for too long. Around them is a swirl of languages and people, here they're two women, who might catch someone's gaze for their happiness.

The world is measured in families and families keep pouring out to be kissed by Madame Demeter, who brings joy and life alongside her.

Hours later when there's been food with names that make even Sallie's tongue twist and ouzo and retsina and plates breaking, there's a silence of promise as they speak of the lights coming. The children who are still awake are carried to the church to carry their candle so it may be lit from the light of Jerusalem. Demeter stays beside them and loops her arm with Sallie's, it isn't quite the way of celebrating for either of them, yet for tonight, they'll walk with the lights down Paris streets.",

    "text": "~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Iphigenia did not struggle as they led her to the altar. She walked barefoot on the fine sand past the black ships tilted on the beach. Their sails hung flat in the still air. Dry eyed, she looked at her father and failed to forgive him really loudly. She climbed of her own volition onto the altar draped with the skins of wild animals dedicated to Artemis, mistress of sacrifices. They bound her with red ropes. They did not need to. She said so. \"I will not struggle.\" As they turned from her, she whispered to the clouded ceiling of sky, \"Artemis of the open countryside, I long to run with you in the deep forests and gaze into the light of your eyes. Blessed would I be if you took me up as one of your maidens.\" She sighed. \"But I would so completely die for you.\" Achilles, to whom she'd been promised as a bride, stood aside at her request. He'd put on this simply luscious, Ionic style, black linen, chiton with a dazzling high silver girdle in her honor. Agamemnon held the long knife out to be blessed. He raised it up and spoke the words to appease crazy ass Artemis that their black ships might sail to Troy and sack the Hades out of the place. Clytemnestra exploded in screams and struggled to be free of the warriors that held her. A great black shadow passed through the grey clouds over them. A beam of white light seared the altar and they held up their hands against the blaze. When they looked back, Iphigenia was gone. Clytemnestra wept. \"Thank the gods. Thank the gods. Thank the gods.\" Agamemnon turned to Calchas. \"Does that mean the curse is lifted?\" They had time for no more words as animal killing Artemis appeared with a doe lightly draped over one shoulder. She looked at the empty altar and asked in a voice like falling stars, \"Where is Iphigenia?\" Clytemnestra pulled away from the now slack hands of the men around her. She walked with purpose to the slim goddess, whose shadow crossed them all, and said, \"Did you not just snatch her up from death?\" Artemis flung the doe upon the altar with a blow that cracked the hasty wood. She glared up at the sky with narrowed silver eyes. She said in the voice of cold dark spaces, \"That was not me.\" She was gone in a rush of wind that puffed the black sails of the black ships. The warriors on the beach cheered. Agamemnon turned to his wife and said, \"So, uh, we all good? Not like Iffy died or anything.\" Clytemnestra looked straight ahead as he kissed her cheek and said a very loud nothing. She turned to Achilles, in his simple yet stunning robes. \"Will you go find my daughter?\" Achilles looked up at the sky where vast shadows moved over the clouds. He gripped his spear and for the first time that afternoon, he smiled. \"A daring quest. Sounds irresistible.\" ~~~~~~~~~~~~~ \"So... your plan is to wait to be rescued by the gods,\" said Penelope. \"You do realize there's a fifty to eighty percent chance we'll just be turned into shrubs.\" When she put it like that, Iphigenia was a little less sure of her plan, but still she felt it necessary to protest. \"Artemis protects maidens who dedicate themselves completely to her.\" Penelope gave her a look to indicate what she thought of that. She resumed her examination of the crystals embedded in the door mechanism that slid open and closed for their captors with a touch. She said to Circe, who was doing much the same, \"Are you sure there's nothing you can do about the door?\" Circe lightly caressed a green crystal with her index finger. \"I cannot work magic with a sow's ear.\" She laughed to herself and touched a purple crystal. \"Actually I can, because I am that brilliant, but,\" she examined the perfectly smooth metal wall, \"I have no idea what magic this is.\" She tapped her pinkie against her teeth. She called out to the other women in the room. \"When the white beam took you, I don't suppose anyone was about to sacrifice a small black goat, because that would be so incredibly useful right now.\" Helen sighed and tugged at her tangled hair and somehow managed to look perfect. \"I was at my bath.\" She flicked away a single perfect tear that became a pearl as it hit the metal floor. \"I was completely naked. All naked and hot and wet in my bath.\" She brushed her hand down the soft robe that Circe had conjured for her from a feather. \"Our captors probed me all over.\" Her hand slid farther down. \"Twice. I wanted to be sure that they found what they were looking for.\" She stretched out slowly. Iphigenia glared at her aunt, Helen, who didn't notice. There were several grumbles from the women of the room of, \"You told us, Helen.\" And at least one comment of, \"I didn't get probed. They just waved a light over me.\" Penthesilea ignored all this by being asleep. She leaned against the far wall of the room with her eyes closed and her hand firm upon her axe, which was a noble weapon and not to be used for hacking at a metal wall. She'd said earlier, \"Wake me when there's something to kill.\" The room in which they were held shuddered. Penthesilea woke up. \"I can hear the arrows of Artemis and Apollo as they batter at the shields of our enemy.\" She tapped the butt of her axe lightly against the wall. Iphigenia couldn't hear anything, but if an Amazon could, she wasn't going to argue. She swallowed and said to Penelope and Circe, \"I was supposed to be a sacrifice to Artemis. Do you think it would help if,\" she trailed off. Penelope put her hands on her hips. \"Oh, for the love of... we're not sacrificing anyone.\" Circe clapped her hands. \"But it does give me an idea, which because it's mine, is incredibly clever.\" She winked at Iphigenia and twisted one of her rings off. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Grrblod, the Captain of the Mrrphorpod, wasn't sure when the attack had gone straight to blrr-glob. This was supposed to be a typical campaign on a G class world. True, there hadn't been a lot of time for in depth scouting. To be honest, since the nexus had been charted, they'd been a planet grab race with the Xian Empire. It had started out the same as always. The computers had calculated the most likely dominant Queens within each societal grouping and interphased them up. They were supposed to fly around, a little shock and awe. Boom, they were the new dominant species. The Mrrphorpod shuddered as the female alien in an open silver box pulled by what looked like a domestic animal of burden threw a stick at them with a stringed device. As it struck, the computer monitor displayed a helpful message that indicated that the force of the blow was the equivalent of a 100.3 megaton strike. The Mrrphorpod's shield went down another two percent. The male alien in an open burning gold box threw one of his sticks and Cleegoff, the Weapons Officer, screamed like a gleebling. \"That has the heat energy of a mid-sized star.\" Which since they could all read the large monitor, wasn't exactly new information. The Mrrphrorpod's shields went down another two percent. Cleegoff shot off another laser blast and made a direct hit on the burning alien. Cleegoff shook all four upper limbs. \"Hyah.\" Grrblod waved eyestalks significantly, as the box and its contents were completely unaffected. \"What part of energy signature like a star didn't you understand when you fired an energy weapon at it? And if you hit the other one, it's like hitting a big rock. Don't we have other weapons.\" Grrblod spun his Captain's chair in a full circle, because at least that was some sort of something. Cleegoff tapped some panels disconsolately. The alien in the silver box, unconcerned about flying openly in the vacuum of space, fired another stick. It arced in the non-existent air and bounced off their shields. The monitor chirped that their shields were down another two percent. The alien Queen yelled something at them and shook a limb. Grrblod heard her through the walls, which given there was no sound in space, was just one more wonderful joy in this moment. The second officer, Zravor, who up until that moment Grrblod had been sure had glycol instead of hymolymph for pulmonary fluid, appeared on the bridge looking shaken to his anterior chitin. Zravor gripped the wall as another stick struck the ship. \"Captain, the prisoners have escaped.\" Grrblod gaped at Zravor. \"But that's a triple level containment unit. It's rated to contain up to 3000 marbs of pressure.\" Zravor dripped oil on the floor. \"One of the prisoners, um,\" Zravor clearly didn't want to say what was next. Grrblod waved at the display where aliens were about to breach the hull with tiny thin sticks. \"Spit it out.\" \"One of the prisoners transformed into a very large, very, very, large thing. It just ripped open the doors and started flinging pieces of the ship around.\" Just then the hatch door slid opened and one of the prisoners flipped into the room. The alien female flashed horrible teeth at them and screamed incomprehensibly, which was admittedly typical of a Queen in Grrblod's experience. This Queen spun a metal weapon in her hand, which ordinarily wouldn't have been a problem, but before any of them could raise an energy weapon the Queen had actually cut off Cleegoff's lower anterior arm and held that weapon to Grrblod's thorax still dripping with Cleegoff's hemolymph. The Queen yelled something no one understood. Grrblod twitched a lower limb to turn on the universal translator, but at a movement of the blade decided ignorance was fine. Nebor, the pilot, took the Queen's words to mean, \"Land this Queen cursed ship.\" Cleegoff dripped on a monitor and whispered, \"The entire fleet is under attack. The Crevgrpod is under fire from someone standing on a mountain,\" eyestalks waved in horror, \"throwing energy weapons. This planet isn't rated for energy weapons. And, and, half the fleet has been turned into fruit trees. We're not meant to bear fruit. That's why we're soldiers.\" Grrblod didn't respond. There was large sharp piece of metal pressed to glrb's thorax. Grrblod wasn't going to do anything. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Although, the battle still raged in sky, strong armed Artemis raced to where the black metal ship landed on the island of Lueke. As her great stag pulled her chariot to the shore, Artemis saw Iphigenia, changed into a new form, herding the invaders onto the beach. Artemis called out with a voice like the untamed wild. \"What have you done to her?\" Circe spread her arms wide. \"It's a little something that I've been tinkering with. Iphigenia's part hawk, elephant, camel, and octopus. I call the form,\" she flashed a delighted with herself grin, \"Heceight.\" Penelope snorted. Circe shrank into herself with a stiff jerk. \"Don't judge me with your simple rural aristocratic standards. How must it be to you in your small mind?\" She glared. \"Heceight is the culmination of a life's work.\" She crossed her arms. \"My life's work and I refuse to apologize for my life.\" Penelope spread her fingers wide as if to let criticism flow through her fingers. \"Did the job. I don't care what you call it. Personally, the tusks were a nice touch.\" \"Really,\" a smile spread across Circe's face. \"That's so refreshing.\" She sighed and unfolded her arms, but seemed uncertain what to do with them. \"I'm sorry. I'm just used to more of a, 'oh, no, what have you done,' reaction.\" Artemis waxing bright took a single step towards Iphigenia, who called out from some really hard to determine location, \"Artemis fair, I'm yours entirely.\" Artemis sprang forward with her arms outstretched, \"Oh, Iphigenia.\" They embraced, which since Iphigenia now had eight arms was a lot of embrace. Some sort of kiss happened. In a rush of wind, they were gone. \"Uh,\" said Circe. She called out to the breeze, \"Don't you want me to turn you back.\" She shrugged. \"I guess not.\" Behind them, the metal ship lurched into the air and zig zagged away across the darkening sky. Penelope turned to Penthesilea. \"Weren't you supposed to be watching them?\" Penthesilea sneered at the ship as it disappeared from view. \"They were cowards unworthy of my blade.\" She spat on the ground. Penelope decided that she did not care. She turned back to Circe. \"I could use a woman of your talents in Ithaca.\" \"Well,\" Circe played hard to get for all of not at all, \"I want a tower.\" \"Done.\" Penelope offered Circe her hand to confirm the agreement. It was only later, after Penelope had organized shelter for everyone and set up work details to make sure they would have food and water, that she asked, \"Has anyone seen Helen?\" Circe, who was examining a charming metal box that she'd acquired during her capture, didn't look up. \"No.\" ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Helen lounged on the couch that had been hastily prepared for her on the ship's bridge. Zravor scuttled over and brought her a fresh bowl of ne-ne berries. She smiled like the dawn over the Praxis Nebula, which was actually a metaphor that made no sense, but after the third cycle with her, Grrblod could no longer metaphor clearly. Her soft, \"Thank you,\" made every officer on the bridge squelch in their anterior sacs, which they had grown as a result of her sweet, sweet pheromones. She bit into the fruit and made a noise that caused Vrilliax, the communications officer, to faint dead away, which was fine. Just fine. No one to communicate with anyway. She stretched and they all froze. \"Grrblod, your empire sounds so lovely. And it's ruled by a Queen you say. And she can have as many husbands as she wants. Mmm.\" She licked her lips to wipe up every trace of fruit. \"Yes, My Que... Helen. Um, well, for a relative meaning of husband. Mostly she bites their heads off, you know, after.\" Grrblod trembled a little to think of sweet Helen coming face to face with Queen Zzznud, the Great and Terrible. She inhaled and sighed and moved her foot restlessly on the couch. Grrblod said, \"What is it, Helen? More berries.\" Grrblod snapped limbs frantically. \"More berries for Helen.\" \"No, silly.\" She brushed her fingers over glrb's upper chitin. She leaned close enough to brush her lips against glrb's antennae, which quivered at the smell of her sweet scent glands. \"I want you to probe me again.\" Grrblod whined in terror and joy, and followed Queen Helen from the bridge. She hadn't snapped glrb's head off the first seven times, so the odds were in glrb's favor. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ After a three month journey in which he'd fought three giants, a giant turtle, a sand giant who thought he was a turtle, and had fourteen really lovely encounters with some truly beautiful local heroes, Achilles landed his black ship on the island of Leuke. Circe paused on the beach where she was weaving a ship's sail from flower petals. She yelled out. \"You're a little late. She gestured to the flower vessel in front of her. We're almost done building our ship. I call it a Float.\" She paused at his look. \"Because it's a boat made of flowers.\" At his long pause, she turned her face from him. \"Don't you dare to judge me. I'm with people now who understand my genius and I won't go back to the way it was.\" He ignored her. He was almost done with his quest. \"Where is Iphigenia?\" Penthesilea jumped down lithely from the rose stalk mast. \"Nice dress.\" Achilles smiled back. Her armor was beautifully maintained. Penelope said around the thorn nails in her mouth, \"Nice to see you too.\" Achilles had priorities though. He was not going to go back to Clytemnestra empty handed. \"I must find Iphigenia.\" Circe continued weaving. \"Artemis picked her up months ago. It was a very moving example of love overcoming all odds between a god and a chimera.\" Penelope sighed. \"Didn't give us a ride, of course. Gods!\" Achilles decided, after a really a lovely encounter with Penthesilea over blade maintenance, to continue his quest on the flower ship, which was much more to his liking that a silly black ship anyway. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ The Xian fleet passed the single Zzznud ship fleeing the G class planet in disgrace. The Admiral of the Xian fleet sneered, which since he had no mouth, but a very large head, was more of a telepathic sneering comment of, \"Pathetic.\" His chief science analyst mentaled, \"Admiral, there is a large concentration of pathetic primitives on that sub-continent.\" He mentaled some controls and the monitor rotated a holographic display. The Admiral smiled, but on the inside of his enormous brain, because he had not devolved a mouth. The Zzznud didn't have holograms and that was one of the many reasons that they were clearly an inferior empire. \"Fly in above them. We should give them fair warning.\" He laughed sardonically and the bridge joined in on the mental plane. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Arjuna looked up at the large spinning silver dish that floated over the battlefield. A voice called out from the dish. \"Humans of G54-nb, you have three days to vacate the planet before it is terraformed to support a superior life form, which is us.\" Krishna thoughtfully adjusted the chariot reins. He said, \"Do not yield to unmanliness. It's not your natural look. Shake off faint-heartnedness, scorcher of enemies! Focus on action. In this case, your action should be to strike the blue light with a single arrow.\" Arjuna lifted his bow. A small blue light blurred in a thin line on the rim of the dish as it rapidly spun. Arjuna smiled, pulled back his bow string and let go. It may be generally understood that the Greek gods were arrogant a******s and Artemis was really good at violence. At the dawn of the Trojan War, Iphigenia was prepared to be a willing sacrifice to Arrow Rain Showering Artemis (she's so moon-struck dreamy). Penelope was ready to do the practical thing in Ithaca. Circe had vital experiments to complete. Vital! Penthesilea was just waiting for the war to start. Achilles was looking forward to some lovely encounters with heroes. Helen was taking a hot steamy bath. Which is why the aliens really shouldn't have tried to shock and awe the earthlings by beaming up the Queens and stealing Artemis' sacrifice. Big mistake. Huge really. Or, how Iphigenia escaped certain death and Helen found new opportunities.

      "\"You do realize there's a fifty to eighty percent chance we'll just be turned into shrubs.\"",
      "When she put it like that, Iphigenia was a little less sure of her plan, but still she felt it necessary to protest.",
      "\"Artemis protects maidens who dedicate themselves completely to her.\"",

      "She resumed her examination of the crystals embedded in the door mechanism that slid open and closed for their captors with a touch.",
      "She said to Circe, who was doing much the same, \"Are you sure there's nothing you can do about the door?\" Circe lightly caressed a green crystal with her index finger.",
      "\"I cannot work magic with a sow's ear.\"",
      "She laughed to herself and touched a purple crystal.",
      "\"Actually I can, because I am that brilliant, but,\" she examined the perfectly smooth metal wall, \"I have no idea what magic this is.\"",
      "She tapped her pinkie against her teeth.",
      "She called out to the other women in the room.",
      "\"When the white beam took you, I don't suppose anyone was about to sacrifice a small black goat, because that would be so incredibly useful right now.\"",

      "There were several grumbles from the women of the room of, \"You told us, Helen.\"",
      "And at least one comment of, \"I didn't get probed.",
      "They just waved a light over me.\"",
      "Penthesilea ignored all this by being asleep.",
      "She leaned against the far wall of the room with her eyes closed and her hand firm upon her axe, which was a noble weapon and not to be used for hacking at a metal wall.",

      "The room in which they were held shuddered.",
      "Penthesilea woke up.",
      "\"I can hear the arrows of Artemis and Apollo as they batter at the shields of our enemy.\"",

      "She winked at Iphigenia and twisted one of her rings off.",
      "~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Grrblod, the Captain of the Mrrphorpod, wasn't sure when the attack had gone straight to blrr-glob.",
      "This was supposed to be a typical campaign on a G class world.",
      "True, there hadn't been a lot of time for in depth scouting.",
      "To be honest, since the nexus had been charted, they'd been a planet grab race with the Xian Empire.",
      "It had started out the same as always.",
      "The computers had calculated the most likely dominant Queens within each societal grouping and interphased them up.",
      "They were supposed to fly around, a little shock and awe.",
      "Boom, they were the new dominant species.",
      "The Mrrphorpod shuddered as the female alien in an open silver box pulled by what looked like a domestic animal of burden threw a stick at them with a stringed device.",
      "As it struck, the computer monitor displayed a helpful message that indicated that the force of the blow was the equivalent of a 100.3 megaton strike.",
      "The Mrrphorpod's shield went down another two percent.",
      "The male alien in an open burning gold box threw one of his sticks and Cleegoff, the Weapons Officer, screamed like a gleebling.",
      "\"That has the heat energy of a mid-sized star.\"",
      "Which since they could all read the large monitor, wasn't exactly new information.",
      "The Mrrphrorpod's shields went down another two percent.",
      "Cleegoff shot off another laser blast and made a direct hit on the burning alien.",
      "Cleegoff shook all four upper limbs.",
      "\"Hyah.\"",
      "Grrblod waved eyestalks significantly, as the box and its contents were completely unaffected.",
      "\"What part of energy signature like a star didn't you understand when you fired an energy weapon at it?",
      "And if you hit the other one, it's like hitting a big rock.",
      "Don't we have other weapons.\"",
      "Grrblod spun his Captain's chair in a full circle, because at least that was some sort of something.",
      "Cleegoff tapped some panels disconsolately.",
      "The alien in the silver box, unconcerned about flying openly in the vacuum of space, fired another stick.",
      "It arced in the non-existent air and bounced off their shields.",
      "The monitor chirped that their shields were down another two percent.",
      "The alien Queen yelled something at them and shook a limb.",
      "Grrblod heard her through the walls, which given there was no sound in space, was just one more wonderful joy in this moment.",
      "The second officer, Zravor, who up until that moment Grrblod had been sure had glycol instead of hymolymph for pulmonary fluid, appeared on the bridge looking shaken to his anterior chitin.",
      "Zravor gripped the wall as another stick struck the ship.",
      "\"Captain, the prisoners have escaped.\"",
      "Grrblod gaped at Zravor.",
      "\"But that's a triple level containment unit.",
      "It's rated to contain up to 3000 marbs of pressure.\"",
      "Zravor dripped oil on the floor.",
      "\"One of the prisoners, um,\" Zravor clearly didn't want to say what was next.",
      "Grrblod waved at the display where aliens were about to breach the hull with tiny thin sticks.",
      "\"Spit it out.\"",
      "\"One of the prisoners transformed into a very large, very, very, large thing.",
      "It just ripped open the doors and started flinging pieces of the ship around.\"",
      "Just then the hatch door slid opened and one of the prisoners flipped into the room.",
      "The alien female flashed horrible teeth at them and screamed incomprehensibly, which was admittedly typical of a Queen in Grrblod's experience.",
      "This Queen spun a metal weapon in her hand, which ordinarily wouldn't have been a problem, but before any of them could raise an energy weapon the Queen had actually cut off Cleegoff's lower anterior arm and held that weapon to Grrblod's thorax still dripping with Cleegoff's hemolymph.",
      "The Queen yelled something no one understood.",
      "Grrblod twitched a lower limb to turn on the universal translator, but at a movement of the blade decided ignorance was fine.",
      "Nebor, the pilot, took the Queen's words to mean, \"Land this Queen cursed ship.\"",
      "Cleegoff dripped on a monitor and whispered, \"The entire fleet is under attack.",
      "The Crevgrpod is under fire from someone standing on a mountain,\" eyestalks waved in horror, \"throwing energy weapons.",
      "This planet isn't rated for energy weapons.",
      "And, and, half the fleet has been turned into fruit trees.",
      "We're not meant to bear fruit.",
      "That's why we're soldiers.\"",
      "Grrblod didn't respond.",
      "There was large sharp piece of metal pressed to glrb's thorax.",
      "Grrblod wasn't going to do anything.",
      "~~~~~~~~~~~~~~",
      "Although, the battle still raged in sky, strong armed Artemis raced to where the black metal ship landed on the island of Lueke.",
      "As her great stag pulled her chariot to the shore, Artemis saw Iphigenia, changed into a new form, herding the invaders onto the beach.",
      "Artemis called out with a voice like the untamed wild.",
      "\"What have you done to her?\" Circe spread her arms wide.",
      "\"It's a little something that I've been tinkering with.",
      "Iphigenia's part hawk, elephant, camel, and octopus.",
      "I call the form,\" she flashed a delighted with herself grin, \"Heceight.\"",
      "Penelope snorted.",
      "Circe shrank into herself with a stiff jerk.",
      "\"Don't judge me with your simple rural aristocratic standards.",
      "How must it be to you in your small mind?\"",
      "She glared.",
      "\"Heceight is the culmination of a life's work.\"",
      "She crossed her arms.",
      "\"My life's work and I refuse to apologize for my life.\"",
      "Penelope spread her fingers wide as if to let criticism flow through her fingers.",
      "\"Did the job.",
      "I don't care what you call it.",
      "Personally, the tusks were a nice touch.\"",
      "\"Really,\" a smile spread across Circe's face.",
      "\"That's so refreshing.\"",
      "She sighed and unfolded her arms, but seemed uncertain what to do with them.",
      "\"I'm sorry.",
      "I'm just used to more of a, 'oh, no, what have you done,' reaction.\"",
      "Artemis waxing bright took a single step towards Iphigenia, who called out from some really hard to determine location, \"Artemis fair, I'm yours entirely.\"",
      "Artemis sprang forward with her arms outstretched, \"Oh, Iphigenia.\"",
      "They embraced, which since Iphigenia now had eight arms was a lot of embrace.",
      "Some sort of kiss happened.",
      "In a rush of wind, they were gone.",
      "\"Uh,\" said Circe.",
      "She called out to the breeze, \"Don't you want me to turn you back.\"",
      "She shrugged.",
      "\"I guess not.\"",
      "Behind them, the metal ship lurched into the air and zig zagged away across the darkening sky.",
      "Penelope turned to Penthesilea.",
      "\"Weren't you supposed to be watching them?\"",
      "Penthesilea sneered at the ship as it disappeared from view.",
      "\"They were cowards unworthy of my blade.\"",
      "She spat on the ground.",
      "Penelope decided that she did not care.",
      "She turned back to Circe.",
      "\"I could use a woman of your talents in Ithaca.\"",
      "\"Well,\" Circe played hard to get for all of not at all, \"I want a tower.\"",
      "\"Done.\"",
      "Penelope offered Circe her hand to confirm the agreement.",
      "It was only later, after Penelope had organized shelter for everyone and set up work details to make sure they would have food and water, that she asked, \"Has anyone seen Helen?\" Circe, who was examining a charming metal box that she'd acquired during her capture, didn't look up.",
      "\"No.\"",
      "~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Helen lounged on the couch that had been hastily prepared for her on the ship's bridge.",
      "Zravor scuttled over and brought her a fresh bowl of ne-ne berries.",
      "She smiled like the dawn over the Praxis Nebula, which was actually a metaphor that made no sense, but after the third cycle with her, Grrblod could no longer metaphor clearly.",
      "Her soft, \"Thank you,\" made every officer on the bridge squelch in their anterior sacs, which they had grown as a result of her sweet, sweet pheromones.",
      "She bit into the fruit and made a noise that caused Vrilliax, the communications officer, to faint dead away, which was fine.",
      "Just fine.",
      "No one to communicate with anyway.",
      "She stretched and they all froze.",
      "\"Grrblod, your empire sounds so lovely.",
      "And it's ruled by a Queen you say.",
      "And she can have as many husbands as she wants.",
      "Mmm.\"",
      "She licked her lips to wipe up every trace of fruit.",
      "\"Yes, My Que... Helen.",
      "Um, well, for a relative meaning of husband.",
      "Mostly she bites their heads off, you know, after.\"",
      "Grrblod trembled a little to think of sweet Helen coming face to face with Queen Zzznud, the Great and Terrible.",
      "She inhaled and sighed and moved her foot restlessly on the couch.",
      "Grrblod said, \"What is it, Helen?",
      "More berries.\"",
      "Grrblod snapped limbs frantically.",
      "\"More berries for Helen.\"",
      "\"No, silly.\"",
      "She brushed her fingers over glrb's upper chitin.",
      "She leaned close enough to brush her lips against glrb's antennae, which quivered at the smell of her sweet scent glands.",
      "\"I want you to probe me again.\"",
      "Grrblod whined in terror and joy, and followed Queen Helen from the bridge.",
      "She hadn't snapped glrb's head off the first seven times, so the odds were in glrb's favor.",
      "~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ After a three month journey in which he'd fought three giants, a giant turtle, a sand giant who thought he was a turtle, and had fourteen really lovely encounters with some truly beautiful local heroes, Achilles landed his black ship on the island of Leuke.",
      "Circe paused on the beach where she was weaving a ship's sail from flower petals.",
      "She yelled out.",
      "\"You're a little late.",
      "She gestured to the flower vessel in front of her.",
      "We're almost done building our ship.",
      "I call it a Float.\"",
      "She paused at his look.",
      "\"Because it's a boat made of flowers.\"",

    "text": "From the moment she picked up her hairbrush, Susan knew it was going to be one of Those Days. They'd reached a truce, she and her hair: it allowed her to go through the motions of putting it up, and she didn't bother with the pretense of hairpins. Occasionally it would stick up little tufts in protest if she tugged too hard, but on the whole the arrangement worked out well for all parties concerned. Or so she'd thought. At the moment, it refused any attempts at taming, coiling out from her head in loosely twined strands like a nest of snakes. Eventually, Susan gave up the struggle. She was going to be late for work. Willing herself not to check over her shoulder for a garrulous raven or a rat skeleton in funereal garb, she gripped the door handle in firm defiance of the voice (or Voice) at the back of her head reminding her that the odds and ends of the material, mortal world were more removed from true reality than certain things she did not have the patience to deal with at the moment, and walked out onto the streets of Ankh-Morpork. Her students were disappointed to have their scheduled field trip to ancient Ephebe canceled on such short notice, though she mollified them somewhat by reading descriptions of the Tsortean War's bloodiest battles. Unfortunately, no such relief was available to her. Stopping by her favorite used book shop was too much of a risk under present circumstances; Az was a dear, but his shadow had a tendency to sport wings, particularly when his friend with the sustained lisp paid a visit. And a drink at Biers was right out. So while she was already in a dark mood when someone - or something - came up behind her, pinned her arms, and hustled her into an alley, a part of her was almost relieved to finally be getting on with it, whatever it was. She still refused to pay any heed to the other, smaller part that found the whole thing exciting. \"Don't turn around,\" her assailant ordered gruffly, in a voice Susan was barely able to identify as female. \"I'll need to see your Thieves' Guild card at least,\" she replied, keeping her calm. \"We're not thieves,\" said a second voice, this one quieter and more musical. \"In fact, we need you to take something from us.\" She placed no special emphasis on the words, but they nonetheless carried a certain resonance that made Susan tense. \"I think you have me mistaken for someone else.\" The strong one refused to relent. \"You are the Duchess Susan Sto Helit, granddaughter of Death?\" Susan was about to object that at the moment, she was only Miss Susan, schoolteacher, and liked it that way, when she felt the weight of something dragging her hand down. She glanced down and let out an aggrieved sigh to find herself holding a familiar sword, with an edge so sharp it glowed blue. \"Apparently.\" In the flat portion of the blade, she could make out her petitioners. They went robed from head to toe, but from the few visible patches of gray-green skin and writhing movements under the hood, she began to grasp their reluctance to be seen. It took her a moment to realize the one holding her was speaking, and a moment more to realize the grip had been relaxed enough that she could run if she chose. \"...Said you could help us.\" \"Who said?\" \"The green-eyed goddess,\" said the other. \"The one you call the Lady. She said you might be our only chance.\" Susan frowned. The Lady was known to work in mysterious ways, and her divinity was a matter of some debate, but the denizens of Dunmanifestin typically gave Death - or anyone called upon to fill his office - a wide berth. While Susan neither liked nor trusted this intervention, she clearly could not ignore it. \"I suppose it would be foolish to ask you what you want of me,\" she said at last, surrendering. \"Perhaps you should start by explaining why.\" \"It's a long story,\" said the strong one. Gently breaking free, Susan found a spot to sit on the cobblestones and settled her skirts around her. \"I have time.\" \"Good.\" In the sword's reflection, Susan glimpsed a wry, weary smile from the slender one. \"Because that's all we have any more.\" - There had been three of them, once. Stheno, the mighty, whose feats of strength and endurance were whispered in the same breath as those of Heracles and Atlas. Eurayle, the far-seeing, who could spot an eagle on the wing before it saw her and from that single glance deduce its course of travel. And Medusa, the beauty, who despite being the youngest ruled over them all with her grace and easy charm. It was that beauty which had been their downfall. Ceto, their ambitious mother, was determined that Medusa have a real crown for her golden locks. Boasting of her daughter's modesty and virtue to the great Poseidon, who (much like his brother) could not resist a challenge, she contrived an encounter for the pair at Athena's temple. Stheno and Eurayle were pressed into service to stand guard. Perhaps Mother had overestimated them as well, to think they could stand against an enraged Athena when she learned what had taken place on her altar. Poseidon, with all the constancy one would expect from a god of water, blamed the four of them for the affair. No one dared - or cared - to speak in their defense. Mother, as mastermind, was transformed into a ravening sea-beast as punishment for her pride, fated to bring forth only monsters ever after. Medusa lost what divinity she had possessed, along with her looks. Her shining hair became a tangle of slithering serpents, her ivory complexion grew dull and scaly, and she could no longer cast her flirtatious gazes without turning mortal beholders to stone. Stheno and Eurayle suffered the same transformation, with one difference. They retained their immortality, and were told to consider it mercy. They did. In fact, after the initial shock, it almost came to seem a blessing in disguise. As demigoddesses, their lives had lacked direction. Without the gods' intervention, they might never have known the suspense of the hunt, or the exhilaration of battle, or the glory of a hard-won kill. Being objects of terror was in many respects more satisfying than the admiration they had known. (\"The Patrician has a saying along those lines,\" Susan mused aloud, then quickly apologized for interrupting.) Medusa, still their natural-born leader, took to it better than any of them. Only in hindsight did her sisters wonder whether she had carried a certain desperate hope into battle with her as she charged into the fray. Had she stared down each sword praying that this time, its bearer would not flinch and freeze, but strike true? They would never know. For better or worse, she was granted the wish of every mortal: death came for her in her sleep. A few centuries or so - maybe longer - passed while they busied themselves with vengeance against Perseus's descendants, with steadily decreasing returns. They paid little heed to the rise of strange monotheistic religions, or that fewer and fewer of their divine counterparts crossed their paths even long enough to shun them. Then one day, they awoke in the ruins of Rome, and realized the world no longer had any place for them. They sought out the gods, but Mount Olympus was empty and cold, diminished from the mighty temple they had known. There were no oracles: only prophets, who had nothing to say on the subject of Gorgons except to predict their destruction at the hands of the Father or Son in some distant war: a prospect which had long ago lost its charms. And while the gates of the underworld had always been locked to them, they wandered the earth in vain seeking even a sign of its entrance. Their punishment - or simply their tenacity - had left them alone, the last of their kind. It was then they began to envy Medusa's fate. Tentatively at first, then with greater zeal, they began their flirtation with oblivion. Or would have, if the bastard had only paid them some attention. They bared their necks to the sword and arrow, stood fast against hurricanes and tidal waves and lava flows, allowed themselves to be burnt and hanged and buried alive (\"which didn't seem like a particularly good idea even at the time,\" Stheno admitted). They sprinkled themselves with holy water and tried praying to the God who had taken the place of their old ones to release them from their shackles, but He remained silent as well as unseen. In a final bout of frustration, they turned their fiercest glares and nails and caustic blood on each other. All they had to show for their struggles was a long string of petrified villages and a crushing sense of futility. Eurayle was the one who first proposed the theory that the solution might lie elsewhere, in another world - more like the one they had lost, but ruled by more sympathetic powers. The idea came by way of her lover, a wizard who by means of complex and subtle spellcraft was able to avoid her direct gaze without encumberment. (\"Such a genius,\" Eurayle murmured wistfully. \"And so unappreciated by his colleagues.\" \"No one to blame but himself for that, what with that nonsense he was always spouting about wizard blood being divine,\" Stheno scoffed. \"Besides, I never liked the way he'd whisper to your hair. Like he thought you were that pet of his.\" Eurayle began to issue the rejoinder in what was obviously a long-standing argument, then remembered they had company and resumed the tale.) When he determined he could not persuade her to stay, he set about harnessing the innate transporting properties of his library to provide them with a means of travel, then taught them the method. With thanks and farewell - a kiss from Euryale; a restrained nod from Stheno - they vanished into the stacks, emerging again in an ornate study where the books' spines were stamped in an alien alphabet. It was a scene they would repeat countless times over. What gods they found were largely indifferent, either not comprehending the problem or upholding their counterparts' judgment. Some were apologetic, but hampered in their ability to assist by their followers' lack of faith or in aggravating agreement with the majority in their refusal to tamper with a fate long since decreed. Stheno and Eurayle pleaded, cajoled, wept, shouted, cursed, and on a few memorable occasions attempted to inflict physical harm, but the result was always the same: the audience would end, and they, heads bowed and hooded, would make their preparations to move on. So at last, they had wound their way to the Disc. By chance, they had arrived in Ephebe, and embraced each other with shouts and tears of joy, believing for one moment of wild, joyful delirium that they had come home. For another moment - or at least a moment as immortals measure time - it was close enough for them to postpone their errand. Too close, in fact. Gradually, their longing for that which was different became exacerbated by that which was similar. Thus, at last, they began their pilgrimage to Dunmanifestin. They knew the response they would receive even as they set out. But deep in their breasts, the traitorous ember of hope that had rekindled in their first glimpse of this world still burned. - \"And that brings us here,\" Stheno concluded. With great care, Susan turned her head to wipe a tear from her eye, disguising the gesture amid her efforts to stand and compose herself. \"I'm sorry,\" she said, when she felt she could trust herself to do so without her voice wavering. \"But what the other gods told you is doubly true for my grandfather. He carries out the Duty. He doesn't intervene. The few times he's gone against that code, things have gotten - complicated.\" Which is why he has you, a voice in the back of her head that was decidedly not The Voice sneered. You and your ability to imagine solutions he can't, to act on the unthinkable. He'd intervene enough to stop this meeting if he didn't want you getting involved, wouldn't he? And he certainly wouldn't loan you that sword. Susan's gaze shifted away from the sisters' reflections and down the length of the weapon's impossible edge. Surely he didn't expect her to use it? No, she realized. He didn't. \"...don't need him,\" Stheno was saying. \"We came to you!\" \"There's nothing I can do,\" Susan said, choosing her words with precision. \"I'm like your sister: mortal in every respect that matters. If someone were to wrest this sword from me and slit my throat before I could react, I would be as helpless to prevent that as I am to raise it against you.\" She did not dare watch Eurayle's reaction, but from the sudden blur which left her on the ground empty-handed before lunging in Stheno's direction, she surmised the far-seeing sister had made the connection as quickly as she hoped. Picking herself up, she felt along the ground for the sword, looking and then averting her eyes in quick succession. One hand touched the handle, and came away warm and wet. Instead of flinching, she undid her second-best cloak with only a pang of regret and prepared to fashion it into a means of cleaning up the aftermath. There would be complications, she sensed, as her hair knotted itself up in its most sensible bun: the one she wore to steel herself for parent-teacher conferences. Well, so be it. Let the gods condemn her for the mortal failing of compassion. Or let them try. For she knew no part of her would bend before their notion of justice.",

    "text": "J'onn stared up, in some awe, at the throne of the Grey King. Hades stared back, his eyes deep and surprisingly lively in his wan, hollowed face. For the first time, J'onn sensed another mind in this place of the dead, fierce and cold and alive, and burning with lonely intelligence. The god watched him silently, one hand resting lightly on the empty throne beside him. \"You have made your way past my guardians,\" the grey king noted, almost absently. J'onn only nodded. A three-headed dog doesn't pose too much trouble, not when you're intangible. As far as Cerberus was concerned, J'onn was right where he belonged. It had only been the river of souls which had... hurt, really. \"Why, mortal?\" J'onn frowned a little, then allowed himself the touch of humour. \"The same reason as most, I imagine. I do apologise for the cliche, your majesty.\" To his surprise, Hades smiled a little, at that. \"You get used to it,\" he intoned, and there was a weight of dry, hollow years behind the words. \"At least it proves a distraction, at times. There is... so little, here.\" J'onn nodded, the red weight of a dead planet in his mind, and offered a quiet, wry smile in sudden sympathy. The god tilted his head to one side, studying him. \"It is a difficult thing, to be alone,\" J'onn explained softly, and the Grey King nodded silently. \"It is indeed,\" he answered. \"Very well, mortal. Name your companion, and I shall name my price.\" \"Bruce,\" J'onn whispered, voice cracking a little, and for a second he thought he saw empathy in the god's burning eyes. \"I would have my mate returned, your majesty. Even for a little while. It was... not his time.\" \"The time is not for mortals to decided,\" Hades answered, not unkindly. \"But... for a price...\" J'onn nodded, his agreement unconditional. No price of his was too high. \"Anything I may give you,\" he pledged, firmly. The god smiled sadly, and stood, coming down the steps beneath his throne to stand before his supplicant. And there, for a moment, he hesitated. \"It is... some time before my wife... my Persephone... returns,\" he began, something that might almost have been embarrassment in his dark eyes. \"I am... lonely, mortal.\" J'onn looked at him then, looked directly into the burning eyes of the god of death, and saw something there that was terribly familiar to him. Something small, and alone, and in need of some fragment of warmth, no matter how tiny. Something fearful, even as it yearned. He nodded. \"How long until your queen returns?\" he asked, and the sudden, surprised glow in the hollowed features was nearly reward in and of itself. \"Not more than two months. Sixty days.\" The pale eagerness of the immortal voice was wounding in its sincerity. J'onn nodded, and laid a gentle hand of the grey arm. \"Then shall we wait for our mates together, your majesty?\" he asked softly, and the hesitant smile he recieved was more beauty than had ever graced the lonely halls in the long months of summer, when the queen of the dead was gone from her husband's side.",

And she is and was and will always be beautiful but the times between boys felt as black as the color the Korean girl was painting her toenails. Williamsburg waited while she went into hiding and cried into a pillow on the UES. Her mother took her tea when her tears became less frequent and the Earl Grey was floral and hot in her throat. She ate a corner of a finger sandwich and only went to the washroom to check if he had texted her a dozen times instead of twenty which was, mother said, something. When she finally dragged herself out of bed at three in the afternoon it was to get a latte and smoke the first Parliament of the day on her way there. She texted and texted hello hello please write me but he never wrote back, and one cold April afternoon when she tried his number it turned out that it had changed. Mother found her a place helping at the museum, two days a week, and on her lunch break she looked at the books in the gift shop, which was close to the door that she had to exit to smoke her lunch. Into the ether the emails went and the texts floated out with no response and no answer. His band was playing on a Thursday in Alphabet City, a show that she should know better to attend. She teased her hair big to feel brave and winged out eyeliner as thick as it could go. She got there during the sound check. (not too early and not too late) (not too desperate, careful, pretty girl) They played and he sang and she clapped like everyone did because they were good and he; he was magnetic. They were special. He was perfection and she gazed on him and had never stopped loving him, and needed to tell him, or touch him, be close to him like before. She chased him through the crowd to the bar where he got a beer and swatted her off like she was a mosquito. I have a show to play he said. Can we talk later she asked but he brushed her away for the stage and the girls and guys and the attention. She followed him to the afterparty, too, where he ignored for the drug-laden mirror like so many nights before, and she smoked so much that she could not even cry.",

    "text": "Negatives There are times when she seeks out the pools. It mostly happens when enough time has lapsed for her to have grown vague in her own mind's eye, for her to have forgotten what it was that brought her here. In moments of clarity she realises that the maiden she still sees when she thinks of herself, pale and frail and beautiful, stretching out her hand in the hope of catching the sun in it, has died a death of darkness and wilting. The flower of her youth's beauty, that had seemed so invincible, so timeless, was trampled so easily under immortal feet, and only lives now as a gnarled, bitter, poisonous barb. She no longer is that maiden, she sometimes realises with a shock that is startling, because she does not know who she is, instead; a creature of pale flesh that never seeks out the sun, of hair that slides against her face in caresses that hiss of her own danger in the night, hiding in the darkness, the dampness of where the light does not penetrate. She never gets to see herself - only the reflection of what she must be in those moments when she pierces men's hearts in a way that is not that unlike the way she did it before. They are all hers in those moments, full of her, focused only on her and on how she draws near. If there is one thing she can still love in this new existence of rock and bone it is how the certainty of their fear congeals into an eternal devotion; they can never get loose from her now, she will always be what they saw last, what they felt last. She is the night that steals their light away, and it is so similar to how it was before, to how they watched her from between their lashes, wanting, wanting, that she always laughs while their skin turns chipped and grey and cold. But sometimes, when it has been a while and the maiden in her mind's eye is still too strong to be replaced by what she sees reflected in the terror of her army of statues, she seeks out the pools. They are dank and stagnant; pools that cultivate life without light, without eyes, creatures of habit and long legs and a hatred of the sun. She is one of them now - her punishment for wanting the sun on her was to never see light again, in the sky or in the eyes of someone else, and now she shares these dark waters, that ripple with slow, cold drops that fall from a ceiling that isn't a sky. She curls her body at the edge of the pools, silent, a slide of limbs that do not remember day, a shiver of hair against her cheek that smells of danger. She never looks into the water, no matter how close she gets. No matter how she trails her finger over the surface, so close until the water seems to be inching upward, attracted to the movement of her hand. No matter how she leans, and catches glimpses of fear, of hair-that-is-not, of something telling her in silent tongues to stop. And she isn't sure why she does not look. It would be fitting, she often thinks; that her own face should be what she sees last, the flash of horror in her eyes at herself, at the shape that she has taken against the backdrop of cold, unforgiving stone, before she becomes eternal herself, immovable like the cave that houses her now. It would be fitting, she often thinks; because she has become all that she wanted to avoid (cold alone deadly dark) and if she were to die, she would still want to do it on her own terms, watching that which she has become be her own downfall. A ray of light, perhaps? A final shared look? Before the darkness overtakes her she wants, in the rare moments of clearness in a world of earth and rock, to have a final flash of light. And since she is all she has left now, all that she can sustain, she knows it will have to come from herself. Still she does not look, and she knows by that token how far she has fallen from the girl who defied goddesses. The water reflects nothing but the cave overhead. The pathway into the coldness of earth, of death. She wonders, at the times when she sits there, at the whispering waters' edges, if she would freeze into herself, body arched over the water, or if she would fall in; become stone making a stream, making a change in what seems to be so timeless and still. Disturbing the surface until the earth's pull was enough again to stop the upheaval. Memories turn into stone here like everything else. * How it works is thus: silently she regresses, and what goes last will be the memory of how she was in those first moments, just after she changed. For now, she still remembers that time; what will happen when she dies is that she no longer does. With every stilling of a man's flesh underneath her gaze, the growth of rock-that-was-life, a bit more of that memory is chipped off. Dwelling near the pools she does still remember, for now - remembers how it took her days to dare touching a hand to her face, not sure if what she would feel would still be skin, not sure if there would be anything at all and not just the unimaginable horror of a face lost. Though it felt brittle and cracked under her fingers, it was skin. Still, it took her a few days more to run a hand through her hair for the first time, because it had been speaking to her already - small hisses, that could easily have been dreams, in that point during the night when time seems to be unsure in which direction to go, when she can tell just by the strangeness of the darkness in the cave that Apollo is about to take to his chariot and start his round, bypassing her every time. Running her hand through that living forest of hair-that-is-not, hair-that-is-creature left her with bite marks on her fingers. Small ones; no wounds, just warnings. Her own danger telling her to beware. And then she remembers that she bashed her head against the side of the cave for a while, trying to see if she could kill it - herself, though she didn't think that then - and when she found she couldn't, it didn't really seem to matter and she went to sit at the entrance of the cave. And she recalls that she wasn't unhappy, not at all, in that moment. In fact, she remembers, that was the moment when she had the thought that maybe this was exactly where she needed to be. * Her sisters found her soon enough; the shared pull of the umbilical cord a point of gravity between them. None of them were ever quite complete, she knows now, without the purpose that the cold rock under her fingers was already becoming. Their purpose: to protect her; her purpose: to take risks. To invite conflict, to invite eyes, and then turn them into stone. When they came, Stheino and Euryale looked past her, because they could not look at her, and that is something Medusa regrets - but they came, and she could look at them when they weren't looking back. It was before she killed the first person to look at her - after that it was a little easier, because even if memory was already congealing, cooling, she could not bear the thought of her sisters growing into that stillness and coldness that was so utterly shocking, the first time. Stheino and Euryale don't quite understand her preoccupation with the water. They don't understand that it brings her to a death of sorts. They don't understand how there is something that she wants, in that black mirror. They're not mortal, and she had never thought that it would be a frontier of such magnitude, of such breathless impossibility to scale between them. The fact that she can still die becomes a thing that separates her from her sisters in every way - because it means a different sort of time. She can't imagine her sisters feeling every second like a drop of water flicked against their skin, or feeling like every moment spent is leading up to something, something that is hidden, so far. * In time she comes to see that in the light of history, the battle that she has fought with a goddess who would not accept her question for a light in life was inevitable. There is a whimsy to the way the gods live their eternal lives; they stir up things because they fear the stagnation of immortality, and sometimes they seem like children kicking a nest of bees - the stings, the danger all worth it, all worth the giddiness of the initial play. But in time she comes to see that they, too, dance to the silent music of Khaos and Kosmos, the negatives, the twins separated by inverted light. Even the gods do not choose what they do; and they must know this, they must, because if there is one gift that they possess it is the painful ability to see clearly everything that they cannot do, while not seeing all of the things they can. They must know that even they are bent to the wills of things that have no name, and that that is why they fulfill their duties with such cruelties. It is cruel of Athena to take from Medusa the light. It is cruel to make it the punishment for a crime in which it was the stake, the highest prize. It is also, Medusa comes to see, not only Athena's decision, because every step of the shadowy path she now treads runs upwards, leads to a summit. And after that? She cannot know, she does not see; if she were to see she would find nothing staring back but the hardening face of fear-into-rock. There are patterns that can be felt but not laid bare. After summits the paths usually descend again. Yet she has a feeling that nothing awaits her but an abyss after she scales the way laid out before her feet. * And when Perseus does come, it takes Medusa a moment to catch her breath, as though she has really reached the final step of a lifelong staircase only to find nothing at the top but a sweeping wind, an empty sky. She can look at him while he cannot look at her; and she does, she does, because he is a shining beacon in her world that is now utterly dark, and she hates him for it and she loves him for it and she wants to devour him, have that light inside of her, have it be a warmth that she can now only remember with the vaguest flicker of recognition. He sparks it again in her, and she wants to rip his head off and see it turn to stone, not quite dead yet, body not quite caught up yet, life (warm red sticky) bounding away without direction. She wishes, not for the first time but certainly the last, that she had had the courage to look into the pools in her cave, to have kept the honour wholly her own, to have died a death of nothing more than a sigh that stirs a silent surface. (She does not know if she would have, of course. There is no knowing if she would have died; if she would not simply have lived, one breath tumbling over the other, no moment of understanding, no moment of fading. Living with the added burden of feeling so afraid of what the pool had reflected back at her that she would probably have been unable, ever again, to kill - just for fear that what she was would show clearly in the breaking of eyes, the stuttering of breath in a stone breast.) She did not have the courage and the silent will of Khaos and Kosmos is insistent and pushing and she fights Perseus, because that is what she does now. He has tricks, which should be unfair - but she has tricks, too, and they are no less unfair. That his trick should grant him the possibility to look at her and not die makes him the only man worthy of it, the only man who deserves to kill her. She will haunt him; she knows it, and for a moment that is almost enough. She wishes there were time to ask him if she could look into his shield. Tell him that even if that does not kill her he will. But there is no time, and there is no bridge of that kind between them, a bridge over which she can send words that he can receive. There are no words that she can share with him. She does not see herself. His sword opens up an empty stretch of space between the things that made her her - an abyss after the summit; the neverending fall; the breaking of a surface of black water; a maiden; a sun chariot, sinking between leaves of brown and gold.",

      "They're not mortal, and she had never thought that it would be a frontier of such magnitude, of such breathless impossibility to scale between them.",
      "The fact that she can still die becomes a thing that separates her from her sisters in every way - because it means a different sort of time.",
      "She can't imagine her sisters feeling every second like a drop of water flicked against their skin, or feeling like every moment spent is leading up to something, something that is hidden, so far.",
      "* In time she comes to see that in the light of history, the battle that she has fought with a goddess who would not accept her question for a light in life was inevitable.",
      "There is a whimsy to the way the gods live their eternal lives; they stir up things because they fear the stagnation of immortality, and sometimes they seem like children kicking a nest of bees - the stings, the danger all worth it, all worth the giddiness of the initial play.",
      "But in time she comes to see that they, too, dance to the silent music of Khaos and Kosmos, the negatives, the twins separated by inverted light.",
      "Even the gods do not choose what they do; and they must know this, they must, because if there is one gift that they possess it is the painful ability to see clearly everything that they cannot do, while not seeing all of the things they can.",
      "They must know that even they are bent to the wills of things that have no name, and that that is why they fulfill their duties with such cruelties.",
      "It is cruel of Athena to take from Medusa the light.",
      "It is cruel to make it the punishment for a crime in which it was the stake, the highest prize.",
      "It is also, Medusa comes to see, not only Athena's decision, because every step of the shadowy path she now treads runs upwards, leads to a summit.",
      "And after that?",
      "She cannot know, she does not see; if she were to see she would find nothing staring back but the hardening face of fear-into-rock.",
      "There are patterns that can be felt but not laid bare.",
      "After summits the paths usually descend again.",
      "Yet she has a feeling that nothing awaits her but an abyss after she scales the way laid out before her feet.",
      "* And when Perseus does come, it takes Medusa a moment to catch her breath, as though she has really reached the final step of a lifelong staircase only to find nothing at the top but a sweeping wind, an empty sky.",
      "She can look at him while he cannot look at her; and she does, she does, because he is a shining beacon in her world that is now utterly dark, and she hates him for it and she loves him for it and she wants to devour him, have that light inside of her, have it be a warmth that she can now only remember with the vaguest flicker of recognition.",
      "He sparks it again in her, and she wants to rip his head off and see it turn to stone, not quite dead yet, body not quite caught up yet, life (warm red sticky) bounding away without direction.",
      "She wishes, not for the first time but certainly the last, that she had had the courage to look into the pools in her cave, to have kept the honour wholly her own, to have died a death of nothing more than a sigh that stirs a silent surface.",
      "(She does not know if she would have, of course.",
      "There is no knowing if she would have died; if she would not simply have lived, one breath tumbling over the other, no moment of understanding, no moment of fading.",
      "Living with the added burden of feeling so afraid of what the pool had reflected back at her that she would probably have been unable, ever again, to kill - just for fear that what she was would show clearly in the breaking of eyes, the stuttering of breath in a stone breast.)",
      "She did not have the courage and the silent will of Khaos and Kosmos is insistent and pushing and she fights Perseus, because that is what she does now.",
      "He has tricks, which should be unfair - but she has tricks, too, and they are no less unfair.",
      "That his trick should grant him the possibility to look at her and not die makes him the only man worthy of it, the only man who deserves to kill her.",
      "She will haunt him; she knows it, and for a moment that is almost enough.",
      "She wishes there were time to ask him if she could look into his shield.",
      "Tell him that even if that does not kill her he will.",
      "But there is no time, and there is no bridge of that kind between them, a bridge over which she can send words that he can receive.",
      "There are no words that she can share with him.",
      "She does not see herself.",
      "His sword opens up an empty stretch of space between the things that made her her - an abyss after the summit; the neverending fall; the breaking of a surface of black water; a maiden; a sun chariot, sinking between leaves of brown and gold."

But if you're used to it, if you've visited the Labyrinth since you were a girl, it's a nice place to wander. All the data in the world right there, and all the pleasantly circuitous paths that constrain access, that turn information gathering into a quest instead of a chore. They built the Labyrinth for security - to make sure ordinary people didn't have too much information - but of course for people like me, it just made information hunting more fun. Sometimes I feel like I could stay in the Labyrinth, browse around, follow the stray threads to see where they will go. Maybe linger on a dead end or two - nothing wrong with a little bitter with the sweet. Sometimes, I find it so restful that I almost forget what will happen if I don't get out in time, if I don't find what needs to be found. This time, I don't forget. I get the info and get out a good 30 seconds before a nanopatrol swings by. And this time... it's what I've been looking for all along. I was starting to lose hope that even existed, but now.... It's mine. Win. Epic, legendary win. I know just who to call. 000000000000000000000000000011001100110010 Persephone Ariadne's coming over today. Literally, she's coming over. Her body in the physical space occupied by my body. It'll take an hour for her to get here, but she wants to keep me off her machines. She's protective like that - she knows that they'll probably \"disconnect\" her some day and she doesn't want them to know I'm helping her. So she's coming here. To my body's living space. Flesh is so tedious. I've only been back in this hellhole \"reality\" for a couple of weeks, so the routines are still a little blurry. So it takes me a minute to remember that in this world, people like their little rituals of hospitality. But I'm here, and that's just how it is, so I clean the table and put out a pitcher of Potable and some glasses. Obviously, this is not where I want to be. But I don't have a choice. The doctors said that I'm not going to last if I don't spend six months \"recuperating\" for every six months I spend virtual. So spending six months a year in flesh is the bargain - the extremely reluctant compromise - I have to make with my own mortality. I can't wait until they figure out how to separate the mind from the body. Until then, it's mostly hackers I hang out with. They're an open-minded bunch, at least about this sort of thing (not like those judgmental \"Flesh is Truth\" fuckers). And hackers can talk to me in any season, even when my virtual self is laying low. The trouble with having hackers for friends, though, especially if they're into all that social justice bullshit, is that they're always going to pull you into some crazy scheme. Though truthfully, without Ariadne's crazy schemes, I would probably have died of boredom by now. And it's only been two weeks. When she finally gets here, even with my still-adjusting perception, I can see she's excited. She knows better than to hug me (for which I'm fucking grateful), but as soon as I close the heavy door behind us, she's grinning at me and practically jumping up and down. But I put out the stupid drinks already, so we sit and drink and she waves her glass around as she talks. She's so excited it almost makes me forget how dull her reality is. How hushed. \"And you know what's funny? About what this means. Some of them were like us. You know? They were tech geniuses, so it makes sense. That they would think like hackers,\" Ariadne rambled. I didn't want to argue when she was so happy. And she had a right to be pleased with her victory. There were rumors floating around for years about it - the infamous code that the first Daedalus Teams had hidden for future generations to find. But I'm a little more wary than she is. For one thing, we don't know for sure if the rumors are true. I tell her this. \"Remember -- all we know is that you found some ancient code - we have no idea yet what it does. It could be a trap to lead them to you, it could do something awful to random people - or it might not do jack shit at all. I'm happy for you, I am, but we need to be very. Fucking. Careful.\" \"When am I not careful?\" Ariadne says with a wink, and I give her an eyeroll. (The eyeroll, by the way, is one of the few things in flesh that I have a real aesthetic appreciation for.) After a long, weary discussion (I'm still getting used to having to breathe between sentences), we realize that we should do a test run on an isolated system. To see what we're getting into. But a 100% isolated, unsurveilled, nano-inaccessible system is going to take more juice than we have. Time to call in another friend. An expert in isolation. 0010000101000110100111110010010100100010 Ariadne I really should have asked who this other friend was. How was I supposed to know it was her? I can't believe she recognized me, though. We've never met in flesh space, so she must have found a way to get into the official face files. Which does not make me jealous at all. As soon as she walked into Persephone's apartment and saw me, she just laid into me. She started making accusations, started accusing me of being complicit with the i-ocracy. Even though she was the one who was bouncing hackers from the Labyrinth, she was the one who outed hacktivists for being 'too moderate.' What a hypocrite. Really, she deserved everything I gave her. We yelled at each other for a good while, I have to admit. It hurt to use my physical voice so much, but she kept yelling, kept accusing, kept making snide comments about my so-called lack of radicalism, that I had no choice but to call her a sanctimonious, tactically clueless, intellectually facile pseudohacker. Repeatedly. Finally, Persephone, who was drooping on the couch, her fingers on the bridge of her nose as if she were having another transition headache, said, \"Enough! Minotaur! Ariadne! I DON'T CARE.\" \"But she sent the Theseus virus to my mainframe!\" \"No! Stop! You say you want to fight the power. Both of you. This is your chance. Personally, I don't give a shit - I mean, seriously, what do I care who runs the prison I'm trapped in half the year. But you two say that this shit matters. You go on and on and ON about how 'Information is Life.' Well, now you have the information. You are on the brink of changing EVERYTHING. So you can argue about who wins the bestest-most-badass-hacker contest, or you can change the fucking world. But choose now. Because if I have to listen to this shit any longer, I'm going to put YOU two in virtual space and take away your code.\" Minotaur and I looked at each other. After a moment, we nodded and agreed to get to work. We weren't scared of Persephone. Really. We just, you know, respected the sound reasoning in her argument. We set up Minotaur's system and ran the test. When it was done, we all sat there in silence. The code worked. The code worked. 100001101001010000000010001010100000010 Persephone It's been more than five months since my idiot friends brought down the Labyrinth. I have to admit I'm pretty proud of them. The Labyrinth had been hiding the key to its own destruction all along. There were investigations, of course. The most popular explanation is that one of the original Daedalus team who built it was actually a hacker named Athene. She knew that someday someone would find the code that would dissolve the walls that gave the info-ocracy its structure. Now, no data is safe. Anyone can find out anything. They're rebuilding, of course. The people who ran things still run things, so they're protecting themselves. First thing they did was build a wall around their real identity. Then their money. Then they got to work hiding all the shitty things they did that they only wanted each other to know about. But it's not the same. They can't count on the maze to protect them. Nobody can count on anything anymore. The change has mostly been positive. The optimists are saying that this is the revolution, that soon everything will be different and all of us will be free and we'll share in building a new society. The Flesh is Truth crowd are being assholes as usual and saying that this is clear proof that we must return to the 'natural' order and make technology 'subservient' to pureflesh humans. The realists are saying that it's probably only going to be a short while before we return to the status quo. But even they admit that until then, things are up in the air. Strange things can happen in those moments when everything falls apart and everything gets built again. Some of those things might even be good. The hackers have had mixed reactions. Most of them are mourning their playground. They used to have a space where they - and only they - were free. Now they have to share with everyone. But for most of them, it's a sacrifice they were willing to make. Like I said, a lot of them are into that social justice bullshit. I mostly don't care. I'm glad my friends found what they were looking for. I'm glad this round in flesh hell has been at least slightly less boring than usual. But I'm mostly excited about getting back where I belong. It's strange, though. In the past, when I went back virtual, I could count on returning to flesh world and having everything basically be the same. This time, honestly... I have no fucking clue what it'll be like in 6 months. That's pretty weird, when you think about it. The flesh world isn't used to being so... dynamic. Don't get me wrong - it's still going to suck. Getting pulled out of the world where you belong always sucks. But at least there might be something new to wake up to. Something to make the time pass more quickly in hell. I've managed to keep in contact with Ariadne and Minotaur, even though they're in hiding. They're friends now, if you can believe it. Most people don't know it was them - being woefully underappreciated is a lot fucking safer than being stupidly famous - but they need to lay low just in case someone figures it out. I guess being on the run together and sharing the world's biggest secret can make even people who hate each other good friends. Not that they don't still fight, once in a while, but what can you expect? They also told me that they were going to keep an eye on me when I go back to my world, just in case it isn't as safe as it used to be, now that information is running wild. That was really very sweet of them, so I just said thanks. I didn't tell them that in my world, it's everyone else who needs to be terrified of me. Not the other way around. Even hackers don't get to know everything that happens over there, and - free information exchange or not - that's the way it should stay. I wonder sometimes what it will be like when everyone else figures out that this world is not what they think it is. The short little visits people take - an hour, a day, a week - can't convey what the virtual world is like. When you're really immersed, really and truly in the virtual, there's nothing like it. The textures, the smells, the way the light travels about you - nothing can compare to the intensity, the realness of it. And what you build there, you can see its code as you build it. The only thing in the flesh world I could compare it to is if someone could see the quantum physics involved in every single interaction with the world that they have - but instead of equations, it sounded like music, or tasted like wine. Power means something different in the virtual world. Intimacy means something different altogether. Code is truth. It's strange to think that the same code that controls the flesh world makes the virtual world possible. Ironic, I suppose. But maybe my friends were right - all worlds, at some point, must be built by information. I hope that now that everyone's free and shit that they don't all decide to visit my world. No one wants to live in a fucking tourist trap. I'm ready to go now, but of course I have to wait another week still. It's close, though. I can almost taste it - six months of bliss, six months of sunlight and truth, of all the boundaries of flesh and reality blurring and fuzzing and recombining into something new. Six months of moving at the speed of electrons. Six months of feeling like a human fucking being instead of just being one. And when I'm done.... Okay, I admit it. I'm curious. I have an entirely uninvested, purely intellectual curiosity about how the flesh world will change when I'm gone. Just a tiny little curiosity. Barely worth mentioning. Not that I would ever tell Ariadne or Minotaur. I'd never fucking hear the end of it. (end)",

    "text": "Cassandra sees. Superimposed upon this world she sees the future, creeping and crawling and pressing its inexorable self upon the present. She sees a withered black thing reach up with long, long arms and yank a young boy down to the ground, stuff his body in its great gaping maw the size of its entire body. She screams and points, trying to warn them, but they look at her with scorn. Crazy Cassandra. You'd pity her if it weren't so hard. The future turns and looks at her with its huge white eyes, hungry. The future is always hungry. The boy topples screaming from the roof and now it is his mother screaming. You cursed us, she yells, turning on Cassandra, groping for a rock to throw, her face streaked with grief. You are a curse. Get away, death-omen. Cassandra sees the black thing put its arms around the grieving woman and hold her close. It will have her too, before long. She goes. The snakes in the temple like her. She lets them wind around her arms. There is no future for them, no present, no past. It is a relief. She supposes she is grateful for the peace. Around the priests, though - that one watching her with lust will die in a fire. She can see his skin melting and dripping to the floor. That one loitering in the corridor will fall in love with a woman who will scorn him. She can see him holding his beating heart in his hands, blood streaming from his eyes. There is no beauty to these visions. Perhaps there was before. She can no longer remember, just as she can no longer remember what it was to see only the present without its future hovering over. Cassandra has always seen. Her brother Hector comes to find her, lays a hand on her shoulder. He smiles at her, and she tries not to see the way it stretches too wide, blood pouring over his chin, his nose smashed back into his face. Cassandra, he says, Come. You shouldn't disturb the priests. Mother wants to see you. I don't want to see her, Cassandra wants to say, but what comes out is Hector, please don't die. He laughs, his rich, full laugh. His ribs are bare, all the flesh scraped off in ribbons. I don't plan to, he says, and shakes his head a little. Don't worry, little sister. You don't need to worry. But then he can't see the future hovering over his head, hungry and waiting. Andromache lets her hold her child. Astyanax soothes her, his soft noises and clear eyes cutting through her second sight. He tugs her hair and babbles non-words with delight. Andromache smiles. He likes you, she says. I like him, Cassandra says, and does not look at Andromache with her arms heavy with chains and her face heavy with sorrow, aged beyond her years. He is a beautiful child, she says, and leans down to kiss his forehead. Her mother comes in and hovers around her, and Cassandra ignores her in favor of the child. Her mother thinks she is insane, as everyone does, but doesn't treat her with kindness - more with wariness and fear. She looks down at Astyanax and starts with a small cry, because there is a black creature at his feet, tugging on them. No, she says, sternly, no, you can't have him. Cassandra? Says Andromache worriedly, and as she watches Astyanax's body crumples, his blood spraying up into her face. She screams in surprise and fear, and her father bursts through the door and says, Paris is home, Paris has come home, his voice full of joy. Cassandra covers her face with her hands but she can still see it, still see. All of them, she says, all of them. Andromache hands Astyanax to a nursemaid and embraces her. The chains clink as she moves, but her body is warm. Shh, she says, Cassandra, it's all right. Come, let's go see your brother. Come. When she pulls her hands from her eyes, Astyanax is gone, and his future gone with him. Her mother and father are staring and she tries to collect herself. Yes, she says, shakily. Yes, I will see Paris. She walks like an old woman down the hall with Andromache at her side. She can hear Hector talking, but he doesn't sound happy, he sounds angry. She shies back and Andromache urges her forward. It has been years since she saw Paris, and she's not sure what to feel. Paris has not always been kind to her. But he is her brother. The great oak door swings open and she steps inside. There is a woman with him, and she is beautiful. She looks nervous, too, slightly uncertain, but she is beautiful. Paris is looking at no one but her. The room is soaked with blood. She stops. What is it? Andromache asks, but Cassandra cannot answer. There is blood running down the walls. The tapestries are torn and ragged. The air smells like smoke and there are corpses on the floor, thick as carpet, bloated, mouths gaping, entrails strewn as vultures pick at their eyes. The black things that summon death crawl among them, mouths wide and dark, cackling silently, and they are dead, all dead, blood ankle deep on the floor- She screams. Paris is perforated by spears, his dead eyes staring, mouth gaping wide. Hector's neck is broken, his head bent to the side, blood coating his front. Everywhere red, everywhere death, everywhere the stench of rot and decay- And the woman, the woman with Paris that Cassandra doesn't know, unchanged. Her dress white. Her face clean. Except her hands. Her hands are red and dripping. Her! Cassandra cries, It is her, she brings death, death is with her, she's going to kill you all, look, look! The woman with Paris looks scared. He covers her face, turns her body into his. By all the gods, he says, can someone stop her? No she says, no, I won't stop, I won't, I won't be silent, why are you so blind! Because they are, not to see this, not to understand that this woman with the white dress and the red hands is their death, is the dark future she's been seeing, might as well be a black thing with gaping jaws and white eyes. But they are blind. Cassandra - she sees.",

      "The snakes in the temple like her.",
      "She lets them wind around her arms.",
      "There is no future for them, no present, no past.",
      "It is a relief.",
      "She supposes she is grateful for the peace.",
      "Around the priests, though - that one watching her with lust will die in a fire.",
      "She can see his skin melting and dripping to the floor.",
      "That one loitering in the corridor will fall in love with a woman who will scorn him.",
      "She can see him holding his beating heart in his hands, blood streaming from his eyes.",
      "There is no beauty to these visions.",
      "Perhaps there was before.",

      "He smiles at her, and she tries not to see the way it stretches too wide, blood pouring over his chin, his nose smashed back into his face.",
      "Cassandra, he says, Come.",
      "You shouldn't disturb the priests.",
      "Mother wants to see you.",
      "I don't want to see her, Cassandra wants to say, but what comes out is Hector, please don't die.",
      "He laughs, his rich, full laugh.",
      "His ribs are bare, all the flesh scraped off in ribbons.",
      "I don't plan to, he says, and shakes his head a little.",
      "Don't worry, little sister.",
      "You don't need to worry.",
      "But then he can't see the future hovering over his head, hungry and waiting.",
      "Andromache lets her hold her child.",

      "He tugs her hair and babbles non-words with delight.",
      "Andromache smiles.",
      "He likes you, she says.",
      "I like him, Cassandra says, and does not look at Andromache with her arms heavy with chains and her face heavy with sorrow, aged beyond her years.",
      "He is a beautiful child, she says, and leans down to kiss his forehead.",
      "Her mother comes in and hovers around her, and Cassandra ignores her in favor of the child.",
      "Her mother thinks she is insane, as everyone does, but doesn't treat her with kindness - more with wariness and fear.",
      "She looks down at Astyanax and starts with a small cry, because there is a black creature at his feet, tugging on them.",
      "No, she says, sternly, no, you can't have him.",
      "Cassandra?",
      "Says Andromache worriedly, and as she watches Astyanax's body crumples, his blood spraying up into her face.",

      "All of them, she says, all of them.",
      "Andromache hands Astyanax to a nursemaid and embraces her.",
      "The chains clink as she moves, but her body is warm.",
      "Shh, she says, Cassandra, it's all right.",
      "Come, let's go see your brother.",
      "Come.",
      "When she pulls her hands from her eyes, Astyanax is gone, and his future gone with him.",
      "Her mother and father are staring and she tries to collect herself.",
      "Yes, she says, shakily.",
      "Yes, I will see Paris.",
      "She walks like an old woman down the hall with Andromache at her side.",
      "She can hear Hector talking, but he doesn't sound happy, he sounds angry.",
      "She shies back and Andromache urges her forward.",
      "It has been years since she saw Paris, and she's not sure what to feel.",
      "Paris has not always been kind to her.",
      "But he is her brother.",
      "The great oak door swings open and she steps inside.",
      "There is a woman with him, and she is beautiful.",
      "She looks nervous, too, slightly uncertain, but she is beautiful.",
      "Paris is looking at no one but her.",
      "The room is soaked with blood.",
      "She stops.",
      "What is it?",
      "Andromache asks, but Cassandra cannot answer.",
      "There is blood running down the walls.",
      "The tapestries are torn and ragged.",
      "The air smells like smoke and there are corpses on the floor, thick as carpet, bloated, mouths gaping, entrails strewn as vultures pick at their eyes.",
      "The black things that summon death crawl among them, mouths wide and dark, cackling silently, and they are dead, all dead, blood ankle deep on the floor- She screams.",
      "Paris is perforated by spears, his dead eyes staring, mouth gaping wide.",
      "Hector's neck is broken, his head bent to the side, blood coating his front.",
      "Everywhere red, everywhere death, everywhere the stench of rot and decay- And the woman, the woman with Paris that Cassandra doesn't know, unchanged.",
      "Her dress white.",
      "Her face clean.",
      "Except her hands.",
      "Her hands are red and dripping.",
      "Her!",
      "Cassandra cries, It is her, she brings death, death is with her, she's going to kill you all, look, look!",
      "The woman with Paris looks scared.",
      "He covers her face, turns her body into his.",
      "By all the gods, he says, can someone stop her?",
      "No she says, no, I won't stop, I won't, I won't be silent, why are you so blind!",
      "Because they are, not to see this, not to understand that this woman with the white dress and the red hands is their death, is the dark future she's been seeing, might as well be a black thing with gaping jaws and white eyes.",
      "But they are blind.",
      "Cassandra - she sees."

Here the gods slay men themselves: Artemis in all her cruel and ever-chaste beauty sending her hounds to tear apart a hunter, her arrows and those of her brother Apollo piercing Niobe's children, Hera the oft-betrayed seeking out Semele and Lamia's children, Zeus devouring Metis. The threads are bright, with dye and with her anger. Here are the gods seeking out mortal women for their beauty, and lying with them by force or deceit.

Here are the gods in all their petty cruelties and fears, their rivalries, their vanities, their infidelities, their insecurities: no better than the mortals whose worship they demand, and worse than many. Arachne locks each stitch into place with the fierceness of battle. Athena has glorified the gods with the scene she has woven.

    "text": "Once upon a time, there was a beautiful young man, with flowing golden locks and eyes of purest, clearest blue. His parents were King Pierus of Macedon and Clio, the muse, and they named him Hyacinth, and raised him with all the love they could give him. He was a happy child, and wanted for nothing, and grew up to be considered a great beauty by all who saw him. One such person who saw him was the god Apollo, who, having heard Hyacinth's beauty compared to that of the gods, came down to see for himself if the claims were justified. He was instantly taken with the young man, though hesitated in making his presence known straight away, and instead remained hidden to watch him bathe. As he watched, Apollo became aware of a west wind blowing, caressing the youth's body and playing with his hair, and recognised it after a time as Zephyr himself. Quickly realising that he would have a rival in his affections, the god approached the boy in human form, sitting by the edge of the water and beckoning him over. To his surprise and joy, Hyacinth swam over straight away, leaving the wind behind without a second thought. \"Who are you?\" The young man asked, blue eyes dancing as he took in Apollo's impressive form. \"Do you not recognise me? I had heard you were a devout servant of your gods.\" Hyacinth paused for a moment, clearly considering the question, and then lit up as he realised the answer. \"You can only be Apollo!\" He bowed as well as he could in the water, then smiled up again. \"I am honoured.\" \"Then that makes two of us. For I am honoured to finally meet the young man who I've heard was more beautiful than Adonis. Especially as I find the rumours to be accurate.\" The young man blushed, but smiled up sweetly. A gust of wind did its best to knock Apollo from his perch, but he remained in place and refused to be hindered by Zephyr. Hyacinth was sweet and humble in addition to being beautiful, and he would not be prevented from having him as his own. \"My sister Aphrodite would be jealous, if I could return to report a kiss from someone more beautiful than her lover.\" Apollo leaned over so he was nearly eye-level with Hyacinth. \"Do you think you could help me with that?\" Blushing again, the youth raised himself up in the water and pressed a sweet, soft kiss to Apollo's lips. At that moment, a fierce gale blew in from the west, the jealous Zephyr making his presence known once more. In retaliation, Apollo called forth the sun and had it shine too brightly for the wind to withstand, chasing away his competition for the time being. Pleased with himself, Apollo said his goodbye to Hyacinth, promising to check in on him again soon, and left to attend to other matters which he could no longer keep himself from, even in the pursuit of such a beautiful boy. Unknown to either Apollo or Hyacinth, Zephyr returned to play with the young man again once the sun god had left, becoming just as infatuated with him as Apollo had. Whilst he was already a step behind his rival, he would not allow himself to lose out on the affections of the boy, and began to form a plan to win them away from Apollo. *** As taken with the young man as he was, Apollo visited Hyacinth often, teaching him sports and games, going with him to bathe, and simply enjoying his company for hours on end, and always stealing a kiss before he left. If it could be said that Apollo loved Hyacinth, though, the same could be said tenfold of Hyacinth towards Apollo. The boy was flattered by the attention, in part, but also taken with the kindness and companionship the god had offered him. Though he'd always been told by his parents that he would one day know a great love, as they had before him, he'd never believed it could be as great as the one he shared in secret with Apollo. On seeing this, Zephyr became more and more jealous, bubbling with rage until he finally decided that he would take no more of it, and would instead put his plan into action. He appeared to Hyacinth on a rare day when Apollo was not with him, disguising himself as an old sage in the hopes of seeming more trustworthy. \"Are you the boy they call Hyacinth?\" Hyacinth looked up from the javelin he was sharpening and smiled warmly at the old man, for he had been taught always to be kind of his elders. \"I am. Can I help you?\" Zephyr smiled, seeing that his disguise was working. \"It is I who comes to help you, my dear boy. Is it true that you are Apollo's lover?\" The boy's eyes widened, a guilty blush spreading across his cheeks. No one was supposed to know! But if this old man knew already, then perhaps there was more to him than met the eye. \"How do you know that?\" \"I see things, dear boy.\" Zephyr dug around in a bag slung over his shoulder, and produced a beautifully decorated jug that he'd had enchanted by a powerful witch. \"That is why I seek you out. Take this jug and fill it with water from the pool where you first met your lover. Bring it home with you, being careful not to spill a drop, and pour it into a basin with a smooth bottom. You will see Apollo's true feelings reflected in the water.\" Of course, the jug would show him no such thing, but Hyacinth took it from the old man, and followed his instructions straight away, having no reason to disbelieve him and expecting to be filled with joy at seeing Apollo's love for him. When he poured the water, though, the scene reflected in it was one of Apollo with another boy, being even more tender and loving than he had before, truly becoming his lover, and laughing that Hyacinth was little more than a pretty distraction. Upon seeing this, Hyacinth knocked the basin over and fled to his bedroom, shutting the door behind him and pushing his dresser in front of it to keep it closed. He took to his bed and cried all through the rest of the day and well into the night, finally tiring himself out and falling into an exhausted sleep. When he woke, he found that he was no longer alone in the room. Seven beautiful women surrounded his bed, all looking down on him with the soft sympathy his mother had often displayed for him, and he recognised them straight away as the seven Pleiades, nymphs who were the daughters of Atlas and lived in the heavens as stars. \"Poor boy,\" the eldest - Maia - knelt down beside him. \"You have been the victim of a terrible lie.\" Hyacinth looked at the beautiful woman in confusion - was she talking about Apollo? Surely women who lived as stars were used to seeing such betrayals. The other six knelt around him as well, stroking at his body and soothing him. They were clearly here for a reason. \"I should have known better than to think I could hold the attention of a god,\" Hyacinth sulked, though in truth he realised now that he had been silly to believe that Apollo would be interested in him. \"But you have, my darling. It is not Apollo who has deceived you.\" \"Then who?\" Hyacinth furrowed his brown in confusion. \"Zephyr, the west wind. You've felt his presence before, haven't you?\" Hyacinth nodded slowly, remembering now the times he'd felt as though the wind was playing with him, and always blowing in from the west. He'd never thought that it had been true, though. \"He was the old man you met today. He is jealous of your love of Apollo and wants you for himself, though is too much of a coward to win you fairly. So he showed you a lie in the hopes of breaking your ties with Apollo.\" Struck dumb with shock, Hyacinth could only stare for several moments, his stomach turning over sickly as he realised that the nymph was telling the truth. \"But I have cursed Apollo and shouted for him never to come to me again!\" He wailed. \"He won't know what really happened.\" \"Shh,\" Maia soothed. \"Hermes, my son, will come when I call. He will deliver a message to Apollo, and you will see him again. I promise you. Now sleep, little one. Rest up for tomorrow, when you will be reunited with your lover.\" With the gentle attention of the seven nymphs lulling him to sleep, it wasn't long before Hyacinth found slumber again, this time much more peacefully, with thoughts of a joyful reunion making the prospect of the morning much brighter. *** As had been promised, Hermes delivered the message to Apollo that Hyacinth had been tricked by Zephyr. Though the god was disappointed that his young lover had been so quick to think ill of him, he was willing to forgive him - especially as doing otherwise would mean letting Zephyr get away with his treachery, which he would not allow. He met Hyacinth in a field, where the boy was picking tiny blue flowers that matched his eyes. On being greeted enthusiastically, arms thrown around him and a sweet kiss pressed to his lips, he found it easy to forgive the boy when he asked for it, and continued on as though nothing had happened. Zephyr, enraged that his plan had gone awry, crept in as a subtle breeze, not making himself known just yet, but waiting for his moment to strike. Apollo had found that Hyacinth had a love and a talent for sport. Though he would never compete with a god, his skills were impressive for the mortal realm, and Apollo wished to help him develop them to their fullest. If Hyacinth was going to be his lover for years to come, it would do well that he was accomplished in the things he showed promise at. As he had not yet introduced him to discus-throwing, Apollo decided that this would put the final touch on his complete forgiveness of Hyacinth, and show the youth that his love for him was just as strong as ever. Hyacinth's first few throws showed that he had a natural talent at this as well, and he was soon demanding kisses for particularly impressive distances, much to Apollo's delight. However, Zephyr still lurked, curling around in the grass and watching the boy with jealousy. As he realised that his foiled plan had made Hyacinth's love for Apollo unbreakable, he raised up a great gust of wind, blowing debris up and blinding both god and mortal, as well as catching the newly-thrown discus in its flight. In a blind rage, he tossed the disc back at the boy with all the force he could manage, and then disappeared as quickly as he could to sulk over his defeat. When the rain of sand and leaves settled, Apollo looked to see if Hyacinth was all right, and to his horror saw him lying on the ground, body twisted awkwardly and blood flowing from his head. He knew before he approached the boy that he was dead, falling to his knees before him and cradling his body close to weep over his loss. As he gathered the boy's body up to return it to his parents for a proper burial - one he would ensure was done respectfully and as grandly as Hyacinth deserved - Apollo felt a stinging need for some other memorial to him, something permanent so that his beautiful lover would leave the mark on the world that he hadn't had the chance to. One of the small blue flowers the young man had arranged in his hair fell to the ground, and Apollo picked it up to look at it. He set Hyacinth's body down again and knelt before the place where his blood had flowed into the soil, and from it he drew up a much grander flower, in the same colour as the young man's beautiful eyes, with a hundred tiny blooms - it paled in comparison to the beauty of the boy it would be named for, but it would remain forever as a reminder of such a beauty that a hundred flowers could not match it, and while there was no scent sweet enough to compare to Hyacinth's sweetness, the flower would mimic that also, as well as it could. When he was satisfied with his work, Apollo returned to his lover's body and lifted it in his arms to take it home.",

    "text": "Quiet for the moment, Kali looked around carefully. The stage was almost set, now. Elysian Fields, they'd decided, in mocking reference to the angels they'd set to draw in, and as a gesture towards Mercury's already badly strained temper. Though he'd been the one to call them actors, the one to call this half-formed meeting place their stage, the act still sat very very badly with him. \"Mercury is not taking the next part well,\" Samedi rumbled, coming to rest beside her with a grin and his customary leer. She flashed back a dark smile from habit, and frowned. \"The eating of human flesh, even the pretense of it for the sake of a human audience, was never going to sit well with him,\" she noted quietly, watching the temperamental Olympian gesticulate wildly at her son. Ganesha, thankfully, was doing his level best to calm the other god down, and exerting a considerable influence over affairs, she thought. Doing his best to ease obstacles from their path, but it wasn't easy. It was never going to be, such a dangerously balanced gathering as this. \"He will do his job, though,\" the Baron said, dark eyes grim. \"As psychopomp, he has taken the disruption of Death as badly as the rest of us. Fast as he is, this random tearing of souls from life is testing every death god around the world, and he would see it stopped as soon as the rest of us.\" \"I know,\" she acknowledged. Careful, so carefully balanced, this act, this trick. To force Loki to act, to force the angel they knew lay beneath into the light. To force the actors of this ill-thought Apocalypse together, and bring them to action. They had to force Gabriel out. They had to make him move. He was the only piece they had in this game. And she, at least, and the god by her side, fully intended to make use of him. The others, though... the others were more trouble. They needed Mercury. The only Trickster they'd been able to reach, through the channels of Death at the Baron's command, with enough of a stake to convince him to act. They needed his cunning, his ability to deceive, to pull to them the last player in their act. They needed Mercury, messenger and thief, to draw the Devil in. Coyote would have done it, would have lied easily, but Coyote's lands were too much under threat from Lucifer for the Devil to believe his pretense of betrayal. So they needed Mercury. Which was why Ganesha had spent the last four days carefully and patiently keeping the seething Olympian calm, why they'd invested in some high-quality illusions of mortals to prevent his horror at the act from losing him to them. All that, at least, was explainable. Zao Jun, too, was explainable. The Stove God was not there by their request, but in the interests of fulfilling his function to the Jade Emperor, and reporting on the actions of families. Which, when interpreted very broadly, might entail reporting on such families as her Devas, or Yahweh's angels. Reporting on foreign interests, in case the Emperor should feel the need to take action. Zao Jun was, in essence, the most explainable of all features at such a meeting as this. Zao Jun was a diplomat, or, more bluntly... a spy. Odin... less so. The Norse ruler too had largely invited himself along, his eye set upon Loki, and Kali didn't trust the layers of planning and deception she saw there. Though the Aesir was willing enough to play along with their game, though he would lie through his teeth with a grin and happily play the part of monster to the two Vessels they'd use to lure the others in... there was something in him Kali could not, and would not, trust. Any more than she trusted the other Norse addition to their gathering. Baldur, gleaming with faith and light and strength, with conviction of speech, who played so readily the role of their leader, who would stand so surely beside her. Baldur, who had been dead. Baldur, who had volunteered himself to even his father's shock, playing some game they couldn't see, with Odin and Loki and the Devil for his pieces. And Kali, too, if he had his way. There was darkness now, in the god of light. The gnawing burn of destruction inside him that she would know a thousand miles away, and she did not trust him. He thought to fill the Baron's role as her partner, to take the lead. Well, she would let him. To a point. Samedi, watching her as she glared across the hall towards the younger god, grinned and spat eloquently to the side. \"The trials of being beautiful, eh?\" he murmured filthily, grinning at her, and without looking she elbowed him sharply. \"Behave, or I'll be talking to your wife,\" she purred, dark and friendly, and he laughed at her. \"And you, or I'll tell your husband,\" he shot back, and she grimaced, looking back at Baldur once more. \"He has nothing to worry about there,\" she muttered, cool as the darkness and truthful as a blade. Her husband had no worries. He knew her purpose well, and trusted her to it. \"And with our lurking partnership of jotun and archangel?\" Samedi asked, oddly serious, for once, and she flinched, a little bit. \"That's different,\" she murmured softly, feeling something in her tighten. \"Shiva understands that, too.\" Shiva alone, her husband who laid worlds low to make them anew, her husband who understood the act of destruction in order to create, to purify, to make anew. Her husband, who understood the act of sacrifice. As, she thought, did Gabriel. Gabriel, who had watched a world drowned to make it clean, might understand why her hand would wield the blade. Gabriel, who had asked her, silently, so long ago, to make him clean, to burn the blood from his hands. \"Yes,\" Samedi said softly. \"I see.\" And he did. The Baron Samedi, the loa of death, here to see the natural order restored, that one affront that brought them all here. He understood. Outside, they heard a car pull into the park, knew it without question for who it was, and Kali drew herself up. Pulled command around her like a cloak, and looked out over this motley gathering, this dramatis personae. The stage was set. Time... to raise the curtain. \"Let it begin,\" she whispered softly, and, eyes glittering, they nodded.",

    "text": "Fire: Loki doesn't like the desert - it's more the realm of ifrits and djinni than jotnar, and the games of illusion played in blood and sand make him nervous - but there are times when Gabriel feels a yearning for it, somewhere between nostalgia and homesickness. So the god contents himself to simply complain bitterly as they stand beneath the scorching sun, and never once actually bar them passage. Water: After Manannan's gift, they wander for a time in the lands of the Tuatha de Danann, wander Ireland's shores. When they pass the washerwoman at the stream, the bean nighe, her hands red with blood and soap, a wild laughter in her eyes, and the names of their fallen on her tongue, they bow stiffly, and pass by as quickly as courtesy allows. Neither Loki nor Gabriel want that knowledge. Not yet. Earth: Among the gods of earth and wealth, Loki does not have the best reputation, he knows this. Too many things begged, cheated or stolen, too much history of clever tongues and clever fingers. He would, however, like to point out that most of those were not, in fact, for his benefit, and Gabriel is nowhere near as fond of material wealth as, say, the Aesir. And even if that were not the case, even he would know better than to attempt to steal from Hades himself, in his own court no less. Gabriel is somewhat more diplomatic in the phrasing, while reassuring the death god of their good intentions. Persephone still ends up laughing at them. Air: They did not travel to Buyan, the home of the winds, to steal the soul of Koschei the Deathless. No. Really. Gabriel is already immortal, and Loki is not inclined to spit on Manannan so early in their friendship. They went to Buyan because Gabriel -not Loki- was curious, and also because the once-Messenger was feeling antsy and wanted a race. And, really, who better than the Three Winds, to race an archangel? Not everything in this relationship is Loki's fault, thank you so very much. *grumbles* Dragon: Loki's fingers trace over the stone, tracing the lines of a dragon betrayed, the echo written in stone of a long ago battle. Gabriel watches him, silently. Neither of them knew Illuyanka, not at all. But it is hard not to see the echoes, in his death, of their family, of Fenrir, of Jormungandr. It's hard not to see their futures, mapped in stone and the bones of dead dragons, and for a long moment, for no reason at all, they conceive a violent hatred for this Teshub.",

A stilted tumble of limbs, so watchful, so wary, for all his laughing, for all the dancing of his eyes. A shyness hidden in the provocative sprawl of his body, a fear curled in the shaking of his limbs. Hiding behind his eyes, as if he hopes Dionysus cannot see him, cannot know. As if his mask is all his face, and he hopes the world may never see behind it. And deeper, hidden even from himself, where the wine slips silken tendrils of truth around his heart... as if he hopes Dionysus will find him anyway. So fragile a hope. So tender a mystery. Truth sung in sweet-song beneath the fear, bound and constrained, and ready, so ready, to be freed. Dionysus laughs softly. Slips sweet as wine along flung limbs, whispers soft as dreams across wide, fearful eyes. Curls his hands in an archangel's hair, laughs as he rolls them, as they turn and turn on silks and pillows and the soft clouds of intoxication. As tension spills wine-dark from a terrified form, and slips soft secrets, sweet mysteries, into Dionysus' hands. \"Let go,\" he whispers, hands dancing, luring, wringing cries from an archangel's throat. \"Let go,\" he commands, as he pulls the threads higher and higher, as he tugs lust and love and hope and fear all to the surface, as he plies his craft to that one and only end. To break constraint. To wring truth. To give life. \"Gabriel,\" he says, as an archangel cries, as terror trembles on the brink of understanding. \"Gabriel, let go!\" And the Gabriel screams, and the world screams, the haze of intoxication wrung to that brutal, savage clarity, that sweet and terrible surrender. Gabriel screams, and Dionysus laughs, and crushes his mouth, drinks the screaming from him, drinks away the pain, soft as a sigh, sweet as wine, and leaves only the long, languid stretching of the truth. Leaves only Gabriel, staring up at him in fear and awe, and the laughing behind his eyes. This, his mystery. This, his secret. This, his task. In wine, truth. In truth, freedom.

    "text": "Once before, Gabriel had seen his brother stand in the face of Judgement. Once before he had seen Lucifer, proud and beautiful and defiant, stand against all enemies, all judgement, all derision, with nothing but contempt, and loss, and desperate defiance. Once before. Once. And now, this time, again. This time, though, it was not before their Father's court. This time it was not before the ranks of Heaven, the accusing faces of his brothers, and Yahweh was conspicuous in His absence. No. This time, it was before a court of gods, an alliance of wounded mothers and slaughtered sons, of fathers and husbands and tricksters and death. Not for a shattered Heaven, but for a shattered Earth. For the world they shared between them that Lucifer would destroy, for their blood that stained his hands, for the sake of a game he had no right to end. For the sake of those things, they came to judge, and hold accountable. What could he say? Gods had always been good at that whole eye-for-an-eye thing. They'd stopped the Winchesters. Champions, yes, pieces on the board, and it had been Gabriel's plan that sent them here, but this wasn't about games anymore. Gabriel wasn't dead, and Lucifer wasn't playing by the rules, had decided to smash the board, and his god and his goddess had called him to fight, this time. To stand, once again. A voice from Above, calling out to stop a sacrifice. Once before, Gabriel had done that, too. Abraham... had taken it considerably better. There were times Gabriel really despaired of the Winchesters. Getting off the hook, for anyone else, would have been a good thing. A reward. Hey, you don't have to die! But they wanted to know why. They wanted to know who would stop Lucifer in their stead. They wanted to know who the hell else was going to stand up. Kali had answered them. The Baron had answered them. Janus and Coyote and Ganesh had answered them. Loki had answered them. And in the end, too... Gabriel had answered them. In that alley, in the darkness before the dawn, no longer playing games, he had answered. And now, he stood. His god within, his goddess without. His playmates these long centuries ranged around him. His little brother at his back, a stern and righteous echo of all they had once been, of a court that would never sit again. And the Winchesters. The Champions, in paranoid determination to see this done through, to see it done right, to be sure, this last time, that Gabriel was not playing a trick. He was. Oh, he was. But not on them. Not this time. Lucifer glared at them. Smirking, unimpressed. Lucifer had torn them apart, not weeks before, shredding vessels and earthly forms like paper. Destroying Ganesh. The Baron. Odin and Mercury and Loki and Gabriel. Destroying them. Or so he thought. Lucifer, lounging in his tiny room, painting pictures in the frost-work of his frozen heart, looked on them with contempt. It was Kali who stepped forward. Kali, blue-bright and blood-dark, and softly smiling. Kali who turned, ignoring the Prince of Lies with her son's blood on his hands, and faced Sam Winchester. Faced the human two among them, four rings clenched in his hand, and smiled. \"Draw the gate,\" she murmured, a bubbling darkness. \"I promised Gabriel I would not kill his brother. Draw open the gate to Hell and to his Binding. And I will put him through it.\" \"Will you now,\" Lucifer purred, standing and staring down at her with dark interest. \"And how, my dear, were you planning to do that?\" \"You can't!\" Sam said, always the faster of the two in matters like this, always the student, quick off the mark. \"It would be the same as Michael fighting him! It'll tear the world apart!\" \"Fuck that,\" Dean chimed in. Succinctly enough, Gabriel thought, and granted the boy silent points for that. \"Well now,\" Loki murmured through their lips, his god's sly tongue tripping softly, a Trickster softly sneering. \"That all depends, doesn't it?\" And Gabriel grinned around their mobile mouth, and threaded grace through Loki's soul in sly delight, in black amusement at their game. \"Depends on what?\" Lucifer asked, soft and sibilant, resting bright, beautiful eyes upon them. Gabriel flinched, inside. Just a little, for the ache in his chest from the memory of a blade, and Loki curled around him, through him, and quivered with a jotun's anger at what had slain them. And then, slowly, gracefully, like the moving of mountains, Kali stepped forward once more. Kali, the Destroyer, wearing no human form now, but the full Incarnation of all she was, shining blue-black in the darkness, with eyes of blood and a lolling, laughing tongue. Kali, the goddess, the warrior, the mother and protector. Kali, who had seen her son destroyed. Kali, who had seen her family murdered. Kali, who had leapt full-formed to the fight, and slain demons with her first breath. Kali, the Destroyer, and the humans turned from the sight of her, cursing in pain from the raw reality of her. \"It depends,\" she said, with a laughing darkness, \"on whether I choose to fight you in this world.\" A twitch of that laughing tongue, four arms rolling in languid shrug, and then Loki bounced them forward to her, smiled sly-bright beside her, and she turned laughing to him. To them, smiling to Gabriel inside the god. \"We are not mortals, or angels, Kinslayer. We are gods.\" \"And gods have a lot more options,\" Loki purred, wiggling their fingers in mocking salute. Lucifer looked at them. Looked at the gods gathered at their back, and the rings clenched in Sam's hand, and the raw, bright darkness that was Kali. Lucifer looked at them. And Lucifer fled. Tried. Tried to flee. But not now. Not this time. Coyote tripped him, a flash of movement and the smell of sweetgrass, laughing as he spun from the angel's hands. Castiel, with a slow, thoughtful look on his face, cast a ward of banishing on the outward wall, a quick sketch in his own blood while Gabriel looked on in fascination, and drove the once-archangel back inside. Samedi, solid, immovable, barred the door. And Kali, bright, beautiful, terrible Kali, seized hold of the Devil's arm, and tugged him to her face. \"Stay with us, Morningstar,\" she hummed, and pressed a searing kiss to his forehead as he struggled. She could not hold him long. Not Lucifer. But she did not have to. As one, then, they turned to Loki. To Gabriel. To the Trickster and architect, and the pivot of their choice. And Gabriel, with his god inside his breast, with the soul of a jotun stretched to his fingertips, turned and offered his hands to Janus, the god of doorways, and Ganesh, who removed all obstacles from the path. He opened his hands to the gods, and together they drew open their own doorway. The world twisted, turned upon itself, thinned and frayed into a window, a door. And through it... For a moment, as it opened, they saw a tree, impossibly vast, stretching above and beneath and around, their world cradled in its branches, their lives hung upon its leaves. For a moment, and then the world tipped downwards, then the door opened lower, past the creeping ice and falling fire, past the dragon gnawing at it's roots, and touched... something beyond. Some remnant, some shrunken opening, but what rested beyond was vast. What remained was infinite, a shimmering darkness, a yawning void. An opening, to something great beyond. \"... What is it?\" whispered Sam, behind them. A human, stunned and hushed, but Gabriel wasn't much better. He was an archangel. He was born to awe. \"We call it Chaos,\" Janus murmured softly, his very being the door unto its embrace, his faces watching it with soft understanding. \"To Kali, it is the Unmanifest. To Gabriel... Father. But here, in this place and at this door... it is Ginnungagap. The Yawning Void.\" \"Raw creation,\" Kali whispered, falling towards it, tugging the Devil in her wake. \"The wellspring. The source.\" She laughed, turned to her prey. \"Fight me there, Morningstar. Fight me over and over, as many times as we may fight and fall, and the world will not fall for it. This Midgard, this Earth, will not be touched. While we fight at the base of creation, our shudders will but gently rock them to sleep.\" \"No,\" Lucifer snarled, and wrested himself free. \"No! I won't be caged, not by you! I won't play this game!\" \"Why not!\" Gabriel snapped, sheared past rage by the throbbing memory in his chest, the ache of a brother's blade. \"So happy to see us play yours, brother! Don't like it when the tables turn?\" He grinned, a hard, savage expression, one he'd learned from the god within his breast, one he wore with Loki's black approval. \"Well, too bad. That's what Tricksters are for, bro. To make the tables turn. And this time... This time, Lucy, the trick is most definitely on you...\" \"Don't do this,\" Lucifer pleaded, switching suddenly from arrogant archangel to desperate brother, hiding the hate in his eyes under soft supplication, the very prince of lies. Gabriel knew it. With the memory of a blade, he did know it. But oh, how his heart shuddered with that look. How he longed to reach out. \"Brother, if you let them do this, she'll kill me!\" \"She will not,\" the Baron rumbled suddenly. The loa moved forward, his skull gleaming beneath his skin, his essence shining out from the man he rode. The Baron moved forward, and smiled. \"You caged Death once,\" he said, spitting to the side. \"Chained him, forced him to take lives before their time. Have to tell you, petit, he be real unhappy with you right now.\" He grinned, a skull's grin, nodding to Kali. \"So I won't be digging no graves this day. Death, he won't be touching you. She may destroy you as many times as she please, tear you to pieces and shovel them through the hole if she want. You'll live. Whatever happens. You'll live.\" \"Jesus,\" Dean Winchester said, very quietly, in the background, and Gabriel smiled an old, sad smile. \"No-one ever said mercy had to be kind,\" he whispered softly, looking into his brother's eyes, seeing, for the first time, the fear in them. \"Didn't you remember that, Lucy? He can take, and He can give, but no-one ever said He had to be nice about it. Don't you remember, Lucifer?\" \"Let me go,\" Lucifer asked, very quietly, very softly. \"Brother, please. Let me go. I can't be caged again. I won't be caged again. Kill me, if you want, but please... don't do this. Not this.\" And it was Castiel, soft and puzzled, Castiel who asked, with the quiet, terrible simplicity of thought that made him one of the most dangerous angels Gabriel had ever seen: \"Why not?\"",

      "\"I promised Gabriel I would not kill his brother.",
      "Draw open the gate to Hell and to his Binding.",
      "And I will put him through it.\"",
      "\"Will you now,\" Lucifer purred, standing and staring down at her with dark interest.",
      "\"And how, my dear, were you planning to do that?\"",
      "\"You can't!\"",
      "Sam said, always the faster of the two in matters like this, always the student, quick off the mark.",
      "\"It would be the same as Michael fighting him!",
      "It'll tear the world apart!\"",
      "\"Fuck that,\" Dean chimed in.",
      "Succinctly enough, Gabriel thought, and granted the boy silent points for that.",
      "\"Well now,\" Loki murmured through their lips, his god's sly tongue tripping softly, a Trickster softly sneering.",
      "\"That all depends, doesn't it?\"",
      "And Gabriel grinned around their mobile mouth, and threaded grace through Loki's soul in sly delight, in black amusement at their game.",
      "\"Depends on what?\" Lucifer asked, soft and sibilant, resting bright, beautiful eyes upon them.",
      "Gabriel flinched, inside.",
      "Just a little, for the ache in his chest from the memory of a blade, and Loki curled around him, through him, and quivered with a jotun's anger at what had slain them.",
      "And then, slowly, gracefully, like the moving of mountains, Kali stepped forward once more.",
      "Kali, the Destroyer, wearing no human form now, but the full Incarnation of all she was, shining blue-black in the darkness, with eyes of blood and a lolling, laughing tongue.",
      "Kali, the goddess, the warrior, the mother and protector.",
      "Kali, who had seen her son destroyed.",
      "Kali, who had seen her family murdered.",
      "Kali, who had leapt full-formed to the fight, and slain demons with her first breath.",
      "Kali, the Destroyer, and the humans turned from the sight of her, cursing in pain from the raw reality of her.",
      "\"It depends,\" she said, with a laughing darkness, \"on whether I choose to fight you in this world.\"",
      "A twitch of that laughing tongue, four arms rolling in languid shrug, and then Loki bounced them forward to her, smiled sly-bright beside her, and she turned laughing to him.",
      "To them, smiling to Gabriel inside the god.",
      "\"We are not mortals, or angels, Kinslayer.",
      "We are gods.\"",
      "\"And gods have a lot more options,\" Loki purred, wiggling their fingers in mocking salute.",
      "Lucifer looked at them.",
      "Looked at the gods gathered at their back, and the rings clenched in Sam's hand, and the raw, bright darkness that was Kali.",
      "Lucifer looked at them.",
      "And Lucifer fled.",
      "Tried.",
      "Tried to flee.",
      "But not now.",
      "Not this time.",
      "Coyote tripped him, a flash of movement and the smell of sweetgrass, laughing as he spun from the angel's hands.",
      "Castiel, with a slow, thoughtful look on his face, cast a ward of banishing on the outward wall, a quick sketch in his own blood while Gabriel looked on in fascination, and drove the once-archangel back inside.",
      "Samedi, solid, immovable, barred the door.",
      "And Kali, bright, beautiful, terrible Kali, seized hold of the Devil's arm, and tugged him to her face.",
      "\"Stay with us, Morningstar,\" she hummed, and pressed a searing kiss to his forehead as he struggled.",
      "She could not hold him long.",
      "Not Lucifer.",
      "But she did not have to.",
      "As one, then, they turned to Loki.",
      "To Gabriel.",
      "To the Trickster and architect, and the pivot of their choice.",
      "And Gabriel, with his god inside his breast, with the soul of a jotun stretched to his fingertips, turned and offered his hands to Janus, the god of doorways, and Ganesh, who removed all obstacles from the path.",
      "He opened his hands to the gods, and together they drew open their own doorway.",
      "The world twisted, turned upon itself, thinned and frayed into a window, a door.",
      "And through it...",
      "For a moment, as it opened, they saw a tree, impossibly vast, stretching above and beneath and around, their world cradled in its branches, their lives hung upon its leaves.",
      "For a moment, and then the world tipped downwards, then the door opened lower, past the creeping ice and falling fire, past the dragon gnawing at it's roots, and touched... something beyond.",
      "Some remnant, some shrunken opening, but what rested beyond was vast.",
      "What remained was infinite, a shimmering darkness, a yawning void.",
      "An opening, to something great beyond.",
      "\"...",
      "What is it?\" whispered Sam, behind them.",
      "A human, stunned and hushed, but Gabriel wasn't much better.",
      "He was an archangel.",
      "He was born to awe.",
      "\"We call it Chaos,\" Janus murmured softly, his very being the door unto its embrace, his faces watching it with soft understanding.",
      "\"To Kali, it is the Unmanifest.",
      "To Gabriel... Father.",
      "But here, in this place and at this door...",
      "it is Ginnungagap.",
      "The Yawning Void.\"",
      "\"Raw creation,\" Kali whispered, falling towards it, tugging the Devil in her wake.",
      "\"The wellspring.",
      "The source.\"",
      "She laughed, turned to her prey.",
      "\"Fight me there, Morningstar.",
      "Fight me over and over, as many times as we may fight and fall, and the world will not fall for it.",
      "This Midgard, this Earth, will not be touched.",
      "While we fight at the base of creation, our shudders will but gently rock them to sleep.\"",
      "\"No,\" Lucifer snarled, and wrested himself free.",
      "\"No! I won't be caged, not by you!",
      "I won't play this game!\"",
      "\"Why not!\"",
      "Gabriel snapped, sheared past rage by the throbbing memory in his chest, the ache of a brother's blade.",
      "\"So happy to see us play yours, brother!",
      "Don't like it when the tables turn?\"",
      "He grinned, a hard, savage expression, one he'd learned from the god within his breast, one he wore with Loki's black approval.",
      "\"Well, too bad.",
      "That's what Tricksters are for, bro.",
      "To make the tables turn.",
      "And this time...",
      "This time, Lucy, the trick is most definitely on you...\" \"Don't do this,\" Lucifer pleaded, switching suddenly from arrogant archangel to desperate brother, hiding the hate in his eyes under soft supplication, the very prince of lies.",
      "Gabriel knew it.",
      "With the memory of a blade, he did know it.",
      "But oh, how his heart shuddered with that look.",
      "How he longed to reach out.",
      "\"Brother, if you let them do this, she'll kill me!\"",
      "\"She will not,\" the Baron rumbled suddenly.",
      "The loa moved forward, his skull gleaming beneath his skin, his essence shining out from the man he rode.",
      "The Baron moved forward, and smiled.",
      "\"You caged Death once,\" he said, spitting to the side.",
      "\"Chained him, forced him to take lives before their time.",
      "Have to tell you, petit, he be real unhappy with you right now.\"",
      "He grinned, a skull's grin, nodding to Kali.",
      "\"So I won't be digging no graves this day.",
      "Death, he won't be touching you.",
      "She may destroy you as many times as she please, tear you to pieces and shovel them through the hole if she want.",
      "You'll live.",
      "Whatever happens.",
      "You'll live.\"",
      "\"Jesus,\" Dean Winchester said, very quietly, in the background, and Gabriel smiled an old, sad smile.",
      "\"No-one ever said mercy had to be kind,\" he whispered softly, looking into his brother's eyes, seeing, for the first time, the fear in them.",
      "\"Didn't you remember that, Lucy?",
      "He can take, and He can give, but no-one ever said He had to be nice about it.",
      "Don't you remember, Lucifer?\" \"Let me go,\" Lucifer asked, very quietly, very softly.",
      "\"Brother, please.",
      "Let me go.",
      "I can't be caged again.",
      "I won't be caged again.",
      "Kill me, if you want, but please... don't do this.",
      "Not this.\"",
      "And it was Castiel, soft and puzzled, Castiel who asked, with the quiet, terrible simplicity of thought that made him one of the most dangerous angels Gabriel had ever seen: \"Why not?\""

    "text": "Year 9 Autumn When you were ten, you had killed. He had not. His hands were soft, touched by the lyre as much as the sword and the spear, yours were murderous, treacherous, exiled hands. No skill in them other than shoving, pushing away. You didn't tell him for years, for fear that he would look at you and see only the cloven head of another boy. Fifteen years later and he has killed more times that you ever could have imagined. He might be the greatest warrior in all of Greece, but you were a suitor of Helen; your father's hands pushing you to kneel in front of her, because he couldn't take another wife whilst your mother still lived. He has told you, time and time again, what his mother has prophesied, what all the Gods prophesise: He will be a great fighter, his name will be remembered forever as the best of the Greeks, but for this he will die young and have much sorrow before his passing. You have never replied to this, you doubt you ever shall, what could you say to turn him from his destiny. Now you turn to him, a hand on his knee, the other to his cheek (you never beg, except with him) and tell him what you did, so many winters ago. He laughs, in turn. He knows, he has always known. You wonder then, how he could not have known; his father took in many exiled boys, for far lesser crimes than yours. Perhaps he knew you first as the murdering prince of Opus, then the dark haired boy with desperate eyes. He asks you, as he fucks you, if you would kill for him, die for him. You do not answer, he does not need you to. This is another thing he already knows, so certain of this power. But you know he does not ask anyone else this, not the girls, not the other boys. His men follow him because he is their leader, you follow because you know his heart and you are as stubborn in your devotion as he is in his pursuit of Kleos. Year 7 Spring He has brought a lyre with him. You did not, thinking war could not last until the years end, thinking of saving space on the ship. Not that you were ever gifted. You are content that he might play, you are proud for him, you have been since you were a young boy. Your father would probably be furious, but you would not know. It has been almost fourteen years since you last saw him, and seven since you last heard mention of his name. You forget him sometimes. Achilles makes you forget everything sometimes. Even the war. The war seems everlasting, yet fleeting. So engrossed in the fighting, it has been 3 years since you last heard him play the lyre. Year 2 Winter The Trojan women watch the battle from the walls. You go to look at them, when he bades you not to fight. You know Andromache by sight now, better than her husband Hector. He is constantly at the front of the action and not held back by any request of hers. You look to see Helen, every day. She does not stand at the wall, or if she does you do not see her. To you she is a veiled girl, sat with her sisters whilst men clamour for her. If at one time you had seen her face, you do not remember. Achilles looks at you, before he goes to fight, when he returns, and during the battle (if the red haze lifts and he sees friend from foe.) Just stares. You don't know if he even sees you, he just stares. Like he wants to ask a question, knows the answer, but doesn't dare anyway. It isn't a face you like. Year 4 Summer You drag off your armour, aching to your bones. The blood which spilled so freely as the Trojan warrior toppled, like a tree relieved of it's roots, has dried dark brown, spread like snail trails across you. You shiver, half in disgust, half in excitement. He crosses over to you, kisses the bitter blood taste from your lips. A sword has dragged itself across his cheek. Another scar. You are growing older with every cut, your life blood draining out before your time. Year 9 Spring You have been outside the gates of Troy for nine years. Agamemnon insists, at every council, that the Gods still favour Greece, that you will soon be victorious. Kleos, he insists, will be your reward. The days are shorter, and darker, as if winter is holding on with a desperate grip, and even Achilles is loosing faith. He makes ever more frequent trips to his mother, comes back smelling of salt and seaweed, as though she will tell him something more than the prophecy she always offers. He will live, old and forgotten, or die, young and full of glory. No one has offered you this choice. Year 5 Autumn In the middle of a skirmish a Trojan warrior catches you on the arm with his sword. You turn to kill him, but Achilles sees blood bubbling over your arm and sees red. This is not your first wound in battle, and neither is it the worst, but you have been here five years longer than you wanted to be and now each day, each fight, is just another chance to die. When you return to the camp you pour water, tear a bandage and calmly clean the blood away. Achilles watches you like a hawk, insists upon tying the bandage (although it is you who visits the injured and helps fix their wounds). Achilles sends you there, most days, as if the Gods will forget you and not seek out your death the next time you return to battle. Year 1 Winter It snows. You didn't expect snow, having sailed all this way, across the wine dark sea. It makes everything seem a lot more ordinary, and you have more faith than ever that next winter you will have returned to Phthia, full of honour and glory. Victory is never far from sight, for the best of the Greeks and you know in your heart that Achilles is that man. For you are men now, all of you, who but a few seasons past were boys; waging war with wooden swords and hidden amongst the women. Year 10 Autumn You beg Achilles, on your knees, to return to the fighting. You have never asked anything of him like this. He refuses and you haven't hated him more than in this moment. But Nestor's words echo round your head and so you ask him one more favour. Your hands shake as he buckle up your armour, his armour. You clench your fists because he would not want to see your fear. You do not hear his words, the buzzing in your ears is too loud, like a whole swarm of bees has invaded, but you know in your heart what they are. Aidos Time Arete Moira Ate He does not say Kleos.",

    "text": "At the summit of Mount Olympus, in the secret headquarters of the international organization known as the Justice League, Zeus was calling everyone to order. He stood at the head of the table, the red Z shield emblazoned on his chest like a command. \"Hey, bitches, pipe down,\" Zeus finally snapped when nobody would shut up. \"Listen to Superman before he blasts you all with heat vision.\" \"If you're Superman,\" Poseidon spoke up on his left, \"why does your costume have a Z on it?\" \"Because you're jealous your 'superpower' is talking to fish,\" said Zeus, in a way that answered the question perfectly despite not answering it at all, because he was Zeus, and that was why. Poseidon grumbled under his breath. He hated being Aquaman. Across the table from him, on Zeus's right, Hera smirked. Poseidon stuck his tongue out at her, but she pretended not to notice. He decided he would spend the meeting shooting spit balls down her Wonder Woman cleavage. On his other side, Demeter nudged him discreetly with her elbow, then raised a small straw to her lips and blew. The spit ball hit its mark with pinpoint accuracy. Demeter quickly hid the straw and she and Poseidon put on their best innocent faces. Zeus wasn't fooled. \"Black Canary, stop hitting on Wonder Woman. Save that for after the meeting. No Aquamans allowed.\" Poseidon crossed his arms over his chest and sulked. \"Can we please get this over with?\" Hades grumbled from further down the table. \"You don't have to be here,\" Zeus said. \"After all, you don't even have superpowers, Batman. Hey, how's Batgirl? Still got those legs that won't quit? Oh man, those in latex...\" Hades glowered at him through his cowl. \"Persephone is fine.\" \"Come on, don't be so bitter. You'll always have your little Boy Wonder to yourself.\" \"Robin is female. Hecate, remember?\" \"Oh, right! You're fucking the other one now, what's his name...\" Zeus snapped his fingers. \"Nightwing.\" \"I am not 'fucking' Thanatos--\" \"All those in favor of talking about anything other than Batman's sex life?\" Demeter cut in loudly. The vote was unanimously \"aye.\" \"Excuse me,\" Athena spoke up. \"I believe it is customary to begin with some form of roll call, to make sure all are in attendance.\" \"The Justice League only has twelve members,\" said Zeus. \"Thirteen,\" Hades grumbled. \"Twelve members and Batman.\" \"You do have difficulty with numerals of more than one digit, if you will recall,\" Athena added. Zeus rubbed his chin. \"Fair enough. All right, let's go in order of awesome. Superman! Oh wait, that's me. Here! Wonder Woman.\" Hera adjusted her left bracelet until it was just so. \"Present.\" \"Black Canary.\" \"Here,\" Demeter said around the next spit ball she was preparing. \"Dove.\" Athena's expression was unchanged, though everyone at the table could tell she was having serious issues with being called fourth. \"I am present.\" \"Hawk.\" Ares, sitting on Athena's left, had his whole focus on playing Pokemon and didn't respond. \"Hawk!\" \"D'oh!\" shouted Ares. \"Wonder Mommy! I still can't beat Whitney's Miltank!\" \"Sand attack and fighting types, dear, remember?\" Hera told him. \"She keeps killing Cyndaquil,\" Ares said, fighting back tears. \"Cyndaquil is not a good bet against Rollout. Dry your eyes and try again with Machop or perhaps Geodude.\" \"I think it is safe to say Hawk is also present,\" Athena spoke up. \"Zatanna,\" Zeus went on. \"Here!\" said Aphrodite. \"Zatanna's cleavage.\" Aphrodite gave a small upper-body shimmy from where she sat. \"Also here.\" \"Plastic Man.\" Dionysus, despite being sat at the far end of the table from her, was busy concentrating on helping himself to a handful of the one who preceded him in roll call order. \"Plastic Man, get your hand out of Zatanna's cleavage and answer me.\" Dionysus sighed and pulled his hand back to its normal size and shape. \"Here, I guess.\" \"Wonder Twins.\" \"Here and here!\" Apollo said, waving sunnily. Artemis put her head in her hand. \"I hate being called that.\" \"But we are the Wonder Twins, Jayna!\" Artemis sighed. \"My point exactly.\" \"Flash,\" said Zeus. \"Here,\" said Hermes. \"And here. And here. And here.\" Hera snapped her lasso around him without batting an eyelash, and he fell in a heap on the floor mid-sprint. \"Thank you, dear. Red Tornado.\" \"Present,\" said Hephaestus, sitting up perfectly straight despite the fact that he couldn't have sounded less interested in what was going on. \"Aquadork.\" Poseidon glared. \"Here.\" \"Batdork. Wait, I know you're here because what else would you have to do? All right, that concludes roll call.\" Zeus shivered. \"It's a bit chilly in here. Captain Marvel, can you stoke the fire? Captain Marvel?\" \"And see, Rollout already has poor accuracy, so if you can manage a few Sand Attacks, like your mother suggested, she'll have a really hard time doing much damage to you. Good luck, sweetie; I know you can do it!\" \"Hestia!\" Hestia jumped where she stood coaching Ares. \"Oh, right--sorry, b--Superman.\" She looked around the room. \"Does anybody want any tea?\" Before anyone could answer, there was a loud beeping sound. \"I'm going to incinerate whoever's responsible for that noise in about ten seconds if they don't stop it,\" Zeus said, looking pointedly at Apollo. Hera put a hand on his arm. \"Dear, that's your alarm.\" Zeus blinked. \"Oh! Right!\" He took out his phone and cancelled the alarm. \"Shoot. I didn't mean for this to run so long. Meeting adjourned, everyone!\" \"But we have accomplished nothing,\" Athena pointed out. \"So pretty standard for one of our meetings,\" Hermes said. \"Don't care, beat it,\" Zeus said, then turned to leave. Poseidon hurried after him. \"Wait. Where are you going?\" \"To bang Lois Lane.\" \"But I thought Hera was Wonder Woman.\" Zeus furrowed his brow. \"I don't understand the question?\" Poseidon sighed and let Zeus leave without him. His tights were riding up something fierce and he wanted to get out of this stupid costume anyway.",

    "text": "Ye Xian dealt with crap all the live long cycle. Literally, she dealt with crap. Not Liance ship crap, course. When Xian was little, her Gran had always boomed loud. \"There's just too gorram much of it.\" But the small ships, yeah, she dealt with those, just as her Ma and her Gran had done in their time. The Ariel'd fly ship to ship in the fleet - raggle taggle bunch a ships as it was - collecting waste to feed to the worms, which made dirt as to be bartered for what was as needed. Always something needed. As her Gran had always said, \"Three things in life you can be sure of: death, taxes, and crap happens.\" She knew. She'd been there when the big crap had happened. On the last day in the Verse that Was, Gran'd been in her garden when the Reavers'd hit atmo over Persephone and set the sky on fire all to Hades. Gran liked to talk like that. Skies on fire. While Ma had been quick to explain that the sky hadn't actually caught on fire followed by an explanation of the physics involved, which as Xian had been six at the time had gone a mite over her head. Gran had ended up on one of the ships escaping the screaming world - that was Gran again with the metaphors - with just the clothes on her back, a hand trowel, Ma in her belly, and a box full a compost worms. Eisenia foetida, because Ma thought it was important that Xian knew that sort a thing. But that was then and this was sewage streaming out of the back end of the Bernadette to freeze in the Black. Xian tapped the controls on her Squito pack for some forward thrust and got in back of the catch bag. Once she squeezed it off, the frozen lump tumbled in the vacuum. She pushed and she prodded. She sweated a bucket inside her Vac suit. She sweated and she pushed at the big rough tumbling thing until she lined up with Ariel's air lock. She waited for Jun-Li to give her the go ahead, but got a whole lot of nothing. Finally Rhodopis came on and gave her the approval. Xian pushed inside and hit the controls. The com crackled from the bridge, cuz now that she was in, Jun-Li had to pipe up. \"Ma's going to be pissed. The fleet's pulled ahead while you floated around out there. Better finish storing it before she finds out you're not done.\" The com went silent. Wasn't like Jun-Li had to haul the crap around. It'd been different when Pa and Ma and Gran had been alive. When Xian's Pa had been Captain. But they'd all long since gone to the worms and Jin, Jun-Li's Ma, was Captain now. Rhodopis glared at the com box. \"Ain't right.\" The words just plain echoed around the crapper hold. Xian shrugged out of her suit and got the ice clamps. Rhodopis sighed. Between them, they hauled the lumpy thing across the deck and into the melter bin, which was nice of her. Rhodopis could have stayed in the engine room, but she was always a one to help out. When they were done, Xian sank to the floor and sat with her back up against the bin. Rested her head on her knees. \"Ain't right.\" Rhodopis started up again. Maybe if Xian ignored Rhodopis, she'd stop at ain't right this time. Xian wrapped her arms round her knees and said a real articulate, \"Hmmm.\" Put a lot grease in that hmmm, she did. She was too gorram tired to give a feh feh pi goh (baboon's ass crack) for the right and the ain't right of it. \"I said, it ain't right.\" Course, that was when Rhodopis poked her in the ribs with the butt of a Phillips from her tool belt. \"Why do you put up with the way Jun-Lee and Jin treat you? I gotta as long as Jin's got hold of my indenture for my engineer's schooling. But the moment they come due, I'm sliding.\" Rhodopis made a gesture with her hands to indicate just how slick that slide would be. \"But they order you around like you're a yi da tuo da bian (a big pile of shit). Seven hells, all the Barters she's got come off your back. You've got just as much right to this ship as she does. Wu was your Pa just as much as Jun-Li's.\" Xian sighed. \"It's not like I know how to pilot the ship.\" \"That's just cuz after your Ma and Pa died, she's traded all the Barts for learning so that tian di wu yowng (completely useless) daughter a hers could call herself a pilot and where'd that leave you?\" Xian muttered in no particular direction, \"Rhodopis, Jun-Li is my sister.\" Rhodopis thumped the bin with her palm in a bwoom of sound. \"Half sister. Serious like, I got no idea how your Pa kept his dick after screwing Jin.\" On that image, Xian dropped her head back to her knees. Jin's voice cracked on over the speakers. \"Xian! Where are you, you yi dwei da buen chuo roh (big stupid pile of stinking meat).\" Xian made her legs get up along with the rest of her. She tapped the com dangling off the wall. \"I'm in the crapper hold.\" \"Well, why aren't you on the bridge?\" Jin's voice crackled three separate kinds of venom. \"Jun-Li's made a course change and we're plumb three secs from where we need to be. Why weren't you up here making sure she didn't run us out past Fleet range? Xian could have had a lot of responses to that. She breathed in and asked her Ma to give her the strength to remember that Jin was a good person really. That folk was just folk. That she acted this way cuz she had a whole bin full of bugs in her bonnet over Ma and Pa and herself. Xian said, \"You want me up there?\" \"I want you back in time. Doing your job.\" Jin's voice was steel like a rusty coiled bit of metal that you just stepped on was steel, \"But I can't have that. Instead I have to tell you how to wipe yourself.\" She breathed in, which was never a good sign. \"I took care of it. Anyway, you were supposed to go over to the To'Han and get our barter for the 7-cycle. I gave you my list over breakfast.\" Xian did not ask how she was supposed to have been over on the To'Han and simultaneously perching on deck looking over Jun-Li's shoulder and getting a load from the Bernadette. Those kinds of questions never went well. She pealed back her work gloves and checked her chrono. \"Apec's already gone by on its rounds.\" \"Then you'll have to take the Mosquito.\" The com clicked off and Xian resisted the urge to hit her head against the bin. All it would do was hurt her head. Bugs in her bonnet; folk was folk; said thirty times quick in her head. Rhodopis broke her out of it when she grabbed Xian's wrist. \"You can't seriously be planning on going. Squito's just for short go rounds. Not crossing the whole damn fleet. I should know. I do the maintenance on the thing. Made some improves, but not much improves.\" Xian shrugged. She reflected that she shrugged a gorram lot. Now, there may as be the impression that Rhodopis shut up after that, but no. She talked about how if it was her, she wouldn't do it and if it was her she'd tell Jin where should take herself, being straight to all seven hells to have sex with the thousand demons as lived there. Since Rhodopis never said more than \"Yes, ma'am,\" or \"No, ma'am,\" to Jin, this was complete and utter da bian hua (crap talk) and Xian knew her crap, but it was nice to hear out loud. Even if neither of them would say it, because folk was folk. She let the words carry her as she suited back up. She thought of the way a trip to the To'Han could be nice. Course, that was when Rhodopis did a quick course change and pinched Xian on the arm. \"You sly dog.\" She chuckled in a low dirty sound. \"You going to go see your boy?\" Xian hunched her shoulders, purely to put on the suit. \"He's not my boy.\" Rhodopis laughed some more and said sing song, \"But you want him to be.\" She poked at Xian until she pushed her away, which got another round of laughter. \"Fine. Fine. Be like that. Well, if you ain't going to go wooing, then I'll give you a few streams to barter. Then at least they'll be some sorta porning going on.\" Xian asked a pretty redundant, \"More feet?\" Rhodopis pushed her thumbs into the wide strap of her tool belt. \"Yeah, got some streams of some real good ones with the red ribbon I picked up.\" Rhodopis had small feet. No, she had cute, perfect, tiny toed feet. Oddly enough, in a life where there was so little, there were people that would trade good Barts for streams of Rhodopis' feet and her walking around various places on those feet. Rhodopis laughed like she was always laughing. \"These are real good. Help pay off my indenture good.\" Xian shook her head and checked where the To'Han was in relation to the Ariel while Rhodopis got a memory stick. Together, they filled the dirt panniers and heaved them into the air lock. Now, as Rhodopis assured her, if Xian had the slightest sense of self preservation, she'd a felt afraid as she stepped out from the Ariel and watched it fly away from her. But no one ever called Xian smart, least not since Ma and Pa died. It was sorta peaceful like. The lights of the slow moving fleet all around as they made their way through the Black. All that was left of the Verse that Was. Heading to the Verse that Would Be. Reavers behind. Unterraformed systems ahead, or so the talking science heads said. For now, it was moving lights in the Black. But drifting in space while she got left behind weren't no time to get philosophical like. She tapped the Squito and wove her way forward through the lights of the fleet. Soon enough she was up under the long bridge line of the To'Han. She paid three Barts off her credit for a Mule to cart her panniers, which was a bargain. In her experience, gravity wasn't always a friend and her feet were already dragging. She made for the free market area on the Plaza deck. Spent a piece or two explaining to would be buyers that their offer prices weren't worth the smear on the bottom of her feet and everyone had a good old time. As she sorted out the dirt for her barters, she found a bright yellow worm cocoon in the dirt. It was dead now, what with the trip through the Black. But still bright and shiny. She slipped it in her pocket. Went through the Fiesta and Promenade decks bartering for the stuff on Jin's list. Made a trade on the Aloha deck for Rhodopis' foot porn and built up Rhodopis' credit. When Xian was done, she thought that she should get back to the Ariel. She could already hear Jin telling her all the ways she'd screwed up. How she should a done all of it. Course, whether she went back now or in an bit, Jin was sure to have a list of Xian's faults. May as well take a side trip. She found her feet going up three decks to the Arabian deck where the odd bits dealers were. She stopped at the Fazil brothers suit in 169. She slipped in past a group of asteroid wranglers with their clean shaved heads and spot burns around their eyes. She walked like she wasn't looking for anything. Abdullah was in the back of the stall whispering love poetry to a shiny metal something. She said, \"Hey.\" He dropped the part in a dull thud onto the worn carpet. \"Oh, Xian, it's... it's... hey.\" His face was down, but his lips was curved up She adjusted the strap on her pack. \"Sorry to startle you.\" He whispered, \"Like being startled by a song whose words you'd thought you'd forgotten.\" He looked at the ground. \"It's... I... well.... good to see you. It's been too long. I was going to send a wave. I was just... so there's this... next week. The all fleet fair. I was... I was wondering if you would... maybe, but of course, you wouldn't, but maybe...\" he took a deep breath, while Xian held hers. \"Abdullah, are you working out here on the parts again?\" Tall Salim bustled past a crowded shelf full shiny metal. \"Now what have we told you about that?\" His twin brother, Short Salim, said, \"We've told you that that talking to people is just not in your wheelhouse.\" \"Nope.\" Tall Salim tapped Abdullah between his eyes. \"That wheel, it don't even know where your housing is.\" \"Which is on the balcony not bothering customers.\" Short Salim looked at Xian, though that look was chest centric and not on her face at all. \"Such a lovely customer at that.\" He grinned. \"Now get.\" Abdalluh stood up in a slump. As he went round Tall Salim, he stumbled. Tall Salim laughed a sharp ratcheted sound. \"Always so gorram clumsy.\" Short Salim shoved Abdalluh between the shoulders. Xian wanted to say something. She looked at the hunch of Abdullah's shoulders as he went out the back door and it was too late for words. She said to no one she cared about, \"I've got to be going.\" As she went, she slipped the bright yellow cocoon from her pocket onto Abdullah's work table. She hoped he'd see it and smile. She went to the food stalls on the Lido deck. She lingered by Bawang Putih's, which had a painted picture of a magic crab over the old pizza sign. Last time she'd been on board, she and Abdullah had laughed over it. Must be magic, cuz there weren't no crab in the whole fleet. Good stew though. She waited over her bowl, but Abdullah didn't show. Feet really were dragging then. All the Apec ride back to the Ariel. Later, when she unpacked, she found a little windup monkey in her sack. She put it on her bunk with the monkey that she'd bought off of Abdullah two years past. She looked at them and smiled and when she looked at the ceiling over her bunk, she was seeing something else entirely. That carried her through a couple cycles. Mostly wondering what he'd wanted to ask her. Although, she hoped in her belly that she knew. One late cycle, they were all in the galley. Jun-Lee sat swishing her feet back and forth. She talking about all the things she'd do at the all fleet job fair that was coming up at the end of the 7-cycle. The word fair stuck like a scrap of food on the edge of Xian's mind. Course, Jun-Lee wasn't talking about getting a new job, because she and her Ma were rich by one whole ship. She wrinkled her nose at Xian, who pushed her protein mush from one side of the bowl to the other. Jun-Lee was going to meet up with other ship captains and technocrats and even Alliance ship officers. For some reason, Jun-Lee and Jin always called them by the name of the Verse that Was. As if they weren't in the Verse Right Now. She'd gotten to the part about dancing for the third time, when Xian said, \"I'd like to go too.\" She had never so much as gone to any of the fairs. This was her home. \"You.\" Jin wrinkled her nose like she was smelling something particular foul, which must be where Jun-Lee got the expression from. \"Why would you want to go to the Fair? Not like you've got a skill that's good for much other than what you've got right now.\" \"Besides,\" said Jun-Lee getting up and taking a little sniff, \"not like they'd want to get a whiff of you anyway.\" Xian felt something in her go all stiff and hard. \"I'm going to the fair.\" Rhodopis' eyes got wide as dinner plates and she was crushing a grin somewhere. \"No, you ain't.\" Jin slammed her bowl harder than necessary in the washer unit. \"You and Rhodopis need to stay here and watch the ship.\" Xian sat with her feet square on the ground and her shoulders hunched a little, like there was an acid leak. In the sleep cycle, she packed a duffel with her clothes. Unpacked it because she had a place here. This was her home. Morning of the fair, Jin pulled Xian's Vac suit out of the rack and put it in a Hold cubby. She put the Squito next to it on the floor. Locked it with her pulse key and there it was. A closed door in a large metal room. Jin didn't say nothing. Just looked at Xian as if asking her to say something. But Xian didn't. Really, wasn't much to say. This was her home. Ariel had been her Pa's ship. Gran, Ma, and Pa had all gone to the worms here. Everything in her life was here. She was needed. There was work to be done. Xian watched Jin and Jun-Li board the early cycle Apec with her show nothing face on. She did her rounds. She checked the acidity levels for each of the bins. She added bedding. She made other adjusts. She found herself sitting on the stairs staring at the locked cubby. Rhodopis sat down next to her. She put the dirt panniers on the floor with a dull thud. Everything felt dull as a really dull thing. Rhodopis gave an overly prolonged look at her chrono. \"Guess, Jin and Jun-Lee must be almost at the Magellan by now.\" Xian couldn't muster the energy to glare at Rhodopis. Rhodopis pulled a tool with a wide flat head from her tool belt. \"Oh, no,\" she said in a flat voice. She went over to a long panel on the floor. \"How horrible.\" She popped open the panel. \"There's been a power loss on all the Cubby doors.\" She did something with some wires. There was a loud pop and hiss. Rhodopis shrugged. \"Guess we should open it manually to, oh, make sure the stuff inside is still there.\" Hope floated sharp in Xian's chest. Together they turned the large wheel on the door. When they got it about half way open, it turned out that her Vac suit and the Squito were still inside. Xian touched them gently. Rhodopis picked up the panniers. \"I did a little something to these.\" Rhodopis tapped them. \"Now they'll keep,\" she waved a hand, \"something breathing, happy and warm for, you know, an hour or so trip through the Black.\" Xian took the panniers. She slid her hands along the outside of them. They felt cool and smooth under her fingertips. No different than always. Good piece heavier now. She looked around the hold for a long moment. She looked at the bins and ladders. The arching metal of the crapper hold's high ceiling. She went to the first bin. It was smaller than the others. Just large enough for a person to carry to a ship leaving a world behind. She transferred the contents to one of the panniers. She went to her room. She found her duffel already packed, trowel on top. She lingered in the room door and then went back inside. Grabbed her jumping monkeys and shoved them in on top of the trowel. Rhodopis helped her put on the suit and adjust the Squito's straps. As Xian went into the airlock, Rhodopis said, \"Now please, take this the right way. Don't come back.\" Xian said, \"Thank you.\" Rhodopis rolled her eyes. \"Look on Jin's face will be thanks enough,\" and she hit the button. The air vacuumed out of the air lock. Door opened on the Black and Xian suddenly thought that she shouldn't leave. She couldn't leave her Pa's ship. Her home. Her life. Sudden, clear as shiny, she remembered the first time she went into the Black. Gran's hand in hers. \"Don't worry, mei-mei (little one). I got you.\" While Ma spouted statistics and Pa muttered encouragement over the com. Xian stepped out into the Black. Trip across was quiet. Except for her thoughts. Doubts. Worries. Right thing. Wrong thing. She reached the Magellan and the voice on the com was more surprised than a 30-cycle of New Years to have someone ask to come aboard using a Squito. But they let her on. Gave her a wrist ident card and a locker assignment. She was off to the job fair. She went to the deck where ships with space were as looking for someone to take up a berth and share the load. Two steps into the hall, she saw Abdullah clutching a battered red tool box. His grin spread across his face. \"Hey.\" She kinda thought hers had taken over her face; it felt like it stretched her so wide. \"Hey.\" They said at the same time, \"I hoped you'd be here.\" Laughed nervous like. Happy like. Grinned. Which turned into a long kiss of smiling. When they broke, they took up hands and went to look for a place they could call their own. Epilogue Every rutting time Rhodopis went by Xian's old bunk, she got a big old rutting grin on her face. Even better was watching Jin spin on the stick up her ass trying to figure a way to cover for all the stuff she hadn't realized that Xian was doing. She tried to make Rhodopis go out into the Black with a second hand Squito that she bartered off some fool on the Lucky Lucy, but Rhodopis had a copy of her contract and it clearly stated that Rhodopis was an engineer. Not a farmer or a doctor or sanitation engineer. Much as Jin wanted to argue that last one. Jun-Li couldn't even work the Squito. Jin and Jun-Lee killed every worm in bin nine. Rhodopis saluted it as she went by. She was ass deep under the stabilizers, when the com waved an incoming. \"Ariel, this is the shuttle Trinidad, out of the Magellan, asking for permission to dock.\" By asking, the voice on the com clearly mean telling that they were docking. Permission or no. Rhodopis climbed out. Visit from the Trinidad could only mean a spot inspection. She hummed as she climbed out. Couldn't happen to a nicer captain. Jin rushed past her to the crapper hold. Her eyes raked Rhodopis up and down. \"Rhodopis, I can't be having Alliance representatives seeing my crew in this state. Make yourself invisible.\" Rhodopis rolled her eyes, because what Jin meant was don't talk to the inspectors, as if that ever worked. Still no way she was missing this. She climbed on top of bin ten just as the air lock hissed open and damn but twenty purple bellys streamed out while Jin was in mid fuss over Jun-Li's clothes. Followed by the Captain of the gorram Magellan, who looked shorter than in the waves. Still from Rhodopis' view point, his hair might be salt and pepper, but he had all of it. Jin bowed almost touching her forehead on the floor. \"You're most welcome to my little ship, Captain Amasis.\" Jin was putting enough sugar on her voice to make Rhodopis' teeth ache. \"Whatever tiny service we can provide for you would be our pleasure.\" Captain Amasis snapped his fingers in a real commander like way and one of the purple bellys held up a shiny pillow with two tiny shoes out of some kinda clear polymer on it. He said, in that voice that Rhodopis had always liked from the waves, like the rumble of a deep engine, \"I'm looking for the person who can wear these shoes.\" Jin bowed again while simultaneously waving at Jun-Lee. \"Of course.\" She turned in mid-bow to hiss at Jun-Li, \"Take off your shoes.\" But even with Jun-Li down to her bare feet, no amount of shoving would get her feet in those things. Jin tried next, but that was never going to work. One of the purple bellys said, \"Madam, perhaps there is someone else on your ship who could try?\" The stick up Jin's ass got straighter as she said, \"No, I'm so sorry. There is no one else.\" Amasis turned to one of the purple bellys. \"You'll have to start again. I want to find the source of that recording.\" The words were like a cold spark up and down Rhodopis' spine. She jumped down off the bin and practically yelled, \"Give me a try.\" She shucked off her boards and grinned. Cause those shoes fit like they were made for her because they had been. Amasis sighed in a long exhale, which was when Rhodopis decided to throw in for all she was worth. She leaned up to whisper in Amasis' ear, \"If you pay off my indenture papers, I might even consider walking in these shoes.\" A little lower then, a breath in his ear. \"These shoes were made for walking up your spine. Ain't that right?\" Amasis' answer was a quick, \"Lieutenant Aschenputtel, pay off this woman's indenture.\" Which was how Rhodopis ended up on the rutting Magellan. Now, it took her awhile to find something useful to do on that big ass ship of his, because Amasis was under the impression that her job would be shoe wearing. But the time for people who as did nothing but sit with their feet up was long ago and back in the Verse that Was. This was now. So, she broke him of that real quick. Took all of two steps, a grind with the tip of her big toe, and the spin of a lug wrench. Took a few steps adjusting the attitude of those high nose officers of his, but that's why she bought boots and a new tool belt for New Years. Flying as they was through the Black, Ye Xian had to decide just how she wanted to deal with the crap in her life and there was a rutting lot of crap. While Rhodopis wasn't much of a fairy godmother, but she was gorram good engineer. Which is to say, Cinderella is a pretty common story, but she'd have been better off selling foot porn what with those tiny feet a' hers.

      "While Ma had been quick to explain that the sky hadn't actually caught on fire followed by an explanation of the physics involved, which as Xian had been six at the time had gone a mite over her head.",
      "Gran had ended up on one of the ships escaping the screaming world - that was Gran again with the metaphors - with just the clothes on her back, a hand trowel, Ma in her belly, and a box full a compost worms.",
      "Eisenia foetida, because Ma thought it was important that Xian knew that sort a thing.",
      "But that was then and this was sewage streaming out of the back end of the Bernadette to freeze in the Black.",
      "Xian tapped the controls on her Squito pack for some forward thrust and got in back of the catch bag.",
      "Once she squeezed it off, the frozen lump tumbled in the vacuum.",

      "Rhodopis could have stayed in the engine room, but she was always a one to help out.",

      "\"I said, it ain't right.\"",
      "Course, that was when Rhodopis poked her in the ribs with the butt of a Phillips from her tool belt.",
      "\"Why do you put up with the way Jun-Lee and Jin treat you?",
      "I gotta as long as Jin's got hold of my indenture for my engineer's schooling.",
      "But the moment they come due, I'm sliding.\"",
      "Rhodopis made a gesture with her hands to indicate just how slick that slide would be.",
      "\"But they order you around like you're a yi da tuo da bian (a big pile of shit).",
      "Seven hells, all the Barters she's got come off your back.",
      "You've got just as much right to this ship as she does.",
      "Wu was your Pa just as much as Jun-Li's.\"",
      "Xian sighed.",
      "\"It's not like I know how to pilot the ship.\"",
      "\"That's just cuz after your Ma and Pa died, she's traded all the Barts for learning so that tian di wu yowng (completely useless) daughter a hers could call herself a pilot and where'd that leave you?\" Xian muttered in no particular direction, \"Rhodopis, Jun-Li is my sister.\"",
      "Rhodopis thumped the bin with her palm in a bwoom of sound.",
      "\"Half sister.",
      "Serious like, I got no idea how your Pa kept his dick after screwing Jin.\"",
      "On that image, Xian dropped her head back to her knees.",
      "Jin's voice cracked on over the speakers.",

      "\"I'm in the crapper hold.\"",
      "\"Well, why aren't you on the bridge?\" Jin's voice crackled three separate kinds of venom.",
      "\"Jun-Li's made a course change and we're plumb three secs from where we need to be.",
      "Why weren't you up here making sure she didn't run us out past Fleet range?",
      "Xian could have had a lot of responses to that.",
      "She breathed in and asked her Ma to give her the strength to remember that Jin was a good person really.",
      "That folk was just folk.",
      "That she acted this way cuz she had a whole bin full of bugs in her bonnet over Ma and Pa and herself.",
      "Xian said, \"You want me up there?\"",
      "\"I want you back in time.",
      "Doing your job.\"",
      "Jin's voice was steel like a rusty coiled bit of metal that you just stepped on was steel, \"But I can't have that.",
      "Instead I have to tell you how to wipe yourself.\"",
      "She breathed in, which was never a good sign.",
      "\"I took care of it.",
      "Anyway, you were supposed to go over to the To'Han and get our barter for the 7-cycle.",
      "I gave you my list over breakfast.\"",
      "Xian did not ask how she was supposed to have been over on the To'Han and simultaneously perching on deck looking over Jun-Li's shoulder and getting a load from the Bernadette.",
      "Those kinds of questions never went well.",
      "She pealed back her work gloves and checked her chrono.",
      "\"Apec's already gone by on its rounds.\"",
      "\"Then you'll have to take the Mosquito.\"",
      "The com clicked off and Xian resisted the urge to hit her head against the bin.",
      "All it would do was hurt her head.",
      "Bugs in her bonnet; folk was folk; said thirty times quick in her head.",
      "Rhodopis broke her out of it when she grabbed Xian's wrist.",
      "\"You can't seriously be planning on going.",
      "Squito's just for short go rounds.",
      "Not crossing the whole damn fleet.",
      "I should know.",
      "I do the maintenance on the thing.",
      "Made some improves, but not much improves.\"",
      "Xian shrugged.",
      "She reflected that she shrugged a gorram lot.",
      "Now, there may as be the impression that Rhodopis shut up after that, but no.",
      "She talked about how if it was her, she wouldn't do it and if it was her she'd tell Jin where should take herself, being straight to all seven hells to have sex with the thousand demons as lived there.",
      "Since Rhodopis never said more than \"Yes, ma'am,\" or \"No, ma'am,\" to Jin, this was complete and utter da bian hua (crap talk) and Xian knew her crap, but it was nice to hear out loud.",
      "Even if neither of them would say it, because folk was folk.",
      "She let the words carry her as she suited back up.",
      "She thought of the way a trip to the To'Han could be nice.",
      "Course, that was when Rhodopis did a quick course change and pinched Xian on the arm.",
      "\"You sly dog.\"",
      "She chuckled in a low dirty sound.",
      "\"You going to go see your boy?\" Xian hunched her shoulders, purely to put on the suit.",
      "\"He's not my boy.\"",
      "Rhodopis laughed some more and said sing song, \"But you want him to be.\"",
      "She poked at Xian until she pushed her away, which got another round of laughter.",
      "\"Fine.",
      "Fine.",
      "Be like that.",
      "Well, if you ain't going to go wooing, then I'll give you a few streams to barter.",
      "Then at least they'll be some sorta porning going on.\"",
      "Xian asked a pretty redundant, \"More feet?\" Rhodopis pushed her thumbs into the wide strap of her tool belt.",
      "\"Yeah, got some streams of some real good ones with the red ribbon I picked up.\"",
      "Rhodopis had small feet.",
      "No, she had cute, perfect, tiny toed feet.",
      "Oddly enough, in a life where there was so little, there were people that would trade good Barts for streams of Rhodopis' feet and her walking around various places on those feet.",
      "Rhodopis laughed like she was always laughing.",
      "\"These are real good.",
      "Help pay off my indenture good.\"",
      "Xian shook her head and checked where the To'Han was in relation to the Ariel while Rhodopis got a memory stick.",
      "Together, they filled the dirt panniers and heaved them into the air lock.",
      "Now, as Rhodopis assured her, if Xian had the slightest sense of self preservation, she'd a felt afraid as she stepped out from the Ariel and watched it fly away from her.",
      "But no one ever called Xian smart, least not since Ma and Pa died.",
      "It was sorta peaceful like.",
      "The lights of the slow moving fleet all around as they made their way through the Black.",
      "All that was left of the Verse that Was.",
      "Heading to the Verse that Would Be.",
      "Reavers behind.",
      "Unterraformed systems ahead, or so the talking science heads said.",
      "For now, it was moving lights in the Black.",
      "But drifting in space while she got left behind weren't no time to get philosophical like.",
      "She tapped the Squito and wove her way forward through the lights of the fleet.",
      "Soon enough she was up under the long bridge line of the To'Han.",
      "She paid three Barts off her credit for a Mule to cart her panniers, which was a bargain.",
      "In her experience, gravity wasn't always a friend and her feet were already dragging.",
      "She made for the free market area on the Plaza deck.",
      "Spent a piece or two explaining to would be buyers that their offer prices weren't worth the smear on the bottom of her feet and everyone had a good old time.",
      "As she sorted out the dirt for her barters, she found a bright yellow worm cocoon in the dirt.",
      "It was dead now, what with the trip through the Black.",
      "But still bright and shiny.",
      "She slipped it in her pocket.",
      "Went through the Fiesta and Promenade decks bartering for the stuff on Jin's list.",
      "Made a trade on the Aloha deck for Rhodopis' foot porn and built up Rhodopis' credit.",
      "When Xian was done, she thought that she should get back to the Ariel.",
      "She could already hear Jin telling her all the ways she'd screwed up.",
      "How she should a done all of it.",
      "Course, whether she went back now or in an bit, Jin was sure to have a list of Xian's faults.",
      "May as well take a side trip.",
      "She found her feet going up three decks to the Arabian deck where the odd bits dealers were.",
      "She stopped at the Fazil brothers suit in 169.",
      "She slipped in past a group of asteroid wranglers with their clean shaved heads and spot burns around their eyes.",
      "She walked like she wasn't looking for anything.",
      "Abdullah was in the back of the stall whispering love poetry to a shiny metal something.",
      "She said, \"Hey.\"",
      "He dropped the part in a dull thud onto the worn carpet.",
      "\"Oh, Xian, it's... it's... hey.\"",
      "His face was down, but his lips was curved up She adjusted the strap on her pack.",
      "\"Sorry to startle you.\"",
      "He whispered, \"Like being startled by a song whose words you'd thought you'd forgotten.\"",
      "He looked at the ground.",
      "\"It's... I... well.... good to see you.",
      "It's been too long.",
      "I was going to send a wave.",
      "I was just...",
      "so there's this... next week.",
      "The all fleet fair.",
      "I was...",
      "I was wondering if you would... maybe, but of course, you wouldn't, but maybe...\" he took a deep breath, while Xian held hers.",
      "\"Abdullah, are you working out here on the parts again?\"",
      "Tall Salim bustled past a crowded shelf full shiny metal.",
      "\"Now what have we told you about that?\"",
      "His twin brother, Short Salim, said, \"We've told you that that talking to people is just not in your wheelhouse.\"",
      "\"Nope.\"",
      "Tall Salim tapped Abdullah between his eyes.",
      "\"That wheel, it don't even know where your housing is.\"",
      "\"Which is on the balcony not bothering customers.\"",
      "Short Salim looked at Xian, though that look was chest centric and not on her face at all.",
      "\"Such a lovely customer at that.\"",
      "He grinned.",
      "\"Now get.\"",
      "Abdalluh stood up in a slump.",
      "As he went round Tall Salim, he stumbled.",
      "Tall Salim laughed a sharp ratcheted sound.",
      "\"Always so gorram clumsy.\"",
      "Short Salim shoved Abdalluh between the shoulders.",
      "Xian wanted to say something.",
      "She looked at the hunch of Abdullah's shoulders as he went out the back door and it was too late for words.",
      "She said to no one she cared about, \"I've got to be going.\"",
      "As she went, she slipped the bright yellow cocoon from her pocket onto Abdullah's work table.",
      "She hoped he'd see it and smile.",
      "She went to the food stalls on the Lido deck.",
      "She lingered by Bawang Putih's, which had a painted picture of a magic crab over the old pizza sign.",
      "Last time she'd been on board, she and Abdullah had laughed over it.",
      "Must be magic, cuz there weren't no crab in the whole fleet.",
      "Good stew though.",
      "She waited over her bowl, but Abdullah didn't show.",
      "Feet really were dragging then.",
      "All the Apec ride back to the Ariel.",
      "Later, when she unpacked, she found a little windup monkey in her sack.",
      "She put it on her bunk with the monkey that she'd bought off of Abdullah two years past.",
      "She looked at them and smiled and when she looked at the ceiling over her bunk, she was seeing something else entirely.",
      "That carried her through a couple cycles.",
      "Mostly wondering what he'd wanted to ask her.",
      "Although, she hoped in her belly that she knew.",
      "One late cycle, they were all in the galley.",
      "Jun-Lee sat swishing her feet back and forth.",
      "She talking about all the things she'd do at the all fleet job fair that was coming up at the end of the 7-cycle.",
      "The word fair stuck like a scrap of food on the edge of Xian's mind.",
      "Course, Jun-Lee wasn't talking about getting a new job, because she and her Ma were rich by one whole ship.",
      "She wrinkled her nose at Xian, who pushed her protein mush from one side of the bowl to the other.",
      "Jun-Lee was going to meet up with other ship captains and technocrats and even Alliance ship officers.",
      "For some reason, Jun-Lee and Jin always called them by the name of the Verse that Was.",
      "As if they weren't in the Verse Right Now.",
      "She'd gotten to the part about dancing for the third time, when Xian said, \"I'd like to go too.\"",
      "She had never so much as gone to any of the fairs.",
      "This was her home.",
      "\"You.\"",
      "Jin wrinkled her nose like she was smelling something particular foul, which must be where Jun-Lee got the expression from.",
      "\"Why would you want to go to the Fair?",
      "Not like you've got a skill that's good for much other than what you've got right now.\"",
      "\"Besides,\" said Jun-Lee getting up and taking a little sniff, \"not like they'd want to get a whiff of you anyway.\"",
      "Xian felt something in her go all stiff and hard.",
      "\"I'm going to the fair.\"",
      "Rhodopis' eyes got wide as dinner plates and she was crushing a grin somewhere.",
      "\"No, you ain't.\"",
      "Jin slammed her bowl harder than necessary in the washer unit.",
      "\"You and Rhodopis need to stay here and watch the ship.\"",
      "Xian sat with her feet square on the ground and her shoulders hunched a little, like there was an acid leak.",
      "In the sleep cycle, she packed a duffel with her clothes.",
      "Unpacked it because she had a place here.",
      "This was her home.",
      "Morning of the fair, Jin pulled Xian's Vac suit out of the rack and put it in a Hold cubby.",
      "She put the Squito next to it on the floor.",
      "Locked it with her pulse key and there it was.",
      "A closed door in a large metal room.",
      "Jin didn't say nothing.",
      "Just looked at Xian as if asking her to say something.",
      "But Xian didn't.",
      "Really, wasn't much to say.",
      "This was her home.",
      "Ariel had been her Pa's ship.",
      "Gran, Ma, and Pa had all gone to the worms here.",
      "Everything in her life was here.",
      "She was needed.",
      "There was work to be done.",
      "Xian watched Jin and Jun-Li board the early cycle Apec with her show nothing face on.",
      "She did her rounds.",
      "She checked the acidity levels for each of the bins.",
      "She added bedding.",
      "She made other adjusts.",
      "She found herself sitting on the stairs staring at the locked cubby.",
      "Rhodopis sat down next to her.",
      "She put the dirt panniers on the floor with a dull thud.",
      "Everything felt dull as a really dull thing.",
      "Rhodopis gave an overly prolonged look at her chrono.",
      "\"Guess, Jin and Jun-Lee must be almost at the Magellan by now.\"",
      "Xian couldn't muster the energy to glare at Rhodopis.",
      "Rhodopis pulled a tool with a wide flat head from her tool belt.",
      "\"Oh, no,\" she said in a flat voice.",
      "She went over to a long panel on the floor.",
      "\"How horrible.\"",
      "She popped open the panel.",
      "\"There's been a power loss on all the Cubby doors.\"",
      "She did something with some wires.",
      "There was a loud pop and hiss.",
      "Rhodopis shrugged.",
      "\"Guess we should open it manually to, oh, make sure the stuff inside is still there.\"",
      "Hope floated sharp in Xian's chest.",
      "Together they turned the large wheel on the door.",
      "When they got it about half way open, it turned out that her Vac suit and the Squito were still inside.",
      "Xian touched them gently.",
      "Rhodopis picked up the panniers.",
      "\"I did a little something to these.\"",
      "Rhodopis tapped them.",
      "\"Now they'll keep,\" she waved a hand, \"something breathing, happy and warm for, you know, an hour or so trip through the Black.\"",
      "Xian took the panniers.",
      "She slid her hands along the outside of them.",
      "They felt cool and smooth under her fingertips.",
      "No different than always.",
      "Good piece heavier now.",
      "She looked around the hold for a long moment.",
      "She looked at the bins and ladders.",
      "The arching metal of the crapper hold's high ceiling.",
      "She went to the first bin.",
      "It was smaller than the others.",
      "Just large enough for a person to carry to a ship leaving a world behind.",
      "She transferred the contents to one of the panniers.",
      "She went to her room.",
      "She found her duffel already packed, trowel on top.",
      "She lingered in the room door and then went back inside.",
      "Grabbed her jumping monkeys and shoved them in on top of the trowel.",
      "Rhodopis helped her put on the suit and adjust the Squito's straps.",
      "As Xian went into the airlock, Rhodopis said, \"Now please, take this the right way.",
      "Don't come back.\"",
      "Xian said, \"Thank you.\"",

      "Worries.",
      "Right thing.",
      "Wrong thing.",
      "She reached the Magellan and the voice on the com was more surprised than a 30-cycle of New Years to have someone ask to come aboard using a Squito.",
      "But they let her on.",
      "Gave her a wrist ident card and a locker assignment.",
      "She was off to the job fair.",
      "She went to the deck where ships with space were as looking for someone to take up a berth and share the load.",
      "Two steps into the hall, she saw Abdullah clutching a battered red tool box.",
      "His grin spread across his face.",
      "\"Hey.\"",

      "\"Hey.\"",

      "She tried to make Rhodopis go out into the Black with a second hand Squito that she bartered off some fool on the Lucky Lucy, but Rhodopis had a copy of her contract and it clearly stated that Rhodopis was an engineer.",
      "Not a farmer or a doctor or sanitation engineer.",
      "Much as Jin wanted to argue that last one.",
      "Jun-Li couldn't even work the Squito.",
      "Jin and Jun-Lee killed every worm in bin nine.",
      "Rhodopis saluted it as she went by.",
      "She was ass deep under the stabilizers, when the com waved an incoming.",
      "\"Ariel, this is the shuttle Trinidad, out of the Magellan, asking for permission to dock.\"",
      "By asking, the voice on the com clearly mean telling that they were docking.",
      "Permission or no. Rhodopis climbed out.",
      "Visit from the Trinidad could only mean a spot inspection.",
      "She hummed as she climbed out.",
      "Couldn't happen to a nicer captain.",
      "Jin rushed past her to the crapper hold.",
      "Her eyes raked Rhodopis up and down.",
      "\"Rhodopis, I can't be having Alliance representatives seeing my crew in this state.",
      "Make yourself invisible.\"",
      "Rhodopis rolled her eyes, because what Jin meant was don't talk to the inspectors, as if that ever worked.",
      "Still no way she was missing this.",
      "She climbed on top of bin ten just as the air lock hissed open and damn but twenty purple bellys streamed out while Jin was in mid fuss over Jun-Li's clothes.",
      "Followed by the Captain of the gorram Magellan, who looked shorter than in the waves.",
      "Still from Rhodopis' view point, his hair might be salt and pepper, but he had all of it.",
      "Jin bowed almost touching her forehead on the floor.",
      "\"You're most welcome to my little ship, Captain Amasis.\"",
      "Jin was putting enough sugar on her voice to make Rhodopis' teeth ache.",
      "\"Whatever tiny service we can provide for you would be our pleasure.\"",
      "Captain Amasis snapped his fingers in a real commander like way and one of the purple bellys held up a shiny pillow with two tiny shoes out of some kinda clear polymer on it.",
      "He said, in that voice that Rhodopis had always liked from the waves, like the rumble of a deep engine, \"I'm looking for the person who can wear these shoes.\"",
      "Jin bowed again while simultaneously waving at Jun-Lee.",
      "\"Of course.\"",
      "She turned in mid-bow to hiss at Jun-Li, \"Take off your shoes.\"",
      "But even with Jun-Li down to her bare feet, no amount of shoving would get her feet in those things.",
      "Jin tried next, but that was never going to work.",
      "One of the purple bellys said, \"Madam, perhaps there is someone else on your ship who could try?\"",
      "The stick up Jin's ass got straighter as she said, \"No, I'm so sorry.",
      "There is no one else.\"",
      "Amasis turned to one of the purple bellys.",
      "\"You'll have to start again.",
      "I want to find the source of that recording.\"",
      "The words were like a cold spark up and down Rhodopis' spine.",
      "She jumped down off the bin and practically yelled, \"Give me a try.\"",
      "She shucked off her boards and grinned.",
      "Cause those shoes fit like they were made for her because they had been.",
      "Amasis sighed in a long exhale, which was when Rhodopis decided to throw in for all she was worth.",
      "She leaned up to whisper in Amasis' ear, \"If you pay off my indenture papers, I might even consider walking in these shoes.\"",
      "A little lower then, a breath in his ear.",
      "\"These shoes were made for walking up your spine.",
      "Ain't that right?\" Amasis' answer was a quick, \"Lieutenant Aschenputtel, pay off this woman's indenture.\"",
      "Which was how Rhodopis ended up on the rutting Magellan.",
      "Now, it took her awhile to find something useful to do on that big ass ship of his, because Amasis was under the impression that her job would be shoe wearing.",
      "But the time for people who as did nothing but sit with their feet up was long ago and back in the Verse that Was.",
      "This was now.",
      "So, she broke him of that real quick.",
      "Took all of two steps, a grind with the tip of her big toe, and the spin of a lug wrench.",
      "Took a few steps adjusting the attitude of those high nose officers of his, but that's why she bought boots and a new tool belt for New Years.",
      "Flying as they was through the Black, Ye Xian had to decide just how she wanted to deal with the crap in her life and there was a rutting lot of crap.",
      "While Rhodopis wasn't much of a fairy godmother, but she was gorram good engineer.",
      "Which is to say, Cinderella is a pretty common story, but she'd have been better off selling foot porn what with those tiny feet a' hers.",

    "text": "Demeter was pissed. The angry kind of pissed, unfortunately, not the drunk kind of pissed, all though she fully intended to be the latter before the night was over--it was New Year's Eve, after all, and she had that right. (As she was a goddess, this did take some effort, but it was completely doable, and nothing was going to stop her from doing it tonight.) Olympians loved any excuse to party. Not that most of them needed an excuse, but over thousands of years and dozens of cultures, there were enough festivals, anniversaries, and holidays that pretty much every day afforded even the thinnest veneer of a \"reason,\" if one felt obligated to look for such a thing. There were always some days that required bigger celebrations than others, though which exactly depended heavily on the culture and mien of their current residence (apart from the solstices, which were constants). New Year's was currently one of the other big party days, though, and the size of the current celebration reflected that. But until she had a few dozen more glasses of wine in her, Demeter wasn't in much of a celebratory mood, and it was, as usual, all Hades' fault. Demeter had gone to the trouble of making sure it was all right for Persephone to join the festivities on Olympus for just one night even though it was the middle of winter, but Persephone had turned down her offer, saying she and Hades already had plans. Demeter had gone out into her garden and coaxed some narcissuses out of the ground just so she could step on them and grind them under her heel. Demeter loved all things green and growing but she was so furious at that moment she was willing to make an exception. The satisfaction was delicious, if fleeting, and afterwards she looked down at what was left of the little plant with more than a touch of regret. And now she was at the party and everyone was having a grand time except her. She threw back another glass of wine and decided what she really needed was to fuck somebody who hated Hades as much as she did. The problem was that there was no one who filled that particular qualification; Demeter was and always would be charter member and president of the We Hate Hades Club. She tried to think of people who might come close, though. The first name that popped into her mind was Apollo, but she wasn't drunk enough for that. Probably could not be drunk enough ever. (She remembered him showing up at her door with his stupid harp and his ridiculous lyric poetry hoping to woo Persephone. As if he could ever be good enough for her. As if anyone could ever be good enough for her. And then that... man had just shown up and stolen her away...) There was the sound of breaking glass. Demeter realized it was the one she'd held in her hand shattering as she squeezed her fist around it. She was not nearly drunk enough yet. That was when she noticed him: sitting on a couch making out with a nymph while Amphitrite pretended not to notice was Poseidon. He hated Hades. Or something close enough to hate anyway. Thinking of Poseidon made her think of Zeus. They were both viable options and easily enough seduced. She could tell Zeus and Hera had fought recently by the fractionally-further-turned-down corners of Hera's mouth. While Demeter helped herself to more wine and tried to decide between the two of them, her head started to swim a little. Good. She was getting closer to enough. She kept on drinking. This did have the unfortunate effect of causing decision-making to become increasingly difficult, though. That was when she realized: why choose? Why not enjoy both? Nobody had ever been able to convince her they hadn't hooked up with each other at least once, if not more. Oh, they denied it vehemently, but it just seemed like such an outlandish thing to consider otherwise, given both their personalities. Demeter had actually fantasized about what it would be like to have both at once. She'd thought about it a few times, in fact. Okay, more than a few times. Quite often. They were both amazing lovers; there was no way the experience of them together wouldn't be mind-blowing. She'd gone so far as to drop hints about it before but the timing had never been quite right. The timing was right now, though, she was absolutely sure of it. She'd never been more sure of anything in her long, long life, apart from that Hades was the scourge of all existence. She felt it in her very bones. She started making her way across the room, catching Zeus's eye as she passed and crooking a finger at him to follow. The floor lurched ever so slightly, and she had to concentrate to keep Poseidon in focus, but she made it to the couch and dispatched the interloping nymph easily enough. Things began to fade in earnest rapidly after that. When Demeter awoke the next morning, she was alone in her own bed. Bad sign. But also she was naked and the sheets were thrashed. Good signs. She struggled to recover her memories through the haze. There were flashes--a kiss here, a touch there, and quite a bit of ripping. Faces were hard to bring into focus, but fortunately, Demeter knew both of their bodies well enough that faces weren't a requirement to be sure about their identities. The touch of that solid ab, the slight taste of salt on her tongue, that was Poseidon for sure. The vague metallic scent of ozone, the stubborn refusal to be anywhere but on top, that was Zeus, guaranteed. Demeter grinned with satisfaction and stretched out on her bed. It would take a little effort and perhaps a visit to Mnemosyne to fill in all the blanks, but she felt confident she had accomplished one of her longest-standing goals. She waltzed through Olympus, mint and barley springing up in her wake despite the fact that the earth far below her feet was blanketed in snow. \"Someone's in a good mood this morning,\" Zeus remarked as he passed. \"Can't say I'm surprised, of course.\" \"Mm,\" Demeter purred. She was feeling generous enough to allow Zeus his oversized ego without a fight. \"Interesting I actually got to be there for a new sexual experience of yours. Well, as close to new as it's possible for you to have at this point, anyway.\" Zeus narrowed his eyes. \"What are you talking about?\" Demeter threw back her head and let out a hearty laugh. \"Well, I know it wasn't new for you to be with me, and of course it wasn't new for you to be with Poseidon, but both of us at once--\" A shadow passed over Zeus's face. \"That never happened.\" Demeter just laughed again. \"I'm serious,\" he said, the look in his eyes so intense it gave her pause. \"You and I were together last night. I saw you with Barnacle Head too, so I'm sure you had a piece of that as well, but it was not at the same time as me, that I guarantee.\" Demeter frowned, her good mood dimming, the plants wilting behind her. Come to think of it, while she could remember Zeus, and she could remember Poseidon, nothing in her fuzzy memory indicated both at once. Zeus suddenly grinned again. \"Still an excellent night, if the volume and multitude of your screams are anything to go by, and also by how many orgasms I gave you, which was a lot.\" With a look of sheer cocky satisfaction, he strolled on past her down the walkway, whistling. She hated to admit that he had a point. She had enjoyed herself, regardless. But she'd really wanted that menage-- Poseidon abruptly rounded a corner and nearly ran into Zeus. Demeter couldn't help but notice how he and Zeus both seemed to hesitate and--was it her imagination, or were they having trouble meeting one another's eyes? Unbidden, Demeter's grand feeling began to bloom in her chest once more. Maybe she hadn't been so mistaken after all.",

    "text": "It was a delicate diplomatic situation. Odin's family enjoyed the fruits of Loki's transgression, the gifts given by the dwarves in a way that might, in the right light, be called 'freely', and so the Allfather could hardly deny them the chance to save face. Loki had lied, and they had been shamed by it. If Odin tried to protect his wayward son now, all the realms would mutter that he could not control him. And if Loki Lie Smith was not under the control of Asgard, there was no knowing what trouble that might cause. Even knowing that this was the only thing he could do, Odin was wretchedly grateful when the thread pulled tight and the enchantment took hold and his winter child finally stopped screaming. Brokk and Eitiri, the dwarven smiths stood at the base of Hlidskjalf, watching Loki with hunger in their eyes. Loki's ragged breathing, from where he hung limp and unmoving between the two einherjar who held him, was the loudest sound in the hall. Thor finally stepped back, blood up to his wrists, looking heartbroken, and Loki's head hung loose against his chest. His hair hid his face. It hid the stark river of blood against his throat and the thin golden thread that crisscrossed his lips and kept him silent. But for the sound of his sobbing, shuddering breath, he might have been a corpse. Odin let the silence stretch out. See, he thought to the assembled multitude. See the consequences I will wreak on my own son. The justice I will dispense. And make this the last time I am called upon to do it. If this punishment could at last stick in the minds of the people... He became aware of a low whisper from the base of his throne, lower than sound, and two shadows standing behind the dwarves. \"Please be assured,\" said a silent voice, \"that this victory of yours will not go without punishment. You chose to go over his head after he outsmarted you, and that... That was graceless. Our revenge will be a long time coming, but don't you worry - it will come.\" Odin was too practised a hand to let anything show on his face, but he slid his eye down to the twin shadows and to Brokk and Eitiri's faces. They stood bolt-straight, facing forward. It was clear they had heard as well, but now somehow there was only one shadow beside their own. And the soft slap of sandals against the marble of the floor as a woman stepped out of the crowd into the centre of the hall. She was dark haired, tan skinned and wore flowing white. From Olympus, Odin's mind supplied, though he had never seen the woman before. There was a ripple of confusion through the watching Asgardians, but no one spoke as she approached the wrecked form of the Mischief Monger and knelt to wipe the blood from his chin. \"With your leave, Odin Allfather,\" she said without taking her eyes from Loki's face, \"I'll take the Lie Smith with me to tend his wounds away from Asgard.\" Odin narrowed his good eye. She had come a stranger into his hall, addressed him without obeisance, and planned to deny him the right to care for his own son. And though she asked permission, Odin suspected that she did not intend to abide by it. She had that same distant quality to her voice that Loki employed, a quality which made Odin feel that his words were spoken only for the sake of speaking. But at the sound of her voice Loki raised his head, and pulled his arm free of the einherjar to take her hand. None present could know that this woman wasn't in the employ of Asgard, and so Odin could be kind to his son. \"You have my leave,\" he said, and the woman allowed the crowd to believe that she had been waiting for his consent. The einherjar released Loki, and the woman took his weight. A man in a dark leather jerkin stepped out of nowhere to help her, and when Odin let his eye slip downwards the second shadow at Brokk and Eitiri's back was gone. He swept his gaze back along the crowd. \"As do you all. This audience is concluded. Masters Brokk and Eitiri, I hope you will continue to enjoy the hospitality of our hall.\" He said it in such a final voice as to discourage any reply but for the two of them to offer their thanks and leave. As the two strangers half-carried Loki from the hall, Thor reached out a hand to him. Loki flinched back from the touch and Odin forced himself not to look away. --- Eris and Autolycus brought him to a midnight forest, and what had probably been a temple in times forgotten. Autolycus went to open the heavy stone door, but Eris stopped him and looked to Loki - he was almost steady on his feet after the journey, and took a moment to straighten his clothes and brush the worst of the dried blood from his leather coat. He raked fingers through his hair until it lay flat, and rubbed a hand over his face. He presented himself silently to Eris, and she ran a gentle cooling thumb over both his eyelids. It was still obvious that he had cried, but now it was clear enough that he had tried to hide it so that no one would mention it. The thread was bright gold, not dulled at all by the drying blood along its length. It was pulled tight around his lips, stretching the skin around his mouth and squeezing his lips together. Bruises stained his skin from each dark oozing point where gold sank into his flesh, and the edges were beginning to swell. Unattended, the wounds would turn septic and swallow the thread under his skin. Eris' fingertips hovered without touching. Given the nod, Autolycus opened the door. A few dozen stone steps down, and Loki was walking with sure feet by the time they reached the bottom. Crowley was there, and Morgan le Fay and Reynard. They sat on stolen furniture, looking out of place around a sacrificial altar. At the sound from the stairs, Crowley called over, \"Did you get him?\" \"No,\" Autolycus replied easily. \"We travelled at our own peril into the heart of Asgard, spoke to Odin Allfather, and then forgot to bring Loki back with us.\" He snapped his fingers. \"Damn. This is embarrassing.\" Loki raised an eyebrow as he stepped past him into the circle of light, and with his derisive gaze on Autolycus he could pretend not to hear the sharp intake of breath at the sight of his stitches. \"Oh, my stars.\" A delighted voice floated down from the shadows at the ceiling. It was followed by Coyote, springing off the crumbling ivy-covered columns to land at Loki's feet. \"Silvertongue!\" he exclaimed in greeting. \"What have you done to yourself, you stupid bastard?\" Loki folded his arms with a deeply unimpressed look. What have I done? the look said. Coyote hoisted himself up onto his hind legs, placing his front feet on Loki's shoulders. \"I mean,\" the great dog grinned, \"I knew you had your self destructive tendencies, but--\" He dissolved into giggles, wheezing against Loki's chest until the Asgardian brushed him off with both arms. Coyote wound his body around Loki's ankles before standing up again. \"How did this one go?\" he asked, grinning. \"Let me guess - You were somehow clever enough to get everything you wanted, and still stupid enough to keep talking after that?\" Reynard tutted disapproval. \"An accurate description, Coyote,\" he said, \"If an unfair guess. We all know what happened.\" \"Oh, we know what happened,\" said Morgan, standing to walk her own little circuit around Loki. He pointedly didn't follow her with his eyes, opting instead to watch the ceiling with a look of supreme patience. \"I can't possibly allow you to cut my head off,\" she said, dropping her gentle brogue for an angular approximation of Loki's voice, \"because there was nothing in the agreement about cutting my neck! Honestly, how did you even get away with that one?\" Loki looked down at that one, gesturing incredulously at his mangled lips, is this 'getting away with it'? and by that time Crowley was advancing with an eager smirk. Before he could say anything, though, Reynard held up a paw. \"Now, I realise there's hours of material in this, but. The man is clearly in need of medical attention. Loki. What do you say to fifteen minutes' worth of concentrated mockery, and then we'll have those stitches out?\" It was a good offer, but Loki rolled his eyes and gestured, lower your expectations. Reynard smiled. Or, he showed off his sharp canines. \"Ten minutes.\" No chance. \"Five minutes, then,\" offered Reynard. Loki considered a moment, then inclined his head in assent. The fox clapped his paws together.\"Excellent. Well, that said, let me be the first to suggest that you have at last reached the inevitable conclusion of how much your family enjoys the sound of your voice!\" The flash of hurt in Loki's green eyes was just brief enough that those who had seen it could pretend they hadn't, especially with the way he theatrically clutched at his heart in its wake. \"I do have to say,\" laughed Morgan, \"just how lovely it is to get a word in edge-wise around you Loki. Now, let's talk about how you should have seen this coming. At length. You can feel free to jump in at any time...\" \"I, for one,\" put in Crowley, \"think his plan was a stroke of genius! I mean--\" he nudged Loki until the lie smith had to catch his balance, \"--your exit strategy needs some serious work, but there's merit here. Oh, you know what? I think I could sell a story like this to Puck's dear pal, Will Shakespeare. Hey, Loki, if you're happy for me to do that, just say absolutely nothing!\" He grinned like a bastard. Loki offered him an obscene hand gesture instead, and then Coyote was leaning all over his shoulders again to take the mockery somewhere vulgar and uncomfortable, and Autolycus was asking if he could poke the stitches -- if that's okay with you, just say nothing! Loki rolled his eyes and graded the taunts, try harder, Coyote; you wound me, Morgan, and when Eris joined in he turned wide, betrayed eyes on her until she laughed and announced, \"And, that's time, I think! Gentlemen, Morgana... Leave the poor man alone and let's heal his hurts.\" \"Wait, I had more!\" protested Autolycus, but Reynard cut him off. \"You'll have to take your chances mocking him when he can make reply, won't you?\" Loki huffed a silent involuntary laugh at the prospect, then groaned and clutched at his mouth when the smile caused the threads to cut open healing wounds. Coyote howled with laughter slightly louder than the situation merited, and Autolycus grinned widely. \"No, that's fine,\" he said. \"I'm done.\" Loki glared at the round of sniggering. \"Come then, Trickster,\" said Morgan at last, and the group sobered. \"Take a seat.\" She gestured him towards the altar, dark stone and heavy presence in the centre of the temple. There was a thin ragged blanket laid out there, with a shallow golden bowl of water and a tiny silver pair of scissors that suggested the involvement of a time traveller. Seeing his raised eyebrow, Morgan murmured, \"Our Doctor.\" Loki nodded understanding, and sat himself down, an offering on the blood soaked stone. The magic of the Celtic druids was so close to Seidr as made no difference, and Morgan could cut through the spellwork as easily as the golden thread. She seated herself on the edge of the altar with Loki, picked up the sewing scissors and ran fingertips along his jaw to tilt his face up. The group was quiet as she worked, save an occasional giggle from Coyote. She moved deftly, cutting each delicate thread with the scissors and whispering low words of power as she went. When half the stitches were cut, Loki held up a hand and twisted where he sat to spit a mouthful of gore into the water. He must have been holding it there since Odin's hall. When he turned back and nodded to Morgan to continue his face was impassive enough that, if his knuckles had been less white, no one would have guessed how bad the pain was. At last she set the scissors down. Loki opened and closed his mouth, just working his stiff jaw for a moment before she swiped the pad of her finger through the blood on his lips and pressed a quick kiss to them. Even as Loki winced, there was the odd ear-popping sensation in the air that signified a magic spell being worked. \"There,\" she said with satisfaction. \"The enchantment?\" Loki drew a shaky breath. \"...I didn't think he would truly do it,\" he whispered. His voice was hoarse, but that was easily attributed to the screaming rather than his bespelled throat. Eris cut through the tense quiet with a relieved laugh. \"Yes! Here,\" she slid onto the altar behind him and held her hand up to his mouth, \"eat this. Quickly, before you get blood all over it.\" Loki shrugged irritably, completely failing to dislodge her as she clung cheerfully around his neck, and managed to wrestle from her hand the bloodstained slice of apple she was trying to feed him. His mouth opened in surprise. \"Is this...?\" At Eris' gleeful nod he grinned widely, then grimaced as it stretched his wounded lips. He bit into the apple quickly. \"How did you even get this?\" he asked around the fruit. \"Autolycus stole it from the table in Asgard. My idea,\" crowed Coyote, and Autolycus sketched a smug bow. \"Any trickster knows that no one can keep their eyes off a beautiful woman with blood on her hands.\" He curled his body around the altar, his tail 'accidentally' swiping up Eris' toga. She aimed a kick his way and he laughed. \"Not that I needed it, mind,\" protested Autolycus. \"I stole the secret of invisibility from the gods; it doesn't matter how many people are looking at me!\" \"Oh, please.\" Eris rolled her eyes. \"We let you get away with invisibility, just to make you feel better about yourself.\" \"And it's not as though there's any real difficulty in stealing from an open table,\" Loki said, warming up as Idunn's apple closed the broken skin of his mouth. \"Next time you're in Asgard, try stealing Mjolnir - then I might concede that you're good.\" \"All right, all right!\" Autolycus affected an air of deep offense. \"You know that if anyone could steal that hammer it'd be me!\" \"Oh,\" laughed Loki, \"such big words! Maybe you would like to prove there's more to you than boasting?\" He accepted another slice of apple from Eris, and cut across Autolycus' bluster quietly, \"Thank you, though. You have my gratitude, truly.\" Autolycus stilled a moment, mouth still open on an agitated retort, and then he accepted the sentiment with grace. Loki smiled softly. \"It's all very well to know that this has ended with as little bloodshed as we could manage,\" said Reynard at last, \"But there is still the matter of the Smiths.\" \"Yes, yes,\" joined Coyote, \"The miniature malevolents! What shall we do with them?\" \"Whatever it is,\" said Crowley darkly, \"we make it hurt. If they didn't like how Loki treated them, they should have dealt with it themselves. Not run to tattle to his Daddy. That's an indignity we can't let pass.\" \"Hear, hear,\" said Morgan, halfway through vanishing the water in the font and the blood on her hands. \"They ought to know there are at least rules to this kind of thing.\" As a group, they all ignored the fact that Loki had broken more rules, and quicker, than the dwarves. \"I told them as much,\" said Eris, \"so they know we're coming. That gives us a while to plan.\" \"Decades, I should think,\" offered Reynard. \"Give them adequate time to reflect on what they might have done wrong.\" Crowley barked a short laugh. \"Let the bastards stew.\" Nobody expected Loki to contribute. He was the conduit by which they had all been wronged, and now it was the role of his friends to show the realms (or at least, those parts of the realms named Brokk and Eitiri) what happened when you crossed someone with friends like these. Turning a slice of apple over between his fingers, he let the familiar cadences of revenge schemes wash over him and lay himself comfortably down on the altar. Down out of sight at his waist, his knuckles brushed Eris', and she squeezed back.",

    "text": "Neal doesn't often talk about his family. Occasionally, he starts a sentence with when my father, but then he seems to realize it and cuts himself off. The only time Peter reacted was the first, just in case Neal ever decides to finish the thought. Peter used to think Neal had an unhappy childhood; why else would he have gone into crime, reinvented himself, and lie like breathing? He doesn't believe Neal was abused. Possibly neglected. Neal never mentions his mother, step-mother, foster mother, adopted mother, grandmother, aunt, or any woman at all who might have had a hand in raising him. But he does mention his father, sometimes, in relation to various cons he pulls for the FBI. --when my father--. Neal is fifteen minutes late to work. He doesn't answer his phone, either the loft's or his cell. Peter checks his anklet; it's still at the loft. Peter leaves without telling anyone.. Peter walks silently up the stairs, hearing laughter -- Neal's and a stranger's, light as a breeze. They're speaking a language Peter doesn't know. It sounds like it might be Greek. \"Come on in, Peter,\" Neal calls when he hits the landing. \"You're late,\" Peter announces, pushing open the door. He pauses once he catches sight of Neal's visitor: a man a few years younger than Neal, with hair a little lighter and eyes just as blue, with a smirk identical to Neal's I know something you don't know smirk. \"Agent Burke,\" the stranger says. \"Delighted to meet you.\" Neal grins. \"Peter, this is Herman, a very old friend of mine.\" Peter raises an eyebrow as 'Herman' grimaces. The name doesn't fit at all but Herman doesn't deny it. \"And Herman,\" Neal continues, clapping a hand onto Herman's shoulder, \"this is Peter, my most recent keeper.\" Peter holds out a hand and Herman grips it hard, his palm calloused and strong. \"Agent Burke,\" he says again, \"thank you.\". Neal seems so happy in Herman's presence that Peter simply can't force him into work today. After twenty minutes of Herman relating some of Neal's early attempts at painting and conning, he tells them he has to return to the office, and orders Neal to come in early tomorrow. Instead of shaking Peter's hand in goodbye, Herman pulls him into a massive hug and whispers in his ear, \"Thank you.\" Peter pulls away in bemusement, glancing at Neal, who only shrugs, and then Peter leaves.. (Neal takes his visitor to his favorite cafe in New York. He doesn't worry about his anklet; it will say he's in his loft until tomorrow, when he heads to work. He keeps calling his visitor Herman and they speak in ancient Greek, the language his father taught him in the cradle, when he whispered about Apollo's cattle and the lyre. \"He seems like a good man, kiddo,\" Herman says, sipping his lemonade. \"I approve.\" Neal grins at him and recommends the chocolate chip waffles.). when my father charmed the gods, he played a great con. he told me I can do better.. Neal walks into Peter's office whistling, flipping his hat in his hands, and he looks so happy, so young. Peter can't help smiling at him. The smile he gets back is brilliant, one he's never seen before. Later, at the private art gallery that's missing a painting (The Cattle of Apollon, by an artist Peter's never heard of), Neal says, \"My father would've like you, Peter.\" Peter takes that as a compliment. \"Papa!\" Parker called, running over to the slight brunet with bright blue eyes. Title: stories and bloodlines Fandom: Leverage/mythology Disclaimer: not my characters Warnings: future!fic Pairings: implied Hardison/Parker Rating: PGWordcount: 335 Point of view: third Prompt: Leverage; team; turns out everyone but Nate are actually mythological figures in disguise. \"Papa!\" Parker called, running over to the slight brunet with bright blue eyes. Nate raised a brow as the man turned and scooped Parker into a massive hug, swinging her around with a laugh. \"Darling!\" he replied, giving her a kiss on the forehead. \"I'm gone for a few years and you grow up. Ach, you children.\" \"Gonna introduce us?\" Hardison asked, sounding somewhere between jealous and annoyed. The stranger (and 'Papa'? really?) smirked. Parker said, \"This is my grandpa Hermes.\" \"Herman,\" he added quickly. \"Call me Herman.\" Hardison stiffened, trying to stifle a hiss. Sophie smiled elegantly and took 'Herman's hand. \"Wonderful to meet you,\" she purred. \"Parker's said nothing about you.\" Eliot simply bared his teeth in what couldn't ever be called a smile. Herman raised Sophie's hand to his lips and said, \"Enchanted.\" He released her hand and met her eyes. \"Didn't I once know you as Epona?\" Another smile, this one a slight degree above Arctic. Nate tried to remember if any of Sophie's identities had ever been 'Epona' and couldn't think of one. \"That would've been a very long time ago, Herman,\" Sophie said. She took his arm and turned them towards a table, saying, \"Now, Herman, you're going to buy us all a drink and tell us why you left Parker in the American foster-care system if you are, in fact, her grandfather.\" Nate shook his head, wondering if everyone else had gone mad as Hardison added, \"And then you're gonna teach me a few tricks, y'hear, Herman? There's a spider I gotta skip a few levels of badass to impress.\" Eliot cut in between Sophie and Herman, seeming much much larger for a moment. \"Explanation better be good, too,\" he said, and it sounded just like a growl. Herman threw a glance at Parker. She grinned and waved. Nate wanted a whiskey, but his team would never let him have one, so he simply sat down at the table and waited for the world to make sense again.",

    "text": "What many of his mortal lovers hadn't understood was this: Poseidon is the ocean. He is the depths and the tempests, the salt and the roar, the shallows and all the creatures of the water. What many of his mortal lovers hadn't been able to handle was this: he would never be fully theirs, never live on land, never attend functions or respond to any name but God of the Sea. He saved Sally's life when her sailboat went down, but only out of boredom. And as soon as she awoke and realized she still lived, she was demanding answers. No mortal had spoken to him so since Odysseus. He returned Sally to the land and stayed with her for almost a year. He tried to divide his attention equally, but he knew the ocean suffered. The moment Sally told him that she carried his child, he knew the choice had been made. He loved her as he had never loved another, and offered her godhood -- she said no. She did not want to live forever, or hold lives in her hand. She simply wanted to live, do her best to make a positive difference on the world, and then -- when the time came -- die and move on to whatever came next. And Poseidon, for the first time in his existence, wanted the same. He kissed her and prepared to cast aside all trappings of God of the Sea, and then Zeus reached down and pulled him away. Poseidon did not speak to his brother for fifteen years. He watched Sally from afar, saw her fading by the day, tired and weary and so much older than when he'd last kissed her. And Percy, his son, the youngest and most beloved of all his children... Percy, he saw, had his father's temper, but he hoped the boy had his mother's heart. And though Zeus declared he could not talk to the child, Poseidon is the ocean, and water is everywhere. Once the true lightning thief was caught, once the mess was cleared up, Poseidon would talk to Zeus, convince some of the others, have the ban lifted. He needed to hold Sally again, to kiss her at least once more. She was mortal, and mortals lived distressingly short lives. She wouldn't become a god and he wouldn't become human, but there were still a good number of years left in her life.",

But he does not want Aphrodite of the golden girdle, who flirts with everything, or Demeter of the ripe grain, who so desires power, or any of the flitting, brainless nymphs who seem to exist only to flee or fuck the gods. And he certainly does not want a mortal wife, because a mortal wife - barring Zeus's intervention - would die, and even Zeus's intervention is not perfect - Eos's grasshopper certainly proves that. A dead wife, a shade among the shades, would be no use at all. No, Hades only wants one woman: nameless Kore, strong-minded and beautiful, who follows her mother like a shadow and watches her mother like a hawk, who wanders alone in the meadows with flowers blooming from her footsteps, who - of all the gods - smiles when she sees Hades approaching. He does not speak to her before he takes her - such would be to give her so-protective mother warning. But when he swoops her up in his arms, she does not scream, only leans back against his chest and waits until the chariot comes to a halt in the dark halls of the dead. When she steps from the chariot, white flowers spring from her footsteps, and she smiles. When he welcomes her to the Underworld, she laughs. And when he tells her she is safe here, that he will not touch her unless it pleases her - because kidnapping aside, Hades has always tried to be as little as possible like his brothers - she kisses him. She bears him to the ground, there on the carpet of white flowers where nothing else has ever grown, and for a moment he is shocked, because this is not how young goddesses (except perhaps Aphrodite) behave. And then he is glad, fiercely glad, because this girl, this Kore who needs a new name, is everything he hoped she would be, and he kisses her and rolls her over, her arms wrapped tight around him and her legs opening beneath him and her lips warm against his, and knows that she will be his queen, not merely by his will but by her own. She is inexperienced - she could hardly have had a lover when her mother was so close, so watchful - but she learns fast, and she is unafraid. Her hands are warm when she touches him, as they shove his robes aside and tear her gown from her, and she looks at him with desire, not with terror. He likes it. She is not afraid when he strokes gently down her body, over full breasts and slim waist to touch gently between her spread legs; she is wet and waiting, and when he smiles she kisses him, pulling him close and wrapping her legs around his hips, and he sinks into her so easily, and they are one. Where her virgin blood was spilled - willingly and gladly - flowers grow that are seen nowhere else in realms mortal or divine, and they have made a garden of that spot, where no one goes but Hades and his deadly queen, Persephone.",

    "text": "Hades does not change: he is the god of the Underworld, of dark places and of the dead, and the dead are not known to change, after all. But Persephone has learned to appreciate this particular aspect of her husband, for one reason: his affection, like all else about him, is constant. It does not matter that she leaves him each spring; when she returns each autumn, the love in his eyes shines just as bright. It does not matter that when she leaves she is a woman in the fullness of her beauty and when she returns she is Kore again, slender maiden of the upper world; he desires her just the same. His hands never lose their gentleness where he touches her sides, her breasts, the spread paleness of her thighs. His lips never lose their unexpected warmth when he kisses her, eyelids and lips and down her body to her secret places. Other men - other gods - might grow weary of fidelity. Zeus loses interest in his conquests as soon as he has conquered them; Apollo forgets the last nymph as soon as he sees the next, and mourns but lightly for his slain lovers. But Hades - cold Hades - ah, he will never betray her, never turn from her for another woman or a beautiful boy. Each time she returns, he smiles as though she is the only light he will ever need, spreads her out on clean sheets on their shared bed and makes her cry out in pleasure many times before he takes his own. And she - she is in no wise fickle. There are beautiful boys aboveground, to be sure, and sometimes she watches them and smiles, but there is but one man for her, has been since she first tasted pomegranate (and his kisses still taste of its sweet juice), and she waits eagerly each year for the day when her mother sighs and lets her go, and she can run swift and beautiful down the dark passageways to where her husband, patient and beloved, waits.",

    "text": "The place should have been lightless, darker than any place on Earth, but it was not. Sometimes Persephone wondered why that bothered her so. She had never found the source of the thin and weary glow that allowed her to gaze upon her uncle-husband's realm. It was simply there, wan and comfortless, barely able to cast shadows. How long had she been here? There was no way of knowing: night or day made no difference to this realm. She had been sitting on this bench for hours - or days? - trying to remember what sunlight was like, or flowers, or her mother's voice. Sounds were all muffled and toneless as well, but she knew his footstep, and turned slowly to face him. He was so like her honored father and yet so unlike. Zeus wore his passions in his features, and Hades did not - if indeed he had any such feelings. His beard and hair were black where his brother's were white. He wore a close-fitting inner robe and a loose outer garment, neither of any discernible color. \"My dear wife,\" he said. \"My lord.\" \"Come with me, if you would.\" In fact, she would rather not, but what else would she do if she did not accompany him? She rose slowly from her seat and followed. They walked for some time. It might have been a long while, or perhaps it was not. All the stony walls and murky spaces seemed the same to her until suddenly, Persephone saw light. Before her was a small, round cavern, lined with flowing white columns of stone, brightened by a score or more of small flames. Her breath caught in her throat: they were flowers. Their petals were delicately thin, white, and veined with light, cupped like those of the crocus, and at the heart of each was a faint rosy glow. They had no leaves but seemed to be growing directly from the pale stone. She touched one, and it was warm. Its petals were stiff and stronger than they looked. Sometimes its light would dim faintly, only to return in full strength. \"They will close their petals and become dimmer when it is night above, and they will open again when Eos brings the dawn,\" said Hades. \"I do not know how long they will last. They do not seem to go to seed, but they will crumble to dust if they are plucked. Do they please you?\" She nodded, speechless. \"Did they simply grow here?\" she asked, at last. \"They did not,\" said Hades. \"I made them to grow.\" \"How?\" He was silent until she turned to look at him: \"Like this.\" And with his strong hands, he tore his robe asunder across his broad chest, and scored his flawless skin with his nails until the blood ran red in the faint light. Then he flicked his bloody fingers at the rock, so that the droplets spattered the white stone. Faint wisps of cloud rose like steam, and then from each stain grew a slender white bud, streaked with red veins faintly glowing. As Persephone watched, the veins shone brighter until their light was as strong as that of their elder sisters, and the only trace of Hades' blood was the faint blush at the center of each. She knotted her fingers together, trying not to feel what bubbled up within her heart: pity, awe, even some gratitude. \"Why would you do such a thing?\" \"A vow stands eternal between myself and your father, my brother. But does it seem so strange to you that I would hope that you would become content to be here, with me?\" \"I never will!\" she said \"You stole me from everything I loved and forced yourself upon me.\" \"Then you may carve my flesh yourself, and have as much of my blood as you will to create a garden more splendid than any growing now in the world above. For you have confessed that these flowers please you, and if my person will not do that for you, then you may have my heart's blood instead.\" \"I cannot destroy you - can I?\" \"No, you cannot. But you can cause me pain, over and over, until it is time for you to return to your mother once more. And then, when you return to me, you may do it all over again - for all time, if that is your desire. Take your due: your nails are as sharp as mine.\" Blood still ran in sluggish rivers over his skin. She dipped the tip of one finger into it, and then another, until every fingertip was shining red. She turned and touched the stone with his blood and watched as the strange buds rose from the hard surface. But the red hue of these did not fade, and they glowed like coals. And for the first time since she had come to the Underworld, Persephone wept. He said no word and did not touch her, but she knew he was still there. When at last her tears ran dry, she saw that all the little flowers were closing their petals. \"Night comes,\" said Hades. \"It will return three and thirty times before you rise to the world above. Will you come back to the palace with me now?\" \"No,\" she whispered. \"Not tonight.\" He bowed his head to her, gravely. Already the wound on his chest was healing, but he had promised she could tear it open again. \"Until tomorrow, then.\" She watched him go, feeling oddly weightless and cleansed. Tomorrow. There would be a morning, and she would know it was tomorrow. And then there would be another, and another, and the days would pass. Persephone lay down on the smooth stone, bathed in the soft light of the flowers that had grown from the blood of the Host of the Multitudes, and slept.

    "text": "The slopes of the little valley were thick with wildflowers, with cyclamen, with lilies, with bellflowers and anemones. There was thyme where the ground was dry, and watermint down by the stream, and always and everywhere the poppies, their petals gold and tawny and red beneath the sun. Callirhoe's hair was gold and tawny as well, and her lips were red and just the least bit swollen with kisses. Her skin was golden and speckled with golden freckles, and Persephone's hands looked as white as the lily of the valley where they clutched Callirhoe's shoulders and pulled her up to be kissed again. \"I could kiss you all the day long,\" said Persephone. \"Would you let me do that?\" \"There's more to life than kisses, darling,\" said Callirhoe, with a grin like a vixen's. \"Oh, really?\" Persephone leaned all her weight on the other girl, her black hair flowing over the sweet curves and the slender neck, and Callirhoe laughed and rolled them both over on the soft grasses, and pinned Persephone in turn. \"There's this as well,\" said Callirhoe, and bit Persephone's milk-white shoulder, sucking greedily. Persephone yelped, and tried to buck the other girl off. They wrestled, rolling and tumbling down the slope to the stream. \"We're almost in the water!\" cried Persephone, and Callirhoe laughed. \"What - is that a problem?\" \"Not all of us are Okeanides!\" \"A little water will refresh you, O Princess of Flowers.\" Callirhoe rose up from her friend's embrace and stepped into the shining stream instead, trading warm flesh for cool waters. The breeze flung her hair about, and the current flowed around her knees. Persephone licked her lips, feeling the places where Callirhoe had nipped them. She sat on the bank and and dabbled her toes in the cold flow. Callirhoe flicked a drop of water at her. \"Stop that!\" \"You should wash.\" \"I don't need to.\" And it was so: a daughter of Zeus need never worry about becoming grubby or sweat-stained. Callirhoe made a rude noise and sat down in the water, so that her chin was just above the rippling surface and her hair floated and writhed with the current. She watched as Persephone stood and walked back up the slope, gathering poppies as she went, and then returned and began to weave them into a wreath. \"And who will wear that?\" asked Callirhoe. \"I mean it for you.\" \"It would suit you more.\" Persephone looked at Callirhoe's hair, darkened now with water, and frowned. Callirhoe rose out of the stream, scattering droplets that flared in the sun like crystals, and ran up the slope herself. She returned a moment later with an armful of lilies of the valley. They sat together, weaving the fresh green stems, content and busy. Soon the snowy lilies circled Callirhoe's golden head and the yellow and red poppies shone against Persephone's midnight hair. \"Do you hear that?\" said Callirhoe, suddenly. Persephone lifted her head. \"I hear your sister Galaxaure. And is that Ianthe?\" \"So it is - and I think I hear Pallas herself. Should we go and join them?\" \"Whatever you like, sweetness.\" They draped each other in the gowns they had discarded earlier and walked arm in arm over the poppy-clad shoulder of the hill. There before them was a lovely site: more than a score of the daughters of Olympus and the nymphs of earth and wood and stream, gathering flowers, singing, dancing, and playing ball. A joyous shout greeted the appearance of the two friends, and the goddess Artemis came forth to greet them. \"Well met, my garlanded maidens... for I see you are maidens yet!\" The virgin goddess looked at them sharply, then smiled and held out her hands. Callirhoe took the left, and Persephone the right, and they skipped and danced to meet the others. This slope was blanketed with crocus, and a little spring bubbled out of the rock, and close by grew a cluster of the most beautiful narcissus that Persephone had ever seen. Leaving Callirhoe to greet her sisters, Persephone walked over the where the sweet waters bubbled out from the rock. The flowers were large and golden, and one amongst them, the tallest of all, seemed to glow with the same warm shade as Callirhoe's hair. The breeze died, and the voices of the playful goddesses and nymphs seemed faint and far away. Persephone knelt among the golden blossoms and reached out to pluck the tallest one.

The Summerlord calls to her, and she tarries a bit before she goes to meet him. The grass still crunches green under her feet, but her power is retreating, sinking beneath the earth. Winter will be long this year and bitter, she guesses. More souls for Hades' realm. More fuel for the spring. \"You are late,\" he says, when she comes to him. \"Are you still in such a hurry, my lord?\" He smiles, taking her in his arms, tanned dark by the summer sun. \"I don't have much time left, do I? Better to spend it with you, Daughter of the Earth.\" She returns his smile. \"You'll be mine forever soon,\" she says. He is handsome this year; the gods do not always favor her so. His curls are thick and dark, and his eyes are the blue of the sea. \"Be mine,\" he says, \"for just a little while longer.\" \"Of course,\" she says, and lets him pull her down to the warm surface of the earth. Hades is always cold and dark. Persephone shivers as she walks onto the barge. She opens her palm and shows Charon the toll for the Summerlord; the five pomegranate seeds her maidens had taken from his stomach, after the sacrifice. As she had suspected, the winter will be long and bitter. Charon nods in understanding. The Summerlord will already be in her quarters, ready to serve, his power at her disposal. She has other duties now. Hades smiles when she comes to his chamber. \"You always bring the light to my realm,\" he says, touching her dark, thick hair. \"How is this year's sacrifice?\" \"Handsome,\" she answers. They are far past jealousies now. \"He'll do well.\" He had died with a smile on his face, the maidens said. \"Do you remember?\" Hades asks. \"When we first met?\" She raises her eyebrow. \"How could I forget?\" One moment there had been sunlight, the next darkness, and the pounding of hooves. He had not touched her, though, until the seeds slipped past her lips. Now you are mine, he had said, and flowers will finally bloom in Elysium. I don't have enough power to make anything grow here, she had said. I am sure, he had answered, that we can find a solution. Persephone smiles now, and lets her husband embrace her.",

    "text": "Never bury my bones apart from yours Achilles, Let them lie together...... Take some joy in the tears that numb the heart. Homer: The Iliad, 23:100-101 + 116 So lays the violent hunter, spread-eagled across the bloodied shield, a tribute and a warning all at once. Beside him lay fallen comrades, less loved by the one who matters, envied by their juniors, all spent in the hour of death. Their fights had been long; their struggles longer. Life lasts fleetingly, for those who seek glory. By his slanted head, gleaming with the cold sweat of death, lingers the war helmet, rocking slightly under the pressure of the retreating army. Their battle is won, and the sufferance bearers remain. His limbs are bared, trembling with the last strength of life, his will and courage knotted with the roaring pain. In his chest, gasping and fruitless, is his mark of death, a princely spear that sought a different target. It shakes on the dusk air, in a pounding duality with his horrific cries, his manly gasp and boyish whimper. The glut of death becomes dimmed, his surroundings all but lost: he cries for himself, for the shame and the inertia of pain. He is losing the final battle, fought deep within his body, and his tears are stained with blood. Too far, too long away, crouches the one whose name he calls, the general and the taciturn soldier - too far, too long. He guards his thoughts too cleverly, but his eyes rest heavy on the empty armour stand in the tent's corner. Not too long now, he is certain, and the heralds will return with messages. They will call his name in breathless triumph, and his act of defiance will melt to joy. \"Achilles,\" they will spring about the tent door, \"Achilles we have pushed their defences.\" He crumbles grass blades in his well-worn palm, and sighs. Hope, he reflects, is the biggest killer of them all. By the field's edge, all signs of dusk melted into greyscale gurgles for life; his bearer of trials, his steadfast shadow, his own comrade - lies beaten in the dust of war. Breath comes sparser now, and shallow to hear; those comrades who had survived are now lost in his pitiful sobs, no more heroic than the sullen coward. He begs for death and, with steps of molten lead, the bravest descend with welcome comfort. Beyond the darkness, there is no more pain, only life's longest journey into death. They bind his hair in fettered ribbons, woven carefully through bloodied locks, and his worn body is covered with a stranger's chlamys, red for war and courage. The softest hands rest upon his temples and he is assured of his fate beyond that field - eternally, the most loved. His words are no more than a child's first attempts at speech, but the red tears that blot the dust beneath him are straight from the soul, his strangled eyes plead for one voice only. One voice, one man, one hero - all but deafened to the bitter turn that the battle has taken, unknowing in his distance. He reclines upon the blanketed floor, restless in his heart and eager for news. \"Lord there is nothing,\" he could almost hear their reply, \"nothing more to do but retreat.\" It would be a well-suited end to the battle - and yet, already Achilles is a slave to regret. The missing armour from the stand ought to be resting upon his shoulders and yet... it had been placed on the unready form of his heart's brother. Achilles could easily have cried for anger, if it were not for hope, damned hope... Hope had fled them far on false wings, and for its deception, Achilles would reap only loss. On the killing fields, more red than grassed, his own Patroclus' finest hour was one of bitterness and sickness. Antilochus, out of respect and propriety, takes the boy's fragile life into his own soul, and ends it before the death shivers take him in stark pain. Better for the Boatman to greet him sane, than to have him approach half-wild with the crippling waves of agony. In his splintered chest, nothing stirs. Patroclus, tricked and slain, lays dead. \"He was brave,\" Antilochus intones, \"when it mattered most. He was Achilles' right hand, and served his honour well. He is Achilles, forever now.\" His heart weighs more than it ever has as he trudges the lonely road to the ships by the sea's edge, a world away from the killing fields, to where Achilles, tempestuous and choleric Achilles, expects his friend's return. No more, Antilochus sighs, no more will hope serve him well. By the waiting boats, Achilles' eyes are lowered in shame as he bears the news, great shackles of remorse overtake his stern body. Antilochus bows his own head by the blanketed floor, fearful of the lusty grief that wells behind Achilles' measured eyes. His roars of deceit and horror are mere continuations of Patroclus', his hands grappling with his glistening hair as he curses his own wilfulness. Achilles, no more the brave Achilles - whatever battles are fought hence, they shall be for Patroclus, in Patroclus' name, a treaty to the warring grief within Achilles. For Patroclus, anything for Patroclus - and Antilochus can abide no more of such hopeless sorrow. His darkened hair is matted with his own tears, and a fair number of Achilles' too, all spent in loss for the brave dead boy. Antilochus kneels back, takes the grieved soldier's hands in his, and awaits the storms of madness. \"I shouldn't have,\" and \"if only...\" comes the mantra from Achilles' cursed lips, a traitor to his own heart, bowing his spine to the weight of such a loved one's death. Brave Patroclus, only Patroclus, my Patroclus - Patroclus, it will all be for Patroclus now, all for him - until Antilochus, most loyal, can no longer bear to hear such portents of despair. Hope, which had before deceived them, was now dispersed altogether. His restless feet bear him back to Patroclus, drawn to him for Achilles' sake, and to where bravest Ajax is fighting the killer's kin to protect the fallen boy. For Achilles, Antilochus knows they must soldier for Achilles now. They must return the beloved's body, deliver Brave Patroclus from the beastly Trojans, and Antilochus is loath to snap the spell of grief that has set upon Achilles. His eyes are slick ice, watching with clear broken-heartedness, following behind with the dizzy insecurities that stem from the greatest suffering. They'll not dishonour him twice, snarls Achilles, not while I draw breath. As they approach the body, held on all sides by fervent Argives, Antilochus stands back, stands apart; he cannot bear to approach once more the blood-lost body, or be witness to the dirge that has been fraying Achilles' mind. Achilles - oh, how Antilochus would weep for Achilles if only time allowed it - wanders into the field no more armed than he had been in the first instance, no more protected than his dearest Patroclus. An easy target though he is, the Trojans stand back, guarded and fearful of the wrath that bubbles beneath the surface as Achilles throws himself upon the boy. Brave Patroclus, only Patroclus, my Patroclus... Antilochus begins to feel as if he too has loved and lost so dear a boy, such is the extent of Achilles' howling grief. A show for the death of a hero - everything is owed to Patroclus now. He calls for a bier, some thoughtful Argives hurry forth with a strapped board to carry the slain hero, and Achilles leads the procession, full of praise and true horror for Patroclus. It is in the unspoken grime upon his face, that any Trojan to assail them now will fall further than the House of Death. They hasten to the beachfront, Achilles' voice carrying above the rest with tales of Patroclus' childhood, and woes that his father must hear of the death. It is the end, Antilochus fears, the end of the way things used to be. Achilles will leave no Trojan alive now, if the choice is laid before him. And in their midst The brilliant Achilles began to arm for battle... A sound of grinding came from the fighter's teeth, His eyes blazed forth in searing points of fire, Unbearable grief came surging through his heart.",

    "text": "They're two years into a four year relationship before Peter begins to notice things. Things, he calls them, because he's not sure what else they would be. Suspicions. Flickers out of the corner of his eye. Weird feelings on the back of his neck. Things he can't vocalize but that make him sit up a little straighter whenever Neal Caffrey walks into a room. He's picking up a paperclip from the floor when Neal approaches, and for a second he sees something, feathers and a shadow under patent leather shoes that implies that gravity isn't working as hard as it should be. He blinks and picks the paperclip up, and Neal is staring at him with an impish grin, and there's a feather in his hat but his feet are firmly on the ground. There are people who Peter's eyes can't focus on, men and women who will sidle up to Neal and whisper in his ear while Neal stands still, more focused than Peter ever sees him on a case. They'll slip a piece of paper in his hand, which vanishes with a flicker, or they'll speak words that Peter's lip reading skills can't even begin to decipher. Neal will nod, vanish for half an hour (his tracker always places him at home, although he'll never answer his phone during these times), and then reappear looking calm. There are dreams that leave him unsettled in the morning, visions of Neal standing in a crowd, wearing a different face but with the same shockingly blue eyes. It's only when he wakes that Peter realizes the crowd had been Greek, wearing togas. There are the times where Peter comes in to the office late to follow up on a lead, and finds Neal standing at the glass windows of the FBI building, staring out at the city below. He's still at these times, unnaturally, and his eyes appear to be taking in more than Peter can see. Peter sees all of these things and wonders, but they're like wisps of fog, too insubstantial for him to grasp. And then one day Peter walks out the back door of the FBI building, looking for Neal who had claimed to be taking a smoke break (which Peter had assumed meant he was meeting Mozzie). But instead of Mozzie, there's a tall, older man standing next to Neal in the parking lot. He's wearing a suit that looks like it was made for him, gold cufflinks catching the sun like bursts of lightning. Peter is too far away to hear them, but he can read their lips, and this time he understands what he sees. The older man puts a hand on Neal's shoulder, and Neal grins at him and says, \"Of course, Father.\" The grin is impish, like a child planning a trick, but the man just nods, apparently satisfied. \"I'll see you soon,\" he says. He adds another word that Peter can't make out, but the wind shifts and carries it to him a split second later. Hermes, it says. The sun brightens, comes out from behind a cloud, something, and blinds Peter for a moment. He shades his eyes, looking down at the ground. When he looks back up, Neal's alone in the parking lot, staring up at the sky with a longing expression. He looks down a moment later, catches Peter's eye, and grins that same impish grin. Then he tips his hat, tucks his hands in his pockets, and walks off. Peter can swear there's a shadow of feathers at his feet.",

Persephone did not arm herself with them this time - she armed herself, indeed, with little, wearing aught else but a thin stola quickly shed. He could not seduce her so ill, and so she supped of his flesh in small, sweet bites. From his limpid phallus she coaxed extraordinary sensations no nymph had ever drawn, her cheeks hollowed and fingers bringing the sweetest of fiction. He tried to delay her, to urge her to take him within, but this time, this last time, she wanted to swallow him as she had the seed of the pomegranate. Hades reached to pleasure her, but Persephone pushed him away, a question of desperation upon her bitter lips. \"How does the world go on, when death has gone?\" she asked him breathlessly. \"Sweet,\" he said, his eyes polished glass through which she could nearly see his kindest side, \"what care have I?\" Those words made alarm bells sang out through Persephone's skin.

But the girl was impassive to his overtures; she only picked at the food he brought. He bought her the finest of silks to brighten their dark kingdom; the softest of rugs to warm her feet and the warmest of blankets to keep her from catching a chill. But she preferred to walk bound in the silks her mother had bought her the summer before. He gave her his respect, his love, his attention. But Persephone would never love him in return. Not the way he needed her to - not in a way that would illuminate the centuries that loomed ahead of them with the promise of endless rejection, endless reprove. He made love to her with every skill he had learned from watching the other Gods at play; the impassioned gestures of Apollo, the intoxicating friendliness of Bacchius; the rough seductions of Zeus. He plied her with his tongue and fingers; he probed her every crevice. He applied his lips to the nether places that he doubted she could name, or knew about before he took her. And her body rippled and spasmed in response to his. She turned her head toward the wall and closed her eyes as he tried to kiss her cheek, the tears that stained her jaw and cheekbones. There was a golden beauty, a glow, to her that brightened the entire world, and that he was cursed never to be able to take it into the sterility of his heart. The cool wind kissed his skin, the chill burrowing into his skin. He fucked his cock madly into the heat of her - she was hot, burning hot, between her legs but the rest of Persephone was a specter, a cube of ice, and he would never have sun enough to melt her pose. He had stolen her. And in doing so, he doomed himself to a lifetime of paying a price that would never be stricken from the record.",

    "text": "As Ra sailed into the sky's arc on Serqa's thirteenth birthday, she burned an incense cone of myrrh and lotus flowers in front of her little plaster Isis. She breathed in and told herself a story of her father's magical return home. The world was full of magic. Serqa was certain that Se-Osiris, who lived in the row house next door to the Gorgos Sisters Hellenic gymnasium for girls, was a magician. Since he was very old, he didn't go out very much into Cairo. Also, Serqa was certain that the Isis statue came alive when Serqa left the room. Serqa said to Betet, the girl who cleaned her rooms, \"I never catch her at it.\" \"Yes, Miss Serqa.\" Betet smiled shyly at the tiled floor as she swept. Serqa's birthday celebration took place in the garden behind the large stone row house. Despite the name, the garden had no trees or flowers in it. It was full of stone statues so perfect that they looked as if they had been alive a few moments before they became statues, which meant they had been. There was also a clay track for running and a pile of rocks. Stheno, the older Gorgos sister, would throw the rocks at girls who weren't running fast enough. This had something to do with a classic Hellenic education. Stheno never threw rocks at Serqa. She pushed Serqa forward and said, \"Here is our beautiful star student.\" The way she said it always made Serqa think of a cobra hissing. At Serqa's birthday party there was a camel, three acrobats and a pile of gifts taller than herself. Stheno bought them on behalf of Serqa's father, Strategos Chysthanos. Euryale, the younger Gorgos sister, clutched an old strip of fabric and watched the acrobats. She sniffed, \"A wonderful birthday for a wonderful girl.\" She said it in voice that made Serqa think of the low of a cow when her calf is taken from her. Serqa's own mother had died when Serqa was seven. The same year that Strategos Chysthanos went far away to fight for Pharaoh Ptolemy in the wars. Serqa had woken up that morning and realized that she no longer remembered what her father's face looked like, which is why she'd told the story to herself. She looked into a piece of polished silver to see if she could see glimpse of him, but she saw her mother there in every part of her face, except for her green eyes. Her father had green eyes. On the afternoon that she was thirteen, Stheno came out into the garden and screamed, \"Stop. Everyone stop.\" She snarled at the acrobats. She pointed at the camel with a long hard finger. \"Take that thing and get out.\" She ripped the doll with yellow flax hair from Serqa's arms. \"Your father died in battle. His estates in Syria and Hellene were lost. The lands in Cairo and in Lower Egypt were taken by Pharaoh. You have nothing.\" She shook the doll so that its hair bounced. \"I paid for all of this.\" She looked at her sister, Euryale. \"We pay for everything.\" Stheno snarled and turned away. Serqa stood very still as one does when a serpent is near. Her green eyed father was dead. His Ka had left him. Serqa had no way of knowing if the proper funeral rites had been carried out. His Sheut, his shadow soul, might have been cast onto the yellow winds. Pharaoh might strike her father's name from monuments. She couldn't be sure of the state of her father's heart as he stood before Osiris. His Ba might be circling lost in the sky. She walked in a blur of sorrow. Euryale led Serqa up to the roof of the row house, a wide flat space broken up with low walls. Euryale said, \"This is where you'll sleep now.\" She knitted her plump hands. \"I'm sorry for your loss.\" Euryale bobbed her head. She took the oil lamp and left behind only the dark. Serqa looked in the starlight, but she did not see a bed. She was so tired that she lay down on the bricks. As the moon climbed into the sky, Betet came up to the roof. She rolled out a thin reed mat. She whispered, \"Miss Serqa, you sleep the mat.\" After Serqa struggled onto it, Betet pushed something dark to her. \"I get Isis from old room.\" Serqa took the old worn Isis figure that she had been her mother's and whispered, \"Thank you.\" This was when Serqa thought to herself that now she must be like Isis while she wandered as a beggar with her baby when her brother-husband was killed by their brother. Serqa swallowed what tears she had under the stars and she whispered, \"I think that we are like the sisters, Isis and Nepthys, who were trapped in their mother's womb, which is the night sky.\" She pointed up at the milky spill of stars. \"We are waiting for my father, Thoth, to trick the sun and moon so that we can be born.\" Betet rolled over on her mat and sat up on one elbow. \"I not a goddess. I clean up after ladies.\" Serqa, for the first time, wondered why they were speaking in Hellene. She looked up at the night stars of their mother, Nut, and whispered in the language of Khemet, \"I am like you now.\" Betet exhaled. \"I did not know that you spoke Khemet.\" Betet laughed and it was a beautiful sound. Serqa looked up at the sky and said with all the conviction that a thirteen year old girl can have, \"I think we are like the goddesses, only we are in disguise, because,\" and she decided then the way this story went, \"we are on a quest. This place is cursed.\" \"Oh, and don't I know it,\" laughed Betet again to the night sky. \"The cook curses me in Khemet and the Gorgos sisters curse me in Hellene.\" Serqa put her arms behind her head and explained it as a story within a story. \"Once the king of the Assyrians put a curse on Pharaoh that stole his shadow soul and made his heart heavy and he became like a madman. He raged for no reason and threw rocks at his court and he cried when he saw his children laughing. I think the curse is like that.\" She let the shape of the curse make itself in her mouth as she spoke the heaviness in her heart. \"I think there is a curse on the hearts of the Gorgos sisters and that is why their shadow souls cover the house.\" Betet yawned. \"I've always loved your stories. When I listen, sometimes I lose the meaning of the words, but it doesn't matter because I'm falling down your voice.\" She yawned again. \"But we should get some sleep.\" Betet followed her own advice. But Serqa stared up at the womb of her mother, Nut, and told herself a story about how her father, Thoth, would rescue her soon. She was interrupted when Anubis scrabbled across the bricks in the form of a rat. His eyes glittered red in the starlight, but she knew that it was him. She never would have seen him in her old rooms, but here, high above this cursed place, he was able to get in. She got up and bowed to him. She whispered, \"Is my father well? Were the proper funeral rites observed? Is it my fault he died? Is it because I wished for magic? Is it because I didn't notice the curse?\" The rat put his paws on Isis and squeaked. Serqa understood. She felt the rock on her heart lift a little, as in the distance the fat moon rose higher in the sky. She looked over the edge of the roof and held Isis next to her heart. Anubis sat on the ledge. They looked out over Cairo and she saw the part of the soul of the city that was its shadow. It was so dark and deep that she did not need to be Horus to see it. She pointed at the shadow soul and whispered, \"That's the past. Time goes into the deep earth like a star in Nut's belly.\" She thought about time. How time went into the deep earth. How time sat on her shoulders like the sand scattered on the pyramids. How time hovered in the sky like Horus until it descended onto her shoulders and then into the deep earth. She remembered that when she was little, she'd often slept with her parents on the roof when it was too hot to sleep inside. She looked up at the stars and thought about the times her father had told her their Hellenic names. She heard her mother's voice telling her about Isis and Nepthys in the belly of Nut. She thought about that as she looked up at the stars with time falling on her face in the form of moonlight. She thought about that as she blinked tired on a new morning. Anubis had gone. His place had been taken by Cackling Geb, who wore the form of a monkey. She said, \"Hello.\" Betet blinked awake. \"What is it?\" Serqa bowed solemnly. \"It's a messenger from your father, Cackling Geb, who is the earth under our mother sky. He's here to tell us that we will be rescued soon.\" Just then the first beam of Ra bust over the horizon. \"See.\" Betet sighed. \"That's not rescue. That's morning.\" \"You'll see.\" Serqa grinned at Ra, who was keeping them trapped in time, but her father, Thoth, would find a way. She ran after Betet down the stairs. She thought about rescue a great deal as she cleaned out the rooms of her former friends. Some laughed at her. Some turned away from her. Ermentherna, who she'd always pitied because she wasn't very clever, looked at her with wide eyes and twisted her hands. She said nothing. Serqa learned what hunger was and knew that this was what it was like when Isis lived in the reed marsh and had to beg for food for herself and baby Horus. That very night, she saw Se-Osiris carried up on a litter onto the roof of the row house. Serqa waved to him and the tall servant who cared for him. Cackling Geb jumped over Se-Osiris in his shelter of reeds woven together for shade. She watched him over the low wall, but just as Se-Osiris was about to do magic, Ermentherna came up through the trap door onto the roof. She whispered, because the roof invited whispers, \"Hello, Serqa. Is this where you sleep now?\" She held up her lamp. \"It's very dark. Where is your bed? Where do you put your lamp?\" Betet sighed and said in Hellene, \"No bed. No lamp.\" She muttered under her breath in Khemet, \"No polished wood tables or chairs encased in electrum either.\" Serqa let time slip out of her spread hands. \"This is the womb of Nut, our mother.\" Serqa raised her face to the breeze. She said, \"Close your eyes and you can feel the breeze that has been sent by Thoth, my father. Ermentherna said, \"I thought your father was, oh, that is nice.\" She closed her eyes. She held out the book under her arm. \"I brought the book my father just sent me. I thought maybe you could read it to me, so I could understand it and father won't be as angry at me.\" Serqa rolled out the reed mat and sat cross legged on it.\" She gestured to it. \"This mat was woven by Cackling Geb, who is the earth. It keeps whoever sits on it safe from the jackals that haunt the red desert. Ermentherna looked around startled. \"Are there a lot of jackals up here?\" \"No,\" Serqa tugged Ermentherna down, \"because we have the mats.\" She felt her heart lift a little. There was still something that she could do. She read to both Betet and Ermentherna from the book in a mix of Hellene and Khemet until Ermentherna cracked a yawn that almost broke her face. The moon rose up over the city of Cairo, which was when Serqa remembered. She said, \"Betet and I are on a quest. We think the Gorgos sisters have a curse on their shadow souls.\" \"I guess that makes sense.\" Ermentherna's forehead wrinkled. \"Can I, I know I'm not terribly clever, but maybe I could help.\" Her hands worried at her clothes. \"But probably not.\" \"Of course you can.\" Serqa hugged her. \"And you'll see. The magic will help too.\" In the morning, she woke to the sound of Cackling Geb laughing at her before dawn. The magic had brought a small oil lamp and a jar of oil. She lit the lamp and put it front of Isis, so she could see too. She bowed to Cackling Geb, who sat on the low wall that separated the row houses. She waved at the tall servant of Se-Osiris and called softly, \"Good morning.\" He waved back in the round light of his own lamp. \"Beautiful morning.\" She read until Ra sailed into the sky. Betet sat up. \"Where did you get a lamp?\" \"Magic.\" Serqa smiled. \"Cackling Geb brought it because Isis asked him to.\" \"Oh,\" said Betet. She touched the side of the lamp and she bowed to Isis for good measure. \"Thank you.\" Isis smiled serenely, but she didn't move, because they were looking at her. Later, while Stheno threw rocks to encourage the girls to run and Euryale taught rhetoric, they crept into their room. Ermentherna stood worried guard at the door. Betet said, \"Looks like it always does. There's nothing here.\" \"No, see.\" Serqa pointed to where the sunlight through the window mat cast circular shadows on the floor. It was like when a pebble was dropped in a garden pool. She whispered, \"Magic, keep me safe.\" She took a deep breath and stepped into the water. The fabric of her dress floated up around her ankles and her thighs and her neck. Above her, Betet said, \"I can't swim.\" She held her breath until her lungs burned. Burned and she breathed in. She told herself the story of it as she breathed the water like air. Her words bubbled back up to Betet. \"Don't worry, the magic will help you.\" Betet hesitated and jumped in. They walked down the ripples like steps. The walls changed as they went down. First the white washed stone walls gave way to mud and then became a temple to Wadjet, the serpent goddess, which had been lost when Isis wept as she found out that Osiris was dead. Serqa told the story of it as they went and it was true. On the altar that broke above the ripples sat four funeral jars. They were each painted with the face of a screaming woman. She had serpents for hair and the sides were painted with wings or perhaps the wings were blood dripping from her neck. Serqa touched the jars gently and whispered, \"Who was it who died and made Stheno so angry and Euryale so sad?\" Betet stood waist deep in the water with her hands held together at her chest. \"It's magic. It's really magic.\" They heard Ermentherna's harsh whisper through the water. \"Someone's coming.\" Serqa grabbed the jars and ran back up through the waves. They burst out the door, but they left footprints behind them. Betet said, \"Go, I'll say that I spilled the wash water.\" Ermentherna gaped at the water dripping on the floor. \"Magic!\" Betet gripped her broom and swept up their footsteps. \"Wet magic.\" Serqa and Ermentherna ran into the pantry as Stheno stormed through the hallway. They all held their breath, but Stheno only yelled briefly and stormed away. Serqa put the jars on the tiled floor. She said, \"These belong to someone who has gone into the deep earth.\" Ermentherna crouched down. \"Oh, I have a picture of her.\" She pointed at the face of the screaming woman. \"In one of the books father sent me. Remember.\" Serqa nibbled on her lower lip. She hardly dared ask, because books were so very dear, but that night Ermentherna came again with another vellum book. They opened the book and looked through it. In the middle, there was a picture like the faces painted on the jars. Serqa read aloud the story of three sisters, the Gorgons: Stheno, Euryale, and Medusa. \"There's another one?\" Betet stared at the picture. \"Two seemed like plenty.\" Even though Ermentherna didn't understand a word of Khemet, she nodded in agreement. At the end of the story, Ermentherna looked over the wall into the garden below. \"Those are all people.\" Serqa closed the book. \"Yes, and the hero took her head.\" She went quickly from the edge of the roof overlooking the garden to the short wall that separated the roof of the gymnasium's row house from the next. She sat on the wall. \"We need to find Medusa's head to lift the curse.\" \"But it's in Hellene.\" Ermentherna held up the vellum book. \"Isn't it?\" \"Se-Osiris can go through a door in one city and walk out a street in another.\" Serqa waved at where Se-Osiris sat on his roof and pitched her voice so he could hear the story that she told about his chase through three cities and three countries to rescue Pharaoh's son when Set kidnapped him. The other girls sat on the reed mats and listened to her by lamp light until time falling from the sky made Ermentherna crack such a yawn that she had to go downstairs to sleep. In the days that followed, they opened every door in the gymnasium, but it wouldn't be an ordinary door. Although they searched for many days, and one morning the magic even brought woven pillows from reeds to raise their heads as they slept, they didn't find the door. One day, the cook sent Serqa outside of the gymnasium to buy fish from the market. She saw the people of Cairo as she walked the narrow winding streets. She was amazed at how beautiful everyone was with their shadow souls stretched out behind them and their soul birds shining through their faces. She felt dizzy. She crumbled to the deep earth and felt the shadow soul of Cairo with her knees. \"Little beggar girl. Hello. Hello.\" A young Hellenic boy with a gold band around his black curly hair peered down at her. He smiled very brightly and held out a copper coin. \"This is for you. Because you are a beggar girl and are very hungry and this will make you rich and feed you forever.\" Serqa thought, \"I am like Isis, when she sat at the well in Pi-Anti and the women gave her crusts of bread, but she blessed them. I need to bless him.\" Serqa had no idea how to bless someone, but the deep earth went very deep and the future settled down like sand from the sky. As she took the coin, she brushed his hand with the two fingers from her right hand and said, \"Your shadow soul will stretch long across the earth and where it falls, green things will grow.\" Then she twisted and pushed the edge of his shadow soul into the deep earth so that he would be rooted in the land. \"Oh,\" said the little Hellenic boy. \"Oh.\" He looked down and up again, and she saw the Hellenic Dionysus, who was green like Osiris, flicker behind his eyes. He said, \"Thank you.\" \"Thank you.\" She stood up and cast her own shadow soul over his. They mingled for a moment, and as they parted, she saw a trace of green in the earth. She held the copper in her hand and told herself it was a key. She walked slowly. A rat ran across the street into a narrow alley. She ran after it. She called out, \"Anubis?\" The rat's shadow soul deepened into the shape of a jackal. She followed them, the rat and the shadow, through the streets of Cairo until she hardly knew where she was. They came to a brick wall. The rat stopped and groomed his fur. She bowed, a little out of breath, and said, \"Thank you, Anubis.\" There was a wide crack that went up and down in the wall. She put the coin that was now a key into the crack and turned it. A door opened and she went in. She knew from the bright paintings on the walls that she was in the home of Thoth. She called out, \"Hello, Thoth. Are you here?\" The only answer was the echo of her sandals as they slapped on the blue tiled floor. She came to a library. The shelves were filled with dozens of scroll canisters. She put her hands behind her back so she could resist reaching out. She called out. \"Hello. Hello, Thoth.\" There was no answer but dust moving in a sunbeam from a window. She looked at the neat rows of canisters and examined the tags. She was very surprised to see one marked with her cartouche. Below her name was written, \"To help your quest.\" She whispered, \"He really can read the future.\" She took down the canister and opened it. Inside was a long scroll on very old papyrus. It crackled as she unrolled it. She saw that it was the Book of Thoth. There was red thread dangling halfway through the scroll. She unrolled it until she reached the thread. It marked the rite to make one that had gone into the deep earth an Akh, which is to say alive. She held her breath, and for a moment she really wanted to bring back her father or maybe her mother, but she knew that the rite shouldn't be used in that way. This was for her quest, not for her. Her heart felt both sorrow and happiness in that moment, which made her heart feel somewhat dizzy in her chest. Still, she wanted to be polite as Isis. She said to the room. \"Thank you!\" She put the scroll canister carefully in her woven bag. She walked out the way she came. As she closed the door, she found herself in the market and the key was a coin again. Her stomach grumbled and she laughed. It was such a normal thing. She bought what she had been sent to buy. As she went through the market, she saw little boys and girls with wide hungry eyes. She only had one coin, and she very much wanted to fill her belly. But when Isis was in Cebu, even though she was hungry herself, she fed the hungry there. She told herself that she only had one coin and that was just enough to feed herself, but she knew the coin wasn't meant for that. She took the coin and she tapped it on the deep earth. She said, \"This will make the land rich and will feed us forever.\" She held it there awhile and then she went to a smiling baker and said, \"I would like to buy four loaves of bread.\" The smiling baker laughed and gave her six. \"You look hungry, sweetling.\" Serqa knew that she must be hungry, because everyone could see it. Which meant that she was making the right choice. She gave away the loaves as she walked and didn't look back. So she did not see the smiling baker stop smiling and let out a long breath as the shadow soul of Cairo stretched and grew a little bigger. That evening, as Ra slipped away over the horizon, Serqa skipped up the steps to the roof even though she had had little to eat. She waved at Se-Osiris and his tall servant under the reed woven shade. The tall servant waved back, but Se-Osiris sat very still and looked at the horizon. However, she noticed that he was sitting closer. She called out, \"Good evening.\" The tall servant called back, \"Good evening!\" and he went about making Se-Osiris more comfortable in his chair. She turned to Betet, \"See what I have.\" She showed the canister tag to Betet. Betet said, \"What does it say? I cannot read it.\" Serqa stopped. It had never occurred to her that Betet could not read Khemet. Finally, Serqa said, \"It's for our quest. See, there is my cartouche. The magic is helping us. Here, I will show you how to read what it says. Now we just need to find the things it lists. They poured over the rite with Ermentherna, who looked grim and offered to ask her father for the brass ankh and the silver mirror. Betet looked even grimmer and said, \"The cook has myrrh, cinnamon, vervain, and footprint of Isis.\" She swallowed. \"I will get them from the locked part of the pantry.\" Serqa rolled up the scroll and put it away. \"Now we just need to find the head.\" Ermentherna looked less than thrilled. \"We need the head or it won't work.\" Serqa patted Ermentherna's shoulder. Ermentherna sighed, but did not argue. Betet grinned. \"It can't be worse than skinning an eel. Those things are nasty.\" She made a peeling gesture and Ermentherna rolled her eyes at her. They giggled in the night. In the morning, Cackling Geb woke Serqa with his laughter. As she opened her eyes, she smelled a plate of bread, still warm from the oven. It sat on the bricks between Serqa and Betet's mats. \"Betet, Betet look.\" Betet sat up. \"I really like this magic.\" She bowed to Cackling Geb. \"You're a much better father than my old one.\" She tore into the bread, but at a look from Serqa, she said, \"Thank you,\" to Cackling Geb. \"It's,\" she chewed, \"really good.\" They ate most of it, but Serqa left a crust for Anubis to feed her father and mother in the underworld. They looked again at all the doors and jumped in all the pools of light and pushed things in all the cracks they could find, but they didn't find a magic door. Serqa was philosophical about this. \"It's not the right time. When the magic is ready, we'll find it.\" They needed to find it. Euryale had started weeping at the end of every class that she taught. Stheno was aiming to hit with her rocks. Serqa helped Ermentherna write her father, who critiqued her use of certain words contextually, but after a second letter, he sent her what she'd asked for. Betet gathered other ingredients from the pantry, while Serqa distracted the Cook with a love story that had her saying, \"Oh, I never. Then what happened.\" Finally, they had everything, but no head. They sat on the roof together and stared at the items. \"Now what?\" said Ermentherna. That was when the trap door to the stairs below crashed open and Stheno raged onto the roof followed by weeping Euryale. Stheno looked at the jars sitting in front of Isis, who now sat on a small broken jar that Serqa had found behind a building one day. She saw the pile of spices and sacred implements. She saw the velum books on the bricks and she screamed, \"How dare you! You insolent worthless girls.\" She threw the spices and the objects off the roof and they flew far into the garden. She smashed Isis against the low wall. Isis broke into three pieces. Serqa cried out, \"No!\" Stheno struck her across her cheek in a blinding crack. Serqa fell to the ground. Stheno yelled, \"You. This was all your idea.\" Euryale picked up the jars. Tears trickled down her cheeks. Serqa said, \"Please, we're trying to help you.\" Euryale shook her head and went down the stairs. Stheno snarled. \"Ermentherna pick up your books and go downstairs.\" She gripped Betet by the arm and dragged Betet down the stairs. The trap door closed with a loud click and Serqa could hear the sound of a cross bar going across the door from below. She pounded on it and she called out, \"Please, we're trying to help you.\" But the trap door didn't open. Not that night and not the next day as Ra sailed across the hot sky. There was no shelter on the roof from Ra's jealous hot rays. There was no water either. Serqa had known hunger, but now she knew a thirst that dried her tongue so she couldn't speak the magic. She could only mumble it through crackled lips as she clutched the three pieces of Isis to her chest and sip at her own tears until she had no more to weep. Finally, the sun set and she panted at the cool on her blistered skin. She thought she felt something soft and wet on her skin. She thought she heard a low rumble voice whisper, \"Shh, shh, it will be wonderful.\" When she woke in the morning, she lay on a rope strung bed that swayed as she moved. She blinked up at a woven reed shelter that blocked the sun. Swaths of brilliant red cloth were draped on the reeds and swayed gently in the breeze. An urn of water that dripped with moisture sat on a painted plaster chest next to the bed. She poured herself a cup of water and drank every drop of it. There was a basket of dates and figs. She ate them until juice ran down her cheeks. She stood up on the rug that stretched over the roof and said, \"Thank you magic. You've saved my life.\" This was when she saw Isis, thick stripes of resin wet along the breaks, but in one piece. She knelt in front of her and whispered, \"Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.\" Cackling Geb laughed. He scampered across the roof and grabbed Isis. He ran across the low wall. Serqa chased after him. \"Hey, come back.\" She chased him across one roof, two roofs, three roofs. He jumped the narrow distance to another set of row houses. She jumped after him. He ran across the city and she followed him as Cairo's shadow soul grew small in the rising sun. They came to a cemetery, where the living lived with the dead. She ran after Cackling Geb through the sandstone structures and into one of them. Inside a set of stairs went up. She following Cackling Geb as he laughed and scampered up past the cemetery and up past the circling birds. Finally, they reached the single cloud that sat in the sky. On the cloud, a silver horse with golden wings ripped up long blades of white cloud grass from the cloud. A gold boar with bronze wings snuffled in the cloud dirt for cloud mushrooms. Cackling Geb raced across the cloud and jumped into the blue sky. Serqa heard a woman's laughter, but she couldn't see Geb. Serqa was very tired. She sat down on the cloud, which was quite soft and springy. The horse whickered at her and lipped at her cheek. She said, \"Hello.\" The boar snorted at her. She was thirsty, so she scooped up a bit of cloud, which tasted slightly sweet and very refreshing. The horse lipped at her cheek and nibbled at her hair. Serqa laughed because it tickled. At her laughter, the clouds waved as if in a wind and she saw the white wrapped figure of one of the dead. The boar snorted and glared at her with large red eyes as she got up. His wings moved restlessly. She knew in that moment that the boar and the horse were Medusa's sons and they guarded her body as best they could on this cloud. Cackling Geb poked his head through the cloud. He held a roughly woven sack. It hissed as he carried it. \"Oh,\" said Serqa, \"But I don't have any of the things that were in the Book of Thoth. Cackling Geb tilted his head as if to say that he couldn't do everything. Serqa nodded, because that was true. She knew the words and Euryale had the jars and the spices were spread out in the gymnasium's garden as an offering. Suddenly, thinking of the statues in the garden, she wondered if this was a good idea, but then she thought of Isis, who had pitied her brother Set in the final battle and spared his life. \"Which was why her son, Horus, cut her head off, but her father, Thoth, grew her a cow's head,\" she explained to the horse and the boar. The boar glared when she mentioned heads being cut off, so she supposed he was touchy about that sort of thing. She took the hissing bag, and with her eyes closed, pulled out the head, which she put next to the white wrapped body. She took the horse's mane and braided it into a silver mirror. She asked very nicely for a bronze feather from the boar. She twisted it into an ankh. She whispered the name of Ra as it was written in the Book of Thoth and she asked the magic, very nicely, for help. Medusa screamed, not like Stheno screamed in rage, but like the little ones at the gymnasium sometimes did in terror. Serqa didn't think. She gathered Medusa in her arms, and rocked the much larger woman back and forth. \"Shhh. Shhh. It's okay. I have you.\" After what seemed like hours, Medusa pulled away from her. She stretched and the white wrappings pulled away. She said, in a voice that sounded like a snake and an eagle and the wind from a far off sea, \"Thank you.\" Serqa didn't look up. She didn't want to be turned to stone. She felt strong arms wrap around her and Medusa leapt off the edge of the cloud. Serqa could see great wings move around them and they flew. The boar and the horse flew around them. The horse galloped and played, while the boar flew in a straight line. Medusa touched down on the roof of the row house. Serqa said, \"Oh, but you've put me down on the wrong roof.\" But Medusa had already flown away. Serqa smiled at Se-Osiris, who was looking at Isis in his hands and therefore had neither turned to stone or even noticed Serqa and the flying snake woman, flying horse, and flying boar. She cleared her throat, because she didn't want to startle him. She said, \"Hello, that's my Isis. May I have it back? The magic saved me, but I need to help my friends.\" Se-Osiris looked up at her. He was very old and frail, and he was crying. He said, \"This was my daughter's.\" He wiped away at a tear on his cheek. \"I gave it to her. It was all she took when she turned from me to marry a Hellene.\" He drew his finger along the cartouche written on the bottom of Isis' foot. \"When I turned my heart away from her.\" He laughed and he cried. \"I have sent messengers looking everywhere for her child since I learned that she went into the deep earth.\" He held his hand to his face over his eyes. \"I sent Aions over the wall because I took pity on you and hoped someone would take pity on her child.\" He took his hand away again. Great tears trembled on the edges of his red rimmed eyes. \"You were here all along.\" \"Oh,\" said Serqa, who for once wasn't sure what to say. She hugged him instead, but carefully, because he was old. Although, it turned out, not really as old as she'd thought, just unwell, and little old. She'd thought he'd been thousands of years old, and he wasn't that old at all. His tall servant, Aions, turned out to be his son and therefore Serqa's uncle. Aions came up soon and hugged them both. He said, \"When I fixed Isis, I should have looked at her foot. Or when I left bread or the lamp or,\" He picked Serqa up and swung her around so that her feet flew through the air. He laughed and hugged her and said, \"You sound just like Asnofre. She'd say, 'You have the soul of the earth little one,' and she'd tickle me. What a wonderful day.\" He tickled Serqa. \"Isn't it a wonderful day? Say it.\" She laughed and said, \"It's a wonderful day,\" and \"Oh, stop, I'm laughing too hard,\" and \"I need to help my friends.\" But the magic wasn't done yet. Betet looked over the low wall at Serqa. She said, \"You did it. The gymnasium is in chaos. Medusa flew through the door and, and Euryale laughed and Stheno laughed and they all flew into the garden. Look.\" Serqa looked and the three women were perched on the wall together and were making some sort of garment that dangled between the three of them down the wall. Medusa was veiled, but she was easy to recognize. Serqa helped Betet over the wall. She said to her new grandfather and uncle, \"This is my sister, Betet. We were goddesses together in the womb of the night.\" Se-Osiris cried a little again and Aions said, \"Asnofre spoke in exactly the same way.\" He clapped his hands together. \"And now I have two nieces, where once I had none. Fabulous day.\" He hugged them both. Later they had Ermentherna over for lemon water and honey cakes, because there were certainly no lessons that day. The teachers were all sitting on the garden wall, while the students were taking rides on the flying horse and boar. It was later, when Medusa, her eyes wrapped in funeral bindings, held her class on love, compassion, justice and forgiveness that Serqa had the idea. She passed a note to Ermentherna and Betet that read, \"The magic wants us to turn back the statues next.\" So, they did. Like when Isis went to live in the marsh and begged for food for her baby, Serqa went to live on the roof of the Gorgos Sisters Hellenic Gymnasium for girls. Like Isis, she had a curse to lift and steps to take through the world that was full of magic if you'd stop to tell the tale.

      "Ermentherna, who she'd always pitied because she wasn't very clever, looked at her with wide eyes and twisted her hands.",
      "She said nothing.",
      "Serqa learned what hunger was and knew that this was what it was like when Isis lived in the reed marsh and had to beg for food for herself and baby Horus.",
      "That very night, she saw Se-Osiris carried up on a litter onto the roof of the row house.",
      "Serqa waved to him and the tall servant who cared for him.",
      "Cackling Geb jumped over Se-Osiris in his shelter of reeds woven together for shade.",
      "She watched him over the low wall, but just as Se-Osiris was about to do magic, Ermentherna came up through the trap door onto the roof.",
      "She whispered, because the roof invited whispers, \"Hello, Serqa.",
      "Is this where you sleep now?\"",
      "She held up her lamp.",
      "\"It's very dark.",
      "Where is your bed?",
      "Where do you put your lamp?\" Betet sighed and said in Hellene, \"No bed.",
      "No lamp.\"",
      "She muttered under her breath in Khemet, \"No polished wood tables or chairs encased in electrum either.\"",
      "Serqa let time slip out of her spread hands.",
      "\"This is the womb of Nut, our mother.\"",
      "Serqa raised her face to the breeze.",
      "She said, \"Close your eyes and you can feel the breeze that has been sent by Thoth, my father.",
      "Ermentherna said, \"I thought your father was, oh, that is nice.\"",
      "She closed her eyes.",
      "She held out the book under her arm.",
      "\"I brought the book my father just sent me.",
      "I thought maybe you could read it to me, so I could understand it and father won't be as angry at me.\"",
      "Serqa rolled out the reed mat and sat cross legged on it.\"",
      "She gestured to it.",
      "\"This mat was woven by Cackling Geb, who is the earth.",
      "It keeps whoever sits on it safe from the jackals that haunt the red desert.",
      "Ermentherna looked around startled.",
      "\"Are there a lot of jackals up here?\"",
      "\"No,\" Serqa tugged Ermentherna down, \"because we have the mats.\"",
      "She felt her heart lift a little.",
      "There was still something that she could do.",
      "She read to both Betet and Ermentherna from the book in a mix of Hellene and Khemet until Ermentherna cracked a yawn that almost broke her face.",
      "The moon rose up over the city of Cairo, which was when Serqa remembered.",
      "She said, \"Betet and I are on a quest.",
      "We think the Gorgos sisters have a curse on their shadow souls.\"",
      "\"I guess that makes sense.\"",
      "Ermentherna's forehead wrinkled.",
      "\"Can I, I know I'm not terribly clever, but maybe I could help.\"",
      "Her hands worried at her clothes.",
      "\"But probably not.\"",
      "\"Of course you can.\"",
      "Serqa hugged her.",
      "\"And you'll see.",
      "The magic will help too.\"",
      "In the morning, she woke to the sound of Cackling Geb laughing at her before dawn.",
      "The magic had brought a small oil lamp and a jar of oil.",
      "She lit the lamp and put it front of Isis, so she could see too.",
      "She bowed to Cackling Geb, who sat on the low wall that separated the row houses.",
      "She waved at the tall servant of Se-Osiris and called softly, \"Good morning.\"",
      "He waved back in the round light of his own lamp.",
      "\"Beautiful morning.\"",
      "She read until Ra sailed into the sky.",
      "Betet sat up.",
      "\"Where did you get a lamp?\" \"Magic.\"",
      "Serqa smiled.",
      "\"Cackling Geb brought it because Isis asked him to.\"",
      "\"Oh,\" said Betet.",
      "She touched the side of the lamp and she bowed to Isis for good measure.",
      "\"Thank you.\"",
      "Isis smiled serenely, but she didn't move, because they were looking at her.",
      "Later, while Stheno threw rocks to encourage the girls to run and Euryale taught rhetoric, they crept into their room.",
      "Ermentherna stood worried guard at the door.",
      "Betet said, \"Looks like it always does.",
      "There's nothing here.\"",
      "\"No, see.\"",
      "Serqa pointed to where the sunlight through the window mat cast circular shadows on the floor.",
      "It was like when a pebble was dropped in a garden pool.",
      "She whispered, \"Magic, keep me safe.\"",
      "She took a deep breath and stepped into the water.",
      "The fabric of her dress floated up around her ankles and her thighs and her neck.",
      "Above her, Betet said, \"I can't swim.\"",
      "She held her breath until her lungs burned.",
      "Burned and she breathed in.",
      "She told herself the story of it as she breathed the water like air.",
      "Her words bubbled back up to Betet.",
      "\"Don't worry, the magic will help you.\"",
      "Betet hesitated and jumped in.",
      "They walked down the ripples like steps.",
      "The walls changed as they went down.",
      "First the white washed stone walls gave way to mud and then became a temple to Wadjet, the serpent goddess, which had been lost when Isis wept as she found out that Osiris was dead.",
      "Serqa told the story of it as they went and it was true.",
      "On the altar that broke above the ripples sat four funeral jars.",
      "They were each painted with the face of a screaming woman.",
      "She had serpents for hair and the sides were painted with wings or perhaps the wings were blood dripping from her neck.",
      "Serqa touched the jars gently and whispered, \"Who was it who died and made Stheno so angry and Euryale so sad?\" Betet stood waist deep in the water with her hands held together at her chest.",
      "\"It's magic.",
      "It's really magic.\"",
      "They heard Ermentherna's harsh whisper through the water.",
      "\"Someone's coming.\"",
      "Serqa grabbed the jars and ran back up through the waves.",
      "They burst out the door, but they left footprints behind them.",
      "Betet said, \"Go, I'll say that I spilled the wash water.\"",
      "Ermentherna gaped at the water dripping on the floor.",
      "\"Magic!\"",
      "Betet gripped her broom and swept up their footsteps.",
      "\"Wet magic.\"",
      "Serqa and Ermentherna ran into the pantry as Stheno stormed through the hallway.",
      "They all held their breath, but Stheno only yelled briefly and stormed away.",
      "Serqa put the jars on the tiled floor.",
      "She said, \"These belong to someone who has gone into the deep earth.\"",
      "Ermentherna crouched down.",
      "\"Oh, I have a picture of her.\"",
      "She pointed at the face of the screaming woman.",
      "\"In one of the books father sent me.",
      "Remember.\"",
      "Serqa nibbled on her lower lip.",
      "She hardly dared ask, because books were so very dear, but that night Ermentherna came again with another vellum book.",
      "They opened the book and looked through it.",
      "In the middle, there was a picture like the faces painted on the jars.",
      "Serqa read aloud the story of three sisters, the Gorgons: Stheno, Euryale, and Medusa.",
      "\"There's another one?\" Betet stared at the picture.",
      "\"Two seemed like plenty.\"",
      "Even though Ermentherna didn't understand a word of Khemet, she nodded in agreement.",
      "At the end of the story, Ermentherna looked over the wall into the garden below.",
      "\"Those are all people.\"",
      "Serqa closed the book.",
      "\"Yes, and the hero took her head.\"",
      "She went quickly from the edge of the roof overlooking the garden to the short wall that separated the roof of the gymnasium's row house from the next.",
      "She sat on the wall.",
      "\"We need to find Medusa's head to lift the curse.\"",
      "\"But it's in Hellene.\"",
      "Ermentherna held up the vellum book.",
      "\"Isn't it?\"",
      "\"Se-Osiris can go through a door in one city and walk out a street in another.\"",
      "Serqa waved at where Se-Osiris sat on his roof and pitched her voice so he could hear the story that she told about his chase through three cities and three countries to rescue Pharaoh's son when Set kidnapped him.",
      "The other girls sat on the reed mats and listened to her by lamp light until time falling from the sky made Ermentherna crack such a yawn that she had to go downstairs to sleep.",
      "In the days that followed, they opened every door in the gymnasium, but it wouldn't be an ordinary door.",
      "Although they searched for many days, and one morning the magic even brought woven pillows from reeds to raise their heads as they slept, they didn't find the door.",
      "One day, the cook sent Serqa outside of the gymnasium to buy fish from the market.",
      "She saw the people of Cairo as she walked the narrow winding streets.",
      "She was amazed at how beautiful everyone was with their shadow souls stretched out behind them and their soul birds shining through their faces.",
      "She felt dizzy.",
      "She crumbled to the deep earth and felt the shadow soul of Cairo with her knees.",
      "\"Little beggar girl.",
      "Hello.",
      "Hello.\"",
      "A young Hellenic boy with a gold band around his black curly hair peered down at her.",
      "He smiled very brightly and held out a copper coin.",
      "\"This is for you.",
      "Because you are a beggar girl and are very hungry and this will make you rich and feed you forever.\"",
      "Serqa thought, \"I am like Isis, when she sat at the well in Pi-Anti and the women gave her crusts of bread, but she blessed them.",
      "I need to bless him.\"",
      "Serqa had no idea how to bless someone, but the deep earth went very deep and the future settled down like sand from the sky.",
      "As she took the coin, she brushed his hand with the two fingers from her right hand and said, \"Your shadow soul will stretch long across the earth and where it falls, green things will grow.\"",
      "Then she twisted and pushed the edge of his shadow soul into the deep earth so that he would be rooted in the land.",
      "\"Oh,\" said the little Hellenic boy.",
      "\"Oh.\"",
      "He looked down and up again, and she saw the Hellenic Dionysus, who was green like Osiris, flicker behind his eyes.",
      "He said, \"Thank you.\"",
      "\"Thank you.\"",
      "She stood up and cast her own shadow soul over his.",
      "They mingled for a moment, and as they parted, she saw a trace of green in the earth.",
      "She held the copper in her hand and told herself it was a key.",
      "She walked slowly.",
      "A rat ran across the street into a narrow alley.",
      "She ran after it.",
      "She called out, \"Anubis?\"",
      "The rat's shadow soul deepened into the shape of a jackal.",
      "She followed them, the rat and the shadow, through the streets of Cairo until she hardly knew where she was.",
      "They came to a brick wall.",
      "The rat stopped and groomed his fur.",
      "She bowed, a little out of breath, and said, \"Thank you, Anubis.\"",
      "There was a wide crack that went up and down in the wall.",
      "She put the coin that was now a key into the crack and turned it.",
      "A door opened and she went in.",
      "She knew from the bright paintings on the walls that she was in the home of Thoth.",
      "She called out, \"Hello, Thoth.",
      "Are you here?\"",
      "The only answer was the echo of her sandals as they slapped on the blue tiled floor.",
      "She came to a library.",
      "The shelves were filled with dozens of scroll canisters.",
      "She put her hands behind her back so she could resist reaching out.",
      "She called out.",
      "\"Hello.",
      "Hello, Thoth.\"",
      "There was no answer but dust moving in a sunbeam from a window.",
      "She looked at the neat rows of canisters and examined the tags.",
      "She was very surprised to see one marked with her cartouche.",
      "Below her name was written, \"To help your quest.\"",
      "She whispered, \"He really can read the future.\"",
      "She took down the canister and opened it.",
      "Inside was a long scroll on very old papyrus.",
      "It crackled as she unrolled it.",
      "She saw that it was the Book of Thoth.",
      "There was red thread dangling halfway through the scroll.",
      "She unrolled it until she reached the thread.",
      "It marked the rite to make one that had gone into the deep earth an Akh, which is to say alive.",
      "She held her breath, and for a moment she really wanted to bring back her father or maybe her mother, but she knew that the rite shouldn't be used in that way.",
      "This was for her quest, not for her.",
      "Her heart felt both sorrow and happiness in that moment, which made her heart feel somewhat dizzy in her chest.",
      "Still, she wanted to be polite as Isis.",
      "She said to the room.",
      "\"Thank you!\"",
      "She put the scroll canister carefully in her woven bag.",
      "She walked out the way she came.",
      "As she closed the door, she found herself in the market and the key was a coin again.",
      "Her stomach grumbled and she laughed.",
      "It was such a normal thing.",
      "She bought what she had been sent to buy.",
      "As she went through the market, she saw little boys and girls with wide hungry eyes.",
      "She only had one coin, and she very much wanted to fill her belly.",
      "But when Isis was in Cebu, even though she was hungry herself, she fed the hungry there.",
      "She told herself that she only had one coin and that was just enough to feed herself, but she knew the coin wasn't meant for that.",
      "She took the coin and she tapped it on the deep earth.",
      "She said, \"This will make the land rich and will feed us forever.\"",
      "She held it there awhile and then she went to a smiling baker and said, \"I would like to buy four loaves of bread.\"",
      "The smiling baker laughed and gave her six.",
      "\"You look hungry, sweetling.\"",
      "Serqa knew that she must be hungry, because everyone could see it.",
      "Which meant that she was making the right choice.",
      "She gave away the loaves as she walked and didn't look back.",
      "So she did not see the smiling baker stop smiling and let out a long breath as the shadow soul of Cairo stretched and grew a little bigger.",
      "That evening, as Ra slipped away over the horizon, Serqa skipped up the steps to the roof even though she had had little to eat.",
      "She waved at Se-Osiris and his tall servant under the reed woven shade.",
      "The tall servant waved back, but Se-Osiris sat very still and looked at the horizon.",
      "However, she noticed that he was sitting closer.",
      "She called out, \"Good evening.\"",
      "The tall servant called back, \"Good evening!\"",
      "and he went about making Se-Osiris more comfortable in his chair.",
      "She turned to Betet, \"See what I have.\"",
      "She showed the canister tag to Betet.",
      "Betet said, \"What does it say?",
      "I cannot read it.\"",
      "Serqa stopped.",
      "It had never occurred to her that Betet could not read Khemet.",
      "Finally, Serqa said, \"It's for our quest.",
      "See, there is my cartouche.",
      "The magic is helping us.",
      "Here, I will show you how to read what it says.",
      "Now we just need to find the things it lists.",
      "They poured over the rite with Ermentherna, who looked grim and offered to ask her father for the brass ankh and the silver mirror.",
      "Betet looked even grimmer and said, \"The cook has myrrh, cinnamon, vervain, and footprint of Isis.\"",
      "She swallowed.",
      "\"I will get them from the locked part of the pantry.\"",
      "Serqa rolled up the scroll and put it away.",
      "\"Now we just need to find the head.\"",
      "Ermentherna looked less than thrilled.",
      "\"We need the head or it won't work.\"",
      "Serqa patted Ermentherna's shoulder.",
      "Ermentherna sighed, but did not argue.",
      "Betet grinned.",
      "\"It can't be worse than skinning an eel.",
      "Those things are nasty.\"",
      "She made a peeling gesture and Ermentherna rolled her eyes at her.",
      "They giggled in the night.",
      "In the morning, Cackling Geb woke Serqa with his laughter.",
      "As she opened her eyes, she smelled a plate of bread, still warm from the oven.",
      "It sat on the bricks between Serqa and Betet's mats.",
      "\"Betet, Betet look.\"",
      "Betet sat up.",
      "\"I really like this magic.\"",
      "She bowed to Cackling Geb.",
      "\"You're a much better father than my old one.\"",
      "She tore into the bread, but at a look from Serqa, she said, \"Thank you,\" to Cackling Geb.",
      "\"It's,\" she chewed, \"really good.\"",
      "They ate most of it, but Serqa left a crust for Anubis to feed her father and mother in the underworld.",
      "They looked again at all the doors and jumped in all the pools of light and pushed things in all the cracks they could find, but they didn't find a magic door.",
      "Serqa was philosophical about this.",
      "\"It's not the right time.",
      "When the magic is ready, we'll find it.\"",
      "They needed to find it.",
      "Euryale had started weeping at the end of every class that she taught.",
      "Stheno was aiming to hit with her rocks.",
      "Serqa helped Ermentherna write her father, who critiqued her use of certain words contextually, but after a second letter, he sent her what she'd asked for.",
      "Betet gathered other ingredients from the pantry, while Serqa distracted the Cook with a love story that had her saying, \"Oh, I never.",
      "Then what happened.\"",
      "Finally, they had everything, but no head.",
      "They sat on the roof together and stared at the items.",
      "\"Now what?\" said Ermentherna.",
      "That was when the trap door to the stairs below crashed open and Stheno raged onto the roof followed by weeping Euryale.",
      "Stheno looked at the jars sitting in front of Isis, who now sat on a small broken jar that Serqa had found behind a building one day.",
      "She saw the pile of spices and sacred implements.",
      "She saw the velum books on the bricks and she screamed, \"How dare you!",
      "You insolent worthless girls.\"",
      "She threw the spices and the objects off the roof and they flew far into the garden.",
      "She smashed Isis against the low wall.",
      "Isis broke into three pieces.",
      "Serqa cried out, \"No!\"",
      "Stheno struck her across her cheek in a blinding crack.",
      "Serqa fell to the ground.",
      "Stheno yelled, \"You.",
      "This was all your idea.\"",
      "Euryale picked up the jars.",
      "Tears trickled down her cheeks.",
      "Serqa said, \"Please, we're trying to help you.\"",
      "Euryale shook her head and went down the stairs.",
      "Stheno snarled.",
      "\"Ermentherna pick up your books and go downstairs.\"",
      "She gripped Betet by the arm and dragged Betet down the stairs.",
      "The trap door closed with a loud click and Serqa could hear the sound of a cross bar going across the door from below.",
      "She pounded on it and she called out, \"Please, we're trying to help you.\"",
      "But the trap door didn't open.",
      "Not that night and not the next day as Ra sailed across the hot sky.",
      "There was no shelter on the roof from Ra's jealous hot rays.",
      "There was no water either.",
      "Serqa had known hunger, but now she knew a thirst that dried her tongue so she couldn't speak the magic.",
      "She could only mumble it through crackled lips as she clutched the three pieces of Isis to her chest and sip at her own tears until she had no more to weep.",
      "Finally, the sun set and she panted at the cool on her blistered skin.",
      "She thought she felt something soft and wet on her skin.",
      "She thought she heard a low rumble voice whisper, \"Shh, shh, it will be wonderful.\"",
      "When she woke in the morning, she lay on a rope strung bed that swayed as she moved.",
      "She blinked up at a woven reed shelter that blocked the sun.",
      "Swaths of brilliant red cloth were draped on the reeds and swayed gently in the breeze.",
      "An urn of water that dripped with moisture sat on a painted plaster chest next to the bed.",
      "She poured herself a cup of water and drank every drop of it.",
      "There was a basket of dates and figs.",
      "She ate them until juice ran down her cheeks.",
      "She stood up on the rug that stretched over the roof and said, \"Thank you magic.",
      "You've saved my life.\"",
      "This was when she saw Isis, thick stripes of resin wet along the breaks, but in one piece.",
      "She knelt in front of her and whispered, \"Thank you.",
      "Thank you.",
      "Thank you.\"",
      "Cackling Geb laughed.",
      "He scampered across the roof and grabbed Isis.",
      "He ran across the low wall.",
      "Serqa chased after him.",
      "\"Hey, come back.\"",
      "She chased him across one roof, two roofs, three roofs.",
      "He jumped the narrow distance to another set of row houses.",
      "She jumped after him.",
      "He ran across the city and she followed him as Cairo's shadow soul grew small in the rising sun.",
      "They came to a cemetery, where the living lived with the dead.",
      "She ran after Cackling Geb through the sandstone structures and into one of them.",
      "Inside a set of stairs went up.",
      "She following Cackling Geb as he laughed and scampered up past the cemetery and up past the circling birds.",
      "Finally, they reached the single cloud that sat in the sky.",
      "On the cloud, a silver horse with golden wings ripped up long blades of white cloud grass from the cloud.",
      "A gold boar with bronze wings snuffled in the cloud dirt for cloud mushrooms.",
      "Cackling Geb raced across the cloud and jumped into the blue sky.",
      "Serqa heard a woman's laughter, but she couldn't see Geb.",
      "Serqa was very tired.",
      "She sat down on the cloud, which was quite soft and springy.",
      "The horse whickered at her and lipped at her cheek.",
      "She said, \"Hello.\"",
      "The boar snorted at her.",
      "She was thirsty, so she scooped up a bit of cloud, which tasted slightly sweet and very refreshing.",
      "The horse lipped at her cheek and nibbled at her hair.",
      "Serqa laughed because it tickled.",
      "At her laughter, the clouds waved as if in a wind and she saw the white wrapped figure of one of the dead.",
      "The boar snorted and glared at her with large red eyes as she got up.",
      "His wings moved restlessly.",
      "She knew in that moment that the boar and the horse were Medusa's sons and they guarded her body as best they could on this cloud.",
      "Cackling Geb poked his head through the cloud.",
      "He held a roughly woven sack.",
      "It hissed as he carried it.",
      "\"Oh,\" said Serqa, \"But I don't have any of the things that were in the Book of Thoth.",
      "Cackling Geb tilted his head as if to say that he couldn't do everything.",
      "Serqa nodded, because that was true.",
      "She knew the words and Euryale had the jars and the spices were spread out in the gymnasium's garden as an offering.",
      "Suddenly, thinking of the statues in the garden, she wondered if this was a good idea, but then she thought of Isis, who had pitied her brother Set in the final battle and spared his life.",
      "\"Which was why her son, Horus, cut her head off, but her father, Thoth, grew her a cow's head,\" she explained to the horse and the boar.",
      "The boar glared when she mentioned heads being cut off, so she supposed he was touchy about that sort of thing.",
      "She took the hissing bag, and with her eyes closed, pulled out the head, which she put next to the white wrapped body.",
      "She took the horse's mane and braided it into a silver mirror.",
      "She asked very nicely for a bronze feather from the boar.",
      "She twisted it into an ankh.",
      "She whispered the name of Ra as it was written in the Book of Thoth and she asked the magic, very nicely, for help.",
      "Medusa screamed, not like Stheno screamed in rage, but like the little ones at the gymnasium sometimes did in terror.",
      "Serqa didn't think.",
      "She gathered Medusa in her arms, and rocked the much larger woman back and forth.",
      "\"Shhh.",
      "Shhh.",
      "It's okay.",
      "I have you.\"",
      "After what seemed like hours, Medusa pulled away from her.",
      "She stretched and the white wrappings pulled away.",
      "She said, in a voice that sounded like a snake and an eagle and the wind from a far off sea, \"Thank you.\"",
      "Serqa didn't look up.",
      "She didn't want to be turned to stone.",
      "She felt strong arms wrap around her and Medusa leapt off the edge of the cloud.",
      "Serqa could see great wings move around them and they flew.",
      "The boar and the horse flew around them.",
      "The horse galloped and played, while the boar flew in a straight line.",
      "Medusa touched down on the roof of the row house.",
      "Serqa said, \"Oh, but you've put me down on the wrong roof.\"",
      "But Medusa had already flown away.",
      "Serqa smiled at Se-Osiris, who was looking at Isis in his hands and therefore had neither turned to stone or even noticed Serqa and the flying snake woman, flying horse, and flying boar.",
      "She cleared her throat, because she didn't want to startle him.",
      "She said, \"Hello, that's my Isis.",
      "May I have it back?",
      "The magic saved me, but I need to help my friends.\"",
      "Se-Osiris looked up at her.",
      "He was very old and frail, and he was crying.",
      "He said, \"This was my daughter's.\"",
      "He wiped away at a tear on his cheek.",
      "\"I gave it to her.",
      "It was all she took when she turned from me to marry a Hellene.\"",
      "He drew his finger along the cartouche written on the bottom of Isis' foot.",
      "\"When I turned my heart away from her.\"",
      "He laughed and he cried.",
      "\"I have sent messengers looking everywhere for her child since I learned that she went into the deep earth.\"",
      "He held his hand to his face over his eyes.",
      "\"I sent Aions over the wall because I took pity on you and hoped someone would take pity on her child.\"",
      "He took his hand away again.",
      "Great tears trembled on the edges of his red rimmed eyes.",
      "\"You were here all along.\"",
      "\"Oh,\" said Serqa, who for once wasn't sure what to say.",
      "She hugged him instead, but carefully, because he was old.",
      "Although, it turned out, not really as old as she'd thought, just unwell, and little old.",
      "She'd thought he'd been thousands of years old, and he wasn't that old at all.",
      "His tall servant, Aions, turned out to be his son and therefore Serqa's uncle.",
      "Aions came up soon and hugged them both.",
      "He said, \"When I fixed Isis, I should have looked at her foot.",
      "Or when I left bread or the lamp or,\" He picked Serqa up and swung her around so that her feet flew through the air.",
      "He laughed and hugged her and said, \"You sound just like Asnofre.",
      "She'd say, 'You have the soul of the earth little one,' and she'd tickle me.",
      "What a wonderful day.\"",
      "He tickled Serqa.",
      "\"Isn't it a wonderful day?",
      "Say it.\"",
      "She laughed and said, \"It's a wonderful day,\" and \"Oh, stop, I'm laughing too hard,\" and \"I need to help my friends.\"",
      "But the magic wasn't done yet.",
      "Betet looked over the low wall at Serqa.",
      "She said, \"You did it.",
      "The gymnasium is in chaos.",
      "Medusa flew through the door and, and Euryale laughed and Stheno laughed and they all flew into the garden.",
      "Look.\"",
      "Serqa looked and the three women were perched on the wall together and were making some sort of garment that dangled between the three of them down the wall.",
      "Medusa was veiled, but she was easy to recognize.",
      "Serqa helped Betet over the wall.",
      "She said to her new grandfather and uncle, \"This is my sister, Betet.",
      "We were goddesses together in the womb of the night.\"",
      "Se-Osiris cried a little again and Aions said, \"Asnofre spoke in exactly the same way.\"",
      "He clapped his hands together.",
      "\"And now I have two nieces, where once I had none.",
      "Fabulous day.\"",
      "He hugged them both.",
      "Later they had Ermentherna over for lemon water and honey cakes, because there were certainly no lessons that day.",
      "The teachers were all sitting on the garden wall, while the students were taking rides on the flying horse and boar.",
      "It was later, when Medusa, her eyes wrapped in funeral bindings, held her class on love, compassion, justice and forgiveness that Serqa had the idea.",
      "She passed a note to Ermentherna and Betet that read, \"The magic wants us to turn back the statues next.\"",
      "So, they did.",
      "Like when Isis went to live in the marsh and begged for food for her baby, Serqa went to live on the roof of the Gorgos Sisters Hellenic Gymnasium for girls.",
      "Like Isis, she had a curse to lift and steps to take through the world that was full of magic if you'd stop to tell the tale.",

    "text": "Origins She leaves the changing room cool as you please with her hands still and dry at her sides and her head held high. She heads right back into the fray of the shop to browse a bit, because there's nothing more suspicious than leaving straight off after the changing rooms. She's looking at a jacquard jacket when a warm, solid body fills the space beside her, crowding a bit. The scent of cinnamon and leather creeps over her shoulder as a mouth tips to her ear. \"I saw that.\" Amusement. \"Clever to come in already wearing a padded bra.\" Jay flushes and turns to see a beautiful man with sly eyes and a riot of black curls, just barely touched with salt-and-pepper gray at his temples. He looks young, though, and fit, and his blue suit makes him look tall and trim. But he's wearing bright gold trainers and carrying an ebony cane, and Jay wonders briefly if he might be a pimp. The man leans a little closer, and Jay thinks that she should push him away... but she doesn't really want to, and besides, if she makes a scene, she'll get caught. \"Security will be around in a minute. You might want to mosey towards the exit.\" He's American. Jay hasn't ever actually met an American before. She's barely been out of Doncaster; London was supposed to be romantic and special and then - well. The lout. She doesn't need him anyway. Jay raises an eyebrow, but gives the man a smile. \"Thanks...\" He doesn't follow her, but when Jay gets back outside into the gray London April, he's standing there waiting for her, leaning up against the side of a Bugatti and tapping his cane idly against the side of his shoe. Jay narrows her eyes, but smiles. \"Alright, then. Thank you and all. Now fuck off.\" When he grins, his cheek dimples and it makes him look younger. \"Sorry you got ditched today, Jay. He doesn't know what he's missing.\" That stops her in her tracks. \"Really, now, fuck off,\" she says, feeling her cheeks burn. \"I don't know how he told you, but - it's not funny.\" \"I'm sorry.\" He sounds sincere. \"It isn't funny. But he didn't tell me anything, Jay, and... you don't have to worry about him anymore.\" Jay turns slowly. \"You didn't - he's not hurt, is he?\" \"No,\" the man assures her. \"He's not hurt.\" There's a long pause. A double-decker bus full of tourists goes rumbling down the street and there's a flutter of camera flashes as the gaggle of Americans and Germans and Japanese take photos of Harrods and Knightsbridge. The gray sky sags and it begins to spit rain that's neither warm nor cool, just... London in April. \"Are you interesting in dining at The Square?\" Jay's head snaps up to look at the man. \"I'm not going to sleep with you.\" \"Okay,\" says the man easily. He taps his cane against the side of his gold shoe again. \"Are you interested in dining at The Square?\" He grins again and there are those dimples. \"The kedgeree is kind of dynamite.\" Logically, Jay knows that she should say no - and probably get as far away from this strange man as quickly as she can; duck into another shop, maybe. But there's something magnetic about him that's more than just his confidence... something maybe about the cheeky, sly look in his eyes, like even though he's grown he could still get up to some banter, and that intrigues her more than it discomfits her and so she says, \"Sure. But I'm still not sleeping with you.\" They go to The Square and somehow, this American knows the chef and tells him it's Jay's birthday (it isn't) and she gets a surprise dessert, chocolate pave with French cherries soaked in kirsch that makes her a little dizzy. The souffle towers like something magical and if you had told Jay that morning that by evening she would be sitting in a fancy restaurant like a proper lady eating foie gras and caviar - she decides she likes the first, but not the second - then well, she'd have laughed in your face. The American is all banter and so, so charming. He runs marathons, he tells her, and he lives in New York City but travels often to Los Angeles. She asks what he does there but all he says is that he's a bit of a messenger and an inventor and he's working on something he tells her he calls 'the internet,' something to do with computers and it sounds sort of daft, really, but the way his eyes light when he talks about it makes it seem like it could make sense, someday. They drink a 1989 Beaucastel Chateauneuf-du-Pape and an '87 Cabernet Sauvignon and they don't taste anything like the thin, turpentine wines that Jay gets drunk on back in Doncaster with the lout and his footie mates; this tastes like plums and herbs and blackberries and California and so does the American's mouth when she kisses him in the Bugatti. She does sleep with him. And the next night. And then he goes back to New York City, and a few weeks later, Jay is nineteen years old and beautiful and pregnant. Louis is born Christmas Eve. She doesn't have a name for the birth certificate, so he's just Louis Tomlinson. On New Year's, she hears a sound from the bedroom just as they're counting down on television and she runs in to see the American standing beside the bassinet with Louis in his arms. The baby's awake and staring at his father with a little wrinkle in his brow, like he's trying to decide whether to start howling. \"How'd you get in here?\" Jay asks with a knot in her stomach. It grows into a hot flash of betrayal and anger and it's all well and good that he can jet around the world dicking with computers and gold trainers and drinking Chateauneuf-du-Pape and eating foie gras when now she's fucking stuck in Doncaster with a baby (and she loves Louis, she does; more than she ever thought she could love anything) but Doncaster and baby and a stolen designer scarf are all she has now. \"The fuck are you doing here? Put my baby down!\" Hermes kisses Louis' crinkled brow and settles him back into the bassinet. He looks old when he stands again and regards Jay. Ancient. \"There's something you need to know about Louis.\" 002. b Islamabad is bright and hot and beautiful. He didn't expect it to be beautiful. There are as many lights as in New York, and spires and columns and arches and domes. He darkens his skin just a little and crops his black hair short. He's grateful for his blue eyes and keeps them, blinks against the sudden sting of smoke as a hotpot of crabs sizzles into spicy-smelling life at the side of the road near a knot of boisterous people. There are cars and men and children and oxen in the street, and it's as crowded as New York, but differently. He stops at a towering pyramid display of pickled vegetables and fruits in colors so bright they're nearly neon, and looks from the violent purple of the striped beetroot to the gentle lavender of the cloth being traded at the stand beside and he smiles even as his heart trip-hammers off-rhythm in his chest. Islamabad presses against his skin like a warning: This is not your place, pater. Go back to the West. Zeus has nothing in the West but a twice-broken pact and an angry Sea brother with his own mistake growing in Manhattan; an angry wife and the ruins of the 1980s scraping up against the base of Olympus on Wall Street. The horns sound for prayer alert one minute after the sun hits its zenith (not Apollo, this sun is brighter and hotter and does not give Zeus the same hug as his son's sky) and the street around Zeus slows and stops and gets to its knees. The East presses against Zeus' bones and he buckles to his knees, too, as the East whispers this is not your place, pater, this is ours and you will revere us. Zeus breathes in deep and touches his head to the ground and follows the crowd around him, mimicking movement for movement. He feels like a human. This was what he wanted. He spends the next month wandering around Islamabad, and slowly, the ache in his bones eases. This is still not his place, the sun is still not Apollo's and the moon not Artemis', but it stops hurting. He kneels in prayer with everyone else because he wants to, because he wanted to feel human and prayer makes him feel human, makes him forget that Jupiter has a son in California and Zeus has a daughter in New York and damned Poseidon has that baby in Manhattan and he never thought that Hades would be the most - It's not to worry about. He is outside of Olympus' domain now, and he has no worries. On some days, he is an old man with a long white beard and milky eyes. He wraps a turban around his head and sits in the teahouses drinking Kashmiri subz chai from flat dishes and listening to the old men's stories. He learns about his domain - how people see Olympus' West. Sometimes it makes him sad. Sometimes, it makes him think. He drinks thick green tea fragrant with cardamom and pistachio and almost prickling with carbonate, and he eats dahi burra with hot chutneys and he listens to what the problems are with his West in the way that only an old man can. On other days, he is a child, and he plays in the street with the other children. They roll hoops and play with bouncing balls and he learns that some people do not even know there is a West. There is no Olympus to them, there is no Zeus. There is home, and there is Allah, and there is mummy and daddy and prayer and play, but there is no pact and no Kronos and no Tartarus and no struggle for power between the sky, sea, and earth. He feeds oxen lumps of food from his palm and lets their lips tickle his hand, and sings songs to learn clapping games for. His heart aches from missing the West, but for the first time in all eternity, he thinks that maybe the East has its place, too. And on the rest of the days, he is a young man, and he loves Tricia. She has a student visa and is studying Urdu for Foreigners at NUML, and even though she's from his West she's immersed herself in the culture of the city so much that sometimes he feels like he can feel the East buzzing inside her like a light when he touches her. She lived 'abroad' as a child, she tells him on their first date as she eats a karela pyaz masala with pieces of bread - as though 'abroad' is a place. Zeus smiles and laughs as says as much as he tucks her hair behind her ear, and she smiles and kisses his wrist with lips that smell of spices. She takes him to the university, which has a funny mix of his own Grecian columns and the East's domes on its main building, and he touches the column gently with his fingertips as he kisses Tricia goodbye for the day at the front steps. He sits on the grass and watches the handball players while he waits for Tricia to come out of classes. She's radiant when she comes down the university steps, wearing a bright turquoise shalwar khameez and speaking earnestly in Urdu to a dark-skinned woman in a hijab. Zeus waits to the side until she notices him and smiles brilliantly, and he produces a bouquet of jasmine behind his back to hand her, and she breathes them in and her hair blows up behind her. And Zeus finally seduces her that night. They're lying in his bed afterwards while she draws patterns against his side, practicing her Arabic, and he tells her who he is. He splits the sky into a twelve-hue sunset and swirls it over with clouds to spike lightning from cloud-to-cloud without spilling a drop of rain, and it hurts because this is not your sky, pater, you have no rights here, but the smile on Tricia's face and the awe in her eyes when she climbs over him again makes it worth it. She believes him. Zeus cradles her close and calls her malka, queen. Somewhere distant inside him, he can feel the West slipping away from him. And he doesn't think he minds. Weeks later, though, he lies awake beside her, watching her face in sleep. Outside, the rainy season is beginning the first assault of monsoons, roaring against the roof and the windows and the buzzing in his bones is back. This is not your domain. You cannot stop the rains here. We are going to wash you away. Zeus lifts his hand to touch the side of Tricia's face and watches the color drain from his skin as he becomes himself again, curly black hair and olive skin and the shadow of a beard on his jaw. His eyes rage blue. Tricia wakes slowly, humming. She blinks in surprise at his Greek face, but smiles and touches his prickly jaw. \"What's wrong?\" Zeus blinks sadly and slides his hand beneath the linen of Tricia's nightdress to rest against her belly. \"I can't protect you here,\" he murmurs. \"This isn't my domain. I can't protect him here.\" Tricia sucks in a breath and her hands fly down to her belly, too, and her palms press Zeus' fingers closer into her skin. \"Him?\" Zeus doesn't speak. He just kisses the crest of her hairline. \"Are we going back to New York?\" Tricia asks, her mind reeling. Zeus looks so sad. \"He wouldn't be safe in New York, either. He isn't supposed to exist - I made a pact. With my brothers. He's my son. He's too powerful. Olympus isn't a place for him.\" Tricia's eyes darken. \"You're leaving me. You're leaving - us. You told me that there are monsters and...\" Zeus touches his forehead to Tricia's brow. \"I am still his father. He will be strong and protected and very, very hard to kill. And even when I'm not there, you are his mother, malka. You can protect him because that is what you would do.\" \"Where can we go?\" Zeus sighs and scrubs his stubbly chin against her neck. \"England. Raise him in England. Keep him off boats and out of the sky.\" He kisses her, sweet and lingering, while the monsoon blows hard against the roof, trying to get inside. \"You're leaving now.\" She touches the side of his neck. Zeus closes his eyes. \"After the rain season. Go to England. You can protect him there.\" \"Okay.\" She doesn't cry. Her hand runs soft circuits over her belly, like she can't believe that she's really pregnant. \"Will we ever see you again?\" Zeus doesn't answer her. Instead he stands, his peplos and himation swathing him and the crown of oak leaves growing to settle around his head. He looks down at Tricia and touches her chin. \"Will you do me a favor?\" She nods and kisses his fingers. \"Raise him Muslim,\" Zeus says. \"Make sure he knows that he is from both the West and the East. I have had many children, malka. But make sure he knows that he is special.\" 003. g Olympus without Zeus, mused Aphrodite, was a bit of a shitshow. Hera was livid, Poseidon gloated, Apollo and Hermes were off seducing not-even-the-gods-knew-how-many mortals... even Athena and Hephaestus and Dionysis, who usually had a modicum more discretion, seemed to take Zeus' absence as carte blanche for mortal dalliances. And dalliances were all well and good! Of course: they were the spice of life, the spark, the sizzle. Aphrodite had invented the dalliance (mania and erotica and pasionata). But. The last time there were this many demigods running around unchecked, there had been a world war. That's the sort of thing that interrupts her own l'amour clandestine with Ares, so really, couldn't her brothers (and Athena's brain, she supposes) do a bit better with wrapping things up? Alright, yes, she had that baby girl down in the bayou two years ago, left in a shop that smelled like chocolate and cream... and then the beautiful girl in Chinatown last year... and alright, Tristan McLean was irresistible just a few months before, but... really. She's the goddess of fertility. For her, these things just happen. But she knows, the way all gods know when there's an aching need for them in the world, that it doesn't work that way for herself and her brothers and sisters. There's so much more familial love, agape and materna, flowing through skin and wind and water than there are people to absorb it. It prickles at Aphrodite's heart like tiny fingers. That's how she ends up working at the little clinic in Wolverhampton and Newcastle-under-Lyme. She's made herself full-figured and plump and brunette, and she likes the way her red-rimmed glasses look against her brown hair and lavender nursing scrubs. She smiles at everyone and watches the waiting room like a bird of prey, waiting for the right people to bless. She may be the goddess of love, but love is, if anything, not fair. She meets Karen fairly early on, just a few weeks into staying. Karen is not a beautiful woman, but there is a staid elegance about her that immediately attracts Aphrodite. She wears her hair in a sensible bun at the nape of her neck and her posture announces that she's a detective with the CID before she does. She fills out her forms very matter-of-fact, but Aphrodite can feel the passion behind them. Two daughters, three miscarriages, complications in the most recent birth, thought to be due to injury on the force. She wants a son. Aphrodite feels that love radiating out of Karen all soft and warm and blue-gold-pink, and it's brighter than the cool jade green of her love for her job and for England. On Karen's second visit, she sits down beside a fifteen-year-old girl who shines hot fuchsia-orange-violet for her boyfriend, even though she's almost eight months along and Aphrodite knows from her forms that she's planning to keep it herself. Aphrodite can't hear from the desk what the two women are talking about, but the girl is laughing and Karen flares with silver affection and it touches the girl's skin to seep in like oil. Karen waits patiently while the girl goes in for her appointment - and when she leaves, the fuchsia edges of her love are pulsing with soft, warm blue-gold-pink. Aphrodite smiles and sneaks a look at Karen's file. The prognosis is not good. A few weeks later, Karen is back and smiling placidly as usual. She takes her seat this time beside a thin woman with a severe bob and tousled bangs whose love outlines her florid teal with pragma but Aphrodite can see the faded halo of yellow independata: a woman with tremendous self-pride and worth - but flustered, questioning, fading. She doesn't laugh as she and Karen talk, but that silver affection oozes from Karen all the same and sinks into the thin woman. They have to wait for half an hour before it's time for Karen's appointment, and by the time Karen gives her a hug on her way out of the waiting room, the yellow is bright, sparkling gold again. They touch arms again as Karen makes her way to Aphrodite's desk to schedule another appointment and the thin woman heads in for her procedure. Hours later, when she comes back out and rings for a cab home, she's still sparkling gold, even though she looks tired around the eyes. Aphrodite decides then that Olympus without Zeus is a bit of a shitshow anyway - one more demigod won't hurt. She goes back to the little flat that she's keeping in Park Village, with wide-looped crochet curtains in her windows and a curious couple across the way whom she lets watch her change at night, because ludus love is nothing to be ashamed of, anyway. She puts on a kettle of tea and turns Corrie on the telly to play softly in the background, because Aphrodite likes the chutzpah of Tanya Pooley. She strips off in front of the window and crosses back to her kettle to pour the water into her mug before she slips into her dressing gown. She drinks her tea and watches the end of Coronation Street and touches herself for a while. And then she sets a dish of water on her night table, makes a scallop shell, and lets all of the storge - mauve-purple-blush and a little plush - pour into the shell's mirror. She's never made a baby out of this kind of love before, and she wonders just how it will turn out. She makes sure to make him a boy. A few weeks later, it's August in Wolverhampton. It's unusually cool and dry for the season, and Aphrodite feels the call in her bones like all of the Olympians that Zeus is home, and he is not happy, and for some reason, that stormy sadness is swirling above England. She bundles the baby, shell and all, into swaddling clothes and brings him to Bilston. She doesn't keep the same face and figure she'd worn at the clinic and instead becomes herself again, with flowing titian curls and eyes that shift color in the sun. Outside the Paynes' door, Aphrodite tilts her head to kiss him again before she settles him in his basket. He's such a curious baby, this placid, serious Liam-thing. She waits just out of sight, half-shaded by a box tree, until the door opens and Karen's face peers down at little Liam. Her hair is undone and falling to dust her shoulders and her dressing gown is on just askew. She bends, slowly, to pick up the little pink bundle of Liam Payne, and he's still silent, just blinking big brown eyes and one tiny hand coming out of the swaddling to pad into her eye. The entire street seems to glow in the rush of blue-gold-pink. 004. D Maura hates Mullingar. She hates the barracks and she hates Christ the King cathedral; she hates the Grenville Arms and she hates Oliver Plunkett Street and she hates Cassidy's and Finn's and Druid's Chair and Gilleran's and Kerrigan's and Hughes' Corner House and Danny Byrne's and Canton Casey's and Caffrey's and McCormick's and Wallace's and Daly's and Gallagher's and Cosgrove's and Con's and Murray's and Dolan's and Cheers and Kenny's and George Evan's and Butler's and beer. She's starting to hate Bobby. She doesn't hate Greg at all, the lamb, but sometimes - and she feels so badly about this that it's driven her to Keenan's - she might... hate being a mother. Or at least, she hates the way that being a mother in Mullingar in 1993 makes her feel; all Gaelic football and the drone of the Dublin-Sligo line and Greg won't keep quiet about that stupid UFO back in March and it just makes her teeth hurt, because football is no reason for Bobby not to come home and tell his son that aliens wouldn't even bother to land in Mullingar, Ireland, for christ's sake. But now the Shamrocks' season is over and Bobby is actually at home, and he commented over tea that the bolognese seemed a bit salty and it gave Maura a bit of a sting in her back teeth, like they were struggling to say out the words she couldn't because she's a mum in Mullingar and it's all well and good for Bobby to go out for months every night and have fun with the lads but what does she get? Fish Fridays and Ciara at the Scoil Mhuire parent group calling every five minutes with gossip Maura doesn't care about and doesn't need to have running through her head at the market and complaints about the salt in the bolognese. Well, the Shamrocks' season is over and he can stay home to field calls from Ciara about whose daughter is to be avoided because whose mother was out kissing whose husband so said Fiona last Saturday and fuck all, who cares? Not Maura, as she sits in Keegan's, turning a pint glass around and around in her hands and thinking, I hate the taste of beer. She wishes Aoife still lived in Mullingar. Beer never tasted quite so bad when she was sitting at the next barstool over. \"You don't like the Trouble Or?\" asks an amused voice from behind her. It's not slurring yet, but there's something strange about it. \"Aroma is mushroomy, floral, hint of butter... got some plum and papaya on the palate and oats in the finish... not bad. What's not to like?\" Maura turns to look up at the man; he's got curls and a round jowl and he's not quite handsome, but his face is harmless enough that she just shrugs. \"Don't like beer.\" He grins. \"Me, neither. I'm more of a wine guy.\" He sticks out his hand. \"I'm D.\" Maura tilts her head. He's American. Doesn't seem like the sort to go on a James Joyce walking tour, but books could get all sorts of tourists, she guesses. She shakes his hand. \"Maura.\" \"What a great old Irish name.\" He pulls out the barstool beside hers and gestured towards it. \"Can I?\" Maura shrugs and nods - he isn't quite handsome, but he's magnetic and he isn't hollering about the Shamrocks or picking a fight over snooker in the corner, so really, what does it hurt? Besides. She's married. D grins at Maura and rests his elbow on the bar and his chin against the meat of his palm. \"Tell me about yourself.\" \"I'm a mum,\" Maura says. \"My husband's a manager at Dunnes and I have a son at Scoil Mhuire.\" \"Well, now I know about your husband and your son,\" laughs D, \"But what about you?\" Well, that knocks Maura for six. \"Ehm,\" she fumbles, \"I've lived in Mullingar all me life. And... I don't like beer.\" \"That's all there is to you?\" Maura turns her glass in her hands again. \"Feels that way, yeah. I suppose.\" D considers her for a long time, and normally Maura would blush and look away - or tell him to fuck off, depending on the look in his eyes - but he just seems sad and kind of interested and his eyes are this strange color, a deep brown that's almost burgundy and it reminds her of California, which is stupid because she's only seen it on television, and of Tuscany, which is stupid because she's only seen it in books. The cookbook where she got her bolognese recipe for tonight had a big photo of a huge, rolling Tuscan vineyard on the front, all green and gold and deep purple-red. His eyes remind her of that. So she just fiddles with her glass and looks back. Then D stands and puts his hands in his pockets as he rocks back on his heels like a hobbyhorse. \"It's kinda loud in here. You want to go somewhere?\" He takes out hand back out of his pocket and holds it up, flat-palmed. \"No funny business.\" Maura looks around and sees nothing but Mullingar in every bleeding inch of the bar, so she stands up and says, \"Alright.\" D gets a bottle of wine from... somewhere... and after she's downed half the dark-cherry-and-red-bramble bottle, Maura has entirely too much fun saying its Spanish name the way D does, \"rrrrrrrr-ee-oh-ha.\" The end up by Lough Owel, and there's a second bottle of wine, something white and sparkling that tickles her tongue, and Maura says, \"I went to college for history, and I wanted to be an archaeologist? Travel to Greece and Rome and that and dig up old things, you know, see how people lived thousands of years ago. 'Cause it's just - you know, there had to be more life then, or else why would people keep on to now? Is this really all there is to living? Fish on Friday and pub on Sunday and doing science projects all week because they're too hard for the kids and the carpet's always full of mud and the husband's never home, and then when he is home... what's it worth, really? So I think thousands of years ago, you know, I wanted to go and find that more. They had gods and monsters. And we got what, the Shamrocks and Joe Dolan. I figure that there had to be a thing that made them want to keep the Earth going and do all they did. I wanted to find it.\" A few months later, Maura is helping Greg to make yet another poster about that damned UFO and outer space, and she explains to Greg that she has a baby in her tummy and he's going to be a big brother. Greg asks if the baby came from the stars, and Maura says yes. Niall - his name means 'champion,' because Maura believes that names say a lot about a person and she wants him to win a place outside of Mullingar one day - is born wailing. He has a thick fluff of white hair and when he blinks open his eyes, just for a second, the blue is ringed at the pupil with a soft winey gold. Just a light, sparkling blush, like the sun glancing off the brick of a Tuscan vineyard or the gilded roll of a rioja. Maura was still a mum in Mullingar, and she still resented Bobby for never being home and complaining when he was, and there was always mud in the carpets and the parent group at Scoil Mhuire and years of science projects about outer space, but when Maura looks at Niall, she feels like there's a bit more freedom in her life than she thought, and she knows that there's more to who she is than meets the eye. 005. O Harry is five years old the first time he sees them. He's been five for a long time - a thousand years, or thereabouts. He doesn't keep track. After all, he's only five. He likes being five; it's one of his favorite ages. He never gets into trouble when he's five, and he can curl up in Mum's lap to go to sleep whenever he likes. They're in France. They've been in France for two hundred years or so. It's safe there. No one would ever think to look for Harry in France. They spend most of their days in the Jardin du Luxembourg, and Harry tumbles about on the grass and splashes in the fountains and plays Crochet et Boiser with the little girls. He climbs trees and draws on the sides of statues and grins at everyone all the time, because he's small and cute and his eyes are the size of the moon. Old women pick him up and coo and give him berlingots de Nantes that turn his lips and tongue bright red. Roudoudou demain, s'il vous plait! he demands, pulling at their sleeves. They kiss him all over his face and bring him the roudoudou the next day, and he sits on the lion statue's back and licks the candy out of its seashells. His mother sits only feet away all the time when they're outside. She can't bear to let him out of her sight; part of that is just motherly love. And no one can love her children like Rhea. The mother of all of the gods, the mother of all things, child of only the earth and the sky. Her other children can never know about Harry. Not even his father. Especially not his father. Harry runs over with his mouth and chin sticky and green from the roudoudou, waving his wax seashell happily, and settles down in Rhea's lap. He curls her long hair around one fist and tucks his face against her collar and promptly goes to sleep. Around the park, all of the old women and all of the little girls stop and watch him for a moment and smile inwardly, their hands clutched to their bosoms or cupped to their chins. Son of Rhea, son of Eros. The missing Olympian, always hidden. Harry is the god of infatuation and mischief, and as much as no one can resist him, he can't resist the things he loves even more. So when he sees them for the first time, January 15, 1964, as he gallops - alongside his mother with a baguette perched on one small shoulder - past the Paris Olympia, Harry's whole world suddenly cuts and tethers on new to someone else. To something else; a new idea, a new need, a new style. A new rhythm. He is so suddenly smitten that within days, the rest of the world follows with him, spiraling into an obsession that would never quite be matched. Outside the Paris Olympia, John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Richard Starkey smoke their cigarettes and shake out their floppy hair and behind them, a track of \"She Loves You\" blares out onto the street. \"Maman!\" Harry crows, pointing at them, his green eyes huge and shining. \"Regardez! Ecoutez!\" \"Oui, mon cher-coeur. Sont tres joli,\" Rhea sighs, fixing her hand on Harry's. \"Venez.\" That night, after they've eaten supper and Rhea has kissed Harry's face and gone to sleep, Harry becomes sixteen. His bones stretch out just that little too much; he keeps hollows around his hipbones and clavicle, but gives himself a little muscle in his abdomen and chest. His hair is still curly, though, and his cheeks still dimpled, and his eyes still huge and shining and green. He takes the mirror from the wall over the bathroom sink and props it up in his bedroom so he can admire himself for a while, twisting at all angles. Merde. Somehow he's given himself four nipples. He frowns and pokes at one of the extra ones, but he can't seem to make them go away. No matter. He's sixteen again now - he'd forgotten how much he loved being sixteen; his father was Eros, after all, he fucking loves being sixteen - and there are more important things to attend to than a few extra nipples. He turns a bit to check out his rear and nods appreciatively, then stands with his hips out to check out what, now that he's back to sixteen, is clearly the most important part of him. He grins. He might have four nipples, but at least this turned out well. He lifts it curiously to feel the weight in his hand, then remembers, oh, I'm sixteen and touching my chauve a col roule, and lets the memory of Paul McCartney sucking on his cigarette fill his head until he's heavy and hard and gets off twice over the pillows. The sun just barely begins to rise over the rooftops and Harry looks out at it, watching Apollo's chariot roll up over the east, and opens the window to lean out. \"Au revoir, Paris!\" he shouts, and likes his new sixteen-year-old voice. He throws his arms out and laughs uproariously as two old Breton women in their lace hats look up at him from the street and shade their eyes against the sun to cluck disapprovingly at his nakedness. He takes a last cold lungful of Paris air and darts back into his bedroom. He makes himself a collarless suit, chic and posh and gray, and shakes out his curls before swiping them to the side to smile at himself in the mirror - ducking his head to peek out through his fringe the way he'd seen John do outside the Olympia - before skipping down the hall to his mother's room. Rhea is awake, sitting at the side of her bed with her long, black hair in a braid down her back. The look on her face glowed placid and fierce at once: the sort of look that bloomed mountains. Harry curls up beside her like he did when he was five. \"Tous n'etes pas cinq annees,\" Rhea says, not looking at her smallest son. \"Je veux aller en Angleterre,\" Harry answered. When he spoke again, it was in a deep, raspy voice, slow and with a curling Northern mumble. \"I think I'm English now, anyway. I really fancy a tea.\" Rhea laughed then, and turned to kiss Harry's brow. \"Alright, sweetheart,\" she said. \"We'll go to England.\" They end up in a tiny Cheshire village - two streetlights, a church, and a bakery; very picturesque - and Harry falls in with a group of mortal boys to make a terrible racket on guitars and drums. Rhea has to laugh watching them. Harry is as demanding at sixteen as he had been pleading for roudoudou in the park at five, except now he demanded quicker tempo and more drums and lyric changes. They called their band \"White Eskimo\" and the girls' school let them play at the spring mixer. Harry is delivered home, looking sweaty and not the least bit sheepish, by an incensed nun at half-seven, after she'd quite literally stumbled upon Harry and all three senior officers of the Young Ladies' Charitable Pep Club in full undress at the back of the coats closet. Rhea - called \"Anne\" now in England; she'd been \"Antoinette\" in France if people spoke to her at all - apologizes profusely for her son and promises fifty Hail Marys to Mother Magdalene. Once the nun has stormed off, Harry throws his head back and laughs belly-deep. \"Mum!\" he cries. \"There was a man at the dance who says he wants to bring White Eskimo to London! He said we could be 'the next Beatles'!\" Harry's green mooneyes shine. Rhea kisses his forehead. \"No.\" Harry's face falls like rain melting colored chalk from the sidewalk, and he catches his lip between his teeth. \"No?\" \"Harry,\" Rhea says softly, \"Your brothers will find you.\" \"So?\" Harry asks defiantly, puffing out his chest, \"Let them find me! I'm no threat to them. Everyone loves me, besides.\" Rhea cups a hand over his flushed cheek. \"That is what makes you so dangerous, sweetest heart. They will fall into such obsession with you that they would steal you away to Olympus and forget about the world. They have their own duties and purposes, Harry; they can't lose themselves in love to you.\" \"But being lost in love is good. Especially with me.\" Harry's face is a mask of innocence. Rhea strokes his cheek with her thumb. \"Infatuation isn't quite the same as love, sweetheart. It's the most dangerous love of all. It's the kind of love that makes good mortals and good gods do the worst things.\" So Harry stays in Church Hulme. The rest of White Eskimo go on to London without him, and without him, they change their name to The Who. Harry blessed them before they left him, and he watches quietly from his tiny parish in Cheshire as they forget all about their first lead singer and lead a whole demographic to sing about their g-g-g-generation. Harry sings in the street, and sings sometimes at The Old Red Lion, and sings flirty little ditties to girls on the path home from school while he trips charmingly on his boots and peeks out from beneath his curls. He watches everything he can of the Beatles. He keeps a badge of their faces pinned to his schoolbag. In 1974, Church Hulme changes its name to Holmes Chapel, and John Lennon plays three songs at Madison Square Garden with Elton John. On December 8, 1980, Harry finally understands what his mother meant about infatuation being dangerous. A world away, in the shadow of Olympus, John Lennon is dead. And Harry knows, like all gods know their own divine work, that it is his fault. That night, Rhea hears him crying in his room and rushes in to find that Harry is a baby, wailing and inconsolable and wanting nothing to do with the world or love outside of the tiny domain of his mother and warm milk and napping on a blanket in the soft patches of warmth the sun paints on their living room floor. Loving anything else seems - it scares him, and he cries and cries and cries until he's too exhausted to move and falls asleep, sniffling, on Rhea's shoulder. He stays a baby for the next fourteen years. On some days, he's a toddler, and they go to the park so he can stomp his feet holding onto Rhea's fingers for balance and pad into the dirt to pick up bits of grass and bugs, but he never wants anyone to be hurt by what he can't control again. If infatuation and mischief kill, then they won't exist in the world. And the domain of the Olympians progresses on without Harry noticing, the decadent, broken 1980s melting into the green '90s around him. Obsessive regimes lose their footholds. Decades-old hate softens its fervor. The Iron Curtain opens and the Wall comes crumbling down. But something is missing from the world, and even the mortals can feel it. In February 1994, when it's cold, Harry is a tiny baby curled into a sling over Rhea's middle, and she ducks into the small local bakery for warmth and coffee and a bright pink-and-yellow Battenburg cake. Inside, the bakery has Christmas carols playing in the corner, and it's warm and bright and smells like almond and apricot and yeasty, roasty bread. The choir on the cassette split into a soaring harmony as the sweet-creamy scent of the cake passes by Harry's nose as Rhea takes the cake. There's a soft pressure on the back of his head as someone presses a kiss to it. He stirs a little and blinks out at the bakery girl. The next morning, Harry is sixteen again with curly hair in his eyes and an absurd scarf around his neck, standing at the stove stirring a pot of porridge with a fork when Rhea comes down the stairs. \"You're not supposed to use a fork for that, sweetheart,\" she says, and kisses the back of his head. Harry makes a face. \"I was hungry. I used all the spoons already. You've only got four.\" \"Well, no one else was using them,\" his mother says pointedly. \"Are you ready to settle for a bit, then? Only it's difficult when you change so frequently.\" \"I know,\" Harry says softly, and licks some porridge from the fork. \"I'm going to work in the bakery.\" Rhea-called-Anne smiles and pats his cheek. \"Good. I do love you, Harry, but it will be nice to have some time to myself. You are a very demanding baby.\" \"I'm a very demanding teenager, too,\" Harry quips, and starts eating the porridge right out of its pot. And for the next sixteen years, Harry works at the little bakery in Holmes Chapel, selling swiss rolls and scones and chatting up nearly everyone from the parish. He takes up with a steady line of pretty girls and a covert assortment of prettier boys, and there's a resurgence in the popularity of \"comfort foods\" and \"slow-cooking\" in most of the Western world. There's also a resurgence in the power of obsessive love, infatuation and mischief and want, and with them come boy bands. Harry tries his best not to love any of them in particular, but they all excite him and he thinks, well, he'll just love them all equally, then, and no one will get hurt. Rhea-called-Anne catches him singing Take That's \"Rule the World\" as he sweeps up behind the counter one evening, and she's glad. And then, in February 2010, when it's cold, Harry is sixteen and beautiful and his green eyes shine up at his mother when she ducks into the bakery for warmth and coffee and a bright pink-and-yellow battenburg cake. Joe McElderry is playing from the radio in the corner, and Harry kisses his mother's cheek and then bites his lip before blurting out, \"Mum? I want to be on X-Factor.\"",

      "She doesn't laugh as she and Karen talk, but that silver affection oozes from Karen all the same and sinks into the thin woman.",
      "They have to wait for half an hour before it's time for Karen's appointment, and by the time Karen gives her a hug on her way out of the waiting room, the yellow is bright, sparkling gold again.",
      "They touch arms again as Karen makes her way to Aphrodite's desk to schedule another appointment and the thin woman heads in for her procedure.",
      "Hours later, when she comes back out and rings for a cab home, she's still sparkling gold, even though she looks tired around the eyes.",
      "Aphrodite decides then that Olympus without Zeus is a bit of a shitshow anyway - one more demigod won't hurt.",
      "She goes back to the little flat that she's keeping in Park Village, with wide-looped crochet curtains in her windows and a curious couple across the way whom she lets watch her change at night, because ludus love is nothing to be ashamed of, anyway.",
      "She puts on a kettle of tea and turns Corrie on the telly to play softly in the background, because Aphrodite likes the chutzpah of Tanya Pooley.",
      "She strips off in front of the window and crosses back to her kettle to pour the water into her mug before she slips into her dressing gown.",
      "She drinks her tea and watches the end of Coronation Street and touches herself for a while.",
      "And then she sets a dish of water on her night table, makes a scallop shell, and lets all of the storge - mauve-purple-blush and a little plush - pour into the shell's mirror.",
      "She's never made a baby out of this kind of love before, and she wonders just how it will turn out.",
      "She makes sure to make him a boy.",
      "A few weeks later, it's August in Wolverhampton.",
      "It's unusually cool and dry for the season, and Aphrodite feels the call in her bones like all of the Olympians that Zeus is home, and he is not happy, and for some reason, that stormy sadness is swirling above England.",
      "She bundles the baby, shell and all, into swaddling clothes and brings him to Bilston.",
      "She doesn't keep the same face and figure she'd worn at the clinic and instead becomes herself again, with flowing titian curls and eyes that shift color in the sun.",
      "Outside the Paynes' door, Aphrodite tilts her head to kiss him again before she settles him in his basket.",
      "He's such a curious baby, this placid, serious Liam-thing.",
      "She waits just out of sight, half-shaded by a box tree, until the door opens and Karen's face peers down at little Liam.",
      "Her hair is undone and falling to dust her shoulders and her dressing gown is on just askew.",
      "She bends, slowly, to pick up the little pink bundle of Liam Payne, and he's still silent, just blinking big brown eyes and one tiny hand coming out of the swaddling to pad into her eye.",
      "The entire street seems to glow in the rush of blue-gold-pink. 004.",
      "D Maura hates Mullingar.",
      "She hates the barracks and she hates Christ the King cathedral; she hates the Grenville Arms and she hates Oliver Plunkett Street and she hates Cassidy's and Finn's and Druid's Chair and Gilleran's and Kerrigan's and Hughes' Corner House and Danny Byrne's and Canton Casey's and Caffrey's and McCormick's and Wallace's and Daly's and Gallagher's and Cosgrove's and Con's and Murray's and Dolan's and Cheers and Kenny's and George Evan's and Butler's and beer.",
      "She's starting to hate Bobby.",
      "She doesn't hate Greg at all, the lamb, but sometimes - and she feels so badly about this that it's driven her to Keenan's - she might... hate being a mother.",
      "Or at least, she hates the way that being a mother in Mullingar in 1993 makes her feel; all Gaelic football and the drone of the Dublin-Sligo line and Greg won't keep quiet about that stupid UFO back in March and it just makes her teeth hurt, because football is no reason for Bobby not to come home and tell his son that aliens wouldn't even bother to land in Mullingar, Ireland, for christ's sake.",
      "But now the Shamrocks' season is over and Bobby is actually at home, and he commented over tea that the bolognese seemed a bit salty and it gave Maura a bit of a sting in her back teeth, like they were struggling to say out the words she couldn't because she's a mum in Mullingar and it's all well and good for Bobby to go out for months every night and have fun with the lads but what does she get?",
      "Fish Fridays and Ciara at the Scoil Mhuire parent group calling every five minutes with gossip Maura doesn't care about and doesn't need to have running through her head at the market and complaints about the salt in the bolognese.",
      "Well, the Shamrocks' season is over and he can stay home to field calls from Ciara about whose daughter is to be avoided because whose mother was out kissing whose husband so said Fiona last Saturday and fuck all, who cares?",
      "Not Maura, as she sits in Keegan's, turning a pint glass around and around in her hands and thinking, I hate the taste of beer.",
      "She wishes Aoife still lived in Mullingar.",
      "Beer never tasted quite so bad when she was sitting at the next barstool over.",
      "\"You don't like the Trouble Or?\" asks an amused voice from behind her.",
      "It's not slurring yet, but there's something strange about it.",
      "\"Aroma is mushroomy, floral, hint of butter... got some plum and papaya on the palate and oats in the finish... not bad.",
      "What's not to like?\" Maura turns to look up at the man; he's got curls and a round jowl and he's not quite handsome, but his face is harmless enough that she just shrugs.",
      "\"Don't like beer.\"",
      "He grins.",
      "\"Me, neither.",
      "I'm more of a wine guy.\"",
      "He sticks out his hand.",
      "\"I'm D.\" Maura tilts her head.",
      "He's American.",
      "Doesn't seem like the sort to go on a James Joyce walking tour, but books could get all sorts of tourists, she guesses.",
      "She shakes his hand.",
      "\"Maura.\"",
      "\"What a great old Irish name.\"",
      "He pulls out the barstool beside hers and gestured towards it.",
      "\"Can I?\" Maura shrugs and nods - he isn't quite handsome, but he's magnetic and he isn't hollering about the Shamrocks or picking a fight over snooker in the corner, so really, what does it hurt?",
      "Besides.",
      "She's married.",
      "D grins at Maura and rests his elbow on the bar and his chin against the meat of his palm.",
      "\"Tell me about yourself.\"",
      "\"I'm a mum,\" Maura says.",
      "\"My husband's a manager at Dunnes and I have a son at Scoil Mhuire.\"",
      "\"Well, now I know about your husband and your son,\" laughs D, \"But what about you?\"",
      "Well, that knocks Maura for six.",
      "\"Ehm,\" she fumbles, \"I've lived in Mullingar all me life.",
      "And...",
      "I don't like beer.\"",
      "\"That's all there is to you?\" Maura turns her glass in her hands again.",
      "\"Feels that way, yeah.",
      "I suppose.\"",
      "D considers her for a long time, and normally Maura would blush and look away - or tell him to fuck off, depending on the look in his eyes - but he just seems sad and kind of interested and his eyes are this strange color, a deep brown that's almost burgundy and it reminds her of California, which is stupid because she's only seen it on television, and of Tuscany, which is stupid because she's only seen it in books.",
      "The cookbook where she got her bolognese recipe for tonight had a big photo of a huge, rolling Tuscan vineyard on the front, all green and gold and deep purple-red.",
      "His eyes remind her of that.",
      "So she just fiddles with her glass and looks back.",
      "Then D stands and puts his hands in his pockets as he rocks back on his heels like a hobbyhorse.",
      "\"It's kinda loud in here.",
      "You want to go somewhere?\"",
      "He takes out hand back out of his pocket and holds it up, flat-palmed.",
      "\"No funny business.\"",
      "Maura looks around and sees nothing but Mullingar in every bleeding inch of the bar, so she stands up and says, \"Alright.\"",
      "D gets a bottle of wine from... somewhere... and after she's downed half the dark-cherry-and-red-bramble bottle, Maura has entirely too much fun saying its Spanish name the way D does, \"rrrrrrrr-ee-oh-ha.\"",
      "The end up by Lough Owel, and there's a second bottle of wine, something white and sparkling that tickles her tongue, and Maura says, \"I went to college for history, and I wanted to be an archaeologist?",
      "Travel to Greece and Rome and that and dig up old things, you know, see how people lived thousands of years ago.",
      "'Cause it's just - you know, there had to be more life then, or else why would people keep on to now?",
      "Is this really all there is to living?",
      "Fish on Friday and pub on Sunday and doing science projects all week because they're too hard for the kids and the carpet's always full of mud and the husband's never home, and then when he is home... what's it worth, really?",
      "So I think thousands of years ago, you know, I wanted to go and find that more.",
      "They had gods and monsters.",
      "And we got what, the Shamrocks and Joe Dolan.",
      "I figure that there had to be a thing that made them want to keep the Earth going and do all they did.",
      "I wanted to find it.\"",
      "A few months later, Maura is helping Greg to make yet another poster about that damned UFO and outer space, and she explains to Greg that she has a baby in her tummy and he's going to be a big brother.",
      "Greg asks if the baby came from the stars, and Maura says yes.",
      "Niall - his name means 'champion,' because Maura believes that names say a lot about a person and she wants him to win a place outside of Mullingar one day - is born wailing.",
      "He has a thick fluff of white hair and when he blinks open his eyes, just for a second, the blue is ringed at the pupil with a soft winey gold.",
      "Just a light, sparkling blush, like the sun glancing off the brick of a Tuscan vineyard or the gilded roll of a rioja.",
      "Maura was still a mum in Mullingar, and she still resented Bobby for never being home and complaining when he was, and there was always mud in the carpets and the parent group at Scoil Mhuire and years of science projects about outer space, but when Maura looks at Niall, she feels like there's a bit more freedom in her life than she thought, and she knows that there's more to who she is than meets the eye. 005",

      "O Harry is five years old the first time he sees them.",
      "He's been five for a long time - a thousand years, or thereabouts.",
      "He doesn't keep track.",
      "After all, he's only five.",
      "He likes being five; it's one of his favorite ages.",
      "He never gets into trouble when he's five, and he can curl up in Mum's lap to go to sleep whenever he likes.",
      "They're in France.",
      "They've been in France for two hundred years or so.",
      "It's safe there.",
      "No one would ever think to look for Harry in France.",
      "They spend most of their days in the Jardin du Luxembourg, and Harry tumbles about on the grass and splashes in the fountains and plays Crochet et Boiser with the little girls.",
      "He climbs trees and draws on the sides of statues and grins at everyone all the time, because he's small and cute and his eyes are the size of the moon.",
      "Old women pick him up and coo and give him berlingots de Nantes that turn his lips and tongue bright red.",
      "Roudoudou demain, s'il vous plait!",
      "he demands, pulling at their sleeves.",
      "They kiss him all over his face and bring him the roudoudou the next day, and he sits on the lion statue's back and licks the candy out of its seashells.",
      "His mother sits only feet away all the time when they're outside.",
      "She can't bear to let him out of her sight; part of that is just motherly love.",
      "And no one can love her children like Rhea.",
      "The mother of all of the gods, the mother of all things, child of only the earth and the sky.",
      "Her other children can never know about Harry.",
      "Not even his father.",
      "Especially not his father.",
      "Harry runs over with his mouth and chin sticky and green from the roudoudou, waving his wax seashell happily, and settles down in Rhea's lap.",
      "He curls her long hair around one fist and tucks his face against her collar and promptly goes to sleep.",
      "Around the park, all of the old women and all of the little girls stop and watch him for a moment and smile inwardly, their hands clutched to their bosoms or cupped to their chins.",
      "Son of Rhea, son of Eros.",
      "The missing Olympian, always hidden.",
      "Harry is the god of infatuation and mischief, and as much as no one can resist him, he can't resist the things he loves even more.",
      "So when he sees them for the first time, January 15, 1964, as he gallops - alongside his mother with a baguette perched on one small shoulder - past the Paris Olympia, Harry's whole world suddenly cuts and tethers on new to someone else.",
      "To something else; a new idea, a new need, a new style.",
      "A new rhythm.",
      "He is so suddenly smitten that within days, the rest of the world follows with him, spiraling into an obsession that would never quite be matched.",
      "Outside the Paris Olympia, John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Richard Starkey smoke their cigarettes and shake out their floppy hair and behind them, a track of \"She Loves You\" blares out onto the street.",
      "\"Maman!\"",
      "Harry crows, pointing at them, his green eyes huge and shining.",

      "Ecoutez!\"",

      "\"Venez.\"",
      "That night, after they've eaten supper and Rhea has kissed Harry's face and gone to sleep, Harry becomes sixteen.",
      "His bones stretch out just that little too much; he keeps hollows around his hipbones and clavicle, but gives himself a little muscle in his abdomen and chest.",
      "His hair is still curly, though, and his cheeks still dimpled, and his eyes still huge and shining and green.",
      "He takes the mirror from the wall over the bathroom sink and props it up in his bedroom so he can admire himself for a while, twisting at all angles.",
      "Merde.",
      "Somehow he's given himself four nipples.",
      "He frowns and pokes at one of the extra ones, but he can't seem to make them go away.",
      "No matter.",
      "He's sixteen again now - he'd forgotten how much he loved being sixteen; his father was Eros, after all, he fucking loves being sixteen - and there are more important things to attend to than a few extra nipples.",
      "He turns a bit to check out his rear and nods appreciatively, then stands with his hips out to check out what, now that he's back to sixteen, is clearly the most important part of him.",
      "He grins.",
      "He might have four nipples, but at least this turned out well.",
      "He lifts it curiously to feel the weight in his hand, then remembers, oh, I'm sixteen and touching my chauve a col roule, and lets the memory of Paul McCartney sucking on his cigarette fill his head until he's heavy and hard and gets off twice over the pillows.",
      "The sun just barely begins to rise over the rooftops and Harry looks out at it, watching Apollo's chariot roll up over the east, and opens the window to lean out.",
      "\"Au revoir, Paris!\"",
      "he shouts, and likes his new sixteen-year-old voice.",
      "He throws his arms out and laughs uproariously as two old Breton women in their lace hats look up at him from the street and shade their eyes against the sun to cluck disapprovingly at his nakedness.",
      "He takes a last cold lungful of Paris air and darts back into his bedroom.",
      "He makes himself a collarless suit, chic and posh and gray, and shakes out his curls before swiping them to the side to smile at himself in the mirror - ducking his head to peek out through his fringe the way he'd seen John do outside the Olympia - before skipping down the hall to his mother's room.",
      "Rhea is awake, sitting at the side of her bed with her long, black hair in a braid down her back.",
      "The look on her face glowed placid and fierce at once: the sort of look that bloomed mountains.",
      "Harry curls up beside her like he did when he was five.",
      "\"Tous n'etes pas cinq annees,\" Rhea says, not looking at her smallest son.",
      "\"Je veux aller en Angleterre,\" Harry answered.",
      "When he spoke again, it was in a deep, raspy voice, slow and with a curling Northern mumble.",
      "\"I think I'm English now, anyway.",
      "I really fancy a tea.\"",
      "Rhea laughed then, and turned to kiss Harry's brow.",
      "\"Alright, sweetheart,\" she said.",
      "\"We'll go to England.\"",
      "They end up in a tiny Cheshire village - two streetlights, a church, and a bakery; very picturesque - and Harry falls in with a group of mortal boys to make a terrible racket on guitars and drums.",
      "Rhea has to laugh watching them.",
      "Harry is as demanding at sixteen as he had been pleading for roudoudou in the park at five, except now he demanded quicker tempo and more drums and lyric changes.",
      "They called their band \"White Eskimo\" and the girls' school let them play at the spring mixer.",
      "Harry is delivered home, looking sweaty and not the least bit sheepish, by an incensed nun at half-seven, after she'd quite literally stumbled upon Harry and all three senior officers of the Young Ladies' Charitable Pep Club in full undress at the back of the coats closet.",
      "Rhea - called \"Anne\" now in England; she'd been \"Antoinette\" in France if people spoke to her at all - apologizes profusely for her son and promises fifty Hail Marys to Mother Magdalene.",
      "Once the nun has stormed off, Harry throws his head back and laughs belly-deep.",
      "\"Mum!\"",
      "he cries.",
      "\"There was a man at the dance who says he wants to bring White Eskimo to London!",
      "He said we could be 'the next Beatles'!\"",
      "Harry's green mooneyes shine.",
      "Rhea kisses his forehead.",
      "\"No.\"",
      "Harry's face falls like rain melting colored chalk from the sidewalk, and he catches his lip between his teeth.",
      "\"No?\" \"Harry,\" Rhea says softly, \"Your brothers will find you.\"",
      "\"So?\" Harry asks defiantly, puffing out his chest, \"Let them find me!",
      "I'm no threat to them.",
      "Everyone loves me, besides.\"",
      "Rhea cups a hand over his flushed cheek.",
      "\"That is what makes you so dangerous, sweetest heart.",
      "They will fall into such obsession with you that they would steal you away to Olympus and forget about the world.",
      "They have their own duties and purposes, Harry; they can't lose themselves in love to you.\"",
      "\"But being lost in love is good.",
      "Especially with me.\"",
      "Harry's face is a mask of innocence.",
      "Rhea strokes his cheek with her thumb.",
      "\"Infatuation isn't quite the same as love, sweetheart.",
      "It's the most dangerous love of all.",
      "It's the kind of love that makes good mortals and good gods do the worst things.\"",
      "So Harry stays in Church Hulme.",
      "The rest of White Eskimo go on to London without him, and without him, they change their name to The Who.",
      "Harry blessed them before they left him, and he watches quietly from his tiny parish in Cheshire as they forget all about their first lead singer and lead a whole demographic to sing about their g-g-g-generation.",
      "Harry sings in the street, and sings sometimes at The Old Red Lion, and sings flirty little ditties to girls on the path home from school while he trips charmingly on his boots and peeks out from beneath his curls.",
      "He watches everything he can of the Beatles.",
      "He keeps a badge of their faces pinned to his schoolbag.",
      "In 1974, Church Hulme changes its name to Holmes Chapel, and John Lennon plays three songs at Madison Square Garden with Elton John.",
      "On December 8, 1980, Harry finally understands what his mother meant about infatuation being dangerous.",
      "A world away, in the shadow of Olympus, John Lennon is dead.",
      "And Harry knows, like all gods know their own divine work, that it is his fault.",
      "That night, Rhea hears him crying in his room and rushes in to find that Harry is a baby, wailing and inconsolable and wanting nothing to do with the world or love outside of the tiny domain of his mother and warm milk and napping on a blanket in the soft patches of warmth the sun paints on their living room floor.",
      "Loving anything else seems - it scares him, and he cries and cries and cries until he's too exhausted to move and falls asleep, sniffling, on Rhea's shoulder.",
      "He stays a baby for the next fourteen years.",
      "On some days, he's a toddler, and they go to the park so he can stomp his feet holding onto Rhea's fingers for balance and pad into the dirt to pick up bits of grass and bugs, but he never wants anyone to be hurt by what he can't control again.",
      "If infatuation and mischief kill, then they won't exist in the world.",
      "And the domain of the Olympians progresses on without Harry noticing, the decadent, broken 1980s melting into the green '90s around him.",
      "Obsessive regimes lose their footholds.",
      "Decades-old hate softens its fervor.",
      "The Iron Curtain opens and the Wall comes crumbling down.",
      "But something is missing from the world, and even the mortals can feel it.",
      "In February 1994, when it's cold, Harry is a tiny baby curled into a sling over Rhea's middle, and she ducks into the small local bakery for warmth and coffee and a bright pink-and-yellow Battenburg cake.",
      "Inside, the bakery has Christmas carols playing in the corner, and it's warm and bright and smells like almond and apricot and yeasty, roasty bread.",
      "The choir on the cassette split into a soaring harmony as the sweet-creamy scent of the cake passes by Harry's nose as Rhea takes the cake.",
      "There's a soft pressure on the back of his head as someone presses a kiss to it.",
      "He stirs a little and blinks out at the bakery girl.",
      "The next morning, Harry is sixteen again with curly hair in his eyes and an absurd scarf around his neck, standing at the stove stirring a pot of porridge with a fork when Rhea comes down the stairs.",
      "\"You're not supposed to use a fork for that, sweetheart,\" she says, and kisses the back of his head.",
      "Harry makes a face.",
      "\"I was hungry.",
      "I used all the spoons already.",
      "You've only got four.\"",
      "\"Well, no one else was using them,\" his mother says pointedly.",
      "\"Are you ready to settle for a bit, then?",
      "Only it's difficult when you change so frequently.\"",
      "\"I know,\" Harry says softly, and licks some porridge from the fork.",
      "\"I'm going to work in the bakery.\"",
      "Rhea-called-Anne smiles and pats his cheek.",
      "\"Good.",
      "I do love you, Harry, but it will be nice to have some time to myself.",
      "You are a very demanding baby.\"",
      "\"I'm a very demanding teenager, too,\" Harry quips, and starts eating the porridge right out of its pot.",
      "And for the next sixteen years, Harry works at the little bakery in Holmes Chapel, selling swiss rolls and scones and chatting up nearly everyone from the parish.",
      "He takes up with a steady line of pretty girls and a covert assortment of prettier boys, and there's a resurgence in the popularity of \"comfort foods\" and \"slow-cooking\" in most of the Western world.",
      "There's also a resurgence in the power of obsessive love, infatuation and mischief and want, and with them come boy bands.",
      "Harry tries his best not to love any of them in particular, but they all excite him and he thinks, well, he'll just love them all equally, then, and no one will get hurt.",
      "Rhea-called-Anne catches him singing Take That's \"Rule the World\" as he sweeps up behind the counter one evening, and she's glad.",
      "And then, in February 2010, when it's cold, Harry is sixteen and beautiful and his green eyes shine up at his mother when she ducks into the bakery for warmth and coffee and a bright pink-and-yellow battenburg cake.",
      "Joe McElderry is playing from the radio in the corner, and Harry kisses his mother's cheek and then bites his lip before blurting out, \"Mum?",
      "I want to be on X-Factor.\""

    "text": "Demeter measures time in Winters and families, the families always grow quicker than the Winters pass. Over the course of the first hundred Winters, she walked from Hellas to Gaul, where she found a home for the Summers that made her feel safe. She knew it could never be far enough away but she needed the smell of sea in the air and a hot sun that was familiar. Over the many Summers, they built a house and garden together that stretched for acres, where they both felt like it was home. Then in the Winters, the house would grow quiet as it felt too empty for her and she needed life around her. Her walks took her as far north as the cold edges of the North Sea and south to the hot sands of the Sahara. She could never keep track of all the borders and new names but judged by the people and how they did. If they prospered then she'd smile to see them well as human leaders are prone to corruption and sharing pain, but if they did badly, she'd do what she could. Stories followed her as she left behind healing families and fields though the names attached to her changed. When she began to walk, those who welcomed her knew the signs of her coming, the scents of Summer in the dark of Winter and a hint of wheat gold hair amongst her grey. The wise ones wouldn't speak but instead leave thanks at her temple and the foolish ones would try to thank her and she'd leave. She learned how to find the kind ones who would welcome her in, usually a cat or dog would come out to greet her and the land would speak of hard workers who loved. As the Winters blurred together, her temples grew quiet yet the tales of the old woman who brought health and ripeness in her wake were not forgotten. In some families, they would speak of how first grandmother then later someone else was once healed or blessed with a child by the old woman who wore black and carried Summer. When crosses became more familiar, she would always smile to find hidden away a small statue of her or a sheaf of golden wheat hanging upon the cross to show they haven't truly forgotten. For she was never forgotten by the families she had touched so that when the Winters grew long and the darkness felt like it would push her into the ground, she would be welcomed into warm homes and feel like perhaps Spring was not that far away.",

    "text": "\"...that I might take due vengeance and make a second Aulis for atonement here...\" - Euripides' Iphigenia at Tauris Iphigenia waited at the altar, chin lifted, neck bare. A soldier held each of her arms, pulling her body taut, open, but she could still feel herself trembling. She could not bring herself to look into her father's eyes, though some desperate part of her imagined that, if she did, the knife would clatter down upon the stone and he would take her in his arms and promise her that it was all right. But no - those were childhood fantasies, and now, in this supreme moment of responsibility, she found herself suddenly an adult. No one around her spoke. The knife touched her throat and Iphigenia closed her eyes. But there was no pain. Only a rich, potent dizziness, and she found she could not feel her legs. \"Look at me, Iphigenia.\" The injunction echoed in her mind like prophecy. Iphigenia looked. The woman who spoke looked barely older than Iphigenia herself, but she was tall and strong and had skin that shone like gold. The statues did not capture her beauty, but it was impossible not to recognize her. \"My lady,\" Iphigenia tried to say, but she could not hear the words outside of her head. Perhaps this was how death felt, and the goddess spared her the pain only in a final mercy, recognition of her willing sacrifice. But then where was winged Hermes, extending his hand to lead her to the Underworld? All she was aware of was Artemis before her, her presence so vivid and bright that it was greater than all the sea and sand the sky that the world contained. There were shadows upon the goddess' sharp cheekbones like the dappling of leaves. She was, Iphigenia thought, the most beautiful thing she had ever seen. The goddess laughed, and the sound was vast and blood-speckled, a huntress' laugh. \"You are not dead,\" she told Iphigenia, \"I am not in the habit of killing pious young virgins. There are few enough of you as it is.\" It was all a trick, a test of her own and her father's piety. It was cruel, to be sure, malicious, as the gods so often are, but now it had served its purpose and she could go home - The goddess reached out a hand and stroked Iphigenia's hair. The touch was almost maternal, almost sisterly, but somehow not quite either. It at once comforted Iphigenia and frightened her. \"No, my child,\" she said, \"you may not go home. I have spared your life, but now it is owed to me. You shall spend it in my service, in the fashion that I dictate.\" All at once, anger rose in her, anger which she did not feel during all the barbed negotiations surrounding her death. She had felt so calm then, clarity pure in her like the hard edge of a knife, cutting through her mother's sobs and screams, her uncle's heated accusations of disloyalty. She remembered how cool her skin felt as she stepped forward, knelt at her father's feet and said, \"I will.\" That calm was gone now, now that the choice was made and her life spared and the goddess who demanded the sacrifice in the first place stood before her, gentle and commanding, her face as clear and untroubled by guilt as Iphigenia's own. \"Why?\" Iphigenia asked, hearing hubris shrill in her young voice, \"I have done nothing against you, or any of the gods. Why me?\" In a single instant, the gentleness vanished, and the goddess seemed fearsome in her beauty, terrible. \"Do you question me in my mercy? Daughter of Agamemnon, the gifts of the gods are not to be taken lightly.\" Iphigenia tasted danger like blood upon her tongue, coppery. \"I am sorry, my lady,\" she begged, placating, and though she could not hear her voice, she knew the goddess could, \"I did not expect to live through this day, and I am grateful, truly I am, but only - I will give you whatever honors you wish, I will consecrate myself to you and never marry, but I wish to see my family again - my mother, my sisters, my brother -\" the word father hovered on her lips, but she did not speak it, \"they will be worried about me, they will wonder what has happened.\" Artemis smiled. \"Let them wonder. There is a curse upon your family, Iphigenia, and your sacrifice has been only one piece of it. Consider it this way: by taking you as my own I have removed you from the curse that lies upon the house of Atreus. You need never witness what horrors will there come to pass.\" Iphigenia thought that seeing her father waiting for her at the altar with the sacrificial knife was horror enough, but she did not say so. \"Where will you take me?\" she asked. She could hear her voice now, but it sounded small and faint. She still could not see anything but the goddess, could not tell where she was. \"Far, far from Greece,\" Artemis told her, \"to a temple dearly loved by me. Your duties there, I expect, will shock you deeply, but they will be sacred, and performed in my honor. You shall be the highest among the priestesses, and revered by all. I shall always be with you.\" Iphigenia tasted copper upon her tongue, so strong it almost made her sick. \"What duties?\" she asked, trying to smooth out the panicked edges of her words as she spoke, \"Goddess, I pray you, please let me know what my fate shall be.\" The smallest hint of a smile curved Artemis' lips. \"Do you really wish that I tell you? I thought to give you some time, first, to let you rest, convalesce from this ordeal before laying the weight of your new life upon you. But, if you insist -\" \"I want to know,\" Iphigenia said, firm, solid. \"You were angry, a moment ago,\" Artemis said, almost lightly, almost offhandedly, \"it was misdirected anger, aimed at me, your patron and rescuer, but no matter. Find that anger again, Iphigenia. Find it, deep within yourself.\" With her brown, narrow fingers, the goddess touched Iphigenia lightly upon the sternum. Obediently, she focused inward and found a core of fury inside her, warm as an ember beneath Artemis' fingers. It seemed to gather in her throat like knotted string, tangling up her thoughts. She looked at Artemis and imagined scratching at those forest-shadowed cheeks with her fingernails. The goddess was hardly taller than she. Again, Artemis smiled. \"Good girl. Now, with whom does the guilt for your anger truly rest? Not with me - I am your goddess, inexorable and unfathomable. Who, in their bloodthirst, cried out for your death? Who argued, with smooth, sly rhetoric, the worthlessness of your life? Who held the knife which was to murder you?\" Tears were warm against Iphigenia's cheeks. She could not speak, could not tell where her anger ended and her sorrow began. The force of her feeling threatened to engulf the world. \"Yes,\" Artemis told her, \"hold that, keep it deep inside you. I am going to give you revenge, Iphigenia. Revenge on every boorish Greek who thinks the worth of a girl's life can be weighed against the benefits of a war and found wanting. Your revenge will be as strong and as pitiless as the teeth of a wolf. Your hands will reek with more blood than your father could ever have spilt at my altar.\" Iphigenia did not know what she felt in the intertwining web of heat within her sternum, knew only the goddess hadn't answered her question, had kept from her some vital detail which would turn these strange, prophetic words crystal and sharp. \"Please -\" she began to ask, but Artemis touched her lips. \"No more,\" she commanded, \"not now,\" and as the words faded into the air, Iphigenia felt the dizziness overcome her again and she lost consciousness. When she awoke, she was lying in a bed, and the walls around her were made of soft yellow stone. She tried to move, but her limbs were heavy and did not obey her. There were voices above her bed, but they spoke a language she could not recognize or understand. After some time, a woman who smelled of sandalwood knelt at Iphigenia's side with a bowl of thin broth, and fed her, slowly and gently. The woman did not attempt to speak to Iphigenia, and so Iphigenia did not attempt to speak to her. She was not sure if sound would have come from her throat if she had tried. For many days, she was too weak to leave the bed. She was cared for, by the first woman and two others, who did the work tenderly, eyes lowered as if they did not want to embarrass her. Iphigenia assumed that they could not speak Greek until she heard them talking amongst themselves one day - \"She cannot be older than thirteen,\" one of them said, in a hushed voice. \"Too young,\" agreed another, \"for this dreadful work.\" \"Where am I?\" she tried to ask, but, as she had feared, she could make no sound. She found, during the days that she was bedridden, that she could not stop crying. She did not even know what she was crying about, only that the tears poured from her and seemed to go on forever. The women who tended her did not comment on her tears, but in the tenderness of their touch Iphigenia thought she could feel sympathy. When she was strong enough, they helped her out her out of bed and into a long, heavy tunic. It felt different upon her body than any she had worn before, but perhaps, she thought, it was only because she was being dressed no longer as a girl, but as a woman. The women who tended her brought her out of the room and showed her the temple in which she now would live. They spoke slowly, as if to a child. When they led her to the inner shrine in which the image of Artemis stood, beautiful and enigmatic, Iphigenia fell to her knees in prayer. It appeared like piety, and perhaps it was, but more than that she took the chance to focus her mind, to say to the goddess who had determined her fate, Let me know your will, let me know what you desire. I am lost here, a stranger. At least stay with me, guide me as you have promised. When she finally stood, she found she could speak again. \"My name is Iphigenia,\" she told the women, \"I am the daughter of King Agamemnon and Queen Clytemnestra, princess of Mycenae. I serve the goddess Artemis. Tell me, if you would, where this temple lies and what my duties shall be within it.\" Her voice sounded strong and resonant, unfamiliar to her own ears. Good, she heard Artemis say within her mind, you have come back to yourself. You will find yourself changed, my dear girl, but for the better. Attend to your duties - as I warned you, they shall be difficult, but, in time you will learn that here, as my priestess, you hold power of which you never could have dreamed in as a princess in Agamemnon's palace. It was not that Iphigenia did not see the stains upon the altar, red-brown upon the marble, incriminating, nor that she could not smell the tang of metal in the air, ever-lingering, but only that, in that moment, the goddess' voice sure and beautiful within her, there was nothing in that shrine but power, and majesty, and worship, and she could believe that Artemis spoke truth, forget everything but the new fate which hung about her like the unaccustomed weight of her chiton. In these unfamiliar walls, farther distant from Mycenae than she ever expected to travel, Iphigenia could find herself, and no one would ever demand her life from her again.",
    "sentences": [
      "\"...that I might take due vengeance and make a second Aulis for atonement here...\" - Euripides' Iphigenia at Tauris Iphigenia waited at the altar, chin lifted, neck bare.",
      "A soldier held each of her arms, pulling her body taut, open, but she could still feel herself trembling.",
      "She could not bring herself to look into her father's eyes, though some desperate part of her imagined that, if she did, the knife would clatter down upon the stone and he would take her in his arms and promise her that it was all right.",
      "But no - those were childhood fantasies, and now, in this supreme moment of responsibility, she found herself suddenly an adult.",
      "No one around her spoke.",
      "The knife touched her throat and Iphigenia closed her eyes.",
      "But there was no pain.",
      "Only a rich, potent dizziness, and she found she could not feel her legs.",
      "\"Look at me, Iphigenia.\"",
      "The injunction echoed in her mind like prophecy.",
      "Iphigenia looked.",
      "The woman who spoke looked barely older than Iphigenia herself, but she was tall and strong and had skin that shone like gold.",
      "The statues did not capture her beauty, but it was impossible not to recognize her.",
      "\"My lady,\" Iphigenia tried to say, but she could not hear the words outside of her head.",
      "Perhaps this was how death felt, and the goddess spared her the pain only in a final mercy, recognition of her willing sacrifice.",
      "But then where was winged Hermes, extending his hand to lead her to the Underworld?",
      "All she was aware of was Artemis before her, her presence so vivid and bright that it was greater than all the sea and sand the sky that the world contained.",
      "There were shadows upon the goddess' sharp cheekbones like the dappling of leaves.",
      "She was, Iphigenia thought, the most beautiful thing she had ever seen.",
      "The goddess laughed, and the sound was vast and blood-speckled, a huntress' laugh.",
      "\"You are not dead,\" she told Iphigenia, \"I am not in the habit of killing pious young virgins.",
      "There are few enough of you as it is.\"",
      "It was all a trick, a test of her own and her father's piety.",
      "It was cruel, to be sure, malicious, as the gods so often are, but now it had served its purpose and she could go home - The goddess reached out a hand and stroked Iphigenia's hair.",
      "The touch was almost maternal, almost sisterly, but somehow not quite either.",
      "It at once comforted Iphigenia and frightened her.",
      "\"No, my child,\" she said, \"you may not go home.",
      "I have spared your life, but now it is owed to me.",
      "You shall spend it in my service, in the fashion that I dictate.\"",
      "All at once, anger rose in her, anger which she did not feel during all the barbed negotiations surrounding her death.",
      "She had felt so calm then, clarity pure in her like the hard edge of a knife, cutting through her mother's sobs and screams, her uncle's heated accusations of disloyalty.",
      "She remembered how cool her skin felt as she stepped forward, knelt at her father's feet and said, \"I will.\"",
      "That calm was gone now, now that the choice was made and her life spared and the goddess who demanded the sacrifice in the first place stood before her, gentle and commanding, her face as clear and untroubled by guilt as Iphigenia's own.",
      "\"Why?\" Iphigenia asked, hearing hubris shrill in her young voice, \"I have done nothing against you, or any of the gods.",
      "Why me?\"",
      "In a single instant, the gentleness vanished, and the goddess seemed fearsome in her beauty, terrible.",
      "\"Do you question me in my mercy?",
      "Daughter of Agamemnon, the gifts of the gods are not to be taken lightly.\"",
      "Iphigenia tasted danger like blood upon her tongue, coppery.",
      "\"I am sorry, my lady,\" she begged, placating, and though she could not hear her voice, she knew the goddess could, \"I did not expect to live through this day, and I am grateful, truly I am, but only - I will give you whatever honors you wish, I will consecrate myself to you and never marry, but I wish to see my family again - my mother, my sisters, my brother -\" the word father hovered on her lips, but she did not speak it, \"they will be worried about me, they will wonder what has happened.\"",
      "Artemis smiled.",
      "\"Let them wonder.",
      "There is a curse upon your family, Iphigenia, and your sacrifice has been only one piece of it.",
      "Consider it this way: by taking you as my own I have removed you from the curse that lies upon the house of Atreus.",
      "You need never witness what horrors will there come to pass.\"",
      "Iphigenia thought that seeing her father waiting for her at the altar with the sacrificial knife was horror enough, but she did not say so.",
      "\"Where will you take me?\" she asked.",
      "She could hear her voice now, but it sounded small and faint.",
      "She still could not see anything but the goddess, could not tell where she was.",
      "\"Far, far from Greece,\" Artemis told her, \"to a temple dearly loved by me.",
      "Your duties there, I expect, will shock you deeply, but they will be sacred, and performed in my honor.",
      "You shall be the highest among the priestesses, and revered by all.",
      "I shall always be with you.\"",
      "Iphigenia tasted copper upon her tongue, so strong it almost made her sick.",
      "\"What duties?\" she asked, trying to smooth out the panicked edges of her words as she spoke, \"Goddess, I pray you, please let me know what my fate shall be.\"",
      "The smallest hint of a smile curved Artemis' lips.",
      "\"Do you really wish that I tell you?",
      "I thought to give you some time, first, to let you rest, convalesce from this ordeal before laying the weight of your new life upon you.",
      "But, if you insist -\" \"I want to know,\" Iphigenia said, firm, solid.",
      "\"You were angry, a moment ago,\" Artemis said, almost lightly, almost offhandedly, \"it was misdirected anger, aimed at me, your patron and rescuer, but no matter.",
      "Find that anger again, Iphigenia.",
      "Find it, deep within yourself.\"",
      "With her brown, narrow fingers, the goddess touched Iphigenia lightly upon the sternum.",
      "Obediently, she focused inward and found a core of fury inside her, warm as an ember beneath Artemis' fingers.",
      "It seemed to gather in her throat like knotted string, tangling up her thoughts.",
      "She looked at Artemis and imagined scratching at those forest-shadowed cheeks with her fingernails.",
      "The goddess was hardly taller than she.",
      "Again, Artemis smiled.",
      "\"Good girl.",
      "Now, with whom does the guilt for your anger truly rest?",
      "Not with me - I am your goddess, inexorable and unfathomable.",
      "Who, in their bloodthirst, cried out for your death?",
      "Who argued, with smooth, sly rhetoric, the worthlessness of your life?",
      "Who held the knife which was to murder you?\" Tears were warm against Iphigenia's cheeks.",
      "She could not speak, could not tell where her anger ended and her sorrow began.",
      "The force of her feeling threatened to engulf the world.",
      "\"Yes,\" Artemis told her, \"hold that, keep it deep inside you.",
      "I am going to give you revenge, Iphigenia.",
      "Revenge on every boorish Greek who thinks the worth of a girl's life can be weighed against the benefits of a war and found wanting.",
      "Your revenge will be as strong and as pitiless as the teeth of a wolf.",
      "Your hands will reek with more blood than your father could ever have spilt at my altar.\"",
      "Iphigenia did not know what she felt in the intertwining web of heat within her sternum, knew only the goddess hadn't answered her question, had kept from her some vital detail which would turn these strange, prophetic words crystal and sharp.",
      "\"Please -\" she began to ask, but Artemis touched her lips.",
      "\"No more,\" she commanded, \"not now,\" and as the words faded into the air, Iphigenia felt the dizziness overcome her again and she lost consciousness.",
      "When she awoke, she was lying in a bed, and the walls around her were made of soft yellow stone.",
      "She tried to move, but her limbs were heavy and did not obey her.",
      "There were voices above her bed, but they spoke a language she could not recognize or understand.",
      "After some time, a woman who smelled of sandalwood knelt at Iphigenia's side with a bowl of thin broth, and fed her, slowly and gently.",
      "The woman did not attempt to speak to Iphigenia, and so Iphigenia did not attempt to speak to her.",
      "She was not sure if sound would have come from her throat if she had tried.",
      "For many days, she was too weak to leave the bed.",
      "She was cared for, by the first woman and two others, who did the work tenderly, eyes lowered as if they did not want to embarrass her.",
      "Iphigenia assumed that they could not speak Greek until she heard them talking amongst themselves one day - \"She cannot be older than thirteen,\" one of them said, in a hushed voice.",
      "\"Too young,\" agreed another, \"for this dreadful work.\"",
      "\"Where am I?\" she tried to ask, but, as she had feared, she could make no sound.",
      "She found, during the days that she was bedridden, that she could not stop crying.",
      "She did not even know what she was crying about, only that the tears poured from her and seemed to go on forever.",
      "The women who tended her did not comment on her tears, but in the tenderness of their touch Iphigenia thought she could feel sympathy.",
      "When she was strong enough, they helped her out her out of bed and into a long, heavy tunic.",
      "It felt different upon her body than any she had worn before, but perhaps, she thought, it was only because she was being dressed no longer as a girl, but as a woman.",
      "The women who tended her brought her out of the room and showed her the temple in which she now would live.",
      "They spoke slowly, as if to a child.",
      "When they led her to the inner shrine in which the image of Artemis stood, beautiful and enigmatic, Iphigenia fell to her knees in prayer.",
      "It appeared like piety, and perhaps it was, but more than that she took the chance to focus her mind, to say to the goddess who had determined her fate, Let me know your will, let me know what you desire.",
      "I am lost here, a stranger.",
      "At least stay with me, guide me as you have promised.",
      "When she finally stood, she found she could speak again.",
      "\"My name is Iphigenia,\" she told the women, \"I am the daughter of King Agamemnon and Queen Clytemnestra, princess of Mycenae.",
      "I serve the goddess Artemis.",
      "Tell me, if you would, where this temple lies and what my duties shall be within it.\"",
      "Her voice sounded strong and resonant, unfamiliar to her own ears.",
      "Good, she heard Artemis say within her mind, you have come back to yourself.",
      "You will find yourself changed, my dear girl, but for the better.",
      "Attend to your duties - as I warned you, they shall be difficult, but, in time you will learn that here, as my priestess, you hold power of which you never could have dreamed in as a princess in Agamemnon's palace.",

    "text": "Her Artist (for he is her artist as much as she is his Muse) is a man of letters and words, a mad man. In a different time perhaps, he could have been born in skirts and met his end in a Victorian mad house because he was the sort of man who believed in everything and nothing and by the virtue of such beliefs, made his life his most primary work of Art (aside from her but then everything the Artist did was aside from her.) He believed in God but that is because he was God, nothing less and nothing more. - The Artist met the Muse in a crowded place where people picked out what they liked and paid for it in gold but revisionist history will tell you that this is not the way it was, the Muse was not the Muse then so she barely existed at all, rising like Venus from the seas and not standing on things like streets, wearing things like clothes, eating things like food. The Muse was formless before she met the Artist - except she never met the Artist - o, let us start again - The Muse didn't exist before she met the Artist. The Artist made the Muse out of the bones and flesh of a girl who was no one and a dress that filled with light when he gave it to her. Bones and flesh and a dress. This is how he made the Muse. - The Artist lay with Muse in his bed, in the large house with glass windows where he kept her, hidden from the world so that no one else could see her and no one else could have her. This was not jealousy, the Artist would tell you, one can only be jealous of a thing that you do not fully possess and the Muse belonged to him so wholly that the idea of jealousy does not factor in. He was protecting her, her body and her light, so pure that the mere gaze of a mortal man (a man who was not him) could taint it and corrupt the whole. He lay with Her in the way that a man lies with a woman or a husband with his wife or (more commonly) with his mistress but of course the Muse was neither and therefore, it did not matter that they were not married. Her body was part of his, her body was a canvas, an art that he had created so there was no question of sin. (The Artist believed in God because he was God.) - The Muse lived in the Artist's house, though perhaps that is a wrong way to phrase this - let us start again - The Muse existed in the Artist's house and she lived in his paintings and his poetry, lived in his brush stroke and his oil, lived in his ink and his words and her body was only a pale wild thing, the real Muse was in the paintings and the poetry. In his art, the Muse became immortal and as her true self, the self that existed in those things that were allowed to leave the house, those things that went to publishing house to printed into books, pawed by a thousand grubby hands or hung in museums and galleries where anyone's eyes could devour her - as her self in his work grew stronger, the physical body, that weak useless lower self of hers began to wane. Such a fragile, breakable thing, so useless when her Artist, her God had given her already the greatest gift of immortality. The Muse and her body stood alone in their rooms and outside this confinement, she lived immortal, burning bright in her dresses with a the fire of many suns and her Artist smiled and he was proud as Gods tend to be when their creations are beautiful. He created many things, the Artist, many lovely muses but she was his crowning glory. Every time he came back from his travels he would tell her this, sit by the bedside where her body lay and tell her he loved her for this. One day, he came home and drew back the curtains. \"I would love to see my Muse in the light,\" he thought aloud. He hoped to see the sun grow wide and hot on pale limbs. He hoped to lie with her body in this bed where he kept her. But the Muse had not seen the sun for many a day and in its bright fiery light, her poor weak bones collapsed. She melted away like the last drops of candle wax with no wick to keep them steady.",

      "The Muse was formless before she met the Artist - except she never met the Artist - o, let us start again - The Muse didn't exist before she met the Artist.",
      "The Artist made the Muse out of the bones and flesh of a girl who was no one and a dress that filled with light when he gave it to her.",
      "Bones and flesh and a dress.",
      "This is how he made the Muse. - The Artist lay with Muse in his bed, in the large house with glass windows where he kept her, hidden from the world so that no one else could see her and no one else could have her.",
      "This was not jealousy, the Artist would tell you, one can only be jealous of a thing that you do not fully possess and the Muse belonged to him so wholly that the idea of jealousy does not factor in.",
      "He was protecting her, her body and her light, so pure that the mere gaze of a mortal man (a man who was not him) could taint it and corrupt the whole.",
      "He lay with Her in the way that a man lies with a woman or a husband with his wife or (more commonly) with his mistress but of course the Muse was neither and therefore, it did not matter that they were not married.",
      "Her body was part of his, her body was a canvas, an art that he had created so there was no question of sin.",
      "(The Artist believed in God because he was God.)",
      "- The Muse lived in the Artist's house, though perhaps that is a wrong way to phrase this - let us start again - The Muse existed in the Artist's house and she lived in his paintings and his poetry, lived in his brush stroke and his oil, lived in his ink and his words and her body was only a pale wild thing, the real Muse was in the paintings and the poetry.",
      "In his art, the Muse became immortal and as her true self, the self that existed in those things that were allowed to leave the house, those things that went to publishing house to printed into books, pawed by a thousand grubby hands or hung in museums and galleries where anyone's eyes could devour her - as her self in his work grew stronger, the physical body, that weak useless lower self of hers began to wane.",
      "Such a fragile, breakable thing, so useless when her Artist, her God had given her already the greatest gift of immortality.",
      "The Muse and her body stood alone in their rooms and outside this confinement, she lived immortal, burning bright in her dresses with a the fire of many suns and her Artist smiled and he was proud as Gods tend to be when their creations are beautiful.",
      "He created many things, the Artist, many lovely muses but she was his crowning glory.",
      "Every time he came back from his travels he would tell her this, sit by the bedside where her body lay and tell her he loved her for this.",
      "One day, he came home and drew back the curtains.",
      "\"I would love to see my Muse in the light,\" he thought aloud.",
      "He hoped to see the sun grow wide and hot on pale limbs.",
      "He hoped to lie with her body in this bed where he kept her.",
      "But the Muse had not seen the sun for many a day and in its bright fiery light, her poor weak bones collapsed.",
      "She melted away like the last drops of candle wax with no wick to keep them steady."

    "text": "She lived for spring, and spring lived for her -- or rather through her. Six lonely months out of the year, she waited, suffering, but as the appointed day drew close, her spirits lifted; the air warmed, the ground softened, until the moment mother and daughter reunited, and the land burst into flower and fertility. So it was, through the long centuries, as men forgot their proper worship and reduced them to art, memory, mere literary allusion. Until one year the daughter did not come. Her mother waited, not understanding, and the land waited with her. Still the maiden of spring stayed below. When her arrival was a month overdue, her mother went in search of her again. No long wandering this time; she knew exactly where to look. Demeter arrived at the gates of Hades, glared Cerberus into his kennel, and stormed through the underworld to her daughter's throne. Persephone had always followed mortal fashion with more fervor than Demeter thought necessary. Now she sat in the darkened hall with her already-pale face whitened further, her eyes shadowed with powder, her slender limbs draped in artfully tattered black lace. No, not sat -- drooped. She had never been happy in Hades, but this posture was something new; it looked posed. \"Do you know what day it is?\" Demeter snapped. Persephone waived one hand languidly, as if almost defeated by the weight of the skull and spider rings now clustering on her fingers. \"Who cares.\" \"You're a month late.\" Demeter stared at her. \"You've always bolted for the surface the minute your time was up. I don't understand. Why are you still down here?\" \"I like it here,\" Persephone said, with a mournful, artificial sigh. Demeter forgot her divine dignity; her jaw dropped. \"What?\" \"I think it suits me,\" Persephone added. \"You,\" Demeter said through her teeth, \"are the goddess of spring. What suits you is to spend six months here, and six months above. What has gotten into you? Why this silly clothing, all the makeup, and the nonsense about liking it here IN HADES?!\" \"The sun's too bright up there,\" Persephone said distastefully. \"It turns my skin pink and brown. And people are too cheerful. They don't understand the darkness of life.\" Demeter groped for something, anything, that could explain this bizarre change in her daughter. \"Has Hades been at you?\" \"No.\" \"Eris, then.\" \"No, mother.\" \"The Furies? Hecate? The Moirae?\" \"The Goths,\" Persephone said, with another mournful, yet somehow satisfied, sigh. The goddess of grain dredged the name out of her memory. \"Didn't they die out centuries ago? Can't remember what gods ended up taking them. Certainly not us. What are you doing visiting other underworlds? Or did they come here? Pillaging as usual, I suppose --\" \"Not the Visigoths,\" Persephone interrupted her, annoyance cracking her languid facade. \"Modern people.\" Demeter stared again. \"Who?\" \"Geniuses,\" Persephone said dreamily. \"I've been watching them. They know that true beauty lies in darkness. All this time I've been so wrong, wanting to escape here, when this is the only place that really matters. This is the real truth of the world -- darkness and sadness and --\" Demeter had heard enough. \"Nonsense. Your business is life and growth and flowers. Go wash off that silly makeup. I brought you your favorite chiton to wear --\" Persephone's chin came up. \"I'm not going.\" \"Oh, yes, you most certainly are.\" \"You can't make me.\" \"I'm a much older goddess then you are, young lady. Now get up this instant.\" \"But mother --\" Demeter almost threatened to plunge the world into famine again; then she realized Persephone would probably like that idea. So instead she resorted to a higher authority. \"Zeus said you would spend half the year here and half above. Do you want him angry at you?\" \"What can he do to me?\" Persephone said defiantly, but there was a hint of fear in it. Demeter smiled pleasantly. \"Oh, I imagine he might talk Hades into redecorating. Something in pastels, perhaps. With sunflowers everywhere. And choruses of butterflies dancing all the time.\" For a moment the two goddesses faced off. Then Persephone wailed, \"I hate you!\" and fled the room. Demeter sighed. Please, she thought -- though who the thought was directed at, she could not have said -- let this be just a phase. I'm not going through this every year for the next century.",

    "text": "It has been a long time since your mind has wandered to those deep recesses where you stashed the events that led you here. They have been haphazardly thrown one over the other, like the junk for which you have no real use, but are unable to throw away. They are there, those memories, and when you gaze into that messy collection, your heart skips a beat, your chest constricts, your eyes come dangerously close to overflowing with tears. Shame! You are a god, you do not cry... Breathe, you remind yourself... it is over. That time is long gone, but just for good measure you glance to your side, drink in his presence, and voila, the bad memories are routed once again. Your heart gladdens, your chest fills with happiness, your loins stir... he is there and he is yours, as it was meant to be. Yes, those times were hard and you would rather never revisit those dark corners of your soul, but you indulge in this semi-masochistic endeavor from time to time. It is good to remember that everything was not always as it is now. It never ceases to amaze you, the heart's capacity to withstand pain and loneliness. Both are well known to you, aren't they? Fool... you thought of yourself as above both, and took everything for granted. You, the son of Zeus, raised by a powerful King, endowed with the strength, skill and cunning that are usually found in a group of ten of earth's best men, tasted the bitter drought of mortality without ever stepping into the realm of Hades. You close your eyes, take a deep breath and let your mind be transported into the mist of far-away, soul-wrenching memories, to the night when you lost your other half. -------------------------------------------------------------- Pollux loves watching Castor break a stallion. The interaction between horse and man is a thing of sheer beauty. Castor, resembling a tranquil sea, works his magic on the reluctant stallion; his shoulders thrown back, his powerful body assuming that relaxed posture that reminds Castor of a pugilist right before a fight. Castor's masculine voice assumes the soft, soothing quality of a lover's tone. He becomes, he waits and watches, a mixture of quiet confidence, patience and animal magnetism. The stallion resists the allure; its bearing exudes pride and power untamed. It side steps and tosses its head in protest. It does not want to be tamed, it does not want to trust. It wants to run wild and free, it doesn't want to form this bond with the beautiful mortal. Castor is relentless in his pursuit and slowly the stallion's elegant body, taut lines ready to deal a swift, painful kick to whoever dares approach, starts to gradually lose its dangerous edge while Castor, ever patient, continues to work his charm. Their dance enthralls those around them. They watch and wait, their breaths collectively held until the stallion relents and everyone heaves a sigh of relief... but not Pollux. He knows the stallion never had a chance. How could a simple animal resist the one that holds a God in his thrall? -------------------------------------------------------------- \"I do not like this idea,\" says Castor, shifting in his saddle. Pollux brings his horse around and throws his twin one of those carefree smiles that makes Castor's insides melt and his rod harden faster than he can say Zeus. \"Don't be a sour puss. It will be a fun raid.\" He knows he is using heavy artillery and it works. Castor swallows visibly, his eyes fastened to Pollux's lips. \"Not for the raidees, it won't,\" Castor replies, unconvinced. Pollux tilts his head and asks, \"Don't you wonder what rewards may be for you after such a feat? You'll have your pick of men and women and your name will be legend in Sparta.\" He stops and looks straight into those beautiful eyes that so resemble his own, his voice a sultry whisper. \"I may even let you fuck me after...\" Castor's heart beats faster and Castor gives him an irreverent wink, his expression triumphant. His twin brother looks away, defeated. Silently they head toward their cousins' camp to plan for the raid. -------------------------------------------------------------- Pollux stands naked under the star-lit sky. The rowdy shouts of the nearby camp where their cousins have chosen to stop for the night are somewhat muffled by the sounds of a nearby brook. His bearing is confident and his eyes shine with both lust and the touch of other-worldliness that comes with being the son of Zeus. Castor tries to look away but finds that his efforts are wasted. Pollux is the lodestone that marks his North. It has always been that way, since they were children even when his mind was still unable to understand the feelings his heart commanded. His whole being thrums with longing and his breath catches when Pollux's hands come to rest on his chest. \"No...,\" croaks Castor. Pollux rolls his eyes. \"Why is it so wrong now?\" His hands make their way down to Castor's groin where they find an already hardened shaft. Pollux's mouth forms a little satisfied grin. \"We are to marry those women. We have pledged our troth to them... I cannot deceive them.\" Pollux's expression turns contemptuous. \"They are wombs in which to plant the seeds of our heirs. Marriage is a tool to form alliances and to gain political power...\" Castor interrupts. \"We are to share our lives with them!\" His brother's temper flares. \"No!\" He tightens his grip on his twin's shaft. Castor gasps, he cannot turn away, his body revels in that tantalizing combination of pain and arousal. \"If it is written that I am to love another, why is it that I only find satisfaction when you are riding me like you ride one of your stallions?\" He takes a step closer, his mouth a breath away from Castor's. \"You are the only one that can fill my heart with peace and happiness.\" Castor closes the distance between them and takes his brother's mouth in an earth-shattering kiss. Pollux sighs happily. Their tug-of-war has ended and Castor has relented, but it is Pollux, the demi-god who is conquered. The son of Zeus submits to the mortal. The stallion is tamed and he now craves his master's bit. They make love until the soft beams of Helius and his carriage appear on the horizon. --------------------------------------------------------------- \"The hell you say!\" roars Pollux. \"We were promised half of the heard. That's five hundred heads of cattle and we will take not one less.\" He charges his smug looking cousin, but is stopped by a quick moving Castor taking hold of Pollux's rein. Their cousins' band have their spears all aimed toward the two brothers. Fifty to two, an impossible situation. Idas laughs. \"Well, it seems to me you are outnumbered, son of Zeus, but we thank you for your help in procuring us all this wealth.\" \"So you know, Lynceus tells them, \"Phoebe and Hilaria are safely ensconced in our castle, as we speak.\" \"You are mad if you think you'll get away with this,\" Castor replies trying his best to stop his brother from taking on the lot. They are in a bad situation, outnumbered and in the middle of a hostile territory. At least they are both unharmed and that is a blessing. \"Shut your dog's mouth!\" Lynceus snaps turning to Pollux. \"Why don't you stuff his mouth with your cock and shut your whore's mouth, Pollux. Everyone knows that Zeus granted you a whore so you could satisfy your prurient appetites,\" Idas taunts. His troops cheer their master's bawdy wit with catcalls and wolf-whistles directed at the twins. Pollux is unable to stop his brother and it only takes a second for disaster to strike. Castor lunges at Idas and breaks his neck with his bare hands. The world turns upside down and everything is tinted by the red haze of bloodshed. The air itself takes on the metallic, acrid taste of copper. Pollux lets go of the control he has fought so hard to achieve over his own strength and viciousness, the gifts bestowed by his father, Zeus and the training given by his foster father,Tyndareous, a mighty warrior, burst from him in a gloriously deadly display. After a few hours, the band of thieves along with their treacherous cousins, are all dead. Pollux turns to his brother to congratulate him and do a bit of gloating, but the words stick in his throat. Castor is pale, his breathing is labored, his hand clutches his side, his tunic has a stain that grows by the second. Castor tries to talk, to reassure his brother that it's nothing, just a scratch, but a coughing fit prevents him. Pollux rushes to Castor's side as he collapses to the ground. There is blood on Castor's lips. \"You are hurt!\" Pollux's tone is frantic. His brother is fading in front of his eyes and there is nothing he can do to help. His gifts are in fighting and pugilism, not in healing. He sees Castor eyes start to close. \"Stay with me!\" he begs. Castor draws a shuddering breath, he opens his mouth, but Pollux covers it with his index finger. \"Don't... you'll get better. I'll run and get a healer for you.\" Castor shakes his head sadly and with great effort takes his brother hand away from his face. He brings it to his blood stained lips and kisses it. \"There is no time.\" \"Of course there is time. Hades will not have you yet. Not if I can prevent it.\" Castor smiles, a wan remembrance of the radiant gesture he used to melt his brother's heart during his life. He beckons his brother to silence with a gesture from his hand. \"What Idas said, it is a lie... I had a choice... I chose you. I have always been yours, because my heart wanted you since it was able to make a choice.\" He stops for a second to catch his breath. \"I will love you, always...\" Castor exhales his last breath. A soul-wrenching scream is heard across the plain. It reverberates for miles and miles, filling the hearts of those who happen to be in the vicinity with a feeling of abject loneliness for days. A demi-god learns what loneliness and bitterness taste like. -------------------------------------------------------------- \"What are you doing?\" Castors asks. You wake from your self-inflicted trance and turn toward that most beloved voice. Castor is watching you. You notice that the light of the nearby stars reflect in his eyes; it almost looks as if he has stars in place of eyes. Concern and care are written all over his handsome face. \"Have I told you how fortunate I am to have you?\" You ask him. Castor tilts his head, that head you fought to have crowned with stars. \"Are you in one of you maudlin moods?\" He asks, his eyes alight with a mischievous gleam. You love that he can go from being concerned to mischievous in a heartbeat. You laugh. You are happy he is here with you, in a version of paradise made for you both. Forever. \"I think I am,\" you say. \"I think I need you to make wild love to me and make me forget that you once made my heart bleed with loneliness for having been born a mortal.\" Castor rolls his eyes. \"Fool,\" he says, but his eyes are dark with lust and longing for you. You love to tease him. You are fortunate to be able to laugh with your soul-mate. You know it is not always the case. You only have to cast your eyes eastward and look at Zeus and Hera's union. He tugs on your hand, bringing your meandering mind back to him and leads you away. And you, the son of Zeus close your eyes and let yourself be led by the horse-master, once again.",

      "Yes, those times were hard and you would rather never revisit those dark corners of your soul, but you indulge in this semi-masochistic endeavor from time to time.",
      "It is good to remember that everything was not always as it is now.",
      "It never ceases to amaze you, the heart's capacity to withstand pain and loneliness.",
      "Both are well known to you, aren't they?",
      "Fool... you thought of yourself as above both, and took everything for granted.",
      "You, the son of Zeus, raised by a powerful King, endowed with the strength, skill and cunning that are usually found in a group of ten of earth's best men, tasted the bitter drought of mortality without ever stepping into the realm of Hades.",
      "You close your eyes, take a deep breath and let your mind be transported into the mist of far-away, soul-wrenching memories, to the night when you lost your other half.",
      "-------------------------------------------------------------- Pollux loves watching Castor break a stallion.",
      "The interaction between horse and man is a thing of sheer beauty.",
      "Castor, resembling a tranquil sea, works his magic on the reluctant stallion; his shoulders thrown back, his powerful body assuming that relaxed posture that reminds Castor of a pugilist right before a fight.",
      "Castor's masculine voice assumes the soft, soothing quality of a lover's tone.",
      "He becomes, he waits and watches, a mixture of quiet confidence, patience and animal magnetism.",
      "The stallion resists the allure; its bearing exudes pride and power untamed.",
      "It side steps and tosses its head in protest.",
      "It does not want to be tamed, it does not want to trust.",
      "It wants to run wild and free, it doesn't want to form this bond with the beautiful mortal.",
      "Castor is relentless in his pursuit and slowly the stallion's elegant body, taut lines ready to deal a swift, painful kick to whoever dares approach, starts to gradually lose its dangerous edge while Castor, ever patient, continues to work his charm.",
      "Their dance enthralls those around them.",
      "They watch and wait, their breaths collectively held until the stallion relents and everyone heaves a sigh of relief...",
      "but not Pollux.",
      "He knows the stallion never had a chance.",
      "How could a simple animal resist the one that holds a God in his thrall?",
      "-------------------------------------------------------------- \"I do not like this idea,\" says Castor, shifting in his saddle.",
      "Pollux brings his horse around and throws his twin one of those carefree smiles that makes Castor's insides melt and his rod harden faster than he can say Zeus.",
      "\"Don't be a sour puss.",
      "It will be a fun raid.\"",
      "He knows he is using heavy artillery and it works.",
      "Castor swallows visibly, his eyes fastened to Pollux's lips.",
      "\"Not for the raidees, it won't,\" Castor replies, unconvinced.",
      "Pollux tilts his head and asks, \"Don't you wonder what rewards may be for you after such a feat?",
      "You'll have your pick of men and women and your name will be legend in Sparta.\"",
      "He stops and looks straight into those beautiful eyes that so resemble his own, his voice a sultry whisper.",
      "\"I may even let you fuck me after...\" Castor's heart beats faster and Castor gives him an irreverent wink, his expression triumphant.",
      "His twin brother looks away, defeated.",
      "Silently they head toward their cousins' camp to plan for the raid.",
      "-------------------------------------------------------------- Pollux stands naked under the star-lit sky.",
      "The rowdy shouts of the nearby camp where their cousins have chosen to stop for the night are somewhat muffled by the sounds of a nearby brook.",
      "His bearing is confident and his eyes shine with both lust and the touch of other-worldliness that comes with being the son of Zeus.",
      "Castor tries to look away but finds that his efforts are wasted.",
      "Pollux is the lodestone that marks his North.",
      "It has always been that way, since they were children even when his mind was still unable to understand the feelings his heart commanded.",
      "His whole being thrums with longing and his breath catches when Pollux's hands come to rest on his chest.",
      "\"No...,\" croaks Castor.",
      "Pollux rolls his eyes.",
      "\"Why is it so wrong now?\"",
      "His hands make their way down to Castor's groin where they find an already hardened shaft.",
      "Pollux's mouth forms a little satisfied grin.",
      "\"We are to marry those women.",
      "We have pledged our troth to them...",
      "I cannot deceive them.\"",
      "Pollux's expression turns contemptuous.",
      "\"They are wombs in which to plant the seeds of our heirs.",
      "Marriage is a tool to form alliances and to gain political power...\" Castor interrupts.",
      "\"We are to share our lives with them!\"",
      "His brother's temper flares.",
      "\"No!\"",
      "He tightens his grip on his twin's shaft.",
      "Castor gasps, he cannot turn away, his body revels in that tantalizing combination of pain and arousal.",
      "\"If it is written that I am to love another, why is it that I only find satisfaction when you are riding me like you ride one of your stallions?\"",
      "He takes a step closer, his mouth a breath away from Castor's.",
      "\"You are the only one that can fill my heart with peace and happiness.\"",
      "Castor closes the distance between them and takes his brother's mouth in an earth-shattering kiss.",
      "Pollux sighs happily.",
      "Their tug-of-war has ended and Castor has relented, but it is Pollux, the demi-god who is conquered.",
      "The son of Zeus submits to the mortal.",
      "The stallion is tamed and he now craves his master's bit.",
      "They make love until the soft beams of Helius and his carriage appear on the horizon.",
      "--------------------------------------------------------------- \"The hell you say!\"",
      "roars Pollux.",
      "\"We were promised half of the heard.",
      "That's five hundred heads of cattle and we will take not one less.\"",
      "He charges his smug looking cousin, but is stopped by a quick moving Castor taking hold of Pollux's rein.",
      "Their cousins' band have their spears all aimed toward the two brothers.",
      "Fifty to two, an impossible situation.",
      "Idas laughs.",
      "\"Well, it seems to me you are outnumbered, son of Zeus, but we thank you for your help in procuring us all this wealth.\"",
      "\"So you know, Lynceus tells them, \"Phoebe and Hilaria are safely ensconced in our castle, as we speak.\"",
      "\"You are mad if you think you'll get away with this,\" Castor replies trying his best to stop his brother from taking on the lot.",
      "They are in a bad situation, outnumbered and in the middle of a hostile territory.",
      "At least they are both unharmed and that is a blessing.",
      "\"Shut your dog's mouth!\"",
      "Lynceus snaps turning to Pollux.",
      "\"Why don't you stuff his mouth with your cock and shut your whore's mouth, Pollux.",
      "Everyone knows that Zeus granted you a whore so you could satisfy your prurient appetites,\" Idas taunts.",
      "His troops cheer their master's bawdy wit with catcalls and wolf-whistles directed at the twins.",
      "Pollux is unable to stop his brother and it only takes a second for disaster to strike.",
      "Castor lunges at Idas and breaks his neck with his bare hands.",
      "The world turns upside down and everything is tinted by the red haze of bloodshed.",
      "The air itself takes on the metallic, acrid taste of copper.",
      "Pollux lets go of the control he has fought so hard to achieve over his own strength and viciousness, the gifts bestowed by his father, Zeus and the training given by his foster father,Tyndareous, a mighty warrior, burst from him in a gloriously deadly display.",
      "After a few hours, the band of thieves along with their treacherous cousins, are all dead.",
      "Pollux turns to his brother to congratulate him and do a bit of gloating, but the words stick in his throat.",
      "Castor is pale, his breathing is labored, his hand clutches his side, his tunic has a stain that grows by the second.",
      "Castor tries to talk, to reassure his brother that it's nothing, just a scratch, but a coughing fit prevents him.",
      "Pollux rushes to Castor's side as he collapses to the ground.",
      "There is blood on Castor's lips.",
      "\"You are hurt!\"",
      "Pollux's tone is frantic.",
      "His brother is fading in front of his eyes and there is nothing he can do to help.",
      "His gifts are in fighting and pugilism, not in healing.",
      "He sees Castor eyes start to close.",
      "\"Stay with me!\"",
      "he begs.",
      "Castor draws a shuddering breath, he opens his mouth, but Pollux covers it with his index finger.",
      "\"Don't... you'll get better.",
      "I'll run and get a healer for you.\"",
      "Castor shakes his head sadly and with great effort takes his brother hand away from his face.",

      "\"What Idas said, it is a lie...",
      "I had a choice...",
      "I chose you.",
      "I have always been yours, because my heart wanted you since it was able to make a choice.\"",
      "He stops for a second to catch his breath.",
      "\"I will love you, always...\" Castor exhales his last breath.",
      "A soul-wrenching scream is heard across the plain.",
      "It reverberates for miles and miles, filling the hearts of those who happen to be in the vicinity with a feeling of abject loneliness for days.",
      "A demi-god learns what loneliness and bitterness taste like.",
      "-------------------------------------------------------------- \"What are you doing?\" Castors asks.",
      "You wake from your self-inflicted trance and turn toward that most beloved voice.",
      "Castor is watching you.",
      "You notice that the light of the nearby stars reflect in his eyes; it almost looks as if he has stars in place of eyes.",
      "Concern and care are written all over his handsome face.",
      "\"Have I told you how fortunate I am to have you?\" You ask him.",
      "Castor tilts his head, that head you fought to have crowned with stars.",

      "He asks, his eyes alight with a mischievous gleam.",
      "You love that he can go from being concerned to mischievous in a heartbeat.",
      "You laugh.",
      "You are happy he is here with you, in a version of paradise made for you both.",
      "Forever.",
      "\"I think I am,\" you say.",
      "\"I think I need you to make wild love to me and make me forget that you once made my heart bleed with loneliness for having been born a mortal.\"",
      "Castor rolls his eyes.",
      "\"Fool,\" he says, but his eyes are dark with lust and longing for you.",
      "You love to tease him.",
      "You are fortunate to be able to laugh with your soul-mate.",
      "You know it is not always the case.",
      "You only have to cast your eyes eastward and look at Zeus and Hera's union.",
      "He tugs on your hand, bringing your meandering mind back to him and leads you away.",
      "And you, the son of Zeus close your eyes and let yourself be led by the horse-master, once again."

    "text": "\"You don't have to go, you know,\" he says, folding her into his arms like he'll never let go. \"I do,\" she says, her voice muffled against the front of his shirt; it's been long enough now that she hardly notices the scents of death clinging to him, the undefinable but chilling smell that, according to him, lingers around every pathologist. In the beginning, he said she'd get used to it; she never really has, though. It's always there around him, just under the roses, or lilies, or whatever other flowers she's brought home from the shop to brighten their house. \"You know I have to go,\" she says (they do this every single year, still). \"That's the deal we made.\" He releases her then, and sighs, moving off to close the curtains against the early night. The days have grown long enough to exist once more, up here in the far north of the world; the hours of sunlight that leak through shine down pale and thin, but brighter than the perpetual twilight that darkens much of the season. The first year, after their whirlwind romance and hasty wedding, after he'd brought her up to a world she hardly recognized as part of the same planet she'd always lived on, she'd nearly wasted away from the lack of light and fresh air, kept indoors by the dark and the cold. Her world shrunk down to only him, and all that kept her from taking the next plane back south to her mother (beyond, of course, the extraordinary difficulty in doing such a thing; travel up here had to be planned extensively ahead of time) was the fresh fruit he brought her daily, obtained from mysterious sources at what she was certain must have been terrible expense. After that first season, it got easier - once she demonstrated her way with plants and her eye for color and arrangements, the florist in town was happy to have her, even if only seasonally; over time she'd made her own friends, her own place, here in his land. They'd learned to be happy with each other, she with her struggling winter flowers, he with the mysteries of the dead. Except, of course, for this one point of contention. \"I'll come back,\" she says the next day, bags packed beside her. \"I always do.\" \"I know,\" he says, but his eyes are mournful, and she wonders if one year she'll come back to find him lost completely, disappeared into the company of those who are already gone. Her mother sighs and wipes dark soil from her hands, shaking her head over the row of newly planted bulbs. \"I wish you wouldn't go, dear.\" Persephone tips her face up to the sun. The seasons barely change, this far to the south, in the rich, humid lands where she was born. Life is everywhere here, in abundance - the birds calling from the trees, insects humming through the air, the breeze heavy with the scent of flowers and a slight tang of salt off the nearby sea. And she's warm, warm straight through to her bones, warm enough to raise a sheen of sweat on her skin. Almost perfect, and yet... \"I have to go, Mama. I miss him, you know that.\" \"You certainly speak of him enough.\" Her mother's lips thin into a disapproving line, and she rises, turning towards the house. It's been so many years Persephone has to think carefully to keep track of them all, and her mother still doesn't approve of the man who stole her daughter away (in her words), still doesn't approve of the life they've made, or where they've made it. And she's so lonely down here (they'd always been so close, just the two of them together) that Persephone can't break the agreement they made so many years ago, can't bring herself to stay in the north for the whole of the year. Of course, the place has its own attractions, she admits, watching bees and butterflies flit from flower to flower, hummingbirds darting like tiny jewels through the air. Her mother's garden always seemed the most beautiful place in existence. For her, it was made all the more beautiful the day a dark-haired man from a different world had leaned over the gate and asked her to dinner. She suspects her mother would not agree on that particular point. \"I'll come back, Mama,\" she says, leaving a swift kiss on her mother's cheek. \"I always do.\" \"I know it,\" her mother says, shooing her off with a gesture, but her eyes are wet and she looks so very lonely already; Persephone turns away, to the north. Her heart pulls, and her feet must follow, for another season.",

    "text": "Praxis Sing to me of the man, Muse, the man of twists and turns... Wait. That's not how this story begins. There once was a man from Nantucket... Closer in spirit but not quite there yet. Once upon a time there was a man and a woman, who were actually Greek gods and who should have known far better than to sleep together, but genetic stupidity, overactive hormones, and that little thing called destiny kept drawing them together even though the woman was unhappily married to a man with ready access to red hot metal and her lover was too busy killing people in glorious, gory ways to really give their relationship the proper attention it deserved. That's about right. It's not Homer, but it'll do. And even though there were numerous strikes against their relationship, such as infidelity, incest, and interfering relations, they nonetheless stayed relatively devoted to each other through horrifically stupid wars, random love affairs and triangles, family squabbles, and the whole fall of the gods into oblivion. They didn't live happily ever after. However, they did have amazingly great sex. In the end, isn't that what good relationships are all about? Anadyomene Depending on how you look at it, they weren't precisely meant for each other. He was born to Zeus and Hera, who pretty much hated him from the moment he was born. Well, the scholars don't have exact dates on when his parents started loathing him and wishing he would just get run over by a chariot, but the fact of the matter is, almost no one in the family liked him except for his uncle, Hades, who just liked the fact that his nephew kept him well supplied with bodies. And Aphrodite, who was family too, either his half-sister or great-aunt, depending on how you look at the genealogy. One story is that she was born out of Zeus and Dione, making her Ares' half-sister and well-within traditional Greek mythical family values. This is, sadly, the more normal and therefore, less likely version of her birth. The other story is that she was born out of her father's discarded genitals when Cronus chopped them off and threw them into the sea before hooking up with his sister and producing Zeus who would turn right around and get rid of his father, and then hook up with his own sister. Moral of this story: Keep it in the family. Alternatively: sleeping with your sister is good for a while, but will probably screw you over in the end. Finally: when your father is as dysfunctional as Ares' was, sleeping with your great-great-aunt is nothing special. Pandemos They didn't meet in cute \"boy meets girl and falls head over heels in love fashion before they frolic together in a sunlit field.\" For one thing, Ares' fields tended to be less filled with flowers and sunshine, and more filled with corpses and men about to become corpses. Blood is slippery after all, and running would only get you a foot in someone's stomach. Instead, they met at a family dinner, one of those atrociously uncomfortable affairs where half the people at the table are on the brink of using one of their dinner knives and jabbing it into their nearest and dearest for secret, but clearly important reasons, and the other half are just praying to get through without too much bloodshed. On this particular night, Ares had bet his uncle good odds on missing body limbs and intended to collect, even if he had to do the chopping himself. Then he caught her eye (or rather she caught his) and everything he had planned that night went out the window. He had seen her around before - it's hard to miss the most gorgeous woman you've ever seen in your life, even if you suspect she's out of your league and old enough to be your grandmother (or great-grandmother, he had heard about the family tree too and it was worrisome, though not enough to keep him from staring at her breasts). Ares was only a boy by Olympian standards, after all, and it wasn't too hard to convince him that there might be far more interesting things in his future than another glass of wine and several arguments over the nobility of war. As for Aphrodite, she was drunk and bored, and hey, it was him or Hermes, and she wasn't quite plastered enough for that yet. So he was smitten and she was intrigued and just like that, they were making plans to hook up right after Hera stopped trying to beat Zeus to death with his own chair. Epitragidia It should have been horrible since Ares was aggressive and violent and prone to leaving his partners yelling obscenities at him as they stumbled out of his bed, and Aphrodite's standards could be rather high, given the fact that she was the patron of the act in question. It should have been awkward, because no matter how many times either one of them had done it, it was the first time for both of them to do it with each other and there were so many things they didn't know about each other. It's always a problem when you realize one partner definitely doesn't want your tongue going there, there's nothing to do but put on your clothes and avoid making eye contact. It should have been the textbook case of bad decisions and poor hook-ups. It should have been in one of those magazine articles with the headline \"Did you make a mistake? Ten reasons to regret the night before.\" It wasn't any of these things and that's where everything goes truly wrong. Hetaira It should have been just a one-night stand. Neither one of them was known for commitment and given the family history, it wasn't surprising if they preferred to stay clear of marriage or anything remotely close to it. It wasn't for one night only. It wasn't even for a week or a month or even a decade or so. It started and it didn't really stop. At some point, they forgot when it had began and it was as if it had always been that way. They were together and they couldn't remember when they hadn't been. They saw each other in the day on battlefields, in temples, and in Olympus above, where they hid from Hera, who could be an obstacle when it came to premarital sex. They saw each other at night anywhere they wanted to, any way they wanted to. They could have stopped it anytime they wanted to. They should have stopped it. He didn't really need more reasons for his family to loathe him, and she wasn't in a strong enough position to challenge the family on anything. Then it got even worse. Despina The Greek Gods were known for many things. They were known for bravery, for honor, for beauty, for strength, for prowess in battle, for creation, for destruction, and for a host of other heroic qualities. No one ever said they were known for common sense. Zeus, as well as being the king of the gods, was the king of monumentally stupid decisions that may have seemed like a good idea at the time to anyone who didn't think ahead five seconds or so. For example, one can suppose that he was correct in assuming that having a really hot relative such as Aphrodite might promote strife in the family, given the family's tendencies towards in-fighting and incest. And it was understandable that he would seek to control her by marrying her off to someone he thought could manage her. Nowhere in any of this thinking is it clear why anyone would think Hephaestus would be the best choice. Yes, it's perfectly reasonable to assume that someone who is known for her love of physical beauty should be forever faithful to a man who was known for his lack of it. Aphrodite was many things, including being a hell of a lot smarter than she was given credit for by the rest of Olympus, but nowhere in her description were the words \"selfless,\" \"compassionate,\" or \"able to see the beauty deep within someone.\" For that matter, one has to wonder just what Zeus thought marriage would accomplish, given his own record on the issue and his own wife's recalcitrance. Given all these factors, it's not surprising therefore, that Aphrodite, upon her marriage, decided that adultery was the preferable option to fidelity and hopped promptly back into Ares' bed. The sex got even better. Kallipygos Every couple has something memorable that defines them as a couple that says this is who we are and how we love. For some, it's how they met - a Ferris wheel, a crowded subway, or a glance across an infinite space that lasts only for a second but is enough to connect. Others define themselves by events that occur later in their courtship, such as a romantic anniversary or a third date that ended with a kiss and a promise of something more. At least, the Hallmark cards and diamond commercials say so, and who are we to doubt them? Some couples are less fortunate, having moments defined by embarrassment, by violence, by any number of things that make the police reports, but not the family album. In any case, the memory is such that it can spread to their friends and family, becoming the toast at a reception, the inside joke at a cocktail party, the story told to grandchildren decades later. The important thing to remember here is that a couple rarely chooses what they would be known for - it just happens. Sometimes it's a tale of a first kiss in a lush garden, while birds sing, the sun shines down, and all is filled with happiness, joy, and possibly singing woodland creatures. And sometimes it's a couple trapped naked in a bed under a net made by a woman's jealous husband while the male half of the family watches and alternately mocks and makes suggestive offers. However, some memories are wrong, and some stories are twisted, and this isn't quite the way it actually happened. Three truths to remember: Despite what everyone says, the goddesses didn't stay behind because they were modest or ashamed or thought that it wasn't their place to see their fellow gods caught in flagrante delicto. They just thought it was stupid and if they wanted to see someone naked and tied down, they would just go to one of those red-light temples. Nobody in the triangle won. Not Hephaestus, broken-hearted and bitter, who once again caved after pressure from his dad and let his wife come home rather than letting his uncle sleep with her. Not Ares, who had to put up with jokes on the battlefield for centuries to come and his lover freezing him out of the bed for a good while. Not Aphrodite, who got some serious chain-link burns and a distinct impression that all male gods truly, truly sucked. They knew there was a net there. How could they not? They weren't that stupid. It's just that it was their anniversary and both of them thought the other one was planning a very romantic surprise for the other. Nothing says \"Thanks for all the great times\" like some unexpected bondage.After all the tears and the reprisals, the threats of revenge, the bribes, the shouting, the bloodshed, and the nudity, they still didn't stop being together. Pandemos Everyone had an opinion on the relationship. His parents disliked it and would have spent more energy towards thwarting the two of them (or at least Ares, since they would have let the Titans sit down to tea before they would have wanted him to be happy), but Zeus was too busy appearing as random waterfowl to sleep with attractive farmers and avoiding Hera, who was trying to catch him sleeping with said random farmers. Hephaestus, clearly, had some personal feelings on the matter, but after the disastrous net incident, he kept his hatred to himself and preferred to make high-quality weaponry and jewelry in the hopes that either he'd find a way to kill Ares with the former, or win Aphrodite's heart with the latter. The rest of the Olympians divided themselves between pretending to be above the situation and being jealous of Ares' good fortune. In the end, most of them ignored it, preferring to concentrate on their own affairs and leaving whatever it was the two of them were doing to fate, or as it were, the Fates. Even they didn't want to get involved. Thus, it went on, as certain as a thread of Lachesis. Porne The sex was still great. They kissed in the middle of Troy. They hit it in Cythera and Thebes. They slept together on a warship in the Mediterranean Sea. They fucked on a field in Cyprus. They desecrated a temple in Athens. They made love in Macedonia. Whatever you want to call it, they did it. They did everything they could think of. They tried everything mortals had thought of. They even experimented with stuff their family did, though the less said about that unfortunate misunderstanding with a random swan, Ares' libido, and a misunderstanding over Aphrodite's current form, the better. They had no fear, no boundaries, and no restraints (except for the ones they stole from Hephaestus' workshop). Well, perhaps they had one limitation. They could not be faithful. There were affairs with mortals, with demigods, with fellow Olympians. None of it really meant anything, however. There could be hurt feelings, but the bond was too strong for any random fling to make an impact. Until Adonis. Aphrodite never forgave Ares for that. He never forgave her either. Anosia Sometimes, no matter what you do, no matter how many kinks you experiment with, how many places you do it in, how many times you fight and make up and fight about your make up, it's not enough. It was his fault. He should have paid more attention to her and less to lopping people's heads off on the battlefield. He should have been less jealous. He should have never killed Adonis. It was her fault. She should have made him realize that no matter how many lovers she took, he would always come back to her. She should have stood up for him more. She should have never made him think she would forgive him one day. It was their fault. They should have ended it after she got married. They should have only had one night. They should have never exchanged glances. Now, all that remained was to divide the children (Fear and Dread to Ares; Eros, Lust, and Unrequited Love to Aphrodite, joint custody of Harmony) and fade out of recorded lore so that their ending fades into the haze of forgotten myth. Centuries later, they watch the world they knew crumble into the dust of abandoned gods and forsaken worship. Humanity goes on. Many gods do not. Epitymbidia Fade in. A couple on the edge of a cliff, hair whipping in the wind. Behind them, a motorcycle gleams. Off in the distance, you can hear the distant wail of sirens. The boy sneers as he fishes out a cigarette from a pack and lights it contemptuously. Everything he does is in contempt of society. Even his leather jacket screams, \"I hate you and your conformist ways and I intend to take you all down in a sea of blood, guts, and glory.\" It's a long message for a piece of clothing, but he's been working on it for a while. The girl, meanwhile, opens up her purse and pulls out a lipstick. She swathes her lips in a red that's so suggestive five nearby school districts have banned it from being worn anywhere on their premises. It's naturally a best seller. The ocean crashes below them, as he puts an arm around her waist. They stare at the sharp rocks at the bottom. It's risky, symbolic, and damn if it doesn't turn the both of them on even more. He gives her a cocky smile. \"Sorry about the ride. Wish it could have been smoother for you.\" She smiles back, lips like blood. \"I wouldn't have wanted it anything but rough.\" The sirens get closer. She begins to shiver and he takes his jacket off, putting it around her shoulders. \"Looks like this it. Are you sure you want to do this?\" She looks steadily at him. \"I don't want to be forgotten. I want to be famous.\" \"Baby,\" he says, clutching her to his side. \"We're going to be legends.\" They kiss fiercely. Then take a step forward.. Freeze frame. Cut to black. Nothing but darkness for several minutes. Then we zoom back, beyond the bodies that may be living, may be dead, may someday be remembered, or may fade away into obscurity, and the sirens that may catch them or may arrive on nothing but dust. Move further back and we are in a diner across the road as a couple sits in a booth. The man is scowling out the window as he sees the flashing lights across the distance. \"Fucking kids,\" he says as he turns to look at the spectacle outside. He's brutish, attractive and scarred, with a glare for anyone who passes by the table. The woman smiles at him. \"You used to be that young.\" Her hands, slim and perfect in the sunlight, flash a diamond ring that's equally as perfect. \"At least they're trying.\" He snorts. \"Not very well. I could do better with my hands tied behind my back.\" \"As I recall, you have.\" The glance they exchange this time is not one of promise and the hope of something new and exciting, but one of familiarity. It is the look of a couple that has been through everything and done everything wonderful and horrible to each other and still decides to stick it out a few more years. The couple gets up from the table, his arm around her waist. On the way out, he knocks over a chair, just because. A waiter scowls at him, but is immediately mollified by the dazzling smile the woman strikes at him. Another waiter thinks the smile is for him and the two get into a fistfight, Outside, the couple smiles at the sounds of jealousy, anger, and destruction they leave in their wake. If you asked them how they hooked up, they'll tell you they don't remember a time when they weren't. They've always been a couple. No matter where they go, what they do, who they fuck, they're together. They could try to stop, but they don't want to. They'll never really want to. After all, the sex is still amazing.",

    "text": "Ah, to relax. I have been waiting for this for so long. Things have been pretty hectic here at Hunter and Hunter. I have been working seventy hour weeks, doing all nighters and putting in more hours than humanly possible. My social life is pretty non-existent, so it's not like it matters, but I am feeling pretty run down. I need this break like a fish needs her water and a dog needs his meat. The spa I've chosen is exquisite. They have minimalist decor, green tea and pretty Japanese mats on which to sit. I'm having a hot stone massage later on and I'm going to order sashimi for dinner. There will be high quality sake and fresh tropical fruit. The firm pays, for which I'm grateful. For now, I am going to sit in this outdoor hot spring, watching the stars and contemplating the shape of the moon. It's going to be beautiful and relaxing and just what I need right now. It is going to make it all worth it; the solitary night labor, the soul crushing deadlines and dealing with boss Z's increasingly difficult demands. I slip out of my bath robe and feel the night wind on my skin. As I slide into the water, I can feel the contrast of the night breeze on my face and the hot water on my body. I am having one of those moments you have in life when everything is perfect and life makes sense. I am about to close my eyes and yield to this feeling of absolute clarity. But wait - what is this? There is someone here. What the hell? Someone is watching.... Someone is watching me. Someone is spying on me. There is a pervert in the artfully planted bamboo forest and that pervert is looking at me. He, because it is always a he in these kinds of situations, is taking delight in my naked body and ruining my moment. First I feel disappointed, then I feel violated, and then I feel hot, searing rage running through every cell of my body. I raise my body. I take my spear. He picked the wrong woman to fuck with. A small man stands transfixed in a small bamboo patch, as Ipour my wrath down on him. He is holding a pair of binoculars in his hand and is wearing a silly, guilty smile on his face. The smile freezes as he is no longer a man, but a boar. I snicker. The boar runs for it. His little legs are moving desperately as he struggles to get away from the vengeful, towering woman.Here comes the dogs though, feral dogs and plenty of them. Hungry hunting dogs on the prowl. They tear into the frantic boar. He screams for his life. They tear him apart and they eat. I laugh as I watch the scene unfold. Nobody gets to watch my body without my consent. Fucking creepsters. I take my spear and walk back to the hot spring. The night is mine again.",

    "text": "\"It is said that the sea gives nothing back, but I know this not to be so. It takes, in truth, as it has taken from me, as it bore my first love far away and fast, while I lay sleeping on the sands. And I wept then, and raged, and cursed the sea and all who sail upon it, and wished doom down on Theseus, who I had loved only hours before. The sea did not listen, or so I thought. It was pitiless, inexorable, the waves washing higher over the shore, smoothing the sands and erasing all sign of the Athenians' passage, leaving me alone and bitter, a broken thing. It was from the seafoam he arose, the froth of it clinging across his skin for a moment, shining in the light of the setting sun. I knew him for a god, for who else can rise from the waters as though they are made from them? But he gave no other clue to his identity, circling me like a prowling cat, noting my dishevelment, reaching out with a gentle hand to smooth back the hair fallen over my brow. He was beautiful, beautiful as the sun, and filled with as much power and menace as the sea itself, yet it was more than that - I had known powerful men before, and beautiful ones besides. But I had never once known one who looked at me as though he saw me for who I was, and found that beloved. He saw not a princess, or a savior, or a fortune in human form, but simply a half-dressed girl on a beach, with windblown hair and a face streaked with tears and flushed with rage. All this he saw, and he knew it for the woman beneath, one who was not happy, not content with her lot but longed to escape it, to make something more. And his eyes told me, long before his lips said the words, that he thought this a worthy feeling. He knelt beside me then, the white sand clinging to his golden skin, and said, 'Why so sad, love? He was unworthy of you, and the precious salt of your tears is wasted on him.' 'Drink with me, and forget all sorrow,' he said, and set his hand into the sand, and there appeared a river of wine. So I knew him then for Dionysus, and he promised me rivers of milk and honey, and all else I should desire, as we lay together in bliss, on the purple robe he had spread beneath us. My crown he set in the sky as stars above us, so that something of me should always be looking down on him, and for many years we lived together, in love and loyalty. Every promise he made to me, he kept, down to the last - that I should fight by his side, for I had had enough of standing in the shadows, waiting for heroes to return. And so I have come to this place, for Perseus turned me to stone in that battle. A statue and a crown of stars are all that remain in the world above, to show that I have lived. Those, and the grief of a god, for I fancy I can hear his mourning even now - a quiet sound, but steady, and unending, enough to rend the world and keep the dead with the living. So ends my tale, my queen; is it enough to satisfy?\" \"It is the tale of your marriage,\" said Persephone, fingers brushing the petals of black and silver flowers, \"but not, I think, of your life.\" Ariadne smiled, looking across the fields to where the distant rivers lay, the borders of the Underworld. \"No; a life is always more than a succession of loves, as I am certain you would agree. But for me, now, it is the only part that matters.\" Pollen dusted Persephone's fingertips, glistening in the soft light; the goddess studied it a moment, then sent it wafting away on the breath of a few whispered words. \"Why do you believe this to be so?\" she asked, turning to Ariadne. Eyes focused on a far distant horizon, Ariadne remembered the ebb and flow of the waves, the seafoam tickling her feet, the sands warm and giving beneath her. \"Because,\" she said. \"He comes for me.\"",

    "text": "Ariadne doesn't believe in love at first sight, any more. She used to. It was, or so she told herself, the reason for helping Theseus defeat her father's minotaur. He had been so strong, so glorious, so full of confidence in himself; and Ariadne, smitten, had wanted to do anything for him. Her interpretation of 'anything' had willingly included sailing off with him. It hadn't included being waking up to find herself entirely abandoned. Naxos was a beautiful island but it was still an island, and it wasn't home. After most of a day of searching for Theseus, without any luck aside from a shepherd boy's report of a ship much like his sailing away, she told the ocean precisely what she thought of Theseus, his parentage, and love in general, and vowed that she would never love again. That promise lasted approximately one month three days three hours and twenty-six minutes. # \"I love you,\" Dionysus said. \"Come away with me.\" He had wonderfully expressive eyes, and a graceful figure, and Ariadne reminded herself that good looks aren't everything. \"You don't know me,\" she pointed out stubbornly. \"I know everything I need to.\" He smiled, and held out a goblet full of a dark heady-smelling liquid. \"Here; drink.\" \"You know nothing,\" she said, but took the goblet and sniffed cautiously. \"What is this?\" \"I know that you are mortal but with beauty worthy of a god; and I know that you hold yourself as one used to royal courts but are dressed as a commoner--\" \"It's more comfortable,\" she pointed out, looking down at what she was wearing. \"--and I know that you are thirsty. Drink,\" he added, using one elegant figure to nudge the goblet towards her mouth. \"I promise you no harm will come.\" \"I'm sure you say that to all the girls,\" Ariadne muttered, but she took a sip anyway. It was glorious. She said nothing, but his face lit up with a delighted smile. \"Is there more?\" she asked when she had finished; at his nod, she commanded, \"Serve it.\" \"As you wish,\" he said softly, and poured more, and smiled. # In the time she had spent with Theseus, they had had relations a few times, and while he was not the worst lover imaginable, he was not the best either. It was not uncommon for him to take his pleasure and then sleep, leaving Ariadne restless and unsated. Such was the way of men, or so she had come to believe. But the first time she made love with Dionysus -- both of them sober enough but flushed with giddy delight, warm skin a lovely contrast with the gentle night breeze, the stars bright and clear like Dionysus' eyes -- it was a completely different experience. He was attentive to her, and gentle without being meek, with all the patient endurance of a long-distance runner; and when dawn came creeping across the sky, she kissed him and settled into his embrace and murmured drowsily, \"Don't ever leave me.\" \"I promise,\" he said. She woke later in his arms, and decided that perhaps there was something to this love thing after all. # There came a time when Ariadne died, as mortals do, and went to the Underworld. She grew listless, unable to find peace without Dionysus. \"We all miss the sunlight,\" one woman told her, \"but you grow accustomed to this place in time.\" \"It's not the world I miss,\" Ariadne said irritably, \"it is my husband.\" \"He will come here eventually,\" said the woman, who introduced herself as Semele. \"Have faith.\" But Ariadne knew that he would not, and said as much, \"for he is the son of Zeus, and the children of gods do not die.\" Semele grimaced. \"The consorts of gods do,\" she said with surprising venom. But then she settled herself next to Ariadne and said, \"Tell me of him.\" So she did. She spoke of all the things she loved about him; of all the little annoyances that she missed; of all the ways that he made her smile, made her cry, made her laugh, made her rage. Semele dried the tears off of Ariadne's face when she was done. \"That is the true measure of love,\" she said. \"Who you want to live for is a part of it. Who you can't bear to spend eternity without, though? That is a stronger sign.\" # But it turned out that Dionysus did come, walking into Hades' throne room as though he belonged there, flanked by white leopards. \"I have come for what is mine,\" he said as he bowed to the lord of the Underworld. \"Nothing here is yours,\" Hades said curtly. \"This realm is mine. Those who are still living do not belong here.\" Dionysus smiled. One leopard stretched; the other yawned, baring teeth that were impossibly sharp and a curling pink tongue. \"I will leave with those I came for.\" He held out a hand to Ariadne -- \"I told you I would never leave you,\" he said, \"did you think death would stop me?\" -- and another to the woman Semele. \"Mother.\" \"You're his mother?\" Ariadne asked. \"Apparently so,\" Semele said, raising an eyebrow at Dionysus, \"though for a son of mine he took plenty long to come visit me.\" Dionysus gave a sunny smile. \"I had other distractions.\" \"I can see that,\" Semele said; but the look she gave Ariadne was one of conspiratorial friendliness, not any sort of bitterness. \"You don't call, you don't write...\" \"You don't have to come with me,\" Dionysus said pleasantly. \"Nonsense; what sort of mother would I be if I disappointed my dearest son?\" she returned, and Ariadne snickered a bit. Hades stood up. \"No one who is dead leaves my realm.\" Ariadne stepped forward, ready to unleash some sort of retort on him, but before she could do so, someone else spoke. \"Darling,\" Persephone said sweetly to Hades, and tugged him down to whisper something long and involved in his ear. Hades flushed, and a smile tugged at his lips as he listened. \"Perhaps,\" he murmured to her. \"That would be... intriguing.\" Persephone laughed. \"You three can go,\" she said to Dionysus and Ariadne and Semele. \"Just... don't come back.\" \"I think we can manage that,\" Dionysus murmured, and together the three of them left the Underworld.",
    "sentences": [
      "Ariadne doesn't believe in love at first sight, any more.",
      "She used to.",
      "It was, or so she told herself, the reason for helping Theseus defeat her father's minotaur.",
      "He had been so strong, so glorious, so full of confidence in himself; and Ariadne, smitten, had wanted to do anything for him.",
      "Her interpretation of 'anything' had willingly included sailing off with him.",
      "It hadn't included being waking up to find herself entirely abandoned.",
      "Naxos was a beautiful island but it was still an island, and it wasn't home.",
      "After most of a day of searching for Theseus, without any luck aside from a shepherd boy's report of a ship much like his sailing away, she told the ocean precisely what she thought of Theseus, his parentage, and love in general, and vowed that she would never love again.",
      "That promise lasted approximately one month three days three hours and twenty-six minutes.",
      "# \"I love you,\" Dionysus said.",
      "\"Come away with me.\"",
      "He had wonderfully expressive eyes, and a graceful figure, and Ariadne reminded herself that good looks aren't everything.",
      "\"You don't know me,\" she pointed out stubbornly.",
      "\"I know everything I need to.\"",
      "He smiled, and held out a goblet full of a dark heady-smelling liquid.",
      "\"Here; drink.\"",
      "\"You know nothing,\" she said, but took the goblet and sniffed cautiously.",
      "\"What is this?\"",
      "\"I know that you are mortal but with beauty worthy of a god; and I know that you hold yourself as one used to royal courts but are dressed as a commoner--\" \"It's more comfortable,\" she pointed out, looking down at what she was wearing.",
      "\"--and I know that you are thirsty.",
      "Drink,\" he added, using one elegant figure to nudge the goblet towards her mouth.",
      "\"I promise you no harm will come.\"",
      "\"I'm sure you say that to all the girls,\" Ariadne muttered, but she took a sip anyway.",
      "It was glorious.",
      "She said nothing, but his face lit up with a delighted smile.",
      "\"Is there more?\" she asked when she had finished; at his nod, she commanded, \"Serve it.\"",
      "\"As you wish,\" he said softly, and poured more, and smiled.",
      "# In the time she had spent with Theseus, they had had relations a few times, and while he was not the worst lover imaginable, he was not the best either.",
      "It was not uncommon for him to take his pleasure and then sleep, leaving Ariadne restless and unsated.",
      "Such was the way of men, or so she had come to believe.",
      "But the first time she made love with Dionysus -- both of them sober enough but flushed with giddy delight, warm skin a lovely contrast with the gentle night breeze, the stars bright and clear like Dionysus' eyes -- it was a completely different experience.",
      "He was attentive to her, and gentle without being meek, with all the patient endurance of a long-distance runner; and when dawn came creeping across the sky, she kissed him and settled into his embrace and murmured drowsily, \"Don't ever leave me.\"",
      "\"I promise,\" he said.",
      "She woke later in his arms, and decided that perhaps there was something to this love thing after all.",
      "# There came a time when Ariadne died, as mortals do, and went to the Underworld.",
      "She grew listless, unable to find peace without Dionysus.",
      "\"We all miss the sunlight,\" one woman told her, \"but you grow accustomed to this place in time.\"",
      "\"It's not the world I miss,\" Ariadne said irritably, \"it is my husband.\"",
      "\"He will come here eventually,\" said the woman, who introduced herself as Semele.",
      "\"Have faith.\"",
      "But Ariadne knew that he would not, and said as much, \"for he is the son of Zeus, and the children of gods do not die.\"",
      "Semele grimaced.",
      "\"The consorts of gods do,\" she said with surprising venom.",
      "But then she settled herself next to Ariadne and said, \"Tell me of him.\"",
      "So she did.",
      "She spoke of all the things she loved about him; of all the little annoyances that she missed; of all the ways that he made her smile, made her cry, made her laugh, made her rage.",
      "Semele dried the tears off of Ariadne's face when she was done.",
      "\"That is the true measure of love,\" she said.",
      "\"Who you want to live for is a part of it.",
      "Who you can't bear to spend eternity without, though?",
      "That is a stronger sign.\"",
      "# But it turned out that Dionysus did come, walking into Hades' throne room as though he belonged there, flanked by white leopards.",
      "\"I have come for what is mine,\" he said as he bowed to the lord of the Underworld.",
      "\"Nothing here is yours,\" Hades said curtly.",
      "\"This realm is mine.",
      "Those who are still living do not belong here.\"",

    "text": "Light-bringing Apollo, the sun god-king, lounged on his gold throne woven with fragile bronze laurel branches in his hall of warped windows and vine writhed mirrors. The rippled glass windows opened onto the ordered gardens below of a landscape that had been entirely controlled. Geometric trees and sharp edged shrubs in the shapes of diamonds and spheres and squares lined the long reflecting pool to the limpid horizon. Sun dials in the shapes of chess pieces played their shadow games on half empty greenery boards. Gold plated fountains of nymphs played music and poured their affections into cascading pools that reached to the very edge of the sky. In the court of the sun god-king, it was rumored that the statues were old mistresses, but no one credited it. In these days of Enlightenment, no one turned into a river to escape plague-striking Apollo's love. They simply caught a ship bound for the new world and remade themselves in a new way. Old world. New world. The clock work embedded in the bronze vine mirrored wall tick-tocked, tick-tocked. Far-shooting Apollo had his seasons. Oh, yes. Seasons. A time to shine bright and a time to cast golden hours and a time to fade away into the cold, cold winter night with rain runneling down the windows like so many pythian hydras. The ceiling was the sky that ever receded into the distance. Clouds drifted there and here. Occasionally the court would disport themselves upon the clouds, but not today. Today the sky was cloudy and the restless sun did not shine. The gold clock embedded in the wall ticked the hours and the sun god-king's court tick-tock, tick-tocked to its relentless rhythm. The muse, Euterpe, played Bach's French Suite no 4 in E-flat major on the harpsichord and the rest of her quartet of nymphs followed on strings. Her sister, Terpsichore, directed the court in the steps of a gavotte. The sharply curled gentlemen in their deep blue silk frock coats embroidered with gold suns pointed their toes and stepped to the right. The high piled ladies in their wide blue silk dresses flounced in gold ribbon stepped to the left. Whether or not their toes were pointed was subject to mystery. Music-Wielding Apollo leaned back on his golden throne and idly caressed the thick dark pelt of Marsyas, which was nailed into the metal of his throne with gold tacks. It whimpered and the sun god-king in his mood whispered, \"Quiet now.\" He idly strummed upon the nerves of his throne and the pelt shivered in pleasure. Well, perhaps it was pleasure. Marsyas had been skinned and nailed to a throne for a very long time. Far-seeing Apollo, sun god-king, was so very, very, very, time infinite bored. There should be a brief interlude to explain that there was also a sun-king, who ruled the country in which bright Apollo currently held his golden court. It was why eye-searing Apollo held his court there. No other country so loved the Hellenic sun. For that matter, Sky-Father-King Zeus ran a clinic on a mountain in the Swiss Alps where he invited women suffering from hysteria to come for a cure. The cure was his phallus thrust with exceptional vigor into their hysteria. There was also an attached orphanage accepting donations. Hera, well, she administered a great many sulfur water enemas. All of this was a prelude. Beyond the garden, beyond the very controlled horizon, in the wild vineyards of the massive central mountain range, wine-rearing Dionysus sprawled in the soft, wet mud. Vines spread from his fingers. Vines spread from his toes. There were vines tied oh so tenderly to trellises. Vines spread out to get the best yield. Vines that sprawled over ridges and yielded hearty grapes on terraces of earth. Pleasure-seeking Dionysus rubbed his bare ass into the sucking soil and thrust his phallus at the sky. The sky gave him no pleasure, which was fickle of the sky, but there it was. Goat-slaying Dionysus was bored. Bored. Bored. Bored. Random number. Bored. Now when flame-pricking Apollo was bored, a nymph became a gold plated fountain pouring her desire by the amphora into a limpid reflecting pool. Or there was a somewhat inevitable musical contest where the satyr ended up nailed to a throne and fondled with long idle fingers as the mood struck. Now when release-seeking Dionysus was bored, his Maenads rolled ripely naked in rich red wine and ripped off the heads of some poor fool that came upon them. Or there was that somewhat inevitable attempt to head off the insanity, which resulted in a mad ivy clad king hacking at his kinsmen. Suffice to say order-wielding Apollo in his clock work court of hours and seasons and years suffered from ennui. Suffice to say, chaos-creating Dionysus in his fields and vines and drunken debauch suffered from the same. In his bier, ripe Dionysus idly stroked himself. He licked his wine wet lips and he snapped his fingers. The Maenads' eyes lit up. Their nostrils flared. They ran over the fields. They smashed through the geometric hedges. Calliope smacked a Maenad, nameless in her madness, with a stone tablet. Erato held her arms wide and grappled for affection. She wrote a poem as she struggled. Clio, who knew the history of how these sorts of things went, ran for the armory put on some Hephaestian plate for her battle. She held the library against the Maenads, giggled and chortled and reached with ripping hands. Polyhmnia would have gone down quietly under the mass of them, but that Clio flung her bodily into the library and yelled, \"Have a care, sister, and grab that pike from the wall.\" Eutuerpe spun her flute with one hand and beckoned to a Maenad with the other. \"Come, on. I've a song to sing.\" The song she spun was something like a flute to the head. It was a pretty melody and Terpischore danced to it with many a high kick and spin. She called out, \"Sister, I love your rhythms.\" Melpomene and Thalia hurried the rest of the court up stairs while their sisters fought the oncoming horde. Someone had to think of the children. They put on a play in the upper parlor, while Maenads thumped with pruning sheers and axes against the heavy oak door. Urania stood outside that door. She was a little giddy herself with her string of astronomical boy toys. She swung a golden metal globe at a Maenad. \"Have you heard of Tycho Brae?\" Thump. \"He had a metal nose.\" Thump. \"He proved that comets were not atmospheric phenomena.\" She spun a compass in her other hand. \"Would you like another?\" The oncoming Maenad indicated the she would like another by screaming and running forward along the long silk papered wall, which suffered sadly that day. But when all was said and done, Urania had a lot of other to give. The skies were after all, in those days of Enlightenment, ever expanding. Arrow-darting Apollo on his throne moved his middle finger in a figure eight pattern on the fur pelt nailed to his golden throne. It whimpered as he rhythmically thrust into the fur to the sound of Urania's thumps. Mad-eyed Dionysus stroked his own thighs and slid from the soft slick mud. He stepped through the holes that the Maenads had made in the controlled boxed hedges. He saw a sundial chess knight on a lonely garden chess board. Future-changing Dionysus swept the back of his hand along the long jaw of the hedge. Vines twined through the horse's mouth like a tether. Sunflowers grew from the knight's eyes. Sky-seeing Apollo, god-king, stepped from his throne. Where his feet struck the blond wood floor, gold leaf spread in a spiral pattern. His supple fingers moved softly in the air as if stroking the long nerves of a lyre. Time-keeping Apollo pushed open his windows. He left behind his mirrors. He stood in the garden and blazed at revelrous Dionysus, who yielded. The earth of the gardens baked hard in the sudden heat. The nymph fountains turned their backs on the palace and hid their faces. The water in the reflecting pool steamed. The Maenads and the Muses paused in their battle and sat at the windows to watch. Thalia ordered refreshments, but at a look from Melpomene ordered tea rather than wine. In the garden, time-turning Dionysus passed each of the chess piece sundials. Wild vines covered them. It could be said that there was no time. They came to stand together in the pleasure garden of the sun. Bright-eyed Apollo ran his musician's fingers along wine-dark Dionysus' mud coated flanks until his hands were fairly slicked in mud. Pleasure-seeking Dionysus shouted, \"Fuck Enlightenment.\" He bit music-scented Apollo's neck and the god-king bled red and hot into his mouth. Bleeding Apollo breathed in sharply at the wound. He wrapped his burning hands around theater-delighting Dionysus' face and wrenched his grinding teeth from his neck. They gazed into one anothers eyes. Madness-inducing Dionysus whispered, \"Turn anyone into a plant lately.\" Lyre-plucking Apollo ran a finger along lips wet with his own blood and whispered, \"Not lately.\" He bent to taste his own blood on those red lips. They ground teeth and explored darkness with their tongues. They spoke an entire language that way. They bruised each other with their kissing. Tender-vined Dionysus fell back onto the green grass and pulled blazing Apollo with him. Flesh-burning Apollo's silk and embroidered clothes crisped to black and impatient hands brushed the char away. They rolled in the green grass and painted themselves with stains. The golden fountains turned to look and watered them wet with their spray. Water beaded on muddy skin until it was brushed away with a mouth that kissed and bit, twisting flesh between teeth to mark the place as already traveled. Here has been a monster. Bright-eyed Apollo steamed under the fountains spray and sea-fairing Dionysus bowed his back and spread wide his legs. Rising Apollo sharply thrust a mud wet finger into yielding Dionysus, who cried out. \"Fuck. More.\" Brilliant Apollo bunched his fingers into a point and shoved them into earth-pressed Dionysus, who gasped, \"More.\" Spring-warming Apollo turned his hand left to right as it may be seen that the sun crosses the warming earth. Vines wrapped around him and pulled them down to the fountain wet earth. He seeking a certain spot. He knew he'd found it when voice-ripping Dionysus wept and pleaded, \"Yes.\" Bleeding from a dozen places on his skin, bright-eyed Apollo pulled his mud slick fingers out of madness-desiring Dionysus. He shoved tender-vined Dionysus' legs back until he was half bent on himself. Seeking Apollo slid his hands down mysterious Dionysus flanks and slicked his own phallus in thick black mud. Root-seeking Dionysus cried out. \"More.\" Summer-sweet Apollo brushed the tip of his phallus against mad Dionysus' entry as vines wrapped around ankles and wrists. The sun god-king burned them away and thrust forward. Wild Dionysus cried out. \"Yes.\" Health-bringing Apollo pushed him back farther, until only androgynous Dionysus' shoulders touched the ground and all that held him in place was the clockwork hard thrust of burning Apollo's hips. Harsh and hot and burning to dry the fountains and kill the carefully tended grass. Sense-deafening Dionysus cried out. He scratched the back of the sun god-king, whose blood dripped down in golden bubbles. Once-dismembered Dionysus stroked his own phallus with mud slick fingers. He pulled every time the sun slammed into the bright pleasure spot inside him, half bent on the earth. When they were spent, spring-bright Apollo turned him over onto his knees and began again until vision-mad Dionysus could not tell where his flesh began and bright-blazing Apollo ended. It went on for the passage of days. Weeks. A season as the vines on which they lay grew heavy and ripe. It ended, as these affairs do, in winter. Fast furious thrusts gave way to slowly languorous pushes. Some days they lay spooned hip to hip, hardly moving in the hot syrup of air. Slow spooning gave way to idle caresses in the shortening days. Season-deep Dionysus curled on himself. Season-weary Apollo climbed away and went to his royal bath to be gently cleaned by nervous nymphs with cotton cloths. Over the dull dreary winter, seeking Dionysus turned himself over and over. He laughed. He giggled. It went to his head. In his season, he polyped a baby oak cask of champagne. Celebrate pleasure. Pure pleasure. It's the reason why champagne exists. Light-bringing Apollo, the sun god-king, lounged on his gold throne woven with fragile bronze laurel branches in his hall of warped windows and vine writhed mirrors. Far-seeing Apollo, sun god-king, was so very, very, very, time infinite bored. Pleasure-seeking Dionysus rubbed into the sucking soil and thrust at the sky.

    "text": "Mother used to say that my brother and I were born from an egg. My brother was the kind of kid who stopped eating eggs after he heard that, even if he knew they came from chickens or clones. Mother laughed at him out the corner of her mouth for almost a month. Castor would say, completely seriously, that he didn't want to eat our new baby brother-or-sister. I think he knew Mother was pregnant again before she did. I remember she apologized to Castor by buying him his very first hoverbike, a whole year before I got mine and two years before he could legally drive it. I didn't mind, though. Castor wouldn't get caught, and I was never as good at riding. Even after I learned I only got on that bike to lose races to him. My brother and I were born under different stars. I used to think this was just Mother's euphemistic way of explaining that we bled different colors and slept different hours and were good at different things. When I grew up, I learned how literally she meant it, but she was probably right not to explain it to us. After all, if you go through fifteen years saying we're brothers, we're brothers, stop staring at us in the kinema or the complex and looking at mother like she's some kind of freak, you stay brothers no matter what you look like. And I never questioned it, because I knew how much we both looked like Mother. I sometimes wonder if it would have been the same if my father hadn't been humanoid at the time, but there's no point wondering. He is what he is and I am what I am. Castor bleeds mostly-red as long as we're in a place with enough oxygen. He has a lithe thin body and ten fingers, ten toes, and dark skin all over except for the palms of his hands. I bleed mostly-whitish-gold no matter where we are, have ten fingers but only eight toes, and I'm not as dark as he and mother. But once when we were eleven, in art class at school, I took an old-fashioned photograph, the kind that's only two-dimensional, and toggled with the settings so that we were the same color, somewhere in between. It didn't make us look any more like brothers to me, since I knew, but the teacher said she understood what I was trying to do and shared it with the whole class. Castor said it was embarrassing. And it didn't work, but it didn't matter. Our father, as opposed to my father, was our city-state's representative in the Andromeda Council. He wasn't that when we were born--he just ran a shipping fleet--but he ran twice, once when Castor and I were twelve and again when we were fourteen, and the second time it worked. Twelve isn't too young to see the trikameras on you, and it's definitely not too young to stop the reporters from asking feed-selling questions. They said our living room was too crowded for the trikameras so they sat us in the yard instead, arranged like a portrait in our best suits, with Helen and Cly in their best dresses, and Mother and Father holding on to our shoulders when they weren't talking with their hands. They asked my father questions about his trade policies and what he would do if elected and things I mostly understood, and asked mother about her dancing and her time on Olympus. She didn't seem to love talking about it, but she smiled like her teeth had been greased. \"We're all for favorable relations with the Olympians,\" my father said, like he was trying to steer the eyes of the cameras back toward him. \"It's by their sufferance we came here, and even if we could sustain ourselves on our own, their cooperation would make it easier for us, the same way ours makes it easier for them.\" The next thing the anchorperson said felt like it was more than halfway meant for me, which is probably why I remember it as acutely as I do. \"And we all know how much you've cooperated with the Olympians,\" the reporter said. I was, after all, proof. Mother never cried on trikamera, when she wasn't dancing. She always waited until she knew they were gone. Castor was afraid of heights. Helen and I are the only ones who knew. We had bunk-beds for fifteen years, and he always took the bottom. His voice always drifted up at me, and I always hung over the edge to catch it. \"Which one of us is the one with the different father?\" he asked me, not that night but one night that week, long after he should have been asleep and I should have been pretending. \"I'm pretty sure it's me,\" I said. \"Father's like you.\" \"No he isn't,\" Castor said. \"He's smart.\" \"I meant his body.\" \"His body's not like mine either. He's big across the shoulders and his eyes are black.\" \"Mother's eyes are your color.\" \"I'm the different one, Pollux. Not you. If anyone's different it's me, okay? You belong here and that's that.\" I couldn't see him from where I was, just the amorphous lump under blankets I never had to use. He'd turned his face into the pillow and hidden himself almost completely away in the dark. I probably should have gone down to him that night instead of waiting for the night I eventually did. It might have made him happier. But I knew he was wrong, so I just said nothing, and waited in bed for the suns to come up. The second time our father ran for election, as I said, it worked. Now that I'm older I know he was right about why, and there were some complex interplanetary issues that made his stance on Olympus more prudent, and besides, Troia, but at the time I thought it was because they didn't interview the family. Mother took the four of us on tour with her for the entire month before the election, and when we came back, father was a Senator. \"Gods, you've grown,\" he said to me. \"We were closer to the suns on Kreta,\" my mother explained. That night, I stood next to Castor in front of a mirror. I was taller than him by a hand already, and that distance would never shrink, no matter how much he tried to catch up. I grew tall and broad, and Castor just grew tall. By the time we were sixteen, I was boxing middleweight, and Castor was racing laps around Sparta, turning his tricked-out bike on coin-thin turns that scared the life out of me, playing chicken with the soldiers in their APCs. Sometimes they crashed. He only did once, the way that cost him that bike and maybe one scar but nothing else of his. I was always taller than he, always paler, even the scars. I remember after one race, Jason Herakoi, who was still a captain back then, climbed out of his dented APC and laughed his golden head off, and tackled my brother off his bike like he was the only thing that could have made him obey the law of gravity. I remember I watched them tussle, their protective gear shining in the light of the bike and what was left of the suns. I remember how they looked, how they sounded, and in hindsight I probably shouldn't have charged down there and punched Jason in the face. I broke his nose. He bled red like Castor. I was jealous. I met my father, not our father, the summer Castor and I turned seventeen. Helen and Cly were almost twelve, and you'd think they would be harder to keep apart than Castor and I, but Castor's the one who pitched a fit about it and I couldn't help but agree with him. \"Macedonia is dangerous,\" our father (not my father) said. \"They why send Helen?\" \"Because she has to go, and Pollux can take care of her.\" \"Yeah,\" Castor said, \"and who'll take care of him? That's my job.\" \"Pollux can take care of himself.\" I disagreed, but not aloud. I still disagree. Our father said, \"You're coming with me to the garrison this week.\" \"Like hell,\" Castor said, which started another fight entirely, but that didn't stop me and Helen from going to Macedonia with Mother. It was the first, and almost the only, time that Castor and I had been apart. I would say the Olympians aren't like us, but I'm like them, so it's wrong. What I mean to say is that the Olympians aren't like the citizens, which is truer, and still true even as it applies to me. My father, Zeus, is a nuclear converter. That's not his job; that's what he is. He takes whatever form he likes when he's dealing with the citizens, but the fact remains that he feeds on light and gives off the energy that powers this entire solar system. He could decide not to help us at any time. That's why my mother didn't say no. It's a hard thing to find out when you're sixteen. It'd be a hard thing to find out anytime, but I honestly think sixteen's worse. When my father offered his hand for me to shake, and complimented me, called me strong and said I was his spitting image and asked to test my grip, like a doctor does to a baby, I panicked. His skin didn't burn me, but a static charge rippled through my shoulders and down my spine, and Zeus just laughed like it was some kind of prank. He said that Helen was the most beautiful girl he'd ever seen and that I would surely make him proud. He asked me about school, and boxing, and the army. He didn't mention Castor or Cly at all. Helen decided to stay with him for a little while. I declined. When I came home, I was another three inches taller than Castor. I know because when I lay down with him in his bed, our hips didn't align, and we had to keep them moving if we wanted to touch. His heart beat much faster than mine. His pulse raced like he did. So did his hands. I didn't sleep in my own bed that night, or any other night after that. On Sparta, military service is compulsory. When Castor and I turned eighteen, we joined, and when Jason Herakoi deserted, we deserted with him. Our father was furious (not in the least because it meant he didn't get re-elected), and our mother was terrified, but I know that if I didn't go with Castor, I'd never forgive myself. Jason was never a good influence. Hell, Jason was never a good person in the strictest sense of the word. If he couldn't fight it, fuck it, or overclock it, Jason wanted nothing to do with it. But he loved Castor, so I put up with him, and he was one of the only people in my brother's circle who never looked at me as an outsider. I later, much later, found out that Jason was like me, and he knew, and his full-citizen twin had been killed when they were just children. It's probably a testimony to Jason's charisma that I can look back on the Argo and be completely unrepentant. I mean, it's legendary, that ship, and we're legendary with it, even as two lesser names on a criminal record. It's also a really good thing that the Spartan military will take you back after you desert. At this point, they almost expect it, and besides, when we came back, the army needed all the men it could get. Idas and Lynceus were natural brothers, with the same father and mother, and it showed. Their father, Leucippus, had beaten our father in the last election, and oh, did Idas want us to know it. (Lynceus, for his part, didn't have a thought of his own in his head.) Idas was almost as big as I was, and that's without any Olympian influence, but he knew how to throw his weight around--literally, when he drove his machines around the cities, and right past our windows, the engines humming sharp enough to melt glass. Castor would seethe. I'd hold him down in bed. Sometimes it helped. I'll admit we didn't make the best case for ourselves, what with the Argo and serving our tour. But Idas didn't have to follow us all the way to Arcadia just to gloat, and he didn't have to rig his hoverbike with twin engines like Castor's, and he really didn't have to deface our barracks with graffiti made out of manure. But calling me a lightsucker where Castor could hear? That was just plain stupid. It really did unfold like in the kinema, you, me, dawn, we ride until we can't, and this time I didn't try to stop him. Then Idas named the place, the Mainalon, and I wished to the gods that I'd said something. \"He's trying to kill you,\" I said. Castor shrugged. \"Let him try. He won't.\" \"You don't know that mountain,\" I said. \"He does. He'll use it.\" \"It still won't work.\" \"You don't know that either.\" \"Maybe I do,\" he said. \"Maybe I know things. Maybe I know more than I should, the way you shine more than you should. Maybe I got something from my father that you didn't get from yours.\" \"He's a citizen.\" \"How can you tell? What if he's not? What if Mother slept with another something-else like yours and what if me and Cly aren't Tyndareus's at all? What if I really am just as special as you? Then Idas'll choke on dirt tomorrow no matter what he thinks he's got in store for me.\" They were confident words. They were fighting words. But I was stretched out alongside him, naked and near enough to feel his pulse, and it was as fast as a rabbit's or a rat's, like his heart was backed into a corner. I wondered, then, if Castor was still afraid of heights. I still don't know. They didn't take seconds, but me and Lynceus might as well have been hostages, trapped on the spot. The suns crept over the mountains and Castor and Idas raced in and out of shadows, skirting clifftops and shedding stone down the edges. They moved too fast to follow with sights or tracers, so all I could to was watch the glow of their bikes weave in and out of the crags from half a mile away, and soon enough the suns were too bright for me to see the glow. They moved at breakneck speed, around and around the mountain, and wound back to us, side by side, the suns at their backs and no sign of stopping. It only became clear that Idas was charging straight for me when I saw his helmet glint like a mad, gleaming smile. I think Castor knew about half a second before. That close, the engine of a hoverbike doesn't sound like a hum; it's more like the sound a drill makes receding from the hole it's just carved. I felt it more than heard it, and the lightfield of Castor's bike, not Idas's, clipped my shoulder when they collided. The bikes tumbled through the air, hurtled to the stone, and exploded. Castor didn't bleed at all. He immolated. When Lynceus came at me, blaming me for what happened of his brother, I beat him to death. It was as simple as that. He bled red, and I didn't care, and I kept hitting him after he was dead, until my fists made it past his bones to the rotten red earth. Dawn turned to morning, and the suns blared down on me, caked the blood and dirt and ashes onto my skin. When it glinted off the wreckage of the bikes, I tore through that instead of Lynceus, ripped apart the engines and the hulls for any part of Castor I could touch. His protective gear had melted onto the remains of his skin, the burnt black and the charred fabric indistinguishable. His face was an unrecognizable wreck beneath the mask of his helmet. The suns burned into my shoulders and out through my eyes and hands. I felt the same awful frisson that I'd coursed when my father touched me, and I heard his laughter. I let it burn me too. I held Castor against me, and I let everything around us burn. We look more similar now, Castor and I. He's still darker, but I don't shine as much. He's still shorter, but he's almost as broad as I am now, from weeks of physical therapy and the habits that gave him, and besides, I'm not as strong as I was. I still only have eight toes, but he only has eight of his fingers, so things have evened out. He doesn't need all of them to ride, and he can ride again, and that's what matters. We both live longer than we should. We both feed on the suns. He doesn't sleep as much as he used to, and I sleep more. And someday, we will die, but we will die together. The next time I went to see my father, I told him what happened. He said it lessened me, made me less Olympian. I asked if that meant, if I was less, if Castor was more.",

      "When Castor and I turned eighteen, we joined, and when Jason Herakoi deserted, we deserted with him.",
      "Our father was furious (not in the least because it meant he didn't get re-elected), and our mother was terrified, but I know that if I didn't go with Castor, I'd never forgive myself.",
      "Jason was never a good influence.",
      "Hell, Jason was never a good person in the strictest sense of the word.",
      "If he couldn't fight it, fuck it, or overclock it, Jason wanted nothing to do with it.",
      "But he loved Castor, so I put up with him, and he was one of the only people in my brother's circle who never looked at me as an outsider.",
      "I later, much later, found out that Jason was like me, and he knew, and his full-citizen twin had been killed when they were just children.",
      "It's probably a testimony to Jason's charisma that I can look back on the Argo and be completely unrepentant.",
      "I mean, it's legendary, that ship, and we're legendary with it, even as two lesser names on a criminal record.",
      "It's also a really good thing that the Spartan military will take you back after you desert.",
      "At this point, they almost expect it, and besides, when we came back, the army needed all the men it could get.",
      "Idas and Lynceus were natural brothers, with the same father and mother, and it showed.",
      "Their father, Leucippus, had beaten our father in the last election, and oh, did Idas want us to know it.",
      "(Lynceus, for his part, didn't have a thought of his own in his head.)",
      "Idas was almost as big as I was, and that's without any Olympian influence, but he knew how to throw his weight around--literally, when he drove his machines around the cities, and right past our windows, the engines humming sharp enough to melt glass.",
      "Castor would seethe.",
      "I'd hold him down in bed.",
      "Sometimes it helped.",
      "I'll admit we didn't make the best case for ourselves, what with the Argo and serving our tour.",
      "But Idas didn't have to follow us all the way to Arcadia just to gloat, and he didn't have to rig his hoverbike with twin engines like Castor's, and he really didn't have to deface our barracks with graffiti made out of manure.",
      "But calling me a lightsucker where Castor could hear?",
      "That was just plain stupid.",
      "It really did unfold like in the kinema, you, me, dawn, we ride until we can't, and this time I didn't try to stop him.",
      "Then Idas named the place, the Mainalon, and I wished to the gods that I'd said something.",
      "\"He's trying to kill you,\" I said.",
      "Castor shrugged.",
      "\"Let him try.",
      "He won't.\"",
      "\"You don't know that mountain,\" I said.",
      "\"He does.",
      "He'll use it.\"",
      "\"It still won't work.\"",
      "\"You don't know that either.\"",
      "\"Maybe I do,\" he said.",
      "\"Maybe I know things.",
      "Maybe I know more than I should, the way you shine more than you should.",
      "Maybe I got something from my father that you didn't get from yours.\"",
      "\"He's a citizen.\"",
      "\"How can you tell?",
      "What if he's not?",
      "What if Mother slept with another something-else like yours and what if me and Cly aren't Tyndareus's at all?",
      "What if I really am just as special as you?",
      "Then Idas'll choke on dirt tomorrow no matter what he thinks he's got in store for me.\"",
      "They were confident words.",
      "They were fighting words.",
      "But I was stretched out alongside him, naked and near enough to feel his pulse, and it was as fast as a rabbit's or a rat's, like his heart was backed into a corner.",
      "I wondered, then, if Castor was still afraid of heights.",
      "I still don't know.",
      "They didn't take seconds, but me and Lynceus might as well have been hostages, trapped on the spot.",
      "The suns crept over the mountains and Castor and Idas raced in and out of shadows, skirting clifftops and shedding stone down the edges.",
      "They moved too fast to follow with sights or tracers, so all I could to was watch the glow of their bikes weave in and out of the crags from half a mile away, and soon enough the suns were too bright for me to see the glow.",
      "They moved at breakneck speed, around and around the mountain, and wound back to us, side by side, the suns at their backs and no sign of stopping.",
      "It only became clear that Idas was charging straight for me when I saw his helmet glint like a mad, gleaming smile.",
      "I think Castor knew about half a second before.",
      "That close, the engine of a hoverbike doesn't sound like a hum; it's more like the sound a drill makes receding from the hole it's just carved.",
      "I felt it more than heard it, and the lightfield of Castor's bike, not Idas's, clipped my shoulder when they collided.",
      "The bikes tumbled through the air, hurtled to the stone, and exploded.",
      "Castor didn't bleed at all.",
      "He immolated.",
      "When Lynceus came at me, blaming me for what happened of his brother, I beat him to death.",
      "It was as simple as that.",
      "He bled red, and I didn't care, and I kept hitting him after he was dead, until my fists made it past his bones to the rotten red earth.",
      "Dawn turned to morning, and the suns blared down on me, caked the blood and dirt and ashes onto my skin.",
      "When it glinted off the wreckage of the bikes, I tore through that instead of Lynceus, ripped apart the engines and the hulls for any part of Castor I could touch.",
      "His protective gear had melted onto the remains of his skin, the burnt black and the charred fabric indistinguishable.",
      "His face was an unrecognizable wreck beneath the mask of his helmet.",
      "The suns burned into my shoulders and out through my eyes and hands.",
      "I felt the same awful frisson that I'd coursed when my father touched me, and I heard his laughter.",
      "I let it burn me too.",
      "I held Castor against me, and I let everything around us burn.",
      "We look more similar now, Castor and I. He's still darker, but I don't shine as much.",
      "He's still shorter, but he's almost as broad as I am now, from weeks of physical therapy and the habits that gave him, and besides, I'm not as strong as I was.",
      "I still only have eight toes, but he only has eight of his fingers, so things have evened out.",
      "He doesn't need all of them to ride, and he can ride again, and that's what matters.",
      "We both live longer than we should.",
      "We both feed on the suns.",
      "He doesn't sleep as much as he used to, and I sleep more.",
      "And someday, we will die, but we will die together.",
      "The next time I went to see my father, I told him what happened.",
      "He said it lessened me, made me less Olympian.",
      "I asked if that meant, if I was less, if Castor was more."

    "text": "The girl stood alone on the clifftop, the wind tangling her hair and tugging at her shawl. She looked down at the rocks below. She wondered how it had come to this. \"The child shall marry a monster.\" It was the soothsayer's words that had changed her life forever. She had always been a good-looking child, but it was as she approached womanhood that she began to learn that men from far and wide would not only praise her looks as beyond compare, but would do so honestly and truly, not just because of her father's power. Princes from across the land clamoured for her hand, calling her Helen reborn. But Psyche did not want a thousand devoted princes. She definitely did not want the spiteful glares of every woman she met, even her own beloved sister, whose wealthy husband gazed at her unsettlingly. No, all Psyche had ever wanted was to fall in love, and be loved in return. So she had begged her father not to give her hand to the richest suitor, or the strongest - although determining one such man from so many would have posed its own challenges - but rather to consult the oracle on her fated husband, hoping that the gods might smile on her and grant her what she desired. But the gods could be cruel as well as kind. \"A terrible monster, winged and fearsome. Yay, feared even among the gods themselves!\" Her father's expression was grave. \"What must be done?\" \"Take the girl to the mountaintop, to await her wedding.\" Her father nodded, and turned away from the oracle. \"Father - I -\" She reached out to take his hand, but he pulled away, and would not look at her. That, more than anything, cut to her very soul. She understood why. She was cursed now. No man could stand against the power of fate, not even a king. She was already dead. She just hadn't stopped breathing yet. Her father strode out of the hall, and she hurried after him. \"Dress her for a wedding, then leave her atop the mountain,\" he spat at one of the guards. \"Father, wait! I -\" But he did not look back. She would never see his face again. She had not struggled on the way up the mountain, for what use was there in fighting the will of the gods? She had stood proudly, chin up, as the guards had left her to her fate, and she had waited until they were out of sight to break down, and cry out her fears until she thought she would drown in them. But no beast arrived, and gradually, the sky grew dark. She had lain her head on the ground and hoped to never wake. She had woken. It had taken her a long minute to realise that she was still alive, for she did not wake on the mountaintop. She found herself in a garden, a beautiful one, filled with more plants that she had words to describe - and, try as she might, she could not recall how she had arrived there. Standing, she discovered herself to be close by a house, a humbly sized abode, but one so richly embellished she was instantly certain that she had never seen it, or its like, before. Disorientated, and half-wondering if she dreamt, she had made her way inside. \"Psyche!\" The voice, barely more than a whisper over her shoulder, had surprised her, sending her stumbling as she spun to seek its source. \"Don't be afraid!\" The voice came from behind her again, even though she no longer faced the same way. This time, she steadied herself before turning to look. She could see no person, not anywhere in sight. \"This is your home now!\" The third time, Psyche was unsurprised that the voice once again seemed to whisper directly in her ear, although that didn't stop her from flinching slightly. She had heard tales of wind spirits who seemed to move with the ears that listened to them. Whatever this strange place she had wondered into was, it was beyond the world of mortal explanations. She had entered the lands of myth. \"There's a bath waiting for you! Look upstairs!\" She followed the invisible spirit's instructions to the letter that first day, terrified that disobedience would invoke some punishment, but it led her only in the steps of a peaceful life: bathing, and eating, and exploring the house and its beautiful gardens, until the time came for her to undress and lay down her head in the comfort of her new bedroom. \"Good night, Psyche!\" That was the first time she heard a spirit laugh. The sound was as pure and gleeful as a child at play. She wondered what was so entertaining. It was only when her eyelids finally drifted shut that she found out. \"Hello, Psyche.\" The voice made her jump. This was not the airy, childlike tones of the spirit, but the voice of a man, and as she twisted in the sheets, her eyes strained out a silhouette in the darkness. The stranger took a hold of her hand, and she tried not to shiver. She wanted to scream, or cry out, but there was no-one here to hear her. \"Do you like my house?\" \"Y- yes,\" she stuttered. The man chuckled, a gentle, silky sound. \"Don't be afraid,\" he told her. \"I will not hurt you. I am your husband, Psyche.\" She gasped, and pulled away. \"What is it?\" She didn't want to answer, but she felt she had to. \"They told me I would marry a monster,\" she said quietly. \"Winged, and feared by the gods themselves.\" Her husband laughed, long and hard. \"No wonder you are afraid! That... would be a very unusual way of describing me. Although some would claim it was accurate.\" She shook involuntarily at the images in her head. In the utter darkness, it was too easy to imagine what could be lying next to her. As if he had heard her thoughts, the stranger took her hand again, touching her fingertips against his face. \"Feel,\" he told her, his jaw shifting under her touch. \"I am no monster, Psyche.\" \"You are no man.\" The words slipped out before she realised she had said them. \"No.\" His chuckle created strange vibrations in his expression. \"I am afraid I cannot tell you what I am, Psyche, and nor can I show you my face. But know that I love you, and I have no wish to cause you harm.\" She ran her hand down his neck, feeling out the trace of his arm and his chest. She couldn't believe what had happened. This time yesterday, she had expected to die, and now - The kiss took her by surprise. She was more surprised to find herself returning it. It was everything she had ever wanted, and more. Those glorious, sun-filled days had seemed to last an eternity. Each day, she tended the gardens, or spoke idly with the spirits, and each night - each night, she touched the heavens. Once or twice, she caught herself wondering if it was truly real - if she still lay on the mountain-top, dreaming, or if she had passed unknowing into Elysium - but then the touch of his skin on hers would bring her shivering back to reality, knowing that neither afterlife nor imagining could possibly make her feel so alive. And then - And then she had ruined it all. \"Please,\" she had begged. \"I am so happy. My father believes me dead. Let me tell him it is not so.\" \"You cannot leave this place,\" he had warned her. \"It is not safe for you.\" \"My sister,\" she had pleaded. \"Bring her here. She will carry my message.\" She had felt his muscles shift beneath her hand, and known he was smiling. \"So it will be.\" Her sister had arrived the next day, dazed at first, but soon embracing her like they had never quarrelled. Together, they whiled away the day, until it nearly came time for her sister to depart. \"I am so glad to see you safe, even if your husband is a monster.\" \"He's no monster!\" Psyche had laughed. He was so many things - her husband, her lover, her world - but nothing of him was monstrous. \"The oracle does not lie,\" her sister had reminded. \"And have you ever seen his face?\" \"I do not need to.\" Psyche honestly believed it to be true. She knew every inch of him. \"Then how do you know he is not the monster which stalks our father's kingdom, killing all it finds?\" Psyche had gasped. \"Is our father alright?\" \"For now,\" her sister replied darkly. \"But you should take care.\" Take care... And thus the seeds of doubt were sown. She had resisted for days, perhaps a month. But... The thought of it ate at her. She wondered: how bad could it truly be? She wondered: what was the worst that could happen? She wondered: what would she see? Until one night, her resolve crumbled, and she lit the candle beside the bed. She had never seen anything so beautiful, not even when his eyes opened and filled with fear. \"Run.\" She had run, because he had asked and she could not help but obey him. She had run as the house had tumbled down around her, as the garden had crumbled into dust, as the ground itself quaked beneath her feet. No-one was by her side, and no-one slower than she could possibly have survived. She ran even as she wept. She had run down the mountainside, across the fields, and into the town, until some sudden familiarity had brought her to a halt. This was her father's kingdom. She ran to the palace gates, hammering at the doors, begging to be let inside, but the King's daughter was dead, and to the guards she seemed a madwoman, shoeless and barely clothed. \"Please!\" she begged. \"Tell me at least that the monster has been slain?\" The guards shook their heads, and pushed her away, but she returned until eventually, one of them met her eyes. \"Ma'am, there is no monster.\" And it was only then that she realised what she had done. She had torn her life apart, demolished her home and murdered her only love - all over an unfounded fear. Her sister had told her a lie. And now - Now she stood on the clifftop, where this had all begun. She fancied she could see the blood on the rocks below. It had been so easy, taking her revenge. She would be punished for that, she knew. But she did not care. Her justice had been done. And now, there was nothing left for her. She took a deep breath, shut her eyes, and thought of him. Psyche leapt. She squeezed her eyes closed against the rushing winds of her descent, waiting for the moment that would end everything, a sharp flash of pain that would finally bring her peace - No moment came. She forced her eyes open again, squinting against the sting of the speeding air. Through her tears, she managed to fix her gaze on the stony wall of the mountainside, as stationary as it ever had been. She was not moving. But if she wasn't falling, then why was the wind so -? \"Psyche.\" The voice in her ear was both familiar and strange. It sounded old, older than she could comprehend - but beside that, it was the twin of the voice which kept her husband's house. A spirit of the air. Psyche comprehended only one thing: this spirit was stopping her fall. She began to thrash against the wind, hoping to free herself from its pull. She span in its embrace, sending herself tumbling head over heel. \"Psyche, I will not release you until you listen to me.\" \"Let me die!\" she shouted, in a voice hoarse from pain. \"I deserve it! I killed her! She was my sister and I killed her!\" \"She died by her own hand.\" \"Driven by my words!\" \"Her own hand, not yours,\" the spirit repeated. \"You told her she could take your husband for her own. Her jump blasphemed against her own marriage and her kin's. In the eyes of the gods, you bear no guilt.\" Psyche shut her eyes. \"What do I have left to live for? My husband is dead. My home is ruins. I am left with nothing.\" \"And what of the child?\" \"Child?\" Psyche gasped as her eyes flew open. She had not considered - that changed everything. Some part of him lived on. She could not bring herself to end that. Suddenly, she felt her feet touch solid rock, and the wind disappeared. She sagged to the ground, feeling weak with emotion. Her hair was tangled and her clothes dirtied, but only one question came to her lips. \"Wait!\" she called after the spirit. \"What shall I do? What shall I do for my child?\" \"Sacrifice.\" It was little more than a whisper on the wind, one she could barely believe she had truly heard, but she took it into her heart and guarded it fiercely. She would sacrifice. It was a strange city, for she had chosen to cross the mountains rather than risk returning to her father's kingdom. She had foraged for food on the road, and begged for what little she could convince her fellow travellers to part with. It was not a great amount, and even the smallest of sacrifices would leave hunger gnawing in her belly come nightfall, but she was determined. There were many temples here, one to every god she'd ever heard of and many more besides. But there was only one temple for her today. She approached the altar hesitantly, dropping her coins into the priestess's hands. \"Aphrodite,\" she pleaded. \"Keep my loves safe.\" The priestess met her eyes, but she did not speak the ritual reply. For a second, Psyche wondered if her offering would be refused. It was almost unheard of, but then she was little more than a beggar woman now... Suddenly, the priestess began to shake, her eyes rolling back in her head. Psyche knew the signs. This was another oracle, this time unasked for. She wanted to back away, to flee before the fates could further unbalance her life - but the goddess Aphrodite was talking to her, and she could do nothing but fall to her knees in reverence. \"Enter Hades...\" the otherworldly voice hissed. \"Seek Persephone's beauty... there is no other hope for you.\" The priestess dropped to the ground, and for a second, no-one moved. Then began a sudden surge forwards, as priestesses and supplicants alike sought understanding. By the time anyone turned to the girl kneeling on the floor, she was long gone. Psyche tore out of the city as fast as her legs would carry her, slowing to a walk only when she could no longer draw the breath to sprint. She found herself in an empty field. \"I shall not!\" She shouted at the sky. \"I will not seek death! Not when our child still needs me!\" She shuddered, suddenly afraid that the goddess would strike her down for this defiance. She might have welcomed the gods' punishment once, but now she had too much left to live for to want to throw her life away. Her child was worth more than a gamble on the gods' mercy. The thought almost made her laugh. Had she believed once that the gods were merciful? Perhaps her defiance was ignored because the gods listened naught to those beyond the temple walls. Entering Hades. She was truly cursed, now. Persephone's beauty was death itself... Well, Psyche had been cursed before. \"I will not enter Hades without a fight,\" she promised herself. A sudden crack echoed through the air and she froze, certain that Aphrodite would smite her for her blasphemous thoughts, but instead the ground beneath her feet began to quake and a jagged fissure burst open in the rock. Psyche gazed at it in wonder, her mind spinning with a new interpretation of Aphrodite's words. She had heard of portals to Hades before, through which the living could enter the kingdom of the underworld unharmed - but she had never thought she would see one with her own eyes. She stared into the darkness of the split rock. It was barely wide enough for her to fit through, and the ground continued to quake threateningly. It could close at any moment. If she jumped and her suspicions were wrong, she would certainly die. But if she did not jump, she might miss her one opportunity to survive the fate the oracle had cast for her. Murmuring a prayer to any god who might be listening, Psyche jumped into the darkness. She crashed heavily to the ground, too relieved to have landed at all to care about the jolt to her legs. The fall had lasted longer than she had thought possible, and it took several long, juddering breaths before she was calm enough to open her eyes. She had crumpled in a wide hallway, shimmering obsidian in eerie green torchlight. She could see no-one, but as fear began to sharpen her awareness of her surroundings, Psyche realised there was a low sound in the background - the constant whisper of a million voices reduced to the faintest itch only just above the threshold of hearing. \"Is anyone there?\" she called, her voice shaking a little. She had left the mortal realms behind her. Here, she was a trespasser, and powerless against any she was likely to encounter. \"How have you come here, as-yet-mortal?\" Psyche did not start at the voice, or even at the sudden appearance of its source, a beautiful woman dressed entirely in black who had seemed to melt out of the shadows. \"A portal opened for me,\" she answered, hastily straightening her clothes. \"A fissure in the earth. I leapt through it and landed here.\" The woman raised an eyebrow. \"But you surely knew that such a portal would lead you into Hades. Whyever did you jump?\" Psyche got to her feet, looking the woman directly in the eye. \"I am fated by oracle to enter Hades and seek Persephone's beauty,\" she informed the spirit. \"But I will not accept death.\" The woman laughed. \"Rebellion! Delightful. But there is always a way around an oracle, for those strong enough to find it.\" \"And mine is half-fulfilled.\" Psyche let herself speak proudly. \"I will survive and bear the child within me, for all that my husband is dead of my own foolish disobedience.\" \"Perhaps you may,\" the spirit smiled somewhat viciously, and Psyche shivered. \"But I can promise you this. You will not find your husband in this land.\" \"He lives?\" \"He does not dwell here yet.\" The spirit frowned. \"Tell me, mortal, what do you know of Persephone's beauty?\" Psyche burned to know more about her lost husband - lost but not yet dead? - but she did not wish to anger this spirit, and she recited what little she knew of the myth. \"Persephone has beauty beyond compare, but to lay a hand of it is the touch of death.\" The spirit smiled as though Psyche had passed a test. \"For mortals, yes. But not for me. Come.\" She turned and began to saunter down the corridor, but Psyche hesitated to follow. The spirit glanced back, and Psyche stumbled forward to the doorway she had just entered. \"This box -\" She could not possible have moved fast enough to retrieve it without Psyche seeing, but then who was to say she had not truly pulled it from thin air? - \"Contains a speck of Persephone's beauty. If you can carry it to the surface, then I believe your oracle will be completed.\" \"But - Persephone?\" Psyche asked. \"I am in her house. I cannot steal from her, especially not something so precious.\" The woman smiled. \"You have her permission.\" She was no spirit. Psyche swallowed and dropped her gaze, kneeling awkwardly. \"My lady, apologies, I -\" \"Rise, Psyche.\" The goddess pulled her to her feet, and rested a hand against her cheek. \"Courage is a rarer gift than you know. Complete this quest, and I believe Aphrodite's oracle will fall in your favour. Either way, you will get what you deserve.\" Her laugh made Psyche shudder as the hand was withdrawn, and in that moment's distraction the goddess and the corridor had vanished and she found herself on a narrow path, clutching the box tightly. She wanted to glance around to find her bearings, but she stopped herself. Tonight, she walked the path of Orpheus. This was no time to look back. The walk itself was not hard, and the weeks since the destruction of her home had toughened her. The dim light was no insurmountable obstacle, nor was the path itself, though it was at times narrow, or steep, or crumbling, or difficult to discern. No, this was no challenge. These hardships paled in comparison to the voices. They began quietly, as that murmur she had noticed in the corridor, so low that no words could be heard. But gradually, gradually, the volume grew, and the sentences became clear. \"You betrayed him...\" they whispered. \"You couldn't stop yourself looking. Weak. Foolish. Coward.\" \"I am all that and more.\" \"You believed a petty lie. You ruined everything. You almost destroyed your own child...\" \"Murderer!\" Her sister's shriek caused her to stumble, but she did not fall. \"You killed me!\" \"I did.\" She confessed. \"I sought revenge for my pain, and though I gained it I wish I could bring you back. But it cannot be done.\" \"Selfish! All you care about it yourself!\" \"I must fight for my child's life ahead of yours.\" For a moment, the voices fell silent. Then - \"What's in the box, Psyche?\" She bit her lip. \"What does it look like? I bet no mortal has ever seen that before... Surely a peek wouldn't hurt?\" It will kill me, she told herself, but her mouth was suddenly dry and she could not say the words aloud. \"How do you know there's even anything in there?\" The voices taunted. \"Perhaps the box is empty. Perhaps it was all a trick. Perhaps that wasn't Persephone at all...\" She tried not to look at the box, but she couldn't ignore the weight of it in her palm. It would be so easy to simply lift the lid... \"Just one look...\" The voices echoed eerily. \"Don't you want to know?\" Just one don't you want look want to know just want to look want look know want know know know - \"No!\" She had thought that before. One look could hurt. One look had nearly destroyed everything. She would not make that mistake again. \"I won't look!\" The voices fell quiet again, and she braced herself for the next onslaught. \"Psyche.\" She had expected something bad, but the thrill of recognition brought her to a halt. More than anything, she wanted to turn around, but now more than ever she knew she mustn't. She shook with the effort of keeping herself still. \"I was told you did not dwell in this place.\" He laughed, a sound so familiar it ached. \"I came to see you. But we are once more in darkness. How did you find your way here?\" \"I have a quest to complete.\" He sighed. \"As do I. Psyche -\" he stepped closer to her, so close she could feel his breath on her neck. \"I do not know what will happen to us. I wish I could promise your safety, but - All I know is that your path to the surface is short, and that I very much hope to see you once more in daylight. Good luck, my love.\" He was true to his word. She emerged, blinking, into the sunlight before the tears had dried on her cheeks. Everyone fell silent as the strange woman stumbled into the temple. \"Hear me goddess!\" she spoke, the voice echoing over the crowd. \"I bring you Persephone's beauty.\" She held aloft a small box. Those nearest to her recoiled. \"Do you accept my offering?\" Unseen, immortals debated. \"Impudence!\" hissed Aphrodite. \"She defies my oracles, and claims that to which she has no right.\" \"She is my wife!\" Eros protested. \"I have made my judgement,\" Zeus reminded her. \"Your boy has caused too much trouble. It is time that he was married, and he has claimed this mortal. Half the spirits on Olympus have been petitioning me on her behalf! You had your oracle, and still could not dissuade her. Let them be.\" Aphrodite glared at him and her son both. \"Mother - please...\" She sighed. \"I only want the best for you. But if my King commands it -\" Zeus nodded - \"Then I must grant my blessing.\" The crowd watched in awe as the strange woman dissolved in a shower of golden light. There was not even a moment's disorientation before she recognised him, the face she had glimpsed but once, but which was forever burned into her memory. \"I'm sorry,\" she gasped as they embraced. \"I ruined everything.\" \"It was my fault,\" he murmured in return. \"I can't believe you found me again.\" There would be time for explanations later - more time than Psyche knew. But for now, they were together again, and that was all that mattered.",

      "This time yesterday, she had expected to die, and now - The kiss took her by surprise.",
      "She was more surprised to find herself returning it.",
      "It was everything she had ever wanted, and more.",
      "Those glorious, sun-filled days had seemed to last an eternity.",
      "Each day, she tended the gardens, or spoke idly with the spirits, and each night - each night, she touched the heavens.",
      "Once or twice, she caught herself wondering if it was truly real - if she still lay on the mountain-top, dreaming, or if she had passed unknowing into Elysium - but then the touch of his skin on hers would bring her shivering back to reality, knowing that neither afterlife nor imagining could possibly make her feel so alive.",
      "And then - And then she had ruined it all.",
      "\"Please,\" she had begged.",
      "\"I am so happy.",
      "My father believes me dead.",
      "Let me tell him it is not so.\"",
      "\"You cannot leave this place,\" he had warned her.",
      "\"It is not safe for you.\"",
      "\"My sister,\" she had pleaded.",
      "\"Bring her here.",
      "She will carry my message.\"",
      "She had felt his muscles shift beneath her hand, and known he was smiling.",
      "\"So it will be.\"",
      "Her sister had arrived the next day, dazed at first, but soon embracing her like they had never quarrelled.",
      "Together, they whiled away the day, until it nearly came time for her sister to depart.",
      "\"I am so glad to see you safe, even if your husband is a monster.\"",
      "\"He's no monster!\"",
      "Psyche had laughed.",
      "He was so many things - her husband, her lover, her world - but nothing of him was monstrous.",
      "\"The oracle does not lie,\" her sister had reminded.",
      "\"And have you ever seen his face?\"",
      "\"I do not need to.\"",
      "Psyche honestly believed it to be true.",
      "She knew every inch of him.",
      "\"Then how do you know he is not the monster which stalks our father's kingdom, killing all it finds?\" Psyche had gasped.",
      "\"Is our father alright?\"",
      "\"For now,\" her sister replied darkly.",
      "\"But you should take care.\"",
      "Take care...",
      "And thus the seeds of doubt were sown.",
      "She had resisted for days, perhaps a month.",
      "But...",
      "The thought of it ate at her.",
      "She wondered: how bad could it truly be?",
      "She wondered: what was the worst that could happen?",
      "She wondered: what would she see?",
      "Until one night, her resolve crumbled, and she lit the candle beside the bed.",
      "She had never seen anything so beautiful, not even when his eyes opened and filled with fear.",
      "\"Run.\"",
      "She had run, because he had asked and she could not help but obey him.",
      "She had run as the house had tumbled down around her, as the garden had crumbled into dust, as the ground itself quaked beneath her feet.",
      "No",
      "-one was by her side, and no-one slower than she could possibly have survived.",
      "She ran even as she wept.",
      "She had run down the mountainside, across the fields, and into the town, until some sudden familiarity had brought her to a halt.",
      "This was her father's kingdom.",
      "She ran to the palace gates, hammering at the doors, begging to be let inside, but the King's daughter was dead, and to the guards she seemed a madwoman, shoeless and barely clothed.",
      "\"Please!\"",
      "she begged.",
      "\"Tell me at least that the monster has been slain?\"",
      "The guards shook their heads, and pushed her away, but she returned until eventually, one of them met her eyes.",
      "\"Ma'am, there is no monster.\"",
      "And it was only then that she realised what she had done.",
      "She had torn her life apart, demolished her home and murdered her only love - all over an unfounded fear.",
      "Her sister had told her a lie.",
      "And now - Now she stood on the clifftop, where this had all begun.",
      "She fancied she could see the blood on the rocks below.",
      "It had been so easy, taking her revenge.",
      "She would be punished for that, she knew.",
      "But she did not care.",
      "Her justice had been done.",
      "And now, there was nothing left for her.",
      "She took a deep breath, shut her eyes, and thought of him.",
      "Psyche leapt.",
      "She squeezed her eyes closed against the rushing winds of her descent, waiting for the moment that would end everything, a sharp flash of pain that would finally bring her peace - No moment came.",
      "She forced her eyes open again, squinting against the sting of the speeding air.",
      "Through her tears, she managed to fix her gaze on the stony wall of the mountainside, as stationary as it ever had been.",
      "She was not moving.",
      "But if she wasn't falling, then why was the wind so -?",
      "\"Psyche.\"",
      "The voice in her ear was both familiar and strange.",
      "It sounded old, older than she could comprehend - but beside that, it was the twin of the voice which kept her husband's house.",
      "A spirit of the air.",
      "Psyche comprehended only one thing: this spirit was stopping her fall.",
      "She began to thrash against the wind, hoping to free herself from its pull.",
      "She span in its embrace, sending herself tumbling head over heel.",
      "\"Psyche, I will not release you until you listen to me.\"",
      "\"Let me die!\"",
      "she shouted, in a voice hoarse from pain.",
      "\"I deserve it!",
      "I killed her!",
      "She was my sister and I killed her!\"",
      "\"She died by her own hand.\"",
      "\"Driven by my words!\"",
      "\"Her own hand, not yours,\" the spirit repeated.",
      "\"You told her she could take your husband for her own.",
      "Her jump blasphemed against her own marriage and her kin's.",
      "In the eyes of the gods, you bear no guilt.\"",
      "Psyche shut her eyes.",
      "\"What do I have left to live for?",
      "My husband is dead.",
      "My home is ruins.",
      "I am left with nothing.\"",
      "\"And what of the child?\" \"Child?\" Psyche gasped as her eyes flew open.",
      "She had not considered - that changed everything.",
      "Some part of him lived on.",
      "She could not bring herself to end that.",
      "Suddenly, she felt her feet touch solid rock, and the wind disappeared.",
      "She sagged to the ground, feeling weak with emotion.",
      "Her hair was tangled and her clothes dirtied, but only one question came to her lips.",
      "\"Wait!\"",
      "she called after the spirit.",
      "\"What shall I do?",
      "What shall I do for my child?\" \"Sacrifice.\"",
      "It was little more than a whisper on the wind, one she could barely believe she had truly heard, but she took it into her heart and guarded it fiercely.",
      "She would sacrifice.",
      "It was a strange city, for she had chosen to cross the mountains rather than risk returning to her father's kingdom.",
      "She had foraged for food on the road, and begged for what little she could convince her fellow travellers to part with.",
      "It was not a great amount, and even the smallest of sacrifices would leave hunger gnawing in her belly come nightfall, but she was determined.",
      "There were many temples here, one to every god she'd ever heard of and many more besides.",
      "But there was only one temple for her today.",
      "She approached the altar hesitantly, dropping her coins into the priestess's hands.",
      "\"Aphrodite,\" she pleaded.",
      "\"Keep my loves safe.\"",
      "The priestess met her eyes, but she did not speak the ritual reply.",
      "For a second, Psyche wondered if her offering would be refused.",
      "It was almost unheard of, but then she was little more than a beggar woman now... Suddenly, the priestess began to shake, her eyes rolling back in her head.",
      "Psyche knew the signs.",
      "This was another oracle, this time unasked for.",
      "She wanted to back away, to flee before the fates could further unbalance her life - but the goddess Aphrodite was talking to her, and she could do nothing but fall to her knees in reverence.",
      "\"Enter Hades...\" the otherworldly voice hissed.",
      "\"Seek Persephone's beauty... there is no other hope for you.\"",
      "The priestess dropped to the ground, and for a second, no-one moved.",
      "Then began a sudden surge forwards, as priestesses and supplicants alike sought understanding.",
      "By the time anyone turned to the girl kneeling on the floor, she was long gone.",
      "Psyche tore out of the city as fast as her legs would carry her, slowing to a walk only when she could no longer draw the breath to sprint.",
      "She found herself in an empty field.",
      "\"I shall not!\"",
      "She shouted at the sky.",
      "\"I will not seek death!",
      "Not when our child still needs me!\"",
      "She shuddered, suddenly afraid that the goddess would strike her down for this defiance.",
      "She might have welcomed the gods' punishment once, but now she had too much left to live for to want to throw her life away.",
      "Her child was worth more than a gamble on the gods' mercy.",
      "The thought almost made her laugh.",
      "Had she believed once that the gods were merciful?",
      "Perhaps her defiance was ignored because the gods listened naught to those beyond the temple walls.",
      "Entering Hades.",
      "She was truly cursed, now.",
      "Persephone's beauty was death itself...",
      "Well, Psyche had been cursed before.",
      "\"I will not enter Hades without a fight,\" she promised herself.",
      "A sudden crack echoed through the air and she froze, certain that Aphrodite would smite her for her blasphemous thoughts, but instead the ground beneath her feet began to quake and a jagged fissure burst open in the rock.",
      "Psyche gazed at it in wonder, her mind spinning with a new interpretation of Aphrodite's words.",
      "She had heard of portals to Hades before, through which the living could enter the kingdom of the underworld unharmed - but she had never thought she would see one with her own eyes.",
      "She stared into the darkness of the split rock.",
      "It was barely wide enough for her to fit through, and the ground continued to quake threateningly.",
      "It could close at any moment.",
      "If she jumped and her suspicions were wrong, she would certainly die.",
      "But if she did not jump, she might miss her one opportunity to survive the fate the oracle had cast for her.",
      "Murmuring a prayer to any god who might be listening, Psyche jumped into the darkness.",
      "She crashed heavily to the ground, too relieved to have landed at all to care about the jolt to her legs.",
      "The fall had lasted longer than she had thought possible, and it took several long, juddering breaths before she was calm enough to open her eyes.",
      "She had crumpled in a wide hallway, shimmering obsidian in eerie green torchlight.",
      "She could see no-one, but as fear began to sharpen her awareness of her surroundings, Psyche realised there was a low sound in the background - the constant whisper of a million voices reduced to the faintest itch only just above the threshold of hearing.",
      "\"Is anyone there?\" she called, her voice shaking a little.",
      "She had left the mortal realms behind her.",
      "Here, she was a trespasser, and powerless against any she was likely to encounter.",
      "\"How have you come here, as-yet-mortal?\" Psyche did not start at the voice, or even at the sudden appearance of its source, a beautiful woman dressed entirely in black who had seemed to melt out of the shadows.",
      "\"A portal opened for me,\" she answered, hastily straightening her clothes.",
      "\"A fissure in the earth.",
      "I leapt through it and landed here.\"",
      "The woman raised an eyebrow.",
      "\"But you surely knew that such a portal would lead you into Hades.",
      "Whyever did you jump?\" Psyche got to her feet, looking the woman directly in the eye.",
      "\"I am fated by oracle to enter Hades and seek Persephone's beauty,\" she informed the spirit.",
      "\"But I will not accept death.\"",
      "The woman laughed.",
      "\"Rebellion!",
      "Delightful.",
      "But there is always a way around an oracle, for those strong enough to find it.\"",
      "\"And mine is half-fulfilled.\"",
      "Psyche let herself speak proudly.",
      "\"I will survive and bear the child within me, for all that my husband is dead of my own foolish disobedience.\"",
      "\"Perhaps you may,\" the spirit smiled somewhat viciously, and Psyche shivered.",
      "\"But I can promise you this.",
      "You will not find your husband in this land.\"",
      "\"He lives?\"",
      "\"He does not dwell here yet.\"",
      "The spirit frowned.",
      "\"Tell me, mortal, what do you know of Persephone's beauty?\" Psyche burned to know more about her lost husband - lost but not yet dead?",
      "- but she did not wish to anger this spirit, and she recited what little she knew of the myth.",
      "\"Persephone has beauty beyond compare, but to lay a hand of it is the touch of death.\"",
      "The spirit smiled as though Psyche had passed a test.",
      "\"For mortals, yes.",
      "But not for me.",
      "Come.\"",
      "She turned and began to saunter down the corridor, but Psyche hesitated to follow.",
      "The spirit glanced back, and Psyche stumbled forward to the doorway she had just entered.",
      "\"This box -\" She could not possible have moved fast enough to retrieve it without Psyche seeing, but then who was to say she had not truly pulled it from thin air?",
      "- \"Contains a speck of Persephone's beauty.",
      "If you can carry it to the surface, then I believe your oracle will be completed.\"",
      "\"But - Persephone?\" Psyche asked.",
      "\"I am in her house.",
      "I cannot steal from her, especially not something so precious.\"",
      "The woman smiled.",
      "\"You have her permission.\"",
      "She was no spirit.",
      "Psyche swallowed and dropped her gaze, kneeling awkwardly.",
      "\"My lady, apologies, I -\" \"Rise, Psyche.\"",
      "The goddess pulled her to her feet, and rested a hand against her cheek.",
      "\"Courage is a rarer gift than you know.",
      "Complete this quest, and I believe Aphrodite's oracle will fall in your favour.",
      "Either way, you will get what you deserve.\"",
      "Her laugh made Psyche shudder as the hand was withdrawn, and in that moment's distraction the goddess and the corridor had vanished and she found herself on a narrow path, clutching the box tightly.",
      "She wanted to glance around to find her bearings, but she stopped herself.",
      "Tonight, she walked the path of Orpheus.",
      "This was no time to look back.",
      "The walk itself was not hard, and the weeks since the destruction of her home had toughened her.",
      "The dim light was no insurmountable obstacle, nor was the path itself, though it was at times narrow, or steep, or crumbling, or difficult to discern.",
      "No, this was no challenge.",
      "These hardships paled in comparison to the voices.",
      "They began quietly, as that murmur she had noticed in the corridor, so low that no words could be heard.",
      "But gradually, gradually, the volume grew, and the sentences became clear.",
      "\"You betrayed him...\" they whispered.",
      "\"You couldn't stop yourself looking.",
      "Weak.",
      "Foolish.",
      "Coward.\"",
      "\"I am all that and more.\"",
      "\"You believed a petty lie.",
      "You ruined everything.",
      "You almost destroyed your own child...\" \"Murderer!\"",
      "Her sister's shriek caused her to stumble, but she did not fall.",
      "\"You killed me!\"",
      "\"I did.\"",
      "She confessed.",
      "\"I sought revenge for my pain, and though I gained it I wish I could bring you back.",
      "But it cannot be done.\"",
      "\"Selfish!",
      "All you care about it yourself!\"",
      "\"I must fight for my child's life ahead of yours.\"",
      "For a moment, the voices fell silent.",
      "Then - \"What's in the box, Psyche?\"",
      "She bit her lip.",
      "\"What does it look like?",
      "I bet no mortal has ever seen that before...",
      "Surely a peek wouldn't hurt?\"",
      "It will kill me, she told herself, but her mouth was suddenly dry and she could not say the words aloud.",
      "\"How do you know there's even anything in there?\"",
      "The voices taunted.",
      "\"Perhaps the box is empty.",
      "Perhaps it was all a trick.",
      "Perhaps that wasn't Persephone at all...\" She tried not to look at the box, but she couldn't ignore the weight of it in her palm.",
      "It would be so easy to simply lift the lid...",
      "\"Just one look...\" The voices echoed eerily.",
      "\"Don't you want to know?\" Just one don't you want look want to know just want to look want look know want know know know - \"No!\"",
      "She had thought that before.",
      "One look could hurt.",
      "One look had nearly destroyed everything.",
      "She would not make that mistake again.",
      "\"I won't look!\"",
      "The voices fell quiet again, and she braced herself for the next onslaught.",
      "\"Psyche.\"",
      "She had expected something bad, but the thrill of recognition brought her to a halt.",
      "More than anything, she wanted to turn around, but now more than ever she knew she mustn't.",
      "She shook with the effort of keeping herself still.",
      "\"I was told you did not dwell in this place.\"",
      "He laughed, a sound so familiar it ached.",
      "\"I came to see you.",
      "But we are once more in darkness.",
      "How did you find your way here?\"",
      "\"I have a quest to complete.\"",
      "He sighed.",
      "\"As do I. Psyche -\" he stepped closer to her, so close she could feel his breath on her neck.",
      "\"I do not know what will happen to us.",
      "I wish I could promise your safety, but - All I know is that your path to the surface is short, and that I very much hope to see you once more in daylight.",
      "Good luck, my love.\"",
      "He was true to his word.",
      "She emerged, blinking, into the sunlight before the tears had dried on her cheeks.",
      "Everyone fell silent as the strange woman stumbled into the temple.",
      "\"Hear me goddess!\"",
      "she spoke, the voice echoing over the crowd.",
      "\"I bring you Persephone's beauty.\"",
      "She held aloft a small box.",
      "Those nearest to her recoiled.",
      "\"Do you accept my offering?\" Unseen, immortals debated.",
      "\"Impudence!\"",
      "hissed Aphrodite.",
      "\"She defies my oracles, and claims that to which she has no right.\"",
      "\"She is my wife!\"",
      "Eros protested.",
      "\"I have made my judgement,\" Zeus reminded her.",
      "\"Your boy has caused too much trouble.",
      "It is time that he was married, and he has claimed this mortal.",
      "Half the spirits on Olympus have been petitioning me on her behalf!",
      "You had your oracle, and still could not dissuade her.",
      "Let them be.\"",
      "Aphrodite glared at him and her son both.",
      "\"Mother - please...\" She sighed.",
      "\"I only want the best for you.",
      "But if my King commands it -\" Zeus nodded - \"Then I must grant my blessing.\"",
      "The crowd watched in awe as the strange woman dissolved in a shower of golden light.",
      "There was not even a moment's disorientation before she recognised him, the face she had glimpsed but once, but which was forever burned into her memory.",
      "\"I'm sorry,\" she gasped as they embraced.",
      "\"I ruined everything.\"",
      "\"It was my fault,\" he murmured in return.",
      "\"I can't believe you found me again.\"",
      "There would be time for explanations later - more time than Psyche knew.",
      "But for now, they were together again, and that was all that mattered."

    "text": "The first thing you notice about Deidamia is her resemblance to Patroklos, that same tilt to her chin, the same curve to her lips, those same golden flecks in her hair. Her body, however, is nothing like his, soft curves where you have known only hard angles. This does not dissuade you, though, because pleasure is pleasure and she is not unsightly in any way, and you like her well enough for a woman. But when Odysseus comes and unmasks your disguise, you leave her with no qualms, even though your child is already growing inside her womb. She has no faults but one: she is not Patroklos. Even if you were not intent upon attaining glory at Ilium, that would be reason enough for you to leave. Patroklos is the first thing you seek when you return to Phthia, and he is the thing you had most missed while in Skyros. Deidamia resembled him, somewhat, but she didn't have his apple-crisp laugh, his wine-dark eyes, his ability to take you captive with a single glance. Alone with him, you re-map the planes of his body, re-learn the different cadences of his voice, re-fit yourself to the dips and curves of his form, and it satisfies the humming in your blood, relaxes the tension in your chest, which, like an unwelcome guest you could not dismiss, had stayed for so long that you had forgotten it was ever not there, until it no longer was. After, you watch the sunlight playing on the surfaces of his body, gold caressing gold, and you think you know. You may not yet be a man, but you are old enough to lead the fiercest warriors of all Achaea into war, old enough to father a child, and so you are surely old enough to know. No one else will ever be good enough for you to love. * Before Patroklos left for Sparta, you asked him why. He said, \"Because who doesn't want the most beautiful woman in the world as his wife?\" When you first see Helen, she is standing upon the walls of Ilium, no longer the youthful beauty your cousin wanted for himself. You have met many beautiful women, have even had many of them, and yet you can still understand why a war has been waged because of her. The twin swords of honour and beauty, equally potent and equally deadly. However, when Briseis is taken from you, only honour drives your rage. She is very beautiful, clever as well, and you love her as much as a man can love a war prize. But she is no Helen, and even Helen does not inspire in you the all-consuming emotions that only Patroklos does. \"You are too proud,\" Patroklos murmurs later, when you are alone. You pin him beneath you, kiss him, and do not say, \"Because this is not my war.\" He is bound to this, and that would have been reason enough for you to follow him here, had you not been guaranteed immortality yourself. However, if not for his oath, you would have carried out your threat to leave. Why should you suffer this insult to your honour when they need you to conquer Ilium? But Patroklos cannot leave, and so you will not leave. Let kings come crawling again, beseeching you to fight once more, and let them come this time with more than just the the glory promised to you by a prophecy. Agamemnon would not accept the vow of compensation three and fourfold his loss, and now you will accept nothing less. It'll be your last gift to Patroklos, who has no kingdom of his own to which to return. You'll shower him with riches fit for a king in a final act of love, so that he may live like one even without you and your claim to Phthia. Because though no one else may be good enough for you to love, the call of eternal glory is still stronger. The rush of battle, the satisfaction of victory, the singing in your veins when you strike down another Trojan, they have driven you these past ten years, and anticipation of them had underlain your life even before then. You were born for this, and you wanted nothing else before Patroklos. Even now, you desire nothing beyond these two things. Ten years later, despite the lines and scars on his body where none were before, marking the story of his time here, he is still the most beautiful thing you have ever seen. The covetous shadows playing over his lamplit form agree. You traverse the roads of his body, inhale his breaths and swallow his desire, and sometimes, with good reason, the paths most well-worn remain the ones most worth taking. This is the song you will never tire of singing, love etched into all the words, and you press them into Patroklos's skin in the hopes that they'll permeate into his body, brand themselves into his organs and carve themselves into his bones, so that even after the price of your everlasting glory claims you, he will continue to carry the sheer force of your feeling with him wherever he goes. And when he joins you in the Elysian Fields, you will do it again and again and again, until his shade carries the mark of your love as well, until he can never doubt that under any other circumstance, you would have chosen him. * \"Because who doesn't want the most beautiful woman in the world as his wife?\" Patroklos had asked in response. More than ten years later, you have an answer for him. I don't, you think as everything shatters. This is not why you came here, seeking the only kind of immortality available to mortals. You are willing to pay for it with your life, but this is a price you had not foreseen. This is a price you would have refused to pay, had you known. Let Agamemnon keep Briseis. Let those petty kings squabble over the spoils of war. You'll kill Hector, and what he would have let happen to Patroklos, you'll return to him several times over. You'll send Hector to the Underworld to herald your final act of love, and you'll give Patroklos a funeral befitting a king so that he does not forget, just as you cannot. Because he does not outlive you, and thus cannot become proof that you had lived, you will become proof instead that he had existed, that he had been loved. Your names will be sung together even when Ilium is no more than an expanse of barren, dead earth, an empty name passed down the generations. You did not choose him, and so you will make him immortal with you. No one else can be good enough for you to love.",

    "text": "\"My daughter craved [power above ground] Inanna craved the [power below ground]. She who receives the decree of the underworld does not return. She who goes to the Dark City stays there.\" - The Descent of Inanna III. Resurrection (transformation). So it ends as it began: a dispute between Persephone and Zeus. Aphrodite rescues a human infant from a certain death and gives this child to Persephone, who, being in the land of Death, cannot bring forth life. Persephone raises the child to adulthood, and Aphrodite demands him back. And Zeus, who was unyielding when it came to his own daughter being bound to the Underworld, bows his head against Aphrodite's demands and lets Adonis choose where he wants to live. He chooses Aphrodite, and Persephone is left alone and forlorn in her realm. When Hermes comes to take Adonis away, she tells him, \"Ask our father that if the laws of the underworld are no longer sacred, does this apply to everyone?\" She does not expect an answer, and she does not get one. But when Charon brings the newly dead across the Styx that night, Persephone refuses to take them. It goes unnoticed by the King of Olympus at first, but as the Dead fill the shores of Styx, they began to overflow, eventually unable to cross at all. Her husband looks at her as if he no longer recognizes her, but she is content with that as long as he doesn't interfere. She holds his gaze until he turns away, and then she smiles. She thinks she's won this game they have been playing for eons, but it doesn't feel much like victory yet. She expects Hermes to come, but this time, she has managed to bring down the King of Gods himself. \"What is the meaning of this, Kore?\" She laughs because she has not heard that name in years, and these days, when mortals fear to utter her name, when no god can forget her portion in their offerings and no godly feast is complete without a place set in her name, she is still not worthy of her father's regard. Demeter calls her Kore to hold on to happier memories, but he calls her Kore because he refuses to acknowledge the power Persephone has. \"I abide by your rules, as ever, Father,\" she says. \"Those who enter the land of the dead can never leave - unless, of course, it suits your purpose to bring them back. But I do not recall any laws concerning those who never cross the Styx at all.\" She doesn't say any more than that, and in truth, she does not need to. If Zeus refuses to yield, then Gaia herself will turn against him for the burden Persephone will place on her by refusing to take the dead into the underworld. \"What do you desire, Persephone?\" he finally asks, and she smiles. * \"What do you desire, Demeter?\" He had asked her mother once, after Demeter refused to let anything grow on Earth, rendering the offering altars at Zeus' temples desolate and him powerless to oppose her wrath at him and Hades for having taken Persephone away. And Persephone has always been her mother's daughter, so much so that there are few people who have even considered that she has a father. Among the Olympians, the daughters of Zeus occupy two niches: those who are loved and acknowledged by Zeus, and those who are all but ignored by the king of Gods. But Immortal Persephone, the Goddess of Spring who rules the barren graveyard of the underworld, has ever lived between worlds, managing to escape the mundane laws that seem to govern everyone else. And here too, she manages to defy reason and tradition. For she is the only daughter of Zeus that he neither ignores, nor acknowledges. He has always been all too aware of her existence, planning her life for her, but never wanting a part in her life, beyond that. Athena is his favorite, loved more than any of his immortal sons are. And Artemis, the free spirited daughter he never wanted, is still loved more than Persephone. They both reign supreme as the Olympian Virgin goddesses, while she's a maiden in name only. Once, so long ago she barely remembers it, she asked her mother for the gift of virginity, and her mother, laughing, granted it. For what more did Demeter ever want than to have her daughter forever by her side? But the will of the Earth Mother had been nothing compared to the promise Zeus had made to his brother. And she was exiled from the world above, married to the deathless King of the spirits. * Athena's mother loved Zeus unconditionally and mistakenly believed that he loved her in equal measure. So she had told him that their son would be more powerful than Zeus himself, and Zeus could never allow anyone to dethrone him, to make him bow his head. Zeus, as fond as he was of her, was shrewd enough to appreciate her unconditional love, but wise enough to realize it's a risk to have that unconditional love of powerful goddesses directed towards anyone but himself. So he arranges a marriage for Aphrodite to Hephaestus, who is perhaps the one man she can never love. He benevolently grants Artemis eternal chastity when she asks for it, and he trains Athena to love the world of ideas and weapons, and she becomes wise enough to abhor love. Persephone, however, is no threat to him. So he takes no active part in her marriage, but when he sees his dread brother Hades overcome with passion for Persephone, it is only too convenient to let Hades have the girl, taking her away from Demeter. For Persephone's true power lies in the power she has over her mother, the one woman Zeus could never overpower. * Demeter does not resist him like Hera does, and because he senses power in her, he courts her first. When he talks of marriage, however, she laughs. Zeus never forgives this offense. Hera's sense of honor - honor as dictated by the laws Zeus himself created - compels her to accept his suit after he has forced himself on her. Demeter, though, has no respect for his laws or her own honor as he sees it. When she lies on her birthing bed, she does not call for him, nor asks for a boon for her first-born child. And Zeus, who is only too happy to ignore his numerous offspring, waits for Demeter to bring her lovely daughter to his court, as Leto had presented her twins, despite Hera's wrath. What angers him the most, perhaps, is that Demeter calls for Hera to attend her birthing bed, and Hera, who is ever planning ill for his offspring not birthed by her, ignores his wishes to go attend to her sister. Hera, he knows how to punish, but Demeter has placed herself and her daughter out of his power. His power is infinite, however, and so he waits for the day that he can make Demeter feel it. II. Death (dying). When Persephone comes of age and every god on Olympus not lusting after Aphrodite sets his mind on her, Demeter finds the Earth not large enough to hide her daughter from them. She knows she cannot rely on Zeus' protection for she knows that Zeus still begrudges her her independence, and he certainly has no love for Persephone after the girl herself asserted her will against him, young as she was. But when Apollo courts her, Demeter lets her guard down. In turn, seeing Demeter hide her smile behind her hand at the sight of Apollo bringing her gifts, Persephone is inclined to accept his suit. He brings her sunflowers and abandons his lovely muses to watch her dance. Persephone herself, however, has no use for light, as much as she appreciates Apollo's. She is drawn to death, from the first, to death and darkness. One day, they're sitting in a forest as Apollo plays on his harp lightly, and the peaceful silence is broken by an arrow flying past them. Apollo's brows knit together as he keeps playing, but Persephone is too interested in the direction of the arrow to pay much attention. She's up on her feet within seconds and chasing the arrow. She comes upon it to discover a dying stag. She kneels by it, watches it die, but turns away once life has left its body to find Apollo's sister watching her intently. She's not like the other gods, and Persephone has rarely seen her on Olympus. No, Artemis prefers the ever changing forests where she can watch the passage of time, prefers companions who die rather than the immortal ones who betray her for the love of men. So Persephone shrinks from Apollo's shimmering light, from his love, drawn in instead by Artemis' ruthlessness, her drive for the hunt, and her affinity for the night and its many mysteries, such as they are for gods. She doesn't have a talent for the hunt as Artemis does, but she enjoys letting Artemis teach her, and sometimes, Persephone comes so near death that she can feel the blood of the dying animals vibrate within her own immortal veins. Artemis finds her in thrall like this once, and laughs, and says, \"I relish the chase, Kore, but you seem to find your fulfillment in death.\" There's no reproach in it, though. She and Artemis are of like minds, and as much as Artemis compels her to be pulled away from Olympus and into her wilderness, she is always happy to follow Persephone back to Olympus when she goes to see Demeter. * Once she comes upon a dark patch of earth near a cave, when out hunting with Artemis, and she's compelled to leave her companions behind for the sake of curiosity. It is not a flower in bloom that draws her to her fate, as the poets would say later. Rather, it is a decaying bloom, dying despite the eternal spring Demeter has blessed the Earth with. But it exists on the boundary between worlds, overwhelmed by the shadow of death that exists at the outskirts of Hades. She plucks it and it falls apart in her hands, but she is not satisfied, so she steps one foot over the threshold, into the cave that seems to lead inward and down. But before she can set her foot down, a sound distracts her. She turns back once to see Artemis laughing with her nymphs, not having yet missed Persephone's absence, and the lyrical sound of that laughter is the only thing holding her back. But it is enough, for now. Later, she sees that same flower in bloom - an illusion created by Hades, she would later learn -- and her curiosity gets the better of her. She touches it and it withers again, but she waits to see it grow yet again. Artemis is not with her today, and she wants something else to occupy her mind, wants to experience this realm that makes such miracles - such death and rebirth - possible. When she crosses over into the cave, the flowers in her hair wither, the petals falling on her trail. When she comes upon the River Styx and places her feet inside it to cross it, the diamonds around her neck - made of moonbeams and given to her by Artemis - lose their luster and turn to coal. She snatches them off and lets the pieces fall into the water. When she emerges on the other side, her golden robes - a gift from Apollo - cling to her, having lost their sunlit luster. And she enters the land of Death without any markings of her divinity, vulnerable both to its powers and its laws. Hades, whose name she has only heard in whispers around Olympus, greets her at the gates of the Underworld, and she finds it curious that he should be waiting at the gates for her. \"You anticipated my visit?\" she asks. \"I could not miss your radiance, and that is not the way gods take into the Underworld.\" Anticipating being led into secrets beyond her age and power, she asks, \"How do gods enter the Underworld then?\" Hades smiles, and says, \"They do not enter the Underworld.\" When she has no answer to that, Hades asks, \"Will you stay, Daughter of Zeus?\" And he makes it sound like she has a choice. * Persephone, at least, has the illusion of choice, but Demeter is not given even that much. So while Persephone roams around the underworld and explores and learns Hades' dread world, Demeter runs from one corner to another of her own world, searching for her Kore. Hades could not have seen Persephone unless she let herself be seen by coming to his threshold, but once he has seen her, nothing else would do. And suddenly, Zeus' careful balance of power was near tipping over for Hades was no longer satisfied with his lot. He wanted to be - demanded to be - let back inside Olympus, leaving his realm unguarded, so he may compete for the hand of Kore with the other deathless gods. So Zeus did not ask Demeter, did not give her a choice, for he already knew the contempt his request would be met with, if she did not outright laugh at him. And it had been ages since Demeter had had that kind of power over him, but he could not let the echo of that laughter - not even filled with contempt as much as it was with utter dismissal - go. He would never give her that power over him again, and he would steal from right under her the one thing - the only thing - that mattered to her. So instead of meeting Hades' insolence with reproach, he smiled at his brother and granted him this boon. So they tried to lure her in with blooming flowers, underestimating the lure Death had for her, and she was drawn in, not by the bloom, but by the fact that it died. And rebloomed. And Zeus underestimated Demeter, once again, for she did not so much as plead before him for the sake of her daughter. She searched the Earth for Kore for all of nine days, days that felt long as the months of carrying her, but with no hope of having her near her at the end of this labor. At the end of these nine days, Artemis, also desolate with the loss of Persephone, came to Demeter and told her of her suspicions. Demeter's grief turned outward and turned into wrath and contempt, but instead of giving Zeus the satisfaction of seeing her like this, she withdrew from Olympus and went to live among humans, denying herself the divine gifts that her daughter could no longer partake of. * It is Demeter who brings Earth its first drought, refusing to nurture Earth or its people, but Persephone is what brings Earth its first winter. As was decreed by the Fates, the Olympian gods - Zeus, foremost among them - draw a large portion of their power from the offerings left on their altars by mortal beings. But humans, barely having enough to eat in the next year, do not have anything left to offer to the gods, and so Demeter makes her absence be felt on Olympus with the intensity that she herself feels the absence of Kore. But Persephone's absence, in truth, is felt all over Earth in its first winter. When Persephone crosses over the threshold of Hades and wanders the underworld -- being within it, but not of it yet -- it opens both worlds up to each other, and both mortals and gods hold their breaths as this transformation takes place. Meanwhile, the gates to the Underworld are left open for any Gods who would want to cross over (though no one else dares), and the dreary, cold winds of Hades blow through the cave and out into the world, and humans both freeze as well as starve. * (In the old days, before Persephone crossed over the threshold of Hades, humans used to hang their dead from the trees, offering them up to the birds of the sky, as no god would accept such offerings. Later, this ritual of offering the dead to the birds came to be a sign of the uncivilized world, a sign of people devoid of the blessings of Persephone and the teachings of Demeter, her holy mother. But when Persephone came to live beneath the Earth, humans learned from Demeter how to bury their dead so Persephone could bring them back again in the Underworld, giving them back their bodies, which had been allotted to her on that fateful day that she herself had long forgotten and that Demeter did not like to think on. Before that time, the shades wandered aimlessly in Hades, desolate and purposeless. Because they did not have bodies, they could not feel anything, and death - the fate of every mortal - was an experience to be feared most dreadfully. Their only salvation was Lethe - the river of forgetfulness - for their only relief from their desolation was to forget that they had ever been alive, been anything more than shades wandering through Hades aimlessly. But Persephone, as she transformed in Hades, transformed Death as well, opening her two worlds to each other, bound by the laws of both, but not yet able to attain power over either. Persephone's power, however, extended over a greater portion of humanity than even Zeus.' Zeus had them for but a blink of an eye to Persephone's eternal hold over them. And in this knowledge lay her power. But she did not come to this understanding immediately, nor did she come to it without suffering.) * When Persephone returns to her mother, Demeter embraces her and it is as if they were never parted, and neither talks of the separation that is past or the separation that will come again every year. Artemis does not speak of it either, but Persephone feels her anger, her sense of betrayal, in the tenseness of her body as they embrace. Because Artemis cannot bring herself to withdraw from Persephone, she withdraws into herself instead. They try to hunt together, Artemis drawn in by the chase, and Persephone, more than ever, by death. But there is something different about the animals now. At the sight of Persephone, instead of running from their fate, they submit, and Artemis finds herself unable to kill them in her presence. So now there's a rift between them that can never be healed, a rift spanning the length of a mortal lifetime, such as it is. That's the distinction between them now, Artemis who attends to the birthing bed and helps women with child birth, and Persephone, who waits for her offerings by deathbeds. Persephone leaves Artemis to her hunting, choosing to spend her time with Demeter while the Moon goddess runs through the forests in darkness. Back on Olympus, the gods shrink from Persephone, act as if she belongs forever to that world from which she is exiled for a time, and she finds herself missing watching Artemis hunt and kill. The order of Artemis' world demands that she punish all of her companions - mortals with death and goddesses with exile - who leave her, after having sworn an oath to her. She finds herself unable to punish Persephone, but nor can she forgive her. \"Would you rather that he had taken me by force to the underworld?\" Persephone asks her once. \"Would you forgive me more easily if it hadn't been my choice?\" Artemis turns the question on her, \"Was it your choice?\" She is uncertain whether she fears a denial or a confirmation more. \"Some of it was, and some of it was fate, and still some of it - maybe a lot of it - was forced on me. But I did cross the threshold myself, and I am not certain I would make a different choice.\" And this is where Artemis has trouble understanding Persephone. Artemis, who demands utter loyalty from her companions and sees utter betrayal in anything less, does not understand how Persephone, so like herself, could have ever put herself in a situation where she had anything less than complete agency over herself, put herself under the power of something else the way Artemis has vowed never to. But the fact that she is willing to try, that she cannot just dismiss Persephone like she has so many of her other companions, means that Persephone is not the only one who has been transformed by this experience. When time draws near for Persephone to return to her dread Husband, Artemis asks, \"Do you love him?\" \"I was drawn in by his power. And I would have loved him - steadily and with intensity as he loves me - if not for his deception. If he had given me a choice, I might have chosen to stay with him.\" And Artemis, who should perhaps be jealous, smiles because she understands that in this, too, they are of like minds, Artemis, who can never forgive betrayal, and Persephone, who will never forgive deception. She says, \"I wish he had,\" for she understands that if Persephone had been given a choice, she would never have chosen to bound herself to the Underworld for half the year and would have been free to come and go between the worlds as she pleased. When they part again that year, Artemis holds on tightly to her hand as Persephone clings to Demeter. Demeter, bereaved and desolate, can let her go and look forward to the reunion, but Artemis, angry and inconsolable, cannot stand to send her to him willingly. In the Underworld, Persephone finds that death does not become any easier for having gone through it before. If anything, it is worse now that she knows that she has no choice in this, and it is this that makes her resent her lot and her husband. She finds him waiting for her again at the gates of the Underworld, and when he smiles at her, her first instinct is to go to him, but she remember also his smile as he had handed her the pomegranate seeds and bid her eat them. So she turns away from him, holding on tightly to her moonbeam necklace that had turned into coals again on her way down, but Artemis had promised her that it would gain back its luster when she returned to her. The Underworld is different now from when she left it, filled with a sort of life it never had before Persephone came to it. The dead, having their bodies again, can continue a kind of existence here, able to recognize their kin now that they do not have to drink from Lethe. With Hades' help, she also carves out a piece of Underworld for the Blessed among the dead, and she is grateful to him for letting her shape his world to her liking, but she would never tell him that, lest he think he has been forgiven. Next, she asks Apollo for a piece of his sun for her new world, and because he had loved her once, he grants her this. From Artemis, she asks a piece of the moon, and Artemis gives this willingly. Demeter gives her seeds of the Earth and allows them to grow in the Underworld the way she would not let things grow in the absence of Persephone on Earth. And soon, a piece of Underworld possesses more beauty and life than Earth does while Demeter makes all of the world feel her loss. Persephone, however, finds that she misses her mother, misses Artemis, and even Apollo, with a stronger yearning in this place that is filled with reminders of their blessings. So instead of mourning her loss, she goes back to the dark part of Hades, and walks among the dead, learning their lives and their stories through the day, and at night, such as it is here, she returns to her husband. And so it is through the years, with each death becoming harder and harder on her, even as humans learn to deal better with the lot given them. They can prepare for winter and drought, but she does not know how to prepare for an exile from all the people she loves, and she cannot help but want to punish Hades all the more for it each year, unable as she is to punish Zeus, who allowed all of this to happen. He loves her light, Hades had told her in the beginning. So she leaves her fire behind on Earth when she descends, and the sun falls out of her hair, turning it dark and drab, and she wonders if it still draws her husband in like it had at first. He loves the signs of life she brings with her to his realm, he had confessed to her in those first weeks before his deception, so she leaves that behind, too. And lies in his bed lifeless and unmoving as he moves above her, and finally, he tires of her. She thinks, perhaps unjustly, that he might have liked her better if she fought back. After all, he had loved her fire. In the ninth year that she returns to Earth, Artemis is absent from the temple that Demeter receives her in every year, and she cannot wait to accept all her offerings and receive the blessings of her mother so she can go look for her. When she finds Artemis in her forest, surrounded by more dead animals than Persephone has ever seen her kill in a day, she embraces her and feels Artemis stiffen in her arms again as she had that first time she returned. And Artemis says, \"Persephone, this cannot go on. You absence is harder to bear every year, and I cannot even rejoice in your return for I cannot stop anticipating your return to Hades.\" The queen of the underworld flinches at that, because this is the first time Artemis has called her by her new name, and she wonders if this means that they cannot go back again. But the truth is that they could have never gone back, not after Persephone found the lure of Hades greater than the draw of Artemis, but they could have gone pretending. \"But you live on Earth, are all but exiled from Olympus, and that does not make Apollo's love for you any lesser.\" \"Because our worlds are not separated by the laws of gods and men. He can visit me as often as he likes, but I cannot see you as I wish to, no matter how much I yearn to.\" \"What will you have me do, Artemis?\" \"Fight him,\" Artemis says. \"I have been, but it is not as easy as you seem to think. I have no one else there.\" \"Not Hades,\" Artemis says, and Persephone fears that she knows what Artemis is suggesting. \"He is but a pawn, and he can be yours, Persephone.\" She has lost herself, she thinks, but she knows that she cannot stand to lose Artemis, too. So she asks, \"How?\" \"Your power is the only one beyond Zeus' domain of influence. Make him feel it, make it infringe on his rules and make him change them.\" * The truth is that Persephone never falls in love with Adonis. Oh, she loves him, to be sure, as only one deprived of any other life can - steadily and intensely, but it is not what Aphrodite feels for him. Still, she chooses to let Aphrodite think that, chooses to let Aphrodite bring Zeus to break his own rules, as only she can. And when Adonis is given his choice, and chooses Aphrodite, Artemis shoots him with an arrow made out of moonbeams, and places him back under Persephone's power. Because the Goddess of Beauty weeps prettily and laments her loss, it is easier for Persephone's father to side against his daughter, allowing Adonis to come back to Earth. And Adonis, a mortal, is given more freedom to go between worlds than Persephone, a goddess, was given. Zeus can see himself as benevolent because he sees Aphrodite as powerless, and Persephone wonders if perhaps Aphrodite is the wisest of them all. But Persephone does not just want to win her honors back. Persephone wants Zeus to know that he has lost. So she lets him think that he is siding against her, even as he plays fully into her hands, and when he breaks his own rules, it allows Persephone to force him to give her her choice back so she may come and go between the worlds as she pleases, exerting power over both as only she can. I. Birth (creation). When she is still a young girl, Kore comes upon a muddy river littered with stones and weed upon which she cuts the soles of her feet. As she sits there waiting for her skin to heal and form anew, she picks up the mud and fashions it into her own form. This form, she holds on to as Demeter carries her home and keeps it hidden. She bides her time, and when she watches Artemis ask Zeus for the boon of sovereignty over herself, asks to be under no man's power, Kore presents the form she's created to her father and asks him to grant it life. He breathes into it, and in turn, the form breathes. But when Kore wants to name the creature, to have power over it, Zeus, greedy as he is proud, seeks to lay claim to this creation. Kore, too young to understand the entirety of Zeus' dominion, refuses to yield. Demeter intervenes on her daughter's behalf only to be denied, so she pleads before the only power that Zeus, too, must obey. And the Fates say to him, \"Since you gave the creature its life, you'll derive power from that life, when they worship you and offer sacrifices in your name, but because this creature shall not rival gods, it must be mortal. And since Kore fashioned its body, let her have it in death, and derive her power from the shades. And so shall it be with all livings things that must also die, humans and animals alike.\" And Zeus, in his arrogance, is content to have power over humans' lives, not understanding the power death would come to hold. Persephone, by creating mortals, in effect, creates Death. The order of the world demands that mortals be different from Gods, be lesser, but death gives them something that gods can not (must not) ever experience. Persephone, however, knows (learns), the way Zeus never can, that to exert complete control over her domain, she must experience all that mortals do. So she becomes the only god to ever experience Death, even before she understands the lure it holds for her. Death did not exist before this moment when Kore, in her innocence makes a toy and inadvertently creates a world that Zeus can never exert full power over. Before this moment, Underworld was little more than a prison where fallen gods like Kronus, and Uranus before him, were banished, the only thing marking it from the rest of the Earth being its power to hold people inside it once they had crossed the threshold. And so her fate is set even before Hades ever lays eyes on her, but no one, least of all she herself, understands this decree yet. Or its power. *",

      "There's no reproach in it, though.",
      "She and Artemis are of like minds, and as much as Artemis compels her to be pulled away from Olympus and into her wilderness, she is always happy to follow Persephone back to Olympus when she goes to see Demeter.",
      "* Once she comes upon a dark patch of earth near a cave, when out hunting with Artemis, and she's compelled to leave her companions behind for the sake of curiosity.",
      "It is not a flower in bloom that draws her to her fate, as the poets would say later.",
      "Rather, it is a decaying bloom, dying despite the eternal spring Demeter has blessed the Earth with.",
      "But it exists on the boundary between worlds, overwhelmed by the shadow of death that exists at the outskirts of Hades.",
      "She plucks it and it falls apart in her hands, but she is not satisfied, so she steps one foot over the threshold, into the cave that seems to lead inward and down.",
      "But before she can set her foot down, a sound distracts her.",
      "She turns back once to see Artemis laughing with her nymphs, not having yet missed Persephone's absence, and the lyrical sound of that laughter is the only thing holding her back.",
      "But it is enough, for now.",
      "Later, she sees that same flower in bloom - an illusion created by Hades, she would later learn -- and her curiosity gets the better of her.",
      "She touches it and it withers again, but she waits to see it grow yet again.",
      "Artemis is not with her today, and she wants something else to occupy her mind, wants to experience this realm that makes such miracles - such death and rebirth - possible.",
      "When she crosses over into the cave, the flowers in her hair wither, the petals falling on her trail.",
      "When she comes upon the River Styx and places her feet inside it to cross it, the diamonds around her neck - made of moonbeams and given to her by Artemis - lose their luster and turn to coal.",
      "She snatches them off and lets the pieces fall into the water.",
      "When she emerges on the other side, her golden robes - a gift from Apollo - cling to her, having lost their sunlit luster.",
      "And she enters the land of Death without any markings of her divinity, vulnerable both to its powers and its laws.",
      "Hades, whose name she has only heard in whispers around Olympus, greets her at the gates of the Underworld, and she finds it curious that he should be waiting at the gates for her.",
      "\"You anticipated my visit?\" she asks.",
      "\"I could not miss your radiance, and that is not the way gods take into the Underworld.\"",
      "Anticipating being led into secrets beyond her age and power, she asks, \"How do gods enter the Underworld then?\" Hades smiles, and says, \"They do not enter the Underworld.\"",
      "When she has no answer to that, Hades asks, \"Will you stay, Daughter of Zeus?\"",
      "And he makes it sound like she has a choice.",
      "* Persephone, at least, has the illusion of choice, but Demeter is not given even that much.",
      "So while Persephone roams around the underworld and explores and learns Hades' dread world, Demeter runs from one corner to another of her own world, searching for her Kore.",
      "Hades could not have seen Persephone unless she let herself be seen by coming to his threshold, but once he has seen her, nothing else would do.",
      "And suddenly, Zeus' careful balance of power was near tipping over for Hades was no longer satisfied with his lot.",
      "He wanted to be - demanded to be - let back inside Olympus, leaving his realm unguarded, so he may compete for the hand of Kore with the other deathless gods.",
      "So Zeus did not ask Demeter, did not give her a choice, for he already knew the contempt his request would be met with, if she did not outright laugh at him.",
      "And it had been ages since Demeter had had that kind of power over him, but he could not let the echo of that laughter - not even filled with contempt as much as it was with utter dismissal - go.",
      "He would never give her that power over him again, and he would steal from right under her the one thing - the only thing - that mattered to her.",
      "So instead of meeting Hades' insolence with reproach, he smiled at his brother and granted him this boon.",
      "So they tried to lure her in with blooming flowers, underestimating the lure Death had for her, and she was drawn in, not by the bloom, but by the fact that it died.",
      "And rebloomed.",
      "And Zeus underestimated Demeter, once again, for she did not so much as plead before him for the sake of her daughter.",
      "She searched the Earth for Kore for all of nine days, days that felt long as the months of carrying her, but with no hope of having her near her at the end of this labor.",
      "At the end of these nine days, Artemis, also desolate with the loss of Persephone, came to Demeter and told her of her suspicions.",
      "Demeter's grief turned outward and turned into wrath and contempt, but instead of giving Zeus the satisfaction of seeing her like this, she withdrew from Olympus and went to live among humans, denying herself the divine gifts that her daughter could no longer partake of.",
      "* It is Demeter who brings Earth its first drought, refusing to nurture Earth or its people, but Persephone is what brings Earth its first winter.",
      "As was decreed by the Fates, the Olympian gods - Zeus, foremost among them - draw a large portion of their power from the offerings left on their altars by mortal beings.",
      "But humans, barely having enough to eat in the next year, do not have anything left to offer to the gods, and so Demeter makes her absence be felt on Olympus with the intensity that she herself feels the absence of Kore.",
      "But Persephone's absence, in truth, is felt all over Earth in its first winter.",
      "When Persephone crosses over the threshold of Hades and wanders the underworld -- being within it, but not of it yet -- it opens both worlds up to each other, and both mortals and gods hold their breaths as this transformation takes place.",
      "Meanwhile, the gates to the Underworld are left open for any Gods who would want to cross over (though no one else dares), and the dreary, cold winds of Hades blow through the cave and out into the world, and humans both freeze as well as starve.",
      "* (In the old days, before Persephone crossed over the threshold of Hades, humans used to hang their dead from the trees, offering them up to the birds of the sky, as no god would accept such offerings.",
      "Later, this ritual of offering the dead to the birds came to be a sign of the uncivilized world, a sign of people devoid of the blessings of Persephone and the teachings of Demeter, her holy mother.",
      "But when Persephone came to live beneath the Earth, humans learned from Demeter how to bury their dead so Persephone could bring them back again in the Underworld, giving them back their bodies, which had been allotted to her on that fateful day that she herself had long forgotten and that Demeter did not like to think on.",
      "Before that time, the shades wandered aimlessly in Hades, desolate and purposeless.",
      "Because they did not have bodies, they could not feel anything, and death - the fate of every mortal - was an experience to be feared most dreadfully.",
      "Their only salvation was Lethe - the river of forgetfulness - for their only relief from their desolation was to forget that they had ever been alive, been anything more than shades wandering through Hades aimlessly.",
      "But Persephone, as she transformed in Hades, transformed Death as well, opening her two worlds to each other, bound by the laws of both, but not yet able to attain power over either.",
      "Persephone's power, however, extended over a greater portion of humanity than even Zeus.'",
      "Zeus had them for but a blink of an eye to Persephone's eternal hold over them.",
      "And in this knowledge lay her power.",
      "But she did not come to this understanding immediately, nor did she come to it without suffering.)",
      "* When Persephone returns to her mother, Demeter embraces her and it is as if they were never parted, and neither talks of the separation that is past or the separation that will come again every year.",
      "Artemis does not speak of it either, but Persephone feels her anger, her sense of betrayal, in the tenseness of her body as they embrace.",
      "Because Artemis cannot bring herself to withdraw from Persephone, she withdraws into herself instead.",
      "They try to hunt together, Artemis drawn in by the chase, and Persephone, more than ever, by death.",
      "But there is something different about the animals now.",
      "At the sight of Persephone, instead of running from their fate, they submit, and Artemis finds herself unable to kill them in her presence.",
      "So now there's a rift between them that can never be healed, a rift spanning the length of a mortal lifetime, such as it is.",
      "That's the distinction between them now, Artemis who attends to the birthing bed and helps women with child birth, and Persephone, who waits for her offerings by deathbeds.",
      "Persephone leaves Artemis to her hunting, choosing to spend her time with Demeter while the Moon goddess runs through the forests in darkness.",
      "Back on Olympus, the gods shrink from Persephone, act as if she belongs forever to that world from which she is exiled for a time, and she finds herself missing watching Artemis hunt and kill.",
      "The order of Artemis' world demands that she punish all of her companions - mortals with death and goddesses with exile - who leave her, after having sworn an oath to her.",
      "She finds herself unable to punish Persephone, but nor can she forgive her.",
      "\"Would you rather that he had taken me by force to the underworld?\" Persephone asks her once.",
      "\"Would you forgive me more easily if it hadn't been my choice?\"",
      "Artemis turns the question on her, \"Was it your choice?\"",
      "She is uncertain whether she fears a denial or a confirmation more.",
      "\"Some of it was, and some of it was fate, and still some of it - maybe a lot of it - was forced on me.",
      "But I did cross the threshold myself, and I am not certain I would make a different choice.\"",
      "And this is where Artemis has trouble understanding Persephone.",
      "Artemis, who demands utter loyalty from her companions and sees utter betrayal in anything less, does not understand how Persephone, so like herself, could have ever put herself in a situation where she had anything less than complete agency over herself, put herself under the power of something else the way Artemis has vowed never to.",
      "But the fact that she is willing to try, that she cannot just dismiss Persephone like she has so many of her other companions, means that Persephone is not the only one who has been transformed by this experience.",
      "When time draws near for Persephone to return to her dread Husband, Artemis asks, \"Do you love him?\"",
      "\"I was drawn in by his power.",
      "And I would have loved him - steadily and with intensity as he loves me - if not for his deception.",
      "If he had given me a choice, I might have chosen to stay with him.\"",
      "And Artemis, who should perhaps be jealous, smiles because she understands that in this, too, they are of like minds, Artemis, who can never forgive betrayal, and Persephone, who will never forgive deception.",
      "She says, \"I wish he had,\" for she understands that if Persephone had been given a choice, she would never have chosen to bound herself to the Underworld for half the year and would have been free to come and go between the worlds as she pleased.",
      "When they part again that year, Artemis holds on tightly to her hand as Persephone clings to Demeter.",
      "Demeter, bereaved and desolate, can let her go and look forward to the reunion, but Artemis, angry and inconsolable, cannot stand to send her to him willingly.",
      "In the Underworld, Persephone finds that death does not become any easier for having gone through it before.",
      "If anything, it is worse now that she knows that she has no choice in this, and it is this that makes her resent her lot and her husband.",
      "She finds him waiting for her again at the gates of the Underworld, and when he smiles at her, her first instinct is to go to him, but she remember also his smile as he had handed her the pomegranate seeds and bid her eat them.",
      "So she turns away from him, holding on tightly to her moonbeam necklace that had turned into coals again on her way down, but Artemis had promised her that it would gain back its luster when she returned to her.",
      "The Underworld is different now from when she left it, filled with a sort of life it never had before Persephone came to it.",
      "The dead, having their bodies again, can continue a kind of existence here, able to recognize their kin now that they do not have to drink from Lethe.",
      "With Hades' help, she also carves out a piece of Underworld for the Blessed among the dead, and she is grateful to him for letting her shape his world to her liking, but she would never tell him that, lest he think he has been forgiven.",
      "Next, she asks Apollo for a piece of his sun for her new world, and because he had loved her once, he grants her this.",
      "From Artemis, she asks a piece of the moon, and Artemis gives this willingly.",
      "Demeter gives her seeds of the Earth and allows them to grow in the Underworld the way she would not let things grow in the absence of Persephone on Earth.",
      "And soon, a piece of Underworld possesses more beauty and life than Earth does while Demeter makes all of the world feel her loss.",
      "Persephone, however, finds that she misses her mother, misses Artemis, and even Apollo, with a stronger yearning in this place that is filled with reminders of their blessings.",
      "So instead of mourning her loss, she goes back to the dark part of Hades, and walks among the dead, learning their lives and their stories through the day, and at night, such as it is here, she returns to her husband.",
      "And so it is through the years, with each death becoming harder and harder on her, even as humans learn to deal better with the lot given them.",
      "They can prepare for winter and drought, but she does not know how to prepare for an exile from all the people she loves, and she cannot help but want to punish Hades all the more for it each year, unable as she is to punish Zeus, who allowed all of this to happen.",
      "He loves her light, Hades had told her in the beginning.",
      "So she leaves her fire behind on Earth when she descends, and the sun falls out of her hair, turning it dark and drab, and she wonders if it still draws her husband in like it had at first.",
      "He loves the signs of life she brings with her to his realm, he had confessed to her in those first weeks before his deception, so she leaves that behind, too.",
      "And lies in his bed lifeless and unmoving as he moves above her, and finally, he tires of her.",
      "She thinks, perhaps unjustly, that he might have liked her better if she fought back.",
      "After all, he had loved her fire.",
      "In the ninth year that she returns to Earth, Artemis is absent from the temple that Demeter receives her in every year, and she cannot wait to accept all her offerings and receive the blessings of her mother so she can go look for her.",
      "When she finds Artemis in her forest, surrounded by more dead animals than Persephone has ever seen her kill in a day, she embraces her and feels Artemis stiffen in her arms again as she had that first time she returned.",
      "And Artemis says, \"Persephone, this cannot go on.",
      "You absence is harder to bear every year, and I cannot even rejoice in your return for I cannot stop anticipating your return to Hades.\"",
      "The queen of the underworld flinches at that, because this is the first time Artemis has called her by her new name, and she wonders if this means that they cannot go back again.",
      "But the truth is that they could have never gone back, not after Persephone found the lure of Hades greater than the draw of Artemis, but they could have gone pretending.",
      "\"But you live on Earth, are all but exiled from Olympus, and that does not make Apollo's love for you any lesser.\"",
      "\"Because our worlds are not separated by the laws of gods and men.",
      "He can visit me as often as he likes, but I cannot see you as I wish to, no matter how much I yearn to.\"",
      "\"What will you have me do, Artemis?\"",
      "\"Fight him,\" Artemis says.",
      "\"I have been, but it is not as easy as you seem to think.",
      "I have no one else there.\"",
      "\"Not Hades,\" Artemis says, and Persephone fears that she knows what Artemis is suggesting.",
      "\"He is but a pawn, and he can be yours, Persephone.\"",
      "She has lost herself, she thinks, but she knows that she cannot stand to lose Artemis, too.",
      "So she asks, \"How?\"",
      "\"Your power is the only one beyond Zeus' domain of influence.",
      "Make him feel it, make it infringe on his rules and make him change them.\"",
      "* The truth is that Persephone never falls in love with Adonis.",
      "Oh, she loves him, to be sure, as only one deprived of any other life can - steadily and intensely, but it is not what Aphrodite feels for him.",
      "Still, she chooses to let Aphrodite think that, chooses to let Aphrodite bring Zeus to break his own rules, as only she can.",
      "And when Adonis is given his choice, and chooses Aphrodite, Artemis shoots him with an arrow made out of moonbeams, and places him back under Persephone's power.",
      "Because the Goddess of Beauty weeps prettily and laments her loss, it is easier for Persephone's father to side against his daughter, allowing Adonis to come back to Earth.",
      "And Adonis, a mortal, is given more freedom to go between worlds than Persephone, a goddess, was given.",
      "Zeus can see himself as benevolent because he sees Aphrodite as powerless, and Persephone wonders if perhaps Aphrodite is the wisest of them all.",
      "But Persephone does not just want to win her honors back.",
      "Persephone wants Zeus to know that he has lost.",
      "So she lets him think that he is siding against her, even as he plays fully into her hands, and when he breaks his own rules, it allows Persephone to force him to give her her choice back so she may come and go between the worlds as she pleases, exerting power over both as only she can.",
      "I. Birth (creation).",
      "When she is still a young girl, Kore comes upon a muddy river littered with stones and weed upon which she cuts the soles of her feet.",
      "As she sits there waiting for her skin to heal and form anew, she picks up the mud and fashions it into her own form.",
      "This form, she holds on to as Demeter carries her home and keeps it hidden.",
      "She bides her time, and when she watches Artemis ask Zeus for the boon of sovereignty over herself, asks to be under no man's power, Kore presents the form she's created to her father and asks him to grant it life.",
      "He breathes into it, and in turn, the form breathes.",
      "But when Kore wants to name the creature, to have power over it, Zeus, greedy as he is proud, seeks to lay claim to this creation.",
      "Kore, too young to understand the entirety of Zeus' dominion, refuses to yield.",
      "Demeter intervenes on her daughter's behalf only to be denied, so she pleads before the only power that Zeus, too, must obey.",
      "And the Fates say to him, \"Since you gave the creature its life, you'll derive power from that life, when they worship you and offer sacrifices in your name, but because this creature shall not rival gods, it must be mortal.",
      "And since Kore fashioned its body, let her have it in death, and derive her power from the shades.",
      "And so shall it be with all livings things that must also die, humans and animals alike.\"",
      "And Zeus, in his arrogance, is content to have power over humans' lives, not understanding the power death would come to hold.",
      "Persephone, by creating mortals, in effect, creates Death.",
      "The order of the world demands that mortals be different from Gods, be lesser, but death gives them something that gods can not (must not) ever experience.",
      "Persephone, however, knows (learns), the way Zeus never can, that to exert complete control over her domain, she must experience all that mortals do.",
      "So she becomes the only god to ever experience Death, even before she understands the lure it holds for her.",
      "Death did not exist before this moment when Kore, in her innocence makes a toy and inadvertently creates a world that Zeus can never exert full power over.",
      "Before this moment, Underworld was little more than a prison where fallen gods like Kronus, and Uranus before him, were banished, the only thing marking it from the rest of the Earth being its power to hold people inside it once they had crossed the threshold.",
      "And so her fate is set even before Hades ever lays eyes on her, but no one, least of all she herself, understands this decree yet.",
      "Or its power.",

    "text": "A maiden is born, in time becomes a mother- to bear her own maiden daughter- and, in her age, is the crone, withered, but wise. The spring comes, in time bears fruit and seeds, before, as the year ends, the earth becomes withered and bare. A maiden with no chance to age or a spring with no winter to rest suffer -both die slowly. When Kore was small her mother would walk with her through endless fields, showing her how each grain of wheat was unique, special, and her responsibility. Kore laid on her belly and whispered to seedlings, entreating them to grow, teaching them to break through the earth with care. Her mother would stroke her hair and tell Kore she was Demeter's proudest creation. Kore grew to young maidenhood in a mortal life, aging as all gods do- as quickly as man- but then, breasts high, small, waist tiny, hips only beginning to curve, and widen, she stopped. Stopping aging, just on the cusp of true adulthood physically. She supposed, occasionally, that she should be grateful her mother chose her to be older, rather that being, like Cupid, forever the cherubic toddler his mother had chosen him to remain. Her mind aged and her body remained the same- young, ripe as the grain- and just as untouched dew on a spring morning. She had suitors, both gods and men who aspired to her hand, but Demeter turned them away, desiring to share her daughter with no one, to continue as they were, Maiden and Mother, and endless Spring and Summer. And Kore loved her mother. Loved the Spring. And grew to hate forever. Then there was a summer day, bright and clear, and Kore was torn from the bright blue sky, from Helios's all seeing gaze by a dark man in a chariot and for moments, for the first time in her existence, knew nothing. Kore woke- woke, that was what happened- curled safely beneath a fur on a deep soft bed, black iron forming the support. There were candles, shaky illumination on stone walls, and a warm fire providing dim light for a goddess who had only ever seen the sun. \"You're awake,\" a deep voice announced from the shadows. Kore's stomach clenched deep and low as the voice, an instinctual fear reaction coupled with another, primal reaction, her womb clenching. \"I am,\" Kore responded, identifying the dark, unknowing place as un-awake. The voice approached the bed from the dark corner, coming into view- the same dark, bearded man from the chariot. Kore grasped the fur roughly, pulling it up to her chin as she curled up against the headboard, knees in front of herself protectively. \"Where am I? Who are you?\" He didn't smile, but his eyes changed, warming slightly. \"You're in the underworld, my lady.\" She covered her mouth in shock, \"Am I dead?\" \"No,\" he said firmly, hard. \"I have not harmed you.\" That was important, vital, from his tone. Kore's shoulders relaxed slightly and he came closer. He sat lightly on the edge of the bed, reaching out for her face. Kore flinched. He drew his hand back saying softly, almost sadly, \"I also will not harm you.\" \"Why am I here?\" she asked, voice soft. \"I wish you for my wife,\" he sounded nearly apologetic, touching her knee softly over the fur. \"I.\" She swallowed, then asked, weakly, \"My mother approved?\" \"I thought your approval was more important,\" he said, looking away. He'd been denied then. \"Mine?\" she asked, startled. Pleased. \"Isn't it your life, not your mother's?\" \"But I...\" she shook her head, processing. \"Or do you want to remain the maiden goddess, like Artemis,\" he asked, sincere, but concerned. \"No,\" her reaction was instinctual, real, loud. Then softer, \"No. I do not desire to remain a child forever.\" \"Then be my wife,\" he offered softly, voice gravely, rough, \"Be queen here.\" \"Queen of the Dead,\" she said doubtfully; it was no beautiful title, no enviable position. It was a harsh, cold world, that of the dead. \"The dead do not deserve your scorn,\" he said softly, \"I rule not only Tartarus, but Elysium as well.\" \"And the Asphodel Meadows,\" she retorted, loosening her grip on the fur, letting it fall, \"The blandest place in all existence.\" \"Where only the banal exist,\" he replied, eyes dipping down to her revealed figure before instantly returning to her face, respectful. \"There is little banality amongst mortals.\" \"And less amongst gods,\" she agreed, twisting her fingers, \"My mother will never agree.\" \"You're not a child to be ruled by your mother.\" \"What am I then?\" she asked, meeting his eyes for the first time. They were black. Deep. \"What do you want to be?\" She was quiet for long minutes, eons. Hades remained on the edge of the bed. Unmoving, still. \"Not a mother,\" she whispered eventually, softly, shamed, but truthful. \"I could not bring life to fruition.\" \"Why?\" \"I'm not my mother,\" she said simply. \"But you're asking me to be her opposite, to end what she created.\" \"Life cannot exist without death.\" He replied, sincere, strong. \"Crops grow strong with loam, rich in death. Animals eat other animals, vegetables.\" \"But who will be the maiden if I'm your wife?\" she asked softly. \"There needs to be the maiden and the mother.\" \"But what of the aged? What of the wise old woman who teaches the youth and the new mother their way, guiding them to me in time?\" \"You're rationalizing against me,\" she protested, leaning forward, arguing, \"It's not that simple.\" \"Why isn't it?\" \"Because...even my name means maiden, girl.\" \"So pick another.\" He said simply. \"What?\" she said scornfully, \"Pherein Phonon? To bring death?\" \"You're too literal. Pherepapha. Touch what is in motion- everything must come to rest, Persephone.\" \"You're asking me to leave my mother.\" \"Every child must.\" Persephone stared into Hades eyes, her own blue eyes darkening from the sunshine blue sky to the midnight blue of an endless night. \"Leave me. Please.\" And he left her with a gentle touch to brush her hair back. Persephone leaned back to rest against the headboard, eyes half shutting as she considered. Worried. Time passed in the underworld, more quickly than above ground. Months passed like days in the underworld. Months when the world died. Finally Hermes came, carrying a pronouncement from Zeus, decreeing Hades return Kore to her mother. Kore met Hermes in a dark receiving chamber, deep in the underworld and said, innocence and light, \"Of course, I must comfort my mother. But first, let me say my goodbyes to my host who treated me with nothing but respect.\" She left Hermes amongst the dead and sought out Hades, who, as she had requested had left her to her thoughts. She slipped her hand into the God of the Underworld's, quietly. He did not start; he'd felt her coming. \"You have to return.\" \"I know.\" She replied. \"But. I wish I didn't.\" He turned towards her, startled, \"No?\" \"I heard...I heard once.\" She began, hesitatingly, \"That if you eat the food of the underworld...\" \"My lady Persephone,\" Hades said with a slight quirk of his lips in his still face, \"May I interest you in breakfast?\" \"My lord Hades,\" The Queen of the Underworld, the Goddess of birth and death, Kore and Persephone replied, \"I would be delighted.\"",

    "text": "Hey there, brother. Oh, come on, now's not the time to be looking away. That was earlier, when your eyes fixed on me like you were drowning and I was the only person around here with a life-preserver. I guess I am, in a way. You're new to town, aren't you? Don't worry, we all were once. I'll give you a nudge in some of the right directions, a bit of a steer... Oh, now I cannot believe you asked me that. I am not nice. And as for how I got here... Well, yeah, actually. Maybe that'll help you get this place. Now go and get me a shot of the usual, and then I'll tell you. *** The limo's tyres crunched and bumped on the decaying road surface, jumping from pothole to pothole, stretching the limit of even the once-luxury car's impressive suspension. Hades looked out of the tinted window, through his own tinted glasses. It made the world look dark, but both provided useful protection, these days. Even in the darkness of Hadestown, he wore shades. It added to the effect of his poker face, made it easier to read people, to push them, to intimidate them. Sure, it was ruthless, but nobody else had carved much out of this wrecked land. Some prices were worth paying, for safety, for security, for civilisation and order. \"Hey boss.\" His reverie was broken by Jimmy's piping voice. Hades turned his head slowly towards the henchman. \"I was just wondering...\" Jimmy's words were faltering, rather, as if he was already thinking better of asking but had committed to the sentence and wasn't quite sure how to get out of it. \"What are we doing up here? We must be fifty miles from home.\" \"Visiting the neighbours,\" Hades replied, his voice only just audible above the road rumble outside. \"Heard that the lady who lives here has been feeding the poor, the weary, the huddled masses, out of some roadside diner. Just want to say hello. Pay my respects.\" It was sensible to keep a close eye on the source of any strange rumours near his domain. Particularly when the source was one of the few people who had the capability of threatening his rule. Yes, it was worth a visit. Just out of politeness. The car came to a stop outside of the gutted remnants of a Greyhound bus. The tyres were long flat, and the underside had come to rest firmly against the ground. But the silver metal roof shone in the sunlight, and the sides were freshly painted. The bus company name had been removed and a sign hung over the space. Demeter's Diner. Around the sides, plants blossomed from boxes. Hades took a deep breath and climbed out of the car, looking around. \"Wait here,\" he told Jimmy, who was holding the door open with an eagerness that bordered on the unprofessional. Slowly, Hades walked around the bus, noticing the stovepipe steaming slightly. And noticing the garden, almost large enough to be called a farm, carved out of the hillside behind the bus. Rows of vegetables, fruit. Unlikely combinations at the best of times, but in this blasted scrubland there was more than good luck and stewardship going on. There was threat. Threat to him, and to the stability he had created. Hades completed his tour of the outside of the bus and pushed the door open and climbed up inside. The seats had been ripped out, and a counter put in - even a few tables in the back, covered in neat tablecloths. He took all this in at a glance, and then looked behind the counter. Behind the safe wall of his shades, he blinked, twice. Facing away from him, leaning over the stove, stirring a pot, was the slim shape of a young woman, tight jeans stretched over her rear, her hair falling in a loose light brown ponytail to the small of her back. Not what he had been expecting at all. He took a step towards the counter, and cleared his throat. She turned around and his breath caught. Just that simple motion was more graceful than any dance he'd ever seen. And then he looked at her face. Purity and innocence shone from the most beautiful dark brown eyes. In an instant, the decision was made. She would return with him to Hadestown. All that he had built meant nothing, if he did not possess her. *** Oh yes, totally. Lunchtime customers at the Diner, on average, three. Lunchtime customers who drive up in a filthy great limousine, prowl around and then walk in like they own the place, on average, none. Of course I'd seen him. I'd spent most of the time checking that he hadn't brought any artillery with him. And then working out how I was going to get him off guard. I might have been technically pure back then, but I sure as... here... wasn't innocent. I was nineteen years old. You think I got there without knowing anything? I'll tell you this about Hades: He's as subtle as a baseball bat, but that doesn't stop it working. It's like one of those clocks with a transparent face - you can watch the cogs go around, watch them mesh and turn each other, watch the bits that swing from side to side - but the ticking never stops. It just goes on, hour after hour, day after day. I've seen Hades work his magic. I know every trick, every expression, every half-smile and every frown. I've known them since the moment he stepped out of that car. And yet when I'm in the firing line... *** \"What's good to eat?\" Hades asked, letting his voice rumble out like tectonic plates grinding slowly together. He'd sat down on one of the stools, without even looking at it. \"It's all good,\" the woman said, gesturing at the chalked up menu without turning away from him. \"But the stew's pretty fine, with the fresh baked flatbread.\" \"Stew then,\" he said. He let a long pause stretch, during which the girl made no effort to move to fetch his order. \"Are you Demeter?\" Of course, she wasn't. She shook her head. \"No,\" she said. \"That's mom. She's... busy, right now. Hope I'm good enough.\" Too obvious an opportunity, too obvious a line. \"I'm sure we'll do fine,\" Hades said. \"Just some stew, and the bread.\" He lifted his head, telling her to get on with it, and was pleased to see that she did, turning away so he could admire her narrow waist again, look down her legs to the light tan western boots on her feet. She turned back, a steaming bowl on a tray, bread on a plate alongside. He glanced down at it for a moment, then back up at her. \"I am Hades,\" he said, watching her reaction. Mild curiosity, but no recognition. \"I... look after Hadestown. You've heard of Hadestown?\" \"Oh yeah,\" she replied, revealing perfect teeth behind her smile. \"Just south of here. Not been there. Maybe I will someday. Sounds like a place.\" \"It is,\" Hades said. \"It is a little island of sanity in this torn-up world. A place where people can come and find shelter, work, food. It isn't perfect. Where is? But it is a haven and a hope.\" *** I'd heard of it, and him, of course. From those who passed through, going there, seeking out the safety he offered. And occasionally, those who'd turned back at the gates, appalled by what they'd seen. Turning away from the easy route, and back to scrabbling in the dust for a meagre living. It made me curious. Made me interested. And his voice... that voice that shivers and shakes you and makes you eager to hear it say just one more word. I wanted to come. As sure as I could see the offer coming down the rails, I wanted to come to Hadestown with him. But there was one little problem... *** \"Get out!\" Hades swivelled on the stool, and looked at the woman who was standing in the bus stairwell, glaring at him. Even in the heat, she appeared to be wearing two coats, and her fingers stuck out from green woollen mittens. Her grey hair was fighting a wispy battle to escape from beneath a tatty headscarf, and as she spoke, spittle flew from her lips. \"You filthy waste of space,\" she continued, taking another step up into the bus. \"You don't eat here. You don't come here. You've got your dirty little underground slum. Go back to it. Decent folks don't want you near them. Get out.\" \"Why, hello Demeter,\" Hades replied, unsmiling. \"It is a pleasure to see you again.\" \"Out! And get away from my daughter. And stay away.\" Hades raised his hands, finally letting a smile show. \"I'm going,\" he said. \"After this day, I shall leave you and your daughter here... unmolested.\" He didn't turn to look at the daughter again. He didn't need to. He'd felt her reaction, her understanding, without words or sight. Now it was time to let the spell work. He walked back to the car. \"Jimmy,\" he said, after the door closed. \"A Mexican Aster. Just in case she has second thoughts when she gets here.\" *** I went, of course, at sunset. They'd parked the car just over the hill. I don't know if mom knew that I was going to go or not. She didn't say anything more to me once he'd left, just stomped out to her garden. I went because I wanted to escape. Because I wanted to see Hadestown. Perhaps because I thought I could make things better. Perhaps because I wanted to hear just one more word. A mickey finn. A small yellow pill on the palm of a hand. I looked back at the bus, the light filtering from the window. I took the step. Took the Mexican Aster. It tasted like chocolate. Vanilla and chocolate. He wanted to capture me. I... well... I didn't want to face my mother and say that I chose to leave her. *** Hades sat watching her. She was laid out on his bed, only just showing signs of coming round. He was motionless, but aware of his own breathing and continually of her presence, her frame, her face. She was an orchid sitting in the palm of his hand: he could marvel at its beauty, or he could crush it, free the scent within. Crush it, and know it completely, in the moment of its destruction. He sat watching her and, for the first time in a long while, was unsure of his path. Her eyes opened. His remained hidden. He had never been more grateful of their concealment. He wanted to speak but could find no words to say, so remained quiet. \"Hi,\" she said, breaking the silence for him. Her voice was still blurred from the drug, but there was a languorous air of pleasure too. \"Your mother is coming,\" Hades said. \"She tears the ground where she walks, her garden in ruins. Her passing leaves plants wilted, trees dead, vines barren.\" \"Will you let me go back to her?\" she asked, rolling onto her side to face him. \"No,\" he tried to say, but could not make the word come. He took a breath and forced the words past his lips. \"If I made you mine, you could not go,\" he said, and was proud of the control in his voice. Her eyes narrowed in response and she propped her head up on a hand. \"Why don't you?\" she asked. He frowned. What did she mean by that? Had he worked his will better than he thought? He needed some kind of diversion to allow him to regain his composure. \"Would you like to see my little town?\" he asked, rising from the chair and offering his hand to her. She sat up, reaching out to take his hand, opening her mouth to speak. *** You know when you're just falling asleep, and there's a jolt like the whole world has suddenly dropped a foot? That's what I felt the first time we touched. And I could tell he felt it too. As soon as I was on my feet, our hands parted, and we didn't touch as he gave me the dime tour of Hadestown. But I was thinking about that touch, and I knew he was too. Hey, it's not the kind of thing you stop thinking about. If you think this town is a little grim now, you should have seen it then. The place was full of crap that someone had thought might be useful, or that Hades might want. Burnt-out cars, rusting old appliances. All the stuff that once had some value, scattered around like it had been raining scrap. The people wandered around, working on the wall when Hades could be bothered to make them, but otherwise aimless, dead-eyed and soulless. Sure, this may not be the best place on Earth. Hell, it may be the worst. But you have to live. You have to hope. You know what I thought? I thought I could make a difference. And I was just beginning to get an idea of how. *** Jimmy came up as they finished the tour. Hades was having some trouble breathing, his chest tight, his skin feeling like it had been sandpapered raw. Having her next to him, but being unable to touch her, to hold her, to grab her and pull her to him, was a constant effort. \"She's here, boss,\" Jimmy told him. Hades nodded, and gestured for Jimmy to leave. He didn't need to turn and face her. That connection that had begun in the diner and had grown in the time they had spent together, had shot up in that one brief, painful, cathartic touch, meant that she knew. \"We don't have much time,\" she said. \"She will want me back.\" \"Do you want to go?\" Hades asked, the words escaping from him before he had a chance to consider their impact. \"Kind of,\" she replied, a curious, unreadable smile curving her lips. She beckoned him back towards the house that he had claimed as his seat of government and home. Once back in the bedroom, she turned and faced him. \"Do you want me to stay?\" she asked, taking a step towards him. \"What will you give me?\" Hades blinked behind his shades. Since they had returned to Hadestown, he had not felt in control. Not felt like he was the one calling the shots. He struggled to reassert his will. \"You will be mine,\" he said, \"my consort... my companion. My wife.\" He hadn't planned to say the last words: they had been pulled from somewhere deeper. She cocked her head on one side, her nose wrinkled in thought. \"Sounds good enough to me,\" she said, and stepped closer to him, one finger lifting to stroke against his cheek. Then her finger traced down, along the line of his jaw, down the side of his neck. He stood, motionless, then lifted his hands and slowly removed his sunglasses. His gaze met hers unimpeded for the first time, and they were both still for a moment. Then she reached out again, and slowly undid the buckle of his belt. He leant back against the closed bedroom door, watching her, his shades dangling from the fingers of his hand. She looked down, breaking eye contact, and then dropped to her knees. A moment later, he heard, distantly, the sound of his glasses striking the floor, but he felt no need to pick them up. *** It worked pretty much like I always imagined it would, though there was a moment when I really wasn't sure it was going to... you know... happen. And I was really aware there was a time limit. So, anyway, we're just about done when Mom blows half the wall down. Sure surprised Hades. Didn't mention it at the time, but it kind of surprised me too: I didn't know she could do that either. I just had enough time to check for incriminating evidence in the mirror and follow Hades down to the confrontation. *** \"You filthy, disgusting piece of shit,\" Demeter yelled at Hades, standing just outside of the gigantic hole she had blown in the perimeter wall. He wondered how long it would take to rebuild it, while at the same time holding up a hand to try to calm the vengeful mother down. \"What do you want?\" he asked, when she'd stopped for a moment and was eyeing him suspiciously. \"My daughter back, scum.\" she said. \"My pure, beautiful child that you abducted.\" Hades frowned. \"Pure?\" he asked, wishing for his shades again. \"If you've harmed her I will blow this shithole to pieces and bury it beneath a hundred tons of dirt. And it and all of the countryside around will not flower or bear fruit for a thousand years.\" \"And if she gave herself to me willingly? And wants to stay here?\" He pitched his voice low, trying to soften the words. After all, this was still his sister, however much she hated him. \"She never would.\" Hades raised an eyebrow. \"If she had, would you let her stay?\" \"If she hasn't, will you let her go?\" He nodded, and turned to where she stood watching. \"Have you given yourself to me?\" he said to her. \"Have you?\" Demeter demanded. Her daughter smiled that cat-got-the-cream smile, her lips curving deliciously. \"Kind of,\" she said. *** And that's the story. They argued a bit more, but they eventually decided that I'd tasted just enough of the forbidden fruit that they had to share me. Which was pretty much how I'd planned it. Now I spend half the year here, and half the year with Mom. It works out pretty well. I make sure that I bring some of the outside back with me each time. A little light, the last embers of summer. See, I am the crack in the wall. Now, what was the question you asked? Oh yes. What's my name? I'll tell you my name...",

    "text": "Persephone (Kronoson from both her parents, definitely not married, at least 3rd cousins so that was totally not weird), half scurried past the pool to get to the guest house. If anyone was around to see at 7:00am that Tuesday, they'd probably think she was on a walk of shame considering the wrinkled clothes and the mussed hair. They'd kind of be almost right. Technically. Reaching the door, Persephone hurriedly pushed the doorbell a few times, glancing over her shoulder at the mansion behind her, on the lookout for any signs of obvious activity. The door swung open after a moment, because of course Apollo was going to be awake. He was always up at the ass crack of dawn. For the briefest second, Persephone had to take a moment because all that bronzed glistening muscled torso would distract anyone, probably even if they were happily married and lesbian. She shook herself out of her mild hypnotized trance and jerked her eyes up to look her half-brother (They'd only met like 3 years ago, not grown up together. It wasn't weird for her to notice the abs) in the eye. He looked all together unsurprised. Of course he'd be used to the stop and stare of anyone blinded by the glare of his glistening chest. Persephone rolled her eyes at his smug countenance and looked past him into the guest house. \"Is Artemis awake?\" Apollo just waved her inside without a word which was surprising enough. Artemis was too much of a night owl to be caught awake at this time in the morning. She'd bribed people to make sure she didn't have classes before noon. Persephone had planned on shaking her best friend awake before dragging her out the door. She hadn't expected to see Artemis, slightly too bright-eyed in the way that people who pulled all-nighters looked, sitting at her kitchen in what was obviously last night's clothes nursing what looked like an urn of coffee. Persephone rolled her eyes. Dionysus's drinking rubbing off on everyone in the form of Monday night partying was pushing the envelope a bit. But bacchanalias were really not her current problem. \"Arty. You know besides being the sister I never knew growing up, you're my best friend and I'd never keep things from you without some really good reasons, right? Because I need a favor. A huge important favor, and you need to be awake for it.\" Artemis, eyes still mostly glazed, stared at Persephone, letting the details filter past the obvious hangover. Persephone hadn't been to whatever party Artemis spent the night at. She wasn't the type to party on school nights. So yesterday's clothes were out of place. \"Seph, isn't it way too early in the morning for panicking? You haven't like, killed anybody and need help hiding the body, right?\" Persephone shook her head, because obviously cousin Ares would be the choice for help hiding bodies, before looking out the door to check that Apollo had gone back to whatever his morning workout routine entailed. \"Ok. Look. I need you to come down to the city clerk's office with me. To be a witness. Because I'm totally running off to get eloped in like an hour. And we need a witness for that.\" Persephone could see the words hit home as Artemis finally fully woke up. Her look of horrified glee and desperate curiosity wasn't a new one. She had totally pulled that look back when one of her sorority sisters, some freshman named Callisto, had gotten knocked up 2 months into the school year, father unspecified. \"Since when are you even seeing anyone? There's no way I don't know about it. What the fuck?\" The furious whisper carried in the kitchen, and Persephone winced. She hadn't dreaded the question. She was dreading the reaction. \"We weren't going to say anything. Since, you know, I'm still in school and he's supposed to be all respectable and shit. But Hermes totally walked in on us this morning by accident. And that gossipy fuck's going to tell absolutely everyone. And my mother's going to throw an absolute fit. And we were just panicking when I totally just blurted out that if we get married, no one could really do anything about it, and it wasn't like I'm some silly vapid girl who'd quit school over it or anything. And I'd totally sign something so it didn't look like he was taking advantage of me or anything. And you're signing that too as our witness. So he totally agreed and now we're running off to get married before I have to get to my lecture.\" Artemis just stared at her, obviously ready to wait till she got her answer. Persephone squirmed uncomfortably, halfheartedly wishing for lightning to strike her somehow while she was standing indoors. As long as it put off her next words... \"It's Hades. I'm getting married to Hades.\" Persephone winced at the shriek and desperately looked out the window to make sure that Apollo was still outside. He was toweling at his torso (or rubbing olive oil into his skin or something. Seriously, could he glisten more?) and didn't seem to have noticed his sister's unholy excitement. Persephone decided that considering she'd be married in a hour or so, it probably wouldn't do to continue ogling other people. Especially if they were cousins. Even if they were that hot. \"Uncle Hades? You're talking about our creepy uncle who'd even older than our father? Seriously? What the fuck? When did that happen?\" Artemis's voice was reaching shrill levels. Persephone wanted the floor to cave open so she could fall into hell where people were probably less judging than her family. \"It's not like he's actually my uncle. He's father's wife's brother. Is that like a step-uncle? It's not like Hera's anyone's step-mother. And he's like mother's fourth cousin. So he's far enough away on the family tree for it to totally be legal.\" \"You're forgetting the part where he's twice as old as you. He's older than our father. Since when do you have raging daddy issues?\" \"Zeus is our father. How would I not have daddy issue?\" Persephone found herself shrieking a bit, partly because of the level of panic she was still operating under, partly to math Artemis's pitch. She took a deep breath and lowered her voice. \"Look. Can you please help? You just need to come down to the clerk's office with me and sign as a witness. I can tell you everything in excruciating detail later. I just need to get this done before Hera finds out and hires assassins or something for messing with her brother?\" Yeah, Hera, technically the step-mother if Zeus ever bothered to actually be a father to any of the multitudes of bastards he sired before and after getting hitched for business purposes, was a scary bitch. There were rumors that she had one of Zeus's ex-girlfriends deported back to a war-torn country during a bad week. Persephone must have looked seriously desperate there because Artemis ran a hand over her face, checked her fingers to see how much her makeup had smeared, before apparently deciding she didn't look like a complete wreak. Her clothes, slightly flashy, but not too wrinkled, also passed muster. Artemis chugged the rest of her coffee before standing, grabbing her purse off the counter, and motioned Persephone for the front door. Seriously, best friend ever. They were mostly to Persephone's car before Artemis finally couldn't help herself from asking the first of many question that would be coming that day. \"How did this even happen? Since when were you hooking up with creepy Uncle Hades?\" Persephone looked a little embarrassed and she pushed her friend into her car before sliding in herself and starting the engine. \"Remember that family business party we were all at like 6 months ago where Dionysius spiked the drinks and I got totally plastered? And I started flirting with Hades before spilling like that entire punchbowl of POM down the front of his pants? He was just drunk enough to admit being interested while I tried helping him clean up. \" Artemis rolled her eyes, muttered something under her breath about how she was in no position to judge, but really, Uncle Hades? Persephone just hit the gas and hoped she'd have papers signed before Hermes's gossip circle got back to her mother.",

    "text": ".. ~ Book 1 ~. I suppose it was after all a case of all's well ending butter-side up, or Love's Triumphantly Gleaming Chariot carrying off the floating cream of the spoils of war and all that, but for most of it one couldn't see the forest for the canoes, if you catch my angle. The canoe-paddling commenced the afternoon that not one but two scathing holo-telegrams arrived simultaneously... Actually, before I go into all that and unravel the yarn from the beginning, would you mind tossing me a bit of the old indulge and allow me to soapbox? Over the years I've read up quite a lot on the wedlock state, don't you know, and became a bit of an expert if I may say so. Find it a bit chafing that, like tie-widths, tattoos, and hats, matrimony through the ages cycles between various orthodoxies: either no one troubles to get wet, or it's a sought-after splash restricted to the few, or there's a high tide of voluntary joining to whomever and whatever one fancies, or there's a state of dangerous undertow where a singleton is considered a halfleton until they are fettered to whomever one's aunts deem suitable. Our modern age, despite its holos and androids and plethora of technological marvels, is chin-deep in this last-described, a status quo that I find deplorable and more than unfair. Ahem. Well. The burning missives to which I heretofore referred were from the Twin Horrors Aunt Lydia and Great-Aunt Letitia, who had been clashing and grappling titanically for some years, each regularly elbowing the other out of the way to fling a filly from their endless stable of earnest, sensible-hat-wearing girls at me, each competing to be the one to lasso me into marriage. The most recent roundup was a simultaneous attack, a merciless, dual-brunetted prod that had herded me to the very gate of the corral. However, I now gathered, from the shimmering images and high-pitched invective issuing from the screens that Jeeves held on his--some people use the attributive \"its,\" but that has always seemed unconscionably rude to me--gleaming palms, that somehow my fiancees had collided while ordering their wedding gowns from the same couturier. The resulting explosion, although apparently having the felicitous consequence of fending off my looming matrimonial hobbles, appeared also to have put me in the role of an equine fated for a one-way trip to the glue factory. As both Great Aunt and Lesser Aunt began to summon me to their satellite of choice for a Good Talking-To, I gave Jeeves the eye signal that I knew he would correctly interpret as Activate Solar Flares! After the aunts had been fended off with static--Jeeves' metallic extremities conveniently substituting for obstreperous sunspots--I asked, \"Was that your doing?\" \"What, sir?\" As always, his face was a model of innocence. He really was a marvel of design. \"The wedding shoppe imbroglio.\" \"Well sir, \" he replied, moving to the sideboard to mix me a cocktail, \"any young lady desirous to espouse a person of your elevated status and breeding should acquire her accoutrements from impeccable sources.\" Rather than use the replimat, Jeeves was doing that quaint thing with the bottles of various ancient liquids that adds such je ne sai quoi to our domicile. \"I suppose you're right.\" \"Thank you sir.\" He brought the tray with my drink. \"I certainly implied as much to the young ladies when they individually consulted me on proper betrothal and matrimonial etiquette.\" \"Did you now?\" I sipped the ambrosia on ice he had prepared. \"Yes, sir. At their request, I also provided each of the young ladies the precise time that the very limited Collector's Edition pre-order gown designs would be downloaded to the Wedding Biometrics Boutique on New Mars.\" After a pause he added, \"It appears that both were punctual.\" \"Mighty waters deluging each other and whatnot, I suppose?\" \"Precisely, sir.\" He moved to the wardrobe to retrieve my dinner ensemble. \"So I'm no longer wriggling in the traps, then? That's jolly good news. Jeeves, you've saved me from the noose once again! I feel like celebrating!\" \"If I might suggest, sir,\" Jeeves said, using the ion brush on my favorite carbonite jacket, the one with the black buckyball buttons, \"it might be prudent to celebrate in such a manner that it affords you a small hiatus from familial contact.\" \"Run away from Aunts Lydia and Letitia, you mean?\" I considered it. \"Absence to make their hearts grow fonder?\" I set down my empty glass and slipped into the proffered jacket. \"If you prefer to conceptualize it in such terms, then yes, sir.\" \"Hm. How much fondness ink am I trailing in the L-and-L credit column, do you suppose?\" \"It's possible that they shall need to invent a new shade of red for it, sir.\".. ~ Book 2 ~. To pass the time until Jeeves found a suitable place for me to flee to, I faxed myself over to the Lunar Gnat Club. There was some boisterousness involving long stalks of celery and blue-violet paint going on in the front room, so I nipped off to the back where it was quieter. A fellow with flowing yellow hair and a turquoise brocade waistcoat--Lord Harlowe Melis Nealon XXIII to his family, Melon to sundry all else--was draped over a chaise overlooking the spaceport, the lower half of his face half-buried in the crook of his elbow. \" 'ullo, Bertie,\" he said with complete dejection as I plopped down next to him. \"What's the lugubri all about?\" I asked. \"Last time I saw you you were over the clouds, writing poems for that red-haired mathematician - Isabel was it?\" \"Oh, she's... she's run off with a Grothendieckian topologist.\" Melon burrowed his face further into his arm. \"Said she wanted someone with a more aesthetic temperament.\" \"Hard luck that,\" I offered. I wasn't sure what a Grothendieckian was, but didn't think it would cheer Melon much for me to inquire about what particular quality had been responsible for luring away his lady love. Some of those alien chaps--especially the ones with tentacles--seem to exert a weird, Svengali-like charm over the fairer sex. \"Buck up, though. Ocean is vast, plenty of fish, etcetera. A refined fellow like you--you'll reel another into the basket in no time.\" \"I suppose,\" Melon mumbled from the depths of his sleeve. \"I'm all at tens and elevenses, though. This thing with Isabel has cut me so cruelly, cruelly deep that life has entirely lost its luster.\" He sighed--or at least I assume he sighed, since his shoulders humped up and then deflated. \"I shall never love again.\" \"Oh bosh!\" I chided. I'd heard this same lament from Melon so many times that I continue to be surprised they haven't named a day of the week after it. \"Come jaunting with me. Have some adventure! That'll cheer you right up!\" Melon turned his head and asked me from behind the curtain of his fashionably draped hair, \"Are you intending to travel just as the season is about to start? Whatever for? Did you make one of your aunties angry again?\" \"Well... I suppose I did,\" I admitted sheepishly. \"But really, I had no choice. The situation was rapidly converging on bloodshed, and it was either extrication or annihilation.\" \"Ah... she tried to fix you up again?\" \"Not a singular she, old man, a plurality of Shes. To Aunt Lydia and Great-Aunt Letitia I am less a nephew than a coveted loving-cup that proves their matchmaking moxie. Knowing those two, they probably would have split me in twain with a scimitar so I could marry both girls--a fate that's probably twice as probable now that the weddings are off.\" \"Sounds frightful.\" \"It is, indeed it is. You've heard how Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned? I can testify that it most certainly does--scorned women haven't got a patch on dowagers denied.\" \"So you're going to go incog until they're distracted by some new project?\" \"Preferably one not involving me,\" I said, fervently hoping that wishing would make it so.. I dragged the melancholic Melon back to chez Wooster for one of Jeeves's miraculously refreshing antique beverage concoctions. We arrived to find my traveling cases already packed and aligned in a neat row in the foyer. \"That was quick,\" Melon said. \"Yes, sir. Embarkation is in two hours.\" \"So are you accompanying?\" I asked Melon. \"Come on! It'll be a jolly lark!\" \"I suppose. I'll have some cases packed and meet you at the 'port.\" \"Splendid!\" \"I'll have to tell chere mere where I'm off to,\" Melon said, flicking up Willoughby Manor on his hand. \"Where are we off to?\" \"Where are we off to, Jeeves?\" I asked. \"A subspace tour of cultural sights in the Atargatis system of the Messier-74 galaxy, sir. On board the luxury starliner Mycenaean Maiden.\" \"Cultural sights? Really?\" Melon grimaced. \"Museums and libraries. Abominably early risings. Excursions requiring sensible spaceboots. You propose to salve my broken heart by boring me to death?\" \"Not at all sir,\" Jeeves replied smoothly. \"I am assured that all activities are entirely voluntary. And the NeoMetaZagat regularly awards the Maiden's various restaurants, brasseries, and boulangeries an eight zvijezda rating.\" \"Well, it may suffice, if I can force myself to eat anything,\" Melon interjected, then turned back to the holo and said to his mother's frowning image, \"I'm sure it will be entirely edifying. Temples and nature preserves... No, no nightclub singers or dancers. All vestals and eunuchs and crones.\" \"So there'll be plenty of un-replicated comestibles,\" I said uncertainly, \"But--really Jeeves, were there no other alternatives for escaping the descending wrath of L-and-L? Alternatives leading to less dull a destination?\" \"In such exclusive surroundings,\" Jeeves said, \"it is possible that that there might be members of the Lunar Gnat Club aboard.\" \"Oh? Such as?\" I asked. \"Archduke Nathaniel Evars Gaffy, Viscount O. Colmy Jackson, and Lord Oscar G. Naumann.\" \"Negsie and Cornpie and Ogger!\" I suddenly felt an infusion of enthusiasm. \"Well, that would be uplifting! We ought to be able to get a crackling good Freehand Quint game going then, if they have a few spare coconuts on board.\" Melon seemed to be wrapping up: he was now placating, sotto voce, \"Yes, yes, maman, I'll make sure to pack dosimetric patches and extra sweaters.\" \"A less-sophisticated and inhospitable galaxy also has the inestimable advantage of being an unlikely place for your aunts to alert their agents to look for you, sir.\" \"That's... well, all right, you've got me. I concede the point.\" I had the distinct sense that there had been some mild reprobation flavouring Jeeves' statement, but as it had not reached white jacket or mustache level I decided to let it go. \"How much less sophisticated and hospitable?\" \"The Atargatissians are a relatively young civilization of dimorphic sentients whose primary activity for much of their history seems to have been raiding each other's settlements, sir. They just recently developed interplanetary travel, the primarily use of which seems to be to raid each other's settlements on other planets. They have an unusually complex value system surrounding the concepts of--\" I sighed. Jeeves' vast databanks were often invaluable, but he did have a tendency to give rather more information than was needed. \"And they're far away?\" \"Quite far, sir.\" \"Will there be danger?\" \"A luxury starliner's passengers are not likely to be affected by local events, sir.\" \"Well then, let the epic adventure begin, Jeeves!\".. ~ Book 3 ~. \"I can see why not many go gallivanting among the stars, Jeeves,\" I said as we approached the departure location. \"Those grasshopper-looking vehicles look neither safe nor roomy.\" \"They are merely an intermediary,\" Jeeves explained, somehow managing to maintain his aplomb even whilst the spaceport security force was torquing off his access panel to check him for--well, whatever they were checking him for. Contraband consumables or fusionable material, I suppose. \"These shuttlecraft will transport us up to where the starliner is docked.\" \"And that's where we'll see the luxury accoutrements displayed so enticingly in the advertising materials?\" \"I am most certain of it, sir.\" As the security force re-attached Jeeves' access panel I looked away to give him a moment to recover his dignity, and saw my old chum Melon hurrying toward us with his traveling cases. Now, ever since our old school days I had been quite fond of Lord Harlowe, who--the opinion of a certain fickle red-haired mathematician notwithstanding--rather enthusiastically styles himself after the poppy-and-lily Aesthetes of centuries past, with the result that he is generally the brightest peacock in the garden. His one flaw, if indeed it is a flaw, is his fervent belief in the egalite of all the colors of the spectrum as appropriate for use in raiment and hair dye. Thus I was not surprised to see that the relatively sedate blond-and-turquoise combination he'd sported at the LGC had been discarded for a scorching orange jumpsuit that--well, if I say it \"set off\" his newly-magenta hair, you'd not be blamed for recalling that there is a denotation of that phrase that refers to explosives. I noticed a very faint tremor go through Jeeves' manufactured frame at the sight of Melon, and he irised down his visual receptors in a way that made me a tad envious: still, one must stand by one's friends, no matter how radioactive they may appear to be. \"What ho, Melon!\" \"Bertie!\" he said. \"Sorry to be so last minute, I was fending off histrionics. Wasn't sure I'd get out of ma maison before matricide ensued.\" He shook his amaranthine curls and smiled at the curvaceous porter who was taking charge of his cases. Then off we went into the flimsy grasshopper, and though I do of course trust Jeeves in all matters of fact and most matters of aesthetic, my doubts sprang anew once we rose above the fuzzy blue ball of home and glided toward a large but severely unimpressive object. \"Jeeves, it's a flimflam!\" I said. \"There's no luxury about that thing--we're just going to be shoved into an enormous cannon and shot across the heavens! And it's a severely scuffed and dented cannon to boot!\" \"I believe that is the space station docking ring, sir,\" Jeeves reassured me, and indeed as we passed over the bumpy dull landscape, a glittering moon--if moon is the word to use for an assemblage of balls and rods and gauzy golden sail-like things coruscant with ripples of light--was de-eclipsed. \"That, sir, would be the Mycenean Maiden,\" Jeeves added soothingly. \"Well, Jeeves, I stand corrected,\" I said. \"It is rather lux. Do those sparkly bits actually do something, or are they for show?\" \"The 'sparkly bit' in the center is the quantum vacuum boson drive, sir, which draws its power from the supercharged filament plasma contained in the glowing spheres--\" \"Yes yes. I suppose you know what the dratted thing weighs, too, don't you?\" \"The cruiser has a 1-G weight of over 375,000,000--\" \"Oh, now you're just showing off, Jeeves. Things you've memorised from the brochure.\" \"My apologies, sir.\" Jeeves sounded chastened, but I knew he knew that I appreciated him.. I was soon surprised to discover that taking a cruise through space would be quite a lot like taking a cruise on good old terra firma. Of course, instead of a promenade deck that assaults one with watery spray, rows of clammy deck chairs, and green-faced passengers trying to be discreet about upchucking over the rail, there were narrow viewing corridors that gave one a view only of the sub-zero airless vacuum that would kill one in an instant, but really, once I was escorted past that--well, you could have knocked me over with an eighth of a feather. The hallways were wide, the carpet was lush, and the fixtures would not have looked amiss in the Winter Palace hotel. By the time we arrived at our stateroom--sitting area, three bedrooms, an opulent bath--I must have been gawping like a fish, because Jeeves asked politely, \"Sir?\" \"Well, I suppose I thought we'd be slotted into capsules or somesuch and tossed up on a metal rack.\" \"You will spend a brief sojourn in your personal cryo-stasis chamber during the hyperspace jump to Messier-74, sir,\" Jeeves said, opening a decorative panel to reveal a row of shiny metal coffin-like boxes. \"Cryo-what?\" \"It's a sort of super sleep,\" Melon said, evaluating the bedrooms. \"Eases the strain of gravity and acceleration and whatnot. Keeps the relativity wrinkles off one's brow.\" \"Strain?\" This was turning out to be more epic adventure than I had signed on for. \"Wrinkles?\" \"Not to worry Bertie,\" Melon said. \"I'm a vet of this whole space travel regimen. Commuted to Art School on Callisto... or was it Ganymede?\" He pushed the hover-cart with his travel cases though one of the bedroom doorways. \"I'm going to unpack a bit before hopping in the deep freeze. Let's go to the post-defrosting dinner and rub elbows with the hubbubbly hoi polloi--if we're lucky it could be smashing.\" \"Is that what one does in space?\" I asked. \"Of course!\" Melon said, then closed his bedroom door. \"If I might elaborate, sir?\" Jeeves offered. \"It is traditional for a planetbound ship's guests to gather on the night of embarkation for a formal dinner, at which time they are greeted by the ship's captain and crew officers.\" \"Oh, right you are, I've done something like that back home on the old Sol-Three.\" \"With a spaceship, it's more common for such a gathering to take place after the hyperjump has brought the ship to its intended destination.\" With the merest flick of his eyes toward Melon's door he added, \"In either venue, it's an excellent opportunity for passengers to... locate old friends and make new acquaintances, sir.\" \"Ah, yes.\" I could see Jeeves' meaning--Melon's presence would be like a blazing lighthouse at sea, drawing all eyes to our table. \"Do you suppose Negsie and Cornpie and Ogger will attend this dinner?\" \"I could not say, sir.\" I won't bore you with the details of the sleeping and thawing process--it's likely you're familiar with it anyhow--or of the dinner itself, except to say that as expected, our table was like the judges' box at Crufts, with a steady stream of well-groomed (and mostly well-leashed) hopefuls shimmering past in hopes of snagging a ribbon. Nothing caught the love-scorched Melon's eye, however, and as the trio of my fellow Lunar Gnatters were still no-shows--my hopes for Freehand Quint thereby once again dashed--we considered what to do to amuse ourselves. \"Well,\" Melon said, turning the pages of the ship's programme with some distaste, \"it looks as though our choices are either to attend a revival of some creaky musical called Ask Yer Auntie!, or to actually make honest men of ourselves and traipse through ancient bits on the planet below.\" Normally I'm all gung-ho for Terpsichorean strivings, but this one's title was a mottled heap of ill portent. \"Ancient bits it is, then.\" We marched off to the tour office, and were very quickly swept up in the excitement of signing a virtual sheaf of legal forms, being measured for surfacesuits, and watching an instructional video on how to use the suit's helmet-comm and various other internal amenities. (When I say \"excitement,\" I trust you understand that it was anything but; nevertheless, Melon exactly echoed my sentiments when he murmured, \"Still preferable to Ask Yer Auntie!\") Finally the preparations were complete and we four--myself, Melon, and our inscrutably androgynous guide in white surfacesuits (and Jeeves, of course, sans such)--were clomping noisily down a corridor toward the shuttle bay. As we rounded a corner a figure of distinctly female shape flew at Jeeves and took hold of his arm with a shrill cry of joy. \"A model GVS-15! I haven't seen a Percy like this in ages!\" \"Who are you, and why are you clasping my Jeeves?\" I asked. She was a firecracker, that much I could tell immediately; a bit short overall, and a little too sharp in the nose for my taste, but there was a saucy flip to her short blonde hair that I found mildly fetching. \"Why do you call your Percy Jeeves?\" She looked at the tour guide and Melon, and then back to me. \"And why are you all wearing uniforms? Is this a mining colony?\" \"We're going down to the surface to take a tour,\" Melon said. \"I'll come with,\" the girl announced. \"There might be mysteries to solve down there!\" She pulled something from her pocket, a plastic funnel dangling from a pair of sunglasses, and popped the contraption onto her face. The tour guide, who had watched all of this with growing alarm, looked to Jeeves in supplication. \"If I may?\" he asked, and when the guide nodded in grateful acquiescence Jeeves asked the girl, \"Am I correct in assuming that you are a visitor from the planar dimension B-Atonnia 1011?\" \"Yes,\" the strange young lady said. \"Percies like you come from the Grenville-Pelham catalog!\" \"Indeed we do,\" Jeeves said. \"Might I inquire as to your appellation?\" \"Stella Helena Diana Strong-Hale-Dare.\" \"That's a mouthful!\" Melon said, removing his surfacesuit's helmet in order to shake out his hair. I could see the burgeoning glimmer of infatuation in his eyes. \"Call me Elsie,\" the girl said to Jeeves, seemingly immune to the charms of Melon's Dionysian mane. \"Let's get a move on! The President might be in danger!\".. ~ Book 4 ~. It seemed well-nigh impossible--not to mention a bit rude--to try to divest ourselves of the peculiar Elsie-bird at that point, especially after Jeeves explained that as entities from B-Atonnia 1011 only existed in two dimensions Elsie would not require a surfacesuit to protect her from the hostile conditions of the planet below. Melon offered her his arm as we boarded the shuttle, but Elsie continued to hang onto Jeeves, quite literally slipping into the seat next to him, nattering all the while about cats and xylophones until Jeeves went into energy-saving mode. Melon, who had gone into a sulk--I suppose it was really quite a blow to his ego to be ignored by a girl with absolutely no depth whatsoever--stared out the window the entire trip, leaving me to make increasingly feeble attempts at small talk with the back of the tour guide's head as ze piloted the shuttle. Fortunately our cheery caravan landed on the planet after less than a quarter of an hour, and after those of us wearing surfacesuits double-checked our seals and gauges and what-not, the shuttle door was opened and we stepped out onto alien soil. Well, not so much soil as a carpet of tiny black rocks and bones that sloped down and away from us in a somewhat beach-like fashion toward the sea-like part, which wasn't a place a Wooster would want to lounge and take the sun between refreshing dips. Both sky and water were a dark greenish-black, the towering thunderheads above as forbidding as the rough surf below. The oppressive mood should have been counteracted by the thin line of silvery light that rimmed the horizon, but, far from having the sort of cheery effect that the sun edging through heavy clouds can have on one, this crack in the gloom somehow conveyed the impression that one was merely a defenseless oyster in a shell about to be shucked. As if all this bleak wasn't enough, there was also a strong wind, and I was struck by the wisps of greenish gas rippling the fabric of my surfacesuit's sleeve just how thinly we were escaping toxic death from moment to moment. It gave me pause, I can tell you. Death snips proud men, and time's withered branch, and the flame of life so fickle and wan, and so forth. One expected to see the ferryman emerge from the spray at any moment, and I admit to feeling a not-inconsiderable qualm that I had no coin readily at hand. There was a sudden crackling sound in the visor of my suit, startling the internal systems into action a bit, but rather than a bolt of divine judgment it was only our guide, suggesting we turn our attention to our right, where at the seaward end of a low rocky promontory a circle of ancient pillars was topped by the weathered remains of a small dome. \"Those ruins are thought to be a shrine to owl-less's planetary deity Zanath'kona,\" the guide began. \"Owls?\" Melon asked, tilting his helmeted head quizzically. \"No owls here!\" Elsie said, removing her funnel-enhanced sunglasses. \"There could be fish, though. They're sneaky.\" I glanced over at Jeeves, and I knew that he and I were having the same thought--that, saucy flipped hair or no, this alien girl was one of the oddest ducks we'd ever encountered. The guide went on to say that the planet was said to be the mythic final resting place of Atargatissian heroes fallen in battle and Melon asked, \"So it's an aquatic Valhalla? Good call, as it's rather too soggy for hellfire.\" \"Hellfire like that?\" Elsie asked, pointing to a thin red line wavering down toward us from the angry sky.. The hellfire turned out to be a second ship--seeming, as it passed overhead, much larger than our own tiny shuttle--which landed some distance beyond the far side of the little rotunda. After some moments there was motion: a door opened, a ramp lowered, and several tiny figures appeared and began to move toward the rotunda. I have to say, I've seen many strange chappies in my day, but those were among the strangest of the lot. As they got closer I could see that their surfacesuits were made of a shiny greenish-silver material, very tight in the chest and arms, with both legs encased in a sort of--bent gliding tube, I suppose I would describe it. Their helmets, by contrast, were oversized, with a corona of antennae jutting up and a massy tangle of wires or somesuch hanging down over their shoulders. \"Alien suit design,\" I said. \"Innovative, I suppose?\" \"They're not owls,\" Elsie said. \"Actually, sir,\" Jeeves began, but Melon beat him to the draw. \"Good grief, they're mermen!\" he said. It was as though I'd had a whack on the side of the head that jostled my brain back into place. I know I'm far from the fastest biscuit on the deck, but even so I couldn't understand how I could ever have mistaken the tails for... well, anything but tails. Bent gliding tubes indeed! \"So they aren't wearing surfacesuits?\" I asked, wondering what the approach of so many bare-chested men would have on the lady--or ladies, as I still hadn't sussed out our guide's gender--in our party. \"No sir,\" Jeeves replied. \"As this is their home system, the Atargatissians apparently find this planet's atmosphere breathable.\" A group of five split from the main contingent and crossed to our side of the promontory, heading right toward us. I could now see that what I'd taken as wire was probably hair of some sort, although I still couldn't quite tell if the corona of antennae was actually part of each merman's forehead or merely a bony tiara-like crown... As they continued to approach, all other consideration fled as I realized that they were easily twice my height. And each carried a rather lethal-looking trident or spear. The group stopped thirty paces or so away, and made loud and extremely discordant noises, accompanied by forceful gestures that were highly suggestive of disembowelment. It was at that moment that I began to feel that returning home and facing my aunts' wrath might not be such a horrendous fate compared to death by burly alien mermen, but as always when I am in my most desperate straits Jeeves performed miraculously. After a brief communication with the tour guide, Jeeves stepped forward and, spreading his bronze-colored arms, began to emit his own series of unpleasant sounds, an action that, far from goading the mermen into attack, seemed to give them pause. After a moment the largest and tallest of the mermen--the leader, if the considerable number of armbands and the very impressive cloak he wore were any indication of his status--nodded curtly and made a gesture that looked to my eager eyes like nothing so much as \"All right, get along then!\" Jeeves bowed slightly, turned, and then began to hurry back toward us, broadcasting quietly via the helmet radio, \"I told them we meant no disrespect and would withdraw to our shuttle. They indicated that they will consider that to be a sufficiently respectful distance.\" \"Great frosted catamarans, Jeeves,\" Melon said with fervent admiration, \"you don't say you speak their lingo?\" \"I took the precaution of downloading several Atargatissian language expansions before we left, your lordship, so as to be prepared for just such an exigency as this.\" \"Dashed good idea, Jeeves,\" I said. \"As always.\" \"Thank you sir,\" Jeeves said quietly, and though I know it was my imagination, I could not help but hear a tone of sincere gratitude in his voice. \"I do strive never to disappoint.\". Our tour guide wanted to return to the starliner forthwith, but the rest of us--having just been saved from an unpleasantly barbaric demise--oddly enough were all of a mind to stay and gawk at the mermen. Melon produced an antique miniature spyglass, which worked quite well for long-range observation. \"That big chappie with the cloak and the bracelets,\" I asked Jeeves. \"Is he the leader?\" \"Yes, sir, I believe so. He referred to himself as Vashtar Ka'gamu, though I am uncertain if that is a name or a title.\" \"Quite a sense of style, eh?\" I said. \"That cape of his--rather swank, don't you think? Draped in such an aggressively diagonal fashion. Quite rakish, the cut of his jib.\" Jeeves had the compressed lip-line and distant expression that usually signaled something that he strongly disagreed with. \"I wonder if there's anywhere out in these parts I could get such dashing garb.\" \"It's likely you'd first be required to defeat several thousand Atargatissians in combat, sir.\" \"Jeeves,\" I said, squinting at the mer-ship, which seemed to be discharging additional passengers, \"I very much suspect that you've just made that up to discourage me from attempting to acquire one of those cloaks.\" \"If you say so, sir,\" Jeeves responded blandly. Melon muttered, \"What in blazes are they doing over there?\" \"Are they fishing?\" Elsie asked, peering around Jeeves to scowl at the mermen, a number of whom had oiled down from the temple to the water's edge. \"Actually,\" Melon said slowly, \"I think... they are. One of them has just speared what appears to be an enormous squid-like creature. Which... they appear to be dismembering and... eating.\" He sounded as revolted as ever I'd heard him. \"Poor polpo!\" Elsie said. \"Should I call the President?\" \"Sadly, Miss Elsie,\" Jeeves said gently, \"I do not think he has jurisdiction in this sector of the galaxy.\" \"Oh, my,\" Melon then said, with such a degree of awestruck worshipfulness that we all turned to him. \"What is it?\" I asked. \"Has a sushi chef appeared?\" \"No, a... a mermaid,\" Melon said, as if in a daze. \"Or rather a... mer-Queen.\" Once I had wrested the ocular from Melon and espied the object of his sudden infatuation I could see that he had, in fact, not exaggerated her charms. The dozen or so mermen who had formed a rough circle bodyguarding her smaller, paler figure did nothing but emphasize how much more graceful and civilized she--and she was, if I might say so, emphatically and abundantly a she--was than the males of her race. \"She must be that brute Ka'gamu's wife,\" Melon said hotly, clenching a surfacesuited fist. \"Oh, if only I were a champion, I would charge madly among them, and rescue her from his monstrous embrace!\" Clearly, the elusive Elsie was now decisively usurped from the throne of Melon's affection. \"Calm down, old boy,\" I said. I could quite understand his cri de coeur, but as I'm unusually fond of the spot between my shoulders that my head has occupied for some years now, I had little enthusiasm for pitting two (or perhaps three: I still couldn't classify our guide) unarmed chappies against a dozen or more giants with tridents and spears. I was in the process of dusting off the old discretion being the better part argument to cool Melon down when the gods intervened. \"Sir,\" Jeeves said with more urgency than I had ever heard him use, \"perhaps it would be prudent to immediately withdraw to the shuttle and prepare for a hasty return to the starliner? My sensors - \" It was at that moment that the world turned to blood and froze... ~ Book 5 ~. Now, when I say \"turned to blood and froze\" I don't mean chunks of pink ice started to slosh about in the sea while a nippy breeze sprang up; I mean, from one instant to the next everything--the waves and the clouds and even the ill wind--stopped moving and turned red, as if the landscape had become an enormous tinted photograph. I'm not exactly known for peeking into the abyss--I avoid Deep and Dark whenever possible--but I must admit that at that moment I flashed back to my boyhood and the old hymn In the Bleak Midwinter and sermons about the Valley of Shadow and locusts raining blood and whatnot, and I became as immovable as Gibraltar. I'm not too proud to admit that if Jeeves and Melon hadn't lifted me up by the elbows and moved me bodily into the shuttle, I might still be out there. As Jeeves began to buckle me in--my hands not yet having received the news that they were still at the ends of my arms--I asked, \"I'm at a loss with machines, Jeeves, but shouldn't there be blinking and revving and ascension into the aether and whatnot by now?\" \"Indeed there should be, sir.\" A moment later our tour guide turned from the pilot's console and said with clear panic, \"The shuttle won't start.\" \"What?\" Melon demanded. \"How can that be?\" Jeeves moved to assist. I was confident that he would get the old girl up and running. \"It doesn't make sense,\" the guide told him. \"Fuel's at 82%, all systems diagnose green, totally green, but when I push Auto nothing happens.\" \"Is it possible to pilot the shuttle manually?\" \"I... ah... that was optional training,\" the guide said fretfully. \"I mean, everyone uses the automatics for power-up and navigation. They're 110% reliable.\" \"Stunning,\" Melon said. \"Do you mind if I try?\" Jeeves asked. \"Please do!\" The guide almost tripped in hir eagerness to abdicate. Then ensued a rapid sequence of switch-snapping and key-tapping, followed by the unmistakable sound of button-poking. \"You're right,\" Jeeves said at last, \"It won't start.\" My world was cloven asunder. Jeeves had... failed? \"It's unthinkable,\" I said, rather more out loud then I intended. \"Can we call the chappies upstairs and have them send someone down to fetch us?\" The tour guide and Jeeves fiddled with the radio, but the people that they talked to on the other end sounded a bit loopy, ranting about spatial anomalies across the quadrant and being locked in prograde synchronous orbit and other incomprehensible flibber-flabber that went over my head. It wasn't until Jeeves looked at me and shook his head that I realized that we were absolutely sitting in the soup. \"Well, that's the orangutan's pyjamas,\" I said, slapping my knee in annoyance. \"Really, what else can go wrong?\" Melon, who was sitting next to a porthole, said in a choked voice, \"Look... outside.\" I unbuckled and went to the other window. Something had risen from the motionless carnelian sea, a craggy sort of pillar draped in dripping black algae. \"What is that?\" I asked. \"Zanath'kona,\" the tour guide whispered. My brain, which was certainly getting a workout taking in impossible sights, gave a jolt and reluctantly comprehended that what I was looking at was indeed a titanic woman, with webbed hands the size of carriages and a head the size of a carriage house and breasts the size of--well, suffice it to say that she was well-proportioned. \"Jeeves,\" I said, \"you don't mean to tell me that we've got to buy that soap about a planetary deity?\" \"Oh yes, sir,\" he replied, nodding, \"There are more things in heaven and earth...\" \"This is no time for the Bard of Ayrshire, Jeeves! What are we going to--\" Zanath'kona opened her mouth and roared a single word: \"KA'GAMU!\" To his credit, the Atargatissian leader waved his people back before gliding alone to the water's edge. The goddess bent her head to consider him, and then spoke more thunderous rumbling. \"What is she going on about?\" Melon asked. \"It appears,\" Jeeves said, concentrating, \"that Vashtar Ka'gamu's behavior has angered Her. She claims that... because he killed one of Her sacred beasts... until She receives... payment, all his ships... are Hers.\" \"She wants them to replace her pet?\" Melon asked. Elsie whispered, \"Poor polpo.\" \"What does that mean, his ships are Hers?\" \"If my interpretation is correct, Zanath'kona has taken control of all spacecraft both on and in orbit around the planet. She is the reason that our shuttle is not functioning, and She has apparently also disabled our starliner.\" \"She can do that?\" I was boggled. \"It would appear She has already done so, sir.\". While Jeeves--accompanied by Elsie and the tour guide--went into the back of the ship to try their luck at decursing the engines, Melon pulled out his spyglass and provided commentary on the activities of the mermen. \"Well, now another one is standing up and making a speech... oh, someone didn't like that, there's a kerfuffle breaking out--oh no, I think she's weeping, the poor thing.\" \"What d'you suppose they're jawing about, then?\" \"Probably picking which poor sod gets the short straw,\" Melon said, \"as I'm guessing they're all out of sacred octopus.\" \"So that's the dash-dash-dot?\" I asked. \"One of them takes the bullet, and we're all free to go?\" \"Seems like.\" Melon straightened up suddenly. \"Hel-lo, what's this? It looks like two of the Trident-and-Fishtail Crew are coming over to talk to us.\". By the time the others had been fetched, the two figures shimmying across the beach were visible without the aid of the spyglass. One was, as Melon had said, an enweaponed merman--but the other was the mermaid. Melon practically tore the shuttle door open with his hands. The two stopped within shouting distance of the shuttle, and we went out to meet them. This close, the mermaid was both more beautiful and more monstrous than she had been at a distance. Bits of her were almost human: huge, almond-shaped dark eyes, high cheekbones, graceful arms and delicate hands, a womanly bosom demurely covered by a Hellenic-style peplos of pearly satin--but all was wrapped in silvery-green skin. And she was half again my height. And from the waist down she was a fish. With thin jade tentacles for hair. Jeeves, of course, offered his duties as interpreter, and discussed most of his responses with the rest of us before replying, but in the interest of speeding this narrative I'll just relate subsequent conversations as if we all understood each other straight off. \"I am A'klos, mightiest of the warriors of Atargatis,\" the male began. \"The goddess of this place demands a tribute, else she will forever hold within her grasp all vessels within her reach.\" \"We have seen the power of your goddess,\" Jeeves said. \"Our ships as well as yours are are becalmed by Her.\" \"Have you many ships?\" A'klos asked. \"We have a sufficient number,\" Jeeves said carefully. \"Then it will be a trivial matter for you to provide the tribute,\" A'klos said. (\"What cheek!\" I muttered.) \"Would not your goddess be more pleased with an offering from your people?\" \"We are few,\" A'klos said, \"simple soldiers all, on our way to right a great wrong and defend thousands of innocent women and children from slaughter.\" He glanced at Melon, who had done nothing but stare at the mermaid and sigh. \"If you will not sacrifice for glory, then sacrifice for love! Provide the tribute, that this princess' many virginal sisters may not be violated by the enemy!\" \"Sisters?\" Melon asked dreamily. \"She has sisters?\" At this the mermaid turned to A'klos and said, \"Surely your words have convinced this valiant stranger to die a warrior's death for me.\" Her voice was a lilting contralto. \"Should not we bestow on him a weapon worthy of his sacrifice, before he is taken to Zanath'kona's realm?\" \"As you wish.\" A'klos turned and shimmied back toward his camp.. As soon as A'klos was out of earshot the mermaid spoke earnestly to us. \"I am Fa'janee, daughter of Vashtar Ka'gamu. My father, the leader of a vast fleet that has gathered here to prepare for war, mocked Zanath'kona and killed the guardian of Her holy place.\" \"Daughter?\" Melon asked. \"Not wife?\" \"I am no one's wife,\" Fa'janee said archly. \"Please continue,\" Jeeves said. \"Zanath'kona, She who rules the crossings, has long called to me to be Her beloved companion. Help me go to Her.\" \"Wait, you mean--?\" I was aghast. \"Why?\" \"l will become an immortal consort. Poets will sing of me for ages to come,\" Fa'janee said. \"But--\" \"The men of my people have many paths to glory,\" she said. \"But what glory can I hope for? Whether in my father's palace in peacetime or as a captive of the enemy, I have no value other than property to be bartered or stolen.\" \"But--\" \"And should I live,\" she continued, \"I would know myself to be the daughter of one who tricked innocent strangers into paying for his sacrilege!\" She glanced over her shoulder; A'klos was returning. \"Please, man of bronze,\" she pleaded with Jeeves, \"stand with me in Her temple and pretend to be the offering! Allow me my honor. Allow me my glory and my immortality.\" Jeeves nodded. Now, you may laugh at me, because although I knew it was a ruse and that Jeeves probably would not come to harm, I still had a knot of fearful worry twisting up my innards about the whole business. And you might think I'm a silly buttercup for being worried over a manufactured servant that had been shipped to me in a box, but if you think that--well, then there's nothing more to be said. You just won't ever understand the tickings of Bertram Wilberforce Wooster XVII at all.. A'klos didn't seem much to care that it was Jeeves rather than Melon who held out a hand to take the highly-jewelled but lethal-looking pointy stick from him. Jeeves told us all to retreat to the safety of the shuttle and then marched toward the temple, A'klos and Fa'janee following behind. The goddess, who had been watching the proceedings with apparent dispassion, waited until the trio had climbed the platform, and then, raising her arms and spreading her fingers, caused a thick whirlwind of mist to swirl around them. There was a cry, a splash, and then the mist cleared, the world came back to life, and Fa'janee was gone.. We all--humans and aliens alike--rushed to the temple. \"My daugher!\" Ka'gamu bellowed. \"Where is my daughter?\" \"The bronze servant was to be the sacrifice,\" A'klos said, \"but Zanoth'kona in her wrath has taken your daughter instead.\" He--well, all things considered, I realize that knelt isn't the word I'm looking for, but it'll have to do - knelt and pressed one hand to a spot of seafoam on the temple floor. \"She was a virtuous female, with a maiden's grace and the heart of a huntress. I swear by my ancestors that I shall return here after my death to be her consort.\" (I was certain that Jeeves couldn't possibly have translated that last bit accurately, but when I asked him about it later he said that he had, and that for the most part the Atargatissians were on the unfathomable side.) \"I'm so sorry for your loss,\" the somber tour guide said to Vashtar Ka'gamu. \"Loss?\" Ka'gamu said harshly. \"There is no loss. The goddess has been appeased. Our fleet can continue onward to glory.\" Melon, who apparently was going with High Dudgeon rather then Grieving Lover, demanded, \"And what will you tell those who ask why your daughter is no longer by your side?\" \"No one will ask. She was a female. Females are unimportant.\" \"Without her,\" Melon said, \"your soldiers would be sitting around pissing in the sand while your ships turned to rust! If not for her, you would have been defeated even before you started!\" Ka'gamu sneered and, with a hissed command to A'klos, slithered with his retinue back toward their ship. A'klos scrutinized Melon for a minute, then said, \"You are clearly inferior creatures, tiny loose-armored ones, yet your passionate hearts remind me of my cousin P'trokos. For this, I shall allow you to leave unharmed despite the offense you gave to the Vashtar.\" He handed Melon his trident. \"A remembrance of me, if we do not meet again.\". You might think our epic adventure was over after that, and you'd be almost right: but there was still an epilogue or two. As we watched the Atargatissian ship rise into the poisonous sky, the tour guide asked, \"What are they going off to fight over, anyhow?\" \"Something idiotic, probably,\" Melon said. \"They strike me as chest-thumpers.\" \"Magpies scrapping over piles of shiny things,\" I said. \"Gems and whatnot.\" \"Bah.\" Melon folded his arms. \"They can keep their trinkets. A woman like Fa'janee - there's the true treasure. Worth fighting for.\" \"They're back!\" Elsie said, pointing. Sure enough, there was Fa'janee rising from the waves, with a Fa'janee-sized Zanoth'kona next to her. The mermaid glided onto the shore, and, bowing to Jeeves, took his hands and said something to him softly. Then, after nodding once to each of us, she unfastened the brooches holding her peplos in place and gave them to Jeeves. I, of course, quickly turned away as the shining robe fluttered to the sand - not looking being the preux thing to do - and didn't turn back until I heard her splash into the sea. \"Bye-bye!\" Elsie said, tossing a handful of sand or seeds or who knows what sprinkly bits of something in a wide arc out over the water; and then, as Melon rapturously snatched up his satiny trophy, the two figures among the waves raised their hands in farewell, put their arms around each other's waists, and dove with tails entwined into the sea and out of sight... ~ Epilogue ~. So we all trudged back to the shuttle--which was now perfectly willing to blink and rev and rise up into the star-speckled aether. \"What a woman, eh?\" I asked Melon, who, after allowing Jeeves to run Fa'janee's robe through a decontamination cycle, had removed his helmet long enough to wrap the fabric around his neck. \"Yes,\" Melon said with a sigh. \"I can't imagine I shall ever love again, after losing such perfection.\" \"You should invite A'klos to the club,\" I said teasingly. \"You two can commiserate.\" \"Humph,\" Melon said, nuzzling the folds of fabric lapping his cheek, but he looked thoughtfully at the trident still propped in the decon chamber. \"Where's Elsie?\" I asked Jeeves, as he and the tour guide made the final preparations for liftoff. \"She announced that she needed to help some clumsy teenaged boys investigate various unspecified crimes, and then folded herself back into B-Atonnia 1011.\" \"How capricious!\" \"Indeed she was, sir.\" As we made our way through the Mycenean Maiden's lushly-carpeted hallways to our stateroom, I said, \"I think I've had enough excitement for one trip, Jeeves. First a nice hot bath, and then I'm thinking of just packing myself into that cryo-can until we get home.\" \"Very good, sir.\". An hour later, as I shucked out of my bathrobe and clambered into the sleeping chamber, I had a thought. \"Negsie and Cornpie and Ogger--they weren't ever on board, were they?\" \"It seems not, sir,\" Jeeves admitted. \"Just a carrot you dangled in your plotting? You're a marvel, Jeeves,\" I said as I lay back on the shiny cushions and eyed the various pads and pokers waiting to descend onto me. \"I'm often told so, sir. Shall I start the sleep sequence?\" \"Before you do... one last question. When the princess gave you the brooches, what did she say to you?\" I held up a hand and added, \"If it's too personal, you needn't tell me, but I do admit I'm curious.\" \"She said, sir,\" Jeeves replied after checking the instrument panel and making minuscule adjustments to the aforementioned pads and pokers, \"that she thought that we both understood what joy can come from a life lived in service of another.\" \"I see.\" A cool mist started to flow in around my feet. \"What are you going to do with them?\" I asked. \"The brooches, I mean to say.\" \"I hope you won't mind sir,\" Jeeves said as the lid started to come down, \"but I thought I might send them to your aunts.\" \"That's an idea!\" There was a tiny prick on the back of my hand, and a deliciously languid blanket of apricity began to settle over me. \"Two aunts, two brooches... it works out nicely.\" Though knowing Aunt Lydia and Great-Aunt Letitia, I suspected they'd find some way to make even the receipt of identical brooches into a competition. \"Yes, sir,\" Jeeves' voice was muffled by the glass. \"I thought I'd send them in a single package, addressed to both, and let them sort it out equably amongst themselves.\" \"Oh, very good Jeeves,\" I said, as I swirled on gentle currents into the cave of Hypnos. \"Carry on.\".. ~ The End ~... first posted 19 Dec 2011; rev 27 July 2020",

      "\"A less-sophisticated and inhospitable galaxy also has the inestimable advantage of being an unlikely place for your aunts to alert their agents to look for you, sir.\"",
      "\"That's... well, all right, you've got me.",
      "I concede the point.\"",
      "I had the distinct sense that there had been some mild reprobation flavouring Jeeves' statement, but as it had not reached white jacket or mustache level I decided to let it go.",
      "\"How much less sophisticated and hospitable?\"",
      "\"The Atargatissians are a relatively young civilization of dimorphic sentients whose primary activity for much of their history seems to have been raiding each other's settlements, sir.",
      "They just recently developed interplanetary travel, the primarily use of which seems to be to raid each other's settlements on other planets.",
      "They have an unusually complex value system surrounding the concepts of--\" I sighed.",
      "Jeeves' vast databanks were often invaluable, but he did have a tendency to give rather more information than was needed.",
      "\"And they're far away?\"",
      "\"Quite far, sir.\"",
      "\"Will there be danger?\"",
      "\"A luxury starliner's passengers are not likely to be affected by local events, sir.\"",
      "\"Well then, let the epic adventure begin, Jeeves!\".. ~ Book 3 ~. \"I can see why not many go gallivanting among the stars, Jeeves,\" I said as we approached the departure location.",
      "\"Those grasshopper-looking vehicles look neither safe nor roomy.\"",
      "\"They are merely an intermediary,\" Jeeves explained, somehow managing to maintain his aplomb even whilst the spaceport security force was torquing off his access panel to check him for--well, whatever they were checking him for.",
      "Contraband consumables or fusionable material, I suppose.",
      "\"These shuttlecraft will transport us up to where the starliner is docked.\"",
      "\"And that's where we'll see the luxury accoutrements displayed so enticingly in the advertising materials?\"",
      "\"I am most certain of it, sir.\"",
      "As the security force re-attached Jeeves' access panel I looked away to give him a moment to recover his dignity, and saw my old chum Melon hurrying toward us with his traveling cases.",
      "Now, ever since our old school days I had been quite fond of Lord Harlowe, who--the opinion of a certain fickle red-haired mathematician notwithstanding--rather enthusiastically styles himself after the poppy-and-lily Aesthetes of centuries past, with the result that he is generally the brightest peacock in the garden.",
      "His one flaw, if indeed it is a flaw, is his fervent belief in the egalite of all the colors of the spectrum as appropriate for use in raiment and hair dye.",
      "Thus I was not surprised to see that the relatively sedate blond-and-turquoise combination he'd sported at the LGC had been discarded for a scorching orange jumpsuit that--well, if I say it \"set off\" his newly-magenta hair, you'd not be blamed for recalling that there is a denotation of that phrase that refers to explosives.",
      "I noticed a very faint tremor go through Jeeves' manufactured frame at the sight of Melon, and he irised down his visual receptors in a way that made me a tad envious: still, one must stand by one's friends, no matter how radioactive they may appear to be.",
      "\"What ho, Melon!\"",
      "\"Bertie!\"",
      "he said.",
      "\"Sorry to be so last minute, I was fending off histrionics.",
      "Wasn't sure I'd get out of ma maison before matricide ensued.\"",
      "He shook his amaranthine curls and smiled at the curvaceous porter who was taking charge of his cases.",
      "Then off we went into the flimsy grasshopper, and though I do of course trust Jeeves in all matters of fact and most matters of aesthetic, my doubts sprang anew once we rose above the fuzzy blue ball of home and glided toward a large but severely unimpressive object.",
      "\"Jeeves, it's a flimflam!\"",
      "I said.",
      "\"There's no luxury about that thing--we're just going to be shoved into an enormous cannon and shot across the heavens!",
      "And it's a severely scuffed and dented cannon to boot!\"",
      "\"I believe that is the space station docking ring, sir,\" Jeeves reassured me, and indeed as we passed over the bumpy dull landscape, a glittering moon--if moon is the word to use for an assemblage of balls and rods and gauzy golden sail-like things coruscant with ripples of light--was de-eclipsed.",
      "\"That, sir, would be the Mycenean Maiden,\" Jeeves added soothingly.",
      "\"Well, Jeeves, I stand corrected,\" I said.",
      "\"It is rather lux.",
      "Do those sparkly bits actually do something, or are they for show?\"",
      "\"The 'sparkly bit' in the center is the quantum vacuum boson drive, sir, which draws its power from the supercharged filament plasma contained in the glowing spheres--\" \"Yes yes.",

      "I was soon surprised to discover that taking a cruise through space would be quite a lot like taking a cruise on good old terra firma.",
      "Of course, instead of a promenade deck that assaults one with watery spray, rows of clammy deck chairs, and green-faced passengers trying to be discreet about upchucking over the rail, there were narrow viewing corridors that gave one a view only of the sub-zero airless vacuum that would kill one in an instant, but really, once I was escorted past that--well, you could have knocked me over with an eighth of a feather.",
      "The hallways were wide, the carpet was lush, and the fixtures would not have looked amiss in the Winter Palace hotel.",
      "By the time we arrived at our stateroom--sitting area, three bedrooms, an opulent bath--I must have been gawping like a fish, because Jeeves asked politely, \"Sir?\"",
      "\"Well, I suppose I thought we'd be slotted into capsules or somesuch and tossed up on a metal rack.\"",
      "\"You will spend a brief sojourn in your personal cryo-stasis chamber during the hyperspace jump to Messier-74, sir,\" Jeeves said, opening a decorative panel to reveal a row of shiny metal coffin-like boxes.",

      "\"If I might elaborate, sir?\" Jeeves offered.",
      "\"It is traditional for a planetbound ship's guests to gather on the night of embarkation for a formal dinner, at which time they are greeted by the ship's captain and crew officers.\"",
      "\"Oh, right you are, I've done something like that back home on the old Sol-Three.\"",
      "\"With a spaceship, it's more common for such a gathering to take place after the hyperjump has brought the ship to its intended destination.\"",

      "\"I could not say, sir.\"",
      "I won't bore you with the details of the sleeping and thawing process--it's likely you're familiar with it anyhow--or of the dinner itself, except to say that as expected, our table was like the judges' box at Crufts, with a steady stream of well-groomed (and mostly well-leashed) hopefuls shimmering past in hopes of snagging a ribbon.",
      "Nothing caught the love-scorched Melon's eye, however, and as the trio of my fellow Lunar Gnatters were still no-shows--my hopes for Freehand Quint thereby once again dashed--we considered what to do to amuse ourselves.",
      "\"Well,\" Melon said, turning the pages of the ship's programme with some distaste, \"it looks as though our choices are either to attend a revival of some creaky musical called Ask Yer Auntie!, or to actually make honest men of ourselves and traipse through ancient bits on the planet below.\"",
      "Normally I'm all gung-ho for Terpsichorean strivings, but this one's title was a mottled heap of ill portent.",
      "\"Ancient bits it is, then.\"",
      "We marched off to the tour office, and were very quickly swept up in the excitement of signing a virtual sheaf of legal forms, being measured for surfacesuits, and watching an instructional video on how to use the suit's helmet-comm and various other internal amenities.",
      "(When I say \"excitement,\" I trust you understand that it was anything but; nevertheless, Melon exactly echoed my sentiments when he murmured, \"Still preferable to Ask Yer Auntie!\") Finally the preparations were complete and we four--myself, Melon, and our inscrutably androgynous guide in white surfacesuits (and Jeeves, of course, sans such)--were clomping noisily down a corridor toward the shuttle bay.",
      "As we rounded a corner a figure of distinctly female shape flew at Jeeves and took hold of his arm with a shrill cry of joy.",
      "\"A model GVS-15!",
      "I haven't seen a Percy like this in ages!\"",
      "\"Who are you, and why are you clasping my Jeeves?\" I asked.",
      "She was a firecracker, that much I could tell immediately; a bit short overall, and a little too sharp in the nose for my taste, but there was a saucy flip to her short blonde hair that I found mildly fetching.",
      "\"Why do you call your Percy Jeeves?\"",
      "She looked at the tour guide and Melon, and then back to me.",
      "\"And why are you all wearing uniforms?",
      "Is this a mining colony?\"",
      "\"We're going down to the surface to take a tour,\" Melon said.",
      "\"I'll come with,\" the girl announced.",
      "\"There might be mysteries to solve down there!\"",
      "She pulled something from her pocket, a plastic funnel dangling from a pair of sunglasses, and popped the contraption onto her face.",
      "The tour guide, who had watched all of this with growing alarm, looked to Jeeves in supplication.",
      "\"If I may?\" he asked, and when the guide nodded in grateful acquiescence Jeeves asked the girl, \"Am I correct in assuming that you are a visitor from the planar dimension B-Atonnia 1011?\"",
      "\"Yes,\" the strange young lady said.",
      "\"Percies like you come from the Grenville-Pelham catalog!\"",
      "\"Indeed we do,\" Jeeves said.",
      "\"Might I inquire as to your appellation?\"",
      "\"Stella Helena Diana Strong-Hale-Dare.\"",
      "\"That's a mouthful!\"",
      "Melon said, removing his surfacesuit's helmet in order to shake out his hair.",
      "I could see the burgeoning glimmer of infatuation in his eyes.",
      "\"Call me Elsie,\" the girl said to Jeeves, seemingly immune to the charms of Melon's Dionysian mane.",
      "\"Let's get a move on!",
      "The President might be in danger!\".. ~ Book 4 ~. It seemed well-nigh impossible--not to mention a bit rude--to try to divest ourselves of the peculiar Elsie-bird at that point, especially after Jeeves explained that as entities from B-Atonnia 1011 only existed in two dimensions Elsie would not require a surfacesuit to protect her from the hostile conditions of the planet below.",
      "Melon offered her his arm as we boarded the shuttle, but Elsie continued to hang onto Jeeves, quite literally slipping into the seat next to him, nattering all the while about cats and xylophones until Jeeves went into energy-saving mode.",
      "Melon, who had gone into a sulk--I suppose it was really quite a blow to his ego to be ignored by a girl with absolutely no depth whatsoever--stared out the window the entire trip, leaving me to make increasingly feeble attempts at small talk with the back of the tour guide's head as ze piloted the shuttle.",
      "Fortunately our cheery caravan landed on the planet after less than a quarter of an hour, and after those of us wearing surfacesuits double-checked our seals and gauges and what-not, the shuttle door was opened and we stepped out onto alien soil.",
      "Well, not so much soil as a carpet of tiny black rocks and bones that sloped down and away from us in a somewhat beach-like fashion toward the sea-like part, which wasn't a place a Wooster would want to lounge and take the sun between refreshing dips.",
      "Both sky and water were a dark greenish-black, the towering thunderheads above as forbidding as the rough surf below.",
      "The oppressive mood should have been counteracted by the thin line of silvery light that rimmed the horizon, but, far from having the sort of cheery effect that the sun edging through heavy clouds can have on one, this crack in the gloom somehow conveyed the impression that one was merely a defenseless oyster in a shell about to be shucked.",
      "As if all this bleak wasn't enough, there was also a strong wind, and I was struck by the wisps of greenish gas rippling the fabric of my surfacesuit's sleeve just how thinly we were escaping toxic death from moment to moment.",
      "It gave me pause, I can tell you.",
      "Death snips proud men, and time's withered branch, and the flame of life so fickle and wan, and so forth.",
      "One expected to see the ferryman emerge from the spray at any moment, and I admit to feeling a not-inconsiderable qualm that I had no coin readily at hand.",
      "There was a sudden crackling sound in the visor of my suit, startling the internal systems into action a bit, but rather than a bolt of divine judgment it was only our guide, suggesting we turn our attention to our right, where at the seaward end of a low rocky promontory a circle of ancient pillars was topped by the weathered remains of a small dome.",
      "\"Those ruins are thought to be a shrine to owl-less's planetary deity Zanath'kona,\" the guide began.",
      "\"Owls?\" Melon asked, tilting his helmeted head quizzically.",
      "\"No owls here!\"",
      "Elsie said, removing her funnel-enhanced sunglasses.",
      "\"There could be fish, though.",
      "They're sneaky.\"",
      "I glanced over at Jeeves, and I knew that he and I were having the same thought--that, saucy flipped hair or no, this alien girl was one of the oddest ducks we'd ever encountered.",
      "The guide went on to say that the planet was said to be the mythic final resting place of Atargatissian heroes fallen in battle and Melon asked, \"So it's an aquatic Valhalla?",
      "Good call, as it's rather too soggy for hellfire.\"",
      "\"Hellfire like that?\" Elsie asked, pointing to a thin red line wavering down toward us from the angry sky..",
      "The hellfire turned out to be a second ship--seeming, as it passed overhead, much larger than our own tiny shuttle--which landed some distance beyond the far side of the little rotunda.",
      "After some moments there was motion: a door opened, a ramp lowered, and several tiny figures appeared and began to move toward the rotunda.",
      "I have to say, I've seen many strange chappies in my day, but those were among the strangest of the lot.",
      "As they got closer I could see that their surfacesuits were made of a shiny greenish-silver material, very tight in the chest and arms, with both legs encased in a sort of--bent gliding tube, I suppose I would describe it.",
      "Their helmets, by contrast, were oversized, with a corona of antennae jutting up and a massy tangle of wires or somesuch hanging down over their shoulders.",
      "\"Alien suit design,\" I said.",
      "\"Innovative, I suppose?\"",
      "\"They're not owls,\" Elsie said.",
      "\"Actually, sir,\" Jeeves began, but Melon beat him to the draw.",
      "\"Good grief, they're mermen!\"",
      "he said.",
      "It was as though I'd had a whack on the side of the head that jostled my brain back into place.",
      "I know I'm far from the fastest biscuit on the deck, but even so I couldn't understand how I could ever have mistaken the tails for... well, anything but tails.",
      "Bent gliding tubes indeed!",
      "\"So they aren't wearing surfacesuits?\" I asked, wondering what the approach of so many bare-chested men would have on the lady--or ladies, as I still hadn't sussed out our guide's gender--in our party.",
      "\"No sir,\" Jeeves replied.",
      "\"As this is their home system, the Atargatissians apparently find this planet's atmosphere breathable.\"",
      "A group of five split from the main contingent and crossed to our side of the promontory, heading right toward us.",
      "I could now see that what I'd taken as wire was probably hair of some sort, although I still couldn't quite tell if the corona of antennae was actually part of each merman's forehead or merely a bony tiara-like crown...",
      "As they continued to approach, all other consideration fled as I realized that they were easily twice my height.",
      "And each carried a rather lethal-looking trident or spear.",
      "The group stopped thirty paces or so away, and made loud and extremely discordant noises, accompanied by forceful gestures that were highly suggestive of disembowelment.",
      "It was at that moment that I began to feel that returning home and facing my aunts' wrath might not be such a horrendous fate compared to death by burly alien mermen, but as always when I am in my most desperate straits Jeeves performed miraculously.",
      "After a brief communication with the tour guide, Jeeves stepped forward and, spreading his bronze-colored arms, began to emit his own series of unpleasant sounds, an action that, far from goading the mermen into attack, seemed to give them pause.",
      "After a moment the largest and tallest of the mermen--the leader, if the considerable number of armbands and the very impressive cloak he wore were any indication of his status--nodded curtly and made a gesture that looked to my eager eyes like nothing so much as \"All right, get along then!\"",
      "Jeeves bowed slightly, turned, and then began to hurry back toward us, broadcasting quietly via the helmet radio, \"I told them we meant no disrespect and would withdraw to our shuttle.",
      "They indicated that they will consider that to be a sufficiently respectful distance.\"",
      "\"Great frosted catamarans, Jeeves,\" Melon said with fervent admiration, \"you don't say you speak their lingo?\"",
      "\"I took the precaution of downloading several Atargatissian language expansions before we left, your lordship, so as to be prepared for just such an exigency as this.\"",
      "\"Dashed good idea, Jeeves,\" I said.",
      "\"As always.\"",
      "\"Thank you sir,\" Jeeves said quietly, and though I know it was my imagination, I could not help but hear a tone of sincere gratitude in his voice.",
      "\"I do strive never to disappoint.\".",
      "Our tour guide wanted to return to the starliner forthwith, but the rest of us--having just been saved from an unpleasantly barbaric demise--oddly enough were all of a mind to stay and gawk at the mermen.",
      "Melon produced an antique miniature spyglass, which worked quite well for long-range observation.",
      "\"That big chappie with the cloak and the bracelets,\" I asked Jeeves.",
      "\"Is he the leader?\"",
      "\"Yes, sir, I believe so.",
      "He referred to himself as Vashtar Ka'gamu, though I am uncertain if that is a name or a title.\"",
      "\"Quite a sense of style, eh?\" I said.",
      "\"That cape of his--rather swank, don't you think?",
      "Draped in such an aggressively diagonal fashion.",
      "Quite rakish, the cut of his jib.\"",
      "Jeeves had the compressed lip-line and distant expression that usually signaled something that he strongly disagreed with.",
      "\"I wonder if there's anywhere out in these parts I could get such dashing garb.\"",
      "\"It's likely you'd first be required to defeat several thousand Atargatissians in combat, sir.\"",
      "\"Jeeves,\" I said, squinting at the mer-ship, which seemed to be discharging additional passengers, \"I very much suspect that you've just made that up to discourage me from attempting to acquire one of those cloaks.\"",
      "\"If you say so, sir,\" Jeeves responded blandly.",
      "Melon muttered, \"What in blazes are they doing over there?\"",
      "\"Are they fishing?\" Elsie asked, peering around Jeeves to scowl at the mermen, a number of whom had oiled down from the temple to the water's edge.",
      "\"Actually,\" Melon said slowly, \"I think... they are.",
      "One of them has just speared what appears to be an enormous squid-like creature.",
      "Which...",
      "they appear to be dismembering and... eating.\"",
      "He sounded as revolted as ever I'd heard him.",
      "\"Poor polpo!\"",
      "Elsie said.",
      "\"Should I call the President?\"",
      "\"Sadly, Miss Elsie,\" Jeeves said gently, \"I do not think he has jurisdiction in this sector of the galaxy.\"",
      "\"Oh, my,\" Melon then said, with such a degree of awestruck worshipfulness that we all turned to him.",
      "\"What is it?\" I asked.",
      "\"Has a sushi chef appeared?\"",
      "\"No, a... a mermaid,\" Melon said, as if in a daze.",
      "\"Or rather a... mer-Queen.\"",
      "Once I had wrested the ocular from Melon and espied the object of his sudden infatuation I could see that he had, in fact, not exaggerated her charms.",
      "The dozen or so mermen who had formed a rough circle bodyguarding her smaller, paler figure did nothing but emphasize how much more graceful and civilized she--and she was, if I might say so, emphatically and abundantly a she--was than the males of her race.",
      "\"She must be that brute Ka'gamu's wife,\" Melon said hotly, clenching a surfacesuited fist.",
      "\"Oh, if only I were a champion, I would charge madly among them, and rescue her from his monstrous embrace!\"",
      "Clearly, the elusive Elsie was now decisively usurped from the throne of Melon's affection.",
      "\"Calm down, old boy,\" I said.",
      "I could quite understand his cri de coeur, but as I'm unusually fond of the spot between my shoulders that my head has occupied for some years now, I had little enthusiasm for pitting two (or perhaps three: I still couldn't classify our guide) unarmed chappies against a dozen or more giants with tridents and spears.",
      "I was in the process of dusting off the old discretion being the better part argument to cool Melon down when the gods intervened.",
      "\"Sir,\" Jeeves said with more urgency than I had ever heard him use, \"perhaps it would be prudent to immediately withdraw to the shuttle and prepare for a hasty return to the starliner?",
      "My sensors - \" It was at that moment that the world turned to blood and froze... ~ Book 5 ~. Now, when I say \"turned to blood and froze\" I don't mean chunks of pink ice started to slosh about in the sea while a nippy breeze sprang up; I mean, from one instant to the next everything--the waves and the clouds and even the ill wind--stopped moving and turned red, as if the landscape had become an enormous tinted photograph.",
      "I'm not exactly known for peeking into the abyss--I avoid Deep and Dark whenever possible--but I must admit that at that moment I flashed back to my boyhood and the old hymn In the Bleak Midwinter and sermons about the Valley of Shadow and locusts raining blood and whatnot, and I became as immovable as Gibraltar.",
      "I'm not too proud to admit that if Jeeves and Melon hadn't lifted me up by the elbows and moved me bodily into the shuttle, I might still be out there.",
      "As Jeeves began to buckle me in--my hands not yet having received the news that they were still at the ends of my arms--I asked, \"I'm at a loss with machines, Jeeves, but shouldn't there be blinking and revving and ascension into the aether and whatnot by now?\"",
      "\"Indeed there should be, sir.\"",
      "A moment later our tour guide turned from the pilot's console and said with clear panic, \"The shuttle won't start.\"",
      "\"What?\" Melon demanded.",
      "\"How can that be?\" Jeeves moved to assist.",
      "I was confident that he would get the old girl up and running.",
      "\"It doesn't make sense,\" the guide told him.",
      "\"Fuel's at 82%, all systems diagnose green, totally green, but when I push Auto nothing happens.\"",
      "\"Is it possible to pilot the shuttle manually?\"",
      "\"I... ah... that was optional training,\" the guide said fretfully.",
      "\"I mean, everyone uses the automatics for power-up and navigation.",
      "They're 110% reliable.\"",
      "\"Stunning,\" Melon said.",
      "\"Do you mind if I try?\" Jeeves asked.",
      "\"Please do!\"",
      "The guide almost tripped in hir eagerness to abdicate.",
      "Then ensued a rapid sequence of switch-snapping and key-tapping, followed by the unmistakable sound of button-poking.",
      "\"You're right,\" Jeeves said at last, \"It won't start.\"",
      "My world was cloven asunder.",
      "Jeeves had... failed?",
      "\"It's unthinkable,\" I said, rather more out loud then I intended.",
      "\"Can we call the chappies upstairs and have them send someone down to fetch us?\"",
      "The tour guide and Jeeves fiddled with the radio, but the people that they talked to on the other end sounded a bit loopy, ranting about spatial anomalies across the quadrant and being locked in prograde synchronous orbit and other incomprehensible flibber-flabber that went over my head.",
      "It wasn't until Jeeves looked at me and shook his head that I realized that we were absolutely sitting in the soup.",
      "\"Well, that's the orangutan's pyjamas,\" I said, slapping my knee in annoyance.",
      "\"Really, what else can go wrong?\" Melon, who was sitting next to a porthole, said in a choked voice, \"Look... outside.\"",
      "I unbuckled and went to the other window.",
      "Something had risen from the motionless carnelian sea, a craggy sort of pillar draped in dripping black algae.",
      "\"What is that?\" I asked.",
      "\"Zanath'kona,\" the tour guide whispered.",
      "My brain, which was certainly getting a workout taking in impossible sights, gave a jolt and reluctantly comprehended that what I was looking at was indeed a titanic woman, with webbed hands the size of carriages and a head the size of a carriage house and breasts the size of--well, suffice it to say that she was well-proportioned.",
      "\"Jeeves,\" I said, \"you don't mean to tell me that we've got to buy that soap about a planetary deity?\"",
      "\"Oh yes, sir,\" he replied, nodding, \"There are more things in heaven and earth...\" \"This is no time for the Bard of Ayrshire, Jeeves!",
      "What are we going to--\" Zanath'kona opened her mouth and roared a single word: \"KA'GAMU!\"",
      "To his credit, the Atargatissian leader waved his people back before gliding alone to the water's edge.",
      "The goddess bent her head to consider him, and then spoke more thunderous rumbling.",
      "\"What is she going on about?\" Melon asked.",
      "\"It appears,\" Jeeves said, concentrating, \"that Vashtar Ka'gamu's behavior has angered Her.",
      "She claims that... because he killed one of Her sacred beasts... until She receives... payment, all his ships... are Hers.\"",
      "\"She wants them to replace her pet?\" Melon asked.",
      "Elsie whispered, \"Poor polpo.\"",
      "\"What does that mean, his ships are Hers?\"",
      "\"If my interpretation is correct, Zanath'kona has taken control of all spacecraft both on and in orbit around the planet.",
      "She is the reason that our shuttle is not functioning, and She has apparently also disabled our starliner.\"",
      "\"She can do that?\"",
      "I was boggled.",
      "\"It would appear She has already done so, sir.\".",
      "While Jeeves--accompanied by Elsie and the tour guide--went into the back of the ship to try their luck at decursing the engines, Melon pulled out his spyglass and provided commentary on the activities of the mermen.",
      "\"Well, now another one is standing up and making a speech...",
      "oh, someone didn't like that, there's a kerfuffle breaking out--oh no, I think she's weeping, the poor thing.\"",
      "\"What d'you suppose they're jawing about, then?\"",
      "\"Probably picking which poor sod gets the short straw,\" Melon said, \"as I'm guessing they're all out of sacred octopus.\"",
      "\"So that's the dash-dash-dot?\" I asked.",
      "\"One of them takes the bullet, and we're all free to go?\"",
      "\"Seems like.\"",
      "Melon straightened up suddenly.",
      "\"Hel-lo, what's this?",
      "It looks like two of the Trident-and-Fishtail Crew are coming over to talk to us.\".",
      "By the time the others had been fetched, the two figures shimmying across the beach were visible without the aid of the spyglass.",
      "One was, as Melon had said, an enweaponed merman--but the other was the mermaid.",
      "Melon practically tore the shuttle door open with his hands.",
      "The two stopped within shouting distance of the shuttle, and we went out to meet them.",
      "This close, the mermaid was both more beautiful and more monstrous than she had been at a distance.",
      "Bits of her were almost human: huge, almond-shaped dark eyes, high cheekbones, graceful arms and delicate hands, a womanly bosom demurely covered by a Hellenic-style peplos of pearly satin--but all was wrapped in silvery-green skin.",
      "And she was half again my height.",
      "And from the waist down she was a fish.",
      "With thin jade tentacles for hair.",
      "Jeeves, of course, offered his duties as interpreter, and discussed most of his responses with the rest of us before replying, but in the interest of speeding this narrative I'll just relate subsequent conversations as if we all understood each other straight off.",
      "\"I am A'klos, mightiest of the warriors of Atargatis,\" the male began.",
      "\"The goddess of this place demands a tribute, else she will forever hold within her grasp all vessels within her reach.\"",
      "\"We have seen the power of your goddess,\" Jeeves said.",
      "\"Our ships as well as yours are are becalmed by Her.\"",
      "\"Have you many ships?\" A'klos asked.",
      "\"We have a sufficient number,\" Jeeves said carefully.",
      "\"Then it will be a trivial matter for you to provide the tribute,\" A'klos said.",
      "(\"What cheek!\"",
      "I muttered.)",
      "\"Would not your goddess be more pleased with an offering from your people?\"",
      "\"We are few,\" A'klos said, \"simple soldiers all, on our way to right a great wrong and defend thousands of innocent women and children from slaughter.\"",
      "He glanced at Melon, who had done nothing but stare at the mermaid and sigh.",
      "\"If you will not sacrifice for glory, then sacrifice for love!",
      "Provide the tribute, that this princess' many virginal sisters may not be violated by the enemy!\"",
      "\"Sisters?\" Melon asked dreamily.",
      "\"She has sisters?\"",
      "At this the mermaid turned to A'klos and said, \"Surely your words have convinced this valiant stranger to die a warrior's death for me.\"",
      "Her voice was a lilting contralto.",
      "\"Should not we bestow on him a weapon worthy of his sacrifice, before he is taken to Zanath'kona's realm?\"",
      "\"As you wish.\"",
      "A'klos turned and shimmied back toward his camp..",
      "As soon as A'klos was out of earshot the mermaid spoke earnestly to us.",
      "\"I am Fa'janee, daughter of Vashtar Ka'gamu.",
      "My father, the leader of a vast fleet that has gathered here to prepare for war, mocked Zanath'kona and killed the guardian of Her holy place.\"",
      "\"Daughter?\" Melon asked.",
      "\"Not wife?\"",
      "\"I am no one's wife,\" Fa'janee said archly.",
      "\"Please continue,\" Jeeves said.",
      "\"Zanath'kona, She who rules the crossings, has long called to me to be Her beloved companion.",
      "Help me go to Her.\"",
      "\"Wait, you mean--?\" I was aghast.",
      "\"Why?\"",
      "\"l will become an immortal consort.",
      "Poets will sing of me for ages to come,\" Fa'janee said.",
      "\"But--\" \"The men of my people have many paths to glory,\" she said.",
      "\"But what glory can I hope for?",
      "Whether in my father's palace in peacetime or as a captive of the enemy, I have no value other than property to be bartered or stolen.\"",
      "\"But--\" \"And should I live,\" she continued, \"I would know myself to be the daughter of one who tricked innocent strangers into paying for his sacrilege!\"",
      "She glanced over her shoulder; A'klos was returning.",
      "\"Please, man of bronze,\" she pleaded with Jeeves, \"stand with me in Her temple and pretend to be the offering!",
      "Allow me my honor.",
      "Allow me my glory and my immortality.\"",
      "Jeeves nodded.",
      "Now, you may laugh at me, because although I knew it was a ruse and that Jeeves probably would not come to harm, I still had a knot of fearful worry twisting up my innards about the whole business.",
      "And you might think I'm a silly buttercup for being worried over a manufactured servant that had been shipped to me in a box, but if you think that--well, then there's nothing more to be said.",
      "You just won't ever understand the tickings of Bertram Wilberforce Wooster XVII at all.. A'klos didn't seem much to care that it was Jeeves rather than Melon who held out a hand to take the highly-jewelled but lethal-looking pointy stick from him.",
      "Jeeves told us all to retreat to the safety of the shuttle and then marched toward the temple, A'klos and Fa'janee following behind.",
      "The goddess, who had been watching the proceedings with apparent dispassion, waited until the trio had climbed the platform, and then, raising her arms and spreading her fingers, caused a thick whirlwind of mist to swirl around them.",
      "There was a cry, a splash, and then the mist cleared, the world came back to life, and Fa'janee was gone..",
      "We all--humans and aliens alike--rushed to the temple.",
      "\"My daugher!\"",
      "Ka'gamu bellowed.",
      "\"Where is my daughter?\"",
      "\"The bronze servant was to be the sacrifice,\" A'klos said, \"but Zanoth'kona in her wrath has taken your daughter instead.\"",
      "He--well, all things considered, I realize that knelt isn't the word I'm looking for, but it'll have to do - knelt and pressed one hand to a spot of seafoam on the temple floor.",
      "\"She was a virtuous female, with a maiden's grace and the heart of a huntress.",
      "I swear by my ancestors that I shall return here after my death to be her consort.\"",
      "(I was certain that Jeeves couldn't possibly have translated that last bit accurately, but when I asked him about it later he said that he had, and that for the most part the Atargatissians were on the unfathomable side.)",
      "\"I'm so sorry for your loss,\" the somber tour guide said to Vashtar Ka'gamu.",
      "\"Loss?\" Ka'gamu said harshly.",
      "\"There is no loss.",
      "The goddess has been appeased.",
      "Our fleet can continue onward to glory.\"",
      "Melon, who apparently was going with High Dudgeon rather then Grieving Lover, demanded, \"And what will you tell those who ask why your daughter is no longer by your side?\"",
      "\"No one will ask.",
      "She was a female.",
      "Females are unimportant.\"",
      "\"Without her,\" Melon said, \"your soldiers would be sitting around pissing in the sand while your ships turned to rust!",
      "If not for her, you would have been defeated even before you started!\"",
      "Ka'gamu sneered and, with a hissed command to A'klos, slithered with his retinue back toward their ship.",
      "A'klos scrutinized Melon for a minute, then said, \"You are clearly inferior creatures, tiny loose-armored ones, yet your passionate hearts remind me of my cousin P'trokos.",
      "For this, I shall allow you to leave unharmed despite the offense you gave to the Vashtar.\"",
      "He handed Melon his trident.",
      "\"A remembrance of me, if we do not meet again.\".",
      "You might think our epic adventure was over after that, and you'd be almost right: but there was still an epilogue or two.",
      "As we watched the Atargatissian ship rise into the poisonous sky, the tour guide asked, \"What are they going off to fight over, anyhow?\"",
      "\"Something idiotic, probably,\" Melon said.",
      "\"They strike me as chest-thumpers.\"",
      "\"Magpies scrapping over piles of shiny things,\" I said.",
      "\"Gems and whatnot.\"",
      "\"Bah.\"",
      "Melon folded his arms.",
      "\"They can keep their trinkets.",
      "A woman like Fa'janee - there's the true treasure.",
      "Worth fighting for.\"",
      "\"They're back!\"",
      "Elsie said, pointing.",
      "Sure enough, there was Fa'janee rising from the waves, with a Fa'janee-sized Zanoth'kona next to her.",
      "The mermaid glided onto the shore, and, bowing to Jeeves, took his hands and said something to him softly.",
      "Then, after nodding once to each of us, she unfastened the brooches holding her peplos in place and gave them to Jeeves.",
      "I, of course, quickly turned away as the shining robe fluttered to the sand - not looking being the preux thing to do - and didn't turn back until I heard her splash into the sea.",
      "\"Bye-bye!\"",
      "Elsie said, tossing a handful of sand or seeds or who knows what sprinkly bits of something in a wide arc out over the water; and then, as Melon rapturously snatched up his satiny trophy, the two figures among the waves raised their hands in farewell, put their arms around each other's waists, and dove with tails entwined into the sea and out of sight... ~ Epilogue ~. So we all trudged back to the shuttle--which was now perfectly willing to blink and rev and rise up into the star-speckled aether.",
      "\"What a woman, eh?\" I asked Melon, who, after allowing Jeeves to run Fa'janee's robe through a decontamination cycle, had removed his helmet long enough to wrap the fabric around his neck.",
      "\"Yes,\" Melon said with a sigh.",
      "\"I can't imagine I shall ever love again, after losing such perfection.\"",
      "\"You should invite A'klos to the club,\" I said teasingly.",
      "\"You two can commiserate.\"",
      "\"Humph,\" Melon said, nuzzling the folds of fabric lapping his cheek, but he looked thoughtfully at the trident still propped in the decon chamber.",
      "\"Where's Elsie?\" I asked Jeeves, as he and the tour guide made the final preparations for liftoff.",
      "\"She announced that she needed to help some clumsy teenaged boys investigate various unspecified crimes, and then folded herself back into B-Atonnia 1011.\"",
      "\"How capricious!\"",
      "\"Indeed she was, sir.\"",
      "As we made our way through the Mycenean Maiden's lushly-carpeted hallways to our stateroom, I said, \"I think I've had enough excitement for one trip, Jeeves.",
      "First a nice hot bath, and then I'm thinking of just packing myself into that cryo-can until we get home.\"",
      "\"Very good, sir.\".",
      "An hour later, as I shucked out of my bathrobe and clambered into the sleeping chamber, I had a thought.",
      "\"Negsie and Cornpie and Ogger--they weren't ever on board, were they?\"",
      "\"It seems not, sir,\" Jeeves admitted.",
      "\"Just a carrot you dangled in your plotting?",
      "You're a marvel, Jeeves,\" I said as I lay back on the shiny cushions and eyed the various pads and pokers waiting to descend onto me.",
      "\"I'm often told so, sir.",
      "Shall I start the sleep sequence?\"",
      "\"Before you do... one last question.",
      "When the princess gave you the brooches, what did she say to you?\" I held up a hand and added, \"If it's too personal, you needn't tell me, but I do admit I'm curious.\"",
      "\"She said, sir,\" Jeeves replied after checking the instrument panel and making minuscule adjustments to the aforementioned pads and pokers, \"that she thought that we both understood what joy can come from a life lived in service of another.\"",
      "\"I see.\"",
      "A cool mist started to flow in around my feet.",
      "\"What are you going to do with them?\" I asked.",
      "\"The brooches, I mean to say.\"",
      "\"I hope you won't mind sir,\" Jeeves said as the lid started to come down, \"but I thought I might send them to your aunts.\"",
      "\"That's an idea!\"",
      "There was a tiny prick on the back of my hand, and a deliciously languid blanket of apricity began to settle over me.",
      "\"Two aunts, two brooches...",
      "it works out nicely.\"",
      "Though knowing Aunt Lydia and Great-Aunt Letitia, I suspected they'd find some way to make even the receipt of identical brooches into a competition.",
      "\"Yes, sir,\" Jeeves' voice was muffled by the glass.",
      "\"I thought I'd send them in a single package, addressed to both, and let them sort it out equably amongst themselves.\"",
      "\"Oh, very good Jeeves,\" I said, as I swirled on gentle currents into the cave of Hypnos.",
      "\"Carry on.\".. ~",

    "text": "You sip your cup of sketos until you reach the bitter coffee beneath the foam. The air smells of old smoke; this shop was once an old man's place, you think. In its heyday, this was a place where paunchy men came to drink coffee and catch up on each other's half-grown children, shutting out the sunset together for a few long hours as they smoked cigars down to their fingers. It could be your place, now. The men here are your age, and they drink their sweet coffee and sip watered-down ouzo with a kind of fervid animation that you recognize in yourself--that hungering after something true, something blade-sharp and sublime. They touch one another's wrists, cheeks, palms; every one of them is thyrsus-gaunt and hollow-cheeked with anticipation. It should be your place, but it isn't. They shut the bars in Thebes when the temperance law passed, and you are the voice of law. This is not a place that can be allowed to exist. Your grandfather would tell you--has told you--that you take such things too seriously. He still drinks a snifter of tsikoudia on cool nights, with a bit of lemon rind curled in the bottom of the glass for flavor. \"I've had these bottles in the cellar since I was your age,\" he would say, and then he'd pour a careful mouthful into your mother's glass for good measure. \"See, your mother doesn't mind a sip now and then!\" Your mother comes here when she thinks no one sees, and she returns late at night, smelling of sweat and laden with bottles of ouzo. Once, she brought home a silk stole not her own, and a little fall of pearls scattered over the tiles when she shook it out; your aunts laughed that the stole smelled of men's cologne. You watch a bright-eyed young man down his little cup of ouzo, his free hand's fingers twining in his neighbor's rope of pearls. She is a tall woman, clean-limbed and narrow-hipped, with sequins on her slim gown and her lips painted the red of drying blood. When she finishes her glass of ouzo, her Adam's apple jogs lightly. If you nestled your lips against that long neck, if you pressed your nose into the crook of her jaw until you could feel the slight roughness of her skin from chin to ear, would you smell perfume or cologne? When she and her neighbor leave the quiet little bar, when she draws off her pearls and undoes her gown, does she press against his chest and draw his arms around her? Is she a woman, when she stands unclothed, her lips painted and her hair curled just so?--for when her lacquered nails tap against her glass, you understand that she can be no other thing than a woman. She meets your eyes over the crowded room, raising her glass to you. It isn't a toast, for all there is something like respect in it; it isn't a toast, when duellists salute one another and then begin to pace off the ground between them. She drinks deep, and her lips leave no print on the lip of the glass. They would leave no mark on your skin, if she put her mouth to your neck; her teeth might tear at your skin, and you would emerge from her ministrations whole and purified. She would drive you through madness and into the perfect clarity beyond it. You didn't come here to stare at men in gowns. You can't remember what you came here to do. At the piano in the corner, a young man picks out the very beginnings of a tune; you know nothing of music, and even less of the jazz that has come filtering over the Atlantic like cigar smoke over a stretched-silk screen, but even you can hear that the man has lost his way. He plucks at a few melancholy chords, a few single notes falling on the still air in sequence, but none of them replete him. \"Oh, darling,\" murmurs the woman, rising with her drink still in her hand. She bends down to kiss her friend, her lover or her votary, and then she glides across the floor as though her skirt scarcely hobbles her. You have seen women walking in those skirts, all long, white legs encased in whiter stockings rolled down to to the knees, patent-leather shoes with the soles worn down from dancing. When she walks, though, there is a hint of goats' feet on distant hillsides in her gait. There is something inhuman to her that you can't name and don't want to name, but it makes your throat go dry and your eyes water. She sits upon the piano bench, laying her hand upon the pianist's thigh. \"There's music in you,\" she whispers, although you can hear her as though she's whispering in your ear instead of his. \"Let's draw it out, shall we?\" When he touches the keys again, he's a different man. Sweat bleeds down his face, soaks the collar of his shirt and turns it damp and translucent. Each tendon in his neck shows through the cotton, drawn in lengthy shadows when he tilts his head against the lamplight. His song plucks some sympathetic chord within you, until your whole self vibrates with the need to respond to that resonant charge--your feet ache to dance; you feel that ache from arch to sternum, and with each beat of your heart that ache deepens until you think it must split you apart. The woman's glass has begun to bead with moisture. It catches in the web of her hand and spills over the back, and those glistening droplets slide down her wrist when she tilts her head back to drink. You don't remember when she refilled her glass--but she must have, because it's full of wine as red as her lips. The men at the table beside you push their chairs aside. The scrape of wood on tile aches at the back of your head, as though they have dragged their chairs over the inside of your skull. They rise, first one and then two in a laughing pair; their hands clasp tight together, and they swing close, then wide in the widening circle of their friends. One sheds his coat like an old skin; his partner hooks a thumb beneath his suspenders when they pull tight together, and for a moment you can hear the way their breathing quickens. You want to feel yourself flung from one broad hand to the next, traded between these dancers until you come apart in their arms. You want to take them to pieces with your own hands, and you know that they'd let you when their blood is up; you could draw the pearl necklace from your neck and the stole from about your shoulders, and you could bind them up and make them hear you for once in your goddamn life-- Your hand goes to your throat. To the pearls there. You lick your lips, and they taste of blood and wine and paint. Where has your cup of sketos gone? Where are those bitter dregs? \"Dance, Pentheus,\" the woman murmurs, breath hot upon your cheek. Her hand alights between the hem of your gown and your stocking, and you can feel the slick heat of it in your loins. Dance, Pentheus, she told you, as you stood before your mirror and let her curl your hair and line your eyes. She had pressed her lips against your long neck, biting the flesh as though she meant to tear out your throat. She is Dionysos; she is Bromios and Evios, and her voice echoes in the hollow parts of you and fills you with a welling madness. She is Eleutherios, and when she speaks, you must dance yourself apart.",

      "There is something inhuman to her that you can't name and don't want to name, but it makes your throat go dry and your eyes water.",
      "She sits upon the piano bench, laying her hand upon the pianist's thigh.",
      "\"There's music in you,\" she whispers, although you can hear her as though she's whispering in your ear instead of his.",
      "\"Let's draw it out, shall we?\"",
      "When he touches the keys again, he's a different man.",
      "Sweat bleeds down his face, soaks the collar of his shirt and turns it damp and translucent.",
      "Each tendon in his neck shows through the cotton, drawn in lengthy shadows when he tilts his head against the lamplight.",
      "His song plucks some sympathetic chord within you, until your whole self vibrates with the need to respond to that resonant charge--your feet ache to dance; you feel that ache from arch to sternum, and with each beat of your heart that ache deepens until you think it must split you apart.",
      "The woman's glass has begun to bead with moisture.",
      "It catches in the web of her hand and spills over the back, and those glistening droplets slide down her wrist when she tilts her head back to drink.",
      "You don't remember when she refilled her glass--but she must have, because it's full of wine as red as her lips.",
      "The men at the table beside you push their chairs aside.",
      "The scrape of wood on tile aches at the back of your head, as though they have dragged their chairs over the inside of your skull.",
      "They rise, first one and then two in a laughing pair; their hands clasp tight together, and they swing close, then wide in the widening circle of their friends.",
      "One sheds his coat like an old skin; his partner hooks a thumb beneath his suspenders when they pull tight together, and for a moment you can hear the way their breathing quickens.",
      "You want to feel yourself flung from one broad hand to the next, traded between these dancers until you come apart in their arms.",
      "You want to take them to pieces with your own hands, and you know that they'd let you when their blood is up; you could draw the pearl necklace from your neck and the stole from about your shoulders, and you could bind them up and make them hear you for once in your goddamn life-- Your hand goes to your throat.",
      "To the pearls there.",
      "You lick your lips, and they taste of blood and wine and paint.",
      "Where has your cup of sketos gone?",
      "Where are those bitter dregs?",
      "\"Dance, Pentheus,\" the woman murmurs, breath hot upon your cheek.",
      "Her hand alights between the hem of your gown and your stocking, and you can feel the slick heat of it in your loins.",
      "Dance, Pentheus, she told you, as you stood before your mirror and let her curl your hair and line your eyes.",
      "She had pressed her lips against your long neck, biting the flesh as though she meant to tear out your throat.",
      "She is Dionysos; she is Bromios and Evios, and her voice echoes in the hollow parts of you and fills you with a welling madness.",
      "She is Eleutherios, and when she speaks, you must dance yourself apart."

    "text": "Hephaistion strode down the halls of the palace, missing the simple rows of tents of the earlier campaign. He felt heavy with dread. Alexander's enemies were conspiring, he knew it, and he felt his death and Alexander's own grow close. He had pushed too hard the last time they had spoken of it, however, and their comfortable intimacy had suffered. Hephaistion sighed and covered his face with his hand, rubbing at the tension in his forehead. If he could only get Alexander to listen. His pride was like a wall, serving as a buffer against any convincing words. He was as intractable as his ancestor Achilles, sulking in his tents. It was no wonder, either, as Alexander had always styled himself as Achilles come again, and Hephaistion as Patroklos. Hephaistion stopped short, with a quick intake of breath. That was it. It was the only way to get through to him. Gods help me, he muttered. Make him listen. Soften his heart to my words, and I will never ask another favor of you again. He paused at the door to Alexander's room. A year ago he would have strode in without hesitation, but things had changed. He took a deep breath and walked in anyway. Alexander was at his desk, writing, with Bagoas at his feet. Hephaistion waved the boy out, ignoring the indignant glare he got in response. As Hephaistion walked up behind him, Alexander barely noticed, deep in thought on campaign plans and sketching troop placements. Hephaistion took Alexander's head in his hands and began stroking the thick mane of hair, the way he used to do every night. As he massaged the tension out of Alexander's scalp his eyes closed in pleasure, and Hephaistion smiled. \"I miss this,\" he whispered. \"I miss you.\" Alexander's eyes opened slowly and he turned to face his friend. \"I miss you, too. I miss the way you used to support me in all things. Hephaistion, you have to know that what I do is necessary to unite the empire behind me as we advance to India. Persia will not remain mine if I cannot be High King to them.\" \"You're right,\" Hephaistion agreed. Alexander's eyebrows lifted in surprise. \"I'm just not convinced advancing to India is necessary. I'm worried it's one step too far, Alexander. You are the most amazing leader--the most amazing man--the world has ever seen. But I fear that if you are not satisfied now, with the whole of Greece and the Persian Empire in your hands, you will never be satisfied. And that way lies your death. Every tragic hero followed that path, Alexander. You can choose another.\" Alexander frowned, and turned away. Hephaistion had avoided using the word hubris, worried about wounding his pride further. How could he explain, without diminishing the majesty of the king and the dignity of the man he loved? He picked up Alexander's hand and led him to the divan, where they could both sit comfortably. There was only a little tension in Alexander's arm before he assented and followed. He wants to be persuaded, Hephaistion realized then. He just needs a good precedent to follow. I'll make him one, Hephaistion decided. \"Let me tell you a story,\" he began. Alexander's mouth turned up in a half-smile and rolled his eyes back toward his desk. \"I don't really have time for this, you know. There is much to be done before we pick up stakes and move East.\" Hephaistion frowned at him now, him and his stubborn pride. \"Let me tell you the story of Achilles and Patroklos, but with another ending.\" At this Alexander laughed. \"To what end? I know this story like the back of Boukephalos's head, and so do you. What purpose could this possibly serve?\" \"Humor me,\" Hephaistion pleaded. \"It will not take long, and if I am not persuasive, you can go back to your plans and I will not hinder you. In fact, I will do all in my power to work toward the smooth transition of our troops to the East. But if I am persuasive, we will have new plans to make, and there is no point in continuing those if we are about to throw them aside.\" \"Unlikely,\" Alexander scoffed. \"But, by the love I have borne you since we were boys, and the love you bear me still, I will listen.\" \"Good,\" Hephaistion sighed with relief. \"Good. Now, as you know, Achilles and Patroklos were, like us, joined at the hip since they were young boys, ever since the day Patroklos and his father Menoitios arrived out of Opoeis...\" *** Achilles and Patroklos had been joined at the hip since they were young boys, ever since the day Patroklos and his father Menoitios arrived out of Opoeis, the roaring vengeful family of the boy Patroklos had slain hot on their heels. Patroklos had been cheating at their dice game, and the his playmate had taken such affront that he had drawn his small boys' knife. Patroklos didn't understand why he should be punished for defending himself, but his father had just slapped his mouth silent when he protested, and brought him to Peleus for sanctuary. Patroklos stood there, listening with only half an ear to his father's explanation and supplication. His eyes wandered to the boy at Peleus's right hand--his son, he supposed. The boy was shorter than Patroklos, but possibly no younger. He was eyeing Patroklos back, to be sure, in a way that was measuring and analytical. When Menoitos got to the part of his story that concerned the cause of their flight, the boy's eyebrows rose to his hairline, and then his gaze returned to Patroklos, reassessing. He appeared impressed. Then Peleus assented to bring Patroklos into his household as Achilles's squire, indicating the boy as he said the name. This was an endurable fate, Patroklos decided. Achilles was smaller, but no less trained than he--that was clear. The boy balanced well on the balls of his feet, every muscle pulled taut as if he were about to rain arrows upon Patroklos, just for looking. He scowled, and Patroklos couldn't help but grin. He wondered if Achilles played dice. *** \"My mother is a goddess,\" Achilles told Patroklos a few days later, after they had settled into a routine, but not yet into a relationship. He was watching the older boy closely to see what his reaction to this announcement would be. Patroklos had noticed that the other boys of the household avoided him, not just because of his rank, but also because of his divine heritage. The gods were fickle and quick to anger; it stood to reason that demigods were as well. \"Really,\" Patroklos replied. It wasn't a question. \"Do you see her often?\" Patroklos answered Achilles' gaze with his own. The younger boy was a mystery--dark, intriguing. So far their lives together had consisted of dressing, bathing, training, and eating. Patroklos was learning the household and its idiosyncrasies, and found that Achilles did not lord his rank over him. He accepted the attendance as his due, but he did not abuse it. And he gave Patroklos leave to wander the grounds, share his meals (and his rooms), and try to pin him in wrestling exercises. He hadn't managed it. Not yet. Achilles shook his head. \"Not often. It pains her to see me, I think. I am mortal, as is my father, and she knows one day we will both die. It hurts her too much to dwell on our fates, so she only makes short visits. Besides...\" he trailed off, unsure whether he had already told Patroklos too many details of the inner life of the goddess Thetis, and his own pain--doubtless visible in his face--in her absence. Patroklos took his hand and squeezed it. \"Besides?\" He pretended not to notice the tears welling in his young lord's eyes. Achilles sighed. \"She told me once, before I had begun my training, that I had two potential life paths. I could be the finest warrior that all Achaea had ever seen or will ever see, but die very young. Or I could live a long, full life in obscurity. If I refused to fight, if I refused to train, if I refused to pursue honor, I could live almost forever. What kind of choice is that? No, a life without honor is no life at all. And when I told her so, she left. She could no longer bear the sight of me, already dead in her eyes.\" Patroklos reached out to Achilles, cupping his face in his hand. \"You always have a choice. There's no reason to stop your training; it's good to exercise the body and the brain. But there will be chances ahead of us, chances to cheat fate. Trust me. I'm a master fate-cheater.\" He grinned at the younger boy, willing him to smile. He couldn't bear to see the dark cloud remain on his brow any longer. He only got a half-smile, so he tackled Achilles and wrestled him to the floor. \"Say it,\" he whispered into his ear. \"We'll cheat fate together.\" Achilles shook his head, but he got his smile. *** When Odysseus's ship appeared just above the horizon, Patroklos rushed into Achilles's rooms to be the first to announce it. They had known the war and its recruiting generals were coming; a scout ship bearing a messenger had arrived the night before. Achilles and Patroklos both were excited to join the Achaeans' cause. In bed, after dinner, Patroklos stroked the still-downy hair on Achilles's chin. \"We're old enough, you see.\" Patroklos indicated his own infant beard. \"They'll have to let us join.\" Achilles frowned at the reference to Patrokloss' slightly coarser facial hair. He did not like to be reminded that Patroklos was the elder, even if only by a little. \"Peleus will permit me to fight, I am sure.\" He frowned at the air now. \"I'm not sure about Thetis, however.\" These words still rang in Patroklos's memory as he dashed through Achilles's empty rooms. \"Achilles? Achilles!\" He was not there. He was not on the beach, and he was not on the roof, where sometimes the young men watched the sun set over the ocean and the mainland to the west of them. Patroklos began to suspect that Achilles was not on Aegina at all. When he arrived in the throne room, he saw Odysseus and Peleus deep in conversation. He hovered around the edges of their retinues, not wanting to overstep his place, but vibrating with the need to know what they knew--and to find Achilles. It didn't make any sense. Where could he have gone? Odysseus was returning to his men with a purposeful stride. \"Back to the ship, men. Achilles is not here. We must seek him in Lykomedes's court. Calchas prophesied that Troy cannot be won without the boy. We must have him join us!\" Lykomedes's court? How was that possible, when only last night Achilles was safe in his own bed, in Patroklos's arms? Patroklos started with a gasp. Only by the power of an immortal could such a thing take place. \"Thetis,\" he muttered. Odysseus, never a man to miss a detail, stopped and turned his attention to Patroklos. \"What did you say, boy?\" \"I am sorry if I spoke out of turn,\" Patroklos stammered, suddenly faced with the king of Ithaka's intense, searching gaze. \"I am Patroklos, Lord Achilles's squire. He and I have spoken of his mother, sir...and, well, I suspect she may be behind his disappearance. It will not be as simple as sailing to Skyros and collecting him. She will have hidden him, to keep him safe.\" Patroklos gulped, and then ventured further. \"I know him, better than anyone sir. You should take me with you. I can find him anywhere.\" Patroklos's eyes were pleading, and Odysseus's heart was touched. He nodded. \"Be warned, however, young squire, that you must then accompany us on to Ilium. Skyros is between here and there, and we will not be returning. You and Achilles must both fight for us.\" Patroklos nodded. \"But of course, my lord. That was our intention all along.\" *** \"I cannot help you,\" Lykomedes stated firmly. \"I run the risk of offending my patron goddess by even entertaining you here. You should go, and count yourself lucky.\" Lykomedes was surrounded by his many daughters and their serving girls, and Patroklos found his eyes roaming back to one maid in particular. She was a fair enough girl, but that wasn't what he found so compelling. What was it about her? Godsdamnit, why was he staring at a girl when he was supposed to be looking at Achilles? Looking for Achilles, he corrected himself mentally. And then he paused. Maybe his first thought had been right after all. He looked at her again. That stormy brow, the stolid stance. Oh, Zeus preserve us, it can't be. \"Lord Odysseus, sir. May I have a word?\" Patroklos turned away from Lykomedes's line of sight and whispered into the general's ear. \"She's put a glamor on him, hidden him among the serving girls. I'm sure of it. He must be bewitched himself--there's no way he'd stay put otherwise. I don't know how to prove it, though, sir. Nor how to break the spell.\" Odysseus grinned, a twinkle in his eye. \"Best leave that part to me.\" *** Later, Achilles and Patroklos were bunked in the sleeping quarters of Odysseus's ship--Achilles wrapped around Patroklos as if he feared that Thetis would steal him away once more. \"Thank you,\" he murmured into his lover's ear, \"for coming to get me.\" \"What else could I have done?\" Patroklos laughed. \"Not only can the Acheans not win Troy without you, you've spoiled my ability to fight beside anyone else. I imagine I'd have died on the first charge up the beach without you there to protect me.\" Achilles pulled away from Patroklos, holding his eyes in his own. \"Don't say that. Never say that! If you must die, let it be only after my own death. And let our bones rest in the same coffer, intertwined in death as we are in life. I could not live without you, Patroklos. It was bad enough living apart from you as a maid in Lykomedes's court,\" and at this thought Achilles sneered, wounded by the dishonor he felt his mother paid him in dressing him as if he were female. Thank the (other) gods her glamor did not extend deeply enough to prevent him from desiring and grasping the weapons Odysseus had planted among the baubles and silks with which he had gifted the ladies of Lykomedes's court. \"I do not think I could stand it if you were to die before me.\" Patroklos brought his forehead to Achilles's, closing his eyes as he felt their bond stronger than ever. Achilles was normally spare with words of love, preferring words of war, of honor and of glory, even as his hands spoke a softer language, and his tongue no language at all. \"We are off to war, beloved,\" he smiled at Achilles's perpetual gravity. \"Death comes to us all in our time, but I promise to do my best to avoid its early arrival. Will you do the same?\" Achilles squeezed his eyes shut, sighing at both Patroklos's words and his tongue, licking at Achilles's throat as if parched for him after their long separation. \"I have no choice. You know this. I will die young. It is fated.\" Patroklos sighed and stopped his ministrations. \"Well, obviously not. Thetis wouldn't have bothered to try to prevent it if it were unpreventable. I'm just not convinced that you cannot fight and live at the same time. I don't think this is a life that holds only two choices, Achilles. We are off to war, yes. We will not hide and shame our fathers, no. But that doesn't mean we have to die, either. How many men live to be grizzled old generals? Why can we not join their ranks? Look at Odysseus himself, that wily man. I aim to be like him, I do.\" Achilles just grunted and quickly changed the subject without any words, as he was wont to do. Patroklos was too sore with longing for him over the course of the interminable sea voyage to press the issue. *** Achilles was, indeed, a wonder. There was no warrior, on either the Trojan or Achaean side, that could match him. Patroklos's heart swelled with pride whenever he caught side of his lover on the battlefield, striking down Trojan lords and barely even breaking a sweat. Patroklos comported himself well enough, but often found it necessary to do his own fighting beyond Achilles's line of sight. Having the divine Achilles sweep in to protect you from taking a wound was gratifying on one level, and mortifying on another. The Achaeans spent almost a full ten years failing to breach the walls of the city. Raids were made to the border towns, and the surrounding countryside. Much loot and honor was won in these raids, and the Achaeans were content for some time to continue sapping the countryside of its young men, young livestock, and life-sustaining crops. Near the end of these ten years, however, Agamemnon--the general in charge of the campaign--an arrogant, resentful man, took as his prize the daughter of a priest of Apollo. Being the stubborn ass that he was, he refused her father's pleas for ransom, and so brought Apollo's arrows, full of plague, down upon the Achaeans. When he was finally convinced to ransom the girl back to her father, he demanded--despite the bounty of gifts the priest had paid to have her returned--another girl, a prize given to Achilles. Achilles did not care for the girl--he had set her to serve as a cook and a drudge, preferring to share his tent with Patroklos only. But Achilles and Agamemnon had been at each other's throats since the beginning of the campaign--Agamemnon thought the younger man lacked piety and respect for his elders, and Achilles thought Agamemnon hubristic and unworthy of his position as the leader of the men. Agamemnon's taking of Briseis was a literal theft of Achilles's honor. *** \"You're worse that Leonidas, Hephaistion,\" Alexander interrupted. \"I know this already. Lysimachos explained the honor of war prizes to me when I was eight if you recall.\"\"Yes, I do recall,\" Hephaistion replied, \"As well as I recall your first response to Achilles's decision to withdraw from battle over the loss of the girl. You thought it was stupid.\"\"That's because I didn't understand that it was a matter of honor,\" Alexander sighed, pinching the bridge of his nose. \"What is your point?\"\"My point, Alexander, is that there is honor, and then there is honor. Achilles earned his glory on the battlefield, with his exploits and his skill. That glory could not be taken him simply by seizing this one war-slave.\"\"Honor is honor, Hephaistion. Honor earned by exploits and honor embodied in a war-slave. They're the same word in Greek.\"\"But not in Macedonian, and not in Persian,\" Hephaistion countered. \"You're shedding Greek customs like snakes' skin behind you as you advance East. And you cling to this one?\" Alexander's eyes shot up to Hephaistion's, for the first time since he had entered Alexander's room that evening. Good. He was finally getting through. \"Will you be silent, now, and listen to the end of my story?\" Hephaistion pleaded. \"I promise to stop playing the pedagogue. I know you know the Iliad by heart.\" Alexander smiled indulgently, softened by the flattery, and by Hephaistion's acknowledgment of their shared love for Homer's epic. \"Continue, then.\" *** And so Achilles sulked in his tents, his heart curled and blackened by the dishonor Agamemnon had shown him. He prayed to his mother to come to his aid, and plead an intercession for him with Zeus. Zeus, for his part, turned the tide of the battle so that the Achaeans were out to sea. Without divine Achilles, they were lost. Patroklos paced the floor of the tent, where he remained with Achilles, out of love for him. It was plain to see that he was not pleased by their inactivity, however, and when the wails and ululations traveled through the air and into the tent where they remained apart from the death and the fighting, Patroklos balled his hands up into fists and ground his teeth. \"How much of this will you make them endure?\" he asked Achilles, as Diomedes prepared to battle Hektor. \"At what point is it enough? If Agamemnon brought Briseis back to your tents this very night, would you reenter the battle?\" Achilles pondered this, smiling strangely up at Patroklos. \"Is this not what you wanted, love? If I am not in battle, I cannot die before my time. Agamemnon has already had my honor taken from me, so why not die an old man, in your arms?\" He reached for Patroklos, but he pulled away. \"No,\" Patroklos stated simply. \"No, this is not what I wanted. I wanted you to live as you are. The divine Achilles, striking down man and beast that would stand between him and the gates of Troy. Achilles, who wins the day for the Achaeans, over and over again. As long as you are that man, you cannot die. This? What you're doing now? This dishonors you infinitely more than the loss of that girl ever could. To sit idly by while your compatriots die for lack of you? I'm disappointed, Achilles. This is not you.\" Achilles's eyes flashed with anger. Those words, in any other mouth, would warrant a death sentence. As it was, he trembled with the strength it took to keep from attacking Patroklos right there in the tent. \"How dare you say such things to me? Thetis has informed me further that my death fate is to die if I kill Hektor. And here I sit, not killing Hektor. I am fighting my fate. For you. And you call it dishonor?\" \"Yes. Because you can fight other Trojans without killing Hektor. There are more than two choices, Achilles! I have been telling you so since we were boys, and yet you continue your hard-headed and hard-hearted ways of choosing all or none at all. I vow to you Achilles, if you do not reenter the battle this day, then I will. And I will do so wearing your armor, so as to give the Achaeans reason to rally once more.\" \"Fine. Go. What do I care? My point has been made. The Achaeans suffer. You can rescue their chances now, if you like.\" Patroklos could feel his own death-fate now, like a shadow in the back of his mind, clouding up the corners of his eyes with black mist. \"I tell you truly, Achilles, if I enter the field without you, you will die.\" Patroklos snapped out of his last statement as if he had been possessed by an oracle. \"Ah! Yes, it's the only thing that makes sense. The puzzle pieces begin to fall into place.\" \"What are you on about?\" Achilles sneered, still angry at Patroklos' accusations. Patroklos turned to Achilles, light and understanding dawning in his eyes. \"Your terms of honor are to stay in this tent and let the Achaeans miss your prowess. Mine are to leave this tent and fight beside them. I cannot hide here from the carnage and call myself an honorable man. You will die if you kill Hektor, but you believe if you stay in this tent you will live a long life without glory? But you already have glory enough for one hundred men. That path is no longer open to you.\" Patroklos started pacing again. \"So if we continue on this path, you will kill Hektor. What could possibly stir you from this tent and your black sulk to kill the man you know will lead to your death?\" Achilles was intent now on Patroklos's words, all anger and resentment gone. Patroklos nodded, pleased by the effect his logic had had on Achilles's soul. He's never been much of a thinker, that man, but he recognizes logic when he hears it, thank the gods. \"If I leave this tent wearing your armor, Hektor will kill me. It's the only explanation.\" \"No. No, no, no, no!\" Achilles started keening, startling Patroklos out of his reverie. \"We are doomed, fortune's fools. Oh, my Patroklos!\" Achilles clutched at him, as if he were sliding down the wall of a ravine, and Patroklos were the only purchase. \"Achilles, no. Wait.\" Patroklos held his lord and lover's head in his hands, and forced his gaze up to meet his own. \"Don't you see? Now that we know that twisted fate, we can avoid it. And avoiding it is simple. Enter the field with me. Protect me as you have always done, and Hektor will not have a chance to kill me. Decline to kill him yourself, and neither of us has to die.\" \"But...\" Achilles struggled to understand. \"Thetis said...\" \"She doesn't want you to die any more than you or I do. She was trying to avoid your death in battle by cutting you off from fighting at all, which clearly didn't work, and never would have. But what if you can fight and still live? What if you can fight and win? What if we can both leave Troy, alive and intact, and return to Aegina with your victorious Myrmidons? Trust me. I think we can do this.\" Patroklos kissed Achilles then, the kiss of a long-committed pairing, full of love and wisdom, and a promise of more later. \"But Patroklos, there is still the matter of Agamemnon's dishonor done me.\" Achilles protested. \"I don't think I can bring myself to fight for that man if his slight is not repaired.\" Patroklos grinned, a twinkle in his eye. \"Just leave that part to me.\" *** \"So Patroklos asks Odysseus to speak to Agamemnon, then, I take it?\" Alexander interrupted again. \"In this version, the mediation Phoenix attempts between Achilles and Agamemnon works?\" \"As indeed it should have,\" Hephaistion assented. \"Seven unused tripods, ten talents of gold, twenty cauldrons, twelve horses, and seven women of Lesbos, in addition to the return of Briseis, should have been enough to placate any man's wounded honor. Sulking further at that point was just hubris. It was enough.\" Alexander looked thoughtful. \"And you think that Persia should be enough to placate me?\" Hephaistion sighed. \"If you truly want to conquer all the known world, I will be right by your side until the last. You know this. But you love Persia and the Persians. Why not stay here and rule, instead of conquering more? Campaign here, and no further. Strengthen the borders. Quell the rebellions. Send home the most intractable of the Greeks, those who will never be able to see the Persians as anything but barbarians and slaves. Your attempts to integrate them have been thorough and thoughtful, but there are some who will never open their hearts and minds to this land and its people, and you may as well let them go. But if you stay, and I stay, and we raise our families here together--the next generation of Greek-influenced, Macedonian-trained, Persian-mannered leaders--well, what could we not accomplish? I'm thinking of the longterm legacy of the divine Alexander, my love. I don't think it resides in India. Let Persia be enough.\" Alexander shook his head angrily. \"It's not up to me, Hephaistion. My fate was foretold at the beginning of the world. I must continue on this path.\" His face softened a bit as he looked upon his beloved. \"No matter what I truly want. Zeus told me so at Siwah.\" Hephaistion smiled sideways at his lover. \"What if that wasn't Zeus? What if that was your own mind, projecting its desire? And if that desire remains unchanged, so be it.\" He took Alexander's hand in his own again. \"But if it is no longer what you want, you have the power to change course. Look at you! You have conquered so much. You have brought back the glory of Hellas, greater than Athens ever did. You have won every battle you have ever fought. How is it possible you could be defeated by fate? What is fate? It is nothing but air, a wisp of thought. You can blow it away from us with one breath. You are not Achilles. I am not Patroklos. Their end does not have to be our end. Let us retell their story, and make new choices for their sake, as well as our own. If any man has that power, you do.\" Alexander gazed out the window at the setting sun in the Persian sky. He remembered the original purpose to this campaign, and how he had achieved that so easily. The Greek colonies freed from the Persians, and then the conquest of Persia herself. He thought of the glory he had gained as the High King of the Persian Empire, and of the cruelties he had ended. He thought of Bagoas, and vowed again to put an end to the practices that had tortured him so. If he left Persia, he could not guarantee his changes would remain, his wishes obeyed. Was it enough? The emptiness gnawed the guts inside him, emptiness that only accomplishing the impossible had been able to fill. Accomplishing what his father could not. Was it enough? He turned to Hephaistion, who was visibly holding his breath. Alexander softened, and put his arms around the other man. \"It is enough.\" He nuzzled Hephaistion's ear as he murmured the words at last. \"It is enough.\"",

      "What if we can both leave Troy, alive and intact, and return to Aegina with your victorious Myrmidons?",
      "Trust me.",

      "It was enough.\"",

Before her, a picture blooms - tightly-wound blossoms, a carpet of grass, a world of storm and sunlight. Gradually from the mat rose Aphrodite, with her waves of blonde hair and a rose held tightly in her grip. Arachne pauses as she glances down at the picture she's woven. A bittersweet pulse of frustration teased her heart - this piece, which she had dripped sweat over and shed blood, tears - would be burnt at Delphi in tribute to the goddess. Arachne doesn't care if praising Aphrodite will lead to the great enrichment of her village - no thought has been given to her, the human creator of this slip of art. What she yearned for, lusted after, dreamed of, would be washed aside in favor of the antics of the Gods. But Arachne would not allow herself to go in cowlike silence to the slaughter.",

    "text": "Three vases, a table, and the foot of a very grumpy old thane. That was the chronological list of the things proven that Thor had broken at the last feast held in the grand hall. Two of them had been thrown at his younger brother, and it hadn't simply been the dishware. The left side, no matter how much tender care had been applied, still bore the dent in a pillar where, save for a nicely -timed roll in childish giggles (the children, dear things that they were, didn't understand just how close they'd come to killing each other on a daily basis since they were old enough to move) would have been a very sorrow stain of Loki. Considering this, it had been a few years since they'd been bothered to host anything that included outside guests that would think such behavior unsavory. But it was a rare chance that any other Gods than the Norse ones appeared, so the chance was taken. The boys were older and (at least Loki) wiser, so other than a stern word and an even more intimidating eye, the servants were bade to clean the hall best they could without too much bother. The gentle din of a group bent on polishing every available surface to a blinding shine soon consumed the palace, and the air was already lively with excitement. No matter the subject, any gathering soon became quite the party when the Romans were concerned. As a people fond of yelling and general merriment, no greater friends had been found. \"The ladies are something legendary to behold as well.\" Voice now broken into a husky deep octave after an awkward few months of breaking, Thor raised an appreciative eyebrow as one of the attendants skittered past, eyes focused on the way the fabric wrapped on her curves. He elbowed his brother in manly way, but the other only jostled horribly, dropping the heavy tomb he'd been balancing on his lap. It was fortunate the 566666 page volume had not fallen on the child's foot, as it still dangled off the floor. The dark-haired boy was well expected to start his transformation into a true man soon now, but for the time he was still slender and fair, much unlike the almost solid block of masculinity Thor had seemed to wean into. Though a few pitying shakes of the head had been aimed at the younger prince, not everyone was as blessed in puberty. Flinching as the echo of the loud slam bounced down the hallway and briefly diverted the attention of each and every one there; Loki knitted his eyebrows with a huff. \"Is that really all you're looking forward to this evening?\" He questioned absently, dropping off the pile of benches they'd found refuge on. Collecting the book with a strained noise, he hefted it on the place next to him before Thor knocked him again with his infuriating large hand. \"There's more to life than youngsters like you could understand, Loki.\" He murmured in what he thought was a knowing way, as if three years of difference could really consider the boy (well, man now, supposedly) more worldly. A strange look came to his eye, one hand propped fondly on his knee. \"One day, you'll get it.\" Dark eyes rolling, Loki found his eyes wandering over to one of the women scurrying about. Such a power they seemed to hold over his brother as of late! It seemed only a short time since they were both carefree of the other sex, running about with more pressing tasks on mind. Such as tricking the tutors and finding ways to sneak a tasty morsel from the kitchen. Thor hadn't ever been one for swiftness or cunning, but he made for a wonderful distraction and blatant intimidation, which Loki did require. A voice bellowed down the hall for the older prince and Thor took his leave, grin large, as if the two were privy to manly secrets more than simply ogling the servants. \"One day, Brother!\" He gave as a final bellow, quickly crossing through the arches to wherever he had been called. Loki sat mutely, corners of his lips dragging down. It didn't matter they were still a favored companion of each other, despite Thor's increased following of friends and, well, girls, he found himself missing his brother. A majority of their time was together, but his older sibling's mind was elsewhere, and his patience for childish pastimes (as he tended to call Loki's suggestions) was thin at best. Maybe he bore the boy no grudge, but the intimacy between them was gone. Thin fingers brushing over his book unenthusiastically, his eyes clouded with thought. He knew what he wanted; Thor to swing his attention fully and delightedly back on him. But there was only one thing that seemed to draw the blonde's gaze so raptly... Small face lighting up with the wonder of an idea, Loki sported a wicked grin, pulling the book into his arm and scurrying off to his room. Though technically his proud collection of books scattered about belonged to royal library, in the ten years he'd been smuggling them back to his chambers, not a single one had been missed. Magic was used more a sort of wary history than a guide, but he'd been able to pick up a few tricks from various volumes, which he was intended on doing for the rest of the afternoon. He managed fairly decent illusions with the spell in mind before, but this needed to be perfect. --------- By the time night fell, the hall was alive with bellows and laughter. The guests of the kingdom were living up excellently to their supposed natures, and there was gaiety everywhere a glance could turn. The mead flowed freely, dancers swayed to a lively beat, and the food piled the tables despite the most eager of attempts to rid the platters of their contents. Such an event would be boasted of for awhile yet to come, Asgard pride shining through the safeguards of drinking and general debauchery. Thor was almost delirious with joy. Despite that he was barely over his fourteenth year his form was pleasing and his personality strong and alluring, so he was the center of many attentions. Odin would cast a parent's tired eye in his direction occasionally, but even with the playful wandering of his hands and the high giggles of the Roman girls gathered about him, the boy was behaving well enough. To his not unpleasing surprise, not once had him and Loki huddled suspiciously in a corner, brewing up something that was sure to embarrass his name. In fact, the King thought suddenly, turning his attention briefly from his guests and glancing over the crowded hall, he hadn't seen Loki at all tonight. His stomach gave a nervous twist, the slight dip of his eyebrow gathering the attention of the man besides him. Zeus was a close friend over the years. Both men were similar and found good humor in each other's company, and as far as different kingdoms went--let alone separate realms--they were on almost impossibly good terms. War between the nations was unthinkable; the respect between the Gods was enough that nothing more than friendship could ever hope to grow. While they were indeed men, and not as inclined towards emotion as the fairer sex, the man stroked his beard contemplatively, regarding his companion with a calming smile. \"What brings this sudden vexation to your brow, Odin? I have been here a good many hours and there hasn't been as much a scuffle between lads too young to handle their mead.\" He declined to add that it a rarity to find it so, but his eye said as much, almost capable of smirking like his mouth could. Catching the glance and relaxing ever-slightly, the King waved his hand absently, turning deliberately from the party in front of them. \"Indeed, and I have no indication one should start up. Perhaps-\"He noted, voice still merry, but tinged with the uncomfortable tone of a fear, \"-that is what brings me worry.\" The prince's laugh barked over the heads of the party, stocky arm slipping about a waist and pulling a girl into his lap. \"You are a delight, aren't you? I have long heard boasted the beauty of those in Olympus, but mostly of the goddesses. How absent-minded they were to not include the citizens as well!\" Voice slurred by the careful intake of mead he'd been allowed at his age, he grinned as the girl blushed and tittered, face soft and pink. Such had been the habit through the night, and weren't it not for the charm which had been delivered, many a drink should stained the light brush of Thor's beard. But how was a man supposed to be solemn which such a feast of the eyes paraded him? Pleased with his current lapful as he was, it wasn't long before he was prowling again, eyes searching for the keenest beauty he could find. And find it he did. Fair hair was well and fine, but so many of the young ladies here sported blonde tresses light enough to match their robes that is was something of guilty pleasure to take excitement in the flip of a dark head, the contrast of milky skin drawing in the young princes' attention. Though it was strange to have the handsome lass alone, Thor thought it little more than luck on his behalf, sliding to the girl's side as she had her goblet filled, emerald eyes uninterested on the party. Glancing over in a bored way when the flicker of movement was noticed, a sweet grin broke over her full lips at the sight of Thor, head dipping bashfully. \"Good evening, Prince Thor.\" \"Prince is far too formal, my fair lady.\" He rumbled slyly, walking besides her as she left the table for a bench, attention rapt on the young god. \"This is a night of fun, and I shall not stand for titles. I'd much rather have your name slip your lips than my rank.\" Thinking this particularly clever, he watched as she flustered, heart beating with pride the way women even now were stunned into mumbling in his presence. It could never be said he thought any less of the fair creatures, but it accorded with his ego to have their cheeks burn and lips fumble in his splendor. \"L-Laustria.\" The woman stuttered, lips quirking almost nervously. \"Though you shouldn't be so pressed to remember it. Other than the use of it in conversation, names don't nearly interest me as much as the talk.\" Gaining more comfortable footing, her form shifted in its seat, delicate curves garbed a bit more modestly than Thor would have guessed. Maybe it was where his interest was more apt to go, but he had found the girls with the best figures flaunted it proudly, cloth wrapped intricately but low over their chest and high on their thighs. While mildly disappointing, it roused his interest, ha thought of what could be underneath more tantalizing than even what was out on display. \"You have a most unusual garb for tonight, Laustria. Were you not pleased by the robes worn by your fellow ladies?\" He asked, hoping to apply to the small vanities he collected of women. When one was wearing something similar enough but decidedly different, it was meant to draw attention. Though if that was the case, it didn't seem to be a favorable decision. Blinking worriedly, the girl pulled at the skirt, which draped to the ground. That was strange, but it also seemed to be similar to the cut of a man's robe, rather than the flair of a woman's dress. \"Is it really that odd?\" Voice high and light with worry, she furrowed her lips, mild displeasure crossing her expression. Thor rustled in at the insecurity, strong hand catching the pale chin and drawing it back to his eye level. Just tonight he'd stolen quite a few kisses, but one more was far from unwelcome. \"No, no, not odd. Simply unique.\" Layering the compliment in a purr, he made to close the distance between them, eager to catch the girl and keep her near for at least the remainder of the evening. Something about her had a familiar aura was drawing him in, and that sudden smirk she had curled over his lips was so very much like- Like Loki. Spluttering as the form of the young woman melted into that of his even younger brother, the other doubled over in giggles, unaware of the awkward feelings that had suddenly applied to this situation in his youth. Kisses weren't so strange a form of greeting, and until Thor's post-pubescent reluctance to do so, the brothers had always done so before. It would be awhile still before the flirtatious nature of what his older brother was so horrified of would even vaguely flicker through Loki's mind, still firmly rooted in the sense of platonic love alone, and even far more clueless about the rough hold of lust on the teen body. \"Your face! Your face!\" The young prince gasped between racks of laughter, though had he looked up from his pleased curl, he would find that expression flushed in anger and darkening quickly. \"You little halfwit!\" Pouncing upon him, the pair fell to the floor of the hall in a loud crash, scattering a group nearby and drawing the attention of those gathered. \"Your stupid little tricks won't stop me from beating you into the floor!\" The rabble was loud and interesting enough to pull the interest of the head table, much to the dismay of Odin, one hand settling heavily to his temple as his children rolled about and bellowed insults at each other, each more simple-minded than the last. \"I'm the halfwit?! You were the one who was trailing like a puppy after me!\" \"I chased after a woman, not some stupid like runt in a dress! \"It's not a dress, it's a robe!\" \"It's a dress, you idiot! Are you going to just give into your soft little nature and join the girls completely now!\" \"IT'S A ROBE!\" \"Silence!\" Halting not only the fight, but all the activities of the room with the single word, Odin stalked from the table and pulled the boys roughly apart, glaring eye traveling first to Thor, then to Loki. \"Both of you, back to your rooms! I will call for you tonight, when have reflected on how to behave like the princes you are!\" Glare still on his younger son, he sighed mightily, dropping Thor's arm. \"Change back into proper clothes, please.\" \"But it's a robe!\" Loki supplied tearfully, cut off by the sudden storm of protests from Thor about their punishments. * * * * * * Children pushed over to one of the servants used to getting them into their chambers by now, the King went back to the table, clearing his throat. \"I apologize, dear friends. You know how siblings can be, I trust? Childish scuffles hardly wait a day between incidents with the princes, I fear. \" Glancing back over his shoulder just in time to watch the younger fall flat on his face, he sighed deeply. He was apt to... transform at this rate, if to avoid tripping the hem of the larger dres-robe, but it still didn't sit well with him. Even with the naivety that probably went into the act, it only showed his powers were growing too quickly to be easy to deter. As good friends tend to do, Zeus was having similar thoughts. Much like very good friends, he also held an entirely different opinion. \"Odin, how old did you say your youngest was at now? Eleven or so, wasn't it?\" He said thoughtfully, watching the boy pick himself up with a face determined not to sob, though a few tears already streaked it. \"He seems very well-educated on magics, doesn't he?\" The King winced, pointedly looking back from the hall exiting the larger feasting one. \"Somehow, yes. Where he finds such lessons has yet to be discovered, other than some dusty tombs found in his room.\" He said in a clipped sentence, clearly eager to move the subject back to better conversation. Zeus pressed harder, however, great brow quirking as a clear clash of cultures entered the room. \"You mean you have no tutor for the boy? There is a great talent you are ignoring then. As far as I know, most of you aren't inclined to feats other than strength in the family, but I have seen plenty of your women-\" \"It is a woman's occupation.\" Odin said firmly, shifting in his seat as he sensed a debate. Many a great things happen at the causal argument of two Gods, so even if the subject was so personal as his own offspring, the King wasn't opposed to seeing where this could lead. \"And there it is quite noble. Men are warriors, and much more suited to it. Within a few years Loki will grow into his muscle, and his silly dabbles with magic will stay behind with his childhood.\" Also sensing the fight to come, the other King smiled, thick finger pointing absently as he made a point. \"I think you presume too much. The boy is slender; if you were to throw him into the world of battle he would be sorely disadvantaged, no matter how hard he trained. Why not let him build his strength where he could make the most use of it?\" \"I won't have him placed with all the girls. While it is well and good to improve your strengths, he needs to grow as a man just as much, and needs the proper company.\" The statement had a tired air to it, as if this was a thought had many times. As a parent, you wanted to show what love you could, but there was just what needed to be done. Loki was different enough without giving him more attention, and that was all there was to it. Quiet as he took in the tone, Zeus leaned back, fingers tapping on the arm of his chair. \"...What if I were to take him with me? Many of our boys and men learn basic spells, at the very least, and many excel to the point where they make it most of their occupation. We may not be as warrior-based as you, but it is a happy medium, I would say.\" Chuckle merry and hearty, Odin shook his head. \"Oh, you cannot be serious! To train one in magic arts takes years!\" When the other's expression remained stoic, the King wilted, face taking on a serious air. \"You do not make this offer in jest? Zeus, I value your consul, but...\" \"But what? If anything, this solves your problem. Present it to your child, if you are hesitant. Considering it is his future which we so lightly debate, he should be included, don't you think?\" Large fist slamming lightly on the table, Odin shook his head, mouth a stern line. \"But he is such a tender age! What he wants may be far from what the boy needs! I have always trusted his line of thought, but this is close to his interest, and in his youth, his judgment will surely be clouded.\" \"What harm will a year do, even if he says yes?\" Zeus said with a playful shove, hand clamped on his shoulder in a show of comradely. \"Odin, this truly vexes you. If it will help, your child is always welcome in my home. I am not asking you to decide without all the variables, but do promise me you will ask Loki.\" Silent in thought, Odin leaned forward onto his knees, taking a deep swing of mead. \"...Aye. But for now, let our thoughts wander from children! We are hardly mother hens, Zeus.\" \"Speak for yourself. You never had one of your brood spring from your forehead.\" The laughter to come from this echoed for the rest of the night, fading only in the dawn, where the party struggled to rooms, last of its merriment gone. And, perhaps, one of its sons.",

      "By the time night fell, the hall was alive with bellows and laughter.",
      "The guests of the kingdom were living up excellently to their supposed natures, and there was gaiety everywhere a glance could turn.",
      "The mead flowed freely, dancers swayed to a lively beat, and the food piled the tables despite the most eager of attempts to rid the platters of their contents.",
      "Such an event would be boasted of for awhile yet to come, Asgard pride shining through the safeguards of drinking and general debauchery.",
      "Thor was almost delirious with joy.",
      "Despite that he was barely over his fourteenth year his form was pleasing and his personality strong and alluring, so he was the center of many attentions.",
      "Odin would cast a parent's tired eye in his direction occasionally, but even with the playful wandering of his hands and the high giggles of the Roman girls gathered about him, the boy was behaving well enough.",
      "To his not unpleasing surprise, not once had him and Loki huddled suspiciously in a corner, brewing up something that was sure to embarrass his name.",

      "He declined to add that it a rarity to find it so, but his eye said as much, almost capable of smirking like his mouth could.",
      "Catching the glance and relaxing ever-slightly, the King waved his hand absently, turning deliberately from the party in front of them.",
      "\"Indeed, and I have no indication one should start up.",
      "Perhaps-\"He noted, voice still merry, but tinged with the uncomfortable tone of a fear, \"-that is what brings me worry.\"",
      "The prince's laugh barked over the heads of the party, stocky arm slipping about a waist and pulling a girl into his lap.",
      "\"You are a delight, aren't you?",
      "I have long heard boasted the beauty of those in Olympus, but mostly of the goddesses.",
      "How absent-minded they were to not include the citizens as well!\"",

      "And find it he did.",
      "Fair hair was well and fine, but so many of the young ladies here sported blonde tresses light enough to match their robes that is was something of guilty pleasure to take excitement in the flip of a dark head, the contrast of milky skin drawing in the young princes' attention.",
      "Though it was strange to have the handsome lass alone, Thor thought it little more than luck on his behalf, sliding to the girl's side as she had her goblet filled, emerald eyes uninterested on the party.",
      "Glancing over in a bored way when the flicker of movement was noticed, a sweet grin broke over her full lips at the sight of Thor, head dipping bashfully.",
      "\"Good evening, Prince Thor.\"",
      "\"Prince is far too formal, my fair lady.\"",
      "He rumbled slyly, walking besides her as she left the table for a bench, attention rapt on the young god.",
      "\"This is a night of fun, and I shall not stand for titles.",
      "I'd much rather have your name slip your lips than my rank.\"",
      "Thinking this particularly clever, he watched as she flustered, heart beating with pride the way women even now were stunned into mumbling in his presence.",
      "It could never be said he thought any less of the fair creatures, but it accorded with his ego to have their cheeks burn and lips fumble in his splendor.",
      "\"L-Laustria.\"",
      "The woman stuttered, lips quirking almost nervously.",
      "\"Though you shouldn't be so pressed to remember it.",
      "Other than the use of it in conversation, names don't nearly interest me as much as the talk.\"",
      "Gaining more comfortable footing, her form shifted in its seat, delicate curves garbed a bit more modestly than Thor would have guessed.",
      "Maybe it was where his interest was more apt to go, but he had found the girls with the best figures flaunted it proudly, cloth wrapped intricately but low over their chest and high on their thighs.",
      "While mildly disappointing, it roused his interest, ha thought of what could be underneath more tantalizing than even what was out on display.",
      "\"You have a most unusual garb for tonight, Laustria.",
      "Were you not pleased by the robes worn by your fellow ladies?\"",
      "He asked, hoping to apply to the small vanities he collected of women.",
      "When one was wearing something similar enough but decidedly different, it was meant to draw attention.",
      "Though if that was the case, it didn't seem to be a favorable decision.",
      "Blinking worriedly, the girl pulled at the skirt, which draped to the ground.",
      "That was strange, but it also seemed to be similar to the cut of a man's robe, rather than the flair of a woman's dress.",
      "\"Is it really that odd?\" Voice high and light with worry, she furrowed her lips, mild displeasure crossing her expression.",
      "Thor rustled in at the insecurity, strong hand catching the pale chin and drawing it back to his eye level.",
      "Just tonight he'd stolen quite a few kisses, but one more was far from unwelcome.",
      "\"No, no, not odd.",
      "Simply unique.\"",
      "Layering the compliment in a purr, he made to close the distance between them, eager to catch the girl and keep her near for at least the remainder of the evening.",
      "Something about her had a familiar aura was drawing him in, and that sudden smirk she had curled over his lips was so very much like- Like Loki.",
      "Spluttering as the form of the young woman melted into that of his even younger brother, the other doubled over in giggles, unaware of the awkward feelings that had suddenly applied to this situation in his youth.",

    "text": "She was going to kill him. The first Valentine's Day? he'd asked in response to her hesitant request. He'd promised her a break from searching for the pieces to the Key to Time, and it was the first thing that had popped into her head. His response had been underwhelming, Why'd you want to go there? Nothing but a bunch of stodgy old Cardinals and Bishops mumbling in Latin. Sure we can go, but that's a bit boring. I'll do you one better... 'One better' apparently meant her getting captured by a group of locals shortly after they'd landed near ancient Rome. He was only leaving her on her own for a moment, he'd promised. He just wanted to go and ask that herder over there which of the seven hills they'd landed near. Get his bearings, he'd said. Don't wander off, he'd said. Within a minute of his leaving, she'd been body-checked, gagged, trussed like a chicken, and hauled off by a gang of young men whose well-greased black curls smelled strongly of rancid goat. She could still see the Doctor in the distance, black leather jacket completely out of place against the low scrub of the ancient Italian countryside. You'd think with those ears he'd be able to hear her muffled screams, but he was too involved in whatever argument he'd gotten into with the herder. He was gesticulating emphatically as the young men spirited her around a hill, past the TARDIS (and they didn't even blink! Bloody blue police box in the middle of nowhere and the bastards didn't so much as turn a head!), and off to whatever nefarious purpose they had planned for her. An hour later, she was still trussed and gagged. They'd dumped her at the mouth of a cave and headed back out, leaving only two of their number to guard her. Her guards were busy drinking something out of a bladder-like container that she was fairly sure used to be some poor goat's stomach. They'd offered her some, but after weighing the benefits of having her gag removed against the prospect of having to drink whatever was in the bag, she'd firmly clamped her teeth around the rough wool and shook her head. Whatever was in that bag, it smelled worse than they did. She suspected it was also alcoholic. The two men - boys really, they couldn't be out of their teens - were laughing longer and louder as time passed. She hadn't managed to glean much from their conversation about why she had been nabbed. They'd complained at length about a new group of herders that had settled nearby, stronger and wealthier than their own folk. The boys were eager to blame the newcomers for everything from barren livestock to increased predator attacks on their own herds, each bravely reciting tales he'd heard of the foreigners' degenerate ways until Rose was rolling her eyes in disbelief. Mostly, though, they just talked about local girls they knew - who was easy, who was stuck-up, who was so ugly that they'd only shag her if they were blindfolded. It was infuriating. And strangely, it reminded Rose of when Jimmy Stone and his mates down at the pub would get a few too many pints in and complain about the girls who wouldn't go out with them and the foreigners who came and took all the jobs. That realization was enough to make Rose consider swearing off men entirely. The sun was low on the horizon when the two young men stopped talking and started fumbling at each other's waists, drunkenly kissing. Rose decided she'd had enough. The Doctor hadn't come to save her yet, and she wasn't going to sit around any longer waiting for him to do so. While her guards effectively distracted each other, Rose began to edge away, inch-worming along the dusty ground. The minor scuffling noises she was making were drowned out by the moans of her kidnappers. She had made it to the path that led from the valley to the cave when she heard the sounds of the rest of the gang approaching, sounding almost as drunk as her guards. There was still enough light in the darkening sky that she knew her captors would see her when they rounded the hill. With her main avenue of escape cut off, she changed tactics. Clenching her lips and eyes against the dust of the path, she rolled and scuttled up the slope to the cave. She slipped into the dubious safety of its shadows just as her youthful assailants appeared. Two of them carried squirming bundles, and she could hear the affronted wailing of babies. \"Where'd the girl go?\" she heard one of the returning boys demand. His voice reminded her of Jimmy's - the tones of a dedicated bully. She had to stifle a snicker at her guards' astonished realization of her absence. They rushed to deny that they'd shirked their duty, stumbling over each other's excuses. \"She... she just disappeared.\" \"The gods came to take her.\" \"The wolf... it came right out of the cave and gobbled her up!\" Lucky for the two boys - and Rose - the rest of the group was equally as inebriated. They accepted the improbable stories with much backslapping and admiration for the guards' bravery. All the while, the two bundles they passed around kept up a pitiful wailing. \"Give 'em here,\" the bully commanded, followed by a bit of shoving. The wailing stopped with a set of pained squeaks. \"I told you it would work. The wolf took the girl, and now it'll take these two brats. Give it a taste of foreigner flesh so it'll leave our stock alone!\" There was a ragged cheer, and more hiccupping wails as the bully dumped the two infants on the ground at the mouth of the cave, not three metres in front of her. The group moved down the hill, settling in for a night of drunken revelry. Soon enough the area outside the cave's mouth grew almost as dark as the area within, but she could see the shadows of torchlight and dancing bodies against the ground outside the cave. She wasn't out of the woods yet. Right. First things first was to get herself untied. It took a bit of wriggling and grunting, but she eventually managed to stretch her bound hands under her bum and bring them in front. Chewing the knots out after she'd removed her gag was more difficult. Her struggles had tightened them, and they were gritty and tasted like the rancid goat she'd been smelling all day. Picking through the bindings on her knees and feet wasn't any easier. \"That's what I get for not having long nails...or carrying a knife,\" she muttered to herself as she finally picked through the last knot and rubbed circulation back into her feet. Creeping to the edge of the shadows, she peered out of the cave. The young men were still drinking, but they'd moved from dancing and singing to sitting in a torch lit circle. They huddled together telling stories - scary ones, if their wide eyes were any indication. Some were lolling against their friends, while others openly groped and fondled each other. A year ago Rose would have been shocked, but travelling with the Doctor had opened her mind in more ways than one. Different time, different morality, she thought with a mental shrug. A snuffling noise drew her attention to the ground outside the mouth of the cave. The two bundles were still there and still making the odd unhappy whimper. Rose's eyes narrowed. There was 'different morality', and then there was child endangerment and infanticide. She had to get away and return those babies to their parents. She was wracking her brain to figure out how to sneak past the boys when she recalled their superstitious nonsense from earlier. \"It always comes back to wolves with me, doesn't it,\" she muttered to the babies. \"Why can't it be bunnies? Or kittens? I like kittens.\" Setting her shoulders, she took a deep breath and let out a long, low howl. \"AwrrooooooOOOOOOoooooo... awrr... AwrrrOOOOOOOooooooo\" As howls went, it wasn't brilliant, but it echoed weirdly in the cave, bouncing back and forth until what came out of the cave's mouth was far more eerie than what had come out of her mouth. Every boy in the camp stilled at that sound; even the babies fell silent. Then Rose was gratified to hear panicked scrambling, drunken shouts, and not a few adult whimpers as her assailants abandoned their camp with terrified haste. A few minutes later, Rose poked her head out to view the now empty hillside. Off down the hill, a few torches made a staggering progress through the night. With a self-satisfied smile, she scooped up the two swaddled infants, juggling them as best she could. She was just stepping out onto the path when a distant sound stopped her. A wolf's howl. It flooded the night from all directions. A chill swept over her, and a small stirring of pity for the fear she'd caused her kidnappers. \"Oh, bugger,\" she whispered. The wolf's howl sounded again. Closer this time. The beast was coming towards her. Clutching the infants to her, Rose did the only thing she could do. She ran. ---------------------------- He was going to kill her. The first Valentine's Day, she'd told him when he'd asked where she wanted to go. Silly apes, always believing that holidays were perpetually fixed in meaning. He'd told her that the first Valentine's Day had been celebrated with a boring papal session on regional tithes. Now the Lupercalia... that was something worth visiting. So he'd set the TARDIS coordinates and ignored her silly questions about whether there would be chocolates and something called message hearts. Don't wander off, he'd told her. Was it really that hard an instruction to follow? Apparently, it was. He'd only been talking to that herder for a few minutes, just long enough to discover that his girl had landed them several centuries earlier than he'd intended. The Lupercalia hadn't been established yet. The settlement that would one day be Rome was little more than a pastoralist base camp. The different tribal groups that would one day form the Civitas were still mired in petty antagonisms over land and livestock. Still, as near-misses went, he'd mark this one as a success. What an exciting opportunity this was for Rose to learn firsthand about the beginnings of modern civilization - much better than spending a day being subjected to a 21st century marketing nightmare. It even beat the Lupercalia, which he now vaguely recollected as involving men running naked through the streets of Rome, and possibly animal sacrifice. He tugged his leather jacket more closely about him and sent a silent wave of gratitude to the TARDIS for landing them here instead. She always had his back. He'd finished with the herder and turned back towards Rose, already concocting an impromptu lecture on the founding of Rome, only to discover that Rose was nowhere to be seen. He wandered the countryside for a bit, calling her name and getting increasingly exasperated. Really, he'd only had his back turned for a few minutes. How did she manage to disappear in that short time? It was a gift. Some people had a knack for knowing useless trivia, or winning cheap stuffed animals from those claw machine things. Rose could disappear in less time than it took to ask a local for directions. If they ever travelled to the early 20th century, he'd make a point of introducing her to Houdini. As it was, he found himself half-wishing for the 'spock' she was always asking him for, or at the very least that he carried his own superphone. He scanned the hilly countryside once more. It stubbornly refused to yield a blonde, or any indication as to her whereabouts. With a grimace and a deep sigh, he finally admitted to himself that once again a routine visit had taken a turn for the interesting, and that there was bound to be trouble in his near future, and perhaps a bit of running. He trudged in the direction of the herders' camp. The locals could usually be depended on to have some ideas about what might be threatening them, which in turn usually was related to whatever trouble his companion had stumbled into. He just hoped that Rose wouldn't be too put out with him over this slight mishap, otherwise he sensed that chocolates, message hearts, and a preponderance of pink cards with lacy edges would dominate his near future. It was that horrible prospect, more than any great worry over Rose's safety, that goaded the Doctor to pick up his pace. The sun was near setting when he reached the settlement, and it was immediately apparent that something was wrong. Several people were clustered about the main square and one woman in particular was wailing and keening so loudly that he had to force himself not to cover his ears. There was a bit of commotion when some of the men decided that the Doctor was the cause of their problems and tried to take him into custody, but he quickly sorted that out with his usual cheer and charm. It was so useful, the way that people just trusted him - so much more convenient than having to fight or sneak his way through calamity. Before long, he learned that the wailing woman had lost her children earlier that day, probably to some youths from one of the warring herding families. \"What would they want with your children?\" he asked. It never failed to boggle, how inventive humans could be in hurting each other for no apparent reason. In this day and age, hostages were usually individuals with high status, not babes in arms who might not live to see their fifth year. Also, these people didn't seem equipped to wage full-time war. They were still struggling with subsistence. \"It's the wolves,\" explained one older man who seemed to have taken charge. \"The winter has been lean, and they blame us for their lost livestock. No doubt they mean to leave the babes as sacrifice to the gods, to keep the wolves at bay.\" If there was any doubt in the Doctor's mind that Rose had somehow gotten mixed up in all this, that eradicated it. Wolves again. Always with the wolves. Promising to retrieve the missing children, he got directions from the villagers to the cave where their wolf-god lived. He set out into the darkening night. It was a long walk. Rose was always commenting on how much running they did, but really he thought they did a lot more walking. The running mostly just made up the bits at the beginning and the end. In the middle it was always the walking. Not that he minded. A nice walk at night in the Neolithic Italian countryside was just the thing to clear one's head. It would be nicer with Rose there, someone he could share his excitement with over the fact that he was climbing the slope of Palatine Hill - Palatine Hill! - before it had ever been settled. Not that Rose would understand at first, but she'd get excited because he was excited, and then she'd ask him to explain why he was excited. He'd tell her and she'd soak it up like a sponge until they were both excited together. He'd take her hand and tell her about Romulus and Remus, and the founding of Rome, and the mythic origins of the Lupercalia, and-- A flickering of torchlight in the distance above him drew him from his ruminations. He uncurled the fingers that had unconsciously sought Rose's hand, his walk becoming a jog. He was in the process of working out how best to approach the people who had abducted the babies (and Rose too, unless he very much missed his guess), when an eerie, strangely familiar howl split the night. He stopped dead in his tracks. It... it couldn't be. The wolf-god was supposed to be a legend. Yet there was no mistaking the panic that swept through the camp. Within moments, half-naked young men were running past him, running for their lives from the wolf's call. He caught one boy by the shoulders, swinging the youth around with the force of his own momentum. \"Where is she,\" the Doctor demanded, knowing he must look half-mad by the light of the receding torches. The boy gibbered his incomprehension, so the Doctor shook him. \"The girl you took earlier. Where is she? And the babies. What have you done with them?\" \"D-dead. Eaten. The Wolf got them.\" The boy glanced up the hill with wide-eyed panic, as if the wolf had appeared. The Doctor looked as well, and in that moment of distraction, the boy tore himself away and resume his mad rush down the hill. Rather than wasting time with the fleeing boy, the Doctor pulled out his sonic screwdriver. Rose was up there, and it seemed the she-wolf of Palatine was no myth. But he knew how to deal with wild animals. Flipping the screwdriver to a little-used setting, he placed it to his throat and howled. The call echoed in the night, filled with subsonic modulations that would interfere with the beta-brainwaves of Terran predatory beasts. He began jogging up the hill again, confident that any predator would back down from the challenge implicit in his call. He gave another sonic-modulated howl, just for good measure. The Doctor was so busy congratulating himself on his cleverness that he failed to see the form hurtling towards him until she was almost upon him. He only had time to raise his arms to catch her before she was barrelling him over and down the hillside. They rolled to a stop, coughing away the dust that had been kicked up. Rose was sprawled on top of him, which he might not have minded much except for the two yowling bundles squeezed between their bodies. \"Doctor!\" she gasped. \"Hello!\" He grinned above the indignant wailing. \"Fancy running into you out here. Except you ran into me.\" \"We have to run!\" Rose scrambled to her feet and shoved a baby into his arms. He checked it over with the sonic screwdriver, then turned the device on Rose's bundle. They both seemed unharmed, though likely to run out of oxygen if they kept up their crying. Rose tugged at his jacket. \"Did you hear me? There's a wolf out there, coming this way. We have to run.\" \"Naw. We'll be fine. The village is this way.\" He strolled back in the direction of the settlement, smiling serenely in the face of Rose's urgency. \"I took care of the wolf. By now she's probably halfway to Venice... or rather, where Venice will be in a few thousand years.\" \"You took care of... how?\" Rose had fallen in step with him, but kept checking back over her shoulder. He put the sonic screwdriver against his throat and howled again, regretting his demonstration when the bundles they carried resumed their infant arias. \"That... that was you? Both times?\" Rose asked. \"Well, the last two times. Time Lords have incredible natural mimicry abilities. The sonic screwdriver just amplifies the sound and adds subsonic harmonics that--what's so funny?\" Rose had stopped and was doubled over with laughter. He stopped as well, bemused. Maybe she was just relieved that the predator had been scared away. Humans and their peculiarities. They never failed to amaze and delight him. He began to smile as well, happy to see her safe and happy. \"You,\" she gasped through her laughter. \"You howled and scared away the wolf - the big, bad wolf.\" He was about to accuse her of belabouring the obvious when something in the way she was looking at him made him think back to that first howl he'd heard. It had sounded familiar, and now he realized why. He'd heard Rose howl like that in the TARDIS after they met Queen Victoria. She'd been the wolf all along. Wait a moment. He looked at her, then at the two bundles they were carrying, then back at the hill they'd just descended from. He recalled the half-naked young men running down the hillside. A wide grin split his face as he caught her gaze again. \"Rose Tyler,\" he said, taking her free hand in his. \"Lets get these babies back to their mother, and then do I have a story to tell you. It's about the origins of the Lupercalia--\" \"Doctor,\" she chuckled as he began leading her back the way he'd come. \"Really, it's been a long day, and not exactly the fun-filled holiday that you promised me. I don't know that I'm up for a history lecture. I just want to curl up somewhere on the TARDIS with a box of chocolate like I'd originally planned.\" \"Oh trust me. You'll love this one.\" His grin widened and he squeezed her hand. She never failed to amaze and delight him. \"It's fantastic!\"",

      "There was a ragged cheer, and more hiccupping wails as the bully dumped the two infants on the ground at the mouth of the cave, not three metres in front of her.",
      "The group moved down the hill, settling in for a night of drunken revelry.",
      "Soon enough the area outside the cave's mouth grew almost as dark as the area within, but she could see the shadows of torchlight and dancing bodies against the ground outside the cave.",
      "She wasn't out of the woods yet.",
      "Right.",
      "First things first was to get herself untied.",
      "It took a bit of wriggling and grunting, but she eventually managed to stretch her bound hands under her bum and bring them in front.",
      "Chewing the knots out after she'd removed her gag was more difficult.",
      "Her struggles had tightened them, and they were gritty and tasted like the rancid goat she'd been smelling all day.",
      "Picking through the bindings on her knees and feet wasn't any easier.",
      "\"That's what I get for not having long nails...or carrying a knife,\" she muttered to herself as she finally picked through the last knot and rubbed circulation back into her feet.",
      "Creeping to the edge of the shadows, she peered out of the cave.",
      "The young men were still drinking, but they'd moved from dancing and singing to sitting in a torch lit circle.",
      "They huddled together telling stories - scary ones, if their wide eyes were any indication.",
      "Some were lolling against their friends, while others openly groped and fondled each other.",
      "A year ago Rose would have been shocked, but travelling with the Doctor had opened her mind in more ways than one.",
      "Different time, different morality, she thought with a mental shrug.",
      "A snuffling noise drew her attention to the ground outside the mouth of the cave.",
      "The two bundles were still there and still making the odd unhappy whimper.",
      "Rose's eyes narrowed.",
      "There was 'different morality', and then there was child endangerment and infanticide.",
      "She had to get away and return those babies to their parents.",
      "She was wracking her brain to figure out how to sneak past the boys when she recalled their superstitious nonsense from earlier.",
      "\"It always comes back to wolves with me, doesn't it,\" she muttered to the babies.",
      "\"Why can't it be bunnies?",
      "Or kittens?",
      "I like kittens.\"",
      "Setting her shoulders, she took a deep breath and let out a long, low howl.",
      "\"AwrrooooooOOOOOOoooooo... awrr... AwrrrOOOOOOOooooooo\" As howls went, it wasn't brilliant, but it echoed weirdly in the cave, bouncing back and forth until what came out of the cave's mouth was far more eerie than what had come out of her mouth.",
      "Every boy in the camp stilled at that sound; even the babies fell silent.",
      "Then Rose was gratified to hear panicked scrambling, drunken shouts, and not a few adult whimpers as her assailants abandoned their camp with terrified haste.",
      "A few minutes later, Rose poked her head out to view the now empty hillside.",
      "Off down the hill, a few torches made a staggering progress through the night.",
      "With a self-satisfied smile, she scooped up the two swaddled infants, juggling them as best she could.",
      "She was just stepping out onto the path when a distant sound stopped her.",
      "A wolf's howl.",
      "It flooded the night from all directions.",
      "A chill swept over her, and a small stirring of pity for the fear she'd caused her kidnappers.",
      "\"Oh, bugger,\" she whispered.",
      "The wolf's howl sounded again.",
      "Closer this time.",
      "The beast was coming towards her.",
      "Clutching the infants to her, Rose did the only thing she could do.",
      "She ran.",
      "---------------------------- He was going to kill her.",
      "The first Valentine's Day, she'd told him when he'd asked where she wanted to go.",
      "Silly apes, always believing that holidays were perpetually fixed in meaning.",
      "He'd told her that the first Valentine's Day had been celebrated with a boring papal session on regional tithes.",
      "Now the Lupercalia... that was something worth visiting.",
      "So he'd set the TARDIS coordinates and ignored her silly questions about whether there would be chocolates and something called message hearts.",
      "Don't wander off, he'd told her.",
      "Was it really that hard an instruction to follow?",
      "Apparently, it was.",
      "He'd only been talking to that herder for a few minutes, just long enough to discover that his girl had landed them several centuries earlier than he'd intended.",
      "The Lupercalia hadn't been established yet.",
      "The settlement that would one day be Rome was little more than a pastoralist base camp.",
      "The different tribal groups that would one day form the Civitas were still mired in petty antagonisms over land and livestock.",
      "Still, as near-misses went, he'd mark this one as a success.",
      "What an exciting opportunity this was for Rose to learn firsthand about the beginnings of modern civilization - much better than spending a day being subjected to a 21st century marketing nightmare.",
      "It even beat the Lupercalia, which he now vaguely recollected as involving men running naked through the streets of Rome, and possibly animal sacrifice.",
      "He tugged his leather jacket more closely about him and sent a silent wave of gratitude to the TARDIS for landing them here instead.",
      "She always had his back.",
      "He'd finished with the herder and turned back towards Rose, already concocting an impromptu lecture on the founding of Rome, only to discover that Rose was nowhere to be seen.",
      "He wandered the countryside for a bit, calling her name and getting increasingly exasperated.",
      "Really, he'd only had his back turned for a few minutes.",
      "How did she manage to disappear in that short time?",
      "It was a gift.",
      "Some people had a knack for knowing useless trivia, or winning cheap stuffed animals from those claw machine things.",
      "Rose could disappear in less time than it took to ask a local for directions.",
      "If they ever travelled to the early 20th century, he'd make a point of introducing her to Houdini.",
      "As it was, he found himself half-wishing for the 'spock' she was always asking him for, or at the very least that he carried his own superphone.",
      "He scanned the hilly countryside once more.",
      "It stubbornly refused to yield a blonde, or any indication as to her whereabouts.",
      "With a grimace and a deep sigh, he finally admitted to himself that once again a routine visit had taken a turn for the interesting, and that there was bound to be trouble in his near future, and perhaps a bit of running.",
      "He trudged in the direction of the herders' camp.",
      "The locals could usually be depended on to have some ideas about what might be threatening them, which in turn usually was related to whatever trouble his companion had stumbled into.",
      "He just hoped that Rose wouldn't be too put out with him over this slight mishap, otherwise he sensed that chocolates, message hearts, and a preponderance of pink cards with lacy edges would dominate his near future.",
      "It was that horrible prospect, more than any great worry over Rose's safety, that goaded the Doctor to pick up his pace.",
      "The sun was near setting when he reached the settlement, and it was immediately apparent that something was wrong.",
      "Several people were clustered about the main square and one woman in particular was wailing and keening so loudly that he had to force himself not to cover his ears.",
      "There was a bit of commotion when some of the men decided that the Doctor was the cause of their problems and tried to take him into custody, but he quickly sorted that out with his usual cheer and charm.",
      "It was so useful, the way that people just trusted him - so much more convenient than having to fight or sneak his way through calamity.",
      "Before long, he learned that the wailing woman had lost her children earlier that day, probably to some youths from one of the warring herding families.",
      "\"What would they want with your children?\" he asked.",
      "It never failed to boggle, how inventive humans could be in hurting each other for no apparent reason.",
      "In this day and age, hostages were usually individuals with high status, not babes in arms who might not live to see their fifth year.",
      "Also, these people didn't seem equipped to wage full-time war.",
      "They were still struggling with subsistence.",
      "\"It's the wolves,\" explained one older man who seemed to have taken charge.",
      "\"The winter has been lean, and they blame us for their lost livestock.",
      "No doubt they mean to leave the babes as sacrifice to the gods, to keep the wolves at bay.\"",
      "If there was any doubt in the Doctor's mind that Rose had somehow gotten mixed up in all this, that eradicated it.",
      "Wolves again.",
      "Always with the wolves.",
      "Promising to retrieve the missing children, he got directions from the villagers to the cave where their wolf-god lived.",
      "He set out into the darkening night.",
      "It was a long walk.",
      "Rose was always commenting on how much running they did, but really he thought they did a lot more walking.",
      "The running mostly just made up the bits at the beginning and the end.",
      "In the middle it was always the walking.",
      "Not that he minded.",
      "A nice walk at night in the Neolithic Italian countryside was just the thing to clear one's head.",
      "It would be nicer with Rose there, someone he could share his excitement with over the fact that he was climbing the slope of Palatine Hill - Palatine Hill!",
      "- before it had ever been settled.",
      "Not that Rose would understand at first, but she'd get excited because he was excited, and then she'd ask him to explain why he was excited.",
      "He'd tell her and she'd soak it up like a sponge until they were both excited together.",
      "He'd take her hand and tell her about Romulus and Remus, and the founding of Rome, and the mythic origins of the Lupercalia, and-- A flickering of torchlight in the distance above him drew him from his ruminations.",
      "He uncurled the fingers that had unconsciously sought Rose's hand, his walk becoming a jog.",
      "He was in the process of working out how best to approach the people who had abducted the babies (and Rose too, unless he very much missed his guess), when an eerie, strangely familiar howl split the night.",
      "He stopped dead in his tracks.",
      "It... it couldn't be.",
      "The wolf-god was supposed to be a legend.",
      "Yet there was no mistaking the panic that swept through the camp.",
      "Within moments, half-naked young men were running past him, running for their lives from the wolf's call.",
      "He caught one boy by the shoulders, swinging the youth around with the force of his own momentum.",
      "\"Where is she,\" the Doctor demanded, knowing he must look half-mad by the light of the receding torches.",
      "The boy gibbered his incomprehension, so the Doctor shook him.",
      "\"The girl you took earlier.",
      "Where is she?",
      "And the babies.",
      "What have you done with them?\" \"D-dead.",
      "Eaten.",
      "The Wolf got them.\"",
      "The boy glanced up the hill with wide-eyed panic, as if the wolf had appeared.",
      "The Doctor looked as well, and in that moment of distraction, the boy tore himself away and resume his mad rush down the hill.",
      "Rather than wasting time with the fleeing boy, the Doctor pulled out his sonic screwdriver.",
      "Rose was up there, and it seemed the she-wolf of Palatine was no myth.",
      "But he knew how to deal with wild animals.",
      "Flipping the screwdriver to a little-used setting, he placed it to his throat and howled.",
      "The call echoed in the night, filled with subsonic modulations that would interfere with the beta-brainwaves of Terran predatory beasts.",
      "He began jogging up the hill again, confident that any predator would back down from the challenge implicit in his call.",
      "He gave another sonic-modulated howl, just for good measure.",
      "The Doctor was so busy congratulating himself on his cleverness that he failed to see the form hurtling towards him until she was almost upon him.",
      "He only had time to raise his arms to catch her before she was barrelling him over and down the hillside.",
      "They rolled to a stop, coughing away the dust that had been kicked up.",
      "Rose was sprawled on top of him, which he might not have minded much except for the two yowling bundles squeezed between their bodies.",
      "\"Doctor!\"",
      "she gasped.",
      "\"Hello!\"",
      "He grinned above the indignant wailing.",
      "\"Fancy running into you out here.",
      "Except you ran into me.\"",
      "\"We have to run!\"",
      "Rose scrambled to her feet and shoved a baby into his arms.",
      "He checked it over with the sonic screwdriver, then turned the device on Rose's bundle.",
      "They both seemed unharmed, though likely to run out of oxygen if they kept up their crying.",
      "Rose tugged at his jacket.",
      "\"Did you hear me?",
      "There's a wolf out there, coming this way.",
      "We have to run.\"",
      "\"Naw.",
      "We'll be fine.",
      "The village is this way.\"",
      "He strolled back in the direction of the settlement, smiling serenely in the face of Rose's urgency.",
      "\"I took care of the wolf.",
      "By now she's probably halfway to Venice... or rather, where Venice will be in a few thousand years.\"",
      "\"You took care of... how?\" Rose had fallen in step with him, but kept checking back over her shoulder.",
      "He put the sonic screwdriver against his throat and howled again, regretting his demonstration when the bundles they carried resumed their infant arias.",
      "\"That... that was you?",
      "Both times?\" Rose asked.",
      "\"Well, the last two times.",
      "Time Lords have incredible natural mimicry abilities.",
      "The sonic screwdriver just amplifies the sound and adds subsonic harmonics that--what's so funny?\" Rose had stopped and was doubled over with laughter.",
      "He stopped as well, bemused.",
      "Maybe she was just relieved that the predator had been scared away.",
      "Humans and their peculiarities.",
      "They never failed to amaze and delight him.",
      "He began to smile as well, happy to see her safe and happy.",
      "\"You,\" she gasped through her laughter.",
      "\"You howled and scared away the wolf - the big, bad wolf.\"",
      "He was about to accuse her of belabouring the obvious when something in the way she was looking at him made him think back to that first howl he'd heard.",
      "It had sounded familiar, and now he realized why.",
      "He'd heard Rose howl like that in the TARDIS after they met Queen Victoria.",
      "She'd been the wolf all along.",
      "Wait a moment.",
      "He looked at her, then at the two bundles they were carrying, then back at the hill they'd just descended from.",
      "He recalled the half-naked young men running down the hillside.",
      "A wide grin split his face as he caught her gaze again.",
      "\"Rose Tyler,\" he said, taking her free hand in his.",
      "\"Lets get these babies back to their mother, and then do I have a story to tell you.",
      "It's about the origins of the Lupercalia--\" \"Doctor,\" she chuckled as he began leading her back the way he'd come.",
      "\"Really, it's been a long day, and not exactly the fun-filled holiday that you promised me.",
      "I don't know that I'm up for a history lecture.",
      "I just want to curl up somewhere on the TARDIS with a box of chocolate like I'd originally planned.\"",
      "\"Oh trust me.",
      "You'll love this one.\"",
      "His grin widened and he squeezed her hand.",
      "She never failed to amaze and delight him.",
      "\"It's fantastic!\""

    "text": "Loki was sitting on a branch of Yggdrasil that looked like a summer palace in an Arabian desert. He seated himself on one of the leaves that looked like a balcony and watched the sands roll. When Eris approached, he glanced up with a smile and pretended he didn't see the slightly shell-shocked look on her face. \"So,\" he asked mildly as she sat in the chair opposite him, \"did she like it?\" He pushed a glass cup of rose-scented sharbat across the table towards her, to help with the heat. He was having trouble with it himself, not that he would ever say that. Eris could draw her own conclusions from the fact that he was wearing the bare minimum of diaphanous veils to stay decent. \"...Yes,\" she replied slowly. \"She liked it. Everything went according to plan.\" This was less effort than most people put into lying to the lie smith. Loki could put that down to disquiet at how spectacularly this plan had not gone according to itself. He sipped from his own melting sharbat. \"I'm glad,\" he said. \"I was only a little worried, because people have been telling me stories... I'm sure they're nothing. So, when you gave it to her, what did she say?\" Eris covered the instinctive grimace by rearranging herself in her seat. Loki obliged by following the motion of her legs with his eyes (they may have had an unspoken agreement to never act on it, but Loki wasn't going to deny that he enjoyed looking). \"I thought it would be better if I didn't just walk up and hand it to her,\" Eris said. \"She'd only assume it was some kind of trick.\" \"From you?\" Loki murmured. \"Surely not.\" Eris ignored him. \"So I left it for her in a place I knew she'd find it.\" \"That seems wise,\" allowed Loki. \"Somewhere only she would find it, I assume?\" As if they didn't both know the answer. Eris gave up pretending and glared at him, which Loki felt was unfair considering that she was the one who had deviated from a perfectly good plan in order to cause chaos. After all the trouble Loki had gone to in procuring one of Idunn's own crop for her - Athena had expressed interest in finding out how they worked, in the link between the apples of Asgard and Olympus' own ambrosia. If Eris could present her with an apple as a gift, it would be one more step towards wriggling her way into Athena's... good graces. And there were plenty of things she could think of to do there. Instead, Troy had become embroiled in war. Against half the civilised world. Because, try as she might, when Eris got her hands on one of the Apples of Idunn, she couldn't limit herself to following the plan. Loki didn't begrudge her using him to obtain the apple - he abused her trust often enough - but he did feel a little exasperation that she had wasted it. Golden apples were difficult to come by, and if she'd played this properly she could have been back on the level with her pantheon; back where she could scheme in peace without everyone wondering what she was up to. Instead? War. \"Are you telling me, dearest, that something went wrong?\" he asked, wide-eyed in mock astonishment. All of a sudden, Eris deflated. Her glare withered and she picked at her sharbat glass. \"So maybe Hera and Aphrodite found it too. And thought it was theirs.\" \"Maybe?\" \"There's a tiny possibility that happened, completely by accident. And it might have turned into an argument.\" \"Funny how those things happen around you. So, did Athena even get the apple?\" Eris watched the desert sands vaguely. \"Aphrodite, I think.\" \"Outstanding. And after that?\" \"There may have been some kind of war involved.\" Loki said nothing. \"Among the mortals.\" Still nothing. \"All of the mortals.\" \"Well.\" Loki joined her in observing the horizon as though it was interesting. \"That's not what you hoped would happen, is it?\" Eris shook her head, and Loki could pretend not to see the nascent smirk. \"And when you wrote on the apple, to the fairest, that was your attempt to show beyond doubt who the apple was intended for? You didn't think about what the others might have to say about that?\" asked Loki flatly. Eris shook her head firmly. \"No.\" \"You didn't.\" \"I did not.\" \"I believe you.\" \"You should.\" \"Clearly, you are telling the perfect truth.\" Loki watched her toy with her sharbat spoon, avoiding his eye, and let the silence go on just longer than was comfortable. Then- \"Was it funny, at least?\" Eris' face split in a rueful but genuine grin. \"Darling, you should have been there.\"",

    "text": "Disclaimer: The Greeks Myths are in the public domain, yet they are not mine nor are the characters who appear here or are mentioned. \"Transfiguration\" \"Everything changes, everything grows, and everything dies; that is with the sole exception of things that have known a semblance of ever having been alive.\" \"Change, I must admit, is difficult, but I see your point, because it is neither good nor bad,\" Apollo replied. \"It is simply changing.\" He conceded the point when they engage in their semi-annual debate on the nature of such things. He lost track of the tally somewhere along the fifth or fourth decade stemming from the rise and fall of Olympus' zenith. \"Do you ever miss Olympus?\" Artemis inquired in their travels. \"I would not say I miss any one place, but the company, aye, that was good, and the contests of art and music those I do long for.\" \"Time was when I too desired the company of our fellows and it pulled at my heart to be away from the forest that was ever in my heart,\" Artemis mused. \"You were ever a solitary one by nature,\" Apollo replied with a tender smile. \"Time was when even one who is solitary enjoys company,\" she replied a bit more sharply than she had intended. She glimpsed that celebrated bronzed profile as turns a bit away from her piercing stare and wonders if he took offense at her sharp tone then realized that he is thinking perhaps of the time when he too had once desired solitude at the places he had known, Delphos. After a few moments of awkward silence had elapsed, Apollo turned to regard his twin sister once more. This time his expression on his mobile and handsome face is as smooth as silk, which makes her wonder that he could ever have been as subtle and cunning as his reputation had declared him to be. She can read his moods and thoughts as easily as reading a scroll. Still, is he as subtle as his reputation declared him? Perhaps even more so and she hoped that as close as they have become over the past few decades that more remains for them to discover about one another and the new world in which they find themselves in. Time to an immortal is as fluid as the flowing of a vast and mighty river. And much like a river, they both have discovered that one can either find a means by which to navigate that river or be swallowed up by it. He likes the river metaphor mainly because of its fluidity, the way in which an actual river will reflect sunlight off of its mirrored surface no matter what position the sun he is lord over holds in the sky. Artemis preferred the moon. He knows this and does not begrudge her for preferring it over the day-star. The moon is a friend to hunters, or huntresses, for lovers, and for dreamers. Considering all its phases, it's waxing and waning, it is too pale and cold a satellite for his bright spirit. I said it. Although she can't recall where she heard it, no doubt it was a mortal philosopher: perhaps Plato or was it, Aristotle? Artemis thinks that the gods' power waxes and wanes like the moon and when mortals stop believing and/or worshipping the Immortals their power is thereby sapped just a little more. She paused in the hunt that is more ceremonial than practical and turns to face her brother/ her lover and shakes her mane of winter-kissed brown hair. \"We are and ever shall be survivors.\" \"What are we surviving for?\" He asks, not so much because he does not understand what she says, or by what she left unsaid. Is that, in his present mood, he enjoys being contradictory, obstinate. It is a game they play, on the hunt, exploring new regions, new civilizations, and new ways of doing things that the ever-expanding tribes of humanity have discovered. Every so often they encountered other deities worshipped and importuned too by these new tribes who dwell outside of the realms they have known among the Hellenes and their conquered territories. Most of the time these encounters have led to strife, and it is fortunate that both he and she have had extensive training in the art of warfare. Artemis thinks that within the memory of gods and mortals alike the warring among their kind had more than likely had dire consequences on the mortal plane. At other times they found parallels among the gods/goddesses of these other tribes and even unlikely friendships. Apollo, tilting his leonine head to one side as thinking over his next words, thinks that indeed they are the fortunate ones, for they have not only survived to the changes wrought upon their world but thrived as well. They have come far in their meandering travels across the world, from the planes and valleys, and sundry islands of the Hellenes, to the deserts of the east, to the steppes to north and east; yet there is always more lying tantalizing just over the next valley, the next mountain, and they journey on. Curiosity begs them on, too impatient in the way of deities to linger over-long in any one place as appealing or welcoming it might be, or whatever it might have in the way of amenities, population, and civilization to recommend one place over another. \"Artemis, dearest Artemis, verily I would not have come so far nor done as well as I have if not for your company and counsel.\" He reached for her to take her into his arms as they embraced. Artemis replied. \"I should be very content in your company.\" Much to her surprise, she discovered she meant every word. In the back of her mind, she thinks, \"we are traveling together, you and I, and if there is any power while this world shall last to make it so we shall not be parted bliss or woe.'",

    "text": "There was once a man who lived here for many years. If you look around maybe you can see it. The very nature of this place has been changed, as all places are changed by the events that happen on their soil. But listen and I will tell you the tale. Once there was a man named Philoctetes. He was a Greek by birth and grew to be a strong warrior, one who might one day do his country proud. He was raised following in the footsteps of greater warriors. And as a child, was a friend to the great Hercules himself. At Hercules' funeral when all the others present were to fearful to light the pyre Philoctetes stepped in. For his bravery, his honor, and his love, Hercules gifted him with his own bow. Great is the legend and fame of Hercules' bow. It is truth that with Hercules' death it did not fade from history but passed on to Philoctetes. So when the war came, Philoctetes was anxious to do his country proud and embarked with the first ships to Troy. But, he never made it there. But the fates three spun a different destiny for Philoctetes. On the island of Lemnos while praying to the gods for safe, quick passage to Troy, Philoctetes was bitten by a snake. This was no ordinary snake but one that dwelled in the shrine and so it too had gained a certain majesty to its venom. The wound it made with its venomous fangs would not heal. Instead it stayed raw and bleeding, infected and oozing puss. Such a stench came from the wound that while perhaps the other soldiers might have wished to help Philoctetes, they were so revolted by his stench and cries of pain that they dared not come near him. Odysseus, the commander under whom Philoctetes had sailed forsook the fallen soldier, looking to the rest of his men. Odysseus you may also know, and if you do you will remember that he is quick of foot and silver of tongue, and values no one better than himself. And so Odysseus looked to Philoctetes and saw that he could not be of use and would only dampen the spirits of the men. So late in the night Odysseus broke camp and quietly set sail, leaving the dreaming Philoctetes alone on the Island with his pain. Now many years went by and Philoctetes lived alone, suffering slowly, daily, his wounded leg dragging behind him. He was alive only for his bow, with which he killed the birds and small creatures of the island. The bow that would not miss sustained Philoctetes so that he might one day return to his home, and tell of his betrayal by the Greeks. For this Philoctetes waited. While many would have given up Philoctetes did not let his pain or isolation rule him, instead he lived on the burning coal of anger which festered in his gut. Some say not even Posidon could have kept a grudge so hot so long, banked coals always read to be stirred to life. It was into this dismal living that Neoptolomis came. Neoptolimus son of another great warrior, Achilles who first sailed to Troy with both Philoctetes and Odsyeus. Achilles had been slain in battle and a prophecy made that only his blood might bring down the walls of Troy. And so Neoptolomis had been summoned to Troy, to fight in his father's place, to win the war for the Greeks. But more did the prophecy hold. Odysseus came with Neoptolimis to the Island of Lemnos for the oracle had said that only with Achilles' kin and Hercules' bow might Troy be finally taken. And so Odysseus had brought Neoptolimus to the place where Philoctetes lived, suffering. Wily Odysseus planned to use one tool to ensnare the other and thus bring both to Troy together. And so Odysseus said to Neoptolimus: \"There is a man here, Named Philoctetes. He has the bow, that, together with you, will win our war\" Deep was the gaze of neoptlimus, for he understood the greatness of this task. Yet a sudden doubt struck him. \"I cannot lie to this man, I cannot steal from him. It is not honorable and I will not do it.\" Odysseus was un-swayed, for he knew Neoptolimus was young and idealistic so he spoke carefully as parents are want to: \"You do not have to lie to him, you can tell him the truth, you are the Greek son of Achilles, you can befriend him, being just yourself for you are pure and good and Philoctetes will see that and trust you. All you must do is get him to give you the bow, nothing more. It is a boon any friend would give. And perhaps one day you will return it. You only have to tell the truth. I will lie for you, as you cannot do it.\" And so Neoptolimus grudgingly agreed. Now Philoctetes lived in a cave on the island. It was not difficult to find, perhaps if you go there today you may still see it. A cave by a stream with a soft bed of leaves and small animal bones in piles by the door, everything close together and soft scraped paths from Philoctetes dragging leg. There he lived, behind the curtain of stained rags drying in the sun. It was there Neoptolimus waited for Philoctetes to return. And it was not till his return. Now you can hear Philoctetes coming from a ways away. He moans as he walks, every time his foot scrapes the ground, as it does with every step; for even the thickest and softest of rags will not dull such a pain. And so Neoptolimus knew of Philoctetes approach and composed himself till the distinct sound of Philoctetes dragging limb echoed in the clearing by the cave and the stream. And so it was then that Philoctetes found Neoptolemus sitting in the sunlight by his meager home, and Neoptolemus looked so young and innocent that Philoctetes did not think to draw his bow. Instead he questioned his visitor. \"Who are you and where might you be from. For you see I have seen no one for these past dozen years. And if I did not know better I would say my eye as pain blinded as my leg\". And Neoptolemus answered honestly. \"I am Neoptolemus, son of Achilles\" Philoctetes started at that: \"A Greek! Oh that you would not had told me for I am sworn to hate all Greeks. I am Philoctetes, and this is the Island of Lemnos. Being Greek surely you have heard the story.\" And Neoptolemus nodded yes, for it was a story that many knew. As stories of fallen heroes often travel and a friend to Hercules lost to an injury was a blow to the war. \"I have heard of you Philoctetes. I do know who you are. But you need not hate all Greeks. I have done nothing, and there are many who would have you return to Troy. Would you return to Troy?\" Philoctetes saw in his face such innocence that still he did not draw Heracles great bow. \"I would not return to Troy. The Greeks have forsaken me, and I will not now come to their aid. Where is it you are bound? Perhaps I might go there with you?\" \"I am bound for Troy. To replace my fallen father.\" Neoptolimus answered. \"Your fathers fallen he that shone gloriously among all the rest? The great Achilles?\" \"Yes, he is dead. Killed by Paris. And so I am summoned for it is prophesied that only when I am there may Troy fall.\" \"And knowing my story, the betrayal of the Greeks you would go to war, to their aid?\" Philoctetes asked. \"There are many stories Philoctetes.\" Neoptolemus answered. \"I do not wish to go to war, but it is my prophecy. Like your very wound, it is not something I can change.\" For Neoptolemus believed this to be true. Only with him, and the bow, would Troy fall, and until then many more would die like his father. Hearing his words Philoctetes was moved by his conviction. \"You are truly a loyal Greek. I believed the same as you did once. Come, we will eat together before you must sail again.\" And Neoptolemus agreed. They sat by the clear running stream and Philoctetes unwrapped his foot, the dark red of the wound glistening sickly in the warm light of the evening. \"Does it truly never heal.\" Neoptolemus asked. \"Never, and it never will. The pain is always there, and often the infection. Some days are worse than others. You find when you live completely in your pain, and that is all there is, that then it becomes the only thing that makes sense. And so I hate the Greeks, you can understand. Some days I can't remember Greece.\" \"I've never felt that kind of pain. But it must surely hurt.\" \"You are going into battle. You'll come to understand.\" \"If it is the same why don't you come with us.\" \"Because this is pain I can choose. They forsook me in my pain and so it is no pain but my own. I will not bear the pain of a nation. This is great enough.\" And he spoke these words, as if they had been a summoning Philoctetes doubled over shaking like the earth shakes when Poseidon is displeased. Neoptolemus caught him, looking past the rising stench and bleeding wound to the man beneath, With a great strength did he shield Philoctetes from his own convulsions. Long were the shadows and lat the evening when Philoctetes subsided. From the cool stream did he bring clear waters to sooth the pain and ease his thurst. Neoptolemus carried him into the and carried him into the cave upon the bed of leaves he laid him. \"I must leave for now.\" He said, aware that Odysseus would be waiting. He looked to the bow, which Philoctetes held loosely in his hands. It was Neoptolemus' duty, it was the prophecy, but yet he still did not ask. Did not move to take the bow. And Philoctetes watching his younger friend held out the bow. \"Your eyes weigh heavy upon it. You alone are worthy of such a treasure. Through the stench of my vile affliction, through the pains and howls of a bedviled man have you waited. The kindness of an ear offered have you given. You are worthy of it, you and you alone have stayed with me through pain, through the smell, you have listened. If you are a Greek you are an honest one. Worthy to hold the bow. Come back in the morning, I would speak with you when I am well.\" Philoctetes with a prayer to the god Morpheus slipped into into the land of dreams leaving Neoptolemus alone beside him in the cave. A choice was laid before Neoptolemus Yet for long minutes he stood, alone between the two decisions and did not move. It was in this way that Odyseuss came upon him, searching for the boy in the dark of the island. \"You have the bow, come away. We must ready the ships to leave.\" Philoctetes did not wake at the voice, though even in his sleep he twitched, reaching for his bow, the bow that Neoptolemus held, to strike at his enemy. And still Neoptolemus stood, holding the bow between two choices. Odysseus would leave, as he had left before, deep in the night stealing away from Philoctetes, leaving him to die. Abandoning him behind while Troy was toppled and Trojans killed and the Greeks raised to stand victorious on their pile of corpses. Philoctetes would not go to war, but would give up his bow to a Greek who was honest. Neoptolemus knew all these things and knew the pain of Philoctetes and thought of the pain of a Nation, and still he held still, standing between. \"You have the bow and we must leave or Troy will never fall.\" Neoptolemus turned and asked. \"If Troy does not fall what then?\" \"If Troy does not fall then the Greeks will bleed themselves to death against it's walls. And Greeks will die and our Nation will kill itself upon Troy. And the Trojans will win.\" \"But why must I go to Troy?\" Odysseus' word grew strange, otherworldly was his whisper, \"For it is with the bow and blood that troy shall fall\" Neoptolemus knew it was true and held the bow tightly, looking back to Philoctetes. \"And what will it end. Will Greeks not still die, will Philoctetes not be dead. He is my friend.\" \"And the Greeks are your people.\" \"They are. They are my people and he is my people, and why must they die?\" \"Because we are at war. Because we must win against the Trojans. There is no other choice.\" But Neoptolemus shook his head. \"No. There is always another choice.\" Because Neoptolemus was the prophecy, he held the bow and he was the blood of Achilles. \"If we leave, if we leave Troy, then the Trojan walls will fall. They will not need walls if we don't attack. And the war will end because if we don't fight we will not be at war. We went there for one man and one woman, how are they worth all the Greeks bleeding on the Trojan fields? I will not go, and the bow will not go and without me you will be forced to return. Or else the death of the Nation is upon your head. If the Trojans ever come to us we will have the bow and you will have me, and Philoctetes. If your army is at home it will win, for who would dare invade the Greeks while we live in a powerful peace. If we leave, then they too will learn with their blood and bows to end it, to take down their walls and to simply live.\" Neoptolemus finished. Odysseus stood with all his years as a soldier bearing his back straight and his head high, the weight of a nation on his shoulders. Neoptolemus held the bow, and he held his ground. Odysseus turned without speaking and left for the ships. A choice was made, two choices. Each with an end to the war, just as the prophecy had spoken. The blood and the bow would end it, for one man to understand is not for many, but the words of prophecy were spoken.",

    "text": "\"Stay,\" Arthur says. It is a request, not a command; his face is stoic, a mask, unbroken, but his eyes are bright and pleading, and Merlin's heart aches at the sight of him. \"I can't.\" Merlin has never wished more for his words to be a lie. The Underworld is no place for a son of the harvest goddess, but he has come to love this cold, dead kingdom and its heir, this man more suited to the sun and the light than the darkness and grief his father festers in. Merlin thinks he may love Arthur more than he ever loved the sun itself, the warmth of it on his body as he tended the earth, gathered the crops with his mother. They had called him Kore above, before; a cruel joke at his expense, nineteen and still untouched, until Arthur held him in his arms and took him to his bed. He'd been gentle, considerate, even sweet, all in stark contrast to the arrogance and bravado he'd worn when they'd first met; when they kissed, it was like basking in sunlight, and Arthur's touch set him aflame with a passion he hadn't known he possessed. If Merlin had wanted him, coveted him from their first meeting, then it was in that moment he had fallen in love, and now his body burns with anguish at the knowledge they will have to separate, perhaps never see one another again. \"What if you could?\" Arthur's eyes are saying please, and Merlin wants to beg him not to do this to him, that this is hard enough without false hope. \"I can't,\" Merlin repeats. \"My mother needs me--the land needs me, Arthur. The world is dying.\" \"But what if there was a way?\" Arthur asks, as Merlin's eyes drop from Arthur's to his cupped hands. \"A loophole, so you didn't have to go?\" The prince holds an open pomegranate, its seeds as bright and bloody as the red Arthur wears, and it strikes Merlin that he is hungry; he does not remember having eaten since he arrived here and he does not know how many moons ago that was. He also does not remember feeling hunger in that time. Merlin sucks in a breath. He knows exactly what Arthur is offering him, what will happen if he eats the seeds his mouth waters for: an eternity in the dark, cold Underworld, where he will never see dawn or dusk again, where he will never feel the grass beneath his feet and the wind against his skin and the sun on his back, where his mother will never roam. But he knows what else the pomegranate means, for his mother--more than the simple harvest goddess they mistake her for--has taught him all she knows; it is the only fruit that will grow here, in this dead world, and it is the fruit of their queen. It means an eternity with his prince, his love, his erastes; it means they will be joined forever, one whole in two halves. \"Not all of them,\" Merlin says. Arthur's mask cracks: a hopeful smile falters before it can even truly begin and his brow furrows briefly; Merlin wonders if they are not already whole, if he can read Arthur with such ease. \"How many?\" His prince eyes him warily, as if he suspects Merlin is planning to walk out and never return; Merlin wants to eat the entire pomegranate, press his smeared lips to Arthur's cheeks and nose and mouth and promise he'll never leave. \"Six,\" Merlin answers. \"Half the year down here,\" Arthur says, \"and half the year up there.\" \"Half the year with you,\" Merlin corrects, \"and half with my mother. I can't leave her, Arthur. She needs me.\" Arthur smiles softly and he brings one hand to cup Merlin's face; the unspoken as I need you hangs between them, but Arthur is already pushing a pomegranate seed between Merlin's lips. He feeds them to him, one-by-one, and Merlin breaks the flesh of each one as they pass between his teeth, the sweet and sharp taste coating his tongue as he swallows. He has eaten the fifth when Arthur kisses him, possessive, and feeds the sixth and last seed into his mouth, while a fire starts at the base of Merlin's spine and in the pit of his stomach. He has barely swallowed the seed when he returns the kiss with a passion, with the same fire that fills his body; he wants Arthur to take him again, to mark him with teeth and nails and love, so he may leave the Underworld with some trace of his lover still on him. But there is not enough time; the psychopomp, their messenger god, waits on the banks with the ferryman to return Merlin to his mother, before Hunith kills the world in her despair that she has sent her son into hiding only for him to never return. \"I want--\" Merlin starts when they part, chasing Arthur's mouth, but Arthur grips him by the shoulders and holds him at arm's length. \"So do I,\" Arthur says, and Merlin notices how flushed his cheeks look, how swollen his lips are. \"But if you don't go now, I don't think I can let you leave.\" Merlin's pulse races and it only makes him want Arthur more, but he nods his understanding and Arthur gathers him into an embrace, wraps his arms around Merlin's waist and holds him tightly. Merlin burrows his face in Arthur's neck and breathes him in, tries to hold onto the scent of him. \"When you come back, eromenos,\" Arthur promises, his voice a pleasant rumble against Merlin's ear. \"We'll have time for that... and other things too.\" Merlin's heart aches with what he knows now to be love and he presses frantic kisses to Arthur's cheek between a litany of, I love you, I love you, I love you, whispered into his ear. \"Come back to me,\" Arthur says when they part, and Merlin hears I love you and I need you and don't leave me. \"I'll come back,\" Merlin says, smiling. \"I have to, now. But I have one request.\" \"Anything.\" It comes out more breathlessly than he thinks Arthur intends and that knowledge alone is more precious than any gift Arthur could bestow upon him. \"Don't forget about me in the meantime.\" For the first time since they have met, Arthur throws his head back in genuine laughter, body shaking with mirth. \"Merlin,\" he says, his smile wide as he presses one last kiss to Merlin's knuckles, \"I don't think I could forget about you if I drank from the river Lethe itself.\"",

      "\"I can't.\"",
      "Merlin has never wished more for his words to be a lie.",
      "The Underworld is no place for a son of the harvest goddess, but he has come to love this cold, dead kingdom and its heir, this man more suited to the sun and the light than the darkness and grief his father festers in.",
      "Merlin thinks he may love Arthur more than he ever loved the sun itself, the warmth of it on his body as he tended the earth, gathered the crops with his mother.",
      "They had called him Kore above, before; a cruel joke at his expense, nineteen and still untouched, until Arthur held him in his arms and took him to his bed.",
      "He'd been gentle, considerate, even sweet, all in stark contrast to the arrogance and bravado he'd worn when they'd first met; when they kissed, it was like basking in sunlight, and Arthur's touch set him aflame with a passion he hadn't known he possessed.",
      "If Merlin had wanted him, coveted him from their first meeting, then it was in that moment he had fallen in love, and now his body burns with anguish at the knowledge they will have to separate, perhaps never see one another again.",
      "\"What if you could?\"",
      "Arthur's eyes are saying please, and Merlin wants to beg him not to do this to him, that this is hard enough without false hope.",
      "\"I can't,\" Merlin repeats.",
      "\"My mother needs me--the land needs me, Arthur.",
      "The world is dying.\"",
      "\"But what if there was a way?\" Arthur asks, as Merlin's eyes drop from Arthur's to his cupped hands.",
      "\"A loophole, so you didn't have to go?\"",
      "The prince holds an open pomegranate, its seeds as bright and bloody as the red Arthur wears, and it strikes Merlin that he is hungry; he does not remember having eaten since he arrived here and he does not know how many moons ago that was.",
      "He also does not remember feeling hunger in that time.",
      "Merlin sucks in a breath.",
      "He knows exactly what Arthur is offering him, what will happen if he eats the seeds his mouth waters for: an eternity in the dark, cold Underworld, where he will never see dawn or dusk again, where he will never feel the grass beneath his feet and the wind against his skin and the sun on his back, where his mother will never roam.",
      "But he knows what else the pomegranate means, for his mother--more than the simple harvest goddess they mistake her for--has taught him all she knows; it is the only fruit that will grow here, in this dead world, and it is the fruit of their queen.",
      "It means an eternity with his prince, his love, his erastes; it means they will be joined forever, one whole in two halves.",
      "\"Not all of them,\" Merlin says.",
      "Arthur's mask cracks: a hopeful smile falters before it can even truly begin and his brow furrows briefly; Merlin wonders if they are not already whole, if he can read Arthur with such ease.",
      "\"How many?\"",
      "His prince eyes him warily, as if he suspects Merlin is planning to walk out and never return; Merlin wants to eat the entire pomegranate, press his smeared lips to Arthur's cheeks and nose and mouth and promise he'll never leave.",
      "\"Six,\" Merlin answers.",
      "\"Half the year down here,\" Arthur says, \"and half the year up there.\"",
      "\"Half the year with you,\" Merlin corrects, \"and half with my mother.",
      "I can't leave her, Arthur.",
      "She needs me.\"",
      "Arthur smiles softly and he brings one hand to cup Merlin's face; the unspoken as I need you hangs between them, but Arthur is already pushing a pomegranate seed between Merlin's lips.",
      "He feeds them to him, one-by-one, and Merlin breaks the flesh of each one as they pass between his teeth, the sweet and sharp taste coating his tongue as he swallows.",
      "He has eaten the fifth when Arthur kisses him, possessive, and feeds the sixth and last seed into his mouth, while a fire starts at the base of Merlin's spine and in the pit of his stomach.",
      "He has barely swallowed the seed when he returns the kiss with a passion, with the same fire that fills his body; he wants Arthur to take him again, to mark him with teeth and nails and love, so he may leave the Underworld with some trace of his lover still on him.",
      "But there is not enough time; the psychopomp, their messenger god, waits on the banks with the ferryman to return Merlin to his mother, before Hunith kills the world in her despair that she has sent her son into hiding only for him to never return.",
      "\"I want--\" Merlin starts when they part, chasing Arthur's mouth, but Arthur grips him by the shoulders and holds him at arm's length.",
      "\"So do I,\" Arthur says, and Merlin notices how flushed his cheeks look, how swollen his lips are.",
      "\"But if you don't go now, I don't think I can let you leave.\"",
      "Merlin's pulse races and it only makes him want Arthur more, but he nods his understanding and Arthur gathers him into an embrace, wraps his arms around Merlin's waist and holds him tightly.",
      "Merlin burrows his face in Arthur's neck and breathes him in, tries to hold onto the scent of him.",
      "\"When you come back, eromenos,\" Arthur promises, his voice a pleasant rumble against Merlin's ear.",
      "\"We'll have time for that... and other things too.\"",
      "Merlin's heart aches with what he knows now to be love and he presses frantic kisses to Arthur's cheek between a litany of, I love you, I love you, I love you, whispered into his ear.",
      "\"Come back to me,\" Arthur says when they part, and Merlin hears I love you and I need you and don't leave me.",
      "\"I'll come back,\" Merlin says, smiling.",
      "\"I have to, now.",
      "But I have one request.\"",
      "\"Anything.\"",
      "It comes out more breathlessly than he thinks Arthur intends and that knowledge alone is more precious than any gift Arthur could bestow upon him.",
      "\"Don't forget about me in the meantime.\"",
      "For the first time since they have met, Arthur throws his head back in genuine laughter, body shaking with mirth.",
      "\"Merlin,\" he says, his smile wide as he presses one last kiss to Merlin's knuckles, \"I don't think I could forget about you if I drank from the river Lethe itself.\""

    "text": "THE JUDGMENT OF PARISBy Phoebe Roberts Movie magnate Paris Sheppard reclined in his wingback as he regarded the woman that sat across the desk from him. She was beautiful in a way that only stars of her caliber ever were, a way beyond the scope of mere mortal women. Waves of rippling golden hair tumbled in a lustrous fall to her waist. The eyes that regarded him were as bright and brilliantly blue as the sky on a clear spring day. The lovely, delicate, perfect features likened to those of a goddess, supremely confident, effortlessly beautiful. She was Venus Cythera, one of the most famous actresses in the pantheon of Hollywood. He knew immediately without having to ask why she had come. Paris was a busy man, but for Venus he was willing to make time. Paris Sheppard, executive producer for the Iliad Films Production Company, had been hard at work on a project for quite some time. The idea had been pitched to him by a colleague of his by the name of Eris. He'd known Eris for a long time, from the very beginning of her career in the filmmaking business. Back then, she'd been trying to make it in the acting world, though Paris saw even then that she wasn't cut out for it. For years Eris had tried to establish herself in Hollywood, but the town demanded more than what she had. She was simply not beautiful enough, not talented enough, and not well-connected enough to make up for either-- the sort that was never invited to the right parties. As an actress, as a star, she did not make it, and never could have. In the wake of her defeat she instead turned to producing, where she'd shown her true skill. She had risen in the industry so that she was now as wealthy and powerful as any actress, but still she resented that she could never measure up among them. Even now, so long after having become one of the most successful in the business, the old bitterness remained. Paris had leaned back in his leather wingback chair behind his dark mahogany desk as he listened to her speak. She wove a spell with her words of an idea that had the potential to cause the greatest furor there had ever been in the entertainment world. She called her proposed film The Golden Apple. There were channels in this town through which word spread lightning-quick. The moment, it seemed, that Iliad Films signed on to the project, there rose a riotous uproar. This was an industry in which rumors were the lifeblood, and Eris used this to her full advantage. She spread tales of her project cleverly, and soon everyone in the business was aflutter with speculation, especially as to the cast. The part of the lead called for an actress, but rumor had it that not just any would suffice. No, this role was only for the most talented, the most brilliant, the most beautiful, the best that could be found. Eris's film was engraved on every mind as only for the fairest. For a title so lofty as this, the competition was fierce, and the feuds arising were bitter. Actresses were jealous creatures, and there was bad blood between many of them for one reason or another. The contention for this part only served to intensify hostilities already in existence. It infinitely amused Eris to see the exalted actresses, they who had succeeded where she failed, fighting one another like children over a sweet. Had she known when she pitched the idea what a bitter rivalry would spring up from the contest for this role? Paris did not doubt that she had. If he knew Eris at all, he knew she loved nothing more than sowing discord. It seemed to Paris as if every actress ever on the screen had petitioned for the role. They had systematically eliminated the bulk of them, focusing only on the true luminaries, the ones worthy of the picture's prestige. At this stage of the game, the choice was among the very brightest there were. It had all come down to three-- Juno Argos, Minerva Pallas, and Venus Cythera. Some called them the three most brilliant stars in Hollywood, at the pantheon's peak. Juno was most famous for the power of the films she made, Minerva for choosing high-concept, intellectual pieces, and Venus for being the most beautiful part of beautiful movies. Each actress laid claim to this role, and only one would have it. As to which of them, the decision had been left to Paris's judgment. Either Juno, Minerva, or Venus. It was this third, Venus, that now sat on the other side of Paris's desk. It was no insignificant thing that she had chosen to meet with him personally. She could have sent her agent to him, but she hadn't. She had come herself. He rose to receive her as she entered his office, clasping her fair hands in welcome. She greeted him cordially, her manners perfect, her winsome blue eyes luminous. She favored him with a wide and dazzling smile. \"It's good to see you again, Mr. Sheppard.\" Businesslike, Paris cut through the pleasantries to the heart of the matter. \"And you, Miss Cythera. What can I do for you?\" \"I'd like to speak to you about The Golden Apple,\" she answered, as if he didn't already know, as if there could be any other reason. \"You must know that I'm deeply interested in taking part in this.\" \"We're very aware, and pleased to know you'd like to be involved,\" Paris said graciously, waiting for her to continue. \"I'm sure we can come to an arrangement that would suit both of us. I'm willing to offer you something in return for your selection.\" At that, Paris had to mask an expression of contempt. Did she think she was the first to try bartering with him for the part? That her rivals Juno and Minerva hadn't done the very same thing? She had to know such a strategy hardly placed her ahead of the competition. \"I've heard the same from other hopefuls,\" he said blandly, the understatement made clear by his tone, and was surprised to see not the slightest change in her demeanor. Quite the contrary, in fact; her confidence was almost a tangible force around her, all-encompassing and impenetrable. \"Perhaps,\" she conceded, daintily crossing her legs. In truth, she appeared as if she'd heard precisely what she expected. \"But I can do something for you that they can't.\" A measure of Paris's skepticism returned. Certainly Venus was a woman of great means, but to what could she have access that was unavailable to Juno and Minerva, who were stars just as much as she? He rested his chin on his fist. \"And what would that be, Miss Cythera?\" She smiled, and a touch of slyness crept into the expression of those brilliant blue eyes. \"I can get you Helen.\" Paris stifled a gasp of surprise. No mention of a last name was necessary. There was only one person she could mean. Helen Troy, the up-and-coming young starlet on a meteoric rise to fame. Her celebrity, her talent, and her beauty from such a young age were the talk of the country, and there couldn't be a soul alive that didn't know her face. Greek Life Magazine named her the Most Beautiful Woman in the World. She was scarcely twenty years old, and already one of the most sought-after actresses in Hollywood. Every source agreed that Miss Troy was certainly the starlet to watch. At the moment, Paris had particular reason to watch her. There had been a film in the works recently at Iliad, which Paris was producing; A Thousand Ships, it was called, and it had every indication of incredible success. If Paris knew movies-- and certainly he did --this one promised to be a blockbuster. Everything was in order to commence. The script was edited to perfection, the budget was secure, and they had Achilles lined up to direct. All they yet needed was a lead, a young, crowd-pleasing female lead. For this project they had none of the casting difficulty they were experiencing with The Golden Apple; the studio wanted no one but Helen for this lead, and would not proceed until they got her. But try as Paris might, it seemed that Helen refused to be gotten. She wouldn't consider his proposals, didn't even answer his calls. She had already entered into a contract with Lacedaemon Studios, Iliad's rival, and though Paris didn't know what they were, he knew Lacedeamon CEO Menelaus had big plans for the young star in such high demand. There was no way Menelaus would allow anyone else to get their hands on her. So the movie remained in preproduction limbo, and it made Paris furious. The producer had a sensation on his hands, he knew it, and he would never be able to go through with it if he couldn't get a hold of Helen. The higher-ups at Iliad Films simply refused to launch the project without her. If Paris ever allowed himself to give outward sign of his distress, people might have said he was growing desperate. But Paris was not a man accustomed to desperation. In the case of The Golden Apple, he had strictly maintained his position of power in all negotiations. He wanted to see what each of the actresses would offer the studio in return for their casting her. He had planned to play them against each other, driving each of them higher until he made the most advantageous deal possible. He would not have even considered one above the others before finding out exactly what he stood to gain. But at Venus's words, however, he tossed that strategy to the winds. \"I can get you Helen.\" With practiced aplomb, Paris kept his reaction hidden. He affected an air of unconcern, but inwardly he was more than intrigued. The only apparent sign of his interest was the way he leaned forward slightly in his wingback chair. He brought up his concerns rather than accept right off, hardly daring to hope. \"She hasn't shown any interest in working with us before.\" Venus's assurance did not waver in the slightest. \"She will once I speak with her.\" Paris thought of her commitment to Menelaus. \"She's promised to Lacedaemon Studios.\" She dismissed this unconcernedly with a wave of her hand. \"That doesn't matter. I can get her out of it.\" He regarded her, still with a touch of wariness in his gaze. \"How?\" The woman smiled, a lovely, mysterious little smile. \"Leave that part to me, Mr. Sheppard.\" Paris leaned back in his chair again, lacing his fingers together as he considered. It seemed too good to be true. She could be putting him on, telling him what he wished to hear in order to secure the part-- but nothing in her manner struck him as duplicitous. She gave all indication of perfect sincerity. And if she did speak the truth... why, the situation would be ideal! He'd have perfect reason for the studio to choose their leading lady. They could finally begin filming on The Golden Apple. And they would be able to move forward with their other project as well. The higher-ups would need only to see Helen's face, and they would finally launch A Thousand Ships. All his stumbling blocks would be gone at a shot. The possibility of repercussions occurred to him, but those he considered half a moment and dismissed. To secure Helen Troy by any means was worth it, whatever the consequences. And all he would have to do was give Venus what she wanted. He glanced back at her. Tilting her head so that a ripple ran through her golden curls, she extended one delicate, long-fingered hand to him. \"Do we have an agreement?\" Paris reached out and clasped it in a handshake to seal the deal. \"Venus,\" he smirked. \"The Golden Apple is yours.\"",

    "text": "It's hard being right all the time, Athena thought. She knew perfectly well that if Olympus ran the way it really should, Zeus would be the one standing around and expected to look pretty for the sculptors while she would be in charge. But no, the Fates decided the whole world should be run by a guy who had the worst case of teenage hormones ever seen in an immortal being, plus a temper than flared up over the stupidest things: the wrong color heifer in a hecatomb, for example. Meanwhile, here sat Athena, the goddess of wisdom, knitting by the fire because she was patroness of the domestic arts. Ares had walked by half an hour ago, snickering at the poncho she was making. Well, let that idiot snicker, she thought. They might be the dual patrons of warfare, but it was obvious which one of them was the tactician. Ares was just good at waving a sword around. She was the one who meted out justice with a flashing grey eye. Anyway, she didn't see what was so funny about knitting. It was an important, highly creative skill. Besides, Olympus got chilly in the evenings, and togas didn't do much to keep a goddess warm. \"What ya doin', Thena?\" asked a familiar voice before someone plopped down next to her on the marble bench. \"Splitting the atom,\" she replied sarcastically. \"Ha, ha,\" Artemis replied dryly. Athena couldn't help but smile. If she had to have someone intrude on her solitude tonight, she'd rather it be Artemis than anyone else. At least she had half a brain. \"So what have you been up to today?\" Athena asked, laying aside her knitting for the moment. \"Chasing a boar in Sicily,\" Artemis said, popping a grape in her mouth from a great bunch she was carrying. Athena spared a moment to wonder why all of the gods and goddesses seemed to forever be carrying around grapes. \"Catch it?\" Athena asked. \"Yeah,\" Artemis said, \"but I let it go. She was pregnant.\" \"That was thoughtful of you,\" Athena said. \"It gets kind of confusing when the different things I'm supposed to be goddess of conflict,\" Artemis said, shrugging. \"Goddess of the hunt and protectress of newborn animals? Now there's a job description that'll bite you in the ass on occasion.\" \"I know what you mean,\" Athena agreed. \"Goddess of war and goddess of wisdom, plus a side order of protectress of Athens and the inventor of domestic arts is a little much. It's a pretty full plate.\" \"Yeah. Want a grape?\" Artemis asked. \"No thanks. I had ambrosia an hour ago and I'm stuffed,\" she said. \"Anything else interesting happen of late?\" \"Not really. Apollo still hasn't found out yet about me and Endymion, so that's good,\" she said. \"You know he's going to eventually, right?\" Athena told her seriously. \"I mean, he's the sun god. He sees things.\" \"I know,\" Artemis agreed. \"It's just I know he's going to be a pain about it. He sleeps with anything that moves, but I have one male lover and poof! Suddenly, I'm some kind of floozy or something.\" \"Well, you are the virgin goddess,\" Athena said with a shrug. \"It's not really kosher your having a lover, is it?\" \"Tell that to Hera! Every single year she takes a bath in Lake Kanatos and suddenly she's a virgin again. Now how does that work?\" \"She's Hera. It's a thing,\" Athena said, shaking out her poncho. \"So, what do you think of it?\" \"I think the pompoms are a bit much,\" Artemis said, grimacing. \"Maybe you're right,\" Athena said with a sigh. \"I probably shouldn't have tried the dip-dyed yarn.\" Artemis gave a noncommittal grimace and ate another grape. \"Oh! Hey!\" she said suddenly, and the grape wound up in the fire. \"Have you heard about what happened with Hestia?\" Athena nodded sadly. \"Replaced by Dionysius. It's sad, isn't it.\" \"I didn't even know that could happen,\" Artemis said, shaking her head. \"I mean, really, she's nice and all, but to volunteer to step down as one of the twelve Olympians so that Dionysius could take a spot? Maybe that's a little too nice.\" \"Actually, I was the one who asked her to do it,\" Athena said guiltily. \"I knew if she didn't there'd wind up being a war. She was the only one who'd ever consent to give up power without a major struggle, so I reasoned with her and won her over.\" \"Wisdom over warfare, huh?\" Artemis said. \"Still seems a shame, though.\" \"It is. So far all he's done is get roaring drunk and chase nymphs around the temples. I mean, really, wine is good and all, but do we need a god specifically for wine and nothing else?\" \"It does seem kind of a waste,\" Artemis said. \"I'll be sure to stop by Hestia's place later, maybe bring her a gift or something.\" \"Like what?\" Athena asked, truly puzzled what to give a goddess who didn't really go anywhere except her hearth. \"I don't know. Firewood?\" Artemis said. \"Kindling?\" \"She'd probably like that,\" Athena agreed. \"I still kind of wish I'd been able to get rid of Miss High and Mighty Aphrodite instead. At least Hestia never caused wars just because she was bored.\" \"I feel sorry for Hephaestos,\" Artemis clucked sympathetically. \"Do you think he has any idea how many times she's put horns on his head?\" \"Probably,\" Athena said. \"Why do you think he lives most of the time in a volcano instead of up here? She's a little too much for anyone after a while. I mean, really, who needs to have a shower of rose petals announce her entrance into every single room? And the doves, and the honeybees, and that Eros fluttering around all the time. It's enough to drive a person to distraction!\" \"She is a bit much,\" Artemis agreed, \"though if anyone ever asks, I didn't say that.\" \"Ditto,\" Athena agreed. After all, Aphrodite might be a diva-hearted drama queen, but she was also the most lethal and ruthless of all the Olympians if she got angry, and that was saying something. \"What on Olympus is that?\" boomed a voice behind them. Athena turned around to see her father Zeus pointing at the poncho. \"It's something to help keep me warm,\" Athena replied respectfully. Zeus laughed loudly, then patted her head as if she were a small child making mud pies in the garden. \"Daughter, you do think the silliest things! But then women's business is their own affair, I suppose, and as it's not so important as men's, it's not to be taken quite so seriously,\" he said, hoisting a thunderbolt on his shoulder. \"Well, I'm off. There's a certain cow I need to deal with before my dear wife blasts her into a pile of meatballs.\" As he left, Artemis and Athena exchanged looks. \"Poor Io,\" Athena said, shaking her head. \"He just never learns, does he.\" \"Nope,\" Artemis said, \"when you get down to it, none of us do, do we?\" \"I suppose not,\" Athena said with a sigh. \"Hand me that skein of yarn, will you? I could do with a new pair of mittens.\"",

    "text": "Elemental Differences; AtLA, Zuko/Katara (kinda, sort implied); 100 words exactly Zuko never particularly liked water. It was antagonistic to his own element, but where fire could be controlled and directed toward something, water flowed freely; it was too unwieldy; too unpredictable. Some said fire was unpredictable but not in the way water was; water could either kill you or save you, with fire you knew which one you got; even a small amount could burn you (as Zuko could attest to it). Too much water and you could get burned too, yet in an entirely different way. It was an act of balance and how one wielded their own element. Untitled Drabble #1; Greek Mythology, Eros/Psych, Aphrodite; 106 words They called a semi-truce. Had to really. She had done all that Aphrodite had asked of her; she had proved her love, gone to hell and back, literally. That didn't mean Aphrodite had to like it - or welcome Psyche into her family just because she had seemed to be outnumbered. Eros had hope - maybe futilely - that his mother would welcome his wife. He wasn't foolish. Psyche hadn't exactly endeared herself to Aphrodite from the get-go. It would take some time, of that Eros was sure. He was sure, though, that once Aphrodite saw Psyche's faithfulness from then on, she'd have no reason to dislike the girl. The One They Call Bayou Bob; The Vampire Diaries, Stefan, Damon; 239 words; post 2x08: Rose Stefan finds him in the boat behind the shed. Why there is a boat in the shed in the first place does not bear thinking about at this juncture but the point is Stefan finds his brother lying down in it, arms crossed over his chest. In a weird way Damon looks serene, peaceful this way. As though there isn't 145 years of history between them, as though they are normal boys once again. Stefan would be lying if he said he didn't wish he could go back to 1864, back before Katherine Pierce entered their lives and screwed them up, back before they even knew vampires existed, back to a time when they were just two brothers. \"I can hear you thinking from all the way there - stop it.\" Stefan comes closer, hands in his pockets, wanting to ask his brother why he's in a boat, wanting to ask his brother a lot of things actually, but as Damon has alluded to earlier, he isn't one for bonding. That search for the bond they lost is 145 years too late. \"I'm not thinking,\" Stefan says just for the sake of talking but Damon will see through the lie. There is no one who knows Stefan better than Damon, not even Elena. Which is why he's determined to not let Damon's love for Elena stand between them - again. They've been through that once already. And he's tired of it. Untitled Drabble #2; The Vampire Diaries, Jeremy, Tyler; 337 words; season two spoilers Jeremy awkwardly found Tyler at school bright and early and jabbing furiously at the buttons on his cell phone. Jeremy, sort of finding it nice that he and Tyler now at least tolerated each other, found it hard to walk on by and not inquire at least if Tyler was okay. Because he didn't seem like he was okay. \"Just trying to get in touch with my uncle; he totally disappeared without even saying goodbye. I mean what's up with that?\" Tyler closed his phone, looking at it like if only he had it out, it'd ring. Jeremy felt a sharp, uncomfortable pang. Oh yeah, Uncle Mason, the werewolf who had his heart ripped out by Damon - like literally. Of course Jeremy couldn't say that to Tyler. First off, he'd have to out the Salvatore brothers as being monsters too, and while he thought Tyler would have no trouble believing him, he kind of gathered that the less people that knew about Damon and Stefan the better. And secondly, there was that legend about werewolves and vampires being enemies. Jeremy didn't want it to come to that - that is Tyler finding out about it and Damon having to kill him like he killed his uncle. If there was one thing Jeremy found out from being around Damon was there was no such thing as being too careful around the guy. And as true as the fact that he and Tyler weren't friends was, they were still acquaintances at best, and Jeremy wouldn't wish Damon coming after even his worst enemy. Jeremy did want to tell Tyler everything. Especially about his uncle. But on the other hand, did he really want to be the one to tell someone he once considered his enemy that his uncle died while being tortured by a vampire and then getting his heart ripped out of his chest by said vampire? He had no idea how Tyler would even react - if he'd believe him at all. There were some things better left unsaid. Untitled Drabble #3; The Vampire Diaries, Damon, 130 words of Damon brooding It wasn't fair. He wanted Katherine; she had wanted Stefan; he didn't know if Stefan had wanted her back then. If Stefan was as infatuated with her as he was, probably. Now, it's basically history repeating itself: he wanted Elena; Elena wanted Stefan; Stefan wanted Elena (Katherine still wanted Stefan). Nowhere in the equation did anybody want Damon - which just pissed him off. He didn't really mean to fall in love with the same girls Stefan fell in love with; it just kind of...happened. And anyways, it didn't matter all too much in the end, did it? They all chose Stefan in the end, with Damon left out in the cold, contemplating the lonely existence of a man who would do everything for love but was never given a chance. Untitled Drabble #4; DCU, Jason Todd; 184 words It rains on Halloween, and Jason is kinda sad about that. The kids in Gotham should have a nice night for trick-or-treating, but Jason can't control the weather - like a lot of things he can't control. But the one thing he can control - how safe Gotham is. And he might not be...Robin, anymore, but he can still rid Gotham of its vilest inhabitants. And this time he won't be controlled by boundaries and one man's imaginary ethical lines. This time - he will do things his way. It's oddly liberating, to know he can free himself from his old life - if he wants to. He doesn't want to spend it being bitter - that's gotten him nowhere. The neon sign of the nightclub and streetlamps blink like beacons against the darkness, and right then and there, Jason Todd decides to become the Red Hood. It's what he's meant to do, it's what feels right. Jason takes out the pack of cigarettes and lights one. He leans against the store, and watches the rain fall. There's no one to tell him no. Stephanie Brown - Ninja decorator; DCU, Stephanie Brown, Alfred Pennyworth, Bruce Wayne; 204 words Bruce did not like surprises. Surprises meant that he wasn't on his guard - that something managed to slip past his notice. That wasn't the mark of a good detective. A good detective was always on his toes. One step ahead of his enemy. In other words, surprises meant that someone could get the best of Bruce Wayne. And, today, someone had. He stood in the driveway of his manor, and tried to figure out what the heck was going on. \"Alfred?\" His trusty butler since his schooldays came out of the garage and looked at him expectantly. \"Yes, Master Bruce?\" \"Can I ask you a question?\" \"Certainly, Sir.\" \"Why are all the trees covered in little purple bat lights?\" Alfred's head tilted a bit to one side, as though he was thinking of the best way to phrase this. \"Miss Stephanie thought it fun to decorate the manor for trick-or-treaters...and I agreed.\" He should've known. Really. The color should've tipped him off from the start. But he was tired and had been on patrol the night before and he doesn't remember when he slept last. Yeah. Right. Like that helped matters any.... He wondered if Stephanie had any blacklight bats. Crisis in Faith; The Vampire Diaries, Rebekah; 190 words; I don't believe you, you got the whole damn thing all wrong. He's not the kind. ~Jethro Tull; 3x08 \"Ordinary People\" coda Elena left awkwardly, Rebekah kneeling on the floor of the Salvatores' living room, sobbing for a thousand years having gone by and her not knowing the truth. But...was it really the truth? Did Elena have any reason to lie? Yes, yes Elena wanted her brother dead and would've said anything to turn her against her brother. She could've made the whole thing up...that would've been easier to believe had there not been photographic evidence painted on the cave walls. Did their father know? Was that why he was really hunting them? To get revenge for the bastard son that killed his wife? She and Elijah had promised always and forever. And it was a promise she willingly gave to her brother because she hadn't wanted her family to turn their back against one of their own. It was a promise she willingly made because she hadn't known the truth. She hadn't known that the person she was pledging her loyalty to right there on her mother's grave was the person who had murdered her. She had loved her mother. She loved her brother too. Where did that leave her now? That one time Oliver Queen was jealous of Bruce Wayne; Smallville/DCU, Oliver, Chloe, Bruce; 705 words Oliver Queen was feeling pretty proud. He was a newlywed with an unbelievably gorgeous, intelligent, kind woman. His company was thriving, even after being outed as a superhero. Everything was going pretty much awesomely for him. He couldn't complain. The newlywed party that Tess decided to throw them was a nice touch too. He was hanging back at the bar, letting his wife (he would never get tired of thinking of her as his wife) mingle and chat up people, he was totally fine with hanging back and admiring her. He actually did have a couple people he wanted to introduce her to, but they didn't seem to have arrived yet. When he finally did see the dark-haired older man enter the ballroom, he went over to Chloe and pointed the people out, leading her in their direction. \"Bruce, I want to introduce you to...\" \"Chloe!\" Bruce cut off Oliver, and beamed at Chloe in an absolutely genial way. Ollie stood there dumbfounded. The hottest bachelor in Gotham City (Ollie was totally the hottest in Star City, but he wasn't a bachelor anymore so naturally his attractiveness would not count, but his hottest did) knew his wife? And was on first-name basis with her? What the hell was going on? \"Bruce, how are you?\" Chloe kissed him on the cheek, and Bruce returned a peck. Oliver tried to grin beside the two of them, but it was more of a grimace/strained-smile-I-can't-shoot-an-arrow-through-his-heart-in-public kind of thing. \"You two know each other? How do you two know each other?\" Ollie's voice was sounding weird to him. \"Oh, we go way back.\" Bruce winked at her, not letting go of her hand. Chloe and Bruce laughed a little at that, like it was an inside joke just between the two of them and Ollie was surprised that he had to keep himself in check. Was he feeling...jealousy? Is that what this weird, snarling, panic-stricken feeling in his stomach was? \"Well, I see my date waving me over. Thanks so much for inviting me.\" Bruce nodded to them and went on his way. \"How in the hell do you know Bruce Wayne?\" He started for the bar again, this time thinking that he needed something strong to try to smother this new feeling. He had never felt jealous before. Of anything! It was such a ludicrous thing for him to even feel. What could he possibly be jealous of? \"It's a long story.\" \"Well, we have all night, why don't you start?\" Chloe made a weird face. \"Ollie, I'd rather not get into it right now. It's our party and we should be having fun.\" Because he did not want to argue with his unbelievably gorgeous, intelligent, kind wife, he put on the best actor-smile he could muster. \"You are totally right. Waiter, gin please.\" \"Ollie...\" \"No, it's okay. If you don't want to tell me about you and your new friend, that's totally fine.\" He stumbled into the bar stool a bit unsteadily. \"Ollie, trust me, it's not what you think.\" \"It's not? Really?\" \"You know that time when I put on the Fate helmet and saw the future, and had to disappear off the face of the planet, and found myself working with the Suicide Squad? You remember that time?\" \"Oh that-time-that-we-don't-name-or-ever-talk-about? Yes I do.\" \"Well, Bruce Wayne was just one of the many faces I met along the way.\" \"You sure that's all there is to it? I mean, Bruce Wayne is...well, he could be one hell of a catch, I guess, if you went for the gorgeous, smart billionaire type...\" \"Oliver Jonas Queen, what are you getting at?\" \"Nothing, I'm, uh, not getting at anything at all, just that well, if one wanted to, one could see similarities between Mr. Wayne and myself, if someone were looking for them, hypothetically speaking.\" \"Yeah, well, being gorgeous, smart billionaire types is not all that you two have in common.\" Chloe grinned cheekily and started walking away. \"Wait, Chloe...what did you mean by that? Chloe?\" But Chloe didn't answer him. He'd figure it out. Maybe. And if he didn't...well, they had their whole lives for Chloe to fill him in on all the similarities between him and Bruce Wayne.",

    "text": "Kang Ta was one of the most beautiful men anyone had ever seen, maybe even the most beautiful man of all. This was his burden though, because no one dared think they were worthy of him, and he was very alone. His friends, Jae Won, Woo Hyuk, and Tony were lovely men themselves, but no where near Kang Ta's beauty, and they had committed relationships that Kang Ta envied. Still, he did not hold any hard feelings toward those friends he loved, and they looked out for him the best they could. Even though Kang Ta was utterly alone, Jun Jin felt jealous for him. He thought of himself as the most beautiful man not only in Korea, but in the world. How could everyone speak so highly of this lesser creature while he was around?! Jun Jin set his mind to ridding the world of Kang Ta's Goddess like beauty, and had his good friend Eric kidnap him, and tie him to train tracks. Eric was to make sure the train had finished the job, but there was a delay and Eric couldn't stay, so Jun Jin sent his dedicated lover, Hee Jun, to see the murder through and report back when it was over. Kang Ta laid on the tracks, immobile, crying and cursing Jun Jin. He cried long after Eric had left, and into an exhausted sleep. While he was sleeping, Hee Jun arrived, and as his eyes fell over Kang Ta, he was in love. How could he kill such a magnificent creature? How could he kill the man he knew now he was in love with? Hee Jun took Kang Ta to his home, untied him, and ordered those who worked for him to look after him, and never to tell him who owned this place. And so it was, and each night in the pitch black, Hee Jun would join his love in bed, refusing to revile himself, and they made love. Kang Ta was overwhelmed with gratitude for his rescue and royal treatment but died to see his lovers face. It didn't matter to him who he was, because he had fallen in love with the being who held him each night, who was the only person he had ever known intimately, but he wanted to know the face in which kissed him every night. He wanted to commit to memory that figure's details so he could imagine him with him even during the day. But Hee Jun refused. After not too long, Kang Ta asked his lover if he could see his friends, for he didn't know where he was and couldn't go to meet them. Hee Jun agreed but reminded him, he couldn't see his face, so not to let Kang Ta's friends convince him of trickery. Kang Ta promised him he wouldn't betray his love, and Hee Jun had his friends brought to their home the next day. Jae Won, Woo Hyuk, and Tony eagerly came and were astonished by the wealth in which Kang Ta was now living, and upon hearing of his lover, were beside themselves. Inevitably, jealously and contention grew and they no longer had Kang Ta's best interests at heart... \"What if he is some...ugly burn victim?\" Tony asked. \"I don't care, I love him, it doesn't matter what he looks like. Besides, I have felt every inch of his body and there are no imperfections.\" Woo Hyuk snorted. \"You think that's all that he should worry about?\" He asked Tony while giving him a sideways glance. \"You said this guy saved your life and is keeping you in this mansion, and you haven't ever SEEN him? Ya, he's a crazy nut.\" Kang Ta swallowed hard. Could they be right? He had never questioned his lover...he couldn't fathom this wonderful man was any sort of bad seed! Or had love blinded him? \"Lets google the most wanted list, and you can find some way to see this guys face tonight. If he doesn't look like any of the criminals, alright, but if so...\" Jae Won's voice trailed off. \"There are no lights in the bedroom, even the windows are shuttered so no moon light can come in...How can I find a way to see his face?\" Kang Ta asked. Tony reached into his messenger bag and pulled a flash light out, grinning. \"Use this.\" \"Why do you carry a flashlight?\" Woo Hyuk asked. \"I got it at a Take Back The Night rally at the women's shelter.\"That night Kang Ta waited in his bed for his lover, the photos of all the criminals running through his mind... He didn't believe his lover's face could match any of those, but his beloved friends had put too much logic into their argument... Soon he felt the familiar body slip into bed next to his, and Kang Ta let the worries that had been plaguing him slip away as they made love. When Kang Ta felt his lover fall into a deep sleep he carefully got into the night stand and held Tony's flashlight above the other man's head. And he turned it on. No, this wasn't one of those criminals. This was the man he was in love with. He was who Kang Ta had pictured for longer then they had ever been together. His kind soft face, his creamy skin, and his beautiful red mouth. Kang Ta was so taken the flashlight slipped from his grasp and fell into the sleeping figure's temple, waking him immediately. \"You...You promised!\" Hee Jun cried, after the painful scream subsided. \"I trusted you!\" Before Kang Ta could plead for forgiveness or convince him to over look this, his lover had taken off. Kang Ta tried to chase after him but was tangled in blankets and he was too late. But Kang Ta wasn't going to give up on the only love he had ever known, he would find him, and it wouldn't be hard...He knew who he was. He was Moon Hee Jun. Jun Jin's lover. Hee Jun ran from Kang Ta, knowing that now that he had been seen, their relationship was over. He wasn't worthy of someone such as Kang Ta, and he was already Jun Jin's. No one would accept this relationship, he had no choice but to return to Jun Jin and try to cover his tracks... He told Jun Jin Kang Ta had indeed died. The reason he had been gone so long was that the body had made a mess and it needed to be cleaned lest anyone track the murder to Jun Jin. The train was powerful, he said, so much so it took weeks to search through the flora and fauna collecting fingers, teeth, organs, anything that could leave a trace of DNA. Jun Jin had trusted and was thankful to his lover, until Kang Ta had come requesting a visitation with him. Jun Jin met with Kang Ta, who fell to his knees in tears immediately. \"Please, I know you don't like me, but please show me some mercy. I've never done anything to you, and I've fallen in love with Hee Jun. I didn't know who he was when we were together, so please forgive me for the adultery! But I can't live without him now, please let me speak with him, I beg you.\" Jun Jin was in no way willing to let this pathetic creature have his lover, but he also wasn't going to kill someone with his own hands...so he offered a challenge, if Kang Ta could pass three tests, he could have Hee Jun. Kang Ta agreed without hearing the conditions. \"Alright, for your first test...\" Jun Jin presented him with a box of CDs. \"This is the complete discography of every artist who has ever been in SM Town. I want you to make a list of each song, with the song title and artist of what song it had been plagiarized from.\" It was impossible! All these albums??? And it was likely every single one of these songs were plagiarized! Still, he had to try....So Jun Jin let him loose telling him to return when the task was complete. Kang Ta wandered away from the home in tears. How could he ever accomplish such a task?! \"Why are you crying, sexy?\" Asked a voice, very close to Kang Ta's ear, and he hadn't even seen anyone approach. \"Oh!\" He cried, turning quickly. \"I have to make a list of every song each of these CDs plagiarized....I don't know where to begin!\" \"Oh that's easy, I can get that done for you in a jiffy.\" The man said, pulling a pen out of his coat pocket, clicked it open, and winked. \"My name is HaHa, nice to meet you.\" True to his word, in a matter of minutes the man had made a complete list for him. His knowledge of music was astounding. Kang Ta was over come with joy. Jun Jin was not. Somehow Kang Ta had managed this task...Well, the second one was much harder. Kang Ta was ordered to bring the hair he would need to shave from the DBSG members heads. This didn't seem like such an impossible task, until Kang Ta had snuck into Inki Gayo and looked on at the pre-pubescent band. How was he to shave these kid's heads? He couldn't avoid being caught, and they had long sharp fingernails and teeth, teeth such as those of babies who hadn't yet been able to ware them down from intake of solid foods. Kang Ta sunk to the floor in tears. He had been lucky the first time, but there was no way he could finish this task...He had lost. \"Dude, what's wrong with you?\" Was called from above. Kang Ta looked up to see Neo and P.O of the band Paran looking down at him, not in concern, but confusion. And maybe a good amount of amusement. \"I need to shave the DBSG members' heads...and I don't know how I'll do it...\" The two looked at each other in stark surprise then smiles spread over their faces. \"We would love to help you, in any way we can.\" P.O said. \"Wait here and we'll be back.\" Neo said. They casually walked over to DBSG, and though Kang Ta couldn't hear what was being said, he could clearly see the devilish smiles on the Paran member's faces, and the apprehension on the lesser band's faces. Suddenly the two forcefully ushered DBSG into an empty room and not too long after, they came out, alone, and returned to Kang Ta. \"Here is the hair you wanted.\" P.O said dropping the bundle into Kang Ta's arms. \"And the teeth.\" Neo said, holding out his hands full of small baby like teeth. \"I didn't ask for their teeth...\" \"Oh, well then, do you mind if I keep them then?\" Kang Ta agreed to let him keep it, and returned to Jun Jin with his bounty. He was in high spirits now. Only one task left to go and he could be with his lover again! \"I don't know how the fuck you keep pulling this shit off...\" Jun Jin said through clenched teeth. \"Your last task, you will go into BoA's home and bring me the chest she keeps at the foot of her bed.\" If the other tasks were impossible, this one wasn't even fathomable! BoA's home? It was guarded by amazons who considered the numeral 1 to be the true number of the best, opposed to 666, because it was phallus shaped. He had no hopes of getting past them! If he couldn't be with Hee Jun, then he had no future anyway. He wasn't going to go on living without him, and he wasn't going to die by the hands of any beast women. Kang Ta found the tallest roof in all of Seoul and prepared his self to jump. \"Wait! What are you doing?\" Someone demanded, grabbing his arm. \"Im going to kill myself.\" \"Why?\" The other man asked. \"I have to break into BoA's house...but I cant get past her amazon guards. I don't know what else to do.\" The man thought on this and finally sighed. \"Alright, I can help you. BoA and I have...some history, so I know a thing or two around those kinda girls. Here's what you do, take two books with you. Try 'Embracing the Goddess' or 'Sexing The Cherry' throw one at them on the way in, and one on the way out. In case that doesn't work, bring some Melissa Etheridge albums.\" \"Thank you so much! Im sorry, I didn't catch your name?\" \"Brian Joo.\" So Kang Ta went to the house with an assortment of appropriate books and Melissa Etheridge CDs. He was apprehensive as to whether the guards would take the bait, but as soon as he let loose the gifts, they were upon then, mullets waving in the breeze as they darted to collect. Inside, Kang Ta silently made his way to the bedroom. The house was lined in decorative art pieces looking like recreations of works from the Karma Sutra, but no matter how hard Kang Ta looked, he couldn't find male genitalia on any of the figures present. Putting that aside, he did find the bed room and collected the chest. When he returned to the outside, the amazons seemed to be uninterested in the last gifts he had left, so he hurriedly scattered the rest and darted from the property. When he was safely outside Jun Jin's house again, it occurred to him, he had no idea what was kept in the chest. Curiosity got the better of him and he opened the chest to get a glimpse of what was inside. At first it wasn't clear what these round hairy object were...but slowly it dawned on him. They were severed ball sacks with the names of those men they had been removed from written in sharpy on them. Kang Ta lost consciousness. Hee Jun was upstairs where he had been sulking for what seemed like an eternity. He felt like he was dying inside, and might as well have been. There was no life for him if Kang Ta wasn't in it. Suddenly, a movement from outside the window caught his attention, and he saw Kang Ta fall lifeless to the ground. Hee Jun was out the front door before he knew it, and gathered his love into his arms, urging him awake. Slowly, Kang Ta opened his eyes. \"Hee Jun? Is that you?\" \"Are you alright?!\" \"Hee Jun!\" Kang Ta cried and sunk his head into Hee Jun's neck. \"Im so sorry I didn't keep my promise, I would have never if I knew it would take you from me! I want to make it right, I've been trying to!\" And he went on to explain his recent adventures. \"Kang Ta...Im sorry, but we can't be together. Im not worthy enough to be with you.\" Hee Jun admitted. \"Not worthy? Because of my looks? Hee Jun! Im a pathetic moron with no skills or common sense. I have to be babied and coddled or I would end up dead before sun down. You are brave and wonderful, you are the type of person I've always dreamed about, and you are worth even Jun Jin's wrath!\" \"But Jun Jin...I've promised myself to him, I want to be a man of my word.\" \"Jun Jin isn't human, so he isn't worth your word. He wants second hand severed ball sacks for heaven's sake!\" \"It would be third hand at this point.\" Hee Jun corrected. \"It doesn't matter, the only thing that matters is our love!\" Kang Ta kissed him, and Hee Jun knew it was true. Nothing else in the world mattered but each other, and he wouldn't let this love slip away. They ran away together and lived in solitude and bliss for the rest of their lives.",

    "text": "A lovely man floated through the flowers, enjoying their beauty, though they were made to look offensive compared to his own. The park was cleared of any soul who would do wrong by him, having only the company of his father figure, Moon Hee Jun, and his assistant, Lee Jae Won. Soon though, he was wondering further out, all alone.\"Tony is wandering away again.\" Jae Won pointed out.\"Whatever. Come check this thing on my back for me. See if it's a pimple or something.\"Soon Tony was alone, but not at all worried. He took in the sights and sounds of the outside world he got to see so little of. Within minutes of his freedom, a car bounded over a mound and skid to a stop before him. With no time to react, Tony stood helpless as the driver jumped out and threw him into the back of the car, and sped away.When the car finally stopped, Tony spread his fingers to take in what few clues he could to where he was now. Everything was dark, having only a florescent light from above the car to make anything visible.The car door opened on the drivers side, closed, then the one toward his feet opened. The kidnapper stood silently there, cast in ominous shadow.\"Well,\" The figure said finally. \"Aren't you going to scream or something? I thought you passed out, you were quiet for the whole drive.\"\"I didn't want to be a bother.\" Tony admitted.\"Aren't you scared?\"Tony only nodded.\"But calm enough to buckle your seat belt.\"\"Safety first.\"The dark figure leaned into the car and un-clipped Tony's seat belt before pulling him gruffly out of the car. \"My name is Jang Woo Hyuk, welcome to your new home.\"Tony blinked up at him for a moment, then took the initiative to look around at the parking garage he was now standing in.\"My new home is the parking garage at the COEX Mall?\"Woo Hyuk gave him a mocking smile before pulling him along to the elevator. \"Not this specific place. Below it.\"Nothing was said as they took the elevator down below the mall's parking area. The doors opened into the basement to berate both of them with offensive hip hop music. Tony hesitated, but wasn't given the option to linger. Inside the bottom level was a place very much like the one they just left. Cement walls and floor, decorated thickly with graffiti Tony didn't understand. Filled with people instead of cars. They danced, they fought, they moved their hands in intricate ways seemingly to communicate with each other.\"What is this place?!\" Tony cried.\"This is the hip hop underworld. This is my kingdom.\"\"Everyone here is suffering from a racial identity crisis! I want to go home!\"Woo Hyuk looked down at him stoicly. \"You can't. This is where you'll live from now on. Hee Jun helped arrange with me to bring you here, and this is where you'll stay.\"\"What?! Why would you do this?!\"\"Because Im in love with you.\" \"WHAT DO YOU MEAN MY PRECIOUS BABY TONY IS GONE?!\" Kang Ta screamed in horror.\"It was an accident.\" Jae Won said quietly.\"Oh, you know kids, he's probably just playing baseball or...on a raft with Tom Sawyer.\" Hee Jun said from the couch.\"HE HAS ASTHMA AND HE CAN'T SWIM! IF EITHER OF THOSE THINGS HAVE HAPPENED I WILL BE SO PISSED!\"Kang Ta, seeing he would have no aid in the other two men, ran out into the night. He ran and ran until he had no direction in mind and no effort to get him there even if he did. Eventually Kang Ta fell to the ground, unable to move any longer.\"Look! It's a hobo!\" Someone called, followed by foot steps rushing to Kang Ta's side.Someone rolled him over and four men huddled into his line of view.\"Oh my gosh, this ones alive! We have GOT to keep him.\"\"We aren't bringing home another fucking hobo Dong Wan. Get a pet.\"\"Please Minwoo! He's so cute.\"\"All the more reason...\"\"Help me.\" Kang Ta choked. \"Please, Im looking for my baby.\"\"Ah shit, he's coherent.\" One of the figures sighed. \"Hey, Im Eric, this is Dong Wan, Minwoo, and Hye Sung. We'll take you to our home and get you something to eat.\"\"We'll what?\" Hye Sung demanded. \"Why the fuck are we listening to Dong Wan?\"\"Im not!\" Eric insisted. \"Im trying to do the right thing!\"\"Im tired of your fucking karma trip dude! Nothing is going to bring those hookers back to life!\"\"IT WAS AN ACCIDENT! AND AT LEAST IM TRYING TO ATONE FOR MY SINS!\"Without a break in argument, Kang Ta was lifted from the ground by numerous hands and brought without much care into a nearby residence, and then on into a house. He was fed and given a bed by the four and the man who greeted him at the entry way, Jun Jin.Kang Ta still couldn't get himself to rest because of the aching loss in his heart. Soon he found himself wandering aimlessly in the house, looking for a sort of peace. What he found was the sleeping chamber of one man he had yet to meet. The youthful exuberance he exuded even in sleep led Kang Ta to his side. Running his fingers along the contours of the figures face, Kang Ta found something he had lost.Waking with a start, the man began to scream, but Kang Ta silenced him with a firm hand over his mouth. \"Shhh,\" He warned. \"Im not going to hurt you. Im going to make your beautiful.\"\"Really?!\" The young man asked through Kang Ta's hand.Nodding, Kang Ta removed his hand and led him from the bed. Working the well honed craft, Kang Ta beat the young man's face with a thick layer of make up until he complained of bruising. Ignoring the complaints, Kang Ta applied fake eye lashes, silicone bra inserts, and gaff he kept in his bag.As Kang Ta was preparing the gown, the door slammed open and Jun Jin burst in. \"What are you doing in here?\" He demanded of Kang Ta, then saw what had become of the young man. \"What did you do to Andy?!\"\"Im beautiful now.\" Andy said.\"You are a queen! Why aren't you wearing pants?! And what happened to your penis?!\"\"Its in there.\" Kang Ta assured. \"This is called a gaff. I have an extra one if you like.\" He ran his hand along the line of it on Andy's hip.Jun Jin snatched his hand away. \"I let you into my house, take care of you, give you a place to stay and this is how you repay me?! You turn Andy into a women?!\"Kang Ta gasped in outrage, pulling his arm away from Jun Jin to no avail. \"He is NOT a women. He is much better, a transvestite. And he makes a good one doesn't he?\" Kang Ta said in a proud tone, looking over his work. \"One day he might be as good as my baby.\"Pulling him from the bedroom, Jun Jin woke him from his reverie. \"He isn't your baby, he's mine. Your lost yours. Now get the hell out of my house.\"Kang Ta was thrown though the front door that promptly shut behind him.\"You'll be sorry!\" He screamed. \"When you see what he could have become, you'll be sorry! The only way Ill forgive you is if you open a burlesque show in my honor!\"Kang Ta struggled to his feet, and then on back into his own home where he was cautiously greeted by Hee Jun who had yet to leave the couch. Not having the energy to answer, Kang Ta said nothing. He led himself into Tony's room and broke into woeful tears, clutching Tony's wedding dress in his hands.\"Hey...\" Hee Jun said hesitantly, coming into the room. \"You are pretty upset huh?\"Kang Ta only answered him with a sob.\"Well...\" Hee Jun paused, rubbing his jaw thoughtfully. \"What if I were to tell you...I might know where Tony is?\"The sobs broke into silence in a second, and Kang Ta was on his feet, nose to nose with Hee Jun. \"What do you mean?\"\"First of all, this was not my idea at all. Not one bit. Second of all, I arranged for him to be kidnaped.\"\"YOU WHAT?! HOW COULD YOU!\" Kang Ta shrieked.\"You were obsessed with him! We used to do things together, now we never go out. When we go to movies they have to be G rated. You never brush my hair anymore, only his! Im too young for commitment like this! I wasn't ready!\"Kang Ta slowly placed his hands on either side of Hee Jun's face, and then dug his needle like nails into his lover's flesh. \"If you don't take me to my baby right now, I will tear your scrotum to shreds.\"\"I'll have Jae Won get the car.\" Tony pressed himself into Woo Hyuk's body and smiled when strong arms automatically wrapped around him. In his kidnapper he had found someone that truly loved him in a way Hee Jun, Kang Ta, and Jae Won could not. Woo Hyuk loved him deeply and fully, and in that Tony had learned much more about himself, and about what he could really become as a person. The dark and gritty world he was brought to ceased to be scary or alien to him. Tony had found his place in that world, by Woo Hyuk's side.As Tony brought his face up to express his feelings to Woo Hyuk, they were interrupted.\"Woo Hyuk!\"\"What is it Eun Ji Won?\" Woo Hyuk asked him angrily.\"Some nerd just came down here boss. He's trouble for like, for realz yo. In the hizzy.\"Woo Hyuk stepped away from Tony, standing to his full height. \"Bring him in here.\"The intruder was promptly brought before them, and Tony recognized him immediately. \"Jae Won!\"Jae Won sighed, and then waved at the exit. \"Time to go home Tony.\"Before Tony could react, Woo Hyuk moved to block Jae Won's view of him. \"He isn't going anywhere.\"Ignoring Woo Hyuk, Jae Won went on. \"Kang Ta was afraid of getting mugged, but he's upstairs with Hee Jun in the car. Come on, we need to go. If you hurry maybe we can get a Happy Meal on the way home. Would you like that?\"\"How dare you-\" Woo Hyuk was cut off when Tony grabbed his arm.\"Woo Hyuk wait.\" He said softly.\"Wait for what? Im not going to let some asshole come down here and act like he has any say over what happens to you.\"Tony glanced apprehensively at Ji Won and Jae Won before pulling Woo Hyuk closer to whisper, \"I need to go up there and see Kang Ta. I love him, he's brought me up, I can't just forget that.\"Woo Hyuk didn't respond, but grudgingly stepped back. Tony let Jae Won lead him up into the world above, and Woo Hyuk, alone, followed them.\"MY BABY!\" Kang Ta cried, bursting from the car and gathering Tony in his arms. \"Im so sorry, you must have missed me so much! Look at you, your lips are chapped and your roots are showing! Jae Won, call the salon and tell them we'll be there ASAP! Tony, my heart, I'll never let you go again!\"\"Kang Ta!\" Tony choked into Kang Ta's chest, trying to pull himself free. \"I missed you too but...\"Kang Ta jerked him back so quickly Tony's head met his shoulder blades. \"What but? But what? You missed me but what? Oh my God...Did that monster touch you? Are you pregnant?\"Hee Jun turned off the ignition with a sigh and exchanged an exasperated look with Jae Won, preparing to be there for a long while.\"Kang Ta, I missed you a lot, and although the situation isn't ideal...\" Tony glanced slowly over his shoulder at Woo Hyuk. \"I can't go back with you. Im in love with Woo Hyuk\"\"Stockholm syndrome!\" Kang Ta shrieked. \"Jae Won, call a negotiator! An exorcist!\"\"Really, I do love him.\" Tony insisted, pulling from Kang Ta and taking his place by Woo Hyuk's side.\"Wait a minute...what is that?!\" Kang Ta took Tony's arm, spinning him around, and pulled the back of his blouse up. \"IS THAT A TRAMP STAMP?!\" He fell to the ground in tears. \"What happened to my baby...What did you do to my princess?!\"Hee Jun lumbered out of the car and pulled Kang Ta to his feet. \"Tony do you really want to stay here?\"Tony looked from Hee Jun to Woo Hyuk and back. \"I do love Woo Hyuk, and I want to stay here with him, but I love you all too.\"\"You think we could love you now?\" Kang Ta demanded. \"How will you wear low cut backed gowns with those ugly gangster hieroglyphs over the crack of your ass? No, no, I don't mean that...I still love you, we can cover it with foundation and glitter.\"Hee Jun patted his lovers back. \"We can settle this with a prenup. Jae Won get me some paper and a pen.\"Within moments, Hee Jun had scrolled a prenuptial agreement on the inside cover of a Letters From The Earth paper back. Without much undo pressure, Woo Hyuk and Tony signed it.\"There, its settled. Tony will stay with you from fall through winter, and with us from spring through summer. We'll have holidays here on even years, and with us on odds. Birthdays at a neutral location. We also usually have an anniversary party for the day Tony got his circumcision. I don't know if you want to celebrate that with us, but we usually have penis shaped cake and some bread sticks.\"\"No, that sounds fine. Should I bring something?\" Woo Hyuk asked.\"Uhh, well anything phallus shaped really.\"\"Sounds good.\"So from that day on, the lovely Tony spent the colder parts of the year in the underground with his love, and the warmer seasons with his loving family. As a consequence, there was much less marry making and burlesque in the land of Seoul while Tony was in the world below. Except, of course, for the burlesque show the group called ShinHwa had running all year round, staring the angelic young man named Andy.",

She teases him back, too, laughing as she tickles the backs of his knees, until he rolls her over on her back and kisses her to make her stop. It's now long enough after that horrid time - and they have learned enough - that now when Psyche stands in the shadows of the bed and holds a candle above her husband, the drips are not accidental, and when he cries out, it is not pain that draws the cries from him, though they both play that it might be - she, dropping the candle to kiss the marks away; he, writhing beneath her until she's licked the heat of the wax away and replaced it with the heat of her own hands, mouth, breasts. It's now long enough after that horrid time that they greet mornings with pleasure, still wrapped in each other's arms, kissing each other awake. Mornings hold no fear for them anymore, and nor does anything else. They are content.",

    "text": "Your name is ROSETHENA. You are the DERSELYMPIAN goddess of WISDOM and WARFARE. You are worshiped as the PROTECTOR OF LIGHT and SEER OF HEROIC ENDEAVORS, though you prefer being the PATRON OF FEMALE ARTS AND CRAFTS. Especially weaving. But you wouldn't say that out loud. You came to be when you pushed yourself out of your MOTHER'S HEAD. And you've been a HEADACHE to her ever since. Effectively nicknaming you the Derselym-PAIN-ian. Whatever. She deserved it. That'll teach her to throw overly sugary COMPLIMENTS at your choice in short togas. And right now, you are ANXIOUS to get where you're going. You walk fast, but remain DIGNIFIED, as all goddesses must always remain dignified. You are anxious because today is the day you meet your PROSPEARTHIAN HERO. Most gods patron Heroes, but as Seer of Heroic Endeavors, you usually remain neutral, watching over their quests, offering occasional advice during difficult times. You even have the incredibly time-consuming task of figuring out how to honor fallen Heroes. Which is why you've involved yourself mostly in Arts and Crafts until now. Less messy, more rewarding. But a Hero chooses their god, and today someone was presumptuous enough to choose you. Which is altogether exciting, annoying and intriguing. But then, who wouldn't want your patronage and guidance? Should you decide to personally guide this Hero, you will, of course, teach them the finer points of weaving in place of anything actually useful in a battlefield. If they can survive that, they just might be worthy. It's not like you don't have enough to do already, what with everyone else's Heroes. Just the other day another one tried to fight the Squiddledra and ended up in pieces. You don't have time to be cleaning up after that and patron a Hero of your own. You don't have to accept them. You've rejected others before. Why should this one be any different? hi!! hiiiiii!!!!! oh my gosh, this is so exciting! Greetings, hero....You are the Hero, correct? You seem rather young. hehe, yep! my name is harleycles! i know most heroes wait a little longer, but i already knew i wanted your patronage, so why wait?:) Why indeed. I do feel it necessary to inform you that while all Heroes can choose a patron god, choosing the Seer of Heroic Endeavors is a bit redundant. I am obligated due to my position to oversee all Heroes. i know that! but overseeing isn't the same thing as patronage i've known i wanted you to be my patron my whole entire life! well...... except for maybe when i was a baby and didn't know anything I see. And how long has your whole entire life been? eleven years! maybe nine if you don't count the baby years, when i was learning how to talk and stuff hehe!:D Oh, well that is a very long time, then. i know!!!! In that case, it may be necessary to rethink my strategy. My plan for your first trial was to have you embroider a pillow with the full family tree of the nymphs of the Virgin Forest of Fraktos, but in the face of such fanatical devotion you clearly deserve a much more challenging task. Perhaps weaving an elaborate tapestry chronicling the history of the most vital moral dilemma of our time: Should togas have one shoulder strap, or two? We would have to build an appropriately elaborate temple to house such a wonder, of course. That can be your second task. hmm... Hm? hmmmmmmmmm!!!!! i think you're probably teasing me! but that's okay:) if you really want me to weave something i will! but that doesn't seem very heroic D: i know eleven years isn't very long to a god, but that's all the time i've had on prospearth! every minute of it! and......... if you accept me as your hero i promise to spend the whole rest of my life being the best hero ever and fighting in your name!!! it's all i really want:)... And if I refuse my patronage? To which denizen of Derselympia will you turn?oh um... no one, i guessIf you haven't even considered a second option, then I'm afraid you haven't thought this through.nuh-uh! i have thought it through! all the way, every day! choosing a patron is really really importantTrue, but that doesn't mean there is only a single option available.nooooooooo!!! if i can't be your hero, then i can't be the hero i really want to be so i might as well go be a dog trainer or something i mean, i like dogs, a lot! but i'd rather be a hero your heroI suppose I can't fault your determination. If your devotion is true, Hero, then you will need a token.oh boy!!!!Please take your hand out of the mirror pool. I can't pass the token through with the reflection broken.oh! sorry! i thought i had to grab itBodies cannot pass through the pool. Only objects. Wait one moment. ok! yaaaaaay!:D:D:D ----- She has a great many plans which she described to me in detail, most of which revolve around, \"being the best hero ever!!!!!!\" whoa simmer down now The enthusiasm nearly hurt. Though it doesn't really carry the same effect without the over-enthusiastic tone of voice. so that mean youre gonna skip all that useless arts n crafts bullshit Hardly. She's a child. I need some way to occupy her while her body grows to suit her ambitions. Still, I have high hopes. yeah and meanwhile i got terechilles the psycho blind chick whose main goal in life is to make yummy red stuff erupt from monsters arteries You didn't have to accept her. fuck that shes hero of the year material all the way last week i had her go paint over all the horse dicks in equiphaestus temple he got so pissed I was wondering what prompted that particular volcanic eruption. Sounds like you and Terechilles get along well. right about ready to propose in the middle of a fucking field of flowers move into a temple of our own get to making half-immortal babies and shit Careful. Don't let Nepedite hear you. fuck man don't get her started oooh nooo it never works out youre messing up my shipping scroll You can hardly blame her for getting involved. Emotional attachments of all sorts are her realm. I've never understood the worry. Why mourn a mortal when it's guaranteed another will rise to take their place? i know right what does she think we are fucking wood nymphs gonna run through the forest after some hot smoking mortal pining after them and shit until we disappear into thin air and then they turn into a flower or a tree because some mortals cant even die right never man itd be like you dropping a stitch on whatever epically irreverent thing youre weaving now or me failing to be the coolest damn deity ever just doesnt make a fuck of sense Forgive my interruption, but I suppose it would be asking too much to request that you cross your legs if you insist on wearing that meager slip of a garment in my quarters. fuck no you know i like a breeze round my nethers you got a problem avert thine eyes or some shit im just chilling all comfy over here Obviously your comfort is of the utmost importance. now youre getting it ----- You watch over your Hero. At first only when necessary. ----- Then regularly. I need more wool. sure! this is fun i like learning this kind of stuff from you I will admit you've been a much more dedicated student than I first anticipated. you thought i'd be a bad student? D:Not you, personally. You have to remember my contact with mortals has been largely indirect. I had assumed the worse, but there was really no basis for it. If it helps, you've far exceeded my expectations.awwwww!!!! yay! thank youAre you growing your hair out?oh...yeah, i guess i forgot to cut it i should do that, huh? so it doesn't get caught in fights?It would have to be very short to completely eliminate that possibility. Shorter than I've seen you wear it. Tying it back during battle should be sufficient.ok! whew!For what it's worth, longer hair seems to suit you.ooooooh thanks!!! <3 ----- Suddenly, it's every day and you didn't even notice. my grandpa was a great adventurer he was the best there was! i guess i could have done that, but adventuring seems lonely I can imagine. what about your family? My family? Come now, I know you've studied your history. You don't need to ask me that. i know! but the scrolls don't have everything, do they? i want to know about you My family is...complicated. If we weren't immortal we would have killed each other long ago. Of course, if we weren't immortal, maybe we wouldn't want to kill each other as much. well if it comes down to a big war of the gods, i would totally fight for you! The thought is appreciated. However, we've survived this long. I'm sure stability will be maintained for some time yet. Although if you happen to find yourself in my mother's temple and feel like doing some defiling, do feel free. do you really want me to do that?...Actually, no. Davysus would never let me hear the end of it if he found out I was stealing his ideas. hehehe!! I don't enjoy talking about my family, actually. Let's discuss something else. Your hair is getting long. yep! <3 ----- Even when she's away from her mirror pool, you observe. But only to make sure she's safe, of course. Your Hero has grown strong and true. You couldn't be more ecstatic, which shows nowhere on your calm, cool, dignified demeanor. You always remember to remain dignified. And Mother thought she was the only purveyor of Heroes. Well, she purveys them because she makes them. Because she sleeps around. Oh snap! sup sis Hello Davysus....Nepedite.:33 < *the playful goddess of love and shipping sidles up to her meowst wise companion*:33 < *she is clutching her almighty shipping scroll nervously!* The Goddess of Wisdom is simply shocked to see the legendary scroll. Truly, she cannot begin to imagine its secrets. Which makes her a poor Goddess of Wisdom indeed. It looks like the only recourse is to strip her of her divine appointment and cast her from Derselympia. yeah no this totally isnt a waste of time narrating shit as youre doin it:33 < it's fun!whatever we all know where this is going just show her the scroll:33 < i think you're flushed for that mortal! Fascinating. I do appreciate you sharing baseless speculation about my romantic life. XOO < it's not baseless! no one knows ships like i do Of course forgive me. And yet... You seem to be missing something.:33 < i am? I don't suppose my dear brother remembered to inform you of his matrimonial aspirations to the great Terechilles.:33 < what?!? fuck you that was ironic no one takes that shit seriously cept nep here and now you Please provide me with more insight into the innermost workings of my mind. Mother knows I can't fathom its mysteries on my own.:33 <:((:33 < it's okay! lots of gods develop a bond with their meowst furavorite mortal!:33 < but you've never appurred on the scroll with a mortal before:33 < and, well...you know the rules! you can only go to prospearth if you take another form, like a pink turtle, or an adorable kitty cat! trust me on that though any mortal whos into that shit isnt one you wanna get involved with:33 < and just betw33n us...:(( < i've never s33n a mortal/immortal ship that didn't go down in flames! Thank you for singling me out for this little talk. I do so love being treated as if I am incapable of handling my own emotions, or dealing with the consequences of my decisions.:(( < we don't m33n it like that! calm yo tits see this is what happens when we try to get sincere i told you nep i warned you dog:33 < XOO cat whatever:33 < we didn't m33n to make you mad Funny how our intentions get away from us. Thank you both, truly. However, I assure you I can handle a hypothetical doomed love affair perfectly well on my own. aight cool then we out cmon nep:33 < bye! You annoyedly regard the retreating figures of your self-appointed love counselors. If you wanted their opinion you most certainly wouldn't have asked for it anyway. You-- rosetheeenaaaa!!!:D did you see that? did you see me defeat the squiddledra?? Skillfully handled. hehehe, thanks! i did it for you <3 The thought is appreciated, if unnecessary. Your victories should be for your own sake as much as mine. uh yeah i guess but i like fighting for you! You must remember, however, that heroics are done for the glory of the Hero, not the god they serve. Patron gods should provide guidance, not serve as a primary motivation. If that were the case, the relationship would likely be considered too involved on both ends. These things play out a certain way, after all. bluh bluh!! Excuse me? it's just that sometimes you do this thing where you talk \"the way things should be\" and, ugh! i know i'm just a mortal and you're a god and you've probably patroned lots of heroes I haven't. Patroned, I mean. Not very many. Or any at all. but you still watch over them so maybe this isn't as big a deal to you but it's a really big deal to me!!! No, of course. Forgive me. My intent wasn't to diminish your accomplishment. Really, my sincerest congratulations. well thanks, i guess but....... i wasn't really talking about the squiddledra it probably doesn't matter to you though uh, never mind Don't. huh? Don't you or anyone else presume to tell me how I I I should go. no wait!!! rosethena?? rose!! i'm sorry!! i didn't mean that.:( you just always talk about the way things are supposed to be and i don't know if it's because you really think that or because you've experienced it??? i know you could have any hero you wanted i guess i could've chosen any patron god too but i chose you and you chose me right?? I did. oh!! While I never kept track of the number of Heroes I \"could have\" had, I accepted none of them. Until you. I hope you realize, despite my admittedly thick veneer of sarcasm and legendary passive-aggressive tendencies, that you are important. To me. rose this might be against the rules but i care about you a lot! more than as just my patron as in 'i love you' a lot!!!! and wow that was kind of a dumb way to say that but you know what i mean??? I do. And I can't pretend your feelings are entirely unrequited.:D:D:D For the record, you're breaking no laws. The path on which we find ourselves is well-worn. It's a bit of a cliche, really. Nevertheless, this is the first time I've found myself in this particular situation. As the Goddess of Wisdom, being in a situation of which I have no prior knowledge is, well, disconcerting. i bet! but that just makes it more special, don't you think? Maybe. However, that doesn't change the rules which govern us both. You cannot travel to Derselympia, and I cannot inhabit my true form on Prospearth. can i hold your hand?...I'm sorry, I seem to have simply imagined a fair portion of this conversation. Because if I had actually been speaking aloud, as I for some reason thought I was, you would know exactly why the answer must be \"no.\" noooooo!!!! through the mirror pool!! Harleycles. That won't work. We've discussed this. In fact, I remember it coming up during our very first conversation. just try it!...Very well. You consider how unfortunate it is that mirror pools aren't the most helpful when trying to be affectionate. Still, it's nice to humor her. augh!!! the water went up my nose!!!!!! D: D: ----- It's a few weeks later and you're sitting at your window, pondering. And there are many things to ponder. Good things and difficult things, the latter of which you'd rather not have to ponder right now. You'd rather focus on the good. On what you have now, which you've never had before. What you'd like to keep. Good thing you have plenty of time to figure that out. rose your hero is fighting becberus What?! didnt you tell her what a dumbfuck idea that was I did, but she... Oh god. To hell with dignified. You run as fast as you can. As Seer of Heroic Endeavors... You wonder what good is there in Seeing. ----- Your name is ROSETHENA. You are the goddess of WISDOM and WARFARE. You've seen Heroes fall before. Why should this one be any different? Illustrated to Katie Herzig's 'Wish You Well'",

      "every minute of it!",
      "and......... if you accept me as your hero i promise to spend the whole rest of my life being the best hero ever and fighting in your name!!!",
      "it's all i really want:)...",
      "And if I refuse my patronage?",
      "To which denizen of Derselympia will you turn?oh um... no one, i guessIf you haven't even considered a second option, then I'm afraid you haven't thought this through.nuh-uh!",
      "i have thought it through!",
      "all the way, every day!",
      "choosing a patron is really really importantTrue, but that doesn't mean there is only a single option available.nooooooooo!!!",
      "if i can't be your hero, then i can't be the hero i really want to be so i might as well go be a dog trainer or something i mean, i like dogs, a lot!",
      "but i'd rather be a hero your heroI suppose I can't fault your determination.",
      "If your devotion is true, Hero, then you will need a token.oh boy!!!!Please take your hand out of the mirror pool.",
      "I can't pass the token through with the reflection broken.oh!",
      "sorry!",
      "i thought i had to grab itBodies cannot pass through the pool.",
      "Only objects.",
      "Wait one moment.",

      "Though it doesn't really carry the same effect without the over-enthusiastic tone of voice.",
      "so that mean youre gonna skip all that useless arts n crafts bullshit Hardly.",
      "She's a child.",
      "I need some way to occupy her while her body grows to suit her ambitions.",
      "Still, I have high hopes.",
      "yeah and meanwhile i got terechilles the psycho blind chick whose main goal in life is to make yummy red stuff erupt from monsters arteries You didn't have to accept her.",
      "fuck that shes hero of the year material all the way last week i had her go paint over all the horse dicks in equiphaestus temple he got so pissed I was wondering what prompted that particular volcanic eruption.",
      "Sounds like you and Terechilles get along well.",

      "Don't let Nepedite hear you.",
      "fuck man don't get her started oooh nooo it never works out youre messing up my shipping scroll You can hardly blame her for getting involved.",
      "Emotional attachments of all sorts are her realm.",
      "I've never understood the worry.",
      "Why mourn a mortal when it's guaranteed another will rise to take their place?",
      "i know right what does she think we are fucking wood nymphs gonna run through the forest after some hot smoking mortal pining after them and shit until we disappear into thin air and then they turn into a flower or a tree because some mortals cant even die right never man itd be like you dropping a stitch on whatever epically irreverent thing youre weaving now or me failing to be the coolest damn deity ever just doesnt make a fuck of sense Forgive my interruption, but I suppose it would be asking too much to request that you cross your legs if you insist on wearing that meager slip of a garment in my quarters.",
      "fuck no you know i like a breeze round my nethers you got a problem avert thine eyes or some shit im just chilling all comfy over here Obviously your comfort is of the utmost importance.",
      "now youre getting it ----- You watch over your Hero.",

      "you thought i'd be a bad student?",
      "D:Not you, personally.",
      "You have to remember my contact with mortals has been largely indirect.",
      "I had assumed the worse, but there was really no basis for it.",
      "If it helps, you've far exceeded my expectations.awwwww!!!!",
      "yay!",
      "thank youAre you growing your hair out?oh...yeah, i guess i forgot to cut it i should do that, huh?",
      "so it doesn't get caught in fights?It would have to be very short to completely eliminate that possibility.",
      "Shorter than I've seen you wear it.",
      "Tying it back during battle should be sufficient.ok!",
      "whew!For what it's worth, longer hair seems to suit you.ooooooh thanks!!!",

      "what about your family?",
      "My family?",
      "Come now, I know you've studied your history.",
      "You don't need to ask me that.",
      "i know!",
      "but the scrolls don't have everything, do they?",
      "i want to know about you My family is...complicated.",
      "If we weren't immortal we would have killed each other long ago.",
      "Of course, if we weren't immortal, maybe we wouldn't want to kill each other as much.",
      "well if it comes down to a big war of the gods, i would totally fight for you!",
      "The thought is appreciated.",
      "However, we've survived this long.",
      "I'm sure stability will be maintained for some time yet.",
      "Although if you happen to find yourself in my mother's temple and feel like doing some defiling, do feel free.",
      "do you really want me to do that?...Actually, no. Davysus would never let me hear the end of it if he found out I was stealing his ideas.",
      "hehehe!!",
      "I don't enjoy talking about my family, actually.",
      "Let's discuss something else.",
      "Your hair is getting long.",
      "yep!",

      "You always remember to remain dignified.",
      "And Mother thought she was the only purveyor of Heroes.",
      "Well, she purveys them because she makes them.",
      "Because she sleeps around.",
      "Oh snap!",
      "sup sis Hello Davysus....Nepedite.:33 < *the playful goddess of love and shipping sidles up to her meowst wise companion*:33 < *she is clutching her almighty shipping scroll nervously!*",
      "The Goddess of Wisdom is simply shocked to see the legendary scroll.",
      "Truly, she cannot begin to imagine its secrets.",
      "Which makes her a poor Goddess of Wisdom indeed.",
      "It looks like the only recourse is to strip her of her divine appointment and cast her from Derselympia.",
      "yeah no this totally isnt a waste of time narrating shit as youre doin it:33 < it's fun!whatever we all know where this is going just show her the scroll:33 < i think you're flushed for that mortal!",

      "Mother knows I can't fathom its mysteries on my own.:33 <:((:33 < it's okay!",
      "lots of gods develop a bond with their meowst furavorite mortal!:33 < but you've never appurred on the scroll with a mortal before:33 < and, well...you know the rules!",

      "I do so love being treated as if I am incapable of handling my own emotions, or dealing with the consequences of my decisions.:(( < we don't m33n it like that!",
      "calm yo tits see this is what happens when we try to get sincere i told you nep i warned you dog:33 < XOO cat whatever:33 < we didn't m33n to make you mad Funny how our intentions get away from us.",

      "i did it for you <3 The thought is appreciated, if unnecessary.",
      "Your victories should be for your own sake as much as mine.",
      "uh yeah i guess but i like fighting for you!",
      "You must remember, however, that heroics are done for the glory of the Hero, not the god they serve.",
      "Patron gods should provide guidance, not serve as a primary motivation.",
      "If that were the case, the relationship would likely be considered too involved on both ends.",
      "These things play out a certain way, after all.",
      "bluh bluh!!",
      "Excuse me?",
      "it's just that sometimes you do this thing where you talk \"the way things should be\" and, ugh!",
      "i know i'm just a mortal and you're a god and you've probably patroned lots of heroes I haven't.",
      "Patroned, I mean.",
      "Not very many.",
      "Or any at all.",
      "but you still watch over them so maybe this isn't as big a deal to you but it's a really big deal to me!!!",
      "No, of course.",

      "i didn't mean that.:(",

      "i know you could have any hero you wanted i guess i could've chosen any patron god too but i chose you and you chose me right??",
      "I did.",
      "oh!!",
      "While I never kept track of the number of Heroes I \"could have\" had, I accepted none of them.",
      "Until you.",
      "I hope you realize, despite my admittedly thick veneer of sarcasm and legendary passive-aggressive tendencies, that you are important.",
      "To me.",
      "rose this might be against the rules but i care about you a lot!",
      "more than as just my patron as in 'i love you' a lot!!!!",
      "and wow that was kind of a dumb way to say that but you know what i mean???",
      "I do.",
      "And I can't pretend your feelings are entirely unrequited.:D:D:D For the record, you're breaking no laws.",
      "The path on which we find ourselves is well-worn.",
      "It's a bit of a cliche, really.",
      "Nevertheless, this is the first time I've found myself in this particular situation.",
      "As the Goddess of Wisdom, being in a situation of which I have no prior knowledge is, well, disconcerting.",
      "i bet!",
      "but that just makes it more special, don't you think?",
      "Maybe.",
      "However, that doesn't change the rules which govern us both.",
      "You cannot travel to Derselympia, and I cannot inhabit my true form on Prospearth.",
      "can i hold your hand?...I'm sorry, I seem to have simply imagined a fair portion of this conversation.",
      "Because if I had actually been speaking aloud, as I for some reason thought I was, you would know exactly why the answer must be \"no.\"",
      "noooooo!!!!",
      "through the mirror pool!!",
      "Harleycles.",
      "That won't work.",
      "We've discussed this.",
      "In fact, I remember it coming up during our very first conversation.",
      "just try it!...Very well.",
      "You consider how unfortunate it is that mirror pools aren't the most helpful when trying to be affectionate.",

    "text": "A pair of hands shoved him roughly from behind. He fell into the dirt hard. \"Tag,\" Demeter said, standing over him with a smirk. \"You're it.\" \"It's tag, not shove,\" Poseidon said, getting to his feet and brushing himself off. \"Sorry,\" she said, clearly not sorry at all. With a shit-eating grin still plastered on her face, she turned and ran back into the trees, shouting, \"Poseidon's it!\" Grumbling, Poseidon covered his eyes and started counting. The palms of his hands stung where they'd hit the dirt to break his fall. When he reached eikosi, he set off in search of retribution. He deliberately kept walking past the tree in which he knew Hades was hidden. He stopped at a bush he saw moving, but it was only Zeus and Hera fooling around. They looked up at him, startled, but he was already back on the hunt. He found himself in a field of tall wheat. She had to be hidden somewhere out here, he was absolutely sure of it; the problem was the field was huge, and as long as she stayed crouched down, she was effectively invisible. He had been walking around hoping he'd just stumble across her for several minutes when a pair of hands grabbed him around the ankles and pulled him down into the wheat. Before he could move, Demeter had turned him on his back and pinned him down by the shoulders. \"Tag?\" he said weakly. She leaned over and gave him a kiss on the lips, chaste but firm, then stood up and ran off, disappearing into the wheat once more. They fumbled in the dark with knots and laces, their hard breathing the only soundtrack. A breast was freed, and Poseidon's mouth found it. Demeter gasped involuntarily. \"This is,\" she said, her voice mostly breath. \"This is okay, isn't it?\" \"Of course it is,\" Poseidon is, but there was a quaver in his voice. \"Zeus and I do it all the time.\" Even in the dark, Demeter's stare must have been perceptible. \"Not with each other,\" he snapped. \"With other people. Girls, usually. I like, um. Naiads.\" His mouth found hers again, and there was a tearing sound as he tried to yank off something before it was ready. \"Ah. Oops.\" \"It doesn't matter. I can mend it,\" Demeter said, arching her body towards his. She wanted him then, badly, almost as much as he clearly wanted her. At last they were free of the confines of their garments, and suddenly Poseidon was at a loss for what to do next. \"Where do I... that is...\" He was blustering, grasping for anything to cover his ignorance. Demeter didn't care. She was as ignorant about these things as he was, but she knew her own body. She helped him find his way in, crying out when he did, nails still dirty from that day's gardening digging into his back. She thought of waves. She was leaving solid ground behind, becoming fluid and insubstantial. She let herself go, giving in to him and all that he was, all that she never understood no matter how hard she tried. But then it was over, before it ever really began. \"Oh yeah,\" he said drowsily. \"I rocked your world.\" He hadn't, really, of course, but she found she didn't care. She felt happy and satisfied anyway. She laid her cheek against his chest and whispered, \"I love you.\" For centuries afterward she would agonize over whether he was really asleep or only pretending. That was how long it took her to convince herself she didn't care that he never responded. \"You hid from Poseidon as a horse?\" Hera asked, shaking her head. \"I saw a flock of them--\" Demeter tried to explain. \"Herd,\" Hestia said. \"I think.\" Demeter waved a hand dismissively. \"I saw a bunch of them grazing and just... didn't think, I suppose.\" She shrugged as if it couldn't possibly have mattered less. But a part of her had been thinking. A part of her had wanted him to find her. A part of her was still pleased that he had. Poseidon took another long drink of wine and turned to grin at his new bride. She smiled back shyly, as beautiful as the day he first saw her dancing in the firelight. A king must have a queen, his mother had once said. And the moment he saw Amphitrite, he knew she would fill that role for him. He had tried to explain to Zeus just what it was that had drawn him to her. It wasn't just that she was a knockout, though that had certainly helped. It was something about the way she was as laid-back (and here he'd gone off on a several minutes-long tangent about her laying back) and adaptable as he, but underneath, there was a hard edge to her, a toughness, \"like an oyster turned inside out.\" Zeus had laughed at him mercilessly for that clumsy analogy, but Poseidon thought it was pretty good considering how drunk he was. All the same, though, his eyes kept finding their way back to Demeter. She looked good enough to ravish, and she knew it. But no matter how many times he looked at her, she was never looking back. Once he turned his head so fast he nearly gave himself whiplash, but she was deep in conversation with Despoina and could have been completely unaware of his existence for all she seemed to acknowledge it. Amphitrite reached over to take his hand, sensing his agitation. She was aware of his history of Demeter--it was impossible not to be, with his and Demeter's daughter feasting with the rest of the wedding party, and her twin brother grazing contentedly not far from where they now sat. But she couldn't begrudge either of them their pasts. He glanced back at Demeter, but her seat was empty. She had slipped away without him realizing it. It was time to settle old accounts. He brushed a kiss across Amphitrite's lips, excusing himself with the promise that he'd return shortly. Demeter was staring out at the sunset, Zephyr's gentle touch blowing her hair across her face. \"Enjoying yourself?\" Poseidon asked, stepping up beside her. \"She's lovely,\" Demeter said. \"You two will be very happy together.\" She paused, thoughtfully. \"Well. You'll be happy, anyway.\" He nudged her with his elbow, but she stayed steady as always. \"I already am.\" A silence fell over them then. \"Look, I...\" he said at last, heavily and uncertainly. \"Don't,\" she cut him off. \"This isn't what I wanted, not for us anyway.\" \"Amphitrite... she's not second place,\" he said carefully. A hint of a smirk played on Demeter's lips. \"Poseidon, you think entirely too much of yourself if you think I've been pining after you all this time. You'll note this comes as absolutely no surprise to me.\" She took a deep breath. \"Maybe I did want this for us, once. But that was a long time ago, before I realized it would be the worst idea in history.\" \"Worst? Not the worst, surely.\" They regarded each other for a moment. \"Yeah, you're right, it really would be,\" Poseidon relented. Demeter nodded. \"It takes more than sex to build a marriage. No matter how fantastic that sex might be.\" \"It was pretty fantastic.\" \"You should go back to her,\" Demeter said, nodding towards the feast. Poseidon nodded. He gave her shoulder a squeeze and planted a kiss on her cheek. \"See you round, Deo.\" \"Enjoy married life.\" There was a glint in her eye, that old mocking glint he knew so well, one that suggested chains and monotony, things she herself was determined to remain free of. He turned and went back to his wife, not regretting his choices at all. They broke apart, sweaty and out of breath and tangled in sheets. \"Mm,\" Poseidon muttered sleepily. \"Did I rock your world or what.\" Demeter shivered with pleasure. \"You desperately need a new line.\" He sat up and winked at her as he began to dress. \"Only for you, babe. Just remember, they don't call me the Earth-Shaker for nothing.\" She watched him go, back to his undersea palace and his wife. He was the tide and she the shore. They kept crashing together as inevitably as they drew apart again each time. And she was okay with that. It worked for them. Besides, she could only take so many earthquake puns at a go before she had to recharge her bullshit tolerance. It would take a while before she was ready for him once more, but when she was, she had no doubt they'd meet again as always.",

      "At last they were free of the confines of their garments, and suddenly Poseidon was at a loss for what to do next.",
      "\"Where do I... that is...\" He was blustering, grasping for anything to cover his ignorance.",
      "Demeter didn't care.",
      "She was as ignorant about these things as he was, but she knew her own body.",
      "She helped him find his way in, crying out when he did, nails still dirty from that day's gardening digging into his back.",

      "He had tried to explain to Zeus just what it was that had drawn him to her.",
      "It wasn't just that she was a knockout, though that had certainly helped.",
      "It was something about the way she was as laid-back (and here he'd gone off on a several minutes-long tangent about her laying back) and adaptable as he, but underneath, there was a hard edge to her, a toughness, \"like an oyster turned inside out.\"",
      "Zeus had laughed at him mercilessly for that clumsy analogy, but Poseidon thought it was pretty good considering how drunk he was.",
      "All the same, though, his eyes kept finding their way back to Demeter.",
      "She looked good enough to ravish, and she knew it.",
      "But no matter how many times he looked at her, she was never looking back.",
      "Once he turned his head so fast he nearly gave himself whiplash, but she was deep in conversation with Despoina and could have been completely unaware of his existence for all she seemed to acknowledge it.",
      "Amphitrite reached over to take his hand, sensing his agitation.",
      "She was aware of his history of Demeter--it was impossible not to be, with his and Demeter's daughter feasting with the rest of the wedding party, and her twin brother grazing contentedly not far from where they now sat.",
      "But she couldn't begrudge either of them their pasts.",
      "He glanced back at Demeter, but her seat was empty.",
      "She had slipped away without him realizing it.",
      "It was time to settle old accounts.",
      "He brushed a kiss across Amphitrite's lips, excusing himself with the promise that he'd return shortly.",
      "Demeter was staring out at the sunset, Zephyr's gentle touch blowing her hair across her face.",
      "\"Enjoying yourself?\" Poseidon asked, stepping up beside her.",
      "\"She's lovely,\" Demeter said.",
      "\"You two will be very happy together.\"",

      "\"Well.",
      "You'll be happy, anyway.\"",
      "He nudged her with his elbow, but she stayed steady as always.",
      "\"I already am.\"",
      "A silence fell over them then.",
      "\"Look, I...\" he said at last, heavily and uncertainly.",
      "\"Don't,\" she cut him off.",
      "\"This isn't what I wanted, not for us anyway.\"",
      "\"Amphitrite... she's not second place,\" he said carefully.",
      "A hint of a smirk played on Demeter's lips.",
      "\"Poseidon, you think entirely too much of yourself if you think I've been pining after you all this time.",
      "You'll note this comes as absolutely no surprise to me.\"",
      "She took a deep breath.",
      "\"Maybe I did want this for us, once.",
      "But that was a long time ago, before I realized it would be the worst idea in history.\"",
      "\"Worst?",
      "Not the worst, surely.\"",
      "They regarded each other for a moment.",
      "\"Yeah, you're right, it really would be,\" Poseidon relented.",
      "Demeter nodded.",
      "\"It takes more than sex to build a marriage.",
      "No matter how fantastic that sex might be.\"",
      "\"It was pretty fantastic.\"",
      "\"You should go back to her,\" Demeter said, nodding towards the feast.",
      "Poseidon nodded.",
      "He gave her shoulder a squeeze and planted a kiss on her cheek.",
      "\"See you round, Deo.\"",
      "\"Enjoy married life.\"",
      "There was a glint in her eye, that old mocking glint he knew so well, one that suggested chains and monotony, things she herself was determined to remain free of.",
      "He turned and went back to his wife, not regretting his choices at all.",
      "They broke apart, sweaty and out of breath and tangled in sheets.",
      "\"Mm,\" Poseidon muttered sleepily.",
      "\"Did I rock your world or what.\"",
      "Demeter shivered with pleasure.",
      "\"You desperately need a new line.\"",
      "He sat up and winked at her as he began to dress.",
      "\"Only for you, babe.",
      "Just remember, they don't call me the Earth-Shaker for nothing.\"",
      "She watched him go, back to his undersea palace and his wife.",
      "He was the tide and she the shore.",
      "They kept crashing together as inevitably as they drew apart again each time.",
      "And she was okay with that.",
      "It worked for them.",
      "Besides, she could only take so many earthquake puns at a go before she had to recharge her bullshit tolerance.",
      "It would take a while before she was ready for him once more, but when she was, she had no doubt they'd meet again as always."

    "text": "There was a prophecy that the sea-nymph Thetis would give birth to a son who was greater than his father. It was the old magic of Mother Gaea at work, part of her ancient plot to wreak revenge on Zeus for the suffering of her last-born children; the same magic that had brought Athena bursting forth fully formed from Zeus' forehead, after he devoured Metis for fear of the child she had conceived. And Zeus desired Thetis, for she was beautiful, but he could not lie with her, lest she bear a son who would kill him as he had killed his own father Cronus, and Cronus his own father Sky. Nor could he allow any other god to get her with child. So against her will he married her to Peleus, a mortal. Thetis' husband was a great king, a descendant of Zeus himself, but only a man, and the son that Thetis bore him was only a man. The greatest among men, yes, the best of warriors, but he went down into death's dark house all the same--he who but for a chance might have ruled the universe. *** Thetis was never happy in her marriage to Peleus. She lay with him, and she bore him a child because the king of the gods had commanded it, but she didn't love him. She longed for the sea and for her sisters, her fellow Nereids. She missed the cool green depths of Poseidon's ocean, and hated being shackled to the land, to one place. She tried very hard not to hate her husband. It was not his fault. But she resented him nonetheless, resented her captivity. It would be futile to curse Zeus, but Peleus was only a man. She could safely hate Peleus, in the privacy of her own mind, and no one would be the wiser. Her son, however, she could not hate. All through the long months of her pregnancy, she had intended to leave immediately after the child was born. She had consoled herself by imagining how she would put the child in his nurse's arms, get up off of her childbed, and walk straight into the sea, never to return.Her labor was long and difficult, for the boy was big, and there was something not quite right, that old power of the earth-mother twisting inside her, trying to find release, to accomplish its purpose. For a brief span of time Thetis felt pain as mortals feel. Then the child slid out of her all in a rush and something tore inside of her. The women around her shrieked and clutched at each other as the ichor that ran in her veins instead of blood poured out onto the bed along with the afterbirth. Then her body, which was not nor had ever been human, healed itself, and the screaming boy was placed in her arms. And Thetis looked down into his face and was lost. \"My son,\" she whispered. \"You are my son.\" The best of the Achaeans, both a gift and a curse. She looked on him, and she loved him. She held him close as he suckled at her breast, a good, strong baby, and thought of what he would be like as a man. Strong and beautiful and perfect. But even then in that first hour she mourned him, for she knew that he was mortal and that he must die, and that she herself must live forever. This is the only pain the gods feel, their love for us, fragile, ephemeral human beings, who blossom to beauty only once and too quickly, and then fade away as soon. So Thetis stayed ten years in Peleus' house after Achilles was born. Her husband never lay with her again after the birth of their son, for he could see she did not desire him, and no man may force a goddess, not even if she is his wife. But at the end of the tenth year, her longing for the sea became too strong, and so she called Achilles to her and told him she was leaving. He looked at her very solemn and said, \"Where are you going, mother?\" She answered, \"I am going back to the sea, where I was born. To where my sisters dance in the river ocean, and the tide-stream whirls the salty depths. Back to the deep places and the darkness and the silence.\" He said, \"When are you coming back?\" And it hurt her heart to see the hope in his eyes, the expectation that she would not leave him long. She answered, sorrowing, \"I will never return to your father, child. That is not to be. But I will return to you. When you need me, when I miss you, I will come to you. I will always find you.\" Then Thetis walked down to the beach and out into the sea, and was free, finally free, after a decade of unhappiness. But her son's grey eyes were like iron hooks tugging at her heart.",

      "All through the long months of her pregnancy, she had intended to leave immediately after the child was born.",
      "She had consoled herself by imagining how she would put the child in his nurse's arms, get up off of her childbed, and walk straight into the sea, never to return.",
      "Her labor was long and difficult, for the boy was big, and there was something not quite right, that old power of the earth-mother twisting inside her, trying to find release, to accomplish its purpose.",
      "For a brief span of time Thetis felt pain as mortals feel.",
      "Then the child slid out of her all in a rush and something tore inside of her.",
      "The women around her shrieked and clutched at each other as the ichor that ran in her veins instead of blood poured out onto the bed along with the afterbirth.",
      "Then her body, which was not nor had ever been human, healed itself, and the screaming boy was placed in her arms.",
      "And Thetis looked down into his face and was lost.",
      "\"My son,\" she whispered.",
      "\"You are my son.\"",
      "The best of the Achaeans, both a gift and a curse.",
      "She looked on him, and she loved him.",
      "She held him close as he suckled at her breast, a good, strong baby, and thought of what he would be like as a man.",
      "Strong and beautiful and perfect.",
      "But even then in that first hour she mourned him, for she knew that he was mortal and that he must die, and that she herself must live forever.",
      "This is the only pain the gods feel, their love for us, fragile, ephemeral human beings, who blossom to beauty only once and too quickly, and then fade away as soon.",
      "So Thetis stayed ten years in Peleus' house after Achilles was born.",
      "Her husband never lay with her again after the birth of their son, for he could see she did not desire him, and no man may force a goddess, not even if she is his wife.",
      "But at the end of the tenth year, her longing for the sea became too strong, and so she called Achilles to her and told him she was leaving.",
      "He looked at her very solemn and said, \"Where are you going, mother?\"",
      "She answered, \"I am going back to the sea, where I was born.",
      "To where my sisters dance in the river ocean, and the tide-stream whirls the salty depths.",
      "Back to the deep places and the darkness and the silence.\"",
      "He said, \"When are you coming back?\"",
      "And it hurt her heart to see the hope in his eyes, the expectation that she would not leave him long.",
      "She answered, sorrowing, \"I will never return to your father, child.",
      "That is not to be.",
      "But I will return to you.",
      "When you need me, when I miss you, I will come to you.",
      "I will always find you.\"",
      "Then Thetis walked down to the beach and out into the sea, and was free, finally free, after a decade of unhappiness.",
      "But her son's grey eyes were like iron hooks tugging at her heart."

    "text": "In the modern era there isn't much call for gods. Not the old gods at any rate. Nobody builds shrines to Nemesis or altars to Themis. Nobody curses Eris' whiles or tells tales of the wrath of Hephaestus. Most mortals get through their day quite happily without ever acknowledging that there were ever old gods in the first place. It's the sort of situation that modern storytellers like to imagine must make things difficult for deities. They write tales of gods pushed back into the shadows, of lessening powers and dwindling life. In the eyes of modern fable-spinners, the old gods are finished and, if any even remain, they are simply waiting to die. That is the modern fable after all, that man and his industry has surmounted even the creative fires of Hephaestus' forge. There's a copy of \"American Gods\" on the bedside table of the body Hephaestus sometimes inhabits. It wouldn't be entirely correct to call that body his avatar because at times he does honestly remember who and what he is. On other occasions he forgets entirely. Mostly he dreams in motifs of steel and cable. He dreams of concrete towers and fibre optics, and the revolution that changed the world. He is, after all, Invention, now given human form. Even now, when he doesn't really do all that much by way of physical creation, he polices the limits of human endeavour. He invents new structures and methods of Order over Chaos. Mostly, he's successful but occasionally, infrequently, a handful of unpredictable things slip through. Things that he hasn't foreseen, things that shouldn't occur, things that bear nothing so much as the hallmarks of Chaos. So he makes them Chaos' problem to clear up. Discord and Strife does very little as a general theme. Eris gets bored easily but, unfortunately, the true function of Chaos is to throw up a myriad possibilities. Eris doesn't get to do much more than lie on the couch and wait for the cards to fall. It's dull and uninteresting so Discordia collects dead body parts to try to make the days more interesting. It's hard to tell how much is Eris and how much is the host sometimes. Eris has a tendency to hook miniscule claws into the mind of any host at any given time, and this often results in a shadowy echo of something inhuman that lingers in each human mind. This host, for instance, is wildly disconnected from humanity at the best of times, and seems to entertain itself with cataloguing their idiosyncrasies at an alarming pace. Behaviour that makes Eris welcome Hephaestus' infrequent calls. Themis is ever patient, given to wise council. The current mortal shell is similarly disposed. Steady hands, steady aim as required. This mortal manifestation is quiet and unassuming. He is capable of apportioning out lots against the tally of the natural order. Justice prevails, injustice is struck down. Millions die for the greater cause. Themis is quite pleased with the choice of mortal hands just as comfortable holding a teacup as a scalpel. There is something quite beautiful about this compact form. It is tidy and neat in the way that the natural order requires. Perceived as meek and pretty, it has killed and will kill again. It is remorseless. It is, not just, merely inevitable. It follows where the state of nature must lead. It flourishes in the dark and damp cracks in the paving stones, in the places that sanitised humanity would like to forget. This is the natural order of things, the will of a Titan. Vigilance would be the watchword if only there were an urgency to the watching. There are many, electronic, eyes trained on the arena of course, but Nemesis is hardly inclined to simply sweep down upon the wrong-doer. Those who break faith are punished, but Nemesis engineers such retribution rather than enacting it firsthand. There are too many cheques to be balanced against an eternal system of checks and balances. Far too many things to occupy Nemesis' now, mortally constrained, attention. It is difficult sometimes to even find the time to eat or at least remind him, this mortal, to eat. He dines in the back seat of cars, at train stations or on aeroplanes. None of it is any good for his heath but, as long as he functions, as long as he serves the purpose to which he has been appointed, Nemesis doesn't object. Rarely, they meet. Gods in mortal form, wearing human shells. They gather to discuss the news of the day, as if they were merely a mortal gentlemen's club. They ponder the inevitability of others like them walking the Earth. Of course there are others like them out there. Cedalion lurks at Hephaestus' side. Clytemnestra strikes down those who fall afoul of Nemesis. Hermes toys with all manner of mortal vanity. Ares occasionally beds Eris. There are probably many more, but gods do not seek out other gods in this grand game of human chess. Instead, those who meet, fight or ally as appropriate. Thus, these four are content to gather, quietly, unassumingly, hiding in mortal shells. Themis sips tea and not wine. Hephaestus tastes the smoke of a cigarette and not the heat of his forge. Eris frowns at the static nature of human life. Nemesis leans on an umbrella and not a sword. Regardless of form, of common understanding, they are still worshiped. There are still mortals aplenty who cry out for Order, Chaos, justice or simply a natural providence. These are the same mortals who value revenge, care, anger or trickery. Ares alone makes millions simply as a result of their greed. Humanity doesn't change. Trappings, machinery, publicly accepted morality, are always in motion, but the layers beneath that, the hearts and souls of mortals do not differ. Their prayers still reach divine ears and are still summarily dismissed just as easily. The gods, after all, play their own games for their own amusement. Each has their own plan for the mortal world, regardless of mortal desires.",

    "text": "Hey all you cats and kittens, god of light, music, and awesome, Phoebus Apollo, here. I am trying out this new \"camcorder\" of mine. I got to thinking about what's missing from Thena's libraries and Hephy's archives, what I could contribute to our stores of knowledge besides all the other stuff I've already been responsible, directly or indirectly, for. Fabulousness doesn't take a holiday, after all. So, I said to myself, \"Self,\" I said, \"you know what we could really use a record of?\" \"What, Self?\" \"Stories about everybody's first time!\" \"Brilliant! That's absolutely brilliant. The world needs this.\" \"It does indeed. Shall we start?\" \"Let's shall!\" And now here we are. I presume it's only fair if I start with my own tale of defloration. I wager all are dying to learn just who it is who hath my maidenhead. It was a day of beauty. I lay under a smooth bowl of purest cornflower blue, the sun's gentle fingers playing on my skin as my own played my lyre in an ode to the majesty of the day around me. My digits moved across the strings like ten nimble dancers unencumbered by gravity, the sound sweet, pure, and clear. So entranced of the melody was I that I didn't even notice her till I had finished. She was a beauty, to be sure, and not unknown to me--as she was one of the Muses, I was her teacher and patron. When my song was done, I set aside the lyre and took her by the hands, pulling her down onto the emerald grass beside me. In that moment, I wanted her, in the way a man wants a woman--though admittedly, I had often wanted her in the way a man wants a woman, I mean, you have seen the Muses, right? [he whistles] But just then, it was only the two of us, and the curve of her body towards mine told me she felt the same way. And so there in the grass beneath the clear afternoon sky I took her. I explored the mountains and valleys of her body with my artist's hands, and also discovered motorboating is really fun. Aye, we did make the beast with two backs, and this beast's back ended up scratched all over. Never before and never since has there been a coupling such as ours. Ah, but gentle viewers, which Muse was this? There are nine of them, after all. Well, I can tell you sure and true her name... was Calliope. [beat] Wait, or was Urania first? Shit. Thalia? [indiscernible muttering while he counts on his fingers] You know what, I banged them all eventually. One of them was first. Consider this a Choose Your Own Adventure video. If Apollo slept with Terpsichore first, turn to page 394... Anyway, enough about yours truly for the moment. I now turn my lens to my fellow gods and goddettes out there to pose them the same question: \"What was your first time having sexual intercourse?\" I feel it is still going to take some effort to pin some of them down to get more specific answers, but that's a pretty unambiguous start! Dionysus, god of wine, partying, and solids What? You know this story already, homeslice. Tell it to the camera. For posterity! Yeah, you totally want my posterity. Duh! Now tell me about the first lady-type (or otherwise) who got a taste of it. [he sighs] Whatever. As you all know, my upbringing was... unique. Or do I have to explain that all in detail to your posterity as well? No, no, just get to the boning. Right. This story happens after I stopped wearing Persian clothing but before I journeyed east. So after you stopped cross-dressing but before you went nuts. [he continues speaking loudly over Apollo, as if not hearing him] I was not the most popular man in my village, for reasons unbeknownst to me. Possibly because they were jealous of my devastating good looks. You've all seen the statues. Yeah I've seen the statues. Shut up, yours aren't any bigger. Anyway, as I've been trying to say, this happened during some festival for one of you bigheaded fools up on Olympus. This was before I was one of you bigheaded fools, of course. I made the wine. Like Rudolph, I was shunned but served my purpose. Don't even make a red nose joke or I will punch you in the balls. There was this one girl in my village, Euthalia, who had always been somewhat different from the rest. Nowadays you'd probably call her a... what would you call her? Hipster. What? Wait a decade or two. It's gonna be a thing. Whatever. She was pretty, in a mortal way--you know, that sort of ordinary beauty so many of them possess. Not that I am knocking it, of course. I had seen her looking at me once or twice, but I was such a shy, demure young thing. [off-camera, there is laughter] Shut up! I know it's a difficult thing to believe but I was not always the irresistible magnetic creature you now see before you. Maybe it had something to do with always wondering when that bitch Hera was going to strike me down. She's not going to see this, is she? She'll have access to it. Doubt she'll watch it. Well. Leave the \"bitch\" in then. Where was I? Euthalia... festival... devastatingly handsome... Oh yes. So everyone was out and about celebrating someone-or-other, and I had seen to the wine and was kicking back, enjoying the fruits of my labor. Heh. Get it, fruits, wine? No? Shut up. Most everyone was ignoring me, but not Euthalia. She was obviously someone of great taste and discretion. She came over, blushing slightly, to tell me how she thought I'd done an amazing job. I suggested we go someplace more private to talk. It wasn't hard to find a deserted area behind some revelers' homes, though ultimately we didn't end up doing much talking. Well, she did do a fair bit of shouting, but that's to be expected. Anyway it wasn't long after that that Hera, that bitch, reared her ugly head again and, you know, sent me off on my travels. And I never saw Euthalia or that village again. [beat] Huh. Hope I didn't knock her up. Hermes, god of travel, communication, and fucking shit up hilariously Have I got a story for you! I was a precocious lad, clever and quick at an age when most children are still being delivered by their twin sisters. So it only stands to reason I was a bit ahead of the curve when it came to sexuality as well. I'm sure most in our family started out with godlings or nymphs or mortals, but not me, no sir. I went straight for the majors. My first big score was the goddess of great lays herself, Aphrodite. Now, we had to sly about it on account of that whole pesky \"she's married to Hephaestus\" thing, but fortunately, \"sly\" is my middle name. It's what the \"S\" in \"Hermes S. Awesome\" stands for. I was primed and ready to go and believe me I know I have never been the most patient of men, but even I was aware this was a delicate situation that required finesse. So, I waited until he went to work in his forge and then I finessed my penis into her vagina. Oh, the cleverness of me! Shut up, that's my line. Sorry, homeslice. Anyway this wasn't really a big complicated story, it's mostly just a story of me fucking Aphrodite. And loving it. A harrowing tale of subterfuge and deceit that ends in tears and tragedy for all. Excuse you, you may not recall I tapped that a few more times. Well I guess there is no accounting for taste! Hers, I mean, not yours. You ever hit it? No, I always had... other plans. Like with whom? Daphne? Marpessa? Castalia? Cassandra? How'd those work out for you, anyway? [a small projectile, perhaps a ball, appears from off-screen and hits Hermes squarely in the head] Ow! Persephone, goddess of spring and cowgirl-style sex [she is laughing hard] Oh Polly you are going to get punched in the face at least five or six times before you finish this. Actually can I follow you around? 'Cause I'd love to see that. Just answer the question, dollface. Fine, fine. I was out clubbing one night and totally wasted and there was this super hot bartender who'd taken off his shirt because it had more than a little bit of Captain on it, and I was like, isn't that a health hazard, and he was like, \"the only thing here that's hazardous to my health is how hot you are\"-- Oh Seph. You couldn't even get Tiresias to believe you were a virgin more recently than four thousand years ago. I just thought I'd spice it up a bit. Here's the real story, which will come as a shock to absolutely no one: after I got married and went back down to the Underworld, Hades and I slept together. Lights out, covers on, missionary position. Come on Seph, these are the kinds of details my viewers crave. [she rolls her eyes] Hi D! Hi Hermes! Shut up, this is totally a work of great historical import that will be treasured by all generations to come! [beat] Heh, come. Anyway, wait, after you went back? Yes, after I went back. No shenanigans went on during my first visit. He was a perfect gentleman. Okay seriously I've asked this before but it stands to be asked again: are you sure he's not gay? Oh trust me. I am sure. If he's gay, he's a gay man who really, really loves my vagina. Ares, god of war, bloodlust, and manly manliness Okay, so check it. I was at this thing--this... whatdoyoucallem... party! Yeah, it was like a party thing. With all the people and the music and the... there was probably wine there. I mean I'm assuming. Where was I going with this? Oh right. And that's the story of how I learned not to play with matches. No. Homeskillet. We're talking about how you lost your virginity. The first time you had sex with another person. Oh, right! Okay. That story starts with a party! [beat] Or wait, was it a party? Did I meet her at a party? Maybe it was more like a... war or something... Hey Apollo, was it a party or a war? I have less than no idea. Okay, so, it was at a war or a party... or wait, was it at a bathhouse? Maybe it was a party at a bathhouse, and then people started sword-fighting with their dicks. Ooh! Wait, no, that's stupid. You're stupid! Hey, where's my cake? You said there would be cake. I... am pretty sure I said no such thing. Okay, I just really want cake. You should give people cake. This isn't going to happen, is it. Oh my gosh, is that a pony? [he gets up and wanders off] [off-camera, there is a heavy sigh] Hephaestus, god of blacksmiths, volcanoes, and wicked cool robots [he stares blankly at the slice of chocolate cake sitting on a plate in his lap] Uh, Heph? The question? [he blinks up at the camera for a moment] Oh, yes. It was Athena. [there is a long pause] Beg pardon? Athena. She was my first. [another pause] Okay well this is a story I gotta hear, obviously. Well. [he shifts somewhat uncomfortably] She had come to me about the forging of some weapons. I had... admired her from afar for some time, and I'm ashamed to say that my desires got the better of me. I tried to... to force myself on her. Thank Mother Rhea she was able to get away from me. [another pause] Now I'm waiting for the part where you had sex. I didn't, not as such. But I spilled my seed and we have a child by this union. You know Erichthonius. Erich and I have both always considered Athena his mother. I think you'll agree it still counts. Oh then you are in for a surprise. Athena, goddess of not getting any...? I am afraid I do not understand the question. Come on, Thena. Sexual intercourse. You know what that is, don't you? Do not be ridiculous. Of course I do. What I do not understand is why you are asking me such a question. Well, it's a funny story. See, Hephy told a pretty wacky tale and I thought, hm, maybe our resident \"virgins\" aren't really as \"virginal\" as we all think. I mean, if Hera of all people can claim it on a regular basis, it's clearly not as difficult to hold onto as I might have thought. Ah, yes. You are of course referring to the encounter between Hephaestus and myself that resulted in the birth of Erichthonius. That's the one. Interesting, very interesting. Well, as true as that tale may be, I think you will still find that I have never enjoyed the company of a man in my bed or... elsewhere. I suppose Hephaestus is entitled to consider that incident as sexual in nature for him, but for me, it was merely, shall we say... an unscheduled experiment with notable results. So what you're saying is... Regardless of what Hephaestus has told you, I am unable to give you an answer to this question. I see. Bummer. Well. No cake for you. I do not like cake anyway. Liar. Everybody loves cake. A fallacious statement; there are plenty in the world who do not love cake. I happen to be one of them. Watch out, Thena! Your pants! They're on fire! Someone get me a fire extinguisher or one of those heavy smothering blankets! Your mildly humorous attempts at painting my statements as false do not change their validity, I am afraid. I know you are, but what am I? I must point out that your childish retort is nothing but a meaningless non sequitur. That's what she said! Yes, it is what she said, as I just said it a moment ago. Your face is stupid! If you will excuse me, I have an appointment to see a professor at Columbia Law in precisely one hour. [she stands and exits the frame] I fart in your general direction! Your mother is a hamster and your father smelled of elderberries! [there is a pause] Ah fudge. Well hello again! Looks like we are successfully back in business. Okay, quick recap of what happened: as it turns out, apparently not all virgins of Olympus take too kindly to having their maiden status questioned. The arrow went right through the lens and completely destroyed the machine as well as the footage I'd shot for that day, which, fortunately, was just that one \"interview,\" such as it was. Anyhoot, lesson learned: don't approach anyone who is carrying a weapon. Hindsight is twenty-twenty and all that! Aphrodite, goddess of great lays [she arches an eyebrow] You're asking me this question? Frankly, all of Olympus is dying to know. Is that so. You know, some traditions hold that I was born pregnant. Yeah, that's fucking weird. Were you? I'm afraid I can't answer that question on camera. It would ruin the mystery. Either way, I still want to know what your first actual sexual encounter was. All right, well. Like our dear Athena I was never a child. I was born fully grown and fully gorgeous. I came ashore on Cyprus in all my naked gloriousness, my beauty shining with the intensity of a thousand suns. Hey, hey, hey, waxing poetical is my shtick. I can't help it. It just happens. Anyway, blah blah blah shores of Cyprus, blah blah blah gorgeous. I was greeted there by the king of Cyprus, whose name I forget, but it started with an A. Or maybe it was a P. Oh well, not that it really matters I suppose. The point is, he was a hunk. I was like, \"Is that a mirror in your chiton, because I can see myself in your robes.\" His wife was really annoying about the whole thing, by the way, so I made her have sex with a bear. Hey, Aphrodite, have I mentioned today how fabulous you look? [she smirks] No but I'm listening now. Hebe, goddess of youth and Pac-Man [she giggles] Now that's a funny question. I bet you'll be surprised by my answer. Go on, see if you can't guess. Hmm, let me think... [she makes a buzzing noise] Time's up! It was Heracles. You know my husband Heracles, right? We've met. Aww, come on. Don't be such a grumpy-wumpy. He's loads of fun once you get to know him! And he's super good with his hands, which you can tell because he's so awesome at pinball! So, let's see. What can I tell you about that first time. Okay so, I was on Olympus, doing my maiden cupbearer thing, you know, like you do. And I was happy! I got to spend all day with my family and I wasn't really interested in any of that other stuff despite all the virtues I heard all of you extol. But then everything with Heracles happened and my mom was like, \"Hebe, you're going to marry him,\" and I was like, \"But Mom! I don't want to get married, and I don't even know the guy!\" and she was like, \"Yes, well, indeed, quite, I know it sucks but you gotta take one for the team.\" Direct quote, pretty sure. So anyway I was pretty cranky about the whole thing but then I actually met him and I found he's really good at jacks! So I was like, maybe we can make this marriage work after all! Anyway, the point of my story is that on our wedding night we slept together and I do not mean the kind that involves actually sleeping, all though after a few hours we were both so worn out we had to sleep and then we actually did sleep for a really long time, but before we got to that point let me tell you it took him about ten minutes to show me what I'd been missing all those years. I think it was on the second night we broke the bed. We've learned not to skimp on furniture since! Eris, goddess of fucking shit up with various results Oh, now this is a fun question. All right, let's see. My story involves a chair, a whip, and a smith whose wife really liked watching. It all started when-- The remainder of this content is rated NC-1700. Please use the following form to verify you are at least 1700 years of age to continue viewing. Iris, goddess of rainbows and unicorns Okay wow that takes me back. Well, um, okay, this story... is not one I've really told much, but mostly because nobody's ever really asked? Thank Pheme for me, then! [she rolls her eyes] Yeah, right. Well, okay. This happened at one of D's parties. One of his wilder ones, which you know is saying something. I had had a lot to drink--I think the technical term might be \"fuckton\"--and frankly I really don't remember much about that night. Just that it happened, and I think it was good, all though of course, drunken standards are lower than sober standards. Which party was this? Um... the one with the wine pool. You know, and he was like, \"I know one of you dickheads peed in there! I am never doing this again.\" But he did like six hundred years later. Not sure I remember that one. Anyway, so you don't remember who it was? Well, see, that's funny-slash-awkward thing-- Funkward! Um. Right Anyway, between what I do remember and what I pieced together after I was sober, I do know who it was. The problem is... he doesn't know. Oh man, that is funkward. Oh! Oh, wait! I know what party you're talking about now. The one with the inverted elephant pyramid, right? Yeah, that was the one. Ah, memories. That was a night of good life choices for all of us. Like Hermes banged this really hot chick whose name he never could--oh shit! [she is very deliberately looking anywhere but at the camera] Holy--your first time was with Hermes! Stop making me regret doing this stupid interview! Right, sorry. I just... whoa! Mind blown! Uh-huh. Are we done now? Yeah, um... you know what, you can have two slices of cake on your way out, if you want. I think I do want, as a matter of fact. Eros, god of love, sexuality, and guyliner It was Psyche! You and I both know that's a load of bull. No, I'm totally serious. After we were wed I struck my previous sexual history from the record. Look, if Hera can do it annually surely the rest of us are entitled at least once in our lives? Well yeah but nobody buys it when she does it either! Oh well. Psyche was my first and only. That's my story and I'm sticking to it. I mean, how could anybody want anybody else? When I think about her I touch-- TMI, homefry. What? TMI. Too much information. It's gonna be a thing. All though... that would make a really catchy song... [off-camera, there is humming] I don't want/anybody else... You know, I haven't seen her in like fifteen minutes. I miss her. [he sighs dreamily] The way her eyes get all crinkly when she smiles at me, the way her laugh sounds like the prettiest silver bells, the way the sunlight catches in her hair and makes it sparkle, the way she walks and it looks like she's gliding, the way anything always looks amazing on her, the way nothing at all always looks amazing on her... Yeah you can go now if you want. [he flees without another word] Hecate, goddess of putting a spell on you I haven't! Wait... what? I haven't, duh. I'm a virgin goddess. But... wait, no, that can't be right. I'm not as uptight about it as some other people I could name, but you are looking at a bona fide demi-vierge. But... you have kids! So does Athena. So does your sister. Those aren't her kids, they're her Hunters. Oh, Hunters! Is that what we're calling them nowadays. Seriously, you're putting one over on me, right? Wrong. Okay so... why not? [she shrugs] I dunno, I just always lose interest. Like this one time there was this Italian sailor going down on me but I was trying to read this book and he was starting to get really distracting so I had to chase him off. And there was this other time I was giving this guy a handjob but then I remembered there was this party I wanted to go to so I was like, oh yeah! Peace! And I left. [there is a long pause] I see. So yeah! No actual penis-in-vagina action here. Sorry! Yeah you're not getting any cake. Oh, was I not supposed to have that? I already had like two pieces. Oopsey! It's really good though. Can I get the recipe? [another pause] Yeah... I guess so... Hestia, goddess of tea and fluffiness You may be wondering why I am standing outside Hestia's door right now. It is not because I was dared to, no matter what Hermes says. I'm only here in the interest of research. So. [he clears his throat, then raises a fist to knock on the door] [the door opens, revealing Hestia] Oh, hello, Apollo! This is a pleasant surprise. What brings you here? Ah, yes, well, as you may have heard, I'm making a documentary. Oh, that's right, of course! Silly me! Come in, come in! [the frame bounces somewhat as he walks inside] Have a seat! [the frame lowers as he sits on a couch opposite the chair she takes] So. Here we are. Yes! How are you today, dear? Me? Oh, I'm super duper. Um... ah... I... have a question to ask you... Yes? [she smiles at him warmly] When... that is to say, what... who... um... do you have any tea? Of course! [she pushes a small plate on the table between them towards him] Here, dear, have a biscuit or two while I get it ready. [she exits the frame] [he takes a cookie] Thank you... Yeah, this isn't happening. Poseidon, god of the sea and belching the alphabet Oh, yeah, I've totally got the best story, way better than anything anybody else has told you. This is gonna blow all theirs right out of the water. Okay so, here's what happened basically: you know the Nereids? The fifty daughters of Nereus and Doris? Amphitrite's one of them but there are fifty total. Actually, there might be more than fifty. It certainly seems like that sometimes. Anyway, so the story of how I lost my v-card is one night I scored with all fifty at once. Yeah! That happened! Whoa! Okay. Who was first? Pfft. [he waves a hand dismissively] Like I can remember. It was just an endless sea of tits and pussy. They all wanted a piece of this. I couldn't have stopped them even if I had wanted to and believe me I did not want to. Oh man. A normal guy would have slept for like... a week after that marathon, but no, not me. I was up in an hour and banging chicks again. And I never looked back! Demeter, goddess of the harvest, agriculture, and nagging Oh, that. It was with Poseidon. As a matter of fact, I was his first too. That's not what he says. Right, of course. That story about all fifty Nereids in one night. Well, trust me, I was there, and that was not the penis of a man who'd \"banged\" even one woman, never mind fifty. First of all, I had to show him where to put it. Second of all, if he lasted more than thirty seconds, I'll eat a bag of Starburst. Third of all, I had to wake him up after an hour-long nap to go again. And fourth of all, only one of us was having orgasms and it wasn't me. I think this is my new favorite interview. Fortunately later in life he did improve, but trust me on this one. We were both virgins then, whatever tripe he fed you. Hades, god of the Underworld, capes, and brooding I'm not entirely certain I want to answer this question. Yes, well, I'm not entirely certain I want to be here listening to you answer, but I'm manning up. So should you. [he glares] Fine. As you know, unlike my brothers I have the ability to keep it in my pants when I desire. As such, comparatively speaking, I was what you might call a \"late bloomer.\" For whatever reason, Zeus and Poseidon took umbrage at this. They got it into their overly-thick skulls that they needed to \"remedy\" this, so they \"set me up\" with another goddess. I need a name. Styx, all right? You know, the goddess of one of the rivers in my domain. She was... interested as well, as it turned out. She was very lovely about the whole thing, and we had a very nice though brief affair. We realized that we were better as friends, though, and we have remained close ever since. It was not long thereafter that I fell in love with Persephone and the rest is history. With Persephone, and Minthe, and Leuce, and-- Yes, I get your point, thank you. Are we done? We are. Here, have a slice of cake that I definitely did not spit on. Hera, goddess of marriage and misplaced rage What a silly question. It was with Zeus, on our wedding night, of course. [there is a pause] Is that all? Yes. What, you're not suggesting I give details, surely? That's... kind of exactly what I'm suggesting. Well I never. I will not give you details of my wedding night! Fine, you can give me details of any of those other times you lost your virginity. I can see you making airquotes, and no, you will not be getting details of that, either. You have all you need. I take my leave now. Zeus, king of the gods and sluts All right, I suppose it's time I tell this story. Set the record straight and all. I hear there's a fence in Greece with a knot in it that people once worshiped as the first thing I put my penis in. The real story goes a little something like this: So, you know how after I was born, your grandmother gave me to a little shepherd's family to be looked after so that your grandfather wouldn't, you know, eat me. For a visual representation of the fate I avoided, check that Rubens painting I have hanging in my study, you know, the one where he's eating Poseidon. [he pauses to chuckle] Classic. So anyway, my sibs were all chilling in his gastric acids or whatever and I was hanging out with this shepherd's family. There was the older patriarch, the somewhat young matriarch, a teenage daughter, and a young son. You can see where this is going, right? Right? Totally! It was with the teenage daughter, right? Close, but not quite correct. The mother, then? Aww yeah. Still a little off. Oh. The son, was it? No, jeez, come on. The father had taken the son out for the day to teach him a thing or two about... whatever it is shepherds do. They herd sheep, Dad. Shep, herd. Whatever, whatever. The point is, it was just me and the ladies in the house. We got a little bored, a little lonely, a little horny. So, one thing led to another... Oh damn! You had both at once! Yep. Would you expect anything less from your old man? You've set a new standard for the losing of one's virginity. Well duh. Who do I look like, Poseidon? I should never have doubted. As long as you remember not to in the future. I will! [there is a pause] Wait... weren't you raised by a goat? [he pretends not to have heard] Hey, is that cake over there?",

      "I mean, if Hera of all people can claim it on a regular basis, it's clearly not as difficult to hold onto as I might have thought.",
      "Ah, yes.",
      "You are of course referring to the encounter between Hephaestus and myself that resulted in the birth of Erichthonius.",
      "That's the one.",
      "Interesting, very interesting.",
      "Well, as true as that tale may be, I think you will still find that I have never enjoyed the company of a man in my bed or... elsewhere.",
      "I suppose Hephaestus is entitled to consider that incident as sexual in nature for him, but for me, it was merely, shall we say... an unscheduled experiment with notable results.",
      "So what you're saying is... Regardless of what Hephaestus has told you, I am unable to give you an answer to this question.",

      "Bummer.",
      "Well.",
      "No cake for you.",

      "Yeah, that's fucking weird.",
      "Were you?",

      "It would ruin the mystery.",
      "Either way, I still want to know what your first actual sexual encounter was.",
      "All right, well.",
      "Like our dear Athena I was never a child.",
      "I was born fully grown and fully gorgeous.",
      "I came ashore on Cyprus in all my naked gloriousness, my beauty shining with the intensity of a thousand suns.",
      "Hey, hey, hey, waxing poetical is my shtick.",
      "I can't help it.",
      "It just happens.",
      "Anyway, blah blah blah shores of Cyprus, blah blah blah gorgeous.",
      "I was greeted there by the king of Cyprus, whose name I forget, but it started with an A. Or maybe it was a P. Oh well, not that it really matters I suppose.",
      "The point is, he was a hunk.",
      "I was like, \"Is that a mirror in your chiton, because I can see myself in your robes.\"",
      "His wife was really annoying about the whole thing, by the way, so I made her have sex with a bear.",

      "Hmm, let me think...",
      "[",
      "she makes a buzzing noise] Time's up!",

      "And he's super good with his hands, which you can tell because he's so awesome at pinball!",
      "So, let's see.",
      "What can I tell you about that first time.",
      "Okay so, I was on Olympus, doing my maiden cupbearer thing, you know, like you do.",
      "And I was happy!",
      "I got to spend all day with my family and I wasn't really interested in any of that other stuff despite all the virtues I heard all of you extol.",
      "But then everything with Heracles happened and my mom was like, \"Hebe, you're going to marry him,\" and I was like, \"But Mom!",

      "and she was like, \"Yes, well, indeed, quite, I know it sucks but you gotta take one for the team.\"",

      "So I was like, maybe we can make this marriage work after all!",
      "Anyway, the point of my story is that on our wedding night we slept together and I do not mean the kind that involves actually sleeping, all though after a few hours we were both so worn out we had to sleep and then we actually did sleep for a really long time, but before we got to that point let me tell you it took him about ten minutes to show me what I'd been missing all those years.",
      "I think it was on the second night we broke the bed.",

      "Which party was this?",
      "Um... the one with the wine pool.",

    "text": "She's a black-and-silver flame in the neon wonderland. He owns a good dozen clubs, but Delphi is, of course, his favorite. It's where he'd found her - tiny thing, all of seventeen, big dark eyes with too much knowledge in them. Called herself \"Cassandra\", though it's no more her name than \"Phoebus\" is his own. Sipping a glass of Scottish mead, he'd cast his eye over the perky little goth girls and the pierced metal boys, and he'd found her. Cass isn't the prettiest he's ever had, nor the thinnest, but she's by far the smartest. He'd invited her up to the lounge, and before even walking through the door, she'd pre-dialed 911 and told him if he tried anything, she'd be calling the police first and her lawyer second. (The daughter of Rex and Helen Priam? Of course she's got the best counsel in the country at her command.) She blinds him, and he can't understand why. He could have - as has had - actresses, dancers, artists, socialites. Women twice her age and ten times as beautiful. And yet it's tiny little Cass Priam who enchants him. Seduces him. Lights up like a shooting star when he makes her laugh. Bet your ass he's done his homework about her, though, and while her brothers are the spotlight-hogs, she's the one he can't get out of his mind. He's drawn to her every night she shows up at Delphi, drinks scotch or gin or wine while she touches nothing. Her drug problem is well-publicized; rehab at fifteen, clean ever since, a speaker for straight-edge teenagers. She's something pure; he should have known he'd taint her. While the rest of the mindless droves pop, smoke, and snort their way to ecstasy, when Cass loses herself, it's to nothing but the music. He can't remember wanting like this in years. Can't remember spending hours on the dance floor, hips tucked into the cradle of hers. His hands run up her thighs, steal touches of softest silk and skin, turn from teasing and slow to hard and possessive at her hips. Falls into the rhythm of her rocking, round, lush arse pressed against his cock. Dares to press the lightest of kisses to her face, her neck, and once, to the sweat-beaded tops of her breasts, her dark chestnut hair streaming down to her shoulders. What he wants, more than life itself, is to have her, but she will never give him that. He'll try everything, and only at the end will he realize that it never could have ended any other way. They are not meant for the great, all-consuming love; the only consumption for them will be despair. Ashes of what might have been. Because while her will is strong, her sense is weak. She has guarded her body jealously, but she has forgotten to guard her mind. He invites her to a room, drugs being passed around, and in a show of faith, drinks the very same water she does and eschews all offers of intoxication. Cass lets herself be lulled by the conversation and his fingers stroking aimless patterns on her legs, and it's then that he has her. It's so easy to press the cigarette into her hand, easy to coax her into taking a small puff and shotgunning the rest into his mouth. Small white stick, held between silver-painted nails, brought to a red-slicked mouth. Grey mescaline-laced smoke inhaled, then exhaled in a bitter rush against his lips. One puff. Two. Ten. The peyote works fast, and they're lying on the couch, seeing the truth bleed through the walls. Strobing lights of purple and white - royalty, truth, purity, yes, Cass and he are certainly that combination - deep bass rumble of Nick Cave over the sound system. A devil waiting outside the door, yes, quite appropriate. Cass wriggles to lie atop him, whispers of Wednesday being yellow, but to beware a black Thursday. Tells him his numbers are too red, they need to be green or brown and they're bleeding. He leaves her sleeping off the high, and goes to Pythia. Something is going to happen next Thursday, something to do with the night deposits. Someone will try to cheat him, and now that he's forearmed, he can stop it. (There will be a fight, there will be blood, but he'll find his manager skimming off profits and he'll deal with it. He'll owe the averted loss of millions to Cass Priam.) She calls him the next morning, sobbing and damning him for getting her addicted again. Her tears break his heart, a little, but he needs her. No one but Cass sees true futures, and as far as he's concerned, he owns her. Despair is mascara-streaked cheeks, a wail of his name, and a girl lying almost broken on a too-expensive couch. There is great beauty in despair, if you know where to look.",

    "text": "\"I love you as certain dark things are to be loved,in secret, between the shadow and the soul.\"- Love Sonnet XVII by Pablo Neruda The full moon hung low in the sky above her. Diana lifted her face to it for a moment, enjoying the view. On Themyscira, she would have joined at least one of her sisters in murmuring an appreciative prayer to Artemis upon seeing the moon's splendor. Here, alone with her thoughts, she whispered, \"I thank you for the beauty of the moon, my lady Artemis.\" Her gaze still fixed skyward, she walked down the street towards her hotel. The noises of the city pressed against her, distant, now-familiar sounds of Man's World-- the wail of a car alarm, the howl of a cat, the laughter of a few youths. She was in Keystone City tonight, as she had been for the past week. Wally had requested her aid in dealing with a couple of the Rogues as well as the villain who called himself Rainbow Raider. The battle with the latter had been brief but well-fought, and in the many nights to come, Rainbow Raider's view of the sky would be obstructed by the prison bars of Iron Heights. Captain Cold and Heat Wave, too, now sat in Iron Heights awaiting judgment. Three weeks ago she had visited Clark in Metropolis and helped him to quietly thwart one of Lex Luthor's plans. A week before that, she had aided John in Central City. She did not know where she would be, come morning. The thought did not weary her, precisely, but sometimes she found herself longing for a city to call her own. Themyscira was her true home, of course, but she had no place to call her own in Man's World, not like Bruce had Gotham and the others had their respective domains. Even J'onn had had the Tower and now his home with Ming. \"Evening, Ms. Prince,\" Marco said at the entrance, smiling at her-- Bruce always insisted that the hotels she frequented be \"respectable\" enough to have a doorman. This hotel had not proved the exception to the rule. \"I saw the news about the Rainbow Raider. Thank you.\" \"Good evening, Marco,\" Diana said, smiling back. \"I can't take much credit this time. The Flash did most of the work.\" Marco nodded, looking unsurprised to hear that Wally had defeated the villain. Diana always found Keystone City's citizens and their whole-hearted faith in Wally refreshing, especially whenever she came to this city soon after venturing into Gotham. \"Does this mean you'll be leaving tomorrow?\" Marco asked. He grimaced in disappointment at her nod. Rubbing the back of his neck, he said, \"Too bad. My wife was just about to try that halvah recipe you gave me--she was going to make a batch for you if her first few tries turned out decent.\" Diana smiled regretfully. \"Perhaps she can make some the next time I am in the city,\" she suggested, mouth almost watering at the thought. She hasn't had decent halvah in what seemed like forever. Marco grinned at that. \"Sounds like a plan to me, Ms. Prince.\" He tipped an imaginary hat towards her and added, \"You have a good night, now. Get a good night's rest.\" Diana climbed the steps to her room. True, she could have used the elevator, but she was staying on the third floor in this hotel. If she'd used that contraption, she would have had to endure a voice in the back of her head murmuring of sloth. (The voice tended to sound suspiciously like her mother's.) It had been a long couple of days, and Diana let herself into her room with a relieved sigh. She closed the door and leaned against it for a moment, closing her eyes and taking a deep breath. She'd have a nice long shower, she thought, and then perhaps allow herself to sleep in tomorrow morning. \"You look tired,\" someone observed; there was a half-amused, half-concerned note in the woman's voice. Diana's eyes snapped open. She instinctively shifted her footing to a defensive one. In the privacy of her own mind, she cursed a long string of invectives that would have made Wally blush, Clark frown, and Bruce smirk. When had she grown so complacent? Her room had been occupied and she hadn't even noticed, had stood there like an oblivious fool while this intruder could have attacked her. Now that she was actually paying attention, she could feel another person's presence in the room, hear the faint sound of someone else's breathing. \"Who's there?\" she demanded. Her gaze swept the room, but there was no one in plain view. The door to the bathroom was wide open--someone could have been hiding behind the shower curtain, but the voice had sounded as though it were coming from the empty bed. \"Show yourself,\" she said, voice harsh. \"What?\" The intruder sounded puzzled now. \"Diana, I--oh, I'm sorry. I forgot I was veiled.\" There was a flustered burst of laughter, and then a familiar form shimmered into sight, reclining regally on Diana's bed and arching a pair of delicate eyebrows at her. Diana stared, not relaxing from her defensive position. This had to be a trick of some sort. \"Psyche? What brings you here?\" She frowned, wracking her brain, but she could not think of what would bring Psyche to Man's World, much less to Diana's hotel room. \"Is something wrong on Mount Olympus? Is Eros in danger?\" Psyche held up a hand and Diana bit back the half-dozen questions caught in her throat. \"Diana, calm yourself,\" Psyche said gently. \"Olympus is well, if you consider being dreadfully boring well, and my beloved is fine.\" Despite her words, a small frown twisted the goddess's full lips, a slight crease on her forehead marring her otherwise perfect features. Psyche had been attractive before Zeus had made her a goddess, of course, but she had been beautiful in the way that mortals were beautiful, with a fragile, fleeting loveliness. Now she had the impossible beauty of an immortal. \"Then what is wrong?\" Diana asked. \"I mean no offense, but I doubt you came for a social visit.\" \"No, I did not,\" Psyche agreed, still frowning. \"I have come to warn you.\" \"To warn me?\" Diana echoed. She thought quickly, imagining the type of threat that would bring Psyche of all the deities to warn her. Surely Hermes would have been more appropriate, as messenger of the gods. \"Is Hades--\" \"This has nothing to do with Hades, I'm afraid, and everything to do with Aphrodite,\" said Psyche. Diana's heart pounded a quick, agitated beat in her breast. For all that many mortals thought of Aphrodite as a tender goddess concerned only with bringing lovers together, all Amazons knew better. Aphrodite was a callous, narcissistic goddess who amused herself by forcing love upon those who didn't want it, who caused atrocities like the Trojan War through her vanity, who brought mighty Amazons such as Antiope to her knees for the pure thrill of it. No Amazon held love for Aphrodite in her heart. And indeed, Aphrodite was no friend to the Amazons. \"And what is Aphrodite planning that would bring you down from Mount Olympus and to my doorstep?\" Diana asked quietly. Psyche sighed, brushing her long dark hair away from her face and fixing Diana with a grim look. \"She has grown bored of late. Before, she was entertained by the antics of politicians and Hollywood. Breaking up marriages and causing unlikely love affairs seem to have lost their flavor. Now she turns to a more difficult challenge--you and the one called Batman.\" \"Me and the--me and Batman,\" Diana echoed, and her heart gave another little jump. Diana felt weak all over, her head spinning, her heart pounding loudly in her ears. \"Psyche,\" she breathed, horror making it nearly impossible to speak. The words caught and tore at her throat as though they were slivers of glass. \"Tell me she has not used Eros's arrows, tell me she has not done this abomination to B--\" The last time she had seen Bruce he had appeared his normal self, but that meant nothing. Bruce could have been pricked by one of Eros's arrows at anytime, could be hopelessly in love with her and never let it color the timber of his voice or reach his pale eyes. He could have been suffering in silence for months and she never would have known. Diana thought, stricken, of the conversation they had had before Circe had interrupted them. \"I'm a rich kid with issues - lots of issues.\" Had he been hiding his feelings for her then, masquerading behind his dark sense of humor? Had that kiss in the restaurant, the occasional intense look she'd caught from him over the years, all been brought about by Aphrodite's effort? \"She has not used the arrows,\" Psyche said, and Diana breathed easier. Psyche's eyes gleamed bright with mischief as she added, \"She had planned upon using them, but it seems Eros has somehow misplaced his bow and arrows. Aphrodite is furious at his carelessness.\" Diana managed a smile at that, weak though it was. She took in a deep, calming breath, and then another, until her heart settled back into a more natural rhythm. Her mind raced, thinking and discarding her options at quicksilver speed. \"I shall go to Themyscira at once,\" she said. Psyche looked puzzled. \"Forgive me, but what can your mother do that one of the gods cannot? I assumed you would ask Athena to protect your Batman, and Hera to protect you.\" \"And so I shall,\" Diana said, deciding it wasn't the time to correct Psyche about the 'your Batman' remark. \"But my mother has a necklace given to her from Zeus himself, which protects any mortal from a god or goddess's attentions so long as the mortal wears it. If she will let me borrow it, I shall give it to B-Batman. He, at least, will be safe from Aphrodite's mischief.\" She stumbled over Bruce's name--doubtless, Psyche knew full well who Batman truly was, but Diana would not dishonor Bruce's demand for privacy by telling his name to anyone, not even to a goddess she considered a friend. Psyche tilted her head, looking intrigued. \"How did Hippolyta come by this necklace? I have not heard the tale.\" \"It happened long ago, before I was born,\" Diana said with a small shrug. \"My mother would not tell me all the details, but she aided Zeus somehow, and the necklace was her reward. Not many know of it, but the necklace has been used throughout the centuries. Aeneas wore it when he fled Troy, though he lost it sometime during his journey and a naiad returned it to Mother.\" She smiled. \"The story of the necklace is as lost to history as the tale of your time on Themyscira.\" Psyche laughed. \"That is sad. The task Aphrodite assigned me on your island was the easiest of the five, thanks in no small way to your help. It would have been enjoyable, even, had I not been worried I would never see my beloved Eros again.\" \"Perhaps that is why the tale was lost. It was far less exciting than the other tasks,\" Diana said wryly. \"Easy tasks make for less interesting legends.\" Psyche smiled. \"I believe you're right.\" Then her features darkened once more. \"I would accompany you to Themyscira if I could,\" she said softly, earnestness writ stark upon her face, \"but I already linger too long here. Should Aphrodite realize I told you of her plans, she would be furious. My peace with her is tentative at best--I do not wish to invoke her ire. She is already angry enough at Eros.\" Her dark green eyes were solemn. \"Aphrodite will use every power against you once she learns you are trying to thwart her plans. Be careful, Diana. I cannot stand openly against my beloved's mother, no matter how much I disagree with her, not if I want some small measure of peace upon Olympus. Eros and I have done what we could, but we must stand aside from now on.\" \"I understand,\" said Diana. She took Psyche's hands in hers and squeezed them. \"I thank you, Psyche. With this knowledge, I have at least a hope of preventing Aphrodite's mischief.\" Psyche tugged her hands out of Diana's grasp, and then enveloped the Amazon in an embrace. Diana closed her eyes and breathed in. Psyche smelled strongly of sunlight, and faintly of nectar, as though she had been sipping at a drink when Aphrodite had announced her plans. Had it really been over two millennia since Psyche had come to Themyscira, a young woman determined to do whatever it took to find her immortal lover? The two princesses, one mortal, one not, had had such an adventure together. In times of discontent, Diana still savored the memory of Aphrodite's astonished expression, as well as the goddess's poorly concealed fury when Psyche had succeeded in her fourth task. \"Diana,\" Psyche whispered, nectar-sweet breath warm on her ear. \"Answer me one question before I go.\" Diana suppressed the urge to shiver at the sensation. Sweet Hera, but Diana had been young then, and as prone to infatuation as any youth. She had loved Psyche with a quiet, hopeless passion, knowing that Psyche's heart belonged only to her beloved god. That had been a long time ago, however, and Diana's heart was less foolish now. Though no less fixated upon impossible persons, she thought deprecatingly. \"Whatever you ask, I will answer as well as I can,\" she said. \"Diana,\" Psyche said again. She sounded almost tentative, an unusual note indeed to hear in a goddess's voice. \"I know Aphrodite means this for her own amusement, and that you would not have her meddling in your relationship with Batman and invoking unnatural feelings, but...you docare for him, do you not?\" Diana didn't speak for a long moment. Were her feelings so obvious then, to be so easily read upon her face? Psyche had only visited her for a few minutes, and yet she'd already uncovered Diana's sentiment. She should be careful in the future--not only goddesses were interested in uncovering any weakness of Batman's. Batman had far too many enemies for her to be so careless. \"I do,\" she said quietly into the silence. A wry smile tugged at her lips. \"And I believe he feels the same.\" \"Then why have you not--\" \"Batman desires for our relationship to remain professional, and I will abide by his wishes.\" No matter how wrong Diana thought Bruce was in denying his feelings, she was not going to allow Aphrodite to turn Bruce's emotions upon him, to strip away his defenses and sully their relationship by use of Eros's arrows or any other unnatural means. She would bring Bruce around to her point-of-view in her own time, not through Aphrodite's interference. She let her head rest briefly upon Psyche's shoulder and confided, \"Sometimes I wonder if Batman has the blood of a god flowing through his veins. He is certainly as stubborn as one.\" Psyche laughed. \"Like calls to like, I suppose.\" When Diana raised her head to question the goddess, Psyche laughed again, the sound as sweet as silver bells. \"Do not look so puzzled, Diana. You are just as obstinate.\" Diana wavered for a second between an offended frown and a wry smile. She settled on the latter, since Psyche's declaration was not entirelywithout merit. \"I suppose my mother would agree with you,\" she said. \"Speaking of your mother, do not forget to give Hippolyta my blessings,\" Psyche said. She released Diana, stepping back and smiling. \"And extend those blessings to all on Themyscira. Eros and I will never forget your assistance.\" \"I will. Psyche, it was good to see you,\" Diana said sincerely. \"It has been far too long since you visited Themyscira. Please know that you are always welcome.\" \"Perhaps I will visit once Aphrodite has set her attentions upon some other unfortunate mortal,\" Psyche said with a bitter twist of her lips. She caught one of Diana's hands in hers once more, gave it a brief squeeze before she released it. \"Be well, Diana. Good luck.\" The goddess's form flickered, guttering like a candle for a brief instant, seemingly in and out of existence. Then the goddess vanished and a butterfly fluttered before Diana. The bright moonlight dappled the goddess's wings silver, but Diana knew that the wings were all the colors of the rainbow. She had seen the goddess's guise before, the colors glowing bright under Apollo's sun when Psyche had returned briefly to Themyscira to tell Diana and the other Amazons of her newly granted deification. \"Be well, and give Eros my thanks,\" said Diana, and opened the window to let Psyche out. Psyche flew swiftly out into the night air. Diana leaned out the window, watching long after the goddess had disappeared from view. Then she sighed, closing the window and letting her head rest briefly against the cool glass. Hera help her, there was no time to hesitate, no matter how weary she felt. She had no way to know how quickly Aphrodite would discover where Eros had concealed his quiver of arrows or that Psyche had warned her. Sleep could wait. Diana would rest once the necklace was safely around Bruce's neck. She raised her head with effort, and tapped her earpiece. \"J'onn?\" she said. There was a momentary stretch of silence, and then the Martian's deep voice filled her ears. \"Yes, Diana, I am here.\" \"I wish to be put on the inactive list for the time being,\" she said, and then hurried on before J'onn could ask what was wrong. \"I need to visit Themyscira.\" J'onn paused, and although she knew he would not scan her mind without her permission, she nevertheless carefully blanked out her thoughts, focusing on her longing to see her mother, her desire to breathe in the air of Themyscira and rejoin her sisters for a brief time. \"Very well,\" J'onn said. Not for the first time, she was grateful for J'onn's understanding of the need for privacy. \"Do you know how long you will be away?\" Diana frowned at her own reflection in the window. Her strained features stared silently back. \"I am uncertain. Hopefully I will be able to resolve things in a few days,\" she said. \"I will contact you as soon as I am able.\" \"I will inform the others that you are visiting Themyscira and do not wish to be disturbed,\" J'onn said. \"Farewell, Diana.\" The thought came to her that perhaps this was a true goodbye. Aphrodite did not take kindly to her plans falling apart, after all, and even Hera and Artemis could not always protect their beloved Amazons. Antiope was proof enough of that. This might well be the last time she spoke to J'onn or heard his deep, calm voice in her ears or mind. She shook her head, banishing the morbid thought. \"Farewell, J'onn,\" Diana said softly, and ended the connection. She started to turn the earpiece off, and then hesitated. Should she contact Bruce, warn him? She frowned. How could she explain that the goddess of love had taken an interest in them without embarrassing them both? And besides, what could she tell him? Be wary of arrows? She scoffed a little at the idea. Furthermore, once Bruce learned of Aphrodite's plans, he would insist on stopping her himself, which could only lead to worse trouble. Still, she could not leave him completely ignorant. She pressed a button upon her earpiece and said, \"Code 21A, Wonder Woman to Batman.\" There was a long pause, a full minute passing before the earpiece crackled with static. \"Princess,\" Bruce said, his voice a low rumble in her ears. \"I saw the news about your work with The Flash. Already bored?\" She smiled. \"Why, do you need some help in Gotham?\" she asked, teasing. He didn't rise to her bait, which was just as well. Had he invited her to Gotham she would have known something was definitely wrong and that Aphrodite had done somethingto him; Bruce would have to be on his last legs or in equally dire straights to invite any of the other members of the Justice League into Gotham. She and Clark had found that asking for forgiveness rather than permission was far easier when it came to Bruce and entering his city. \"No, I'm calling to warn you,\" she continued. \"Apparently some of the gods on Mount Olympus are growing bored, and might resume meddling in the mortal realm. I am going to Themyscira to see if my mother can intervene, but Gotham seems to be of particular interest to them. I thought you would appreciate the heads up.\" \"The gods are interested in Gotham,\" Bruce muttered. \"Have you noticed, Princess, that you never call me when it's goodnews?\" Diana laughed. Despite her anxiety, she felt herself relax a little at Bruce's familiar sarcasm. \"And you constantly call me up to gossip over John and Vixen's relationship, of course,\" she said, voice warm with amusement. \"Do you know which gods in particular?\" Bruce asked. His tone darkened as he asked, \"Circe isn't back, is she?\" Diana hesitated, wondering how honest she could be with him. \"I am still investigating, but I know that Aphrodite has turned her eye to your city,\" she said slowly. \"The goddess of love is interested in Gotham,\" Bruce said, incredulous. \"Apparently Gotham is more interesting than Hollywood,\" Diana said. Her face warmed. Suddenly she was glad that Bruce could not see her. One look at her flushed cheeks and he would have known that she was concealing something. Her mother had always said she was a terrible liar. \"Be careful,\" she cautioned him. \"Aphrodite doesn't play fair.\" \"I've read a few myths,\" Bruce said, tone dry. \"Trust me, the part where Aphrodite offering Paris a married woman helped to spark the Trojan War did not go unnoticed.\" Diana smiled. Well, this conversation was going better than expected. Bruce didn't seem inclined to insult Aphrodite to her face and get himself cursed or killed before Diana could get the necklace. \"Give my regards to Alfred and Robin,\" she said. Despite her better judgment, she wished for a moment that she could see him. No doubt his features would be concealed behind his cowl, but that wouldn't hide the glimmer in his eyes or the smirk on his lips. \"And...be careful. I'll be back as soon as I can.\" \"I can take care of myself,\" he said, sounding a little amused. \"You can take care of yourself against Gotham's villains. You haven't gone up against a goddess before,\" Diana reminded him. The words came out sharper than she intended, and she grimaced. It was usually easy to forget that Bruce was mortal, that he relied on his intelligence and skills rather than super-powers to fight crime, but right now she couldn't help but remember how he had felt in her arms when they'd danced--not fragile by any means, but warm and alive and oh so mortal. \"A word of advice,\" she said, attempting to sound as though she were teasing him. \"Don't do your 'I am the protector of Gotham and you are not welcome' speech to Aphrodite. She takes offense easily.\" \"Princess,\" Bruce said, and stopped. \"Diana,\" he said, in an entirely different tone, one dark and almost angry. Oh yes, that was definitely his Batman voice. \"You know, you would make for an awful poker player.\" Diana blinked, thrown by the apparent non-sequitur. \"Excuse me?\" \"You can't keep your temper when it matters,\" he said, the words enough of a rebuke that she found herself flushing in a mixture of anger and embarrassment. \"Now, explain what's really going on, or I will tell J'onn that you're under mind control and force him to tell me your coordinates.\" Diana sighed a little. \"That was not one of your better threats,\" she said, striving for a light tone even as she began to pace the hotel room. \"Besides, we both know that you are well aware of where I am. You selected this hotel room for me, after all.\" The evasion fell flat, and she grimaced once more. \"Tell me what's going on,\" Bruce snapped. \"I can't work with half-truths, Diana. I need to know everything.\" \"Is this a secure line?\" Diana began. \"It's secure enough,\" Bruce said, and that was when Diana realized that he was worried. \"I,\" she began and stopped, closing her eyes and trying to organize her thoughts. This line might be secure, but with the gods involved, who knew who could possibly be listening in on their conversation. Finally, she said, in the most even voice she could muster, \"Aphrodite is no friend to the Amazons. It seems she has decided to entertain herself by using Eros's arrows upon us.\" \"Eros's arrows,\" Bruce repeated flatly. \"Those would be the ones that make people fall in love.\" \"Yes,\" Diana said. \"Fortunately, Eros's quiver seems to be lost for the moment, so she has not succeeded in her plan. I am doing what I can to stop Aphrodite--\" \"Do you expect me to sit and twiddle my fingers while you stop her?\" Bruce asked. She couldn't figure out his current tone, if he was acting as Batman now, furious over her attempt at deceit, or as Bruce, concerned and worried. \"No, I expect you to protect Gotham and trust me to handle this myself,\" Diana said. At least Bruce had not demanded to go to Mount Olympus and speak to Aphrodite personally. She pictured Batman on Olympus, staring up at Zeus with an unimpressed expression and his arms folded against his chest. Despite herself, a faint smile twitched at one corner of her mouth. She continued, \"I have more experience with the gods than you do.\" \"I've studied more than the Iliad, Diana. I know what Aphrodite's done to the Amazons over the millennia,\" Bruce said. \"Yes, well, if I have my way, my name won't be linked to Antiope or Hippolytus,\" Diana said. \"Be safe, Batman. I will contact you once I've resolved things.\" \"Diana,\" he said, but the rest of his words were cut off in a crackle of static as she turned off the earpiece. She took it from her ear, turning it over in her fingers and studying it. She waited a moment, but apparently Bruce wasn't resorting to contacting J'onn, for the Martian's voice did not invade her mind. After a moment she sighed and tucked the earpiece into her belt. She'd turn it on again once she had spoken to Mother and retrieved the necklace. Diana glanced around the room, but there was little here to call her own. She had some civilian clothes in the dresser and a few bathroom essentials, all easily discarded. It was the matter of a minute to gather the items and the room key and take them to the front desk. \"Ms. Prince?\" Marco blinked at her, and she wondered what sort of expression she must be wearing to have earned that concerned frown. \"Is everything all right?\" \"I'm leaving a little bit earlier than expected,\" she explained, smoothing out her expression into a polite smile. \"Could you see that these are donated to a local shelter? I won't need them where I'm going.\" Marco's frown deepened. \"Are you sure you're all right? You look....\" He trailed off and flushed, ducking his head. \"Never mind. It's none of my business. I'll make certain they get donated to a shelter.\" \"Thank you,\" Diana said, and took her leave of him. The sun was just beginning to rise over the island when Diana landed on Themyscira's shore. The sky was colored all manner of pale pinks and reds, and Diana smiled at the sight of it. Salt stung her lips faintly as she took in a deep breath. Home, a quiet voice whispered in the back of her mind, and a weight she hadn't previously realized existed seemed to vanish from her shoulders. Home. Surely things would go well now that she was back on the island. Mother would present the necklace without objection to save a protector of Man's World, and Diana would go to Gotham, and Bruce would be safe from Aphrodite and all her plots. \"Please, Hera, let it be simple,\" Diana prayed, bowing her head. \"Diana!\" Harmothoe all but flew across the beach to enfold her in her arms. Her normally grave face was bright with joy. \"The queen did not tell us you were visiting!\" Despite her worries, Diana smiled back and returned the embrace. \"Harmothoe! It is good to see you. And the queen couldn't have told you to expect me, for she doesn't know I am here. I need to speak with her, urgently.\" Harmothoe held her at arm's length, a worried gleam creeping back into her dark eyes. \"Is something amiss, Your Highness?\" she asked, formality and concern sharpening the words. \"Aphrodite seeks to harm Batman, one of the warriors who aided me when Themyscira was attacked,\" Diana said. \"I have come to ask Mother for Zeus's necklace, to shield him from her tricks.\" Harmothoe's eyes widened; first shock and then understanding bloomed on her features. \"Zeus's necklace,\" she murmured. \"Now that is something I haven't heard mention of in quite some time.\" The warrior released Diana and knelt to retrieve her fallen spear. \"Let me escort you to the queen. She will be at Hera's temple.\" The morning hymn had just ended as Diana and Harmothoe entered. Their fellow Amazons were just beginning to disperse to their daily tasks, but a few spotted Diana and let out cries of surprised delight. Many of the women, catching sight of Diana, flocked to her. Over their heads, Diana could see her mother beginning to make her way down from her pedestal, moving with slow certainty. Donna pushed through the crowd to throw small arms around Diana's waist, giggling and sniffling at the same time. The past few years had been good to the girl; her cheeks were flushed with good health, and none of the grief and terror Diana remembered from the fire shadowed her eyes. \"Diana! Diana! I missed you! Are you staying?\" Donna asked, bouncing a little on the balls of her feet. She looked disappointed when Diana shook her head. \"Are you at least staying tonight? We could hold a feast!\" Pitane said hopefully, her smile dimming as Diana was once again forced to shake her head in denial. She ignored the sudden twinge in her belly reminding her that she hadn't eaten since yesterday morning. \"The Batman is in danger from Aphrodite,\" Harmothoe explained, leaning on her spear and wearing a somber frown. \"The princess has little time to prevent Aphrodite's mischief. She must speak to the queen immediately.\" Pitane and Cynna exchanged alarmed glances. \"Aphrodite?\" they said together. \"Who's she? And why does she want to hurt Batman? He's a good guy!\" Donna said, her sweet voice puzzled. A few of the women shot the child startled looks before understanding softened their expressions. Of course Donna would not know of the acrimonious history between the goddess and the denizens of Themyscira. She was not Amazon by birth; Diana had brought her to the island only five years ago, having saved the girl from a fire at an orphanage in Man's World. \"Aphrodite,\" snarled another familiar voice. Grief thousands of years old touched Lysippe's voice as she pushed to the forefront of the crowd. She pressed her hand to the hilt of her sword and declared roughly, \"Your Highness, if you need aid, I will stand with you against Aphrodite. I--\" \"Hold, Lysippe,\" Diana said softly. Sympathy made her choose her next words with careful precision. \"I cannot make an obvious stand against Aphrodite, not if I value Themyscira's safety. I can only hope to thwart her by slyer means and keep her wrath at bay.\" Lysippe's face had darkened in disappointment and disbelief as Diana's words had registered. Now she made a harsh noise in the back of her throat that could have been a laugh were it not for the fury in the sound. \"By craven means, you mean,\" she snapped. \"And meanwhile Aphrodite continues her offenses against our island, with not even our princess brave enough to speak against her--\" \"Lysippe, you forget yourself,\" Pitane said sharply, and several of the others nodded in agreement, their expressions varying from angry to sorrowful to compassionate. Donna looked from face to face, her mouth puckering in dismay at the obvious anger and tension in the air. \"You will speak to the princess with respect, or you will answer for your words.\" Diana shook her head. She rested a gentle hand on Donna's head and gave it a reassuring pat for the poor child looked to be near tears. The girl leaned against her, resting her full weight against Diana's knee. Donna mumbled something too low to understand, but it had a plaintive tone to it. Doubtless she wanted them to stop fighting. \"Peace, Pitane,\" Diana said. \"Let Lysippe speak. Themyscira is not a place to dictate anyone's thoughts or words.\" \"Now that I have your permission to speak freely,\" Lysippe said, her words dripping with bitter sarcasm, \"I will say it: how long must I wait for vengeance for my son? You and your mother do nothing while Aphrodite makes sport of us.\" Her voice rose. \"Aphrodite turned Antiope over to Theseus's cruelty, forced my son to--\" She choked on the words, and turned away, but not before Diana had seen the tears in her eyes. \"Lysippe,\" she said quietly. She reached out her free hand, then hesitated, uncertain if the gesture would be welcomed or rejected. \"Lysippe, I am sorry for your loss, but I cannot bring a goddess to justice. If I brought her before Zeus and demanded an apology for Tanais and Antiope--\" And Hippolytus and Areto and Pantariste and all the others killed or harmed to provide Aphrodite some amusement,she didn't add, but the faces and names seemed to hang in the air nonetheless. \"--I would be laughed from Mount Olympus.\" \"We are immortal, but we are not gods, Lysippe,\" Diana's mother said. Diana had not heard her approach, but the others took a step back and allowed the queen to walk up to Lysippe and press a hand to her shoulder. \"We cannot rebuke the gods, no matter how we may wish to.\" Lysippe shrugged off the queen's hand. \"Cowards,\" she said thickly, and then repeated herself louder, spitting out the word, \"Cowards.\" She walked away from them, out of the temple and into the sunlight, her shoulders braced against her sorrow. Cynna sighed. \"Please excuse Lysippe's words, Your Majesty. I do not think even another two millennia could ease her grief over Tanais. I will go and speak sense to her.\" She waited for the queen's nod of assent and then hurried after Lysippe. There was a moment of silence, and then the queen said, \"Did I hear correctly? Batman is in danger from Aphrodite?\" \"Yes,\" Diana said. She kept her hand upon Donna's head, for the girl did not seem inclined to move. \"I need the necklace, the one that Zeus gave you--\" She stopped, for her mother's expression had tightened, something like dismay widening her eyes. \"Mother?\" \"I do not have it,\" her mother said. Diana's heart sank. \"The last time the necklace was used, it was damaged and I sent it to Hephaestus for repairs.\" The queen frowned. \"To be honest, I haven't thought of it in centuries. We have seen so few outsiders in the past thousand years that we have had no need of it.\" Diana pressed her free hand to her lips, trying to think. It was not the disaster it seemed at first, she told herself; she would simply have to make another trip. \"I will go to his forge, then,\" she said. \"What payment did you promise him?\" \"No payment,\" her mother said with a shake of her head. \"It was he who created that necklace at Zeus's request. He considered it an insult to his craftsmanship that I had somehow managed to damage it.\" \"That will make things a little easier,\" Diana murmured. \"I am sorry, Mother, but I must go. I do not know how long Eros's arrows can remain concealed, nor do I know how long it might be before Aphrodite loses patience and uses some other means to distort Batman's mind.\" \"Diana,\" her mother said, stopping her speech with a touch to her arm. \"Before you go, I would speak with you in private.\" Her gaze flickered to the onlookers; most took the hint and began dispersing. \"It will take but a moment,\" she added when Diana hesitated. \"Of course,\" Diana said, and the other Amazons bowed to her and left, many shooting concerned glances over their shoulders as they exited the temple. Only Donna remained, her cheek pressed firmly against Diana's leg. After a moment, Diana sighed and tugged her away. She knelt on the smooth marble floor, meeting Donna's reddened eyes. \"Why's Lysippe so mad?\" Donna asked, sniffling. Diana bit back another sigh. How to explain without giving the child more nightmares? Donna was too young to hear of that particular atrocity. \"A long time ago, Lysippe had a son named Tanais. Aphrodite did something that...\" \"That killed Tanais,\" her mother supplied when Diana faltered, uncertain of how to phrase it in delicate terms. \"Oh.\" Donna digested this for a moment. She looked puzzled. \"Then aren't you going to punish Aphrodite?\" Diana shook her head. \"Aphrodite is a goddess, child. That makes things complicated.\" \"If the goddess did a bad thing and made Lysippe cry, then you should punish her,\" Donna said, a stubborn note creeping into her voice. Diana recognized that particular expression well; it was the look of an eight-year-old who wasn't going to take no for an answer. \"You're Wonder Woman.\" Diana resisted the urge to wince. \"Donna,\" she said quietly. The explanation that she was not infallible for all her gifts died on her lips at her mother's firm words. \"I will explain why Diana cannot punish her later, Donna. Now you must go see Pitane. It's time to meditate.\" \"But--\" Donna began to protest. \"Now,\" the queen said, the command ringing through the temple. \"What is it, Mother?\" Diana asked after Donna, sulking and still bewildered, throwing half-accusing glances over her small shoulder, had left. \"You mentioned Eros's arrows,\" her mother said softly. \"Aphrodite plans to use them upon you and Batman?\" Diana fought back a blush. Hera help her, was she going to have to explain their relationship to her mother as she'd explained it to Psyche? She had hoped to have this conversation-- well, never, if she were completely honest. \"Yes,\" she said. \"Psyche told me that only Eros concealing his bow and arrows prevented Aphrodite from doing so earlier. That is why I must have the necklace, Mother. I cannot let Aphrodite pervert Batman's feelings in such a way.\" Her mother wetted her lips with her tongue briefly. \"The golden arrows force unnatural love upon those they strike, so that the wounded man or woman falls in love with the next person he or she sees,\" she said. \"What do the arrows do if the wounded person is already in love?\" \"Mother?\" asked Diana, blinking in confusion. Why was her mother asking things that Diana had learned as a child? She bit her lower lip. \"It destroys that tenderness, forces that person to love whoever they've just seen rather than the person they truly do care about--\" \"You misunderstand me,\" the queen said. \"What if the wounded person is already in love with the next person he sees?\" \"I-- I don't know,\" Diana said. She frowned. Had that ever happened before? \"But Mother, even if he does love me, he is unwilling to admit it. I would not have Aphrodite force a confession from his lips.\" \"No, you would rather have him willingly tell you his feelings,\" Hippolyta said with a shrewd look. Diana flushed and didn't rise to the bait. \"I suspect that the golden arrow would make his feelings consume him. I would not want him devoted to me like some lovesick fool.\" She grimaced at the thought of Bruce looking at her with a besotted expression and murmuring sweet endearments. After a moment, her mother said, \"Be careful, Diana. Get to Hephaestus's forge, quickly. My prayers go with you.\" \"Thank you,\" she said, and briefly embraced her mother. \"After this is over, I shall come home for a longer visit, enjoy that feast Pitane was so eager to have.\" \"I look forward to it,\" the queen said, a look in her eyes that Diana couldn't quite read. Diana could hear Hephaestus long before she could see him. The staccato beat of his hammer made the volcano shudder beneath her feet. No doubt a few mortal scientists were currently looking at their machines in confusion, wondering if the volcano was readying itself to erupt. \"Lord Hephaestus!\" she called. She made her way through the twisty tunnels, squinting into the dimly lit corridors for any clue as to which way she should go. She pressed a hand to the wall to steady herself, and then pulled it away with a grimace of disgust and shook off the spider-webs that clung to her fingers. \"Lord Hephaestus!\" she called again. This time she timed her yell for that brief beat of silence between hammer strikes. \"Here!\" a gruff voice answered her. \"I'm in here.\" She followed the sound of his voice and the hammer. The corridor widened at last to a cavern where the god had set up his forge. She blinked a little at the sudden brightness, her eyes tearing up briefly, for there were torches set up all along the walls. The god had his back to her, his broad shoulders bare and glistening with sweat as he raised his hammer high above his head and brought it down with another ear-ringing clang. Huge muscles rippled under freckled and scarred skin as Hephaestus continued his work. It must have been a good day for him, for she saw no sign of his wheelchair or the cane he sometimes used. \"Lord Hephaestus!\" she shouted, stepping further into the cavern. \"Please forgive my intrusion--\" \"Your intrusion?\" Hephaestus snorted. He turned to face her, his face ruddy from the heat. An ember had caught in the wild tangle of his dark beard. Even as she watched, the ember glowed red and then fell apart into ash. He fixed Diana with a sharp, assessing scowl and drawled, \"Well, at least you're aware that you're wasting my time. You have no idea how many fools barge into my forge and demand my attention as though they have a right to it.\" He had a deep voice which rumbled much like the volcano itself and seemed to shake even Diana's frame. Diana bowed, very low, trying to ignore the nerves that shivered up her spine. Hephaestus was notorious for his foul temper, but at least he seemed to be in a decent mood today. \"I hope only to take a brief moment of your time,\" she murmured. \"Yet another refreshing change of pace. You aren't entirely thoughtless, little Amazon.\" Hephaestus's lips parted in a crooked grin at her look of surprise. \"Yes, I know who you are, Princess Diana of Themyscira. I might not give a damn about most of the Olympus gossip, but even I couldn't help but hear about your various exploits, both against Hades and in Man's World.\" He sounded faintly approving. \"Besides, I recognize my handiwork when I see it.\" He nodded at her bracelets and tiara. Diana flushed. \"Thank you, my lord. In truth, it is a matter of Man's World that brings me here. I need the necklace you crafted for my mother, the one that protects the mortal bearer from unwanted attention by the gods.\" \"I was wondering when someone would come around to collect that,\" Hephaestus said dryly. \"It's only been about seven centuries, give or take. Which god are you hoping to escape, princess?\" Diana hesitated. Hephaestus and Aphrodite had no love lost between them, but still, saying the goddess's name around the blacksmith god was never a good idea. \"Aphrodite, my lord,\" she said quietly. \"She threatens a dear friend of mine with Eros's arrows.\" Hephaestus snorted, looking unsurprised. \"I might have known it was Aphrodite with one of her little tricks,\" he muttered. \"I'll be but a moment, little Amazon.\" He set the hammer down on his forge and straightened himself to his full height, wincing as, she supposed, his twisted back protested. Diana averted her eyes as Hephaestus limped across the room. It was unnerving to see a god's face lined with pain, to hear his harsh breathing as he forced his damaged body to obey him. It was a relief when he grunted in satisfaction. \"Here's the necklace, little Amazon. Give it to your mortal with my blessing,\" he said, and Diana looked up in time to watch him toss the glittering necklace towards her. She caught it instinctively, pressing it to her chest for a moment before holding it up to the flickering torchlight for examination. It was a splendidly simple little thing, made up of carefully crafted links of gold and copper. The only ornament was a single golden disk with the mark of Zeus carved upon it as well as a few lines in the god's language that made her eyes hurt to view. Diana looked away after only a few seconds, blinking until the tears were gone. Then she smiled, relief making her heart leap in her chest. \"Thank you, my lord,\" she said with another bow. Hephaestus nodded back, waving a large, impatient hand. \"Yes, yes, you're quite welcome, now go.\" The final word was not quite snarled, but had the deep tone of a command. \"Thank you,\" Diana murmured again, and left at a speed that was nearly a run. As soon as the tunnels opened up to reveal blue sky, she leaped upwards, turning sharply west towards Gotham. It was evening by the time Diana reached Gotham, the sun having long since sunk below the skyline and turned the city sky a dark, deep blue. It was an overcast night, but the moon was, for the moment at least, in the one cloudless patch of sky. She cradled the necklace to her chest, unwilling to let it out of her sight even as she alighted briefly atop one of Gotham's many towers. A block away, voices were raised in argument. Diana frowned. Normally she would intervene, try to broker some sort of peace, but tonight Bruce came first. She pulled the earpiece from her belt, fitting it once more into her ear. \"Code 21A, Wonder Woman to Batman,\" she said. There was a long moment of silence, and she frowned, unease tightening her chest. Had she come too late? \"Wonder Woman to Batman, can you hear me?\" \"Princess,\" Bruce said in a crackle of static. \"I was about to send J'onn after you.\" He sounded like his normal self, and Diana grinned with relief, tension easing from her frame. \"I am beginning to get the feeling that you don't trust me, Batman. And to think I went halfway around the world to get you this present,\" she said lightly, smiling upwards at the moon. \"Aw, you shouldn't have,\" he deadpanned. She could picture the small smirk curving his lips, the flicker of amusement in his eyes. No doubt he had his arms folded against his chest as well and was leaning against a wall for the full effect. \"Let me guess. Is it Penguin all nicely tied up with a bow?\" \"No, something much better, I assure you,\" she said, fighting back a giddy laugh. She held the necklace up for another good look, admired the way even the gold turned silver in the moonlight. Hephaestus had done fine work when he had crafted this. \"I need to give it to you as soon as possible,\" she continued. \"Where can I find you?\" There was a pause, but this one meant Bruce was thinking. \"Meet me at the place we last fought the Joker together,\" he said and disconnected the call before she could answer. Trust Bruce to speak in code even on a supposedly secure line, Diana thought with a fond shake of her head. Still, she flexed her weary legs and sprang once more into the air. It was a matter of minutes to reach the rooftop where she and Bruce had last apprehended Bruce's nemesis. Bruce was already there, as still and silent as the gargoyle upon which he was standing. For a moment she almost let her gaze skip over him, he blended into the statue so well. It was only his cape billowing behind him in the strong night wind which betrayed him to her. His expression was unreadable as she landed behind the gargoyle. \"Diana,\" he said, turning slightly to face her and inclining his head in a curt hello. His gaze flickered briefly over her, an assessing look that went from the top of her head to the soles of her feet. Apparently having assuring himself that all the bits and pieces of her were properly accounted for and that she had encountered no danger during her trip to Themyscira, he folded his arms against his chest and waited for her response. \"Batman,\" she answered, clutching the necklace with hands that suddenly felt clumsy and prone to dropping things. She eyed the side of the building for a second, and then took a careful step away from it. \"Here.\" She held the necklace out to him. \"You brought me a necklace,\" he said. She couldn't see his eyebrows behind his cowl, but she was certain that they were raised. There was a certain quizzical set to his mouth. \"That was...generous of you.\" She waggled the necklace at him like one would dangle a string before a cat, and said hurriedly, \"Put it on. It will shield you from all of Aphrodite's mischief.\" Her shoulders tightened with expectation. In a moment Bruce would don the necklace, and she could sleep easier, knowing that he was safe from immortal harm. Her eyes itched at the mere mention of sleep and she blinked away the sudden grittiness pervading her eyes. If Bruce hadn't been watching her, she would have given into the temptation to rub at her eyes; instead she balled her free hand into a fist and ignored the sensation, shifting her weight from one foot to the other. Bruce took the necklace from her with his dark gloved hands, examining the disk with a slight downward twist to his mouth. He turned the necklace over, squinting at the intricacies of the joined links. \"Of course it would be a necklace,\" he muttered, resigned, and then moved to put it on. Diana watched him, biting her lower lip to keep from looking too thankful. Bruce would only be uncomfortable with her obvious relief and concern, she knew, and his discomfort meant he would avoid her at all costs for the next few weeks. She clasped both hands behind her back and waited. Bruce paused, the necklace halfway to his neck. His eyes narrowed, darkening with some foreign emotion. It took Diana a second to realize he was staring at her unadorned throat. \"And where is your necklace, Princess?\" he asked, voice thick with suspicion. He leveled a cool look at her. \"You're not about to do something stupidly self-sacrificing like giving me the only protection you have against Aphrodite, right?\" Diana sighed, seeing the stubborn glint in his eyes, the tension in his jaw that boded trouble if he disliked her answer. \"Put it on,\" she snapped. When he made no move to follow her orders, she waved an impatient hand at him. \"Yes, it is the only one of its kind, but the necklace only works on mortals. Wearing it around my neck would simply be a fashion statement, not protection.\" When Bruce looked at her, still frowning, she snapped, \"Batman, put it on right now or I swear in the name of Hera that I will put it on you myself!\" Bruce's lips twitched at that, and she could have sworn she heard him mutter something along the lines of, \"Princess, I'd love to see you try.\" Then he shrugged, his mouth softening into what was almost a smile. \"Your wish is my command, Diana,\" he said. He started to place the necklace around his neck, and then his hands stilled once more, arrested in the middle of working the clasp. He shuddered, his broad shoulders jerking like a chill had just gone down his spine. \"Batman,\" Diana began, wondering why he still hesitated. Then she noticed the pallor of his face, the sudden tremor in his hands. \"Batman,\" she said again, her voice rising in concern. She took a step towards him, both hands reaching out, ready to steady him should he start to tumble off the gargoyle's back. \"Diana, I,\" he said, a bewildered note creeping into his voice. He lifted his head, staring at her with an unfocused gaze, his eyes looking through her as though he couldn't see anything clearly. A grimace flitted across his face, half-hidden by the mask. \"I feel--\" He closed his eyes, swayed almost drunkenly. The necklace slipped from his nerveless grasp, dropping to the ground in a quiet chime of metal. \"My--\" One hand rose, reached blindly towards his back, and then dropped back to his side like dead weight. His fingers trembled for an instant as though he were still trying to reach his back, but soon even his hands were still. He fell, and Diana leaped forward to catch him. A grunt escaped her as she took the full weight of him in her arms, rocking back on her heels before she properly braced herself. \"Batman,\" she said, but there was no response except for his quick, uneven breaths, loud in her ear. His head lolled, his cheek feverishly warm against her shoulder. \"Batman,\" she whispered, shifting his weight to one arm and then feeling his back for a wound. It took only a second for her grasping fingers to catch hold of the smooth metal, feel the feathers against her fingertips, the small trickle of hot blood. Despair rose in her then, and she swallowed back the bitter taste of bile and defeat. \"Hera help me,\" she breathed hopelessly. Her hand dropped away from the arrow. Someone laughed behind her. It was a warm, throaty sound that caught hold of Diana and squeezed until Diana thought her heart would burst. Diana did not turn to look, closing her eyes in despair. She did not need to see those eyes that poets always likened to the sea, that reddish blond hair that fell in waves to the goddess's lower back, to know who had done this to him. \"Hera help you? What makes you think Hera cares about your friend, Princess?\" Aphrodite asked, amusement still tingeing her voice. \"He is only a mortal, and the queen of the gods has no time to be concerned with such an insignificant--\" Rage burned as hot as Hephaestus's forge, choking Diana as surely as her despair had. \"Enough,\" Diana snarled, holding Bruce tighter to her chest. \"All would agree that it is unbecoming for a goddess to gloat.\" \"Watch your tone, Amazon, when you speak to a goddess,\" Aphrodite snapped back, tone cold. After a moment, though, cool amusement returned to her voice. \"Besides, you should be thanking me, not scolding me. I have watched you two dance around each other for years now. It was high time for him to put aside all his silly objections and cherish you in a manner befitting royalty.\" She laughed in delight. \"He will worship the ground you walk on, cherish every word that falls from your lips, and obey your every command. It will be wonderful.\" \"You thought I would be pleased by Batman's servility?\" It took everything in her not to laugh mockingly. She struggled to keep her voice even. \"My lady, you do not know me at all.\" Aphrodite tsked. \"You'll change your mind,\" she said confidently. \"Wait until he takes off that mask of his to kneel before you and offer you his heart. You won't be able to resist. It is always so much sweeter when a hard-hearted man like this one finally succumbs to love.\" Diana spoke through gritted teeth, each word sharp and cold enough to shatter diamonds. \"Aphrodite, I swear to Hera that if you do not leave right now, I will attack you where you stand.\" Aphrodite laughed again, still amused. \"Tell me that again in a few weeks, Amazon, once you have seen what my son's arrow does to his temperament. You'll be thanking me and wishing you had never made that fool's errand to my husband's forge.\" At that, Diana forced herself to look over her shoulder and meet Aphrodite's eyes. \"Did Hephaestus tell you of the necklace?\" she asked, not quite believing the god would aid Aphrodite. Aphrodite snorted. \"Please, as though that idiot would ever help me. No, it was quite simple, really. I told Psyche of my plans, pretended that I didn't already know exactly where my foolish son always hides his quiver and bow, and then followed Psyche straight to you. That was quite the touching scene you had on Themyscira, by the way.\" Aphrodite still smiled, but her eyes were as dangerous as the stormiest sea. \"Tell Lysippe to mind her words before I lose my patience.\" \"I will pass along the message the next time I see her,\" Diana said. \"Now go, my lady, and take your son's arrows with you.\" The title nearly strangled her, but somehow it came out only slightly bitter. Aphrodite did not respond, but in the next second she was gone, leaving only the strong smell of brine and roses in the air and Bruce's heavy weight in Diana's arms to show that the goddess had been here at all. Diana looked down at Bruce's masked, slack features, grief tightening her chest. If only she had pressed the necklace upon him more forcefully, told him immediately that only he could be protected by the necklace. If he hadn't hesitated, perhaps.... No, she told herself. This was no time for what-ifs. Aphrodite had been there the entire time. The goddess would have struck him with the arrow no matter when he'd started to put on the necklace. \"I'm so sorry,\" she whispered into his unhearing ear. This close, she could smell the various scents rising off his skin and costume, sweat and deodorant as well as something that she couldn't describe but a strong, earthy scent that was uniquely Bruce. She shifted him in her arms, and frowned. She should get him to the Bat Cave, but how? She had been to the Manor a half-dozen times, but by invitation only. Perhaps she should use Bruce's earpiece and somehow contact Alfred. Someone leapt from the next building over, landing lightly on the other end of the roof. \"Wonder Woman!\" Robin called. The surprise was obvious in his voice, the wariness, less so. \"What are you doing here? Batman didn't say--\" She knew the moment he got close enough to see that Bruce was slumped against her. \"Batman!\" Diana turned her head enough that she could see Robin's costume in the corner of her eye--the bright green, red, and yellow leaped out at her from the darkness. \"Batman has been injured,\" she said. \"We need to get him home.\" \"Right.\" Robin paced forward. \"What happened to him?\" His voice was flat; as he drew closer, she could see the anger already beginning to harden his young features, his eyes narrowing to slits behind his mask. His hands clenched into fists at his sides. \"Batman was struck by one of Eros's arrows,\" Diana explained. At his blank expression, she elaborated. \"One of Eros's arrows makes its victims fall in love with the first person they see--\" She faltered. HadBruce looked clearly at her before he'd lost consciousness? She remembered his unfocused gaze, how he'd closed his eyes before he'd fallen. \"Robin,\" she said, something like hope catching in her throat, \"we must bind Batman's eyes.\" \"Bind his eyes?\" Robin echoed, puzzled. Then he nodded. \"Oh! I get it. If he hasn't looked at anyone yet, the arrow won't work, right?\" \"Precisely,\" Diana said. \"We can keep his eyes covered until I have found a way to reverse the arrow's effect.\" She ignored the quiet voice that sounded like a smug Aphrodite reminding her that there was no known cure. \"Here,\" Robin said, coming up behind her and tying a strip of black fabric around Bruce's eyes with a few quick, efficient movements. \"Part of my training is learning how to fight blindfolded,\" he explained with a slight grin at her curious look. Then his smile faded. \"How are we going to get him back to the Manor?\" \"I can carry him if you will let me into the Bat Cave,\" Diana said. Her gaze fell upon the necklace, half-hidden in the shadows of the gargoyle. \"Pick up the necklace and keep it with you,\" she said. \"Make certain not to lose it.\" Robin shot her a puzzled look even as he obediently picked up the necklace. He stared at the jewelry for a moment, and looked about to say something. Then he wrinkled his nose and muttered something like, \"I don't want to know.\" \"Excuse me?\" Diana asked, but Robin shook his head. \"Let's go,\" he said. Without a backwards glance, he took a running leap off the roof. A second later, a rappel gun fired, and Robin swung back into view, landing heavily on a nearby building and starting to run. Diana draped Bruce over her shoulder, careful not to jostle the arrow still in his back, and launched herself after Robin. \"Your Highness, Master Jason,\" Alfred said. His eyes had widened at the sight of Bruce slung over Diana's shoulder and the arrow sticking out of Bruce's back, but otherwise nothing else had betrayed his surprise and alarm. \"I take it Master Bruce ran afoul of some villain,\" he said. \"We have an infirmary if you will step this way, Your Highness.\" \"Goddess, not villain,\" Diana corrected grimly as she followed after Alfred. \"Aphrodite, to be precise. Do any of the beds have restraints?\" \"Restraints?\" Robin said, voice rising. \"You said that the arrows make people fall in love. Why does Batman need restraints?\" He ripped off his mask, frowning at her. He looked absurdly young without his mask, thin face flushed with anger and windswept hair sticking up every which way. Diana tried to remember how old he was. Not much older than Donna, surely, only twelve or thirteen years old. \"If Batman did look at me after the arrow struck him, he will be out of his mind,\" she said, keeping her voice calm and matter-of-fact. \"If he didn't, he will doubtless try to take off the blindfold before we can explain why he's wearing it.\" \"I don't like it,\" Robin grumbled, hunching his shoulders and scowling. \"Tying Batman to the bed like he's in Arkham, like he's a bad guy--\" \"I do not like the idea any more than you do, Master Jason,\" Alfred said, \"but I believe Master Bruce would prefer temporary restraints over falling prey to the arrow's powers.\" Alfred shot Diana a quick sidelong glance. \"The arrow is one of Eros's, I presume?\" \"Yes,\" Diana said shortly. She laid Bruce down upon one of the beds, careful to keep him in an upright position so as to keep the arrow from going in further. Blood still oozed sluggishly from the wound, although it was hard to tell how much blood Bruce had lost--much of the spilled blood was obscured by his costume. Alfred frowned and removed both the mask and the blindfold, returning the blindfold to Bruce's eyes so swiftly that Diana didn't even have a chance to protest the initial removal. Now that Bruce's face was unmasked, Diana could see how terrible he looked. His face was colorless, copious sweat beaded his hairline, and his expression was tight with pain even while unconscious. Alfred's frown deepened as he pressed his fingers to Bruce's throat, apparently not liking the pace of his heart any better than Diana had. \"This is beyond my expertise. We need Leslie,\" he murmured, almost to himself. Diana wondered who this Leslie was as Alfred stepped away from the bed. \"Master Jason, please assist the princess with the restraints while I get--\" \"Right, right,\" Robin said. The scowl remained on his face even as he set the necklace down on a nearby surface. He began snapping the cuffs over Bruce's wrists and, after a brief hesitation, his ankles. Alfred paused, giving Bruce's unconscious form one last unreadable look before he left at a pace that was nearly a run for the older man. Diana watched him go, trying to keep the sympathy from her expression. Alfred had no doubt grown resigned to Bruce's injuries during battle, but resignation was a far cry from blase acceptance. Robin had just closed the last cuff over Bruce's left ankle and taken a step away from the bed when Bruce groaned and began to stir. \"Bruce?\" Diana said, tightening her grip on his shoulders. \"Bruce--\" Bruce groaned again, a full-body shudder going through him. Then the muscles in his shoulders tightened and he tugged his shoulders from her grasp and sat a little straighter. His arms flexed for a moment before he abandoned the struggle against his restraints. \"Diana?\" he muttered, sounding dazed. She placed a steadying hand to the back of his neck, uncertain whether she should have been pleased or worried when he didn't immediately pull away. His heartbeat was still uneven, she noticed, frowning, his skin clammy against her palm. \"Bruce, do you remember what happened?\" she asked, pitching her voice low and reassuring. \"You were injured by the goddess Aphrodite, and Robin and I brought you to the Manor.\" He turned, grimacing at the movement. \"Diana?\" he asked, in that same groggy whisper. \"Yes, Bruce, I am here,\" Diana said. She tried to tell herself it was only the pain that was making Bruce so docile, that he was in shock from the arrow. That was why he wasn't immediately demanding to know what was going on and who'd had the bright idea to restrain him. She spared a brief glance for Robin, who was watching them with an angry, helpless frown on his face, and then continued slowly, \"Robin is here as well. Alfred has gone to fetch Leslie. Just stay still, please.\" \"Diana,\" Bruce said again, and now the grogginess was fading, replaced by something else, something that made Diana's heart sink to the floor. He turned his face blindly towards her, something going soft and terribly vulnerable in his ashen face. \"I have to tell you,\" he said breathlessly. He struggled against the restraints, his voice rising. \"On the rooftop, I thought how we should--no, I'm saying this all wrong. I realized how foolish I've been. How many years have we wasted because I was a stubborn idiot? I--\" \"Bruce, stop,\" Diana said. Bruce clamped his mouth shut, a muscle jumping briefly in his jaw before he froze on the hospital bed. Only the slight movement of his neck under her hand reassured her that he was even breathing. For a moment Diana stared at him. Then she remembered Aphrodite's words. He will worship the ground you walk on, cherish every word that falls from your lips, and obey your every command. \"Damn,\" she said viciously, and ignored Robin's startled expression. \"What's going on?\" Robin asked. His gaze flicked between them, and then the boy swore quietly under his breath, half-darting a glance at her to see if she'd scold him. He relaxed a little when she said nothing. \"He saw you.\" It wasn't a question. \"Yes,\" Diana said. Then, gentler, she added, \"Bruce, you were struck by one of Eros's arrows. What you're feeling isn't real--\" He laughed at that, half-disbelieving, half-amused. \"Isn't real?\" he said. \"We both know it is. I love--\" \"Don't you darefinish that sentence!\" Diana shouted, hearing the anger and pain in her voice and hating Aphrodite even more for it. She pretended not to notice Robin had suddenly found the floor absolutely fascinating; currently he was looking at anything but her and Bruce. She tried to soften her words even as misery choked her. \"Bruce, if you were in your right mind you wouldn't be talking like this.\" Bruce's throat worked for a moment as though he was swallowing his words. Then he shook his head. \"Diana, don't you see?\" he said earnestly. \"Eros's arrow didn't change my feelings. It just opened my eyes to the truth. God, you don't know what you do to me. Just the moonlight in your hair--\" \"Stop speaking,\" Diana said, and he did. How many times had she imagined the moment when she convinced Bruce to take a chance on their relationship? She'd pictured his slightly rueful smile as he conceded to her wisdom, the way his gaze would warm as he finally let himself look his full of her. Nothing she had envisioned had been like this, Bruce's expression ridiculously besotted, his words so saccharine that any sane, sensible person would choke upon them. Diana leaned forward, pressed her mouth close to Bruce's ear and tried to ignore the way he shuddered a little at her nearness. Perhaps what she was about to do was wrong, forcing her will upon him like this, but she couldn't, wouldn't bear this another moment longer. \"You know what?\" she said in a low voice. \"I don't care if you're secretly a hopeless romantic underneath that stubborn exterior of yours. I don't care if you've secretly been composing poems for me that would have made Sappho weep. I will not hear those words from you while you are under the influence of Eros's arrow, and that is final. Do you understand me?\" \"Diana,\" Bruce said, wretched, like her name hurt to say. \"Answer me.\" \"Yes,\" he hissed through clenched teeth. \"I understand. I won't tell you how I feel.\" \"Good,\" she said. She still had her hand pressed to his neck, she realized. She stepped away, adding, \"Now, stay upright and tell me or Robin if you start feeling faint again. Alfred will be here soon with Leslie. We'll get that arrow out of you.\" \"All right,\" Bruce said tonelessly, all animation draining from his face. When she turned away from the bed, Robin was still studying the floor. \"Will you watch him for me?\" she asked. \"I need....\" She needed to be anywhere but here. No, she needed to fly to Mount Olympus and drag Aphrodite before Zeus and Hera, where she could demand the cure and fix this. She took a deep breath, willing the tightness in her chest away. \"I need to get some air,\" she said at last. \"Just take the stairs. It'll take you to the main hallway,\" Robin said. She was almost to the stairs when his quiet voice stopped her. \"You can fix him, right?\" She turned to look at him. His shoulders were hunched, his eyes hooded as he stared at Bruce. \"Yes,\" she said firmly, and told herself it wasn't a lie. Leslie turned out to be a woman around Alfred's age clothed in a lab coat and wearing a grim expression. Alfred followed her, clutching a large box. Diana met them both at the door, taking the box from Alfred's arms and ignoring his raised eyebrow. \"You must be Ms. Prince,\" Leslie said. She attempted a smile; it died quickly and never reached her worried eyes. \"How's Bruce?\" \"He's awake. At least he was a few minutes ago,\" Diana amended. \"He is under the influence of Eros's arrow, so it's difficult to tell how much of his current state is from blood loss and how much is from the arrow.\" \"Yes, Alfred mentioned the arrow. Besides it inducing love, is there anything else I should know about it?\" Leslie asked. \"It won't dissolve once I begin to remove it, for example.\" \"I--\" Diana blinked. She thought hard, but she didn't remember any of the sort mentioned in the stories her mother had told her. \"I don't know. I don't believe it does. I think my mother mentioned that the wound will close up once you remove the arrow, but I'm not certain.\" \"That's something, at least,\" Leslie said. The woman started to step into the Manor and then paused, peering at Diana. \"Alfred, would you go and get some food for Ms. Prince while I tend to Bruce?\" \"I'm fine,\" Diana said automatically. Leslie offered her a polite smile that said clearly she didn't believe a word of it. \"When was the last time you ate, dear?\" she asked. \"I--\" Diana's throat was dry, and it took a moment to get the words out. \"I am an Amazon. I don't need as much food or sleep as mortals.\" \"I'll be in the kitchen,\" Alfred murmured as though he'd misheard and thought that Diana had announced that she was starving. When she opened her mouth to protest, he added mildly, \"No doubt Master Jason is hungry as well.\" \"I remember Bruce when he was twelve,\" Leslie said. \"Boys at that age are alwayshungry.\" Her tone was so much like Bruce at his driest that Diana found herself staring. Had Bruce gotten his sense of humor from this woman? \"I will prepare some sandwiches,\" Alfred said. \"Do you have a particular preference, Your Highness?\" Diana closed her mouth, defeated, and shook her head before she followed Leslie into the Manor. \"I'll need your assistance with Bruce,\" Leslie said over her shoulder. \"I'll help in any way I can, but I'm afraid that I don't have much medical knowledge. There aren't many injuries on Themyscira,\" Diana said with a frown. She'd learned first-aid within a few weeks of joining the Justice League, after Wally had been injured and she'd stood there, useless, while Bruce tended to his wounds, but she doubted her first-aid knowledge would be at all helpful. \"I'll need you to hold him steady while I work,\" Leslie explained. \"I have to do some scans first, look for any possible damage in case the wound doesn't heal as you said, but I want that arrow out as soon as possible.\" \"I can do that,\" Diana said. Robin looked relieved to see them. \"He hasn't said anything since you told him to, uh, stop talking,\" he said to Diana and then grinned hopefully at Leslie. \"Gonna get the arrow out of him?\" \"That is the plan,\" Leslie said with a small smile, and then tugged the box away from Diana. She opened it, pulling out a few medical-looking items. She fussed over Bruce, who continued to look blank and barely acknowledged Leslie. He answered her questions in a quiet monotone and didn't even flinch when Leslie carefully cut the bloodstained cloak and costume away from the wound. After a few minutes of this, Leslie looked up. \"He has lost quite a bit of blood. Jason, do you know how to prepare a blood infusion?\" Robin nodded, looking almost relieved at having something to do. \"I'll go get it ready,\" he said, and vanished further into the infirmary. \"Bruce thought it prudent to keep a stock of blood around, considering his nightly activities,\" Leslie explained. Her hands hovered by Bruce's head, and she glanced at Diana. \"Is it all right to remove the blindfold?\" \"Go ahead,\" Diana said bleakly. What did it matter now? She wasn't surprised that Bruce looked towards her as soon as the blindfold was gone. He opened his mouth to speak, and then frowned and said nothing, staring at her in mute appeal. She could only meet his eyes for a few seconds, lowering her gaze to the arrow embedded in Bruce's back. Once Leslie had viewed the scans and Bruce had fresh blood going into one arm and an IV going into the other, as well as the man being hooked to several machines meant to monitor his blood pressure and heartbeat, Leslie washed her hands and snapped on a pair of gloves. \"I'll be putting him under anesthesia--his body's already had quite a shock, and removing the arrow will be still another one,\" she explained. \"I just need you to hold him steady once I begin the removal. Jason will be monitoring Bruce's vitals.\" The surgery went slowly, or perhaps it only seemed slow to Diana as Leslie bent over the wound and carefully removed the arrow. There was a fresh trickle of blood when the arrow came free, but then the wound closed up as Diana had predicted. \"Thank goodness,\" Leslie murmured under her breath, but her hands didn't falter as she set the arrow aside and began to wash the remnants of blood from Bruce's back. \"I'm going to do a few more scans, of course, but if the wound has healed on its own, he should be fine once he's recovered from the shock and blood loss.\" \"I'll tell Alfred,\" Robin said, and walked quickly to the stairs. As soon as he reached the stairs, however, he broke into a run, yelling, \"Alfred! He should be okay!\" Leslie smiled faintly at his enthusiasm, and then turned to Diana. \"I can handle the rest. Besides, Bruce won't wake from the anesthesia for another half-hour or so. Go upstairs, get something to eat. I'll call for you if I need you.\" \"All right,\" Diana agreed. Upon entering the main part of the Manor, however, she turned right instead of left and headed to the nearest bathroom. There, she stared at her wan, weary reflection. After a moment, she tugged her tiara from her head. She pressed her thumb firmly against the point of the star until a dull pain blossomed. The blood dripped sluggishly and almost reluctantly from the wound. It would only be a moment before the wound healed, she knew, and so she quickly pressed her thumb to the mirror, drawing the ancient signal of Hera's priestess. A moment later, the mirror shivered green and her mother's face appeared. \"Diana?\" she said in surprise, and then her eyes narrowed and her expression tightened. \"I take it you are not calling upon me with good news.\" \"Aphrodite has used one of Eros's arrows upon Batman,\" Diana said. To her embarrassment, her eyes pricked with tears and her mother's face blurred. \"Mother, tell me you know of a way to reverse the arrow's effects. Please.\" \"I do not,\" her mother said gently. \"Mother, he is mindless with infatuation. I could order him to kill himself, and I believe he would do so,\" Diana said, even more mortified to hear her voice shake. \"Neither of us can live like this. There must be something--\" \"Beseech the gods,\" her mother said. \"Batman is a mortal, true, but an important one. Go to Mount Olympus, tell Zeus how Aphrodite's amusement has robbed Man's World of one of its strongest defenders. Aphrodite will be furious, true, but you may sway Zeus to your cause.\" \"And if he is not swayed?\" Diana almost asked, but they both knew the answer to that. She smiled weakly, trying to look confident. \"Thank you, Mother.\" Her mother's expression was grave. \"Be careful, my moon and stars,\" she said. She hesitated, and then her expression smoothed into an unreadable one. \"Good luck,\" she said, softer. Then mirror flared green once more, and her mother was gone. Diana replaced her tiara and went into the kitchen, where Robin was wolfing down a sandwich in one hand, his free hand already reaching for another sandwich. Alfred was watching him with a slight crease at the corners of his mouth that suggested an inward smile. He inclined his head towards Diana as she entered. \"Your Highness. I hope you like ham sandwiches. I am afraid Master Jason has eaten all of the turkey ones I prepared.\" \"Sorry,\" Robin said through a mouthful of food, not sounding all that apologetic. Diana took a sandwich and began to eat. It tasted of ashes in her mouth, and she swallowed with difficulty. \"I am going to Mount Olympus,\" she said after forcing down another bite. Alfred did not look surprised, but Robin paused and stared at her. \"Wait, Mount Olympus? Like, the place where the gods live?\" he asked in disbelief. \"Can normal people even go there?\" \"I am not entirely mortal,\" Diana explained. \"I won't be able to stay there for very long, but I can entreat Zeus to restore Bruce to his normal self.\" She took another bite. \"Zeus can do that?\" Robin grinned. \"I guess being the king of the gods means you can do what you want.\" \"You'll need to have someone oversee Gotham's protection,\" Diana said. \"Time is odd around the gods--I may be back in a day, I may be back in a week.\" \"I can--\" Robin began, looking indignant, but Alfred was already nodding. \"Master Dick is busy in Bludhaven, but I will contact....\" He hesitated, and said, almost awkwardly, as though the name felt odd to say, \"Oracle. She'll be able to recommend someone to help Master Jason.\" \"Oh,\" Robin said, deflating a little. \"Yeah, bet you Barb--Oracle--could probably get Huntress to come here. Batman doesn't mind her too much.\" He shot a quick look at Diana, but she assumed a bland expression. Bruce had introduced her to Alfred, Nightwing, and Robin, but she would not press if there were others in Gotham yet to be introduced. \"If Bruce trusts this Oracle, so do I,\" she said, and took another grudging nibble of her sandwich. \"And I have met Huntress.\" She didn't bother mentioning that Huntress was no longer a member of the Justice League; doubtless, that had been a point in her favor in Bruce's eyes. \"I will contact her in the morning,\" Alfred said mildly, and set a glass of water next to Diana's elbow. \"I am going to check on Leslie and Master Bruce.\" Diana and Robin ate in silence, until Robin finished the last sandwich and leaned back in his chair. He kicked the table idly and said, \"So, uh. I won't tell anyone 'bout what Batman said.\" His ears were a little pink. \"Thank you,\" Diana said gravely, resisting the urge to smile. \"Yeah, well, Batman would kill me if I told anyone about him being mushy,\" Robin said. He wrinkled his nose. \"Plus, I figure Eros's arrow counts as mind control. No teasing people about stuff they say under mind control. Rule number twenty.\" Diana paused, her half-finished sandwich halfway to her mouth. \"Please tell me Bruce doesn't have an actual list of rules about being a super-hero,\" she said. Robin grinned widely. \"I would, but rule number three is no lying to Justice League members,\" he said, adopting a solemn tone. He laughed when Diana pursed her lips. Diana forced down the rest of the sandwich, and then two more. She might not be hungry, but she would need all her energy to reach Mount Olympus and beseech Zeus. She glanced up at the clock. Bruce would be waking soon. She rose to her feet. \"Good luck,\" Robin said. \"Thank you,\" Diana said. She hesitated, wondering if she should say more, promise him that everything would be fine. He made a face like he knew what she was thinking. \"Just go and get Zeus to make Batman normal again, okay? Please?\" \"Goodbye, Robin,\" Diana said. \"Tell Alfred thank you for the sandwiches.\" \"Will do,\" Robin said, slouching in his chair. It was impossible to describe Mount Olympus, the overwhelming grandeur, the sense of timelessness. Even as she stood before the gates and knocked, Diana felt a little dizzy. The gates swung open, and she stepped inside, feeling rather like she was wading through water. Overwhelming power pressed in on her from all sides. \"What's an Amazon doing on Mount Olympus?\" a cheerful voice asked. \"You have crossed into dangerous territory, Princess Diana.\" Diana turned her head with effort. When she saw the traveler's robes and wide-brimmed hat the god wore, she managed a brief smile. \"Feigning ignorance does not become you, Lord Hermes,\" she said. \"You must know what Aphrodite has done.\" \"Yes, I might have heard something about an incident involving one of Eros's arrows and a certain mortal,\" Hermes admitted. He stepped closer, and extended an arm to her. \"Eros was not pleased by his mother's theft of his quiver and arrows. You are going to beseech Zeus, I take it?\" \"That is my plan,\" Diana admitted, accepting his arm. Instantly it was much easier to move. She fought the urge to lean against him and catch her breath. Hermes might have been one of the kinder gods, but even he had his limits. \"Do you think he will hear my appeal?\" Hermes frowned. \"Zeus is not in the best of moods,\" he admitted. \"He and Hera have been arguing over whether or not we should return to the mortal world. He is for going back to the mortal world, and Hera is against it.\" Diana's heart sank. \"So if I ask him to help Batman, I will be asking him to--\" \"Admit he's wrong,\" Hermes said with a sympathetic grimace. \"He'll certainly see it that way, I'm afraid.\" He lowered his voice, adding thoughtfully, \"Of course, if you phrased it differently, perhaps he could be persuaded to fix your mortal.\" \"Thank you, Lord Hermes,\" Diana said. She caught her breath at the sight of Zeus's palace, glittering gold brightly enough to make her eyes water, but Hermes didn't bat an eye as he ushered her inside. \"You have been extremely helpful.\" Unusually so, she thought. Hermes was no enemy of the Amazons, but no ally, either; Iris had always brought any message from the gods to Themyscira. She eyed him curiously. He caught the look and laughed. \"Don't look so puzzled, Princess Diana. You are a traveler, are you not? I protect all and any wayfarers.\" Some of the amusement left his face. \"Besides, Eros asked a boon of me. He and Psyche are furious at Aphrodite's trickery, and asked me to aid you any way I can.\" This close, she could see reflections of Eros in Hermes's features (or rather, the features that Hermes had passed along to his son) --the pale reddish-blond hue of his hair, the thick curls that tumbled in front of his eyes, the determined jut of his jaw. \"Thank you, my lord,\" Diana said. \"Here is the throne room,\" Hermes said, coming to a stop before a huge door. \"Whatever Zeus decides, I will be out here to escort you from Olympus.\" Diana inclined her head. She stood there for a moment, gathering her thoughts and weighing her options. Then she pushed open the door and stepped inside. Zeus was alone, seated upon his throne and sipping a goblet of nectar. Diana fought back the relief that welled within her. This would be easier without an audience. She knelt before him, pressed her forehead to the cold floor. \"Your Majesty,\" she said. The awe in her voice was not feigned; Zeus radiated power so that it hurt to look at him. Little sparks of lightning flared and died around him, filling the air with electricity and making it hard to breathe. \"So, Hipployta's daughter has come to see me,\" Zeus said. If Hephaestus's voice had rattled her bones, Zeus's made her head ache, the booming words like the warning rumble of thunder before a storm. He let out a brief shout of laughter that made her teeth click together. \"Are you lost or blind, girl? Hera is not here.\" \"It is not Hera's aid I need, my king,\" Diana said. \"It is yours.\" \"Rise,\" Zeus commanded. She obeyed, keeping her gaze focused on his thick beard instead of his face. \"And what is it you want of me?\" \"I beg you to right a wrong, Your Majesty,\" Diana said. \"If this is about Aphrodite's trick with the arrow, I remind you that you are asking me to intrude upon Aphrodite's domain,\" Zeus said. She could feel his gaze upon her face, hear the frown in his voice though she still didn't dare to meet his eyes. \"Tread carefully, girl.\" Diana took a deep breath. \"Your Majesty, you best of all the gods know of the thrill of a conquest, the satisfaction you feel when you have coaxed someone into bed and won their heart,\" she said. \"Aphrodite has robbed me of this pleasure.\" Zeus was silent for a moment, and she found herself praying--to whom, she wasn't entirely certain, while she stood in Zeus's throne room, but praying, Please, please, let this sway Zeus. Then he stood. His hand rested, heavy, on her shoulder. She nearly buckled under the weight of it. \"Princess Diana of the Amazons, I understand your difficulty,\" he said. \"I remember well when Eros's arrows have been used against me.\" \"Then you will help me, Your Majesty?\" Diana said, hope fluttering in her chest. \"Athena has crafted a potion that she believes will bring your mortal back to his senses. She awaits only my agreement to make the potion itself. Go to her, and tell her you have my blessing to gather the ingredients.\" He frowned. \"However, you must not tell Hera that I have helped you. She would consider this meddling with the mortal world.\" \"I will not tell her, Your Majesty,\" Diana promised, fighting the giddy smile that wanted to curve her lips. \"Thank you, Your Majesty. I will not forget this kindness.\" She thought Zeus smiled, though it was half-hidden by his thick beard. \"Here is one ingredient I know you will need,\" he said, and drew a small vial from his robes. \"It is a crushed acorn from one of my oaks.\" She cradled the vial in her hands, willing her hands not to tremble. It was warm to the touch, not hot enough to burn, but warm enough that her skin prickled from the heat. \"Thank you, Your Majesty.\" \"Go,\" Zeus said, and she fled before he could change his mind. Outside, Hermes glanced at her from where he was leaning against the wall. Diana suspected him of eavesdropping, but said nothing as the god arched an eyebrow. \"I take it your conversation went well,\" he said. He tipped his hat back, eyeing the vial curiously. \"Yes. Athena created a potion that will cure Batman,\" Diana said. \"Now I must go to her, learn what other ingredients I need.\" \"I'll come along,\" Hermes said. He stepped away from the wall, extending his arm once more to her. \"Olympus doesn't welcome those touched with mortality, even stubborn Amazon princesses.\" Diana switched the vial over to one hand, fingers closing carefully around the glass, and then accepted the god's arm. \"I would be grateful for your assistance, Lord Hermes.\" Athena lived in her own small palace, one that looked more like a library. It smelled of one as well, rich with the scents of dust and ink and parchment and the overall sense of age and knowledge. Diana breathed in deeply, feeling some of the tension in her ease. Athena's potion would work, she knew. Diana simply had to gather the ingredients. \"Lady Athena,\" she called as she and Hermes stepped further into the main foyer. \"We would speak with you.\" \"Come for the list of ingredients, Diana of Themyscira?\" When Diana turned, she found herself meeting pale gray eyes that gleamed with intelligence. \"Yes, Lady Athena,\" she said, inclining her head, for that sharp, assessing gaze could belong to no other goddess. \"Lord Zeus gives his blessing for me to gather the ingredients.\" \"I wondered if you would convince him,\" Athena said. A small, pleased smile flickered briefly upon her stern features before she looked grave once more. \"I have the list, but I would speak to you first before you begin your quest, child.\" Diana fought to keep her surprise off her face. Every inch of her ached to be off gathering the ingredients and restoring Bruce to his normal self. She inclined her head once more as Hermes stepped away, presumably to give them some privacy. \"I am not aware of time being of the essence to cure Batman, my lady, but I admit I would prefer to begin my quest soon,\" she said as politely as she could manage. Impatience burned in the back of her throat, tightened the muscles in her shoulders once more. \"Is the conversation so important that it cannot wait until I've gathered the ingredients?\" Athena looked at her for a long moment, and Diana inwardly winced at disapproval darkening the goddess's eyes. \"It is about the ingredients,\" Athena said at last. \"I cannot in good conscience send you on this quest without warning you of the dangers.\" \"There are always dangers on a quest,\" Diana pointed out. \"It would hardly be a proper quest without possible injury.\" Athena plucked a scroll from a nearby table and handed it to her. \"Read the list of ingredients,\" she commanded. Diana obediently held up the scroll and began to read. After the second item, she could feel the color begin to drain from her face. By the time she reached the final ingredient, it was all she could do not to curse. She took a deep breath and lowered the scroll. \"Forgive my rudeness, my lady,\" she said. \"It would have been foolish of me to start my quest without knowing the difficulty.\" \"So you still plan to accept the quest?\" Athena asked, tilting her head to the side and fixing her with a curious look. \"Despite knowing the dangers?\" This time Diana didn't bother to hide her surprise. Had Athena thought she would take one look at the list and give up? \"Of course, my lady. It will be perilous, but I cannot....\" She faltered for a moment, her throat tightening as she thought of Bruce's besotted tone, the mindless way he had looked at her. \"I cannot bear what has been done to Batman.\" \"Very well, \"Athena said. Her expression was impossible to read, but Diana thought she saw regret in those grave features. Was Athena so certain that Diana would fail? Diana felt cold, suddenly, goose bumps rising on her bare arms. \"What are the ingredients?\" Hermes asked. He took the scroll from Diana's unresisting hands. As he read the list, his brow furrowed and his eyes narrowed. He looked sharply at Athena. \"Cousin, you cannot be serious. The princess has to ask a boon of each of the twelve? How will she survive?\" \"I will have to, that's all,\" Diana said. Hermes shook the scroll at her, face flushing with anger. \"You have to go to the Underworld and ask for a gift from Hades!\" he shouted. \"Did you forget that he wishes you dead? If you set foot in his realm, you will not return!\" Diana shook her head, determination replacing her earlier dismay. \"That will be the most difficult ingredient, true, but the others will not be half so dangerous. I will succeed. There is no other option.\" \"Other than defeat, you mean,\" Hermes said, still scowling. He turned the frown upon Athena. \"Surely there must be an easier way.\" She met his gaze coolly. \"You know as well as I do, cousin, there is not.\" As Hermes sputtered and waved the scroll around, Athena turned back towards Diana. \"I can help a little. I have already approached Hera and gotten her ingredient for you.\" Hermes held the scroll up. \"Oh, wonderful,\" he said in a loud, sarcastic voice. \"That will make things easier. So we've already got four of the twelve ingredients--Eros's arrow, Zeus's acorn, Hera's pomegranate juice, and your olives, cousin. That means we just need, oh, let's see, the chalice Hephaestus must create, the words I must give him to inscribe upon the chalice, Demeter's grain, Poseidon's salt water, Dionysus's wine--\" \"If you are going to throw a temper tantrum, cousin, you may step outside,\" Athena said mildly. \"You are not helping the princess with your antics.\" As Hermes tossed the scroll at Diana and then stomped out of the palace, grumbling under his breath, the goddess turned to another table and picked up a thin case and shoulder strap made of warm golden leather. \"Remember this, child,\" Athena said, opening up the case to reveal a space for eight vials of varying sizes. \"You must gather all the ingredients and follow the instructions exactly.\" \"Yes, my lady,\" Diana said, staring almost greedily at the two vials already enclosed. \"Read the list to me, let me know that you understand what you must do,\" Athena said. Diana handed her the vial containing Zeus's acorn to be stored safely in the case, and then cleared her throat and began to read. \"First, keep Eros's arrow. This will be Aphrodite's gift, albeit given unknowingly. Then you must gather eight ingredients from the gods, listed here, and request certain boons from the other four gods. The eight ingredients are these: a crushed acorn from one of Zeus's sacred oaks, two crushed olives from one of Athena's olive trees, the poison from one of Ares's sacred snakes, a vial of water from one of Poseidon's salt springs, the juice of a pomegranate given willingly by Hera, a vial of grain from Demeter's horn of plenty, a vial of wine from Dionysus, a white Asphodel flower from Hades's Asphodel Fields. As for the other four gods, first you must get words of power from Hermes that must be inscribed upon a chalice. Then you must give Hephaestus the words and have him make a chalice for this express purpose. Once you have gathered the eight ingredients, you must take them and the chalice to Hestia, who will blend the ingredients in the chalice and bless them. After that, the chalice and its contents must be first heated by a ride on Apollo's chariot, and finally cooled by Artemis in the moonlight. Then and only then may you dip the arrow into the potion. If you strike your mortal with this potion-enriched arrow, he will be freed from the spell.\" Diana stopped, taking a deep breath. It was not as daunting as it sounded, she told herself. She already had three of the ingredients, Hermes would gladly give her the necessary words, and she knew most of the gods and goddesses would aid her. Only Ares, Dionysus, and Hades seemed dangerous--Ares for his love of Aphrodite, Dionysus for his unpredictability, and Hades for his hatred of her and her mother. A cool hand pressed against her cheek. She opened her eyes to meet Athena's steady gaze. \"Heed my advice, child, if you insist upon this quest. Put off Ares and Hades as the last two to visit. Ares is likely to tell Aphrodite of your plan, despite his admiration for Amazons.\" \"I was planning on saving those two for last,\" Diana admitted. She tried to smile. \"Thank you for your aid, my lady. You have done much for me and Batman.\" \"Yes,\" Athena said, and stepped back. That earlier regret darkened her eyes and sharpened her words. \"I only hope I have not aided you swiftly to your death.\" Hermes seemed a little more composed when Diana left the palace, the case a reassuring weight on her back. \"Well, I thought we should go to Hephaestus first,\" he said before she could speak. \"Who knows how long my cousin will take to make the chalice. We might have all the ingredients before he's finished.\" \"Let us hope we are so swift,\" Diana said. \"Should I ask Lady Athena for a piece of parchment so you can write the words down?\" Hermes laughed. \"Not unless you like the smell of smoke,\" he said dryly. \"The words Hephaestus will need to engrave upon the chalice are not meant for parchment or mortals' ears. I will speak them to Hephaestus myself.\" \"Very well,\" Diana said. \"Let us go.\" Impatience forced her to push against the pressure and fly rather than walk towards Olympus's gates. She found herself breathing easier the instant they passed through the open exit. Perhaps some of her relief showed on her face, for Hermes shot her a concerned look. \"If you need to rest--\" he began, and stopped at the sharp shake of her head. \"I am fine. Just relieved to be on our way to Hephaestus's home,\" she said, and ignored the new look that crossed Hermes's face, a half-amused, half-exasperated look that she would try to lie to a god who was known for his trickery. \"You need not worry too much about Hephaestus,\" Hermes said. \"He bears no love for his wife, and besides, he has never been one to resist a challenge. It was Hephaestus who designed Eros's bow, you know, and Apollo's chariot, as well as many other useful items. He will make your chalice if you ask.\" \"I had known of Apollo's chariot, but not that he crafted Eros's bow,\" Diana said, surprised. She shook her head. \"I do not know why I am surprised. The bow is so powerful, who else could have made it? Neither Eros nor Aphrodite have any skill with the making of things.\" \"No,\" Hermes said after a moment. She glanced at him again, to see him looking almost rueful. \"They do not.\" Then he extended his hand. \"Come, Princess Diana. You are a swift flyer, but my sandals will take us there even faster.\" \"Thank you,\" Diana said gratefully, and took his warm, callused hand in hers. She would have to thank Eros and Psyche for asking Hermes's aid, she thought as she closed her eyes against the sudden wind whipping at her face, slapping her cheeks like blows. They were silent the rest of the journey, the only sound the wind rushing in Diana's ears. When they landed on the tip of Hephaestus's volcano, the rocks crunching beneath their feet, Hermes released her hand and said, \"Before we enter, there is one thing I should mention.\" She couldn't decipher his tone. When she looked at him, the god looked almost sheepish, shuffling his sandaled feet and kicking up a bit of ash. \"What is it, my lord?\" she asked. \"The last time I was here, Hephaestus and I did not part on the best of terms,\" Hermes explained, not quite meeting her eyes. She recognized the look now--it was similar to the one Wally wore when one of his jokes had not gone over well and he was trying to figure out a way to soothe the person's ire. \"My lord, what--\" she began, frustration tingeing her voice, and then stopped as the volcano suddenly shuddered beneath them. \"HERMES!\" a voice roared, loudly enough that Diana's heart leapt into her throat. She had to take a step back to steady herself. \"Hephaestus!\" Hermes called back, his too-cheerful voice slightly strained as his gaze darted around the top of the volcano. \"It has been a while, cousin! I have brought Princess Diana here to, ah--\" Hephaestus was nowhere to be seen, but somehow his voice rumbled in Diana's ears, making her head buzz with the sound. \"You stole my chariot, Hermes,\" the god snarled. \"Do you know how long that chariot took to build?\" \"You are the craftsman of the gods, Hephaestus, I would have thought it'd take you no time at all,\" Hermes called, still attempting jollity. Both he and Diana winced at Hephaestus's enraged growl. Diana cleared her throat. \"Lord Hephaestus, I am sorry that I brought Lord Hermes here. Had I known that he'd committed such an affront to you, I would not have brought him anywhere near your domain,\" she said. Hermes frowned and opened his mouth to protest, expression clearly meant to remind her he had to be here to provide the words of power, but she quelled him with a sharp look. \"However, my need is urgent. Aphrodite managed to use one of Eros's arrows upon my mortal friend before he could don the necklace.\" There was a pause, and when Hephaestus spoke again, his voice was quieter and almost sympathetic. \"I am sorry to hear that, little Amazon, but I do not see how I can help you. I cannot sway Aphrodite to take mercy, and I work with metal, not with broken hearts.\" \"Lady Athena has discovered a way to cure my mortal friend,\" Diana said quickly. \"Part of the cure is a chalice inscribed with certain words of power.\" \"And you need me to make that chalice,\" Hephaestus said slowly. \"Yes, my lord, and Hermes can give you the necessary words,\" Diana said, and held her breath. \"I will not have Hermes in my domain a moment longer,\" Hephaestus snapped. \"He will steal something else as soon as you or I look away. It's in his nature. He won't be able to help himself.\" \"That's true,\" Hermes agreed with a small grin. He shrugged at Diana's frown. \"What? Hephaestus speaks honestly.\" \"Then Lord Hermes will not stay in your domain, my lord,\" Diana said, thinking quickly. \"He can shout the words to you, and I will return alone to retrieve the chalice once you have finished.\" \"Very well,\" Hephaestus growled. \"But, princess, do not think I will treat you so kindly the next time you come asking a boon of me. I do this to spite Aphrodite, not to aid you. If you ever ask me for something else, you will have to pay a price. And gifts from the gods do not come cheap.\" Diana bowed her head although Hephaestus couldn't see her. \"I understand, my lord. I will do my best not to trouble you again.\" \"Well, Hermes?\" Hephaestus said impatiently. \"Speak the words and go!\" \"Oh, ah yes,\" Hermes said. He smiled quickly at Diana. \"You might want to cover your ears,\" he advised her. Diana obeyed, frowning in confusion. A second later, she understood. Even with her hands pressed against her ears, the words Hermes shouted went through her like a combined lightning bolt and thunderclap. Her knees threatened to buckle, and it was all she could to lock her knees and grit her teeth. When she finally pulled her hands away from her ringing ears, Hermes grimaced. \"Sorry, I forgot what an effect words of power have,\" he said. \"Let me know when your head is clear, and we will go.\" \"I am fine,\" she insisted, and then raised her voice. \"Thank you, my lord. I will return, alone, once I have gathered the necessary ingredients.\" Hephaestus didn't answer, save for the slight twitch of the volcano beneath their feet, as though the very ground wanted to knock Hermes off its surface and away from the immortal blacksmith's domain. \"Come, princess, let us go,\" Hermes said with an uneasy look. They flew for a few minutes before Diana asked, \"Before we continue, my lord, I need to know something.\" \"Yes?\" Hermes asked, nudging his hat further up his forehead so he could shoot her an unencumbered, curious look. Diana licked her dry lips, well aware that she was treading dangerous waters. Hermes was here to help her, but his promise to Eros only stretched so far as his patience. She spoke slowly, without inflection, \"Will any of the other gods and goddesses have reason to decry your presence in their domains?\" Much to her relief, Hermes laughed. \"No,\" he said. \"Ares is not fond of me, but then, Ares is not fond of anyone save for perhaps Aphrodite and you Amazonian warriors, and even he and Aphrodite are on the outs every other century or so.\" \"That is good to hear, my lord,\" Diana said, and tried to believe him. Demeter's abode was far simpler than the other gods on Mount Olympus, almost rustic. It was instead her gardens that were elaborate, ripe fig trees and golden wheat swaying in a wind that brought all sorts of pleasing smells to Diana's nose. She breathed in deeply. The pressure of Mount Olympus still pushed against her, but somehow it was easier to be back in the gods' domain with the scent of rich earth surrounding her. \"My lady?\" she called, coming to a stop under a fig tree and glancing around. \"Hera told me that I might have unexpected company,\" Demeter said, stepping out of the wheat field, the golden wheat parting before her and snapping back into place as though the goddess had never walked there. The goddess was handsome rather beautiful, her sun-reddened features exuding warmth and welcome as she smiled. When she clasped Diana's hand in greeting, black dirt was caught under her fingernails. \"So you are the Amazon all of Olympus is gossiping about,\" Demeter added. \"Aphrodite believes that Zeus rebuked you for your forwardness and sent you on your way, in case you were curious.\" The goddess laughed; a low, throaty sound of amusement. \"I overheard Algaia scolding Aphrodite quite fiercely over the issue.\" \"I am honored to meet you, Lady Demeter. Forgive me, but did you say someone was scolding Aphrodite?\" Diana echoed, fighting back a frown. \"I do not recognize the name of that goddess. Who is this Algaia?\" Demeter waved a hand dismissively. \"She's the youngest of the Graces. An outspoken girl, one who makes her opinions on Aphrodite's affair with Ares quite plain, although Aphrodite does not heed her.\" Her smile sharpened a little, turned speculative. \"You might like her, actually.\" \"I see,\" Diana said, although she didn't. How did Algaia get away with rebuking Aphrodite without fear of retribution? She set aside her confusion to ask, \"So Aphrodite thinks I am searching in the mortal realm for some other way to reverse the arrow's effects?\" Demeter shrugged, a slow, elegant movement. \"As far as I know. Now, what was it that you needed again? A piece of fruit? Something from my gardens, I know, although Hera was vague on the details.\" \"Some grain from your horn of plenty, my lady,\" Diana said, extending an empty vial to her. \"I thank you for your kindness. I will offer a sacrifice to you on Themyscira upon my next visit.\" \"A sacrifice,\" Demeter sighed, accepting the vial. Wistfulness colored her voice. \"We still receive the occasional sacrifice from a mortal believer, of course, but it is nothing like it was in the old days. A sacrifice would be most appreciated, child.\" She paused, a shadow creeping into her smile and darkening her eyes. \"Though you must offer a sacrifice on my daughter's behalf as well.\" Something twisted in Diana's chest at the fierce longing obvious in Demeter's face. \"You have my word that I will offer one for Lady Persephone, my lady,\" she promised. Then she hesitated, glancing at Hermes, who seemed oddly subdued in Demeter's presence. Lowering her voice though there was no one else around to hear, she asked, \"I travel to the Underworld soon. Do you have a message to give to your daughter?\" \"Princess--\" Hermes began, frowning, but Demeter's smile lit up her face and made her seem almost of an age as Psyche. \"You are a thoughtful child,\" she said. \"Tell Persephone that I love her and wait impatiently for when she can return to me.\" \"I will,\" Diana promised. She hadn't seen the goddess use her horn of plenty, but when Demeter handed the vial back to her, it was warm, as though the sun had touched it, and filled with golden grain. \"Thank you, my lady,\" she said with a dip of her chin. Some more of her earlier tension was easing with each passing moment. She was already almost halfway done with her quest, and so far the worst thing that had occurred was Hephaestus roaring at Hermes. True, the hardest parts came later, but at least the quest had begun well. \"Is there anything else you need, my lady?\" she added, tucking the vial into the case. \"A very generous child indeed,\" said Demeter, sounding amused. \"Go and complete your quest, princess. And try not to tarry in the Underworld too long. While my daughter will appreciate the company, I do not think Hades will.\" \"No,\" Diana agreed with a quick smile, \"he will not. Thank you again, my lady.\" \"She would have given you the grains in exchange for the sacrifice alone,\" Hermes said as soon as they were outside Olympus's gates once more--Poseidon did not often venture from his kingdom beneath the sea any longer. \"Why did you offer to bring a message to Persephone? You gave two gifts for the price of one.\" Diana glanced at Hermes, taking note of the honest confusion in his face. Had he not noticed Demeter's grief, as strong as Lysippe's loss despite the millennia and more since Hades had stolen her daughter away? \"Were I Persephone and my mother Demeter, I would ask of the few travelers who pass through Hades' halls for word from my mother,\" she said simply. \"How could I not offer to bring Persephone a message?\" \"How could you not?\" Hermes mumbled. He shook his head. \"That's all well and good, Princess Diana. I only hope you have not brought more trouble upon our heads.\" \"Do not tell me the messenger of the gods does not want to carry a message,\" Diana said, torn between amusement and exasperation. Surely passing along the message would do them no harm. Hermes grimaced, but subsided, putting on speed and turning towards Euboia. They had just reached the island itself and were flying over it when Hermes said abruptly, \"It seems we have company, Princess Diana.\" \"Company?\" Diana asked. Then she heard it, the loud whine of a plane speeding their way. She turned, narrowing her eyes, and caught sight of a familiar black jet. \"Bruce,\" she hissed, then remembered herself. She glanced sharply at Hermes, but he seemed oblivious. \"It's heading right towards us,\" he observed, tilting his head and frowning. \"We should get out of its way.\" \"It won't hit us,\" Diana said, adjusting her route and coming to a stop a few feet above the ocean. \"That's Batman's plane.\" She folded her arms against her chest and glared at the plane. \"Hopefully it is not Batman himself, since he should be strapped to his bed in Gotham.\" Hermes grinned crookedly. \"From what I have heard of your Batman, that means nothing.\" He watched the plane with growing interest. \"I suppose he should be accompanying you on this quest. You are doing this for his benefit, after all.\" Diana snorted, unamused. \"He will be no use to me in his state,\" she said. \"And I would prefer him in Gotham, away from the dangers. No offense, my lord, but mortals rarely fare well in interactions with the gods.\" \"True enough,\" Hermes said with a downward twist of his lips. \"Though Gotham has dangers of its own, I am told.\" Diana frowned, disquiet making her stomach clench. She thought of the Joker, of Two-Face, of all the villains who wanted Bruce dead, who would certainly take advantage of Bruce's situation. \"It does,\" she said, disquiet making the agreement come out hard and harsh. The jet landed lightly on the ocean's surface, churning water as the plane shifted into something that could actually float. As soon as the windshield of the plane had opened and a familiar costumed figure stood upon the nose of the jet, Diana flew closer. \"What are you doing here?\" she demanded, positioning herself so that they were face-to-face. She was close enough to see the sweat beading the line of Bruce's jaw, the sickly pallor made worse by the dark coloring of his costume. He was not quite as ill-looking as he had been before, but he did not look himself, not by any stretch of the imagination. \"You were supposed to stay home and I'd bring the cure to you!\" Bruce's eyes shone fever-bright behind his mask. \"I can't let you take these risks because of me,\" he said. The words came out hoarse as though they hurt him to say. \"I have Hermes to guide me, I will be fine,\" Diana said, attempting lightness. \"Besides, you would do no less for me. Or have you forgotten your encounter with Circe?\" Then a thought struck her, and she narrowed her eyes. \"I have not reported to the Justice League or to a certain concerned butler. How did you know where to find me?\" Bruce shrugged. \"I slipped a tracker under your bracelet when you handed me the necklace,\" he said, matter-of-fact. \"You slipped a--\" Diana closed her eyes, counted to ten--eva, ouo...oek'a. \"Batman, we have spoken about this before. I do not find your habit of putting tracers on my person endearing, even if I realize you do it out of concern. It's an invasion of privacy.\" She held her bracelets up to the sunlight, quickly found the small tracer. She handed it back to him. She would have preferred destroying it, but she knew how expensive the little device was, and was not so spiteful to cost Bruce thousands of dollars. \"We will discuss this later,\" she promised darkly. \"Once you are yourself again.\" \"Fine,\" Bruce said, and then just looked at her. The silent longing in his eyes, the tight misery in his jaw, all made her heart clench and her breath catch in her throat. \"I will have the cure soon,\" she told him, and searched his face for any sign of relief. She found none; he simply nodded and kept staring at her. She lowered her voice. \"Batman, you must go back to Gotham. You cannot help me.\" \"Eros's arrow didn't disable me completely,\" Bruce said. \"It simply opened my eyes to--\" He stopped, swallowed. \"It didn't disable me,\" he concluded. \"I can help.\" \"You will be a distraction,\" Diana argued. \"Go back, Br-- Batman!\" The command hung in the salty sea air for a moment, and then Bruce said, \"No.\" His broad shoulders bowed for a moment, his entire body curling in on itself as though Diana had struck him rather than ordered him homeward, but his voice was firm. Diana frowned. Hadn't Aphrodite said he would obey her every order? \"Go home,\" Diana said, putting as much authority into the command as she could muster. \"No,\" Bruce said again. \"Diana, I won't--\" He swayed a little, almost drunkenly. \"Don't make me,\" he said through gritted teeth. \"I have to do something.\" \"Bruce,\" she said, staring at him as he struggled against her order, his eyes sliding shut and a muscle jumping in his jaw. There, at last, was a hint of Bruce's true personality. She could see the stubbornness in his clenched fists and how fiercely he was fighting her command. Could Bruce perhaps fight against an order that went so much against his principles and beliefs? Diana took a breath, uncertain of what to say. She was glad to see that spark of obstinacy once more and learn that Bruce was not completely her puppet, but she didn't know if it would be better to keep him by her side or return him to the Manor. \"He might be useful,\" Hermes said from behind her. She jumped a little and turned to see him eyeing Bruce thoughtfully. \"Ares might appreciate Batman's skill in battle, and be more inclined to help us.\" \"Fine,\" Diana said. \"You may accompany us.\" Immediately Bruce relaxed, his shoulders squaring and his listing to the side stilling as he took a deep breath. His eyes half-opened, catching hers. \"Thank you,\" he said hoarsely. The fingers of her right hand twitched, wanting to press against his shoulder and give him a reassuring squeeze. She clenched her hand into a fist instead and said briskly, \"Just promise to let me and Hermes handle the gods. It won't do you any good to irritate Poseidon and have him turn you into a dolphin.\" \"I promise,\" Bruce said. Then he frowned. \"A dolphin?\" \"The Earth-shaker is almost as fond of dolphins as he is of his horses,\" Hermes informed him. The god glanced at the water lapping against the sides of the jet and frowned. \"How do we make our descent? I could manage it easily, but I know you mortals have trouble going too deeply too quickly.\" \"I brought diving gear,\" Bruce said. His expression was almost wry as his eyes caught and held Diana. It seemed to say, And just how were you going to get to Poseidon's home without me, exactly? The moment quickly passed, replaced by a mute, needy appeal that made Diana drop her gaze to the sea and silently curse Aphrodite once more. After a few seconds, Bruce cleared his throat. \"Just take us down slowly.\" The descent to Poseidon's kingdom was slow and strange. Diana saw schools of various beautiful fish, and then fish that grew odd and unusual in their appearance as the water darkened and the pressure and cold mounted against her gear. She was almost relieved when at last Hermes squeezed her arm. She could not see the god, but the tightening of his grip upon her arm signaled something. A moment later, the god stopped, and with another brief squeeze that seemed more reassuring than agitated, released her. She kicked at the water for a moment, squinting into the darkness and wondering what was going on. Then light appeared, so suddenly and brightly that she shut her eyes and grimaced. She was only half-aware that Hermes had taken her arm again, and was leading her forward. Air rather than water pressed against her then, and she opened her eyes in surprise. She found herself standing with Hermes and Bruce in a large, long corridor, the surrounding stone looking similar to marble but with a greenish tinge. \"Welcome to Poseidon's palace, Princess Diana,\" Hermes said. Diana's lips were numb from the chilly water, but after a moment she had worked her lips enough to say neutrally, \"It is not quite what I expected.\" Bruce, in the middle of discarding his diving gear, looked up. \"Shouldn't someone be here to greet us?\" he asked, and looked more like himself with suspicion darkening his eyes. As though in answer, three beautiful women appeared at the other end of the corridor. \"Welcome, welcome,\" one called, laughing and clapping her hands together. They moved as though they were dancing, sure-footed across the greenish tile towards Diana and her companions. \"Lord Poseidon has been expecting you. Will you come with us and be robed in clothes befitting guests of our lord?\" Diana glanced at Hermes, who shrugged. \"It's generally best not to refuse a god's hospitality,\" he said in a low whisper. \"And if Poseidon has already acknowledged you as a guest, you've won half the battle.\" \"We would be grateful for Lord Poseidon's thoughtfulness,\" Diana declared, smiling and inclining her head to the women. She stepped closer to Bruce, murmured, \"I know you will not want to take off your mask, but somehow ask politely for one you can wear in Poseidon's presence without offense.\" \"And if Poseidon insists I take off my mask?\" Bruce murmured back. \"Then you will have to,\" Diana said. She sighed at his scowl. \"I realize that will compromise your identity, but Bruce, he is the god of the sea. Who would he tell if he knew your true identity? Aquaman?\" Bruce snorted and continued to look disapproving as one of the women took him by the wrist and lead him through the doorway and into another room. \"Princess Diana, I hope you do not mind wearing a dress,\" one of the other women said. \"Lord Poseidon insists upon it.\" \"I have worn dresses before,\" Diana said, amused. Did the Nereid believe she wore only her battle gear, like Artemis only wore the garb of a huntress, or Ares wore his armor? \"Come with me, please. I am Neso,\" the woman added with a movement that was almost a curtsy. She studied Diana's features, and smiled. \"It seems Thetis was right--she had Maira make a dress that matched your eyes.\" Diana frowned. \"How does Thetis know my eye color? We have not met.\" Neso laughed. \"Child, you lived on an island. We might not interfere in the mortal realm anymore, but that doesn't mean we aren't curious enough to peek in on places like Themyscira from time to time.\" \"Ah, of course,\" Diana said. Neso showed her into a small bedchamber, where a dress the exact shade of Diana's eyes lay upon the bed. Diana bit back a gasp at the sight of it, and ran her hand reverently over the smooth, light fabric. When she changed into the dress, it swirled around her feet, feeling weightless. Neso studied her with a critical eye. \"The bracelets work well with the dress,\" she announced. \"The tiara and that case do not. Must you wear them?\" Diana pressed her hand instinctively to the tiara, its cold metal a reassuring constant. \"I would feel more comfortable with the tiara on,\" she admitted with a smile. \"Wearing only the bracelets would make me feel lopsided. And the case contains items that are precious to me. I cannot part with it.\" Neso sighed but didn't protest. \"Come, Poseidon has prepared a feast for you and your companions!\" Diana resisted the urge to frown. \"Poseidon's kindness is generous, but I regret that we really do not have time for a feast. We--\" \"My lord will insist upon a feast at the very least, even if you wish to be on your way,\" Neso interrupted, tone a little sharp. When Diana stared at her, the woman forced a smile. \"I'm sorry. It has been so long since we've had guests,\" she explained. \"If you tell my lord you wish to leave immediately, he will take offense.\" \"I see,\" Diana said. She pushed aside her own impatience--Bruce was here and safe for the moment, after all, and had not professed his undying devotion recently, which made everything a little more bearable. She inclined her head. \"Then I will thank Lord Poseidon for the feast.\" Poseidon did not exude quite as much power as his brother, but his presence was awe-inspiring nonetheless. His eyes were the same green of a stormy sea, and his thick curls the black of the deepest ocean depths. A wide smile warmed his thick, fleshy face as he shouted, \"Sit, sit, nephew. Sit, Princess of the Amazons. Sit, Batman of Gotham. Enjoy the feast I have prepared for you!\" He gestured broadly at the long table he was seated at the head of, the table's surface completely hidden by a dizzying number of plates of food. Diana turned to see that Bruce had, in fact, managed to convince someone that he should be wearing a mask. It was the same shade as his chiton, which was a dark green hue similar to seaweed. The color did not quite suit him, Diana observed, but he looked comfortable in the outfit. There was a touch of the playboy Bruce Wayne in the way he sat down at the table and smiled at both Poseidon and the Nereid who had escorted him into the room. \"You are more than generous, uncle,\" Hermes said. He, too, had kept his hat and winged sandals, but wore a chiton the pale blue color of a calm sea. He sat down at the table and immediately snatched something wrapped in seaweed from one of the nearby plates, popping it into his mouth with a grin. \"I have always been generous,\" Poseidon said loudly. He was, Diana began to realize, the type of god who always spoke in proclaiming tones, so that his words rang in his listeners' ears. Poseidon laughed. \"Tell me, Princess of the Amazons, I am more generous than my brother, am I not?\" \"Your brother, my lord?\" Diana asked as Hermes nearly choked on his food. \"Zeus! Zeus, of course! One of my naiads brought word of how he refused to aid you and your mortal companion here.\" Poseidon reached over and clapped a hand on Bruce's shoulder that made the man wince. \"Tough luck, that!\" he continued. \"Always thought my brother allowed Aphrodite too much freedom with those arrows and that bow. Those damned arrows are always causing trouble!\" Hermes shot Diana a quick look that said to let him handle this bit of diplomacy, and so she stayed quiet as Hermes laughed and said, \"Truer words were never spoken, uncle! But Athena may have found a way to heal Batman, and Zeus did not say that Princess Diana could not seek aid from other gods and goddesses.\" \"So Athena's invented a cure, has she?\" Poseidon said, chuckling. \"Well, if anyone's able to figure out a way to do so, it would be Athena. Good head on her shoulders, that girl. A pity she never married. Imagine what sort of gods she could have brought into the world!\" \"Yes, a pity,\" Hermes said, with only the brief flickering of his gaze away from Poseidon to indicate his strain. Diana, meanwhile, tried to imagine stern-faced Athena with children, and failed. \"And what sort of cure has she thought up, then?\" Poseidon asked. \"I must gather ingredients for a potion, my lord, which will reverse the effects,\" Diana said. Poseidon let out a sharp bark of laughter. \"And that's why you've come to my kingdom, princess? To ask a boon of me? Not for my delightful company, it seems! A pity!\" \"The pleasure of your company is indeed delightful, my lord,\" Diana said smoothly, \"but I will not evade your question. I am here for a needed ingredient-- water from one of your salt springs.\" The atmosphere, which had been so cheerful a moment earlier, now turned tense. \"And what will you give me in exchange?\" Poseidon asked, fixing her with a sharp look. \"No boon from the gods comes for free, princess. Any god or goddess who hasn't demanded something from you in exchange for an ingredient had an agenda.\" Diana saw Bruce tense. She quelled him with a brief touch of her hand to his knee, and then refocused her attention on Poseidon. \"I am but an Amazon, my lord, and no goddess. I could not guess what you would want from me, but I'll gladly give what you wish in exchange for the water.\" \"Diana,\" Hermes breathed quietly, low enough that only she heard his soft protest. \"Well said, princess,\" Poseidon said after a moment, and some of the tension left the room. He rested his chin on his fist, looking at her with a thoughtful gleam in his eyes. Then he chortled, apparently striking upon a pleasing idea. \"You are a princess of the Amazons, women known for their skill in battle, but not their riding skills. Ride one of my horses around this table without falling from its back, and I will give you what you ask for.\" \"Ride a horse around this table,\" Diana echoed. She glanced at her companions. Bruce frowned, but said nothing. Hermes wore an unreadable look. \"I accept the exchange, my lord. Shall I ride the horse after the meal?\" \"After the meal,\" Poseidon agreed, and then chuckled once more, pushing a plate closer to her. \"Now eat up! You'll need your strength!\" \"Diana,\" Hermes hissed as Poseidon bellowed for another jug of wine to be brought to the table. \"Have you ever ridden a horse?\" \"One or twice,\" Diana said, and shook her head at Hermes's despairing groan. \"What should I have done, then? It's either ride a horse or go back to the surface empty-handed!\" Hermes didn't argue, just drank a long draught of his wine. \"I suppose we'll see if one of Poseidon's horses is strong enough to break even an Amazon's bones,\" he muttered into his drink. \"Quiet,\" Diana said sharply, but thankfully Bruce had been distracted by a smiling Nereid offering him a sweetmeat. \"If you imply I will be injured, I do not know how Bruce will react,\" she whispered. \"He is under enough strain, understand?\" \"Very well,\" Hermes said, and then surprised her by taking her wine glass away when she reached for it. \"Poseidon's wine is stronger than your mortal attempts,\" he explained. \"You'll need a clear head.\" Diana watched Bruce listen gravely to whatever the Nereid was saying, all trace of his playboy disguise gone as she leaned over his shoulder. There was only polite interest in his smile as he nodded at what the Nereid had just said and accepted a plate from her. \"Yes,\" she said, looking away. \"I will.\" \"Here are my stables!\" Poseidon announced, throwing the doors open with a clang. None of the horses so much as twitched an ear, apparently used to the god's loud entrances. \"You may pick whichever horse you like for the challenge.\" \"Thank you, my lord. That is generous of you,\" Diana said, and then murmured to Hermes, \"Do you know anything of horses, Lord Hermes?\" \"I do,\" Bruce said as Hermes shrugged. A strained smile flickered on his face at Diana's surprise. Gently, so that only she could hear, he added, \"What, do you think Bruce Wayne never goes to the races?\" \"I,\" Diana said, and stopped. In all honesty, she paid little attention to what Bruce did in his playboy disguise. She could not escape that particular alter ego, of course, when Bruce Wayne's antics so often dominated the news, but she did not make a habit of prying into that part of Bruce's life. \"Thank you,\" she said at last even as she handed the case to Hermes for safe-keeping. Bruce nodded, and then turned towards one of the nearby stalls, making his way down the aisle. He examined each horse carefully. At last he returned, bringing with him a mare the color of pale sea foam, prancing lightly on her hooves. The halter and saddle were made of a metal that looked like gold, glittering in the torchlight. \"This one,\" Bruce said. \"All of Poseidon's horses are spirited, but she'll listen to you if you're confident enough.\" \"You have an eye for horseflesh!\" Poseidon roared. If anything, he looked delighted at Bruce's choice. \"Well then, princess, let's see how you ride!\" Bruce handed the reins to Hermes and then knelt, offering Diana his cupped hands. She stared at him for a moment, but his features were obscured by the new mask. She put her foot in his hands, felt his hands tighten briefly, and then she swung her other leg over the back of the mare. Scarcely had she gotten her seat when the mare snorted and began to prance away from Bruce, tugging sharply at the reins Hermes still held. \"I think you will need these,\" Hermes said dryly, handing the reins to Diana. She gripped them tightly, and then tighter still as the mare shook her head and then began to trot away from the onlookers, heading towards the open door. \"We'll be waiting at the table, princess!\" Poseidon called, and began to laugh as the mare increased her speed. Diana tugged on the reins to no avail; the mare continued to canter down the varying hallways. No matter how much she strained at the reins, the horse just flattened her ears and went where she willed, jostling Diana's breath from her. Everything was a blur, the salty air stinging Diana's eyes as the mare galloped down one corridor, then another. At last Diana pressed her cheek against the mare's neck and snapped in her ear, \"All right, you've had your fun, but it is time to behave. You will go where I want, or you will regret it.\" The horse snorted, and Diana tugged the reins sharply to the left, just in time to avoid a startled Nereid, her arms full of dirty dishes. \"I do not have time for this!\" Diana yelled, the sound loud enough that the mare hesitated briefly, whickering a soft sound of surprise. \"We are going to see your lord, understand?\" she said, not knowing if the horse could understand her, but hoping so. This was one of Poseidon's prized horses, after all; surely she would be intelligent. \"Now, go to Poseidon!\" The mare huffed, sounding almost sulky, and then turned and cantered in an entirely new direction. Diana clutched grimly at the reins and hoped this wasn't another trick. \"Took you long enough!\" Poseidon bellowed when she and the mare galloped into the room and began their route around the table. \"We were beginning to give up on you, princess!\" The mare came to a stop in front of her master, sticking her nose into his hair and snuffling. \"I thought your horse might enjoy stretching her legs, my lord,\" Diana said, starting to dismount. Immediately her leg muscles locked. \"Gods!\" The exclamation escaped her lips before she could bite it back, and she nearly fell from the mare's back. Only Bruce's sudden grasp of her waist prevented her from shaming herself by tumbling from the saddle. \"Diana,\" he said, dark eyes narrow in the slits the mask provided him. \"Let me help you.\" \"My legs are a bit sore,\" she explained, embarrassed by the concerned looks both Bruce and Hermes were directing towards her. \"It is nothing serious.\" \"Perhaps you lost track of time, princess, but you've been riding through Poseidon's palace for three hours,\" Hermes remarked from where he sat sipping at a glass of wine. \"Had you been mortal, I suspect your legs would have fallen off during that ride.\" \"Three hours?\" Diana echoed in disbelief. It had seemed only minutes. No wonder her legs ached so, the muscles knotted and painful. Through a haze of discomfort, she let herself slide from the saddle into Bruce's grasp, only realizing as his arms wrapped around her that she should probably have refused his assistance. \"Diana,\" he whispered; his breath was warm on her ear. \"You should rest.\" \"I'll have Neso the Nereid take me to my room,\" she tried to say, but then Bruce let out a quiet, shuddering sigh and held her closer, his lips tickling the spot right under her ear. Her legs now felt wobbly, though she told herself that was from the riding. \"Hermes, let me give you that salt water!\" she heard Poseidon shout, then roar with mirth. \"I hope the poor mortal won't have to drink the stuff. Useful, my salt springs are, of course, but tasty they are not!\" \"Thank you, my lord,\" came Hermes's quieter reply, and then Bruce was leading Diana from the room. \"Bruce,\" she tried to say, but her legs felt even worse with each passing step, and she gave up on protesting. It would be pure foolishness to push Bruce away only to crumple to the floor, she told herself. She would have to let Bruce take her to her bedchambers and then send him away before Eros's arrow made him do something they'd both regret. \"Here's the bed,\" Bruce whispered in her ear, and she sank gratefully onto the covers. \"By all the blessed gods, that was something I wouldn't wish to experience again,\" she sighed, stretching out her legs and wincing as the strained muscles protested. She jumped at a sudden pressure on her leg. She looked down at the top of Bruce's head, for he was kneeling next to the bed, his hands cupping one ankle carefully. \"Bruce!\" \"You need rest,\" he said, not looking up at her as he removed one boot. \"I know you're a warrior and can sleep anywhere and in any situation, Diana, but I don't think you'd actually enjoy sleeping in your boots.\" He removed the second boot and leaned away from the bed, one hand resting on the bed next to her knee. She could feel the warmth radiating from his skin. His hands were bare, she realized. Apparently he had convinced his attendant to leave him a mask, but not gloves. His hands seemed strange, uncovered; she could see the light brushing of hair on his knuckles. She caught up his hand, the one close to her knee, and turned it so that his palm was open towards the ceiling. Diana studied the calluses he'd earned through years of fighting and building his machines, the small white scars. Sometimes she wondered how people saw Bruce Wayne in his civilian disguise and didn't immediately recognize his hands as those of a warrior. \"Diana,\" Bruce whispered, sounding as though he were choking. She dropped his hand with a start, shame warming her face. How could she force her touch upon him when she knew he couldn't refuse her? \"Bruce, I am sorry,\" she said quickly. He looked at her, then, and reached up to tug his mask off and drop it onto the floor. Unmasked, she could see the warring emotions twisting his features, the full intensity of his dark gaze. \"Diana,\" he said again. \"I know what you told me, but I-- I want--\" He swallowed. \"You know how I feel,\" he said hoarsely. \"Why are you fighting this?\" The misery in his voice made her answering misery taste bitter as she shook her head. \"If you hadn't been struck by Eros's arrows, you wouldn't be acting this way,\" she said. \"How could I take advantage of you when you're like this? You would never forgive me once the potion clears the arrow's poison from your system. Iwould never forgive myself.\" \"And I am telling you that Eros's arrow did nothing but tear the veil from my eyes!\" Bruce snapped. \"These emotions, they're real, Diana. I don't understand why you keep arguing--\" \"One, dating within the team always leads to disaster,\" Diana said, words clipped and precise. She watched Bruce wince. \"Two, I'm a princess from a society of immortal warriors, and you're a rich kid with issues--\" \"Stop,\" Bruce said. \"You can't hold that speech against me, Diana. Time has passed. My feelings have changed since then.\" \"No, they haven't,\" Diana said. \"Yes, they have,\" Bruce said, frustration sharpening his words. When Diana shook her head, Bruce groaned. \"You don't believe me. Will you believe me if I approach you once we've used the potion?\" It took a moment for Diana to gather enough breath to speak, to make certain her voice was steady and her expression calm. She would not let Bruce see how much that question had hurt. \"You won't,\" she said. \"You will banish me from Gotham for a few months, participate in as few Justice League issues as possible, and after a few months, you'll relent enough to treat me as a friend again.\" \"Did I miss when Apollo gave you the gift of prophecy?\" Bruce asked bitterly. \"You sound like you can see the future.\" \"I am no seer, but I know you,\" Diana said. \"You don't know me as well as you think, princess,\" Bruce said, turning the title into an insult. He rose to his feet, snatching his mask from the floor, and turned to go. Halfway to the door, he paused and turned back. On his face was a look of mingled anger and resignation. \"Have you given up, then?\" Diana couldn't help it; she laughed. It was a quiet, melancholy sound, one that made Bruce frown. \"I will never give up, Bruce,\" she said quietly. \"Perhaps you don't know me as well as you think, either. You should know I am no quitter.\" Bruce was silent for a long moment. Then he tugged his mask back onto his face. \"Get some rest, Diana,\" he said, and left before she could speak. She stared at the closed door, and then leaned back against the pillows, throwing one arm over her eyes. \"Oh, Hera help me,\" she muttered. \"Let Dionysus's ingredient be a simpler trade. I cannot take another day of this.\" She slept fitfully. When she woke, all her muscles seemed turned to stone, from her neck to even the tendons in her feet. She groaned, rubbing at the knotted muscles in her thighs and cursing under her breath. \"Have this drink, Princess Diana,\" Neso said, entering with a steaming goblet and sympathetic smile. \"It is diluted ambrosia. It will help your muscles heal.\" \"Thank you,\" Diana gasped, drinking greedily. She tasted spices, heady on her tongue, warming her as the drink hit her belly. The warmth spread through her limbs swiftly, and in a few minutes, Diana felt well enough to rise. \"Thank you,\" she said again, and looked around for her clothing. She changed back into her clothes, handing the rumpled dress off to Neso with an apologetic grimace. \"Do not look so dismayed, Your Highness!\" Neso said with a laugh. \"This is fabric created by Arachne before Lady Athena turned her into a spider. The wrinkles will come out soon enough.\" \"Where are Lord Hermes and Batman?\" Diana asked. \"They are eating breakfast with Lord Poseidon before you depart. Lord Poseidon did not think you would want food after the ambrosia, but you are welcome at the table.\" \"Thank you,\" Diana repeated. In fact, she did not feel hungry at all, all her fatigue and hunger replaced by boundless energy. She adjusted her tiara and smiled. \"May the gods bless you, Neso.\" Poseidon was in the middle of a story when Diana entered, but he broke off from telling the tale long enough to roar out a greeting to Diana. Then he continued the story, something about the Nereid Galene's chance meeting of the king of Atlantis a few centuries ago. \"Not hungry, Princess Diana?\" Hermes whispered as Poseidon chortled at his own jest. \"I drank some diluted ambrosia,\" she whispered. \"That was kind of my uncle,\" Hermes said, and then clapped loudly at Poseidon's tale. Once Poseidon had finished his story and Bruce and Hermes had finished their meal, Diana cleared her throat. She didn't look at Bruce, who hadn't so much as glanced her way when she'd entered. \"My lord Poseidon, thank you for your hospitality and the ambrosia. You have been more than generous.\" Poseidon snorted. \"I couldn't let you hobble out of here, princess, looking like Hephaestus on one of his worse days. Go and get the rest of your ingredients. I look forward to hearing from one of my naiads that you've succeeded.\" He tossed two small, gleaming items, one towards her and another towards Bruce. She caught hers, and blinked. It was a small pearl. \"Chew and swallow it, and you'll be able to make the journey to the surface easier. Still need those odd contraptions you brought with you, of course, but you won't get a headache if Hermes brings you to the surface too quickly,\" the god explained. \"No ringing in the ears or difficulty breathing, that sort of nonsense.\" \"Thank you, my lord.\" Diana placed it in her mouth. It collapsed against her teeth with a quiet crackling sound. The pearl tasted of salt, its texture like tiny pieces of sand as she chewed and swallowed. Unlike the ambrosia, she felt no difference. \"If I'd known you were so hospitable, uncle, I would have visited your kingdom more often over the years,\" Hermes said, rising to his feet. \"Shall I come and tell you all of the adventures of this quest in person?\" Poseidon tugged at his beard and snorted. \"So long as you do no embellishing,\" he began, sounding stern, and then belied his words by laughing and declaring, \"Ah, embellish all you like, nephew! Tell me how she stole a lightning bolt from Zeus, or a peacock from Hera.\" Hermes grinned and looked thoughtful, as though he was already imagining what sort of stories to tell during his next visit. \"So who are we beseeching next?\" Hermes asked once they were back upon the surface, Bruce standing on the nose of his jet and Diana hovering over one of its wings. \"I thought Dionysus,\" Diana said, and Hermes nodded. \"Better him than Ares or Hades, eh?\" he said. Bruce frowned. \"What about Ares or Hades?\" he asked, and Diana realized that the full details of the quest had never been explained to him. She frowned at Hermes and said quickly, \"Just as I asked a boon of Poseidon, I must ask a boon or trade from a few more gods. Then Hestia will be able to mix the ingredients, Apollo and Artemis to temper them, and then you will be cured.\" Bruce's frown deepened. \"If I remember my mythology--\" he began. \"Let me figure out where Dionysus is. Hopefully he's in a good mood,\" Diana said and turned on her earpiece. \"Code 21Q, Wonder Woman to Zatanna. Code 21Q, Wonder Woman to Zatanna.\" \"Diana?\" Zatanna sounded surprised, which Diana supposed was understandable. Although they had become friends after the incident with Circe, they worked and lived in different circles and rarely had the opportunity to spend time together. \"Yes. Zatanna, I am sorry to rush you, but I need a favor.\" \"Treat me to a dinner at that great Greek place in Metropolis where you're a celebrity next time we're both in the city, and you've got a deal,\" Zatanna said. Diana could picture the other woman's smile. \"What do you need?\" \"The current location of Dionysus.\" There was a beat of silence. \"Diana. Please tell me you aren't going to use this information to go talkto him.\" Diana smiled at the concern in Zatanna's voice. Unlike the other gods, Dionysus had openly ignored Zeus's rules about non-interference and could often be found in the mortal world. The magic community kept close tabs on the god-- his presence had a tendency to throw otherwise stable or neutral magic into chaos. \"I'll be fine, Zatanna. I have Batman and Hermes with me.\" \"Batman and Hermes--right, not even going to ask,\" Zatanna said, huffing out a disbelieving laugh. \"Give me a minute; let me see if I've got anything concrete....He's on Crete right now. Is that all you need?\" \"Unless your sources know if he's in a good mood or not,\" Diana said wryly, and laughed at the baffled silence that answered her. \"Thank you for your help, Zatanna.\" \"No problem,\" Zatanna said, sounding troubled. \"Just be careful, okay? Dealing with gods is...chancy.\" \"Believe me,\" Diana sighed, \"I am all too aware of that fact.\" She turned the earpiece back off, ignoring the way Bruce had his arms folded against his chest and was frowning dangerously. \"Well, let us go to Crete!\" she said, and leapt into the air before Bruce could speak. Behind her, she saw Hermes shake his head and extend a hand to Bruce. A few seconds later, they were flying next to Diana. Bruce seemed to be shouting something, probably about Ares and Aphrodite, but Diana pretended not to notice. Instead she put on another burst of speed. Crete was over 400 kilometers away, after all. Unsurprisingly, they found Dionysus at a bar. He was in his younger guise today, looking like a youth who'd only just begun puberty, the soft golden fuzz of a first beard covering his jaw. He looked too young to be drinking, Diana thought, but none of the other customers seemed bothered about his age. They were more puzzled by his wife, who looked unfazed by the curious glances directed her way. Ariadne leaned comfortably against her husband, draping a possessive, slender arm around his neck and stealing the occasional sip from his wine glass. She looked the same age she had when she had died and Dionysus had seized her and Semele from the Underworld, a beautiful young woman of twenty-some years. Her expression was vague and flushed from wine, but it sharpened as she noticed their approach. \"It seems we have company, beloved,\" she said. She spoke in the slow, languid way of the extremely inebriated, her eyes half-lidded as she studied Diana, Bruce, and Hermes. \"I wonder what an Amazon, a mortal, and a god have come to ask of you.\" \"Cousin!\" Dionysus said brightly, in a soprano that sometimes deepened unexpectedly into tenor. \"What brings you to Crete? And in such unusual company, as well! You must have a fascinating story to tell.\" Diana met Dionysus's eyes, and immediately wished she hadn't. Dionysus was in one of his more dangerous moods today, his eyes gleaming with madness and cruel mirth. She closed her eyes for a moment, dizzy. \"I am guiding Princess Diana of the Amazons on a quest, cousin,\" Hermes explained. Diana opened her eyes and glanced at the messenger god. Judging by the strain in his too-bright smile, Hermes too had noticed Dionysus's dangerous humor. \"A quest!\" Dionysus's smile faded, replaced by the beginning of a scowl. \"My Ariadne and I are not fond of quests. Theseus was on a quest when he abandoned my beloved.\" He tenderly stroked Ariadne's arm as he spoke, as though to reassure himself that his wife was here, not in the Underworld or still abandoned on Naxos. \"This is a very different quest, cousin,\" Hermes explained. \"Princess Diana seeks to cure our companion, Batman of Gotham, of the infatuation caused by one of Eros's arrows.\" \"You needn't explain,\" Dionysus said irritably. \"I know the mark of the arrows' madness well enough.\" He stared at Diana. She met his gaze without blinking, ignoring the roiling of her stomach. \"So you are trying to cure him?\" \"Yes, my lord.\" \"Why?\" Ariadne asked, tilting her head and looking curious. Diana glanced at Bruce, but he continued to avoid her gaze, his eyes focused instead on Dionysus and Ariadne. \"Would you have wanted Dionysus to fall in love with you through Eros's arrows, my lady?\" she asked. \"Dionysus's love for you is still remembered by the mortal world even today. Eros's arrows never tainted that moment when Lord Dionysus first beheld you on Naxos.\" Ariadne laughed. \"I like you,\" she said, and then said in a carrying whisper, \"Dionysus, do help them. I know quests are worse than useless, but I like her.\" Some of the madness ebbed from Dionysus's face and he caressed Ariadne's cheek. \"Whatever you want, dearest,\" he told her, voice affectionate, and added without looking away from Ariadne's smiling countenance, \"Is there any way we could aid you, princess?\" Diana took out one of the vials. \"We need some of your wine, my lord.\" Dionysus laughed, a wild, delighted sound. \"Someone is making sport of you, Amazon. If your mortal there drinks my wine, his infatuation will not be cured, only replaced by another type of madness.\" \"Lady Athena gave me a list of ingredients, my lord. I am certain she would not lead me astray,\" Diana said firmly. \"Athena,\" Dionysus growled. \"No, she wouldn't, the spoilsport. Ah well, I've promised Ariadne I would help you, and I never break a promise to her.\" He snapped his fingers. Instantly the large vial filled with a wine of a deep purple shade. \"Thank you, my lord,\" Diana said. Dionysus removed his hand from Ariadne's face long enough to wiggle his fingers in a clear go-away signal. \"You begin to bore me,\" he announced, and then cast a speculative look at Bruce. \"You, however, intrigue me. I've seen you before.\" \"Have you?\" Bruce said without any inflection. \"I seem to remember myths where you caused madness in mortal minds. Perhaps you have seen me fighting some of your handiwork. There is a mortal who calls himself the Joker--\" \"Oh, oh, oh!\" Dionysus said, laughing in pleased surprise. \"How could I have forgotten you? Batman of Gotham. Gotham is such a fun place-- so many minds teeming with desperation, on the edge of madness. All it takes is one little push--\" Bruce stepped forward, but Hermes seized him by the elbow and dragged him backwards. \"Stay away from Gotham,\" Bruce growled, and if the situation wasn't so terrible, Diana would have laughed. Of course Bruce would tell a god to leave his city alone. \"You are ordering me to stay away from your city,\" Dionysus said, fixing him with a sharp, intrigued gaze. \"Has Eros's arrow damaged your mind more than just twisting your feelings for the Amazon, mortal? Or do you truly think I'll be swayed by that growl and glare of yours?\" When Bruce continued to glower, Dionysus laughed. \"You do think I'll obey the command of a mortal! Oh, how novel! You are an amusing little mortal.\" \"Stay a--\" Bruce began, and stopped with a grunt, presumably because Hermes had stepped on his foot. \"He is quite a character, cousin,\" Hermes agreed with a nervous laugh. \"And now we must be going. So good to see you, Ariadne, you look as lovely as ever. See you in a century or two!\" He dragged Bruce backwards as he made his exit. Diana bowed. \"Thank you again for your assistance, my lord, my lady,\" she said, and then followed after Hermes and Bruce. When she stepped out of the bar, it was in time to see Hermes shake Bruce and snap, \"You are lucky he didn't turn you into a tiger and have you draw his chariot!\" \"He threatened Gotham,\" Bruce said stubbornly. Diana sighed. If the ambrosia had not still been warming her belly, she would doubtless be dealing with a throbbing headache right now, both from Bruce's recklessness and from meeting Dionysus's eyes. \"Batman, Hermes, we only have two more items to gather,\" she said. \"What's done is done. Let's not bicker.\" \"Fine,\" Hermes said. \"Are we saving Hades for last, or does Ares have that pleasure?\" Diana shook her head. \"Ares first, then Hades,\" she said. \"We will need all of our strength and no distractions to venture into the Underworld.\" Ares could often be found on Aretias, one of his sacred islands. Diana approached the island with a sensation of mingled nervousness and an odd, exulting excitement. What would Ares ask in exchange for the snake's venom? She imagined herself challenging the god to a match, and something in her cried out in fierce joy. It had been too long since she had allowed herself to fully devote herself to a battle, to not have to constantly check her attacks before she harmed her opponent. She could use all of her strength against a god without fear. Ares was sharpening a spear when they landed in the clearing. A vulture fluttered on a nearby branch and grumbled at their approach and a few of the dogs milling around the god's feet eyed them with interest, but Ares didn't look up from his spear. \"So the Amazon comes at last to me,\" he said. \"I have heard you are a fierce warrior, little princess, and seen the wreckage of more than one of your battles.\" \"I am a warrior, my lord,\" Diana said. Anticipation hummed sweetly in her veins. \"In fact, I have come to propose a challenge.\" She ignored Hermes's startled look. \"A challenge?\" Ares finally looked up, his thick eyebrows beetling over his eyes. \"What sort of challenge?\" \"When was the last time you faced an Amazon in battle, my lord? Fight me. If you are impressed with my skill, you will give us a small vial of venom from one of your blessed snakes.\" \"And if I am not impressed?\" \"Then I will make another offer for that venom, something that would better please you,\" Diana said promptly. After a moment, a wide grin spread across Ares's features, puckered the small, thin scar that had just missed mutilating his lips. \"Amazons!\" he roared with approval, setting aside his spear and slapping his knee. \"If only Hera would set aside that stupid ban on men visiting Themyscira! We could have such glorious fights.\" He sighed, almost looking wistful. \"Very well, Amazon, we shall fight, but the weapons will be of my choosing.\" \"Agreed,\" Diana said, and ignored Bruce's hoarse protest. She grinned at the god, baring her teeth. \"I am ready whenever you are, my lord.\" \"I am in the mood for wrestling,\" Ares announced. Diana studied him, the good foot in height he had over her, the way his gleaming muscles bulged whenever he so much as breathed. Her smile didn't falter. \"Wrestling sounds perfect,\" she said. A minute later, Ares had taken a stick and dug the skamma in the center of the clearing. \"No modern rules,\" he ordered. \"We'll stick to the proper, traditional way of wrestling, to three points. Hermes will be the referee-- an impartial one, unless he wants to incur my wrath.\" \"Of course, my lord,\" she said. She watched him take off his armor, revealing the dirty, sweat-stained tunic underneath it, and his boots. She took off the tiara and her bracelets, pressing them into Bruce's hands, and then toed her way out of the boots. \"Keep them safe for me, please,\" she said. \"Princess Diana, this is madness,\" Hermes said. \"Not madness,\" Bruce corrected, \"but an unnecessary risk.\" \"No risk at all,\" Diana said. \"Ares won't be so sloppy as to kill me, and I plan to give him a match he won't soon forget.\" Hermes sighed and shot her a curious look. \"I had heard gossip that Ares was father to your queen, but I admit, I never put much thought into that rumor until now,\" he muttered. \"It seems more likely by the minute.\" Diana shook her head. \"My mother is not Ares's daughter,\" she said, and then turned away, stepping into the square where Ares impatiently waited. \"We shall begin the match on the count of three,\" Ares said. \"One...two...three!\" He roared out the number, and then charged, sand flying away from his bare feet. She darted forward to meet him, enjoying the surprise that flashed in his eyes. She slid under his legs, careful not to let her back touch the earth, and then threw herself upon the god's back, wrapping her legs around his waist and slinging one arm around his chest. The other arm went around the god's throat, trying to choke Ares's breath from him. Ares roared and thrashed around, staggering precariously close to the edge of the square. After a minute, however, his struggles knocked Diana's arm away from his chest, and he reached up to grab her other arm. A second later she found herself flying, off the god's back and rolling near and past the line, all the way to Hermes's feet. There was a beat of silence. \"Point to Ares,\" Hermes said weakly. Diana got to her feet, taking a deep, careful breath. The throw had been powerful, but she had not landed wrong. She wouldn't even bruise. She smiled at Ares. \"Well done, my lord,\" she said, stepping back into the skamma. As soon as she had stepped back into the square, Ares charged again, lowering his head like a bull. This time she did not slide underneath him, but instead darted to the side, watching gleefully at the god skidded to a stop, toes almost touching the edge of the skamma. Ares grinned dangerously and began to circle her, watching for any openings. \"Running away from me, Amazon?\" \"Not at all, my lord,\" Diana informed him sweetly. \"You simply seemed in such a rush to be out of the skamma, I hated to be in your way.\" Ares laughed, and she struck in that brief moment, coming at the god low and hard, aiming for his knees. The god's laughter changed to a shout of surprise as he stumbled and tipped back over the line. \"Point to Diana!\" Hermes shouted. \"Your mother taught you well, Amazon,\" Ares said. \"Never let your guard down in a match.\" He stepped back into the skamma, and she waited the appropriate few seconds before she darted at him, watching him plant his feet to brace for the impact. At the last second, though, she stopped her forward momentum and leapt backwards, out of the god's reach. \"You are hovering so close to edge, my lord,\" she said with a mocking laugh. \"Do you long for the easy point that would come from grabbing my wrist and sending me flying back to Lord Hermes's feet?\" Ares snorted. \"And meanwhile you dart and prance around like a fool,\" he said. He crooked a finger at her. \"Come and test your strength against me, girl.\" She looked again at his broad shoulders, his height, his muscles, and grinned. \"Thank you for the invitation, my lord,\" she said, and stepped forward to meet him in the middle. She planted her feet in the sand, caught his hands to hers, and pushed hard. Her feet slid slowly through the sand for a moment as Ares shoved back, then the movement stopped as she grunted and pushed harder. Ares grinned down at her, his face flushed. \"You might be strong, girl, but no Amazon is a match for a god,\" he said. \"We'll see,\" Diana said through gritted teeth even as Ares grinned wider and forced her back another few meters. She strained against him, winning back a few meters even as her shoulders and arms protested at the exertion. Slowly, Ares pushed her back until she knew the edge of the skamma was an inch away from her heels. She grinned up at him even as he made that final push and shoved her from the skamma. \"You may be stronger, my lord, but you'll find brute strength isn't everything.\" The remark came out breathless. Ares snorted, stepping back to the center of the square even as Hermes called out, \"Point to Ares!\" \"You sound like Athena, girl,\" he said. \"She's always talking about strategies and battle formations. She doesn't appreciate the way your blood heats up during a fight, how sometimes you have to just ignore plans and revel in the madness of battle.\" \"I can appreciate a good strategy,\" Diana admitted, stepping back into the skamma. She rotated her neck slowly, heard something pop in her spine as she stretched and continued, \"But there is something to be said to just letting yourself go in a fight.\" Ares chuckled and lunged at her, his large, meaty hands catching hold of her wrists and lifting her off her feet. He spun her around and around until wind roared in her ears and she could barely breathe. Then he threw her. She landed hard enough to send up a spray of sand. She blinked away sand, listening for Hermes's cry of, \"Point to Ares!\" When none came, she threw herself to the side, narrowly avoiding Ares as he grabbed for her once more. He had either misjudged his throw or was enjoying the match too much to end it. Diana spun to face him just as he charged again. This time she let him come, standing there unmoving despite Bruce's cry to get out of the way. Ares grinned as he rushed at her, but that grin was replaced by a flicker of surprise as Diana dropped to one knee. A second later, the god's eyes widened with understanding, but it was too late--Diana already had one hand planted on his stomach, and the other wrenching his arm, using his own momentum to toss him over her shoulder and out of the skamma. \"Point to Diana!\" Ares got to his feet slowly. Frustration now flushed his face, made a vein pulse in his temple. She watched him warily. Ares was well-known for his temper. He would not kill her, but he wouldn't be adverse to breaking a limb or two if he grew too vexed that a mere Amazon had matched him point-for-point. \"Nice trick, Amazon,\" he said sourly, re-entering the skamma. \"Now let us see if you can use your wits to get out of this one.\" Diana braced herself, but she was not expecting the large, muscular god to move so swiftly, or to hook one foot around her ankle and send her toppling to the sand. She was already struggling to her feet when Ares grabbed her arm and wrenched it behind her back. The pain flared in her shoulder, and she bit back a pained sound. He was going to make her tap out, she realized, to assuage his wounded pride. She gritted her teeth and struggled, for she was not going to give up without a fight, but she swiftly realized Ares had the advantage. She was trapped on her knees, unable to gain any leverage, and Ares had her arm in an iron grip. She fought against his grip, wrenching her shoulder even more as she tried to struggle to her feet. \"I don't think so, girl,\" Ares said into her ear. \"Give the sand a little tap and your discomfort will be over.\" When she didn't immediately tap the sand, he grunted in frustration and gave her arm another painful wrench. Her joint screamed in agony, and she saw stars. He would dislocate her shoulder if she continued to fight, she realized, and she couldn't go into the Underworld with a dislocated shoulder. Grimacing, she tapped the sand. Immediately Hermes cried, \"Point and match to Ares!\" and Ares released her. She rose to her feet, pride keeping her from immediately rubbing at her shoulder. Instead she kept her throbbing shoulder stationary and used her other arm to don her boots and tiara. She left the bracelets in Bruce's grasp. She would put them on once out of Ares's eyesight. She would not wince in front of him. \"Congratulations, my lord,\" she said. \"What did you think of the match?\" \"Well fought!\" Ares roared. \"I have not had such a match since the last great heroes thought to test their mettle against me. You can have that venom with my gratitude, girl!\" He pursed his lips and whistled a loud, demanding note. A second later, a brightly colored snake emerged from the tree-line, winding its way to Ares's feet. Hermes stepped forward, offering the vial and studying the snake with interest. Despite her discomfort, Diana gaped at the snake as well--she would never see its like in Man's World, for that sacred breed was now extinct save for the few that Ares kept near him. \"Good girl,\" Ares crooned at the snake as he coaxed the venom from its fangs and into the vial. After a minute, he handed the vial back. \"Will you stay for a meal? I was planning to hunt boar.\" \"Thank you for the offer, cousin, but we have a few more trips to make today,\" Hermes said. \"Perhaps another time.\" It was not until they were away from the clearing that Diana allowed herself to rub her shoulder and gingerly test the joint. The pain was beginning to subside, thankfully-- there would not be any damage besides some soreness. Once they had flown a few miles away from the island, Diana came to a stop in mid-air. Hermes stopped as well. \"I need my bracelets,\" she said, extending a hand for them. Bruce hesitated, and then handed them over, Hermes holding tightly to his elbow as he did. She laughed a little at their identical expressions of disapproval even as she winced and carefully put on the bracelets. \"You two look as stern as Lady Athena. We got the venom, didn't we? And without explaining why we needed it, no less! He will not go running to Aphrodite.\" \"You might have explained your plan beforehand,\" Hermes said. \"Can we at least discuss how we're handling our adventure into the Underworld? Hades will not welcome you with open arms.\" \"I thought we might appeal to Lady Persephone,\" Diana said. She shrugged at Hermes's incredulous look. \"She has little love for her husband. If we asked her for a flower from the Asphodel Meadows, she would agree out of spite and gratitude when we bear Lady Demeter's message to her.\" \"There's an idea,\" Hermes murmured, looking less disapproving now. Bruce's expression still hadn't changed. \"I don't think you should go to the Underworld,\" he said. As Diana gaped at him in disbelief, he turned towards Hermes. \"Hades despises all Amazons, and especially Diana. If she goes, Hades would probably prefer the Meadows to burn before any flower could be used to help her. But if you go, alone, bringing a message from Demeter that must be said in private to Persephone, you could ask her for the flower in secret.\" \"This is my quest,\" Diana protested even as Hermes began to nod. \"I must get the flower myself!\" Hermes shook his head. \"Not entirely true, Princess Diana. After all, Athena gave you Hera's gift. You didn't have to collect it on your own. And this is your quest, true, but I've traveled with you the entire time. The Fates will not protest if I go in your stead.\" Diana scowled, but both Hermes and Bruce looked obstinate. And Hermes did have a point. If she was not there to incite Hades's fury, perhaps Hermes could get in and out of the Underworld without incident. \"Very well,\" Diana said with a sigh. She opened the case and pulled out the final vial, handing it to the god. \"Batman and I will go get the chalice from Hephaestus and I will meet you in Hestia's domain. Does that suit you?\" \"Yes,\" Hermes said. He hesitated, glancing between Bruce and Diana. \"Should I take you two back to Batman's jet and then go on to the Underworld from there?\" \"Since I can't fly, that'd probably be a good idea,\" Bruce said dryly. Now that he had made his point, he had returned to avoiding Diana's gaze. Diana flew ahead of Hermes and Bruce, torn between exasperation and amusement. Even with his thoughts and feelings befuddled by Eros's arrow, Bruce still managed to be irritatingly intelligent and persuasive. Bruce got into the jet without a word, motioning for Diana to lead the way. She paused for a moment, looking towards Hermes. \"You said Eros asked a boon from you,\" she said quietly. \"Yes,\" Hermes said, expression unreadable. \"If there is anything I can do to lessen his debt to you,\" Diana began, and stopped at Hermes's laughter. \"Princess, princess, princess,\" he said with a shake of his head. \"I don't know if you've noticed, but this is the most stimulation Olympus has seen in centuries. It is excitingto be around you. In fact, I'm almost tempted to tell Eros that just traveling with you has cancelled the debt.\" He grinned a little wickedly. \"I won't, of course, because having Eros owe me will doubtlessly come in handy later, but I am very nearly tempted.\" Diana found herself laughing. \"I am glad to have provided you with such amusement, my lord. I wish you a safe and speedy journey in the Underworld.\" Hermes started to go, and then paused. \"I will try to be as fast as possible, but time moves even more oddly in the Underworld than it does on Olympus,\" he said without looking at her. \"Try to keep your mortal alive until then, even if his arrow-induced sentimentality makes you want to strangle him.\" Diana glanced at Bruce, but he had his head bowed as he fiddled with some of the dials in his jet. \"I'll do my best. Farewell, my lord,\" she said. Hermes sighed. \"Farewell, Princess Diana.\" Hephaestus greeted them with a snort. \"You've got good timing, I'll give you that much, little Amazon. The chalice has been complete for only a few hours.\" He studied Bruce for a second. \"Are you the mortal, then, that has brought the princess twice to my doorstep? You should learn to keep away from arrows, mortal.\" Bruce frowned. \"Or maybe someone should keep the arrows away from Aphrodite and Eros,\" he said. Hephaestus, much to Diana's surprise, laughed. \"You might be right about that. Zeus would never hear of it, though. 'Love is Aphrodite's domain.'\" The last sentence was a reasonable good imitation of Zeus, enough that Diana had to duck her head to hide a smile. \"Here it is,\" Hephaestus said, limping over to a cabinet. When he pulled the chalice from the cabinet, Diana gasped. Even Bruce let out a quiet sound of surprise. \"It's beautiful,\" Diana said. The chalice was finely wrought, made of varying types of gold, the white-gold words of power nearly blazing from their position around the mouth of the chalice. She took the chalice with reverent hands. \"A masterpiece.\" \"Yes, a masterpiece that will be used once to cure your mortal and then never used again,\" Hephaestus grumbled. \"I will not let such beauty be wasted,\" Diana promised. \"If it pleases you and if those words of power will not cause any problem, I will take it to my mother after Batman is cured, ask her to use it in ceremonies on Themyscira.\" Hephaestus grunted, but she thought she caught the flicker of a pleased smile on his face. \"I suppose that'll do,\" he said. Then he scowled. \"Were you expecting some ambrosia and a free gift? You've got what you came for, now leave me alone!\" The last word was a roar that made the ground tremble beneath their feet. \"Thank you for all you've done, Lord Hephaestus,\" Diana said quickly, and then seized Bruce around the waist and flew upward, out of the opening at the tip of the volcano. She landed lightly on the wing of Bruce's jet. \"Sorry,\" she said, immediately releasing him and stepping back as he strapped himself into the pilot's seat. \"I did not want to overstay our welcome.\" \"It's fine,\" Bruce said, busying himself with the board of flashing lights and dials. \"Where do we go next?\" Diana blinked, and then flushed as she realized she still hadn't explained things properly to him. \"Once Hermes has gotten the flower, we will have all the necessary ingredients. I will go to meet him at--\" \"I?\" Bruce said sharply. \"Don't think you're leaving me behind.\" \"The ingredients can only be blended together and blessed by Hestia, who resides upon Mount Olympus. You cannot go there.\" \"Then let me wait outside the gates,\" Bruce argued. Diana snorted. \"Now who's being unreasonable? Aphrodite will realize something's going on if she spots you lingering outside the gates of Mount Olympus. Go back to the Manor. I will bring the potion once it's complete.\" \"So what's left to complete the potion?\" Bruce said, not moving. Diana sighed. \"Nothing dangerous, I swear by Hera. Hestia needs to bless it, and then the chalice must be heated by a ride upon Apollo's chariot and then cooled by Artemis under the moonlight. Go home, Bruce, and keep the arrow and the necklace close to you.\" \"Diana,\" Bruce said quietly. His dark eyes met hers once more. \"Swear to me you'll come to the Manor as soon as the potion is ready.\" \"Of course I swear,\" Diana said. She looked at him for another moment, the muted longing in his eyes, how his gloved fingers drummed on the arm of his pilot seat in an agitated tempo. She resisted the urge to pull off his mask and smooth his rumpled hair away from his face, reassure him that all would be well. \"I will see you in a day or two, depending on how long Hermes takes. Wait at the Manor and let Robin and Huntress protect Gotham for a little while longer.\" Bruce nodded, and then the jet came to life in a rumble of sound. Diana flew back, watching the vapor trial long after the jet had disappeared from view. Then she sighed and turned for a third time to Mount Olympus. Hestia greeted her with a sympathetic cry. \"Oh, my poor dear!\" she exclaimed, throwing her arms around Diana's neck and nearly squeezing the life from her. \"Hera told me all about your troubles. I wonder at Aphrodite's wickedness, I truly do. I don't claim to understand men well, but from what Psyche has told me, your Batman was well on his way to falling in love with you in the natural way! Why did Aphrodite have to muddle things so?\" The torrent of words left Diana almost dizzy. \"Thank you for your kind words, my lady. Hermes has gone to fetch the last ingredient from the Underworld, and then we shall be ready for your blessing,\" she said. \"Of course, of course, but you must eat, child. You look as though you haven't eaten in days.\" \"I had a meal at Poseidon's palace,\" Diana said, but it was a faint protest as Hestia began to ladle something from a pot bubbling on her hearth. A draft brought the scents of carrots and meat to her nose, and her mouth began to water. \"Fresh vegetables from Demeter's garden, and rabbit caught by Artemis. I bet you've never tasted the like,\" Hestia announced, setting the bowl and a spoon on her table and gesturing for Diana to eat. Diana obeyed, nearly closing her eyes in bliss. The soup was indescribable--somehow Hestia had managed to blend the perfect balance of vegetables, meat, and spices. She ate the soup slowly, and didn't protest when Hestia pressed another steaming bowl upon her. \"There!\" Hestia said with satisfaction. \"That should put the lost weight back on your bones. You mustn't forget to eat, child, even when things go wrong. The strongest warrior cannot hope to defeat even the weakest if he's starving.\" Diana opened her mouth to thank her once more when the door to Hestia's house burst open and Hermes entered, red-faced. \"Nearly bumped into Aphrodite on my way here,\" he gasped, and offered his vial to Hestia before he collapsed into the nearest chair. \"Here, aunt, a flower that cannot compare to your beauty.\" \"Flatterer,\" Hestia said with a merry laugh. \"Now then, set the chalice and ingredients before me, and I'll make you your potion.\" Once the items were before her, Hestia arched an eyebrow. She tapped the vial containing the snake venom. \"Hera mentioned the ingredients were on the unusual side. I'm beginning to think she understated things. Athena says these ingredients blended together will cure your mortal?\" \"Yes, my lady,\" Diana said. \"All right then.\" Hestia rubbed her hands together. \"No particular order that they must be put into the chalice, correct?\" \"Athena didn't mention an order,\" Hermes said. Hestia nodded and bowed her head, both hands hovering over the chalice. \"I bless this chalice. May the potion created fulfill its purpose.\" She put the wine in first, then the pomegranate juice, then the water from the salt spring and the snake venom together at the same time. Then came the crushed olives and acorn together, then the grain, and finally the white Asphodel flower. Diana could not see into the chalice, but Hestia hummed in satisfaction, cupping the chalice in her hands and raising it towards her hearth. \"I bless this chalice and its contents,\" she said, repeating the words three times as she slowly shook the chalice and let the ingredients blend together. After she had finished the chant, she returned the chalice to the table. Now Diana could see that the potion had turned a deep pink. \"Shall I call Apollo and Artemis here for you?\" Hestia asked. \"Apollo is no doubt tending to his horses, so if you want him to take the chalice with him today, you'll want to get him now.\" \"Please,\" Diana said. \"I want Batman back to normal.\" Hestia clucked sympathetically. \"Of course you do, dear. Let me go and fetch them.\" When Hestia returned, the twins strode into the room as though they owned the place. They both had the appearances of youths, although Apollo's long hair was immaculate and Artemis's threaded with leaves and sticks. \"So this is the chalice,\" Apollo said, giving it a curious glance. \"Athena has outdone herself again.\" He looked a little sour, which was explained by the next words out of his mouth. \"I wonder why she couldn't figure out this cure when Ineeded it to undo Eros's use of the lead arrow upon my beloved.\" \"And which beloved was that?\" Artemis said dryly. \"You've had so many, I can't really recall faces or names.\" When her brother ignored her, Artemis turned to Diana. \"It's a pity you've been foolish enough to fall in love,\" she said bluntly. \"But I suppose if you had to fall for a man, that Batman is not a bad choice. He hunts his prey well.\" \"Thank you,\" Diana said, and glanced at Hermes for help. The god only grinned at her, unsympathetic with her plight. \"I had some of Hestia's soup. The rabbit you caught tasted wonderful.\" Artemis grinned in satisfaction, and then gave her brother a hard clout on the shoulder. \"Stop gawking at the chalice and sulking, and take it to your chariot! Unless you want the mortals to start panicking when the sun doesn't rise.\" \"I'm going, I'm going,\" Apollo said peevishly, \"if only to get away from you.\" The god snatched up the chalice and left. \"Tell your mother I will be visiting in a year or two,\" Artemis said. \"It has been too long since my maidens and I have hunted alongside the Amazons.\" \"I will,\" Diana promised. \"And I'm certain my mother will look forward to it.\" \"I'll bring the chalice back here once the potion's cooled,\" Artemis said, and left as abruptly as she'd entered. \"I'm afraid Artemis enjoys ignoring manners and politeness,\" Hestia said. \"Another bowl of soup?\" \"No, thank you. Those two bowls have been more than nourishing.\" \"Of course, of course,\" Hestia agreed. She surprised Diana with another hug. \"Now, don't mind me as you say good-bye to Hermes. I'll go see if Athena needs a meal.\" Once Hestia had bustled out the door, Hermes and Diana stood silently for a moment. \"Please pass along my gratitude to Eros and Psyche,\" she said. \"Please pass along my regret to Batman that I didn't see him in his natural habitat or state of mind,\" Hermes said, surprising Diana into only slightly bitter laughter. \"I will,\" she promised, and caught Hermes's hands in hers. \"Thank you for everything you did these past few days, my lord.\" Hermes tugged his hands away from hers, and then patted her gently on the head, being careful to avoid her tiara. \"Go well, princess. I look forward to our next meeting,\" he said. \"What makes you so certain there will be a next meeting?\" Diana asked, and Hermes laughed. \"You've spoken with Zeus, met the other eleven members of the Pantheon. Do you think the gods and goddesses will forget about the unusual little Amazon who demanded boons from them? If you thought your life was interesting now, Amazon, you have no idea.\" Diana sighed. \"Sometimes I long for a boring, uneventful life,\" she said. \"No, you don't,\" Hermes said. Diana smiled, thinking of the Justice League, how well Donna had looked on Themyscira, Bruce. \"No, I don't,\" she agreed. Being cooled by the moon had apparently turned the potion silver. Diana clutched the chalice to her chest as she took a deep breath and knocked on the door of the Manor. The door swung open after only a few seconds. Either Alfred was supernaturally fast or he'd been waiting next to the door. He bowed, the early morning light catching in his hair. \"Master Bruce said you might be arriving soon, Your Highness. Shall I take the chalice?\" She hesitated, but this was Alfred. She couldn't imagine him dropping anything in his life. \"It's the potion,\" she said, and watched his eyes widen for a second before the man resumed his neutral mask. \"I took the liberty of keeping the arrow and the necklace together in the Cave,\" he said. \"If you'll follow me....\" \"Where's Bruce?\" Diana asked when they got to the bottom of the stairs and it became apparent that Bruce was not there. \"On patrol, despite my misgivings,\" Alfred said, setting the chalice carefully down next to the necklace and the arrow. \"I will call him back to the Cave, if you'll excuse me for a moment. \"Go ahead,' Diana said absently, stepping closer to the arrow. She hadn't gotten a good look at it before, but now that it had been cleaned of blood and no longer embedded in Bruce's back, she could recognize Hephaestus's work. \"They will be here shortly. They were already returning home. Did you need anything, Your Highness? Tea? Biscuits?\" \"No,\" Diana assured him. \"I have been staying with Hestia, goddess of the hearth and meals for the past day. I have had enough food to last me a week.\" \"You should still take home some of Alfred's biscuits, Wonder Woman,\" Robin announced, entering the room with a grin. \"They're great.\" A hint of a smile lurked in Alfred's eyes. \"Thank you, Master Jason. Perhaps the princess will sample the biscuits another time. Right now, however, I think we all would prefer to have Master Bruce restored to his normal self.\" \"That's it?\" Bruce asked, peeling off his mask to reveal strained features puffy from lack of sleep. He frowned at the chalice. \"Interesting color.\" Diana dipped the arrow in the potion, watched as the liquid suddenly began to seethe and bubble. Once the liquid had subsided, Diana pulled the now-silver arrow from the chalice. \"Shall I administer the cure, or did you want to do the honors yourself?\" she asked, offering the arrow to him. Her hands did not tremble, though they very much wanted to. Bruce's lips twitched. \"I'll do it,\" he said. He pulled off his glove, exposing the pale underside of his arm. It was there he jabbed the point of the arrow in, grimacing and going a little pale, but otherwise not acknowledging his agony. The arrow dropped from his arm and Diana let it fall, reaching instead to steady Bruce as his eyes fluttered shut and he swayed on his feet. \"Bruce,\" she said quietly, cursing herself for lack of foresight. The original arrow had made Bruce collapse. Why wouldn't Athena's altered arrow do the same? \"Let me get you to a bed.\" \"No,\" he said hoarsely. \"I'm fine.\" He opened his eyes and smiled a little wryly. \"That arrow packs a punch, that's all.\" He showed her his wrist. \"At least it didn't scar.\" She was still holding his shoulders, she realized. She dropped her hands to her side and was taking a step back when Bruce's voice stopped her. \"Diana,\" he said quietly, meeting her eyes. Yes, that was the Bruce she knew-- no slavish devotion, just respect and a hint of stronger emotion lurking in his gaze. \"Give me a week?\" \"Only a week?\" Diana said, forcing a laugh. At least Bruce was no longer avoiding her gaze and did not seem quite as embarrassed as she thought he'd be. Perhaps he would not avoid her for too long. \"I would have thought you'd seen enough of my face to last you a month at least.\" \"Diana,\" Bruce said, sounding irritated. He pressed something into her hand. \"Keep this for me, please.\" Diana blinked and then looked down at her hand. Slowly she unfurled her fingers. There, nestled in her palm, was the tracker Bruce had stuck on one of her bracelets. \"What--\" \"So I can find you,\" Bruce said. When she tore her gaze away from the tracker, it was in time to see Bruce settling the necklace around his neck. \"Unless you don't want me to find you, of course,\" he added. It was his tone that caught her by the most surprise. It was a too-casual tone, the one used when someone was trying to feign indifference when they were anything but. She stared at him. \"What's going on?\" Robin whispered to Alfred. \"I believe we should give Her Highness and Master Bruce some privacy,\" was Alfred's only answer, and the man dragged a protesting Robin up the stairs and out of hearing range. \"Give me a week,\" Bruce repeated. He touched the necklace, readjusted it. His ears had gone pink, Diana noticed, such an appealing, vulnerable color that it was all she could do not to trace a finger around the edge of his ear. She watched him for a moment, almost in disbelief. This was almost too good to be true, but there was something in the tense way he held himself, as though he worried that either he or Diana would suddenly explode, made her believe he was earnest. She smiled and slowly attached the tracker to one of her bracelets. \"Bruce,\" she said, and something in her tone must have warned him, for he looked sharply at her. She took a step closer to him, and finally, finally allowed herself to reach out, pressing her hand to his cheek. He had shaved before going out on patrol, but already she could feel the scrape of a new beard against her hand. \"Come find me in a week, then. I might even apologize for trying to play prophetess.\" \"Diana,\" he said, but her name was breathed against her lips as she curled her hand around his neck and tugged him gently forward into a slow kiss full of promise. \"I will hold you to that one week,\" she said once she forced herself to end the kiss. Her lips tingled, and she watched in satisfaction as Bruce looked at her with half-lidded eyes and ran his tongue over his upper lip. \"If you haven't found me within seven days, Iwill find you,\" she added. Bruce smirked a little at that, mischief gleaming in his dark eyes. \"That sounds appealing, actually,\" he said. \"Be quiet,\" Diana commanded, and silenced his protests with another kiss.",

      "He tipped an imaginary hat towards her and added, \"You have a good night, now.",
      "Get a good night's rest.\"",
      "Diana climbed the steps to her room.",
      "True, she could have used the elevator, but she was staying on the third floor in this hotel.",
      "If she'd used that contraption, she would have had to endure a voice in the back of her head murmuring of sloth.",
      "(The voice tended to sound suspiciously like her mother's.)",
      "It had been a long couple of days, and Diana let herself into her room with a relieved sigh.",
      "She closed the door and leaned against it for a moment, closing her eyes and taking a deep breath.",
      "She'd have a nice long shower, she thought, and then perhaps allow herself to sleep in tomorrow morning.",
      "\"You look tired,\" someone observed; there was a half-amused, half-concerned note in the woman's voice.",
      "Diana's eyes snapped open.",
      "She instinctively shifted her footing to a defensive one.",
      "In the privacy of her own mind, she cursed a long string of invectives that would have made Wally blush, Clark frown, and Bruce smirk.",
      "When had she grown so complacent?",
      "Her room had been occupied and she hadn't even noticed, had stood there like an oblivious fool while this intruder could have attacked her.",
      "Now that she was actually paying attention, she could feel another person's presence in the room, hear the faint sound of someone else's breathing.",
      "\"Who's there?\" she demanded.",
      "Her gaze swept the room, but there was no one in plain view.",
      "The door to the bathroom was wide open--someone could have been hiding behind the shower curtain, but the voice had sounded as though it were coming from the empty bed.",
      "\"Show yourself,\" she said, voice harsh.",
      "\"What?\"",
      "The intruder sounded puzzled now.",
      "\"Diana, I--oh, I'm sorry.",
      "I forgot I was veiled.\"",
      "There was a flustered burst of laughter, and then a familiar form shimmered into sight, reclining regally on Diana's bed and arching a pair of delicate eyebrows at her.",
      "Diana stared, not relaxing from her defensive position.",
      "This had to be a trick of some sort.",
      "\"Psyche?",
      "What brings you here?\"",
      "She frowned, wracking her brain, but she could not think of what would bring Psyche to Man's World, much less to Diana's hotel room.",
      "\"Is something wrong on Mount Olympus?",
      "Is Eros in danger?\" Psyche held up a hand and Diana bit back the half-dozen questions caught in her throat.",
      "\"Diana, calm yourself,\" Psyche said gently.",
      "\"Olympus is well, if you consider being dreadfully boring well, and my beloved is fine.\"",
      "Despite her words, a small frown twisted the goddess's full lips, a slight crease on her forehead marring her otherwise perfect features.",
      "Psyche had been attractive before Zeus had made her a goddess, of course, but she had been beautiful in the way that mortals were beautiful, with a fragile, fleeting loveliness.",
      "Now she had the impossible beauty of an immortal.",
      "\"Then what is wrong?\" Diana asked.",
      "\"I mean no offense, but I doubt you came for a social visit.\"",
      "\"No, I did not,\" Psyche agreed, still frowning.",
      "\"I have come to warn you.\"",
      "\"To warn me?\" Diana echoed.",
      "She thought quickly, imagining the type of threat that would bring Psyche of all the deities to warn her.",
      "Surely Hermes would have been more appropriate, as messenger of the gods.",
      "\"Is Hades--\" \"This has nothing to do with Hades, I'm afraid, and everything to do with Aphrodite,\" said Psyche.",
      "Diana's heart pounded a quick, agitated beat in her breast.",
      "For all that many mortals thought of Aphrodite as a tender goddess concerned only with bringing lovers together, all Amazons knew better.",
      "Aphrodite was a callous, narcissistic goddess who amused herself by forcing love upon those who didn't want it, who caused atrocities like the Trojan War through her vanity, who brought mighty Amazons such as Antiope to her knees for the pure thrill of it.",
      "No Amazon held love for Aphrodite in her heart.",
      "And indeed, Aphrodite was no friend to the Amazons.",
      "\"And what is Aphrodite planning that would bring you down from Mount Olympus and to my doorstep?\"",
      "Diana asked quietly.",
      "Psyche sighed, brushing her long dark hair away from her face and fixing Diana with a grim look.",
      "\"She has grown bored of late.",
      "Before, she was entertained by the antics of politicians and Hollywood.",
      "Breaking up marriages and causing unlikely love affairs seem to have lost their flavor.",
      "Now she turns to a more difficult challenge--you and the one called Batman.\"",
      "\"Me and the--me and Batman,\" Diana echoed, and her heart gave another little jump.",
      "Diana felt weak all over, her head spinning, her heart pounding loudly in her ears.",
      "\"Psyche,\" she breathed, horror making it nearly impossible to speak.",
      "The words caught and tore at her throat as though they were slivers of glass.",
      "\"Tell me she has not used Eros's arrows, tell me she has not done this abomination to B--\" The last time she had seen Bruce he had appeared his normal self, but that meant nothing.",
      "Bruce could have been pricked by one of Eros's arrows at anytime, could be hopelessly in love with her and never let it color the timber of his voice or reach his pale eyes.",
      "He could have been suffering in silence for months and she never would have known.",
      "Diana thought, stricken, of the conversation they had had before Circe had interrupted them.",
      "\"I'm a rich kid with issues - lots of issues.\"",
      "Had he been hiding his feelings for her then, masquerading behind his dark sense of humor?",
      "Had that kiss in the restaurant, the occasional intense look she'd caught from him over the years, all been brought about by Aphrodite's effort?",
      "\"She has not used the arrows,\" Psyche said, and Diana breathed easier.",
      "Psyche's eyes gleamed bright with mischief as she added, \"She had planned upon using them, but it seems Eros has somehow misplaced his bow and arrows.",
      "Aphrodite is furious at his carelessness.\"",
      "Diana managed a smile at that, weak though it was.",
      "She took in a deep, calming breath, and then another, until her heart settled back into a more natural rhythm.",
      "Her mind raced, thinking and discarding her options at quicksilver speed.",
      "\"I shall go to Themyscira at once,\" she said.",
      "Psyche looked puzzled.",
      "\"Forgive me, but what can your mother do that one of the gods cannot?",
      "I assumed you would ask Athena to protect your Batman, and Hera to protect you.\"",
      "\"And so I shall,\" Diana said, deciding it wasn't the time to correct Psyche about the 'your Batman' remark.",
      "\"But my mother has a necklace given to her from Zeus himself, which protects any mortal from a god or goddess's attentions so long as the mortal wears it.",
      "If she will let me borrow it, I shall give it to B-Batman.",
      "He, at least, will be safe from Aphrodite's mischief.\"",
      "She stumbled over Bruce's name--doubtless, Psyche knew full well who Batman truly was, but Diana would not dishonor Bruce's demand for privacy by telling his name to anyone, not even to a goddess she considered a friend.",
      "Psyche tilted her head, looking intrigued.",
      "\"How did Hippolyta come by this necklace?",
      "I have not heard the tale.\"",
      "\"It happened long ago, before I was born,\" Diana said with a small shrug.",
      "\"My mother would not tell me all the details, but she aided Zeus somehow, and the necklace was her reward.",
      "Not many know of it, but the necklace has been used throughout the centuries.",
      "Aeneas wore it when he fled Troy, though he lost it sometime during his journey and a naiad returned it to Mother.\"",
      "She smiled.",
      "\"The story of the necklace is as lost to history as the tale of your time on Themyscira.\"",
      "Psyche laughed.",
      "\"That is sad.",
      "The task Aphrodite assigned me on your island was the easiest of the five, thanks in no small way to your help.",
      "It would have been enjoyable, even, had I not been worried I would never see my beloved Eros again.\"",
      "\"Perhaps that is why the tale was lost.",
      "It was far less exciting than the other tasks,\" Diana said wryly.",
      "\"Easy tasks make for less interesting legends.\"",
      "Psyche smiled.",
      "\"I believe you're right.\"",
      "Then her features darkened once more.",
      "\"I would accompany you to Themyscira if I could,\" she said softly, earnestness writ stark upon her face, \"but I already linger too long here.",
      "Should Aphrodite realize I told you of her plans, she would be furious.",
      "My peace with her is tentative at best--I do not wish to invoke her ire.",
      "She is already angry enough at Eros.\"",
      "Her dark green eyes were solemn.",
      "\"Aphrodite will use every power against you once she learns you are trying to thwart her plans.",
      "Be careful, Diana.",
      "I cannot stand openly against my beloved's mother, no matter how much I disagree with her, not if I want some small measure of peace upon Olympus.",
      "Eros and I have done what we could, but we must stand aside from now on.\"",
      "\"I understand,\" said Diana.",
      "She took Psyche's hands in hers and squeezed them.",
      "\"I thank you, Psyche.",
      "With this knowledge, I have at least a hope of preventing Aphrodite's mischief.\"",
      "Psyche tugged her hands out of Diana's grasp, and then enveloped the Amazon in an embrace.",
      "Diana closed her eyes and breathed in.",
      "Psyche smelled strongly of sunlight, and faintly of nectar, as though she had been sipping at a drink when Aphrodite had announced her plans.",
      "Had it really been over two millennia since Psyche had come to Themyscira, a young woman determined to do whatever it took to find her immortal lover?",
      "The two princesses, one mortal, one not, had had such an adventure together.",
      "In times of discontent, Diana still savored the memory of Aphrodite's astonished expression, as well as the goddess's poorly concealed fury when Psyche had succeeded in her fourth task.",
      "\"Diana,\" Psyche whispered, nectar-sweet breath warm on her ear.",
      "\"Answer me one question before I go.\"",
      "Diana suppressed the urge to shiver at the sensation.",
      "Sweet Hera, but Diana had been young then, and as prone to infatuation as any youth.",
      "She had loved Psyche with a quiet, hopeless passion, knowing that Psyche's heart belonged only to her beloved god.",
      "That had been a long time ago, however, and Diana's heart was less foolish now.",
      "Though no less fixated upon impossible persons, she thought deprecatingly.",
      "\"Whatever you ask, I will answer as well as I can,\" she said.",
      "\"Diana,\" Psyche said again.",
      "She sounded almost tentative, an unusual note indeed to hear in a goddess's voice.",
      "\"I know Aphrodite means this for her own amusement, and that you would not have her meddling in your relationship with Batman and invoking unnatural feelings, but...you docare for him, do you not?\" Diana didn't speak for a long moment.",
      "Were her feelings so obvious then, to be so easily read upon her face?",
      "Psyche had only visited her for a few minutes, and yet she'd already uncovered Diana's sentiment.",
      "She should be careful in the future--not only goddesses were interested in uncovering any weakness of Batman's.",
      "Batman had far too many enemies for her to be so careless.",
      "\"I do,\" she said quietly into the silence.",
      "A wry smile tugged at her lips.",
      "\"And I believe he feels the same.\"",
      "\"Then why have you not--\" \"Batman desires for our relationship to remain professional, and I will abide by his wishes.\"",
      "No matter how wrong Diana thought Bruce was in denying his feelings, she was not going to allow Aphrodite to turn Bruce's emotions upon him, to strip away his defenses and sully their relationship by use of Eros's arrows or any other unnatural means.",
      "She would bring Bruce around to her point-of-view in her own time, not through Aphrodite's interference.",
      "She let her head rest briefly upon Psyche's shoulder and confided, \"Sometimes I wonder if Batman has the blood of a god flowing through his veins.",
      "He is certainly as stubborn as one.\"",
      "Psyche laughed.",
      "\"Like calls to like, I suppose.\"",
      "When Diana raised her head to question the goddess, Psyche laughed again, the sound as sweet as silver bells.",
      "\"Do not look so puzzled, Diana.",
      "You are just as obstinate.\"",
      "Diana wavered for a second between an offended frown and a wry smile.",
      "She settled on the latter, since Psyche's declaration was not entirelywithout merit.",
      "\"I suppose my mother would agree with you,\" she said.",
      "\"Speaking of your mother, do not forget to give Hippolyta my blessings,\" Psyche said.",
      "She released Diana, stepping back and smiling.",
      "\"And extend those blessings to all on Themyscira.",
      "Eros and I will never forget your assistance.\"",
      "\"I will.",
      "Psyche, it was good to see you,\" Diana said sincerely.",
      "\"It has been far too long since you visited Themyscira.",
      "Please know that you are always welcome.\"",
      "\"Perhaps I will visit once Aphrodite has set her attentions upon some other unfortunate mortal,\" Psyche said with a bitter twist of her lips.",
      "She caught one of Diana's hands in hers once more, gave it a brief squeeze before she released it.",
      "\"Be well, Diana.",
      "Good luck.\"",
      "The goddess's form flickered, guttering like a candle for a brief instant, seemingly in and out of existence.",
      "Then the goddess vanished and a butterfly fluttered before Diana.",
      "The bright moonlight dappled the goddess's wings silver, but Diana knew that the wings were all the colors of the rainbow.",
      "She had seen the goddess's guise before, the colors glowing bright under Apollo's sun when Psyche had returned briefly to Themyscira to tell Diana and the other Amazons of her newly granted deification.",
      "\"Be well, and give Eros my thanks,\" said Diana, and opened the window to let Psyche out.",
      "Psyche flew swiftly out into the night air.",
      "Diana leaned out the window, watching long after the goddess had disappeared from view.",
      "Then she sighed, closing the window and letting her head rest briefly against the cool glass.",
      "Hera help her, there was no time to hesitate, no matter how weary she felt.",
      "She had no way to know how quickly Aphrodite would discover where Eros had concealed his quiver of arrows or that Psyche had warned her.",
      "Sleep could wait.",
      "Diana would rest once the necklace was safely around Bruce's neck.",
      "She raised her head with effort, and tapped her earpiece.",
      "\"J'onn?\" she said.",
      "There was a momentary stretch of silence, and then the Martian's deep voice filled her ears.",
      "\"Yes, Diana, I am here.\"",
      "\"I wish to be put on the inactive list for the time being,\" she said, and then hurried on before J'onn could ask what was wrong.",
      "\"I need to visit Themyscira.\"",
      "J'onn paused, and although she knew he would not scan her mind without her permission, she nevertheless carefully blanked out her thoughts, focusing on her longing to see her mother, her desire to breathe in the air of Themyscira and rejoin her sisters for a brief time.",
      "\"Very well,\" J'onn said.",
      "Not for the first time, she was grateful for J'onn's understanding of the need for privacy.",
      "\"Do you know how long you will be away?\" Diana frowned at her own reflection in the window.",
      "Her strained features stared silently back.",
      "\"I am uncertain.",
      "Hopefully I will be able to resolve things in a few days,\" she said.",
      "\"I will contact you as soon as I am able.\"",
      "\"I will inform the others that you are visiting Themyscira and do not wish to be disturbed,\" J'onn said.",
      "\"Farewell, Diana.\"",
      "The thought came to her that perhaps this was a true goodbye.",
      "Aphrodite did not take kindly to her plans falling apart, after all, and even Hera and Artemis could not always protect their beloved Amazons.",
      "Antiope was proof enough of that.",
      "This might well be the last time she spoke to J'onn or heard his deep, calm voice in her ears or mind.",
      "She shook her head, banishing the morbid thought.",
      "\"Farewell, J'onn,\" Diana said softly, and ended the connection.",
      "She started to turn the earpiece off, and then hesitated.",
      "Should she contact Bruce, warn him?",
      "She frowned.",
      "How could she explain that the goddess of love had taken an interest in them without embarrassing them both?",
      "And besides, what could she tell him?",
      "Be wary of arrows?",
      "She scoffed a little at the idea.",
      "Furthermore, once Bruce learned of Aphrodite's plans, he would insist on stopping her himself, which could only lead to worse trouble.",
      "Still, she could not leave him completely ignorant.",
      "She pressed a button upon her earpiece and said, \"Code 21A, Wonder Woman to Batman.\"",
      "There was a long pause, a full minute passing before the earpiece crackled with static.",
      "\"Princess,\" Bruce said, his voice a low rumble in her ears.",
      "\"I saw the news about your work with The Flash.",
      "Already bored?\"",
      "She smiled.",
      "\"Why, do you need some help in Gotham?\" she asked, teasing.",
      "He didn't rise to her bait, which was just as well.",
      "Had he invited her to Gotham she would have known something was definitely wrong and that Aphrodite had done somethingto him; Bruce would have to be on his last legs or in equally dire straights to invite any of the other members of the Justice League into Gotham.",
      "She and Clark had found that asking for forgiveness rather than permission was far easier when it came to Bruce and entering his city.",
      "\"No, I'm calling to warn you,\" she continued.",
      "\"Apparently some of the gods on Mount Olympus are growing bored, and might resume meddling in the mortal realm.",
      "I am going to Themyscira to see if my mother can intervene, but Gotham seems to be of particular interest to them.",
      "I thought you would appreciate the heads up.\"",
      "\"The gods are interested in Gotham,\" Bruce muttered.",
      "\"Have you noticed, Princess, that you never call me when it's goodnews?\" Diana laughed.",
      "Despite her anxiety, she felt herself relax a little at Bruce's familiar sarcasm.",
      "\"And you constantly call me up to gossip over John and Vixen's relationship, of course,\" she said, voice warm with amusement.",
      "\"Do you know which gods in particular?\" Bruce asked.",
      "His tone darkened as he asked, \"Circe isn't back, is she?\"",
      "Diana hesitated, wondering how honest she could be with him.",
      "\"I am still investigating, but I know that Aphrodite has turned her eye to your city,\" she said slowly.",
      "\"The goddess of love is interested in Gotham,\" Bruce said, incredulous.",
      "\"Apparently Gotham is more interesting than Hollywood,\" Diana said.",
      "Her face warmed.",
      "Suddenly she was glad that Bruce could not see her.",
      "One look at her flushed cheeks and he would have known that she was concealing something.",
      "Her mother had always said she was a terrible liar.",
      "\"Be careful,\" she cautioned him.",
      "\"Aphrodite doesn't play fair.\"",
      "\"I've read a few myths,\" Bruce said, tone dry.",
      "\"Trust me, the part where Aphrodite offering Paris a married woman helped to spark the Trojan War did not go unnoticed.\"",
      "Diana smiled.",
      "Well, this conversation was going better than expected.",
      "Bruce didn't seem inclined to insult Aphrodite to her face and get himself cursed or killed before Diana could get the necklace.",
      "\"Give my regards to Alfred and Robin,\" she said.",
      "Despite her better judgment, she wished for a moment that she could see him.",
      "No doubt his features would be concealed behind his cowl, but that wouldn't hide the glimmer in his eyes or the smirk on his lips.",
      "\"And...be careful.",
      "I'll be back as soon as I can.\"",
      "\"I can take care of myself,\" he said, sounding a little amused.",
      "\"You can take care of yourself against Gotham's villains.",
      "You haven't gone up against a goddess before,\" Diana reminded him.",
      "The words came out sharper than she intended, and she grimaced.",
      "It was usually easy to forget that Bruce was mortal, that he relied on his intelligence and skills rather than super-powers to fight crime, but right now she couldn't help but remember how he had felt in her arms when they'd danced--not fragile by any means, but warm and alive and oh so mortal.",
      "\"A word of advice,\" she said, attempting to sound as though she were teasing him.",
      "\"Don't do your 'I am the protector of Gotham and you are not welcome' speech to Aphrodite.",
      "She takes offense easily.\"",
      "\"Princess,\" Bruce said, and stopped.",
      "\"Diana,\" he said, in an entirely different tone, one dark and almost angry.",
      "Oh yes, that was definitely his Batman voice.",
      "\"You know, you would make for an awful poker player.\"",
      "Diana blinked, thrown by the apparent non-sequitur.",
      "\"Excuse me?\"",
      "\"You can't keep your temper when it matters,\" he said, the words enough of a rebuke that she found herself flushing in a mixture of anger and embarrassment.",
      "\"Now, explain what's really going on, or I will tell J'onn that you're under mind control and force him to tell me your coordinates.\"",
      "Diana sighed a little.",
      "\"That was not one of your better threats,\" she said, striving for a light tone even as she began to pace the hotel room.",
      "\"Besides, we both know that you are well aware of where I am.",
      "You selected this hotel room for me, after all.\"",
      "The evasion fell flat, and she grimaced once more.",
      "\"Tell me what's going on,\" Bruce snapped.",
      "\"I can't work with half-truths, Diana.",
      "I need to know everything.\"",
      "\"Is this a secure line?\" Diana began.",
      "\"It's secure enough,\" Bruce said, and that was when Diana realized that he was worried.",
      "\"I,\" she began and stopped, closing her eyes and trying to organize her thoughts.",
      "This line might be secure, but with the gods involved, who knew who could possibly be listening in on their conversation.",
      "Finally, she said, in the most even voice she could muster, \"Aphrodite is no friend to the Amazons.",
      "It seems she has decided to entertain herself by using Eros's arrows upon us.\"",
      "\"Eros's arrows,\" Bruce repeated flatly.",
      "\"Those would be the ones that make people fall in love.\"",
      "\"Yes,\" Diana said.",
      "\"Fortunately, Eros's quiver seems to be lost for the moment, so she has not succeeded in her plan.",
      "I am doing what I can to stop Aphrodite--\" \"Do you expect me to sit and twiddle my fingers while you stop her?\" Bruce asked.",
      "She couldn't figure out his current tone, if he was acting as Batman now, furious over her attempt at deceit, or as Bruce, concerned and worried.",
      "\"No, I expect you to protect Gotham and trust me to handle this myself,\" Diana said.",
      "At least Bruce had not demanded to go to Mount Olympus and speak to Aphrodite personally.",
      "She pictured Batman on Olympus, staring up at Zeus with an unimpressed expression and his arms folded against his chest.",
      "Despite herself, a faint smile twitched at one corner of her mouth.",
      "She continued, \"I have more experience with the gods than you do.\"",
      "\"I've studied more than the Iliad, Diana.",
      "I know what Aphrodite's done to the Amazons over the millennia,\" Bruce said.",
      "\"Yes, well, if I have my way, my name won't be linked to Antiope or Hippolytus,\" Diana said.",
      "\"Be safe, Batman.",
      "I will contact you once I've resolved things.\"",
      "\"Diana,\" he said, but the rest of his words were cut off in a crackle of static as she turned off the earpiece.",
      "She took it from her ear, turning it over in her fingers and studying it.",
      "She waited a moment, but apparently Bruce wasn't resorting to contacting J'onn, for the Martian's voice did not invade her mind.",
      "After a moment she sighed and tucked the earpiece into her belt.",
      "She'd turn it on again once she had spoken to Mother and retrieved the necklace.",
      "Diana glanced around the room, but there was little here to call her own.",
      "She had some civilian clothes in the dresser and a few bathroom essentials, all easily discarded.",
      "It was the matter of a minute to gather the items and the room key and take them to the front desk.",
      "\"Ms. Prince?\" Marco blinked at her, and she wondered what sort of expression she must be wearing to have earned that concerned frown.",
      "\"Is everything all right?\"",
      "\"I'm leaving a little bit earlier than expected,\" she explained, smoothing out her expression into a polite smile.",
      "\"Could you see that these are donated to a local shelter?",
      "I won't need them where I'm going.\"",
      "Marco's frown deepened.",
      "\"Are you sure you're all right?",
      "You look....\" He trailed off and flushed, ducking his head.",
      "\"Never mind.",
      "It's none of my business.",
      "I'll make certain they get donated to a shelter.\"",
      "\"Thank you,\" Diana said, and took her leave of him.",
      "The sun was just beginning to rise over the island when Diana landed on Themyscira's shore.",
      "The sky was colored all manner of pale pinks and reds, and Diana smiled at the sight of it.",
      "Salt stung her lips faintly as she took in a deep breath.",
      "Home, a quiet voice whispered in the back of her mind, and a weight she hadn't previously realized existed seemed to vanish from her shoulders.",
      "Home.",
      "Surely things would go well now that she was back on the island.",
      "Mother would present the necklace without objection to save a protector of Man's World, and Diana would go to Gotham, and Bruce would be safe from Aphrodite and all her plots.",
      "\"Please, Hera, let it be simple,\" Diana prayed, bowing her head.",
      "\"Diana!\"",
      "Harmothoe all but flew across the beach to enfold her in her arms.",
      "Her normally grave face was bright with joy.",
      "\"The queen did not tell us you were visiting!\"",
      "Despite her worries, Diana smiled back and returned the embrace.",
      "\"Harmothoe!",
      "It is good to see you.",
      "And the queen couldn't have told you to expect me, for she doesn't know I am here.",
      "I need to speak with her, urgently.\"",
      "Harmothoe held her at arm's length, a worried gleam creeping back into her dark eyes.",
      "\"Is something amiss, Your Highness?\" she asked, formality and concern sharpening the words.",
      "\"Aphrodite seeks to harm Batman, one of the warriors who aided me when Themyscira was attacked,\" Diana said.",
      "\"I have come to ask Mother for Zeus's necklace, to shield him from her tricks.\"",
      "Harmothoe's eyes widened; first shock and then understanding bloomed on her features.",
      "\"Zeus's necklace,\" she murmured.",
      "\"Now that is something I haven't heard mention of in quite some time.\"",
      "The warrior released Diana and knelt to retrieve her fallen spear.",
      "\"Let me escort you to the queen.",
      "She will be at Hera's temple.\"",
      "The morning hymn had just ended as Diana and Harmothoe entered.",
      "Their fellow Amazons were just beginning to disperse to their daily tasks, but a few spotted Diana and let out cries of surprised delight.",
      "Many of the women, catching sight of Diana, flocked to her.",
      "Over their heads, Diana could see her mother beginning to make her way down from her pedestal, moving with slow certainty.",
      "Donna pushed through the crowd to throw small arms around Diana's waist, giggling and sniffling at the same time.",
      "The past few years had been good to the girl; her cheeks were flushed with good health, and none of the grief and terror Diana remembered from the fire shadowed her eyes.",
      "\"Diana!",
      "Diana!",
      "I missed you!",
      "Are you staying?\" Donna asked, bouncing a little on the balls of her feet.",
      "She looked disappointed when Diana shook her head.",
      "\"Are you at least staying tonight?",
      "We could hold a feast!\"",
      "Pitane said hopefully, her smile dimming as Diana was once again forced to shake her head in denial.",
      "She ignored the sudden twinge in her belly reminding her that she hadn't eaten since yesterday morning.",
      "\"The Batman is in danger from Aphrodite,\" Harmothoe explained, leaning on her spear and wearing a somber frown.",
      "\"The princess has little time to prevent Aphrodite's mischief.",
      "She must speak to the queen immediately.\"",
      "Pitane and Cynna exchanged alarmed glances.",
      "\"Aphrodite?\" they said together.",
      "\"Who's she?",
      "And why does she want to hurt Batman?",
      "He's a good guy!\"",
      "Donna said, her sweet voice puzzled.",
      "A few of the women shot the child startled looks before understanding softened their expressions.",
      "Of course Donna would not know of the acrimonious history between the goddess and the denizens of Themyscira.",
      "She was not Amazon by birth; Diana had brought her to the island only five years ago, having saved the girl from a fire at an orphanage in Man's World.",
      "\"Aphrodite,\" snarled another familiar voice.",
      "Grief thousands of years old touched Lysippe's voice as she pushed to the forefront of the crowd.",
      "She pressed her hand to the hilt of her sword and declared roughly, \"Your Highness, if you need aid, I will stand with you against Aphrodite.",
      "I--\" \"Hold, Lysippe,\" Diana said softly.",
      "Sympathy made her choose her next words with careful precision.",
      "\"I cannot make an obvious stand against Aphrodite, not if I value Themyscira's safety.",
      "I can only hope to thwart her by slyer means and keep her wrath at bay.\"",
      "Lysippe's face had darkened in disappointment and disbelief as Diana's words had registered.",
      "Now she made a harsh noise in the back of her throat that could have been a laugh were it not for the fury in the sound.",
      "\"By craven means, you mean,\" she snapped.",
      "\"And meanwhile Aphrodite continues her offenses against our island, with not even our princess brave enough to speak against her--\" \"Lysippe, you forget yourself,\" Pitane said sharply, and several of the others nodded in agreement, their expressions varying from angry to sorrowful to compassionate.",
      "Donna looked from face to face, her mouth puckering in dismay at the obvious anger and tension in the air.",
      "\"You will speak to the princess with respect, or you will answer for your words.\"",
      "Diana shook her head.",
      "She rested a gentle hand on Donna's head and gave it a reassuring pat for the poor child looked to be near tears.",
      "The girl leaned against her, resting her full weight against Diana's knee.",
      "Donna mumbled something too low to understand, but it had a plaintive tone to it.",
      "Doubtless she wanted them to stop fighting.",
      "\"Peace, Pitane,\" Diana said.",
      "\"Let Lysippe speak.",
      "Themyscira is not a place to dictate anyone's thoughts or words.\"",
      "\"Now that I have your permission to speak freely,\" Lysippe said, her words dripping with bitter sarcasm, \"I will say it: how long must I wait for vengeance for my son?",
      "You and your mother do nothing while Aphrodite makes sport of us.\"",
      "Her voice rose.",
      "\"Aphrodite turned Antiope over to Theseus's cruelty, forced my son to--\" She choked on the words, and turned away, but not before Diana had seen the tears in her eyes.",
      "\"Lysippe,\" she said quietly.",
      "She reached out her free hand, then hesitated, uncertain if the gesture would be welcomed or rejected.",
      "\"Lysippe, I am sorry for your loss, but I cannot bring a goddess to justice.",
      "If I brought her before Zeus and demanded an apology for Tanais and Antiope--\" And Hippolytus and Areto and Pantariste and all the others killed or harmed to provide Aphrodite some amusement,she didn't add, but the faces and names seemed to hang in the air nonetheless.",
      "\"--I would be laughed from Mount Olympus.\"",
      "\"We are immortal, but we are not gods, Lysippe,\" Diana's mother said.",
      "Diana had not heard her approach, but the others took a step back and allowed the queen to walk up to Lysippe and press a hand to her shoulder.",
      "\"We cannot rebuke the gods, no matter how we may wish to.\"",
      "Lysippe shrugged off the queen's hand.",
      "\"Cowards,\" she said thickly, and then repeated herself louder, spitting out the word, \"Cowards.\"",
      "She walked away from them, out of the temple and into the sunlight, her shoulders braced against her sorrow.",
      "Cynna sighed.",
      "\"Please excuse Lysippe's words, Your Majesty.",
      "I do not think even another two millennia could ease her grief over Tanais.",
      "I will go and speak sense to her.\"",
      "She waited for the queen's nod of assent and then hurried after Lysippe.",
      "There was a moment of silence, and then the queen said, \"Did I hear correctly?",
      "Batman is in danger from Aphrodite?\"",
      "\"Yes,\" Diana said.",
      "She kept her hand upon Donna's head, for the girl did not seem inclined to move.",
      "\"I need the necklace, the one that Zeus gave you--\"",
      "She stopped, for her mother's expression had tightened, something like dismay widening her eyes.",
      "\"Mother?\"",
      "\"I do not have it,\" her mother said.",
      "Diana's heart sank.",
      "\"The last time the necklace was used, it was damaged and I sent it to Hephaestus for repairs.\"",
      "The queen frowned.",
      "\"To be honest, I haven't thought of it in centuries.",
      "We have seen so few outsiders in the past thousand years that we have had no need of it.\"",
      "Diana pressed her free hand to her lips, trying to think.",
      "It was not the disaster it seemed at first, she told herself; she would simply have to make another trip.",
      "\"I will go to his forge, then,\" she said.",
      "\"What payment did you promise him?\"",
      "\"No payment,\" her mother said with a shake of her head.",
      "\"It was he who created that necklace at Zeus's request.",
      "He considered it an insult to his craftsmanship that I had somehow managed to damage it.\"",
      "\"That will make things a little easier,\" Diana murmured.",
      "\"I am sorry, Mother, but I must go.",
      "I do not know how long Eros's arrows can remain concealed, nor do I know how long it might be before Aphrodite loses patience and uses some other means to distort Batman's mind.\"",
      "\"Diana,\" her mother said, stopping her speech with a touch to her arm.",
      "\"Before you go, I would speak with you in private.\"",
      "Her gaze flickered to the onlookers; most took the hint and began dispersing.",
      "\"It will take but a moment,\" she added when Diana hesitated.",
      "\"Of course,\" Diana said, and the other Amazons bowed to her and left, many shooting concerned glances over their shoulders as they exited the temple.",
      "Only Donna remained, her cheek pressed firmly against Diana's leg.",
      "After a moment, Diana sighed and tugged her away.",
      "She knelt on the smooth marble floor, meeting Donna's reddened eyes.",
      "\"Why's Lysippe so mad?\" Donna asked, sniffling.",
      "Diana bit back another sigh.",
      "How to explain without giving the child more nightmares?",
      "Donna was too young to hear of that particular atrocity.",
      "\"A long time ago, Lysippe had a son named Tanais.",
      "Aphrodite did something that...\" \"That killed Tanais,\" her mother supplied when Diana faltered, uncertain of how to phrase it in delicate terms.",
      "\"Oh.\"",
      "Donna digested this for a moment.",
      "She looked puzzled.",
      "\"Then aren't you going to punish Aphrodite?\"",
      "Diana shook her head.",
      "\"Aphrodite is a goddess, child.",
      "That makes things complicated.\"",
      "\"If the goddess did a bad thing and made Lysippe cry, then you should punish her,\" Donna said, a stubborn note creeping into her voice.",
      "Diana recognized that particular expression well; it was the look of an eight-year-old who wasn't going to take no for an answer.",
      "\"You're Wonder Woman.\"",
      "Diana resisted the urge to wince.",
      "\"Donna,\" she said quietly.",
      "The explanation that she was not infallible for all her gifts died on her lips at her mother's firm words.",
      "\"I will explain why Diana cannot punish her later, Donna.",
      "Now you must go see Pitane.",
      "It's time to meditate.\"",
      "\"But--\" Donna began to protest.",
      "\"Now,\" the queen said, the command ringing through the temple.",
      "\"What is it, Mother?\" Diana asked after Donna, sulking and still bewildered, throwing half-accusing glances over her small shoulder, had left.",
      "\"You mentioned Eros's arrows,\" her mother said softly.",
      "\"Aphrodite plans to use them upon you and Batman?\"",
      "Diana fought back a blush.",
      "Hera help her, was she going to have to explain their relationship to her mother as she'd explained it to Psyche?",
      "She had hoped to have this conversation-- well, never, if she were completely honest.",
      "\"Yes,\" she said.",
      "\"Psyche told me that only Eros concealing his bow and arrows prevented Aphrodite from doing so earlier.",
      "That is why I must have the necklace, Mother.",
      "I cannot let Aphrodite pervert Batman's feelings in such a way.\"",
      "Her mother wetted her lips with her tongue briefly.",
      "\"The golden arrows force unnatural love upon those they strike, so that the wounded man or woman falls in love with the next person he or she sees,\" she said.",
      "\"What do the arrows do if the wounded person is already in love?\"",
      "\"Mother?\" asked Diana, blinking in confusion.",
      "Why was her mother asking things that Diana had learned as a child?",
      "She bit her lower lip.",
      "\"It destroys that tenderness, forces that person to love whoever they've just seen rather than the person they truly do care about--\" \"You misunderstand me,\" the queen said.",
      "\"What if the wounded person is already in love with the next person he sees?\"",
      "\"I-- I don't know,\" Diana said.",
      "She frowned.",
      "Had that ever happened before?",
      "\"But Mother, even if he does love me, he is unwilling to admit it.",
      "I would not have Aphrodite force a confession from his lips.\"",
      "\"No, you would rather have him willingly tell you his feelings,\" Hippolyta said with a shrewd look.",
      "Diana flushed and didn't rise to the bait.",
      "\"I suspect that the golden arrow would make his feelings consume him.",
      "I would not want him devoted to me like some lovesick fool.\"",
      "She grimaced at the thought of Bruce looking at her with a besotted expression and murmuring sweet endearments.",
      "After a moment, her mother said, \"Be careful, Diana.",
      "Get to Hephaestus's forge, quickly.",
      "My prayers go with you.\"",
      "\"Thank you,\" she said, and briefly embraced her mother.",
      "\"After this is over, I shall come home for a longer visit, enjoy that feast Pitane was so eager to have.\"",
      "\"I look forward to it,\" the queen said, a look in her eyes that Diana couldn't quite read.",
      "Diana could hear Hephaestus long before she could see him.",
      "The staccato beat of his hammer made the volcano shudder beneath her feet.",
      "No doubt a few mortal scientists were currently looking at their machines in confusion, wondering if the volcano was readying itself to erupt.",
      "\"Lord Hephaestus!\"",
      "she called.",
      "She made her way through the twisty tunnels, squinting into the dimly lit corridors for any clue as to which way she should go.",
      "She pressed a hand to the wall to steady herself, and then pulled it away with a grimace of disgust and shook off the spider-webs that clung to her fingers.",
      "\"Lord Hephaestus!\"",
      "she called again.",
      "This time she timed her yell for that brief beat of silence between hammer strikes.",
      "\"Here!\"",
      "a gruff voice answered her.",
      "\"I'm in here.\"",
      "She followed the sound of his voice and the hammer.",
      "The corridor widened at last to a cavern where the god had set up his forge.",
      "She blinked a little at the sudden brightness, her eyes tearing up briefly, for there were torches set up all along the walls.",
      "The god had his back to her, his broad shoulders bare and glistening with sweat as he raised his hammer high above his head and brought it down with another ear-ringing clang.",
      "Huge muscles rippled under freckled and scarred skin as Hephaestus continued his work.",
      "It must have been a good day for him, for she saw no sign of his wheelchair or the cane he sometimes used.",
      "\"Lord Hephaestus!\"",
      "she shouted, stepping further into the cavern.",
      "\"Please forgive my intrusion--\" \"Your intrusion?\" Hephaestus snorted.",
      "He turned to face her, his face ruddy from the heat.",
      "An ember had caught in the wild tangle of his dark beard.",
      "Even as she watched, the ember glowed red and then fell apart into ash.",
      "He fixed Diana with a sharp, assessing scowl and drawled, \"Well, at least you're aware that you're wasting my time.",
      "You have no idea how many fools barge into my forge and demand my attention as though they have a right to it.\"",
      "He had a deep voice which rumbled much like the volcano itself and seemed to shake even Diana's frame.",
      "Diana bowed, very low, trying to ignore the nerves that shivered up her spine.",
      "Hephaestus was notorious for his foul temper, but at least he seemed to be in a decent mood today.",
      "\"I hope only to take a brief moment of your time,\" she murmured.",
      "\"Yet another refreshing change of pace.",
      "You aren't entirely thoughtless, little Amazon.\"",
      "Hephaestus's lips parted in a crooked grin at her look of surprise.",
      "\"Yes, I know who you are, Princess Diana of Themyscira.",
      "I might not give a damn about most of the Olympus gossip, but even I couldn't help but hear about your various exploits, both against Hades and in Man's World.\"",
      "He sounded faintly approving.",
      "\"Besides, I recognize my handiwork when I see it.\"",
      "He nodded at her bracelets and tiara.",
      "Diana flushed.",
      "\"Thank you, my lord.",
      "In truth, it is a matter of Man's World that brings me here.",
      "I need the necklace you crafted for my mother, the one that protects the mortal bearer from unwanted attention by the gods.\"",
      "\"I was wondering when someone would come around to collect that,\" Hephaestus said dryly.",
      "\"It's only been about seven centuries, give or take.",
      "Which god are you hoping to escape, princess?\" Diana hesitated.",
      "Hephaestus and Aphrodite had no love lost between them, but still, saying the goddess's name around the blacksmith god was never a good idea.",
      "\"Aphrodite, my lord,\" she said quietly.",
      "\"She threatens a dear friend of mine with Eros's arrows.\"",
      "Hephaestus snorted, looking unsurprised.",
      "\"I might have known it was Aphrodite with one of her little tricks,\" he muttered.",
      "\"I'll be but a moment, little Amazon.\"",
      "He set the hammer down on his forge and straightened himself to his full height, wincing as, she supposed, his twisted back protested.",
      "Diana averted her eyes as Hephaestus limped across the room.",
      "It was unnerving to see a god's face lined with pain, to hear his harsh breathing as he forced his damaged body to obey him.",
      "It was a relief when he grunted in satisfaction.",
      "\"Here's the necklace, little Amazon.",
      "Give it to your mortal with my blessing,\" he said, and Diana looked up in time to watch him toss the glittering necklace towards her.",
      "She caught it instinctively, pressing it to her chest for a moment before holding it up to the flickering torchlight for examination.",
      "It was a splendidly simple little thing, made up of carefully crafted links of gold and copper.",
      "The only ornament was a single golden disk with the mark of Zeus carved upon it as well as a few lines in the god's language that made her eyes hurt to view.",
      "Diana looked away after only a few seconds, blinking until the tears were gone.",
      "Then she smiled, relief making her heart leap in her chest.",
      "\"Thank you, my lord,\" she said with another bow.",
      "Hephaestus nodded back, waving a large, impatient hand.",
      "\"Yes, yes, you're quite welcome, now go.\"",
      "The final word was not quite snarled, but had the deep tone of a command.",
      "\"Thank you,\" Diana murmured again, and left at a speed that was nearly a run.",
      "As soon as the tunnels opened up to reveal blue sky, she leaped upwards, turning sharply west towards Gotham.",
      "It was evening by the time Diana reached Gotham, the sun having long since sunk below the skyline and turned the city sky a dark, deep blue.",
      "It was an overcast night, but the moon was, for the moment at least, in the one cloudless patch of sky.",
      "She cradled the necklace to her chest, unwilling to let it out of her sight even as she alighted briefly atop one of Gotham's many towers.",
      "A block away, voices were raised in argument.",
      "Diana frowned.",
      "Normally she would intervene, try to broker some sort of peace, but tonight Bruce came first.",
      "She pulled the earpiece from her belt, fitting it once more into her ear.",
      "\"Code 21A, Wonder Woman to Batman,\" she said.",
      "There was a long moment of silence, and she frowned, unease tightening her chest.",
      "Had she come too late?",
      "\"Wonder Woman to Batman, can you hear me?\"",
      "\"Princess,\" Bruce said in a crackle of static.",
      "\"I was about to send J'onn after you.\"",
      "He sounded like his normal self, and Diana grinned with relief, tension easing from her frame.",
      "\"I am beginning to get the feeling that you don't trust me, Batman.",
      "And to think I went halfway around the world to get you this present,\" she said lightly, smiling upwards at the moon.",
      "\"Aw, you shouldn't have,\" he deadpanned.",
      "She could picture the small smirk curving his lips, the flicker of amusement in his eyes.",
      "No doubt he had his arms folded against his chest as well and was leaning against a wall for the full effect.",
      "\"Let me guess.",
      "Is it Penguin all nicely tied up with a bow?\"",
      "\"No, something much better, I assure you,\" she said, fighting back a giddy laugh.",
      "She held the necklace up for another good look, admired the way even the gold turned silver in the moonlight.",
      "Hephaestus had done fine work when he had crafted this.",
      "\"I need to give it to you as soon as possible,\" she continued.",
      "\"Where can I find you?\"",
      "There was a pause, but this one meant Bruce was thinking.",
      "\"Meet me at the place we last fought the Joker together,\" he said and disconnected the call before she could answer.",
      "Trust Bruce to speak in code even on a supposedly secure line, Diana thought with a fond shake of her head.",
      "Still, she flexed her weary legs and sprang once more into the air.",
      "It was a matter of minutes to reach the rooftop where she and Bruce had last apprehended Bruce's nemesis.",
      "Bruce was already there, as still and silent as the gargoyle upon which he was standing.",
      "For a moment she almost let her gaze skip over him, he blended into the statue so well.",
      "It was only his cape billowing behind him in the strong night wind which betrayed him to her.",
      "His expression was unreadable as she landed behind the gargoyle.",
      "\"Diana,\" he said, turning slightly to face her and inclining his head in a curt hello.",
      "His gaze flickered briefly over her, an assessing look that went from the top of her head to the soles of her feet.",
      "Apparently having assuring himself that all the bits and pieces of her were properly accounted for and that she had encountered no danger during her trip to Themyscira, he folded his arms against his chest and waited for her response.",
      "\"Batman,\" she answered, clutching the necklace with hands that suddenly felt clumsy and prone to dropping things.",
      "She eyed the side of the building for a second, and then took a careful step away from it.",
      "\"Here.\"",
      "She held the necklace out to him.",
      "\"You brought me a necklace,\" he said.",
      "She couldn't see his eyebrows behind his cowl, but she was certain that they were raised.",
      "There was a certain quizzical set to his mouth.",
      "\"That was...generous of you.\"",
      "She waggled the necklace at him like one would dangle a string before a cat, and said hurriedly, \"Put it on.",
      "It will shield you from all of Aphrodite's mischief.\"",
      "Her shoulders tightened with expectation.",
      "In a moment Bruce would don the necklace, and she could sleep easier, knowing that he was safe from immortal harm.",
      "Her eyes itched at the mere mention of sleep and she blinked away the sudden grittiness pervading her eyes.",
      "If Bruce hadn't been watching her, she would have given into the temptation to rub at her eyes; instead she balled her free hand into a fist and ignored the sensation, shifting her weight from one foot to the other.",
      "Bruce took the necklace from her with his dark gloved hands, examining the disk with a slight downward twist to his mouth.",
      "He turned the necklace over, squinting at the intricacies of the joined links.",
      "\"Of course it would be a necklace,\" he muttered, resigned, and then moved to put it on.",
      "Diana watched him, biting her lower lip to keep from looking too thankful.",
      "Bruce would only be uncomfortable with her obvious relief and concern, she knew, and his discomfort meant he would avoid her at all costs for the next few weeks.",
      "She clasped both hands behind her back and waited.",
      "Bruce paused, the necklace halfway to his neck.",
      "His eyes narrowed, darkening with some foreign emotion.",
      "It took Diana a second to realize he was staring at her unadorned throat.",
      "\"And where is your necklace, Princess?\" he asked, voice thick with suspicion.",
      "He leveled a cool look at her.",
      "\"You're not about to do something stupidly self-sacrificing like giving me the only protection you have against Aphrodite, right?\" Diana sighed, seeing the stubborn glint in his eyes, the tension in his jaw that boded trouble if he disliked her answer.",
      "\"Put it on,\" she snapped.",
      "When he made no move to follow her orders, she waved an impatient hand at him.",
      "\"Yes, it is the only one of its kind, but the necklace only works on mortals.",
      "Wearing it around my neck would simply be a fashion statement, not protection.\"",
      "When Bruce looked at her, still frowning, she snapped, \"Batman, put it on right now or I swear in the name of Hera that I will put it on you myself!\"",
      "Bruce's lips twitched at that, and she could have sworn she heard him mutter something along the lines of, \"Princess, I'd love to see you try.\"",
      "Then he shrugged, his mouth softening into what was almost a smile.",
      "\"Your wish is my command, Diana,\" he said.",
      "He started to place the necklace around his neck, and then his hands stilled once more, arrested in the middle of working the clasp.",
      "He shuddered, his broad shoulders jerking like a chill had just gone down his spine.",
      "\"Batman,\" Diana began, wondering why he still hesitated.",
      "Then she noticed the pallor of his face, the sudden tremor in his hands.",
      "\"Batman,\" she said again, her voice rising in concern.",
      "She took a step towards him, both hands reaching out, ready to steady him should he start to tumble off the gargoyle's back.",
      "\"Diana, I,\" he said, a bewildered note creeping into his voice.",
      "He lifted his head, staring at her with an unfocused gaze, his eyes looking through her as though he couldn't see anything clearly.",
      "A grimace flitted across his face, half-hidden by the mask.",
      "\"I feel--\" He closed his eyes, swayed almost drunkenly.",
      "The necklace slipped from his nerveless grasp, dropping to the ground in a quiet chime of metal.",
      "\"My--\" One hand rose, reached blindly towards his back, and then dropped back to his side like dead weight.",
      "His fingers trembled for an instant as though he were still trying to reach his back, but soon even his hands were still.",
      "He fell, and Diana leaped forward to catch him.",
      "A grunt escaped her as she took the full weight of him in her arms, rocking back on her heels before she properly braced herself.",
      "\"Batman,\" she said, but there was no response except for his quick, uneven breaths, loud in her ear.",
      "His head lolled, his cheek feverishly warm against her shoulder.",
      "\"Batman,\" she whispered, shifting his weight to one arm and then feeling his back for a wound.",
      "It took only a second for her grasping fingers to catch hold of the smooth metal, feel the feathers against her fingertips, the small trickle of hot blood.",
      "Despair rose in her then, and she swallowed back the bitter taste of bile and defeat.",
      "\"Hera help me,\" she breathed hopelessly.",
      "Her hand dropped away from the arrow.",
      "Someone laughed behind her.",
      "It was a warm, throaty sound that caught hold of Diana and squeezed until Diana thought her heart would burst.",
      "Diana did not turn to look, closing her eyes in despair.",
      "She did not need to see those eyes that poets always likened to the sea, that reddish blond hair that fell in waves to the goddess's lower back, to know who had done this to him.",
      "\"Hera help you?",
      "What makes you think Hera cares about your friend, Princess?\"",
      "Aphrodite asked, amusement still tingeing her voice.",
      "\"He is only a mortal, and the queen of the gods has no time to be concerned with such an insignificant--\" Rage burned as hot as Hephaestus's forge, choking Diana as surely as her despair had.",
      "\"Enough,\" Diana snarled, holding Bruce tighter to her chest.",
      "\"All would agree that it is unbecoming for a goddess to gloat.\"",
      "\"Watch your tone, Amazon, when you speak to a goddess,\" Aphrodite snapped back, tone cold.",
      "After a moment, though, cool amusement returned to her voice.",
      "\"Besides, you should be thanking me, not scolding me.",
      "I have watched you two dance around each other for years now.",
      "It was high time for him to put aside all his silly objections and cherish you in a manner befitting royalty.\"",
      "She laughed in delight.",
      "\"He will worship the ground you walk on, cherish every word that falls from your lips, and obey your every command.",
      "It will be wonderful.\"",
      "\"You thought I would be pleased by Batman's servility?\"",
      "It took everything in her not to laugh mockingly.",
      "She struggled to keep her voice even.",
      "\"My lady, you do not know me at all.\"",
      "Aphrodite tsked.",
      "\"You'll change your mind,\" she said confidently.",
      "\"Wait until he takes off that mask of his to kneel before you and offer you his heart.",
      "You won't be able to resist.",
      "It is always so much sweeter when a hard-hearted man like this one finally succumbs to love.\"",
      "Diana spoke through gritted teeth, each word sharp and cold enough to shatter diamonds.",
      "\"Aphrodite, I swear to Hera that if you do not leave right now, I will attack you where you stand.\"",
      "Aphrodite laughed again, still amused.",
      "\"Tell me that again in a few weeks, Amazon, once you have seen what my son's arrow does to his temperament.",
      "You'll be thanking me and wishing you had never made that fool's errand to my husband's forge.\"",
      "At that, Diana forced herself to look over her shoulder and meet Aphrodite's eyes.",
      "\"Did Hephaestus tell you of the necklace?\" she asked, not quite believing the god would aid Aphrodite.",
      "Aphrodite snorted.",
      "\"Please, as though that idiot would ever help me.",
      "No, it was quite simple, really.",
      "I told Psyche of my plans, pretended that I didn't already know exactly where my foolish son always hides his quiver and bow, and then followed Psyche straight to you.",
      "That was quite the touching scene you had on Themyscira, by the way.\"",
      "Aphrodite still smiled, but her eyes were as dangerous as the stormiest sea.",
      "\"Tell Lysippe to mind her words before I lose my patience.\"",
      "\"I will pass along the message the next time I see her,\" Diana said.",
      "\"Now go, my lady, and take your son's arrows with you.\"",
      "The title nearly strangled her, but somehow it came out only slightly bitter.",
      "Aphrodite did not respond, but in the next second she was gone, leaving only the strong smell of brine and roses in the air and Bruce's heavy weight in Diana's arms to show that the goddess had been here at all.",
      "Diana looked down at Bruce's masked, slack features, grief tightening her chest.",
      "If only she had pressed the necklace upon him more forcefully, told him immediately that only he could be protected by the necklace.",
      "If he hadn't hesitated, perhaps....",
      "No, she told herself.",
      "This was no time for what-ifs.",
      "Aphrodite had been there the entire time.",
      "The goddess would have struck him with the arrow no matter when he'd started to put on the necklace.",
      "\"I'm so sorry,\" she whispered into his unhearing ear.",
      "This close, she could smell the various scents rising off his skin and costume, sweat and deodorant as well as something that she couldn't describe but a strong, earthy scent that was uniquely Bruce.",
      "She shifted him in her arms, and frowned.",
      "She should get him to the Bat Cave, but how?",
      "She had been to the Manor a half-dozen times, but by invitation only.",
      "Perhaps she should use Bruce's earpiece and somehow contact Alfred.",
      "Someone leapt from the next building over, landing lightly on the other end of the roof.",
      "\"Wonder Woman!\"",
      "Robin called.",
      "The surprise was obvious in his voice, the wariness, less so.",
      "\"What are you doing here?",
      "Batman didn't say--\" She knew the moment he got close enough to see that Bruce was slumped against her.",
      "\"Batman!\"",
      "Diana turned her head enough that she could see Robin's costume in the corner of her eye--the bright green, red, and yellow leaped out at her from the darkness.",
      "\"Batman has been injured,\" she said.",
      "\"We need to get him home.\"",
      "\"Right.\"",
      "Robin paced forward.",
      "\"What happened to him?\"",
      "His voice was flat; as he drew closer, she could see the anger already beginning to harden his young features, his eyes narrowing to slits behind his mask.",
      "His hands clenched into fists at his sides.",
      "\"Batman was struck by one of Eros's arrows,\" Diana explained.",
      "At his blank expression, she elaborated.",
      "\"One of Eros's arrows makes its victims fall in love with the first person they see--\" She faltered.",
      "HadBruce looked clearly at her before he'd lost consciousness?",
      "She remembered his unfocused gaze, how he'd closed his eyes before he'd fallen.",
      "\"Robin,\" she said, something like hope catching in her throat, \"we must bind Batman's eyes.\"",
      "\"Bind his eyes?\"",
      "Robin echoed, puzzled.",
      "Then he nodded.",
      "\"Oh!",
      "I get it.",
      "If he hasn't looked at anyone yet, the arrow won't work, right?\"",
      "\"Precisely,\" Diana said.",
      "\"We can keep his eyes covered until I have found a way to reverse the arrow's effect.\"",
      "She ignored the quiet voice that sounded like a smug Aphrodite reminding her that there was no known cure.",
      "\"Here,\" Robin said, coming up behind her and tying a strip of black fabric around Bruce's eyes with a few quick, efficient movements.",
      "\"Part of my training is learning how to fight blindfolded,\" he explained with a slight grin at her curious look.",
      "Then his smile faded.",
      "\"How are we going to get him back to the Manor?\"",
      "\"I can carry him if you will let me into the Bat Cave,\" Diana said.",
      "Her gaze fell upon the necklace, half-hidden in the shadows of the gargoyle.",
      "\"Pick up the necklace and keep it with you,\" she said.",
      "\"Make certain not to lose it.\"",
      "Robin shot her a puzzled look even as he obediently picked up the necklace.",
      "He stared at the jewelry for a moment, and looked about to say something.",
      "Then he wrinkled his nose and muttered something like, \"I don't want to know.\"",
      "\"Excuse me?\" Diana asked, but Robin shook his head.",
      "\"Let's go,\" he said.",
      "Without a backwards glance, he took a running leap off the roof.",
      "A second later, a rappel gun fired, and Robin swung back into view, landing heavily on a nearby building and starting to run.",
      "Diana draped Bruce over her shoulder, careful not to jostle the arrow still in his back, and launched herself after Robin.",
      "\"Your Highness, Master Jason,\" Alfred said.",
      "His eyes had widened at the sight of Bruce slung over Diana's shoulder and the arrow sticking out of Bruce's back, but otherwise nothing else had betrayed his surprise and alarm.",
      "\"I take it Master Bruce ran afoul of some villain,\" he said.",
      "\"We have an infirmary if you will step this way, Your Highness.\"",
      "\"Goddess, not villain,\" Diana corrected grimly as she followed after Alfred.",
      "\"Aphrodite, to be precise.",
      "Do any of the beds have restraints?\" \"Restraints?\"",
      "Robin said, voice rising.",
      "\"You said that the arrows make people fall in love.",
      "Why does Batman need restraints?\"",
      "He ripped off his mask, frowning at her.",
      "He looked absurdly young without his mask, thin face flushed with anger and windswept hair sticking up every which way.",
      "Diana tried to remember how old he was.",
      "Not much older than Donna, surely, only twelve or thirteen years old.",
      "\"If Batman did look at me after the arrow struck him, he will be out of his mind,\" she said, keeping her voice calm and matter-of-fact.",
      "\"If he didn't, he will doubtless try to take off the blindfold before we can explain why he's wearing it.\"",
      "\"I don't like it,\" Robin grumbled, hunching his shoulders and scowling.",
      "\"Tying Batman to the bed like he's in Arkham, like he's a bad guy--\" \"I do not like the idea any more than you do, Master Jason,\" Alfred said, \"but I believe Master Bruce would prefer temporary restraints over falling prey to the arrow's powers.\"",
      "Alfred shot Diana a quick sidelong glance.",
      "\"The arrow is one of Eros's, I presume?\"",
      "\"Yes,\" Diana said shortly.",
      "She laid Bruce down upon one of the beds, careful to keep him in an upright position so as to keep the arrow from going in further.",
      "Blood still oozed sluggishly from the wound, although it was hard to tell how much blood Bruce had lost--much of the spilled blood was obscured by his costume.",
      "Alfred frowned and removed both the mask and the blindfold, returning the blindfold to Bruce's eyes so swiftly that Diana didn't even have a chance to protest the initial removal.",
      "Now that Bruce's face was unmasked, Diana could see how terrible he looked.",
      "His face was colorless, copious sweat beaded his hairline, and his expression was tight with pain even while unconscious.",
      "Alfred's frown deepened as he pressed his fingers to Bruce's throat, apparently not liking the pace of his heart any better than Diana had.",
      "\"This is beyond my expertise.",
      "We need Leslie,\" he murmured, almost to himself.",
      "Diana wondered who this Leslie was as Alfred stepped away from the bed.",
      "\"Master Jason, please assist the princess with the restraints while I get--\" \"Right, right,\" Robin said.",
      "The scowl remained on his face even as he set the necklace down on a nearby surface.",
      "He began snapping the cuffs over Bruce's wrists and, after a brief hesitation, his ankles.",
      "Alfred paused, giving Bruce's unconscious form one last unreadable look before he left at a pace that was nearly a run for the older man.",
      "Diana watched him go, trying to keep the sympathy from her expression.",
      "Alfred had no doubt grown resigned to Bruce's injuries during battle, but resignation was a far cry from blase acceptance.",
      "Robin had just closed the last cuff over Bruce's left ankle and taken a step away from the bed when Bruce groaned and began to stir.",
      "\"Bruce?\"",
      "Diana said, tightening her grip on his shoulders.",
      "\"Bruce--\" Bruce groaned again, a full-body shudder going through him.",
      "Then the muscles in his shoulders tightened and he tugged his shoulders from her grasp and sat a little straighter.",
      "His arms flexed for a moment before he abandoned the struggle against his restraints.",
      "\"Diana?\" he muttered, sounding dazed.",
      "She placed a steadying hand to the back of his neck, uncertain whether she should have been pleased or worried when he didn't immediately pull away.",
      "His heartbeat was still uneven, she noticed, frowning, his skin clammy against her palm.",
      "\"Bruce, do you remember what happened?\" she asked, pitching her voice low and reassuring.",
      "\"You were injured by the goddess Aphrodite, and Robin and I brought you to the Manor.\"",
      "He turned, grimacing at the movement.",
      "\"Diana?\" he asked, in that same groggy whisper.",
      "\"Yes, Bruce, I am here,\" Diana said.",
      "She tried to tell herself it was only the pain that was making Bruce so docile, that he was in shock from the arrow.",
      "That was why he wasn't immediately demanding to know what was going on and who'd had the bright idea to restrain him.",
      "She spared a brief glance for Robin, who was watching them with an angry, helpless frown on his face, and then continued slowly, \"Robin is here as well.",
      "Alfred has gone to fetch Leslie.",
      "Just stay still, please.\"",
      "\"Diana,\" Bruce said again, and now the grogginess was fading, replaced by something else, something that made Diana's heart sink to the floor.",
      "He turned his face blindly towards her, something going soft and terribly vulnerable in his ashen face.",
      "\"I have to tell you,\" he said breathlessly.",
      "He struggled against the restraints, his voice rising.",
      "\"On the rooftop, I thought how we should--no, I'm saying this all wrong.",
      "I realized how foolish I've been.",
      "How many years have we wasted because I was a stubborn idiot?",
      "I--\" \"Bruce, stop,\" Diana said.",
      "Bruce clamped his mouth shut, a muscle jumping briefly in his jaw before he froze on the hospital bed.",
      "Only the slight movement of his neck under her hand reassured her that he was even breathing.",
      "For a moment Diana stared at him.",
      "Then she remembered Aphrodite's words.",
      "He will worship the ground you walk on, cherish every word that falls from your lips, and obey your every command.",
      "\"Damn,\" she said viciously, and ignored Robin's startled expression.",
      "\"What's going on?\" Robin asked.",
      "His gaze flicked between them, and then the boy swore quietly under his breath, half-darting a glance at her to see if she'd scold him.",
      "He relaxed a little when she said nothing.",
      "\"He saw you.\"",
      "It wasn't a question.",
      "\"Yes,\" Diana said.",
      "Then, gentler, she added, \"Bruce, you were struck by one of Eros's arrows.",
      "What you're feeling isn't real--\" He laughed at that, half-disbelieving, half-amused.",
      "\"Isn't real?\" he said.",
      "\"We both know it is.",
      "I love--\" \"Don't you darefinish that sentence!\"",
      "Diana shouted, hearing the anger and pain in her voice and hating Aphrodite even more for it.",
      "She pretended not to notice Robin had suddenly found the floor absolutely fascinating; currently he was looking at anything but her and Bruce.",
      "She tried to soften her words even as misery choked her.",
      "\"Bruce, if you were in your right mind you wouldn't be talking like this.\"",
      "Bruce's throat worked for a moment as though he was swallowing his words.",
      "Then he shook his head.",
      "\"Diana, don't you see?\" he said earnestly.",
      "\"Eros's arrow didn't change my feelings.",
      "It just opened my eyes to the truth.",
      "God, you don't know what you do to me.",
      "Just the moonlight in your hair--\" \"Stop speaking,\" Diana said, and he did.",
      "How many times had she imagined the moment when she convinced Bruce to take a chance on their relationship?",
      "She'd pictured his slightly rueful smile as he conceded to her wisdom, the way his gaze would warm as he finally let himself look his full of her.",
      "Nothing she had envisioned had been like this, Bruce's expression ridiculously besotted, his words so saccharine that any sane, sensible person would choke upon them.",
      "Diana leaned forward, pressed her mouth close to Bruce's ear and tried to ignore the way he shuddered a little at her nearness.",
      "Perhaps what she was about to do was wrong, forcing her will upon him like this, but she couldn't, wouldn't bear this another moment longer.",
      "\"You know what?\" she said in a low voice.",
      "\"I don't care if you're secretly a hopeless romantic underneath that stubborn exterior of yours.",
      "I don't care if you've secretly been composing poems for me that would have made Sappho weep.",
      "I will not hear those words from you while you are under the influence of Eros's arrow, and that is final.",
      "Do you understand me?\"",
      "\"Diana,\" Bruce said, wretched, like her name hurt to say.",
      "\"Answer me.\"",
      "\"Yes,\" he hissed through clenched teeth.",
      "\"I understand.",
      "I won't tell you how I feel.\"",
      "\"Good,\" she said.",
      "She still had her hand pressed to his neck, she realized.",
      "She stepped away, adding, \"Now, stay upright and tell me or Robin if you start feeling faint again.",
      "Alfred will be here soon with Leslie.",
      "We'll get that arrow out of you.\"",
      "\"All right,\" Bruce said tonelessly, all animation draining from his face.",
      "When she turned away from the bed, Robin was still studying the floor.",
      "\"Will you watch him for me?\" she asked.",
      "\"I need....\" She needed to be anywhere but here.",
      "No, she needed to fly to Mount Olympus and drag Aphrodite before Zeus and Hera, where she could demand the cure and fix this.",
      "She took a deep breath, willing the tightness in her chest away.",
      "\"I need to get some air,\" she said at last.",
      "\"Just take the stairs.",
      "It'll take you to the main hallway,\" Robin said.",
      "She was almost to the stairs when his quiet voice stopped her.",
      "\"You can fix him, right?\"",
      "She turned to look at him.",
      "His shoulders were hunched, his eyes hooded as he stared at Bruce.",
      "\"Yes,\" she said firmly, and told herself it wasn't a lie.",
      "Leslie turned out to be a woman around Alfred's age clothed in a lab coat and wearing a grim expression.",
      "Alfred followed her, clutching a large box.",
      "Diana met them both at the door, taking the box from Alfred's arms and ignoring his raised eyebrow.",
      "\"You must be Ms. Prince,\" Leslie said.",
      "She attempted a smile; it died quickly and never reached her worried eyes.",
      "\"How's Bruce?\"",
      "\"He's awake.",
      "At least he was a few minutes ago,\" Diana amended.",
      "\"He is under the influence of Eros's arrow, so it's difficult to tell how much of his current state is from blood loss and how much is from the arrow.\"",
      "\"Yes, Alfred mentioned the arrow.",
      "Besides it inducing love, is there anything else I should know about it?\" Leslie asked.",
      "\"It won't dissolve once I begin to remove it, for example.\"",
      "\"I--\" Diana blinked.",
      "She thought hard, but she didn't remember any of the sort mentioned in the stories her mother had told her.",
      "\"I don't know.",
      "I don't believe it does.",
      "I think my mother mentioned that the wound will close up once you remove the arrow, but I'm not certain.\"",
      "\"That's something, at least,\" Leslie said.",
      "The woman started to step into the Manor and then paused, peering at Diana.",
      "\"Alfred, would you go and get some food for Ms. Prince while I tend to Bruce?\"",
      "\"I'm fine,\" Diana said automatically.",
      "Leslie offered her a polite smile that said clearly she didn't believe a word of it.",
      "\"When was the last time you ate, dear?\" she asked.",
      "\"I--\" Diana's throat was dry, and it took a moment to get the words out.",
      "\"I am an Amazon.",
      "I don't need as much food or sleep as mortals.\"",
      "\"I'll be in the kitchen,\" Alfred murmured as though he'd misheard and thought that Diana had announced that she was starving.",
      "When she opened her mouth to protest, he added mildly, \"No doubt Master Jason is hungry as well.\"",
      "\"I remember Bruce when he was twelve,\" Leslie said.",
      "\"Boys at that age are alwayshungry.\"",
      "Her tone was so much like Bruce at his driest that Diana found herself staring.",
      "Had Bruce gotten his sense of humor from this woman?",
      "\"I will prepare some sandwiches,\" Alfred said.",
      "\"Do you have a particular preference, Your Highness?\"",
      "Diana closed her mouth, defeated, and shook her head before she followed Leslie into the Manor.",
      "\"I'll need your assistance with Bruce,\" Leslie said over her shoulder.",
      "\"I'll help in any way I can, but I'm afraid that I don't have much medical knowledge.",
      "There aren't many injuries on Themyscira,\" Diana said with a frown.",
      "She'd learned first-aid within a few weeks of joining the Justice League, after Wally had been injured and she'd stood there, useless, while Bruce tended to his wounds, but she doubted her first-aid knowledge would be at all helpful.",
      "\"I'll need you to hold him steady while I work,\" Leslie explained.",
      "\"I have to do some scans first, look for any possible damage in case the wound doesn't heal as you said, but I want that arrow out as soon as possible.\"",
      "\"I can do that,\" Diana said.",
      "Robin looked relieved to see them.",
      "\"He hasn't said anything since you told him to, uh, stop talking,\" he said to Diana and then grinned hopefully at Leslie.",
      "\"Gonna get the arrow out of him?\"",
      "\"That is the plan,\" Leslie said with a small smile, and then tugged the box away from Diana.",
      "She opened it, pulling out a few medical-looking items.",
      "She fussed over Bruce, who continued to look blank and barely acknowledged Leslie.",
      "He answered her questions in a quiet monotone and didn't even flinch when Leslie carefully cut the bloodstained cloak and costume away from the wound.",
      "After a few minutes of this, Leslie looked up.",
      "\"He has lost quite a bit of blood.",
      "Jason, do you know how to prepare a blood infusion?\"",
      "Robin nodded, looking almost relieved at having something to do.",
      "\"I'll go get it ready,\" he said, and vanished further into the infirmary.",
      "\"Bruce thought it prudent to keep a stock of blood around, considering his nightly activities,\" Leslie explained.",
      "Her hands hovered by Bruce's head, and she glanced at Diana.",
      "\"Is it all right to remove the blindfold?\"",
      "\"Go ahead,\" Diana said bleakly.",
      "What did it matter now?",
      "She wasn't surprised that Bruce looked towards her as soon as the blindfold was gone.",
      "He opened his mouth to speak, and then frowned and said nothing, staring at her in mute appeal.",
      "She could only meet his eyes for a few seconds, lowering her gaze to the arrow embedded in Bruce's back.",
      "Once Leslie had viewed the scans and Bruce had fresh blood going into one arm and an IV going into the other, as well as the man being hooked to several machines meant to monitor his blood pressure and heartbeat, Leslie washed her hands and snapped on a pair of gloves.",
      "\"I'll be putting him under anesthesia--his body's already had quite a shock, and removing the arrow will be still another one,\" she explained.",
      "\"I just need you to hold him steady once I begin the removal.",
      "Jason will be monitoring Bruce's vitals.\"",
      "The surgery went slowly, or perhaps it only seemed slow to Diana as Leslie bent over the wound and carefully removed the arrow.",
      "There was a fresh trickle of blood when the arrow came free, but then the wound closed up as Diana had predicted.",
      "\"Thank goodness,\" Leslie murmured under her breath, but her hands didn't falter as she set the arrow aside and began to wash the remnants of blood from Bruce's back.",
      "\"I'm going to do a few more scans, of course, but if the wound has healed on its own, he should be fine once he's recovered from the shock and blood loss.\"",
      "\"I'll tell Alfred,\" Robin said, and walked quickly to the stairs.",
      "As soon as he reached the stairs, however, he broke into a run, yelling, \"Alfred!",
      "He should be okay!\"",
      "Leslie smiled faintly at his enthusiasm, and then turned to Diana.",
      "\"I can handle the rest.",
      "Besides, Bruce won't wake from the anesthesia for another half-hour or so.",
      "Go upstairs, get something to eat.",
      "I'll call for you if I need you.\"",
      "\"All right,\" Diana agreed.",
      "Upon entering the main part of the Manor, however, she turned right instead of left and headed to the nearest bathroom.",
      "There, she stared at her wan, weary reflection.",
      "After a moment, she tugged her tiara from her head.",
      "She pressed her thumb firmly against the point of the star until a dull pain blossomed.",
      "The blood dripped sluggishly and almost reluctantly from the wound.",
      "It would only be a moment before the wound healed, she knew, and so she quickly pressed her thumb to the mirror, drawing the ancient signal of Hera's priestess.",
      "A moment later, the mirror shivered green and her mother's face appeared.",
      "\"Diana?\" she said in surprise, and then her eyes narrowed and her expression tightened.",
      "\"I take it you are not calling upon me with good news.\"",
      "\"Aphrodite has used one of Eros's arrows upon Batman,\" Diana said.",
      "To her embarrassment, her eyes pricked with tears and her mother's face blurred.",
      "\"Mother, tell me you know of a way to reverse the arrow's effects.",
      "Please.\"",
      "\"I do not,\" her mother said gently.",
      "\"Mother, he is mindless with infatuation.",
      "I could order him to kill himself, and I believe he would do so,\" Diana said, even more mortified to hear her voice shake.",
      "\"Neither of us can live like this.",
      "There must be something--\" \"Beseech the gods,\" her mother said.",
      "\"Batman is a mortal, true, but an important one.",
      "Go to Mount Olympus, tell Zeus how Aphrodite's amusement has robbed Man's World of one of its strongest defenders.",
      "Aphrodite will be furious, true, but you may sway Zeus to your cause.\"",
      "\"And if he is not swayed?\" Diana almost asked, but they both knew the answer to that.",
      "She smiled weakly, trying to look confident.",
      "\"Thank you, Mother.\"",
      "Her mother's expression was grave.",
      "\"Be careful, my moon and stars,\" she said.",
      "She hesitated, and then her expression smoothed into an unreadable one.",
      "\"Good luck,\" she said, softer.",
      "Then mirror flared green once more, and her mother was gone.",
      "Diana replaced her tiara and went into the kitchen, where Robin was wolfing down a sandwich in one hand, his free hand already reaching for another sandwich.",
      "Alfred was watching him with a slight crease at the corners of his mouth that suggested an inward smile.",
      "He inclined his head towards Diana as she entered.",
      "\"Your Highness.",
      "I hope you like ham sandwiches.",
      "I am afraid Master Jason has eaten all of the turkey ones I prepared.\"",
      "\"Sorry,\" Robin said through a mouthful of food, not sounding all that apologetic.",
      "Diana took a sandwich and began to eat.",
      "It tasted of ashes in her mouth, and she swallowed with difficulty.",
      "\"I am going to Mount Olympus,\" she said after forcing down another bite.",
      "Alfred did not look surprised, but Robin paused and stared at her.",
      "\"Wait, Mount Olympus?",
      "Like, the place where the gods live?\" he asked in disbelief.",
      "\"Can normal people even go there?\"",
      "\"I am not entirely mortal,\" Diana explained.",
      "\"I won't be able to stay there for very long, but I can entreat Zeus to restore Bruce to his normal self.\"",
      "She took another bite.",
      "\"Zeus can do that?\" Robin grinned.",
      "\"I guess being the king of the gods means you can do what you want.\"",
      "\"You'll need to have someone oversee Gotham's protection,\" Diana said.",
      "\"Time is odd around the gods--I may be back in a day, I may be back in a week.\"",
      "\"I can--\" Robin began, looking indignant, but Alfred was already nodding.",
      "\"Master Dick is busy in Bludhaven, but I will contact....\" He hesitated, and said, almost awkwardly, as though the name felt odd to say, \"Oracle.",
      "She'll be able to recommend someone to help Master Jason.\"",
      "\"Oh,\" Robin said, deflating a little.",
      "\"Yeah, bet you Barb--Oracle--could probably get Huntress to come here.",
      "Batman doesn't mind her too much.\"",
      "He shot a quick look at Diana, but she assumed a bland expression.",
      "Bruce had introduced her to Alfred, Nightwing, and Robin, but she would not press if there were others in Gotham yet to be introduced.",
      "\"If Bruce trusts this Oracle, so do I,\" she said, and took another grudging nibble of her sandwich.",
      "\"And I have met Huntress.\"",
      "She didn't bother mentioning that Huntress was no longer a member of the Justice League; doubtless, that had been a point in her favor in Bruce's eyes.",
      "\"I will contact her in the morning,\" Alfred said mildly, and set a glass of water next to Diana's elbow.",
      "\"I am going to check on Leslie and Master Bruce.\"",
      "Diana and Robin ate in silence, until Robin finished the last sandwich and leaned back in his chair.",
      "He kicked the table idly and said, \"So, uh.",
      "I won't tell anyone 'bout what Batman said.\"",
      "His ears were a little pink.",
      "\"Thank you,\" Diana said gravely, resisting the urge to smile.",
      "\"Yeah, well, Batman would kill me if I told anyone about him being mushy,\" Robin said.",
      "He wrinkled his nose.",
      "\"Plus, I figure Eros's arrow counts as mind control.",
      "No teasing people about stuff they say under mind control.",
      "Rule number twenty.\"",
      "Diana paused, her half-finished sandwich halfway to her mouth.",
      "\"Please tell me Bruce doesn't have an actual list of rules about being a super-hero,\" she said.",
      "Robin grinned widely.",
      "\"I would, but rule number three is no lying to Justice League members,\" he said, adopting a solemn tone.",
      "He laughed when Diana pursed her lips.",
      "Diana forced down the rest of the sandwich, and then two more.",
      "She might not be hungry, but she would need all her energy to reach Mount Olympus and beseech Zeus.",
      "She glanced up at the clock.",
      "Bruce would be waking soon.",
      "She rose to her feet.",
      "\"Good luck,\" Robin said.",
      "\"Thank you,\" Diana said.",
      "She hesitated, wondering if she should say more, promise him that everything would be fine.",
      "He made a face like he knew what she was thinking.",
      "\"Just go and get Zeus to make Batman normal again, okay?",
      "Please?\" \"Goodbye, Robin,\" Diana said.",
      "\"Tell Alfred thank you for the sandwiches.\"",
      "\"Will do,\" Robin said, slouching in his chair.",
      "It was impossible to describe Mount Olympus, the overwhelming grandeur, the sense of timelessness.",
      "Even as she stood before the gates and knocked, Diana felt a little dizzy.",
      "The gates swung open, and she stepped inside, feeling rather like she was wading through water.",
      "Overwhelming power pressed in on her from all sides.",
      "\"What's an Amazon doing on Mount Olympus?\" a cheerful voice asked.",
      "\"You have crossed into dangerous territory, Princess Diana.\"",
      "Diana turned her head with effort.",
      "When she saw the traveler's robes and wide-brimmed hat the god wore, she managed a brief smile.",
      "\"Feigning ignorance does not become you, Lord Hermes,\" she said.",
      "\"You must know what Aphrodite has done.\"",
      "\"Yes, I might have heard something about an incident involving one of Eros's arrows and a certain mortal,\" Hermes admitted.",
      "He stepped closer, and extended an arm to her.",
      "\"Eros was not pleased by his mother's theft of his quiver and arrows.",
      "You are going to beseech Zeus, I take it?\"",
      "\"That is my plan,\" Diana admitted, accepting his arm.",
      "Instantly it was much easier to move.",
      "She fought the urge to lean against him and catch her breath.",
      "Hermes might have been one of the kinder gods, but even he had his limits.",
      "\"Do you think he will hear my appeal?\" Hermes frowned.",
      "\"Zeus is not in the best of moods,\" he admitted.",
      "\"He and Hera have been arguing over whether or not we should return to the mortal world.",
      "He is for going back to the mortal world, and Hera is against it.\"",
      "Diana's heart sank.",
      "\"So if I ask him to help Batman, I will be asking him to--\" \"Admit he's wrong,\" Hermes said with a sympathetic grimace.",
      "\"He'll certainly see it that way, I'm afraid.\"",
      "He lowered his voice, adding thoughtfully, \"Of course, if you phrased it differently, perhaps he could be persuaded to fix your mortal.\"",
      "\"Thank you, Lord Hermes,\" Diana said.",
      "She caught her breath at the sight of Zeus's palace, glittering gold brightly enough to make her eyes water, but Hermes didn't bat an eye as he ushered her inside.",
      "\"You have been extremely helpful.\"",
      "Unusually so, she thought.",
      "Hermes was no enemy of the Amazons, but no ally, either; Iris had always brought any message from the gods to Themyscira.",
      "She eyed him curiously.",
      "He caught the look and laughed.",
      "\"Don't look so puzzled, Princess Diana.",
      "You are a traveler, are you not?",
      "I protect all and any wayfarers.\"",
      "Some of the amusement left his face.",
      "\"Besides, Eros asked a boon of me.",
      "He and Psyche are furious at Aphrodite's trickery, and asked me to aid you any way I can.\"",
      "This close, she could see reflections of Eros in Hermes's features (or rather, the features that Hermes had passed along to his son) --the pale reddish-blond hue of his hair, the thick curls that tumbled in front of his eyes, the determined jut of his jaw.",
      "\"Thank you, my lord,\" Diana said.",
      "\"Here is the throne room,\" Hermes said, coming to a stop before a huge door.",
      "\"Whatever Zeus decides, I will be out here to escort you from Olympus.\"",
      "Diana inclined her head.",
      "She stood there for a moment, gathering her thoughts and weighing her options.",
      "Then she pushed open the door and stepped inside.",
      "Zeus was alone, seated upon his throne and sipping a goblet of nectar.",
      "Diana fought back the relief that welled within her.",
      "This would be easier without an audience.",
      "She knelt before him, pressed her forehead to the cold floor.",
      "\"Your Majesty,\" she said.",
      "The awe in her voice was not feigned; Zeus radiated power so that it hurt to look at him.",
      "Little sparks of lightning flared and died around him, filling the air with electricity and making it hard to breathe.",
      "\"So, Hipployta's daughter has come to see me,\" Zeus said.",
      "If Hephaestus's voice had rattled her bones, Zeus's made her head ache, the booming words like the warning rumble of thunder before a storm.",
      "He let out a brief shout of laughter that made her teeth click together.",
      "\"Are you lost or blind, girl?",
      "Hera is not here.\"",
      "\"It is not Hera's aid I need, my king,\" Diana said.",
      "\"It is yours.\"",
      "\"Rise,\" Zeus commanded.",
      "She obeyed, keeping her gaze focused on his thick beard instead of his face.",
      "\"And what is it you want of me?\"",
      "\"I beg you to right a wrong, Your Majesty,\" Diana said.",
      "\"If this is about Aphrodite's trick with the arrow, I remind you that you are asking me to intrude upon Aphrodite's domain,\" Zeus said.",
      "She could feel his gaze upon her face, hear the frown in his voice though she still didn't dare to meet his eyes.",
      "\"Tread carefully, girl.\"",
      "Diana took a deep breath.",
      "\"Your Majesty, you best of all the gods know of the thrill of a conquest, the satisfaction you feel when you have coaxed someone into bed and won their heart,\" she said.",
      "\"Aphrodite has robbed me of this pleasure.\"",
      "Zeus was silent for a moment, and she found herself praying--to whom, she wasn't entirely certain, while she stood in Zeus's throne room, but praying, Please, please, let this sway Zeus.",
      "Then he stood.",
      "His hand rested, heavy, on her shoulder.",
      "She nearly buckled under the weight of it.",
      "\"Princess Diana of the Amazons, I understand your difficulty,\" he said.",
      "\"I remember well when Eros's arrows have been used against me.\"",
      "\"Then you will help me, Your Majesty?\"",
      "Diana said, hope fluttering in her chest.",
      "\"Athena has crafted a potion that she believes will bring your mortal back to his senses.",
      "She awaits only my agreement to make the potion itself.",
      "Go to her, and tell her you have my blessing to gather the ingredients.\"",
      "He frowned.",
      "\"However, you must not tell Hera that I have helped you.",
      "She would consider this meddling with the mortal world.\"",
      "\"I will not tell her, Your Majesty,\" Diana promised, fighting the giddy smile that wanted to curve her lips.",
      "\"Thank you, Your Majesty.",
      "I will not forget this kindness.\"",
      "She thought Zeus smiled, though it was half-hidden by his thick beard.",
      "\"Here is one ingredient I know you will need,\" he said, and drew a small vial from his robes.",
      "\"It is a crushed acorn from one of my oaks.\"",
      "She cradled the vial in her hands, willing her hands not to tremble.",
      "It was warm to the touch, not hot enough to burn, but warm enough that her skin prickled from the heat.",
      "\"Thank you, Your Majesty.\"",
      "\"Go,\" Zeus said, and she fled before he could change his mind.",
      "Outside, Hermes glanced at her from where he was leaning against the wall.",
      "Diana suspected him of eavesdropping, but said nothing as the god arched an eyebrow.",
      "\"I take it your conversation went well,\" he said.",
      "He tipped his hat back, eyeing the vial curiously.",
      "\"Yes.",
      "Athena created a potion that will cure Batman,\" Diana said.",
      "\"Now I must go to her, learn what other ingredients I need.\"",
      "\"I'll come along,\" Hermes said.",
      "He stepped away from the wall, extending his arm once more to her.",
      "\"Olympus doesn't welcome those touched with mortality, even stubborn Amazon princesses.\"",
      "Diana switched the vial over to one hand, fingers closing carefully around the glass, and then accepted the god's arm.",
      "\"I would be grateful for your assistance, Lord Hermes.\"",
      "Athena lived in her own small palace, one that looked more like a library.",
      "It smelled of one as well, rich with the scents of dust and ink and parchment and the overall sense of age and knowledge.",
      "Diana breathed in deeply, feeling some of the tension in her ease.",
      "Athena's potion would work, she knew.",
      "Diana simply had to gather the ingredients.",
      "\"Lady Athena,\" she called as she and Hermes stepped further into the main foyer.",
      "\"We would speak with you.\"",
      "\"Come for the list of ingredients, Diana of Themyscira?\"",
      "When Diana turned, she found herself meeting pale gray eyes that gleamed with intelligence.",
      "\"Yes, Lady Athena,\" she said, inclining her head, for that sharp, assessing gaze could belong to no other goddess.",
      "\"Lord Zeus gives his blessing for me to gather the ingredients.\"",
      "\"I wondered if you would convince him,\" Athena said.",
      "A small, pleased smile flickered briefly upon her stern features before she looked grave once more.",
      "\"I have the list, but I would speak to you first before you begin your quest, child.\"",
      "Diana fought to keep her surprise off her face.",
      "Every inch of her ached to be off gathering the ingredients and restoring Bruce to his normal self.",
      "She inclined her head once more as Hermes stepped away, presumably to give them some privacy.",
      "\"I am not aware of time being of the essence to cure Batman, my lady, but I admit I would prefer to begin my quest soon,\" she said as politely as she could manage.",
      "Impatience burned in the back of her throat, tightened the muscles in her shoulders once more.",
      "\"Is the conversation so important that it cannot wait until I've gathered the ingredients?\" Athena looked at her for a long moment, and Diana inwardly winced at disapproval darkening the goddess's eyes.",
      "\"It is about the ingredients,\" Athena said at last.",
      "\"I cannot in good conscience send you on this quest without warning you of the dangers.\"",
      "\"There are always dangers on a quest,\" Diana pointed out.",
      "\"It would hardly be a proper quest without possible injury.\"",
      "Athena plucked a scroll from a nearby table and handed it to her.",
      "\"Read the list of ingredients,\" she commanded.",
      "Diana obediently held up the scroll and began to read.",
      "After the second item, she could feel the color begin to drain from her face.",
      "By the time she reached the final ingredient, it was all she could do not to curse.",
      "She took a deep breath and lowered the scroll.",
      "\"Forgive my rudeness, my lady,\" she said.",
      "\"It would have been foolish of me to start my quest without knowing the difficulty.\"",
      "\"So you still plan to accept the quest?\" Athena asked, tilting her head to the side and fixing her with a curious look.",
      "\"Despite knowing the dangers?\"",
      "This time Diana didn't bother to hide her surprise.",
      "Had Athena thought she would take one look at the list and give up?",
      "\"Of course, my lady.",
      "It will be perilous, but I cannot....\" She faltered for a moment, her throat tightening as she thought of Bruce's besotted tone, the mindless way he had looked at her.",
      "\"I cannot bear what has been done to Batman.\"",
      "\"Very well, \"Athena said.",
      "Her expression was impossible to read, but Diana thought she saw regret in those grave features.",
      "Was Athena so certain that Diana would fail?",
      "Diana felt cold, suddenly, goose bumps rising on her bare arms.",
      "\"What are the ingredients?\" Hermes asked.",
      "He took the scroll from Diana's unresisting hands.",
      "As he read the list, his brow furrowed and his eyes narrowed.",
      "He looked sharply at Athena.",
      "\"Cousin, you cannot be serious.",
      "The princess has to ask a boon of each of the twelve?",
      "How will she survive?\"",
      "\"I will have to, that's all,\" Diana said.",
      "Hermes shook the scroll at her, face flushing with anger.",
      "\"You have to go to the Underworld and ask for a gift from Hades!\"",
      "he shouted.",
      "\"Did you forget that he wishes you dead?",
      "If you set foot in his realm, you will not return!\"",
      "Diana shook her head, determination replacing her earlier dismay.",
      "\"That will be the most difficult ingredient, true, but the others will not be half so dangerous.",
      "I will succeed.",
      "There is no other option.\"",
      "\"Other than defeat, you mean,\" Hermes said, still scowling.",
      "He turned the frown upon Athena.",
      "\"Surely there must be an easier way.\"",
      "She met his gaze coolly.",
      "\"You know as well as I do, cousin, there is not.\"",
      "As Hermes sputtered and waved the scroll around, Athena turned back towards Diana.",
      "\"I can help a little.",
      "I have already approached Hera and gotten her ingredient for you.\"",
      "Hermes held the scroll up.",
      "\"Oh, wonderful,\" he said in a loud, sarcastic voice.",
      "\"That will make things easier.",
      "So we've already got four of the twelve ingredients--Eros's arrow, Zeus's acorn, Hera's pomegranate juice, and your olives, cousin.",
      "That means we just need, oh, let's see, the chalice Hephaestus must create, the words I must give him to inscribe upon the chalice, Demeter's grain, Poseidon's salt water, Dionysus's wine--\" \"If you are going to throw a temper tantrum, cousin, you may step outside,\" Athena said mildly.",
      "\"You are not helping the princess with your antics.\"",
      "As Hermes tossed the scroll at Diana and then stomped out of the palace, grumbling under his breath, the goddess turned to another table and picked up a thin case and shoulder strap made of warm golden leather.",
      "\"Remember this, child,\" Athena said, opening up the case to reveal a space for eight vials of varying sizes.",
      "\"You must gather all the ingredients and follow the instructions exactly.\"",
      "\"Yes, my lady,\" Diana said, staring almost greedily at the two vials already enclosed.",
      "\"Read the list to me, let me know that you understand what you must do,\" Athena said.",
      "Diana handed her the vial containing Zeus's acorn to be stored safely in the case, and then cleared her throat and began to read.",
      "\"First, keep Eros's arrow.",
      "This will be Aphrodite's gift, albeit given unknowingly.",
      "Then you must gather eight ingredients from the gods, listed here, and request certain boons from the other four gods.",
      "The eight ingredients are these: a crushed acorn from one of Zeus's sacred oaks, two crushed olives from one of Athena's olive trees, the poison from one of Ares's sacred snakes, a vial of water from one of Poseidon's salt springs, the juice of a pomegranate given willingly by Hera, a vial of grain from Demeter's horn of plenty, a vial of wine from Dionysus, a white Asphodel flower from Hades's Asphodel Fields.",
      "As for the other four gods, first you must get words of power from Hermes that must be inscribed upon a chalice.",
      "Then you must give Hephaestus the words and have him make a chalice for this express purpose.",
      "Once you have gathered the eight ingredients, you must take them and the chalice to Hestia, who will blend the ingredients in the chalice and bless them.",
      "After that, the chalice and its contents must be first heated by a ride on Apollo's chariot, and finally cooled by Artemis in the moonlight.",
      "Then and only then may you dip the arrow into the potion.",
      "If you strike your mortal with this potion-enriched arrow, he will be freed from the spell.\"",
      "Diana stopped, taking a deep breath.",
      "It was not as daunting as it sounded, she told herself.",
      "She already had three of the ingredients, Hermes would gladly give her the necessary words, and she knew most of the gods and goddesses would aid her.",
      "Only Ares, Dionysus, and Hades seemed dangerous--Ares for his love of Aphrodite, Dionysus for his unpredictability, and Hades for his hatred of her and her mother.",
      "A cool hand pressed against her cheek.",
      "She opened her eyes to meet Athena's steady gaze.",
      "\"Heed my advice, child, if you insist upon this quest.",
      "Put off Ares and Hades as the last two to visit.",
      "Ares is likely to tell Aphrodite of your plan, despite his admiration for Amazons.\"",
      "\"I was planning on saving those two for last,\" Diana admitted.",
      "She tried to smile.",
      "\"Thank you for your aid, my lady.",
      "You have done much for me and Batman.\"",
      "\"Yes,\" Athena said, and stepped back.",
      "That earlier regret darkened her eyes and sharpened her words.",
      "\"I only hope I have not aided you swiftly to your death.\"",
      "Hermes seemed a little more composed when Diana left the palace, the case a reassuring weight on her back.",
      "\"Well, I thought we should go to Hephaestus first,\" he said before she could speak.",
      "\"Who knows how long my cousin will take to make the chalice.",
      "We might have all the ingredients before he's finished.\"",
      "\"Let us hope we are so swift,\" Diana said.",
      "\"Should I ask Lady Athena for a piece of parchment so you can write the words down?\" Hermes laughed.",
      "\"Not unless you like the smell of smoke,\" he said dryly.",
      "\"The words Hephaestus will need to engrave upon the chalice are not meant for parchment or mortals' ears.",
      "I will speak them to Hephaestus myself.\"",
      "\"Very well,\" Diana said.",
      "\"Let us go.\"",
      "Impatience forced her to push against the pressure and fly rather than walk towards Olympus's gates.",
      "She found herself breathing easier the instant they passed through the open exit.",
      "Perhaps some of her relief showed on her face, for Hermes shot her a concerned look.",
      "\"If you need to rest--\" he began, and stopped at the sharp shake of her head.",
      "\"I am fine.",
      "Just relieved to be on our way to Hephaestus's home,\" she said, and ignored the new look that crossed Hermes's face, a half-amused, half-exasperated look that she would try to lie to a god who was known for his trickery.",
      "\"You need not worry too much about Hephaestus,\" Hermes said.",
      "\"He bears no love for his wife, and besides, he has never been one to resist a challenge.",
      "It was Hephaestus who designed Eros's bow, you know, and Apollo's chariot, as well as many other useful items.",
      "He will make your chalice if you ask.\"",
      "\"I had known of Apollo's chariot, but not that he crafted Eros's bow,\" Diana said, surprised.",
      "She shook her head.",
      "\"I do not know why I am surprised.",
      "The bow is so powerful, who else could have made it?",
      "Neither Eros nor Aphrodite have any skill with the making of things.\"",
      "\"No,\" Hermes said after a moment.",
      "She glanced at him again, to see him looking almost rueful.",
      "\"They do not.\"",
      "Then he extended his hand.",
      "\"Come, Princess Diana.",
      "You are a swift flyer, but my sandals will take us there even faster.\"",
      "\"Thank you,\" Diana said gratefully, and took his warm, callused hand in hers.",
      "She would have to thank Eros and Psyche for asking Hermes's aid, she thought as she closed her eyes against the sudden wind whipping at her face, slapping her cheeks like blows.",
      "They were silent the rest of the journey, the only sound the wind rushing in Diana's ears.",
      "When they landed on the tip of Hephaestus's volcano, the rocks crunching beneath their feet, Hermes released her hand and said, \"Before we enter, there is one thing I should mention.\"",
      "She couldn't decipher his tone.",
      "When she looked at him, the god looked almost sheepish, shuffling his sandaled feet and kicking up a bit of ash.",
      "\"What is it, my lord?\" she asked.",
      "\"The last time I was here, Hephaestus and I did not part on the best of terms,\" Hermes explained, not quite meeting her eyes.",
      "She recognized the look now--it was similar to the one Wally wore when one of his jokes had not gone over well and he was trying to figure out a way to soothe the person's ire.",
      "\"My lord, what--\" she began, frustration tingeing her voice, and then stopped as the volcano suddenly shuddered beneath them.",
      "\"HERMES!\"",
      "a voice roared, loudly enough that Diana's heart leapt into her throat.",
      "She had to take a step back to steady herself.",
      "\"Hephaestus!\"",
      "Hermes called back, his too-cheerful voice slightly strained as his gaze darted around the top of the volcano.",
      "\"It has been a while, cousin!",
      "I have brought Princess Diana here to, ah--\" Hephaestus was nowhere to be seen, but somehow his voice rumbled in Diana's ears, making her head buzz with the sound.",
      "\"You stole my chariot, Hermes,\" the god snarled.",
      "\"Do you know how long that chariot took to build?\"",
      "\"You are the craftsman of the gods, Hephaestus, I would have thought it'd take you no time at all,\" Hermes called, still attempting jollity.",
      "Both he and Diana winced at Hephaestus's enraged growl.",
      "Diana cleared her throat.",
      "\"Lord Hephaestus, I am sorry that I brought Lord Hermes here.",
      "Had I known that he'd committed such an affront to you, I would not have brought him anywhere near your domain,\" she said.",
      "Hermes frowned and opened his mouth to protest, expression clearly meant to remind her he had to be here to provide the words of power, but she quelled him with a sharp look.",
      "\"However, my need is urgent.",
      "Aphrodite managed to use one of Eros's arrows upon my mortal friend before he could don the necklace.\"",
      "There was a pause, and when Hephaestus spoke again, his voice was quieter and almost sympathetic.",
      "\"I am sorry to hear that, little Amazon, but I do not see how I can help you.",
      "I cannot sway Aphrodite to take mercy, and I work with metal, not with broken hearts.\"",
      "\"Lady Athena has discovered a way to cure my mortal friend,\" Diana said quickly.",
      "\"Part of the cure is a chalice inscribed with certain words of power.\"",
      "\"And you need me to make that chalice,\" Hephaestus said slowly.",
      "\"Yes, my lord, and Hermes can give you the necessary words,\" Diana said, and held her breath.",
      "\"I will not have Hermes in my domain a moment longer,\" Hephaestus snapped.",
      "\"He will steal something else as soon as you or I look away.",
      "It's in his nature.",
      "He won't be able to help himself.\"",
      "\"That's true,\" Hermes agreed with a small grin.",
      "He shrugged at Diana's frown.",
      "\"What?",
      "Hephaestus speaks honestly.\"",
      "\"Then Lord Hermes will not stay in your domain, my lord,\" Diana said, thinking quickly.",
      "\"He can shout the words to you, and I will return alone to retrieve the chalice once you have finished.\"",
      "\"Very well,\" Hephaestus growled.",
      "\"But, princess, do not think I will treat you so kindly the next time you come asking a boon of me.",
      "I do this to spite Aphrodite, not to aid you.",
      "If you ever ask me for something else, you will have to pay a price.",
      "And gifts from the gods do not come cheap.\"",
      "Diana bowed her head although Hephaestus couldn't see her.",
      "\"I understand, my lord.",
      "I will do my best not to trouble you again.\"",
      "\"Well, Hermes?\" Hephaestus said impatiently.",
      "\"Speak the words and go!\"",
      "\"Oh, ah yes,\" Hermes said.",
      "He smiled quickly at Diana.",
      "\"You might want to cover your ears,\" he advised her.",
      "Diana obeyed, frowning in confusion.",
      "A second later, she understood.",
      "Even with her hands pressed against her ears, the words Hermes shouted went through her like a combined lightning bolt and thunderclap.",
      "Her knees threatened to buckle, and it was all she could to lock her knees and grit her teeth.",
      "When she finally pulled her hands away from her ringing ears, Hermes grimaced.",
      "\"Sorry, I forgot what an effect words of power have,\" he said.",
      "\"Let me know when your head is clear, and we will go.\"",
      "\"I am fine,\" she insisted, and then raised her voice.",
      "\"Thank you, my lord.",
      "I will return, alone, once I have gathered the necessary ingredients.\"",
      "Hephaestus didn't answer, save for the slight twitch of the volcano beneath their feet, as though the very ground wanted to knock Hermes off its surface and away from the immortal blacksmith's domain.",
      "\"Come, princess, let us go,\" Hermes said with an uneasy look.",
      "They flew for a few minutes before Diana asked, \"Before we continue, my lord, I need to know something.\"",
      "\"Yes?\" Hermes asked, nudging his hat further up his forehead so he could shoot her an unencumbered, curious look.",
      "Diana licked her dry lips, well aware that she was treading dangerous waters.",
      "Hermes was here to help her, but his promise to Eros only stretched so far as his patience.",
      "She spoke slowly, without inflection, \"Will any of the other gods and goddesses have reason to decry your presence in their domains?\"",
      "Much to her relief, Hermes laughed.",
      "\"No,\" he said.",
      "\"Ares is not fond of me, but then, Ares is not fond of anyone save for perhaps Aphrodite and you Amazonian warriors, and even he and Aphrodite are on the outs every other century or so.\"",
      "\"That is good to hear, my lord,\" Diana said, and tried to believe him.",
      "Demeter's abode was far simpler than the other gods on Mount Olympus, almost rustic.",
      "It was instead her gardens that were elaborate, ripe fig trees and golden wheat swaying in a wind that brought all sorts of pleasing smells to Diana's nose.",
      "She breathed in deeply.",
      "The pressure of Mount Olympus still pushed against her, but somehow it was easier to be back in the gods' domain with the scent of rich earth surrounding her.",
      "\"My lady?\" she called, coming to a stop under a fig tree and glancing around.",
      "\"Hera told me that I might have unexpected company,\" Demeter said, stepping out of the wheat field, the golden wheat parting before her and snapping back into place as though the goddess had never walked there.",
      "The goddess was handsome rather beautiful, her sun-reddened features exuding warmth and welcome as she smiled.",
      "When she clasped Diana's hand in greeting, black dirt was caught under her fingernails.",
      "\"So you are the Amazon all of Olympus is gossiping about,\" Demeter added.",
      "\"Aphrodite believes that Zeus rebuked you for your forwardness and sent you on your way, in case you were curious.\"",
      "The goddess laughed; a low, throaty sound of amusement.",
      "\"I overheard Algaia scolding Aphrodite quite fiercely over the issue.\"",
      "\"I am honored to meet you, Lady Demeter.",
      "Forgive me, but did you say someone was scolding Aphrodite?\"",
      "Diana echoed, fighting back a frown.",
      "\"I do not recognize the name of that goddess.",
      "Who is this Algaia?\" Demeter waved a hand dismissively.",
      "\"She's the youngest of the Graces.",
      "An outspoken girl, one who makes her opinions on Aphrodite's affair with Ares quite plain, although Aphrodite does not heed her.\"",
      "Her smile sharpened a little, turned speculative.",
      "\"You might like her, actually.\"",
      "\"I see,\" Diana said, although she didn't.",
      "How did Algaia get away with rebuking Aphrodite without fear of retribution?",
      "She set aside her confusion to ask, \"So Aphrodite thinks I am searching in the mortal realm for some other way to reverse the arrow's effects?\" Demeter shrugged, a slow, elegant movement.",
      "\"As far as I know.",
      "Now, what was it that you needed again?",
      "A piece of fruit?",
      "Something from my gardens, I know, although Hera was vague on the details.\"",
      "\"Some grain from your horn of plenty, my lady,\" Diana said, extending an empty vial to her.",
      "\"I thank you for your kindness.",
      "I will offer a sacrifice to you on Themyscira upon my next visit.\"",
      "\"A sacrifice,\" Demeter sighed, accepting the vial.",
      "Wistfulness colored her voice.",
      "\"We still receive the occasional sacrifice from a mortal believer, of course, but it is nothing like it was in the old days.",
      "A sacrifice would be most appreciated, child.\"",
      "She paused, a shadow creeping into her smile and darkening her eyes.",
      "\"Though you must offer a sacrifice on my daughter's behalf as well.\"",
      "Something twisted in Diana's chest at the fierce longing obvious in Demeter's face.",
      "\"You have my word that I will offer one for Lady Persephone, my lady,\" she promised.",
      "Then she hesitated, glancing at Hermes, who seemed oddly subdued in Demeter's presence.",
      "Lowering her voice though there was no one else around to hear, she asked, \"I travel to the Underworld soon.",
      "Do you have a message to give to your daughter?\" \"Princess--\" Hermes began, frowning, but Demeter's smile lit up her face and made her seem almost of an age as Psyche.",
      "\"You are a thoughtful child,\" she said.",
      "\"Tell Persephone that I love her and wait impatiently for when she can return to me.\"",
      "\"I will,\" Diana promised.",
      "She hadn't seen the goddess use her horn of plenty, but when Demeter handed the vial back to her, it was warm, as though the sun had touched it, and filled with golden grain.",
      "\"Thank you, my lady,\" she said with a dip of her chin.",
      "Some more of her earlier tension was easing with each passing moment.",
      "She was already almost halfway done with her quest, and so far the worst thing that had occurred was Hephaestus roaring at Hermes.",
      "True, the hardest parts came later, but at least the quest had begun well.",
      "\"Is there anything else you need, my lady?\" she added, tucking the vial into the case.",
      "\"A very generous child indeed,\" said Demeter, sounding amused.",
      "\"Go and complete your quest, princess.",
      "And try not to tarry in the Underworld too long.",
      "While my daughter will appreciate the company, I do not think Hades will.\"",
      "\"No,\" Diana agreed with a quick smile, \"he will not.",
      "Thank you again, my lady.\"",
      "\"She would have given you the grains in exchange for the sacrifice alone,\" Hermes said as soon as they were outside Olympus's gates once more--Poseidon did not often venture from his kingdom beneath the sea any longer.",
      "\"Why did you offer to bring a message to Persephone?",
      "You gave two gifts for the price of one.\"",
      "Diana glanced at Hermes, taking note of the honest confusion in his face.",
      "Had he not noticed Demeter's grief, as strong as Lysippe's loss despite the millennia and more since Hades had stolen her daughter away?",
      "\"Were I Persephone and my mother Demeter, I would ask of the few travelers who pass through Hades' halls for word from my mother,\" she said simply.",
      "\"How could I not offer to bring Persephone a message?\"",
      "\"How could you not?\" Hermes mumbled.",
      "He shook his head.",
      "\"That's all well and good, Princess Diana.",
      "I only hope you have not brought more trouble upon our heads.\"",
      "\"Do not tell me the messenger of the gods does not want to carry a message,\" Diana said, torn between amusement and exasperation.",
      "Surely passing along the message would do them no harm.",
      "Hermes grimaced, but subsided, putting on speed and turning towards Euboia.",
      "They had just reached the island itself and were flying over it when Hermes said abruptly, \"It seems we have company, Princess Diana.\"",
      "\"Company?\" Diana asked.",
      "Then she heard it, the loud whine of a plane speeding their way.",
      "She turned, narrowing her eyes, and caught sight of a familiar black jet.",
      "\"Bruce,\" she hissed, then remembered herself.",
      "She glanced sharply at Hermes, but he seemed oblivious.",
      "\"It's heading right towards us,\" he observed, tilting his head and frowning.",
      "\"We should get out of its way.\"",
      "\"It won't hit us,\" Diana said, adjusting her route and coming to a stop a few feet above the ocean.",
      "\"That's Batman's plane.\"",
      "She folded her arms against her chest and glared at the plane.",
      "\"Hopefully it is not Batman himself, since he should be strapped to his bed in Gotham.\"",
      "Hermes grinned crookedly.",
      "\"From what I have heard of your Batman, that means nothing.\"",
      "He watched the plane with growing interest.",
      "\"I suppose he should be accompanying you on this quest.",
      "You are doing this for his benefit, after all.\"",
      "Diana snorted, unamused.",
      "\"He will be no use to me in his state,\" she said.",
      "\"And I would prefer him in Gotham, away from the dangers.",
      "No offense, my lord, but mortals rarely fare well in interactions with the gods.\"",
      "\"True enough,\" Hermes said with a downward twist of his lips.",
      "\"Though Gotham has dangers of its own, I am told.\"",
      "Diana frowned, disquiet making her stomach clench.",
      "She thought of the Joker, of Two-Face, of all the villains who wanted Bruce dead, who would certainly take advantage of Bruce's situation.",
      "\"It does,\" she said, disquiet making the agreement come out hard and harsh.",
      "The jet landed lightly on the ocean's surface, churning water as the plane shifted into something that could actually float.",
      "As soon as the windshield of the plane had opened and a familiar costumed figure stood upon the nose of the jet, Diana flew closer.",
      "\"What are you doing here?\" she demanded, positioning herself so that they were face-to-face.",
      "She was close enough to see the sweat beading the line of Bruce's jaw, the sickly pallor made worse by the dark coloring of his costume.",
      "He was not quite as ill-looking as he had been before, but he did not look himself, not by any stretch of the imagination.",
      "\"You were supposed to stay home and I'd bring the cure to you!\"",
      "Bruce's eyes shone fever-bright behind his mask.",
      "\"I can't let you take these risks because of me,\" he said.",
      "The words came out hoarse as though they hurt him to say.",
      "\"I have Hermes to guide me, I will be fine,\" Diana said, attempting lightness.",
      "\"Besides, you would do no less for me.",
      "Or have you forgotten your encounter with Circe?\"",
      "Then a thought struck her, and she narrowed her eyes.",
      "\"I have not reported to the Justice League or to a certain concerned butler.",
      "How did you know where to find me?\" Bruce shrugged.",
      "\"I slipped a tracker under your bracelet when you handed me the necklace,\" he said, matter-of-fact.",
      "\"You slipped a--\" Diana closed her eyes, counted to ten--eva, ouo...oek'a.",
      "\"Batman, we have spoken about this before.",
      "I do not find your habit of putting tracers on my person endearing, even if I realize you do it out of concern.",
      "It's an invasion of privacy.\"",
      "She held her bracelets up to the sunlight, quickly found the small tracer.",
      "She handed it back to him.",
      "She would have preferred destroying it, but she knew how expensive the little device was, and was not so spiteful to cost Bruce thousands of dollars.",
      "\"We will discuss this later,\" she promised darkly.",
      "\"Once you are yourself again.\"",
      "\"Fine,\" Bruce said, and then just looked at her.",
      "The silent longing in his eyes, the tight misery in his jaw, all made her heart clench and her breath catch in her throat.",
      "\"I will have the cure soon,\" she told him, and searched his face for any sign of relief.",
      "She found none; he simply nodded and kept staring at her.",
      "She lowered her voice.",
      "\"Batman, you must go back to Gotham.",
      "You cannot help me.\"",
      "\"Eros's arrow didn't disable me completely,\" Bruce said.",
      "\"It simply opened my eyes to--\" He stopped, swallowed.",
      "\"It didn't disable me,\" he concluded.",
      "\"I can help.\"",
      "\"You will be a distraction,\" Diana argued.",
      "\"Go back, Br-- Batman!\"",
      "The command hung in the salty sea air for a moment, and then Bruce said, \"No.\"",
      "His broad shoulders bowed for a moment, his entire body curling in on itself as though Diana had struck him rather than ordered him homeward, but his voice was firm.",
      "Diana frowned.",
      "Hadn't Aphrodite said he would obey her every order?",
      "\"Go home,\" Diana said, putting as much authority into the command as she could muster.",
      "\"No,\" Bruce said again.",
      "\"Diana, I won't--\" He swayed a little, almost drunkenly.",
      "\"Don't make me,\" he said through gritted teeth.",
      "\"I have to do something.\"",
      "\"Bruce,\" she said, staring at him as he struggled against her order, his eyes sliding shut and a muscle jumping in his jaw.",
      "There, at last, was a hint of Bruce's true personality.",
      "She could see the stubbornness in his clenched fists and how fiercely he was fighting her command.",
      "Could Bruce perhaps fight against an order that went so much against his principles and beliefs?",
      "Diana took a breath, uncertain of what to say.",
      "She was glad to see that spark of obstinacy once more and learn that Bruce was not completely her puppet, but she didn't know if it would be better to keep him by her side or return him to the Manor.",
      "\"He might be useful,\" Hermes said from behind her.",
      "She jumped a little and turned to see him eyeing Bruce thoughtfully.",
      "\"Ares might appreciate Batman's skill in battle, and be more inclined to help us.\"",
      "\"Fine,\" Diana said.",
      "\"You may accompany us.\"",
      "Immediately Bruce relaxed, his shoulders squaring and his listing to the side stilling as he took a deep breath.",
      "His eyes half-opened, catching hers.",
      "\"Thank you,\" he said hoarsely.",
      "The fingers of her right hand twitched, wanting to press against his shoulder and give him a reassuring squeeze.",
      "She clenched her hand into a fist instead and said briskly, \"Just promise to let me and Hermes handle the gods.",
      "It won't do you any good to irritate Poseidon and have him turn you into a dolphin.\"",
      "\"I promise,\" Bruce said.",
      "Then he frowned.",
      "\"A dolphin?\"",
      "\"The Earth-shaker is almost as fond of dolphins as he is of his horses,\" Hermes informed him.",
      "The god glanced at the water lapping against the sides of the jet and frowned.",
      "\"How do we make our descent?",
      "I could manage it easily, but I know you mortals have trouble going too deeply too quickly.\"",
      "\"I brought diving gear,\" Bruce said.",
      "His expression was almost wry as his eyes caught and held Diana.",
      "It seemed to say, And just how were you going to get to Poseidon's home without me, exactly?",
      "The moment quickly passed, replaced by a mute, needy appeal that made Diana drop her gaze to the sea and silently curse Aphrodite once more.",
      "After a few seconds, Bruce cleared his throat.",
      "\"Just take us down slowly.\"",
      "The descent to Poseidon's kingdom was slow and strange.",
      "Diana saw schools of various beautiful fish, and then fish that grew odd and unusual in their appearance as the water darkened and the pressure and cold mounted against her gear.",
      "She was almost relieved when at last Hermes squeezed her arm.",
      "She could not see the god, but the tightening of his grip upon her arm signaled something.",
      "A moment later, the god stopped, and with another brief squeeze that seemed more reassuring than agitated, released her.",
      "She kicked at the water for a moment, squinting into the darkness and wondering what was going on.",
      "Then light appeared, so suddenly and brightly that she shut her eyes and grimaced.",
      "She was only half-aware that Hermes had taken her arm again, and was leading her forward.",
      "Air rather than water pressed against her then, and she opened her eyes in surprise.",
      "She found herself standing with Hermes and Bruce in a large, long corridor, the surrounding stone looking similar to marble but with a greenish tinge.",
      "\"Welcome to Poseidon's palace, Princess Diana,\" Hermes said.",
      "Diana's lips were numb from the chilly water, but after a moment she had worked her lips enough to say neutrally, \"It is not quite what I expected.\"",
      "Bruce, in the middle of discarding his diving gear, looked up.",
      "\"Shouldn't someone be here to greet us?\" he asked, and looked more like himself with suspicion darkening his eyes.",
      "As though in answer, three beautiful women appeared at the other end of the corridor.",
      "\"Welcome, welcome,\" one called, laughing and clapping her hands together.",
      "They moved as though they were dancing, sure-footed across the greenish tile towards Diana and her companions.",
      "\"Lord Poseidon has been expecting you.",
      "Will you come with us and be robed in clothes befitting guests of our lord?\"",
      "Diana glanced at Hermes, who shrugged.",
      "\"It's generally best not to refuse a god's hospitality,\" he said in a low whisper.",
      "\"And if Poseidon has already acknowledged you as a guest, you've won half the battle.\"",
      "\"We would be grateful for Lord Poseidon's thoughtfulness,\" Diana declared, smiling and inclining her head to the women.",
      "She stepped closer to Bruce, murmured, \"I know you will not want to take off your mask, but somehow ask politely for one you can wear in Poseidon's presence without offense.\"",
      "\"And if Poseidon insists I take off my mask?\" Bruce murmured back.",
      "\"Then you will have to,\" Diana said.",
      "She sighed at his scowl.",
      "\"I realize that will compromise your identity, but Bruce, he is the god of the sea.",
      "Who would he tell if he knew your true identity?",
      "Aquaman?\" Bruce snorted and continued to look disapproving as one of the women took him by the wrist and lead him through the doorway and into another room.",
      "\"Princess Diana, I hope you do not mind wearing a dress,\" one of the other women said.",
      "\"Lord Poseidon insists upon it.\"",
      "\"I have worn dresses before,\" Diana said, amused.",
      "Did the Nereid believe she wore only her battle gear, like Artemis only wore the garb of a huntress, or Ares wore his armor?",
      "\"Come with me, please.",
      "I am Neso,\" the woman added with a movement that was almost a curtsy.",
      "She studied Diana's features, and smiled.",
      "\"It seems Thetis was right--she had Maira make a dress that matched your eyes.\"",
      "Diana frowned.",
      "\"How does Thetis know my eye color?",
      "We have not met.\"",
      "Neso laughed.",
      "\"Child, you lived on an island.",
      "We might not interfere in the mortal realm anymore, but that doesn't mean we aren't curious enough to peek in on places like Themyscira from time to time.\"",
      "\"Ah, of course,\" Diana said.",
      "Neso showed her into a small bedchamber, where a dress the exact shade of Diana's eyes lay upon the bed.",
      "Diana bit back a gasp at the sight of it, and ran her hand reverently over the smooth, light fabric.",
      "When she changed into the dress, it swirled around her feet, feeling weightless.",
      "Neso studied her with a critical eye.",
      "\"The bracelets work well with the dress,\" she announced.",
      "\"The tiara and that case do not.",
      "Must you wear them?\" Diana pressed her hand instinctively to the tiara, its cold metal a reassuring constant.",
      "\"I would feel more comfortable with the tiara on,\" she admitted with a smile.",
      "\"Wearing only the bracelets would make me feel lopsided.",
      "And the case contains items that are precious to me.",
      "I cannot part with it.\"",
      "Neso sighed but didn't protest.",
      "\"Come, Poseidon has prepared a feast for you and your companions!\"",
      "Diana resisted the urge to frown.",
      "\"Poseidon's kindness is generous, but I regret that we really do not have time for a feast. We--\" \"My lord will insist upon a feast at the very least, even if you wish to be on your way,\" Neso interrupted, tone a little sharp.",
      "When Diana stared at her, the woman forced a smile.",
      "\"I'm sorry.",
      "It has been so long since we've had guests,\" she explained.",
      "\"If you tell my lord you wish to leave immediately, he will take offense.\"",
      "\"I see,\" Diana said.",
      "She pushed aside her own impatience--Bruce was here and safe for the moment, after all, and had not professed his undying devotion recently, which made everything a little more bearable.",
      "She inclined her head.",
      "\"Then I will thank Lord Poseidon for the feast.\"",
      "Poseidon did not exude quite as much power as his brother, but his presence was awe-inspiring nonetheless.",
      "His eyes were the same green of a stormy sea, and his thick curls the black of the deepest ocean depths.",
      "A wide smile warmed his thick, fleshy face as he shouted, \"Sit, sit, nephew.",
      "Sit, Princess of the Amazons.",
      "Sit, Batman of Gotham.",
      "Enjoy the feast I have prepared for you!\"",
      "He gestured broadly at the long table he was seated at the head of, the table's surface completely hidden by a dizzying number of plates of food.",
      "Diana turned to see that Bruce had, in fact, managed to convince someone that he should be wearing a mask.",
      "It was the same shade as his chiton, which was a dark green hue similar to seaweed.",
      "The color did not quite suit him, Diana observed, but he looked comfortable in the outfit.",
      "There was a touch of the playboy Bruce Wayne in the way he sat down at the table and smiled at both Poseidon and the Nereid who had escorted him into the room.",
      "\"You are more than generous, uncle,\" Hermes said.",
      "He, too, had kept his hat and winged sandals, but wore a chiton the pale blue color of a calm sea.",
      "He sat down at the table and immediately snatched something wrapped in seaweed from one of the nearby plates, popping it into his mouth with a grin.",
      "\"I have always been generous,\" Poseidon said loudly.",
      "He was, Diana began to realize, the type of god who always spoke in proclaiming tones, so that his words rang in his listeners' ears.",
      "Poseidon laughed.",
      "\"Tell me, Princess of the Amazons, I am more generous than my brother, am I not?\"",
      "\"Your brother, my lord?\" Diana asked as Hermes nearly choked on his food.",
      "\"Zeus!",
      "Zeus, of course!",
      "One of my naiads brought word of how he refused to aid you and your mortal companion here.\"",
      "Poseidon reached over and clapped a hand on Bruce's shoulder that made the man wince.",
      "\"Tough luck, that!\"",
      "he continued.",
      "\"Always thought my brother allowed Aphrodite too much freedom with those arrows and that bow.",
      "Those damned arrows are always causing trouble!\"",
      "Hermes shot Diana a quick look that said to let him handle this bit of diplomacy, and so she stayed quiet as Hermes laughed and said, \"Truer words were never spoken, uncle!",
      "But Athena may have found a way to heal Batman, and Zeus did not say that Princess Diana could not seek aid from other gods and goddesses.\"",
      "\"So Athena's invented a cure, has she?\" Poseidon said, chuckling.",
      "\"Well, if anyone's able to figure out a way to do so, it would be Athena.",
      "Good head on her shoulders, that girl.",
      "A pity she never married.",
      "Imagine what sort of gods she could have brought into the world!\"",
      "\"Yes, a pity,\" Hermes said, with only the brief flickering of his gaze away from Poseidon to indicate his strain.",
      "Diana, meanwhile, tried to imagine stern-faced Athena with children, and failed.",
      "\"And what sort of cure has she thought up, then?\" Poseidon asked.",
      "\"I must gather ingredients for a potion, my lord, which will reverse the effects,\" Diana said.",
      "Poseidon let out a sharp bark of laughter.",
      "\"And that's why you've come to my kingdom, princess?",
      "To ask a boon of me?",
      "Not for my delightful company, it seems!",
      "A pity!\"",
      "\"The pleasure of your company is indeed delightful, my lord,\" Diana said smoothly, \"but I will not evade your question.",
      "I am here for a needed ingredient-- water from one of your salt springs.\"",
      "The atmosphere, which had been so cheerful a moment earlier, now turned tense.",
      "\"And what will you give me in exchange?\" Poseidon asked, fixing her with a sharp look.",
      "\"No boon from the gods comes for free, princess.",
      "Any god or goddess who hasn't demanded something from you in exchange for an ingredient had an agenda.\"",
      "Diana saw Bruce tense.",
      "She quelled him with a brief touch of her hand to his knee, and then refocused her attention on Poseidon.",
      "\"I am but an Amazon, my lord, and no goddess.",
      "I could not guess what you would want from me, but I'll gladly give what you wish in exchange for the water.\"",
      "\"Diana,\" Hermes breathed quietly, low enough that only she heard his soft protest.",
      "\"Well said, princess,\" Poseidon said after a moment, and some of the tension left the room.",
      "He rested his chin on his fist, looking at her with a thoughtful gleam in his eyes.",
      "Then he chortled, apparently striking upon a pleasing idea.",
      "\"You are a princess of the Amazons, women known for their skill in battle, but not their riding skills.",
      "Ride one of my horses around this table without falling from its back, and I will give you what you ask for.\"",
      "\"Ride a horse around this table,\" Diana echoed.",
      "She glanced at her companions.",
      "Bruce frowned, but said nothing.",
      "Hermes wore an unreadable look.",
      "\"I accept the exchange, my lord.",
      "Shall I ride the horse after the meal?\"",
      "\"After the meal,\" Poseidon agreed, and then chuckled once more, pushing a plate closer to her.",
      "\"Now eat up!",
      "You'll need your strength!\"",
      "\"Diana,\" Hermes hissed as Poseidon bellowed for another jug of wine to be brought to the table.",
      "\"Have you ever ridden a horse?\"",
      "\"One or twice,\" Diana said, and shook her head at Hermes's despairing groan.",
      "\"What should I have done, then?",
      "It's either ride a horse or go back to the surface empty-handed!\"",
      "Hermes didn't argue, just drank a long draught of his wine.",
      "\"I suppose we'll see if one of Poseidon's horses is strong enough to break even an Amazon's bones,\" he muttered into his drink.",
      "\"Quiet,\" Diana said sharply, but thankfully Bruce had been distracted by a smiling Nereid offering him a sweetmeat.",
      "\"If you imply I will be injured, I do not know how Bruce will react,\" she whispered.",
      "\"He is under enough strain, understand?\" \"Very well,\" Hermes said, and then surprised her by taking her wine glass away when she reached for it.",
      "\"Poseidon's wine is stronger than your mortal attempts,\" he explained.",
      "\"You'll need a clear head.\"",
      "Diana watched Bruce listen gravely to whatever the Nereid was saying, all trace of his playboy disguise gone as she leaned over his shoulder.",
      "There was only polite interest in his smile as he nodded at what the Nereid had just said and accepted a plate from her.",
      "\"Yes,\" she said, looking away.",
      "\"I will.\"",
      "\"Here are my stables!\"",
      "Poseidon announced, throwing the doors open with a clang.",
      "None of the horses so much as twitched an ear, apparently used to the god's loud entrances.",
      "\"You may pick whichever horse you like for the challenge.\"",
      "\"Thank you, my lord.",
      "That is generous of you,\" Diana said, and then murmured to Hermes, \"Do you know anything of horses, Lord Hermes?\"",
      "\"I do,\" Bruce said as Hermes shrugged.",
      "A strained smile flickered on his face at Diana's surprise.",
      "Gently, so that only she could hear, he added, \"What, do you think Bruce Wayne never goes to the races?\"",
      "\"I,\" Diana said, and stopped.",
      "In all honesty, she paid little attention to what Bruce did in his playboy disguise.",
      "She could not escape that particular alter ego, of course, when Bruce Wayne's antics so often dominated the news, but she did not make a habit of prying into that part of Bruce's life.",
      "\"Thank you,\" she said at last even as she handed the case to Hermes for safe-keeping.",
      "Bruce nodded, and then turned towards one of the nearby stalls, making his way down the aisle.",
      "He examined each horse carefully.",
      "At last he returned, bringing with him a mare the color of pale sea foam, prancing lightly on her hooves.",
      "The halter and saddle were made of a metal that looked like gold, glittering in the torchlight.",
      "\"This one,\" Bruce said.",
      "\"All of Poseidon's horses are spirited, but she'll listen to you if you're confident enough.\"",
      "\"You have an eye for horseflesh!\"",
      "Poseidon roared.",
      "If anything, he looked delighted at Bruce's choice.",
      "\"Well then, princess, let's see how you ride!\"",
      "Bruce handed the reins to Hermes and then knelt, offering Diana his cupped hands.",
      "She stared at him for a moment, but his features were obscured by the new mask.",
      "She put her foot in his hands, felt his hands tighten briefly, and then she swung her other leg over the back of the mare.",
      "Scarcely had she gotten her seat when the mare snorted and began to prance away from Bruce, tugging sharply at the reins Hermes still held.",
      "\"I think you will need these,\" Hermes said dryly, handing the reins to Diana.",
      "She gripped them tightly, and then tighter still as the mare shook her head and then began to trot away from the onlookers, heading towards the open door.",
      "\"We'll be waiting at the table, princess!\"",
      "Poseidon called, and began to laugh as the mare increased her speed.",
      "Diana tugged on the reins to no avail; the mare continued to canter down the varying hallways.",
      "No matter how much she strained at the reins, the horse just flattened her ears and went where she willed, jostling Diana's breath from her.",
      "Everything was a blur, the salty air stinging Diana's eyes as the mare galloped down one corridor, then another.",
      "At last Diana pressed her cheek against the mare's neck and snapped in her ear, \"All right, you've had your fun, but it is time to behave.",
      "You will go where I want, or you will regret it.\"",
      "The horse snorted, and Diana tugged the reins sharply to the left, just in time to avoid a startled Nereid, her arms full of dirty dishes.",
      "\"I do not have time for this!\"",
      "Diana yelled, the sound loud enough that the mare hesitated briefly, whickering a soft sound of surprise.",
      "\"We are going to see your lord, understand?\" she said, not knowing if the horse could understand her, but hoping so.",
      "This was one of Poseidon's prized horses, after all; surely she would be intelligent.",
      "\"Now, go to Poseidon!\"",
      "The mare huffed, sounding almost sulky, and then turned and cantered in an entirely new direction.",
      "Diana clutched grimly at the reins and hoped this wasn't another trick.",
      "\"Took you long enough!\"",
      "Poseidon bellowed when she and the mare galloped into the room and began their route around the table.",
      "\"We were beginning to give up on you, princess!\"",
      "The mare came to a stop in front of her master, sticking her nose into his hair and snuffling.",
      "\"I thought your horse might enjoy stretching her legs, my lord,\" Diana said, starting to dismount.",
      "Immediately her leg muscles locked.",
      "\"Gods!\"",
      "The exclamation escaped her lips before she could bite it back, and she nearly fell from the mare's back.",
      "Only Bruce's sudden grasp of her waist prevented her from shaming herself by tumbling from the saddle.",
      "\"Diana,\" he said, dark eyes narrow in the slits the mask provided him.",
      "\"Let me help you.\"",
      "\"My legs are a bit sore,\" she explained, embarrassed by the concerned looks both Bruce and Hermes were directing towards her.",
      "\"It is nothing serious.\"",
      "\"Perhaps you lost track of time, princess, but you've been riding through Poseidon's palace for three hours,\" Hermes remarked from where he sat sipping at a glass of wine.",
      "\"Had you been mortal, I suspect your legs would have fallen off during that ride.\"",
      "\"Three hours?\"",
      "Diana echoed in disbelief.",
      "It had seemed only minutes.",
      "No wonder her legs ached so, the muscles knotted and painful.",
      "Through a haze of discomfort, she let herself slide from the saddle into Bruce's grasp, only realizing as his arms wrapped around her that she should probably have refused his assistance.",
      "\"Diana,\" he whispered; his breath was warm on her ear.",
      "\"You should rest.\"",
      "\"I'll have Neso the Nereid take me to my room,\" she tried to say, but then Bruce let out a quiet, shuddering sigh and held her closer, his lips tickling the spot right under her ear.",
      "Her legs now felt wobbly, though she told herself that was from the riding.",
      "\"Hermes, let me give you that salt water!\"",
      "she heard Poseidon shout, then roar with mirth.",
      "\"I hope the poor mortal won't have to drink the stuff.",
      "Useful, my salt springs are, of course, but tasty they are not!\"",
      "\"Thank you, my lord,\" came Hermes's quieter reply, and then Bruce was leading Diana from the room.",
      "\"Bruce,\" she tried to say, but her legs felt even worse with each passing step, and she gave up on protesting.",
      "It would be pure foolishness to push Bruce away only to crumple to the floor, she told herself.",
      "She would have to let Bruce take her to her bedchambers and then send him away before Eros's arrow made him do something they'd both regret.",
      "\"Here's the bed,\" Bruce whispered in her ear, and she sank gratefully onto the covers.",
      "\"By all the blessed gods, that was something I wouldn't wish to experience again,\" she sighed, stretching out her legs and wincing as the strained muscles protested.",
      "She jumped at a sudden pressure on her leg.",
      "She looked down at the top of Bruce's head, for he was kneeling next to the bed, his hands cupping one ankle carefully.",
      "\"Bruce!\"",
      "\"You need rest,\" he said, not looking up at her as he removed one boot.",
      "\"I know you're a warrior and can sleep anywhere and in any situation, Diana, but I don't think you'd actually enjoy sleeping in your boots.\"",
      "He removed the second boot and leaned away from the bed, one hand resting on the bed next to her knee.",
      "She could feel the warmth radiating from his skin.",
      "His hands were bare, she realized.",
      "Apparently he had convinced his attendant to leave him a mask, but not gloves.",
      "His hands seemed strange, uncovered; she could see the light brushing of hair on his knuckles.",
      "She caught up his hand, the one close to her knee, and turned it so that his palm was open towards the ceiling.",
      "Diana studied the calluses he'd earned through years of fighting and building his machines, the small white scars.",
      "Sometimes she wondered how people saw Bruce Wayne in his civilian disguise and didn't immediately recognize his hands as those of a warrior.",
      "\"Diana,\" Bruce whispered, sounding as though he were choking.",
      "She dropped his hand with a start, shame warming her face.",
      "How could she force her touch upon him when she knew he couldn't refuse her?",
      "\"Bruce, I am sorry,\" she said quickly.",
      "He looked at her, then, and reached up to tug his mask off and drop it onto the floor.",
      "Unmasked, she could see the warring emotions twisting his features, the full intensity of his dark gaze.",
      "\"Diana,\" he said again.",
      "\"I know what you told me, but I-- I want--\" He swallowed.",
      "\"You know how I feel,\" he said hoarsely.",
      "\"Why are you fighting this?\"",
      "The misery in his voice made her answering misery taste bitter as she shook her head.",
      "\"If you hadn't been struck by Eros's arrows, you wouldn't be acting this way,\" she said.",
      "\"How could I take advantage of you when you're like this?",
      "You would never forgive me once the potion clears the arrow's poison from your system.",
      "Iwould never forgive myself.\"",
      "\"And I am telling you that Eros's arrow did nothing but tear the veil from my eyes!\"",
      "Bruce snapped.",
      "\"These emotions, they're real, Diana.",
      "I don't understand why you keep arguing--\" \"One, dating within the team always leads to disaster,\" Diana said, words clipped and precise.",
      "She watched Bruce wince.",
      "\"Two, I'm a princess from a society of immortal warriors, and you're a rich kid with issues--\" \"Stop,\" Bruce said.",
      "\"You can't hold that speech against me, Diana.",
      "Time has passed.",
      "My feelings have changed since then.\"",
      "\"No, they haven't,\" Diana said.",
      "\"Yes, they have,\" Bruce said, frustration sharpening his words.",
      "When Diana shook her head, Bruce groaned.",
      "\"You don't believe me.",
      "Will you believe me if I approach you once we've used the potion?\"",
      "It took a moment for Diana to gather enough breath to speak, to make certain her voice was steady and her expression calm.",
      "She would not let Bruce see how much that question had hurt.",
      "\"You won't,\" she said.",
      "\"You will banish me from Gotham for a few months, participate in as few Justice League issues as possible, and after a few months, you'll relent enough to treat me as a friend again.\"",
      "\"Did I miss when Apollo gave you the gift of prophecy?\" Bruce asked bitterly.",
      "\"You sound like you can see the future.\"",
      "\"I am no seer, but I know you,\" Diana said.",
      "\"You don't know me as well as you think, princess,\" Bruce said, turning the title into an insult.",
      "He rose to his feet, snatching his mask from the floor, and turned to go.",
      "Halfway to the door, he paused and turned back.",
      "On his face was a look of mingled anger and resignation.",
      "\"Have you given up, then?\" Diana couldn't help it; she laughed.",
      "It was a quiet, melancholy sound, one that made Bruce frown.",
      "\"I will never give up, Bruce,\" she said quietly.",
      "\"Perhaps you don't know me as well as you think, either.",
      "You should know I am no quitter.\"",
      "Bruce was silent for a long moment.",
      "Then he tugged his mask back onto his face.",
      "\"Get some rest, Diana,\" he said, and left before she could speak.",
      "She stared at the closed door, and then leaned back against the pillows, throwing one arm over her eyes.",
      "\"Oh, Hera help me,\" she muttered.",
      "\"Let Dionysus's ingredient be a simpler trade.",
      "I cannot take another day of this.\"",
      "She slept fitfully.",
      "When she woke, all her muscles seemed turned to stone, from her neck to even the tendons in her feet.",
      "She groaned, rubbing at the knotted muscles in her thighs and cursing under her breath.",
      "\"Have this drink, Princess Diana,\" Neso said, entering with a steaming goblet and sympathetic smile.",
      "\"It is diluted ambrosia.",
      "It will help your muscles heal.\"",
      "\"Thank you,\" Diana gasped, drinking greedily.",
      "She tasted spices, heady on her tongue, warming her as the drink hit her belly.",
      "The warmth spread through her limbs swiftly, and in a few minutes, Diana felt well enough to rise.",
      "\"Thank you,\" she said again, and looked around for her clothing.",
      "She changed back into her clothes, handing the rumpled dress off to Neso with an apologetic grimace.",
      "\"Do not look so dismayed, Your Highness!\"",
      "Neso said with a laugh.",
      "\"This is fabric created by Arachne before Lady Athena turned her into a spider.",
      "The wrinkles will come out soon enough.\"",
      "\"Where are Lord Hermes and Batman?\" Diana asked.",
      "\"They are eating breakfast with Lord Poseidon before you depart.",
      "Lord Poseidon did not think you would want food after the ambrosia, but you are welcome at the table.\"",
      "\"Thank you,\" Diana repeated.",
      "In fact, she did not feel hungry at all, all her fatigue and hunger replaced by boundless energy.",
      "She adjusted her tiara and smiled.",
      "\"May the gods bless you, Neso.\"",
      "Poseidon was in the middle of a story when Diana entered, but he broke off from telling the tale long enough to roar out a greeting to Diana.",
      "Then he continued the story, something about the Nereid Galene's chance meeting of the king of Atlantis a few centuries ago.",
      "\"Not hungry, Princess Diana?\" Hermes whispered as Poseidon chortled at his own jest.",
      "\"I drank some diluted ambrosia,\" she whispered.",
      "\"That was kind of my uncle,\" Hermes said, and then clapped loudly at Poseidon's tale.",
      "Once Poseidon had finished his story and Bruce and Hermes had finished their meal, Diana cleared her throat.",
      "She didn't look at Bruce, who hadn't so much as glanced her way when she'd entered.",
      "\"My lord Poseidon, thank you for your hospitality and the ambrosia.",
      "You have been more than generous.\"",
      "Poseidon snorted.",
      "\"I couldn't let you hobble out of here, princess, looking like Hephaestus on one of his worse days.",
      "Go and get the rest of your ingredients.",
      "I look forward to hearing from one of my naiads that you've succeeded.\"",
      "He tossed two small, gleaming items, one towards her and another towards Bruce.",
      "She caught hers, and blinked.",
      "It was a small pearl.",
      "\"Chew and swallow it, and you'll be able to make the journey to the surface easier.",
      "Still need those odd contraptions you brought with you, of course, but you won't get a headache if Hermes brings you to the surface too quickly,\" the god explained.",
      "\"No ringing in the ears or difficulty breathing, that sort of nonsense.\"",
      "\"Thank you, my lord.\"",
      "Diana placed it in her mouth.",
      "It collapsed against her teeth with a quiet crackling sound.",
      "The pearl tasted of salt, its texture like tiny pieces of sand as she chewed and swallowed.",
      "Unlike the ambrosia, she felt no difference.",
      "\"If I'd known you were so hospitable, uncle, I would have visited your kingdom more often over the years,\" Hermes said, rising to his feet.",
      "\"Shall I come and tell you all of the adventures of this quest in person?\" Poseidon tugged at his beard and snorted.",
      "\"So long as you do no embellishing,\" he began, sounding stern, and then belied his words by laughing and declaring, \"Ah, embellish all you like, nephew!",
      "Tell me how she stole a lightning bolt from Zeus, or a peacock from Hera.\"",
      "Hermes grinned and looked thoughtful, as though he was already imagining what sort of stories to tell during his next visit.",
      "\"So who are we beseeching next?\" Hermes asked once they were back upon the surface, Bruce standing on the nose of his jet and Diana hovering over one of its wings.",
      "\"I thought Dionysus,\" Diana said, and Hermes nodded.",
      "\"Better him than Ares or Hades, eh?\" he said.",
      "Bruce frowned.",
      "\"What about Ares or Hades?\" he asked, and Diana realized that the full details of the quest had never been explained to him.",
      "She frowned at Hermes and said quickly, \"Just as I asked a boon of Poseidon, I must ask a boon or trade from a few more gods.",
      "Then Hestia will be able to mix the ingredients, Apollo and Artemis to temper them, and then you will be cured.\"",
      "Bruce's frown deepened.",
      "\"If I remember my mythology--\" he began.",
      "\"Let me figure out where Dionysus is.",
      "Hopefully he's in a good mood,\" Diana said and turned on her earpiece.",
      "\"Code 21Q, Wonder Woman to Zatanna.",
      "Code 21Q, Wonder Woman to Zatanna.\"",
      "\"Diana?\" Zatanna sounded surprised, which Diana supposed was understandable.",
      "Although they had become friends after the incident with Circe, they worked and lived in different circles and rarely had the opportunity to spend time together.",
      "\"Yes.",
      "Zatanna, I am sorry to rush you, but I need a favor.\"",
      "\"Treat me to a dinner at that great Greek place in Metropolis where you're a celebrity next time we're both in the city, and you've got a deal,\" Zatanna said.",
      "Diana could picture the other woman's smile.",
      "\"What do you need?\"",
      "\"The current location of Dionysus.\"",
      "There was a beat of silence.",
      "\"Diana.",
      "Please tell me you aren't going to use this information to go talkto him.\"",
      "Diana smiled at the concern in Zatanna's voice.",
      "Unlike the other gods, Dionysus had openly ignored Zeus's rules about non-interference and could often be found in the mortal world.",
      "The magic community kept close tabs on the god-- his presence had a tendency to throw otherwise stable or neutral magic into chaos.",
      "\"I'll be fine, Zatanna.",
      "I have Batman and Hermes with me.\"",
      "\"Batman and Hermes--right, not even going to ask,\" Zatanna said, huffing out a disbelieving laugh.",
      "\"Give me a minute; let me see if I've got anything concrete....He's on Crete right now.",
      "Is that all you need?\"",
      "\"Unless your sources know if he's in a good mood or not,\" Diana said wryly, and laughed at the baffled silence that answered her.",
      "\"Thank you for your help, Zatanna.\"",
      "\"No problem,\" Zatanna said, sounding troubled.",
      "\"Just be careful, okay?",
      "Dealing with gods is...chancy.\"",
      "\"Believe me,\" Diana sighed, \"I am all too aware of that fact.\"",
      "She turned the earpiece back off, ignoring the way Bruce had his arms folded against his chest and was frowning dangerously.",
      "\"Well, let us go to Crete!\"",
      "she said, and leapt into the air before Bruce could speak.",
      "Behind her, she saw Hermes shake his head and extend a hand to Bruce.",
      "A few seconds later, they were flying next to Diana.",
      "Bruce seemed to be shouting something, probably about Ares and Aphrodite, but Diana pretended not to notice.",
      "Instead she put on another burst of speed.",
      "Crete was over 400 kilometers away, after all.",
      "Unsurprisingly, they found Dionysus at a bar.",
      "He was in his younger guise today, looking like a youth who'd only just begun puberty, the soft golden fuzz of a first beard covering his jaw.",
      "He looked too young to be drinking, Diana thought, but none of the other customers seemed bothered about his age.",
      "They were more puzzled by his wife, who looked unfazed by the curious glances directed her way.",
      "Ariadne leaned comfortably against her husband, draping a possessive, slender arm around his neck and stealing the occasional sip from his wine glass.",
      "She looked the same age she had when she had died and Dionysus had seized her and Semele from the Underworld, a beautiful young woman of twenty-some years.",
      "Her expression was vague and flushed from wine, but it sharpened as she noticed their approach.",
      "\"It seems we have company, beloved,\" she said.",
      "She spoke in the slow, languid way of the extremely inebriated, her eyes half-lidded as she studied Diana, Bruce, and Hermes.",
      "\"I wonder what an Amazon, a mortal, and a god have come to ask of you.\"",
      "\"Cousin!\"",
      "Dionysus said brightly, in a soprano that sometimes deepened unexpectedly into tenor.",
      "\"What brings you to Crete?",
      "And in such unusual company, as well!",
      "You must have a fascinating story to tell.\"",
      "Diana met Dionysus's eyes, and immediately wished she hadn't.",
      "Dionysus was in one of his more dangerous moods today, his eyes gleaming with madness and cruel mirth.",
      "She closed her eyes for a moment, dizzy.",
      "\"I am guiding Princess Diana of the Amazons on a quest, cousin,\" Hermes explained.",
      "Diana opened her eyes and glanced at the messenger god.",
      "Judging by the strain in his too-bright smile, Hermes too had noticed Dionysus's dangerous humor.",
      "\"A quest!\"",
      "Dionysus's smile faded, replaced by the beginning of a scowl.",
      "\"My Ariadne and I are not fond of quests.",
      "Theseus was on a quest when he abandoned my beloved.\"",
      "He tenderly stroked Ariadne's arm as he spoke, as though to reassure himself that his wife was here, not in the Underworld or still abandoned on Naxos.",
      "\"This is a very different quest, cousin,\" Hermes explained.",
      "\"Princess Diana seeks to cure our companion, Batman of Gotham, of the infatuation caused by one of Eros's arrows.\"",
      "\"You needn't explain,\" Dionysus said irritably.",
      "\"I know the mark of the arrows' madness well enough.\"",
      "He stared at Diana.",
      "She met his gaze without blinking, ignoring the roiling of her stomach.",
      "\"So you are trying to cure him?\"",
      "\"Yes, my lord.\"",
      "\"Why?\" Ariadne asked, tilting her head and looking curious.",
      "Diana glanced at Bruce, but he continued to avoid her gaze, his eyes focused instead on Dionysus and Ariadne.",
      "\"Would you have wanted Dionysus to fall in love with you through Eros's arrows, my lady?\" she asked.",
      "\"Dionysus's love for you is still remembered by the mortal world even today.",
      "Eros's arrows never tainted that moment when Lord Dionysus first beheld you on Naxos.\"",
      "Ariadne laughed.",
      "\"I like you,\" she said, and then said in a carrying whisper, \"Dionysus, do help them.",
      "I know quests are worse than useless, but I like her.\"",
      "Some of the madness ebbed from Dionysus's face and he caressed Ariadne's cheek.",
      "\"Whatever you want, dearest,\" he told her, voice affectionate, and added without looking away from Ariadne's smiling countenance, \"Is there any way we could aid you, princess?\"",
      "Diana took out one of the vials.",
      "\"We need some of your wine, my lord.\"",
      "Dionysus laughed, a wild, delighted sound.",
      "\"Someone is making sport of you, Amazon.",
      "If your mortal there drinks my wine, his infatuation will not be cured, only replaced by another type of madness.\"",
      "\"Lady Athena gave me a list of ingredients, my lord.",
      "I am certain she would not lead me astray,\" Diana said firmly.",
      "\"Athena,\" Dionysus growled.",
      "\"No, she wouldn't, the spoilsport.",
      "Ah well, I've promised Ariadne I would help you, and I never break a promise to her.\"",
      "He snapped his fingers.",
      "Instantly the large vial filled with a wine of a deep purple shade.",
      "\"Thank you, my lord,\" Diana said.",
      "Dionysus removed his hand from Ariadne's face long enough to wiggle his fingers in a clear go-away signal.",
      "\"You begin to bore me,\" he announced, and then cast a speculative look at Bruce.",
      "\"You, however, intrigue me.",
      "I've seen you before.\"",
      "\"Have you?\" Bruce said without any inflection.",
      "\"I seem to remember myths where you caused madness in mortal minds.",
      "Perhaps you have seen me fighting some of your handiwork.",
      "There is a mortal who calls himself the Joker--\" \"Oh, oh, oh!\"",
      "Dionysus said, laughing in pleased surprise.",
      "\"How could I have forgotten you?",
      "Batman of Gotham.",
      "Gotham is such a fun place-- so many minds teeming with desperation, on the edge of madness.",
      "All it takes is one little push--\" Bruce stepped forward, but Hermes seized him by the elbow and dragged him backwards.",
      "\"Stay away from Gotham,\" Bruce growled, and if the situation wasn't so terrible, Diana would have laughed.",
      "Of course Bruce would tell a god to leave his city alone.",
      "\"You are ordering me to stay away from your city,\" Dionysus said, fixing him with a sharp, intrigued gaze.",
      "\"Has Eros's arrow damaged your mind more than just twisting your feelings for the Amazon, mortal?",
      "Or do you truly think I'll be swayed by that growl and glare of yours?\"",
      "When Bruce continued to glower, Dionysus laughed.",
      "\"You do think I'll obey the command of a mortal!",
      "Oh, how novel!",
      "You are an amusing little mortal.\"",
      "\"Stay a--\" Bruce began, and stopped with a grunt, presumably because Hermes had stepped on his foot.",
      "\"He is quite a character, cousin,\" Hermes agreed with a nervous laugh.",
      "\"And now we must be going.",
      "So good to see you, Ariadne, you look as lovely as ever.",
      "See you in a century or two!\"",
      "He dragged Bruce backwards as he made his exit.",
      "Diana bowed.",
      "\"Thank you again for your assistance, my lord, my lady,\" she said, and then followed after Hermes and Bruce.",
      "When she stepped out of the bar, it was in time to see Hermes shake Bruce and snap, \"You are lucky he didn't turn you into a tiger and have you draw his chariot!\"",
      "\"He threatened Gotham,\" Bruce said stubbornly.",
      "Diana sighed.",
      "If the ambrosia had not still been warming her belly, she would doubtless be dealing with a throbbing headache right now, both from Bruce's recklessness and from meeting Dionysus's eyes.",
      "\"Batman, Hermes, we only have two more items to gather,\" she said.",
      "\"What's done is done.",
      "Let's not bicker.\"",
      "\"Fine,\" Hermes said.",
      "\"Are we saving Hades for last, or does Ares have that pleasure?\"",
      "Diana shook her head.",
      "\"Ares first, then Hades,\" she said.",
      "\"We will need all of our strength and no distractions to venture into the Underworld.\"",
      "Ares could often be found on Aretias, one of his sacred islands.",
      "Diana approached the island with a sensation of mingled nervousness and an odd, exulting excitement.",
      "What would Ares ask in exchange for the snake's venom?",
      "She imagined herself challenging the god to a match, and something in her cried out in fierce joy.",
      "It had been too long since she had allowed herself to fully devote herself to a battle, to not have to constantly check her attacks before she harmed her opponent.",
      "She could use all of her strength against a god without fear.",
      "Ares was sharpening a spear when they landed in the clearing.",
      "A vulture fluttered on a nearby branch and grumbled at their approach and a few of the dogs milling around the god's feet eyed them with interest, but Ares didn't look up from his spear.",
      "\"So the Amazon comes at last to me,\" he said.",
      "\"I have heard you are a fierce warrior, little princess, and seen the wreckage of more than one of your battles.\"",
      "\"I am a warrior, my lord,\" Diana said.",
      "Anticipation hummed sweetly in her veins.",
      "\"In fact, I have come to propose a challenge.\"",
      "She ignored Hermes's startled look.",
      "\"A challenge?\" Ares finally looked up, his thick eyebrows beetling over his eyes.",
      "\"What sort of challenge?\"",
      "\"When was the last time you faced an Amazon in battle, my lord?",
      "Fight me.",
      "If you are impressed with my skill, you will give us a small vial of venom from one of your blessed snakes.\"",
      "\"And if I am not impressed?\"",
      "\"Then I will make another offer for that venom, something that would better please you,\" Diana said promptly.",
      "After a moment, a wide grin spread across Ares's features, puckered the small, thin scar that had just missed mutilating his lips.",
      "\"Amazons!\"",
      "he roared with approval, setting aside his spear and slapping his knee.",
      "\"If only Hera would set aside that stupid ban on men visiting Themyscira!",
      "We could have such glorious fights.\"",
      "He sighed, almost looking wistful.",
      "\"Very well, Amazon, we shall fight, but the weapons will be of my choosing.\"",
      "\"Agreed,\" Diana said, and ignored Bruce's hoarse protest.",
      "She grinned at the god, baring her teeth.",
      "\"I am ready whenever you are, my lord.\"",
      "\"I am in the mood for wrestling,\" Ares announced.",
      "Diana studied him, the good foot in height he had over her, the way his gleaming muscles bulged whenever he so much as breathed.",
      "Her smile didn't falter.",
      "\"Wrestling sounds perfect,\" she said.",
      "A minute later, Ares had taken a stick and dug the skamma in the center of the clearing.",
      "\"No modern rules,\" he ordered.",
      "\"We'll stick to the proper, traditional way of wrestling, to three points.",
      "Hermes will be the referee-- an impartial one, unless he wants to incur my wrath.\"",
      "\"Of course, my lord,\" she said.",
      "She watched him take off his armor, revealing the dirty, sweat-stained tunic underneath it, and his boots.",
      "She took off the tiara and her bracelets, pressing them into Bruce's hands, and then toed her way out of the boots.",
      "\"Keep them safe for me, please,\" she said.",
      "\"Princess Diana, this is madness,\" Hermes said.",
      "\"Not madness,\" Bruce corrected, \"but an unnecessary risk.\"",
      "\"No risk at all,\" Diana said.",
      "\"Ares won't be so sloppy as to kill me, and I plan to give him a match he won't soon forget.\"",
      "Hermes sighed and shot her a curious look.",
      "\"I had heard gossip that Ares was father to your queen, but I admit, I never put much thought into that rumor until now,\" he muttered.",
      "\"It seems more likely by the minute.\"",
      "Diana shook her head.",
      "\"My mother is not Ares's daughter,\" she said, and then turned away, stepping into the square where Ares impatiently waited.",
      "\"We shall begin the match on the count of three,\" Ares said.",
      "\"One...two...three!\"",
      "He roared out the number, and then charged, sand flying away from his bare feet.",
      "She darted forward to meet him, enjoying the surprise that flashed in his eyes.",
      "She slid under his legs, careful not to let her back touch the earth, and then threw herself upon the god's back, wrapping her legs around his waist and slinging one arm around his chest.",
      "The other arm went around the god's throat, trying to choke Ares's breath from him.",
      "Ares roared and thrashed around, staggering precariously close to the edge of the square.",
      "After a minute, however, his struggles knocked Diana's arm away from his chest, and he reached up to grab her other arm.",
      "A second later she found herself flying, off the god's back and rolling near and past the line, all the way to Hermes's feet.",
      "There was a beat of silence.",
      "\"Point to Ares,\" Hermes said weakly.",
      "Diana got to her feet, taking a deep, careful breath.",
      "The throw had been powerful, but she had not landed wrong.",
      "She wouldn't even bruise.",
      "She smiled at Ares.",
      "\"Well done, my lord,\" she said, stepping back into the skamma.",
      "As soon as she had stepped back into the square, Ares charged again, lowering his head like a bull.",
      "This time she did not slide underneath him, but instead darted to the side, watching gleefully at the god skidded to a stop, toes almost touching the edge of the skamma.",
      "Ares grinned dangerously and began to circle her, watching for any openings.",
      "\"Running away from me, Amazon?\"",
      "\"Not at all, my lord,\" Diana informed him sweetly.",
      "\"You simply seemed in such a rush to be out of the skamma, I hated to be in your way.\"",
      "Ares laughed, and she struck in that brief moment, coming at the god low and hard, aiming for his knees.",
      "The god's laughter changed to a shout of surprise as he stumbled and tipped back over the line.",
      "\"Point to Diana!\"",
      "Hermes shouted.",
      "\"Your mother taught you well, Amazon,\" Ares said.",
      "\"Never let your guard down in a match.\"",
      "He stepped back into the skamma, and she waited the appropriate few seconds before she darted at him, watching him plant his feet to brace for the impact.",
      "At the last second, though, she stopped her forward momentum and leapt backwards, out of the god's reach.",
      "\"You are hovering so close to edge, my lord,\" she said with a mocking laugh.",
      "\"Do you long for the easy point that would come from grabbing my wrist and sending me flying back to Lord Hermes's feet?\" Ares snorted.",
      "\"And meanwhile you dart and prance around like a fool,\" he said.",
      "He crooked a finger at her.",
      "\"Come and test your strength against me, girl.\"",
      "She looked again at his broad shoulders, his height, his muscles, and grinned.",
      "\"Thank you for the invitation, my lord,\" she said, and stepped forward to meet him in the middle.",
      "She planted her feet in the sand, caught his hands to hers, and pushed hard.",
      "Her feet slid slowly through the sand for a moment as Ares shoved back, then the movement stopped as she grunted and pushed harder.",
      "Ares grinned down at her, his face flushed.",
      "\"You might be strong, girl, but no Amazon is a match for a god,\" he said.",
      "\"We'll see,\" Diana said through gritted teeth even as Ares grinned wider and forced her back another few meters.",
      "She strained against him, winning back a few meters even as her shoulders and arms protested at the exertion.",
      "Slowly, Ares pushed her back until she knew the edge of the skamma was an inch away from her heels.",
      "She grinned up at him even as he made that final push and shoved her from the skamma.",
      "\"You may be stronger, my lord, but you'll find brute strength isn't everything.\"",
      "The remark came out breathless.",
      "Ares snorted, stepping back to the center of the square even as Hermes called out, \"Point to Ares!\"",
      "\"You sound like Athena, girl,\" he said.",
      "\"She's always talking about strategies and battle formations.",
      "She doesn't appreciate the way your blood heats up during a fight, how sometimes you have to just ignore plans and revel in the madness of battle.\"",
      "\"I can appreciate a good strategy,\" Diana admitted, stepping back into the skamma.",
      "She rotated her neck slowly, heard something pop in her spine as she stretched and continued, \"But there is something to be said to just letting yourself go in a fight.\"",
      "Ares chuckled and lunged at her, his large, meaty hands catching hold of her wrists and lifting her off her feet.",
      "He spun her around and around until wind roared in her ears and she could barely breathe.",
      "Then he threw her.",
      "She landed hard enough to send up a spray of sand.",
      "She blinked away sand, listening for Hermes's cry of, \"Point to Ares!\"",
      "When none came, she threw herself to the side, narrowly avoiding Ares as he grabbed for her once more.",
      "He had either misjudged his throw or was enjoying the match too much to end it.",
      "Diana spun to face him just as he charged again.",
      "This time she let him come, standing there unmoving despite Bruce's cry to get out of the way.",
      "Ares grinned as he rushed at her, but that grin was replaced by a flicker of surprise as Diana dropped to one knee.",
      "A second later, the god's eyes widened with understanding, but it was too late--Diana already had one hand planted on his stomach, and the other wrenching his arm, using his own momentum to toss him over her shoulder and out of the skamma.",
      "\"Point to Diana!\"",
      "Ares got to his feet slowly.",
      "Frustration now flushed his face, made a vein pulse in his temple.",
      "She watched him warily.",
      "Ares was well-known for his temper.",
      "He would not kill her, but he wouldn't be adverse to breaking a limb or two if he grew too vexed that a mere Amazon had matched him point-for-point.",
      "\"Nice trick, Amazon,\" he said sourly, re-entering the skamma.",
      "\"Now let us see if you can use your wits to get out of this one.\"",
      "Diana braced herself, but she was not expecting the large, muscular god to move so swiftly, or to hook one foot around her ankle and send her toppling to the sand.",
      "She was already struggling to her feet when Ares grabbed her arm and wrenched it behind her back.",
      "The pain flared in her shoulder, and she bit back a pained sound.",
      "He was going to make her tap out, she realized, to assuage his wounded pride.",
      "She gritted her teeth and struggled, for she was not going to give up without a fight, but she swiftly realized Ares had the advantage.",
      "She was trapped on her knees, unable to gain any leverage, and Ares had her arm in an iron grip.",
      "She fought against his grip, wrenching her shoulder even more as she tried to struggle to her feet.",
      "\"I don't think so, girl,\" Ares said into her ear.",
      "\"Give the sand a little tap and your discomfort will be over.\"",
      "When she didn't immediately tap the sand, he grunted in frustration and gave her arm another painful wrench.",
      "Her joint screamed in agony, and she saw stars.",
      "He would dislocate her shoulder if she continued to fight, she realized, and she couldn't go into the Underworld with a dislocated shoulder.",
      "Grimacing, she tapped the sand.",
      "Immediately Hermes cried, \"Point and match to Ares!\"",
      "and Ares released her.",
      "She rose to her feet, pride keeping her from immediately rubbing at her shoulder.",
      "Instead she kept her throbbing shoulder stationary and used her other arm to don her boots and tiara.",
      "She left the bracelets in Bruce's grasp.",
      "She would put them on once out of Ares's eyesight.",
      "She would not wince in front of him.",
      "\"Congratulations, my lord,\" she said.",
      "\"What did you think of the match?\"",
      "\"Well fought!\"",
      "Ares roared.",
      "\"I have not had such a match since the last great heroes thought to test their mettle against me.",
      "You can have that venom with my gratitude, girl!\"",
      "He pursed his lips and whistled a loud, demanding note.",
      "A second later, a brightly colored snake emerged from the tree-line, winding its way to Ares's feet.",
      "Hermes stepped forward, offering the vial and studying the snake with interest.",
      "Despite her discomfort, Diana gaped at the snake as well--she would never see its like in Man's World, for that sacred breed was now extinct save for the few that Ares kept near him.",
      "\"Good girl,\" Ares crooned at the snake as he coaxed the venom from its fangs and into the vial.",
      "After a minute, he handed the vial back.",
      "\"Will you stay for a meal?",
      "I was planning to hunt boar.\"",
      "\"Thank you for the offer, cousin, but we have a few more trips to make today,\" Hermes said.",
      "\"Perhaps another time.\"",
      "It was not until they were away from the clearing that Diana allowed herself to rub her shoulder and gingerly test the joint.",
      "The pain was beginning to subside, thankfully-- there would not be any damage besides some soreness.",
      "Once they had flown a few miles away from the island, Diana came to a stop in mid-air.",
      "Hermes stopped as well.",
      "\"I need my bracelets,\" she said, extending a hand for them.",
      "Bruce hesitated, and then handed them over, Hermes holding tightly to his elbow as he did.",
      "She laughed a little at their identical expressions of disapproval even as she winced and carefully put on the bracelets.",
      "\"You two look as stern as Lady Athena.",
      "We got the venom, didn't we?",
      "And without explaining why we needed it, no less!",
      "He will not go running to Aphrodite.\"",
      "\"You might have explained your plan beforehand,\" Hermes said.",
      "\"Can we at least discuss how we're handling our adventure into the Underworld?",
      "Hades will not welcome you with open arms.\"",
      "\"I thought we might appeal to Lady Persephone,\" Diana said.",
      "She shrugged at Hermes's incredulous look.",
      "\"She has little love for her husband.",
      "If we asked her for a flower from the Asphodel Meadows, she would agree out of spite and gratitude when we bear Lady Demeter's message to her.\"",
      "\"There's an idea,\" Hermes murmured, looking less disapproving now.",
      "Bruce's expression still hadn't changed.",
      "\"I don't think you should go to the Underworld,\" he said.",
      "As Diana gaped at him in disbelief, he turned towards Hermes.",
      "\"Hades despises all Amazons, and especially Diana.",
      "If she goes, Hades would probably prefer the Meadows to burn before any flower could be used to help her.",
      "But if you go, alone, bringing a message from Demeter that must be said in private to Persephone, you could ask her for the flower in secret.\"",
      "\"This is my quest,\" Diana protested even as Hermes began to nod.",
      "\"I must get the flower myself!\"",
      "Hermes shook his head.",
      "\"Not entirely true, Princess Diana.",
      "After all, Athena gave you Hera's gift.",
      "You didn't have to collect it on your own.",
      "And this is your quest, true, but I've traveled with you the entire time.",
      "The Fates will not protest if I go in your stead.\"",
      "Diana scowled, but both Hermes and Bruce looked obstinate.",
      "And Hermes did have a point.",
      "If she was not there to incite Hades's fury, perhaps Hermes could get in and out of the Underworld without incident.",
      "\"Very well,\" Diana said with a sigh.",
      "She opened the case and pulled out the final vial, handing it to the god.",
      "\"Batman and I will go get the chalice from Hephaestus and I will meet you in Hestia's domain.",
      "Does that suit you?\"",
      "\"Yes,\" Hermes said.",
      "He hesitated, glancing between Bruce and Diana.",
      "\"Should I take you two back to Batman's jet and then go on to the Underworld from there?\"",
      "\"Since I can't fly, that'd probably be a good idea,\" Bruce said dryly.",
      "Now that he had made his point, he had returned to avoiding Diana's gaze.",
      "Diana flew ahead of Hermes and Bruce, torn between exasperation and amusement.",
      "Even with his thoughts and feelings befuddled by Eros's arrow, Bruce still managed to be irritatingly intelligent and persuasive.",
      "Bruce got into the jet without a word, motioning for Diana to lead the way.",
      "She paused for a moment, looking towards Hermes.",
      "\"You said Eros asked a boon from you,\" she said quietly.",
      "\"Yes,\" Hermes said, expression unreadable.",
      "\"If there is anything I can do to lessen his debt to you,\" Diana began, and stopped at Hermes's laughter.",
      "\"Princess, princess, princess,\" he said with a shake of his head.",
      "\"I don't know if you've noticed, but this is the most stimulation Olympus has seen in centuries.",
      "It is excitingto be around you.",
      "In fact, I'm almost tempted to tell Eros that just traveling with you has cancelled the debt.\"",
      "He grinned a little wickedly.",
      "\"I won't, of course, because having Eros owe me will doubtlessly come in handy later, but I am very nearly tempted.\"",
      "Diana found herself laughing.",
      "\"I am glad to have provided you with such amusement, my lord.",
      "I wish you a safe and speedy journey in the Underworld.\"",
      "Hermes started to go, and then paused.",
      "\"I will try to be as fast as possible, but time moves even more oddly in the Underworld than it does on Olympus,\" he said without looking at her.",
      "\"Try to keep your mortal alive until then, even if his arrow-induced sentimentality makes you want to strangle him.\"",
      "Diana glanced at Bruce, but he had his head bowed as he fiddled with some of the dials in his jet.",
      "\"I'll do my best.",
      "Farewell, my lord,\" she said.",
      "Hermes sighed.",
      "\"Farewell, Princess Diana.\"",
      "Hephaestus greeted them with a snort.",
      "\"You've got good timing, I'll give you that much, little Amazon.",
      "The chalice has been complete for only a few hours.\"",
      "He studied Bruce for a second.",
      "\"Are you the mortal, then, that has brought the princess twice to my doorstep?",
      "You should learn to keep away from arrows, mortal.\"",
      "Bruce frowned.",
      "\"Or maybe someone should keep the arrows away from Aphrodite and Eros,\" he said.",
      "Hephaestus, much to Diana's surprise, laughed.",
      "\"You might be right about that.",
      "Zeus would never hear of it, though. 'Love is Aphrodite's domain.'\" The last sentence was a reasonable good imitation of Zeus, enough that Diana had to duck her head to hide a smile.",
      "\"Here it is,\" Hephaestus said, limping over to a cabinet.",
      "When he pulled the chalice from the cabinet, Diana gasped.",
      "Even Bruce let out a quiet sound of surprise.",
      "\"It's beautiful,\" Diana said.",
      "The chalice was finely wrought, made of varying types of gold, the white-gold words of power nearly blazing from their position around the mouth of the chalice.",
      "She took the chalice with reverent hands.",
      "\"A masterpiece.\"",
      "\"Yes, a masterpiece that will be used once to cure your mortal and then never used again,\" Hephaestus grumbled.",
      "\"I will not let such beauty be wasted,\" Diana promised.",
      "\"If it pleases you and if those words of power will not cause any problem, I will take it to my mother after Batman is cured, ask her to use it in ceremonies on Themyscira.\"",
      "Hephaestus grunted, but she thought she caught the flicker of a pleased smile on his face.",
      "\"I suppose that'll do,\" he said.",
      "Then he scowled.",
      "\"Were you expecting some ambrosia and a free gift?",
      "You've got what you came for, now leave me alone!\"",
      "The last word was a roar that made the ground tremble beneath their feet.",
      "\"Thank you for all you've done, Lord Hephaestus,\" Diana said quickly, and then seized Bruce around the waist and flew upward, out of the opening at the tip of the volcano.",
      "She landed lightly on the wing of Bruce's jet.",
      "\"Sorry,\" she said, immediately releasing him and stepping back as he strapped himself into the pilot's seat.",
      "\"I did not want to overstay our welcome.\"",
      "\"It's fine,\" Bruce said, busying himself with the board of flashing lights and dials.",
      "\"Where do we go next?\" Diana blinked, and then flushed as she realized she still hadn't explained things properly to him.",
      "\"Once Hermes has gotten the flower, we will have all the necessary ingredients.",
      "I will go to meet him at--\" \"I?\" Bruce said sharply.",
      "\"Don't think you're leaving me behind.\"",
      "\"The ingredients can only be blended together and blessed by Hestia, who resides upon Mount Olympus.",
      "You cannot go there.\"",
      "\"Then let me wait outside the gates,\" Bruce argued.",
      "Diana snorted.",
      "\"Now who's being unreasonable?",
      "Aphrodite will realize something's going on if she spots you lingering outside the gates of Mount Olympus.",
      "Go back to the Manor.",
      "I will bring the potion once it's complete.\"",
      "\"So what's left to complete the potion?\" Bruce said, not moving.",
      "Diana sighed.",
      "\"Nothing dangerous, I swear by Hera.",
      "Hestia needs to bless it, and then the chalice must be heated by a ride upon Apollo's chariot and then cooled by Artemis under the moonlight.",
      "Go home, Bruce, and keep the arrow and the necklace close to you.\"",
      "\"Diana,\" Bruce said quietly.",
      "His dark eyes met hers once more.",
      "\"Swear to me you'll come to the Manor as soon as the potion is ready.\"",
      "\"Of course I swear,\" Diana said.",
      "She looked at him for another moment, the muted longing in his eyes, how his gloved fingers drummed on the arm of his pilot seat in an agitated tempo.",
      "She resisted the urge to pull off his mask and smooth his rumpled hair away from his face, reassure him that all would be well.",
      "\"I will see you in a day or two, depending on how long Hermes takes.",
      "Wait at the Manor and let Robin and Huntress protect Gotham for a little while longer.\"",
      "Bruce nodded, and then the jet came to life in a rumble of sound.",
      "Diana flew back, watching the vapor trial long after the jet had disappeared from view.",
      "Then she sighed and turned for a third time to Mount Olympus.",
      "Hestia greeted her with a sympathetic cry.",
      "\"Oh, my poor dear!\"",
      "she exclaimed, throwing her arms around Diana's neck and nearly squeezing the life from her.",
      "\"Hera told me all about your troubles.",
      "I wonder at Aphrodite's wickedness, I truly do.",
      "I don't claim to understand men well, but from what Psyche has told me, your Batman was well on his way to falling in love with you in the natural way!",
      "Why did Aphrodite have to muddle things so?\"",
      "The torrent of words left Diana almost dizzy.",
      "\"Thank you for your kind words, my lady.",
      "Hermes has gone to fetch the last ingredient from the Underworld, and then we shall be ready for your blessing,\" she said.",
      "\"Of course, of course, but you must eat, child.",
      "You look as though you haven't eaten in days.\"",
      "\"I had a meal at Poseidon's palace,\" Diana said, but it was a faint protest as Hestia began to ladle something from a pot bubbling on her hearth.",
      "A draft brought the scents of carrots and meat to her nose, and her mouth began to water.",
      "\"Fresh vegetables from Demeter's garden, and rabbit caught by Artemis.",
      "I bet you've never tasted the like,\" Hestia announced, setting the bowl and a spoon on her table and gesturing for Diana to eat.",
      "Diana obeyed, nearly closing her eyes in bliss.",
      "The soup was indescribable--somehow Hestia had managed to blend the perfect balance of vegetables, meat, and spices.",
      "She ate the soup slowly, and didn't protest when Hestia pressed another steaming bowl upon her.",
      "\"There!\"",
      "Hestia said with satisfaction.",
      "\"That should put the lost weight back on your bones.",
      "You mustn't forget to eat, child, even when things go wrong.",
      "The strongest warrior cannot hope to defeat even the weakest if he's starving.\"",
      "Diana opened her mouth to thank her once more when the door to Hestia's house burst open and Hermes entered, red-faced.",
      "\"Nearly bumped into Aphrodite on my way here,\" he gasped, and offered his vial to Hestia before he collapsed into the nearest chair.",
      "\"Here, aunt, a flower that cannot compare to your beauty.\"",
      "\"Flatterer,\" Hestia said with a merry laugh.",
      "\"Now then, set the chalice and ingredients before me, and I'll make you your potion.\"",
      "Once the items were before her, Hestia arched an eyebrow.",
      "She tapped the vial containing the snake venom.",
      "\"Hera mentioned the ingredients were on the unusual side.",
      "I'm beginning to think she understated things.",
      "Athena says these ingredients blended together will cure your mortal?\"",
      "\"Yes, my lady,\" Diana said.",
      "\"All right then.\"",
      "Hestia rubbed her hands together.",
      "\"No particular order that they must be put into the chalice, correct?\"",
      "\"Athena didn't mention an order,\" Hermes said.",
      "Hestia nodded and bowed her head, both hands hovering over the chalice.",
      "\"I bless this chalice.",
      "May the potion created fulfill its purpose.\"",
      "She put the wine in first, then the pomegranate juice, then the water from the salt spring and the snake venom together at the same time.",
      "Then came the crushed olives and acorn together, then the grain, and finally the white Asphodel flower.",
      "Diana could not see into the chalice, but Hestia hummed in satisfaction, cupping the chalice in her hands and raising it towards her hearth.",
      "\"I bless this chalice and its contents,\" she said, repeating the words three times as she slowly shook the chalice and let the ingredients blend together.",
      "After she had finished the chant, she returned the chalice to the table.",
      "Now Diana could see that the potion had turned a deep pink.",
      "\"Shall I call Apollo and Artemis here for you?\" Hestia asked.",
      "\"Apollo is no doubt tending to his horses, so if you want him to take the chalice with him today, you'll want to get him now.\"",
      "\"Please,\" Diana said.",
      "\"I want Batman back to normal.\"",
      "Hestia clucked sympathetically.",
      "\"Of course you do, dear.",
      "Let me go and fetch them.\"",
      "When Hestia returned, the twins strode into the room as though they owned the place.",
      "They both had the appearances of youths, although Apollo's long hair was immaculate and Artemis's threaded with leaves and sticks.",
      "\"So this is the chalice,\" Apollo said, giving it a curious glance.",
      "\"Athena has outdone herself again.\"",
      "He looked a little sour, which was explained by the next words out of his mouth.",
      "\"I wonder why she couldn't figure out this cure when Ineeded it to undo Eros's use of the lead arrow upon my beloved.\"",
      "\"And which beloved was that?\"",
      "Artemis said dryly.",
      "\"You've had so many, I can't really recall faces or names.\"",
      "When her brother ignored her, Artemis turned to Diana.",
      "\"It's a pity you've been foolish enough to fall in love,\" she said bluntly.",
      "\"But I suppose if you had to fall for a man, that Batman is not a bad choice.",
      "He hunts his prey well.\"",
      "\"Thank you,\" Diana said, and glanced at Hermes for help.",
      "The god only grinned at her, unsympathetic with her plight.",
      "\"I had some of Hestia's soup.",
      "The rabbit you caught tasted wonderful.\"",
      "Artemis grinned in satisfaction, and then gave her brother a hard clout on the shoulder.",
      "\"Stop gawking at the chalice and sulking, and take it to your chariot!",
      "Unless you want the mortals to start panicking when the sun doesn't rise.\"",
      "\"I'm going, I'm going,\" Apollo said peevishly, \"if only to get away from you.\"",
      "The god snatched up the chalice and left.",
      "\"Tell your mother I will be visiting in a year or two,\" Artemis said.",
      "\"It has been too long since my maidens and I have hunted alongside the Amazons.\"",
      "\"I will,\" Diana promised.",
      "\"And I'm certain my mother will look forward to it.\"",
      "\"I'll bring the chalice back here once the potion's cooled,\" Artemis said, and left as abruptly as she'd entered.",
      "\"I'm afraid Artemis enjoys ignoring manners and politeness,\" Hestia said.",
      "\"Another bowl of soup?\"",
      "\"No, thank you.",
      "Those two bowls have been more than nourishing.\"",
      "\"Of course, of course,\" Hestia agreed.",
      "She surprised Diana with another hug.",
      "\"Now, don't mind me as you say good-bye to Hermes.",
      "I'll go see if Athena needs a meal.\"",
      "Once Hestia had bustled out the door, Hermes and Diana stood silently for a moment.",
      "\"Please pass along my gratitude to Eros and Psyche,\" she said.",
      "\"Please pass along my regret to Batman that I didn't see him in his natural habitat or state of mind,\" Hermes said, surprising Diana into only slightly bitter laughter.",
      "\"I will,\" she promised, and caught Hermes's hands in hers.",
      "\"Thank you for everything you did these past few days, my lord.\"",
      "Hermes tugged his hands away from hers, and then patted her gently on the head, being careful to avoid her tiara.",
      "\"Go well, princess.",
      "I look forward to our next meeting,\" he said.",
      "\"What makes you so certain there will be a next meeting?\" Diana asked, and Hermes laughed.",
      "\"You've spoken with Zeus, met the other eleven members of the Pantheon.",
      "Do you think the gods and goddesses will forget about the unusual little Amazon who demanded boons from them?",
      "If you thought your life was interesting now, Amazon, you have no idea.\"",
      "Diana sighed.",
      "\"Sometimes I long for a boring, uneventful life,\" she said.",
      "\"No, you don't,\" Hermes said.",
      "Diana smiled, thinking of the Justice League, how well Donna had looked on Themyscira, Bruce.",
      "\"No, I don't,\" she agreed.",
      "Being cooled by the moon had apparently turned the potion silver.",
      "Diana clutched the chalice to her chest as she took a deep breath and knocked on the door of the Manor.",
      "The door swung open after only a few seconds.",
      "Either Alfred was supernaturally fast or he'd been waiting next to the door.",
      "He bowed, the early morning light catching in his hair.",
      "\"Master Bruce said you might be arriving soon, Your Highness.",
      "Shall I take the chalice?\"",
      "She hesitated, but this was Alfred.",
      "She couldn't imagine him dropping anything in his life.",
      "\"It's the potion,\" she said, and watched his eyes widen for a second before the man resumed his neutral mask.",
      "\"I took the liberty of keeping the arrow and the necklace together in the Cave,\" he said.",
      "\"If you'll follow me....\" \"Where's Bruce?\" Diana asked when they got to the bottom of the stairs and it became apparent that Bruce was not there.",
      "\"On patrol, despite my misgivings,\" Alfred said, setting the chalice carefully down next to the necklace and the arrow.",
      "\"I will call him back to the Cave, if you'll excuse me for a moment.",
      "\"Go ahead,' Diana said absently, stepping closer to the arrow.",
      "She hadn't gotten a good look at it before, but now that it had been cleaned of blood and no longer embedded in Bruce's back, she could recognize Hephaestus's work.",
      "\"They will be here shortly.",
      "They were already returning home.",
      "Did you need anything, Your Highness?",
      "Tea? Biscuits?\"",
      "\"No,\" Diana assured him.",
      "\"I have been staying with Hestia, goddess of the hearth and meals for the past day.",
      "I have had enough food to last me a week.\"",
      "\"You should still take home some of Alfred's biscuits, Wonder Woman,\" Robin announced, entering the room with a grin.",
      "\"They're great.\"",
      "A hint of a smile lurked in Alfred's eyes.",
      "\"Thank you, Master Jason.",
      "Perhaps the princess will sample the biscuits another time.",
      "Right now, however, I think we all would prefer to have Master Bruce restored to his normal self.\"",
      "\"That's it?\" Bruce asked, peeling off his mask to reveal strained features puffy from lack of sleep.",
      "He frowned at the chalice.",
      "\"Interesting color.\"",
      "Diana dipped the arrow in the potion, watched as the liquid suddenly began to seethe and bubble.",
      "Once the liquid had subsided, Diana pulled the now-silver arrow from the chalice.",
      "\"Shall I administer the cure, or did you want to do the honors yourself?\" she asked, offering the arrow to him.",
      "Her hands did not tremble, though they very much wanted to.",
      "Bruce's lips twitched.",
      "\"I'll do it,\" he said.",
      "He pulled off his glove, exposing the pale underside of his arm.",
      "It was there he jabbed the point of the arrow in, grimacing and going a little pale, but otherwise not acknowledging his agony.",
      "The arrow dropped from his arm and Diana let it fall, reaching instead to steady Bruce as his eyes fluttered shut and he swayed on his feet.",
      "\"Bruce,\" she said quietly, cursing herself for lack of foresight.",
      "The original arrow had made Bruce collapse.",
      "Why wouldn't Athena's altered arrow do the same?",
      "\"Let me get you to a bed.\"",
      "\"No,\" he said hoarsely.",
      "\"I'm fine.\"",
      "He opened his eyes and smiled a little wryly.",
      "\"That arrow packs a punch, that's all.\"",
      "He showed her his wrist.",
      "\"At least it didn't scar.\"",
      "She was still holding his shoulders, she realized.",
      "She dropped her hands to her side and was taking a step back when Bruce's voice stopped her.",
      "\"Diana,\" he said quietly, meeting her eyes.",
      "Yes, that was the Bruce she knew-- no slavish devotion, just respect and a hint of stronger emotion lurking in his gaze.",
      "\"Give me a week?\"",
      "\"Only a week?\"",
      "Diana said, forcing a laugh.",
      "At least Bruce was no longer avoiding her gaze and did not seem quite as embarrassed as she thought he'd be.",
      "Perhaps he would not avoid her for too long.",
      "\"I would have thought you'd seen enough of my face to last you a month at least.\"",
      "\"Diana,\" Bruce said, sounding irritated.",
      "He pressed something into her hand.",
      "\"Keep this for me, please.\"",
      "Diana blinked and then looked down at her hand.",
      "Slowly she unfurled her fingers.",
      "There, nestled in her palm, was the tracker Bruce had stuck on one of her bracelets.",
      "\"What--\" \"So I can find you,\" Bruce said.",
      "When she tore her gaze away from the tracker, it was in time to see Bruce settling the necklace around his neck.",
      "\"Unless you don't want me to find you, of course,\" he added.",
      "It was his tone that caught her by the most surprise.",
      "It was a too-casual tone, the one used when someone was trying to feign indifference when they were anything but.",
      "She stared at him.",
      "\"What's going on?\"",
      "Robin whispered to Alfred.",
      "\"I believe we should give Her Highness and Master Bruce some privacy,\" was Alfred's only answer, and the man dragged a protesting Robin up the stairs and out of hearing range.",
      "\"Give me a week,\" Bruce repeated.",
      "He touched the necklace, readjusted it.",
      "His ears had gone pink, Diana noticed, such an appealing, vulnerable color that it was all she could do not to trace a finger around the edge of his ear.",
      "She watched him for a moment, almost in disbelief.",
      "This was almost too good to be true, but there was something in the tense way he held himself, as though he worried that either he or Diana would suddenly explode, made her believe he was earnest.",
      "She smiled and slowly attached the tracker to one of her bracelets.",
      "\"Bruce,\" she said, and something in her tone must have warned him, for he looked sharply at her.",
      "She took a step closer to him, and finally, finally allowed herself to reach out, pressing her hand to his cheek.",
      "He had shaved before going out on patrol, but already she could feel the scrape of a new beard against her hand.",
      "\"Come find me in a week, then.",
      "I might even apologize for trying to play prophetess.\"",
      "\"Diana,\" he said, but her name was breathed against her lips as she curled her hand around his neck and tugged him gently forward into a slow kiss full of promise.",
      "\"I will hold you to that one week,\" she said once she forced herself to end the kiss.",
      "Her lips tingled, and she watched in satisfaction as Bruce looked at her with half-lidded eyes and ran his tongue over his upper lip.",
      "\"If you haven't found me within seven days, Iwill find you,\" she added.",
      "Bruce smirked a little at that, mischief gleaming in his dark eyes.",
      "\"That sounds appealing, actually,\" he said.",
      "\"Be quiet,\" Diana commanded, and silenced his protests with another kiss."

    "text": "1. He watched. Eyes open wide. If they might be called eyes. Feathers instead then. Vane and rachis. Barb. They caught. The barbs. While the solar winds flowed through the hollow shafts. Hollow. Hungry. Perched as he was on the heliosphere, Hydrogen and Helium spark-crackled pinions. Filoplumes spike tufted as from a lover's hand. Love. Light. Profess love, he'd asked. Profess. He could be patient. He had all the time in the world. He had the Caritas of a million on million on million souls. Howling. From deep within the sun's heart, Death said, \"Everything dies.\" The solar winds blew and ions danced at the ends of pinions. He said, \"I have died twice.\" He did not say that he was brought back by his Father each time for some reason unknown. Surely for this. On this there was silence. Farther. He ignored Death. He was life now. Light. Alpha. Omega. Death said, \"What is dead, should stay dead.\" But he was ignoring Death at his shoulder. He watched. He looked down. The slow blue turn of life. Unaware of all this turn of spheres. He looked up. Flagella whipped by him as a bead of water slid over skin. Dean and Sam sat on the sun warmed hood of the Impala and looked out at the waves; they rolled in. Dean held a beer in his hand. Condensation dripped down the long neck and over his fingers. Slow slide. Slick. In the wide tabletop west, a drought stricken town ran slick with rain. Flooded with it and the rivers ran banks and the water like Caritas overflowed. Arms spread wide and the rain fell. Overfull, the clouds. There would be no more drought. No more thirst. \"Well, done,\" said Death in his ear as an Ameoba wrapped in loving embrace a Hypotrich, which waved it's cilia goodbye cruel world. Or possibly hello lover. It was hard to tell for all that he was ancient as the skin of the world. Protozoa skimmed cilia and water slid over skin. The drop fell. He fell once. For free will. There was no \"I\" in team. We. Inhaled sunshine. He saved the world. Exhaled doubt. A vampire nest burned in the sun. Exhaled despair. Djinn burned with smokeless fire. Exhaled. Dragon eyes caught light and screamed. Caught breath. Barbed breath. The ever spiraling scream from within. He looked up. Dean took a long slow swallow. Light beer and he was light shining down. Sun kissed and sun burned and freckled. Dean had one hundred and forty eight freckles turned up to the sun. He couldn't hear them from his perch on the sun. He could hear the screams. He always heard them. They were from the inside. Barbed howls. In space, there was no sound. He was full of sound. There was no \"I\" in God. Only We. He could hear them thunder from the falling drop of water. Dean and his brother were plotting to kill him. Death said, calm as the reflecting moon, \"Is this how you expected your choices to turn out.\" He listened to their plans. It was a sort of love. Attention. Heat. Hand on his shoulder and a smile. Beer. He turned a lake to beer. The fish all died. The drunks and the teenagers grew very drunk indeed and ill themselves because it was by no means filtered beer. But still. A lake of beer. Thin watered beer muck riddled. It rained little hot dogs wrapped in little pancake blankets. There would be no more hunger. He hungered. Once he was as tall as the Chrysler building that gleamed in the falling sunlight. That time was past. Once he was the size frail. So frail these human bodies. Wrung out torn on a hospital bed and emptied of grace on faith. Vacuoles drift. He healed everyone at that hospital yesterday. A flick of a miracle. Flagella. Flagellate. Barbules moved in the solar winds. They prayed. The ones he saved. Healed. They prayed. Dean took another drink from the long necked bottle between his fingers and said something to his brother. He wanted. Reached. Burned a bush in the desert. No one saw it. Fusion. Not fission. Fusion. Not fission. Fusion. Blinked. There would be no more hunger. No more thirst. Looked at the slowly rotating Earth. Felt the flow fall of water as the drip slid away. He stood before them. Silent and unseen. Brushed vane. Brushed rachis. Brushed barb over sun warmed freckles. Breathed in. Full then of celestial intent. Eight minutes and nineteen seconds away on the sun, he brushed beams. Dean leaned his head back in the sunlight. Throat open and blood beat. Breathed out. The sun breathed out. The protozoa skimmed cilia. He leaned forward. Fusion. Not fission. He considered what form his Caritas might next take. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 2. Dean rubbed at his eyes. The opposite of useful. They already felt like he'd sand blasted them. He blinked at the darkened room. At the pale light that grazed the solar system wall paper as a car drove down the narrow street outside. Another day spent in dead end research. Sam twisted knots in the bedding of the double bed across the room. Mumbled hell under his breath, but at least he was asleep. Dean glanced at the clock. 03:45 in bright red letters. He was never going to fall asleep. He considered getting up. But he'd wake Sam up. Least thing would. Dean stared at the wallpaper and watched the lights slide across the walls. His eyes closed. The rest stop was familiar. Which was about like saying the highway was familiar. He narrowed his eyes at the table in front of him. He kind of thought he'd totaled this table when he was thirteen and had hit 1st gear instead of reverse on the Impala. He swallowed some beer. Dad had been pissed. He'd been terrified. Horrified. His baby had forgiven him. Eventually. The table looked fine now. There was a Devil's seat at the back of the rest stop. Crowley polished it with a shroud. He stepped forward and the seat was a stand of tall dark green trees that smelled like summer and fancy closets. At the table, Death delicately dipped a long fork into a bubbling pot. Pulled out something covered in chocolate. Ate it in a precise bite. He dabbed at his lips with a red and white paper napkin. He said, \"You should have some. It's delicious.\" Dean picked up a fork. It was delicious. Death had good taste. The chocolate had cinnamon and chili in it and, \"There's tequila in here.\" Death stabbed a banana slice with his fork and ate another dip. Dean dipped a piece of chocolate cake. He took his time chewing. Swallowed his beer. Did what he did when scared shitless. Smiled his smile. \"This my last stop?\" Death drank from Dean's bottle. \"You're asleep and Sleep is the little brother of Death.\" He put down the bottle with an echoing thud on the table and far away thunder crackled with fireflies. \"I have something for you.\" Some part of him knew that wasn't good, but the chocolate really was delicious. Dean licked at the burning on his lips, no sense in it going to waste. Death put a wide shallow basket on the worn wooden table. The basket was full of little things. Dragons and toads and kittens and flowers. A burning bird meeped at him, little fellow. Blind. Runt of the litter. Pecked at by his brothers and sisters. Dean picked it up. It clung feebly to his fingers and stung like jalapeno and tequila on his lips. Blinked its wide blue blind eyes. Dean slipped it into his eye so it could see what he saw. He wanted to keep it safe. It swam from eye to eye and keened happily. \"Interesting choice,\" said Death. He dipped a piece of lime into the bubbling chocolate and ate it with white teeth that crunched. Dean hummed a bar from Iron Maiden's \"Hallowed be Thy Name\" and the bird sang guitar licks. Something struck him in the gut. Dean bent over at the blow. Fell off the bench. The rest stop gave way to an alley. It looked familiar. But was about like saying that the road looked familiar. Castiel yelled, \"I fell for you!\" Dean shook his head. He had to find Michael. It was the only way to stop Lucifer and save Sam. The world. Or, wait, no, they'd stopped Lucifer and, Castiel hit Dean again. Split his lips on his teeth and blood pooled in his mouth. Castiel picked him up and shook him and it felt good to be touched. \"I fell for you! Why can't you listen.\" Dean laughed, because really, what else could he do. Castiel hit him again and again. \"You're not broken.\" A blow landed. \"I healed you!\" Cas swung fists that bloodied and hands that lifted. \"I always heal you.\" Dean's shoulder burned. Dean laughed. He spat blood in Castiel's face. The blood burned and sizzled on Castiel's skin like a lighter to film. Pieces cracked and pealed away to leave light. He wanted to say he was sorry, but he couldn't stop laughing. It must be the burning bird in Dean's eye. Cas' eyes were the last to burn away. Wide blue celestial intent. Dean asked, \"What have I told you about personal space?\" as they burned to sunlight. It was a rhetorical question. Blinked his eyes open at the dawn and sighed. Another god damned day. He sat up. There was a dent in the pillow next to his. He brushed it lightly with his fingers. Sam watched him. Not much else to watch in such a small room. \"Dean, we need to talk.\" Dean rubbed his eyes. Dream that weird was just a dream. Maybe. He missed ganking ghosts. \"Yeah, Sammy. Let's talk over our personal feelings over a nice hot cup of cocoa. You go first.\" He looked at Sam a long moment. His eyes still felt like sandpaper. Snorted. \"I need coffee. You want any?\" Sam's mouth moved like he was chewing on broken glass words. But really, the Winchester family business may as well be their own ferry service up and down the river denial. \"Yeah. Sure.\" He looked at a large velvet picture of Saturn on the wall. Dean got their coffee. They clutched their caffeine lifelines. Drove the long road out to the end of the Keys to see a psychic Bobby knew. A little blue cottage at the edge of the wide sea. There was a sign on the door when they got there. \"Boys, you're both real cute. But since I'm psychic, I know I want no part of this. So, I'm visiting my sister in Phoenix. Actually, that's a lie. Me and my sister just don't get along. Maybe I'm at Disneyland. But I'm not home. There's beer and sandwich fixings in the fridge. Help yourself.\" She'd signed it, \"XOXO.\" They looked at each other and Dean shrugged. Nothing for it. Last week, they'd gone to a crossroads and tried to summon a demon. Got an empty dial tone and who the hell knew what was going on. They sat on the hood of the Impala. Drank beer and ate sandwiches on thick sour bread and watched the sun set over the sea. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 3. All those angry cries. \"Why doesn't God do anything to stop this?\" He stopped this. But this was vague. Car accidents. Plane accidents. He could stop them from happening. That lasted all of one day. It had unfortunately resulted in a large number of exploding cows. It seemed that changing the laws of the universe to prevent gas combustion from working was a bad idea. Also, electric cars still worked. In any case, there was the only prayer that mattered. \"Please, Cas. I know you're pissed at whatever and hopped up on soul juice, but don't take it out on my baby.\" He changed the universe back so gas would burn and cars that were not electric would go and cows would not spontaneously combust. One hundred and fifteen people died in the next hour as cars practiced physics on each other. He heard each one of them. Took up the souls as they went. Death offered him a hamburger on a toasted bun, but he wasn't hungry. Death ate it and smiled as an old red sun flickered out. \"There are always consequences.\" He ignored the death at his shoulder. He would be a fisher of evil men, but it was harder than one might think. Before or after? He bounced long metal pipes through an evil man's windshield, but that might have been before. It was hard to tell, but for a brief moment, Dean believed. Smiled at him. Even if he couldn't see. He wanted Dean to see. He wanted. He sent angels, his now, they were his angels, to pull every mother and child from burning buildings to safety. There were Hosannas. There was an upswing in arson. He was powerful and not powerful enough. Screams in his ears. Songs then. He absorbed heaven. Annexed. Consumed. Conquered. He contained his favorite heaven and watched the snow fall. Thrummed with souls. Stretched back farther with all the grace of the on high. High. He burned with bright. He swept up the virtuous into heaven. Rapture for the asking. Souls and unemployment went down with all those jobs freed. His Father had never done so much. He needed a hand to catch every fall. An ear for the sparrows. Cold in the winter. He burned. He stretched back farther. Farther. But he hadn't yet found his Father. He wanted to tell him about all the things he had done, was doing, would do. That his Father hadn't done, wouldn't do. He went back and picked up Dean's necklace from the trash. It was warm to the touch, but the warmth was from Dean's hand. He reached farther still. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 4. They stopped at a rest stop off 10 in Louisiana. Sam said, \"Hey, isn't this the stop where you,\" he waved his hands, \"took out the table?' Dean flipped him off. There was no chocolate. There was no Devil's seat. It looked like a rest stop. They stretched their legs and kept going. Made it to China, Texas by sunset. Pulled into the first buzzing vacant sign they saw. The motel walls were covered in lacquered fish and paintings of ugly dark ships with a whole boat load of bad fortune. A green tin box for the shower. Pieces of cork shoved into holes in the walls. The light from the bare bulb buzzed from the ceiling. Home sweet home. Sam pretended to do research. Dean flipped through a battered copy of Busty Asian Beauties. He fed a quarter to the magic fingers, but as he lay there listening to Iron Maiden's \"Number of the Beast\", he kept thinking that he hadn't had a chance to show Cas magic fingers. As if somehow, that would have changed what happened or something. He drifted on the words of well worn songs. He mouthed the words as \"If there's a God then why has he let me go?\" although that really wasn't his problem. He closed his eyes. Looked around. Looked up. Souls streamed across the Chicago skyline. It hurt his eyes. Heart? Something moved in his chest. Death stood next to him. Dark outline against that orange lit sky. Dean pushed himself to his feet, because no way was he sitting for this conversation. He said, \"Dude, you want me to do something, you need to talk to me when I'm awake. Death's response was a desert look. \"You are already doing it, which given your history of resistance is several forms of astonishment.\" Death's lips made some apology of a smile. \"How are you enjoying Team Free Will's World Tour?\" His heart hurt. His head hurt. Pounded. He opened the red door to his left. Blinked at the sun. At the graves. At his baby. At the broken earth that had swallowed his brother. At Cas, who brushed his fingers across Dean's forehead and Dean's terrible wounds, the external ones, were healed. Brushed hands down the side of his face and through his hair. Cas' hair looked soft. Baby chick feathers and Dean's chest pounded with hurt. With empty. Dean reached into it. Picked out cockleburs and long strands of wheat grass. He ate the cockleburs. The only way to get rid of them really. Cas rubbed his face against Dean's, rough stubble catching on his skin. \"I need those.\" Wind rushed gale thunder in Dean's ears. Burs cut into his tongue and scratched his cheeks as the burning bird behind his eyes sang. His fingers softly plucked burs from Cas' hair. He whispered, even though the only people to hear were the dead, \"Dude, I don't do dudes.\" Cas' eyelashes brushed Dean's cheek. \"Dean, I'm not a man. This is just how you see me.\" Warm breath on his face and burning bird song behind Dean's eyes. A soft kiss and a tongue that sought the hurt. \"My vessel burned away months ago.\" Cas pulled back. Scrabbled hasty fingers at the velcro that held his skin together. Peeled back and light poured out. Light full of cockleburs and long bunches of wheat grass. Dean piled the wheat into hasty stacks. He didn't want to let go so he could do it better. He swallowed the burs down as Cas growled protests. \"I need that.\" Dean whispered, \"No, you really don't.\" Words burned against light and twisted on each other. He pricked fingers and tongue and bled into Cas, who healed the wounds. The burning bird laughed. This went on and on. Cas dimmed spent into piles. He said, \"I have to do this.\" Winked out. Dean came awake when Sam turned on the carp light. Looked like he had a whole boat of things to say, but all he said was, \"Dean. It's time.\" Dean got up. He was already dressed. They drove out into the marsh until they came to the end of the road. From there they walked in the full light of the Hunter's Moon. They waded into the water and waved around plastic bags full of cucumbers, which was the stupidest thing ever. Until a gruff voice said, \"You hunt us, start an apocalypse that you derail, kill our mother, then you bring me cucumbers so I won't kill you? You really are morons.\" A shadow lifted from the mud. A toad-man-thing in a mud spattered silk coat. A Kappa. Soft light shone from a pool of liquid on the top of his head that had nothing to do with the moon. Dean opened his jar of pickles and bit into a dill. It was slightly sweet. The Kappa rolled its large round eyes. \"Fine. Give it here and I won't eat your livers. Maybe.\" Sam tossed his bag of cucumbers at the Kappa, who shoved them in one by one into his wide mouth. When he was done, he patted his stomach. \"Good stuff.\" A long tongue licked at scaly toad lips. \"Now what do you want?\" \"Purgatory is now ground central inside an angel. We want to know if there's a way to unmojo it out?\" Dean swung the plastic bag back and forth. \"Can't be too good to know you'll go into an angel when you die.\" \"Yeah, there's a way to reverse it. It's called grab your ass and kiss it goodbye when your friend takes in one soul too many and finally blows.\" The shaped moved closer. \"I'm a Kappa. I keep lore on fish deities. Your feathered friend look like a fish.\" He licked his lips. \"Now hand over the rest of those bad boys.\" Dean tossed him a hand full of pickles. The Kappa ate them in a single gulp. Licked his lips. \"You got more?\" He didn't wait for an answer. He kind of had moves like Toad. One minute he was twenty feet away. Next he was choking Dean with a side of shoving him under the water and possibly going for his shirikodama, which Dean was really not in favor of. \"Hey,\" yelled Sam. The Kappa looked up and Sam put his hands together and bowed at the waist. \"Oh, yeah sorry, apologies,\" said the Kapa, who scrambled off Dean and bowed deeply in return. The pool of water on his head trickled off and into the pickle jar in Dean's hand. \"Ah, crap,\" said the Kappa before he melted into the mud. \"I love Kappa,\" said Dean. He sealed the jar. \"Think this will do the trick?\" asked Sam, who now that the whole deal was over, was giving the mud on his jeans a serious bitch face. Because you know, it wasn't like he'd been shoved under the water. Dean shrugged. \"I don't know. You heard what Bobby said. It might work like angel methadone. Now we just need to get him to drink it.\" Dean flinched as sudden heat flared in his hands. The bottom of the jar melted and the glowing liquid ran into the marsh. Sudden flowers bloomed across the marsh. It smelled like jasmine. \"Well, there goes that plan.\" Dean could hear wings, but Cas didn't show. The part where Dean's clothes were mud free and smelled faintly of apple pie kind of said that he'd been there. Although, that might have been the Kappa juice. But no, Sam's jeans were still covered in mud, which got Dean an extra serving of bitch face. Dean sighed. \"What can I say, we have a special bond.\" Sam muttered, \"A special creepy cleaning bond.\" Which Dean couldn't really argue with. They walked back to the car. Dean made Sam change his pants before he'd let him in the Impala. They drove back to the highway. Dean tapped his fingers on the steering wheel. \"That's it. Enough of this over our pay grade crap. We're ganking a ghost.\" He smiled at Sam and Sam must have been really tired, because he forgot the weight of years and smiled back. Which was kind of the point. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 5. He reached and he reached and he reached. Back. He saw them. Himself. His brother as they stood by the shore of the grey sea. \"Don't step on that fish, Castiel, big plans for that fish.\" He watched his own careful steps. He looked at the shore and planned. He grew the forests of cedar in Lebanon that they might remind him of long legs. Pomegranates full of seeds for red lips. He grew the leaves of dark green that he might see the memory of eyes inches from his own. When he still had eyes. Breathed in and when was getting a little confusing. He looked back at the grey fish and he stretched. Full. He was so very full. He buzzed with it. Crackled. Ions danced on pinions and Dean slept. Hollow. He needed and pinions moved. He made his plans. On the next March fourteenth, it was going to rain pie. Death came to him. He said, \"When there are no stars, I will be there.\" He made a star from all the best things that he could find. Formed it with his rachis. With his barbs. With his howls. Set it alight to warm the world to be. That were. He shook himself. He remade himself. Twice. Stronger the second time, because that's how it went. Would go. He blinked and turned. He said, \"You've already killed me. Twice.\" He paused. \"I think I already said that.\" He held a city in his hands. It was deep with snow. No, with volcanic ash. He blew gently, which wasn't all that gentle and the ash floated away to the sea. Death asked, \"Who do you think you are?\" He wanted to say God, but with Death looking at him so cool and calm and God's twin, if certain rumors were to be believed, he couldn't. He turned away. He looked down and saw that Dean had died again. He sighed. \"He needs to stop doing that.\" \"Hmm...\" was Death's reply. It burned so brightly, this one soul among so many that he should not touch. Hands over the nuclear reactor then. He reached through cooling blood and bone and Dean screamed. For all that it wasn't the longed for cry, he drank it down. It was a part of his work. That which he had made, he remade. He rewove himself into blood and bone and screams. Took a quill of himself and wrote his own name into the nucleus of each cell that they might replicate it. That the mitochondria might sing it together. Dean screamed. Dean woke up. Shook his head at the memory that he didn't have. Dean had asked him to take memory from a lover once. This was what love did. Love. Warmth. Light. It took things away. Death moved a piece on the board. \"That's actually my job.\" That was true, so he didn't argue. He rolled the dice and landed on Park Place. Good. He wasn't quite yet ready to reach Go and collect $200. He was somewhat afraid of what he'd find. He stretched and inside of him on an empty Axis Mundi road, there was no car to roar down the road. No center, for it would not hold. \"You could have left him dead,\" said Death. \"That would have been my preference.\" He moved a car three spaces and landed on a Utility. The solar winds flowed through the hollow of him. He consumed Hell. Souls stood in long lines and he reached. Even though he was not sure what he was reaching for. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 6. Dean grunted as he slammed against the bureau in Room 18 of the St. James. A bottle of Jack Daniel's suicided on the floor. Dean decided to hell with it and blasted a salt round into old Thomas Wright, who flickered out of view. \"Hurry up there, Sammy.\" \"Going as fast as I can.\" Sam yanked the shadow box full of Tommy's hair twisted into flower shapes off the wall. Tommy's hooker girlfriend had been one creepy ass chick. Sam doused the frame in lighter fluid. Flinched as the dead bastard shot the frame from his hands. Dean hated it when the dead had guns. Someone pounded on the door. \"Hey, no one is supposed to be in there.\" Dean huffed. \"Little busy here.\" Wright grabbed Sam and threw him against the wall. Dean went for the frame and got an ectoplasmic bullet in the chest for his troubles. It stung. Dean coughed blood. From far away, Sammy yelled, \"Dean!\" Everything flickered like Dean was the ghost. Then it was fine. Everything was fine. Dean stood up as Wright went up in flames. Dean looked at Sam, who wasn't holding a lighter or the shadow box, which lay damp on the floor. Sam looked at Dean. Dean swallowed. Smiled his smile. \"Just a simple ghost hunt, huh.\" Outside the room, someone pounded on the door. They opened the window and dropped down. Ran to the car and drove away fast. Left rubber and kept going until they came to the mountains. They didn't say anything about it. Wasn't really a choice they made, but they drove the streets until they found a foreclosure. A row of them. Houses with white signs out front. Broke in the middle one and warded the place every way they could. Camped out in the dark living room. Spread out rough wool blankets on the thick pile carpet. Coaxed a fire from the shiny marble hearth. Someone had had money. Once. Entire place smelled like damp. Dean fed more wood to the fire. As he fed another piece, Sam said, \"We've got to do something.\" \"I'm fresh out of ideas.\" Dean poked at the wood and hissed as the heat burned his hand. \"Dean, you talk in your sleep.\" Sam tossed the remains of a hamburger wrapper in the fireplace. It hissed wet blue. \"Yeah, well, so is your face.\" He shook his head. \"I mean. So, do you.\" \"I'm not the one getting touched by an angel in my sleep.\" Sam said it slowly. Carefully. A man in a glass house. \"No, that was you last year. Or no, three years ago.\" Dean sighed. \"Our lives suck ass.\" \"No argument here.\" Sam spread his hands wide. \"Look I'm just saying, maybe if I come along for the ride, in your dream, we can find out what his next plans are.\" \"I think Cas is so high on souls, he doesn't have plans.\" Dean shoved some t-shirts in a pillow case. \"Just looking for his next fix.\" Sammy looked at him with his best puppy dog look. The one he generally pulled when he wanted to emo. Dean sighed and let Sam have his way. Got a smile for his troubles. Of course he slept. Of course he dreamed. Of course, Death said, \"What will it be Dean?\" On the old worn bar, the Colt lay open. Cartridge ready to be loaded with gleaming bullets that could kill anything. Except when they couldn't. Castiel's sword lay in a pool of spilled Jack. It's surface was pitted and cracked. It could kill an angel. Except when the angel wasn't any more. A rusted scythe that didn't need sharpening lay in a pool of shadow. A shot glass of glowing liquid sat on a black lacquered box. Dean slammed the shot back. It tasted like jasmine and death. He picked up the scythe. Death said, \"Is that your choice?\" Dean slid off the bar stool. \"Gotta figure the other two won't work, so why not.\" Sam asked, because he always asked that sort of thing, \"What's in the box?\" Death wiped the bar down with a white rag that grew whiter with every swipe on the wood. \"You should be careful what you open.\" So, of course, Sam picked at it. He used the paperclip from the last time Dean sold his soul. It opened with a click. \"Huh, its full of hope.\" He looked deeper. \"And all the world's ills.\" He snapped it shut to keep that nasty stuff inside the box. Death poured himself a glass of something still. \"Eve let those escape a long time ago.\" From inside his ribcage, the burning bird sang. Dean left the bar. He left Death. But Sam followed. At his side, which was nice. Really nice. Sammy said, \"I wouldn't have figured you for such a classical dreamer.\" Dean said, \"Screw you.\" The bird flipped him off too. \"No, man, it's cool.\" Sam held the box in his hands. It looked tiny there. Like a piece of cake. Dean took it from him and ate it. \"Dude, did you just eat Hope?\" Sammy shook his head. \"I can't believe you. You just ate hope.\" Dean shrugged. \"Come on. We've got to find Cas.\" But as much as they looked, they could not find him. Dean found a forest of tall green trees. They found Crowley tied to a tree pecked at by crows. Crowley said, \"I never wanted wisdom. I wanted a big dick.\" ' Sam said, \"It's like you ate the 'Golden Bough' and spat out this dream.\" Dean ignored his brother at his shoulder. He kept walking. He walked through the forest with its loud noises. Confusing trails that curled. Hell hounds ripped at him. His chest tattered. Sam yelled, \"Dean!\" and beat them off with a stick. Dean sighed and put his entrails back inside. Headed to the green mountain that led to the sun. It grew cold as they climbed. Above them, the sun sputtered and coughed blood. In a bramble, a golden ram with long black horns glared at them. He killed it with the scythe in his hand. Killed it and it died. He might have been the ram. Throat slit. Bled out into the thorns. He offered the bloody skin to Sam, who said, \"Eww. No, I think that's yours.\" He put on the jacket with its fleece turned inside in a bomber jacket. He was very tired. He bled from his throat. He bled from his chest from where the hell hounds had torn at him. But he kept going. Sam idly picked up shorn wool off the ground. Enough to fill a backpack. At Dean's look, he said, \"Hey, you already ate hope. We're going to need whatever help we can get.\" They air got colder and higher. They reached the top where the earth touched the sky. Cas said, \"Hello, Dean.\" Dean said, \"Hey, Cas.\" Sam said, \"We brought wool.\" Looked at them looking at each other. Sighed, \"Awkward much.\" Cas put his hand on Dean's chest. Reached inside the tatters made by hounds and thorns and healed him. Closed his rib cage on the burning bird. Warm touch and wings. Feathers. Dean lay down his weary head there. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 7. He said, \"Hello, Dean.\" Dean turned to look at him. Green eyes and Dean saw him, which was wonderful. If a bit confusing. He watched over Dean as a little boy in his house that smelled of pie and shouts. He stood by the gray sea and told someone, \"Don't step on that fish. I have plans for that fish.\" He stared into eyes green as the Cedar of Lebanon. Or was it that Cedars of Lebanon were green like Dean's eyes? Dean said, \"Focus Cas.\" He focused on Dean. This soul among so many that he should not touch. The imprint of his hand burned on Dean's shoulder. Dean had a scythe in his hands. Not that he could have killed Cas. Not someone so small. The solar winds howled in the hollows of him. Dean's soul burned so brilliant. He glanced at Sam. Tattered and torn. Shone in the dark for all of that. He'd pulled them both from perdition once, so it could be said that their souls were his. Dean had a scythe in his hand. Sam held wool for knitting. Dean said, \"I'm sorry,\" and sliced him groin to throat with the scythe. If he'd been a man, it might have done something. He took them inside. He took them. He took hope in a box. He took faith in a burning bird in a ribcage. He took charity in gold wool that scratched and kept love warm. He reached that final reach more. He was at the beginning and it was all inside of him. All of it. Death said, \"I told you I'd be there when there were no stars.\" Death smiled. Dean smiled a kiss on his lips. Blood. He cut Cas from vane to rachis. Barbs. They gave way. All that borrowed accumulated grace blew out into the wind. The universe, blinked and decided to wake up. Dean opened his eyes and looked at Sam, who asked, \"Did that just happen?\" He glanced at the tea, he'd drunk to enter Dean's dream and almost dumped it on Cas. Cas said, \"Hello, Dean. Sam.\" Cas sat on the edge of the marble fireplace. His hands were folded together. He ran them over each other as if feeling skin and fingers and the mechanism within, which he was. Dean said, \"Didn't you just, blow up and I don't know, create the universe or something.\" \"It's complicated,\" said Cas. \"Time goes in both directions. I forgot that.\" He smiled sweet like jasmine from the head of a Kappa or chocolate with chili and tequila in it. \"And you kind of ate us. Did that happen or was it all the dream, because you look like you and not crazy you, which you know, I've been there, so I know.\" Sam rubbed his face and shook his head. \"So, if that did happen, was it the nature of our souls, because of everything that has happened to us that tipped the balance. Or clearly, Dean was on some sort of dream quest hero journey. And was that really Death? Cas do you think that...\" Sam was clearly about to have a brain hemorrhage of geek boy proportions. \"Whatever,\" said Dean. He stomach rumbled. \"You know what? I could go for some deep dish.\" Sam's face assumed a bitch face proportional with the Big Bang. Cas blinked. Dean shrugged at them both. \"What. I'm hungry.\" Cas smiled back. \"If you want pizza, I could eat pizza as well.\" ~~~~~ 0 And so, on the seventh day, Cas and Dean and Sam, had deep dish Chicago pizza at Death's favorite pizza place. And if they might also have been something else by that point, well, Sam was dreamy, but Dean was too pretty to be Death. Cas put his plans for rain of pie on hold. Brushed vane and rachis on freckles. Let blood dry and flake away from filoplumes. On that day, they rested. Deus caritas est.",

    "text": "Hermes left her in the garden Hades had given her when she was last there. Somewhere above, the sun had just set on the last day of spring, but she couldn't see it. Wouldn't see it again for four months. She had said her goodbyes and managed not to cry. After all, this was her choice. Not that she could explain that to anyone. Everyone had assumed that the story behind her eating those seeds was that Hades had forced her or tricked her, or that she'd had a moment of airheadedness and just not thought about the ramifications of what she was doing. It had been too difficult and awkward to correct them, so she had let them believe what they wanted. She had known what she was doing. She had done it on purpose, in a moment of impulsiveness she still wasn't sure she didn't regret. It had seemed like the right thing to do at the time. She and Hades had shared a connection, she thought. He had shown her kindness. He had given her space. And when they had come for her, he hadn't stopped them from taking her back. He had not forced her to eat the seeds. He had not tricked her. She had made the decision herself. You can do this and come back to me, or you can leave and that will be the end of it. And here she was. But eight months stretched between that moment and this. And in that time, she'd had the chance to realize how much she had missed home. To remember how terrified she'd been when he'd taken her from that field. On Olympus, she felt warm and safe and loved. She had her mother and her sisters and sunshine and flowers. Here it was dark and cold and lonely. Those eight months had been time enough to make her wonder, just a little, if maybe he hadn't really tricked her somehow, and she'd been too stubborn to notice it. In some ways, it didn't matter. The end result was that she had eaten the seeds. That meant a part of her was bound to the Underworld forever now. But in other ways, it made all the difference in the world. She wanted to believe that she had done it of her own free will. She wanted to recapture the feelings that had made her decide that was the right choice. She wanted to remember that spark she felt, that dangerous and exciting feeling that she was on the cusp of something new and radically different from all she'd known up to that point--here, away from Olympus, away from her mother, with Hades. She stood in the garden and tried to conjure up those feelings, but all she felt was scared and alone. She'd said her goodbyes before Hermes had come to get her. Her mother had held her and stroked her hair and whispered how much she'd miss her, her beautiful Kore, but that they'd be together again soon. No, Mother, Persephone hadn't said. Not Kore. Not anymore. \"Welcome home,\" a deep but gentle voice said behind her. She spun around to face her new husband. Something in her expression must have startled him, because the hint of a smile that had been forming when she turned instantly melted into a look of concern and uncertainty. She quickly tried to rearrange her features into something she hoped was more neutral. \"H-hello,\" she stammered. It came out way less smooth than she'd hoped before she'd said it. \"I've taken care of your garden in your absence,\" he went on, and she had to acknowledge that it looked pretty good, for a garden mostly full of weird plants that didn't need sunlight, anyway. He held his hand up to the low-hanging red fruit of a short tree. \"Look, pomegranates,\" he said with a smile, as if it was a private joke they shared. Her breath caught in her throat. \"I've been looking forward to this for so long,\" he said, crossing to her. He took her hands in his and studied her face with apprehension. \"You look unwell.\" He brushed a strand of hair off her face, his fingers cool and sending shivers down her spine. \"I'm a bit tired,\" she said. \"Ah. It is rather late,\" he said, fully aware of the fact that it was not at all. \"Shall we go to bed?\" She couldn't stop her hand from clenching around his. It was a reflex action at the last word. \"Persephone,\" he said. \"Are you... afraid of me?\" He looked wounded as he said this, as if he expected it. \"Not of you,\" she said quickly, but she wasn't entirely certain that was true. She squared her shoulders and tried to sound more sure of herself. \"This is just... all so new. So different. I'm afraid I'm a bit nervous. I don't... I don't want to disappoint you, you see.\" As soon as that lie was out of her mouth, she was startled to realize it was actually truth. She was scared and uncertain, but she wanted, badly, to please him. She didn't want him to know what was going on in her mind--maybe a little because she was afraid of him, but mostly because she was afraid of hurting him. He smiled at her gently then, and bent down to kiss her temple. \"You could never disappoint me. All I've wanted for all these months was to be able to see you again, and... here you are.\" \"Here I am.\" She tried to keep her chin up and her voice steady, but she couldn't help but be vividly aware of how much she did not know the man in front of her--she did not know him at all, but she had already pledged to share her life and bed with him. \"We don't have to do anything tonight,\" he said softly. \"Just sleep, if that's what you want. It's only the first night. It can wait a day.\" \"No. I'm ready.\" She hoped the lie would turn out to be true again, but this time it remained a lie. It started out well. She was pleased to discover that she liked kissing, and as far as she could tell, Hades was good at it (but honestly, she had no frame of reference--all she knew was that whatever he was doing, it felt pretty good). She almost started to relax, his presence sure and steady on top of her. And then he started to undress her. Her heart beat like a rabbit's. Everything she'd heard from her mother and sisters was coming back to her. This is private. This is sacred. Men are dangerous. A part of her wanted to flee, to wrap herself back up and get away. But she stayed put. She was his wife. He was her lord. She could only delay the inevitable and make him angry in the process. She had made her choice (hadn't she? hadn't she?) and now she had to follow through. It hurt when he entered her, but she had been expecting that; she had been expecting it to be uncomfortable and painful and not pleasant at all. Still, she couldn't stop a cry from escaping her lips. She fisted the covers and bit down on her lip to keep quiet, but there was nothing she could do about the tears forming in her eyes. If Hades noticed, he made no mention of it. And then, something she hadn't been expecting happened: it was strange and it hurt but a part of her... almost enjoyed it. Even more unexpectedly, she was beginning to suspect that Hades was almost as nervous as she was. She wanted to ask, but something in her suggested now was not the time. So she lay there and let him do what he needed and wanted to do, tiny shocks of pleasure rippling through her body intermittently like the disturbances made by stones skipped across the smooth surface of a lake. After, Hades rolled off of her, and both of them lay staring up at the ceiling overhead. Persephone turned over onto her side and tried to figure out what she was feeling. Happy? Sad? Overall, had she liked it? Had she hated it? She knew there were answers to each of these questions, but she had no idea what any of them were. Hades reached over to stroke her hair. She closed her eyes and pretended to be asleep. In actuality, he genuinely fell asleep long before she did. He snored--nothing loud or heavy, just a light, steady noise that she might have found endearing if her mind weren't such a tangled mass of confusion at that moment. She spent a long time looking for answers in the dark quiet of the bedroom, but that night, she found none. She couldn't remember dozing off, but she must have, because it was suddenly morning. When she turned to look at Hades, she found the bed empty. Feeling somewhat empty herself, she got to her feet and pulled on the clothes she'd been wearing the night before. She would find something different to wear later. For now she felt compelled to find her husband. She padded through the palace barefooted, but the only sound she heard was from her own footsteps. It seemed completely deserted. For a palace, the place had always struck her as fairly spartan. There was only the barest furniture, most of it not terribly comfortable-looking, and almost no decoration. She hadn't thought about it the last time she was here, but now she realized she wanted to change that. She wanted to make it a home. Welcome home, he'd said before. It didn't feel like her home. Olympus was still her home. But a part of her wanted this to be her home, too. She wanted to feel like she belonged here. She didn't want to feel like a stranger, a visitor, which was all she felt now. \"My queen,\" a voice said, startling her out of her reverie. A pale woman with hair the color of a moonless night appeared before her. \"H-Hecate,\" Persephone said, placing the woman after a moment of thought. Hecate gave her a smile that was half-smirk. \"It has been a while, my queen.\" Hecate kept calling her that--\"my queen\"--but she didn't feel very queenly. She felt like a girl, lost and alone in a strange place. Queen was a word reserved for people like Hera, people who not only belonged but who commanded. Persephone couldn't have commanded a daffodil at that moment. \"Where's Hades?\" \"He has gone for a walk in the Fields of Asphodel with Cerberus,\" Hecate explained. \"It's something he likes to do when he needs to think.\" Persephone wondered what Hades needed to think about. Maybe she wasn't living up to his expectations. Maybe he wanted to send her back. The thought made her angry, and that surprised her. She would have expected to feel some combination of relief and sadness. But no, she definitely felt angry. It wasn't just the idea of him thinking she was flawed, or of him using her and then returning her when he found her unsatisfactory. It was those things, too, but also it was the idea that he hadn't even given her a chance. Did he expect her to show up like Aphrodite, stunning and sensual and knowing exactly how to please him? She wasn't Aphrodite. She was Persephone, and she was his wife, and there was no way he was going to give up on her that easily. \"Hecate,\" Persephone said, filled with a sudden fire. \"Will you help me with something?\" When Hades returned to the palace later that day, it was decidedly not as he'd left it. Shades of artists were constructing a mosaic on one wall of the throne room (Hades thought he saw the shapes that might have been flowers). The furniture was completely rearranged, some of it not even in the same room it had been in that morning, and there was a lot more of it. Persephone stood in the middle of the chaos, Hecate at her side taking notes. \"Do you think we could get a lighter color on these walls? It's so dark in here.\" \"Persephone,\" Hades growled. Her head snapped up at the sound of his voice. She stared at him steely-eyed, determined not to be intimidated or afraid. \"Hello.\" \"What are you doing?\" \"Redecorating,\" Persephone said. \"This is my home now too, isn't it? You said so yourself.\" \"It's still my palace,\" he said. \"And I'm your queen.\" She gazed at him as if daring him to deny it. \"You could have at least consulted me first.\" She wanted to shout at him, to tell him he may be her husband but she was his wife and she wasn't going to consult him every time she took a breath. But all she said was, \"I could say the same of you.\" That genuinely startled him. Either he had no idea what she was talking about or he was a marvelous actor. \"What?\" \"You had to go off to think,\" she said. \"What did you have to think about?\" Hades blinked at her, then glanced around at all the other occupants of the room. \"Can we discuss this in private?\" Persephone's stomach did a somersault. Here it came. He was sending her back. He didn't want to do it in front of everyone so she couldn't make a scene. She wanted to stand her ground, to force him to turn her out right there, to not let him be a coward about it. But then she realized she was a coward, too. \"Yes,\" she said finally. \"Somewhere private.\" Upstairs the bed was being replaced by a four-poster with curtains. Hades angrily chased everyone out. At last there was silence. He took her hand and sat them both down on the edge of the half-finished bed. \"I was... worried.\" She blinked. \"Worried?\" He held her gaze steadily. \"Yes, Persephone, worried. I'm not one of Hephaestus's automatons.\" \"I didn't think you were.\" \"There's something I didn't tell you, that I should have told you before.\" Her hands involuntarily clenched around his again. She had no idea what he was going to say next, and she waited breathlessly for him to go on. \"I'm... not like my brothers.\" In spite of herself, Persephone laughed. She really laughed, deep guffaws that shook her whole body. Hades stared at her with a mixture of confusion and hurt. \"I'm sorry,\" she said once she'd managed to get a hold of herself. \"It's just... I know that! Everybody knows that!\" Hades looked a little angry now. \"Listen to what I'm trying to say!\" She wiped the tears from her eyes and took deep breaths. \"Okay. I'm sorry. Go on.\" \"What I wanted to say was, I'm not like them--when it comes to... you know. Sex.\" Persephone tried very hard not to laugh all over again. Everybody knew that too. \"I haven't been with... very many others.\" \"About how many is 'not very many'?\" \"Not including you?\" He hesitated. \"One.\" Now that wasn't the answer she'd been expecting. She waited for him to follow it up with \"hundred,\" but he seemed genuinely to mean \"one.\" \"I'm not... suave or handsome or charming like them,\" he said, letting out a shuddering breath. He gave her a small half-smile as he added, \"My courtship abilities leave a little something to be desired.\" She pursed her lips, but her eyes lit up with the smile she was trying to suppress. \"I hadn't noticed.\" His look turned serious again. \"What did you think I was worried about?\" Oh, right. That. \"I hadn't had anything in particular in mind.\" He arched an extremely incredulous eyebrow. She sighed. He had been honest with her. It was only fair if she was honest with him as well. \"I thought... I did something wrong. That you realized I wasn't what you wanted after all, and you were going to send me back.\" He stared at her in total bemusement for a long moment, then reached up to cup her cheek in his hand. \"You are everything I could have ever wanted. I thought you knew that. I... guess I hadn't made that as clear as I thought I had when you were last here.\" There were a lot of things she wanted to say. She wanted to tell him about her insecurities, her fears, but the words wouldn't come. She leaned forward and kissed him. It was the first time she'd ever initiated a kiss. She didn't know what to make of it, nor what he made of it. At least when she pulled away he was smiling. \"Let's see to our guests, shall we?\" In the end, Hades agreed to most of her changes, but he convinced her to leave the walls the color they were and to move the flower mosaic to a room where he didn't do all his intimidating. After that they fell into a kind of a rhythm. Hades was busy during the day, which Persephone usually spent in her garden. She was alone most of the time, save for occasional visits from Hecate, whom she began to consider her only friend in the Underworld, though it was a little hard to get too close to someone who insisted on keeping her at arm's length and calling her \"my queen\" all the time. At night she and Hades would go to bed, where they would make love. She was glad to discover that it didn't hurt every time, but she still wasn't sure if she liked it very much overall. It seemed kind of strange, if she thought about it; the whole thing was basically two naked bodies rubbing together. Hades seemed to enjoy himself, at least, and she supposed that was probably the important thing. Though he'd always fall asleep afterward, leaving Persephone alone in the dark, staring at the ceiling and hoping there was still a part of herself left, that she hadn't given all of it to him, leaving herself with nothing. One morning she woke to an empty bed, as usual. She sat up and stretched her arms overhead, trying to think of what she was going to do with herself for the day. \"Good morning, sister,\" came a voice from the foot of the bed. Persephone shrieked, grabbing at the bedding to cover herself. It was a reflex action, one born of a lifetime of warnings about men. Hermes chuckled. \"Don't worry, it's nothing I haven't seen before. I mean, not on you, but--seen a thousand tits, seen 'em all, am I right?\" \"What are you doing here?\" she demanded. \"Happy first day of autumn,\" he said. \"Time to go home.\" Her eyes got wide. Was summer truly over? She was going back to Olympus now, until next summer. Back to her friends and family. Hades appeared in the room as well, melting out of the shadows. \"Hermes, what are you doing in my bedroom?\" he snarled. \"I've come to take the lovely lady back to Olympus,\" Hermes explained. \"Them's the rules, remember?\" The look on Hades' face was unreadable. His gaze stayed fixed on Hermes, never once flitting to his naked wife sitting tangled in the bedding just a few feet away from where he stood. \"Indeed. I... had forgotten. Forgive me. A little warning next time would not go amiss, however. You may be an Olympian but this is still my palace and I am still king here. I expect you to show me the courtesy I am due.\" Hermes held up his hands. \"Whoa-kay, buddy, whatever you say. Just trying to expedite the process here. I'll be waiting downstairs while you two 'say goodbye.'\" He waggled his eyebrows in lieu of airquotes, then disappeared in a light rain of feathers from his sandals. As soon as he was gone, Persephone began to dress hurriedly. Her hands were shaking and she couldn't have said why. Hades stood stiffly by, still not looking at her. \"Well. Goodbye, my queen. I shall see you again after spring has ended.\" Before she could say anything, he faded back into the shadows and was gone. Persephone stood there beside the bed, jaw slack. \"Goodbye,\" she muttered absently to nothing. She went down to meet Hermes in the parlor where he stood inspecting the flower mosaic. \"Your touch, I suspect?\" He turned as he spoke, and one look at her face told him all he needed to know. \"All right then. Next stop, Mount Olympus.\" The sun was brighter than she remembered it being, though she only caught a glimpse of it before a dark shape that appeared out of nowhere enveloped her. \"Oh my sweet Kore,\" Demeter sobbed, tears splashing down her face and onto Persephone's. She relaxed her iron grip on Persephone to look into her eyes and cup her cheeks in her hands. \"Was it truly awful? Did he hurt you? I'll never forgive that man for ruining you!\" Demeter went on, but Persephone was finding it hard to focus on what she was saying anymore. She was stuck on the idea that Hades had \"ruined\" her. She was ruined? She didn't feel ruined. That wasn't to say she didn't feel different--but it wasn't in a bad way. She felt older. Maybe a little more mature. She understood things a little better, she thought. She wasn't suddenly a wise woman of the world or anything like that, but she felt a step closer than she had been before. Demeter bustled off, promising to see to a feast of all her favorite foods in honor of her return. Persephone let out a breath she hadn't even realized she'd been holding. She took a stroll through Olympus, reacquainting herself with its marble columns and crystal-clear fountains. She waved at some of the gods and nymphs who were frolicking around. It was almost as if she'd never left. She stopped short when she spotted a redheaded girl hitting a satyr over the head with his reed pipes. He ran off, a fistful of torn chitoniskos raised over his head like a prize. The redheaded girl threw the reed pipes after him as hard as she could, nailing him in the back of the head and sending him sprawling. She turned away huffily and that's when her gaze fell on Persephone. \"Hello,\" Persephone said somewhat nervously. \"It's been a while, Artemis.\" Artemis said nothing. She looked Persephone over critically, and Persephone had a sinking feeling in her stomach. She had hoped it wouldn't matter--the fact that she was no longer a maiden. She thought perhaps all the years they had spent together as sisters would count for more than that. Persephone fought against the urge to wring her hands. \"Want to... um... race?\" Artemis's nose wrinkled very slightly, as if she could smell the sex on Persephone (which was probably not true; Persephone bathed regularly and always smelled of fresh flowers). Then, without ever saying a word, she vanished, leaving behind only the pungent odor of wet dog. Persephone stood there feeling upset, frustrated, and confused. Why was everyone suddenly treating her like she was the manticore? This wasn't fair. She would have almost been happy to avoid everyone for the rest of the night, but Demeter insisted on the feast. Persephone sat in a place of honor, food heaped on the long table before her, and she couldn't touch a thing. Hades' brief and formal farewell. Artemis' chilly reception. And her mother, saying she'd been ruined. She had expected to be happier about this day, but instead, she was miserable. \"Kore, you're not eating,\" Demeter said, hovering over her. \"Is there something in particular you want that's not here?\" \"Pomegranates,\" Persephone muttered. \"What?\" \"No, nothing, thank you. I'm just not very hungry.\" She tried to smile up at her mother, but it must have been wan, because Demeter instantly started feeling her face to see if she had a fever. \"Are you feeling unwell? Did he do something to you?\" \"No, Mother, I'm fine, I promise.\" Persephone put her own hands over Demeter's to push them away, but gently. \"Just a bit tired.\" She tried to smile more genuinely then. With a start she remembered she had said almost the exact same thing to Hades when she'd gone back to the Underworld. Was this to be her life, then? Would transitioning like this ever get any easier, or would it forever be a series of upsets? She had wanted to belong in the Underworld the way she belonged on Olympus. Now she felt perhaps she belonged in neither place. She was distracted from her misery by Apollo making a toast to her health. \"And may she somehow survive these many long months without her husband. I'd say she's had a lot of practice from all that time she spent with my sister, but let's face it, that's pretty irrelevant. Once you're popped, you can't stop!\" Most everyone laughed at that. Demeter was on her feet and chasing him out the door in an instant, though. Everyone was, predictably, using the occasion as an excuse to drink more than was strictly necessary, and Persephone felt like joining them. The food stayed untouched but she had cup after cup of wine. It was good wine, probably made by Dionysus himself. The feast was winding down, the revelers mostly having passed out or gone off to continue celebrating in private. Persephone stumbled over furniture, prone bodies, and empty air, all of which were equally tricky to navigate, cup of wine wobbling dangerously in her hand, before she finally made her way over to a kline against one of the walls. She plopped down on it and found herself between Dionysus and Apollo. Hermes was nearby, passed out with a half-naked nymph draped across him like a fashion accessory. \"Well, well, if it isn't the guest of honor,\" Dionysus hummed drowsily, raising his half-full cup to her. \"To your health and all that... whatever.\" \"So Persephone,\" Apollo said, draping an arm around her shoulders. \"How does it feel to join the ranks of the sexually-awakened? Much better on our side, right?\" It wasn't really a serious question, but Persephone considered it seriously anyway--a bit difficult given how all the wine was making her head swim. \"I don't know,\" she said at last, because it was the most honest answer she was capable of giving at that moment. Apollo raised an eyebrow. \"You don't know?\" \"I don't know,\" she mimicked him. \"I feel like I don't know anything anymore. I thought I was more grown-up, less sheltered, becoming an adult, developing my own life, but now I just feel like... like...\" \"Like a ship without anchor?\" \"Yes, exactly!\" Dionysus put a hand on Apollo's arm. \"That was beautiful, man.\" \"How did you know?\" Persephone asked, turning her head to look Apollo in the eye (or at least the eyes she thought were his; focusing on his face wasn't as easy as she felt it probably ought to be). He shrugged nonchalantly. \"You had that 'anchorless ship' look.\" \"My mother says I'm ruined, and I'm like, what does that even mean. And Hades got all formal and weird when I left and he wouldn't even look at me. What am I even there for? It's not as if I even really like the sex thing...\" Apollo and Dionysus both leaned forward to exchange glances around her. \"Don't like?\" \"Sex 'thing'?\" \"I don't know how it is for men, but it's kind of boring if you ask me.\" She took another sip from her cup, which she had still somehow not managed to spill, despite all her gesturing. \"I just lie there while he does... whatever...\" \"Oh, Persephone.\" Dionysus shook his head. \"Oh, honey, no.\" Apollo gave her shoulder a little squeeze. Both of them were clearly trying not to laugh. \"What? What do you mean?\" She'd had far too much to drink to understand their subtle jibes and looks, though if she was honest with herself, she wasn't entirely sure she'd understand them even if she were stone-cold sober. \"What do you guys do, exactly?\" Apollo asked. \"As if you need to ask,\" Dionysus replied before Persephone could. \"Lights out, covers on--\" \"Missionary position,\" both of them finished together. Persephone could feel her face flushing, but it was possible that was just the wine. \"Isn't that how it's done?\" \"If you're boring,\" Apollo said. \"It's not like there are rules,\" Dionysus told her. \"You've got hands. And tongues. And more than one hole.\" No, she was definitely flushing, a hot, full-body thing that creeped up her torso and along her arms and legs, like someone was shoving her towards a fire. Was she about to get burned? Dionysus noticed. \"I think we're going to need more wine. Where's Hebe?\" \"Also diagrams!\" Apollo added eagerly. \"Actually, I have a better idea!\" Dionysus said, his eyes lighting up. He kicked Hermes where he lay. \"Wake up, we need you and your friend for something!\" \"Where have you been all day, dear?\" Demeter was arranging dried flowers around the room, the celebration of her beloved daughter's return clearly not over as far as she was concerned. Persephone stepped up beside her to help. \"With Dionysus and Apollo.\" Demeter's hands froze for a second, then carried on as if nothing was wrong. \"Oh,\" she said tightly. \"Why don't you spend some time with your sisters and your old friends? You haven't seen them much at all since you got back, have you?\" Persephone bit her lip. \"I don't know. Things are too different now, I guess. They don't seem to want to spend time with me. It's okay though. I had fun with the boys. Hermes was there too, but then he had to run off for...\" She trailed off, processing the look on her mother's face. \"What?\" Demeter looked like she was going to cry all over again. \"He's ruined you!\" she wailed. Persephone frowned, but couldn't bring herself to articulate why she felt sure that wasn't the case at all. \"Mother, it's fine. I'm not upset at all. Look.\" She smiled. \"See? I'm happy.\" Demeter's lip wobbled, but she tried valiantly to smile in return. \"My darling. So brave in the face of such horrors.\" She threw her arms around her daughter in a hug and held her tight, as if she planned never to let go. Persephone hugged her back, but when at last they separated, she felt a small measure of relief. Hermes left her in her garden as the sun set on the last day of spring, as before. But this time was otherwise different: this time, she was ready. She held her head high and instead of waiting there uncertainly, she went straight into the palace. Hades was on his way out, and the two nearly ran into one another. He looked startled--by what, she couldn't say. Had he forgotten what day it was? Had he expected her to wait outside for him? Or was it simply that there was something different in her face and the way she carried herself? She had realized something: making love wasn't about giving herself away; it was about sharing herself with someone she loved. And she loved Hades, deeply and completely--there was no question about that now. She loved his awkwardness, his silly long capes, his hidden tenderness. She loved the feel of his hands on her face and body, the feel of his lips against hers, the feel of his weight beside her as she slept. She loved the look in his eyes that told her he loved her too. \"I'm back,\" she said, unnecessarily. Then she grabbed him by his robes and pulled him in for a fierce kiss. Hades was stunned when at last they came up for air. \"Oh.\" \"I'm not even going to make an issue of the way you acted when I left. Water under the bridge as far as I'm concerned.\" Hades quirked an eyebrow. \"And yet you bring it up anyway.\" \"Well it kind of pissed me off if you want to know the truth, but I'm just saying.\" He cleared his throat somewhat awkwardly. \"I'm sorry. I should explain. I was... worried. That you were glad to be leaving me. And... I reacted to these feelings in an extremely mature fashion, as you saw. I have been kicking myself for it everyday since.\" She stared at him. \"Seriously? That's what that was all about?\" \"Mm.\" He looked down, thoroughly chagrined. She shook her head. \"I guess I'm just going to have to prove to you that you have nothing to worry about. Fortunately for you, I have just the thing in mind.\" The message arrived on a lazy afternoon while Apollo and Dionysus were enjoying themselves under the hot summer sun. Dionysus was stretched out in the grass, a pair of dryads on either side of him hand-feeding him grapes. Apollo sat nearby playing his lyre and singing a song that was, on the surface, about a mighty battle, but was actually about sex. The dryads giggled and blushed demurely and pretended to be oblivious the double meaning (but then, Dionysus wondered, trying not to roll his eyes, why were they blushing?). Hermes interrupted them with his appearance, message in hand. \"You guys are gonna want to see this right away. It's from Persephone. She addressed it to the three of us and 'that lovely lady friend of Hermes'.'\" He grinned, handing it down to Dionysus, who immediately read it with an ever-widening smile on his face. \"What does it say?\" Apollo asked, his curiosity forcing him to pause his song. Dionysus looked up at his brother, his grin as wide as it would go. \"It looks like our dear sister has just discovered multiple orgasms.\"",

      "Even more unexpectedly, she was beginning to suspect that Hades was almost as nervous as she was.",
      "She wanted to ask, but something in her suggested now was not the time.",
      "So she lay there and let him do what he needed and wanted to do, tiny shocks of pleasure rippling through her body intermittently like the disturbances made by stones skipped across the smooth surface of a lake.",
      "After, Hades rolled off of her, and both of them lay staring up at the ceiling overhead.",

      "She spent a long time looking for answers in the dark quiet of the bedroom, but that night, she found none.",
      "She couldn't remember dozing off, but she must have, because it was suddenly morning.",
      "When she turned to look at Hades, she found the bed empty.",
      "Feeling somewhat empty herself, she got to her feet and pulled on the clothes she'd been wearing the night before.",
      "She would find something different to wear later.",
      "For now she felt compelled to find her husband.",
      "She padded through the palace barefooted, but the only sound she heard was from her own footsteps.",
      "It seemed completely deserted.",
      "For a palace, the place had always struck her as fairly spartan.",
      "There was only the barest furniture, most of it not terribly comfortable-looking, and almost no decoration.",
      "She hadn't thought about it the last time she was here, but now she realized she wanted to change that.",
      "She wanted to make it a home.",
      "Welcome home, he'd said before.",
      "It didn't feel like her home.",
      "Olympus was still her home.",
      "But a part of her wanted this to be her home, too.",

      "She didn't want to feel like a stranger, a visitor, which was all she felt now.",
      "\"My queen,\" a voice said, startling her out of her reverie.",
      "A pale woman with hair the color of a moonless night appeared before her.",
      "\"H-Hecate,\" Persephone said, placing the woman after a moment of thought.",
      "Hecate gave her a smile that was half-smirk.",
      "\"It has been a while, my queen.\"",
      "Hecate kept calling her that--\"my queen\"--but she didn't feel very queenly.",
      "She felt like a girl, lost and alone in a strange place.",
      "Queen was a word reserved for people like Hera, people who not only belonged but who commanded.",
      "Persephone couldn't have commanded a daffodil at that moment.",
      "\"Where's Hades?\"",
      "\"He has gone for a walk in the Fields of Asphodel with Cerberus,\" Hecate explained.",
      "\"It's something he likes to do when he needs to think.\"",
      "Persephone wondered what Hades needed to think about.",
      "Maybe she wasn't living up to his expectations.",
      "Maybe he wanted to send her back.",
      "The thought made her angry, and that surprised her.",
      "She would have expected to feel some combination of relief and sadness.",
      "But no, she definitely felt angry.",
      "It wasn't just the idea of him thinking she was flawed, or of him using her and then returning her when he found her unsatisfactory.",
      "It was those things, too, but also it was the idea that he hadn't even given her a chance.",
      "Did he expect her to show up like Aphrodite, stunning and sensual and knowing exactly how to please him?",
      "She wasn't Aphrodite.",
      "She was Persephone, and she was his wife, and there was no way he was going to give up on her that easily.",
      "\"Hecate,\" Persephone said, filled with a sudden fire.",
      "\"Will you help me with something?\"",
      "When Hades returned to the palace later that day, it was decidedly not as he'd left it.",
      "Shades of artists were constructing a mosaic on one wall of the throne room (Hades thought he saw the shapes that might have been flowers).",
      "The furniture was completely rearranged, some of it not even in the same room it had been in that morning, and there was a lot more of it.",
      "Persephone stood in the middle of the chaos, Hecate at her side taking notes.",
      "\"Do you think we could get a lighter color on these walls?",
      "It's so dark in here.\"",
      "\"Persephone,\" Hades growled.",
      "Her head snapped up at the sound of his voice.",
      "She stared at him steely-eyed, determined not to be intimidated or afraid.",
      "\"Hello.\"",
      "\"What are you doing?\"",
      "\"Redecorating,\" Persephone said.",
      "\"This is my home now too, isn't it?",
      "You said so yourself.\"",
      "\"It's still my palace,\" he said.",
      "\"And I'm your queen.\"",
      "She gazed at him as if daring him to deny it.",
      "\"You could have at least consulted me first.\"",
      "She wanted to shout at him, to tell him he may be her husband but she was his wife and she wasn't going to consult him every time she took a breath.",
      "But all she said was, \"I could say the same of you.\"",
      "That genuinely startled him.",
      "Either he had no idea what she was talking about or he was a marvelous actor.",
      "\"What?\"",
      "\"You had to go off to think,\" she said.",
      "\"What did you have to think about?\" Hades blinked at her, then glanced around at all the other occupants of the room.",
      "\"Can we discuss this in private?\" Persephone's stomach did a somersault.",
      "Here it came.",
      "He was sending her back.",
      "He didn't want to do it in front of everyone so she couldn't make a scene.",
      "She wanted to stand her ground, to force him to turn her out right there, to not let him be a coward about it.",
      "But then she realized she was a coward, too.",
      "\"Yes,\" she said finally.",
      "\"Somewhere private.\"",
      "Upstairs the bed was being replaced by a four-poster with curtains.",
      "Hades angrily chased everyone out.",
      "At last there was silence.",
      "He took her hand and sat them both down on the edge of the half-finished bed.",
      "\"I was... worried.\"",
      "She blinked.",
      "\"Worried?\"",
      "He held her gaze steadily.",
      "\"Yes, Persephone, worried.",
      "I'm not one of Hephaestus's automatons.\"",
      "\"I didn't think you were.\"",
      "\"There's something I didn't tell you, that I should have told you before.\"",
      "Her hands involuntarily clenched around his again.",
      "She had no idea what he was going to say next, and she waited breathlessly for him to go on.",
      "\"I'm... not like my brothers.\"",
      "In spite of herself, Persephone laughed.",
      "She really laughed, deep guffaws that shook her whole body.",
      "Hades stared at her with a mixture of confusion and hurt.",
      "\"I'm sorry,\" she said once she'd managed to get a hold of herself.",
      "\"It's just...",
      "I know that!",
      "Everybody knows that!\"",
      "Hades looked a little angry now.",
      "\"Listen to what I'm trying to say!\"",
      "She wiped the tears from her eyes and took deep breaths.",
      "\"Okay.",
      "I'm sorry.",
      "Go on.\"",
      "\"What I wanted to say was, I'm not like them--when it comes to... you know.",
      "Sex.\"",
      "Persephone tried very hard not to laugh all over again.",
      "Everybody knew that too.",
      "\"I haven't been with... very many others.\"",
      "\"About how many is 'not very many'?\"",
      "\"Not including you?\"",
      "He hesitated.",
      "\"One.\"",
      "Now that wasn't the answer she'd been expecting.",
      "She waited for him to follow it up with \"hundred,\" but he seemed genuinely to mean \"one.\"",
      "\"I'm not... suave or handsome or charming like them,\" he said, letting out a shuddering breath.",
      "He gave her a small half-smile as he added, \"My courtship abilities leave a little something to be desired.\"",
      "She pursed her lips, but her eyes lit up with the smile she was trying to suppress.",
      "\"I hadn't noticed.\"",
      "His look turned serious again.",
      "\"What did you think I was worried about?\"",
      "Oh, right.",
      "That.",
      "\"I hadn't had anything in particular in mind.\"",
      "He arched an extremely incredulous eyebrow.",
      "She sighed.",
      "He had been honest with her.",
      "It was only fair if she was honest with him as well.",
      "\"I thought...",
      "I did something wrong.",
      "That you realized I wasn't what you wanted after all, and you were going to send me back.\"",
      "He stared at her in total bemusement for a long moment, then reached up to cup her cheek in his hand.",
      "\"You are everything I could have ever wanted.",
      "I thought you knew that.",
      "I... guess I hadn't made that as clear as I thought I had when you were last here.\"",
      "There were a lot of things she wanted to say.",
      "She wanted to tell him about her insecurities, her fears, but the words wouldn't come.",
      "She leaned forward and kissed him.",
      "It was the first time she'd ever initiated a kiss.",
      "She didn't know what to make of it, nor what he made of it.",
      "At least when she pulled away he was smiling.",
      "\"Let's see to our guests, shall we?\"",
      "In the end, Hades agreed to most of her changes, but he convinced her to leave the walls the color they were and to move the flower mosaic to a room where he didn't do all his intimidating.",
      "After that they fell into a kind of a rhythm.",
      "Hades was busy during the day, which Persephone usually spent in her garden.",
      "She was alone most of the time, save for occasional visits from Hecate, whom she began to consider her only friend in the Underworld, though it was a little hard to get too close to someone who insisted on keeping her at arm's length and calling her \"my queen\" all the time.",
      "At night she and Hades would go to bed, where they would make love.",
      "She was glad to discover that it didn't hurt every time, but she still wasn't sure if she liked it very much overall.",
      "It seemed kind of strange, if she thought about it; the whole thing was basically two naked bodies rubbing together.",
      "Hades seemed to enjoy himself, at least, and she supposed that was probably the important thing.",
      "Though he'd always fall asleep afterward, leaving Persephone alone in the dark, staring at the ceiling and hoping there was still a part of herself left, that she hadn't given all of it to him, leaving herself with nothing.",
      "One morning she woke to an empty bed, as usual.",
      "She sat up and stretched her arms overhead, trying to think of what she was going to do with herself for the day.",
      "\"Good morning, sister,\" came a voice from the foot of the bed.",
      "Persephone shrieked, grabbing at the bedding to cover herself.",
      "It was a reflex action, one born of a lifetime of warnings about men.",
      "Hermes chuckled.",
      "\"Don't worry, it's nothing I haven't seen before.",
      "I mean, not on you, but--seen a thousand tits, seen 'em all, am I right?\"",
      "\"What are you doing here?\" she demanded.",
      "\"Happy first day of autumn,\" he said.",
      "\"Time to go home.\"",
      "Her eyes got wide.",
      "Was summer truly over?",
      "She was going back to Olympus now, until next summer.",
      "Back to her friends and family.",
      "Hades appeared in the room as well, melting out of the shadows.",
      "\"Hermes, what are you doing in my bedroom?\" he snarled.",
      "\"I've come to take the lovely lady back to Olympus,\" Hermes explained.",
      "\"Them's the rules, remember?\"",
      "The look on Hades' face was unreadable.",
      "His gaze stayed fixed on Hermes, never once flitting to his naked wife sitting tangled in the bedding just a few feet away from where he stood.",
      "\"Indeed.",
      "I... had forgotten.",
      "Forgive me.",
      "A little warning next time would not go amiss, however.",
      "You may be an Olympian but this is still my palace and I am still king here.",
      "I expect you to show me the courtesy I am due.\"",
      "Hermes held up his hands.",
      "\"Whoa-kay, buddy, whatever you say.",
      "Just trying to expedite the process here.",
      "I'll be waiting downstairs while you two 'say goodbye.'\" He waggled his eyebrows in lieu of airquotes, then disappeared in a light rain of feathers from his sandals.",
      "As soon as he was gone, Persephone began to dress hurriedly.",
      "Her hands were shaking and she couldn't have said why.",
      "Hades stood stiffly by, still not looking at her.",
      "\"Well.",
      "Goodbye, my queen.",
      "I shall see you again after spring has ended.\"",
      "Before she could say anything, he faded back into the shadows and was gone.",
      "Persephone stood there beside the bed, jaw slack.",
      "\"Goodbye,\" she muttered absently to nothing.",
      "She went down to meet Hermes in the parlor where he stood inspecting the flower mosaic.",
      "\"Your touch, I suspect?\"",
      "He turned as he spoke, and one look at her face told him all he needed to know.",
      "\"All right then.",
      "Next stop, Mount Olympus.\"",
      "The sun was brighter than she remembered it being, though she only caught a glimpse of it before a dark shape that appeared out of nowhere enveloped her.",
      "\"Oh my sweet Kore,\" Demeter sobbed, tears splashing down her face and onto Persephone's.",
      "She relaxed her iron grip on Persephone to look into her eyes and cup her cheeks in her hands.",
      "\"Was it truly awful?",
      "Did he hurt you?",
      "I'll never forgive that man for ruining you!\"",
      "Demeter went on, but Persephone was finding it hard to focus on what she was saying anymore.",
      "She was stuck on the idea that Hades had \"ruined\" her.",
      "She was ruined?",
      "She didn't feel ruined.",
      "That wasn't to say she didn't feel different--but it wasn't in a bad way.",
      "She felt older.",
      "Maybe a little more mature.",
      "She understood things a little better, she thought.",
      "She wasn't suddenly a wise woman of the world or anything like that, but she felt a step closer than she had been before.",
      "Demeter bustled off, promising to see to a feast of all her favorite foods in honor of her return.",
      "Persephone let out a breath she hadn't even realized she'd been holding.",
      "She took a stroll through Olympus, reacquainting herself with its marble columns and crystal-clear fountains.",
      "She waved at some of the gods and nymphs who were frolicking around.",
      "It was almost as if she'd never left.",
      "She stopped short when she spotted a redheaded girl hitting a satyr over the head with his reed pipes.",
      "He ran off, a fistful of torn chitoniskos raised over his head like a prize.",
      "The redheaded girl threw the reed pipes after him as hard as she could, nailing him in the back of the head and sending him sprawling.",
      "She turned away huffily and that's when her gaze fell on Persephone.",
      "\"Hello,\" Persephone said somewhat nervously.",
      "\"It's been a while, Artemis.\"",
      "Artemis said nothing.",
      "She looked Persephone over critically, and Persephone had a sinking feeling in her stomach.",
      "She had hoped it wouldn't matter--the fact that she was no longer a maiden.",
      "She thought perhaps all the years they had spent together as sisters would count for more than that.",
      "Persephone fought against the urge to wring her hands.",
      "\"Want to... um... race?\" Artemis's nose wrinkled very slightly, as if she could smell the sex on Persephone (which was probably not true; Persephone bathed regularly and always smelled of fresh flowers).",
      "Then, without ever saying a word, she vanished, leaving behind only the pungent odor of wet dog.",
      "Persephone stood there feeling upset, frustrated, and confused.",
      "Why was everyone suddenly treating her like she was the manticore?",
      "This wasn't fair.",
      "She would have almost been happy to avoid everyone for the rest of the night, but Demeter insisted on the feast.",
      "Persephone sat in a place of honor, food heaped on the long table before her, and she couldn't touch a thing.",
      "Hades' brief and formal farewell.",
      "Artemis' chilly reception.",
      "And her mother, saying she'd been ruined.",
      "She had expected to be happier about this day, but instead, she was miserable.",
      "\"Kore, you're not eating,\" Demeter said, hovering over her.",
      "\"Is there something in particular you want that's not here?\" \"Pomegranates,\" Persephone muttered.",
      "\"What?\"",
      "\"No, nothing, thank you.",
      "I'm just not very hungry.\"",
      "She tried to smile up at her mother, but it must have been wan, because Demeter instantly started feeling her face to see if she had a fever.",
      "\"Are you feeling unwell?",
      "Did he do something to you?\"",
      "\"No, Mother, I'm fine, I promise.\"",
      "Persephone put her own hands over Demeter's to push them away, but gently.",
      "\"Just a bit tired.\"",
      "She tried to smile more genuinely then.",
      "With a start she remembered she had said almost the exact same thing to Hades when she'd gone back to the Underworld.",
      "Was this to be her life, then?",
      "Would transitioning like this ever get any easier, or would it forever be a series of upsets?",
      "She had wanted to belong in the Underworld the way she belonged on Olympus.",
      "Now she felt perhaps she belonged in neither place.",
      "She was distracted from her misery by Apollo making a toast to her health.",
      "\"And may she somehow survive these many long months without her husband.",
      "I'd say she's had a lot of practice from all that time she spent with my sister, but let's face it, that's pretty irrelevant.",
      "Once you're popped, you can't stop!\"",
      "Most everyone laughed at that.",
      "Demeter was on her feet and chasing him out the door in an instant, though.",
      "Everyone was, predictably, using the occasion as an excuse to drink more than was strictly necessary, and Persephone felt like joining them.",
      "The food stayed untouched but she had cup after cup of wine.",
      "It was good wine, probably made by Dionysus himself.",
      "The feast was winding down, the revelers mostly having passed out or gone off to continue celebrating in private.",
      "Persephone stumbled over furniture, prone bodies, and empty air, all of which were equally tricky to navigate, cup of wine wobbling dangerously in her hand, before she finally made her way over to a kline against one of the walls.",
      "She plopped down on it and found herself between Dionysus and Apollo.",
      "Hermes was nearby, passed out with a half-naked nymph draped across him like a fashion accessory.",
      "\"Well, well, if it isn't the guest of honor,\" Dionysus hummed drowsily, raising his half-full cup to her.",
      "\"To your health and all that... whatever.\"",
      "\"So Persephone,\" Apollo said, draping an arm around her shoulders.",
      "\"How does it feel to join the ranks of the sexually-awakened?",
      "Much better on our side, right?\"",
      "It wasn't really a serious question, but Persephone considered it seriously anyway--a bit difficult given how all the wine was making her head swim.",
      "\"I don't know,\" she said at last, because it was the most honest answer she was capable of giving at that moment.",
      "Apollo raised an eyebrow.",
      "\"You don't know?\"",
      "\"I don't know,\" she mimicked him.",
      "\"I feel like I don't know anything anymore.",
      "I thought I was more grown-up, less sheltered, becoming an adult, developing my own life, but now I just feel like... like...\" \"Like a ship without anchor?\"",
      "\"Yes, exactly!\"",
      "Dionysus put a hand on Apollo's arm.",
      "\"That was beautiful, man.\"",
      "\"How did you know?\" Persephone asked, turning her head to look Apollo in the eye (or at least the eyes she thought were his; focusing on his face wasn't as easy as she felt it probably ought to be).",
      "He shrugged nonchalantly.",
      "\"You had that 'anchorless ship' look.\"",
      "\"My mother says I'm ruined, and I'm like, what does that even mean.",
      "And Hades got all formal and weird when I left and he wouldn't even look at me.",
      "What am I even there for?",
      "It's not as if I even really like the sex thing...\" Apollo and Dionysus both leaned forward to exchange glances around her.",
      "\"Don't like?\"",
      "\"Sex 'thing'?\"",
      "\"I don't know how it is for men, but it's kind of boring if you ask me.\"",
      "She took another sip from her cup, which she had still somehow not managed to spill, despite all her gesturing.",
      "\"I just lie there while he does... whatever...\" \"Oh, Persephone.\"",
      "Dionysus shook his head.",
      "\"Oh, honey, no.\"",
      "Apollo gave her shoulder a little squeeze.",
      "Both of them were clearly trying not to laugh.",
      "\"What?",
      "What do you mean?\"",
      "She'd had far too much to drink to understand their subtle jibes and looks, though if she was honest with herself, she wasn't entirely sure she'd understand them even if she were stone-cold sober.",
      "\"What do you guys do, exactly?\" Apollo asked.",
      "\"As if you need to ask,\" Dionysus replied before Persephone could.",
      "\"Lights out, covers on--\" \"Missionary position,\" both of them finished together.",
      "Persephone could feel her face flushing, but it was possible that was just the wine.",
      "\"Isn't that how it's done?\"",
      "\"If you're boring,\" Apollo said.",
      "\"It's not like there are rules,\" Dionysus told her.",
      "\"You've got hands.",
      "And tongues.",
      "And more than one hole.\"",
      "No, she was definitely flushing, a hot, full-body thing that creeped up her torso and along her arms and legs, like someone was shoving her towards a fire.",
      "Was she about to get burned?",
      "Dionysus noticed.",
      "\"I think we're going to need more wine.",
      "Where's Hebe?\"",
      "\"Also diagrams!\"",
      "Apollo added eagerly.",
      "\"Actually, I have a better idea!\"",
      "Dionysus said, his eyes lighting up.",
      "He kicked Hermes where he lay.",
      "\"Wake up, we need you and your friend for something!\"",
      "\"Where have you been all day, dear?\" Demeter was arranging dried flowers around the room, the celebration of her beloved daughter's return clearly not over as far as she was concerned.",
      "Persephone stepped up beside her to help.",
      "\"With Dionysus and Apollo.\"",
      "Demeter's hands froze for a second, then carried on as if nothing was wrong.",
      "\"Oh,\" she said tightly.",
      "\"Why don't you spend some time with your sisters and your old friends?",
      "You haven't seen them much at all since you got back, have you?\" Persephone bit her lip.",
      "\"I don't know.",
      "Things are too different now, I guess.",
      "They don't seem to want to spend time with me.",
      "It's okay though.",
      "I had fun with the boys.",
      "Hermes was there too, but then he had to run off for...\" She trailed off, processing the look on her mother's face.",
      "\"What?\" Demeter looked like she was going to cry all over again.",
      "\"He's ruined you!\"",
      "she wailed.",
      "Persephone frowned, but couldn't bring herself to articulate why she felt sure that wasn't the case at all.",
      "\"Mother, it's fine.",
      "I'm not upset at all.",
      "Look.\"",
      "She smiled.",
      "\"See? I'm happy.\"",
      "Demeter's lip wobbled, but she tried valiantly to smile in return.",
      "\"My darling.",
      "So brave in the face of such horrors.\"",
      "She threw her arms around her daughter in a hug and held her tight, as if she planned never to let go.",
      "Persephone hugged her back, but when at last they separated, she felt a small measure of relief.",
      "Hermes left her in her garden as the sun set on the last day of spring, as before.",
      "But this time was otherwise different: this time, she was ready.",
      "She held her head high and instead of waiting there uncertainly, she went straight into the palace.",
      "Hades was on his way out, and the two nearly ran into one another.",
      "He looked startled--by what, she couldn't say.",
      "Had he forgotten what day it was?",
      "Had he expected her to wait outside for him?",
      "Or was it simply that there was something different in her face and the way she carried herself?",
      "She had realized something: making love wasn't about giving herself away; it was about sharing herself with someone she loved.",
      "And she loved Hades, deeply and completely--there was no question about that now.",
      "She loved his awkwardness, his silly long capes, his hidden tenderness.",
      "She loved the feel of his hands on her face and body, the feel of his lips against hers, the feel of his weight beside her as she slept.",
      "She loved the look in his eyes that told her he loved her too.",
      "\"I'm back,\" she said, unnecessarily.",
      "Then she grabbed him by his robes and pulled him in for a fierce kiss.",
      "Hades was stunned when at last they came up for air.",
      "\"Oh.\"",
      "\"I'm not even going to make an issue of the way you acted when I left.",
      "Water under the bridge as far as I'm concerned.\"",
      "Hades quirked an eyebrow.",
      "\"And yet you bring it up anyway.\"",
      "\"Well it kind of pissed me off if you want to know the truth, but I'm just saying.\"",
      "He cleared his throat somewhat awkwardly.",
      "\"I'm sorry.",
      "I should explain.",
      "I was... worried.",
      "That you were glad to be leaving me.",
      "And...",
      "I reacted to these feelings in an extremely mature fashion, as you saw.",
      "I have been kicking myself for it everyday since.\"",
      "She stared at him.",
      "\"Seriously?",
      "That's what that was all about?\" \"Mm.\"",
      "He looked down, thoroughly chagrined.",
      "She shook her head.",
      "\"I guess I'm just going to have to prove to you that you have nothing to worry about.",
      "Fortunately for you, I have just the thing in mind.\"",
      "The message arrived on a lazy afternoon while Apollo and Dionysus were enjoying themselves under the hot summer sun.",
      "Dionysus was stretched out in the grass, a pair of dryads on either side of him hand-feeding him grapes.",
      "Apollo sat nearby playing his lyre and singing a song that was, on the surface, about a mighty battle, but was actually about sex.",
      "The dryads giggled and blushed demurely and pretended to be oblivious the double meaning (but then, Dionysus wondered, trying not to roll his eyes, why were they blushing?).",
      "Hermes interrupted them with his appearance, message in hand.",
      "\"You guys are gonna want to see this right away.",
      "It's from Persephone.",
      "She addressed it to the three of us and 'that lovely lady friend of Hermes'.'\" He grinned, handing it down to Dionysus, who immediately read it with an ever-widening smile on his face.",
      "\"What does it say?\"",
      "Apollo asked, his curiosity forcing him to pause his song.",
      "Dionysus looked up at his brother, his grin as wide as it would go.",
      "\"It looks like our dear sister has just discovered multiple orgasms.\""

    "text": "It started at the family dinner where Apollo gave Artemis a banana split. \"Hey, sis, I made this for you. Extra nuts!\" Artemis knew better than to not be suspicious. \"What's in it?\" \"Ice cream. Bananas. It's a banana split, what do you think is in it?\" Apollo was an amazing liar in most circumstances, but in conversation with his twin was not one of them. He seemed to be telling the truth: it was an ordinary ice cream dish and it would not have her speaking in rhyming couplets or breaking out in boils or anything like that. So, she muttered thanks and took a bite. It tasted fine. Good, in fact. Really good. She was halfway through it before she realized everyone was staring at her. Then she took a look down at the banana split, a good, hard look at the way the banana and the ice cream scoops were laid out. She spit her mouthful back into the bowl involuntarily, shoved it away from herself, and stormed out of the room, peals of laughter following her every mortified step. Apollo appeared directly in front of her. She stopped short and glared at him with all her might. \"Aw, come on, sis, it was just a joke!\" \"A really, really not funny one!\" she spat. \"It was hilarious! Lighten up!\" Apollo probably would have spontaneously combusted under her gaze if he weren't immortal. \"Come on. They wouldn't laugh so hard if you could laugh too!\" \"I don't laugh at things that aren't funny!\" \"Whatever. You laugh at that overused heart/hart pun every time.\" Artemis put a hand over her mouth to stop from giggling. She was still mad! \"So do you!\" \"Touche.\" She shoved her way past him. \"Just go back to laughing with everyone else.\" So he shrugged and went back to dinner. That banana split wasn't going to finish itself. They didn't see one another much until a few days later when Apollo appeared beside her in the field where she sat, his face red with anger. \"What did you do to my iTunes library?\" Artemis calmly continued to sharpen the heads of the arrows in her lap. \"I've never had an interest in libraries. You know that.\" \"Not that kind of library. My iTunes library. My music library.\" Artemis shrugged and shook her head. \"Don't give me that. I know it was you, except you had to have some kind of help, because you don't know how to work a computer and I can't imagine you have any idea what Kidz Bop is.\" Artemis just stared at him with wide innocent eyes and a carefully blank face that he didn't buy for a second. He took a deep breath. \"Somebody deleted my music files and replaced them with the Kidz Bop versions! You might not have the capability to do that, but you certainly have the motive.\" Artemis set a sharpened arrow aside and moved onto the next one. \"I'm sure there are people who have both the 'motive' and the 'capability.' Why don't you bother some of them?\" \"Because this has that extra vindictive spiteful edge that is unique to you,\" Apollo pointed out with a smile that was equal parts sweetness and poison. \"I will accept the compliment with thanks, but I'm afraid it is still undeserved.\" \"And you forget that even if I wasn't your brother, I'm still the god of truth and I can tell when you're lying through your teeth like right now for example.\" Artemis just shrugged again. Apollo clenched his jaw and made a sound like wounded prey shortly before its hunter put it out of its misery, then he disappeared with a blast of the Kidz Bop version of \"Forget You.\" Persephone emerged from the woods nearby, her arms full of wildflowers. \"Was that Apollo just now?\" \"What tipped you off, all the hot air?\" Persephone sighed and sat down, then started to work on a wildflower garland. \"He is so going to figure out it was me. But we're even now, okay? You have to stand by your side of the bargain!\" \"I will not tell your mother that I caught you sneaking back in yesterday morning,\" Artemis said solemnly. And then Persephone explained what a brofist was, and Artemis reluctantly allowed herself to be engaged in one. Shortly afterwards, Artemis left Olympus for a couple of weeks on a hunt. When she opened the door to her place upon her return, she discovered that Apollo had used the time to get his revenge. The walls were covered in posters: huge glossy pictures men in various states of undress. Hairy men, smooth men, men of all colors and sizes. The furniture was covered in leopard print (Dionysus' touch, she suspected) and was arranged so that the bed was the focal point. Somewhere inside there was a speaker system (not hers) blasting \"Push It.\" \"You've redecorated!\" Apollo said, appearing at her shoulder. \"Nice! I like it!\" Artemis spun around, unable to look at the display before her for another second. \"Put it back to normal! And turn off that noise!\" \"Love this song!\" Apollo said, as if he hadn't heard her. \"This dance ain't for everybody, only the sexy people!\" \"Apollo!\" Apollo froze mid-pushing it. \"What?\" \"Change it back to how it was!\" He arched an eyebrow. \"Now, Arty. That would involve me going inside, and I know men aren't allowed to violate your inner sanctum.\" Artemis slammed the door shut behind her, cutting off the music mid-line. \"Amazing soundproofing, by the way,\" Apollo said with a nod. Artemis glared. \"It was a necessity, given the neighborhood.\" Apollo was no fool; he knew Artemis wasn't going to let something like that go. He found himself triple-checking everything he ate, watching his back with extreme vigilance, and sleeping with one eye open (literally). And then finally his bros convinced him to relax and have a night out with them (he'd forgiven Persephone for the Kidz Bop thing; after all, it had been in pursuit of making sure she could still get laid regularly, and he couldn't exactly fault her for that). It was late when he stumbled back to his quarters and there was a giggling nymph draped on his arm and he was horny and vulnerable. He should have known that's when any hunter worth her bow would strike. \"Hello,\" Artemis said, snapping on a light. Apollo sat up with a start. He still had a pair of shorts on, but he was mostly naked, and so was the nymph. But his sister wasn't freaking out. She was staring at him steadily. His wine-addled brain was slow to piece it together: his sister's ability to compartmentalize was biting him in the ass. To Artemis there was her brother the man, and there was her brother the fool. Normally when nearly-nude females were involved, he was her brother the man. Clearly she had managed to keep him in her brother the fool territory just for this special occasion. Touching. \"Don't let me stop you,\" she said. \"Go back to what you were doing.\" It would have served her right if he had. It would have served her right if he'd just screwed that nymph right in front of her. But she was taking a calculated risk, and she knew he would not call her bluff. She was right on that count. Nothing made him lose wood faster than the thought of his virgin baby sister sitting just feet away, staring at him. He sunk down onto his elbows, his head dropping back. This was physically painful. \"We can talk, if you'd rather,\" she said while he agonized over this. \"I'm curious about what he tells girls to get them into this position. He doesn't use those lines on me. Did he tell you that Lord Byron was his son? Yes, he's awfully proud of Georgie. Funny story about that, though. I heard he's not even Polly's boy--he's actually Zeus's.\" Apollo sat all the way up now, sobered with just a few short words. \"Who said that? Did Zeus say that? Is Zeus telling people that?\" Artemis gave a careless shrug. \"I'm inclined to believe it's true. I mean, neither of you is exactly the paragon of discretion.\" \"Byron was my son!\" Apollo said, jerking a thumb at his bare chest. \"Mine! How could he have been--I mean, come on! The pet bear thing? That is totally my influence! Hello, his sense of fashion? Do you think that sort of thing just happens?\" \"You do seem like you could be brothers.\" \"We are not brothers!\" Apollo shrieked. \"He was my son! Do you want details of how I banged his mother? Because I could give you details!\" \"I'm sure our father could tell a similar story of his own exploits with the woman.\" \"No he couldn't because that so did not happen, okay! I haven't even mentioned the poetry! Who's god of poetry again? Hmm?\" Artemis pretended to think. \"Oh, yes, how could I be so silly. I forgot about Hermes.\" \"He's not Hermes' son either!\" Apollo was literally flailing now. \"I'm going to go now,\" the nymph muttered, but Apollo was in such a righteous fury he didn't even notice as she slipped out into the night. Artemis yawned. \"I didn't realize how late it was. I'm going to be off then. Can I borrow one of your volumes of Byron for some bedtime reading? I understand if you don't want to hang onto them anymore.\" \"He was totally my son okay I don't ever want to hear you or anyone else say otherwise!\" The next morning Apollo was sober and rational enough to realize what Artemis had done to him: not only had she successfully cockblocked him that night, she had manipulated him into cockblocking himself for the foreseeable future. He could tell by the giggles and stares from the nymphs and dryads, who all abruptly stopped talking upon seeing him as he walked through Olympus. Word got around fast. All the same, the more important matter on his mind was no seriously, was Zeus saying shit about Byron being his son? Even though there was the logical part of him that realized his paranoid sulking was playing right into Artemis's hands, he couldn't stop himself. In-between his sulking, though, he devised a plan for retaliation that would be both swift and public. It was time for one of Zeus's brief interim Council meetings. Apollo had always been under the impression that he did it as a loophole for having meetings without having to invite Hades. (It also meant no Dionysus while he was on probation. Bummer.) Apollo watched Artemis as she walked into the room to her seat. She eyed him back warily. He just smiled jauntily. \"All right, everybody, shut up and sit down and let's get this over with,\" Zeus growled in a tone of voice that let them all know he was battling a fierce hangover. Artemis cast one last glance at Apollo, then sat down. Instantly the bottom of the throne snapped in two and she was lying flat on her back on the floor. \"Mom was right; there is a first time for everything,\" Hermes said, lazily snapping a photo with his iPhone. Apollo laughed triumphantly as he sat down on his own throne. As soon as his weight was settled on it, it melted into sticky goo all around him. \"What the--!\" He let out a strangled cry. \"This is my favorite shirt!\" \"Good!\" Artemis snapped from the floor. Apollo would have jumped to his feet, except the goo held him back, nearly causing him to stumble, but the goo stopped that as well. The end result was the he mostly just kind of wobbled in place and flailed a bit. So he settled for shouting impotently from where he was stuck. \"I didn't even do anything first!\" \"It was a pre-emptive strike!\" Artemis shouted back. Apollo turned his glare on Athena, whom he had no doubts was the one to plant that particular suggestion in his twin's head. Athena just continued to read her mortal newspaper. \"Oh, that Garfield,\" she muttered with a small shake of her head. \"He really does not like Mondays.\" \"The next person who talks,\" Zeus said loudly enough to make everyone shut up and no louder, \"will be the next main attraction in the Electrical Parade. And they only still have that running in Tokyo so I hope you like sushi and also being electrified.\" No one spoke. \"You two,\" he said, pointing at Artemis and Apollo. \"The fuck?\" \"He started it!\" Artemis shouted from the floor, where she was stuck like a flipped turtle. Hermes hummed the Electrical Parade theme under his breath. \"He asked me a question,\" Artemis snapped. \"Just because I gave you ice cream!\" Apollo shouted, struggling against the goo that held him fast. \"Oh you know exactly what you did!\" Zeus snapped his fingers and gags appeared over both their mouths. \"I'm sorry I asked.\" \"Dear,\" Hera said, reaching for his hand. \"I think it sounds like the little dears could use a bit of a time out.\" She kept her voice even as she spoke, but nobody missed the ghost of a smirk on her lips. And that was how Artemis and Apollo came to spend the entirety of a Council meeting standing in opposite corners of the room, facing their respective walls and fighting the almost overwhelming urge to snipe at each other--Zeus had promised to extend the punishment if that happened, and Hera volunteered to watch them, and if there was one thing they could both agree on, it was that nothing was worth that.",

      "\"Somebody deleted my music files and replaced them with the Kidz Bop versions!",
      "You might not have the capability to do that, but you certainly have the motive.\"",
      "Artemis set a sharpened arrow aside and moved onto the next one.",
      "\"I'm sure there are people who have both the 'motive' and the 'capability.'",
      "Why don't you bother some of them?\"",
      "\"Because this has that extra vindictive spiteful edge that is unique to you,\" Apollo pointed out with a smile that was equal parts sweetness and poison.",
      "\"I will accept the compliment with thanks, but I'm afraid it is still undeserved.\"",
      "\"And you forget that even if I wasn't your brother, I'm still the god of truth and I can tell when you're lying through your teeth like right now for example.\"",
      "Artemis just shrugged again.",
      "Apollo clenched his jaw and made a sound like wounded prey shortly before its hunter put it out of its misery, then he disappeared with a blast of the Kidz Bop version of \"Forget You.\"",
      "Persephone emerged from the woods nearby, her arms full of wildflowers.",
      "\"Was that Apollo just now?\"",
      "\"What tipped you off, all the hot air?\" Persephone sighed and sat down, then started to work on a wildflower garland.",
      "\"He is so going to figure out it was me.",
      "But we're even now, okay?",
      "You have to stand by your side of the bargain!\"",
      "\"I will not tell your mother that I caught you sneaking back in yesterday morning,\" Artemis said solemnly.",
      "And then Persephone explained what a brofist was, and Artemis reluctantly allowed herself to be engaged in one.",
      "Shortly afterwards, Artemis left Olympus for a couple of weeks on a hunt.",
      "When she opened the door to her place upon her return, she discovered that Apollo had used the time to get his revenge.",
      "The walls were covered in posters: huge glossy pictures men in various states of undress.",
      "Hairy men, smooth men, men of all colors and sizes.",
      "The furniture was covered in leopard print (Dionysus' touch, she suspected) and was arranged so that the bed was the focal point.",
      "Somewhere inside there was a speaker system (not hers) blasting \"Push It.\"",
      "\"You've redecorated!\"",
      "Apollo said, appearing at her shoulder.",
      "\"Nice!",
      "I like it!\"",
      "Artemis spun around, unable to look at the display before her for another second.",
      "\"Put it back to normal!",
      "And turn off that noise!\"",
      "\"Love this song!\"",
      "Apollo said, as if he hadn't heard her.",
      "\"This dance ain't for everybody, only the sexy people!\"",
      "\"Apollo!\"",
      "Apollo froze mid-pushing it.",
      "\"What?\"",
      "\"Change it back to how it was!\"",
      "He arched an eyebrow.",
      "\"Now, Arty.",
      "That would involve me going inside, and I know men aren't allowed to violate your inner sanctum.\"",
      "Artemis slammed the door shut behind her, cutting off the music mid-line.",
      "\"Amazing soundproofing, by the way,\" Apollo said with a nod.",
      "Artemis glared.",
      "\"It was a necessity, given the neighborhood.\"",
      "Apollo was no fool; he knew Artemis wasn't going to let something like that go.",
      "He found himself triple-checking everything he ate, watching his back with extreme vigilance, and sleeping with one eye open (literally).",
      "And then finally his bros convinced him to relax and have a night out with them (he'd forgiven Persephone for the Kidz Bop thing; after all, it had been in pursuit of making sure she could still get laid regularly, and he couldn't exactly fault her for that).",
      "It was late when he stumbled back to his quarters and there was a giggling nymph draped on his arm and he was horny and vulnerable.",
      "He should have known that's when any hunter worth her bow would strike.",
      "\"Hello,\" Artemis said, snapping on a light.",
      "Apollo sat up with a start.",
      "He still had a pair of shorts on, but he was mostly naked, and so was the nymph.",
      "But his sister wasn't freaking out.",
      "She was staring at him steadily.",
      "His wine-addled brain was slow to piece it together: his sister's ability to compartmentalize was biting him in the ass.",
      "To Artemis there was her brother the man, and there was her brother the fool.",
      "Normally when nearly-nude females were involved, he was her brother the man.",
      "Clearly she had managed to keep him in her brother the fool territory just for this special occasion.",
      "Touching.",
      "\"Don't let me stop you,\" she said.",
      "\"Go back to what you were doing.\"",
      "It would have served her right if he had.",
      "It would have served her right if he'd just screwed that nymph right in front of her.",
      "But she was taking a calculated risk, and she knew he would not call her bluff.",
      "She was right on that count.",
      "Nothing made him lose wood faster than the thought of his virgin baby sister sitting just feet away, staring at him.",
      "He sunk down onto his elbows, his head dropping back.",
      "This was physically painful.",
      "\"We can talk, if you'd rather,\" she said while he agonized over this.",
      "\"I'm curious about what he tells girls to get them into this position.",
      "He doesn't use those lines on me.",
      "Did he tell you that Lord Byron was his son?",
      "Yes, he's awfully proud of Georgie.",
      "Funny story about that, though.",
      "I heard he's not even Polly's boy--he's actually Zeus's.\"",
      "Apollo sat all the way up now, sobered with just a few short words.",
      "\"Who said that?",
      "Did Zeus say that?",
      "Is Zeus telling people that?\"",
      "Artemis gave a careless shrug.",
      "\"I'm inclined to believe it's true.",
      "I mean, neither of you is exactly the paragon of discretion.\"",
      "\"Byron was my son!\"",
      "Apollo said, jerking a thumb at his bare chest.",
      "\"Mine!",
      "How could he have been--I mean, come on!",
      "The pet bear thing?",
      "That is totally my influence!",
      "Hello, his sense of fashion?",
      "Do you think that sort of thing just happens?\"",
      "\"You do seem like you could be brothers.\"",
      "\"We are not brothers!\"",
      "Apollo shrieked.",
      "\"He was my son!",
      "Do you want details of how I banged his mother?",
      "Because I could give you details!\"",
      "\"I'm sure our father could tell a similar story of his own exploits with the woman.\"",
      "\"No he couldn't because that so did not happen, okay!",
      "I haven't even mentioned the poetry!",
      "Who's god of poetry again?",
      "Hmm?\"",
      "Artemis pretended to think.",
      "\"Oh, yes, how could I be so silly.",
      "I forgot about Hermes.\"",
      "\"He's not Hermes' son either!\"",
      "Apollo was literally flailing now.",
      "\"I'm going to go now,\" the nymph muttered, but Apollo was in such a righteous fury he didn't even notice as she slipped out into the night.",
      "Artemis yawned.",
      "\"I didn't realize how late it was.",
      "I'm going to be off then.",
      "Can I borrow one of your volumes of Byron for some bedtime reading?",
      "I understand if you don't want to hang onto them anymore.\"",
      "\"He was totally my son okay I don't ever want to hear you or anyone else say otherwise!\"",
      "The next morning Apollo was sober and rational enough to realize what Artemis had done to him: not only had she successfully cockblocked him that night, she had manipulated him into cockblocking himself for the foreseeable future.",
      "He could tell by the giggles and stares from the nymphs and dryads, who all abruptly stopped talking upon seeing him as he walked through Olympus.",
      "Word got around fast.",
      "All the same, the more important matter on his mind was no seriously, was Zeus saying shit about Byron being his son?",
      "Even though there was the logical part of him that realized his paranoid sulking was playing right into Artemis's hands, he couldn't stop himself.",
      "In-between his sulking, though, he devised a plan for retaliation that would be both swift and public.",
      "It was time for one of Zeus's brief interim Council meetings.",
      "Apollo had always been under the impression that he did it as a loophole for having meetings without having to invite Hades.",
      "(It also meant no Dionysus while he was on probation.",
      "Bummer.)",
      "Apollo watched Artemis as she walked into the room to her seat.",
      "She eyed him back warily.",
      "He just smiled jauntily.",
      "\"All right, everybody, shut up and sit down and let's get this over with,\" Zeus growled in a tone of voice that let them all know he was battling a fierce hangover.",
      "Artemis cast one last glance at Apollo, then sat down.",
      "Instantly the bottom of the throne snapped in two and she was lying flat on her back on the floor.",
      "\"Mom was right; there is a first time for everything,\" Hermes said, lazily snapping a photo with his iPhone.",
      "Apollo laughed triumphantly as he sat down on his own throne.",
      "As soon as his weight was settled on it, it melted into sticky goo all around him.",
      "\"What the--!\"",
      "He let out a strangled cry.",
      "\"This is my favorite shirt!\"",
      "\"Good!\"",
      "Artemis snapped from the floor.",
      "Apollo would have jumped to his feet, except the goo held him back, nearly causing him to stumble, but the goo stopped that as well.",
      "The end result was the he mostly just kind of wobbled in place and flailed a bit.",
      "So he settled for shouting impotently from where he was stuck.",
      "\"I didn't even do anything first!\"",
      "\"It was a pre-emptive strike!\"",
      "Artemis shouted back.",
      "Apollo turned his glare on Athena, whom he had no doubts was the one to plant that particular suggestion in his twin's head.",
      "Athena just continued to read her mortal newspaper.",
      "\"Oh, that Garfield,\" she muttered with a small shake of her head.",
      "\"He really does not like Mondays.\"",
      "\"The next person who talks,\" Zeus said loudly enough to make everyone shut up and no louder, \"will be the next main attraction in the Electrical Parade.",
      "And they only still have that running in Tokyo so I hope you like sushi and also being electrified.\"",
      "No one spoke.",
      "\"You two,\" he said, pointing at Artemis and Apollo.",
      "\"The fuck?\"",
      "\"He started it!\"",
      "Artemis shouted from the floor, where she was stuck like a flipped turtle.",
      "Hermes hummed the Electrical Parade theme under his breath.",
      "\"He asked me a question,\" Artemis snapped.",
      "\"Just because I gave you ice cream!\"",
      "Apollo shouted, struggling against the goo that held him fast.",
      "\"Oh you know exactly what you did!\"",
      "Zeus snapped his fingers and gags appeared over both their mouths.",
      "\"I'm sorry I asked.\"",
      "\"Dear,\" Hera said, reaching for his hand.",
      "\"I think it sounds like the little dears could use a bit of a time out.\"",
      "She kept her voice even as she spoke, but nobody missed the ghost of a smirk on her lips.",
      "And that was how Artemis and Apollo came to spend the entirety of a Council meeting standing in opposite corners of the room, facing their respective walls and fighting the almost overwhelming urge to snipe at each other--Zeus had promised to extend the punishment if that happened, and Hera volunteered to watch them, and if there was one thing they could both agree on, it was that nothing was worth that."

    "text": "Artemis and Apollo each have one word they will only say to each other and no one else. For Artemis that word is Orion. If anyone else says it to her, she becomes angry and combative. Granted, \"angry\" and \"combative\" tend to be Artemis' default modes, but most quickly learn not to press that particular button. Some will, upon occasion, sometimes on purpose, sometimes on accident. But the reaction to the O-word is always immediate: narrowed eyes, aggressive stance, often an arrow in the eye of the one who said it. It is a line others are not allowed to cross without painful repercussions. Even Apollo knows to broach the subject with care. It's not dinnertime conversation--not for her and not for Apollo, either. He lacks closure in the Orion department as well, because Orion is the only one who can still make his sister feel not just anger, but genuine pain. And for that, Apollo can never forgive him. For Apollo the one word is Hyacinth. When others mention it, Apollo has the tendency to go hard of hearing, smiling too much and being too dismissive. Apollo is normally too cavalier in Artemis' opinion, but when he is trying not to show grief, he becomes a caricature of himself, too jaunty, too chipper, too light-hearted. He fools few people, least of all his twin. Artemis tells him that it isn't his fault, because it isn't. He was the one to throw the discus but it was Zephyr who put it on its deadly course. Apollo always smiles and bobs his head like he's a puppet on strings and insists he's fully aware of those facts, he bears no guilt about it at all, but the lie is so apparent it breaks his twin's heart. On the night they got word Iris had sent Zephyr packing, Artemis showed up at Apollo's place with a bottle of wine, and the two celebrated into the wee hours of the morning.",

    "text": "\"Oh Daddy.\" Hebe stood over the couch on which her father slept, hands on her hips. \"Not again.\" Zeus cracked one eye open. \"Don't start with me.\" \"I'm not starting anything. I'm just... judging you a bit, that's all!\" Zeus rolled his eyes. \"Easy for you to say.\" \"What, you mean because my husband and I are mutually unfaithful?\" \"Yep.\" \"Poor pitiful you, having a wife who refuses to cheat.\" \"It'd make my life a whole hell of a lot easier.\" \"Oh, please. It would kill you if she cheated. You men are all alike when it comes to your double standards in that regard.\" Zeus closed his eyes again. \"Be quiet, I'm sleeping.\" \"I'm just trying to get used to this sight since I know you'll be a fixture here for a while yet.\" \"It won't be that long before she gets horny again.\" \"Daddy!\" \"Hebe, you can't play the innocent maiden card with me anymore. Even if you didn't have kids, I've met your husband.\" She smacked him lightly on the arm. \"I mean, you should do something to get her to forgive you, instead of just leaving it.\" \"Why should I bother? You don't know your mother as well as I do, Hebe. I just have to give her some time to cool off. Once she starts chewing ice I know I'm in the home stretch.\" \"Daddy, come on. Just because she always does forgive you doesn't mean that you shouldn't make an effort anyway.\" \"I'm tired. Go bug your brothers.\" Hera would come back to his bed, she always did. He had no doubts about this. She didn't usually liked to be bothered while she was fuming either. He dozed off, thinking about what he had done to earn her ire this time and feeling quite satisfied with himself. \"Goooood morning, Z-Diddy!\" Zeus was jolted awake by Apollo flopping down on the couch next to him. \"The fuck?\" \"I have heard through the grapevine about your predicament and I have come to offer my not inconsiderable services!\" \"Gee, how thoughtful. Fuck off, I was in the middle of a dream about what I would have done to Thetis if it weren't for that damn prophecy.\" \"No, listen, I've got an idea and it is solid gold,\" Apollo insisted. Zeus sighed and rubbed his eyes. \"I suppose you're not going to leave me alone until I hear this 'solid gold' idea of yours.\" \"Damn straight! So anyway, there's this movie, I don't know if you've seen it...\" The volume on the boombox was all the way up. Zeus hit play and held it up over his head. Peter Gabriel blasted out over Olympus. He stood there for a few minutes, reminding himself he was King of Olympus and therefore was under no obligation to have shame, before Hera finally appeared at her window. He dropped the boombox but still didn't duck in time to avoid the shoe she threw at him. \"I hate that song and I hate John Cusack!\" She retreated into her room, slamming the window with a crash behind her. (If it had been built by mortals it would have shattered.) \"Dude!\" Apollo cried, popping up from the bush behind him. \"How can anyone hate John Cusack!\" The Iris Message arrived the next morning. Zeus thought for sure Dionysus was going to complain about his sentence yet again (he had no idea why the boy thought that would get it reduced rather than extended), so he was mildly bemused when D said, \"Get her drunk.\" \"What?\" \"The wife. Ply her with wine.\" He yawned. \"Not that I care or anything, but Apollo was telling me I should help. Oh dear, looks like one of the campers has caught on fire again. I had better go...\" He yawned again, stretched lazily, scratched himself, and then ended the message. Zeus sat back with a sigh and rubbed his face. He was only enabling those hens to keep interfering by listening to them, but all the same... \"And for my sake, don't act all nervous and giggly!\" Zeus whispered to Ganymede. Ganymede looked affronted by the very suggestion. \"You of all people should know that I am always exactly as smooth as I want to be.\" He pouted. \"I don't know why I'm even helping you with this. She'll get over it eventually. In the mean time we could...\" \"I'm trying something new, okay? Now go and serve her!\" Ganymede gave a pained sigh, then stepped out from behind the pillar where they were hidden and headed over to Hera, his hands cradling the especially-potent old vintage that Dionysus had made for him long before he'd been put on punishment. \"Finally,\" Hera said. \"I was getting parched.\" She held up her glass. \"I apologize,\" Ganymede said, only just barely not giggling as he poured the wine. \"I was slowed by a big gust of wind.\" Behind the pillar, Zeus rolled his eyes. \"Yes, well. I never expected you to be as competent as my daughter was,\" Hera said tightly. Ganymede gave a slight bow. \"If only.\" As he passed Zeus's hiding place on his way out, he made a face of disgust. Zeus watched silently as Hera took a tiny bite of her dinner, then reached for her glass. She took a sip, then set the glass down to pat her mouth gingerly with a napkin. She stood up, scooting the chair backwards out of her way, and walked toward the same door through which Ganymede had just left. Instead of going out after him, however, she turned at Zeus's pillar, threw the wine from her glass in his face (he hadn't even realized she'd picked it up again!), and said, \"As if you think you can drug me like an over-eager coed!\" Then she threw the empty glass at him and stormed out without a backward glance. The next one to approach him was Hermes. He was too quick; otherwise Zeus would have avoided him or shot him or something. \"You and I both know fancy tricks won't work,\" Hermes said. \"Hera's not that kind of woman. Keep it simple: use your words. They're your most powerful weapon.\" He paused, counting on his fingers. \"Well, third-most. That's still pretty good though, and definitely beats Cameron Crowe films and vaguely illegal uses of alcohol.\" \"Hera doesn't want to talk to me.\" \"That's why you convince her,\" Hermes said. \"Use your words to construct an argument so irrefutable she has no choice but to give in.\" \"Do you guys even listen to yourselves when you talk?\" \"Oh, so you'll wake up half of Olympus with eighties pop music but I suggest speaking persuasively and I'm the weirdo.\" Zeus sighed and pinched the bridge of his nose; he was getting a headache. \"Whatever. You have a point, good for you.\" Hermes shrugged. \"I'm just saying.\" Zeus glared at him. \"You're always 'just saying.' I wish you would just not say once in a while.\" Hermes grinned back. \"Then I wouldn't be me.\" \"Exactly.\" And so, because he had listened to Apollo now he had to listen to Hermes too. He found Hera in her sitting room, reading a J.D. Robb novel and sipping a latte. Zeus sat down on the sofa next to her and draped his arm over the back of it. \"So, I was thinking--\" \"Get out right now or I'll cut all the crotches out of your suit pants.\" Zeus got up and left. He knew a lost cause when he saw it. \"I'm sure you're wondering why I've gathered you all here today,\" Zeus said, leaning on the table and looking at each of the gods sitting around the table in turn. \"Certainly not just for the excuse to use that phrase,\" Apollo said. \"Funny, I don't remember asking you to come. Don't you, like, have a new season of Teen Mom to work on casting or something?\" \"I can't let my baby sister be in a room alone with men, can I!\" Artemis glared at him. \"How many times--\" \"Do you have to tell him, yeah, yeah, save it, you two can get a room later,\" Zeus interrupted. \"Listen, enough of these little 'counseling sessions' you guys have been seeing fit to give me. We're getting this over with here and now. Get all your stupid little 'advisements' out now so I can just go ahead and ignore them all at once.\" \"I have no idea what you are talking about,\" Athena said after a pause. \"You know, he and Hera are on the rocks. For a change,\" Hermes said drily. \"You have seriously called us here to discuss your love life?\" Artemis scoffed. \"Why don't you just leave her alone, if that's what she wants? You men could all do with learning to leave women alone more.\" \"Oh Arty,\" Aphrodite said, waving her hand. \"Speak for yourself. Personally I like being bothered by men.\" She winked at Ares, who put a hand over his mouth to keep from giggling. \"Disgraceful,\" Artemis said. Hephaestus shifted in his seat next to his wife. \"I don't see what you expect me to be able to offer on the subject.\" \"I'm not looking for anything,\" Zeus said. \"I just know you cute little kibitzers all think you have sage advice to offer on the subject and I really would like to get it all over with now.\" Athena leaned forward, resting her chin between her thumb and forefinger. \"I think first it is necessary to assess her defenses. It is basic strategy to locate your target's weak point and attack it.\" \"In bed,\" Ares added helpfully. \"Yes, Ares, 'in bed.' That is exactly what I was going to say next; how ever did you know?\" Athena said. \"So, what? Is that what you guys have to offer me? 'Attack her weak point'?\" \"For massive damage!\" Hermes and Apollo said at the same time, then fistbumped. \"I suggested leaving her alone,\" Artemis pointed out. \"Yes, which is what I was trying to do until your brothers decided to make themselves 'useful.'\" \"What's with all the 'air quotes' today, Z-Diddy?\" Apollo asked, mimicking him. \"They make you seem like 'a dick.'\" Zeus rolled his eyes. \"Anyone else? Anything at all?\" Hephaestus rubbed the back of his neck. \"Perhaps you should take this as a sign. You have had your share of troubles over the years. Perhaps it's time for both of you to move on.\" \"Uh, yeah, no, that's not going to happen.\" \"Try a bubble bath?\" Ares suggested. \"I can't even get her to talk to me, Ares. She's not going to get naked in a tub with me.\" Ares blinked. \"I didn't mean with her.\" Zeus sighed. \"Aphrodite, you've been awfully quiet. Isn't this sort of your domain? Don't tell me you have no opinion on the subject.\" \"Hardly,\" Aphrodite said, tossing her hair. \"Honestly, what's true love without a few ups and downs? That's what makes it interesting, isn't it? It wouldn't be true love if it weren't going to triumph in the end, would it?\" \"So your advice is 'do nothing,'\" Zeus said, for clarification. She shrugged. \"Or get her roses. That couldn't hurt.\" \"Such imagination. All right, all of you get out of my sight and I don't want to hear another word on this subject. I'm... gonna go take a bubble bath.\" Ares threw his arms up in the air. \"All right! Does that mean I win? What do I win?\" \"I'm not going to fry your ass today,\" Zeus said. \"Now all of you, beat it before I change my mind.\" Zeus got out just before his fingers went all pruney; he found a pruney king terribly undignified. He was toweling his hair off when he nearly ran into Hera. They both stopped short when they spotted one another. \"Shit, I hope you weren't wanting a bubble bath, 'cause, ah, I kinda just used the last of it,\" Zeus said after an awkward pause. \"Oh,\" Hera said through pursed lips. \"Then I shall just have to ask Ares to borrow some of his Mr. Bubble. I hope he won't mind.\" She turned to go. \"Wait, Hera, please.\" She stopped, but didn't turn back to face him. \"I'm... sorry. For all the weird shit I've been doing lately. I know you need your space, and it takes time. I was actually just going to leave it like I normally do, but then Hebe and everyone kept saying I should do something about it, and I realized... you know, they have a point. Not... that their ideas were any good. Obviously, they were shit. But I realized that I didn't want to just wait. I didn't want to waste that time that we could be spending together with things like this between us. I thought, isn't it better to try? To--to try and see if I can get things back on track sooner? So I did. I went about it like a dumbass, though, which is why I'm apologizing now. I knew gimmicks and tricks wouldn't work on you. You're not that kind of woman.\" Hera didn't make a move to indicate she'd even heard him for a long moment. Then she let out a sigh. \"You should know better than to listen to those fools. I mean, really, Peter Gabriel?\" \"That was Apollo.\" \"Apollo,\" Hera said at the same time as he did, nodding. She was half-turned towards him now. \"I did guess.\" \"I'm not going to mention who thought of the wine thing because you already hate Dionysus. Oops!\" Zeus put his hand over his mouth. Hera pursed her lips again, but this time it was to suppress a small smile. \"Wine. He was really stretching with that one, wasn't he.\" \"I guess anyone would get pretty predictable after a few thousand years,\" Zeus said with a slightly sheepish grin. Hera hesitated. \"You know, if you aren't too sick of bubble baths already...\" \"Drachma for your thoughts, Hermes?\" Aphrodite said. Hermes palmed the coin he'd been flipping in the air. \"I got this from Zeus. Slipped it to me this morning, said something about how I was 'partially right.'\" Aphrodite cocked an eyebrow. \"I did notice our resident power couple seems to have made up overnight.\" \"So it would seem indeed.\" \"You owe me half of that, you know,\" she told him with a grin. \"How do you figure?\" She giggled. \"Because my son and I are responsible for their spat in the first place, of course!\" She walked off, her head held high with self-satisfaction.",

    "text": "Zeus went to sleep in an empty bed for the first time since he could remember, his heart aching over Hera's disappearance in ways he neither could nor would ever articulate. Everyone had seen the change: he had shut down Olympus and he was more paranoid and temperamental than ever. No one even dared make jokes about blue balls, not even Dionysus, whom Zeus could tell at times really wanted to. It would not have been against his nature to take someone else to bed during this time--Ganymede refilled his cup eagerly, clearly ready to be the one that filled that position (and many others)--but in all honesty, the thought never even occurred to him. He would try to explain this later, once things were back to normal, and was met only with incredulity. No one really seemed to understand just how much her kidnapping broke him. Yes, he was a player. Or rather, he was the player. Yes, he would sleep with anything that moved, and some things that didn't, and flaunt it. Yes, he had crushed her heart and soul time and time again. But that didn't mean he didn't love her. In fact, he thought \"love\" might be the wrong word for what he and Hera had. It was certainly part of it, but he felt it didn't really do their relationship justice. (Zeus had tried to get Hermes to invent a word for it once; his son came back with \"kwyjibo\" and thought himself hilariously clever.) They were a part of each other. Not in that sappy \"better half\" way, that was a load of crap. They had four thousand years of history going for them; Hallmark card platitudes did not do them any kind of justice and in fact were rather insulting. Hera was like oxygen to him. In fact, being with her was even more necessary than breathing, as he didn't really need to do the latter to survive. He needed Hera though. He turned to look at her throne, she wasn't there. He reached across the bed, she wasn't there. He took a breath, she wasn't there. Every waking moment he was conscious of her absence, like a void that followed him everywhere. It didn't exactly make him sad. It made him ache, certainly, but mostly it just made him really fucking pissed. He was fucking Zeus for crying out loud. Nothing should trip him up this much, and nobody should be capable of causing him this kind of anguish. But she could. And whoever had taken her could. And somebody was going to pay.",

    "text": "Hestia remembers the day she fell ill and Rhea cared for her. Her mother sat at her bedside and recounted Hestia's favorite stories, of radiant Selene and her beautiful prince Endymion, of loyal Styx who never wavered, of the Hesperides who danced in their garden with the glittering golden apples. Her words were like music to Hestia, who drifted off into dreamless sleep to their soundtrack. She woke later to voices of a different sort, Rhea's and someone else's. She realized it was Hades. She was about to sit up and say hello to him when he said, \"But I don't fit in with them.\" He was crying! Hestia had never seen Hades cry. Even Poseidon had cried that time Zeus had whacked him below the belt with a tree branch (an accident, Zeus had insisted). But Hades had never shed a tear in her presence, nor in anyone else's as far as she knew--until now. \"I don't belong,\" he said tearfully. \"You are different from your brothers, it's true,\" Rhea said in a low voice. \"You are kinder and gentler, you keep to yourself more--some may see these things as oddities or weaknesses. But they're wrong. There is no 'one way' to be. You are my precious boy and I wouldn't change you for anything.\" Hestia opened her eyelids just enough to see that Rhea had Hades gathered in her lap. She stroked his dark hair and spoke in a low voice near his ear. \"I already have a Zeus and a Poseidon. I don't want another one. I want my Hades.\" \"But even the girls...\" \"Even the girls what? Demeter and Hera love you, and Hestia practically worships the ground you walk on.\" Hestia hoped that if either saw the blush on her cheeks they would chalk it up to fever. \"You should spend more time with her once she's well. You two always seem so much happier when you're together.\" There was a pause, then Hades said, \"I will. Thank you. I feel much better now.\" He climbed down from her lap, wiping his eyes and rubbing his cheeks until he looked little more than flushed. He kissed her cheek, then left the room quietly. \"You can stop pretending to be asleep now,\" Rhea said with the hint of a smile. Hestia opened her eyes. \"I didn't mean to eavesdrop.\" \"No harm was done. I know you aren't one to gossip.\" Rhea sat on the edge of Hestia's bed and brushed her hair from her sweaty forehead. \"I'm just glad that Zeus and Demeter didn't wake you up when they were in here earlier. Now, shall I tell you the story of Oceanus' tears?\" Demeter remembers the day at the baths when Rhea caught the boys spying. Her brothers were the antithesis of subtle, so it wasn't very hard to figure out they were there--especially not once the scuffle broke out between Zeus and Poseidon over who should have the best vantage point. \"Stay right here, girls,\" Rhea said, getting out of the bath and marching over to where the boys had attempted to secrete themselves. Hades saw her coming and tried to alert the other two, but Zeus and Poseidon ignored him like they always did, and so caught up in their squabbling were they that they didn't see their mother until she was essentially on top of them. She stood over them, hands on her hips, and said, \"What are you doing?\" All three of them stared at her, dumbstruck and unable to answer. Behind her, Hera and Demeter were shooting them death glares, already moved in place to block Hestia from view. \"I asked you a question, boys.\" \"They said they wanted to see who had the bigger jugs, Hera or Demeter,\" Hades blurted out. \"Shut up!\" Zeus hissed at him over his shoulder. \"Oh? Well. In that case it's only fair if you return the favor,\" Rhea said. Zeus and Poseidon exchanged glances, then looked back up at her. \"What?\" \"You've seen enough of the girls. Now let them judge you.\" \"You can't be serious,\" Poseidon spluttered. But her face told them she was as serious as hemlock. Zeus and Poseidon slowly got to their feet and began to strip, their fingers fumbling with knots that normally would not have slowed them. \"You too, Hades.\" Hades looked like he'd just been force-fed overripe olives. \"But I--\" \"But you came with them and you looked with them.\" Hades could only stare back at her, as if waiting for her to relent and say \"just kidding,\" but no clemency was forthcoming. Redder than the inside of a pomegranate, he stood and began to undress with his brothers. Hestia refused to look, but Demeter and Hera were more than happy to participate in this game. They dressed, then circled the naked boys, poking, examining, and commenting at length. \"Is it supposed to be that color?\" Hera remarked. \"Look, doesn't one of those look a bit higher than the other?\" Demeter said. \"That's a rather unusual shape.\" \"I knew that wasn't his natural hair color.\" Even after extensive consideration, however, they never were able to come to an agreement over whether it was Zeus or Poseidon who had the better equipment; it would remain a point of contention with them into their adulthood. Hera remembers the day Rhea left. She had been alone with Zeus, stolen moments slipping into hours, when Rhea passed right by their hiding place, oblivious to their presence. \"Mother?\" Hera said, sticking her head out. She swatted away Zeus, who was trying to hush her up. Rhea stopped, startled. It was only then Hera realized how frazzled and lost in thought she truly was. \"Hera?\" \"Mother, are you going somewhere?\" Rhea looked drained. She wrung her hands without seeming to realize she was even doing it. \"I am.\" \"Where? Are you all right? You seem a bit out of sorts.\" At the worried tone in her voice, Zeus gave up trying to stay hidden as well. \"Mother? Is something the matter?\" \"Oh, hello, Zeus,\" Rhea said distractedly. \"I didn't see you there.\" Zeus and Hera exchanged worried looks. \"I'm just going... I'm going...\" Rhea sighed and dropped her hands. \"I'm going away.\" \"'Away'?\" Zeus repeated. \"Yes. It's... time. It's past time, really.\" \"Mother, I'm afraid I don't understand.\" Hera fought back the rising panic she was starting to feel. Rhea smiled at the two of them gently. \"It's past my time. I'm a relic of a bygone era, a memory of an age that ended long ago. And rightly so. It's time for you, for you and your brothers and sisters.\" She took Zeus's chin in her hand. \"My brave, handsome boy, you are king now.\" She turned to Hera, taking her hand. \"And you, my beautiful daughter, you will be his queen.\" Hera blushed and looked down. \"I don't know...\" \"I do.\" She patted Hera's hand before letting it go. \"I have done all I can for you. I'm so proud of what you have all become, such strong, vibrant adults. When I look at you, I know that whatever else, some good has come of me, of me and... of your father.\" Zeus's face soured at the mention of their long-gone patriarch, but he said nothing. \"I hope that...\" She paused here, trying to collect her thoughts. \"I hope that a part of me shall always remain with you, as a part of you shall always be with me.\" \"Mother, you don't have to leave,\" Hera said, forcing the desperation to say out of her voice and locked inside her chest. \"I'm afraid I do, sweet. It's something I hope you will understand someday. Time marches on. Things change. Nothing lasts forever, not even us. Sometimes in life one must do what is necessary, even if it is painful. Take care of your siblings. Demeter is more lonely than she lets on. Hestia is a gentle thing, too gentle for this world I sometimes fear. Poseidon struggles with life in your shadow, Zeus. And Hades has always felt like an outcast. Love and cherish them, and each other, as I have. That's my only request.\" Then she kissed each of them on the cheek one last time before walking out of their lives forever. Rhea remembers everything. On the other side of the world from her children--not babies anymore, not for many generations, but always her babies--she treasures each and every one, holding them more dear than gold or jewels. Thousands of miles and years removed from them, they are all she has left.",

      "\"But I--\" \"But you came with them and you looked with them.\"",
      "Hades could only stare back at her, as if waiting for her to relent and say \"just kidding,\" but no clemency was forthcoming.",
      "Redder than the inside of a pomegranate, he stood and began to undress with his brothers.",
      "Hestia refused to look, but Demeter and Hera were more than happy to participate in this game.",
      "They dressed, then circled the naked boys, poking, examining, and commenting at length.",
      "\"Is it supposed to be that color?\" Hera remarked.",
      "\"Look, doesn't one of those look a bit higher than the other?\" Demeter said.",
      "\"That's a rather unusual shape.\"",
      "\"I knew that wasn't his natural hair color.\"",
      "Even after extensive consideration, however, they never were able to come to an agreement over whether it was Zeus or Poseidon who had the better equipment; it would remain a point of contention with them into their adulthood.",
      "Hera remembers the day Rhea left.",
      "She had been alone with Zeus, stolen moments slipping into hours, when Rhea passed right by their hiding place, oblivious to their presence.",
      "\"Mother?\"",
      "Hera said, sticking her head out.",
      "She swatted away Zeus, who was trying to hush her up.",
      "Rhea stopped, startled.",
      "It was only then Hera realized how frazzled and lost in thought she truly was.",
      "\"Hera?\"",
      "\"Mother, are you going somewhere?\" Rhea looked drained.",
      "She wrung her hands without seeming to realize she was even doing it.",
      "\"I am.\"",
      "\"Where?",
      "Are you all right?",
      "You seem a bit out of sorts.\"",
      "At the worried tone in her voice, Zeus gave up trying to stay hidden as well.",
      "\"Mother?",
      "Is something the matter?\"",
      "\"Oh, hello, Zeus,\" Rhea said distractedly.",
      "\"I didn't see you there.\"",

      "\"'Away'?\" Zeus repeated.",
      "\"Yes.",
      "It's... time.",
      "It's past time, really.\"",
      "\"Mother, I'm afraid I don't understand.\"",
      "Hera fought back the rising panic she was starting to feel.",
      "Rhea smiled at the two of them gently.",
      "\"It's past my time.",
      "I'm a relic of a bygone era, a memory of an age that ended long ago.",
      "And rightly so.",
      "It's time for you, for you and your brothers and sisters.\"",
      "She took Zeus's chin in her hand.",
      "\"My brave, handsome boy, you are king now.\"",
      "She turned to Hera, taking her hand.",
      "\"And you, my beautiful daughter, you will be his queen.\"",
      "Hera blushed and looked down.",
      "\"I don't know...\" \"I do.\"",
      "She patted Hera's hand before letting it go.",
      "\"I have done all I can for you.",
      "I'm so proud of what you have all become, such strong, vibrant adults.",
      "When I look at you, I know that whatever else, some good has come of me, of me and... of your father.\"",
      "Zeus's face soured at the mention of their long-gone patriarch, but he said nothing.",
      "\"I hope that...\" She paused here, trying to collect her thoughts.",
      "\"I hope that a part of me shall always remain with you, as a part of you shall always be with me.\"",
      "\"Mother, you don't have to leave,\" Hera said, forcing the desperation to say out of her voice and locked inside her chest.",
      "\"I'm afraid I do, sweet.",
      "It's something I hope you will understand someday.",
      "Time marches on.",
      "Things change.",
      "Nothing lasts forever, not even us.",
      "Sometimes in life one must do what is necessary, even if it is painful.",
      "Take care of your siblings.",
      "Demeter is more lonely than she lets on.",
      "Hestia is a gentle thing, too gentle for this world I sometimes fear.",
      "Poseidon struggles with life in your shadow, Zeus.",
      "And Hades has always felt like an outcast.",
      "Love and cherish them, and each other, as I have.",
      "That's my only request.\"",
      "Then she kissed each of them on the cheek one last time before walking out of their lives forever.",
      "Rhea remembers everything.",
      "On the other side of the world from her children--not babies anymore, not for many generations, but always her babies--she treasures each and every one, holding them more dear than gold or jewels.",
      "Thousands of miles and years removed from them, they are all she has left."

    "text": "Hestia was surprised but not displeased the day all three of her brothers came to her at once. Her joy waned somewhat when they told her why they were there. \"His son stole my Master Bolt!\" Zeus shouted, pointing a finger accusingly at Poseidon. \"And my Helm of Darkness, don't forget!\" Hades added, his face nearly purple with rage. \"Oh, fuck off, Hades, nobody cares about your stupid fugly helmet!\" Zeus snapped. \"That thing is so 1996 anyway!\" \"My helm is just as important as if not more than your stupid lightning bolt!\" Hades shot back. \"Can your little hat destroy half the planet in one go? Didn't think so! Suck it up!\" \"Both of you, shut up and stop blaming my son!\" Poseidon roared. \"You mean your little thief?\" Hades snarled. Hestia had had enough. She stood up, drawing herself up to her full five feet, and said in a low voice, \"Quiet, all of you.\" They all hushed immediately. \"I want to hear what happened from each of you, one at a time.\" \"Well I can tell you what didn't happen, which was--\" Hestia shot Poseidon a look. He fell silent again. \"I'll hear from each of you one at a time,\" she went on, looking at each of them in turn. \"The other two will kindly wait outside--quietly--while their brother speaks his piece. Then I will tell you my thoughts. Is that acceptable?\" Her brothers exchanged glances, then nodded at her. \"Yes, we'll trust your judgment,\" Poseidon said. \"I always trust her judgment,\" said Hades. Hestia gave him a pointed look. He shrugged innocently and gave her his best I'm just saying look. \"I'll hear from Hades first.\" \"Of course you will,\" Zeus couldn't help grousing. \"Brother,\" she said sternly. \"Both of you. Outside, please.\" Poseidon and Zeus left the room, muttering unintelligibly and casting dark looks at each other and back at Hades. \"Now. Let's have a seat and you can start at the beginning, hm?\" Hades' version I had just arrived at Olympus, earlier than everyone else even though they all live here. Oh, wait, sorry, Demeter was here first, being her usual charmingly shrill self. What a pleasant greeting that was, being asked how my hostage was doing despite the fact that she knows we've been happily married for--yes, I know, apologies, I'm just trying to be thorough. As I was saying, everyone else showed up one by one, Athena came shortly after me, I think, then the twins... Zeus was one of the last. Then Dionysus. Poseidon was late, probably because he was plotting with that whelp of his--I know it's technically conjecture but it seems pretty obvious in light of what's happened since. So you know how the meeting went, you were there. Everybody was insufferable and useless. I'm being factual! Yes, they were! Whatever. Anyway, after Zeus was finally done prattling on about nothing, yes he was, I was going to go have a talk with you, but Ares beat me to it. He was asking about what? Poke... what? What is that? Oh. Indeed. I tried to make myself scarce while waiting for him to be done but that was when Apollo and Hermes approached me. And we talked and by the time we were done--what? What do you mean, \"about what\"? Nothing important....very well, then. They asked me about where I... where I got my cape. They wanted to know if I'd bought it in Gotham City and if I'd left the nipple-molded suit it came with at home. Happy now? So anyway, after I'd finally gotten rid of them, I came over to talk to you, which you know. We decided to take a walk outside, which you also know. But then Zeus showed up and told me to \"gee tee eff oh,\" which isn't even words, so I said--why am I telling you all this, you were there. I reluctantly bid you farewell and turned to leave, but first I had to get my Helm. But it wasn't where I left it. On my chair, and before you say anything, I know I shouldn't just leave something so important unattended like that but I thought of all places Olympus would be safe. I should have known better than to trust those brothers of ours. This will be the last time I ever make that mistake, let me assure you. That was when I noticed the children that were there, the ones from Camp, and I knew that it had to be one of them, as of course it couldn't have been Zeus or Poseidon directly. I wasn't ready to make any accusations until it turned out that Zeus' little bolt was missing as well. After all, his symbol gone, my symbol gone, who was left? What do you mean, \"someone else\"? Like who? I'm sorry, Hes, but you have a pathological need to believe the best in everyone and while I do find it incredibly endearing it just doesn't work in our family. So as I was saying, you know how Poseidon went on to claim that boy of his, which makes it unsurprising but official that I am the only one of the three of us to actually hold to our so-called \"pact,\" which is especially hilarious when you consider that Maria died as a result of it-- I'm sorry. Yes. Deep breaths. No, I just have allergies. I've always had allergies at this time of year, you know that! So... where was I? Oh yes. Logic. Another thought did occur to me, and that was that Zeus is behind the theft and is claiming his bolt is missing to throw suspicion off him, but after I considered for a moment I realized how ridiculous the idea of Zeus coming up with something like that was. I considered that it had been Hera, but much as she's a stone cold--I was going to say harridan!--as much as she's... that way, there's nothing for her to gain from this. Poseidon is the most obvious and logical choice. All the signs point to him. And that's all I have to say about that. Zeus' version My turn, then? I thought that old windbag would never be done, good grief. That is nice when you consider what I was thinking about calling him. Ooh, this is a cozy chair. What is this material? Really? Hm. I think I might need one for......but that's beside the point! So. I'm supposed to tell you everything I remember about that day, right? Well, it was the day of the Council meeting of course. Almost everyone was already there when I arrived because I have to deal with everyone else's crap and they don't. There were a couple of people who were late, though. D was one of them, I assume because he was sticking it to--ah, that's not important. Poseidon came last. Migh-ty suspicious if you ask me. Other than that things seemed pretty normal. Demeter looked like she would have happily fed Hades' balls to the Minotaur, the twins were bickering like the old married couple they basically are, you know, all the usual stuff. I felt we hit all the important talking points in the meeting, you know, state of western civilization, how good I looked in my suit, the really vital stuff, right? Anyway I know where everyone was during all of that, obviously, they were listening rapt to my every word. How could they not. After the meeting ended, people began to trickle off a few at a time. I remember D bolted immediately, probably one last qu--you know, saying goodbye to Ariadne and all that. My favorite time of the year is always right after the meeting because it's the longest amount of time I get to go before I have to hear him whining again. I swear, for the love of me. Let's see... Ares... that's right, he went to talk to you... Hades was skulking around like a pedophile at a toddler beauty pageant, as is his wont. I had to talk to Hera about... some... important business matters. Really, I remember seeing just about everyone there except Poseidon. No I am not just saying that! I know because I talked to most of them. Like I exchanged about five extremely painful words with Hephaestus about the state of his forges, and I gave high fives to Hermes and Apollo after they told me what they were talking to Hades about. It was funny! It totally was. Yeah, you're smiling, that means I'm right. Ah, too late, I saw it, no take-backs! The kids were all there too, the ones from Camp. Not mine, obviously, because of that stupid pact. Yes, I'm aware, but she's a tree, and... no, let's not go down that rabbit hole. Now that you mention it, I find it hard to believe Poseidon and I would have both broken it but Hades wouldn't have. Granted, who would want to--I'm just saying, he's never been one for racking up the ladies and kidlets like his bros. It's just mathematics. Don't make that face at me, I can't help the nature of the universe. Well I don't know about that, I mean, have you seen my wife? I'm just saying. Anyway, that's somewhat beside the point, all though you've reminded me that I really do need to keep a closer eye on Hades......actually, I wonder if it's possible that he's just claiming that hat of his is missing so that I'll come to the natural conclusion that it must have been Poseidon's doing....nah, he would have had to have an accomplice, and who would team up with that. So... where was I? Right, the kids. I went over to schmooze with them a bit. I mean, I figure, hey, ho, I'm probably your grandfather, might as well remind you I'm the good guy here, right? Well, compared to like... other people. Just in general, you know! Anyway you would have been proud of me, I was the paragon of good behavior. I didn't make fun of that runty son of Apollo who looked like he could have fit in a thimble, I said nothing about the boy of Ares' who was pinging my gaydar so hard I thought it would break, and I definitely did not eye fuck that daughter of Deo's in the low-cut top no matter how hard she tried to get me to. Well, not much anyway. Anyway then I got tired of the little brats and decided to head back to work. First I had to chase Hades off--because he's not supposed to be here, that's why. And you know how I am about keeping things tidy. Then I... had to have a lengthy discussion with Hera about... the... somewhat tenuous position Olympus has found itself in in recent years. Yes, a lot of positions were discussed. Ha, I'm so clever... What? No, nothing, nothing. So it was about this time I noticed my Master Bolt was missing. I never would have thought someone would have had the 'nads to swipe it right from under my own nose, but if anyone would, it would be Poseidon. Yeah, yeah, that's for you to decide, blah blah blah. Can I take a nap here? I really like this chair. Oh, right, in the middle of something. Okay, okay, say no more, I'm gone... Poseidon's version Before you say anything, I can already guess what they said. They both talked about how I was late to the meeting and that I left right afterward. Did they mention D did the exact same thing? They did? It's just funny, that's all, that I'm immediately suspected while Zeus's favorite son gets an automatic pass. Something about what? His wife? Ah, fuck, you're right, he was probably screwing his wife. I mean... talking? In bed... naked... Okay, well, I'm going to be completely honest here and tell you exactly why I was late and had to leave right after. You see, that afternoon I'd... consumed a rather, for lack of a better word, gnarly burrito that was doing a number on my intestines. I tried to run to the bathroom while leaving myself enough time to make it to the meeting, but in my haste, my zipper got stuck. On... you know. Anyway I finally managed to get it unstuck, though that required me basically breaking the damn thing, and I ran to the meeting only barely late. So no, I was not \"plotting with my son\" in that time. Because I didn't want to go, \"Hey guys, sorry I'm late, I had a massive case of the shits and then I caught myself by the short ones and didn't want to rip them out one by one.\" It's just not really a mood-setter, you know? So anyway, as you can probably guess, the reason I left afterward was similar. Seriously, I am never eating at Otus' place again, I don't care if he is my son and it's always been his dream to run a restaurant. That place should be condemned by the board of health. And then burned to the ground. To be honest I'm still not quite recovered. That's all there is to that. Nothing sinister. Well, that burrito was pretty sinister, but nothing overthrowing-Olympus sinister. And my son certainly had nothing to do with it; he didn't even know about me at the time. Well, no, of course I don't have proof, but it's fact anyway. The point is that people should be looking elsewhere. I mean, it's a theft we're talking about, maybe someone should try looking at the god of thieves. Right? Right? Doesn't that seem logical to you? You've got that \"that seems logical indeed, Brother\" look on your face right now. It looks like the look you've got on your face right now, that's what. And Hermes has a bunch of little sprogs, and they were all here that day. What do you mean, \"motive\"? Since when has that jackass ever needed a \"motive\" to start shit? \"For the lulz,\" sis. \"For. The. Lulz.\" Look, I'm satisfied with things the way they are. I'm quite happy with my palace and my wife and my domain. Contrary to Zeus's paranoid delusions, I'm not interested in overthrowing him. Oh, come on, that was one time, and if you'll remember, Athena and Hera were in on that as well and I don't see him side-eyeing them over that to this very day. Bro needs to learn to let shit go, is all I'm saying. That's all water under the Williamsburg Bridge as far as I'm concerned. I don't want the sky--I hate the smell of ozone, for one thing, and for another the seafood is just never quite as fresh--and I don't want to be king of Olympus. He can go ahead and give me dirty looks all he wants, I'm just pissed that he's trying to drag my son into this. I'm sorry that I've done a better job keeping him alive than he did with his daughter. No, I haven't said that to him but I ought to. I'm serious! You believe me, though, right? I mean, this isn't even my style. If I did want to overthrow him, I'd just do it. None of this skulking around--doesn't that sound a bit more like Hades to you? You would say that. I don't know why whoever took their crap didn't take anything of mine. Either because they wanted to throw suspicion on me or because I take better care of my belongings and don't just leave them lying around. Or all of the above! It's not really important. The fact of the matter is that if they want them back before someone puts them to use they need to look elsewhere. My son and I are both innocent and ignorant. When Poseidon had finished speaking, Hestia sat back in her chair and thought over the information she'd been given. Finally she looked up--Poseidon was watching her expectantly--and said, \"You can come back in now.\" She knew she didn't have to say it very loudly; Zeus and Hades would have been listening at the door anyway. Sure enough, the words were barely out of her mouth before the door flew open and her other brothers stormed in. \"Well?\" they demanded simultaneously, then glared at one another. \"I have heard all each of you has had to say,\" she said carefully, \"and I am fairly certain that Poseidon... is not the culprit, nor is his son.\" The reactions to this pronouncement were as immediate as they were predictable: Poseidon pumped his fist and said, \"Yes,\" while Zeus and Hades began scoffing and protesting. Hestia held up a hand for silence, which she received. \"Poseidon has made several compelling arguments for his innocence--\" \"Yeah, right, gnarly burrito my ass,\" Zeus sneered. \"--and I am inclined to agree. In fact, I don't think anyone in this room currently has possession of either the Bolt or the Helm. I think their disappearance is the responsibility of an outside party.\" \"But who? And why?\" Hades demanded. He was agitated, but he still clearly wanted to hear her opinion on this. Hestia bit her lip. There was only one person she could think of who might want to sow this kind of discord, and she refused to believe that he would or even could. \"I don't know,\" she said at last. \"But I suspect we devote our energy to determining the identity of any other potential suspects rather than casting aspersions on one another. That will only make it easier for whoever did take the items to do whatever it is they plan to do with them.\" Zeus looked like he was about to blow. \"This isn't over,\" he told Poseidon in a dangerously low voice, then turned on his heel and left the room. \"Thanks, Hes. I knew if anybody in this family would see sense, it would be you,\" Poseidon said. With that he vanished with the smell of a salty ocean breeze. Hades sighed. \"I don't agree with your conclusion, you know.\" Hestia's shoulders slumped. \"I'm aware.\" \"There's no one else who--\" \"So you've said,\" Hestia interrupted tiredly. \"I'm worn thin, Brother.\" Hades expression softened considerably. \"Well. I'll make some tea then, shall I?\"",

      "What a pleasant greeting that was, being asked how my hostage was doing despite the fact that she knows we've been happily married for--yes, I know, apologies, I'm just trying to be thorough.",
      "As I was saying, everyone else showed up one by one, Athena came shortly after me, I think, then the twins...",
      "Zeus was one of the last.",
      "Then Dionysus.",
      "Poseidon was late, probably because he was plotting with that whelp of his--I know it's technically conjecture but it seems pretty obvious in light of what's happened since.",
      "So you know how the meeting went, you were there.",
      "Everybody was insufferable and useless.",
      "I'm being factual!",
      "Yes, they were!",
      "Whatever.",
      "Anyway, after Zeus was finally done prattling on about nothing, yes he was, I was going to go have a talk with you, but Ares beat me to it.",
      "He was asking about what?",
      "Poke... what?",
      "What is that?",
      "Oh.",
      "Indeed.",
      "I tried to make myself scarce while waiting for him to be done but that was when Apollo and Hermes approached me.",
      "And we talked and by the time we were done--what?",
      "What do you mean, \"about what\"?",
      "Nothing important....very well, then.",
      "They asked me about where I... where I got my cape.",
      "They wanted to know if I'd bought it in Gotham City and if I'd left the nipple-molded suit it came with at home.",
      "Happy now?",
      "So anyway, after I'd finally gotten rid of them, I came over to talk to you, which you know.",
      "We decided to take a walk outside, which you also know.",
      "But then Zeus showed up and told me to \"gee tee eff oh,\" which isn't even words, so I said--why am I telling you all this, you were there.",
      "I reluctantly bid you farewell and turned to leave, but first I had to get my Helm.",
      "But it wasn't where I left it.",
      "On my chair, and before you say anything, I know I shouldn't just leave something so important unattended like that but I thought of all places Olympus would be safe.",
      "I should have known better than to trust those brothers of ours.",
      "This will be the last time I ever make that mistake, let me assure you.",
      "That was when I noticed the children that were there, the ones from Camp, and I knew that it had to be one of them, as of course it couldn't have been Zeus or Poseidon directly.",
      "I wasn't ready to make any accusations until it turned out that Zeus' little bolt was missing as well.",
      "After all, his symbol gone, my symbol gone, who was left?",
      "What do you mean, \"someone else\"?",
      "Like who?",
      "I'm sorry, Hes, but you have a pathological need to believe the best in everyone and while I do find it incredibly endearing it just doesn't work in our family.",
      "So as I was saying, you know how Poseidon went on to claim that boy of his, which makes it unsurprising but official that I am the only one of the three of us to actually hold to our so-called \"pact,\" which is especially hilarious when you consider that Maria died as a result of it-- I'm sorry.",
      "Yes.",
      "Deep breaths.",
      "No, I just have allergies.",
      "I've always had allergies at this time of year, you know that!",
      "So... where was I?",
      "Oh yes.",
      "Logic.",
      "Another thought did occur to me, and that was that Zeus is behind the theft and is claiming his bolt is missing to throw suspicion off him, but after I considered for a moment I realized how ridiculous the idea of Zeus coming up with something like that was.",
      "I considered that it had been Hera, but much as she's a stone cold--I was going to say harridan!--as much as she's... that way, there's nothing for her to gain from this.",
      "Poseidon is the most obvious and logical choice.",
      "All the signs point to him.",
      "And that's all I have to say about that.",
      "Zeus' version My turn, then?",
      "I thought that old windbag would never be done, good grief.",
      "That is nice when you consider what I was thinking about calling him.",
      "Ooh, this is a cozy chair.",
      "What is this material?",
      "Really?",
      "Hm.",
      "I think I might need one for......but that's beside the point!",
      "So.",
      "I'm supposed to tell you everything I remember about that day, right?",
      "Well, it was the day of the Council meeting of course.",
      "Almost everyone was already there when I arrived because I have to deal with everyone else's crap and they don't.",
      "There were a couple of people who were late, though.",
      "D was one of them, I assume because he was sticking it to--ah, that's not important.",
      "Poseidon came last.",
      "Migh-ty suspicious if you ask me.",
      "Other than that things seemed pretty normal.",
      "Demeter looked like she would have happily fed Hades' balls to the Minotaur, the twins were bickering like the old married couple they basically are, you know, all the usual stuff.",
      "I felt we hit all the important talking points in the meeting, you know, state of western civilization, how good I looked in my suit, the really vital stuff, right?",
      "Anyway I know where everyone was during all of that, obviously, they were listening rapt to my every word.",
      "How could they not.",
      "After the meeting ended, people began to trickle off a few at a time.",
      "I remember D bolted immediately, probably one last qu--you know, saying goodbye to Ariadne and all that.",
      "My favorite time of the year is always right after the meeting because it's the longest amount of time I get to go before I have to hear him whining again.",
      "I swear, for the love of me.",
      "Let's see... Ares... that's right, he went to talk to you...",
      "Hades was skulking around like a pedophile at a toddler beauty pageant, as is his wont.",
      "I had to talk to Hera about... some... important business matters.",
      "Really, I remember seeing just about everyone there except Poseidon.",
      "No I am not just saying that!",
      "I know because I talked to most of them.",
      "Like I exchanged about five extremely painful words with Hephaestus about the state of his forges, and I gave high fives to Hermes and Apollo after they told me what they were talking to Hades about.",
      "It was funny!",
      "It totally was.",
      "Yeah, you're smiling, that means I'm right.",
      "Ah, too late, I saw it, no take-backs!",
      "The kids were all there too, the ones from Camp.",
      "Not mine, obviously, because of that stupid pact.",
      "Yes, I'm aware, but she's a tree, and...",
      "no, let's not go down that rabbit hole.",
      "Now that you mention it, I find it hard to believe Poseidon and I would have both broken it but Hades wouldn't have.",
      "Granted, who would want to--I'm just saying, he's never been one for racking up the ladies and kidlets like his bros.",
      "It's just mathematics.",
      "Don't make that face at me, I can't help the nature of the universe.",
      "Well I don't know about that, I mean, have you seen my wife?",
      "I'm just saying.",
      "Anyway, that's somewhat beside the point, all though you've reminded me that I really do need to keep a closer eye on Hades......actually, I wonder if it's possible that he's just claiming that hat of his is missing so that I'll come to the natural conclusion that it must have been Poseidon's doing....nah, he would have had to have an accomplice, and who would team up with that.",
      "So... where was I?",
      "Right, the kids.",
      "I went over to schmooze with them a bit.",
      "I mean, I figure, hey, ho, I'm probably your grandfather, might as well remind you I'm the good guy here, right?",
      "Well, compared to like... other people.",
      "Just in general, you know!",
      "Anyway you would have been proud of me, I was the paragon of good behavior.",
      "I didn't make fun of that runty son of Apollo who looked like he could have fit in a thimble, I said nothing about the boy of Ares' who was pinging my gaydar so hard I thought it would break, and I definitely did not eye fuck that daughter of Deo's in the low-cut top no matter how hard she tried to get me to.",
      "Well, not much anyway.",
      "Anyway then I got tired of the little brats and decided to head back to work.",
      "First I had to chase Hades off--because he's not supposed to be here, that's why.",
      "And you know how I am about keeping things tidy.",
      "Then I... had to have a lengthy discussion with Hera about... the... somewhat tenuous position Olympus has found itself in in recent years.",
      "Yes, a lot of positions were discussed.",
      "Ha, I'm so clever... What?",
      "No, nothing, nothing.",
      "So it was about this time I noticed my Master Bolt was missing.",
      "I never would have thought someone would have had the 'nads to swipe it right from under my own nose, but if anyone would, it would be Poseidon.",
      "Yeah, yeah, that's for you to decide, blah blah blah.",
      "Can I take a nap here?",
      "I really like this chair.",
      "Oh, right, in the middle of something.",
      "Okay, okay, say no more, I'm gone... Poseidon's version Before you say anything, I can already guess what they said.",
      "They both talked about how I was late to the meeting and that I left right afterward.",
      "Did they mention D did the exact same thing?",
      "They did?",
      "It's just funny, that's all, that I'm immediately suspected while Zeus's favorite son gets an automatic pass.",
      "Something about what?",
      "His wife?",
      "Ah, fuck, you're right, he was probably screwing his wife.",
      "I mean... talking?",
      "In bed... naked...",
      "Okay, well, I'm going to be completely honest here and tell you exactly why I was late and had to leave right after.",
      "You see, that afternoon I'd... consumed a rather, for lack of a better word, gnarly burrito that was doing a number on my intestines.",
      "I tried to run to the bathroom while leaving myself enough time to make it to the meeting, but in my haste, my zipper got stuck.",
      "On... you know.",
      "Anyway I finally managed to get it unstuck, though that required me basically breaking the damn thing, and I ran to the meeting only barely late.",
      "So no, I was not \"plotting with my son\" in that time.",
      "Because I didn't want to go, \"Hey guys, sorry I'm late, I had a massive case of the shits and then I caught myself by the short ones and didn't want to rip them out one by one.\"",
      "It's just not really a mood-setter, you know?",
      "So anyway, as you can probably guess, the reason I left afterward was similar.",
      "Seriously, I am never eating at Otus' place again, I don't care if he is my son and it's always been his dream to run a restaurant.",
      "That place should be condemned by the board of health.",
      "And then burned to the ground.",
      "To be honest I'm still not quite recovered.",
      "That's all there is to that.",
      "Nothing sinister.",
      "Well, that burrito was pretty sinister, but nothing overthrowing-Olympus sinister.",
      "And my son certainly had nothing to do with it; he didn't even know about me at the time.",
      "Well, no, of course I don't have proof, but it's fact anyway.",
      "The point is that people should be looking elsewhere.",
      "I mean, it's a theft we're talking about, maybe someone should try looking at the god of thieves.",
      "Right? Right?",
      "Doesn't that seem logical to you?",
      "You've got that \"that seems logical indeed, Brother\" look on your face right now.",
      "It looks like the look you've got on your face right now, that's what.",
      "And Hermes has a bunch of little sprogs, and they were all here that day.",
      "What do you mean, \"motive\"?",
      "Since when has that jackass ever needed a \"motive\" to start shit?",
      "\"For the lulz,\" sis.",
      "\"For.",
      "The.",
      "Lulz.\"",
      "Look, I'm satisfied with things the way they are.",
      "I'm quite happy with my palace and my wife and my domain.",
      "Contrary to Zeus's paranoid delusions, I'm not interested in overthrowing him.",
      "Oh, come on, that was one time, and if you'll remember, Athena and Hera were in on that as well and I don't see him side-eyeing them over that to this very day.",
      "Bro needs to learn to let shit go, is all I'm saying.",
      "That's all water under the Williamsburg Bridge as far as I'm concerned.",
      "I don't want the sky--I hate the smell of ozone, for one thing, and for another the seafood is just never quite as fresh--and I don't want to be king of Olympus.",
      "He can go ahead and give me dirty looks all he wants, I'm just pissed that he's trying to drag my son into this.",
      "I'm sorry that I've done a better job keeping him alive than he did with his daughter.",
      "No, I haven't said that to him but I ought to.",
      "I'm serious!",
      "You believe me, though, right?",
      "I mean, this isn't even my style.",
      "If I did want to overthrow him, I'd just do it.",
      "None of this skulking around--doesn't that sound a bit more like Hades to you?",
      "You would say that.",
      "I don't know why whoever took their crap didn't take anything of mine.",
      "Either because they wanted to throw suspicion on me or because I take better care of my belongings and don't just leave them lying around.",
      "Or all of the above!",
      "It's not really important.",
      "The fact of the matter is that if they want them back before someone puts them to use they need to look elsewhere.",
      "My son and I are both innocent and ignorant.",
      "When Poseidon had finished speaking, Hestia sat back in her chair and thought over the information she'd been given.",
      "Finally she looked up--Poseidon was watching her expectantly--and said, \"You can come back in now.\"",
      "She knew she didn't have to say it very loudly; Zeus and Hades would have been listening at the door anyway.",
      "Sure enough, the words were barely out of her mouth before the door flew open and her other brothers stormed in.",
      "\"Well?\" they demanded simultaneously, then glared at one another.",
      "\"I have heard all each of you has had to say,\" she said carefully, \"and I am fairly certain that Poseidon... is not the culprit, nor is his son.\"",
      "The reactions to this pronouncement were as immediate as they were predictable: Poseidon pumped his fist and said, \"Yes,\" while Zeus and Hades began scoffing and protesting.",
      "Hestia held up a hand for silence, which she received.",
      "\"Poseidon has made several compelling arguments for his innocence--\" \"Yeah, right, gnarly burrito my ass,\" Zeus sneered.",
      "\"--and I am inclined to agree.",
      "In fact, I don't think anyone in this room currently has possession of either the Bolt or the Helm.",
      "I think their disappearance is the responsibility of an outside party.\"",
      "\"But who?",
      "And why?\" Hades demanded.",
      "He was agitated, but he still clearly wanted to hear her opinion on this.",
      "Hestia bit her lip.",
      "There was only one person she could think of who might want to sow this kind of discord, and she refused to believe that he would or even could.",
      "\"I don't know,\" she said at last.",
      "\"But I suspect we devote our energy to determining the identity of any other potential suspects rather than casting aspersions on one another.",
      "That will only make it easier for whoever did take the items to do whatever it is they plan to do with them.\"",
      "Zeus looked like he was about to blow.",
      "\"This isn't over,\" he told Poseidon in a dangerously low voice, then turned on his heel and left the room.",
      "\"Thanks, Hes. I knew if anybody in this family would see sense, it would be you,\" Poseidon said.",
      "With that he vanished with the smell of a salty ocean breeze.",
      "Hades sighed.",
      "\"I don't agree with your conclusion, you know.\"",
      "Hestia's shoulders slumped.",
      "\"I'm aware.\"",
      "\"There's no one else who--\" \"So you've said,\" Hestia interrupted tiredly.",
      "\"I'm worn thin, Brother.\"",
      "Hades expression softened considerably.",
      "\"Well.",
      "I'll make some tea then, shall I?\""
